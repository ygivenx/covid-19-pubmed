{"title": "", "body": "Lameness can occur in any limb, and is defined as interference in the normal locomotion of the cat. It is usually pain related, and is secondary to tissue injury which has caused structural alteration, edema and inflammation.\n\nThe severity of the lameness will vary with the severity and type of the injury or insult, varying from a mild to a non-weight-bearing lameness.\n\nGenerally periosteum has the densest nerve supply of the deep tissues, and has the lowest pain threshold, followed by the joint capsule, tendon, fascia and muscle.\n\nMechanical lameness can result from an abnormal limb conformation such as shortening, angulation or a rotational abnormality.\n\nCAT WITH AN ABNORMAL GAIT PART 11 978 \u2022 Localized tetanus (p 985)\n\nOccasionally causes paresis or paralysis of a solitary limb in the initial stages, but usually advances to generalized tetanus.\n\n\u2022 Viral arthritis (p 983)\n\nCan occur secondary to calici virus exposure or vaccination; also coronavirus.\n\n\u2022 Fungal infections (p 984) Histoplasmosis, Coccidiomycosis, Sporotrichosis usually cause non-healing lesions, draining sinuses or osteomyelitis.\n\n\u2022 Toxoplasmosis (p 984)\n\nMore often causes CNS signs such as ataxia, and paresis but can cause stiff gait, shifting lameness and muscle and joint pain.\n\n\u2022 Neospora caninum (p 985)\n\nCauses encephalomyelitis with ataxia and paresis and polymyositis.\n\n\u2022 Feline progressive polyarthritis (erosive) (p 985) Rare disease; proliferative subtype occurs as acute onset in 1-5-year-old male cats, deforming subtype occurs as chronic onset in older cats. Usually several joints affected, most commonly carpus and tarsus. Proliferative subtype often has systemic signs of illness. Deforming subtype may be FeLV positive.\n\n\u2022 Immune-mediated polyarthritis (non-erosive) (p 985) Rare disease, due to deposition of immune complexes in the synovial membrane. Usually carpus and tarsus affected. May be idiopathic or associated with SLE or chronic infection.\n\n\u2022 Fractures, luxation, muscular contusions*** (p 980) Very common cause of presenting lameness.\n\n\u2022 Cruciate rupture (p 982)\n\nOccurs much less frequently in the cat than the dog, and usually less symptomatic.\n\nOccurs only rarely in the cat, predisposition in Devon Rex cats.\n\ncontinued Referred pain is pain felt in a part of the body other than that where the cause of pain is located.\n\nSigns of weakness can be confused with lameness. See The Cat With Generalized Weakness (page 941). Paresis and ataxia can also be confused with lameness. The Weak and Ataxic or Paralyzed Cat See (page 908).\n\nThe origin of the lameness may be from bone, muscle, joint or neurological.\n\nDiagnosis requires a good physical examination and orthopedic examination to localize the lameness in the affected limb or limbs.\n\nThe most common causes of lameness in the cat are cellulitis or an abscess from a cat bite injury, and motor vehicle trauma resulting in fracture or luxation.\n\nThe site of the injury is generally localized by palpation of pain and swelling at the affected site.\n\nCellulitis is often associated with pyrexia and lethargy.\n\nMotor vehicle trauma is often associated with other signs of external injury such as grazes or scuffed nails, with or without dyspnea or internal injuries.\n\n\u2022 Acute lameness of affected limb. \u2022 Pain and soft tissue swelling at site of injury. \u2022 Often associated with pyrexia, anorexia, lethargy. \u2022 Wounds in close proximity to a joint can cause septic arthritis.\n\nOccurs secondary to a penetrating bite wound, and is one of the most common causes of lameness in the cat.\n\nMany bacteria are present in the oral cavity of cats, but Pasteurella, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium are the most common organisms responsible for abscess formation, though a mixture of anaerobes and aerobes may also be present.\n\nInfection may take the form of a discrete abscess or a diffuse cellulitis.\n\nOccasionally L-forms of bacteria which lack bacterial walls are involved.\n\nAcute lameness.\n\nSoft tissue swelling and pain at the affected site.\n\nOften a small scab and evidence of a bite wound can identify the area of penetration.\n\nAssociated with variable signs of systemic illness, including depression, pyrexia and anorexia.\n\nL-forms produce a syndrome of fever and persistently draining, spreading cellulitis and synovitis that often involve extremities. Lesion is unresponsive to most antibiotics except tetracycline group.\n\nClinical signs of penetrating injury.\n\nAbscess formation can be demonstrated by aspiration of purulent material.\n\nL-form bacteria produce a discharge containing predominantly macrophages and neutrophils, but organisms cannot usually be detected cytologically or grown on culture. Response of syndrome only to tetracycline group antibiotics suggests diagnosis.\n\nSoft tissue injury caused by another form of external injury.\n\nForeign body reaction.\n\nOsteomyelitis often causes swelling and sinus formation. Rare in the cat and usually associated with an open fracture or bite wound.\n\nAbscess formation generally requires lancing, and flush with weak solution of chlorhexidine, followed by course of antibiotics sensitive to Pasteurella, i.e. amoxycillin and clavulonic acid 12 mg/kg for 5 days.\n\nRarely there may be extensive regions of necrosis, which may require debridement and delayed closure.\n\nCellulitis treated by broad-spectrum antibiotics, i.e. amoxycillin and clavulonic acid, or cephalosporins.\n\nOsteomyelitis may be a rare secondary complication resulting in sinus formation after initial healing of the abscess.\n\nL-form bacteria respond rapidly to tetracycline (22 mg/kg tid PO) or doxycycline (5 mg/kg bid PO).\n\nNormally excellent, and resolves after initial treatment.\n\nWith extensive injury the prognosis is still excellent, although it may require more prolonged treatment.\n\nWith septic arthritis some degree of degenerative joint disease will occur, although cats tolerate this with less clinical symptoms than dogs.\n\n\u2022 Acute, usually non-weight-bearing lameness of affected limb or limbs. \u2022 Soft tissue swelling at the site of injury. \u2022 Abnormal movement or angulation of the affected bone or joint.\n\nUsually due to external trauma from a motor vehicle accident.\n\nCan also occur from other external trauma such as dog attack, malicious attack or fall.\n\nHindlimb lameness in young cats less than 7 months of age is usually due to disruption of the growth plate to the femoral head rather than hip luxation.\n\nType and location of the fracture or luxation will depend on the type of forces that have occurred at the time the injury was sustained.\n\nAcute lameness of the affected limb.\n\nPain and swelling localized by physical examination.\n\nMost common sites of fractures are femur, humerus, pelvis, tibia and radius.\n\nHip luxation is the most common form of joint disruption in the mature cat.\n\nPain localized to the hip in young cats is more likely due to separation of the femoral head.\n\nFracture/luxation injuries may be open or closed.\n\nOpen shearing injuries of the carpus and tarsus often occur due to the minimal degree of soft tissues covering over these regions.\n\nUsually history of trauma.\n\nLocalization by physical examination.\n\nRadiography is normally required to demonstrate exact type and location of the fracture or luxation.\n\nCellulitis can cause a similar degree of soft tissue swelling and lameness. Usually differentiated by evidence of penetrating wound and pyrexia.\n\nNeoplasia of a bone or joint can present suddenly if associated with a pathological fracture. Very rare in the cat, and usually differentiated on radiographs.\n\nNutritional hyperparathyroidism in the young cat can present suddenly due to spontaneous fractures. Radiographically will see generalized osteopenia, with history of poorly balanced diet.\n\nWill depend on the location and extent of the injury.\n\nSimple fractures in young animals may be amenable to external coaptation, i.e. splints or casts.\n\nMore extensive fractures generally require some form of internal fixation. See relevant textbooks dealing with orthopedic diseases and management.\n\nJoint sprains or other soft tissue injuries usually respond well to brief periods, i.e. 2 weeks or less, of immobilization, or simple rest.\n\nDepends on the location and degree of severity of the injury.\n\nWith appropriate treatment most injuries have a very good prognosis for return to normal function.\n\nExcision arthroplasty in the cat for treatment of femoral head separation or fracture has a very good to excellent prognosis following surgery.\n\nCats are generally less symptomatic for osteoarthritis following joint trauma than are dogs.\n\n\u2022 Chronic, insidious lameness of the affected limb. \u2022 Lameness may be worse after sleeping, or when first rising. \u2022 May have thickening of the affected joint, with decreased range of movement. \u2022 Much less common in the cat than the dog.\n\nGenerally secondary to joint trauma such as open fracture, or penetrating bite wound.\n\nCan occur secondary to joint conformational abnormality such as hip dysplasia in Persian cats, patellar luxation or cruciate rupture.\n\nMay be part of an immune mediated polyarthritis, e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nCan occur secondary to septic arthritis from hematogenous spread or direct contamination.\n\nOccasionally occurs in association with acromegaly from excess growth hormone.\n\nInsidious lameness which may be exacerbated by strenuous activity.\n\nUsually some degree of joint thickening and reduced range of motion on physical exam.\n\nOften does not cause any clinical signs of lameness and may be incidental finding.\n\nHistory of insidious or vague intermittent lameness.\n\nRadiographs demonstrate signs of osteoarthritis such as osteophytes, periosteal proliferation and periarticular joint thickening.\n\nJoint neoplasia, which is very rare in the cat. Usually expect more extensive swelling and consistent lameness.\n\nMost cats are not symptomatic for osteoarthritis, or if associated with a sudden exacerbation of the joint normally respond well to conservative management. This involves rest and short-term non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, i.e. aspirin 10 mg/kg every 48 hours or corticosteroids, i.e. prednisolone 0.25 mg/kg daily, or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, e.g. carprofen, ketofen or meloxicam depending on availability and registration for use in cats.\n\nEncourage weight loss in fat cats.\n\nIn severe cases of osteoarthritis associated with erosive arthritis or joint instability, arthrodesis may be warranted.\n\nWith severe polyarthritis long-term prognosis is poor, with most cases relapsing after therapy.\n\n\u2022 Much rarer in the cat than the dog. \u2022 Usually results from traumatic herniation of the disc. \u2022 Clinical signs vary with the location of the disc herniation. \u2022 Signs may be acute or progressive in onset.\n\nUsually results from traumatic herniation of the disc, resulting in acute spinal cord compression.\n\nLocation of the site of herniation dictates type of clinical signs seen.\n\nUsually associated with paresis of the hindlimbs. See The Weak and Ataxic or Paralyzed Cat (page 908).\n\nLesion identified by neurological examination.\n\nConfirmation of disc herniation by radiographs, myelography or CT imaging.\n\n\u2022 Acute onset of hindlimb lameness.\n\n\u2022 May have thickening of the affected joint due to synovitis, with pain evident on palpation of the stifle. \u2022 Positive cranial drawer sign or tibial thrust. \u2022 Much less common in the cat than the dog.\n\nUsually due to external trauma such as a fall, hyperextension injury of the stifle, or excessive internal rotation of the tibia.\n\nGenerally causes rupture of the anterior cruciate, rarely is the caudal cruciate involved, unless there has been major stifle disruption.\n\nAcute lameness of the affected hindlimb.\n\nGenerally there will be stifle swelling and pain present on joint palpation.\n\nA positive cranial drawer sign or tibial thrust is generally evident on palpation, though pain may prevent an adequate examination of the joint.\n\nChronic cases may show a mild intermittent lameness as opposed to the acute injury.\n\nBy identification of a positive cranial drawer sign and pain in the stifle.\n\nTraumatic disruption of all stifle ligaments due to excessive trauma. Usually palpation will reveal laxity in a mediolateral direction also if the collaterals have been disrupted.\n\nDegenerative joint disease will usually occur, but this does not normally cause clinical signs of lameness.\n\nIn refractory cases the stifle can be stabilized with an extra-articular surgical technique. See relevant texts on surgical management of cruciate disease.\n\nGenerally the prognosis is very good to excellent with both conservative and surgical management.\n\n\u2022 Can be congenital or acquired secondary to trauma. \u2022 Much rarer in the cat than the dog, though a predisposition occurs in purebred cats such as the Devon Rex. \u2022 Lameness may be worse after sleeping, or when first rising. \u2022 May have thickening of the affected joint, with decreased range of movement.\n\nThe congenital form occurs secondary to malalignment of the quadriceps mechanism, generally resulting in a medial luxation of the patella.\n\nVarying degrees of deformity of the trochlear groove and tibial tuberosity can occur depending on the severity of the luxation.\n\nThe acquired form can occur secondary to external joint trauma from a fall or motor vehicle accident.\n\nThe congenital form is characterized by varying degrees of lameness depending on the severity of the condition. The lameness if often insidious and intermittent.\n\nUsually occurs in young, purebred cats.\n\nThe acquired form can occur at any age, usually presenting with an acute lameness.\n\nPalpation of the stifle will demonstrate luxation of the patella.\n\nPalpation of the stifle demonstrates patellar luxation, usually in a medial direction.\n\nLameness present in the affected limb, which varies with the severity of the underlying disease.\n\nIn cats with clinical disease surgery is generally warranted.\n\nType of surgery varies with the severity of the disease, ranging from lateral imbrication, deepening of the trochlear groove and transposition of the tibial tuberosity.\n\nGenerally excellent, despite the progression of some degree of degenerative joint disease.\n\n\u2022 Lameness may be of a single limb or multiple. \u2022 If all limbs involved will be reluctant to ambulate at all. \u2022 Can cause erosive or non-erosive signs radiographically. \u2022 Considered rare in the cat as a cause of lameness.\n\n\u2022 Generally from a blood-borne infection that arises from a septic foci elsewhere in the body. \u2022 Can occur from direct bite wound or open joint injury. \u2022 Rarer in cats than dogs. \u2022 Can occur in kittens secondary to umbilical vein infections. \u2022 Pasteurella species are most commonly identified. \u2022 Can be due to bacterial L forms, which are mutant bacteria, which have lost their cell wall.\n\n\u2022 Calicivirus polyarthritis can occur uncommonly in young kittens following natural exposure or after live attenuated vaccination. \u2022 Lameness usually occurs 7-10 days after mild respiratory tract signs, though can occur in the absence of respiratory signs. \u2022 Coronavirus has also been associated with polyarthritis.\n\n\u2022 The effusive form of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus occasionally causes lameness, with leakage of fluid into joint spaces. \u2022 The granulomatous form of FIP may cause paresis or paralysis as a result of spinal cord inflammation.\n\n\u2022 M. gatae is linked to arthritis and tenosynovitis in older cats. \u2022 Mycoplasmal infection may incite an antigenic response resulting in the formation of immunemediated disease such as rheumatoid-like (deforming) arthritis.\n\nAcute onset of lameness in one or several limbs.\n\nUsually associated with systemic signs such as pyrexia, lethargy.\n\nMay appear weak rather than lame if all four limbs involved.\n\nUsually demonstrate joint pain on manipulation of limbs.\n\nRadiographic signs may demonstrate changes of erosion and periosteal proliferation in advanced cases, but may show no abnormalities initially.\n\nArthrocentesis generally required for cytology and culture and sensitivity.\n\nWeak or paretic cat can appear similarly. See The Weak and Ataxic or Paralyzed Cat (page 908).\n\nImmune-mediated polyarthritis.\n\nAntibiotics for bacterial infection depending on results of culture and sensitivity.\n\nL form infections respond well to 10-14-day course of tetracycline or doxycycline.\n\nCalicivirus is often self-limiting, and cats recover well.\n\n\u2022 More commonly causes CNS signs such as ataxia and paresis. \u2022 Can cause a stiff gait, shifting leg lameness, hyperaesthesia on muscle palpation and joint pain.\n\nWith Signs of Acute Small Bowel Diarrhea) and page 958 (The Cat With Generalized Weakness).\n\nCNS signs seen most frequently, see The Paretic Cat (page 911).\n\nMay cause shifting limb lameness.\n\nCan cause arthritis and myositis.\n\nHigh IgM titers suggest recent infection, but do not confirm that T. gondii is responsible for the clinical signs in a given cat.\n\nThe organism can sometimes be seen in a muscle biopsy or very rarely in CSF.\n\n\u2022 Cats less commonly affected than dogs.\n\n\u2022 Lameness due to fungal osteomyelitis.\n\n\u2022 Can be a single bone involved, or more commonly multiple sites affected. \u2022 Spores usually inhaled from the soil. \n\nOccurrence tends to be location dependent: \u2022 Coccidioides: south-western USA, Mexico, Central and South America.\n\n\u2022 Blastomyces: small area of distribution mainly in North America and near fresh water. \u2022 Histoplasma: widespread in temperate and subtropical regions of the world, not Australia. \u2022 Cryptococcus: worldwide distribution. \u2022 Sporotrichosis: worldwide distribution.\n\nResult in non-healing tumor-like lesion of the distal limbs and draining sinus tracts (sporothrix) or lameness due to fungal osteomyelitis.\n\nRadiographically, see tumor-like lesions present in the bone with bone bony destruction and proliferation seen.\n\nOrganism is often evident in cytological preparation of aspirates or discharge from lesion or in a biopsy section.\n\nPositive fungal titer may aid diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Neurological signs such as ataxia and paresis. \u2022 Polymyositis frequently present.\n\nPolymyositis and encepalomyelitis with ataxia and paresis are seen most frequently.\n\nSerum titers and muscle biopsy results are the most common methods of diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Retrograde axonal transport of the toxin from an infected focus. \u2022 Can cause paralysis of single limb. \u2022 Usually progresses to generalized tetanus.\n\nWith an Abnormal Third Eyelid).\n\nOccurs following penetrating trauma and tissue devitilization.\n\nCan see paresis or paralysis of a solitary limb in the initial stages.\n\nGenerally advances to generalized tetanus.\n\nHistory of recent wound and clinical signs.\n\nEMG findings characteristic with persistent electrical motor unit discharges following needle insertion or tapping of muscles.\n\nSerum antibody titer to tetanus toxin compared with control cats may aid diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Are considered rare diseases in the cat. \u2022 Can be acute or chronic onset. \u2022 Often associated with other systemic signs such as lethargy, pyrexia and anorexia. \u2022 Can cause erosive or non-erosive signs radiographically.\n\n\u2022 Chronic progressive polyarthritis has proliferative and deforming subtypes. \u2022 Proliferative form occurs in male cats aged 1-5 years. \u2022 Deforming type occurs more rarely in older cats. \u2022 Severe subchondral bone destruction may occur, leading to joint instability and deformity. \u2022 Radiographic signs are similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis in other species. \u2022 Often associated with feline leukemia viruspositive cats.\n\n\u2022 Mycoplasmal products have been postulated to chronically stimulate immune-mediated diseases such as deforming arthritis.\n\n\u2022 Can be due to systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic infection elsewhere, or idiopathic. \u2022 Due to deposition of immune complexes in the synovial membrane which incites an inflammatory response. \u2022 The inciting agent is usually not identified, but if the cat is on medication this may be a potential source and should be discontinued.\n\nDeforming type of progressive polyarthritis has a chronic onset. All other forms tend to be acute onset of lameness and stiffness.\n\nOften affects carpus and tarsus more severely than other joints.\n\nRadiographic signs in erosive forms show marked destruction and deformity of the distal joints often resulting in luxation or subluxation but with minimal periosteal proliferation.\n\nThe proliferative form is characterized by periarticular soft tissue swelling in the early stages, then progressing to extensive periarticular proliferation. This is most frequently seen in the carpi, tarsi and smaller distal joints.\n\nArthrocentesis preferably done on two or more joints. Joint fluid is generally slightly increased in amount, slightly turbid, and with reduced viscosity. Cytology typically reveals a non-septic purulent inflammation, with cell counts in the range of 4000-70 000 nucleated cells/\u03bcl, and predominantly non-degenerative neutrophils. A variable number of small and large mononuclear cells may also be present.\n\nMycoplasma.\n\nRheumatoid factor, ANA and LE cell tests are consistently negative.\n\nHematological parameters are generally unremarkable.\n\nInfectious arthritides, such as viral infections.\n\nCauses of weakness and paresis in the cat. See The Weak and Ataxic or Paralyzed Cat (page 908).\n\nRemove the cause if secondary to drug administration or chronic infection.\n\nTreatment consists of immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids for several months, or in combination with chlorambucil at 1.0-1.25 mg/cat once daily, and prednisolone 10-20 mg twice daily until resolution of clinical signs, then slowly taper the dose of prednisolone over 2-4 months. Continue the chlorambucil at the same dose every other day. Combination of prednisolone and gold salts (aurothioglucose 1 mg/kg by injection once a week) has also been used.\n\nGood initial response to drugs, but greater than 50% of cases are likely to relapse, becoming more refractory to treatment.\n\nClassical signs \u2022 Rarer in the cat than dog. \u2022 May be acute or insidious onset of lameness. \u2022 Usually associated with swelling at site of neoplasia.\n\nPrimary bone tumors are rare in the cat. Osteosarcoma is the most commonly identified tumor.\n\nGenerally occurs in cats older than 10 years.\n\nPrimary bone tumors are much less metastatic in the cat than the dog.\n\nMetastatic spread from carcinomas to bone is very rare in the cat, compared to the dog.\n\nCan get carcinomas of the digits secondary to primary lung tumors.\n\nJoint neoplasias are very rare in the cat, and are due to synovial cell sarcomas or other soft tissue sarcomas.\n\nMultiple cartilaginous exostoses or feline osteochondromatosis can transform to a malignant disease in the cat.\n\nLameness can also occur from nerve sheath tumors of the plexus or spinal cord, but these are very rare in the cat.\n\nCan be acute or insidious onset of lameness.\n\nRarely can be associated with pathological fracture.\n\nUsually thickening identified at site of disease, which may or may not be painful.\n\nRadiographically, will see bone lysis in the metaphyseal region of long bones, or joint thickening and proliferation.\n\nHistopathology is required for definitive diagnosis.\n\nThoracic radiographs should be taken to demonstrate primary lung tumor if multiple digits are swollen, or prior to amputation to rule out metastatic disease.\n\nOsteomyelitis.\n\nSeptic arthritis.\n\nIf no evidence of metastatic disease, amputation is the treatment of choice.\n\nIf a solitary tumor of a digit is present, often this can be removed and the limb saved.\n\nIf no evidence of metastatic disease, then amputation is often curative, with median survival times greater than 2 years.\n\nPrimary bone tumors in the cat are a lot less aggressive than in the dog and generally not followed with chemotherapy.\n\n\u2022 Usually occurs in Persian and long-haired cats. \u2022 Usually asymptomatic in cats compared to dogs. \u2022 Generally requires only conservative management.\n\nCongenital disorder of Persian and other long-haired cats.\n\nRadiographically, see luxation of the coxofemoral joint, with varying degrees of osteoarthritis present.\n\nUsually no clinical signs of lameness are seen.\n\nPain may be exhibited on flexion and extension of the hip joints.\n\nOccasionally may show signs of a stiff gait or lameness, which is exacerbated by excessive activity.\n\nPain on manipulation of the hip joints in a long-haired cat.\n\nRadiographic evidence of hip laxity and osteoarthritis.\n\nUsually conservative management consisting of rest, weight loss and intermittent anti-inflammatory drugs is all that is required in symptomatic cats.\n\nIf lameness persists femoral head and neck arthroplasty results in an excellent prognosis.\n\n\u2022 Onset of forelimb lameness in the cat less than 1 year of age.\n\nVery rare in the cat.\n\nHas been reported as cause of shoulder lameness.\n\nOccurs due to a defect in osteochondral ossification.\n\nInsidious forelimb lameness in cats less than 1 year of age.\n\nPain identified on full extension and flexion of the shoulder joint.\n\nRadiographically a thickened flap of cartilage or joint mouse can be identified in the shoulder joint.\n\nSurgical removal of the cartilaginous flap.\n\nExcellent.\n\n\u2022 Onset of hindlimb lameness in the cat less than 1 year of age.\n\nUncommon condition.\n\nReported in male cats less than 2 years of age.\n\nIdiopathic necrosis of femoral neck.\n\nVague, progressive hindlimb lameness.\n\nMay be bilateral.\n\nRadiographically, see radiolucency of the femoral neck and proximal femoral metaphysis.\n\nTraumatic fracture of the femoral neck.\n\nFemoral head and neck osteotomy.\n\nExcellent.\n\n\u2022 Rare inherited disorder in Siamese and Siamese cross cats. \u2022 Causes a stiff gait and paraparesis. \u2022 Cats also have a broad maxilla, corneal clouding, pectus excavatum and neurological abnormalities.\n\nRare inherited disorder that occurs as a result of a lysosomal enzyme deficiency in Siamese and Siamese cross cats.\n\nUsually present at less than 6 months of age.\n\nTypically have dysmorphic facial features (a broad maxilla), plump paws (from thickened skin) and corneal clouding.\n\nGenerally exhibit a stiff gait and paraparesis with diffuse neurological signs.\n\nAlso present with a chronic mucoid ocular discharge and chronic respiratory tract infections.\n\nConstellation of clinical signs suggests the diagnosis.\n\nRadiographs show dysplastic femoral heads and necks and subluxated hip joints.\n\nExcessive granulation of neutrophils, and vacuolation of lymphocytes are suggestive.\n\nPositive urine toluidine test for sulfated beta glycosaminoglycans is consistent with diagnosis.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is via enzyme assays of leukocytes and skin fibroblasts to demonstrate deficient beta glucuronidase activity.\n\n\u2022 A defect in osteogenesis results in multiple spontaneous fractures. \u2022 Present with multiple sites of bony pain due to fractures, or unwilling to ambulate. \u2022 Lameness generally of young cats.\n\nA heritable disease with failure of osteoprogenitor cells to develop into mature osteoblasts.\n\nResults in bones that are very brittle and fracture spontaneously.\n\nSpontaneous fractures can occur in any bones, although the long bones are more commonly affected.\n\nRadiographically the cortical bone is very osteopenic, with multiple fractures present.\n\n\u2022 Disease affecting cats with at least one fold-eared parent. \u2022 Lameness generally occurs at 5-6 months of age.\n\nInherited disorder of fold-ear cats.\n\nGet shortening of the coccygeal vertebrae, metacarpal and metatarsal bones and phalanges.\n\nThey may develop periarticular exostoses and joint ankylosis.\n\n\u2022 A congenital disorder characterized by dorso-ventral flattening of the thorax. \u2022 Kittens and cats show variations in respiratory and cardiovascular abnormalities. \u2022 Also associated with lateral limb deviation.\n\nA deformity of the sternal and costal cartilages resulting in narrowing of the thorax.\n\nOccurs as a congenital abnormality of cats, with the specific cause unknown.\n\nCan be associated with the so-called \"wimmer's\"syndrome, in which there is lateral deviation of the limbs and impaired ambulation.\n\nKittens and young mature cats < 1 year of age may show respiratory and cardiovascular abnormalities associated with flattening of the thorax.\n\nBased on clinical signs and radiographic findings of dorso-ventral flattening of thorax and lateral deviation of limbs. \n\nImproper closure of the neural tube during embryogenesis occurs, with varying severity of neurological signs seen affecting hindlimb function and urinary and fecal control.\n\nIn the Manx cat it is often associated with sacral dysgenesis.\n\nBased on clinical signs, radiographic findings.\n\n\u2022 Due to excessive intake of vitamin A, usually from an all-liver diet. \u2022 Lameness occurs due to bony exostoses around the cervical vertebrae and ankylosis of joints.\n\nDue to excessive vitamin A intake over several months, usually from an all-liver diet.\n\nCauses bony exostoses of spine and osseous hyperplasia and proliferation at joint margins, particularly the shoulder and elbow joints.\n\nExcess vitamin A causes increased reactivity of the periosteum, resulting in bony proliferation at sites of joint capsule and soft tissue attachments to bone.\n\nCats are often reluctant to move around, and are very painful.\n\nThey often display an abnormal posture with a stiff neck and gait.\n\nRadiographically there is ankylosis of cervical and cranial thoracic vertebra, and new bone proliferation around shoulder and elbow joints.\n\nHistory of diet almost exclusively of liver.\n\nCorrection of the diet, ideally on a balanced commercial diet.\n\nMay require short-term analgesics.\n\nCorrection of the diet halts the progression of disease, and some remodeling of existing bone may occur. However, bony changes are often permanent and pain may persist.\n\n\u2022 Lameness present in multiple sites in young kittens. \u2022 Due to a diet deficient in calcium, such as an all-meat diet.\n\nDue to increased parathyroid hormone from persistent hypocalcemia, either from an absolute dietary calcium deficiency or secondary to excessive phosphorus intake relative to calcium.\n\nCauses generalized osteopenia.\n\nMost commonly seen in kittens on an all-meat diet.\n\nOccurs with an all-meat diet even if the kittens have access to milk.\n\nOsteopenia can result in spontaneous fracture.\n\nHistory of inadequate diet.\n\nRadiographs demonstrate diffuse osteopenia, with or without folding fractures.\n\nCorrect the diet by adding calcium, or more appropriately, change to a balanced commercial diet formulated for kittens.\n\nConfine if multiple folding fractures are evident.\n\nVery good if fractures have not resulted in malunion.\n\nResidual deformity of the spine and pelvis may result in chronic partial bowel obstruction with constipation.\n\n\u2022 Lameness present in multiple sites in young kittens. \u2022 Due to a diet deficient in vitamin D or insufficient mineral content, such as an allmeat diet.\n\nDiet deficient in vitamin D or with insufficient mineral content causes the cartilaginous matrix of the growth plate not to calcify.\n\nResults in osteopenia and widening of the growth plates.\n\nOsteopenia can result in spontaneous fracture.\n\nAbnormalities of the growth plate with rickets can cause angular limb deformities.\n\nDiffuse osteopenia, and may see pathological fractures.\n\nWith rickets see widened growth plates and osteopenia.\n\nCorrect the diet by feeding a balanced commercial diet, and adequate exposure to light.\n\nMay require confinement if multiple fractures have occurred.\n\nUsually excellent prognosis if there is not abnormal limb angulation. Correction of the diet corrects the underlying osteopenia and growth plate defect."}
