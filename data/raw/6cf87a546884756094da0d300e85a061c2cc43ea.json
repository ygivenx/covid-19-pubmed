{"title": "A retrospective study of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in 26 children", "body": "Pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei, China and then the epidemic broke out. It was defined by the World Health Organization as \"an international public health emergency of public concern\" [1, 2] . Recently, many researches in the lancet reported the epidemiological, clinical symptoms, laboratory data, imaging features, treatment methods and clinical outcomes of non-pregnant adults and pregnant women infected with 2019-nCOV [3, 4] . However, the clinical characteristics of children have not been well disclosed, and whether there are differences in treatment methods has not been determined. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 28 children with COVID-19 tested positive for 2019-nCOV by use of RT-PCR on samples.\n\nWe reviewed 26 cases of children(>1 year old and <14 years old) in the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 8, 2020 . Diagnosis of\n\nProgram(6th edition) issued by the National Health and Health Committee of China [5] .\n\nThe study was approved by the instututional of research ehtics committee of the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen ([2020-063]).\n\nWe collected the clinical manifestations, laboratory results, chest CT, treatment methods, and outcomes of 26 children, and the data was updated until February 19. To ensure the accuracy of the data, the data were independently checked by two clinicians. Each .

There were 9 males (35%) and 17 females (65%), with an average age of 6.9 (0.7) years, ranging from 1 to 13 years (table 1). None of the above children had underlying diseases such as congenital diseases, dysplasia, diabetes, etc. Because some children cannot expresss independently, the clinical symptoms were mainly objective symptoms. Most patients had fever and cough at admission. About one-third of the patients had no clear symptoms, and other symptoms included vomiting, diarrhea, and rhinorrhoea (table 1). According to the standard,8 cases(31%) were mild and 18(69%) were ordinary. No severe complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) occurred in the cases. Laboratory results revealed that most of the blood routine showed normal or decreased white blood cell counts, lymphocytes generally increased, and hemoglobin .

There were no significant abnormalities in coagulation function. In terms of biochemistry, Alanine transaminase (ALT) combine with glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST) increased in two cases(8%),ALT or AST increased in one case(4%).In addition, all the above cases had not exceed 50% of the normal high value. Most of the myocardial enzymes(myoglobin, troponin, kinase, creatine kinase) were not abnormal, with only a significant increase in LDH(46%). In the field of inflammatory mediators (table 2) , procalcitonin was normal, and 5(19%) patients had elevated C-reative protein. 19 patients were tested for interleukin-6 and only one had an increase. T-lymphocyte subset analysis showed no abnormalities in CD3+CD4+/CD3+CD8+.Humoral immunity showed that IgA, IgG, and C3c were partially reduced (table 2) , and IgM and C4 were normal. According to chest X-ray and chest CT examination, 8 patients(31%) had no pulmonary infiltration. There were 11 cases(42%) of lateral pulmonary infiltration and 7 cases(27%) of bilateral pulmonary infiltration.\n\nAll patients were treated in isolation. Medicines for treating COVID-19 include oseltamivir, ribavirin, interferon, kaletra and traditional Chinese medicine.4 patients (15%) were treated with interferon alone and 1 patient (4%) was treated with kaletra alone.26 patients discharge (13.6\u00b11.03 days on average) or improvement after treatment.\n\nThere was no significant increase in inflammatory indexes and mild clinical symptoms in 26 patients, all of them were mild and common type cases, no severe pneumonia cases and death cases, and the outcome was similar to that of SARS. Among them, 11 patients (about 42%) had fever, which was inconsistent with 98% of the .

Other symptoms such as nasal obstruction, runny nose, vomiting and diarrhea [1, 3, 6] were less common than adults.\n\nAll of the above suggest that the clinical symptoms of children infected with 2019-CoV were not typical. It is considered that most of the children might be infected after exposure to patients with COVID-19, which belongs to the second or third generation of infected cases, and the pathogenicity of the virus is decreased.\n\nIn addition, the changes of leukocytes in children were the same as in adults, and most of them appear normal or decreased. Lymphocytes in adult patients had decreased significantly, and this study found that most of the children's lymphocytes increased beyond the normal range, which might be related to the higher percentage of The literature reported that the prognosis of elderly patients and those with chronic .

In this study, the prognosis of children with COVID-19 was good, and the prognosis was different from that of middle-aged and elderly patients in other studies. Consider that the difference was related to thymic immune function. In the treatment of SARS patients, drugs such as glucocorticoids and thymosin were used [7] . Although there was no clinical evidence to support the use of glucocorticoids [8] , whether early use of thymosin and gamma globulin for immunomodulation in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 can reduce cytokine storms, reduce clinical symptoms and improve prognosis requires further exploration.\n\nExcept that LDH increased in the myocardial zymogram of children with COVID-19 in the study, other enzymes such as creatine kinase and troponin I were normal. In addition to being derived from the heart muscle, LDH was also found in the liver and kidneys.\n\nWe speculated that the increase in LDH may not originate from the myocardium, suggesting that children's infections were less likely to affect the myocardium. Similar to other studies [1, 3, 4] , this study found that ALT and AST increased, so we cannot rule out the effect of 2019-nCoV on the liver and induce the increase of liver enzymes. As patients often use antiviral drugs in the early stage of hospitalization, it was also necessary to consider the increase of liver enzymes caused by drug factors. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) had been shown to be one of the main receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells [9, 10] , while ACE2 was at high expression levels in the kidney, vas deferens and testicular mesenchymal cells [11] .SARS had been shown to cause orchitis and affect spermatogenesis function [11, 12] .Although acute renal impairment had not yet occurred in pediatric cases, .

The specimens included nasopharyngeal swabs, blood, sputum, and anal swabs. We found that nasal swabs and anal swabs were positive even without respiratory symptoms such as cough and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea Therefore, the source of samples cannot be selected based on clinical manifestations, and should be submitted multiple times and at multiple sites to avoid misdiagnosis of patients with mild imaging without imaging manifestations. Although there is no clinical evidence that the virus is transmitted through the conjunctival pathway [13] , mother-infant, and breast-milk [4] , researchers have detected the virus in urine [14] , saliva [15] , suggesting that novel coronavirus has a wide range of transmission routes.\n\nThe clinical classification of children was mostly mild or ordinary type, so the treatment plan is relatively simple. In some cases, the nucleic acid test turned negative after treatment with interferon atomization or lopinavir ritonavir. For mild children, symptomatic treatment or single use of traditional Chinese medicine needs to be further verified.\n\nThe sample size of this study was only 26, and it was a retrospective study, so it has certain limitations. On the one hand, the article only included children aged 1-14 years.\n\nThe characteristics of newborns infected with COVID-19 are not clear, and whether there are differences in the disease characteristics of infants, preschool and school-age children need further research; On the other hand, the changes of T lymphocyte subsets in children need to be tracked and observed during the course of the disease.\n\n.

In our study, the clinical types were mild and common, and the probability of severe complications such as myocarditis and ARDS was low, which provided important information for understanding the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19.\n\n.
