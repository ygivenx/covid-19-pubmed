{"title": "", "body": "After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the Chinese government strengthened the country's infectious disease surveillance system. 1 A new web-based reporting system was established utilizing modern information technology. The new surveillance system was implemented formally in 2004. The new surveillance system has played an important role in detecting infectious diseases in a timely fashion, which has helped to protect the lives and health of the entire population and has reduced the economic and health impacts of the diseases on the whole of society. This new system is the largest infectious disease surveillance system covering the largest population in the world. 2 It has become possible to detect more infections and the data have become more complete and reliable since the new reporting system was established. 3 A survey showed that the average omission rate was 13% among the medical institutions throughout the country; the compliance rate for outpatient daily registration was 96%, the registry integrity rate was 97%, and the timely reporting rate for the medical institutions was 91%. 4 Thirty-nine notifiable infectious diseases are currently included in the surveillance system. These are divided into classes A, B, and C. 5 Class A notifiable diseases include the plague and cholera, which can cause large epidemics within a short period of time. Class B notifiable diseases include 28 infectious diseases that might cause epidemics, including AIDS, anthrax, etc. Class C notifiable diseases include less severe and less infectious diseases, such as mumps, rubella, acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, leprosy, leishmaniasis, hydatid disease, etc.\n\nIt has been over 10 years since the implementation of the new web-based surveillance system. Since this system covers a large population, the surveillance data can stably show the behaviour of a disease in terms of occurrence. Statistical modelling has been used previously to summarize the time series behaviour of disease. 6 In the current study, the monthly time series data for 28 class B infectious diseases reported from 2005 to 2014 were collected. The class B infectious diseases were selected for study, as most of these diseases occur more frequently than class A diseases and they cause more severe epidemics than class C diseases. Class B infectious diseases are the main focus of the surveillance process. A descriptive analysis and time series study was performed. 7 Decomposition methods were used to analyse the seasonal pattern and long-term trends of the class B notifiable infectious diseases for the years 2005-2014.\n\nAvailable time series data for the monthly reported cases of 28 class B infectious diseases were gathered for the years 2005-2014. These 28 class B infectious diseases are AIDS, anthrax, avian influenza, brucellosis, cerebrospinal meningitis, dengue fever, diphtheria, dysentery, gonorrhoea, hepatitis disease (including hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), and other types of hepatitis), haemorrhagic fever, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, malaria, measles, neonatal tetanus, pertussis, polio, rabies, scarlet fever, schistosomiasis, syphilis, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever. The data were reported by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The incidences of these diseases are shown in Figure 1 .\n\nA descriptive study was first performed, and decomposition methods were used to extract the underlying pattern in the infectious disease time series. The decomposition methods have been reported in previous studies. 6, 8 Decomposition breaks down the underlying patterns of time series into seasonality and longterm trends. The seasonal trend in the infection series can be expressed using seasonal indices. To calculate the seasonal factors, overall incidences are first averaged, and then the averaged incidence is divided by the mean incidence for each month. For example, the average incidence of malaria was 0.1344/100 000 during the 10 years and the mean incidence in May was 0.1059/ 100 000, thus the seasonal index for May is 0.788 (0.1344/0.1059). Seasonality shows the periodic fluctuations that are usually caused by known factors such as rainfall, temperature, timing of the holidays, etc. If the seasonal index is greater than 1, it means that the incidence is higher than the average level. Otherwise, it means that the incidence is lower than the average level. The trend cycle represents the long-term changes in the infection. After the seasonal indices have been calculated, one can deseasonalize the data by dividing by the corresponding index. A linear regression model is a simple way to express the long-term trend, in which a common linear regression model is established between the deseasonalized incidence and time t.\n\nThe numbers of cases of the 28 class B notifiable diseases during the years 2005-2014 are shown in Table 1 . During the 10-year period, 38 982 567 cases and 126 372 deaths were reported in the system. Tuberculosis, HBV, syphilis, dysentery, and HCV were the top 5 ranking diseases in terms of the number of cases. The numbers of deaths caused by the 28 class B notifiable diseases for the years 2005-2014 are shown in Table 2 . AIDS, tuberculosis, rabies, HBV, Japanese encephalitis, haemorrhagic fever, and neonatal tetanus were the top 7 ranking diseases in terms of the number of deaths; these diseases each caused more than 1000 deaths during the 10 years.\n\nWith regard to the numbers of cases, tuberculosis represented the highest proportion among the 28 class B notifiable diseases With regard to the numbers of deaths, the disease proportions changed dramatically over the 10 years ( Figure 3 ). In 2005, tuberculosis caused the highest proportion of deaths among the 2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  Total   AIDS  968  942  1200  4158  4486  9531  10 726  12 483  11 718  12 317  68 529  Tuberculosis  2618  2475  2073  2368  3075  1742  1930  1935  1887  1772  21 875  Rabies  2191  2692  2873  2350  2103  1986  1902  1372  1082  873  19 424  Hepatitis B virus  849  841  838  930  830  723  686  638  593  398  7326  Japanese encephalitis  160  387  165  135  171  95  73  67  77  36  1366  Hepatitis C virus  102  151  123  131  155  142  137  110  163  134  1348  Haemorrhagic fever  227  145  129  107  107  120  127  99  119  85  1265  Neonatal tetanus  231  187  160  195  130  95  59  57  49  14  1177  Syphilis  81  89  74  91  76  86  102  102  82  87  870  Cerebrospinal meningitis  172  138  104  117  90  34  25  24  22  15  741  Dysentery  131  112  68  57  37  42  28  17  14  5  511  Other hepatitis  103  88  75  59  41  32  18  23  19  13  471  Measles  47  31  64  111  40  27  12  7  28  27  394  Hepatitis E virus  44  40  39  31  24  34  41  23  20  15  311  Malaria  40  30  14  20  10  16  32  14  22  23  221  Hepatitis A virus  36  33  23  13  22  6  14  9  4  8  168  Leptospirosis  41  17  31  17  11  12  5  5  7  8  154  Typhoid  13  18  7  7  10  3  2  6  5  1  72  Anthrax  11  12  1  1  3  6  3  1  1  3  42  Avian influenza  5  8  2  4  4  1  1  1  2  0  28  Gonorrhoea  1  5  0  3  3  1  3  1  1  3  21  Schistosomiasis  2  3  1  0  2  0  2  5  1  0  16  Brucellosis  5  0  0  1  1  1  0  2  2  2  14  Pertussis  1  4  0  0  1  1  2  1  0  2 Table 3 and Figure 4 . The standard deviation and range are given in Table 3 . There were six diseases for which the seasonal index range was greater than 2: dengue fever (high in September and October, and low in all of the other months), Japanese encephalitis (high from July to September, and low in the other months), leptospirosis (high in September and low from January to June), anthrax (high in August and low from December to April), cerebrospinal meningitis (high from February to April, and low from June to November), and measles (high from March to June, and low from August to December). The seasonal indices for malaria (high from July to September, and low from December to April), dysentery (high from June to September, and low from January to March), haemorrhagic fever (high in November and December, and low in August and September), scarlet fever (high in May and June, and low in February), and brucellosis (high from May to July, and low in January) were between 1 and 2. The variations in hepatitis disease, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (including gonorrhoea, syphilis, and AIDS) were relatively lower than those of the other diseases.\n\nFrom the coefficient of regression (Table 4) , we can derive how much the incidence changes on average by month after removing the effect of seasonality. The incidence of syphilis increased fastest among the 28 diseases. The syphilis incidence rate increased on average by 0.018626/100 000 every month after adjustment for seasonality. Seven other diseases had an increasing incidence, including HCV (0.010042/100 000), AIDS (0.002891/100 000), brucellosis (0.002242/100 000), scarlet fever (0.001311/100 000), dengue fever (0.000959/100 000), HEV (0.000801/100 000), and schistosomiasis (0.000136/100 000). The incidences of 18 diseases decreased, among which tuberculosis (\u00c00.019143/100 000), dysentery (\u00c00.015704/100 000), and HBV (\u00c00.009740/100 000) dropped fastest.\n\nThe infectious disease surveillance system has been in use for over 10 years since it was established. A descriptive analysis and time series study of 28 class B notifiable diseases was performed. 10 It has been reported that HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) has been rising in China, with an estimated prevalence rate of 7.3% in 2013. 11 MSM represent over a quarter of new reported infections; however studies aimed at understanding the epidemic in this population are extremely limited. Another great concern is that the prevalence of AIDS among young people has increased rapidly in China. It has been reported that the prevalence among 15-24-year-olds doubled from 0.9% to 1.7% between 2008 and 2012. 11 Research reported by Tucker et al. indicated that very few Chinese people with symptoms of a STD sought medical attention 10-15 years ago. 12 If people have become more likely to seek medical attention for these diseases in recent years, then this could have contributed in part to the increase in reported AIDS and syphilis cases seen in the current study.\n\nTuberculosis is another very severe disease in China, in terms of both occurrence and deaths; 14 088 313 cases were reported from 2005 to 2014, with 21 875 deaths in all. China has the world's second largest tuberculosis epidemic, behind India. 13 Progress towards the control of tuberculosis was slow before the 2003 SARS outbreaks and the number of detected tuberculosis cases was only about 30% of the estimated total new cases. 14 With the establishment of the new surveillance system, the government has improved public health findings as well as leadership to tackle public health problems. It was reported that the detection of cases previous studies. 15 The incidence of rabies decreased dramatically during the 10 years. Various control policies have been implemented by the government, which have played an important role in reducing rabies incidence in China. 16 The seasonality of this disease series was analysed. Decomposition methods were used to decompose the surveillance time series data into seasonal patterns and long-term patterns; this can help in gaining an understanding of the behaviour of diseases over time. 17 The same methods were used on surveillance data for nine infectious disease for the years 2005-2011 in a previous study. 6 Seasonal patterns are one major pathway for the subtle but potentially drastic effects of climate change on disease dynamics. 18 In the current study, the seasonal patterns were quantified in the form of seasonal indices. Some of the infectious diseases, such as dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, anthrax, cerebrospinal meningitis, and measles, showed more obvious seasonality. Other diseases, such as the STDs, hepatitis disease, and tuberculosis showed relatively smooth seasonal index curves.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis of decomposition, long-term patterns and residuals remain in the series after seasonal indices are extracted. Modelling the long-term trends is helpful in understanding their epidemic behaviour. The model can be used to predict the future incidence, which is helpful for public health management and vaccine preparation. The long-term patterns of the 28 class B infectious diseases were also shown with a linear regression model between the deseasonalized series (dependent variable) and time t (independent variable). The model showed that most diseases have decreased with improvements in socioeconomic status and the strengthening of public health management. However, many diseases are still increasing or emerging, including syphilis, HCV, AIDS, brucellosis, scarlet fever, HEV, and schistosomiasis.\n\nFighting these diseases is a big challenge. The incidences of STDs (such as AIDS and syphilis), viral hepatitis, and zoonoses (such as rabies, brucellosis, and schistosomiasis) increased dramatically and they caused great numbers of deaths during the 10-year period studied. One of the biggest challenges in combating STDs and viral hepatitis is the health management of floating immigrants; such immigrants were reported to account for 10% of the total Chinese population in 2005. 11 They have been found to be more vulnerable to infectious diseases, especially STDs and viral hepatitis. Safe sex education, timely physical testing, and the promotion of protection measures are useful in the prevention of STDs and virus hepatitis. The infection surveillance system needs to be strengthened to cover the floating immigrants.\n\nThe transmission of zoonotic infections relies on the interaction between infected animals and humans. Strengthening the management of pets and other animals is urgently needed to combat zoonotic diseases, which are also a great challenge. It has been reported that only 30% of dog owners register their animals with government authorities and that only 2-8% of dogs are vaccinated against rabies; 19, 20 this is of great concern in the management of zoonotic disease.\n\nEffective disease surveillance is helpful in understanding the infectious behaviour of diseases with the help of statistical models. This is useful for public health management and disease control. Future studies are needed to explore other statistical methods and data mining techniques to identify the behaviour of infectious diseases and to predict disease occurrence."}
