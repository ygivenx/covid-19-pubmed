{"title": "SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to type I interferon pretreatment", "body": "At the end of 2019, a cluster of patients in Hubei Province, China was diagnosed with a 27 viral pneumonia of unknown origins. With community links to the Hunnan seafood market in 28\n\nWuhan, the disease cluster had echoes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 29 (SARS-CoV) outbreak that emerged at the beginning of the century 1 . The 2019 etiologic agent 30 was identified as a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, and subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2 2 . 31\n\nThe new virus has nearly 80% nucleotide identity to the original SARS-CoV and the 32 corresponding CoV disease, COVID-19, has many of the hallmarks of SARS-CoV disease 33 including fever, breathing difficulty, bilateral lung infiltration, and death in the most extreme 34 cases 3,4 . In addition, the most severe SARS-CoV-2 disease corresponded to old age (>50 35 years old), health status, and health care workers, similar to both SARS and MERS-CoV 5 . 36\n\nTogether, the results indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease have strong similarity to the 37 original SARS-CoV epidemic occurring nearly two decades earlier. 38\n\nIn the wake of the outbreak, major research efforts have sought to rapidly characterize 39 the novel CoV to aid in treatment and control. Initial modeling studies predicted 6 and 40 subsequent cell culture studies confirmed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 utilizes human 41 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry, the same receptor as SARS-CoV 7,8 . 42\n\nExtensive case studies indicated a similar range of disease onset and severe symptoms seen 43 with SARS-CoV 5 . Notably, less severe SARS-CoV-2 cases have also been observed and were 44 not captured in the original SARS-CoV outbreak. Importantly, screening and treatment guidance 45 has relied on previous CoV data generated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Treatments with 46 both protease inhibitors and type I interferon (IFN-I) have been employed 4 ; similarly, remdesivir, 47 a drug targeting viral polymerases, has been reported to have efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 48 similar to findings with both SARS-and MERS-CoV 9-12 . Importantly, several vaccine efforts 49 have been initiated with a focus on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as the major antigenic 50 determinate 13 . Together, the similarities with SARS-CoV have been useful in responding to the 51 newest CoV outbreak. 52\n\nThe host Innate immune response is initiated when viral products are recognized by host 53 cell pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors 54 (RLRs) 14, 15 . This response ultimately results in production of IFN-I and other cytokines, which 55 together are essential for an effective antiviral response 16 . IFN-I then triggers its own signaling 56 cascade via its receptor, in autocrine or paracrine manner, which induces phosphorylation of 57 signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2. Together, STAT1, 58 STAT2, and a third transcription factor, IRF9, form the Interferon Stimulated Gene Factor 3 59 (ISGF3) complex, which is essential for induction of many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and 60 ultimately and effective antiviral response 17,18 . To establish productive replication, viruses have 61 developed different mechanisms to escape this antiviral response targeting different parts of the 62 IFN-I response machinery 19 . 63\n\nIn this study, we further characterize SARS-CoV-2 and compare it to the original SARS-64\n\nCoV. Using Vero E6 cells, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication 65 kinetics as SARS-CoV following a low dose infection. In contrast, we find that SARS-CoV-2 is 66 much more sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment as compared to SARS-CoV. Examining further, we 67 determined that SARS-CoV-2 induces STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG expression, which is 68 absent in SARS-CoV. These results suggest distinct changes between the CoVs in terms of IFN 69 antagonism and we subsequently examined sequence homology between the SARS-CoV and 70 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that may be responsible for these differences. Together, the results 71 suggest SARS-CoV-2 lacks the same capacity to control the IFN-I response as SARS-CoV. 72\n\nOur initial studies infected Vero E6 cells using a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) to 75 explore the viral replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV. Following infection, 76\n\nwe find that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar kinetics, peaking 48 hours 77 post infection (Fig. 1A) . While SARS-CoV-2 titer had slightly lower viral titers at 24 hours post 78 infection, the results were statistically different between the novel CoV and the original epidemic 79 strain. By 48 hours, replication of both viruses had plateaued and significant cytopathic effect 80 (CPE) was observed for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Together, the results 81 indicated that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar replication kinetics in Vero E6 82\n\nWe next evaluated the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to IFN-I pretreatment. Treatment 84 with IFN-I (recombinant IFN\u03b1) has been attempted as an antiviral approach for a wide variety of 85 pathogens including hepatitis B and C viruses as well as HIV 20 . During both the SARS and 86 MERS-CoV outbreaks, IFN-I has been employed with limited effect 21, 22 . In this study, we 87 pretreated Vero E6 cells with 1000 units of recombinant IFN-I (IFN-\u03b1) 18 hours prior to infection. 88\n\nVero E6 lack the capacity to produce IFN-I, but are able to respond to exogenous treatment 23 . 89 SARS-CoV-2 had massive 3-log (24 HPI) and 4-log (48 HPI) drops in viral titer as compared to 95 control untreated cells. Finally, we examined viral protein production finding a major deficit in 96 nucleocapsid protein production in IFN-I treated cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1C) . 97\n\nIn contrast, viral proteins were robustly expressed for SARS-CoV-2 in untreated cells and for 98 SARS-CoV in both conditions. Together, the results demonstrate a clear sensitivity to a primed 99 IFN-I response in SARS-CoV-2, which is not observed with SARS-CoV. 100 SARS-CoV-2 fails to attenuate STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG production. 101\n\nTo explore differences in IFN-I antagonism between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV, we examined 102 both STAT1 activation and IFN stimulated gene (ISG) expression following IFN pretreatment 103 and infection. Examining Vero cell protein lysates, we found that IFN-I treated cells infected with 104 SARS-CoV-2 induced phosphorylated STAT-1 by 48 hours post infection (Fig. 2) . STAT1 105 phosphorylation was absent in untreated cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and suggest the novel 106\n\nCoV is unable to inhibit a IFN-I preprimed response. In contrast, SARS-CoV had no evidence 107 for STAT1 phosphorylation in either IFN-I treated or untreated cells, illustrating robust control 108 over IFN-I induction pathways. Examining further, STAT1, IFIT2, and TRIM25, known ISGs 17 , 109 had increased protein expression in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection following IFN 110 pretreatment (Fig. 2) . Basal STAT1 and TRIM25 levels are reduced during SARS-CoV and 111 SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to control likely due to the mRNA targeting activity of non-112 structural protein 1 (NSP1) 24 . However, IFN-I treatment results in augmented protein levels for 113 both ISGs following SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to untreated control. In contrast, IFN 114 treated SARS-CoV had no significant increase in ISG protein relative to control infection. 115\n\nTogether, the STAT1 phosphorylation, ISG production, and viral protein levels indicate that 116 SARS-CoV-2 lacks the same capacity to modulate a primed type I IFN response as the original 117\n\nConsidering the sensitivity to IFN-I, we next sought to evaluate changes between SARS-CoV 120\n\nand SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Previous work has established several key IFN antagonist in 121 the SARS-CoV genome including NSP1, NSP3, ORF3b, ORF6, and others 25 . Therefore, we 122 .

For SARS-CoV structural proteins including the nucleocapsid 126 suggesting that IFN antagonism might be maintained in these specific group 2B CoV strains. In 140 addition, SARS-CoV ORF6 has been shown to be an IFN antagonist that disrupts karyopherin 141 transportation of transcriptions factors like STAT1 30,31 . In contrast to ORF3b, all five surveyed 142 group 2B CoVs maintain ORF6; however, SARS-CoV-2 had only 69% homology with SARS-143\n\nCoV while the other three group 2B bat CoVs had >90% conservation. Importantly, SARS-CoV-144 2 has a two amino acid truncation in its ORF6; previous work has found that alanine substitution 145 in this C-terminal of SARS-CoV ORF6 resulted in ablated antagonism 31 . Together, the 146 sequence homology analysis suggests that differences in NSP3, ORF3b, and/or ORF6 may be 147 key drivers of SARS-CoV-2 type I IFN susceptibility. 148 .

In this report, we describe differences in 151 the IFN-I sensitivity between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV. While both viruses 152 maintain similar replication in untreated Vero E6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 has a significant decrease 153 in viral protein and replication following IFN-I pretreatment. The decreased SARS-CoV-2 154\n\nreplication correlates with phosphorylation of STAT1 and augmented ISG expression largely 155 absent following SARS-CoV infection. This sensitivity to IFN-I is distinct from the original SARS-156\n\nCoV and suggests that the novel CoV has distinct host interactions driving disease outcomes. 157\n\nAnalysis of viral proteins finds SARS-CoV-2 has several changes that potentially impact its 158 capacity to modulate the type I IFN response, including loss of ORF3b and a short truncation of 159 ORF6, both known as IFN-I antagonists for SARS-CoV 30 . Together, our results suggest SARS-160\n\nCoV and SARS-CoV-2 have differences in their ability to antagonize the IFN-I response once 161 initiated and that they may have major implication for COVID-19 disease and treatment. Overall, the sequence analysis suggests that differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 202 viral proteins may drive attenuation in the context of type I IFN pretreatment. 203\n\nThe increased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 suggests utility in treatment using type I IFN.

While 224 initial work has suggested incompatibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice based on receptor 225 usage 8 , the type I IFN response may be a second major barrier that needs to be overcome. 226\n\nSimilar to the emergent Zika virus outbreak, the use of type I IFN receptor knockout mice or 227 type I IFN receptor blocking antibody may be necessary to develop a useful SARS-CoV-2 228 animal models for therapeutic testing 49 . 229\n\nOverall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher sensitivity to type I IFN 230 than the previously emergent SARS-CoV. This augmented type I IFN sensitivity is likely due to 231 changes in viral proteins between the two epidemic CoV strains. Moving forward, these data 232 could provide important insights for both the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 as well as developing 233 novel animal models of disease. In this ongoing outbreak, the results also highlight a distinction 234 between the highly related viruses and suggest insights from SARS-CoV must be verified for Thus, significant differences in viral titer were determined by the unpaired two-tailed students T-280 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.07.982264 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.07.982264 doi: bioRxiv preprint"}
