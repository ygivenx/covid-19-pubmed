The number of laboratory confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus is increasing and has been associated with high mortality rate. Our aim is to describe clinical features and outcome of patients infected with MERS CoV in a tertiary hospital outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nMethods. We reviewed the medical records of 30 patients with confirmed MERS CoV infections during hospital outbreak between April 7 until April 30, 2014. We followed WHO definitions for confirmed MERS CoV infection.\n\nResults. A total of 30 patients were diagnosed with confirmed MERS CoV infection. 16 patients were health care workers. The mean age was 43 years (SD 16.5). Seventeen patients were male (54.8%). Majority of patients N = 20 (66.7%) were symptomatic on presentation. Fever was the most presenting symptoms N = 20 (66.7%) followed by cough N = 18 (60%). Although only 10 patients (35.7%) reported shortness of breath on presentation, 27 patients (93.1%) had abnormal chest xary. In terms of laboratory findings, 13 patients (54.2%) had lymphopenia on presentation. Significant number of patients developed progressive respiratory disease; 9 patients (30%) required mechanical ventilation and 12 patients (38.7%) required ICU admission.\n\nConclusion.
