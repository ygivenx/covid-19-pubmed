{"title": "Special Considerations for Infants and Young Children", "body": "\u2022 After confounders and masqueraders of asthma have been excluded in the evaluation of children with suspected asthma, recurrent wheezing in infants and young children still comprises a heterogeneous group of conditions with different risk factors and prognoses.\n\n\u2022 The diagnosis of asthma in infants and small children is often based on clinical grounds and complicated by the lack of clinically available tools that meet the criteria for the definition of asthma used in older children and adults such as airway inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airflow limitation.\n\n\u2022 Difficulties in the management of asthma include limited effective and convenient delivery devices, complete dependence on the caregivers to carry out the treatment regimen, and an inadequate selection of medications completely devoid of adverse effects.\n\n\u2022 A partnership approach with emphasis on education, monitoring and training is key in the effective management of chronic cough or recurrent wheezing illnesses in very young children.\n\n\u2022 Clinical trials using as needed treatment interventions have shown favorable efficacy outcomes, aimed at preventing severe exacerbations in young children with recurrent wheezing; however, trials aimed at primary prevention are still lacking.\n\nThe prevalence of asthma has increased even in the last decade but a better understanding of the mechanisms of asthma and the availability of more effective treatment may be responsible for the stabilization of the steady increase in asthma morbidity and mortality noted since the 1980s. 1 From data in the recent National Surveillance of Asthma, 2 current asthma was reported in 6% of children between 0 and 4 years old, with at least two thirds having at least one asthma attack in the previous year. The most important reason why asthma in infants and younger children deserves special consideration is the fact that healthcare utilization (ambulatory, emergency department visits and inpatient hospital admissions) for children under the age of 4 years is greater than those of other age groups. 2 In addition, younger children with asthma are also more likely to be readmitted to the hospital for acute exacerbations. 3 In a retrospective analysis of 49 asthmatic children whose mean age was 5.2 years (range 2 months to 16 years) admitted to a community-based pediatric intensive care unit over a 10-year period, as many as 75% were 6 years or younger. 4 The public health consequences of dealing with asthma in children include the number of missed work days parents/guardians incur in order to care for an acutely ill child. Some studies have hinted that pulmonary development in infancy can be adversely affected by asthma, resulting in a decrease in lung function of approximately 20% by adulthood. 5 Relevant clinical practice guidelines developed in recent years have addressed special challenges in the management of asthma in this age group. 6, 7 Many issues are unique to this age group: identifying very young children with recurrent episodes of cough and wheeze associated with viral illnesses who will develop persistent asthma later in life, presence of confounding factors or disease masqueraders, who needs controller therapy and when to start treatment, what medications to use, how best to deliver the medications and how to monitor the response to treatment.\n\nRecurrent wheezing in infants and young children comprises a heterogeneous group of conditions with different risk factors and prognoses. Viral infections (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza and adenovirus) are common triggers of wheezing in preschool age children, even in those who will not develop persistent asthma later on. Factors or exposures early in life such as prematurity, fetal nutrition, duration of pregnancy, viral lower respiratory tract infections in the first years of life, cigarette smoke exposure, air pollution, postnatal nutrition, breastfeeding, family size, maternal age, socioeconomic status and allergen exposure have been implicated to varying degrees. Observational studies have also demonstrated an increased risk of asthma attributed to acetaminophen exposure during prenatal periods, infancy, childhood and even adulthood. [8] [9] [10] [11] Genetics, atopy and prematurity appear to be the most important host risk factors in the development of asthma.\n\nSeveral types of 'wheezers' in the young age group based on time of onset and outcome (transient or intermittent vs persistent) have been identified from longitudinal studies. 12, 13 The investigators from the Tucson Children's Respiratory Group wheezing episodes per year lasting more than 24 hours upon which initiation of controller therapy should be considered. 6 These wheezing phenotypes derived from epidemiologic and longitudinal data are more helpful for prognostication and usually have limited clinical utility when a medical provider is faced with a child with recurrent wheezing or chronic cough. Hence, other phenotypes may have greater relevance when management decisions have to be made or clinical trials are undertaken. For example, a symptom-based classification, i.e. episodic (wheeze only in discrete time periods, mostly associated with upper respiratory infection) vs multi-trigger (symptom also occurs with activity, laughing, crying or even at night outside of an acute illness), was proposed by the European Task Force in 2008. 20 However its clinical applicability is limited as children can switch between the two categories at different times, and this classification does not consider the frequency, seasonality and severity of the episodes. 21 A preschool child may have exercise-induced wheeze only when he/she is also having an acute episode or shortly after. During the late fall, winter and early spring in most areas in the northern hemisphere, preschool children who are in regular contact with other children can develop back to back viral respiratory illnesses that can each last up to 2 weeks or even longer. A child with a viral illness requiring a hospital admission is in the same classification as a child whose viral-induced wheezing illness is treated with a bronchodilator alone. Lastly, it is not known if there is a unique immunopathologic difference that can affect treatment between the two phenotypes. Therefore, clinical guidelines suggest starting treatment based on frequency of symptoms, severity of episodes and presence of risk factors.\n\nThe first practical consideration in approaching the wheezing child is to ensure that an alternative diagnosis is not present. In addition, infants and small children have a greater degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), which may predispose them to wheeze. 22 The differential diagnosis of wheezing in infants and young children includes conditions such as foreign body aspiration, structural airway anomalies, congenital lobar emphysema, abnormalities of the great vessels (e.g. vascular rings), congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, recurrent aspiration, immunodeficiency, infections, ciliary dyskinesia and mediastinal masses. Other clinical features, such as neonatal onset of symptoms, associated failure to thrive, diarrhea or vomiting, focal lung or cardiovascular findings, clubbing, constant wheezing, and hypoxemia outside of an acute illness, suggest an alternative diagnosis and require special investigations. Additional factors in addition to age at onset of symptoms that should be taken into consideration include triggers for the respiratory symptoms and aggravating conditions such as nighttime occurrences, environmental exposure, physical exertion, feeding, positioning and infections. Clearly, making the correct diagnosis is essential because the treatment for these conditions can vary substantially. For example, in children with significant gastroesophageal reflux, improvement in asthma symptoms with concomitant reduction in asthma medication use occurred after a prokinetic agent was instituted. 23 A practical approach that can be considered for a young child in whom asthma is strongly suspected is an empiric trial of asthma controller therapy while other evaluations are still being pursued (Figure 32-1) . enrolled over 1,000 newborns served by a large health maintenance organization to evaluate factors involved in early-onset wheezing in relationship to persistent wheezing at 6 years of life. 13 About half of the children had at least one episode of wheezing by 6 years of age. Nearly one third of the cohort had at least one episode of wheezing by 3 years of age. Only 40% of children who wheezed early had persistent wheezing at age 6 years. Of the total group, 20% had at least one episode of wheezing associated with a respiratory tract infection during the first 3 years of life but had no wheezing at 6 years ('transient wheezers'), 14% did not wheeze during the first 3 years of life but had wheezing at 6 years ('late-onset wheezers'), and 15% had wheezing at age 3 and 6 years ('persistent wheezers'). The 'transient wheezers' were more likely to have diminished airway function and a history of maternal smoking and were less likely to be atopic. The 'late-onset wheezers' had a similar percentage of atopic children to 'persistent wheezers' and were likely to have mothers with asthma. Hence, there seems to be a similar genetic predisposition for the asthma phenotype characterizing both 'persistent' and 'late-onset wheezers' . Essentially all of the current natural history studies have found that allergic disease and evidence of pro-allergic immune development are significant risk factors for persistent asthma.\n\nAn asthma predictive index (API) using a combination of clinical and easily obtainable laboratory data to help identify children age \u22643 years with a history of wheezing at risk of developing persistent asthma was developed from the Tucson cohort. 14 Information on parental asthma diagnosis and prenatal maternal smoking status was obtained at enrollment, while the child's history of asthma and wheezing and physiciandiagnosed allergic rhinitis or eczema, along with measurements of blood eosinophil count, were obtained at the follow-up visits. Two indices were used to classify the children. The stringent index required recurrent wheezing in the first 3 years plus one major (parental history of asthma or physician-diagnosed eczema) or two of three minor (eosinophilia, wheezing without colds, allergic rhinitis) risk factors, whereas the loose index required any episode of wheezing in the first 3 years plus one major or two of three minor risk factors. Children with a positive loose index were 2.6 to 5.5 times more likely to have active asthma sometime during the school years. In contrast, risk of asthma increased to 4.3 to 9.8 times when the stringent criteria were used. In addition, at least 90% of young children with a negative 'loose' or 'stringent' index will not develop 'active asthma' in the school age years.\n\nA modified version of the API (mAPI) incorporates inhalant allergen sensitization as an additional major risk factor and food allergen sensitization as an additional minor risk factor to take into account important findings from other longitudinal natural history asthma studies. 15 In the Berlin Multicentre Allergy Study, additional risk factors for asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity at age 7 years included persistent sensitization to foods (i.e. hen's egg, cow's milk, wheat and/or soy) and perennial inhalant allergens (i.e. dust mite, cat), especially in early life. 16, 17 In a prospective, randomized, controlled study of food allergen avoidance in infancy evaluating the development of atopy at age 7 years in a high-risk cohort, egg, milk and peanut allergen sensitization were risk factors for asthma. 18 With these additional considerations, an mAPI has been used in an early intervention study for young children with recurrent wheezing. 19 Henceforth, it has been adapted by the NAEPP EPR3 asthma guidelines as a requirement along with a history of four Initiate controller therapy if: Symptoms are persistent Four or more episodes of wheezing in the past year lasting more than a day in a child with risk factors for persistent asthma (positive asthma predictive index) History of at least two exacerbations in the past 6 months requiring systemic corticosteroids Close follow-up and initiate evaluations and/or referral to specialists Established asthma: evaluate control Impairment: assessment of the child's recent symptom frequency and intensity and functional limitations (i.e. nighttime awakenings, need for short-acting \u03b2-agonists for quick relief, work/school days missed, ability to engage in normal or desired activities, and quality of life assessments) and airflow compromise using preferably spirometry in older children Risk: frequency and severity of exacerbations: reduced lung function growth for children 5 years and older: monitor medication adverse effects Uncontrolled asthma: More than twice a week of daytime symptoms or rescue bronchodilator use; more than once a month of nocturnal symptoms; report of activity limitation; evidence of airflow limitation for older children; more than one exacerbation per year 25 and an expert local panel of subspecialists were sent to 862 active members of the Massachusetts American Academy of Pediatrics. Over 80% of the respondents rated five factors as necessary or important in establishing the diagnosis of asthma: recurrent wheezing, symptomatic improvement following bronchodilator use, presence of recurrent cough, exclusion of other diagnoses, and suggestive peak expiratory flow rate findings. Of note, 27% of the respondents indicated that a child had to be older than 2 years; 18% indicated that fever must be absent during an exacerbation. The diagnosis of asthma in young children is based largely on clinical judgment and an assessment of symptoms and physical findings. The following characteristics are suggestive of asthma: wheezing or recurrent or persistent nonproductive cough or difficult breathing that may be worse at night or occurring with exercise, laughing, crying or exposure to tobacco smoke in the absence of a respiratory infection; reduced activity or interest in running or playing compared to other children with easy fatigability during walks; presence of other personal allergic diseases (atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis) or family history of asthma in first degree relatives; and response to either therapeutic trial of a corticosteroid or a short-acting bronchodilator as needed. 7 Because lung function measurements in infants and small children are difficult to obtain, a trial of treatment is often a practical way to make a diagnosis of asthma in young children.\n\nAt present, for adults and older children, easily performed lung function measures and noninvasive markers of airway inflammation can be used to make the diagnosis of asthma, monitor asthma control or guide therapeutic decisions. The following section will highlight available procedures and techniques with the potential to measure lung function and airway inflammation in the young child.\n\nForced oscillometry is a pulmonary function technique that measures respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) at several frequencies. It involves the application of sine waves through a loudspeaker to the airway opening via a mouthpiece, through which the subject breathes normally for short periods of time. Measurements are carried out during tidal breathing over a 30-second interval with at least three efforts recorded. Given its relative ease of use, it is a reproducible and suitable measure of lung function in younger children. 26 Marotta et al performed pre-and post-bronchodilator spirometry and forced oscillometry in young children at risk for asthma and found no difference in baseline FEV 1 or resistance between children with asthma versus those without; the degree of bronchodilator response differentiated the two groups. 27 Some investigators believe that reactance at low frequencies is a reflection of peripheral airways function. 28 Using three different lung function measures, Nielsen and Bisgaard evaluated the bronchodilator response of 92 children 2 to 5 years old, 55 of whom had asthma. 29 Children with asthma had diminished lung function compared to nonasthmatic children using any of the following measures: specific airway resistance (sRaw) utilizing whole body plethysmography, or respiratory resistance utilizing either an interrupter technique (Rint) or impulse oscillation technique at 5 Hz (Rrs5). Both asthmatic and nonasthmatic children responded to terbutaline, although children with asthma reversed to a greater extent than the nonasthmatic children. The investigators found that sRaw utilizing body plethysmography best distinguished asthmatics from nonasthmatics based on bronchodilator response. They concluded that assessment of bronchodilator responsiveness using sRaw may help define asthma in young children.\n\nAs with measurements of airflow limitation, procedures to assess BHR in infants and young children have distinctive challenges. Measurement of BHR using cold air (4 minutes of isocapneic hyperventilation) or dry air (6 minutes of eucapneic hyperventilation) challenge with sRaw as an outcome may be useful, practical alternatives to auscultatory pharmacologic or exercise bronchoprovocation challenges which are more difficult to standardize in young children. 30 Using a dry air challenge, magnitude of response was associated with a wheeze phenotype. Persistent wheezers had a larger increase in sRaw following eucapneic hyperventilation challenge compared with never wheezers, but no significant differences between never wheezers, late-onset or transient wheezers were seen. 31 \n\nExhaled nitric oxide (eNO) levels are elevated in patients with asthma 32 and correlate positively with eosinophilic airway inflammation. 33 In addition, they rise during acute exacerbations 34 and fall following oral or inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy. 35, 36 Online 37 and offline 38 eNO measurements can be reliably obtained in very young children. Reference values using an offline tidal breathing method in healthy preschool children have recently been published. 39 Higher mean (\u00b1SEM) eNO concentrations (14.1 \u00b1 1.8 ppb) were found in infants and young children (age 7 to 33 months) presenting with an acute wheeze and a history of at least three prior wheezing episodes compared to first-time viral wheezers (age 9 to 14 months) (8.3 \u00b1 1.3 ppb, P < .05) and healthy matched controls (5.6 \u00b1 0.5 ppb, P < .001). No differences in eNO measurements were seen between the last two groups. In addition, eNO levels were reduced by 52% after steroid therapy to a level comparable to those of the healthy controls and first-time wheezers. 38 Unlike sophisticated measures of lung function and BHR, eNO can be easily and quickly measured. An elevated eNO in preschool age children has been shown to predict asthma in school age. 40 In one of the few studies designed specifically to address the role of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in young children with recurrent wheezing, Carlsen et al 41 found a strong correlation between serum ECP and response to albuterol/salbutamol using the tidal flow volume loop technique in children 0 to 2 years of age. These investigators suggested that ECP may be measuring airway inflammation and may have some prognostic value in diagnosing asthma in infants and toddlers with recurrent wheezing. The major drawback for ECP is its lack of sensitivity and blood sample collection.\n\nAlthough direct investigation of the airway using bronchoscopy and biopsy is the gold standard for establishing airway short-acting \u03b2 2 -agonists for quick relief, and ability to engage in normal or desired activities. Risk refers to an evaluation of the child's likelihood of developing asthma exacerbations. Of note, in the absence of frequent symptoms, 'persistent' asthma should be considered and therefore long-term controller therapy initiated for infants or children who have risk factors for asthma (i.e. using the mAPI: any of parental history of asthma, physician-diagnosed atopic dermatitis, or sensitization to aeroallergens OR two of the following: wheezing apart from colds, sensitization to foods, or peripheral eosinophilia) AND four or more episodes of wheezing over the past year that lasted longer than 1 day and affected sleep OR two or more exacerbations within 6 months requiring systemic corticosteroids.\n\nIn the most recent iteration of the GINA global strategy, 7 much emphasis is devoted to a 'shared-care approach' using an effective patient-healthcare provider partnership that has been shown to improve outcomes, and the process of 'assess, adjust treatment, and review response' . Eliciting specific goals of treatment from caregivers and providing education are key elements in this partnership. The process of assessing (diagnosis, symptom control, risk factors, inhaler technique, adherence and parent preference), adjusting treatment (medications, nonpharmacological strategies and treatment of modifiable risk factors), and reviewing response (medication effectiveness and sideeffects) is recommended on an ongoing basis.\n\nBased on the NAEPP EPR3 guidelines, 6 upon establishing a diagnosis of asthma in young children, initiation of controller therapy is warranted for persistent asthma. The most important determinant of dosing is the clinician's judgment of the patient's presenting degree of severity. Initiation of long-term controller therapy should also be considered for infants and younger children who have risk factors for asthma (i.e. modified asthma predictive index: parental history of asthma, physiciandiagnosed atopic dermatitis or sensitization to aeroallergens or two of the following: wheezing apart from colds, sensitization to foods or peripheral eosinophilia) and four or more episodes of wheezing over the past year that lasted longer than 1 day and affected sleep or two or more exacerbations in 6 months requiring systemic corticosteroids.\n\nMedication dose adjustment is appropriate based on levels of asthma control, although dose-response relationships are not well studied. For preschool children already on a controller medication, management is tailored based on the child's level of control. As with the classification of asthma severity, assessment of asthma control is based on both impairment and risk (Table 32 -2). The three levels of asthma control are 'well controlled' , 'not well controlled' and 'very poorly controlled' . Children whose asthma is not well controlled have daytime symptoms or need for rescue albuterol >2 days/week, nighttime symptoms more than once a month but not more than once a week, 'some limitation' with normal activity, had two to three exacerbations in the past year, and an FEV 1 of 60-80% of predicted (or FEV 1 /FVC ratio 75-80%) for children 5 years of age or older. Children with very poorly controlled asthma have symptoms 'throughout the day' , nocturnal symptoms more than once weekly, need for rescue albuterol several times per day, 'extreme limitations' with normal activity, had \u22653 exacerbations in the past year, and for children at least aged 5 years, an inflammation, it has limited clinical applicability, except when other pulmonary abnormalities are being considered. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology of the disease in children is critical in order to identify processes that can be impacted by interventions. Thickening of the bronchial epithelial reticular basement membrane (RBM) and eosinophilic airway inflammation are characteristic pathologic features of asthma found in children as young as 3 years old, but typically occurring between the ages of 6 to 16 years. 42 It is unclear when airway thickening begins since routine biopsy studies are not performed in infants. 43 Studies on bronchoalveolar lavages obtained from wheezing infants and preschool children revealed an overall increase in airway inflammation, though it is rarely eosinophilic. In one study in which bronchial biopsies were performed on symptomatic infants, there was no consistent relationship between RBM thickening and inflammation, clinical symptoms and variable airflow obstruction, 44 similar to findings from biopsy studies in older school aged children with asthma. 45 The use of sensitive, noninvasive physiologic and biologic markers is very limited in the clinical evaluation of young children with asthma and recurrent wheezing.\n\nThe goals of asthma management are not different between older children and preschool aged children -to attain good symptom control and allow normal activity levels, reduce exacerbations, optimize lung function and minimize medication side-effects. Available asthma guidelines such as the National Asthma Education Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 (NAEPP EPR3) 6 and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update 2014 report 7 acknowledge the special challenges unique to the management of asthma in preschool children; hence a specific approach and treatment recommendations for preschool children with asthma are presented. Both sets of guidelines emphasize maintenance of asthma control as the goal for asthma management and use of ICS as the preferred therapy for persistent asthma. A comprehensive management is outlined in several components and/or sections and generally includes: establishment of patient/doctor partnership and provision of education to enhance the patient's/family's knowledge and skills for self-management (appropriate use of devices and medications); identification and management of risk and precipitating factors and co-morbid conditions that may worsen asthma; adequate assessment and monitoring of disease activity (including symptom monitoring by parent/caregiver); appropriate selection of medications to address the patient's needs; and management of asthma exacerbations (with provision of a written asthma action plan). The details of each of these elements are discussed in Chapter 29.\n\nKey differences between the two clinical guidelines are apparent. The approach implemented by the NAEPP EPR3 on starting controller therapy is based on the concept of asthma severity, which is the intrinsic intensity of disease and applicable for patients not receiving controller therapy. The guidelines have a separate set of criteria for various age groups and Table  32 -1 summarizes the classification of asthma severity for children 0 to 4 years old. The classification of asthma severity is contingent upon the domains of impairment and risk and the level of severity is based on the most severe impairment or risk component. Impairment includes an assessment of the child's recent symptom frequency (daytime and nighttime), need for Children with severe persistent asthma (Treatment Steps 5 and 6) should receive high-dose ICS, a LABA or montelukast, and an oral corticosteroid, if required. A rescue course of systemic corticosteroids may be necessary at any step.\n\nThe 'step-up, step-down' approach initially introduced in the earlier versions of the NAEPP guidelines 21 and slightly modified in the current iteration 6 is discussed in further detail in Chapter 29. The NAEPP guidelines emphasize initiating higher-level controller therapy at the outset to establish prompt control, with measures to 'step down' therapy once good asthma control is achieved. Initially, airflow limitation and the pathology of asthma may limit the delivery and efficacy of ICS such that stepping up to higher doses and/or combination therapy may be needed to gain asthma control. Asthma therapy can be stepped down after good asthma control has been achieved and ICS has had time to achieve optimal efficacy, by determining the least number or dose of daily controller medications that can maintain good control, thereby reducing the potential for medication adverse effects. If step-up therapy is being considered at any point, it is important to check delivery device technique and adherence, implement environmental control measures and identify and treat co-morbid conditions.\n\nThe GINA 2014 global strategy also now offers a stepwise approach in the long-term management of asthma in very young children. 7 However, if control is still inadequate despite 3 months of controller therapy, the following should be addressed before any step-up treatment is offered: that any FEV 1 of <60% of predicted or FEV 1 /FVC ratio <75%. Using a validated questionnaire to monitor quality of life for older children is recommended and perhaps the TRACK questionnaire 42 discussed in a subsequent section may now be applied in younger children.\n\nThe NAEPP EPR3 provides an expanded stepwise treatment approach (Figure 32-2) even for young children. The choice of initial therapy is based on assessment of asthma severity. For patients who are already on controller therapy, modification of treatment is based on assessment of asthma control and responsiveness to therapy. A major objective of this approach is to identify and treat all 'persistent' and uncontrolled asthma with antiinflammatory controller medication. Management of intermittent asthma is short-acting inhaled \u03b2-agonist as needed for symptoms and for pre-treatment for those with exerciseinduced bronchospasm (Step 1). The type(s) and amount(s) of daily controller medications to be used are determined by the asthma severity and control rating. Even for young children, the preferred treatment for 'persistent asthma' is daily ICS therapy, with or without an additional medication. Alternative medications for Step 2 include a leukotriene receptor antagonist (montelukast) or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent (cromolyn). For young children (\u22644 years of age) with moderate and severe persistent asthma, medium-dose ICS monotherapy is recommended and combination therapy of medium-dose ICS plus either a long-acting \u03b2-agonist (LABA) or montelukast is to be initiated only as a Step 4 treatment for uncontrolled asthma. \u2022 The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision-making required to meet individual patient needs. \u2022 Level of severity is determined by both impairment and risk. Assess impairment domain by patient's/caregiver's recall of previous 2-4 weeks.\n\nSymptom assessment for longer periods should reflect a global assessment such as inquiring whether a patient's asthma is better or worse since the last visit. Assign severity to the most severe category in which any feature occurs. \u2022 At present, there are inadequate data to correspond frequencies of exacerbations with different levels of asthma severity. For treatment purposes, patients who had \u22652 exacerbations requiring oral systemic corticosteroids in the past 6 months, or \u22654 wheezing episodes in the past year, and who have risk factors for persistent asthma may be considered the same as patients who have persistent asthma, even in the absence of impairment levels consistent with persistent asthma. EIB - Exercise-induced bronchospasm; SABA - short-acting \u03b2 2 -agonist use. high-dose ICS therapy given at the onset of a respiratory illness is further demonstrated to be as beneficial as maintenance therapy with ICS in children with recurrent wheezing and with risk factors for persistent asthma. 48 Because it has the potential to cause side-effects if given quite often during the year at higher doses, this should be considered for families who are able to use this intervention responsibly.\n\nStep 2 treatment is recommended for young children with symptom pattern consistent with asthma and not well controlled or with 3 or more exacerbations per year or with frequent wheezing episodes occurring every 6 to 8 weeks. Similar to the NAEPP EPR3 recommendation are the preferred medication using daily low-dose ICS (for at least 3 months trial) and the alternative option using a leukotriene receptor antagonist, but GINA 2014 global strategy now also includes intermittent ICS for Step 2 as an alternate option. The National Institute of Health sponsored AsthmaNet is currently undertaking a clinical trial comparing these three treatments in young children with persistent asthma. Preferred\n\nStep 3 treatment is double 'low-dose' ICS, indicated for children with established asthma not well controlled on low-dose ICS. The alternative option is low-dose ICS with a leukotriene receptor antagonist. The highest step (Step 4) basically proposes a referral to a specialist for expert advice. Additional options other possible alternative or confounding condition is entertained; assessment of inhaler technique; adherence is acceptable; and exposure to allergens or tobacco smoke is avoided. The criteria for 'well controlled' , 'partly controlled' and 'uncontrolled' asthma according to the GINA global strategy are summarized in Table 32 -3, based on a 4-week recall. 'Well-controlled' asthma is characterized by at most daytime symptoms once a week, rescue/reliever treatment less than 2 times a week, absence of any activity limitation due to asthma, and no nocturnal cough or awakenings. 'Partly controlled' asthma has one to two of the following: \u22652 daytime symptoms a week, \u22652 rescue bronchodilator use, any nocturnal cough/awakenings, or limitations of activities. Lastly, 'uncontrolled' asthma is defined as presence of three or all features characteristic of 'partly controlled' asthma present in any week or exacerbation occurring once in any week.\n\nThe stepwise approach in the GINA 2014 global strategy has important differences from the NAEPP EPR3 6, 7 (Table 32-4) . For Step 1 which recommends as needed short-acting \u03b2-agonist as the preferred controller choice for children with infrequent viral wheezing, with few or no interval symptoms, intermittent inhaled corticosteroid therapy is an alternative option if shortacting \u03b2-agonist treatment is not enough. 46 \u2022 The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision-making required to meet individual patient needs.\n\n\u2022 The level of control is based on the most severe impairment or risk category. Assess impairment domain by caregiver's recall of previous 2 to 4 weeks. Symptom assessment for longer periods should reflect a global assessment such as inquiring whether the patient's asthma is better or worse since the last visit. \u2022 At present, there are inadequate data to correspond frequencies of exacerbations with different levels of asthma control. In general, more frequent and intense exacerbations (e.g. requiring urgent, unscheduled care, hospitalization or ICU admission) indicate poorer disease control. For treatment purposes, patients who had \u22652 exacerbations requiring oral systemic corticosteroids in the past year may be considered the same as patients who have not-well-controlled asthma, even in the absence of impairment levels consistent with not-well-controlled asthma. \u2022 Before step-up therapy:\n\n\u2022 Review adherence to medications, inhaler technique and environmental control.\n\n\u2022 If alternative treatment option was used in a step, discontinue it and use preferred treatment for that step. Assessing Asthma Control and Adjusting Therapy in Children Aged 0 to 4 Years (ACT) for children 12 years of age and older, and the Childhood ACT (cACT) for children 4 to 11 years of age are examples of self-administered questionnaires that have been developed and validated with the objective of addressing multiple domains of asthma control such as frequency of daytime and nocturnal symptoms, use of reliever medications, functional status, missed school or work and so on. 49, 50 Recently, a five-item caregiveradministered instrument, the Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (TRACK), is the first of its kind to have been validated as a tool to assess asthma control in young children with recurrent wheezing or respiratory symptoms consistent with asthma. 51 This questionnaire includes an assessment of both impairment and risk reflected in the NAEPP EPR3 asthma management guidelines. 6 The items include four impairment questions (three on symptom burden and activity limitations over a 4-week period and one on rescue medication use over a 3-month period) and one risk question on oral corticosteroid use over a 12-month period. Each item has five descriptive ordinal responses which can be scored over a 5-point scale (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20; total score range 0-100). The screening ability of the entire scale showed areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.88 and 0.82, respectively, in the development and validation samples, with a include adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist, theophylline or a low-dose oral corticosteroid (for a few weeks only) until control improves, increasing the dose or frequency of ICS delivery or adding intermittent ICS to regular daily ICS, particularly if exacerbations are the main concern. Through all these, the process of assessing, adjusting treatment and reviewing response should be actively enforced. Regular assessment of symptom control and risk of exacerbations, inhaler technique, adherence and parents' understanding and preference should be undertaken. The need for controller therapy should be evaluated and treatment should be adjusted as symptoms in this age group may remit at certain times of the year or even over time. Once therapy is discontinued, a close follow-up within 3 to 6 weeks is ideal, and caregivers should be provided with a written asthma action plan that incorporates early warning signs of worsening asthma control and what to do or who to contact when the child's condition deteriorates.\n\nMonitoring disease activity and response to therapy can be assessed using validated instruments.

Little is known regarding the amount of drug delivered, by any inhaled device and with any drug, to infants and young children with asthma. ICS have the potential for adverse effects, so it is important to deliver the smallest amount of drug required for response. Agertoft et al evaluated the systemic availability and pharmacokinetics of nebulized budesonide in a group of preschool children (mean age 4.7 years) with chronic asthma. 57 Ten children underwent pharmacokinetic studies of both intravenously administered (125 \u00b5g) and inhaled budesonide (1 mg delivered by nebulization). The amount of nebulized budesonide delivered to the patient was calculated by subtracting the amount of drug remaining in the nebulizer, the amount emitted into the ambient air, and the amount found in the mouth after rinsing from the initial amount of budesonide in the nebulizer (the nominal dose). The mean dose to the subject was found to be 23% of the nominal dose (231 \u00b5g), while the systemic availability was only 6.1% of the nominal dose, or 61 \u00b5g. The clearance of budesonide was calculated to be 0.54 L/min with a t 1/2 of 2.3 hours, and V dss of 55 L. The systemic availability in these small children was approximately half that seen in adults. In addition, the clearance of budesonide in these children was twice that of adults. Recommended doses of different ICS formulations for children 5 years and younger according to low, medium and high doses in the NAEPP EPR3 and low-dose formulations in the GINA 2014 global strategy are shown in Table 32 -5. 6, 7 What type of patient will respond favorably to ICS in this age group is an important question that has yet to be answered. A study by Roorda et al using data from two large placebocontrolled studies evaluated the clinical features of preschool children likely to respond to fluticasone administered via a diagnostic accuracy of 81% and 78%, respectively. Based on the highest area under the ROC curve, a score of less than 80 provided the best cut-off between sensitivity and specificity for uncontrolled asthma for this group. The pediatric version of the Asthma Control Test (cACT) has been validated for children as young as 4 years of age.\n\nThe GINA 2014 global strategy assessment of asthma control is discussed in an earlier section and summarized in Table 32 -3.\n\nICS are the preferred controller therapy for persistent asthma or asthma that is not controlled. Although there are six ICS available, nebulized budesonide is the only US Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ICS for children less than 4 years of age. The initial studies with nebulized budesonide in young children with moderate to severe persistent asthma found it to be superior to placebo in improving symptoms, decreasing exacerbations, reducing chronic oral prednisone use or improving overall asthma control. 52, 53 Studies have also evaluated the efficacy and safety of nebulized budesonide in children with mild to moderate persistent asthma. [54] [55] [56] The efficacy of nebulized budesonide over placebo was consistently demonstrated with improvement in symptom scores, reduction in rescue medication use and improvement in morning peak expiratory flow rates in patients who could adequately perform the procedure. Improvement in symptom scores occurred as early as 2 weeks after starting budesonide. 56 Twice-daily dosing of 0.5 mg appeared to be somewhat more effective than 1 mg administered once daily. The investigators suggested that a dose of 0.25 mg/day may be sufficient for mild asthma, whereas subjects with moderate asthma should be treated with 0.5 to 1 mg/day and those with severe asthma dependent on oral steroids should be treated with 1-2 mg/day. No significant differences in basal cortisol levels or \n\nEstimated Comparative Inhaled Corticosteroid Doses dose, and conventional asthma therapy consisted of any available therapy including ICS in two of the studies; in total, 670 children participated. The investigators found a modest impairment in growth in only one of the three extension studies. The extension study where a decline in growth was noted consisted primarily of young children with milder asthma who had not been on ICS before entry into the initial study. In contrast, the two extension studies that did not find growth impairment consisted of children with more severe disease and had allowed for ICS use as part of the conventional asthma therapy algorithm. The Skoner study suggests that modest growth suppression can occur in young children receiving nebulized budesonide who have not required ICS therapy in the past and that children with milder asthma may be at greater risk for growth suppression secondary to increased intrapulmonary deposition. Alternatively, the findings may be attributable to the fact that over twice as many children randomized to the conventional asthma therapy arm withdrew from the study because of poor asthma control.\n\nThe PEAK and IFWIN studies which used ICS via MDI with a holding chamber and mask have also provided important findings on the adverse effects of long-term ICS on growth in preschool children at risk for persistent asthma. 19, 63, 64 It is still uncertain if there is a potential for catch up or if the effects in very young children are cumulative. A follow-up study of PEAK participants 2 years after the clinical trial was completed showed no difference in growth between children who were on active ICS therapy compared to those who were randomized to placebo. 64 However, in a post hoc analysis, lower growth velocity was found among participants who were younger and weighed less, probably due to a relatively greater drug exposure. For young children with poor asthma control, the disease itself can negatively impact growth. The growth of 58 children (mean age 3.5 years for males, 4.4 years for females) with asthma was followed over a 5-year period. 65 Each child's asthma was classified as being in good, moderate or poor control according to asthma symptoms during a 2-year observational period before the institution of ICS therapy. The group as a whole had diminished growth velocity to start the study, with a mean height velocity standard deviation (HVSD) score of \u22120.51. Children whose asthma was in good control had the least evidence for growth suppression before ICS therapy was instituted and continued to grow at the same rate as when on therapy (HVSD score \u22120.01 pre-vs \u22120.07 during treatment). In contrast, the subjects whose asthma was poorly controlled grew poorly before and after institution of ICS therapy (HVSD score \u22121.50 pre-vs \u22121.55 during treatment). Of interest, those with moderately controlled asthma demonstrated improved growth velocity while on ICS therapy, with their HVSD score increasing from \u22120.83 to \u22120.49. The investigators concluded that poor asthma control adversely impacts linear growth to a greater extent than ICS therapy.\n\nThe NHLBI NAEPP EPR3 guidelines recommend cromolyn or montelukast as alternative therapy for younger children with mild persistent asthma and combination therapy using ICS plus either LABA or montelukast for younger children with moderate to severe persistent asthma (Steps 4 and 5). 6 GINA 2014 global strategy recommends leukotriene receptor antagonist or increased or intermittent ICS therapy as alternative options for Step 2 and add-on options for Steps 3 and 4. 7 pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) with holding chamber and facemask. 58 The investigators identified two clinical features that predicted a positive response to ICS therapy -frequent symptoms (\u22653 days/week) and a family history of asthma. The presence of eczema and the number of previous acute exacerbations were not associated with response to fluticasone. Eczema predisposes a child with recurrent wheezing to subsequent asthma, 14 but it does not appear to predict response to ICS therapy. It should be noted that a lack of response over a short course of treatment (12 weeks) does not necessarily mean that a response would not be seen over a much longer period of time (months to years). An NHLBI-sponsored AsthmaNet clinical trial which will be completed in 2015 is evaluating predictors of response to different interventions, specifically daily vs intermitting ICS therapy vs leukotriene receptor antagonist, in preschool aged children with persistent asthma. 59 The clinical efficacy and safety of intermittent ICS or systemic corticosteroid for young children with associated upper respiratory infection or viral induced wheeze remain controversial. A 2009 study which evaluated 'as needed' high-dose fluticasone propionate (750 \u00b5g twice daily) given at the onset of an upper respiratory tract illness found lower rescue oral corticosteroid use in those on active treatment compared to placebo (8% vs 18%, respectively); however this was accompanied by a statistically significant difference in height and weight gain. 46 In another 2009 study, oral prednisolone was found not to be superior to placebo with respect to duration of hospitalization, clinician and parent symptom severity assessment, and hospital readmission for preschool children presenting to a hospital with viral-induced mild to moderate wheezing. 60 A 2011study which evaluated daily vs intermittent high-dose ICS therapy given at the onset of a respiratory illness in preschool aged children with recurrent wheezing and atopic risk factors found no difference between the two treatments with respect to prevention of severe exacerbations. 48 ICS and Growth in Small Children. Few published studies have evaluated the effects of ICS on the linear growth of preschool children. Reid et al, in an open-label study, measured linear growth velocity in 40 children (mean age 1.4 years) before and during treatment with nebulized budesonide. 61 All of the children had 'troublesome' asthma despite treatment with an ICS administered with a pMDI with spacer and facemask or nebulized cromolyn before entry into the study. They were then administered 1 to 4 mg/day of nebulized budesonide depending on their level of asthma severity. The median intervals of time for linear growth determinations during the run-in period and nebulized budesonide treatments were 6 months and 1 year, respectively. The height standard deviation scores (SDSs) for the group during the run-in period were \u22120.21, at baseline \u22120.46, and after at least 6 months of nebulized budesonide \u22120.17. Note that an SDS of less than 0 denotes impaired growth velocity. Thus the subjects were growing at less than an impaired rate before nebulized budesonide therapy, and the institution of nebulized budesonide did not result in further growth suppression. In fact, there was a trend toward improved growth velocity while on nebulized budesonide.\n\nSkoner et al 62 evaluated the growth of children enrolled in 52-week open-label extension studies of the three efficacy studies of budesonide. [54] [55] [56] The dose of budesonide was either 0.5 mg once or twice daily with a taper to the lowest tolerated the rate of asthma exacerbations by 31.9% compared with placebo. Montelukast delayed the median time to first exacerbation by approximately 2 months and the rate of ICS courses compared to placebo. 81 In another study, 220 children aged 2 to 14 years were randomized to receive either intermittent montelukast or placebo at the onset of asthma or upper respiratory tract infection symptoms for a minimum of seven days. 82 The montelukast group had 163 unscheduled health care resource utilizations for asthma compared with 228 in the placebo group (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.89). There was a nonsignificant reduction in specialist attendances and hospitalizations, duration of episode and \u03b2-agonist and prednisolone use. These studies suggest that intermittent or persistent therapy with montelukast for children with intermittent asthma symptoms is effective in reducing risk of exacerbations compared with placebo.\n\nLong-acting Inhaled \u03b2-Agonists. LABAs are the alternative add-on therapy for children and adults with moderate and severe persistent asthma. The GINA 2014 global strategy does not include LABAs as controller therapy in any of their stepwise algorithms for very young children. 7 They are not viewed as 'rescue' medications for acute episodes of bronchospasm, nor are they meant to replace inhaled antiinflammatory agents. Salmeterol has a prolonged onset of action with maximal bronchodilation approximately 1 hour following administration; formoterol has an onset of effect within minutes. Both medications have a prolonged duration of action of at least 12 hours. As such, they are especially well suited for patients with nocturnal asthma 83 and for individuals who require frequent use of short-acting \u03b2-agonist inhalations during the day to prevent exercise-induced asthma. 84 There is an added advantage to the use of these alternative therapies for preschool children who may deserve an extended bronchodilatory coverage for exercise because they are constantly active. Salmeterol via the Diskus\u2122 device is FDA approved for children as young as 4 years of age (50 \u00b5g blister every 12 hours), whereas formoterol delivered via the Aerolizer\u2122 is approved for use in children 6 years of age and older (12 \u00b5g capsule every 12 hours). Both LABAs are also available as combination pMDI with an ICS (salmeterol and fluticasone [Advair], budesonide and formoterol [Symbicort] , and mometasone and formoterol [Dulera]). Although LABAs combined with ICS are recommended for young children in Steps 4 to 6 of the NAEPP EPR3 guidelines (Figure 32-2) , they have limited application. 6 The Diskus\u2122 combination product is FDA approved down to 4 years of age but its use requires adequate inspiratory effort to get an optimal delivery of the dry powder. While the pMDI can be used with a holding chamber, it is not currently approved for children younger than 12 years of age. The efficacy and safety of LABA or combination products in younger children with asthma are still uncertain due to lack of studies.\n\nThe FDA has requested the manufacturers of LABAs to update their product information warning sections regarding an increase in severe asthma episodes associated with these agents. This action is in response to data showing an increased number of asthma-related deaths in patients receiving LABA therapy in addition to their usual asthma care as compared with patients not receiving LABAs.\n\nTreatment immediately prior to vigorous activity or exercise is usually effective. The combination of a SABA with either cromolyn or nedocromil is more effective than either drug Cromolyn. Cromolyn (Intal) inhibits mediator release from mast cells. It inhibits both the early-and late-phase pulmonary components of the allergic response following inhalation of an allergen in sensitized subjects. A few studies have shown no added benefit with the use of cromolyn over placebo in young children with more severe disease. [66] [67] [68] [69] Several efficacy studies that have found cromolyn to have beneficial effects were short-term trials and employed small numbers. 70, 71 A meta-analysis of 22 control studies evaluating cromolyn in childhood asthma found it no better than placebo. 72 A multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, 52- week, open-label study in preschool children found nebulized cromolyn (20 mg four times daily) (N = 335) to be inferior to nebulized budesonide suspension (0.5 mg daily) (N = 168) using several outcome parameters. 73 Children who received inhaled budesonide suspension had a reduced rate of asthma exacerbations per year, longer time to first asthma exacerbation and first use of additional long-term controller therapy; nearly doubled improvements in nighttime and daytime symptom scores by the second week of treatment; and lower use of rescue medications. Although there were no significant differences in the rates of hospitalization and emergency room visits between the two groups, significantly lower urgent care or unscheduled physician visits and oral corticosteroid use were found in children who received the ICS. However, mean height increases from baseline in children randomized to inhaled budesonide and inhaled cromolyn were 6.69 and 7.55 cm, respectively. This difference of 0.86 cm is similar to the difference in height measurements seen in other studies with ICS therapy after 1 year of treatment in both younger and older children. 19, 74, 75 Leukotriene Modifying Agents. Leukotrienes are potent proinflammatory mediators that induce bronchospasm, mucus secretion and airway edema. In addition, they may be involved in eosinophil recruitment into the asthmatic airway. 76 Leukotriene modifiers (synthesis inhibitor or receptor antagonist) have beneficial effects in terms of reducing asthma symptoms and supplemental \u03b2-agonist use while improving baseline pulmonary function. [77] [78] [79] The leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) prevent the binding of LTD 4 to its receptor. This class has a pediatric indication and includes both montelukast (given once daily; has been approved for treatment of chronic asthma for children age 1 year and older) and zafirlukast (administered twice daily; approved for children 7 years and older).\n\nSafety and efficacy studies with the 4-mg chewable montelukast tablet in children aged 2 to 5 years with asthma have been published. [80] [81] [82] Almost 700 children 2 to 5 years of age were enrolled to receive montelukast or placebo for 12 weeks in a double-blind, multicenter, multinational study at 93 centers worldwide. 80 Montelukast was well tolerated and was not associated with any significant adverse effects. Montelukast was superior to placebo in reducing daytime symptoms including improvements in cough, wheeze, difficulty breathing and activity level, and nighttime cough. In addition, montelukast therapy was associated with a reduction in rescue \u03b2-agonist use and reduced need for prednisone for acute severe exacerbations.\n\nStudies have been done to evaluate the long-term effects of an LTRA (continuous 81 and intermittent 82 ) on the occurrence of exacerbations in young children. In a 12-month, doubleblind, parallel study which was designed to investigate the role of montelukast in the prevention of viral induced asthma exacerbations in children aged 2 to 5 years with a history of intermittent asthma symptoms, montelukast significantly reduced technique, cooperation and convenience determine which delivery may be best.\n\nAsthma clinical guidelines mention the use of inhaled shortacting \u03b2-agonist either by pMDI or nebulizer as an initial asthma exacerbation home intervention. 6, 7 The GINA global strategy recommends the use of short-acting inhaled \u03b2-agonist by pMDI (ideally with a spacer) for home management of mild, moderate and severe exacerbations. GINA also recommends nebulized treatments for severe exacerbations at home and for hospital-based management of acute asthma. 7 Data in young children clearly support the use of \u03b2-agonists, at higher doses, administered via a pMDI with spacer for acute asthma. 88, 89 In a study of 60 children between 1 and 5 years of age hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation, Parkin et al found salbutamol (400 to 600 \u00b5g, 4 to 6 puffs, based on weight) and ipratropium bromide (40 \u00b5g, 2 puffs), both delivered via pMDI with an Aerochamber and mask, to be as effective as nebulized salbutamol (0.15 mg/kg) and ipratropium bromide (125 \u00b5g) administered over 15 minutes by facemask. 88 However, nearly one third of the subjects randomized to MDI eventually required a nebulized \u03b2-agonist.\n\nTwo studies have evaluated lower respiratory tract deposition of a radiolabeled salbutamol/albuterol mixture administered to young children. Tal et al showed that on average, less than 2% of the nominal dose of the albuterol given by a pMDI with a spacer and mask to children less than 5 years old was deposited in the lower respiratory tract with most of the drug remaining in the spacer. 90 Wildhaber et al compared the lung deposition of radiolabeled salbutamol from a nebulizer and a pMDI and spacer in 17 asthmatic children aged 2 to 9 years. 91 Both devices were delivering roughly 5% of the nominal dose to the lower airways. Because of the larger doses of salbutamol administered via the nebulizer (2,000 \u00b5g vs 400 \u00b5g) than the pMDI, a larger amount of drug was deposited in the airways using the nebulizer (108 \u00b5g vs 22 \u00b5g, respectively). In addition, both devices were approximately 50% less efficient in children less than 4 years old than in older children.\n\nIn general, \u03b2-agonist administration by nebulization is still probably a more practical delivery system for most infants and young children with severe acute asthma because it requires the simple technique of relaxed tidal breathing, particularly if it is difficult to use a tight fitting spacer and mask for a pMDI. In addition, oxygen can be used to power the nebulizer, providing \u03b2-agonist and supplemental oxygen simultaneously, and it does offer the capability to administer a controller agent and rescue \u03b2-agonist at the same time.\n\nWith respect to controller therapy, the only available inhaled drugs that are FDA approved for children under 4 years of age are cromolyn solution and budesonide suspension intended for nebulization. However, a pMDI with a spacer device is certainly more convenient and easier to administer. The GINA global strategy prefers the administration of ICS via a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) with a spacer and either a facemask (for 0 to 3 years of age) or a mouthpiece (for \u22654 years old) for young children with asthma but the dose delivered is variable between spacers. 7 These guidelines mention the use of nebulizers as an alternative delivery system for children who are unable to use the spacer device effectively. Since young children are only expected to perform tidal breathing, the optimal number of breaths to empty the spacer device varies with the tidal volume, dead space and volume of the device. Important measures to maximize delivery of medication to very young alone. Montelukast may be effective for up to 24 hours. Salmeterol and formoterol may block exercise-induced bronchospasm for up to 12 hours. There is one study that has evaluated single-dose bronchoprotective effects of salmeterol given through a Babyhaler spacer device using a methacholine provocation challenge in infants less than 4 years old with recurrent episodes of wheezing. 85 Originally 42 preschool children (age range 8 to 45 months) received one of the 25-, 50-or 100-\u00b5g dose of salmeterol and a placebo dose 2 to 7 days apart in a double-blind, randomized fashion, but only 33 completed the study. The investigators found a dose-dependent bronchoprotective effect of salmeterol measured by treatment/placebo methacholine dose ratios. Significant improvements from placebo were found only for the 50 (2.5 fold) and 100 (fourfold) \u00b5g doses.\n\nThere are unique challenges relating to the delivery of medications (both oral and inhaled) to infants and young children with asthma. Obviously, liquid preparations are tolerated by infants but chewable tablets/pills can already be consumed by toddlers. Montelukast is available as oral granules or chewable tablet and prednisone/prednisolone comes in either liquid formulations or orally disintegrating tablet preparations. With regard to inhaled medications, certain anatomic and physiologic characteristics of children younger than 6 years are worth considering. First, because infants display preferential nasal breathing and have small airways, low tidal volume and high respiratory frequency, delivery of the drug to the lower airways is often inadequate. 86 Second, it is difficult if not impossible for young children to perform the maneuvers specified for optimal delivery of aerosol therapy such as slow inhalation through the mouth with a period of breath-holding for pMDIs or rapid and forceful inhalation required in the case of dry-powder inhalers (DPIs). Third, delivery devices appropriate for the young child are limited to those that require minimum cooperation from the child and must allow ease of administration for the caregivers. Although at present there are at least three inhaled aerosol delivery systems available for older children and adults, only two are used in this age group: the nebulizer and the pMDI with spacer/holding chamber and facemask. Because of the reliance on the subject's ability to generate a sufficient inspiratory flow and overcome the resistance required of DPIs, preschool age children are unable to use them.\n\nWithin these two general types of delivery systems there are numerous products available that vary widely in performance. The pMDI with spacer or holding chamber is portable and inexpensive, takes less time to administer and is likely to be better tolerated than delivery with a nebulizer. Dolovich et al 87 published a comprehensive systematic review to determine if device selection affects clinical efficacy and safety. Randomized placebo-controlled trials that involved various devices for the delivery of \u03b2-agonists, ICS and anticholinergic agents in different clinical settings (emergency department, inpatient, intensive care and outpatient) and patient populations (pediatric and adult asthma, and COPD) were included. Reports in which the same drug was delivered with different devices were analyzed. Their findings indicated that the drugs delivered via different formats are equally effective. Appropriate secondary prevention of asthma. [97] [98] [99] The first and likely the most important step toward controlling asthma in sensitized children is to avoid or reduce the patient's exposure to the offending allergen. The environmental interventions that seem to hold the most promise are those that target reducing exposure to indoor allergens and tobacco smoke. Specific environmental control measures are covered in Chapter 21.\n\nYearly influenza immunization is also strongly recommended for children 6 months of age and older with chronic pulmonary diseases, including asthma. Kramarz et al evaluated the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in preventing influenza-related asthma exacerbations in children 1 to 6 years of age using a retrospective cohort study with the Vaccine Safety Datalink, which contains data on more than 1 million children enrolled in four large health maintenance organizations. 100 Of note, less than 10% of children with asthma were vaccinated against influenza in any of the years studied. Although the incidence rates of asthma exacerbation in those who were vaccinated were found to be higher in the vaccinated group than in those who were not vaccinated, the difference was thought to be largely confounded by asthma severity in the vaccinated group. Using a 'self-control' analysis to correct for this confounder, the risks of asthma exacerbation during each of the influenza seasons were reduced by 22% to 41% with influenza vaccination.\n\nExacerbations, also commonly referred to as episodes or flareups, are acute deterioration of asthma control characterized by increased symptom severity, sudden change in child's activity or performance (lethargy or lack of interest or exercise intolerance), poor response to or sudden increased need for rescue medication, and breathing difficulty or respiratory distress at its worst. In this age group, these are often preceded by upper respiratory symptoms or viral syndrome. The most effective approach in managing asthma exacerbations involves early recognition of warning signs and early treatment. An action plan should be provided to the family members or caregivers which includes information about what medications to give, medical provider's contact information and when to seek urgent medical attention (such as signs of acute distress, symptoms unrelieved by bronchodilator, increased need for rescue treatment or repeated use of bronchodilator over several hours). 7 A copy should also be given to daycare providers and school personnel.\n\nEarly treatment of asthma exacerbations may prevent a lifethreatening event or a hospital admission. Initial treatment should be with a SABA (e.g. albuterol or levalbuterol): 2 puffs from an MDI via a spacer device with or without a facemask, which may be repeated every 20 minutes 2 more times, or a single treatment can be given by nebulizer (0.05 mg/kg [minimum dose, 1.25 mg; maximum, 2.5 mg] of 0.5% solution of albuterol in 2-3 mL saline; or 0.075 mg/kg [minimum dose, 1.25 mg; maximum, 5 mg] of levalbuterol). 6 If the response is good as assessed by sustained symptom relief, the SABA can be continued every 3 to 4 hours for 24 to 48 hours. Patients should children include the following: enforcing a tight fitting mask around the child's mouth and nose, encouraging immediate inhalation after actuation, allowing 5 to 6 breaths per single pMDI actuation, making sure that the spacer valve is moving when the child is breathing through the spacer, shaking the inhaler in between actuations and using a lower volume spacer (<350 mL) in these very young children.\n\nThe Montreal Protocol, adopted in 1987, mandated a complete elimination of the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellant due to concerns about its damaging effect on the ozone layer. Since 2008, pMDIs now contain hydrofluoroalkane (HFA). However, the pMDI HFAs (even rescue short-acting \u03b2-agonists) are approved for use only in children 4 years of age and older. There is no information available on the relationship between lung deposition from HFA pMDI and clinical efficacy or even long-term safety in small children. In addition, no studies exist comparing inhaled medications administered via nebulizer and HFA pMDI with spacer and mask.\n\nAdditional factors that should be considered are the costs to the patient (including use of spacer attachments which are not reimbursable) and the use of multiple delivery devices which requires more time for the clinician staff to educate families on proper techniques. To address both issues, perhaps the same type of device can be used for all inhaled drugs for an individual patient. The decision should also incorporate which device the clinician is capable of teaching properly and what the patient/parent prefers. When a child presents with uncontrolled asthma, the assessment should first focus on technique and adherence.\n\nThe issue of adherence in infants and small children is complicated because the child is entirely dependent on the caregiver to administer the medication. In an observational study of preschool children, Gibson et al sought to evaluate adherence with inhaled prophylactic medications delivered through a large volume spacer using an electronic timer device. Adherence was only 50% with a range of 0% to 94%. 92 In addition, only 42% of the subjects received the prescribed medication on each study day, and reporting of symptoms in the diary cards did not correlate with good compliance with the prophylactic medication, nor was a correlation found between frequency of administration and adherence. In another study, parental reporting of symptom scores correlated with measured bronchodilator use in only 63% of preschool children. 93 A few studies have attempted to determine why caregivers are unable to administer medications as prescribed. Lim et al asked parents why they were reluctant to administer prophylactic medications (such as ICS) to their young children with asthma. Reasons cited included hesitancy to use medications for fear of dependence, side-effects and overdosage. 94 Fortunately, patient education programs developed for parents of small children with asthma improve asthma morbidity and selfmanagement outcome. 95, 96 \n\nNonpharmacologic measures may be as important not only for young children with established respiratory symptoms, allergies and passive smoke exposure but also in the primary and who cannot cooperate with or who resist inhalation therapy, adjunctive therapies include intravenous magnesium sulfate (25-75 mg/kg up to 2 g in children) and heliox driven albuterol nebulization, but their use in younger children is not as established. The use of isotonic magnesium sulfate by nebulization (150 mg, 3 doses in the first hour) as an add-on treatment for children as young as 2 years of age with severe exacerbation was found beneficial for those with more severe presentation in the presence of oxygen saturation <92% and with symptoms lasting less than 6 hours. 104 For impending or ongoing respiratory arrest, epinephrine 1 : 1,000 or terbutaline 1 mg/mL (both 0.01 mg/kg up to 0.3-0.5 mg) may be administered subcutaneously every 20 minutes for three doses, although the use of intravenous \u03b2 2agonists is still unproven. Children may need ventilatory support with 100% oxygen, intravenous corticosteroids and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Further treatment is based on clinical response and objective laboratory findings.\n\nHospitalization should be strongly considered for any child with a history of respiratory failure or significant psychosocial impediments to optimal acute asthma care. The decision to hospitalize should also be based on presence of risk factors for mortality from asthma, duration and severity of symptoms, course and severity of previous exacerbations, medication use at the time of the exacerbation, access to medical care, and home and psychosocial conditions. Maintenance fluids and electrolyte requirements (both corticosteroids and \u03b2 2 -agonists can cause potassium loss) should be provided, especially since these young children are likely to have poor oral intake secondary to respiratory distress or vomiting, but they require intensive monitoring as overhydration may contribute to pulmonary edema associated with high intrapleural pressures generated in severe asthma. Antibiotics may be necessary to treat co-existing bacterial infection.\n\nCriteria for discharging young children home should include a sustained response of at least 1 hour to bronchodilator therapy. The child should also be ambulatory according to age expectation, comfortable, and able to keep food or drink down. 7 Prior to discharge, the caregiver's ability to continue therapy and assess symptoms appropriately needs to be considered since children with a recent exacerbation are at risk of recurrent episodes. The caregiver should be given an action plan for management of recurrent symptoms or exacerbations, identification of triggers and how to avoid them, and instructions about rescue and controller medications and their use. Hospitalized patients should receive more intensive education prior to discharge. This is another opportunity to review inhaler technique. The inhaled SABA and oral corticosteroids should be continued, the latter for 3 to 7 days. Finally, the caregiver should be instructed about the follow-up visit, which typically takes place within 1 week. Referral to an asthma specialist should be considered for all children with severe exacerbations or multiple emergency department visits or hospitalizations.\n\nGiven the burden of asthma and recurrent wheezing illnesses in young children, with their associated morbidity and healthcare utilization due to risk of severe episodes, not to mention the high direct and indirect costs that go with them, preventive measures are indeed warranted. To have any chance for success, be advised to seek medical care once excessive doses of bronchodilator therapy are used or for prolonged periods (e.g. >6 puffs of inhaled SABA are used within the first 2 hours, >12 puffs/day for >24 hours, or if the child has not recovered after 24 hours). 6, 7 If the child does not completely improve with the initial therapy, the SABA should be continued and the caregiver should contact the physician urgently. If the child experiences marked distress, the caregiver should give the SABA immediately and bring the patient to the emergency department or call 9-1-1 or another emergency number for assistance. Intensification of acute treatment with an oral corticosteroid initiated by family members can be considered but evidence for its early use is debatable. 101 Doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids is not proven sufficient to prevent worsening of exacerbations. However, recent studies in small children not on regular controller therapy have shown benefits from using high-dose ICS at the early onset of a respiratory illness in preventing the need for systemic corticosteroid. 46, 48 One study has shown the efficacy of starting a short course of montelukast at the onset of a respiratory tract illness in small children with episodic wheezing with respect to reducing symptom burden, healthcare utilization and time off work, 82 but perhaps this benefit from a short course of leukotriene receptor antagonist at reducing symptom burden may only be expected in young children who have atopic risk factors. 102 \n\nClinical assessment is used, and scoring systems (e.g. Preschool Respiratory Assessment Measure [PRAM] and the Pediatric Asthma Severity Score [PASS]) have been developed to assess the severity of asthma exacerbations. 103 Severe exacerbations are characterized by any one of the following: altered mental state (agitated, confused or drowsy), oxygen saturation <92%; tachycardia (>200 beats/minute for 0 to 3 years old; >180 beats/minute for 4 to 5 years old); retractions; cyanosis; and 'silent' chest (wheeze inaudible). 7 Functional assessment of a young child's degree of airflow limitation is impractical but oxygen saturation should be obtained. Chest radiographs are not recommended routinely but should be considered to rule out pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumonia or atelectasis.\n\nInitial treatment can be with a SABA by inhaler (albuterol, 4-8 puffs) or nebulizer (0.15 mg/kg of albuterol 0.5% solution; minimum dose 2.5 mg), or nebulized high-dose SABA plus ipratropium bromide (0.25-0.5 mg), up to three doses in the first hour. Oxygen should be given to maintain oxygen saturation above 93%. 6, 7 Systemic corticosteroids (oral prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day; maximum of 20 mg/day for <2 years of age, 30 mg for children 2 to 5 years of age, and 60 mg/day for older children or IV methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg every 6 hours) 7 should be instituted if the child responds poorly to therapy at 1 hour or continues to deteriorate or if symptoms recur within 3 to 4 hours or symptoms persist beyond 1 day or if the child has recently been on oral corticosteroids. Sensitivity to adrenergic drugs may improve after initiation of corticosteroids.\n\nIf the child shows slow or poor response, continuous bronchodilator treatment for the first hour (0.5 mg/kg/h) can be administered. For older children and adults with severe exacerbation having no response to initial inhaled therapy, or for those not merely to prevent hospitalization but also to avert a lower respiratory tract illness from RSV. In addition, the protective effect of palivizumab appeared to be found in those children without a family history of asthma or atopy. 119 A bacterial lysate, OM-85 BV, containing standardized lyophilized fractions per capsule from eight bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria) is widely used in Europe to reduce acute respiratory tract infections. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study it has been found to be effective at reducing acute wheezing illnesses in children with a history of recurrent wheezing by 38% compared with placebo. 120 It remains to be evaluated in larger clinical trials if this can be an effective primary intervention modality that will prevent the development of asthma. Immunomodulators, including this immunostimulant, along with probiotics, prebiotics, anti-IgE and specific immunotherapy, are proposed as potential primary prevention interventions by a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop committee. 121 There has been a recent trend toward intervening early in the course of the disease with the hope of altering the natural history of asthma, and clinical trials of what can be considered secondary prevention measures have provided important observations. There have been studies that sought to determine if treatment with an ICS soon after the onset of early indicators of the disease would modify the course of asthma. 19, 47, 63, 102 The study designs varied with respect to the eligibility criteria, age at entry, frequency of past wheezing episodes and manner and duration of treatment (e.g. maintenance vs intermittent or as needed intervention).\n\nThe NHLBI Childhood Asthma Research and Education (CARE) network-sponsored Prevention of Early Asthma in Kids (PEAK) study enrolled approximately 300 2-to 3-year-old children with more than three episodes of wheezing and a positive mAPI to receive either fluticasone propionate 88 \u00b5g via pMDI or matching placebo twice daily for 2 years. 19 During the third year observation period of interest, no difference in either the proportion of children with active wheezing or lung function measured using forced oscillometry between the two treatment groups was found. However, during the first two years while on treatment, symptom control was better and asthma exacerbations fewer for the active treatment group compared to placebo. A reduction in growth velocity during the first 8 months (6.6 \u00b1 1.0 vs 7.3 \u00b1 1.0 cm/yr between 1 and 8 months, P = .005) and a smaller mean increase in height between 4 and 12 months (4.5 \u00b1 1.1 vs 4.9 \u00b1 1.1 cm, P = .001) were observed in the ICS group. However, during the second year of treatment, the growth velocity in the ICS group was greater than that in the placebo group (7.0 \u00b1 0.8 vs 6.4 \u00b1 0.9 cm/yr, P = .001). Children in the ICS group had an average height percentile of 51.5 \u00b1 29.2 compared to 56.4 \u00b1 27.3 in the placebo group at the end of treatment (P < .001) and 54.4 \u00b1 27.9 compared to 56.4 \u00b1 26.9 at the end of observation (P = .03).\n\nAnother study (IFWIN; Inhaled Fluticasone propionate in Wheezy INfants) evaluated whether ICS therapy for infants with a history of wheezing could prevent active asthma and prevent loss of lung function in later childhood. 63 A total of 200 children (mean age at entry 1.2 years) from a birth study cohort with two documented episodes of wheeze or one prolonged episode, more than 1 month duration, and a parental history of atopy early intervention will require identifying high-risk infants and establishing effectiveness of the intervention strategy in young children while minimizing the potential for adverse effects. This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 39. Primary prevention is ideal but the right intervention is lacking because of the heterogeneous nature of this condition.\n\nTwo studies have evaluated the effects of ketotifen and cetirizine, respectively, in preventing the onset of asthma in genetically prone children. 105, 106 In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study, children up to 2 years of age without a prior history of wheezing but with a family history of asthma or allergic rhinitis and presence of elevated serum IgE were randomized to receive either ketotifen (0.5-1 mg twice daily) (N = 45, mean age 11.5 months) or placebo (N = 40, mean age 10.8 months) for 3 years. 43 Only 9% of children on active treatment compared to 35% of the placebo group developed frequent episodes of wheezing during the study period (P = .003). The other study, called the Early Treatment of the Atopic Child, was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial that compared cetirizine (0.25 mg/kg twice daily) and placebo. 106 The medications were administered for 18 months to infants between 1 and 2 years of age with atopic dermatitis and a family history of atopy. The primary outcome, which was the time to onset of asthma in the next 18 months after discontinuation of treatment, was not different between the two groups. Half the children in both cetirizine and placebo groups developed asthma (defined as three episodes of wheezing during the 36 months of follow-up) (P = .7). However, in the cetirizine group, infants with evidence of dust mite or grass pollen sensitivity were less likely to have asthma over the 18 months of treatment with a sustained effect for grass-sensitized infants over the 36 months of follow-up compared with those treated with placebo. Furthermore, in the placebo group there was an increased risk of developing asthma in those with baseline sensitivity to egg, house dust mite, grass pollen or cat allergen. These two studies support the role of easily administered preventive measures in delaying or even preventing the development of asthma in genetically predisposed children.\n\nVarious other prevention modalities have shown promising potential to modulate asthma development. Given the relevance of environmental and allergen exposure in airway inflammation characteristic of asthma, interventions that can reduce these exposures (e.g. reducing tobacco smoke, dust mite or pet avoidance, and dietary modifications) have been undertaken, with modest overall results, and applicability may be limited by location and individual exposures. [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] In addition, the success of interventions targeting reduction of exposure may be dependent on a multifaceted approach, and not just a single measure alone. 117 Recognizing the role of airway infection (including serious respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] and rhinovirus infections in early life) in the development of recurrent wheezing and asthma susceptibility in childhood, perhaps prophylaxis against them might help reduce asthma development. A lower incidence of recurrent wheezing (and even physiciandocumented episodes) over a 2-year follow-up period was found among preterm infants without chronic lung disease who had received palivizumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody against the RSV fusion protein) compared with preterm infants who had not received palivizumab, prior to enrollment. 118 There was also a significant difference in outcomes between palivizumab-treated and untreated children who were not hospitalized for RSV, suggesting that the effect of palivizumab was corticosteroid rescue, asthma healthcare utilization or quality of life was found. Nevertheless, both active study treatments demonstrated modest reductions in symptom severity score (such as wheezing, trouble breathing or activity limitation) relative to conventional therapy, particularly among children with positive API or prior oral corticosteroid use.\n\nThese studies provide important information regarding ICS therapy in young children with recurrent wheezing episodes although the overall results regarding prevention of progression to persistent asthma are not convincing. ICS can be indicated to improve asthma control but should not be expected to prevent the development of asthma or persistent wheezing, even for high-risk subjects.\n\nChronic cough and recurrent wheezing, typical manifestations of asthma, are quite common in young children, yet these symptoms render different long-term outcomes and, acutely, varying severity. For those with a more persistent pattern, controller therapy is indicated. A significant subset have a severe, intermittent course, and for these patients daily controller therapy may still be beneficial. However, recent studies have suggested the efficacy of 'as needed' high-dose inhaled corticosteroid started at the onset of a respiratory illness, particularly in very young children who have atopic risk factors. The development of persistent asthma and requirement for long-term controller therapy in a very young child can be predicted to a limited degree. Currently no clinically available objective and reliable measure of lung function, bronchial hyperreactivity or airway inflammation exists that is applicable to this age group, hence monitoring the effects of interventions or treatment on prevention of asthma inception, modulation of underlying inflammation, perhaps airway remodeling, prevention of deterioration in lung function over time and induction of physiologic or immunologic remission is not feasible. The need to evaluate objectively the efficiency and safety of the various delivery devices and HFA formulation available for inhaled therapies to infants and young children remains. Only a few medications have been approved for use in this population, and studies have demonstrated effects on asthma control using short-term parameters. Studies on prevention of asthma development are warranted, especially in those who are deemed susceptible. Yet these are the ultimate goals that may motivate patients and families, if indeed interventions can really alter the development and the natural history of their disease. These studies often require large sample size and monitoring over longer periods of time which require enormous resources and the use of practical, objective measures of disease activity which are still lacking.\n\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; website (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/asthgdln .htm) The Global Initiative for Asthma; website (http://www .ginasthma.org/documents/4)\n\nThe complete reference list can be found on the companion Expert Consult website at http://www.expertconsult.inkling .com.\n\nwere randomized to receive fluticasone propionate 100 \u00b5g or matching placebo twice daily. At age 5 years, no difference between the ICS and placebo groups in the proportion of children with current wheeze, physician-diagnosed asthma and use of supplemental open-label ICS (fluticasone 100 \u00b5g twice daily) was found. Furthermore, the number of exacerbations, lung function (using sRaw through plethysmography with dynamic lung volumes and expiratory flow) and bronchial hyperreactivity (using eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation) were also not different between the groups. Children who were on ICS, particularly after 6 to 12 months, had transient reduction in growth velocity; and those who received both masked and open-label ICS had a slower rate of growth, compared to either the 'masked treatment only' or 'open-label treatment only' groups. While these two studies demonstrate that long-term treatment with ICS does not modify the course of asthma, they also raise the potential for systemic effects of this intervention which can limit its use for this purpose. Using ICS only for an acute illness and evaluating its long-term impact is attractive not only because it is less burdensome but also it may decrease the risk of growth retardation.\n\nOne study, the Prevention of Asthma in Childhood (PAC), sought to determine whether early intervention using intermittent administration of an ICS, when initiated at the first episode of wheezing and during subsequent episodes, could alter the development of asthma. 47 Of 411 infants born to mothers with asthma enrolled at one month of age, approximately 300 children received at least one 14-day course of budesonide 400 \u00b5g/ day or matching placebo administered via pMDI and holding chamber (mean age at the first course of study medication was 10.7 months). For every acute illness, children were to start either treatment after 3 days of wheezing. Upon completion of this 3-year study, a similar percentage of symptom-free days between treatment groups (83% vs 82% for the budesonide and placebo groups, respectively) was found. In addition, 24% and 21% of children in the budesonide and placebo groups, respectively, had persistent wheezing. The mean duration of each acute wheezing episode was not reduced by budesonide therapy. Lung function using pre-and post-bronchodilator sRaw at age 3 years was comparable between the two treatment groups. Lastly, there was no difference in height between the groups. Thus, intermittent ICS did not alter the natural history of asthma in infants at risk for asthma nor did it change the duration of the acute wheezing episodes.\n\nThe NHLBI CARE Acute Intervention Management Strategies (AIMS) study 102 randomized 238 children aged 12 to 59 months who had at least two episodes of moderate-to-severe wheezing requiring either an urgent care visit and/or systemic steroid course in the context of a respiratory tract illness within the past year. Participants were randomized to receive one of the following for 7 days at the onset of symptoms: budesonide inhalation suspension (1.0 mg twice daily) or montelukast group (4 mg once daily) or conventional rescue bronchodilator therapy. The primary outcome was the proportion of episodefree days (i.e. days free from cough, wheeze, trouble breathing, asthma-associated interference with daily activities or awakening from sleep, healthcare utilization due to wheezing, and use of asthma-related non-study medications) over the entire study period. Compared to conventional rescue bronchodilator therapy, neither budesonide nor montelukast initiated at early signs of illness increased the proportion of episode-free days over a 1-year period. In addition, no differential effect on oral"}
