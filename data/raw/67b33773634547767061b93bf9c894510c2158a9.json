{"title": "", "body": " Taiwan \n\nOn January 28, WHO provided a surveillance case definition of COVID-19 and suggested for a laboratory test 4 : Patients with severe acute respiratory infection (fever, cough, and requiring admission to hospital), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND in the 14 days prior to symptom onset, had (1) a history of travel to or residence in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, or patient is a health care worker who has been working in an environment where severe acute respiratory infections of unknown etiology are being cared for; (2) close contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19, or visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, or worked or attended a health care facility where patients with hospital-associated COVID-19 have been reported. On February 27, the epidemic regions were modified as a history of travel to or residence in a country, area or territory that has reported local transmission of COVID-19 disease and added a clinical criteria of a patient with severe acute respiratory infection requiring hospitalization. 5 In the US, CDC offered the first criteria to guide evaluation of patients under investigation for COVID-19 on January 17, 2020. 6 Patients who have fever and/or symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) and in the last 14 days before symptom onset, have a history of travel from Wuhan City, China, OR close contact with a person who is under investigation for COVID-19 while that person was ill or an ill laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient should be evaluated. Later, a history of travel expanded from Wuhan city to Hubei Province, and even mainland China for those requiring hospitalization on February 1, 7 and to affected geographic regions where sustained community transmission has been identified on February 28. 8 With the testing capacity of COVID-19 diagnostic testing allowing clinicians to consider testing for a wider group of symptomatic patients, clinicians were strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza) in the latest update guidance on March 8. 9 10 All the committee members agreed to include COVID-19 as one of the category 5 notifiable diseases, and on January 15, 2020, COVID-19 was announced to be included as such. The first reporting criteria of COVID-19 was drafted on January 7, 2020 under an urgent circumstance.\n\nThe reporting criteria of COVID-19 in Taiwan included clinical criteria, epidemiologic criteria and laboratory criteria. 11 A patient who has both one clinical criteria and one epidemiologic criteria or has one laboratory criteria fulfills the reporting criteria. Once a patient satisfied the reporting criteria, the patient should be reported to Taiwan CDC within 24 hours of suspicion or diagnosis, should be admitted to a single bed room, preferable negative pressure isolation room, in a designated hospital and clinical specimens, including oropharyngeal (or nasopharyngeal) swab, sputum, and serum, should be obtained and sent to the designated CDC-contracted virologic laboratories for the detection of SARA-CoV-19.\n\nAccording to the laboratory results, a reporting case of COVID-19 can be classified as (1) confirmed case: a case satisfied the laboratory criteria; (2) probable case: a case satisfied clinical criteria, though not confirmed by the laboratory tests, and had intimate contact with a symptomatic confirmed case;\n\n(3) excluding case: not satisfying the former two conditions. For each confirmed case (initially a reporting case under investigation), a CDC investigation team would conduct a detailed investigation by interviewing the case or her/his households to try to explore the potential source of infection, and to identify the contacts with whom the confirmed case had intimate contact during the past two weeks of onset. Each contact, once identified, would be notified by the local Health Bureau to a designated hospital for the laboratory test of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe detailed and evolving reporting criteria of COVID-19 is shown in Table 1 .\n\nSince announced, the clinical cases of COVID-19 increased day by day, and the clinical manifestations were more and more clearly defined. Thus, the clinical criteria of tachypnea or respiratory difficulty was deleted in second version first and criteria 1 was modified from \"fever and acute respiratory infection\" to \"fever or acute respiratory infection\" on January 25. With the ongoing epidemic, for the detection of potential cases due to community \n\nWith the evolving reporting criteria, the designated hospitals could maintain high quality of medical care under an optimal loading and work well without missing any potential cases of COVID-19. However, several issues were raised. First, while the reporting criteria was modified and evolved from time to time, the clinicians who might encounter the potential cases of COVID-19 should keep an eye on the announcement (mostly the website) of Taiwan CDC to timely catch the changing criteria. Second, not only the clinicians but also the potential cases of COVID-19 were confused in whom fulfilled the reporting criteria and should (could) have a laboratory test. Third, while the order of a laboratory test was restricted to the reporting criteria, the clinician was not allowed to test a suspected patient not fulfilling the criteria until the criteria was expanded to those without a history of travel to epidemic regions or contact with a confirmed case. Subsequently, four cases of CAP were confirmed to be caused by SARS-CoV-2 during hospitalization and one of them (National COVID-19 Case Sequence No. 34) inevitably resulted in the first hospital outbreak of COVID-19 in Taiwan. A clinician's judgement cannot be overlooked. Fourth, while the reporting criteria was expanded, the guidance for caring for the reporting cases under investigation was not modified simultaneously, which subsequently resulted in the exhaustion of personal protection equipment and full occupancy of negative pressure isolation rooms.\n\nAs of March 15, a total of 17,219 cases encountered laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2; 16.,805 cases were classified as excluding cases and 59 cases as confirmed cases (http://nidss.cdc.gov.tw/ch/SingleDisease.aspx?dc=1&dt=5&disease=19CoV) ( Figure   1 ). 15 Of the 59 confirmed cases, 32 cases (54%) were imported and initially mainly from China as expectedly (12 cases, and onset of the last case was on "}
