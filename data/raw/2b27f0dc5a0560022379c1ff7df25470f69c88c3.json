{"title": "Journal Pre-proof What Should Palliative Care's Response be to the COVID-19 Epidemic? Telephone: 734-769-7100x5441", "body": "To the Editor: While palliative care has recently experienced growth and increased penetration in the 33 health care,(3) the growth of the palliative care workforce has yet to meet demand.\n\nThere is an existing shortage of palliative care clinicians (physicians, nurses, and social 35 workers with palliative care specialization). As it stands, many palliative care 36 interdisciplinary teams regularly work at or near capacity,(4) leading many teams to 37 operate using formal triage processes (5) Face-to-face palliative care consultation should be reserved for only those COVID-19 72 patients for whom primary palliative care is inadequate; that is, when the primary team 73 has done their best to palliate the patient and soothe the family, but efforts have failed.\n\nTo ensure the optimal use of palliative care consultation on non-COVID-19 patients, 75 overall palliative care consult criteria may need to temporarily become stricter.\n\nStraightforward requests that would normally be entertained to foster good will in an 77 institution may need to be triaged. For example, requests for \"information about Individuals with serious illness who become infected with COVID-19 should be 103 encouraged to stay at home with the support of hospice services (if available). If the 104 epidemic intensifies as predicted, older patients with pre-existing serious illness will be the first to be denied life-sustaining care in the event of scarcity. For these patients, 106 hospitalization will provide no benefits above and beyond care occurring in the home.\n\nFollowing this logic, hospice and home health agencies will see a flood of referrals. Like 108 everyone else, they will likely place limits on face-to-face contact with patients and patients anticipatory guidance about what hospice will and will not be able to do.\n\nCaregivers should be educated about how to avoid acquiring COVID-19 themselves, 114 and how to best utilize their social network to limit the number of other people exposed.
