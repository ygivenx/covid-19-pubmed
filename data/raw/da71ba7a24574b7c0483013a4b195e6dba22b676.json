{"title": "First genome sequences of buffalo coronavirus from water buffaloes in Bangladesh", "body": "Coronaviruses are classified into four genera, with bat coronaviruses known as the gene source of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus, and avian coronaviruses as the gene source of Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus [1, 2] . However, lineage A Betacoronavirus is unique among the genus in originating in rodents instead of bats [3] . Lineage A Betacoronavirus comprises several coronavirus species, including murine coronavirus, human coronavirus HKU1, Chinese Rattus coronavirus HKU24, rabbit coronavirus HKU14 and Betacoronavirus 1 [3] [4] [5] . Betacoronavirus 1 is best known for its tendency for recombination and interspecies transmission among various mammalian species [3, 6, 7] . In particular, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV OC43) likely originated from a relatively recent zoonotic transmission event, with the most recent common ancestor of HCoV OC43 and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) dating to around 1890 [8] . Besides cattle, BCoV-like viruses have been detected in various ungulates, including water buffalo calves with gastroenteritis in Italy [9, 10] . However, only partial gene sequences, the longest one being~9.6 kb spanning ORF1b to nucleocapsid (N), were obtained from the buffalo viruses [9, 10] .\n\nWe report the complete genome sequences of a buffalo coronavirus (BufCoV HKU26) detected from the faecal samples of two domestic adult water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) in Bangladesh. RT-PCR for coronavirus detection, and complete genome sequencing and analysis were performed as described previously [11, 12] . The genomes of BufCoV HKU26 strains B1-24F and B1-28F were 31 021 and 30 975 in length, with G+C content of 40%. They possessed 98-99% nucleotide identities to the genomes of BCoVs, supporting the classification of BufCoV HKU26 as a member of the species Betacoronavirus 1 (Fig. 1) . The genome organization is also characteristic of lineage A Betacoronavirus, with the putative transcription regulatory sequence motif 5 0 -C(U/C)AAAC-3 0 (Fig. 1) . The two BufCoV HKU26 genomes encode five putative accessory proteins conserved among most members of Betacoronavirus 1, including a 32 kDa protein between ORF1ab and haemagglutininesterase, three proteins between spike (S) and envelope (E) and one internal protein overlapping with N. In BCoV, the three proteins between S and E were of typical size: 4.9, 4.8 and 12.8 kDa respectively. In BufCoV, the 4.9 kDa protein is replaced by a 2.9 kDa protein (25 aa) due to a premature stop codon. The 4.8 kDa protein of BufCoV HKU26 was also different from that of BCoVs, with a smaller protein of 29 aa in strain B1-24F and a protein of 44 aa in strain B1-28F due to a frameshift mutation caused by a single nucleotide deletion after the original start codon. Compared to other BCoV-like viruses, BufCoV HKU26 possessed a unique serine/asparagine substitution at position 354 of N protein. In contrast to murine coronavirus, which utilizes carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 as a receptor, BCoV and HCoV OC43 bind to N-acetyl-9-O acetyl neuraminic acid for cell entry [13, 14] . All the known critical and noncritical sugar-binding residues in the N-terminal domain of S protein in BCoV are conserved in BufCoV HKU26 [15] . The genome sequences of BufCoV HKU26 have been lodged at GenBank under accession numbers KU558922 and KU558923.\n\nNone declared."}
