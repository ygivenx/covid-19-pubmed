{"title": "Infectious agents associated with diarrhoea of calves in the canton of Tilarb, Costa Rica", "body": "Diarrhoea in young pre-weaned calves is one of the most important causes of calf morbidity and mortality (Oxender et al., 1973; Tzipori, 1981; Olsson et al., 1993) . Disease incidence in young calves has an adverse effect on their immediate health status, longevity in the herd and productivity performance and thus causes great economic loss (Britney et al., 1984; Vanopdenbosch and Pohl, 1993) . In order to increase productivity per livestock unit without increasing livestock numbers, it is important to identify the etiological and predisposing factors involved in calf diarrhoea in order to devise preventive measures and reduce losses during the initial months of life. Previously, such studies have been conducted on various dairy farms in Costa Rica (Oviedo et al., 1987; Corder0 and Osorio, 1988; Hird et al., 1990) . However, most cattle in Costa Rica (60%) are kept in extensive beef production systems and 18% are kept in dual-purpose (DP; beef and dairy) systems. Moreover, beef production has increased recently in Costa Rica from 37.1 in 1974-1976 to 51.7 kg in 1986-1988 per head of cattle and calves (Simpson and Conrad, 1993) . Furthermore, the dual-purpose system is expected to increase in relevance to the foreseeable future (Perez, 1994) . Consequently, we devised a case-control study to compare the prevalence of selected pathogens in calves with and without diarrhoea in 15 beef or dual-purpose farms in a tropical dry-forest ecosystem.\n\nA convenient sample of 15 farms was selected in the canton of Tilaran The farms were selected on the basis of the owner's willingness to participate in the study and to form a representative selection of the various management systems in the region (Table  1) . The selected farms belonged to a pilot project initiated by the staff of the Veterinary School of the Universidad National as part of a livestock-information system (Dwinger et al., 1994) . The calf-rearing units at these farms were visited weekly over a period of 6 months during the dry season (November 1993 to April 1994 . The canton of Tilaran is situated at lO\"29'58\" northern latitude and 84\"54'26' western longitude and contains areas with tropical dry forest and tropical moist forest. The average annual rainfall ranges between 2000 and 4000 mm and the ambient temperature between 24 and 30\u00b0C. Four farms were extensive enterprises (average area: 300 ha) and dedicated to beef production. The calves on these farms remained with the dams for several months. Ten farms were dedicated to dual-purpose production. In these farms, the calves remained with the dams for several days postpartum before milking started. After the daily milking routine, the calves were allowed to suckle the dams once or twice a day. At nine farms, milking was done mechanically and manually in the remaining one. In three of the dual-purpose farms, the calves were housed together with the dams and were only separated before milking, when they were temporarily housed in small pens. On the remaining seven dual-purpose farms, the calves were housed separately from the dams, either inside large communal pens or during the day when they grazed outside as a group. The time of weaning varied from 3 months to 1 year of age. One farm was a speciahsed dairy and raised the calves in individual pens with whole milk.\n\nAll calves under 3 months of age with signs of diarrhoea were sampled, provided they had not received prior treatment with antibiotics. Diarrhoea was defined according to a scoring system which took into account colour (1 = normal; 2 = abnormally light or dark), smell (1 = normal; 2 = ambiguous; 3 = foul) and consistency (1 = normal; 2 = soft; 3 = watery). Other aspects, such as the presence of blood or particles (of undigested food, blood clots or pieces of intestinal tissue) in the faeces, mucosity and the presence of a dirty tail, hocks or ischiadic processes were also recorded. An animal with an additive score of more than 4 using colour, smell and consistency, was considered a case of diarrhoea. If an animal had a score of 4 and dirty hind parts, it was also considered a case. For each case calf, a corresponding calf with normal faeces, closest in age (w-th a maximum age difference of 2 weeks), of the same breed and on the same farm was sampled as control. Whenever an animal was sampled, a form was completed with relevant information. Sample size was calculated as the minimum number of calves necessary to detect a difference between 15% (prevalence rate of Rotavirus in calves with diarrhoea; Hird et al., 1990) and 6% (prevalence rate of Rotavirus in calves without diarrhoBea; Hird et al., 1990 ) at a confidence level of 95% and a power of 80%; 179 calves with diarrhoea and 179 controls were needed. Controls were discarded whenever they turned into cases within 1 week of sampling and, consequently, the match was not used in the analysis.\n\nFaecal samples were collected directly from the rectum in disposable plastic bags and stored at 4\u00b0C. The marked plastic bags containing the samples were transported in coolboxes on ice to the central laboratory of the Universidad National in Heredia (a 5-h drive) within 2 days of the sampling. The faecal samples were investigated for the presence of agents considered to play an important role in neonatal calf diarrhoea, such as Escherichia coli K99, Salmonella, Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Torovirus, Strongyloides sp., Strongylida, Cryptosporidium sp. and Coccidia spp. (Vermunt, 1994) .\n\nA subsample of faeces using a metal loop with a diameter of 4 mm was placed in a tube with 5 ml of tetrathionate-iodide broth and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. The broth from the tetrathionate-iodide tube was streaked on to a MacConkey, an Eosin Methylene Blue Levin and a Salmonella shigella agar and incubated at 37\u00b0C. After 24 h, the colonies were identified. All colonies were inoculated on Triple Sugar Iron, Christensen Urea agar, Sulfur Indol Mobility and Simmon's Citrate and identified after incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. Thus, Salmonella was identified and colonies were further checked by means of a serum agglutination test (Difco).\n\nColonies identified as E. coli were transferred to a Tripto Soya agar tube and after an incubation period of 24 h at 37\u00b0C stored at 4\u00b0C. To identify the K99-strain, a tube with Minca agar was inoculated and incubated 24 h at 37\u00b0C. After that, a serum agglutination test (CDI-DLO, Lelystad, The Netherlands) was done.\n\nSamples of 4 g of faeces were diluted with 10 ml of PBS, thoroughly mixed using a Vortex-Genie 2 @ (VWR-Scientific) and centrifuged for 10 min at 2830 g. Two Eppendorf bottles (1.5 ml each) were filled with the supematant and frozen at -70\u00b0C until further investigation. Bovine Coronavirus, Rotavirus and Torovirus were detected by means of a DOT-ELISA as described by JimCnez (1990) . Briefly, filtration paper was used to support the nitrocellulose membrane (Transblot @ Transfer Medium, Bio-Rad). Before preparing the Bio-dot@ microtiter plate (Bio-Rad), the membrane and filter paper were washed in distiled water and all bubbles were removed. The microtiter plate was closed as tightly as possible, washed with carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and all the fluid was sucked away with vacuum. Thereafter, each cup was filled with a 100 ~1 sample, which was thawed at 7\u00b0C and centrifuged for 10 min at 8160 g using an Eppendorf centrifuge. The samples were filtered through the nitrocellulose membrane and the membrane was removed from the microtiter plate. Subsequently, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 1% casein in PBS, prepared according to Vogt et al. (1987) and the antisera were added. For Rotavirus, a monoclonal antibody against the P-6 polypeptide (Liprandi et al., 1990) and for Toro-and Coronavirus, a polyclonal monospecific antiserum conjugated to N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin was used (JimCnez, 1990) . The membranes were incubated with agitation at room temperature for 90 min and washed three times with PBS 0.05% Tween solution. Thereafter, in the case of Rotavirus, Fab' specific anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) was added and in the case of Corona-and Torovirus, a commercial avidin-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) was used. The membranes were incubated for 90 min as described above, washed two times with PBS 0.05% Tween solution and once with PBS. A solution of 4-chlor-1-naphtol (Sigma), prepared according to Voller and Bidwell (1986) , was used as substrate. The chromogen was added to the nitrocellulose membranes and read after 5 or 10 min. A clear b;lue reaction was considered positive. Intensities were not measured.\n\nTo investigate the presence of Cryptosporidium sp., a qualitative test was done. A smear was prepared, fixed in methanol and coloured for 1 min with Giemsa. The smears were examined by 10 X 100 magnification (oil immersion).\n\nThe qualitative Shearer test was performed to detect Strongylida and Strongyloides sp. eggs. If this test was positive, the quantitative McMaster method originally described by Gordon and Whitlock (1939) and modified for use in cattle by Roberts and O'Sullivan (1950) was used. In the Shearer test, 4 g of faeces were mixed and homogenised with a hypersaturated solution of sugar. Then hypersaturated sugar solution (gravid density 1.235) was added to approximately 50 ml, the mix was sifted and a Borrel cylinder was filled with the solution until a head of fluid was formed. A microscope slide (5 X 7 cm) was placed on top of the cylinder and after at least 30 min, the slide was examined under the microscope at an amplification of 100 X . This method permittlzd the detection of oocysts of Coccidia as well. A quantitative test for Coccidia was not done.\n\nA conditional logistic regression (CLR) for matched sets (Breslow and Day, 1980) was performed. Each matched set consisted of all observations with the same value for the matching variables (farm, breed). The analysis consisted of a l-to-l matching with two covariates (parity of the dam and gender of the calf).\n\nFaecal samples were collected from 380 calves, of which 186 showed signs of diarrhoea and 194 were considered healthy. Two-thirds of the investigated animals were female in both (case and control) categories. Thirty-four calves in each group were born from heifers and the remainder were calves from cows with a history of more than one parturition. Most animals sampled were either Holstein (n = 158), Zebu (n = 50) or crosses (n = 134) with some Zebu blood. Sixty-two percent of the calves were females. Farms dedicated to beef production generally had fewer problems with diarrhoea than other farms. Salmonella species were detected in only three of the calves with diarrhoea; two of the isolates were identified as S. derby and the third could not be identified with the sera available (but was not S. typhimurium or S. dublin). The K99 antigen was demonstrated in 2% of the calves with diarrhoea and in none of the animals without diarrhoea (Table  21 .\n\nCoccidia oocysts were detected frequently in both groups. A total of 23% of the faecal samples tested positive for Strongyloides sp. eggs and 8% for Strongylidu eggs. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected only in animals with symptoms of diarrhoea (Table 2) .\n\nNo infectious agents were detected in 25% (46 of 181) of samples collected from calves with diarrhoea and in 21% (37 of 175) of the samples from healthy calves. In 32% (58 of 181) of the calves with diarrhoea, two or more pathogens were detected; the same was true in 35% (61 of 175) of the healthy calves. The Coccidicr eggs and either Strongylida and/or Strongyloides eggs were more frequent in healthy calves than in calves with diarrhoea ( Table 2) .\n\nThe average age of a scouring calf was 31 days (median 25 days with a range of 1 to 97 days) and for the control animals, 32 days (median 26 with a range of 2 to 99 days), In scouring calves younger than 1 month of age, viruses were detected most frequently, while in older calves parasite eggs were predominantly present. In calves younger than 1 month of age, one agent was detected in 42% of the scouring calves and in 46% of the healthy calves. In relatively few cases of scouring calves older than one month (5 of 42; 12%), no etiological agent could be detected.\n\nComparisons between healthy and scouring calves using CLR showed significant differences in odds ratios for the presence or absence of specific enteropathogens (Table  3 ). The excretion of virus in the faeces of scouring calves was significantly higher than in healthy calves for Torovirus (OR 2.111, Coronavirus (OR 191 and for Rotavirus (OR 4.79 , Table 3 ). In one sick calf, all three viruses were detected. Differences between animals with and without diarrhoea were statistically significant for each group of helmimhs and intestinal protozoa investigated (Table 3) .\n\nA case-control study was performed to examine the possible involvement of various enteropathogens in diarrhoea by comparing the presence of these agents in the faeces of scouring and healthy calves younger than 3 months of age.\n\nWe have detected Torovirus for the first time in Costa Rica and found it to be the most frequently detected virus in the faeces of scouring calves ( Table 2) . The virus was discovered in 1979 (Woode et al., 1982) and is widespread among farms in the USA and Europe, while more than 88% of dairy cattle in The Netherlands have circulating antibodies (Koopmans et al., 1989) .\n\nOther studies reported the presence of Coronavirus in scouring calves, for example 14% in southern Britain (Reynolds et al., 1986) , 4% in Scotland (Snodgrass et al., 1986) and 9% in The Netherlands (Moerman et al., 1982) . The presence of Coronavirus in the faecal matter of clinically healthy calves is in agreement with previous reports (Crouch et al., 1985) .\n\nIn contrast to the higher numbers of samples containing Rotavirus as reported in other countries (Moon et al., 1978; Moerman et al., 1982; Snodgrass et al., 1986; Pohjola et al., 19861 , only 7% of the scouring and 2% of the healthy calves investigated in the region of Tilar&r excreted Rotavirus.\n\nNot more than 2% of calves showing signs of diarrhoea were infected with E. coEi K99 in the region of Tilar&r. A similar percentage has been reported in previous studies (Reynolds et al., 1986; Snodgrass et al., 1986) . E. coli enteritis occurs mainly in calves younger than 10 days old (Haggard, 1985) . In our study, a total of 16 animals with symptoms of diarrhoea were younger than 10 days of age, while 17 of the controls were less than 10 days old.\n\nSalmonella spp. were detected in 2% of the calves with diarrhoea, which is in agreement with the results of previous studies (Pohjola et al., 1986; Snodgrass et al., 1986; Hird et al., 1990) . However, in contrast to previous findings in animals from PO&, Costa Rica (Hird et al., 19901 , the species isolated from the calves in Tilaran was S. derby.\n\nInfection levels up to 1250 epg were detected for Strongylida, which is considered a severe infection (Troncy, 1989) . Similarly, high epg levels were detected for Strongy-Zoides. These elevated levels could have been caused by management and housing conditions in the region of Tilaran, such as frequency of deworming, hygienic conditions and helminth infestation of calf pastures. In a previous investigation in the regions of Peas and IrazG, which are specialised dairy areas, the infestations detected were few and light (Oviedo et al., 1987) .\n\nCryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 11% of the calves showing signs of diarrhoea and not in any of the healthy calves. This result is comparable to the findings reported in a previous study of Costa Rican calves (Oviedo et al., 1987) . The percentage of scouring calves in which no enteropathogen could be detected was comparable to results of other surveys (Reynolds et al., 1986; Hird et al., 1990) . This relatively high percentage might indicate that many cases of diarrhoea were not associated with infectious disease agents, but due to nutritional or other management factors. Alternatively, the failure to detect infectious agents could be due to insufficient sensitivity of the methods of detection, intermittent shedding of pathogens or the existence of other agents that cause diarrhoea but were not investigated.\n\nIn the CLR, significant differences were detected between healthy and scouring calves with regard to the presence or absence of enteropathogens.\n\nThe presence of any of the three investigated viruses did increase the odds for diarrhoea in calves. On the other hand, Coccidia spp. and Strongyloides had a tendency to be detected more frequently in healthy calves.\n\nMany calves in our investigation were infected with more than one species of potential enteropathogen. All calves infected with Rotavirus in our study were simultaneously infected with E. coli, none of which possessed the K99 pilus antigen. However, somatic antigens or adherence antigens different from K99 are present in E. coli strains and can be similarly associated with secretory forms of diarrhoea (Heath, 1992) . A combination of Rotavirus and enteropathogenic E. coli has been reported to cause a more severe infection than either one of the agents alone (Mebus et al., 1969) . In other studies, the lactation number of the cow was a source of variation in immunoglobulin concentration of the colostrum (Besser and Gay, 1985) and calves born alive of primiparous cows had a higher mortality and morbidity due to diarrhoea than calves born by older cows (Olsson et al., 1993; Perez et al., 1990) . However, we found no difference in morbidity between calves of primiparous heifers and cows with a higher number of parturitions (Table 3 ). The same is true for the difference in morbidity rates in male and female calves. In some reports, morbidity and mortality rates did not differ between gender (Umoh, 1982; Debnath et al., 1990) . Others studies showed differences between gender (Olson et al., 1989; Vaccaro, 1990) .\n\nFinally, the investigation demonstrated calf morbidity due to enteropathogens on beef and dual-purpose farms in Costa Rica. It is suggested that improvements in hygiene, housing and management should be implemented to alleviate calf morbidity and mortality in the region of Tilaran"}
