{"title": "Silencing SARS-CoV Spike protein expression in cultured cells by RNA interference", "body": "SARS-CoV (the SARS-associated coronavirus), which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome, threatens the health of populations throughout the world [1, 2] . Although SARS is reported [3^7] as a novel coronavirus, it retains similar protein structures as other members of the coronavirus family [8] .\n\nThe Spike protein of the coronavirus, with a molecular weight of 150 kDa, contains a large amino-terminal ectodomain and short carboxy-terminal endodomain bridged with a transmembrane domain. The ectodomain of the Spike protein is extensively glycosylated with N-linked glycosylation and seems important for the interaction with the receptors on the surface of the host cells. The conformation change through dimerization of the Spike protein is reported to be critical for the fusion event between the viral envelope and cellular membrane for the coronavirus family [9] . Therefore, binding of antibody to the Spike protein could block the viron entrance into host cells for some of the coronaviruses.\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) (for reviews see [10^14] ) is an innate cellular process, which is activated by a doublestranded RNA molecule with 19^23-nucleotide duplexes in cells from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals [15] . The RNAi is triggered by degradation of single-stranded RNAs of identical sequences. Therefore, RNAi technology can be used to silence gene expression by directly targeting its speci\u00a2c sequence of mRNA. Beside the widely used strategies for knocking down gene expression in academic research, RNAi technology, generated by small interfering RNAi (siRNA), has been used in therapeutic studies of human diseases including cancer, neurogenerative diseases and viral infectious diseases (reviewed in [14] ).\n\nTo date, RNAi technology is reported as an ideal tool to inhibit infectious virus replication in host cells because siRNA can target and silence the important genes of the virus [16] . Using poliovirus as a model, Gitlin et al. [17] demonstrated that siRNA could e\u00a1ectively protect human cells against infection by a rapidly replicating and highly cytolytic RNA virus. Hu et al. [18] reported that siRNA could block retroviral infection in chick embryos and inhibit the growth of the Rous sarcoma virus and human immunode\u00a2ciency virus (HIV) in cell culture. They found that the siRNA primarily prevented accumulation of the viral RNAs synthesized in the late stage of the infection, but did not degrade the RNA genome in the virus in the early stage of the infection. Other groups reported that siRNA could speci\u00a2cally inhibit HIV-1 replication and virus propagation [19] through targeting major genes in the HIV life cycle, including p24 (the HIV long terminal repeat) [20, 21] , vif, nef [19] , tat and rev [22, 23] .\n\nRNAi has been also used in anti-hepatitis C or B virus (HCV, HBV), which causes chronic liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [24^28]. Papadia et al. [28] , using a cell culture system, showed that the siRNAs generated from the HCV replicon could inhibit the HCV mRNA transcripts and protein expression. Those siRNAs could even inhibit HCV cDNA copies and OAS gene expres-sion, which was induced by interferon-K in virus-infected host cells. Recently, McCa\u00a1rey et al. [26] reported that RNAi could be used in a mouse model to inhibit HBV replication.\n\nTo search for a potential therapeutic method to prevent SARS-CoV infection, we adopted RNAi technology based on reported studies in other infectious diseases. In this report, we targeted the Spike protein of SARS-CoV using siRNAs generated from the DNA vector. We demonstrated that the siRNA could e\u00a1ectively and speci\u00a2cally silence gene expression of the Spike protein in SARS-infected cells.\n\nThe vector with a U6 promoter (pBS/U6, a gift from Dr. Yang Shi at Harvard Medical School, Boson, MA, USA) was used to construct a 22 bp siRNAs. The hairpin cDNAs were generated through annealing of the complementary oligos synthesized, where ApaI and EcoRI sites were constructed. The hairpin cDNA insert was subcloned into the pBS/U6 vector through ApaI and EcoRI sites. The clones were veri\u00a2ed by XhoI digestion. Finally the clones were sequence-con-\u00a2rmed.\n\nThe full length cDNA of the Spike protein was subcloned into a pCMV-Myc expression vector (Invitrogen) with BamHI and EcoRI through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) generating restrictive enzymes in the 5P and 3P ends of the insert. The subcloned vector, pCMV-Myc/HA-Spike, was sequence-con\u00a2rmed for the correct frame in the expression vector. pEGFP-N1 was from Clontech Laboratories.\n\nHuman embryonic kidney cell line 293T and African green monkey kidney cell line Vero E6 were cultured in Dulbecco's modi\u00a2ed Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Wg/ml streptomycin. 293T cells were plated onto 6 well plates at a density of 4U10 5 cells per well and cultured at 37 \u2021C with 5% CO 2 overnight for transfection. A total amount of 5 Wg DNA per well was used for transient transfection with CalPhos (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Vero E6 cells were plated onto 12 well plates at a density of 2U10 5 cells per well and cultured at 37 \u2021C with 5% CO 2 overnight. The transfection was performed at 90% cell con\u00a3uence with a total amount of 4 Wg DNA per well using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nSARS-CoV (strain BJ01, GenBank accession number AY278488), provided by the Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, AMMS, China, was propagated on Vero E6 cells. The virus was released from the infected cells by three freeze^thaw cycles. The titration of the virus was determined by plaque assay on Vero E6 cell monolayer. For the test of inhibition of the virus by siRNA, 2U10 5 transfected Vero E6 cells (with siRNA vectors) were infected with 5U10 5 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of SARS-CoV (BJ01), in a \u00a2nal volume of 1 ml of DMEM with 2% FBS for 2 h at 37 \u2021C. Cells were then washed once with phosphate-bu\u00a1ered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), before adding 2 ml complete medium to allow growth for 48 h at 37 \u2021C with 5% CO 2 . All those operations were performed in a bio-safety P3 level lab.\n\nCells overexpressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Spike protein were harvested 48 h post transfection and lysed with 0.3 ml of cold lysis bu\u00a1er (20 mM Tris^HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM NaVO 3 , 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM L-glycerol phosphate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl \u00a3uoride, 5 Wg/ml aprotinin, and 5 Wg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5). 30 Wg of total protein from cell lysate was separated on 6% sodium dodecyl sulfate^polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hyclone ECI, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies directly to HA, enhanced green \u00a3uorescent protein (EGFP) and L-actin, obtained from Santa Cruz, were used to blot the membranes according to the conditions the manufacturer provided. The signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham).\n\nTransfected cells were incubated for about 24 h. Cells were \u00a2xed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were blocked with FDB (PBS with 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 5% normal goat serum, 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h, and were incubated with primary antibodies in FDB for 3 h. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, the cells were incubated with suitable secondary antibodies conjugated with \u00a3uorescent isothiocyanate (TRITC) for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS three times before observation. The results were analyzed using a Nikon TE300 \u00a3uorescence microscope. Pictures were taken with a CCD camera (SPOT, Diagnostic Instrument, USA) equipped with a computer-based image acquisition system.\n\nTotal RNA from the transfected cells or infected cells was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen). The PCR reaction was performed using the One Step RNA PCR kit (Takara, Japan) with 1 Wg of total RNA for each sample. 1 WM of forward primer (5P-TATAGGATCCCAC-CATGTTTATTTTCTTATTATTTCTTAC-3P) and reverse primer (5P-TATAGAATTCTGTGTAATGTAATTTGACACC-3P) was used for the PCR reaction with 25 cycles of denaturation (94 \u2021C, 30 s), annealing (55 \u2021C, 1 min) and extension (68 \u2021C, 4 min). L-Actin (forward primer, 5P-CAAGAGATGGCCACGGCTGCT-3P; reverse primer, 5P-TCCTTCTGCATCCTGTCGGCA-3P) was used as an internal control and the reaction conditions were 25 cycles of denaturation (94 \u2021C, 30 s), annealing (55 \u2021C, 50 s) and extension (68 \u2021C, 1 min).\n\nTotal RNA (10 Wg) from SARS-CoV-infected cells was fractionated on a 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Probe S-gene (1350^1950 bp from ATG from the CDS of the S gene) was labeled with 32 P using the Prime-a-Gene kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hybridization was performed at 68 \u2021C for 2 h in hybridization bu\u00a1er (Promega). Membranes were washed three times in 2USSC with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50 \u2021C and autoradiographed by PhosphorImager (DNA Storm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).\n\nVero E6 cells were infected with 4U10 3 MOI SARS-CoV (BJ01) per well 48 h post transfection with plasmids including pBS/U6, pBS/ U6/GFPi and pBS/U6/S-RNAi1/2. The virus was allowed to infect the cells for 2 h and then was completely withdrawn by washing with PBS. After incubation for 72 h, the cells were lysed and assayed for the level of virus (MOI) in 96 well plates.\n\n3.1. Selection of siRNA target sequences in mRNA of Spike protein The coronavirus Spike protein plays a critical role in virus infection. Therefore, we chose the S gene as a target for inhibition of SARS-CoV infection. To locate the target site of siRNA in the SARS-CoV genome, we selected those sequences of 22 bp with the structure of AGN 18 TT. As an empirical design, we preferably chose the sites with GC/AT ratios between 30% and 60%. Also we used the selected sequences to search GenBank to con\u00a2rm their speci\u00a2city. In matching for those criteria, two speci\u00a2c target sequences were determined and noted, S-RNAi1 and S-RNAi2. A schematic presentation of the sequences is shown in Fig. 1A . Those two targeted sequences in the Spike protein were at 1358^1376 and 30813 099 bp from the \u00a2rst ATG of the cDNA of the gene, which were located in the S1 and S2 region of the protein, respectively.\n\nAlthough siRNA could be chemically synthesized directly, the cDNA vector driven by a promoter is used in most cases [14] for convenience and economy reasons. In this study, we adopted the U6 promoter vector [29] and constructed a 22 bp siRNA through the hairpin, which could be produced by the DNA vector. The hairpin cDNAs were generated through annealing of the complementary oligos synthesized, where ApaI and EcoRI sites were constructed. The hairpin cDNA as an insert was subcloned into pBS/U6 vector through ApaI and EcoRI sites. The correct clones were veri\u00a2ed by XhoI digestion, which was replaced by the insert. Finally, the clones were sequence-con\u00a2rmed. The single-strand hairpin RNAs generated from the vectors were predicted as in Fig. 1C .\n\nTo generate an in vitro expression system of the Spike protein from SARS-CoV, we adopted the mammalian cell culture method. The cDNA encoding the Spike protein from SARS-CoV was constructed into pCMV-Myc, a mammalian expression vector with a CMV promoter, which could drive the expression of the Spike protein in cultured cells. To detect the protein expression, the cDNA of Spike protein was tagged with HA at the C-terminus ( Fig. 2A, top panel) . This construct was transfected into 293T cells and the expression of Spike protein was measured by Western blot. The data showed that the vector could drive the expression of Spike protein of SARS-CoV in the cells at a high level (Fig. 2 , top panel, lane 1) although the molecular weight of the expressed protein ( s 90 kDa) was smaller than the predicted one (105 kDa). To avoid di\u00a1erent transfection e\u2044ciencies, we balanced the total amount of DNA with an EGFP expression vector. The data showed that the EGFP expressions were very even (Fig. 2, bottom panel, lanes 1, 3, and 4) and L-actin level showed equal loading of samples (Fig. 2, middle panel) , suggesting that the transfection experiments were controlled under identical conditions. Taken together, we overexpressed the Spike protein from SARS-CoV in 293T cells, which could be used for the study of the gene silencing in the cultured cells.\n\nTo determine whether the siRNA we generated could e\u00a1ectively reduce the expression of Spike protein in cultured cells, we \u00a2rst transfected the siRNA vectors pBS/U6/S-RNAi1 and pBS/U6/S-RNAi2 into 293T cells where Spike protein was overexpressed. To show the speci\u00a2city of the siRNA targeting, we used EGFP as a control. From the data, it was clearly demonstrated that pBS/U6/EGFP-RNAi could speci\u00a2cally silence the expression of EGFP protein in cells (Fig. 2 , bottom panel, lane 2). However, pBS/U6/S-RNAi1, pBS/U6/S-RNAi2 or the vector alone (pBS/U6) had no e\u00a1ect on EGFP expression (Fig. 2, bottom panel, lanes 1, 3 and 4) . Interestingly, both pBS/U6/S-RNAi1 and pBS/U6/S-RNAi2 could speci\u00a2cally impair the expression of Spike protein in cultured cells (Fig. 2, top panel, lanes 3 and 4) , while pBS/U6/EGFP-RNAi or the vector did not (Fig. 2, top panel, lanes 1 and 2) . Meanwhile, all of the constructs had no e\u00a1ect on L-actin expression (Fig. 2, middle panel) . All these data suggest that siRNA targeting of the Spike protein in SARS-CoV could block or silence the expression of Spike protein in mammalian cells.\n\nTo show the silencing of the Spike protein in transfected cells, we also performed an immunostaining experiment using anti-HA antibody. Similarly, we assessed EGFP expression by using \u00a3uorescence microscopy. The results showed that EGFP proteins were highly expressed in cells transfected with the expression vector in the presence of the co-transfected pBS/ U6 vector (Fig. 3a) , pBS/U6/S-RNAi1 (Fig. 3e) and pBS/U6/ S-RNAi2 (Fig. 3g) , but rarely expressed in cells in the presence of the co-transfected pBS/U6/EGFP-RNAi (Fig. 3c) . In contrast, Spike protein could be detected at levels similar to the EGFP protein in the control panel (Fig. 3a,b) . However, when pBS/U6/S-RNAi1 (Fig. 3f) and pBS/U6/S-RNAi2 (Fig.  3h) respectively were transfected into cells, Spike proteins were shown to be gradually reduced. These data suggest that pBS/U6/S-RNAi1 and pBS/U6/S-RNAi2 signi\u00a2cantly blocked the expression of Spike protein in the cells, indicating that the siRNAs we designed functioned in our mammalian system.\n\nTo verify the inhibition of Spike protein expression by siR-NAs through the inhibition of the S gene, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed. The data show that pBS/U6/S-RNAi1 and pBS/U6/S-RNAi2 reduced the accumulation of mRNA S gene (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4 compared to lane 2) while it had no e\u00a1ect on L-actin mRNA. These data indicate that siRNAs inhibited Spike protein expression through blocking mRNA accumulation.\n\nTo determine whether the vector-based siRNA could e\u2044-ciently prevent SARS-CoV infection of cells, we transfected 2, 3 and 4 Wg of pBS/U6/S-RNAi1 (Fig. 5, lanes 3^5) , and pBS/ U6/S-RNAi2 (Fig. 5, lanes 6^8) into Vero E6 cells in a 12 well plate. As controls, the pBS/U6 vector alone (Fig. 5, lane 1) and pBS/U6/EGFP-RNAi (as a non-related gene RNAi, Fig. 5, lane 2) were also transfected into parallel cells. After incubation for 1 day, the transfected cells were infected with SARS-CoV (BJ01) at 5U10 5 MOI per well with 2U10 5 cells. The cells were harvested and the total RNA was isolated for RT-PCR to measure S gene expression. The data indicate that both pBS/U6/S-RNAi1 and pBS/U6/S-RNAi2 could e\u00a1ectively inhibit gene expression of the Spike protein in the SARS-CoV-infected cells (compare lanes 3 and 6 to lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 5 ). As expected, with the increasing amounts of siRNA transfected, there was increasing inhibition of S gene expression (compare lanes 3^5 and lanes 6^8 in Fig. 5 ). Those data were recon\u00a2rmed by Northern blots (Fig. 6 , same design as Fig. 5) , suggesting that the siRNA we generated could block S gene expression of SARS-CoV in the infected cells.\n\n3.6. siRNA inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV from the infected cells Since SARS-CoV can replicate rapidly in cells we tested the ability of siRNA to inhibit virus production. After 72 h of culture, the virus in the medium of the cells should represent the newly replicated virus in the cells. To validate the siRNA e\u00a1ects on replication of SARS-CoV, we performed virus titration assays by assaying for extracellular virus in infected cells 72 h post infection. The data showed that the control plate had high titers of virus (Fig. 7, lane 1) , suggesting the virus replicated in the cells during the 72 h culture period. In contrast, the virus titer was dramatically decreased in the plate where the cells were transfected with siRNA ( Fig. 7 , lanes 2 and 3), demonstrating that the siRNA inhibited virus replication. Both pBS/U6 and pBS/U6/EGFP-RNAi treatments had similar levels of virus to that of the control, suggesting the RNAi e\u00a1ect was speci\u00a2c.\n\nSARS-CoV has been classi\u00a2ed as a novel member of the coronavirus family with signi\u00a2cantly di\u00a1erent genome sequences [4, 7, 30] . However, the structure of the virus is similar to the other coronaviruses, which contain a spike protein thought to play an important role in viral entry and pathogenesis [9] . In an attempt to prevent and inhibit SARS-CoV replication, we employed RNAi technology, which has been used to silence virus gene expression in HIV and HCV/HBV. In this paper, we provide evidence that a DNA vector-based siRNA could e\u00a1ectively and speci\u00a2cally inhibit gene expression of the Spike protein from SARS-CoV. Initially, we showed that siRNAs silenced the expression of Spike protein in cells transfected with S gene expression vector. Both Western blot and immunostaining experiments consistently suggested that the DNA vectors carrying the siRNA hairpin targeted the overexpressed S gene in cells. We also showed that the mRNA level was decreased when siRNAs were transfected into the cells. This model system demonstrated the inhibition of gene expression of the virus as in the case of inhibition of HIV and HCV/HBV [18,19,21^23,27,28,31^33] .\n\nThe genome sequence revealed SARS-CoV as a novel coronavirus, in which the typical Spike protein and other proteins were predicted. However, there is no report on the isolation and puri\u00a2cation of Spike protein from SARS-CoVinfected cells or tissues. In this report we used the recombinant Spike protein cDNA from the SARS-CoV genome and expressed the protein in 293T cells. The molecular weight of the expressed HA-tagged protein was smaller than the predicted one, suggesting the modi\u00a2cation of Spike protein in mammalian cells. Our data showed that this expression vector could be targeted by the siRNAs. Because there is no anti-Spike protein antibody generated, this is a direct way to detect the inhibition of the protein expression by siRNA in cultured cells.\n\nImportantly, after demonstration that siRNAs inhibited Spike protein expression in cells transfected with the expression vector, we used Vero E6 cells, which were reported to be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection and replication. We infected the cells with SARS-CoV (strain BJ01) and found, through both RT-PCR and Northern blot, that siRNAs could signi\u00a2cantly inhibit S gene mRNA accumulation, suggesting that siRNAs might inhibit SARS-CoV replication in cells. This could be further demonstrated by the evaluation of the virus yields from the cells. We consider that the virus in the medium after 72 h of culture represents newly replicated virus. Therefore, the decreased yields of virus in the medium con-\u00a2rmed that virus replication was inhibited by the siRNAs we designed.\n\nTaken together, we report that the designed siRNA vectors targeting the mRNA of Spike protein from SARS-CoV could speci\u00a2cally and e\u00a1ectively silence gene expression in mammalian cells. This study provides evidence that siRNA could be employed as a potential tool to inhibit gene expression of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV. To our knowledge, this is the \u00a2rst report that siRNA could be used for inhibition of SARS-CoV in cells. Whether those siRNAs could be used in animal models for SARS-CoV infection is under investigation."}
