{"title": "Three-dimensional domain swapping as a mechanism to lock the active conformation in a super-active octamer of SARS-CoV main protease", "body": "SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of the pandemic transmissible disease severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). During the outbreak in 2003, SARS-CoV infected more than 8400 people worldwide with a high fatality rate of about 10% (Chan et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Leng and Bentwich, 2003) . SARS-CoV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, with the 5\u00a2 two-third genome of the virus encoding two overlapping polyproteins pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa). During infection, the two polyproteins are proteolytically processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) required for viral replication and transcription (Snijder et al., 2003) . The proteolytic process is mediated by two virusencoded proteinases, a papain-like proteinase (nsp3) and a 3C-like proteinase (nsp5) (Snijder et al., 2003) . The 3C-like proteinase, also known as the main protease (M pro ), is matured from polyproteins through autocleavage and further cleaves all 11 downstream nonstructural proteins. This makes M pro essential for the viral life cycle, and thus an attractive target for anti-SARS drug development (Anand et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2003 Yang et al., , 2005 .\n\nIt has been reported that SARS-CoV M pro exists in solution as an equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms (Hsu et al., 2005; Graziano et al., 2006a, b) , and only the dimeric form is enzymatically active (Fan et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005 Chen et al., , 2006 Shi and Song, 2006; Chen et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2008; Shi et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2009) . Crystal structures of SARS-CoV M pro revealed a symmetric homodimer which has a similar fold to other reported coronavirus M pro structures (Anand et al., 2002 (Anand et al., , 2003 Yang et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2007) . Each protomer in the dimeric structure contains an N-terminal domain (residues 1-184) with a chymotrypsin-like fold and a unique C-terminal domain (residues 201-303) containing five \u03b1-helices. The substrate binding pocket is located in a cleft of the M pro N-terminal domain with the catalytic dyad consisting of residues His41 and Cys145 (Yang et al., 2003) . The N-terminal residues 1-7 (N-finger) of each protomer are squeezed in between the two protomers and make contacts with both the N-terminal and Cterminal domain of the other protomer (Yang et al., 2003) . Therefore, many studies focused on elucidating the roles of N-finger and the C-terminal domain in the dimerization of M pro (Shi et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005; Wei et al., 2006; Zhong et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2009; Zhong et al., 2009) .\n\nWe have demonstrated that the N-finger is not only critical for the dimerization of SARS-CoV M pro , but also essential for it to form the right quaternary structure which is the enzymatically active form (Zhong et al., 2008) . The M pro Cterminal domain alone (M pro -C) is expressed in E. coli as a stable monomer and a stable dimer in solution, with no apparent exchange (Zhong et al., 2009 ). The stable dimer adopts a novel fold which is characterized by 3D domain swapping with two helices of the two molecules interchange their positions. The N-finger deletion mutant of M pro (M pro -\u03947) can also form a stable dimer due to 3D domain swapping of its C-terminal domain. However, it is not clear whether 3D domain-swapping plays a role in wild-type M pro .\n\nThree-dimensional domain swapping is a special way of protein association to generate stable multimers, by which identical domains from different molecules exchange their positions (Liu and Eisenberg, 2002; Gronenborn, 2009) . In this way, the core tertiary structures of the domain-swapped multimers are similar to those of monomers. Up to date, domain-swapped structures of more than 60 proteins are available in the Protein Data Bank. The biologic roles of 3D domain swapping have been widely discussed and some functions have been elucidated. 3D domain swapping is recognized as a general mechanism for the formation of amyloid fibers which cause conformational diseases (Yamasaki et al., 2008) . HIV-1 capsid dimerization via 3D domain swapping is proposed to be a critical event in immature viral particle assembly (Ivanov et al., 2007) . Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A can oligomerize via 3D domain swapping, and acquires novel biologic functions such as antitumor activity (Libonati et al., 2008) .\n\nHere, we report that fusion of an extension peptide to the N terminus of M pro can also result in the formation of a 3D domain-swapped dimer. After proteolytic removal of the extension peptide, we discovered the existence of a previously unknown active form of mature M pro , which is a stable homo-octamer self-assembled by four domain swapped dimers. Each protomer of the active octamer has exactly the same sequence as the previously well characterized matured form of M pro . Crystal structure reveals that, due to 3D domain swapping, the active conformation is locked in the octamer by forming four active units, each adopting the same conformation as the M pro active dimer. At low protein concentration, the proteolytic activity of the M pro active octamer is much higher than that of M pro active dimer which is in equilibrium with an inactive monomer.\n\nIt has been pointed out that extra residues to the N terminus of mature M pro result in lower dimer ratio and enzymatic activity (Xue et al., 2007) . We constructed an N-terminal extension mutant of M pro (M pro -NE) by fusing a 26-residue peptide to the N terminus of M pro , with an enterokinase cleavage site right in front of the N terminus.\n\nM pro -NE produced in E. coli exists as two forms that can be separated by gel-filtration, with retention volumes of 15.5 mL and 13.7 mL (Fig. 1A) . The apparent molecular weight calculated based on retention volume is 34.5 kDa for the 15.5-mL fraction, and 71.1 kDa for the 13.7-mL fraction. The two forms should correspond to a monomeric form (15.5-mL fraction, M-M pro -NE) and a dimeric form (13.7-mL fraction, D-M pro -NE) of M pro -NE, as the theoretical molecular weights of the M pro -NE monomer is 36.7 kDa. Both forms migrated on an SDS-PAGE gel at the same position as the M pro -NE monomer, with or without DTT, suggesting that the formation of D-M pro -NE is not through a disulfide bond, even though M pro -NE has 12 free cysteine residues. Similar to the N-finger deletion mutant M pro -\u22067, no exchange between monomeric and dimeric forms was observed for days.\n\nMost of the NH peaks in 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra of M-M pro -NE and D-M pro -NE overlap well, suggesting that most parts of the structures are the same between the two forms. Using the same strategy as for characterizing the domainswapped dimer of M pro -\u22067 (Zhong et al., 2008) , we compared 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra of M-M pro -NE and D-M pro -NE with those of the monomer and the domain-swapped dimer of M pro -C (Fig. 2) . It was found that the signature backbone NH peaks of the M pro -C dimer, including those from residues D216, R217, L220, L227, V261, D263, A267, L272, G275, M276, T280 and L282, along with the side-chain NH signal of W218 and the side-chain NH 2 signals of N274 and N277, overlap with those of D-M pro -NE but not M-M pro -NE (Fig. 2) . Vice versa, the signature peaks of the M pro -C monomer from residues mentioned above only overlap with those of M-M pro -NE. This implies that the C-terminal domain of M-M pro -NE has the same fold as M pro -C monomer, while the C-terminal domain of D-M pro -NE adopts the same conformation as the domain-swapped dimer of M pro -C, i.e., D-M pro -NE is also a domain-swapped dimer formed through C-terminal domains of the two molecules.\n\nBoth forms of M pro -NE exhibit some enzymatic activity, though far below that of mature M pro . The initial substrate hydrolysis rates for M-M pro -NE and D-M pro -NE, both at a total protein concentration of 367 \u03bcg/mL, are 15.0 nM/s and 6.3 nM/s, respectively (Fig. 1C ). Since the monomeric form of mature M pro is inactive, M-M pro -NE should be inactive being a monomer. It is most likely that M-M pro -NE need further dimerize in a similar fashion to that of the M pro active dimer to be active. Meanwhile, as D-M pro -NE is a domain-swapped dimer unrelated to the M pro active dimer, dimerization of two D-M pro -NE molecules may also be required for it to adopt an active conformation. Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis confirmed that there is a small fraction of tetramer in D-M pro -NE (D-M pro -NE tetramer), and a small fraction of M-M pro -NE is in a dimeric form (M-M pro -NE dimer) which should be different from D-M pro -NE (Fig. 1B) . In other words, M-M pro -NE exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, while D-M pro -NE exists in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium in solution. The dissociation constant can be calculated from the analytical ultracentrifugation analysis data, and the K d for D-M pro -NE dimer/tetramer is 0.1 mM, while the K d for M-M pro -NE monomer/dimer is 0.8 mM. Therefore, it is estimated that the amount of D-M pro -NE tetramer is about 2 times over that of the M-M pro -NE dimer when the total protein concentration is 367 \u03bcg/mL. This is consistent with the 2-fold difference in the detected enzymatic activity between D-M pro -NE and M-M pro -NE.\n\nThe N-terminal extension peptide of M pro -NE can be completely removed to produce the exact mature M pro through enterokinase digestion. As expected, the retention volume of the mature M pro from M-M pro -NE showed an obvious concentration dependence on a gel filtration column, and its enzymatic activity is dependent on both the protein concentration and the dissociation constant ( Fig. 1D ). Similar methods have been used in previous studies for generating mature M pro (Kuo et al., 2004; Xue et al., 2007; Verschueren et al., 2008) .\n\nSurprisingly, a higher order oligomer is observed after removal of the N-terminal extension peptide from D-M pro -NE, and its retention volume (11.2 mL) is not concentrationdependent, indicating the absence of exchange. The apparent molecular weight calculated based on this retention volume is 271 kDa, which is close to eight times the theoretical molecular weight of M pro (8 \u00d7 33.4 kDa), suggesting that this higher-order oligomer is a homo-octamer.\n\nThis newly identified M pro octamer is also enzymatically active. At a total protein concentration of 16.9 \u00b5g/mL, the initial hydrolysis rate of M pro octamer (0.92 \u03bcM/s) is comparable to that of the previously well-studied form of mature M pro (0.94 \u03bcM/s) that is in equilibrium between an inactive monomer and an active dimer (MD-M pro ). Therefore, we have discovered a previously unknown form of mature M pro , which is a novel active octamer (AO-M pro ). However, in contrast to MD-M pro whose enzymatic activity is dependent on both the enzyme concentration and the dissociation constant, the initial substrate hydrolysis rate of AO-M pro is only linearly dependent on protein concentration. When the total protein concentration is reduced, the activity of MD-M pro decreases much more significantly than that of AO-M pro , and the initial hydrolysis rate of AO-M pro is about 11 times higher than that of MD-M pro at a total protein concentration of 0.68 \u03bcg/mL. Furthermore, below a concentration of 0.34 \u03bcg/mL, the enzymatic activity of MD-M pro is not detectable, while AO-M pro still shows obvious hydrolysis activity (Fig. 1D ). Therefore, we discovered a novel superactive octameric form of mature M pro .\n\nOctameric M pro is assembled due to 3D domain swapping\n\nThe crystal structure of AO-M pro in complex with the previously reported Michael acceptor inhibitor N3 was determined using the molecular replacement (MR) method and refined at 3.2-\u00c5 resolution with a final R work value of 22.0% (R free = 27.2%) (Fig. 3 , PDB code: 3IWM). The crystals belongs to the space group P4 1 2 1 2, and there are four M pro monomers per asymmetric unit, with a Matthews coefficient of 4.04 \u00c5 3 /Da, corresponding to 69.6% solvent content (Matthews, 1968) . The whole homo-octameric AO-M pro comprises two asymmetric units related via a crystallographic twofold axis (Fig. 4C) and possesses a novel \"wheel and axle\" shaped structure with approximate dimensions of 135 \u00c5 \u00d7 115 \u00c5 \u00d7 110 \u00c5 (Fig. 3A) . Together with two other pseudo twofold axes, these features endow the structure with high symmetry.\n\nAO-M pro is a homo-octamer composed of four domainswapped dimer subunits (DSD), which can be divided into two types according to their roles in structural formation: two identical inner DSDs and two identical outer DSDs ( Fig. 3B and 3C). Each DSD adopts a rod-like shape, and is formed by two M pro protomers with the last four helices (residues 227-306) of each C-terminal domain swapped, i.e., the two C-terminal domains within one DSD fold into the same domain-swapped dimer we have reported for M pro C-terminal domain alone (Zhong et al., 2009 ). The two inner DSDs pack against each other at the middle of the swapped C-terminal Assembly of AO-M pro from DSDs. One outer DSD (blue and light blue) and one inner DSD (red and pink) associate into a tetramer, and two tetramers further dimerize through a crystallographic twofold axis to form the octamer. domains which define the axle region, while two N-terminal domains from both inner DSDs form one wheel together with one outer DSD on either side ( Fig. 3A and 3B) .\n\nFor each DSD, the remaining domain consisting of the Nterminal domain of one protomer and the first helix of its Cterminal domain, together with the four swapped helices (swapped domain) from the other protomer, form a monomerlike structural unit (Fig. 3B) . Therefore, a DSD can also be viewed as two monomer-like structural units connected by two hinge loops (residues 214-226) that connect the remaining domain and the swapped domain within one protomer (Supplemental Fig. 1) . The structures of all eight monomer-like structural units are almost identical, and each adopts essentially the same conformation as that of one protomer in the crystal structure of the M pro active dimer (Yang et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2007) . Although the two protomers within one DSD have very similar conformations, structures of the inner DSD protomers differ greatly from those of the outer DSD protomers. While all eight protomers have almost identical structures for the swapped domain and the remaining domain, the difference lies on the relative orientation of the swapped domain toward the remaining domain in each protomer. Specifically, superimposing the remaining domains, the two swapped domains nearly rotate 180\u00b0to each other between the two types of protomers, which is resulted from the conformation difference in the hinge loop region (Fig. 4B) . This difference in protomers leads to the conformational difference between inner and outer DSDs, which is characterized by the difference in the relative orientation for the two monomer-like structural units within one DSD (Fig. 4A) .\n\nOne inner DSD and one outer DSD can associate into a tetramer, in which two monomer-like structural units from both DSDs interact to form an M pro active dimer-like conformation (active unit) (Fig. 3B, 3C and 4C) , and there is no direct contact between the other two \"free\" monomer-like structural units. This may imply that the tetrameric form of D-M pro -NE could adopt a similar structure in solution. Two tetramers form an octamer via a crystallographic two-fold axis, in which the four \"free\" monomer-like structural units form two active units, each consisting of one monomer-like structural unit from an inner DSD of one tetramer and one from an outer DSD of the other tetramer. The four active units in an AO-M pro have almost identical overall folds with a backbone r.m.s deviation of~0.9 \u00c5 for regions of regular secondary structure. Moreover, the conformation of the active unit in AO-M pro is essentially the same as that of M pro active dimer (PDB ID: 2HOB) with a backbone r.m.s deviation of~1.0 \u00c5 for secondary structure regions (Fig. 5A) .\n\nConsistent with the architecture of the octamer, there are eight active sites in AO-M pro , and each one is bound with a Michael acceptor inhibitor N3 in similar conformation and orientation. Comparison of the N3-bound active site conformations between AO-M pro and M pro active dimer (PDB ID: 2HOB) shows that the active site residues of both active forms have very similar conformation, especially those directly interacting with the inhibitor N3 (Fig. 5B ). In addition, inhibitor N3 also binds active sites of AO-M pro and M pro active dimer in similar fashions. All eight active sites are located at the wheel regions of AO-M pro , and each wheel has four active sites. Two of them are located at the axle side of a wheel, while the other two are located at the exterior side of a wheel (Fig. 5C) . The two active sites in one active unit are facing opposite directions. The eight active sites are dispersedly distributed in AO-M pro , and the shortest distance between two active sites is over 40 \u00c5.\n\nOur discovery of AO-M pro indicates that mature M pro actually has at least three different quaternary structure forms: an inactive monomeric form in equilibrium with an active dimeric form (Fan et al., 2004) , and a super-active octameric form (Fig. 6 ). All three forms have exactly the same primary sequence. However, different from the M pro active dimer, AO-M pro is assembled in a very unique way characterized by 3D domain swapping.\n\nIn AO-M pro , the two protomers of each DSD swap their whole C-terminal domains except the first helices, which results in a large binding interface (~5200 \u00c5 2 compared t\u00f5 27,000 \u00c5 2 of overall molecular surface of one DSD) to stabilize the DSD. As a result, two monomer-like structural units connected by hinge loops are formed in each DSD. Meanwhile, two monomer-like structural units from different DSDs form an active unit through the same interactions as those monomer-like structural unit of the M pro active dimer. However, different from M pro active dimer, these interactions occur among four different protomers instead of two for each active unit ( Fig. 3B and 3C) . Therefore, each active unit is connected to two other active units by hinge loops in AO-M pro . All these features stabilize the octamer structure and enable the active conformation to be locked. In addition, flexibility of hinge loops is characteristic of 3D domain swapping, which enables the formation of four active units in AO-M pro . 3D domain swapping is generally regarded as a mechanism for protein oligomerization and aggregation. Here, in SARS-CoV M pro , 3D domain swapping serves as a mechanism to enhance the dimerization affinity for the active conformation formation and enables the enzyme to be locked in the active conformation and to be constantly active, representing a new role of 3D domain swapping in protein functions.\n\nIt has been established that the monomeric form of M pro is inactive, and homo dimerization is required for the enzyme to adopt an enzymatically active conformation. However, activity of the M pro active dimer, which is in equilibrium with the inactive monomer, is dependent on both the enzyme concentration and the dissociation constant. Evidently, a critical concentration threshold must be reached before the active dimer is constantly present. In contrast, the activity of AO-M pro only depends on concentration, and it would remain active once formed. As a result, AO-M pro exhibits significantly higher activity than MD-M pro at low concentrations.\n\nMoreover, as there are four active units and thus eight active sites in AO-M pro and the substrates of M pro have multiple M pro cleavage sites (7 for pp1a and 11 for pp1ab), the interaction between AO-M pro and pp1a/pp1ab could very well be a unique case of polyvalent interaction between enzyme and substrate. Polyvalent interactions are characterized by the simultaneous binding of multiple ligands on one biologic entity (a molecule, a surface, etc) to multiple receptors on another (Mammen et al., 1998) , and have been implicated to play pivotal roles in some important biologic processes, such as cancer metastasis (Cattaruzza and Perris, 2005) , virus and bacterial infections (Mammen et al., 1998) , wound healing (Minor and Peterson, 2002) , chromatin modifications (Ruthenburg et al., 2007) , and transcription regulations (Mammen et al., 1998) . In a polyvalent interaction, the binding affinity between a multivalent ligand and a multiplevalent receptor increases with the increasing number of ligands and receptors. As the eight active sites are dispersedly distributed and are all accessible, it is quite possible for AO-M pro to simultaneously recognize and digest multiple cleavage sites of one polyprotein substrate. Thus, compared to M pro active dimer which has only two active sites, the binding affinity between AO-M pro and its polyprotein substrates could be much higher, with the potential to increase the proteolytic activity of AO-M pro toward pp1a/pp1ab. Furthermore, it was reported that M pro exhibits quite different affinities and activities toward the 11 different M pro cleavage sequences in the polyprotein substrates (Fan et al., 2004) . It is expected that the polyvalent interaction nature and the simultaneous cleavage ability of AO-M pro should significantly increase the affinity and activity of M pro toward low efficiency cleavage sites by decreasing the dissociation rate (k off ) of the enzyme/ substrate complex. In addition, with 8 active sites, it is also possible for AO-M pro to hydrolyze more than one polyprotein substrate at the same time. Therefore, although we have only shown that AO-M pro has higher activity for a single site substrate than M pro active dimer at low protein concentrations, it is theoretically conceivable that the actual activity of AO-M pro toward polyprotein substrates could be even much higher than that of the well-known M pro active dimer with only two active sites.\n\nIn all crystal structures of SARS-CoV M pro , the C terminus is exposed while the N-finger is buried in the dimer interface with several important interactions (Yang et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2005; Tan et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2005; Xue et al., 2007) . Xue et al. (2007) have reported that extra residues to the N terminus of M pro , but not the C terminus, can significantly reduce the activity of SARS-CoV M pro . This is consistent with the low enzymatic activity of M pro -NE we observed, which may imply that mature M pro is quite different from M pro in polyproteins prior to self-cleavage. It has been proposed that M pro has to be activated by auto-cleavage from this inactive polyprotein precursor before it can cleave the polyprotein at other cleavage sites . In a sense, the process for generating mature M pro from M pro -NE is somewhat analogous to that of the M pro maturation process, and AO-M pro matured from D-M pro -NE should be as biologically relevant as the commonly studied forms of the mature M pro .\n\nAlthough we don't have evidence that AO-M pro exists in SARS-CoV infected cells, it can be predicted that AO-M pro should be functionally superior to MD-M pro for SARS-CoV if it does exist, especially during the initial period of infection when the production level of mature M pro is extremely low. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that AO-M pro may play an important role in polyprotein maturation at an early stage of SARS-CoV infection when concentrations of pp1a, pp1b, and mature M pro are extremely low.\n\nSARS-CoV M pro has been extensively investigated via structural and biochemical studies Bartlam et al., 2005; Po-Huang, 2006; Yang et al., 2006) . Almost all these studies are carried out with mature M pro , and little is clearly known about M pro in the viral polyproteins and its maturation process. Recently, Chen et al. reported that two monomeric mutants of M pro can still perform N-terminal autocleavage, while the dimerization of mature protease and trans-cleavage activity following auto-processing are completely lost (Chen et al., 2010) . They proposed that the auto-processing of M pro from polyproteins is through an \"intermediate dimer\" structure which does not strictly depend on the active conformation existing in mature M pro , and the possible \"intermediate dimer\" may be formed through Cterminal domain dimerization. It is of interest to find out whether this \"intermediate dimer\" is related to the M pro -NE domain-swapped dimer we observed. The finding by Chen et al. and our discovery of the super-active octameric form of SARS-CoV main protease indicate that the functional mechanism of this important enzyme may be far more complicated than we thought, and that more studies are necessary to reveal its genuine biologic function mechanism.\n\nTo construct the expression plasmid of M pro -NE, the coding sequence for the mature M pro was amplified by PCR with a forward primer (5\u00a2-GGCCGCCATATGGACGACGACGACAAAAGTGGTTTTAG-GAAAATG-3\u00a2) and a reverse primer (5\u00a2-CGCACGATCTCGAGT-TATTGGAAGGTAACACCAG-3\u00a2). The PCR product was cloned into the pET28a vector between NdeI and XhoI sites. The resulting plasmid encodes M pro -NE which has an extra 26-residue fusion peptide (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMDDDDK) including an enterokinase cleavage site right in front of the N terminus of mature M pro . The plasmid was transformed into the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain for protein production. Cells were grown in LB medium containing 100 \u03bcg/mL of kanamycin at 35\u00b0C until A 600 reached 0.8, and were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. After 8 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10 min. The pelleted cells were suspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer with 300 mM NaCl at pH 8.0 (buffer A), and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C. After cell lysis by sonication and removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 24,000 g for 20 min, the supernatant was applied onto a Ni-NTA column equilibrated with buffer A, and then washed by 50 mM imidazole in buffer A. M pro -NE was eluted with 250 mM imidazole in buffer A and further purified with gel-filtration (Superdex 200 10/300 GL) on an \u00c4KTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (FPLC) (GE, USA) with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT). Thus, M-M pro -NE and D-M pro -NE were completely separated. At a concentration of 1 mg/mL, purified M-M pro -NE or D-M pro -NE was digested by enterokinase in a reaction buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0, 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT) at room temperature for 12 h, and then the mature M pro was purified using Superdex 200 column with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT).\n\nThe sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out with a Beckman Coulter ProteomeLabTM XL-I at the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, China). All AUC runs were carried out at a speed of 50,000 rpm at 16\u00b0C. The sample volume was 400 \u03bcL with a protein concentration of~1 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT). A wavelength of 280 nm was used to record the UV absorption of the cells which were scanned every 5 min for 5 h. The data were analyzed with the SedFit program (version 11.71 from 07/2008).\n\nThe dissociation constant of M-M pro -NE was calculated from the peak area integrals of the monomer (A M ) and dimer (A D ) peaks in AUC analysis data. As the total protein concentration (c) is known, the monomer concentration can be calculated using equation M = c/(1 + A D /A M ), and the dimer concentration can be calculated as D = c/2(1 + A M /A D ). Therefore, the dissociation constant can be calculated as K d = M 2 /D. The dissociation constant between D-M pro -NE dimer and tetramer was calculated in the same way.\n\nThe enzymatic activity was determined by the peptide cleavage assay using a peptide substrate with a sequence of MCA-AVLQSGFR-Lys (Dnp)-Lys-NH 2 (more than 95% purity; GL Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd.). The reaction was monitored with a Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 25\u00b0C using wavelengths of 320 nm and 405 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The reaction was initiated by adding varied concentrations of enzyme to a 600 \u03bcL system containing 60 \u00b5M substrates with the reaction buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT. When the enzyme concentration is less than 0.34 \u00b5g/mL, the reaction was recorded for 10 min. Initial hydrolysis rates were calculated by linearly fitting the linear portion of the data using Microsoft Office Excel 2003. For mature M pro , enzyme activities were measured for concentrations range from 0.17 to 3.4 \u00b5g/mL, and the apparent dimer-monomer dissociation constant K d values were obtained by fitting the plot of reaction rate versus enzyme concentration to the following equation, assuming the dimer is active and the monomer is inactive:\n\nIn the equation, v is the observed hydrolysis rate, A is the hydrolysis rate of the active dimer, and c is the total protein concentration.\n\nNMR sample preparation and NMR spectroscopy E. coli cells were allowed to grow in M9 minimal medium prepared with D 2 O, containing 15 N-labeled ammonium chloride (Marley et al., 2001) . The uniformly 15 N, 2 H-labeled D-M pro -NE and M-M pro -NE proteins were purified by the abovementioned methods. NMR samples of D-M pro -NE and M-M pro -NE were at a concentration of about 1 mM, with a buffer containing 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA, 0.03% NaN 3 , in 90% H 2 O/10% D 2 O, plus Complete, an EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Germany).\n\nAll 2D NMR experiments were performed at 298 K on a Bruker Avance 800 MHz spectrometer. NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995) , and analyzed using NMRView (Johnson and Blevins, 1994) . The chemical shift in the 1 H dimension was referenced directly to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid (DSS), whereas the chemical shifts in the 15 N dimensions were indirectly referenced to DSS (Wishart et al., 1995) .\n\nThe freshly prepared protein was incubated with inhibitor N3 with a molar ratio of 1:1 at 4\u00b0C and then concentrated to 30 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.0). Crystallization was performed by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method at 16\u00b0C in 48-well plates. The initial crystallization conditions were screened using Hampton Research Crystal Screen Kits (Hampton Research Corporation). One microliter of the protein solution was mixed with 1 \u03bcL reservoir solution and equilibrated against 100 \u03bcL reservoir solution. Small crystals could be found in several conditions within three days. A series of crystallization grids was used to optimize the crystallization condition at 18\u00b0C using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method by mixing 1 \u00b5L AO-M pro protein in the storage buffer with an equal volume of the reservoir solution containing 0.2 M sodium chloride, 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 5.5) and 25% (w/v) PEG3350. Fine shaped and good quality crystals (size~30\u00d750\u00d7200 \u03bcm) suitable for data collection appeared in 14 d and were soaked in a cryo-protectant solution consisting of 4 M sodium formate. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then transferred into a dry nitrogen stream at 100K for X-ray diffraction data collection.\n\nA 3.2 \u00c5 resolution diffraction data set was collected at 100 K from a single AO-M pro crystal using an ADSC Q270 detector on the BL17A beamline at Photon Factory, KEK (Japan). A total of 360 frames of data were collected with 0.5\u00b0oscillation width. Processing of diffraction images and scaling of the integrated intensities were performed using the HKL2000 software package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) . The crystal belongs to space group P4 1 2 1 2, with unit cell parameters a = b = 161.9 \u00c5, c = 166.4 \u00c5, a = b = g = 90\u00b0. We assumed that there are four M pro molecules in the asymmetric unit, corresponding to a Matthews coefficient of 1.92 and solvent content of 37% (Matthews, 1968) . Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement with PHASER (McCoy et al., 2007) with the crystal structure of SARS-CoV main protease (PDB code: 2H2Z) as the search model. The final manual structure rebuilding and refinement were performed in COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) , Refmac (Murshudov et al., 1997) and Phenix (Adams et al., 2002) with the guidance of the 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc density maps. During the later stages of positional refinement, restraints were relaxed and a bulk solvent correction was applied under the guidance of R free . Model geometry was verified using the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) . Final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 . Figures were created by using MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996) .
