{"title": "", "body": "Monoclonal antibodies produced by hybrid cell lines have been raised, against the New World species of Leishmania (see MCMAHON-PRATT & DAVID, 1981) . They have been used, in particular, to identify the subspecies of L. braziliensis (see MCMAHON-PRATT et al., 1982) . Recent studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies could kill parasites cultured within macrophages in vitro. Such induced mortalitv has been recoidedin one series of experiments with i. major, a pathogenic agent of Old World leishmaniasis (HANDMAN & HOCKING, 1982) .\n\nComplete protection against L. mexicana ama-zoner& protiastigotes inoculated with monoclonal antibodies has been similarly obtained in viva, using a Winn assay system (ANDERSON et aE., 1983) .\n\nThe data piesented here show that a single monoclonal antibodv is able to orotect the BALBk mouse from infection with eithe; L. major or L. mexicana amazonensis .\n\nMonoclonal antibodies were produced as described else-\n\nwhere (ROSETO et al., 1982; MONJOUR et al., 1984b) . We used a .Leishmania s&in isolated in Greece, L. infantum (LEM 497, Montpellier Collection), from the bone marrow of a sick dog and injected into a hamster. The amastigotes from the hamster spleen were deposited in a liquid medium (RPM1 1640 medium supplemented with 20% foetal calf serum) and after transformation into promastigotes at 24\"C, the parasites were passaged not more than twice in the nutrient broth. Promastigote preparations were used to immunize three BALBic female mice two months old and serologically negative for Leishmania. Each animal was injected three parasues '+\"'l? pg of Quil A purified Saponin (Laboratories times? 15 days subcutaneously with lo6\n\nSuperfos, Denmark). One month later the mouse with the highest anti-leishmanial titre was given a booster injection of 2 x 10' promastigotes administered intraperitoneally four days before cell fusion. Spleen cells were mixed with immunoglobulin-non-secreting, &azaguanine-resistant S~2/0 mveloma cells (SHULMAN et al., 1978) and fused with 5& poliethylene gly'col, following the technique described by GALFRE et al. (1977) . Fused cells were selected in a hypoxanthine/azaserine (HA) selective medium.\n\nThe screening of cell culture supematants was performed by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) (MONJOUR et al., 1978) . L. infanturn (LEM 497), L. major and L. m. amazonensis were used as antigens. Mouse and human anti-leishmanial sera, normal sera and RF'MI medium were used as controls.\n\nPositive hybridoma cultures were cloned using the limiting dilution technique and mink CCL64 cells (American Type Culture Collection) as feeder cells. The supernatants of erowine clones were rescreened bv IIF. 104 clones oroved to &Z po&ve and 10 were selected which had high-antibody titres (> 3200). Specificity of the monoclonal antibodies secreted by these ten clones was determined by an indirect immunofluorescence test (as described by DE IBARRA et al., 1982) Large quantities of antibodies were obtained by intraperitoneal injection of 2 x lo6 hybridoma cells into pristanetreated BALBK mice. Two weeks later ascitic fluids were recovered.\n\nIgG classes were determined by the immunodiffusion method.\n\nOne ascitic fluid (64B16 : IgGzb) which proved to be positive by IIF with L. infanturn (LEM 497), L. major (LEM 129) and L. m. amazonensis (LV79) was used for assays of protection in vivo. 50 ~1 of monoclonal-antibody ascites were mixed with lo6 promastigotes of either L. major or L. m. amazonensis. These mixtures were maintained at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and then injected subcutaneously near the root of the tail of BALBic female mice. When the monoclonal antibody-promastigote mixture was observed by microscopy before the injections, viability of promastigotes, based on motility, was approximately 95%.\n\nMany controls were used under the same conditions, namely decomplemented (30 min-56\u00b0C) monoclonal antibody containing ascites: mouse ascites devoid of monoclonal antibodies and non-reactive in IF1 with L. infantum (LEM 497), L. major and L. m. amazonensis, anti-Plasmodium falciparum, anti-HBS monoclonal antibody containing ascites and ascites induced by injection of Sp2/0 myeloma cells. Simultaneously, experimental infections were induced in control mice using either L. major or L. m. amazonensis to confirm infectivity of the parasites. The Results Before the protective immunity assay, we examined the monoclonal antibodies with respect to their isotype and their target antigens. Most belonged to the IgG isotype IgGi and the others to IgGzb. Based on observation of strong fluorescent labelling of the L. major and L. m. amazonensis live promastigote surfaces, we selected one monoclonal antibody (64B16 : isotype Ig2b) as potentially protective. Fig.  1 indicates that pre-treatment of the two Leishmania species, with 64B16 abolished their capacity to induce Fig. 1 : Cutaneous leishmaniasis. The promastigote strains have been pretreated with a ant,-Ltzshmanta iA1 monoclonal antibody, and a control monoclonai antibody (Bi. a cutaneous infection. Ascitic fluid containing monoclonal antibodies against P. falciparum and HBS, whether decomplemented or not, did not prevent the experimental infection. Complete protection was observed for over three months even though as many as lo6 promastigotes were injected (Table I) . Lesions appeared in controls two months after infection.\n\nLesion size was between 0.25 and 0.5 cm at three months and over 0.5 cm when the animal died about six months after infection. Using Giemsa staining, it was confirmed that the lesions were due to leishmaniasis.\n\nAs seen in another in viva system described elsewhere (MONJOUR et al., 1984a) anti-leishmanial monoclonal antibodies raised against an Old World strain can afford protection against New World Leishmania including L. donovani. This cross protection has been confirmed by these data using L. major or L. m. amazunensis and BALBic female mice for the protective immunity assay.\n\nRecent studies proved that antibodies could be important in the development of immunity to leishmaniasis. They abolished the capacity of L. major to multiply within macrophages in vitro (HANDMAN & HOCKING) 1982), and provided protection against L. mexicana mfections in mice (ANDERSON et al., 1983) .\n\nIn our experiments, we demonstrate that a single monoclonal antibody raised against L. infantum can prevent the development of one strain of L. major and one of L. mexicana amazonensis.\n\nThe mechanisms conferring possible resistance to Leishmania infections have frequently been discussed. This disease was considered to be controlled by cell-mediated immunity (MAUEL & BEHIN, 1981) .\n\nRecent studies suggested that additional co-operation with humoral antibody could play an important part in effective protection (ARRENDONDO-& PEREZ, 1979; ALEXANDER & PHILLIPS, 1980) . Furthermore, HOWARD et al. (1982) in prophylactic immunization against experimental leishmaniasis noted that antibody response may be crucial in resistance to the infection. They considered that the development of cell-mediated immunity in immunization might not be necessary. At the present time, as did HANDMAN & HOCKING (1982) and ANDERSON et al. (1983) , we report that antibodies, when used in an in vitro or an in vivo system, can abolish the development of parasites. The role of the complement (C') in this effect is controversial. It has been proved that antibody + C' caused the lysis of promastigotes (ADLER, 1964) . In our own experiments, decomplemented monoclonal antibody ascites were not able to prevent Leishmania infections. However, ANDER-SON et al. (1983) using one antibody of isotype IgG, suggests that the mechanism of this antibody-mediated protection may be C' independent. Finally, according to HANDMAN & HOCKING (1982) , isotype IgG,b promotes L. major killing in vitro and isotypes IgGra or IgGs are cytotoxic to promastigotes in the presence of complement. These last observations have to be confirmed in several in vivo systems to distinguish the mechanism by which these antibodies are protective. Their use may allow the identification of the Leishntania antigens inducing effective immunity."}
