{"title": "A VLP vaccine for epidemic Chikungunya virus protects non-human primates against infection", "body": "We synthesized plasmids encoding structural polyproteins C, E1, E2, E3 and 6K (strains 37997 and LR2006 OPY-1, GenBank EU224270 and EU224268, respectively) as previously described14 (GeneArt). We amplified plasmids encoding the polyproteins E3, E2, 6K, and E1 by PCR using sense primer 5\u2032-GCTCTAGACACCATGAGCCTCGCCCTCCCGGTCTTG-3\u2032 and antisense primer 5\u2032-TGGATCCTCATTAGTGCCTGCTAAACGACA-3\u2032 (37997) and sense primer 5\u2032-GCTCTAGACACCATGAGTCTTGCCATCCCAGTTATG-3\u2032 and antisense primer 5\u2032-TGGATCCTCATTAGTGCCTGCTGAACGACA-3\u2032 (LR2006 OPY-1). We inserted XbaI and BamHI sites for cloning. We digested each fragment with XbaI/BamHI and inserted it into a eukaryotic expression vector, CMV/R14 (C-E37997, C-EOPY-1, E37997 and EOPY-1). The CMV/R vector comprises the human CMV IE enhancer/promoter, an HTLV-1 R region containing a splicing donor, a CMV IE splicing acceptor and bovine growth hormone poly A signal.\n\nWe created lentiviral vectors expressing glycoproteins from different CHIKV strains. The method for producing recombinant lentiviral vectors expressing a luciferase reporter gene has been previously described12,14. Briefly, we cotransfected 293T cells with 500 ng CHIKV E plasmid from either strain (E37997 or EOPY-1), 7 \u03bcg of a transducing vector encoding a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a CMV promoter (pHR\u2019CMV-luciferase plasmid), and 7 \u03bcg of a packaging plasmid that expresses all human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) structural proteins except envelope (pCMV\u0394R8.2) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Additional methods and neutralization assay with CHIKV E pseudotyped lentiviral vectors are described in the Supplementary Methods.\n\nWe transfected 293F cells (2.5 \u00d7 108) (Invitrogen) with 293fectin transfection reagent (Invitrogen) and 125 \u03bcg of C-E37997 plasmid following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Detailed methods for buoyant density gradient analysis and purification of VLPs have been described in a previous publication32 and in the Supplementary Methods.\n\nWe flash-froze Chikungunya VLPs on holey grids in liquid ethane, and recorded images at 47K magnification with a CM300 FEG microscope with electron dose levels of approximately 20 e\u2212/\u00c52. We digitized all micrographs at 6.35 \u03bcm per pixel using a Nikon scanner, and boxed individual particle images using the program e2boxer in the EMAN2 package33. We used the CTFIT program from the EMAN package34 to determine CTF parameters and flip phases. We constructed an initial model in EMAN using assigned 2-, 3-, and 5-fold views and refined it in EMAN assuming icosahedral symmetry. The number of particles incorporated into the final reconstruction was 1489, giving a final resolution of 18 \u00c5 based on a 0.5 Fourier shell correlation threshold.\n\nWe mixed 19 \u03bcg of VLPs (equivalent to approximately 10 \u03bcg of E1/E2) in 60 \u03bcl normal saline with 60 \u03bcl of Ribi solution (Sigma Adjuvant system, Sigma-Aldrich) per mouse. We injected female 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice in the right and left quadriceps muscles with VLPs in normal saline or Ribi in 120 \u03bcl total volume, two times at weeks 2 and 6. For DNA vaccination, we injected mice in the right and left quadriceps with a total of 15 \u03bcg of purified plasmid C-E37997, E37997, C-EOPY-1 or EOPY-1 suspended in 100 \u03bcl of normal saline three times at weeks 0, 3 and 6. Each group contained five mice. We collected sera and spleen 10 days after the last injection. In monkey experiments, we injected 3\u20134 year old rhesus macaques weighing 3\u20134 kg intramuscularly in the anterior quadriceps with either 20 \u03bcg of VLPs in 1 mL PBS (VLP group) or 1 mL PBS alone (control group) at weeks 0, 4 and 24. Each group contained six monkeys. To measure antibody titers, we collected blood on days \u221214, 0, 10, 28, 38, 56, 70, 161 and 178. We challenged the monkeys (n=3 per group, randomly selected from each group) with 1010 PFU of CHIKV (strain LR2006 OPY-1) 15 weeks after the final immunization by intravenous injection. We collected blood to measure viremia at 0, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 hours, and sacrificed the monkeys 168 h after challenge. All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee, VRC, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/vrc) in accordance with relevant federal guidelines and regulations.\n\nWe used a HiTrap\u2122 Protein G HP column (GE Healthcare) and a Melon Gel IgG Purification Kit (Pierce) for antibody purification. We dialyzed purified IgG three times against PBS. We administered 2 mg of purified IgG (from approximately 200 \u03bcl of serum) into each recipient IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2R-/- mouse by tail vein injection 24 h before challenge. The challenge consisted of 30 PFU of CHIKV (strain LR2006 OPY-1), administered by intradermal injection.\n\nAll results are expressed as means \u00b1 s.e.m. We analyzed the data with unpaired two-tailed t tests (Prism 5).\n\nAdditional methods are described in the Supplementary Methods."}
