{"title": "Interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin treatment improves outcome in MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques HHS Public Access Author manuscript", "body": "rhesus macaque model. Treated animals did not develop breathing abnormalities and showed noto-very mild radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Moreover, treated animals showed reduced levels of systemic (serum) and local (lung) proinflammatory markers in addition to reduced viral genome copies, altered gene expression and less severe histopathological changes in the lungs. Taken together, these data suggest that treatment of MERS-CoV infected rhesus macaques with IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin reduces virus replication, moderates the host response and improves clinical outcome. As these two drugs are already used in combination in the clinic, IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin should be considered for management of MERS-CoV cases.\n\nMERS-CoV is the first lineage C betacoronavirus known to infect humans 7 . Similar to SARS, infection can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome with multi-organ dysfunction 8 . The rapid identification of therapeutics for MERS-CoV is a high priority as there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine. A meta-analysis of data from the SARS outbreak concluded that at best the benefit of different treatment strategies 9-17 was inconclusive 18 . Recently, we have demonstrated in vitro that the antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b12b against MERS-CoV is augmented by the concomitant use of ribavirin and that when combined, effective concentrations were clinically achievable 6 . Here we evaluate the effectiveness in vivo of combination IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin treatment, in an attempt to identify a therapeutic approach that can be immediately implemented in the clinic for MERS-CoV cases.\n\nTwo groups of three rhesus macaques were infected with 7 \u00d7 10 6 tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID 50 ) of MERS-CoV (hCoV-EMC/2012 8 ) as previously described 2 Table 1 ). The appearance of breathing abnormalities was supported by evidence of decreased oxygen saturation in untreated animals (2-5% decrease from baseline) (Fig. 1c) . Significantly increased white blood cell counts were noted in untreated animals on 1 dpi, returning to normal levels on subsequent days (Fig. 1d) . The increase in white blood cells was mainly attributed to a significant increase in neutrophils (Fig. 1e) . In contrast, treated animals did not show evidence of increased respiration, piloerection or decreased oxygen saturation levels, nor significant changes in hematology (Fig. 1d,e) . To monitor signs of pneumonia animals underwent daily x-rays. Radiographs from treated animals remained normal on 1 dpi and showed at most light infiltration in a single lobe on 2-3 dpi. In contrast, untreated animals showed evidence of increasing amounts of interstitial infiltration between 1 and 3 dpi ranging from localized (single lobe) to diffuse severe pulmonary interstitial infiltration throughout the lungs ( Fig. 2 ; Supplemental Table 2 ).\n\nUpon necropsy, gross pathology revealed lungs that were normal in appearance in all treated animals (Fig. 3a, left) . In contrast, lungs from untreated animals were firm, edematous, failed to collapse (Fig. 3b , middle) and contained gross lesions with a mean affected area of 14.3% (Fig. 3a , right; Supplemental Table 3 ). Multifocal consolidation and dark red discoloration, consistent with interstitial pneumonia, was most prevalent on the dorsal surface of the lung of untreated animals. No other pathological changes were observed at necropsy.\n\nQuantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine viral loads as TCID 50 equivalents in tissues, fluids and swabs 19 . There was no detectable viral RNA in the blood at any time point or in urine taken at necropsy. Daily bronchial alveolar lavage samples showed similar viral loads between groups (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). With the exception of the oronasopharynx in treated animals, all respiratory tract tissues collected at necropsy were positive for MERS-CoV by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3b ). Viral RNA was also absent from the tonsils, spleen and kidney of treated animals, but was present in two of three untreated animals. In all of the tissues analyzed, with the exception of left middle lobe lung specimens, the viral loads were lower in specimens from treated versus untreated animals. When the values from all lung specimens were combined, the mean viral load in treated animals was 0.81-log lower than in untreated animals (p=0.0428, unpaired ttest, one tail), demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in virus replication throughout the lung (Fig. 3b , inset).\n\nAll animals developed some degree of pulmonary pathology with multifocal, mild-tomarked, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, predominantly centered on the terminal bronchioles ( Fig. 3c,d) . However, untreated rhesus macaque (RM) 4 and 5 showed moderate-to-marked lesions with abundant alveolar edema, fibrin with formation of hyaline membranes and small-to-moderate numbers of macrophages (Fig. 3d , middle, right); a lesion severity not observed in the treated animals (Fig 3c, middle, right; Supplemental Table 3 ). Only untreated animals showed significant scoring for perivascular infiltrates within and adjacent to affected areas of the lung (Fig. 3d , left) (p<0.001, Mann-Whitney). Increased numbers of neutrophils were observed in lungs of untreated animals (9.3% compared to 6.1%) (Fig. 3e ).\n\nSerum IFN-\u03b1 levels were monitored to assess the delivery of IFN-\u03b12b. Treated animals had at least 2.3 times the level of IFN-\u03b1 of untreated animals (1 and 3 dpi), while on 2 dpi, treated animals had 37 times the level of untreated animals (Supplemental Fig. 2 ), likely reflecting the timing of IFN-\u03b12b administration in relation to blood collection. Untreated animals showed evidence of an interferon response on 1 and 2 dpi with a mean of 190 and 103 pg/ml, respectively; however, IFN-\u03b1 was undetectable by 3 dpi. Treated animals did not show alterations in systemic (serum) interleukin (IL)-2, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA), IL-6, IL-15 and IFN-\u03b3 observed in untreated animals (Supplemental Fig.3 ). Elevated local levels of IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and MCP-1 were also observed in homogenate from lung tissue collected on 3 dpi from untreated compared to treated animals (Supplemental Fig. 3 ) indicating a tissue-specific host response to infection, moderated by treatment.\n\nThe effect of treatment on the lung transcriptome was analyzed by microarray of RNA extracted from the right lower lobe (RLL). A singular value decomposition coupled multidimensional scaling (SVD-MDS) analysis, providing an overall view of the transcriptome, was performed with addition of control lung tissue from na\u00efve rhesus macaques (Fig. 4a) . Comparison of group means (open circles) revealed a clear separation of the treated versus untreated lung RLL samples; treated and untreated samples were also separated from uninfected, untreated control samples, indicating that treatment induces unique transcriptional changes. Using a relaxed p-value cutoff (p<0.05), we observed 966 differentially expressed genes (DEG) (Supplemental Table 4 ), many associated with innate antiviral processes induced by IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin. This included type 1 and 3 IFN, pattern recognition receptors and interferon-induced with helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1, or MDA5), effector molecules and associated signal transducers. Comparison of uninfected, untreated animals to treated and untreated, infected animals revealed a reduction in inflammatory genes in treated animals suggestive of milder disease (Supplemental Fig. 5 ).\n\nTo elucidate the mechanism by which treatment reduces inflammation and disease during MERS-CoV infection, we sought to identify DEG that are not associated with known IFNstimulated gene induction programs. By examining the 205 DEG identified using a more stringent p-value cutoff (p<0.01) ( Fig. 4b ; Supplemental Table 5 ) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis we identified many genes that were down-regulated in untreated animals. Many of these were associated with hedgehog signaling (Fig. 4c) , a pathway involved in respiratory morphogenesis and vascularization [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] and potentially involved in inflammatory injury 26 . In treated animals, we observed up-regulation of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and subsequent down-regulation of genes associated with cell proliferation (Supplemental Table 5 ). SHH, the priming protein of the hedgehog pathway, and the associated molecule GLI family zinc finger 1 (GLI1) have been shown to block injurious responses in the pulmonary vasculature induced by multiple types of inflammatory and stress stimuli [27] [28] [29] [30] . Consistent with reduced inflammation, reduction in cellular infiltrates and the lack of perivasculitis in the lungs of treated animals, the upregulation of SHH suggests that the hedgehog pathway regulates the host response to protect the lung from potentially injurious inflammation.\n\nRhesus macaques treated with IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin 8 hours post-MERS-CoV infection, showed improved clinical parameters with no breathing abnormalities and little evidence of pneumonia by x-ray. In addition, treated animals showed both reduced systemic and local levels of proinflammatory markers. Lung tissues collected on 3 dpi showed a significant reduction in viral genome copies, the absence of gross lesions and less severe histopathological changes in treated animals. Microarray analysis of the lung supported the success of treatment and identified the hedgehog signaling pathway as a putative contributor to decreased lung damage. These data suggest that treatment of MERS-CoV infected rhesus macaques with IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin improves outcome of infection.\n\nIFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin treatment would be expected to provide the greatest benefit early in infection; however, the prolonged disease course in humans 8, 31 suggests the treatment window may be considerably longer. The reduced disease severity in the rhesus macaque model, which appears to recapitulate mild-to-moderate human MERS-CoV cases, makes it difficult to extrapolate the outcome of this treatment in severe human cases. Thus, it is currently unknown whether initiation of treatment upon progression to severe respiratory illness would have any benefit, a situation faced in many acute infectious diseases. Additional therapeutics should be evaluated; however, given the severity and poor outcome of MERS-CoV infection, combined IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin therapy should be considered as an early intervention therapy for MERS-CoV.\n\nAll infectious work with MERS-CoV was approved by the RML Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and performed in a high containment facility at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH). IBC approved standard operating procedures were applied for all infectious work.\n\nVero cells (African green monkey kidney) were maintained at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin. MERS-CoV (isolate hCoV-EMC/ 2012) 8 was subsequently propagated on Vero cells using DMEM as above with 2% FBS (complete DMEM).\n\nAll animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories and performed following the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALAC) by certified staff in an AAALAC approved facility. We inoculated six healthy rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), aged 4-6 years, with a total of 7 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV by combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular routes as previously established 33,2 . Animals were randomly assigned to either the treated or untreated group in a non-blinded manner.\n\nTreatment was initiated at 8 h post-infection. The initial ribavirin (MP Bioscience) loading dose (30 mg/kg) was delivered intravenously; subsequent doses (10 mg/kg) were delivered every 8 h intramuscularly. Interferon-\u03b12b, as IntronA (Merck) (5 MIU/kg) was delivered subcutaneously every 16 h. Three animals received IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin (treated), while three animals received sham treatment (untreated) by the same routes with a comparable volume/kg of sterile saline. The animals were monitored three times daily through clinical scoring and/or examinations as described previously 32 . Clinical examinations included daily ventral-dorsal and lateral x-rays, body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, pulse oximetry, venous bleeding, bronchoalveolar lavage and collection of swabs from nasal and oral mucosa. A board-certified veterinarian interpreted the radiographic data. On 3 dpi all animals were necropsied and conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, tonsil, oronasopharynx, mandibular lymph node, salivary gland, trachea, right bronchus, left bronchus, all six lung lobes, mediastinal lymph node, inguinal lymph node, axillary lymph node, mesenteric lymph node heart, liver, spleen, kidney and urinary bladder were collected for virological and histopathological assays.\n\nHematological analysis was carried out following standard protocols. The total white blood cell count, lymphocyte, platelet, reticulocyte, and red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit values, mean cell volume, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations were determined from EDTA blood with the HemaVet 950FS+ laser-based hematology analyzer (Drew Scientific).\n\nSamples from all lung lobes were weighed and subsequently homogenized in 400 \u03bcl of Bio-Plex cell lysis buffer (BioRad) with a stainless steel bead on the Qiashredder (Qiagen). Debris was pelleted and the supernatant removed. Both serum and tissue samples were inactivated with 5 MRads \u03b3-radiation according to standard operating procedures. The total protein concentration in the tissue homogenate was determined with the DC Protein Assay \n\nTissues were placed in cassettes and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 7 days. Subsequently, tissues were processed with a Sakura VIP-5 Tissue Tek, on a 12 h automated schedule, using a graded series of ethanol, xylene, and ParaPlast Extra. Embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 \u03bcm and dried overnight at 42\u00b0C prior to staining. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Specific anti-CoV immunoreactivity was detected using a polyclonal rabbit antibody against hCoV-EMC/2012 at a 1:1000 dilution. Tissues were also stained with a myeloperoxidase-specific antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The tissues were then processed for immunohistochemistry using the Discovery XT automated processor (Ventana Medical Systems) with a DAPMap (Ventana Medical Systems) kit., scanned with the Aperio ScanScope XT (Aperio Technologies, Inc.) and the entire section analyzed with the ImageScope Positive Pixel Count algorithm (version 9.1).\n\nRNA from AVL-treated blood and RLT-treated tissues were extracted with the QiaAmp Viral RNA and the RNeasy kits, respectively (Qiagen). qRT-PCR using primers and probe previously described 19 were performed on the RotorGene Q (Qiagen). A 10-fold dilution series of viral RNA based on TCID 50 equivalents was used as a standard. For microarray analysis lung homogenates were stored at -80\u00b0 C in equal volumes RLT buffer (Qiagen) and 70% ethanol until preparation. Samples were thawed and two additional volumes of RLT buffer with 0.01 volumes of 2-mercaptoethanol were added, followed by an additional two volumes of 70% ethanol. RNA was then extracted using RNeasy spin columns per the manufacturer's protocol. Low yield samples were concentrated using the RNA Clean and Concentrator (Zymo Research). Probe labeling was carried out using the Agilent Low Input processing protocol, and hybridized to Agilent Rhesus macaque 4\u00d744K microarrays (Agilent Technologies) using the manufacturer's one-color analysis protocol.\n\nFor comparisons of differentially expressed genes (DEG) in infected lungs of both interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin-treated and untreated animals, raw array data was uploaded to Genedata Analyst 7.6 (Genedata). Data was normalized using the quantile normalization method, and the log 10 ratio expression was calculated relative to the mean probe values of the three untreated animals. Statistically significant DEG were determined using Welch's ttest (p<0.01, fold change \u2265 1.5). Hierarchical clustering of DEG was performed by the unweighted average method (Unweighted Pair Group with Arithmetic Mean; UPGMA) using Spotfire DecisionSite 9.1.1 (Tibco). Analysis of functional enrichment was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems).\n\nFor measures of gene expression dynamics, the array data were normalized using NeONORM 34 and subjected to SVD-MDS analysis 35 . In parallel, the data for each individual were merged using weighted averages to generate combined profiles. These were visualized using SVD-MDS.\n\nRaw microarray data are deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession number GSE47957) and are also available to the public at http:// viromics.washington.edu.\n\nWith the exception of the data from microarray experiment, data was analyzed in Prism (GraphPad Software) using the unpaired t-test, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post-test and the Mann Whitney test as indicated.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
