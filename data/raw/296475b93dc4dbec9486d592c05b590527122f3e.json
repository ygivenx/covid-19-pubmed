Ubiquitin is attached to substrate proteins by the coordinated action of ubiquitin-activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and ligating (E3) enzymes and removed by a family of proteases known as deubi-quitinating enzymes (DUBs). The first recognized role of the ubiquitin system was controlling protein turnover (Ciechanover et al., 1980; Hershko et al., 1980) . Ubiquitin tags are also responsible for signaling a wide range of non-degradative functions. Ubiquitination can affect protein activity by modulating conformational changes, complexation with other proteins (Ea et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006) , susceptibility to addition of other post-translation modifications including phosphorylation and acetylation (Hunter, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2008) , and cellular localization (Li et al., 2003) . Through combined degradative and nondegradative functions, ubiquitination coordinates a wide range of cellular processes including proteolysis (Ciechanover et al., 2000) , DNA repair (Jackson and Durocher, 2013), chromatin remodeling (Weake and Workman, 2008), receptor signaling (Haglund and Dikic, 2012) , and immunity (Malynn and Ma, 2010; Zinngrebe et al., 2014) , among others. Not surprisingly, aberrant ubiquitin system activity is linked to disease, including cancer (Hoeller and Dikic, 2009; Pinto-Fernandez and Kessler, 2016) , infection (Isaacson and Ploegh, 2009; Maculins et al., 2016) , and neurodegeneration (Ciechanover and Brundin, 2003; Ciechanover and Kwon, 2015) . The relationship between ubiquitin and cancer biology has been clinically validated by Food and Drug Administration approval of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib for multiple myeloma (Kane et al., 2003) .\n\nThere are approximately 100 human DUBs belonging to six distinct families, five of which (ubiquitin-specific protease [USP] , ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase [UCH] , ovarian tumor protease [OTU] , Josephin, and Mindy) are cysteine proteases, while the sixth (JAB/MPN/MOV34 [JAMM/MPN]) is composed of zinc metalloproteases (Abdul Rehman et al., 2016; Clague et al., 2013; Komander et al., 2009; Komander and Rape, 2012) . Many DUBs have been linked to physiological and/or pathophysiological functions. For example, USP1 and USP4 are involved in DNA-damage repair (Kee and Huang, 2015) , USP22 and BAP1 have a role in chromatin function (Atanassov et al., 2011) , and USP2 and USP8 are reported to stabilize oncogenic proteins cyclin D1 (Shan et al., 2009 ) and mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (Byun et al., 2013), respectively. While dozens of apo-and ubiquitin-bound structures have been solved (Hu et al., 2002; Johnston et al., 1997; Komander et al., 2009 ), very few have been achieved with non-ubiquitin-based compounds (Davies et al., 2012; Ratia et al., 2008; Schlierf et al., 2016) . Notably, small-molecule,DUB complex structures are lacking for the largest 56-member mammalian USP family.\n\nThe first DUB inhibitor, the dual USP14/UCHL5 inhibitor VLX1570, entered clinical trials in 2015 (Wang et al., 2016b . Overall, however, DUB inhibitor development is still in its early stages. Approximately 40 DUB inhibitors have been reported, although most are weak, multi-targeted agents (D'Arcy et al., 2015; Ndubaku and Tsui, 2015) . Given the current dearth of potent and selective inhibitors, skepticism remains as to whether or not this enzyme class will be druggable in a manner analogous to that of protein kinases, for example. A significant hindrance to the generation of potent and selective DUB inhibitors is a lack of structure-guided optimization efforts. One example of structureguided development of a DUB inhibitor, which targeted the SARS DUB PLPro (Baez-Santos et al., 2015) , generated compounds with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) below 500 nM and exhibiting a high degree of selectivity relative to mammalian DUBs. In this case, selectivity was explained by significant structural differences between viral and mammalian DUBs. Breakthroughs in X-ray crystallography of small-molecule DUB inhibitor complexes have the potential to enable rapid development of potent and selective inhibitors of mammalian DUBs.\n\nThe DUB USP7 has been shown to be involved in regulation of a myriad of cellular processes, including epigenetics, cell cycle, DNA repair, immunity, viral infection, and tumorigenesis. USP7, also known as HAUSP (herpes virus-associated ubiquitinspecific protease), was first discovered as a protein that plays a role in viral lytic growth (Everett et al., 1997) . Interest in the enzyme intensified when USP7 was implicated in regulating degradation of the tumor suppressor p53 (Li et al., 2002) by stabilizing the major E3 ligase for p53, MDM2 (Cummins et al., 2004; Li et al., 2004) . Recently several epigenetic modifiers, including the methyltransferase PHF8 (Wang et al., 2016a) , demethylase DNMT1(Du et al., 2010; Felle et al., 2011; Qin et al., 2011) , and acetyltransferase Tip60 (Dar et al., 2013) , as well as H2B itself (van der Knaap et al., 2005) , have been identified as direct targets of USP7. Other notable targets of USP7 include the transcription factors FOXP3, which in T-regulatory (Treg) cells links this DUB enzyme to immune response (van Loosdregt et al., 2013) , and N-Myc, which is stabilized in neuroblastoma cells (Tavana et al., 2016) . Consistent with its regulation of diverse substrates and biological processes, USP7 has emerged as a drug target in a wide range of malignancies including multiple myeloma (Chauhan et al., 2012) , breast cancer (Wang et al., 2016a) , neuroblastoma (Tavana et al., 2016) , glioma (Cheng et al., 2013) , and ovarian cancer (Zhang et al., 2016) .\n\nP22077 and its close analog P5091 are the inhibitors most frequently utilized to probe USP7 functions (for structures see Figure S1A ). P22077 exhibits modest potency against USP7 (IC 50 = 8.0 mM) and equipotent inhibition of two additional DUBs, USP10 and USP47 (Altun et al., 2011; Ritorto et al., 2014) . In addition to modest potency and selectivity, reported drawbacks of these nitrothiophene-based compounds include poor solubility and general toxicity (Chen et al., 2017) . Additional USP7 inhibitors (shown in Figure S1B ) have been identified, although none possess features superior to P5091/P22077 and significant optimization efforts have not been undertaken (Aleo et al., 2006; Colland et al., 2009; El-Desoky et al., 2017; Nicholson et al., 2008; Reverdy et al., 2012; Tanokashira et al., 2016; Yamaguchi et al., 2013) .\n\nHere we report the structure-guided development of nextgeneration small-molecule probes of USP7. High-resolution USP7,small-molecule crystal structures enabled us to rapidly develop XL188, a highly selective 90 nM inhibitor of USP7, from a 7.2-mM lead, as a probe of USP7. Furthermore, we show that XL203C, the enantiomer of XL188, is more than 80-fold less potent against USP7, and thus serves as an inactive control compound. In contrast to P22077/P5091, which target the invariant catalytic cysteine of USP DUBs, XL188 is a noncovalent active-site inhibitor. We demonstrate that the XL188/XL203C active/inactive inhibitor pair is a powerful combination for studying USP7 function in cellular models.\n\nAs part of an effort to identify chemical starting points for development of DUB inhibitors by profiling the inhibitory activity of compounds reported in peer-reviewed and patent literature for activity against large panels of DUBs (Ritorto et al., 2014), we identified a highly selective inhibitor of USP7 (1, structure in Figure 1A ) reported in a 2013 patent from Hybrigenics (Colland and Gourdel, 2013; Kessler, 2014) . When screened for inhibitory activity across a panel of 38 purified DUBs at a concentration of 100 mM, USP7 was the only DUB substantially inhibited ( Figure S1C and Table S1 ). Dose-response analysis using USP7 catalytic domain (amino acids 208-560) or fulllength enzyme (1-1,102) and ubiquitin-aminomethylcoumarin (Ub-AMC) as substrate confirmed USP7 inhibitory activity, although potency was weak with IC 50 s in the double-digit micromolar range ( Figures 1B and S1D ). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), using the catalytic domain, confirmed binding with a dissociation constant (K D ) of 8 mM ( Figure S1E and Table  S2 ). We solved the structure of USP7 bound by 1, which enabled rapid structure-guided development of XL188 (Figure 1A) , a highly potent and selective inhibitor of USP7. XL188 inhibited USP7 catalytic domain and full-length enzyme with IC 50 values of 193 and 90 nM, respectively ( Figure 1B ). The interaction of XL188 with USP7 was confirmed using ITC and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) (Figures 1C and S1F; Table S2 ). Consistent with the 100-fold improvement in biochemical inhibition of USP7 by XL188 compared with 1, a K D of 104 nM was measured for USP7 catalytic domain using ITC ( Figure 1C , Table S2 ). The selectivity of XL188 was assessed against a panel of 41 purified DUBs, using ubiquitinrhodamine (Ub-Rho) as substrate. XL188 retained the excellent selectivity for USP7 observed with 1; at a concentration of 10 mM, XL188 exhibited little to no inhibition of any DUBs other than USP7 ( Figure 1D and Table S1 ). In contrast, the enantiomer of XL188, XL203C ( Figure 1A ), showed 80-fold less potent inhibition of USP7 (IC 50 = 7.18 mM, Figure 1B ) and no significant inhibition of other DUBs ( Figure S1G and Table S1 ).\n\nWe determined co-crystal structures of 1 and XL188 in complex with purified, recombinant USP7 catalytic domain (Figures 2A,  2B , S2A, and S2B) to 1.9 \u00c5 and 2.2 \u00c5 , respectively. These high-resolution structures revealed that the catalytic cysteine and switching loop were in the unproductive conformation, as seen in apo structures (Hu et al., 2002) , but with significantly different unit cell dimensions. A notable interaction in apo structures (represented by PDB: 1NF8) was the face-to-face (or active site-to-active site) contact, highlighted by the mutual and complete insertion of Leu288's side chain within a hydrophobic pocket near the catalytic cysteine, formed by helix a4, and loops a1 and a4-a5. This interaction was not present in our complex structures; instead, the active site in our complex structure was nearly free of crystal contacts. Our results therefore further confirm the relevance of the proposed USP7 autoinhibited conformation; namely, that it is not a crystal contact artifact. Importantly, our complex structures revealed unambiguous electron density ( Figures S2A and S2C ) for the inhibitors in the substrate binding cleft leading to the active site. Inhibitors Figure S1 ; Tables S1 and S2.\n\noccupied the S4 and S5 subsites, about 5 \u00c5 removed from the catalytic triad (Figures 2A and S2A ), involving multiple hydrogen bonds with four inhibitor hetero-atoms (Figures 2A and S2B) common to both compounds. Specifically, the quinazolinone ketone formed hydrogen bonds with peptide backbone nitrogens of Arg408 and Phe409, and the quinazolinone cyclic nitrogen formed a hydrogen bond with the amide side chain of Gln297. The tertiary hydroxy group was stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the carboxylic group of Asp295 as well as the peptide backbone nitrogen of Val296. Asp295 is highly conserved among the USP family of deubiquitinating enzymes (Quesada et al., 2004) , as it hydrogen bonds with ubiquitin's backbone P4 position, an interaction presumed to be important for substrate stabilization (Hu et al., 2002) . The oxygen atom of the piperidine amide was within 3 \u00c5 of the hydroxyl group of Tyr465, a strictly conserved DUB family side chain ( Figure S4A ). In addition, the phenyl ring of 1 and XL188 was buried in the S4 pocket, which was bounded by the aromatic rings of Tyr514, His456, Phe409, and the aliphatic chains of Lys420 and Arg408. Notably, the side chain of Phe409 flips to reveal the hydrophobic pocket, a conformational rearrangement also observed upon binding of ubiquitin (Hu et al., 2002) . The additional methyl group of XL188 present at the carbon a to the phenyl ring was involved in multiple van der Waals interactions including with the backbone of Asn460 and the phenyl side chain of Phe409, and was associated with lower B factors in the BL2 loop. All atoms of 1 and XL188 were buried except the chlorine atom and N-methyl-piperazine side chain, respectively (Figures S2D and S2E) . Compared with 1, XL188 was associated with a rotation of the fingers by about 5 counterclockwise around an axis through the piperazine group. Crystallographic studies were complemented with hydrogendeuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX MS) to monitor changes in protein dynamics. Exchange of backbone amide hydrogens with bulk solvent can be accurately measured upon inhibitor binding (Iacob et al., 2009; Wales and Engen, 2006) . Online digestion of USP7 was performed and 85 peptic peptides covering 85% of USP7 catalytic domain were investigated with HDX MS in the free and bound states ( Figures S3A and S3B ). Both XL188 and 1 protected the BL1 and a-4/5 loops ( Figure 2C ), confirming that the observed crystal structure interactions are also relevant in solution. While the locations of the major changes were the same, XL188 protected USP7 from exchange more than 1, consistent with increased affinity (Figures S3B and S3C) . Moreover, HDX MS results showed ligand-induced conformational changes and stabilizations distant from the active site. Inhibitors also stabilized/protected the palm region that is near the catalytic cysteine, including helices a-3/4, consistent with a previously proposed allosteric regulatory mechanism for USP7 (Faesen et al., 2011). Furthermore, a Table S3. disordered loop between a8/b14 was protected from deuterium incorporation, suggesting that this region becomes ordered upon inhibitor binding.\n\nGiven the high degree of selectivity of this chemical series for USP7, we were surprised to discover that nearly every residue directly interacting with inhibitor and several additional amino acids lining the ligand binding pocket are conserved among the USP family of DUBs. Figure 3A shows a detailed ligand interaction diagram of XL188 with USP7; in the diagram residues that are conserved, defined as >80% of 52 other USPs possessing an equivalent residue according to MView classification ( Figure S4A ) (Brown et al., 1998) , are indicated by a red box. Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies show that amino acid substitutions at several of these positions abrogate the ability of the enzyme to cleave DUB substrates (Hu et al., 2002) . Thus, with the goals of gaining insight into the observed compound selectivity and identifying the most productive ligand interactions in our crystal structures, we primarily focused our mutagenesis studies on non-conserved residues contained within the ligand binding pocket. Seven USP7 mutants with a single amino acid substitution and one with double substitution were generated ( Figure 3B ). Gln351, Met407, and Met410 were substituted with Ser, Lys, and Ser, respectively, selected based on the prevalence of the amino acid at equivalent positions in other USPs ( Figure S4A ); all other mutated amino acids were replaced with alanine. Six of the eight mutant proteins retained the ability to cleave the DUB substrate Ub-AMC, although two with significantly reduced activity relative to wild-type (Figure 3B) . The mutagenesis studies were carried out in parallel to compound optimization studies; thus, 1 was utilized to assess the inhibitory activity of the chemical series toward the mutants. 1 inhibited four of the active mutants with IC 50 values within several-fold of its IC 50 for wild-type enzyme ( Figure 3B ). However, USP7Q351S and USP7Y514A were highly resistant to 1, with 1 exhibiting no inhibitory effect at concentrations up to 100 mM compound ( Figures 3B and S4B ). Gln351 is unique to USP7, with only one other USP DUB, USP14, containing this residue at the equivalent position and 80% of USPs containing a residue with a small side chain ( Figure S4A ). Tyr514, on the other hand, is highly conserved among DUBs. Thus, Gln351 may be an important determinant of selectivity for the hydroxypiperidine-based inhibitors. Initial mutagenesis studies were carried out using the catalytic domain; full-length USP7Q351S was confirmed to be resistant to both 1 and XL188 (Figures 3C, 3D, and S4C) . Gln351 hydrogen bonds with Gln297 only in the autoinhibited apo form and may be required for stabilization of the conformation bound by these inhibitors. Although a complete understanding of the molecular-level contribution of Gln351S to selectivity awaits further structural studies, these studies support that the binding mode observed in crystallographic studies accurately represents the binding mode in solution.\n\nThe high-resolution structure of USP7 bound by 1 enabled rapid optimization of potency, solubility, and pharmacological properties of the compound leading to XL188. As detailed above, four compound hetero-atoms were involved in hydrogenbonding interactions with USP7, the phenyl ring was buried in the S4 hydrophobic pocket normally filled by the Leu73 side chain of substrate ubiquitin, and the chloro atom was solvent exposed. Initial structure-activity relationship investigations ( Figure 4A ) focused on establishing the importance of the hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions observed in the structure. All biochemical IC 50 s were measured using USP7 catalytic domain and Ub-AMC as substrate. 1 inhibited isolated USP7 catalytic domain with an IC 50 of 12.3 mM and full-length protein with an IC 50 of 10.2 mM. Compounds 2 and 3, in which the hydroxypiperidine -OH group was removed or replaced with -CN, respectively, exhibited little inhibition of USP7 at concentrations up to 100 mM. Similarly, removal of the amide carbonyl, as in 4, abrogated USP7 activity as did contraction of the 6-membered piperidine to a 5-membered ring (5). Occupancy of the S4 hydrophobic pocket by the phenyl ring was confirmed to be required for activity, as removal of the moiety (6) or shortening the linker between the hydroxypiperidine and phenyl (7) resulted in biochemical IC 50 s > 100 mM. In contrast, installation of a racemic methyl group on the methylene adjacent to the phenyl ring (8) improved biochemical potency approximately 10-fold, consistent with data reported in the patent exemplifying 1. To explore the importance of stereochemistry of the methyl group we prepared both enantiomers, which revealed that the (R)-stereoisomer (9) was approximately 100-fold more potent than the (S)-stereoisomer (10). Unfortunately, investigation of 9's ability to bind and inhibit USP7 in cells was hampered by poor solubility in aqueous buffer. To improve this property we focused on installation of polar moieties in place of the solvent-exposed chloro atom ( Figure 4B ). Installation of different groups, including an N-methyl-piperazine, piperidine, dimethylamine, and imidazole, linked to the 7-position of the quinazolinone via a short carbon chain and amide bond linkage, improved potency 2-to 4-fold relative to the parent compound 9.\n\nWith several analogs exhibiting submicromolar USP7 IC 50 s, we considered metabolic stability as an additional parameter for compound prioritization, since a probe suitable for in vivo studies would be highly valuable for pharmacological validation of USP7 in animal disease models. XL188 exhibited the greatest stability in the presence of mouse liver microsomes with a half-life of 31 min ( Figure 4B ). Competitive activity-based protein profiling using the DUB-targeting activity-based probe HA-Ub-Vs (Hewings et al., 2017) confirmed that XL188 bound native USP7 ( Figure 4C ). Treatment of HEK293T lysates with XL188 significantly blocked labeling of USP7 by HA-Ub-Vs with an IC 50 of approximately 0.9 mM, a value that represents a significant improvement compared with 1 (at a concentration of 500 mM, 1 competes for 50% of probe labeling [ Figure S5A ]). Because in this experiment an irreversible probe (HA-Ub-Vs) is competing for occupancy of USP7 with a reversible inhibitor, the measured cell-based IC 50 s may underestimate binding. A hemagglutinin blot of the same treated lysates ( Figure S5B ) confirmed the high degree of selectivity for USP7 observed in the 41-member purified enzyme panel. As a measure of general toxicity, we treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with XL188 and observed no growth suppression at concentrations up to 10 mM following 72 hr of treatment ( Figure S5C ).

See also Figure S5 .\n\nachieve an ideally matched negative control compound to use in conjunction with XL188, we prepared its enantiomer, XL203C. XL203C showed 80-to 100-fold less potent inhibition of USP7 relative to XL188 in both biochemical ( Figures 1B and 4B ) and cellular target engagement assays ( Figure 4C ).\n\nTo further examine XL188's on-target effects, we evaluated its impact on the USP7-HDM2-p53-p21 axis. The role of USP7 in promoting degradation of HDM2 resulting in increased levels of p53 and p21 is documented in multiple models (Chauhan et al., 2012; Kon et al., 2010) . In MCF7 cells treated with XL188, levels of p53 and p21 increased following 16 hr of treatment with concentrations in line with the IC 50 of native USP7 ( Figure 5A ). Consistent with the effects being USP7 dependent, no observable change in levels of the same proteins across the same range of concentrations with the comparatively inactive enantiomer XL203C was observed ( Figure 5A ). Degradation of HDM2 by XL188 was observed in the same system when new protein synthesis was blocked by addition of cycloheximide ( Figure 5B ). The necessity to block protein synthesis to observe degradation of HDM2 is consistent with the established negative feedback loop involving these proteins in which p53 transcriptionally upregulates HDM2 (Wu et al., 1993) . Similarly, treatment of multiple myeloma MM.1S cells with XL188, but not XL203C, led to loss of HDM2 accompanied by an increase in downstream tumor suppressors p21 and p53, as has previously been reported for the USP7 inhibitor P5091 ( Figures 5C and 5D ) (Chauhan et al., 2012) .\n\nThrough their role in reversing ubiquitination and coordinating a wide range of cellular processes including proteolysis, DNA repair, receptor signaling, transcription, and immunity, DUBs are emerging as a new class of drug targets. Although efforts to develop small-molecule probes of DUBs to study their role in basic and disease biology have increased in recent years, these efforts have produced limited numbers of well-characterized and optimized inhibitors. The DUB enzyme USP7 is one of the most well-studied DUBs and is reported to regulate the abundance of proteins involved in DNA-damage repair, cell-cycle regulation, and epigenetic and transcription factor control of gene expression. Notably, USP7 has been implicated in a range of different cancer types, controlling some of the most important proliferative processes. To identify the most promising disease contexts in which to deploy USP7 drugs and to more accurately catalog the activities of USP7 as it pertains to both the promise and liabilities associated with blockade of USP7 activity, highly potent and well-characterized probe compounds have been sought after. Here, we present an inhibitor of USP7, XL188, with double-digit nanomolar potency toward USP7 and exquisite selectivity relative to the largest available panel of purified DUBs. We combined XL188 with a negative control compound, XL203C, to present a set of tools for interrogating USP7 biology. Thus, we confirmed USP7 as a key regulator of HDM2-p53-p21 signaling by showing that XL188, but not XL203C, promoted degradation of HDM2, resulting in increased levels of p53 and p21.\n\nOur observation that the IC 50 s for minimum and full-length USP7 are similar (190 versus 90 nM), in light of the fact that USP7 catalytic domain efficiency is augmented by the presence of the C-terminal Ubl domains (Faesen et al., 2011) , may suggest that the kinetics of the equilibrium between active and inactive states of the full-length enzyme is rapid. Alternatively, if we propose an additional stable intermediate toward the activated state, represented by Phe409 flipping, our results suggest that the full-length construct stabilizes this intermediate to a greater extent compared with the minimal construct. Although premature, we might further suggest that the mechanism by which the C-terminal domains upregulate the catalytic domains is by stabilizing Phe409 flipping.\n\nXL188 represents one of only a small set of mammalian DUB inhibitors with low nanomolar potency and a high degree of selectivity relative to other DUBs (Dexheimer et al., 2010; Ndubaku and Tsui, 2015) . On comparing the state of the DUB field with the established kinase field, the first publication on phosphorylation came 23 years prior to the first publication on ubiquitination, and the current state of modulating ubiquitylation via DUBs is roughly where drugging phosphorylation via kinases was 20 years ago (Cohen and Tcherpakov, 2010) . In this project, rapid optimization of XL188 from 1 was enabled largely by our success in achieving a high-resolution crystal structure of the lead compound in complex with USP7. We established a series of biochemical, biophysical, and selectivity assays to identify promising compounds for crystallographic and medicinal chemistry studies. By applying similar triaging assays, we believe that similar success in crystallography and small-molecule probe development can be achieved for other DUB family members.\n\nOverall, our studies provide optimized and well-characterized small-molecule probes for use in studying the roles of USP7 in normal and disease biology and, furthermore, lend considerable validation to the notion that DUBs are a class of enzymes for which potent and selective inhibitors can be achieved.\n\nDUBs are a 100-member family of proteases that control levels and activation of proteins through removal of posttranslational ubiquitin moieties. Of particular interest to drug discovery, DUBs stabilize disease-linked proteins, including many targets that remain undruggable. Thus, DUB-targeting drugs can promote degradation of diseasecausing proteins, representing a novel strategy for modulating the activity of challenging targets in cancer and other diseases. Progress in the development of potent and selective DUB inhibitors for use as chemical probes and translation to the clinic has been slow, however. Of note, structure-guided medicinal chemistry campaigns have been lacking for mammalian DUBs, suggesting that success in crystallography of small-molecule DUB co-structures enabling such efforts could significantly affect the field. We succeeded in solving high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of USP7 bound by a small-molecule ligand series. The co-structures enabled us to rapidly improve the potency of the lead inhibitor 100-fold to 90 nM. Furthermore, we show that the newly developed inhibitor exhibits exquisite selectivity for USP7 relative to broad panels of purified and cellular DUBs and that the compound, but not a negative control stereoisomer, promotes degradation of a known USP7 substrate. The developed compounds are thus validated as high-quality probes for pharmacological interrogation of the diverse reported functions of USP7. Importantly, this work provides proof of concept that potent and selective DUB inhibitors can be achieved and that structural characterization of chemical leads with their cognate DUB target could accelerate probe and drug discovery programs.\n\nDetailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: Zhang, X.Y., Varthi, M., Sykes, S.M., Phillips, C., Warzecha, C., Zhu, W., Wyce, A., Thorne, A.W., Berger, S.L., and McMahon, S.B.
