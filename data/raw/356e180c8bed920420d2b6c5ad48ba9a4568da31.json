VSV pseudotype system components and BHK-21 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Whitt.\n\nPooled normal human serum (pNHS) was purchased from Lee Biosolutions and used as negative control serum. Human serum from a single patient with laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection was used as the positive control serum. The positive control serum was collected from the first imported case of MERS-CoV into the United States during the case investigation, with a neutralizing titer of 320. A laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV patient serum sample and a panel of human serum with confirmed high neutralizing antibody titers to human coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, OC43, NL63 were used in this study to evaluate VSV-MERS-CoV-S particle based neutralization assay for potential cross neutralization. A total of 52 human sera samples from MERS-CoV-infected patients in Saudi Arabia were used to examine equivalencies. The scale bar shows the genetic distance as nucleotide substitutions per site. Each specimen label includes: accession number, city and country of collection, patient number (e.g. 040), day of collection"}
