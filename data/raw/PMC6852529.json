{"title": "Detection of selected viral pathogens in dogs with canine infectious respiratory disease in Austria", "body": "Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD), synonymous for infectious tracheobronchitis or \u201ckennel cough,\u201d is a disease caused by single or multiple infectious agents with a high worldwide prevalence. Apart from several viral and bacterial agents, the individual health and constitution, vaccination status and environmental influences including husbandry conditions (e.g. crowding of animals) may have an impact on the manifestation of clinical signs. Non\u2010complicated forms of typically self\u2010limiting character may be distinguished from complicated forms associated with, possibly fatal, pneumonia. A severe course of disease typically develops as a consequence of coinfections (Chalker et al. 2003, Chvala et al. 2007, Schulz et al. 2014a). However, even isolated viral infections [e.g. canine influenza virus (CIV)] may lead to clinically relevant and sometimes lethal respiratory disease (Crawford et al. 2005). Commonly recognised viral causes of CIRD are canine parainfluenza virus (CPiV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV\u20102) and canine distemper virus (CDV) (Ford 2012).\n\nHowever, according to more recent studies, the understanding of this disease complex has changed. New viral pathogens have been detected within the past two decades. In 2003, canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) emerged as a cause of CIRD in a rehoming centre in the UK (Erles et al. 2003). Further studies from several countries detected CRCoV\u2010specific nucleic acid in dogs suffering from respiratory disease (Yachi & Mochizuki 2006, Decaro et al. 2007, Spiss et al. 2012, Schulz et al. 2014a, Viitanen et al. 2015).\n\nIn association with an outbreak of respiratory disease in racing greyhounds in Florida, CIV types closely related to influenza subtype H3N8, originally detected in horses were isolated (Crawford et al. 2005). Subsequently, several studies from different countries detected CIV isolates in respiratory samples and concurrent anti\u2010CIV antibodies in dogs with mild respiratory signs as well as cases of fatal respiratory disease (Yoon et al. 2005, Daly et al. 2008, Payungporn et al. 2008, Song et al. 2008, Kirkland et al. 2010, Li et al. 2010, Song et al. 2013). Furthermore, isolation of human\u2010related influenza strains from dogs was successful (Lin et al. 2012). To date, at least seven influenza virus subtypes showing different ability of interspecies and intraspecies transmission have been isolated from dogs. These subtypes are mainly prevalent in the USA (H3N8), Eastern China and South Korea (e.g. H3N2), but some of them have also been reported from European countries (Sun et al. 2013, Xie et al. 2016) supporting the hypothesis that dogs may play a role in transmission and spread of influenza virus among animal species and even humans.\n\nDetection of further viral pathogens (e.g. canine herpesvirus, canine reovirus, canine pneumovirus (CnPnV), pantropic canine coronavirus, canine hepacivirus and canine bocavirus) has been associated with respiratory disease in dogs (Buonavoglia & Martella 2007, Decaro & Buonavoglia 2008, Kawakami et al. 2010, Renshaw et al. 2010, Decaro & Buonavoglia 2011, Kapoor et al. 2011, Kapoor et al. 2012, Mitchell et al. 2013b, Priestnall et al. 2014). However, these viruses are uncommonly detected in dogs with CIRD or their possible role as causative agents is not yet completely determined.\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of common CIRD\u2010associated viruses (CPiV, CAV\u20102, CDV) in dogs in and around Vienna, Austria. Although there may be environmental factors specific to this location, our findings are likely to generalise to other locations within Western Europe and possibly further afield. It was further investigated whether emerging viruses (CRCoV and CIV) have a significantly higher prevalence in dogs with CIRD compared to dogs without respiratory disease.\n\nSamples were collected from 214 dogs with signs of CIRD between April 2013 and October 2015. The main criterion for inclusion was coughing. A complete history was obtained, and a thorough physical examination was followed by further diagnostic evaluation (e.g. complete blood count, blood chemistry, thoracic radiographs) as indicated to exclude non\u2010infectious causes of respiratory disorders (e.g. congestive heart failure, airway foreign bodies, airway\u2010compressive neoplasia). All dogs included in this prospective study were either presented at an academic or a private veterinary clinic, or recruited from animal shelters located in the following Austrian regions: Vienna, Lower Austria, Burgenland and Styria, Austria.\n\nDogs meeting the inclusion criteria were separated into two groups according to different forms of husbandry: group A consisted of 173 privately owned dogs and group B included 41 dogs from animal shelters. Fifty clinically healthy privately owned dogs sampled during routine examinations and procedures (annual vaccination, castration) served as controls (group C). In order to compare the results within the population, the dogs were additionally divided into three subgroups of age: puppies (younger than 6 months), adolescent dogs (from 6 to 18 months) and adults (older than 18 months). According to the period of time from onset of clinical signs until presentation and sample generation the dogs were also classified into two subgroups: acute (within 14 days of onset), and chronic (after 14 days of onset).\n\nNasal and tonsillar swabs (sterile cotton swabs) were collected from all 264 dogs (groups A, B, C) in this study. In 31 animals with progressive respiratory disorders that had been resistant to previous treatment, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were additionally collected during tracheobronchoscopy. From 30 acutely diseased dogs, paired blood samples were retrieved for serological examinations.\n\nSwab samples were transferred into tubes containing 1 mL of diethyl pyrocarbonate\u2010treated water and vortexed for 10 seconds. BALF obtained from right and left lung was pooled in equivalent amounts. Swab and BALF samples were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further analysis.\n\nSerum was prepared by centrifugation (10 minutes at 3000g), was subsequently lifted from the blood samples, and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nFor nucleic acid extraction from swabs and BALF samples, QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Despite its name, this kit allows extraction of RNA as well as DNA from different kinds of samples. If not immediately processed, nucleic acid extracts were stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nFor detection of virus\u2010specific nucleic acids of CAV\u20101/CAV\u20102, CDV, CPiV, CRCoV and influenza virus A, different PCR\u2010techniques and protocols were followed. Published protocols were adapted to commercially available PCR kits quoted below (see also Table 1).\n\nThe PCR protocol for CAV\u20101/CAV\u20102 published by Nell et al. (2000) was carried out using the Fast Cycling PCR Kit (QIAGEN). After an initial step of 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes, the PCR was run for 45 cycles of denaturation at 96\u00b0C for 5 seconds, primer annealing at 60\u00b0C for 5 seconds and primer extension at 68\u00b0C for 21 seconds. PCR was finalised by an ultimate extension of 1 minute at 72\u00b0C.\n\nCDV\u2010reverse transcription (RT)\u2010PCR described by Frisk et al. (1999) was carried out using QIAGEN's OneStep RT\u2010PCR Kit. After two pre\u2010steps (50\u00b0C for 30 minutes and 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes), the PCR was run for 45 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, primer annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds and primer extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 minute. Final extension was at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Owing to practical reasons, the protocol was changed using a comparable real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay published by Elia et al. (2006) during the study. Overall, 18.9% of the samples from diseased dogs, and 34.0% of the samples from control dogs were examined using the Real time RT\u2010PCR assay. Samples showing positive results after conventional PCR were reassessed via Real time RT\u2010PCR assay.\n\nA nested RT\u2010PCR protocol for detection of CPiV\u2010specific nucleic acids (Erles et al. 2004) was optimised by using OneStep RT\u2010PCR Kit (QIAGEN) and was found to give better results if only the outer primer pair was used.\n\nReal time RT\u2010PCRs for CRCoV (Spiss et al. 2012), Influenza A viruses (WHO 2009) and CDV (Elia et al. 2006) were carried out on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real\u2010Time PCR System in a reaction volume of 25 \u03bcL using the SuperScript III platinum OneStep q\u2010RT\u2010PCR Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's guidelines.\n\nPositive controls and blanks were run with all PCRs. For the CRCoV q\u2010RT\u2010PCR a betacoronavirus (BCoV L9 strain), for the Influenza A q\u2010RT\u2010PCR an EIV 639/69 strain, and for the other PCRs a modified live vaccine (Virbagen canis SHPPi, Virbac) served as positive controls. Blanks consisted of sample\u2010free extracts produced simultaneously to each extraction process.\n\nPCR products of conventional PCRs/RT\u2010PCRs were visualised by performing gel electrophoresis on an 1.2% agarose gel at 100 Volt for 80 minutes. In case of positivity of CAV\u20101/CAV\u20102 PCR sequence analysis (Microsynth) was performed to distinguish between CAV type\u20101 and CAV type\u20102.\n\nFor detection of antibodies against betacoronaviruses, 30 acute serum samples as well as the corresponding sera (obtained 2 to 3 weeks later) of the convalescent dogs were examined by an indirect immunofluorescence test. Madin\u2010Darby bovine kidney cells were disseminated on 96\u2010well microtitre plates (100 \u03bcL/well) and then incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humid 5% CO2\u2010atmosphere overnight. After washing the plates with phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) solution, the adherent cells were infected with BCoV strain 15317/82 and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours. Subsequently cells were washed with PBS again and fixed with 100 mL of 96% ethanol.\n\nThe sera underwent twofold serial dilutions from 1:20 to 1:5120 with PBS and immunofluorescence test was performed as follows:\n\nEthanol was discharged, and the 96\u2010well microtitre plates were washed three times with PBS; 50 \u03bcL of the previously diluted sera per well were added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Thereafter, the plates were washed three times with PBS and 50 \u03bcL of 1:40 diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)\u2010conjugate (anti\u2010dog IgG, Jackson) was added to each well. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for another 30 minutes and three washing cycles with PBS, 50 \u03bcL/well Eriochrome black T indicator (diluted 1:200 with PBS) was filled in each well of the 96\u2010well microtitre plate to reduce background fluorescence. Plates incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature before cells were washed three times with PBS once more. Finally, wells were filled with 50 \u03bcL/well of glycerine buffer solution to prevent the cells from drying.\n\nFor evaluation of the microtitre plates an inverse ultraviolet microscope was used. The highest dilution with a clear cytoplasmatic fluorescence was equivalent to the specific antibody titre of each serum sample. Samples that showed no fluorescence in dilution 1:20 were regarded as negative (no antibodies present). Each assay included a positive and a negative control serum.\n\nThe obtained data are initially presented in a descriptive way and a 95% confidence interval was calculated. Analysis was performed using IBM SPSS.\n\nFocussing on upper respiratory tract samples (nasal and tonsillar swabs), viral nucleic acids were detected in 31 of 214 diseased dogs (14.5%). Sixteen dogs tested positive for CRCoV (7.5%), 14 dogs for CPiV (6.5%) and one of these dogs additionally for CAV\u20102\u2010specific nucleic acid (0.5%). One single dog tested positive for CDV\u2010specific nucleic acid (0.5%). In none of the obtained samples from the upper respiratory tract was CIV\u2010specific nucleic acid detected. Of those 31 positive dogs, 21 were privately owned (group A), and 10 kept in shelters (group B). They consisted of five puppies, 12 adolescent dogs and 14 adult dogs. Twenty\u2010seven of the 31 positive dogs (87.1%) showed acute onset of signs, three suffered from chronic disease (9.7%) and for one diseased dog this information was not available (Table 2).\n\nFurthermore, upper respiratory tract samples from two dogs (4.0%) of the clinically healthy control group C tested positive for CRCoV\u2010specific nucleic acid (Table 2).\n\nNine dogs from group A (5.2%) and seven dogs out of group B (17.0%) tested positive for CRCoV in either nasal, tonsillar or both samples at one time. One of these dogs belonged to the subgroup of puppies; nine dogs were from the adolescent subgroup and six animals from the subgroup of adult dogs. With one exception, all these animals showed acute onset of CIRD (93.7%).\n\nFourteen diseased dogs (6.5%) tested positive for CPiV. From those, 11 belonged to group A and three to group B. They all harboured CPiV\u2010specific nucleic acid in sample material from the nose and one dog concurrently from the tonsils. Four of these dogs were classified as puppies; three dogs were from the adolescent subgroup and seven dogs were adults. Twelve out of these 14 animals showed acute onset of clinical signs (85.7%), one dog was chronically ill, and for another dog this information was not available. Seven dogs (50.0%) were regularly vaccinated\u2010including against CPiV.\n\nIn one of these 14 CPiV\u2010positive dogs, CAV\u2010specific nucleic acid was detected concurrently. This dog was privately owned (group A) and tested positive for CAV in both nasal and tonsillar swabs and CAV\u20102 strain (Toronto) was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Belonging to the subgroup of adults this dog had been irregularly vaccinated and received its latest vaccine 45 days before sample collection. It presented with a several week history of clinical signs including severe coughing, nasal and ocular discharge, dyspnoea and fever. Apart from that case, in no other dog was viral nucleic acid of two or more different viruses detected. In addition, no other proband of the study tested positive for CAV.\n\nOne dog from group A tested positive for CDV\u2010specific nucleic acid in a sample retrieved from the tonsils. RNA sequencing enabled the identification of a CDV vaccine strain (Onderstepoort). The dog was an adult and presented with chronic respiratory disease but no other signs consistent with CDV infection. The vaccination status of this dog was unknown.\n\nAdditional information regarding all PCR\u2010positive dogs is summarised in Table 3.\n\nAll BALF samples collected from 31 chronically ill dogs revealed negative PCR results.\n\nFrom 30 available paired serum samples 17 (56.7%) were obtained from privately\u2010owned dogs (group A). Five of these 17 samples (29.4%) showed a significant increase in anti\u2010CRCoV antibody titres. The antibody titres of two dogs increased more than 128\u2010fold. CRCoV\u2010specific nucleic acid from nasal or tonsillar swabs was detected in these two dogs.\n\nAnother 13 paired serum samples (43.3%) were collected from a population of 15 kennelled working dogs with an acute episode of CIRD (group B). As two of the 15 dogs were non\u2010compliant with blood sampling, in these cases no serum samples were obtained. In 10 of the 13 paired serum samples (76.9%), a significant increase in anti\u2010CRCoV antibodies was found. Six dogs revealed a 16\u2010 to 128\u2010fold antibody titre increase and concurrent evidence of CRCoV RNA in sample material from the nose or tonsils. No further causative viral agent was detected in these cases (Table 4).\n\nNo conflicts of interest have been declared."}
