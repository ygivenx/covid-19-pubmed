{"title": "Rapid Therapeutic Recommendations in the Context of a Global Public Health Crisis using Translational Bioinformatics Approaches: A proof-of-concept study using Nipah Virus Infection", "body": "We live in a world of emerging new diseases and old diseases resurging in more aggressive forms. Drug development by pharmaceutical companies is a market-driven and costly endeavor, and thus it is often a challenge when drugs are needed for diseases endemic only to certain regions or which affect only a few patients. However, biomedical open data is accessible and reusable for reanalysis and generation of a new hypotheses and discovery.\n\nIn this study, we leverage biomedical data and tools to analyze available data on Nipah Virus (NiV) infection. NiV infection is an emerging zoonosis that is transmissible to humans and is associated with high mortality rates. In this study, explored the application of computational drug repositioning and chemogenomic enrichment analyses using host transcriptome data to match drugs that could reverse the virus-induced gene signature. We performed analyses using two gene signatures: i) A previously published gene signature (n=34), and ii) a gene signature generated using the characteristic direction method (n= 5,533). Our predictive framework suggests that several drugs including FDA approved therapies like beclometasone, trihexyphenidyl, S-propranolol etc. could modulate the NiV infection induced gene signatures in endothelial cells. A target specific analysis of CXCL10 also suggests the potential application of Eldelumab, an investigative therapy for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, as a putative candidate for drug repositioning. To conclude, we also discuss challenges and opportunities in clinical trials (n-of-1 and adaptive trials) for repositioned drugs. Further follow-up studies including biochemical assays and clinical trials are required to identify effective therapies for clinical use. Our proof-of-concept study highlights that translational bioinformatics methods including gene expression analyses and computational drug repositioning could augment epidemiological investigations in the context of an emerging disease with no effective treatment.\n\nNipah Virus (NiV) is a member of Paramyxoviridae family of enveloped, Negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. NiV is a member of Henipavirus genus -other Henipaviruses include Cedar henipavirus, Ghanaian bat henipavirus, Hendra henipavirus and Mojiang henipavirus [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . NiV infection is considered as an emerging infectious disease threat by the World Health Organization (WHO) (See: http, //www.who.int/csr/disease/nipah/en/) [10, 11] . NiV infection was first reported and the virus was isolated during an outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore in the late 1990s [12] [13] [14] . NiV infection reemerged in 2018 in Kozhikode, a coastal city in Kerala, India. The Kerala reemergence is associated with high mortality rate (above 80% of identified cases, personal communication) (See: http, //www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44193145). At present there are no approved therapies or vaccines against NiV. In this study, we explore the application of translational bioinformatics databases, tools and methods like computational drug repositioning to predict potential FDA-approved, therapies using publicly available datasets. Follow-up studies, including experimental assays and clinical trials are required before using repositioned candidate drugs for clinical use.\n\nNiV infection is characterized by a combination of neurological, respiratory and cardiovascular complications. These include but are not limited to: high fever, seizures, encephalitis, meningitis, tremor, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphasia, respiratory tract lesions, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), tachycardia, myocarditis, vomiting, hypertension, and segmental myoclonus along with or without other clinical features [15-58-98] . Notably, vaccine candidates like human monoclonal antibody m102.4 has found to be effective in pre-clinical studies [71] . Pre-clinical immunotherapy studies demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies might be beneficial (anti-G and anti-F MAbs) as agents against NiV infection. Small molecules that activate IRF3 and modulate RIG-I-like receptors pathways [56] were also investigated as potential strategies to target NiV infection [54] .\n\nDrugs like ribavirin (a broad spectrum antiviral effective against both RNA and DNA viruses) have been shown to be associated with lower mortality rates, but lack conclusive evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials [53, [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] . Evidence from a recent studies suggests that Favipiravir (T-705), an investigational treatment for influenza may prevent NiV infection in a hamster model [104] . Efforts are also underway to develop nucleic acids therapeutics against NiV infection [105] . Most of these therapies need full cycles of clinical trials or additional evidences including comparative effectiveness to understand optimal contributions to outcomes [53] .\n\nDrug repositioning (or drug repurposing; See Figure 1 ) is a drug development strategy designed to reduce the time to develop and market a drug for diseases with no approved drugs or diseases that may need better therapy [106, 107] . Rare, orphan, endemic or neglected diseases may not be ideal areas of research and development for pharmaceutical companies. However, drug repositioning offers an alternate path in such settings. For example, National Institute of Health's -National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences recommends that 7,000 rare and neglected diseases that currently lack effective treatments could benefit from drug repositioning compared to traditional drug discovery All rights reserved.

Datadriven methods that combine computational and experimental approaches could complement, improve or reduce the cost of drug discovery. For example, during the first All rights reserved.

In this study we\n\nshow the application of a translational bioinformatics approach \"computational drug repositioning\" to find potential therapies to target NiV using publicly available datasets and tools. Therapeutic options to target this epidemiological threat is limited and drug repositioning will be a viable therapeutic identification strategy. However, since late '90s biomedical researchers have generated and deposited a variety of biomolecular data related to NiV in publicly accessible biomolecular databases.

We queried the Gene Expression \n\nTo leverage CGEA method, we first used the signature induced by NiV on endothelial cell lines, in the form of \"upregulated\" and \"downregulated\" gene identifiers. The input query of gene lists is matched to compounds, and the \"connectivity\" between the gene signature and compound is scored after various filtering steps against the available drug-induced All rights reserved.

A Gaussian mixture model is used to derive the \"connectivity score,\" and statistical significance is estimated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with the Benjamini-Hochberg method for control of false discovery rate. CGEA produces an output of a ranked list of candidate compounds that may potentially modulate a biological state of interest.\n\nDepending on the query signature and reference databases, many candidate compounds will often be extracted -such lists can be trimmed and prioritized for most likely candidates using annotations from reference databases (for example RepurposeDB, KEGG drugs, DrugBank, etc.) and also using specific characteristics including mechanism of action, side effects, chemical properties or biological targets. \n\nSeven antiviral agents were available in our dataset. The following is the most effective to least effective order in published gene signature (ribavirin, vidarabine, moroxydine, zidovudine, saquinavir, zalcitabine, ganciclovir). While several of them had scores indicating activity but were not significant after FDR corrections. Ribavirin had the lowest score indicating most potent activity. Following was the order of activity in characteristic direction based gene signature: saquinavir, ganciclovir, moroxydine, vidarabine, zalcitabine, zidovudine, ribavirin. Ribavirin was the least effective -this is an example how the genes themselves, number of genes, and signature directionality of genes could influence the ranking of compounds. We also noted that moroxydine had optimal direction of score in both gene sets but were not statistically significant. Moroxydine is an antiviral agent structurally similar to ribavirin [120]. Conserved structural moieties often indicate similar chemical activities. Additional studies are required to elucidate the role of moroxydine as an anti-NiV agent.\n\nAll rights reserved.

In addition to individual-level analyses to understand therapeutic effectiveness for a particular patient, several N-of-1 trials can be statistically aggregated to outcome, should also be explored. Furthermore, the strongest form of n-of-1 trials not only requires a baseline phase (without treatment) and treatment phase (where you introduce the drug) but also requires treatment withdrawal and washout periods to observe the effect before reintroducing the treatment. If a positive effect of the drug is observed, withdrawal may not be possible on ethical grounds, and washout periods without any treatments may also harm patient safety. Given these scenarios, other forms of singlesubject designs that do not require treatment withdrawal (such as multiple baseline designs), or a baseline phase (such as alternating treatment designs) could be considered.\n\nTo improve confidence in results from these trial designs, randomization could be incorporated [172, 181, 182] .

Our data is based on infection induced in HUVEC cells. HUVEC cells may reflect differential gene expression from an affected tissue in a disease of interest. In the absence of patient derived genomic or transcriptomic data sets, the drug lists are less reliable for human testing without any additional experimental evidences. We have very low sample size and the gene signature may fluctuate to a higher or lower number of genes based on the sample size, statistical tests, and multiple testing correction methods. The sample size does not meet the biological replication criteria of a minimum of three samples. Our drug repositioning algorithms are predictive in nature and do not endorse immediate clinical use without further pre-clinical and clinical studies. Offlabel prescription and recommendations would need additional comparative effectiveness trials for these drugs. Also, as a research study, the list of drugs compiled in the results section needs further evaluation in preclinical validation models and needs to be tested in patient cohorts using different clinical trial modalities including comparative effectiveness trials. Various factors drive the success of statistical validity of the predictive frameworks including availability and quality of data, choice of analytical algorithm, orthogonal evidence, and statistical methods that accounts for a large number of data points. We restrict the results, interpretation and discussions on drugs that are in DrugBank; however, other compounds may have superior anti-NiV activity. These compounds would need All rights reserved.

Specifically, we performed computational drug matching searches to find drugs that can reverse the virus induced gene signature on an endothelial cell line in the setting of NiV infection. Briefly, translational bioinformatics approaches with epidemiology efforts may help to accelerate the discovery of affordable therapeutic options for public health crises including emergence of infectious diseases.
