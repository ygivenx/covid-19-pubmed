{"title": "Multiplex Paper-Based Colorimetric DNA Sensor Using\nPyrrolidinyl Peptide Nucleic Acid-Induced AgNPs Aggregation for Detecting\nMERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV Oligonucleotides", "body": "Analytical grade reagents,\nincluding AgNO3, NaBH4, and sodium citrate from\nSigma-Aldrich, KH2PO4 and KCl from Fisher Scientific,\nNa2HPO4 from Mallinckrodt, and NaCl from Macron,\nwere used without further purification. A total of 18 M \u03a9\u00b7cm\u20131 resistance water was obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q\nwater system. Synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Biosearch\nTechnologies. The sequences of DNA oligonucleotides are shown in Table 1.\n\nThe AgNPs were\nsynthesized using\nthe citrate-stabilization method.49 Briefly,\n4 mL of 12.6 mM sodium citrate and 50 mL of 0.3 mM AgNO3 were mixed together. Then, 1 mL of 37 mM NaBH4 was added\nto the mixture under vigorous stirring and the solution turned yellow.\nThe formation of AgNPs and their size distribution were verified by\ndynamic light scattering measurement, and the average size of AgNPs\nwas found to be 19 nm (Figure S1).\n\nThe acpcPNA probes were\ndesigned to detect the synthetic oligonucleotide targets with sequences\ncorresponding to MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV type 16. The sequences of\nacpcPNA probes are as follows:\n\nMERS-CoV: CTCTTCACATAATCG-LysNH2\n\nMTB: CAAGAAACACGTTAT-LysNH2\n\nHPV type\n16: CATACACCTCCAGC-LysNH2\n\n*(written in the N \u2192\nC direction)\n\nThe acpcPNA probe was synthesized by solid-phase\npeptide synthesis\nusing Fmoc chemistry, as previously described.44 At the C-terminus, lysinamide was included as a positively\ncharged group that could induce nanoparticle aggregation. All PNA\nwere purified by reverse-phase HPLC (C18 column, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic\nacid (TFA) in H2O\u2013MeOH gradient). The identity of\nthe acpcPNA was verified by MALDI-TOF MS analysis (Figure S2), and the purity was confirmed to be >90% by\nreverse-phase\nHPLC.\n\nA wax-printing technique was used to create PADs.50 The sensor was designed using Adobe Illustrator. The wax\ncolors were selected to be complementary to the colorimetric reactions\nto enhance visualization. For paper-based device fabrication, the\nwax design was printed onto Whatman grade 1 filter paper (VWR) using\na wax printer (Xerox Phaser 8860). The wax pattern was subsequently\nmelted at 175 \u00b0C for 50 s to generate the hydrophobic barriers\nand hydrophilic channels. The sensor was based on Origami concept\nconsisting of two layers.51,52 As shown in Scheme 1A, the base layer\ncontains four wax-defined channels extending outward from the sample\nreservoir (6 mm i.d.) and the top layer contains four detection and\ncontrol zones (4 mm i.d.). Scheme 1B illustrates operation of the multiplex sensor. First,\nthe sample reservoir of the top layer was punched to provide a solution\nconnection directly from the top to the bottom layer, and then the\ndevice was assembled by folding the top layer over the base layer\nto create the three-dimension origami paper-based device. A polydimethylsiloxane\n(PDMS) lid was used for holding the two layers together. The lid consisting\nof one 6 mm diameter hole over the sample reservoir and eight 4 mm\ndiameter holes over the colorimetric detection and control zones was\naligned over the device to provide consistent pressure across the\nsurface of the device. Next, the acpcPNA probe and AgNPs solution\nwere added onto the detection and control zones. Finally, the sample\nsolution was added onto the sample reservoir and flow through the\nchannels to wet the colorimetric detection zones.\n\nAccording to the concept\nof PNA-induced AgNPs aggregation,42,43 acpcPNA was\ndesigned as a specific probe for quantitative detection\nof synthetic MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV DNA targets. For colorimetric\ndetection, the detection zone was prepared by adding 10 \u03bcL of\nAgNPs in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) pH 7.4 in a ratio of\n5:1 (AgNPs: PBS), followed by 1 \u03bcL of specific acpcPNA probe.\nControl zones were prepared using the same conditions as the colorimetric\ndetection zones. Next, 25 \u03bcL of DNA target was added to the\nopen sample reservoir. Upon sample addition, solution moved outward\nthrough the channels to wet the colorimetric detection zone of the\ntop layer. Finally, the AgNPs aggregation occurred and the color intensity\nwas measured.\n\nThe detection images\nwere recorded\nusing a scanner (XEROX DocuMate 3220) and saved in JPEG format at\n600 dpi. ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) was used\nto analyze the mean intensity of the color for each colorimetric reaction\nzone by applying a color threshold window for removing the blue background.\nImages were then inverted, and the mean intensity was measured.20,53\n\nThe process of acpcPNA-induced\nAgNPs aggregation is shown in Scheme 2. The anionic AgNPs are initially well dispersed due\nto electrostatic repulsion. On addition of the cationic acpcPNA, the\nelectrostatic repulsion is shielded, resulting in nanoparticle aggregation.\nWhen complementary DNA (DNAcom) is present, the specific\nPNA\u2013DNA interaction outcompetes the less specific PNA\u2013AgNPs\ninteraction, resulting in a negatively charged PNA\u2013DNAcom duplex and deaggregation of the anionic nanoparticles.\nUpon addition of noncomplementary DNA (DNAnc), the acpcPNA\nshould remain bound to the AgNPs and no color change occurs. To prove\nthe concept, we designed and synthesized acpcPNA probes to detect\nsynthetic oligonucleotide targets with sequences corresponding to\nMERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV type 16. The photographs of the results are\nshown in Figure 1.\nThe yellow AgNPs turned red when the acpcPNA was added. When the solution\ncontained of the acpcPNA and DNAnc, the color also changed\nto red due to aggregation of the AgNPs. On the other hand, the color\nchanged from red (aggregated) to yellow (nonaggregated) in the presence\nof DNAcom, with the intensity dependent on the DNA concentration.\nNext, the sequence of adding the PNA probe and DNA target was investigated.\nAs shown in Figure S3, when equimolar DNAcom was added either before or after the addition of acpcPNA\nprobe into the AgNPs, the same color intensities were obtained indicating\nthat the sequence of adding acpcPNA and DNAcom did not\nimpact the final signal.\n\nThe influence\nof electrolyte solution on the aggregation behavior of citrate-stabilized\nAgNPs was investigated based on the CCC.54The CCC represents the electrolyte concentration required to cause\naggregation of the nanoparticles in the absence of acpcPNA. In Figure S4, the color intensity of citrate-stabilized\nAgNPs in the absence of acpcPNA probe is shown as a function of NaCl\nconcentration. The intensity and, therefore, the degree of aggregation,\nincreased with the concentration of NaCl, indicating that increasing\nionic strength led to enhanced aggregation.55 We believe that the ionic strength can decrease the electrostatic\nrepulsion of citrate-stabilized AgNPs as a result of shielding, accelerating\nthe AgNPs aggregation. The CCC was obtained when the degree of aggregation\nreached a maximum and became independent of NaCl concentration. In\nthis experiment, the CCC of citrate-stabilized AgNPs was found to\nbe 30 mM. Above this concentration, PNA-induced aggregation was not\nobserved.\n\nFor a colorimetric\nassay based on acpcPNA-induced AgNPs aggregation, assay parameters\nincluding 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) ratio and acpcPNA concentration were\noptimized using a simple paper-based design. The degree of AgNPs aggregation\nwas determined by measuring the color intensity of the resulting solution\nin the presence of acpcPNA without target DNA. First, the impact of\nthe PBS concentration on AgNPs aggregation was measured. The differential\ncolor intensity (\u0394 intensity, \u0394I) obtained\nbefore and after addition of acpcPNA as a function of AgNPs to PBS\nratio is shown in Figure 2A. \u0394I increased until the ratio of\nAgNPs/PBS reached 5:1 and then decreased until it plateaued at 5:2.\nThus, the ratio of 5:1 AgNPs/PBS was selected as the optimal condition\nbecause it gave the largest \u0394I. Another important\naspect for the DNA assay is probe concentration. The influence of\nacpcPNA probe concentration on absolute intensity was studied. As\nshown in Figure 2B,\nthe acpcPNA concentration was varied within a range of 0\u20132.5\n\u03bcM, and the highest aggregation was obtained at the concentration\nof 1.0 \u03bcM. At this concentration, the aggregation became independent\nof acpcPNA concentration, which was desirable for simplifying the\nassay. Higher concentrations of AgNPs were not tested in order to\nminimize reagent consumption. As a result, the optimal conditions\nconsisting of AgNPs/PBS ratio of 5:1 and acpcPNA concentration of\n1.0 \u03bcM were selected for further experiments.\n\nTo\ninvestigate the selectivity of this system, the color intensity obtained\nfrom the DNAcom of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV was compared\nto that of single-base mismatch (DNAm1), two-base mismatch\n(DNAm2), and DNAnc sequences. The color intensity\ndecreased significantly in the presence of DNAcom; whereas,\nthe intensity did not change for the mismatched and noncomplementary\ntargets (Figure 3).\nWe believe the affinity of PNA\u2013DNA hybridization was reduced\ndue to the contribution of one- and two-base mismatches, leaving free\nPNA to aggregate the nanoparticles. PNA\u2013DNAcom complex\ncan retard the ability of PNA to induce AgNPs aggregation as discussed\nabove and result in different color intensities. These results suggest\nthat the fully complementary DNA selectively hybridized the acpcPNA\nprobe and yielded measurable signals. In addition, bovine serum albumin\n(BSA), which is commonly used in cell culture protocols, was used\nto investigate the protein interference of the proposed system. The\nDNA target was prepared in the presence of 3% BSA solution. It was\nobserved that the color intensities of the DNA targets for MERS-CoV,\nMTB, and HPV in 3% BSA solution were statistically identical to the\nones without BSA (Figure S5). Hence, common\nproteins should not negatively affect the analysis of this system.\n\nTo assess the sensitivity of\nthe proposed method for DNA quantification, the intensity as a function\nof the target DNA concentration was determined. The color intensity\ndecreases with the target DNA concentration. The calibration curves\nfor each species are shown in Figure 4A, B, and C for MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV, respectively.\nThe linear range for each DNA target using a logarithmic DNA concentration\nand color intensity (Figure 4, inset) was also obtained. The analytical performances for\nall three DNA targets are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that a sufficiently low\ndetection limit could be obtained for MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV detection\nwithout the need for multiple PCR cycles. Moreover, this multiplex\nsystem can provide sensitive and selective detection for simultaneous\nanalysis of multiple DNA targets in a single device, which simplifies\nthe analysis compared to traditional diagnostics.9,56\u221259\n\nNext, a multiplex device (Scheme 1) was designed for simultaneous\ndetection of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV. The top layer contained four\ndetection zones and four control zones. Each zone contained AgNPs\nwith a single acpcPNA probe to provide selectivity for DNA. The base\nlayer contained four wax-defined channels extending outward from a\nsample inlet. After the device was folded and stacked together, the\nchannels of the base layer were connected to four detection zones\nof the top layer. Upon sample addition, the solution moved outward\nthrough the channels of the base layer to wet the colorimetric detection\nzones of the top layer and lead to color change. Figure 5 illustrates the ability of\nthe proposed sensor for detection of 100 nM MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV.\nOnly the colorimetric detection zones that contained the selective\nprobes changed color compared to their control zones. This result\nindicated that the multiplex paper-based colorimetric sensor is promising\nfor simultaneous determination of MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV.\n\nA multiplex colorimetric PAD was developed\nfor simultaneous detection\nof DNA associated with viral and bacterial infectious diseases, including\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and human papillomavirus\n(HPV). AgNPs were used as a colorimetric reagent for DNA detection\nbased on acpcPNA-induced nanoparticle aggregation. This colorimetric\nDNA sensor exhibited high selectivity against single-base mismatch,\ntwo-base mismatch and noncomplementary target DNA. Under the optimized\ncondition, the limit of detection for MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV were\nfound to be 1.53, 1.27, and 1.03 nM, respectively. As a result, this\ndeveloped multiplex colorimetric PAD could be a low-cost and disposable\nalternative tool for rapid screening and detecting in infectious diagnostics."}
