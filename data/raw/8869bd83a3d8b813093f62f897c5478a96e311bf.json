As of March 8, 2020, more than 105 000 laboratoryconfirmed cases and more than 3500 deaths in over 100 countries had been reported.\n\nSince SARS-CoV-2 RNA was first detected in a stool specimen of the first reported COVID-19 case in the USA, 1 much attention has been paid to the study and reporting of gastrointestinal tract infection of SARS-CoV-2. According to a study 2 including 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 552 hospitals in China as of Jan 29, 2020, nausea or vomiting, or both, and diarrhoea were reported in 55 (5\u00b76%) and 42 (3\u00b78%) patients. Autopsy studies are crucial to help understand the involvement of COVID-19 in the digestive system; however, to date, there has been only one autopsy report 3 for a man aged 85 years with COVID-19, which showed segmental dilatation and stenosis in the small intestine. Whether this finding is secondary to COVID-19 or a preexisting gastrointestinal comorbidity is unknown.\n\nCOVID-19 has implications for the management of patients with pre-existing digestive diseases. Indeed, the presence and number of comorbidities is associated with poorer clinical outcome in patients with COVID-19. In the study 2 of 1099 patients with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19, 261 (23\u00b77%) patients with COVID-19 reported having at least one comorbidity, with hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease being the most common. In this study, 2 23 (2\u00b71%) patients had hepatitis B infection. Severe cases were more likely to have hepatitis B infection (2\u00b74% vs 0\u00b76%) than non-severe cases. Abnormal liver function tests, including elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were noted. 2 Liver abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 might be due to viral infection in liver cells but could also be due to other causes such as drug toxicity and systemic inflammation. 4 Data suggest that liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases than in mild cases of COVID-19. 4 However, data about other underlying chronic liver conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis, and their effect on prognosis of COVID-19 needs to be further evaluated.\n\nLiver transplantation might involve a risk of transmission of viral infection from donor to recipient, as shown in the previous SARS outbreak, and therefore donor screening and testing is crucial. 5 Although many patients had comorbidities in the reported series, 2 none had been a transplant recipient. Transplant clinicians are encouraged to follow guidance issued by The Transplantation Society, 6 as well as local health department guidelines for isolating, quarantining, testing, and monitoring returned travellers from endemic areas.\n\nPatients with cancer in general are more susceptible to infection due to their immunocompromised status caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments. However, whether patients with gastrointestinal cancers are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than healthy individuals remains unknown. In a recent nationwide analysis from China, 7 18 (1%) of 1590 COVID-19 cases had a history of cancer. Among these 18 cases, three had a history of colorectal cancer (one colonic tubular adenocarcinoma, one rectal carcinoma, and one colorectal carcinoma). 7 Patients with COVID-19 and cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events; several strategies have been proposed, such as intentional postponing of adjuvant chemotherapy or elective surgery on a patient-bypatient basis, stronger personal protection provisions, and more intensive surveillance or treatment. 7 Given the use of biologics and immunosuppressive agents, whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection has raised great concern. Currently no patients with IBD have been reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the IBD Elite Union, which incorporates the seven largest IBD referral centres in China with more than 20 000 patients with IBD. 8 Furthermore, no patients with IBD with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported from the three largest tertiary IBD centres in Wuhan (Tongji Hospital, Union Hospital, and Zhongnan Hospital) at the time that this manuscript was prepared (March 8, 2020) .\n\nSeveral strategies have been implemented in China to minimise the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with IBD since the outbreak of COVID-19. First, the Chinese IBD Society issued official guidelines for managing patients with IBD in early February 2020. 9 The guidelines include practical recommendations on the use of immunosuppressive agents and biologics, diet, and intentional post ponement of elective surgery and endoscopy, as well as personal protection provisions; these are outlined in the panel. Second, the China Crohn's & Colitis Foundation has organised a group of volunteer gastroenterologists that specialise in IBD to offer online consultancy to patients with IBD since Jan 29, 2020. Third, an online virtual IBD visit programme has been initiated in some IBD centres, which provides convenient and cost-effective care, and could potentially reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by avoiding close contact with infected patients in public areas. With the increasing concern from patients with IBD globally, helpful online resources about COVID-19 have been provided by international non-profit organisations such as Crohn's Colitis of Foundation America and Crohn's & Colitis UK. 10, 11 Such guidance and advice should be delivered urgently to health-care workers as well as patients with IBD.\n\nThe comorbidity spectrum of digestive conditions and its impact on treatment and outcome of COVID-19 remains largely unknown. Further data need to be analysed from the COVID-19 cohort established by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, which would help to more precisely ascertain the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with digestive comorbidities such as IBD. These data and experience with guidance on how to manage patients with underlining comorbidities in China could facilitate integrated care for patients globally.\n\nWe declare no competing interests.
