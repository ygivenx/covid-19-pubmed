[4, 5] This led to the search for rational regimens to treat the helical nucleocapsid; this protein is also important for viral RNA infection, including the generation of vaccines [6] [7] [8] and the design synthesis. The S protein is a glycoprotein on the viral surface and of inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication. [9] The most promising is responsible for viral attachment and entry into host cells. The M protein is necessary for virus budding and the E protein for virus cleavage.

Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) and its Application a hairpin loop. Each of the methods has both advantages and disadvantages. Recently, numerous papers have reported siRNA RNA interference is an endogenous cellular process for the technology as a potent tool to knock-down gene expression or its inhibition of gene expression mediated by sequence-specific therapeutic potential for treatment of various human diseases double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). This phenomenon was first ranging from cancers [18] to infectious diseases (e.g. HIV, hepatiobserved in petunia flowers, and later reported in Caenorhabditis tis). [14] In this review, we focus on the application of siRNA elegans. [12] These dsRNAs, 21-23 bp in length, are produced by technology to SARS.

When produced, the small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes can activate a process of degradation of mRNA transcripts containing target sequences. This process is driven by the 2.

Interestingly, Syndrome-Associated Coronavirus when dsRNAs are artificially generated either by direct chemical synthesis or by folding single RNA into short dsRNAs with a As the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV was determined and hairpin loop, they can target the specific mRNA sequences and its mechanism of replication became apparent (similar to others in induce degradation of the mRNA.

The initial report came from two groups using the chemithe application of siRNAs to down-regulation of gene expression cal synthesis strategy. [20, 21] The first group showed that two of six becomes a reality are: (i) generation of effective dsRNAs; and (ii) chemically synthesized siRNAs, based on the SARS-CoV genome delivery of the dsRNAs into targeted cells or organs. To address sequence, resulted in the inhibition of viral cytopathic effect (CPE) the first issue, researchers have established two strategies. The in Vero-E6 cells infected with strain Y3-SARS-CoV. [21] The curfirst one is to chemically synthesize siRNA. [15] In this method, two sory evaluation of the CPE of the transfected cells provided single-stranded, complementary, short RNA oligonucleotides are evidence that siRNA might be effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV synthesized. These two short oligonucleotides are then annealed replication. The second group demonstrated that three of six into a dsRNA in a test tube.
