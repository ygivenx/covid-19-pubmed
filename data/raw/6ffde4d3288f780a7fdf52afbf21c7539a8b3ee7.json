{"title": "Humoral immune response to Salmonella abortusovis in sheep: in vitro induction of an antibody synthesis from either sensitized or unprimed lymph node cells", "body": "Facultative intracellular bacteria, such as Salmonella, Brucella or Listeria, are considered to be major pathogenic agents for all domestic animal species and could be transmitted to humans. The pathogenesis of these infections involves a step of bacterial dissemination from the inoculation site to the liver and spleen through the draining lymph nodes. Bacterial colonization of lymph node draining the inoculation area has been described after experimental infections by the conjunctival Plommet, 1975, 1976) and the subcutaneous routes (Pardon, 1977; Pardon and Marly, 1979; Lantier, 1987 ) , but mechanisms restricting the bacterial dissemination are poorly understood.\n\nMechanisms of host defense involve both cellular and humoral immune reactions. Immune responses induced within lymph nodes seem to play a fundamental role in control of the infectious process. T-lymphocyte responses appear late, from nearly the tenth day following infection (Maskell et al., 1987 ) , and are responsible for granuloma formation (Guilloteau et al., 1991 ) . However, in cell-transfer experiments studying protective mechanisms, it has been shown that T-cells from lymph nodes were more efficient than spleen cells in the transfer of anti-Brucella immunity to mice (Plommet and Plommet, 1987 ) . Antibody production from B-cells occurs earlier in infection and is usually considered as the first evidence of the bacterial contamination. With their agglutinin and opsonin properties, specific antibodies secreted within lymphoid tissue would be involved in control of the bacterial colonization of lymph nodes, as has been previously described (Pardon, 1977; Plommet and Plommet, 1989) .\n\nWith a suitable size for the development of surgical procedures (Miyasaka and Trnka, 1985; Hopkins et al., 1985; Lascelles et al., 1988) , sheep represent the best model for studying the role of lymph nodes in restricting bacterial dissemination from the inoculation site. The establishment of an experimental model of infection by Salmonella abortusovis, a serotype specific for sheep which induces abortion and sometimes mortality of newborn lambs (Pardon et al., 1990b) , gives the opportunity to study the Salmonella pathogenesis pattern in its natural host. In mice, experimental inoculation of S. abortusovis results in an infection similar to the one developed after Salmonella typhimurium administration (Pardon and Marly, 1979; Lantier et al., 1981 ) .\n\nThe intensity of bacterial dissemination through lymph nodes can vary according to the bacterial strain virulence (Fontaine et al., 1994) and according to the expression of the host genetic resistance (Plant and Glynn, 1976; Hormaeche, 1979a,b; O'Brien, 1986; Hormaeche and Maskell, 1989; Oswald et al., 1992 ) . Previous work has shown that after intravenous or subcutaneous inoculation of sheep with the vaccinal Rv6 strain of S. abortusovis (Lantier et al., 1983; Pardon et al., 1990a) , blood levels of the specific humoral immune response determined by ELISA tests were closely related to the animal susceptibility to the disease, measured by the bacterial infection level in spleen, liver and lymph nodes. Greater bacterial numbers were detected from infected organs, and higher anti-S, abortusovis antibody titres were measured in blood (A.V. Gautier and F. Lantier, unpublished data, 1990) .\n\nTo better understand the mechanisms controlling bacterial dissemination through lymph nodes and to study in detail interactions between Salmonella and host phagocytic cells Heffron, 1989, 1991; Finlay and Falkow, 1989) which play an antigen-presenting cell (APC) function towards lymph node lymphocytes, an in vitro assay allowing the induction of an antibody synthesis from both in vivo sensitized and unprimed sheep leucocytes had to be set up.\n\nThis report describes an in vitro assay performed with sheep lymph node cells, maintained in culture with S. abortusovis bacteria. The in vitro antibody synthesis induced after the antigenic stimulation was revealed, either by enumerating anti-S, abortusovis antibody-secreting cells using ELISASPOT assays, or by titration of antigen-specific antibodies secreted into culture supernatants using ELISA assays. The comparison between ELISASPOT and ELISA data allows study at the cellular level and leads to a more detailed approach of the ovine humoral immune response.\n\nThe in vitro secondary antibody response has been assessed from three different culture experiments, carried out with in vivo primed lymph node cells from three sheep, respectively, of the Prralpes du Sud flock of the Laboratory of Infectious Pathology and Immunology. Those 10-to 19-month-old animals were immunized intravenously with 108 bacteria of the live attenuated vaccinal Rv6 strain of S. abortusovis (Lantier et al., 1981; Pardon et al., 1990b) and then killed 1 month later. Unprimed lymph node cells from two 4-monthold lie-de-France lambs were used to study the in vitro-induced primary humoral immune response. For each slaughtered sheep, cell cultures were performed from the prescapular, mediastinal, precrural, iliac and hepatic lymph nodes. Reported results represent mean values of the individual data and the standard errors (mean ___ SEM ).\n\nBacterial suspensions of the vaccinal S. abortusovis Rv6 strain (Lantier et al., 1981; Pardon et al., 1990b) , either inoculated into sheep or a source of antigen for the in vitro lymph node cell cultures and the immunoenzymatic assays (ELISA and ELISASPOT tests), were prepared as previously described (Pardon and Marly, 1979; Lantier et al., 1981 ) . Briefly, stored at -70 \u00b0 C in spleens of inoculated mice, bacteria were then grown on tryptic soy agar (Bio-M6rieux) slopes for 18 h at 37\u00b0C and harvested in phosphate buffered saline (saline, pH 6.85 ). These bacterial suspensions were standardized turbidimetrically. Purity of cultures and numbers of viable organisms were checked by plating serial dilutions.\n\nUsed as antigenic preparations in sheep leucocyte cultures, the bacterial suspensions were heat killed by treatment at 60\u00b0C for 2 h (Lantier et al., 1983 ) and then stored at -70\u00b0C. Before use, inactivated bacteria were washed twice in saline at 5000 X g, 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. Appropriate dilutions were performed in culture medium (see below).\n\nFor the coating step of ELISA and ELISASPOT microtiter plates, bacterial suspensions were first killed by heating at 60 \u00b0C for 2 h, then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 1% phenol in saline and washed twice at 2500Xg, 4\u00b0C for 30 min in 0.5% phenol-saline. This stock suspension was standardized turbidimetrically, adjusted to the concentration of 3.8X l09 bacteria ml-~ by appropriate dilution in 0.5% phenol-saline and then stored at 4 \u00b0C (adapted from Williams and Whittemore, 1973 ) .\n\nLymph node cell suspensions were prepared according to a technique previously set up for the isolation of sheep peripheral blood mononuclear cells. First, lymph nodes were washed in MEM (Gibco, 041-01380 ) supplemented with 2.5% heat-inactivated normal lamb serum (NLS), 200 U ml-1 of penicillin (Sigma, P-3032) and 0.2 mg ml-~ of streptomycin (Sigma, S-9137 ) (2.5% NLS-MEM).\n\nCells were released from organs by cutting the lymphoid tissues into small pieces with scissors in 2.5% NLS-MEM. Cellular suspensions were then filtered on gauze to remove cell debris and layered on Ficoll gradient (Histopaque 1077, Sigma, 1077-1 ). After a 1600Xg centrifugation for 20 min at room temperature, lymph node leucocytes were collected at the Histopaque-MEM interface and washed three times with 2.5% NLS-MEM at 400 \u00d7 g, 4 \u00b0 C for 15 rain. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue dye exclusion test and the cell suspensions were adjusted to a final concentration of 1.25 X 107 viable leucocytes per ml of culture medium. The culture medium used was RPMI-1640 (Gibco, 041-01870) supplemented with either 10% heat-inacti-vated fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco, 011-06290 M) or 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (HS, Gibco, 034-06050 H), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, 043-05030 H), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 043-01360 H), 5X 10 -5 M 2mercaptoethanol (Serva, A 28625 ) and antibiotics ( 10% FCS-RPMI or 10% HS-RPMI).\n\nLymph node cell cultures, involving an in vitro antigenic stimulation, were carried out according to a technique previously set up (Berthon et al., 1990 ) and using different concentrations of either heat-inactivated S. abortusovis Rv6 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella abortusequi (phenol extract, Sigma, L-5886) dissolved in culture medium. This LPS presents O-antigen specificities identical to LPS from S. abortusovis (Le Minor, 1984) .\n\nAntigenic boost in vitro was achieved by mixing, in each well of tissue culture 24-well plates (Linbro, Flow Laboratories, 76-033-05 ), 0.4 ml of lymph node cell suspension ( 5 \u00d7 106 cells per well) with 0.1 ml of either heat-killed bacterial suspensions (5 X 106, 5 \u00d7 107 and 5 \u00d7 108 bacteria per well, i.e. one, ten and 100 bacteria per lymph node cell) or LPS dilutions corresponding to final concentrations of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 #g ml-1 (final volume of 0.5 ml per well). In both cases, cell cultures were performed using medium supplemented with 10% serum from fetal calf or adult horse. In control cultures, the addition of antigen was replaced with 0.1 ml of culture medium. Cultures were performed for 2 weeks and every 2 days supernatant samples were taken from each well (0.1 ml for the first sample and 0.4 ml for the others) and fresh culture medium (0.5 ml per well) was added. At the same time, lymph node cells from at least two wells were harvested and cell survival was assessed by enumerating viable leucocytes from samples using the trypan blue dye exclusion test. Results were expressed, according to the duration of culture, as percentages of the living lymph node cells initially put into culture.\n\nELISASPOT tests were performed using microtiter plates with 96 flat-bottomed wells (Nunc, Immunoplates, 4-42404) coated with inactivated S. abortusovis bacteria. The enumeration of antibody-secreting cells by ELISAS-POT test makes it necessary to perform an homogeneous and regular coating of antigen into microtiter plates; hence, the technique set up for coating bacteria on ELISASPOT plates was slightly different from the one used for ELISA plates (see below) and from the technique previously described with Salmonella typhi (Kantele, 1990) .\n\nMicrotiter plates were first pre-treated with 0.1 ml per well of a 0.2% glutaraldehyde aqueous solution and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C (Logtenberg et al., 1985 ) . After a wash with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.5 ), plates were filled with 0.1 ml per well of the stock bacterial suspension diluted 1 : 10 in saline (3.8 X 107 bacteria per well) and incubated overnight at 4 o C. Then, plates were twice washed carefully with PBS and the protein adhesiveness of the wells was blocked with 5% bovine skimmed milk in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, followed by a wash with PBS.\n\nELISASPOT tests were carried out with sheep lymph node cells primed in vivo and boosted in vitro. After every 2 days of culture, cell samples were prepared as described elsewhere (Berthon et al., 1990) . Briefly, lymph node cells from several wells were harvested and washed in 5% FCS-MEM to remove free antibodies. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue dye exclusion test and several dilutions from each cell sample were prepared in 10% FCS-RPMI and put into microtiter plates. Negative controls were performed on plates coated with the B 19 strain of Brucella abortus, which is a Gramnegative bacterium showing no antigenic cross-reactivity with S. abortusovis (Diaz and Bosseray, 1974) , inactivated by heat and formol (gift from Dr. G. Dubray, INRA, Laboratory of Infectious Pathology and Immunology, Nouz-iUy, France). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 h and then removed. Antibodies secreted locally by B-lymphocytes were revealed as spots using an immunoenzymatic technique involving alkaline phosphatase conjugate Holt, 1983, 1986; Bianchi et al., 1990) . In the present assay, a first overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C was performed using rabbit antibodies to sheep immunoglobulins (Ig) (Dako, Z 138 ), diluted 1:7500 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Merck, 822 184) and 20% skimmed milk (Tweenmilk-PBS). A second incubation was carried out at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine Ig to rabbit Ig (Dako, D 306) diluted 1:650 in Tween-milk-PBS. The enzymatic activity was revealed using as substrate 5-bromo 4-chloro 3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma, B-8503) in agarose (Sigma, A-6013) Holt, 1983, 1986) , at the rate of 0.05 ml per well, incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark, enabling well-contrasted blue spots to be obtained. Alkaline phosphatase activity was stopped by adding 0.05 ml per well of 3 N sodium hydroxide solution and plates were stored at 4 \u00b0C until reading. The numbers of spots per well were counted using an Olympus CK2 inverted microscope (40-and 100-fold magnification).\n\nSince assays were performed on pools of several wells, they represented averages of several lymph node cell cultures. As shown by the results obtained from the different dilutions of samples, the numbers of spots were directly proportional to leucocyte concentration. Taking the cell culture recoveries into account, the results were expressed, according to the culture duration, as the decimal logarithm of the spot-forming cell (SFC) numbers per 106 lymph node cells initially put into culture.\n\nAnti-S. abortusovis antibodies secreted into lymph node cell culture supernatants were detected according to different ELISA techniques. Amounts of the whole of specific antibodies were determined on microtiter plates coated with bacteria while Ig-isotype of in vitro produced antibodies were studied on both bacteria-and LPS-coated plates.\n\nELISA tests on bacteria were performed using 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner, Labortechnik, No. 655 161 ), filled with 0.05 ml per well ( 1.9 \u00d7 107 bacteria per well) of a 1 : 10 dilution in saline of the stock suspension of inactivated S. abortusovis, also used for ELISASPOT tests. Plates were left to dry overnight at 37 \u00b0 C. After two washes with tap water and a wash with PBS, bacterial antigens were fixed for 20 min at -20\u00b0C with 0.2 ml per well of a cold 80% (v/v) acetone-water solution and then, washed as before. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating plates with 0.1 ml per well of 5% bovine skimmed milk in PBS for 15 min at room temperature.\n\nWhen the LPS fraction was used as immobilized antigen, 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Immunoplates, 4-42404) were coated with 0.05 ml per well of a 1 mg ml -~ stock solution of LPS prepared in a 50% (v/v) PBS-glycerol mixture and diluted 1 : 100 in 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) (0.5/zg per well). After an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C, plates were washed twice with tap water, once with PBS and then incubated with bovine milk as described previously.\n\nIn both cases, following two washes with PBS, culture supernatant samples with unknown antibodies were added (0.1 ml per well ) after serial 1 : 3 dilutions in Tween-milk-PBS and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Positive controls were performed with a specific anti-S, abortusovis serum from a hyperimmunized sheep used as reference sample in each test. Negative controls were carried out with 0.1 ml per well of fresh lymph node cell culture medium.\n\nAmounts of the whole of secreted anti-Salmonella antibodies were revealed using peroxidase-conjugated rabbit Ig to sheep IgG (H and L chains) (Nordic), 1:3000 diluted in Tween-milk-PBS and incubated for 90 min at 37 o C. Ig-isotype was studied on bacteria-and LPS-coated plates using appropriate dilutions of mouse monoclonal antibodies to sheep IgG1, IgG2 (Beh, 1987 ) and sheep IgM (Beh, 1988 ) (ascitic fluids kindly provided by Dr. K.J. Beh, CSIRO, Division of Animal Health, McMaster Laboratory, Glebe, Australia). After a 90 min incubation at 37 \u00b0 C, monoclonal antibody binding was detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat Ig to mouse IgG (H and L chains) (Bio-Rad, No. 172-1011 ), 1 : 10 000 diluted in Tween-milk-PBS and incubated for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C. Between each of the steps, plates were washed four times with tap water and three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in saline. The peroxidase activity was detected with 2,2'-azino-bis-( 3-ethyl benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Boehringer Mannheim)/H202 substrate solution and read at 415 nm (Bernard et al., 1986 ) . Optical densities were obtained according to the serial 1 : 3 dilutions of samples allowed to obtain ELISA logistic curves. These curves underwent conversion to logits to get linear functions enabling the determination of the sample dilution for the point of inflexion of the ELISA logistic curves.\n\nResults were expressed as antibody titres. Antibody titres were equivalent to the logarithm base 3 (log3) of the sample dilution for which the point of inflexion of the corresponding ELISA logistic curve was reached.\n\nWith regard to the in vitro induction of a secondary antibody response from in vivo primed lymph node cells, boosted in vitro with either heat-inactivated S. abortusovis or LPS from S. abortusequi, cell recoveries decreased throughout the experiments (Table 1 ). From about 60% on Day 2 of culture, values fell to nearly 40% on Day 4 and to 35% on Day 6 until Day 10. Afterwards, lower survival rates (20%) could be observed from some samples, especially from those maintained with HS and stimulated with LPS. Despite antigenic boost in vitro, cell recovery from stimulated samples did not seem to significantly differ from control values. The greatest survival rates (45-50%) were obtained when cells were cultured in the presence of the highest concentration Table 1 Characteristics of the antibody responses induced from in vivo sensitized lymph node cells, boosted in vitro with either heat-inactivated S. abortusovis (SAO) (one, ten and 100 bacteria per cell) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.01, 0.1 and 1/tg ml-~ ). Cell cultures were carried out in the presence of fetal calf serum or horse serum. For each sample, reported data include the maximum of the antibody response (expressed as the logm of the maximal number of spot-forming cells (SCF) per 106 cells initially put into culture; mean_+ SEM, n = 3 ), the day of culture corresponding to this peak of the immune response and the cell culture recovery observed on this day (expressed as the percentage of living cells initially put into culture; mean + SEM, n = 3 )\n\nFetal calf serum Horse serum of inactivated S. abortusovis ( 100 bacteria per cell), during the second week of culture. The stimulation in vitro with LPS (from 0.01 to 1/tg ml-' ) showed no mitogenic effect of this fraction on the cultured lymph node cells. Concentration of LPS higher than 1/tg ml-1 was cytotoxic, whereas a concentration of 0.001/zg ml-1 gave similar results to those reported (data not shown).\n\nA similar range of cell recoveries was observed during the induction of the primary antibody response, from unprimed lymph node cell cultures in vitro stimulated with 100 S. abortusovis per leucocyte in the presence of FCS ( Table 2 ) .\n\nFrom lymph node cells of immunized sheep, re-stimulated in vitro with either inactivated Salmonella (Figs. 1 (a) and 1 (b)) or LPS (Table 1 ) , cells secreting specific antibody to S. abortusovis were enumerated at 2-day intervals using an ELISASPOT technique.\n\nAn humoral immune response mainly appeared when lymph node cells underwent an antigenic boost in vitro with whole bacteria, compared with the LPS stimulation (Table 1 ) . Whatever the LPS concentration, this antigen led to an early and weak response, characterized by a peak on the fourth day of culture and a magnitude lower than ten SFC per 106 leucocytes. No more SFC were detected by Day 8 (data not shown ).\n\nThe profile and magnitude of the kinetics of the SFC numbers, induced after the boost with inactivated bacteria, were almost similar according to the antigen concentration (Figs. 1 (a) and 1 (b) ). The lowest in vitro antigenic stimulation (one bacterium per cell) led to the earliest induction of antibody synthesis, detected as soon as the fourth day of culture. Maximal SFC num- (1994) (Table 1 ) .\n\nIn both cases, a few or no SFC were detected from control samples, in which in vivo primed cells have been cultured without antigenic stimulation. Resuits obtained at the same time, using B. abortus B 19 as coated antigen for the ELISASPOT assay, showed that all these SFC were secreting specific anti-S.\n\nParallel to the ELISASPOT technique which allowed the enumeration of specific antibody-secreting cells from lymph node cell cultures, ELISA assays were carried out to determine amounts of anti-S, abortusovis antibodies secreted into culture supernatants (Figs. 1 (c) and 1 (d) ).\n\nMagnitudes of the antibody responses, measured by ELISA technique on the fourteenth day of antigenic stimulation, were higher from cell cultures performed with FCS than those observed from cultures with HS, whereas the kinetics of the SFC numbers did not differ with the kind of serum used (Figs.  1 (a) and 1 (b) ).\n\nKinetic profiles induced in FCS increased throughout the culture duration while those characterizing responses in HS increased until Day 12 and then reached a plateau phase. After the LPS boost in vitro, no antibody was detected from samples maintained in HS (data not shown). A very weak immune response appeared from FCS cultures, with a peak on Day 6 (maximal antibody titre, obtained with the 0.1/zg ml-~ LPS concentration, was equal to 0.48_+0.11 ), and no more antibody was revealed by Day 10 (data not shown). No antibody was detected from unstimulated lymph node cell culture supernatants.\n\nResults on the amounts of secreted antibodies, when cells were re-stimulated with inactivated bacteria, showed an effect of the antigen concentration on the kinetics of the antibody response (Figs. 1 (c) and (d) ). The earliest immune reactions and the highest antibody titres were observed from samples stimulated with the lowest bacterial concentration. Maximal titres reached on Day 14 were, according to increasing antigen concentrations (one, ten and 100 bacteria per cell), 5.45+2.21, 6.19+3.40 and 3.47+0.87 in FCS and 3.93_+0.50, 2.96_+0.35 and 2.81 +0.19 in HS, respectively.\n\nWhatever the serum used, according to the increasing amounts of bacteria per cell, secreted antibody could be detected from Day 6, Day 8 and Day 10, respectively, while under identical conditions the SFC could be revealed from Day 4 in the presence of one bacterium per cell and from the sixth day of culture both in the presence of ten and 100 bacteria per cell. Hence, at low bacterial concentration (one and ten S. abortusovis per leucocyte), a 2 day lag was observed between the appearance of the SFC and the detection of antibodies secreted into culture supernatants. With a higher antigen concentration of 100 bacteria per cell, this interval increased and the lag reached 4 days. This suggests that large amount of bacteria could adsorb antibody and then induce a decrease of the antibody titres determined by ELISA. These results show that optimal in vitro culture conditions involved the use of FCS instead of HS and an antigen concentration of the order of one to ten bacteria per cell.\n\nIg-isotypes expressed by the anti-S, abortusovis antibodies secreted into supernatants of in vivo primed lymph node cell cultures were studied by an Fig. 2 IgM titres were obtained with ten and 100 bacteria per cell, whereas maximal IgG 1 antibody synthesis was detected in the presence of one and ten bacteria per cell. When humoral responses were studied on their specificity against LPS, their kinetic profiles were identical to those determined on inactivated whole bacteria. Titres of anti-LPS IgM were always higher than those measured on S. abortusovis. The anti-LPS IgG 1 synthesis was detected later than the anti-S. abortusovis IgG1 production, with a 2 day lag, and showed a lower magnitude. The weak and late anti-S, abortusovis IgG2 response also contained some anti-LPS IgG2, detected on Day 14 of the culture, only from samples stimulated with one bacterium per cell (data not shown).\n\nFrom lymph node cell cultures with FCS, a very small and early anti-S. abortusovis humoral response was induced with a LPS stimulation. These immune reactions were composed of IgM and IgG 1 antibody (data not shown). Kinetics of IgM titres were identical to those described for the whole of anti-S. abortusovis antibodies, with a peak on Day 6 and no more antibody from Day I 0. As previously, anti-LPS IgM titres were higher than the IgM titres against whole Salmonella. Traces of IgG 1 were detected only on Day 8 of the culture and only by ELISA performed on fixed whole bacteria.\n\nIn vitro antibody synthesis during the primary immune response Figure 3 reports ELISA data obtained from in vivo unprimed lymph node cells of two lambs, which were maintained in vitro without or with an antigen concentration of 100 heat-inactivated bacteria per leucocyte for 2 weeks in the presence of FCS. Similar results were observed from cell cultures performed with HS (data not shown ).\n\nResults revealed that this kind of humoral response was mainly composed of IgM antibodies which appeared from the eighth day of culture. Defined either on whole bacteria or on LPS, the kinetic profiles of those IgM responses were characterized by a peak on Day 12. As previously observed during the secondary antibody response, anti-LPS IgM titres were always higher than titres of the anti-S, abortusovis IgM. Some anti-S, abortusovis IgG1 antibodies were detected on whole bacteria-coated plates during the second week of the culture experiments, from the tenth day. No IgG2 was revealed according to either kind of ELISA technique used and no antibody synthesis was shown from supernatants of leucocyte cultures performed without antigenic stimulation.\n\nThis study describes a new assay for an in vitro antibody synthesis, specific to bacterial antigens, from lymph node cells of unprimed lambs and sheep immunized by the intravenous route to get a general antigenic sensitization of the lymph nodes and killed 1 month later when no more bacteria were present within lymphoid tissues (Pardon et al., 1990a) .\n\nCulture conditions were derived from those previously established with pig leucocytes, stimulated in vitro with viral antigens (Berthon et al., 1990) . From the sera available in the author's laboratory and checked by ELISA, only sera from fetal calf and adult horse were found devoid of antibody cross-reacting with bacteria (data not shown). Hence, FCS, considered to be Ig-free, and HS, with supposed low mitogenic properties, have been chosen to carry out sheep leucocyte cultures.\n\nFrom cultures of either in vivo sensitized or unprimed sheep lymph node cells, according to the serum used as culture medium supplement, no great difference appeared concerning cell culture recoveries. Differences were rather induced with the kind of antigen stimulation performed in vitro. The highest cell recoveries were observed with the concentration of inactivated Salmonella of 100 bacteria per cell. Higher amounts of inactivated S. abortusovis per well have been tested ( 160 bacteria per cell), corresponding to the antigen concentration of the stock suspension of Salmonella. These conditions led to similar results to those obtained with the former bacterial concentration (data not shown). Culture conditions defined in this report differ from those previously described for pig blood lymphocytes stimulated with bacterial antigens such as membrane components of Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae (Borthwick et al., 1988 ) . In that case, the boost in vitro had to be carried out in the form of an antigenic pulse for 16 h to keep the cells clear of the cytotoxic effect of such antigens. Results on cell culture recoveries from sheep lymph node leucocytes stimulated with inactivated S. abortusovis, showed that these cells could be maintained in the presence of whole bacteria throughout the experiments. Some samples were cultured for 1 month (data not shown).\n\nWithin the concentrations tested, inactivated Salmonella appeared to exert no cytotoxic effect over sheep leucocytes.\n\nIn vitro antigenic boost of in vivo primed leucocytes was also performed using LPS to study the effect of this component of the cell wall of Gramnegative bacteria on the immune response from sheep lymphocytes stimulated in vivo with living whole bacteria. The LPS used in these experiments, at higher amounts than 1/~g m1-1, was cytotoxic for sheep leucocytes (data not shown ). In the range of 0.001 to 1/tg ml-~, no mitogenic effect was demonstrated throughout the culture duration. From in vivo primed lymph node cells, in vitro LPS boost induced a very weak and short immune antibody response, suggesting a lack of a polyclonal activation of the Salmonella-specific B-cells.\n\nIn vitro antigenic boost with inactivated whole bacteria of in vivo primed sheep lymph node cells led to the expression of a well-developed immune antibody response, detected either by ELISASPOT or by ELISA tests. This secondary humoral immune response was S. abortusovis specific and very low background was revealed from control cultures, whatever the serum used. Although identical numbers of SFC (measured by ELISASPOT) were induced from samples, antibody titres (determined by ELISA) were higher in the presence of FCS than those observed with HS. This would suggest that, according to the in vitro culture conditions, lymph node cells boosted in the presence of FCS were able to secrete, at the cellular level, more antibodies than the same cells maintained in HS. The antibody production in vitro was detected only if leucocytes, even after an in vivo immunization, were re-stimulated with bacteria. No spontaneous antibody secretion was shown from in vivo primed lymph node cells put into culture without antigen.\n\nIn the presence of an antigen concentration of one and ten bacteria per cell, SFC were first detected from the fourth and the sixth day of culture, respectively, while the corresponding antibody secretions into culture supernatants could be measured from Day 6 and Day 8. This 2 day lag between the enumeration of antibody-secreting cells and the titration of synthesized antibody has already been observed (Berthon et al., 1990) . When leucocytes were re-e. Berthon et al. / Veterinary lrnmunology and lmmunopathology 41 (1994) [275] [276] [277] [278] [279] [280] [281] [282] [283] [284] [285] [286] [287] [288] [289] [290] [291] [292] [293] [294] stimulated in vitro with higher bacterial concentrations ( 100 bacteria per cell), the SFC numbers slightly increased but the lag between ELISASPOT and ELISA results reached 4 days, suggesting that some antibodies secreted into culture supernatants were adsorbed by the antigen. So data from both techniques of antibody detection appeared to be less closely related. For this reason, an antigen concentration from one to ten bacteria per cell, allowing a good expression of SFC without great antibody adsorption, has been chosen for further experiments.\n\nKinetic profiles of the SFC numbers from in vivo primed cells, boosted in vitro, showed an ascending stage from Day 4 until about Day 10 and then reached a plateau phase to Day 14. Kinetic profiles of the SFC numbers previously determined from lymphocytes directly isolated from humans immunized with S. typhi vaccine (Kantele, 1990; or from sheep vaccinated with a mutant strain of S. typhimurium (Lascelles et al., 1988) , without an in vitro boost step, were characterized by a narrow peak on Days 5 or 7 after immunization. So, the antigenic re-stimulation step, performed in vitro with inactivated bacteria, seems to further a long-lasting humoral immune response. This might be dependent upon the nature of the antigen used and, especially on the presence of LPS into the cell wall of bacteria (Ruttkowski and Nixdorff, 1980) . These secondary antibody responses to S. abortusovis, from sheep lymph node cell cultures, were mainly composed of IgM and IgG 1 antibodies. Similar Ig-isotypes were preferentially expressed in vivo, after experimental infection of sheep with Salmonella (Lascelles et al., 1988) . In comparison with the IgG1 antibody secretion, the weak and late IgG2 response could be related to the differences in the respective biological activities of ovine IgG 1 and IgG2 (Levieux, 1990 ) .\n\nDuring the second week of cell cultures, the highest IgM antibody titres were observed in the presence of a high antigen concentration (ten to 100 bacteria per cell), while the greatest IgG titres appeared with a low concentration (one to ten bacteria per cell). This would suggest that either Ig-isotype expression could require different culture conditions or that some Ig-isotypes (in this case, IgG) could be preferentially adsorbed on antigen. These hypotheses could be confirmed using ELISASPOT tests performed according to the Ig-isotypes.\n\nIf most of the anti-S, abortusovis IgM antibodies seemed to be LPS-specific, results concerning the IgG1 response showed that some anti-S, abortusovis IgG 1 were specific for other bacterial antigens. These data are in agreement with those previously described from mice and humans (Brown and Hormaeche, 1989) . This methodology has also been applied to study in vitro-induced primary immune responses from lamb lymph node cell cultures. Experiments were carried out using high antigen concentration ( 100 bacteria per cell) because those culture conditions led to slightly better cell culture recoveries and particularly allowed secretion of higher amounts of IgM antibody.\n\nKinetic profiles characterizing the antibody production from unprimed lymph node cells were similar to those defined from in vivo sensitized leucocytes. The main difference between the two kinds of humoral immune responses stood at the level of the Ig-isotype expression. From unprimed lymph node leucocytes, most secreted antibodies were IgM, while from boosted cells, synthesized antibodies involved both IgM and IgG 1. The anti-Salmonella IgM appeared to be mainly composed of anti-LPS antibodies. The achievement of such primary antibody responses in vitro could be dependent upon the immunogenic properties of the Gram-negative bacteria used as antigen, but could also be related to the origin of cells put into culture. Thymus-dependent areas of lymph node contain interdigitating-dendritic cells considered to be the real effective APC, the only cells able to stimulate resting T-lymphocytes and to induce a primary immune response, in comparison with other kinds of APC such as macrophages or B-cells (Bujdoso et al., 1990) .\n\nThis report describes for the first time the induction of an in vitro antibody synthesis specific for Salmonella, from either in vivo sensitized or unprimed lymph node cells. The assay, involving an in vitro antigenic stimulation of sheep leucocytes and an antibody detection using both ELISASPOT and ELISA tests, allows detailed studies on the ovine humoral immune response. Furthermore, characteristics of the immune reaction developed from in vivo primed leucocytes were identical to those observed in vivo. This suggests that these reported culture conditions might allow partial reproduction in vitro of some of the physiological mechanisms occurring in vivo. Such in vitro assays will give rise to more detailed studies on the interactions between Salmonella and lymph node APC and on the resulting immune responses, in relation to the expression of the host genetic resistance to the disease. This would lead to a better understanding of mechanisms controlling the bacterial dissemination through the lymphoid tissue."}
