{"title": "Nuclease escape elements protect messenger RNA against cleavage by multiple viral endonucleases 2 3", "body": "including the SOX homologs [1, 9, 21, 40, 41] . Thus, the IL-6 derived SRE is unlikely to 144 function through steric occlusion of a common cleavage site. We instead considered the 145 possibility that the SRE functions like an RNA 'zip code', directing its associated transcript 146 to a location in the cell inaccessible to endonucleases. To test this hypothesis, we used RNA 147 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to monitor how the presence of the IL-6 SRE 148 impacted the localization of its associated mRNA. Six phage MS2-derived stem-loops were 149 introduced upstream of the SRE or \u0394SRE segment of the IL-6 3' UTR in the pcDNA3 150 luciferase reporter, enabling visualization of the RNA in transfected 293T cells using a Cy3-151 labeled RNA probe directed against the MS2 sequences [42] . We verified that the presence 152 of the stem-loops did not prevent the escape of the SRE-containing reporter or degradation 153 of the \u0394SRE reporter in SOX-expressing cells (Fig. S1) . There was no distinguishable 154 difference in the localization of the SRE and \u0394SRE containing mRNAs, both of which were 155 present relatively diffusely throughout the cell (Fig. 1C) . The FISH signal was specific to 156 transfected cells, as we observed no fluorescence in neighboring untransfected cells nor 157 autofluorescence from transfected cells lacking the Cy3 probes (Fig. 1C) . Although these 158 data to not exclude the possibility that the SRE-containing transcript became sequestered 159 into micro-aggregates or other structures not visible at this level of resolution, they do not 160 support relocalization as the driver of escape from viral endonuclease cleavage. 161 162 We next considered whether the inability to cleave an IL-6 SRE-containing 163 transcript was specific to viral endonucleases or similarly extended to host endonucleases. 164\n\nAlthough basal cellular mRNA decay is carried out by exonucleases, host quality control 165 pathways involve endonucleases to promote rapid clearance of aberrant mRNA [43] [44] [45] . 166 All rights reserved.

The NMD pathway detects PTCs during translation and directs cleavage of the 170 mRNA by the Smg6 endonuclease [46] . Depletion of Smg6 from 293T cells using siRNAs 171 restored dsRed2-PTC mRNA levels to those of the control dsRed2 transcript, confirming 172 that this was an NMD substrate degraded by Smg6 ( Fig. 2A-B) . We then fused the IL-6 173 derived SRE to the 3' UTR of dsRed2-PTC (dsRed2-PTC-SRE) or, as a control, the size 174 matched region from the IL-6 3' UTR lacking the SRE (dsRed2-PTC-\u0394SRE) and measured 175 the levels of each mRNA by RT-qPCR in 293T cells (Fig. 2C) . In contrast to the viral 176 endonucleases, the SRE did not impair Smg6-mediated cleavage of its target mRNA, as all 177 three PTC-containing transcripts were similarly degraded ( Fig. 2A & 2C) . 178\n\nThe second strategy to monitor host endonuclease activity was to express the nsp1 179 protein from SARS coronavirus. Nsp1 is not itself a nuclease, but it binds the 40S ribosome 180 and causes it to stall on the mRNA, thus activating cleavage of the mRNA by an as yet 181 unknown cellular endonuclease via a mechanism reminiscent of no-go decay [47, 48] . 182\n\nAlthough the endonuclease involved in this pathway has not been established, it is known 183 not to be Smg6 and thus this enabled evaluation of a distinct host endonuclease [48] . Nsp1 184 was co-transfected with the GFP-SRE or GFP-\u0394SRE reporter into 293T cells, and depletion 185 of the GFP transcript was measured by RT-qPCR. Similar to the NMD substrate, the SRE did 186 not prevent degradation of the GFP mRNA in nsp1-expressing cells (Fig. 2D) . Collectively, 187 these results suggest that the IL-6 derived SRE confers broad protection against viral but 188 not cellular endonucleases.

We also confirmed that, unlike the GAPDH mRNA, the endogenous 209 GADD45B mRNA was not depleted upon transfection of KSHV SOX or HSV-1 vhs into 293T 210 cells (Fig. 3C) . Finally, we noted that siRNA-based depletion of GADD45B from iSLK.219 211 cells resulted in decreased efficiency of lytic KSHV reactivation as well as reduced 212 All rights reserved.

Thus, the failure of SOX (or perhaps vhs) to degrade the GADD45B mRNA 216 could either be due to the absence of such a targeting motif (e.g. passive escape), or to the 217 presence of a specific protective element like the IL-6 SRE (e.g. dominant escape). To 218 distinguish these possibilities, we constructed chimeras between GFP, which has a well-219 characterized SOX cleavage element, and the GADD45B 5' UTR, 3' UTR, or coding region 220 (CDS), each of which were cloned downstream of the GFP coding region (Fig. 3D) . Co-221 transfection of the GFP-fused GADD45B 3' UTR construct with SOX into 293T cells did not 222 lead to degradation of this mRNA, whereas the GFP-GADD45B 5' UTR or CDS fusions were 223 readily degraded in SOX-expressing cells (Fig. 3E) . Thus, similar to the IL-6 3' UTR, the 224 To refine which GADD45B sequence encompassed the SRE, we initially looked for 230 similarities between the GADD45B 3' UTR and the IL-6 SRE using Clustal W alignment. 231\n\nWhile there were no stretches of significant sequence identity between the two RNAs, the 232 last ~200nt of the GADD45B 3'UTR had the highest similarity (~46%) to the IL-6 SRE (Fig.  233   S3) . We therefore fused this putative SRE segment of the GADD45B 3' UTR to GFP 234 (GADD45B-SRE), and found that it was sufficient to confer nearly the same level of 235 All rights reserved.

Thus, 236 similar to IL-6, the GADD45B 3' UTR contains a ~200 nt SRE (henceforth termed G-SRE). 237\n\nWe next sought to determine whether these two SREs could adopt a common 238 secondary structure. RNAfold-based predictions showed that the 3'-most segment of both 239\n\nSREs form a long stem-loop protruding structure with at least one bulge near the middle of 240 the stem, whereas the other regions of the SREs did not fold into any similar high-241 confidence structures (Fig. 4B) . To validate this predicted SRE stem loop structure 242 experimentally, we applied in-line probing, an RNA cleavage assay in which base-paired or 243 structurally constrained nucleotides are protected from spontaneous phosphodiester bond 244 hydrolysis [57] . Results from the cleavage reaction ( Fig. S4 ) largely confirmed the RNAfold 245 predictions, apart from a small variation in the IL-6 hairpin. We then tested whether this 246 structure is required for either IL-6 SRE or G-SRE function by changing two conserved TT 247 nucleotides located directly adjacent to the bulge in each hairpin structure to GG (SRE_GG; 248 mutated residues marked with asterisks Fig. 4B ). We also separately mutated the AA 249 residues predicted to base pair with these nucleotides on the other side of the loop to CC 250 (SRE_CC). Both the SRE_GG and the SRE_CC mutations in the IL-6 or GADD45B GFP fusions 251 resulted in partial degradation of these mRNAs upon SOX expression in 293T cells, 252\n\nsuggesting that disruption of that portion of the SRE hairpin impaired the protective 253 capacity of each SRE (Fig. 4C & 4D) . Notably, combining these mutations together 254\n\n(SRE_GG+CC), which should restore the secondary structure of the stem-loop, rescued the 255 fully protective phenotype in SOX expressing cells (Fig. 4C & 4D) . This suggests that, at 256 least for this region of each SRE, RNA structure rather than the specific sequence is 257 important for protection against SOX cleavage. 258 All rights reserved.

Given the partial similarities 263 in length, sequence, and structure between the IL-6 SRE and the G-SRE, we hypothesized 264 that they might also assemble a similar set of RNPs to mediate their protective function.

Again, we recovered NCL 279\n\nand HuR (also known as ELAVL1), two proteins that were previously identified as 280 important for IL-6 escape from SOX degradation [26, 27] .

The fact that IGF2BP1 and NPM1 were recovered 285 in the GADD45B and IL-6 ChIRP-MS experiments but not in the ChIRP-western blots likely 286 reflects differences in sensitivity between MS and western blotting. 287\n\nTo further validate the interactions with NCL, HuR, and hnRNPU, we 288 immunoprecipited (IP) each endogenous protein from 293T cells and performed RT-qPCR 289 to measure the level of co-precipitating endogenous GADD45B RNA. We observed a >5-290 fold enrichment of GADD45B mRNA over the mock (IgG) IP for both NCL and HuR, although 291 we were not able to detect an association with hnRNPU in this assay (data not shown) (Fig.  292   5D ). We confirmed that the interaction occurs on the GADD45B 3'UTR by performing the 293 IPs from cells transfected with a GFP reporter fused to either the GADD45B 5' UTR or 3' 294 UTR (Fig. 5E) . The structurally compromised mutant GADD45B 3'UTR_GG described in Fig.  295 4B failed to interact with NCL and HuR, confirming that the stem-loop structure in the SRE 296 is important for protein binding (Fig. 5E) . Collectively, these data suggest that while there 297 is some overlap between the sequence, structure, and RNA binding proteins associated 298 with the GADD45B and IL-6 SREs, these elements likely assemble distinct RNP complexes 299 and thus may function in a related but non-identical manner. 300 301 302\n\nThe GADD45B and IL-6 SREs share a requirement for HuR but differ in the breadth of 303 their protective capacity 304 All rights reserved.

Given that both proteins are also 306 bound by the G-SRE, we evaluated whether they were similarly important for G-SRE-307 mediated escape. We individually depleted each protein from 293T cells using siRNAs 308 targeting HuR or NCL (or control non-targeting siRNAs), then measured the ability of SOX 309 to degrade the GFP-GADD45B-3'UTR reporter by RT-qPCR ( Fig. 6A & 6B) . Similar to the IL-310 6 SRE, depletion of HuR eliminated the protective capacity of the G-SRE, leading to 311 degradation of the GFP-GADD45B-3'UTR mRNA in SOX-expressing cells (Fig. 6A) . 312\n\nSurprisingly however, depletion of NCL did not impair the protective effect of the G-SRE in 313 SOX-expressing cells (Fig. 6B) . 314\n\nFinally, we used the GFP-GADD45B-3'UTR reporter to evaluate whether the G-SRE 315 conferred protection from cleavage by the panel of viral endonucleases described in Fig. 1 . 316\n\nUsing the same experimental set up as was used for the IL-6 derived SRE reporter, we 317 observed that while the GADD45B 3' UTR protected against SOX and vhs, it was unable to 318 protect against degradation by muSOX, BGLF5, and PA-X (Fig. 6C) . Furthermore, it did not 319 protect against cleavage by the nsp1-activated host endonuclease (Fig. 6C) . Thus, although 320 the IL-6 and GADD45B derived nuclease escape elements exhibit a number of similarities, 321 they are distinct in both their RNP complex requirements and in the breadth of nucleases 322 they restrict. 323\n\nViruses extensively interface with the host gene expression machinery to promote 326 their own RNA and protein synthesis and to control the cellular response to infection.

Here, we reveal that a ~200 nt sequence present in the 3' UTR of the cellular IL-329 6 mRNA functions as a broad-acting, virus-specific endonuclease escape element, and 330 identify a similar element in the GADD45B 3' UTR. Although these two SREs are not 331 identical in their protective capacity, they display some sequence and putative structural 332 similarities and are both functionally dependent on HuR binding. We hypothesize that 333 these may therefore be representative members of a new type of RNA regulatory element 334 engaged during viral endonuclease-triggered mRNA decay. Determining whether other 335 such elements exist in mammalian or viral mRNAs is an important future goal, as is 336\n\ndeciphering conditions under which such elements impact RNA fate in uninfected cells. 337\n\nThe IL-6 and GADD45B SREs display relatively limited sequence similarity but have 338 at least one structurally important stem-loop in common. Thus, RNA structure appears to 339 be a central component of an SRE and is likely to influence recruitment or arrangement of 340 proteins involved in escape. This is in line with the fact that RNP assembly can be more 341 heavily impacted by structural fidelity than primary sequence recognition [59]. We 342 hypothesize that there is a core set of proteins required for SRE function, such as HuR, but 343 that individual SREs recruit distinct accessory factors that dictate the conditions or 344 mechanism by which that SRE protects against nuclease targeting. In this regard, we have 345 not found significant overlap between known HuR mRNA targets and mRNAs that are not 346 downregulated by SOX [22] . This is in agreement with the fact that many of the SRE bound 347 proteins have a breadth of roles in controlling RNA fate beyond conferring nuclease escape 348\n\n[60-64]. SRE activity may be further impacted by the cellular context and neighboring 349 regulatory features, particularly in the case of tightly controlled transcripts.

Indeed, it has taken more than a decade from the first 355 report of IL-6 escaping SOX-induced host shutoff to identify a second SRE-containing mRNA 356 hypothesis that there are numerous SREs throughout the transcriptome is correct, it is 392 likely that individual viruses require only a subset of these host genes for replication. Other 393 mRNAs may collaterally escape simply because they contain SREs that functionally mimic 394 those present in the 'required' mRNAs.
