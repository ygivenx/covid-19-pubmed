{"title": "Schmallenberg virus induces apoptosis in Vero cell line via extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in a time and dose dependent manner", "body": "doi: 10 .1292/jvms. Apoptosis could occur in both physiological conditions such embryonic development, immune cell selection and in pathological status like mutations, DNA damage and certain infections [9] . Some viruses can induce or inhibit apoptosis in cells by their proteins. Inhibition of apoptosis could be needed for persistent infection and viral replication whereas induction of apoptosis could be because of lytic infection and viral spread without any inflammation. African swine fever virus, fowl poxvirus, bovine herpesvirus-5 are some viruses that inhibit apoptosis following infection of cells [5, 14, 19] . Certain apoptosis inducing viruses including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, bluetongue virus, Akabane virus, Aino and Chuzan viruses [16, 18, 24] . Although apoptotic induction of CPT-Tert and HEK-293T cell lines by SBV was detected with caspase-3/-7 activation [7] there was no information about apoptotic effect of SBV on Vero cell line. Vero cell line is widely used for SBV isolation, plaque titration and plaque reduction neutralization tests and antigen preparation [17, 31] . There is one study about apoptosis and SBV in pubmed according to our knowledge [7] . Because of inadequacy of detailed information on SBV-induced apoptosis, in present study, apoptosis in Vero cell line was investigated with DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, Annexin-V/PI staining and expression analyses of pro-and anti-apoptotic genes, further time and dose dependent analyses were performed.\n\nVero cell line is maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/ streptomycin at 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO 2 . Schmallenberg virus is kindly provided by Dr. Wim H. M. van der Poel (Wageningen University in the Netherlands). Vero cells were infected with 0.1 and 0.01 MOI of SBV and excess virus not adsorbed was removed after 1 hr of incubation. Cell viability examined with trypan blue (15250061, Thermo Fisher) exclusion method.\n\nSBV titration is performed on Vero cells as described previously [17] with some modifications. Briefly, Vero cell line was inoculated in 12-well cell culture plate and after 18 hr cells were infected with SBV dilutions. After 3 hr of incubation of virusinfected cells in 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO 2 virus dilutions, inocula were removed and 1:1 mixture of 2\u00d7 DMEM and 2% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were dispersed to all wells. After incubation for 6 days cells were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin solution and stained with crystal violet. Plaques were counted and stock virus titration was calculated as PFU/ml.\n\nCells infected with 0.1 and 0.01 MOI of SBV were collected on 0, 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 hr Staurosporine (35385.02, Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) was used as positive control for apoptosis induction with final concentration of 1 \u00b5M/ml. Apoptotic DNA ladder kit (K170, Biovision, California, U.S.A.) was used for detection of DNA fragmentation as following the instructions of manufacturer's. Briefly, approximately 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells were collected and cell pellets were suspended with extraction buffer followed by centrifugation at 1,600 \u00d7 g. RNase and proteinase were added to supernatants of each samples and incubated at 50\u00b0C for 30 min. After incubation samples were incubated at \u221220\u00b0C for 10 min after ammonium acetate and isopropanol addition. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min for DNA precipitation after incubation. DNA pellet were washed with 70% ethanol and centrifugation was repeated at 16,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min. Ethanol was removed and tubes were incubated at room temperature for 15 min for evaporation of ethanol residues. DNA samples were suspended in suspension buffer and loaded on 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light.\n\nCells infected with 0.1 and 0.01 MOI of SBV were harvested on 0, 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 hr and were stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI with using Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Kit (K101, Biovision, CA, U.S.A.) for detection of apoptosis in flow cytometry. Briefly, cell pellets were suspended with 1\u00d7 binding buffer. Cell groups were determined as unstained, FITC, PI and FITC+PI stained. After cells were stained with related dye, samples were incubated in room temperature for 5 min. Flow cytometry analyses were maintained with BD FACSAria II (Franklin Lakes, NJ, U.S.A.) after calibration with beads. Data analysis of samples was carried out with BD FACSDIVA software.\n\nCaspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities of cells infected with 0.1 and 0.01 MOI of SBV were determined in Vero cells harvested on 0, 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 hr pi. Caspase-3 (K106, Biovision), caspase-8 (K113, Biovision) and caspase-9 (K119, Biovision) colorimetric assay kits were used for determination of caspase activations. After harvesting, cell pellets were suspended in 50 \u00b5l of cell lysis buffer followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 1 min and cytosolic extracts were transferred to fresh tubes. Protein concentration of samples was determined and 250 \u00b5g of protein from each sample were dilute in total volume of 50 \u00b5l of cell lysis buffer in a 96-well microplate. Into each well 50 \u00b5l of 2\u00d7 reaction buffer with 10 mM of dithiothreitol (DTT) was added. DEVD-pNA, IETD-pNA and LEHD-pNA substrates were added with final concentration of 200 \u00b5M to each sample for determination of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 activation, respectively. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 hr and read at 405 nm using a microplate reader.\n\nRNA samples were isolated from cells with using High Pure RNA isolation kit (11 828 665 001, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Briefly, cells pelleted and re-suspended in 200 \u00b5l PBS thereafter 400 \u00b5l of lysis/binding buffer added to each sample and vortexed. Samples were transferred to filter tubes and centrifuged at 8,000 \u00d7 g for 15 sec. Ninety \u00b5l DNase incubation buffer and 10 \u00b5l DNase I were mixed per sample and transferred to filter tubes followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. Five hundred \u00b5l of wash buffer I was added to tubes and centrifuged at 8,000 \u00d7 g for 15 sec. After centrifugation, 500 \u00b5l of wash buffer II was added to tubes and centrifuged again at 8,000 \u00d7 g for 15 sec. Two hundred \u00b5l of wash buffer II was added to tubes and centrifuged at 13,000 \u00d7 g for 2 min. Filter tubes were transferred into microcentrifuge tubes and 100 \u00b5l of elution buffer were added to upper reservoir of filter tubes. After centrifugation at 8,000 \u00d7 g for 1 min, eluted RNA samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until used for reverse transcription. Reverse transcription of cDNAs were performed with Transcriptor First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (04 897 030 001, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) using anchored-oligo (dT) 18 and random hexamer primers. Briefly, total RNA, anchored-oligo (dT) 18 and random hexamer primers were mixed in total volume of 13 \u00b5l and heated to 65\u00b0C for 10 min in thermal cycler. Thereafter tubes were immediately cooled on ice. Mix of 4 \u00b5l transcriptor reverse transcriptase reaction buffer, 0.5 \u00b5l protector RNase inhibitor, 2 \u00b5l dNTP mix, 0.5 \u00b5l transcriptor reverse transcriptase were prepared for each samples and dispersed to tubes in final volume of 20 \u00b5l. Reverse transcription reaction was performed in following condition, 25\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 55\u00b0C 30 min.\n\nVero cells infected with SBV were confirmed by PCR using two different primers sets for amplification of S segment of SBV after reverse transcription (Table S1 ). Real-time PCR was used to analyze expression levels of anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and pro-apoptotic genes Bak, Bax and Puma. GAPDH and Beta actin were selected as reference genes. Primer sets for these apoptosis-related genes were designed (Table S2 ) and real-time PCR optimization were performed for all sets. cDNAs were subjected to real-time PCR with SYBR Green I master mix (04707516001, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in total volume of 20 \u00b5l for each reactions and 95\u00b0C 10 sec, 60\u00b0C 10 sec, 72\u00b0C 10 sec profile was used. Each sample was studied in duplicate. Analyses were performed with LightCycler 96 instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Normalized gene expression levels of apoptosis-related genes were calculated with 2 -(Cq gene of interest \u2212Cq reference gene) infected sample -Cq gene of interest \u2212Cq reference gene) noninfected sample formulation [22, 26] with distinct normalization both with GAPDH and Beta actin.\n\nOne-way ANOVA and independent t-test were used for statistical analyses in IBM SPSS Statistics 21 software (Chicago, IL, U.S.A.). Results were considered as statistically significant at P<0.01. Graphics were created with GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA, U.S.A.).\n\nVero cells were infected with SBV on Vero cells and were confirmed with RT-PCR and plaque titration that was also carried out to determine titer of virus stocks (Figs. S1, S2, Table S1 ). Vero cells infected with 0.1 and 0.01 MOI of SBV were visualized under inverted microscope (DM IL LED, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and cells were controlled daily for cytopathic effect (cpe). Cells infected with 0.1 MOI of SBV showed cpe first in 18 hr post-infection (pi). In infection of 0.01 MOI of SBV first cpe were seen in 24 hr pi and cpe of cells were much less in comparison to those cells infected with 0.1 MOI of SBV. \n\nTo address if SBV infected cells culminate in phosphatidylserine translocation, cells stained with Annexin V-FITC/PI were analyzed in flow cytometry. The highest ratio of phosphatidylserine exposure of Vero cells was detected in 48 hr pi in 0.1 MOI of SBV infection with total rate of 37.84% ( Fig. 2A) , whereas in 0.01 MOI infected 48 hr pi cells showed 22.7% apoptotic cells in total (Fig. 2B) .\n\nTo determine whether the infected cells show significantly more caspase activation than the mock infected in the different time and dose, effects of SBV infection on caspase-3, -8 and-9 activation in Vero cells were measured by using colorimetric kits. According to caspase activity assays, caspase-3, -8 and -9 activations in SBV infected Vero cell were detected. All caspase activation data sets were shown as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) versus the mock infected group for both 0.1 and doi: 10.1292/jvms.18-0582 0.01 MOIs (Fig. 3 ).\n\nSignificant differences are determined for the infection time points versus the mock infected cells and between dose groups. According to results, caspase-3 activation was significantly different at 36 hr pi and 48 hr pi in both of 0.1 MOI and 0.01 MOI infected cells compared to the mock infected group (P<0.01) (Fig. 3A) . For caspase-3, there is statistically significance between 0.1 MOI and 0.01 MOI groups of cells at 2, 6 and 12 hr pi (P<0.01) (Fig. 3A) . Results indicate that SBV induce apoptosis in Vero cells with activation of caspase-3 in both viral doses.\n\nIn activation of caspase-8 there are significant differences determined between mock infected group and 2, 6, 36 and 48 hr pi cells in 0.1 MOI (P<0.01). Caspase-8 was activated significantly at 0.01 MOI of 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 hr pi cells versus the mock infection cells (P<0.01). Caspase-8 is slightly activated in SBV infected cells but there is statistically significance between all doses except for those of 36 hr pi (P<0.01). Unexpectedly, proportions of activated caspase-8 at 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hr pi of 0.01 MOI are higher than 0.1 MOI groups (Fig. 3B) . Caspase-8 activation in SBV infected cells indicates that extrinsic pathway is triggered by SBV.\n\nActivation of caspase-9 indicated moderate but significant increases at 0.01 MOI and interestingly, stayed almost unchanged during the time. At 0.01 MOI in 2, 12, 18, 24, 48 hr pi cells there was statistical significance compared to mock infection (P<0.01) (Fig. 3C) . Statistically significance is determined at 0.1 MOI for 2, 6, 18, 36 and 48 hr pi groups in comparison to mock infected group (P<0.01). Infected cells with 0.1 MOI of SBV has higher proportion of activated caspase-9, supporting SBV induce intrinsic cascade (Fig. 3C ).\n\nAfter the induction of apoptosis in SBV infected Vero cells was confirmed by DNA fragmentation, flow cytometry analyses and caspase activation assays, expression analyses of pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak, Puma) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL) genes of Vero cell were performed. GAPDH and Beta actin reference genes were used to normalize gene expression levels of apoptosis related genes (Table S3) . Expressions of Bak, Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Puma genes of Vero cells were analyzed following SBV infection. It was seen that increasing levels of gene expression has higher ratio in those of which are normalized to GAPDH reference gene than those were normalized to Beta actin reference gene (Figs. 4 and 5) .\n\nIn normalization to GAPDH reference gene, Bak, Bax, and Puma gene expressions were upregulated, whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL genes were downregulated gradually by time (Fig. 4) In normalization to Beta actin reference gene, only Puma gene expression was upregulated (Fig. 5 ). There is statistically significance (P<0.01) determined for both 0. \n\nTo date, some members of Peribunyaviridae family were found to induce apoptosis in several cell lines. Akabane, Aino, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Oropouche viruses of Peribunyaviridae family reported as triggering apoptosis in different cell lines such HeLa, Huh7 and Vero [16, 24] . SBV, another member of Peribunyaviridae, was shown to induce apoptosis in CPT-Tert and HEK-293T cell lines [7] but there was no data about induction or inhibition of apoptosis by SBV in different cell lines except these. This lack of information on Vero cell line, one of the most preferred and susceptible cell line for SBV was eliminated by data of this study.\n\nInduction of apoptosis could be detected by many features of cells in vitro. DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, cleavage of apoptosis related proteins such as caspases, PARP etc., translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm, increasing of expression of pro-apoptotic genes, phosphatidylserine exposure on outer leaflet of cells are the most reliable and commonly used characteristics of apoptotic cells and could be detected in vitro by using different methods. In present study, DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine exposure, caspase activation and apoptosis related gene expression levels were analyzed with agarose gel electrophoresis, Annexin V/PI staining in flow cytometry, colorimetric caspase activation assays and real-time PCR methods, respectively.\n\nDNA fragmentation is one of the basic characteristics of apoptosis/necrosis and can be detected in agarose gel electrophoresis. Results of this study on DNA fragmentation of SBV infected Vero cells was detected as being dependent on infection time and dose of virus. First DNA fragmentation of SBV infected cells were seen on 18 hr pi at 0.1 MOI and on 24 hr pi at 0.01 MOI of SBV (Fig. 1) . Virus dose and infection time can affect the first DNA fragmentation appearance on virus-infected cells. A detectable DNA laddering at the 2 MOI of H9N2 virus infected A549 cells was detected at 16 hr pi [28] whereas all 0.1, 1 and 10 MOI of chikungunya virus infected cells showed DNA fragmentation at 48 hr pi [1] . Cells under physiological conditions have phosphatidylserine on inner leaflet of plasma membrane. During apoptosis induction in cells phosphatidylserine become exposed on outer leaflet of plasma membrane and display \"eat me\" signal to phagocytes [27] . Annexin V, an anticoagulant protein which binds to phosphatidylserine, is used for detection of apoptosis incidence in cells. Propidium iodide (PI) which is used widely with combination of Annexin V is a plasma membrane permeability marker. When used combined together cells could be seperated into 4 groups: live (Annexin V\u2212/PI\u2212), early apoptotic (Annexin V+/PI\u2212), late apoptotic (Annexin V+/PI+) and necrotic (Annexin V\u2212/PI+) cells [33] . Flow cytometry results showed that highest apoptotic cell rate were in 48 hr pi samples in infection of 0.1 MOI (Fig. 2A) . Early apoptosis rates were 24.04% and 17.1% while late apoptosis rates were 13.8% and 5.6% in 0.1 and 0.01 MOI of SBV infected cells, respectively (Fig. 2) . This is the first results of apoptosis detection of SBV infected Vero cells by using Annexin V/PI staining in flow cytometry. Apoptotic cell percentage could be affected by virus species/strain, virus dose, cell line and time of infection. Early and late apoptotic cells were detected as 61-75 and 13-19%, respectively, in HeLa cells transfected with canine parvovirus-2 NS1 encoding vector [25] . It is surprising that phosphatidylserine externalization starts in the early time in the flow cytometry results but it is not seen caspase-3 activation until 36 hr pi.\n\nCaspases, cystein proteases that modulates apoptosis, cleave their specific substrates and activate downstream molecules and apoptotic cell death occurs via mainly two pathways: extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. In present study, caspase-3 which is one of the effector caspases, caspase-8 and caspase-9 which have roles on initiation of extrinsic and intrinsic pathways respectively had been studied on Vero cells infected with SBV. To date whether SBV leads to caspase activation of infected cells had investigated in only CPT-Tert and HEK-293T cells with result of slight activation of caspase-3/7 [7] . Paucity of information in Vero cell line for caspase activation has eliminated in present study with caspase-3 activation and further investigation of pathway related caspases. Caspase-3 was activated following SBV infection in both MOIs, but statistically significance is determined for 36 and 48 hr pi cells compared to mock infected group (P<0.01), confirming that SBV induces apoptosis in Vero cells (Fig. 3) .\n\nTo determine whether SBV modulates extrinsic and intrinsic signaling cascade, caspase-8 and caspase-9 activation was analyzed, respectively. Caspase-8 was slightly but significantly (P<0.01) activated in SBV infected cells. However, unexpectedly, at 2, 6, 12 and 18 hr pi of 0.01 MOI proportions of activated caspase-8 are higher than 0.1 MOI groups (Fig. 3) . Caspase-8 activation in cells at 0.1 MOI initiated from 18 hr pi and reached maximum level at 48 hr pi. Activated caspase-8 levels were slightly high at first hours of infection and interestingly peaked at 18 hr pi at 0.01 MOI (Fig. 3) . Caspase-9 activation of SBV infected cells was investigated to find out if intrinsic pathway is triggered. Likely caspase-8, activation of caspase-9 at 0.1 MOI has reached to highest level at 48 hr pi. Cell group infected with 0.1 MOI of SBV has higher proportion of activated caspase-9, while activation of caspase-9 indicated moderate but significant increases at 0.01 MOI and interestingly, stayed almost unchanged during the time (Fig. 3) . These data indicate that SBV induce intrinsic cascade. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHV) which is another member of family Peribunyaviridae induces apoptosis via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways [6] . Many research reported that pro-apoptotic genes like Bak, Bax and Puma are upregulated when apoptosis induced in cells. Bak gene was upregulated in Hepatitis C virus infected tissues and HepG2 cell lines associated with apoptosis induction [34] . Chicken fibroblast cells infected with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) showed increased Bak gene levels as 1.39 and 2.09 fold after 8 and 16 hr pi, respectively. Bak levels were 6.41 fold increased in IBV infected chicken embryos after 48 hr pi [35] . In this study, at 48 hr pi Bak gene levels normalized to GAPDH were found increased approximately as 0.93 fold in 0.1 MOI and 1.40 fold in 0.01 MOI (Fig. 4) , whereas levels normalized to Beta actin were found approximately 0.25 fold in 0.1 MOI and 0.14 fold in 0.01 MOI (Fig. 5) . In normalization to GAPDH reference gene, Bak gene expression was upregulated, whereas the gene was downregulated according to Beta actin normalization. These data indicates that SBV infection has minor effect on Bak gene. Although certain viruses can affect or interact with Bak [32, 35] , there is no study that investigate whether SBV interact with Bak protein in cellular level. Bax gene expression level was found to be increased in canine distemper virus infected dog's cerebellum as approximately 9.8 fold [8] . According to GAPDH normalization in this study Bax gene were increased approximately 1.47 fold in 0.1 MOI and 3.02 fold in 0.01 MOI of SBV in 48 hr pi in Vero cells (Fig. 4) . Bax gene was upregulated as 0.39 fold in 0.1 MOI and 0.30 fold in 0.01 MOI in 48 hr pi of SBV infection when expression level was normalized to Beta actin (Fig. 5) .\n\nBcl-2 gene which is an anti-apoptotic gene blocks apoptosis induction in healthy cells. When apoptosis is triggered in cells Bcl-2 gene expression starts to decrease. Bcl-2/Bax rate in West Nile virus infected Neuro2a cells were detected as 3.50 in 0 hr and 0.40 in 6 hr pi [20] . In this study Bcl-2/Bax rate was 0.82 in 2 hr pi and 0.19 in 48 hr pi in 0.1 MOI of SBV, whereas 0.36 in 2 hr pi and decreasing to 0.16 in 48 hr pi in 0.01 MOI, according to both normalization with GAPDH and Beta actin, indicating that SBV induce apoptosis by affecting apoptosis related genes. Another anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-XL inhibits mitochondrial permeabilization in cells and prevents apoptosis. Bcl-XL/Bax rate in 0.1 MOI of SBV infected Vero cells was 0.86 in 2 hr pi and 0.88 in 48 hr pi. For 0.01 MOI, Bcl-XL/Bax rate was 0.48 in 2 hr pi and decreasing to 0.45 in 48 hr pi. Bcl-XL/Bax rate was same with both GAPDH and Beta actin normalizations and results indicated that SBV does not affect Bcl-XL/Bax rate significantly.\n\nPuma is pro-apoptotic gene which has critical role on apoptosis induced by wide range of stimuli such as toxins, endoplasmic reticulum stress, ischemia and infections. CCHV causes upregulation of Puma gene in Huh7 cell line at both 1 and 0.1 MOI [24] . Puma is found to be induced in HIV envelope transfected HeLa cells [21] . In present study Puma is upregulated in Vero cells at the highest level in comparison to other pro-apoptotic genes investigated (Figs. 4, and 5). In GAPDH normalization statistically significance (P<0.01) is determined for 0.1 MOI and 0.01 MOI infected cells in comparison to mock infected group at 48 hr pi and 36 hr pi, respectively, for Puma (Fig. 4) . The results of Beta actin normalization indicated that the cells at 18 and 48 hr pi of 0.1 MOI and the cells at 2, 6, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hr pi of 0.01 MOI have shown statistically significance (P<0.01) when compared to mock infected group, causing upregulation of Puma gene in Vero cells (Fig. 5) . These results are thought to be related with apoptosis of Vero cells by SBV could be induced dominantly via Puma gene, as given that Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), another member of Peribunyaviridae, is shown to use p53 pathways and cause upregulation of Puma [3] . Activation and/or utilization of p53 pathways upon SBV infection still remain unclear. This is the first detailed study of apoptosis induction in Vero cells caused by SBV infection. Results of this study showed that SBV induce apoptosis via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways and moreover intrinsic pathway induction could be modulated over Puma gene. To understand the whole molecular mechanisms used by SBV in both Vero and other cell lines, more detailed studies should be performed in future.\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
