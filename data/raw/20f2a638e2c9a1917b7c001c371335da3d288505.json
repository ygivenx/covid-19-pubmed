Recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses, 31 however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these 32 methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared 33 to type strains. Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that 34 will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. To 35 assist in this, we also provide the R package 'MyCoV' which classifies user generated sequences. 36 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Thanks to molecular epidemiology 46 studies, we know that SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 had their origins in wild animal reservoir 47 species before spilling over into humans. Indeed, numerous molecular studies have identified a 48 wealth of Coronavirus diversity harboured by equally diverse animal hosts (1-6), and phylogenetic 49 analysis of sequence data from these studies is helping in our understanding of many aspects of 50 disease ecology and evolution (7-9). This includes the role of reservoir hosts in disease maintenance 51 and transmission (3, 4, 6, 10-12), the evolutionary origins of human-infecting coronaviruses (3, 13), 52 the importance of bats as reservoirs of novel coronaviruses (14, 15), the role of intermediate hosts in 53 human disease emergence (3, 11, 16) , and the understanding of risk that might be related to 54 coronavirus diversity and distributions (17, 18 Betacoronaviruses related to MERS Coronavirus). Whole genome data from holotype specimens 72 selected to represent an exhaustive spectrum of coronavirus diversity was used to test the 73 phylogenetic repartition and support for each of these taxa (20). Due to the limited diversity of 74 holotype specimens classified into these subgenera, there is currently no method for attributing 75 subgenus to isolates with divergent sequences, and no proposed method for partial sequence data. 76\n\nHowever, sequence data from the RdRp region of the polymerase gene is one of the most commonly 77 used tools for the purposes of Coronavirus detection, identification and classification in molecular 78 epidemiology. 79\n\nHere, we examine the phylogenetic relationship from all identifiable public partial RdRp sequences 80 6 sequences. We compiled a database of our assigned classifications and developed the R package 87 \"MyCoV\" for assignment of user-generated sequences to these taxa. 88\n\n89 Sequence data, curation and alignment: 90 Sequence data was obtained from the NCBI nucleotide database on the 5 th of July 2019, using the 91 search term \"coronavir*\". This resulted in the identification of 30,249 sequences. A preliminary set 92 of representative partial RdRp sequences was compiled with reference to recent publications 93 describing Coronavirus diversity across the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily (21), in order to include 94 starting reference sequences from with the largest possible diversity of coronaviruses. This 95 preliminary list was then used to identify partial RdRp sequences from retrieved NCBI records by 96 annotating regions that had at least 70 % identity to any reference sequence in the Geneious 97 software package (version 9.4.1). Annotated regions and 200 bp of flanking sequence data were 98 then extracted. Data containing incomplete sequences in the form of strings of N's or significant 99 numbers of ambiguities (>5) were removed. Open reading frames with a minimum length of 300 bp 100 were identified and extracted from the remaining sequences. In the case where the correct reading 101 frame was ambiguous, pairwise alignment to reference sequence data was used to determine 102 reading frame. Remaining sequences were then aligned in-frame using MAFFT, and the resulting 103 alignment was further curated by visual inspection. Retained sequences were then trimmed to 104 include only the most-frequently sequenced partial region of RdRp and so that each sequence 105 contained a minimum of 300 gap free bases. The final alignment was 387 bp in length with 7,544 106 individual sequences, of which 3,155 were unique. The relevant 387 bp region corresponds to 107 nucleotide positions 15287:15673 in Merbecovirus holotype reference sequence JX869059.2. 108 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Genus-level subtrees were then extracted 124 and treated independently for subgenus-level analyses. 125\n\nSequences originating from defining subgenus holotype samples were identified in the genus-level 126 topologies. Clustering thresholds were defined as the highest node positions at which clusters of 127 leaves could be defined without combining holotype specimens from different subgenera into the 128 same clade. Clusters defined at these thresholds that contained no holotype specimens were 129 designated as \"Unclassified\". Clustering thresholds were calculated, and subgenera were assigned to 130 all sequences across a random subsample of 453 trees, 151 from each independent repeat of the 131 phylogenetic analyses.

Sequences that could not be re-assigned to the same subgenus by this 141 method were re-classified as \"atypical\" members of their respective subgenera. 142 R package for assignment of user-generated sequences:\n\nThe purpose of the R package MyCoV is to allow users to classify Coronavirus sequence data that 144 includes the relevant portion of the RdRp gene to the taxonomic level of subgenus, and to assess to 145 what extent the classification is optimal based on the criteria presented herein. 146\n\nIn order to achieve this, the 3155 unique partial sequences from the phylogenetic analyses were 147 used to establish a reference BLAST database. Metadata pertaining to host organism, country of 148 origin and date of collection were mined from NCBI and standardised by taxonomic grouping of the 149 host and geographical region of origin to generate corresponding metadata for all 7544 NCBI 150 reference sequences from which the unique sequence list was established. 151\n\nMyCoV was written as a basic wrapper script for blastn, which queries sequences of interest against 152 the established database, and summarises subgenus classification, subgenus posterior support of 153 the most similar sequence in the phylogenetic analysis, pairwise distances to the most similar 154 sequence in the database and their metadata using R packages \"ggplot2\", \"formattable\" (available at 155 https://github.com/renkun-ken/formattable) and \"ggtree\" (26). 156 author/funder.

The resulting predictions of tree topology had well supported major nodes 163 with narrow posterior distributions around most node heights ( Figure 1a ). The four known genera 164 associated with these sequences fell into four well-supported clades, divided close to the root of the 165 tree. Genetic distance measures between all members of the four genera had logical thresholds for 166 the distinction between genera except in the case of some betacoronaviruses, which had major 167 clade divisions close to the root of the tree ( Figure 1b) and therefore had genetic distances between 168 members of the same genus that overlapped with distances between members of the Alpha-and 169\n\nBetacoronaviruses. In practice, this is likely to mean that identity-based phylogenetic topologies 170 based on this partial region of RdRp may incorrectly infer paraphyly between members of the Alpha-171 and Betacoronaviruses. 172\n\nAt the subgenus level, separation of the inferred tree topologies into monophyletic clades based on 173 the positions of reference holotype sequences produced logical and well-supported groupings that 174 covered the majority of coronavirus diversity explored to date by RdRp sequencing (Figures 2 and 3) . 175\n\nIn total, 88 % of unique sequences fell into clade groups containing subgenus holotypes with 176 subgenus-assignment posterior probabilities of greater than 90 %. The remaining 12 % of unique 177 sequences fell into 19 separate monophyletic groups, of which 14 were Alphacoronaviruses ( Figure  178 2), two were Betacoronaviruses ( Figure 2 ) and three were Deltacoronaviruses (Figure 3 ). When host 179 and geographical origins of isolates falling within unclassified clades was examined, the majority 180 were associated with regional radiations for which little or no genomic or phenotypic data are 181 author/funder.

For example, unclassified Deltacoronaviruses were all from bird species in Oceania, and 182 many unclassified Alpha-and Betacoronaviruses originated in bat species that are exclusively found 183 in Central and South America (Supplementary Figure 1) . 184\n\nThe Pedacoviruses, for which multiple genome holotypes were supplied for the description of 185 subgenus, were split into multiple clades by the imposition of a common height threshold for cluster 186 definition using the presented methodology. The two holotype-containing clades corresponded to a 187 single group of Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) -related viruses distributed globally but 188 entirely from pigs (Pedacovirus I in Figure 2) An alternative strategy for coronavirus classification from partial sequence data may be using the 247 spike protein-encoding S-gene, which is another commonly sequenced region of coronavirus 248 genomes. However, the use of this region is more common in epidemic outbreak scenarios and thus 249 there are many S gene sequences in public databases that are either identical or extremely closely 250 related. Performing comparative sequence searches by querying the NCBI nucleotide database with 251 the two search terms \"((coronavir* spike) OR (coronavir* S gene)) AND 252 \"viruses\"[porgn:__txid10239]\" and \"((coronavir* RdRp) OR (coronavir* polymerase)) AND 253 \"viruses\"[porgn:__txid10239]\" shows that there are approximately three times more sequences 254 from the S gene, but that these sequences originate from approximately three times fewer viral 255 author/funder.

We therefore favour the use of the RdRp region as it provides a more exhaustive 256 representation of known coronavirus diversity. 257\n\nOf course, this form of interpretation is subject to the same caveats as any other that is based on 258 partial sequence data from a short, single genomic locus; Indeed, the effects of potential 259 recombination events cannot be captured, and some uncertainties will exist in the presented 260 phylogenetic trajectories that may be resolvable by the addition of longer sequence data.
