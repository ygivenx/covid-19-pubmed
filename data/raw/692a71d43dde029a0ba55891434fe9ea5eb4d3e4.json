Since 2004, three emerging diseases have been added as mandatory report diseases: hand, foot, and mouth disease in 2008; influenza A H1N1 pdm09 in 2009; and human infection with the avian influenza A H7N9 virus in 2013. Excluding these three new diseases, the overall incidence of the remaining consistently reported diseases, estimated by a joinpoint regression model, 3 showed a two-stage feature of opposite changes. In the first stage, the overall rate of reported infectious diseases rose rapidly in 2004-06, with an annual percentage change of 8\u00b79%, which is probably attributable to the improved sensitivity of the surveillance system by the adoption of a new webbased reporting approach since the SARS outbreak. 1 In the second stage, the overall trend showed a slight reduction with an annual percentage change of -0\u00b77% in 2007-13. Whether or not the three newly added diseases are considered, the pattern of the overall trend of infectious disease occurrence showed significant differences between the two stages (figure). Unfortunately, this fact was overlooked in Yang and colleagues' report, 2 but should be noted by readers .\n\nFrom 2004 to 2013, similar to the striking rate of increase in annual gross domestic product in China (7\u00b77-11\u00b79%), 4 the epidemic trend of many infectious diseases showed notable increases or decreases, comprehensively driven by evolving socioeconomic, environmental, and causal factors.\n\nActive introduction of new vaccine-preventable diseases into the National Immunization Program in China, which included 15 diseases since 2007, led to a sharp reduction in the overall number of cases of vaccine-preventable diseases according to routine surveillance data and the nationwide seroprevalence survey. 5, 6 In response to WHO's activity in the worldwide fight against neglected tropical diseases, a large-scale, active, case-screening strategy was adopted in China for specific parasitic diseases (eg, schistosomiasis and hydatid), which led to a large increase in reported cases. However, the national survey of parasitic infection showed that \n\nMosquito and tick ecology has changed in parts of Europe over the past 20 years and threats to the UK from diseases such as dengue, West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever have to be considered. 1 But health professionals must also be aware of increasing risks from less well known vector-borne zoonoses that have emerged in Europe during the same timeframe. These zoonotic conditions include certain parasitic disorders of dogs that are well known to veterinarians, such as visceral leishmaniasis and dirofilariasis. However, it is the spread of an apparently new disease that affects the eyes, thelaziosis, which we wish to highlight.\n\nDuring the past 20 years, cases of human and canine visceral leishmaniasis (caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum, which is transmitted by sandflies) have increased throughout historical endemic foci in coastal Mediterranean regions. Furthermore, the disease has spread beyond these regions into new areas at more northerly latitudes, including northern Italy 2 and Madrid, Spain. 3 Like visceral leishmaniasis, canine dirofilariasis, which is caused by mosquito-transmitted filarial worms, is also often diagnosed in southern Mediterranean regions. Until 1999, most cases in human beings originated from Italy, France, Greece, the real overall incidence of parasitic diseases declined constantly. 7 Under the leadership of the national and local governments and implementation of a one-health strategy, along with close joint multisectoral collaboration between the departments of health, agriculture, and the environment, some parasitic diseases have reached or approached elimination status. The elimination of filariasis throughout China was certified in 2007 by WHO. Furthermore, the goal of nationwide malaria elimination by 2020 was established, and schistosomiasis is close to being eliminated.\n\nAdditionally, in China, screening of blood donors and surgical patients for HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and syphilis have been successively required since the 1990s, which facilitated the active identification of new and past infections of these pathogens. 8, 9 However, further studies are needed to assess actual incidence trends.\n\nAs a whole, due to the unprecedented rapid development of urbanisation and industrialisation in China in the past three decades, the pattern of interaction between human beings and pathogens has changed greatly, substantially altering disease epidemiology. Therefore, to better understand the epidemiological features, changing trends, and severity of diseases, a well functioning public health surveillance system, integrated with population-based studies on specific diseases, should be continually intensified to effectively plan, implement, evaluate, and improve disease control strategies. China's experience can be shared with the rest of the world."}
