Standard reactions contained 0,25 \u00b5M of protein (NP-exo MOPV or LCMV or mutants) and 1,25 \u00b5M of radiolabeled RNA substrate.\n\nAfter incubated at 37\u00b0C, the reactions were quenched at intervals between 0 and 30 minutes by the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer (formamide containing 10mM EDTA). The products were heated at 70\u00b0C for 5 minutes, rapidly cooled on ice for 3 minutes followed by separation in a 20% poly-acrylamide gel containing 8 M urea and buffered with 0,5X Tris-borate-EDTA. Gels were exposed overnight to a phosphor screen and then visualized with a phosphoimager FLA-3000 (Fuji). Total RNA degradation products were quantified using Image Guage (Fuji), the speed of cleavage determined and graphs plotted using GraphPad PRISM version 6.0. Experiments were carried out at least in triplicate and only representative gels are shown.\n\nA real-time PCR set-up (Bio-rad) was used to monitor the thermal unfolding of the ExoN domain of NP -MOPV or LCMV alone or in the presence of different divalent ions Mn 2+ , Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ and Zn 2+ . Proteins were equilibrated in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol. All reactions were set up in a final volume of 25 \u00b5l in a 96-well plate with total protein concentration of 1,8 mg/ml, 1x SYPRO Orange and incubated with or without 5 mM of metal ions.\n\nThe PCR plates were sealed with optical sealing tape (Bio-rad) and incubated in the PCR machine for 2 minutes at 20\u00b0C followed by 0,2\u00b0C increments to a final temperature of 95\u00b0C. Thermal The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/541698 doi: bioRxiv preprint intensities were measured at 490 nm excitation and 530 nm emission wavelengths. The unfolding of proteins was monitored by following the increase in fluorescence of the probe as it binds to exposed hydrophobic regions of the denatured protein. The Tm was then calculated as the mid-log of the transition phase of the florescence curve using the Boltzmann equation. All measurements were performed in triplicates.\n\nStructure and sequence comparison of Arenavirus exonuclease with other viral exonuclease.\n\nStructure similarities were search with PDBeFold [52] using the MOPV exonuclease domain as a search model (PDB : 5LRP). Corresponding sequences were aligned based on structure comparison using Expresso [53] . Figures were generated with the programs ESPript-ENDscript [54] , WebLogo server [55] and UCSF chimera [56] .\n\nSequence retrieval of mammarenavirus L and analysis.\n\nAll annotated complete protein sequences of Mammarenaviruses L protein were downloaded from NCBI. The dataset of 559 sequences was manually curated using Jalview [57] in order to remove Identical, mis-annotated or complete sequences with undefined amino acid (X).\n\nThe remaining 395 sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [58] constituting the Mammarenavirus The MOPV strain AN21366 (JN561684 and JN561685) was used to establish the reverse genetics system for MOPV. The detailed procedures for virus rescue, production, titration and infection of Vero E6 cells (VERO C1008 [Vero 76, clone E6, Vero E6] ATCC\u00ae CRL-1586\u2122 (ATCC, LGC Standards, Molsheim, France) are described in [44] . In brief, the recombinant NP-exo WT and mutant (D390A/G393A) MOPV were used to infect Vero E6 cells using a MOI of 0.01.\n\nSupernatants were collected four days post infection. Viral production/titration/infection were repeated iteratively for 10 times. For viral titration, the presence of the viruses was revealed by immunostaining in infected cells with a polyclonal rabbit antibody that recognizes the MOPV Z protein (Agrobio, France) and a phosphatase alkaline-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) and 1-Step NBT/BCIP substrate (Thermo Fisher scientific, Waltham, MA).\n\nResults are expressed in Focus Forming Unit per mL (FFU/mL). For RNA quantification, viral RNA were extracted from cell culture supernatants (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and quantification was performed with the EuroBioGreen qPCR Mix Lo-ROX (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France), using an in house developed assay with 5'-CTTTCCCCTGGCGTGTCA-3' and 5'-GAATTTTGAAGGCTGCCTTGA-3' primers. Deep sequencing analysis of viral genomes was performed as described in [44] .\n\nThe MOPV NP-exo exhibits a metal-dependent 3'-5' ExoN activity. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/541698 doi: bioRxiv preprint exo MOPV is able to cleave this stable RNA hairpin (DG=-14.7 kcal/mole) predominantly down to a 18-mer product. After removing the 1 st 4 nucleotides, degradation stops at the loop region. A similar experiment in the presence of Mn 2+ allows further degradation into the loop, whereas ExoN is inactive in the presence of either Zn 2+ or Ca 2+ . The laddering degradation pattern visualized on the gel, together with radio-label quantification indicate that it acts in the 3'-5' direction (S2B Fig). Visual examination of degradation kinetics shows, a band-product accumulation prior to G nucleotides, indicating that the latter are slower to remove than Cs. We also tested the ExoN activity of the ExoN domain of NP-LCMV (NP-exo LCMV) (Fig 1A) on the same RNA substrate. Both proteins cleave the RNA following a similar degradation pattern and comparable kinetics (S2B Fig   and S3 Table) . The two ExoNs exhibit their highest activity in the presence of Mn 2+ , followed by Mg 2+ and they are inactive in the presence of either Ca 2+ or Zn 2+ or EDTA (Fig 1A ) . These results show that the nature of the ions is altering the ExoN activity and its associated pattern of degradation can be greatly modulated by the nature of the metal ion co-factor.\n\nTo study the effect of divalent metal binding on the stability of NP-exo MOPV, we measured the change in melting temperature (Tm) by a Thermal Shift Assay (TSA) in the presence of 5 mM of several metal ions. NP-exo MOPV without metal ions has a Tm of 49.4 \u00b0C. Positive Tm shifts are observed in the presence of MnCl 2 (+16.5 \u00b0C), MgCl 2 (+4.9 \u00b0C), CaCl 2 (+7.5 \u00b0C) and a slight negative shift in ZnCl 2 (-2.2 \u00b0C) (Fig 2) . Simultaneously we compared the effect of these ions on the stability of NP-exo LCMV (Fig 2) . The Tm value for NP-exo LCMV without metal ions is 50. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/541698 doi: bioRxiv preprint stability in all ExoNs. It is also worth noting that CaCl 2 which inhibits the 3'-5' ExoN activity is a better stabilizer than MgCl 2 .\n\nOur results show that stability and activity are uncoupled : lowering the energy of the domain is not key for activation. Rather the nature of the ion plays a key role : the small radius and higher coordination of Mn 2+ over Mg 2+ allow a higher number of water molecules available for being activated for the nucleophilic attack. On the contrary, Ca 2+ with a larger radius slightly deforms the catalytic site [43] and increases the distances with the substrate, thus impairing the reaction.\n\nWe mutated each catalytic residue to alanine in order to assess their respective contribution in the conserved DEDDh catalytic motif, and tested them for ExoN activity. For the NP-exo MOPV mutants D390A, E392A and D534A, the 3'-5' ExoN activity is completely abolished whereas D467A and H529A are still able to slowly excise up to two nucleotides. For the NP-exo LCMV mutants, a slightly different result is observed. D382A and E384A show a complete loss of activity, D459A excises two nucleotides but more efficiently than D467A of NP-exo MOPV as judged by the diminution of the 22 nts band-product. The H517A also shows residual activity while the D522A is able to degrade almost the total amount of 22 nt dsRNA up to 20/19 nts (Fig 1A) . We compared the efficacy of cleavage between the wild type NP-exo MOPV and NP-exo LCMV to their corresponding mutants D467A and D459A respectively. Our kinetic experiment indicates that the initial excision rate of NP-exo MOPV and NP-exo LCMV wild types are similar, the rate of D459A\n\nof LCMV decreases to about half that of the wild-type, and that of MOPV D467A is significantly The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/541698 doi: bioRxiv preprint NP-exo MOPV ds RNA substrate specificity.\n\nIn order to investigate the substrate requirement for NP-exo MOPV, and NP-exo LCMV , we tested their activities on different RNA substrates HP4, A30 (poly A) and LE19. All these single stranded RNA ( ss RNA) forms several types of secondary structures RNA, which were predicted using Mfold server [59] (S2A Fig). The ExoN assay confirms and extends findings shown in Fig 1, i.e that NP-exo MOPV and NP-exo LCMV cleave RNA substrates whose 3' ends are engaged into a double stranded structure (Fig 3) , consistent with a strict specific double stranded RNA requirement. It is particularly striking in the case of LE19 : at time 0, we observed the 3 species of secondary structures (migration for type A : 19 , B: 18 and C : 17 nucleotides respectively) and with time the top band-product disappears to the profit of an RNA of 17 nucleotides. We observed that NP-exo seems to be partly active on small secondary structure ds RNA but is inactive on ss RNA ( Fig   3) .\n\nAs the NP-exo MOPV presents similar in vitro behavior to other Arenavirus NP-exo, we conclude that the ExoN activity per se is not responsible for immune suppression, and that the latter is mediated by elements embedded in the domain itself. It was thus of interest to better characterize the substrate specificity of the NP-exo in order to disclose its role in arenavirus replication.\n\nWe measured NP-exo MOPV and NP-exo LCMV's ability to cleave different ds RNA substrates. Because the key enzyme in the innate immune response; the protein kinase RNAactivated (PKR); is induced by the presence of ds RNA, we made use of a perfectly annealed ds RNA, as well as several potential RNA substrates such as those mimicking an erroneous replication product with one, two or three mismatched nucleotides at the 3'-end. To that end, a 40-mer RNA The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/541698 doi: bioRxiv preprint template (RT1) blocked in 3'-end with a phosphate group was annealed to a radiolabeled RNA carrying zero (RL2*) or one (RL3*), two (RL4*) or three (RL5*) non-complementary nucleotides at its 3'-end as shown in Fig 4A. Fig 4B shows that both enzymes are strict ds RNA ExoNs, with the interesting specific ability to digest substrates carrying a single 3'-terminal mismatch (RL3*/RT1).\n\nQuantification of total product ( Fig 4C) shows a comparable hydrolytic activity between the perfectly annealed ds RNA and a single 3'-terminal mismatch. The cleavage efficiency, however, drastically drops with the number of unpaired bases at the 3'-end.\n\nThe overall fold of NP-exo MOPV is homologous to that of the other arenavirus ExoNs [43] . Structural comparison reveals that the structure of NP-exo MOPV is very similar to that of The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/541698 doi: bioRxiv preprint shows that secondary structure elements belonging to the catalytic core are arranged in a similar manner. Our results suggest a common origin of the Coronaviridae Nsp14 and Arenaviridae NP ExoNs.\n\nTo assess the possible role of the NP-exo activity in viral replication and/or genome stability, we passaged iteratively 10 times in Vero E6 cells at a MOI of 0.01 a NP-exo defective virus (NP-exo(-))carrying the D390A/G393A mutants as well as a NP-exo WT recombinant MOPV.\n\nWe first quantified both the infectious titers ( Fig 6A, left axis) and the NP RNA viral loads (Fig 6A, right axis) of the cell culture supernatants. Our results showed that the infectious viral titers of both viruses followed a parallel trend, the NP-exo(-) always presenting a 40 (minimum, passage 4) to 190 (maximum, passage 6) fold decrease in titer compared to the NP-exo WT MOPV. From passages 1 to 5/6, infectious titers continuously decreased (down to a 5 fold for the WT and down a 90 fold for the mutant compared to passage 1) before a rebound from passage 6 to 8/9 to titers similar to those of passage 2 followed by another general decrease at passage 10. The viral loads of NP-exo WT and NP-exo(-) MOPV described the same trends as the infectious viral titers albeit with less pronounced variations. The viral load for the WT virus remained stable along the passages with a maximum 3 fold difference while the NP-exo(-) virus had a maximum 13 fold difference.\n\nWe also calculated the RNA/FFU ratio for both viruses (Fig 6B) . On average, the NP-exo WT and NP-exo mutant viruses respectively presented one infectious particle for 3600 and 23000 NP RNA copies, respectively. Interestingly, the maximum ratio was reached at passage 5 for both viruses with 1 FFU for 11300 copies for the WT NP-exo and 1 FFU for 119600 copies for the NP-exo(-).\n\nWe next investigated the genomic stability of these two viruses at passage 1 and 10 through deep sequencing analysis. We almost reached a complete coverage of the MOPV genomes except for the 5' and 3' end and most of the intergenic region of both segments. The tandem repeated and complementary sequences promote strong secondary structures in the intergenic regions and may explain the lack of reads observed for this region for both viruses.\n\nThe presence of WT NP sequences detected at passage one for both viruses likely originated from the plasmid expressing the WT NP ORF used for rescuing the virus (data not shown). To make sure our results matched a standard threshold usually observed with the presence of an internal control of sequencing, we considerate a 5% cutoff as a significant read percentage for the effective presence of a mutation (minimum mean coverage of 2636 reads for the L segment of the NP-exo(-) virus and maximum mean coverage of 12610 reads for the S segment of the NP-exo WT virus). As shown in Table 1 \n\nWe observe that the overall mutation rate is stable between NP-exo WT and NP-exo(-) MOPV, yet we also notice that the frequency of these mutations has changed. We observe at passage 10 a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/541698 doi: bioRxiv preprint %) for the WT and of ~ 16.6 % (comprised between 5 to 93 %) for the mutant, in particular the substitution of C to T. While for the S segment mutations appear along the entire for the WT and clustered for the mutant at respective frequencies of 14.6 % and 19.5 %.\n\nAmong all mutations recorded, only a few were present for either both viruses and/or at the two different passages. Indeed, three mutations in the S segment and one mutation in the L segment are present for both viruses at passages one and ten and likely represent stable quasi-species (Table S4, and Table 1 yellow highlight).\n\nThree mutations in the L segment are commonly found for the two viruses only at passage 10 ( Table   1 , orange highlight). Interestingly, three non-synonymous mutations in the L-polymerase ORF (S184L, S1021P and L1477S, Table 1 , red highlight) became majority for the NP-exo(-) virus at passage 10.\n\nTo ascertain the trend observed in our genomic sequencing data, we investigated the natural occurrence of theses mutations in Mammarenavirus (MAMV) using bioinformatics. The presupposed being that if these mutations appear randomly they should be significantly (> 5 %) represented in the general population of MAMV and LASV.\n\nFrom the three subsets of sequences generated; i.e MAMV, LASV and MOPV; we observed that the three mutations S184L, S1021P and L1477S appeared in conserved regions in all three subsets, that none of the three mutants were reported in MOPV subset and finally that the three amino acid are subject to diverse selective pressure (Fig 7) . Indeed, serine at the position 184 represents the majority of the observed amino acid variants while the specific mutation S184L represents only 1 % of the total observed sequences in the LASV or MAMV subsets. This observation indicates that the mutation is viable but most likely costly to be maintained by the virus. On the other hand, at position 1021, the serine observed in MOPV subset does not represent the majority of the observed amino acid in the other subsets, the proline is by far the most frequent amino acids found (Fig 7) . In The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/541698 doi: bioRxiv preprint LASV, the serine subset represents only 3% of the observed amino acids at this position while 10% in the MAMV subset (Fig 7) . This observation indicates that this position in MOPV is an oddity compared to the others. It seems that the natural tendency in the L protein is to have a proline rather than a serine at this position. The fact that we observe that particular reversion in the NP-Exo(-) could indicate that for L MOPV there is a constraint at this particular position. Finally, at position 1477, the amino acid found at this position for the three subsets is a leucine (Fig 7) , indicating that, that particular position is under a high selective pressure. The mutation L1477S was never observed in any subsets, this mutation can be interpreted as unlikely and therefore considered as direct consequence of the NP-Exo(-).\n\nOur results show that compared to the WT virus, the abrogation of the NP-exo activity did not increase the mutation rate found in the MOPV genomic sequences present in the cell culture supernatant, but the emergence of the three mutants of rare occurrence are the direct consequence of the NP-Exo(-), which have relaxed the control over certain position implying a direct effect of the MOPV exonuclease on its own genomic RNA.\n\nThe paradigm of Arenaviridae NP ExoN states that it is involved in innate immunity suppression [37, [60] [61] [62] , through degradation of ds RNAs which would otherwise stimulate the innate immunity response. Several reports have demonstrated that NP is responsible for the degradation of these ds RNAs using the 3'-5' ExoN located at its C-terminus [25, 32, 35, 63] . This ExoN comprises a DEDDh catalytic motif that is completely conserved across the Arenaviridae [35] implying this activity may be a general feature of arenavirus NPs. The ExoN domain is conserved within the family regardless of both the virus pathogenic potential and its ability to suppress efficiently type I IFN, as previously reported for TCRV and MOPV [42, 60, 64] . MOPV is the closest counterpart of 18 386 387 LASV and presents a 73% NP sequence identity with LASV. During LASV infections, the virus targets mainly macrophages (MP) and dendritic (DC) cells [65] , and infections are characterized by high viremia and generalized immune suppression supposedly due to innate immune inhibition by the ExoN domain. Both MOPV and LASV induces strong type I IFN responses in MP and moderately in DC, but contrarily to LASV which abrogates this response, MOPV does not [42, 64] .\n\nOur functional study demonstrates that the ExoN structure, substrate specificity, and mechanism is indeed conserved across the family. It is also clear from the structure-ion analysis [43] , that toying with the catalytic ion leads to slight structural changes which impact dramatically [61] , correlated innate immunity suppression to ExoN mutants, postulating a direct involvement of the ExoN activity. We observed that mutant D382A completely loses ExoN activity consistently with results from reverse genetic studies [61] . A noticeable difference concern the mutant E384A, that was shown to have no effect and be dispensable for ExoN activity [61] , is rather shown critical in our in vitro study and consistent with the structural data as E384 (equivalent to MOPV E392) is involved in binding one of the catalytic ion (S4 Fig). Under our conditions, D459A and H517A still retains their ability to cleave two nucleotides meanwhile D522A shows a significant activity leading to the removal of two to three nucleotides. Theses latter three mutants were not reported before but the analysis of the structure of NP-exo MOPV confirms that major features such as fold, and the two ion binding sites (catalytic and structural) are conserved within the Arenaviridae [25, 32, 35, 36, 63] . Residues D390, E392, D534 of NP-exo MOPV directly coordinate the catalytic ion. Mutation of these residues logically alter ion binding and thus leads to complete loss of catalytic activity. The residual activity observed for D522A of NP-exo LCMV is rather difficult to explain as the two structures present no clear differences in the ion binding mode. ExoNs [36, 43] . Therefore MOPV ExoN activity alone is not per se responsible for the differences in innate immunity suppression between MOPV and LASV. Rather, the presence of the ExoN activity may serve other purposes in the viral life cycle, which might be connected directly or indirectly to innate immunity.\n\nIn particular, previous studies on LCMV and PICV suggested that altering the NP ExoN also impacts replication, irrespective to the IFN status of the host cell [61, 67] . The structural relatedness with the Coronavirus ExoN and its implication in viral replication prompted us to investigate to which extend the arenavirus ExoN domain is able to excise unpaired nucleotides. Our enzyme activity assays demonstrate that NP-exo MOPV and NP-exo LCMV can efficiently and selectively cleave a ds RNA mimicking an erroneous replication product carrying one 3'-mismatched nucleotide (Fig 4) . Our analysis confirms that despite additional inserted structural elements, the two domains belong to the same Ribonuclease H-like superfamily. In the case of Coronaviridae, several studies have pointed to a main role of the ExoN domain of nsp14 in RNA proofreading [47] [48] [49] [50] to maintain genome stability. Structural comparison between ExoN domain of nsp14 and MOPV shows conservation of active site and main fold (Fig 5) suggesting that they have a distant but common origin. Recent work by Becares and colleagues have shown that nsp14 of Coronavirus is also involved in innate immunity modulation [68] . Therefore, these data show that at least in mutations / kb. This means that the polymerase was able to incorporate a mismatch and then elongate it. The error rate does not change between the WT and the mutant, which is consistent with the fact that we did not altered the polymerase. For both, these mutations appears along the entire L segment at an average frequency of ~10.1 % (comprised between 5 to 24 %) for the WT and of 16.6 % (comprised between 5 to 93 %) for the mutant. The fact that unlikely mutants have become prevalent, as observed at passage 10, reflect that the control over certain type of mutation have been abolished, thus implicating that ExoN is active on its own genomic RNA. In this study, it is not the particular set of mutations that is relevant but rather that a set of unlikely mutations have emerged.\n\nThe bias inferred by impairment of the ExoN, together with the biochemistry presented here is consistent with the idea that ExoN is involved in a mismatch excision system.\n\nAlthough the presence of mismatch excision system is logically associated to very large genomes (~30 kb) in Coronaviridae, the presence of such activity, and potentially such RNA repair system, in Arenaviridae of intermediate genome size (~11 kb) remains puzzling. Our results shows a clear diminution of the viral titer for viruses depleted of ExoN activity, but no clear evidence of a drastic increase of mutation in the genome that would lead to catastrophic event. Then what is happening in these mutated viruses? One tentative explanation could be the ExoN is involved in : i) checking and maintaining the sequence integrity of the conserved genomic region at its extremities, and/or ii) the structural integrity of the Intergenic Region (IGR). Indeed, both regions have been previously reported as being critical for viral fitness: i) The conserved region (19 nucleotides) exhibit high degree of sequence conservation at the 3'-termini and is complementary to the 5' end of scenario in which the polymerase is able to incorporate a mismatch but is unable to elongate it, leading to a decrease of suitable genomic material to package, therefore without the ExoN control the number of functional RNP would be reduced and consistent with the loss of viral fitness observed here and else [61, 67] . Therefore we propose that the Arenavirus ExoN is involved in a \"limited proof-reading\" mechanism driven by structural constraints rather than genomic stability.\n\nAnother observation that concurs to the \"limited proof-reading\" mechanism is the difference of Ribavirin efficiency on Arenaviridae and Coronaviridae. Ribavirin is the only drug so far administered on large scale and having demonstrated a decrease of mortality rates up to 5%, if administered within the first 6 days of arenaviral illness [73] . On the other hand, Ribavirin is ineffective against coronaviruses [74, 75] , as nsp14 ExoN domain excises the nucleotide analogue [51] . It is likely, that for Arenaviridae, the ExoN activity involved in a \"limited proof-reading\" mechanism remains as a trace of its past common ancestor with Coronaviridae. The critical problem of genomic stability being solved, either by the conservation of the \"original\" function of the ExoN for Coronaviridae, or by genome segmentation for Arenaviridae.\n\nAs a conclusion we have shown that the MOPV ExoN is fully functional, behaving like other Arenaviral ExoN on ds RNA. We have demonstrated that Arenaviral ExoN are able to excise an RNA mismatch, and that is active on its own genomic RNA like its counterpart in Coronaviridae.\n\nUnder the conditions used here, abrogation of ExoN activity does not impact genomic stability significantly. Our results suggest that the Arenaviridae RNA ExoN, like that of Coronaviridae, is at a crossroad between replication efficiency and innate immunity evasion in the infected cell.
