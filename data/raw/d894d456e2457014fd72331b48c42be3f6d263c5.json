{"title": "Susceptibility of porcine IPEC-J2 intestinal epithelial cells to infection with porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and serum cytokine responses of gnotobiotic pigs to acute infection with IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV", "body": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), a member of the genus Deltacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales, causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and mortality in nursing pigs (Jung et al., 2015b; Lau et al., 2012) . PDCoV has been successfully isolated and propagated in two epithelial cell lines of swine origin, LLC porcine kidney (LLC-PK) and swine testicular (ST) cells (Hu et al., 2015) . The optimal cell culture conditions to isolate and propagate PDCoV in LLC-PK and ST cells required supplementation of 10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin and 1% pancreatin in the cell culture maintenance medium, respectively (Hu et al., 2015) . The addition of trypsin and pancreatin in the PDCoV-inoculated LLC-PK and ST cells, respectively, resulted in similar cytopathic effects (CPE) that consisted of enlarged, rounded, and densely granular cells that occurred singly or in clusters, followed by cell shrinkage and detachment as a result of apoptotic cell death . On the other hand, infected enterocytes in vivo appeared to acutely undergo vacuolar degeneration and exfoliated extensively from the villous epithelium, followed by villous atrophy (Chen et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015b) . This process might be associated with necrosis of the infected enterocytes .\n\nThe porcine enterocyte cell line, IPEC-J2, is a non-transformed, stable small intestinal columnar epithelial cell line (Brosnahan and Brown, 2012; Vergauwen, 2015) . The cells were originally isolated from the mid-jejunal epithelium of a neonatal unsuckled piglet in 1989 at the University of North Carolina (Brosnahan and Brown, 2012; Vergauwen, 2015) . Because of the significant physiologic and morphologic similarities to enterocytes in vivo, this primary cell line has been used increasingly to characterize the interactions of intestinal epithelial cells with enteric bacteria and viruses in vitro. IPEC-J2 cells have been infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Lin et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2014) . Compared with PEDV-infected Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells (Guo et al., 2016) , the proteomic data from PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells appeared to better coincide with the physiologic and pathologic outcomes in PEDV-infected enterocytes in vivo (Lin et al., 2017) .\n\nIn our previous study, IPEC-J2 cells were also evaluated in parallel with LLC-PK and ST cells (Hu et al., 2015) . However, IPEC-J2 cells failed to efficiently support the isolation and propagation of PDCoV, despite the fact that IPEC-J2 cells originate from villous enterocytes in the small intestine that are the main site of PDCoV infection in vivo. We hypothesized that the lower susceptibility of IPEC-J2 cells to initial infection with PDCoV, compared with LLC-PK or ST cells, could have been increased if virus of higher titer, than that contained in the original fecal samples (Hu et al., 2015) , was used as inoculum in IPEC-J2 cells. Therefore, we used the cell culture-adapted PDCoV to investigate: i) whether porcine IPEC-J2 cells are susceptible to infection with cell culture-adapted PDCoV; ii) the cell death mechanism, necrosis or apoptosis, by which PDCoV causes death of infected IPEC-J2 cells in vitro; iii) if the cell death of PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells in vitro resembles necrosis of infected enterocytes in vivo; and iv) whether PDCoV infection induces altered or increased pro-inflammatory or innate cytokine responses in supernatants of IPEC-J2 cells in vitro and in the serum of infected gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs in vivo. For the in vivo study, we inoculated Gn piglets with the IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV to examine the enteropathogenicity and the induction of innate and proinflammatory cytokines in the sera during the acute PDCoV infection.\n\nThe PDCoV OH-FD22-P8 (passage 8) virus was serially passaged in LLC-PK (ATCC CL-101) cells supplemented with trypsin (10 \u03bcg/ml) in the cell culture medium for a total of 8 passages, as described previously (Hu et al., 2015) . After the 6 th passage, the virus was purified once by a plaque assay and then further serially passaged (Hu et al., 2015) . The viral RNA titer of the OH-FD22-P8 used in this study was 10.5 log 10 genomic equivalents (GE)/ml, and the infectious titer was 8.6 log 10 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml.\n\nThe thirty-second passage of IPEC-J2 cells was kindly provided by Dr. Helen Bershneider at the University of North Carolina, and they were passaged 7 more times in our laboratory. In this study, the IPEC-J2 cells were further passaged up to 18 times (total passages 40-58) before use. Virus was inoculated onto 3-4 day-old confluent cell monolayers. The cells were propagated and passaged in the following growth medium: Dulbecco's modified eagle medium/F12 (DMEM/F12) (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (Gibco), 1% insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite (Roche), and 5 ng/ml of human epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), as recommended by Dr. Helen Bershneider.\n\nThe cell culture conditions tested to infect IPEC-J2 cells with PDCoV OH-FD22-P8 during each passage of the virus are described in detail in the Results section. During the 1 st [multiplicity of infection (MOI), 2.5] to the 2 nd passage of the virus, they were as follows: Washing of cells with maintenance medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin) (MMT) twice to remove FBS, virus adsorption for one hour, and then washing (with MMT) once and the addition of MMT with 10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin (Gibco). During the 3 rd to 5 th serial passage of OH-FD22-P8 virus (estimated MOI, 0.1 for the 4 th and 5 th passages), however, the wash steps were omitted after virus adsorption. Viral CPE was monitored frequently in the inoculated IPEC-J2 cells.\n\n2.4. Periodic-Acid-Schiff or immunofluorescent staining for the detection of the neutral sialylated mucin, serotonin, or leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 in IPEC-J2 cells\n\nPrior to the infection assays, we attempted to confirm that no other types of cells were present in the IPEC-J2 cells, such as the mucussecreting goblet cells or the neutrotransmitter serotonin-secreting enterochromaffin cells, and also tested if the IPEC-J2 cell monolayers express leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) (intestinal stem cell marker) antigen by Periodic-Acid-Schiff (PAS) or immunofluorescent (IF) staining at post-inoculation hour (PIH) 24, 48, and 72. IPEC-J2 cells were fixed with 100% ethanol at 4\u00b0C overnight and tested by IF staining, as described previously (Hu et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015a Jung et al., , 2016 , for the detection of serotonin or LGR5 antigen, using monoclonal antibodies against human serotonin or human LGR5 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA). Monoclonal antibodies were diluted 1 in 50 in phosphate-buffered saline. PAS staining was used for the detection of the neutral sialylated mucin-secreting goblet cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (Jung and Saif, 2017) .\n\nCell culture supernatants were collected from PDCoV-inoculated and non-inoculated IPEC-J2 cells at the time-points as indicated in the Results section. The RNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcl of centrifuged (2000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C) cell culture supernatants using the Mag-MAX Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PDCoV RNA titers in cell culture supernatants were determined, as described previously (Jung et al., 2015b) . Infectious-virus titration was conducted by a TCID50 assay, as described previously (Hu et al., 2015) . IPEC-J2 cells were seeded into 96-well plates, and after confluence, the monolayers were washed once with MMT. One hundred microliters of 10-fold dilutions of PDCoV were inoculated onto the cell monolayers in eight replicates per dilution. After virus adsorption for one hour, another 100 \u03bcl of MMT with 10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin was added to each well. Viral CPE was monitored daily for 4 to 6 days, and IF staining was also done for the detection of PDCoV antigen in IPEC-J2 cells as described below. Virus titers were calculated by using the Reed-Muench method and expressed as TCID 50 per ml.\n\nWhen PDCoV-inoculated IPEC-J2 cells showed more than 50% CPE, they were fixed with 100% ethanol at 4\u00b0C overnight. The PDCoV-infected cells were prepared in duplicate and tested by IF staining for the detection of PDCoV antigen, using hyperimmune Gn pig antiserum against PDCoV OH-FD22 strain, as described previously (Jung et al., 2015b; Jung et al., 2016) . Trypsin (10 \u03bcg/ml) alone-treated IPEC-J2 cells were tested as negative controls for IF staining.\n\n(10 \u03bcg/ml) alone-treated IPEC-J2 cells were also tested as negative controls for the TUNEL assay.\n\nSix Large White \u00d7 Duroc crossbred Gn pigs were acquired by hysterectomy from a pregnant sow obtained from a PDCoV-and PEDV-free, specific-pathogen-free (confirmed by history and seronegative sows; lack of qRT-PCR-positive fecal samples) swine herd of The Ohio State University. The SPF herd was seronegative for antibodies to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine circovirus type 2. Six 10-day-old Gn piglets were randomly assigned to one of two groups: PDCoV-inoculated (n = 2; pigs 1 and 2) and mock-inoculated (n = 4; pigs 3-6). Pigs were inoculated orally with 2 ml [8.7 log 10 genomic equivalents (GE) per pig] of the IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV OH-FD22-P8-I-P4 [passage 4 in IPEC-J2 cells (P4); 8.4 log 10 GE/ ml], or mock inoculated with MEM. After PDCoV inoculation, the pigs were monitored frequently for clinical signs. PDCoV-inoculated and the negative control pigs were monitored for fecal virus shedding and viremia by qRT-PCR at post-inoculation days (PID) 1 to 5 and then euthanized for pathological examination at PID 5. However, the negative control pigs 4-6 were euthanized at PID 3 to establish other immunologic assays using mononuclear cells isolated from the small intestine. Diarrhea was assessed by scoring fecal consistency. Fecal consistency was scored as follows: 0 = solid; 1 = pasty; 2 = semi-liquid; 3 = liquid, with scores of 2 or more considered diarrheic. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The Ohio State University approved all protocols related to the animal experiments in this study.\n\nRectal swabs and serum samples were collected from the 2 PDCoVinoculated and 4 mock-inoculated Gn pigs daily at PID 1-5 and twice at PIDs 1, and 3 or 5, respectively. Two rectal swabs were suspended in 4 ml MEM. The RNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcl of the centrifuged (2000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C) fecal suspensions using the Mag-MAX Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PDCoV RNA titers in rectal swab fluids and serum samples were determined as described previously (Jung et al., 2015b) .\n\nSmall [duodenum, middle (mid-location of the small intestine (duodenum to ileum) dissociated from the mesentery), and ileum] and large (cecum/colon) intestinal tissues were examined grossly and histologically in the PDCoV-inoculated pigs 1-2 and mock-inoculated pig 3 at PID 5. Intestinal tissues were tested by IF staining for the detection of PDCoV antigen using the hyperimmune Gn pig antiserum against PDCoV OH-FD22 strain, as described previously (Jung et al., 2015b) . PDCoV antigen-positive scores were computed by the number of IFpositive cells in the intestinal section, as described previously , as follows: +/-(few but clearly positive), < 1% of villous epithelial cells showed staining; + (low), 1%-29% of villous epithelial cells showed staining; ++ (moderate), 30%-59% of villous epithelial cells showed staining; +++ (high), 60%-100% villous epithelial cells showed staining; and -(negative), no cells showed staining. Mean ratios of jejunal villous height to crypt depth (VH:CD) were calculated, as described previously (Jung et al., 2015a) .\n\n2.11. Analysis of innate and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in IPEC-J2 cell culture supernatants and serum samples\n\nThe levels of IFN\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12, IL-22, and TNF\u03b1 were quantitated by ELISA in the cell culture supernatants (for IFN\u03b1, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1) or the serum samples collected from the two PDCoV-inoculated Gn pigs 1-2 and the four mock-inoculated Gn pigs 3-6 at PID 1, as described previously (Annamalai et al., 2015; Azevedo et al., 2006; Chattha et al., 2013) . Briefly, Nunc Maxisorp 96-well plates were coated with antiporcine IL-6 (0.75 \u03bcg/ml, goat polyclonal antibody), anti-porcine IL-12 (0.75 \u03bcg/ml, goat polyclonal antibody), anti-porcine IFN\u03b1 (2.5 \u03bcg/ml, clone K9) (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-porcine IL-22 (2.0 \u03bcg/ ml, rabbit polyclonal antibody), and anti-porcine TNF\u03b1 (1.5 \u03bcg/ml, goat polyclonal antibody) (Kingfisher biotech, Saint Paul, MN) overnight at 4 \u2103 or 37 \u2103 (for IFN-\u03b1 only). Biotinylated anti-porcine IL-6 (0.1 \u03bcg/ml, goat polyclonal antibody), anti-porcine IL-12 (0.2 \u03bcg/ml, goat polyclonal antibody), anti-porcine IFN\u03b1 (3.75 \u03bcg/ml, clone F17) (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-porcine IL-22 (0.5 \u03bcg/ml, rabbit polyclonal antibody), and anti-porcine TNF\u03b1 (0.4 \u03bcg/ml, goat polyclonal antibody) (Kingfisher biotech, Saint Paul, MN) were used as detection antibodies. The porcine IFN-\u03b1 detection antibody was biotinylated using a commercial kit, as described previously (Chattha et al., 2013) . Plates were developed and cytokine concentrations were calculated, as previously described (Annamalai et al., 2015; Azevedo et al., 2006) . The samples were tested in duplicate, and cytokine levels were expressed as the mean values. Detection limits of our ELISA were 1 pg/ ml for IFN\u03b1 and IL-12, 4 pg/ml for TNF\u03b1 and IL-22, and 16 pg/ml for IL-6, respectively.\n\nIPEC-J2 cells are known to consist mostly of intestinal columnar epithelial cells (absorptive enterocytes) (Brosnahan and Brown, 2012; Vergauwen, 2015) . After trypsinization, the detached IPEC-J2 cells were spin down by centrifugation; however, the pelleted cells appeared more adhesive and clumped, relative to immortalized cell lines of epithelial cell origin. Therefore, prior to the infection assays using the cells, we attempted to confirm that no other types of cells were present, such as spindle-shaped (or fusiform) smooth muscle cells constituting connective tissue, the mucus-secreting goblet cells, or the neutrotransmitter serotonin-secreting enterochromaffin cells in the IPEC-J2 cell monolayers by light microscopy (or PAS staining) or IF staining at PIH 24, 48, and 72 (different stages of cell differentiation). These types of cells are anatomically located in the lamina propria (smooth muscle cell), or villous (goblet cell) or crypt (enterochromaffin cell) epithelium of the mid-jejunum, from which the IPEC-J2 cells were isolated (Brosnahan and Brown, 2012; Vergauwen, 2015) . By light microscopic examination, there were no fusiform (or fibrous) cells, but only polygonal, homogenous cells at PIH 24-72. By IF, there were also neither goblet cells positive for Periodic-Acid-Schiff staining, nor enterochromaffin cells positive for serotonin in the IPEC-J2 cell monolayers at PIH 24-72. Consistent with the previous reports (Brosnahan and Brown, 2012; Vergauwen, 2015) , the IPEC-J2 cells appeared to consist mostly of intestinal absorptive (non-secretory) villous enterocytes. However, a recent study reported that the non-homogeneity of the IPEC-J2 cells that they observed might be associated with little or no susceptibility of the cells to PEDV infection, and that only the subcloned IPEC-J2 cells became susceptible to PEDV infection (Zhang et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, it is critical to note that IPEC-J2 cells have been infected successfully with PEDV, as reported previously (Lin et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2014) . The IPEC-J2 cells also showed the ability to continuously differentiate into daughter cells, as also was supported by IF staining, showing large numbers of IPEC-J2 cells positive for the intestinal stem cell (or crypt cell) marker, LGR5 at PIH 24-72 (Supplemental Fig. S1 ).\n\nIn LLC-PK cells, supplemental trypsin in the cell culture medium contributed to a significant increase in PDCoV titers after several passages in LLC-PK cells, accompanied by CPE, compared with non-trypsin supplemented cell cultures (Hu et al., 2015) . Furthermore, supplemental trypsin (5 \u03bcg/ml) in the cell culture medium also led to the successful growth of PEDV in IPEC-J2 cells (Shi et al., 2017) . Based on these observations, prior to the supplementation of trypsin in the IPEC-J2 cell culture medium, we investigated if virus titers differ between PDCoV-inoculated IPEC-J2 cells supplemented with lower vs. higher concentrations of trypsin. An MOI of 2.5 of PDCoV OH-FD22-P8 was used for inoculation of IPEC-J2 cell monolayers in 6-well plates supplemented with two different concentrations of trypsin (2.5 vs. 10 \u03bcg/ ml) in the cell culture medium. Negative controls included cells treated with no virus but trypsin. Washing was done after virus adsorption for 1 h, as described previously (Hu et al., 2015) , and 2 ml of maintenance medium supplemented with trypsin was added. Cell culture supernatants were collected to analyze PDCoV RNA titers by qRT-PCR at PIH 20, 42, and 72. PDCoV RNA titers in trypsin (10 \u03bcg/ml)-treated, PDCoV-inoculated IPEC-J2 cells were 9.5 log 10 GE/ml, 9.6 log 10 GE/ml, and 9.8 log 10 GE/ml at PIH 20, 42, and 72, respectively, whereas viral RNA titers in the lower trypsin (2.5 \u03bcg/ml)-treated, PDCoV-inoculated IPEC-J2 cells were lower (8.5 log 10 GE/ml, 9.1 log 10 GE/ml, and 9.3 log 10 GE/ml at PIH 20, 42, and 72, respectively). However, neither of the PDCoV-inoculated, trypsin-treated groups showed CPE at PIH 20-72. None of the cell culture supernatants from the PDCoV-uninoculated, trypsin-treated negative controls were positive for PDCoV RNA at PIH 20-72. Based on these observations, the supplemental trypsin in the cell culture medium appeared to be beneficial for the growth of PDCoV in the IPEC-J2 cells. Therefore, maintenance medium was supplemented consistently with 10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin during further serial passages of PDCoV in the IPEC-J2 cells. However, our study did not define either the optimal concentration of trypsin for growth of PDCoV in the IPEC-J2 cells, or the maximum concentration of trypsin tolerated by the IPEC-J2 cells. the 2 nd passage, like the 1 st passage, no CPE was observed by 4-5 days after virus inoculation. Therefore, for the 3 rd passage of the virus, the following modifications in the procedure were tested to improve PDCoV growth and observe CPE: i) omitting washing of the cells after virus adsorption or ii) omitting removal of the inoculum. When the wash step was omitted, inoculated cells showed no CPE until PIH 24, but at PIH 48, most of cells were detached (> 90%) and most of the detached cells appeared rounded and shrunken. The PDCoV RNA titer of the cell culture supernatant was 10.5 log 10 GE/ml at PIH 48. On the other hand, when the removal of the inoculum was omitted, no CPE was found for 4 days after inoculation. However, a high PDCoV RNA titer of 9.0 log 10 GE/ml was still observed in the cell culture supernatant at PIH 48. These observations support the necessity for optimal trypsin concentrations in the MMT for PDCoV-induced CPE in IPEC-J2 cells. For continuous serial passages, the wash step was also omitted.\n\nAn estimated MOI of 0.1 of the OH-FD22-P8-I-P3 (passage 3 in IPEC-J2 cells, 5 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 /ml) was used as inoculum for the 4 th passage in IPEC-J2 cells. At PIH 18, PDCoV-inoculated IPEC-J2 cells treated with trypsin (10 \u03bcg/ml) exhibited CPE that consisted of enlarged, rounded, and densely granular cells that occurred singly or in clusters, often forming cell clumps, followed by cell shrinkage and detachment ( Fig. 1A and B ). Large numbers of the single or clustered cells that showed CPE at PIH 18 were positive for PDCoV antigen by IF staining (Fig. 1C-E) , whereas no IF-positive cells were found in the PDCoV-uninoculated, trypsin-treated negative controls (Fig. 1F-H) . By IF staining, occasionally the entire cluster of cells were positive for PDCoV antigen, and they resembled syncytial or multinucleated cells (Fig. 1C-E) .\n\nBy double IF and TUNEL staining at PIH 18 when more than 50% CPE was observed, most or large numbers of the PDCoV antigen-positive IPEC-J2 cells failed to show TUNEL-positive signals ( Fig. 2A-D) , although most of them showed CPE (enlarged and round cells). TUNELpositive signals were confirmed to be in only a few PDCoV antigenpositive IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 2E-H) ; moreover, in the same microscopic areas positive for TUNEL, most or large numbers of the PDCoV antigenpositive IPEC-J2 cells did not show TUNEL-positive signals (Fig. 2H ), indicative of little or no positive correlation of PDCoV antigens with TUNEL signals. The TUNEL-positive signals were characterized by small numbers of multiple small, round, dense, fragmented, red staining clusters (Fig. 2G) , which appeared to be fragmentation of the nucleus into multiple nuclear membrane-bound chromatin (apoptotic) bodies. The PDCoV-uninoculated, trypsin-treated IPEC-J2 cells showed no CPE, IF-or TUNEL-positive staining. Overall, the nuclei of IPEC-J2 cells infected with PDCoV did not undergo fragmentation, indicating that PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells may not undergo apoptosis, but rather necrosis, similar to necrotic cell death of infected enterocytes in vivo .\n\nAn estimated MOI of 0.1 of the OH-FD22-P8-I-P4 (passage 4 in IPEC-J2 cells, 1 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 /ml) was inoculated in duplicate onto IPEC-J2 cell monolayers (2 \u00d7 T75 flasks) for the 5 th passage, alongside a PDCoV-uninoculated, trypsin-treated negative control (1 \u00d7 T75 flask). After virus adsorption, the wash step was omitted, and 15 ml of trypsin supplemented cell culture medium was added. The cell culture supernatants (1 ml per time-point) were harvested at PIH 7, 24, 31, 48, 72, and 96. Viral CPE such as round and detached cells were observed at PIH 24, the CPE increased progressively (up to 70% CPE) until PIH 96, but complete cell detachment was not observed until PIH 96. The cell culture supernatants were harvested, centrifuged (1000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C) and stored at \u221270\u00b0C for subsequent testing. The mean infectious titers from the duplicate samples began to increase at PIH 24, compared with PIH 7, then elevated progressively and peaked at PIH 72, and decreased at PIH 96 (Fig. 3A) . Similarly, mean IL-6 concentrations from the duplicate samples increased by 6.2-fold at PIH 48, compared with the PDCoV-uninoculated, trypsin-treated negative control, and then increased progressively and peaked (by 129-fold compared with the PDCoV-uninoculated, trypsin-treated negative control) at PIH 96 (Fig. 3B) . The levels of the pro-inflammatory TNF\u03b1 and innate IFN\u03b1 cytokines in the cell culture supernatants of PDCoV-inoculated and non-inoculated cells at PIH 7-96 remained under the detection limits (1 pg/ml and 4 pg/ml for IFN\u03b1 and TNF\u03b1, respectively).\n\n3.7. IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV (OH-FD22-P8-I-P4) was enteropathogenic in 10-day-old gnotobiotic pigs\n\nBecause of the increased IL-6 observed in the PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells in vitro, as well as the lack of information on serum cytokine profiles during an acute PDCoV infection, we studied the enteropathogenicity of the IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV (OH-FD22-P8-I-P4) in Gn pigs and the innate and pro-inflammatory cytokines induced in their sera. At PID 1, PDCoV-inoculated pigs 1 and 2 exhibited watery diarrhea, accompanied by vomiting, which (but not vomiting) persisted throughout the experiment (PID 5), whereas the 4 PDCoV-uninoculated control pigs did not show any clinical signs for the experimental period (Table 1 ). The PDCoV-inoculated pigs 1 and 2 and negative control pigs 3-6 were monitored for viral RNA titers in the feces and sera and then euthanized at PID 5 for pathological examination. The results are summarized in Table 1 . At PID 1-5, by qRT-PCR, PDCoV-inoculated Gn pigs 1 and 2 had moderate to high viral RNA titers in the feces, ranging from 6.7 to 10.0 log 10 GE/ml with peak titers of 9.9-10.0 log 10 GE/ml at PID 1, whereas no negative control pigs had detectable viral RNA (< 4.6 log 10 GE/ml) in the feces during the experimental period. PDCoV-inoculated Gn pigs 1 and 2 also had low viral RNA titers in serum at PID 1 and 5, ranging from 4.0 to 5.0 log 10 GE/ml, whereas no negative control pigs had detectable viral RNA (< 3.6 log 10 GE/ml) in the serum samples at PID 1, 3, and 5.\n\nAt PID 5, the PDCoV-inoculated Gn pigs 1 and 2 exhibited gross lesions characterized by thin and transparent intestinal walls and luminal accumulation of large amounts of watery liquid in the small (but with lack of lesions in the duodenum to proximal jejunum close to the pylorus) (Fig. 4A ) and large intestine. No gross lesions were evident in the other organs of the PDCoV-inoculated Gn pigs 1 and 2 and negative control pig 3. Histologically, the duodenum of PDCoV-inoculated Gn pigs 1 and 2 showed normal mucosa, submucosa, and serosa. However, their mid-jejunum and ileum showed diffuse, severe villous atrophy (Fig. 4B-E) , as jejunal villous height: crypt depth (VH:CD) ratios ranged from 1.3 to 1.4 compared with 5.7 in the negative control pig 3 ( Fig. 4B and C; Table 1 ). No histologic lesions were evident in the large intestine and other organs of the PDCoV-inoculated Gn pigs 1 and 2 and the negative control. At PID 5, PDCoV antigens were found mostly in the villous epithelial cells, but not the crypt epithelial cells (Fig. 4D and  4E ). At PID 5, PDCoV-inoculated Gn pigs 1 and 2 showed moderate to high numbers of PEDV antigen-positive cells in the mid-jejunal epithelium (Fig. 4D) , low numbers of PEDV antigen-positive cells in the duodenal and ileal epithelium (Fig. 4E) , and a few positive cells in the colon. Low numbers of PDCoV antigen-positive cells were also detected in the Peyer's patches (Fig. 4E) . No PDCoV antigen-positive cells were detected in the intestine of the negative control pig 3.\n\nSerum innate (IFN\u03b1 and IL-22) cytokines, which are known to play a role in antiviral immune responses (Gimeno Brias et al., 2016; Zhang and Yoo, 2016) , and pro-inflammatory (TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12) cytokines were evaluated at PID 1 in the Gn pigs 1-6 to compare with the in vitro findings (increased IL-6 in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells) as well as to investigate whether acute PDCoV infection induces systemic innate and pro-inflammatory cytokine immune responses. Compared with the four uninfected Gn pigs 3-6 at PID 1, in the infected Gn pig 1, serum IFN\u03b1 and IL-22 were increased by 190-fold and 112-fold, respectively, and serum TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12 were each increased by 4-fold, 4-fold, and 4-fold (Table 2) . Similarly, compared with the four uninfected Gn pigs 3-6 at PID 1, in the infected Gn pig 2, serum IFN\u03b1 and IL-22 increased by 390-fold and 33-fold, respectively, and serum TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12 were each increased by 4-fold, 3-fold, and 3-fold (Table 2) . Although statistical analysis was not done due to too few animals in the infected group, the data clearly indicate that infected Gn pigs exhibited pronounced systemic innate and to a lesser extent, pro-inflammatory cytokine responses to acute PDCoV infection. flasks) for the 5 th passage, alongside a PDCoV-uninoculated, trypsin-treated negative control (1 \u00d7 T75 flask). After virus adsorption, the wash step was omitted, and 15 ml of trypsin supplemented cell culture medium was added. The cell culture supernatants (1 ml per time-point) were harvested at PIHs 7, 24, 31, 48, 72, and 96. The cell culture supernatants harvested were centrifuged (1000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C) and stored at \u221270\u00b0C until virus quantification by a TCID 50 assay (A) and cytokine quantification by ELISA (B). The samples were tested in duplicate, and cytokine levels or infectious virus titers were expressed as the mean values.\n\nBased on our data, IPEC-J2 cells are susceptible to infection with PDCoV, like for the other enteric CoVs, PEDV and TGEV (Guo et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2014) . Compared with LLC-PK or ST cells, our previous study revealed no or less susceptibility of IPEC-J2 cells to PDCoV infection using feces or intestinal contents or tissues of PDCoV-infected pigs (Hu et al., 2015) . However, our current study verified that PDCoV previously grown in other swine cell cultures such as LLC-PK cells can be propagated and passaged in IPEC-J2 cells. Recently, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) was identified as a major cell entry receptor for PDCoV (Li et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018) . Therefore, possible differences in pAPN expression levels among the LLC-PK, ST, and IPEC-J2 cells of swine origin could influence their susceptibility to infection with PDCoV. Supplementation of 10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin and 1% pancreatin in the cell culture maintenance medium for LLC-PK and ST cells, respectively, was essential for both growth and CPE of PDCoV in these two cell lines. Similarly, we found that addition of trypsin to the cell culture maintenance medium also contributed to both growth and CPE of PDCoV in IPEC-J2 cells. It is also noteworthy that of the two modifications in the virus inoculation procedure, i) omitting washing of the cells after virus adsorption or ii) omitting removal of the inoculum, the former method was likely more efficient to improve PDCoV growth and observe CPE in our experimental conditions, compared with the latter and initial (washing of the cells after virus adsorption) methods. The approach of omitting removal of the inoculum was used to isolate PEDV from clinical samples in Vero cells (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988; Oka et al., 2014) . The sensitivity of virus isolation was higher than that by the method of washing the cells after virus adsorption (Oka et al., 2014) . Even after the virus adsorption procedure ended, the two modifications might have allowed cell-unbound viruses to continue to bind to the cell surface. The cell-unbound viruses might have also underwent proteolysis of the spike protein in the presence of trypsin in the cell culture maintenance medium, resulting in cell entry of PDCoV via the cellular receptor, pAPN, although optimal trypsin concentrations might be needed in the maintenance medium, as mentioned in the Results section 3.3.\n\nBy light microscopic examination, CPE observed in the three LLC-PK, ST, and IPEC-J2 cell lines appeared similar, consisting of enlarged, rounded, and densely granular cells that occurred singly or in clusters, followed by cell shrinkage and detachment. In infected LLC-PK or ST cells, CPE might be a result of apoptotic cell death, as reported previously . Interestingly, however, our current study revealed no positive correlation of PDCoV antigen or CPE with TUNEL signals, unlike PDCoV infection in LLC-PK or ST cells. Our double IF and TUNEL staining demonstrated that most or large numbers of the PDCoV antigen-and CPE-positive IPEC-J2 cells failed to show TUNEL-positive signals. The few TUNEL-positive signals found in the few PDCoV antigen-positive IPEC-J2 cells might be associated with increased IL-6 in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells or other undefined intrinsic apoptosis pathway inducers (Grunnet et al., 2009; Salguero et al., 2005) . Based on these observations, the cell death observed in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells may not be due to apoptosis, but possibly, necrosis as a result of the cytolytic action(s) of the virus, similar to necrotic cell death observed in PDCoV-infected intestinal villous epithelial cells in vivo .\n\nOur study also revealed that IL-6 increased in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cell culture supernatants at PIH 48-96, as tested by ELISA, concurrent with the increased titers of PDCoV at PIH 24-72. Compared with the PDCoV-uninoculated, trypsin-treated negative control, IL-6 levels in the infected IPEC-J2 cells increased by 6.2-to 129-fold at PIH 48-96, indicating that PDCoV induces this pro-inflammatory cytokine and that IPEC-J2 cells are capable of producing IL-6. The increased IL-6 levels in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells is similar to the increased mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF\u03b1) in IPEC-J2 cells infected with PEDV (Lin et al., 2017) .\n\nTo our knowledge, there is no information on serum cytokine responses of pigs to acute PDCoV infection. Therefore, in our study, we inoculated Gn piglets orally with the IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV to define innate and pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in the sera during the acute stage of infection as well as to confirm the Table 1 Summary of clinical signs, viral RNA titers in the feces and serum samples, and histopathologic and immunofluorescent (IF) staining results from 10-day-old gnotobiotic pigs inoculated orally with 8.7 log 10 GE/pig of the IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV (OH-FD22-P8-I-P4) or mock at post-inoculation day (PID) 1 to 5.

Veterinary Microbiology 221 (2018) 49-58 enteropathogenicity in pigs. Our study verified the enteropathogenicity of the IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV (OH-FD22-P8-I-P4) in the inoculated Gn pigs 1 and 2, similar to that of the original (wild-type) or LLC-PK cell culture-grown OH-FD22 strain in Gn pigs Jung et al., 2015b) . The inoculated pigs exhibited watery diarrhea and moderate to high viral RNA titers in the feces (6.7-10.0 log 10 GE/ml) at PID 1-5 and severe atrophic enteritis (jejunal VH:CD ratio of 1.3-1.4) at PID 5. Our current study also clearly demonstrated that predominantly innate (IFN\u03b1 and IL-22) and to a lesser extent, pro-inflammatory (TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12) cytokine levels in the sera of infected Gn pigs during acute PDCoV infection (PID 1) were increased by 33-to 390-fold and 3-to 4-fold, respectively, compared with the corresponding negative control pigs. This observation is similar to increased serum innate (IFN\u03b1 and IL-22) and pro-inflammatory (IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and IL-12) cytokine responses of 9-10-day old, Gn or conventional pigs to acute PEDV infection ( unpublished). In particular, 3-to 4-fold increases in the pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in the PDCoV-infected Gn pigs 1 and 2 coincided with the decreased or loss of appetite following acute PDCoV infection in young suckling piglets (Langhans, 2000) . However, the potentially beneficial or detrimental effects or roles of these innate and pro-inflammatory cytokines in PDCoV-infected piglets need to be studied further.\n\nIn addition to LLC-PK or ST cells of swine origin which have been used for the isolation and propagation of PDCoV, our present study revealed that IPEC-J2 cells are also susceptible to infection with PDCoV. However, unlike LLC-PK or ST cells, PDCoV may not induce apoptosis in the infected IPEC-J2 cells, but possibly necrosis, similar to necrotic cell death in infected intestinal enterocytes in vivo. Based on these observations, a study of the mechanisms related to cell death caused by PDCoV in IPEC-J2 cells may be applicable to a more comprehensive understanding of cell death of infected enterocytes that occurs in vivo. Our findings also indicate the potential usefulness of IPEC-J2 cells: i) to better mimic in vivo conditions of PDCoV infection in the small intestine of pigs; ii) to study possible differences in the interactions of enterocytes with distinct swine enteric coronaviruses, PDCoV, PEDV, or TGEV; and iii) to investigate the virus-virus interactions between the viruses when co-infected in IPEC-J2 cells. Additionally, our study demonstrated that the IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV (OH-FD22-P8-I-P4) was enteropathogenic in Gn pigs, and that induction of systemic innate and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses occurred in Gn pigs during the acute PDCoV infection.\n\nNone of the authors of this paper have a financial or personal relationship with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence or bias the content of the paper."}
