It . https://doi.org/10.1101/112904 doi: bioRxiv preprint 3 Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV possesses a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome (gRNA) of 51 ~11 kb, which contains a long open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 \"untranslated\" 52 regions (UTRs) of approximately 100 and 400 nucleotides, respectively (Fig. 1A) . The ORF 53 encodes a polyprotein which is cleaved by host and viral proteases to yield three structural proteins 54 located in the N-terminal region (capsid -C, precursor/membrane -Pr/M, and envelope -E) and 55 seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) (6). Consequently, 56 these proteins are expected to be produced in equimolar amounts during infection, although the 57 former set are presumed to be required in higher quantities for the production of progeny virus 58 particles (7). Indeed, in the flavivirus lineage that includes West Nile virus, efficient ribosomal 59 frameshifting in the NS2A region diverts up to 50% of translating ribosomes into an overlapping 60 ORF, resulting in a substantial reduction in synthesis of the 3\u2032-encoded replicative proteins relative 61 to the 5\u2032-encoded structural proteins (8). A similar phenomenon is also seen in a group of insect-62 specific flaviviruses (9). 63 64\n\nWe utilized sequencing of ribosome protected fragments (RPFs), known as ribosome profiling 66 (Ribo-Seq), in combination with whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), to investigate 67 translation of the ZIKV genome at sub-codon resolution. African green monkey (Vero E6) cells 68\n\nand Aedes albopictus (C6/36) cells were infected with ZIKV Brazilian isolate PE243 (10). Cells 69 were harvested at 24 h post infection (p.i.) and Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared and 70 deep sequenced. The resulting reads were mapped to viral and host genomes (S1 Table) . Fig. 1B  71 illustrates Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq densities on the viral genome for infected Vero and C6/36 cells. 72\n\nLocalized variations in RPF density may be attributable partly to technical biases (ligation, PCR 73 and nuclease biases; 11) and partly to ribosomes pausing at specific sites during translation (Fig.  74 1B) (12). On a larger scale (Fig 2A) , we observed a gradual decline in mean RPF density in the 5\u2032 75 to 3\u2032 direction in Vero cell infections, but no evidence of a sharp reduction at any single location as 76 .

Similarly, no 77 evidence for ribosomal drop-off was observed in insect cells. Consistent with this, a survey of 78 ZIKV genomic sequences revealed few conserved ORFs of significant length in either of the two 79 alternative reading frames (Fig. 1C) , and no statistically significant evidence for overlapping 80 elements (e.g. ribosomal frameshift signals) embedded within the polyprotein coding sequence (cf. 81\n\nWest Nile virus; 13) except near the 5\u2032 end (Fig. 1D) . Note, however, that these comparative 82 analyses are restricted by the low sequence diversity available in the ZIKV clade. 83 84 Strikingly, we found significant ribosome occupancy within the ZIKV 5\u2032 UTR ( Fig. 2A) . The 85 length distribution of Ribo-Seq reads mapping to this region mirrored that of polyprotein-mapping 86\n\nRPFs, indicating that they are bona fide ribosome footprints (S1 Fig). A prominent peak of RPF 87 density occurred at nucleotide 25 of the 5\u2032 UTR in Vero cells, coinciding with a non-canonical 88 (CUG) initiation codon (Fig. 2B) . RPFs mapped in-frame along the length of the associated 29-89 codon upstream ORF (uORF1), which ends at nucleotide 111 (4th nucleotide of the polyprotein 90 ORF) (Fig. 2B-C) . Additionally, RPFs mapped in-frame to a second uORF (uORF2), associated 91 with a non-canonical (UUG) initiation codon at nucleotide 80 ( Fig. 2B-C) . This uORF2, 77 92 codons in length, extends 202 nucleotides into the polyprotein ORF, and is generally conserved 93 across ZIKV isolates ( Fig. 1C; Frame +2) . Both uORFs were also occupied by ribosomes during 94 infection of C6/36 cells, although uORF2 was more prominent in this case (Fig. 2B) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/112904 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5 uORFs are often non-functional (15). In some instances, ribosomes reinitiate at downstream AUG 103 codons after translating short uORFs (16); however this appears unlikely in ZIKV given that both 104 uORFs extend beyond the polyprotein AUG codon. Additional work in animal infection models is 105 required to assess the functional significance of these uORFs. 106 107 Few RPFs were present in the 3\u2032 UTR, consistent with a lack of translation of this region. In Vero 108 cell infections, 3\u2032 UTR RNA-Seq density was on average 68% higher than in the rest of the gRNA. (Fig. 2D) . This location is one nucleotide upstream of the predicted 5\u2032 end 116 of RNA \"stem-loop 2\" (SL2). In contrast, while Xrn1 halts preferentially at the adjacent SL1 in 117 ZIKV strain PRVABC59 (17), we found only a much more modest peak in read 5\u2032 end mappings 118 at the SL1 site (nucleotide position 10394).

Due to poor Ribo-Zero depletion of rRNA in the 155 C6/36 Ribo-Seq samples, additional aliquots of the two biological repeats were further treated with 156 duplex-specific nuclease (DSN; Evrogen) as described previously (21) The order of mapping was tested to check that host-derived reads were not accidentally mis-mapped 169 to the virus genome, or vice versa.
