{"title": "Steps to a Sustainable Public Health Surveillance Enterprise\u2028A\nCommentary from the International Society for Disease\nSurveillance", "body": "At a time when populations are changing and disease outbreaks and other events of\npublic health significance pose increasing risks to global health, economic\nstability, and national security, it is essential that, as a nation, we invest in\nthe systems needed to promote and protect the public\u2019s health.\n\nIn 2002, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reported that the public health system in\nthe United States had a multitude of deficiencies that impact the ability to\neffectively conduct public health surveillance. These included outdated and\nvulnerable technologies; a public health workforce lacking training and\nreinforcements; lack of real-time surveillance and epidemiological systems; and\nineffective and fragmented communications networks [1]. While considerable headway has been made since the IOM report was\npublished, there is still evidence of a need for further improvements. A recent\nreport by Trust for America\u2019s Health, for example, found that there are\npersistent gaps in the ability of state and local public health agencies to respond\nto events ranging from bioterrorist threats to natural disasters and disease\noutbreaks [2]. The question is\u2014how can\nwe reduce these gaps?\n\nNationwide and globally, rapid changes in health information systems, cloud computing\ntechnologies, communications, and global connections are catalyzing a re-examination\nof disease surveillance as an enterprise that needs coordinated and integrated\nsystem elements. Sustainable surveillance, which we define as ongoing data\ncollection, analysis, and application, coupled with a capability to respond to novel\ndemands, is needed to ensure that public health agencies can perform reliably\nregardless of shifts in public health funding and priorities. The ISDS Sustainable\nSurveillance Workgroup identified the following steps to maintain and advance the\npublic health surveillance enterprise:\n\nPublic health surveillance data is the foundation of public health programs and\nis required for a number of purposes, including: to demonstrate the size and\nimpact of the public health problem being addressed by a program; to identify\nthe population groups to which additional prevention efforts should be directed;\nto determine whether the problem is growing in size or abating; to provide\nfeedback to data providers; and as part of an overall program evaluation\nstrategy.\n\nThe significant health impacts and economic costs of disease outbreaks illustrate\nthe critical importance of effective public health surveillance and rapid\nresponse, as well as the cost of inaction [11]. Table 1 provides\nexamples of the health and financial burdens posed by some naturally occurring\nand intentional infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nThe values reported in Table 1 do not\nfully reflect additional indirect costs of diseases and their potentially\ncrippling effects on a community, nor do they address costs that are\nunderreported/ unreported due to lack of data. Higher rates of illness, for\nexample, can lead to lower worker productivity [11], while premature mortality can reduce the size of the labor\nforce, both of which have economic ramifications.\n\nThere is growing evidence that these economic and societal costs can be mitigated\nby surveillance systems that are stable; a stable system provides the best\nfoundation for identifying whether the problem being addressed is getting bigger\nor smaller or disproportionately affecting a section of the population, etc.,\nwhile still allowing flexibility to provide useful information quickly about\nemerging issues. The optimum mix of stability and flexibility will depend on the\npurpose(s) of surveillance and the particular health condition under\nsurveillance. For example, in the case of SARS, an effective surveillance system\nhas the potential to decrease the size of an epidemic by one-third and the\nduration by 4 weeks, with significant cost savings [25]. Another study found that the early detection of an\noutbreak of highly infectious bacterial meningitis saved approximately $2 for\nevery dollar invested in infectious disease surveillance [26]. Yet another evaluation of surveillance practice found\nthat technological improvements in a sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI)\nsurveillance system in Virginia saved over $9,500 (1,992 hours) in staff-time\nduring the 2007-2008 influenza seasons [27].\n\nOngoing surveillance can also inform the design and evaluation of prevention and\nintervention programs in order to control the escalating costs associated with\nchronic diseases in the U.S. and abroad [28]. Some experts forecast that chronic disease prevention programs\ncould save up to $48.9 billion per year by 2030 [29], while others predict applying electronic medical record\nimplementation and networking to the prevention and management of chronic\ndisease will exceed the currently projected $81 billion in annual savings [30].\n\nSiloed surveillance systems are outdated, inefficient, and incapable of meeting\ntoday\u2019s demands for electronic data exchange and for the informatics\ncapabilities needed to use the information for maximum benefit. Integrated\nprograms and collaboration, on the other hand, facilitate the efficient\nmanagement of the complex, varied, and proliferating issues and information\nsources that exist today. The nature of public health surveillance also lends\nitself to multiple-purpose approaches in that strategies for preventing and\ncontrolling diseases, such as West Nile virus, are to a great extent the same as\nfor an influenza epidemic, a foodborne disease outbreak, or a bioterrorist\nattack [31].\n\nTechnology that enhances communication and data sharing across disease programs,\nsurveillance systems, and even across jurisdictions increases the ease of\nobtaining and disseminating useful information to a broad audience, including\npublic health agencies, healthcare providers, policymakers, and the general\npublic [6,32]. This rapid information exchange not only facilitates timely\nresponse, but can also reduce emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and\neven costs of care [33]. However, many\nhealth departments currently have systems that are not flexible enough to\nrespond to changing health IT needs, which makes it difficult to deliver\ninformation when and where it is needed [4].\n\nDisease or program-specific funding also exacerbates program vulnerability to\nfunding and budgetary cuts. For example, when funding is earmarked for specific\npurposes (e.g., emergency preparedness and associated surveillance systems), and\nthen is reduced, such as has occurred for public health emergency preparedness\ncooperative agreement funding through CDC in the past seven years [34], it can undermine and reverse efforts\nto establish sustainable systems that serve multiple crosscutting purposes\nthroughout public health.\n\nBy contrast, an enterprise approach provides a cohesive framework that will\nbetter equip public health practitioners to address the challenges of processing\nlarge volumes of electronic data, and the concomitant analytical and\nvisualization requirements. Specifically, enterprise funding supports a\nreliable, flexible infrastructure that can adapt to technological and\ninformation requirement changes, and allows for ongoing data collection and the\nintegration of new data sources to advance all-hazard preparedness. A 2004 White\nHouse memo acknowledged how programmatic funding can lead to inefficiencies and\nredundancies in system acquisitions and usage and called for applying\ntechnological and human resources across programs [35].\n\nBy encouraging collaboration within and between departments, surveillance\nprofessionals can take advantage of shared platforms and resources to optimize\ndata collection, analysis, storage, and dissemination, thus helping to reduce\noperational costs and improve efficiency. For example, collaboration could\ncreate opportunities for the effective integration of syndromic and reportable\ndisease data for public health use [36].\n\nA lack of consistent and sustainable funding is hampering the necessary expansion\nand improvement of public health surveillance systems at local, state, and\nnational public health agencies. A 2010 survey of local health departments\nconducted by the National Association of City and County Health Officials\n(NACCHO) found that 72% of local health departments reported insufficient\nfunding as one of their major barriers to modernizing their IT systems [37].\n\nHealth data collection systems that take advantage of recent technological\nadvances have proven to be more cost effective and sustainable in the long-term\n[38]. Stable funding is essential to\nsupporting the adoption of hardware and software systems as they become\navailable, leading to a robust and sustainable public health surveillance\ninfrastructure able to integrate, manage, and communicate the plethora of data\nnecessary to generate actionable results [39].\n\nThe new age of disease surveillance requires a skilled public health workforce\nable to manage large volumes of increasingly complex electronic information, to\nunderstand the data flows, and to extract meaning from them. This calls for\nsophisticated and integrated competencies in public health informatics,\nepidemiology, statistics, and other areas, and the ability to present findings,\ndraw conclusions, and make recommendations based on surveillance data.\nFurthermore, in addition to needing people who can effectively operate existing\nsurveillance systems and carry out tasks (such as the onboarding process for\ncollecting newly available EHR data) there is also demand for people who can\nidentify and assess new opportunities for surveillance and design new systems\nthat take advantage of these opportunities [6].\n\nAttracting and retaining experts in these fields is especially challenging in\nlight of the comparatively low base salaries allotted to public health workers\ncompared to the salaries of technology-intensive positions in other sectors\n[40].\n\nTo align the surveillance workforce with new demands, the ISDS Sustainable\nSurveillance Workgroup suggests the following approaches:\n\nResearch and evaluation play an important role in connecting the processes of\ninformation collection, information use for decision-making, and translation of\ndecisions to actions and measurable outcomes. Research-based evidence and\nevaluation results can help to identify the limitations and benefits of\ndifferent surveillance procedures for better decision-making and more effective\nresource allocation. Investing in research and applying the rigors of science to\npublic health surveillance questions leads to informed decisions on how best to\ndirect efforts and resources.\n\nIn addition, periodic evaluations of surveillance infrastructures \u2013 the\nsystems and people\u2014are needed to assess return on investment and\nopportunities for quality improvement.\n\nEffective and efficient surveillance systems are proven to save money and lives. The\nability to detect and respond to known and emerging pathogens is central to\nprotecting and maintaining population health [41]. The breakdown or absence of a stable public health surveillance\ninfrastructure, on the other hand, can undermine efforts to mitigate disease\noutbreaks and other public health events [31]. Public health surveillance systems built on a strong infrastructure of\ncore workforce competencies, information systems, and organizational capacity [42], and supported by consistent and\nenterprise-based funding, are essential if we are to understand and respond to the\nreal and growing threats to population health. By providing political commitment and\nfinancial support to this issue, decision makers can play an active role in\nadvancing the health of individuals, communities, and nations."}
