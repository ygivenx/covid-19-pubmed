{"title": "Tegumentary leishmaniasis mimicking visceralization in a cirrhotic\npatient: atypical cutaneous lesions and local immunological\nfeatures", "body": "Diagnosing American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) is still a difficult task for\nphysicians, even for dermatologists and infectious diseases specialists\n1\n. Although the diagnosis can occasionally be only based on the\nclinical-epidemiological criteria, laboratory tests are also important. The lack of\na gold standard diagnostic tool prevents the establishment of ATL diagnosis\n2\n. This could be significantly harder in endemic co-prevalent regions\nexperiencing ATL and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) since immunological tests may\npresent cross-reactivity\n3\n.\n\nHere, we present a cirrhotic patient from an endemic Brazilian region for both ATL\nand VL\n4\n\n,\n\n5\n who presented with atypical cutaneous lesions, a usual clinico-laboratory\nfeature of VL (including positive results on rk39 test using a bone marrow sample),\nbut the patient was diagnosed with ATL on histopathological analysis; VL was ruled\nout by necropsy.\n\nIn May 2018, a 64-year-old man in S\u00e3o Paulo, Southeastern Brazil,\nwith a history of essential hypertension and hepatic cirrhosis due to chronic\nalcoholism (CHILD B, MELD 18), sought care for weight loss (from 97 kg to 65 kg),\nasthenia, and episodes of fever for 1 year. Six months earlier, he detected single\nskin lesions on his left leg (Figure 1A),\nfollowed by the appearance of another cutaneous lesion on his right leg (Figure 1B). Three months later, he observed\nmultiple lesions at the glabella, right nose alae, right dimple, and right perioral\nregion (Figure 1C).\n\nHe initially visited a dermatologic outpatient clinic. The leg lesion started as a\nsingle papule lesion evolving into a well-defined painless ulcer with elevated\nborders (Figure 1A and Figure 1B). Due to the symmetry of the lesions and the\nperipheral signs of venous chronic insufficiency, they were considered as venous\nstasis-related skin ulcers and were not biopsied. Conversely, face skin lesions were\ndescribed as papulonodular sarcoid-like infiltrated lesions (Figure 1C) being biopsied with the suspicion of\nsarcoidosis, secondary syphilis, and lepromatous leprosy. Physical examination also\nrevealed painless palpable liver and spleen. Blood samples and abdominal ultrasound\nwere requested with brief outpatient return.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June 2018, patient\u2019s laboratory results revealed pancytopenia (hemoglobin level,\n10.4 g/dL; leucocyte count, 3,210/mm3 [normal differential]; and platelet\ncount, 108,000/mm3), normal renal functions, hyponatremia (sodium level,\n127 meq/L), normal potassium level, normal transaminase level, elevated canalicular\nenzymes (alkaline phosphatase level, 135 g/dL; gamma-glutamyl transferase level, 128\ng/dL), elevated total bilirubin, 2.18 g/dL (direct bilirubin level, 1.51 g/dL),\nnormal lipase level, extended prothrombin time (international normalized ratio,\n1.58), hypoalbuminemia (albumin, 2.7 g/dL), and normal alpha-fetoprotein level (1.8\ng/dL). Serological test revealed negative results for anti-human immunodeficiency\nvirus and anti-hepatitis C virus, nonreactive Hepatitis B virus surface antigen\n(AgHBs) and antibody (anti-HBs), and reactive antibody to Hepatitis B virus core\nantigen (anti-HBc) (further polymerase chain reaction [PCR] for hepatitis B virus\nwas undetected);. Further, he was tested positive on treponemic test with Venereal\nDisease Research Laboratory test 1:2, indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) for\nleishmaniasis (1:80), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for leishmaniasis\n(>1:1,280). Ultrasound revealed signs of chronic liver disease with portal\nhypertension and a significant splenomegaly; no focal hepatic lesions were observed.\nThe histopathology of the facial cutaneous lesion revealed the following: (I) skin\nwith the epidermis presenting hyperparasqueratosis, focal hypogranulosis, irregular\nacanthosis, discrete spongiosis, and vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, (II)\ngranuloma formation, and (III) intense lymphohistiocytic infiltration with plasma\ncells and epithelioid histiocytes. Further tests, including immunohistochemistry,\nwere ongoing at that time.\n\nFifteen days before the outpatient return, he observed multiple painful bullous\nlesions in the left dorsothoracic region (Figure\n1E), and he initially received (in external service) acyclovir for herpes\nzoster diagnosis. When examined, the patient still had active disseminated bullous\nlesions in more than one dermatome; hence, an isolated ward was requested. Regarding\nthe patient\u2019s epidemiology, coming from Ara\u00e7atuba (western S\u00e3o\nPaulo State, Southeastern Brazil), an endemic region for VL with\nintense transmission of canine and human cases, and with the patient presenting with\nweight loss, fever, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated titers of\nleishmaniasis in serological test, the diagnosis of VL was suspected.\n\nConsidering the suspicion for VL, a bone marrow sample was collected. Global\nhypocellularity, appropriate cell maturation with normal morphology, and absence of\nmicroorganism or foreign bodies were observed. Bacterioscopy and bacterial/fungi\ncultures were negative. The rk39 test was positive, and the VL case was reported to\nthe surveillance. After normal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, 3 mg per\nkilogram of amphotericin B liposomal (200 mg per day) was initiated.\n\nUnfortunately, during the 9th day of treatment, the patient presented with severe\nacute respiratory syndrome, refractive shock, and multi-organ failure, resulting to\ndeath. Necropsy revealed several hemorrhagic spots in various organs consistent with\nacute hepatic failure, including an extensive alveolar hemorrhage. Regarding VL\ndiagnosis, histopathological analysis of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow did not\nreveal any histological pattern suggestive of VL, amastigote forms were not\nobserved, and immunohistochemistry for leishmaniasis was negative.\n\nA skin sample of the facial lesions, collected in May 2018, was reanalyzed by a\nleishmaniasis specialist, which confirmed the presence of amastigote and positive\nimmunohistochemistry for leishmaniasis (Figure\n2A and Figure 2B). Immunological\nlocal analysis revealed a deficient innate response without the presence of\ncomplement (C3=+0/+3) and weak presence of natural killer cells (anti-CD57=+1/+3).\nMacrophages and dendritic cells were widely distributed in the skin sample\n(anti-cluster of differentiation [CD] 68 and anti-S100=+3/+3) (Figure 3A and Figure 3B),\nbut with an inappropriate cytokine production (antitumor necrosis factor (TNF]\n\u03b1=+2/+3, anti-interleukin [IL] \u00df, anti-IL6, and anti-IL8=+1/+3). A suitable adaptive\nresponse was observed (anti-CD4 and anti-CD8=+3/+3) (Figure 3C and Figure 3D) modulated\nto the Th1 pole (anti-interferon \u03b3 and anti-TGF \u00df=+3/+3) (Figure 3E and Figure 3F).\nThe regulatory response was defective with low display of cytokines (anti-CD20,\nanti-IL17, anti-IL10, and anti-IL4=+1/+3). Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction\nwas performed from the biopsy sample, followed by leishmania kDNA detection by PCR;\nhowever, the identification of the Leishmania sp. (paraffin tissue\nsample with poor-quality DNA extraction) was not possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis case report offers some interesting and controversial data: (a) an unusual\nclinical feature of ATL with atypical infiltrated sarcoid-like\npapules in the facial region following a lymphatic trajectory (Figure 1D) from the glabella to the right perioral region. We\ncannot consider the leg ulcers as the primary local ATL infection since they were\nnot biopsied and they were initially considered as vascular stasis-related lesions,\nemphasizing the difficulty in diagnosing ATL, even for experienced specialists\n1\n. (b) Immunological local features indicated a deficiency in innate response,\nbut a strong Th1 response with an intense pro-inflammatory activity. Furthermore,\nthe lack of regulatory response leads to severe local damage, which explains the\natypical skin lesion. Regulation deficiency may be explained not only by the\nimmunosuppressed patient conditions (chronic hepatopathy) but also by\nLeishmania sp. local immunomodulation\n6\n\n,\n\n7\n. On the contrary, parasite exposure and a deficient cellular activity lead\nto an intense humoral response with high titers of anti-Leishmania circulating\nantibodies, confirmed by great titers of IFI and ELISA. (c) Following the Brazilian\nMinistry of Health VL guidelines\n4\n, this patient met the criteria to confirm the diagnosis of VL; however, with\nthe patient\u2019s comorbidities (cirrhosis with portal hypertension) and ATL, the\nclinico-laboratory interpretation was significantly harder. Moreover, rK39\nfalse-positive test supported the misdiagnosis, ruling out postmortem VL. The rK39\ntest is a valuable tool for VL diagnosis\n8\n, showing a good accuracy depending on the test brand and the global region\nused\n9\n. However, some rK39 rapid test brand had shown excellent performance in the\nblood from Brazilian patients\n10\n; its results should be carefully analyzed in co-prevalent regions with ATL\ndue to an eventual cross-reactivity\n3\n, as observed here, even in bone marrow samples. Regarding surveillance, VL\nnotification had to be removed. (d) Otherwise, considering the patient\u2019s\nimmunosuppression and the high incidence of VL in Southeastern Brazil, these\natypical lesions may also be explained due to the cutaneous involvement by\nviscerotropic Leishmania strains\n11\n.\n\nPhysicians working in co-prevalent areas experiencing ATL and VL should be aware of\nthe atypical features, unusual clinical course, and unexpected laboratory findings\nof leishmaniasis, determining the possibility of leishmaniasis coinfection and/or\ncross-reactivity among diagnostic exams. Additionally, patients\u2019 comorbidities\nattributing to VL findings mimicking baseline pathologies should be carefully\nstudied."}
