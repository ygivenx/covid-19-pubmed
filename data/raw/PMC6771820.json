The ribosome, a macromolecular machine that synthesizes proteins in all cells, controls accurate decoding of mRNA triplets by the respective aminoacyl\u2010tRNAs (aa\u2010tRNAs) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Stringent tRNA selection mechanisms ensure a very low overall error rate of mRNA decoding in the range of 10\u22127 to 10\u22125\n7. Each time an amino acid is incorporated into the growing peptide chain, the ribosome moves by one codon along the mRNA to read the next codon. Keeping the codon\u2010wise step of translation is even more essential than preventing missense errors, because slippage by one or two nucleotides results in a completely altered sequence of the synthesized peptide. In fact, spontaneous frameshifting errors are rather infrequent, <10\u22125 per codon 8. However, in some cases, this rigorous reading frame control is abrogated allowing the ribosome to recode genetic information in response to specific stimulatory signals embedded in the mRNA sequence or structure 9, 10. Programmed ribosome frameshifting (PRF) is a recoding event that allows to produce multiple proteins from the same mRNA by shifting the reading frame in the forward (+PRF) or backward (\u2013PRF) direction 9, 10, 11, 12. Slippage occurs typically by 1 nucleotide, although 2\u2010, 4\u2010, 5\u2010, and 6\u2010nucleotide shifts were also reported 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. \u20131PRF is found in all kingdoms of life including higher eukaryotes, but is particularly prevalent in viruses and mobile genetic elements 9, 10, 18. The biological significance of PRF is to increase the genome\u2010coding capacity, to control the stoichiometric ratio between proteins and to regulate gene expression by influencing mRNA stability 9, 10. Many human pathogenic viruses require frameshifting for their viability, because it ensures production of certain viral enzymes that are not encoded in the 0\u2010frame and modulates the ratio between viral structural proteins necessary for virion assembly 18, 19, 20, 21. Among the viral proteins produced upon \u20131PRF, many contribute to viral infectivity either directly by evading the host antiviral response 22 or indirectly by hindering viral particle formation and release, thereby decreasing viral titer 20, 23.\n\nIn this review, we summarize the recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of \u20131PRF, including the different routes of \u20131PRF and the mechanisms leading to alternative reading frames, for example, +1 and \u20132 frameshifting, which we call alternative slippages. In addition to two well\u2010studied cases of \u20131PRF in avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and bacterial dnaX, we focus on examples of \u20131PRF from two phylogenetically distant human viruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV\u20101), and Semliki Forest virus (SFV). We show how tRNA abundance can modulate the routes and efficiency of \u2013PRF and discuss how different routes and additional slippery sites result in robust \u20131PRF which is needed for virus life cycle.\n\nTypically, \u20131PRF is governed by two cis\u2010acting elements\u2014a slippery site (SS) and a downstream mRNA secondary structure (Fig. 1). The SS is a repetitive heptanucleotide sequence of the type X1 XXY4 YYZ7, which allows the two tRNAs that read the 0\u2010frame codons XXY and YYZ to re\u2010pair with their XXX and YYY codons after the slippage into the \u20131\u2010frame 24. The mRNA secondary structure\u2014a stem\u2010loop (SL) or a pseudoknot (PK) or a kissing loop 25, 26, 27, 28\u2014acts as a roadblock to hinder translocation and thereby promote frameshifting 29, 30. In addition, Shine\u2013Dalgarno\u2010like (SD\u2010like) sequences in bacteria 31, trans\u2010acting proteins in viruses 32, 33, 34, 35, G\u2010quadruplexes 36, 37 and miRNAs in mammalian cells 32 can modulate the \u20131PRF efficiency.\n\nIn most cases, the structure of the downstream mRNA secondary structure is known from bioinformatics, chemical probing, mutagenesis, or structural studies. For example, the PK at the frameshifting site of IBV was discovered based on mutational analysis and its structure predicted by bioinformatics (Fig. 1A), whereas the atomic structure of this PK is still lacking 28, 38. The structure of the SL in bacterial dnaX was initially suggested based on mutational analysis and structural probing 39; recent cryo\u2010EM studies determined the structure of this SL bound to the bacterial ribosome (Fig. 1A) 40. The SL structure of HIV\u20101 is one of the best\u2010studied examples of mRNA secondary structures that modulate \u20131PRF. Its structure was solved using mutagenesis and enzymatic probing 41, thermodynamic and NMR analysis 28, 42, 43, as well as toeprinting and chemical probing in the presence of the bacterial ribosome (Fig. 1A) 44.\n\nThe secondary structure element of SFV was predicted to be an extended SL by bioinformatics and mutational analysis 27. We validated the structure by chemical probing, which can distinguish single\u2010 and double\u2010stranded RNA regions by their accessibility to chemical modification (Fig. 1B). The chemicals were chosen such as to modify the Watson\u2013Crick positions of the nucleotide base; double\u2010stranded regions are protected from chemical modifications due to base pairing to the complementary strand. Modification causes a stop in the progression of the reverse transcriptase (RT) resulting in the production of short cDNA fragments, which can be then visualized by sequencing (Fig. 1B). In agreement with the bioinformatics predictions 27, the SL element in SFV contains a long lower stem encompassing nucleotides 15\u201326 after the SS (counting from nucleotide 1 of the SS), as seen from the lack of chemical modifications of this region (Fig. 1B,C). Nucleotides 28\u201329 form a small unstructured loop between the lower and upper stems, consistent with their accessibility to modifications. According to the bioinformatics analysis, C27 also belongs to this loop; however, its modification status is unclear. The upper stem was predicted to span nucleotides 30\u201335; however, our results suggest that also the adjacent nucleotides 36\u201339 are protected from modifications and thus might belong to the upper stem, although the accessibility of the complementary strand nucleotides (nucleotides 64\u201368) is unclear (Fig. 1C). The upper stem is closed by a large bulge spanning nucleotides 40\u201348, as predicted by the bioinformatics analysis and supported by the chemical probing data. Nucleotides 49\u201352 are predicted to form a small stem, but appear to be in a single\u2010stranded region according to chemical probing. According to the bioinformatics analysis, C54 is base paired to G61, suggesting that both should be inaccessible to chemical modification. This is, however, not the case: C54 is indeed inaccessible, but G61 is modified. In addition, when G61 is mutated to C61, it becomes protected, suggesting that the interaction pattern is more complex than predicted. Finally, we confirm the presence of the predicted AGUAAU loop closing the upper stem (Fig. 1C). Hence, chemical probing largely supports the structure of the SFV SL predicted by the bioinformatics analysis 27. The major differences concern the length of the upper stem, which appears to include nucleotides 36\u201339 based on chemical probing, and the absence of the predicted small stem spanning nucleotides 49\u201352. As expected, the SS sequence is single\u2010stranded. Nucleotides between the SS and the SL (nucleotides 8\u201314) show a very high degree of modification indicating that they do not belong to the SL but represent a single\u2010stranded spacer between the two frameshifting elements, as predicted 27. Binding of the ribosome to the start codon (initiation complex, IC) does not affect the mRNA structure, most likely because the ribosome binds to the mRNA region distal from the SL (Fig. 1B,C). Nucleotides C14, A53, A55 show different reactivity in the IC than in the free wt mRNA (Fig. 1B,C), however, this effect is most likely caused by the mutations in the test mRNA sequence introduced to ensure translation initiation in E. coli, rather than by the presence of the ribosome.\n\n\u20131PRF takes place during the elongation phase of translation, but due to a lack of kinetic data, the exact timing of \u20131PRF was until recently unknown. This led to the proposal of a number of different models that differ in the timing of the \u20131PRF during the elongation cycle, for example, some models predicted that \u20131PRF occurs during aa\u2010tRNA accommodation in the A site of the ribosome (integrated & 9 \u00c5 models), before peptidyl transfer (simultaneous slippage model), during hybrid state formation in translocation (dynamic model), in the post\u2010translocation state of the ribosome (mechanical model) or during the next round of elongation requiring three\u2010tRNA slippage (three\u2010tRNA model) (summarized in 12). The lack of a unifying model has prompted several groups to investigate \u20131PRF by ensemble kinetics or single molecule methods 14, 15, 29, 30, 45, 46. Compared to results obtained previously with cellular lysates (e.g., rabbit reticulocyte lysate), the in vitro assays used in these experiments have the advantage of providing a fully controlled environment where every elemental step of translation elongation can be dissected. Results for two unrelated frameshifting examples, gene 1a/1b of IBV 29 and dnaX of E. coli\n14, 15, 30 suggested that \u20131PRF occurred predominantly during the tRNA translocation step and provided no support for any of the other models listed above. In the following we will discuss the current kinetic models of frameshifting.\n\nThe frameshifting motif of IBV gene 1a/1b consists of a SS motif U1 UUA4 AAG7 encoding Leu (UUA) and Lys (AAG) in 0\u2010frame, and a PK positioned 6 nucleotides downstream of the SS (Fig. 1A) 38. Comparison of the ensemble kinetics 29 and single molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) 47, 48 results with the structural intermediates of translocation 49, 50, 51 suggests that frameshifting occurs when the 3\u2032 ends of the P\u2010 and A\u2010site tRNAs have moved to the E and P site, respectively, on the large ribosomal subunit (LSU), but the tRNA anticodon domains are not yet fully translocated on the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) 29, 30, 46, 52, that is, frameshifting occurs when two tRNAs are bound to the ribosome. Because the ribosome adopts a conformation in which the SSU head domain swivels relatively to the body domain, the tRNA anticodons are placed in an intermediate position with respect to the SSU head and body domains 49, 52, 53. In this so\u2010called chimeric (with respect to SSU) hybrid (to LSU) state, the codon\u2013anticodon interaction is destabilized, which favors frameshifting 54. The PK structure in the mRNA downstream of the SS impedes the closing movement of the 30S SSU head domain, which, in turn, hinders the release of the deacylated tRNA from the E site and the completion of translocation 29, 45. The presence of the mRNA secondary structure element leads to translational pausing and opens a kinetic window in which tRNAs can slip into a different reading frame. Notably, \u20131PRF appears favorable for translation because the ribosomes that shifted into the \u20131\u2010frame complete translocation and release EF\u2010G faster than those remaining in 0\u2010frame 29. Hence, \u20131PRF could be considered as a rescue mechanism to resolve a persistent translational block caused by a secondary structure and resume translation at its normal rate.\n\nAnother well\u2010studied example of \u20131PRF is on the dnaX mRNA of E. coli. The slippery site contains the SS motif A1 AAA4 AAG7 encoding two Lys (AAA and AAG) in 0\u2010frame, the downstream SL and an SD\u2010like sequence upstream of the SS (Fig. 1A) 39, 55, 56. Here \u20131PRF proceeds via two alternative routes, one of which is identical to that described for IBV 1a/1b, whereas the other is activated by aa\u2010tRNA limitation 15. \u20131PRF was studied on an dnaX model mRNA in detail using smFRET, mass spectrometry and rapid ensemble kinetics 14, 15, 30, 46. smFRET and ensemble kinetics show that the presence of the downstream SL hinders translocation, whereas the rates of A\u2010site tRNA delivery and peptidyl\u2010transfer are unchanged 15, 30, 45. The presence of the downstream SL in the dnaX mRNA also hinders the E\u2010site tRNA release 30, 45, as was shown with the PK of IBV 29. While pausing at the SL, ribosomes undergo multiple conformational transitions between classical and hybrid states in the presence of EF\u2010G 30, 46. EF\u2010G may take multiple attempts to complete translocation while the ribosome tries to resolve the secondary structure to continue canonical decoding in 0\u2010frame 14, 46, 57. This prevalent translocation\u2010dependent route, which corresponds to the two\u2010tRNA slippage mechanism suggested earlier 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, is similar in IBV 1a/1b and E. coli dnaX.\n\nAnother pathway for frameshifting on dnaX was found to be operational when the A site remains vacant due to the absence of the cognate aa\u2010tRNA. In this case, delayed decoding eventually allows slippage of the single P\u2010site tRNA. Once the ribosome encounters a codon for which an aa\u2010tRNA is available, normal translation resumes. Compared to translocation\u2010dependent \u20131PRF, this so\u2010called \u2018hungry\u2019 or one\u2010tRNA frameshifting is very slow and does not require the presence of the downstream mRNA secondary structure 14, 15. Also, smFRET experiments suggest the presence of two branch points determining the reading frame: one during translocation, as described 15, 30 and one during tRNALys sampling in the A site 46. Mass spectrometry and optical tweezers data suggest that during translocation the ribosome attempts multiple trajectories or excursions along the mRNA and that the slippage into the new frame might occur from different 0\u2010frame codons 14. Many frameshift attempts fail due to codon\u2013anticodon base pair mismatches in the alternative frame leading to the accumulation of incomplete peptides 14. This scenario explains many cases of alternative frameshifting events at conditions of in vitro translation, for example, \u22124 and +2 frameshifting and decoding\u2010related frameshifting observed on dnaX\n14, 46 and may explain the heterogeneity of frameshifting products observed in previous in vivo studies 63, 64. The \u2018hungry\u2019 frameshifting also relates to a common mechanism for how frameshift suppressor tRNAs can rescue mRNA frameshift mutants by a \u20131 frameshift 65. For example, a translation defect caused by an G insertion in the mRNA resulting in a sequence \u2010GGG\u2010GAA\u2010AGA\u2010 can be rescued by loss\u2010of\u2010function mutations in tRNAArg reading the AGA codon. The delay in decoding allows tRNAGlu bound at the P\u2010site GAA codon to slip into the \u20131\u2010frame, which restores translation in 0\u2010frame 66.\n\nGiven that \u20131PRF in IBV 1a/1b and E. coli dnaX proceeds via the same translocation\u2010dependent two\u2010tRNA slippage, the question arises whether the same mechanism is utilized in other cases as well or if any of the earlier proposed mechanisms can be identified. One of the most widely known cases of \u20131PRF is the gag\u2010pol overlap in HIV\u20101, which prompted us to study the mechanism of \u20131PRF in this system. In addition, we studied \u20131PRF in SFV, a virus phylogenetically distant from HIV\u20101, which has the same slippery site sequence as HIV\u20101 with a remarkable degree of conservation in different virus subtypes 20. In the following section we will describe the mechanism of \u20131PRF on these two mRNAs.\n\n\u20131PRF in HIV\u20101 takes place at the gag\u2010pol gene overlap and defines the ratio between the structural proteins of the capsid (Gag, 0\u2010frame) and the viral enzymes (Gag\u2010Pol, \u20131\u2010frame). Changes in the frameshift efficiency impede viral particle formation and are detrimental for viral viability and infectivity 21, 67. Notably, \u20131PRF on the gag\u2010pol mRNA results in two different \u20131\u2010frame products in addition to the 0\u2010frame peptide. Although numerous models were proposed to explain \u20131PRF in HIV\u20101 21, 59, 61, 62, 68, the origin and biological significance of the two frameshifting products remained unknown, which prompted us to dissect the frameshifting event on the gag\u2010pol mRNA using our in vitro reconstituted translation system with either mammalian or bacterial components 69. The reported efficiency of gag\u2010pol \u20131PRF is about 10%, as measured with dual\u2010luciferase reporters in vivo in human cell culture 70, 71. We note that this frameshifting efficiency has been recapitulated in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells in vivo and in the respective in vitro translation systems, suggesting that \u20131PRF relies on the highly conserved components of the translational apparatus 21, 68, 72. The frameshifting motif of HIV\u20101 consists of a main SS, SS1, with a sequence of U1 UUU4 UUA7 encoding Phe (UUU) and Leu (UUA) in 0\u2010frame with a downstream SL element (Figs 1A and 2) 21, 43. Of the two distinct frameshifting products, one contains the 0\u2010frame peptide Phe\u2010Leu followed by the \u20131\u2010frame amino acid sequence (FLR) and the other one a Phe incorporated instead of Leu, that is, Phe\u2010Phe followed by the \u20131\u2010frame sequence (FFR) (Fig. 2). The ratio of the two \u20131PRF products is about 70% to 30% 21, 61, 62, 64.\n\nKinetic analysis shows that \u20131PRF in HIV\u20101 proceeds via the same two routes as previously described for IBV 1a/1b and E. coli dnaX mRNAs (Fig. 2) 69. Intriguingly, we found that the two routes depend on the availability of Leu\u2010tRNALeu(UAA) to read the UUA codon of the SS1 (Fig. 2) 69. At limited supply of Leu\u2010tRNALeu(UAA) decoding is slow. While the ribosome waits for the tRNA delivery, the P\u2010site peptidyl\u2010tRNAPhe bound to the UUU codon slips backwards and re\u2010pairs with another UUU codon in \u20131 frame, resulting in the change of the identity of the A\u2010site codon from UUA to UUU and the incorporation of the second Phe into the peptide, which gives rise to the FFR \u20131\u2010frame product (consistent with earlier suggestions 59, 61, 64, 68) (Fig. 2). At low Leu\u2010tRNALeu(UAA) concentrations, the rate of Leu incorporation is lower than that of P\u2010site tRNAPhe slippage; hence, the one\u2010tRNA slippage and the respective FFR route prevail. With increasing Leu\u2010tRNALeu(UAA) concentration, its incorporation rate increases, which abolishes the FFR route and favors the two\u2010tRNA slippage resulting in FLR pathway of frameshifting (Fig. 2). Along with kinetic data 69, one of the main arguments supporting this finding is the lack of competition between tRNAGly (0\u2010frame) and tRNAArg (\u20131\u2010frame) reading the codon GGG (or AGG in \u20131\u2010frame) following the SS1 69. This observation indicates that the commitment to \u20131\u2010frame happens upon Leu incorporation but prior to the next codon decoding.\n\nAnother example of viral frameshifting is found in gene 6K of the alphavirus SFV. Here \u20131PRF defines the ratio between two structural proteins, 6K (0\u2010frame) and TransFrame (TF, \u20131\u2010frame), which play a role in the envelope protein processing, membrane permeabilization, virion assembly, virus budding, and contribute to infectivity 20. The efficiency of \u20131PRF in SFV measured with dual\u2010luciferase reporters in human cells is about 15% 27. Having probed the mRNA secondary structure element on the 6K mRNA (Fig. 1B,C), we studied the mechanism of \u20131PRF as described for IBV, dnaX, and HIV\u20101. Because SFV and HIV\u20101 have the same SS sequence U1 UUU4 UUA7, we hypothesized that \u20131PRF in SFV also results in two peptides, in this case FFS and FLS, depending on the presence of the Leu\u2010tRNALeu(UAA) isoacceptor (Fig. 3A). In the absence of Leu\u2010tRNALeu(UAA), the FFS product is formed and its yield depends on the concentration of Phe\u2010tRNAPhe (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the slippage occurs prior to and independent of tRNALeu(UAA) incorporation, similarly to \u2018hungry\u2019 slippage in HIV\u20101. With the increase in Leu\u2010tRNALeu(UAA) concentration, the \u20131PRF efficiency decreases dramatically from about 70% in the absence of tRNALeu(UAA) to 18% at tRNALeu(UAA) saturation (Fig. 3C). Thus, the FFS route in SFV is operational when tRNALeu(UAA) is absent or in limited supply, whereas under saturating translation conditions the FLS route becomes prevalent. To better understand the FLS regime, we tested the competition between 0\u2010frame Val\u2010tRNAVal and \u20131\u2010frame Ser\u2010tRNASer for binding at the codon following the SS, GUG. Titration of these tRNAs in the presence of equimolar amounts of tRNALeu(UAA) (1:1 molar ratio to 70S) does not change the frameshifting efficiency appreciably (Fig. 3D), which suggests that, similarly to HIV\u20101, FLS products result from the dual slippage of the SS tRNAs tRNAPhe and tRNALeu(UAA) in the late stage of translocation before the GUG codon is presented in the A site.\n\nAs described above, the Leu\u2010tRNALeu isoacceptor reading the UUA codon of the SS in HIV\u20101 and SFV acts as the main modulator of the \u20131PRF efficiency and defines the frameshifting route in these two viruses. Interestingly, the UUA codon along with other A\u2010ending codons is rare in humans, but accounts for more than 45% of all Leu\u2010coding codons in late\u2010expressing genes of HIV\u20101 including gag and pol\n73, 74. Leu\u2010tRNALeu(UAA) is dramatically underrepresented in CD4+ T\u2010lymphocytes, the primary target cells for HIV\u20101 infection in humans, that is, it is 20\u2010fold less abundant than the major Leu isoacceptor Leu\u2010tRNALeu(CAG)\n69. The high demand for Leu\u2010tRNALeu(UAA) to achieve efficient gag and gag\u2010pol translation may additionally deplete the pool of free Leu\u2010tRNALeu(UAA) in the cell, thus further decreasing its availability for decoding at the gag\u2010pol frameshifting site. Furthermore, tRNA levels are known to fluctuate in response to interferon activation and to changes in gene expression triggered by viral infection 75, 76. In light of these observations, FFR and FLR \u20131\u2010frame products resulting from two different routes in HIV\u20101 may represent an adaptation strategy of the virus to the changing availability of the crucial Leu\u2010tRNALeu(UAA). When the concentration of tRNALeu(UAA) decreases, the ribosome switches to the FFR route leading to robust \u20131PRF, thereby maintaining a stationary frameshifting level independent of small tRNALeu(UAA) fluctuations that are realistic in vivo. We also note that unlike in dnaX, where the \u2018hungry\u2019 frameshifting pathway is activated only under starvation conditions, HIV\u20101 can use both \u2018hungry\u2019 (FFR) and translocation\u2010dependent (FLR) pathways constitutively to achieve a constant \u20131PRF efficiency. Unlike HIV\u20101, SFV primarily infects neuronal cells (neurons and oligodendrocytes) 77, in which the level of tRNALeu(UAA) is not known; thus the physiological relevance of the two potential \u20131PRF pathways in SFV remains to be elucidated.\n\nGiven the low level of tRNALeu(UAA) in human T\u2010lymphocytes, the question remains how HIV\u20101 can satisfy its high demand for this tRNA to achieve an efficient translation of its late\u2010expressing genes. HIV\u20101 can package some cellular tRNAs, among them tRNALys, tRNAIle and to a lesser extent tRNALeu(UAA), during virion assembly 78. Because tRNA packaging happens passively governed by the concentration gradient, these tRNAs must be present in the cell at significant concentrations. There are multiple indirect indications that HIV\u20101 itself can affect the tRNA pools by yet unknown mechanisms 74 and that HIV infection can change the cellular localization of individual aa\u2010tRNA synthetases from the multi\u2010aa\u2010tRNA synthetase complex 79, which may affect their aminoacylation activity. Other viruses whose genomes have a codon usage different from their host can alter the free tRNA pools by changing polysome\u2010associated tRNA levels (vaccinia and influenza A) or by tRNA misacylation (influenza A and adenovirus) 76, 80, but the mechanism of how HIV\u20101 could modulate tRNA concentrations remains unknown.\n\nAlong with HIV\u20101 and SFV, \u20131PRF in the extended CAG repeats in the human huntingtin mRNA is also modulated by the availability of the aa\u2010tRNA 81. Expansion of CAG\u2010encoded poly\u2010glutamine (polyQ) stretches beyond a certain threshold leads to the development of progressive neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia 82. Translation of the extended CAG repeats results in the depletion of tRNAGln(CUG) which recognizes the CAG codon. The depletion of the pool of free tRNA, in turn, causes \u20131PRF, the efficiency of which depends on the length of polyQ stretches 81. Here \u20131PRF likely proceeds via the one\u2010 tRNA (or \u2018hungry\u2019) slippage mechanism, as discussed above for dnaX, HIV\u20101 gag\u2010pol (FFR) and SFV 6K (FFS). Interestingly, tRNAGln(CUG) shows tissue\u2010specific expression levels in humans, and the lowest concentration of this tRNA was detected in the brain region called striatum, which is the primary site for Huntington's disease 81. In summary, the low level of the target tRNA is linked to the increased frameshifting levels and accumulation of the mutated huntingtin protein, thereby contributing to the disease severity in Huntington's patients.\n\nThe strong inhibition of \u20131PRF in HIV\u20101 by excess amounts of tRNALeu(UAA) offers a potential new approach in antiviral therapy. Based on codon usage differences between retroviruses and the human host, multiple tRNA species were predicted that are critical for retroviral protein synthesis but dispensable for human translation, laying the foundation for the hypothetical tRNA Inhibition Therapy (TRIT) 83. Inactivation of these tRNAs should drastically reduce the elongation rate of viral protein synthesis leaving the host translation unaffected. One of the best targets of TRIT, which could be exploited in HIV\u20101 and other retroviruses (HIV\u20102, HTLV\u20101 and 2), is tRNALeu(UAG) reading the CUA Leu codon 83. Furthermore, interferon\u2010induced protein Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) was shown to selectively inhibit the expression of late HIV\u20101 proteins in a codon\u2010dependent manner 84. SLFN11 induces a selective cleavage of tRNAs with a long variable loop, such as tRNASer and tRNALeu\n85. Because HIV\u20101 gag\u2010pol mRNA harbors multiple UUA codons, its translation is susceptible to the action of SLFN11 overexpression due to the tRNALeu(UAA) depletion 85. Recently, another interferon\u2010induced protein, Shiftless, was shown to dysregulate \u20131PRF and inhibit replication of HIV\u20101 35. However, its potential use in antiviral therapy remains unclear because Shiftless binds to the ribosome and frameshifting sequences of many viral and even human cellular mRNAs 35.\n\nFrameshifting events are not limited to \u22121\u2010 and +1\u2010slipagges: ribosomes can slip by \u22122, +2, +4, +5, or +6 nucleotides 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. For example, the SS of dnaX in E. coli supports not only \u20131PRF, but also \u22122, +2, and even +4 frameshifting 14, 15. In dsDNA tailed phages, the tail assembly is typically regulated by a highly conserved \u20131PRF event; however, in Mu phage a \u22122 slippage is required instead 86. The synthesis of the full\u2010length human antizyme requires +1PRF, which can proceed via +1PRF (predominant) and \u20132PRF in fission yeast, but results from \u20132PRF in budding yeast; here \u20132PRF occurs via a one\u2010tRNA slippage in the presence of the empty A site, as described for \u2018hungry\u2019 \u20131PRF 17. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus utilizes both \u20131 and \u20132 slippage on the same SS G1 GUU4 UUU7 to produce different replicase polyproteins 87. This is the only described example of \u20132PRF where the \u20132 slippage requires the presence of a special mRNA stimulatory sequence downstream of the SS, similar to enhancers known to regulate +1PRF 87, 88. We note that a small amount of +1 and \u22122 products in HIV\u20101 may also result from the transcriptional slippage of RNA polymerase on the gag\u2010pol SS1 89.\n\nThe SS1 of HIV\u20101 was also reported to support \u20132PRF 16. Because in those experiments, the frameshifting sequence was placed into an unnatural context followed by an antisense oligonucleotide\u2010binding site, we were prompted to study the extent of alternative slippages on the native gag\u2010pol mRNA frameshifting site 69. HIV\u20101 gag\u2010pol SS1 indeed allows \u20132 and even +1 slippage, but their contribution to the overall frameshifting efficiency becomes significant only when certain aa\u2010tRNAs are omitted. Thus, alternative slippages on SS1 must follow the \u2018hungry\u2019 route of frameshifting.\n\nIn HIV\u20101, ribosomes that continue translation in the +1\u2010 or \u20132\u2010frame, soon encounter one of the multiple downstream stop codons, which leads to premature termination. Premature termination is often used upon slippage on nonprogrammed tetra\u2010 and heptanucleotide slippery sites to abort production of nonfunctional peptides, especially under conditions of aa\u2010tRNA limitation 90. Premature termination upon frameshifting can also result in the production of functional proteins. One example is E. coli gene copA encoding a copper ion transporter 91. Here \u20131PRF causes premature termination and formation of a truncated peptide CopA(Z), which turned out to be a copper chaperone protecting cells from excessive copper concentrations in the environment 91. On the other hand, premature termination upon \u20131PRF in human CCR5 mRNA leads to mRNA degradation by the nonsense\u2010mediated decay pathway, thus, regulating mRNA stability and gene expression 32.\n\nA hallmark of HIV\u20101 is its vast genetic diversity and rapid evolution, in particular in response to antiviral therapies. Some of the most potent antiviral drugs target the protease that cleaves the Gag\u2010Pol polyprotein to yield mature functional viral proteins 92, 93. One of the Gag protease cleavage sites, p1/p6, is located in the part of the protein encoded by the UUU\u2010CUU codons in pSS2 downstream of SS1; the cleavage is between Phe and Leu 94, 95. In response to antiviral treatment with protease inhibitors, the protease gene of HIV\u20101 accumulates mutations that reduce the affinity of the protease for the inhibitor, but simultaneously impair the recognition of its canonical cleavage sites 92, 94, 95. This defect is partially rescued by a compensatory mutation of the CUU to the UUU in pSS2, because the resulting Leu to Phe substitution creates a new functional cleavage site by enhancing van der Waals interactions between the substrate and the mutant protease, thereby allowing Gag\u2010Pol processing 96. The mutation also turns the U1 UUU4 CUU7 sequence into U1 UUU4 UUU7, which can support ribosome slippage (Fig. 1A) 97, 98, 99, 100, 101. The mutated slippery pSS2 supports both \u20131 and \u20132 slippage, but its contribution to the overall frameshifting efficiency depends on the availability of SS1 (Fig. 4) 69. In case of mutated SS1, the native pSS2 cannot rescue the \u20131PRF efficiency suggesting that its contribution to frameshifting is negligible. When SS1 is functional and pSS2 harbors the C5U mutation, the overall \u20131 frameshifting efficiency remains unchanged but a significant amount of \u20132 frameshifting is observed. Most importantly, when SS1 is dysfunctional, the C5U mutation in pSS2 can restore about 70% of the wild\u2010type \u20131PRF efficiency, which might be enough to sustain the viral lifecycle 69.\n\nInterestingly, HIV\u20101 is not the only virus which develops an alternative slippery site in response to antiviral treatment. Herpes simplex viruses resistant to acyclovir treatment accumulate mutations in their thymidine kinase (TK) gene turning previously silent repeats of G (G\u2010string) or C (C\u2010cord) nucleotides into functional slippery sites, supporting +1 and \u20131 slippage, respectively 102, 103. \u20131PRF in the C\u2010cord is thought to proceed via single P\u2010site tRNA slippage and is stimulated by a nonstop mRNA, presumably, by stalling the ribosome on the polyA\u2010tail 102. These frameshifting events provide a sufficient level of TK and thus represent a rescue mechanism for the virus to ensure its viability despite the damage caused by the antiviral therapy 102, 103.\n\nFrameshifting sites utilize a great variety of the mRNA secondary structure elements. Despite this diversity, \u20131PRF seems to operate via two major evolutionary conserved kinetic pathways: through two\u2010tRNA slippage during translocation or through one\u2010tRNA P\u2010site slippage at limited supply of the tRNA that decodes the 0\u2010frame A\u2010site codon. The choice of the frameshifting pathway is defined by the availability of the tRNA reading the slippery site codons, which is of crucial importance for pathogenic viruses whose codon usage is different from that of their hosts. Pathogenic viruses have developed different strategies, such as utilizing alternative frameshifting routes, newly emerging slippery sites or alternative slippages, to ensure robust frameshifting efficiencies and thus robust viral cycle progression, regardless of environmental or therapy\u2010induced changes.\n\nDependence of \u20131PRF on cis\u2010acting elements\u2014the slippery sites and the mRNA secondary structures\u2014is well understood, whereas the list of trans\u2010acting factors modulating frameshifting is still growing. Recent evidence suggests that multiple proteins of the human immune system can influence the \u20131PRF efficiency in infectious viruses by acting directly on the frameshifting sites or competing for the translation resources 84, 85. Small interfering RNAs represent another group of important players in modulating frameshifting 32. Better understanding of trans\u2010acting factors will provide not only novel insights into the mechanism of frameshifting, but will also yield the necessary understanding of the host\u2013pathogen\u2013host interaction and coadaptation, which could lay a foundation for future therapeutic approaches.\n\nClassical antiviral therapies targeting key components of the viral life cycle lead to the emergence of resistant virus isolates due to selection pressure and high mutation rates in viral genomes 104. Frameshifting sites and especially slippery heptamers represent attractive targets for antiviral drug design because their sequences are highly conserved among virus subtypes 20, 105 and frameshifting often determines virus viability. Attempts to develop antiframeshifting therapeutics against HIV\u20101 using both natural and synthetic molecules has so far not succeed in clinical trials because of their cytotoxicity and off\u2010target effects 106, 107, 108. This is because \u20131PRF relies on highly conserved elements of the translation machinery, which makes it likely that both the viral and host components are targeted. Our recent understanding of frameshifting modulation suggests that exploitation of the host cellular resources could become an alternative approach to dysregulate frameshifting in pathogenic viruses. Because of the differences in codon usage between HIV\u20101 and its human host, a strategy worth exploring would be to change the levels of the tRNAs crucial for the decoding of the viral frameshifting motif but dispensable for the host translation, such as tRNALeu(UAA); or overexpression of human genes with virus\u2010like codon usage to deplete the available translation resources. Thus, frameshifting\u2014which is a remarkable recoding event\u2014remains an interesting target for future medical research."}
