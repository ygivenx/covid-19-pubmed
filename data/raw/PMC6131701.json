{"title": "Integration of Global Analyses of Host Molecular Responses\nwith Clinical Data To Evaluate Pathogenesis and Advance Therapies\nfor Emerging and Re-emerging Viral Infections", "body": "Global gene expression\ninvestigations have provided information regarding host response to\nemerging and re-emerging pathogens at the level of individual genes\nor gene clusters. However, there is a paucity of information regarding\nthe relationship of cell signaling networks, and in particular their\nactivation status, with the biological/pathological events that occur\nthroughout infection.\n\nIt has been well established that many\nbiological processes can be regulated independent of transcriptional\nor translational changes through post-translational modification (PTM)\nevents. Indeed, kinase-mediated phosphorylation of proteins, in which\nkinases catalyze the transfer of the \u03b3 phosphate group from\nATP to the hydroxyl group of a specific Ser, Thr, Tyr residue, is\namong the most thoroughly characterized PTM. Virtually all cell signal\ntransduction events are regulated by kinases independent of biological\ncomplexity of the host (i.e., prokaryotes and eukaryotes).3 Lending further credence to the biological importance\nof kinases, >500 kinases have been identified in the human genome,\nand \u223c30% of the human proteome is modulated by kinase-mediated\nphosphorylation events.4,5 Thus, considering the central\nrole of kinases in a broad range of cellular processes (including\ngrowth and development, metabolism, and immune responses), it has\nbeen postulated that the activities of individual kinases may represent\nmore reliable predictors of cellular phenotypes than transcriptional\nor translational changes.6 Indeed, transcriptional\nor translational-based OMICS approaches are often unable to account\nfor regulatory events including gene silencing, mRNA stability, translational\nefficiencies, protein turnover, enzyme/substrate subcellular sequestration,\nor protein activation/repression PTMs.7 Given the central role of kinases in the regulation of biological\nprocesses, kinases are a logical drug target. As a testament to this,\n33 kinase inhibitors have been granted licensure by the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) for a broad range of malignancies, and\nthere are a continually increasing number of kinase inhibitors that\nare in various stages of preclinical trials. Furthermore, kinases\nare the second most frequently targeted gene class in cancer therapy\nafter the G protein coupled receptors.8,9 The recent\nprioritization for the repurposing of approved therapeutics for alternative\nmalignancies by the National Institutes of Health Center for Advancing\nTranslational Sciences (NCATS)10,11 also provides considerable\nimpetus for the investigation of licensed kinase inhibitors as infectious\ndisease therapeutics. Concerns exist regarding the therapeutic application\nof kinase inhibitors as novel therapeutics for infectious disease,\nin particular to the potential immunosuppressive effects following\nprolonged treatment. However, it should be appreciated that the application\nof kinase inhibitors in such cases would need to be targeted in terms\nof timing and dose, with appropriate molecular biomarkers guiding\ninitiation and cessation. It should also be appreciated that the clinical\nsymptoms associated with many emerging and re-emerging pathogens have\nbeen associated with dysregulated host immune responses (in particular\npro-inflammatory responses).\n\nThus, the global analysis of the\nactivation state of host kinases (the kinome) can provide critical\ninsight into the specific activation state of individual kinases,\ncell signaling pathways, or larger biological networks. In addition,\nkinome investigations may offer important, and predictive, insight\ninto the cellular mechanisms that regulate phenotypic changes within\ncells.7 As many kinases recognize a particular\nphosphorylation motif composed of the central phosphoacceptor site\nand the amino acids +4 and \u22124 residues from the central phosphorylation\nsite,12 peptides representing this kinase\ntarget motif can be synthesized with relatively high efficiency and\nlow expense. Indeed, kinase target motif peptides have been shown\nto be appropriate substrates for their respective kinases with Vmax and Km values\napproaching those of the full-length protein.13 Thus, peptide kinome arrays can be constructed in an analogous manner\nto traditional DNA microarrays where kinase target motif peptides\nare spotted onto a glass slide representing hundreds to thousands\nof unique peptide targets for kinases (Figure 2). Following this, samples in the form of\ncellular lysates from whole organs, tissues, or individual cell types\ncan be applied to the kinome peptide arrays, allowing for the phosphorylation\nof specific peptide targets by kinases within the lysate (Figure 3). The development\nof kinome-specific bioinformatics analysis software, including the\nPlatform for Intelligent, Integrated Kinome Analysis (PIIKA), has\nprovided a mechanism to identify the complex patterns of kinase-mediated\nphosphorylation events and quantitate the differences between compared\nconditions.14,15\n\nSyndromic case-definition\nfor MERS infection requires a compatible clinical syndrome and an\nepidemiologic risk factor including travel to an affected region or\ncontact with a known or suspected case. Initial symptoms of MERS-CoV\ninfection include fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, myalgia,\nand malaise following a mean incubation period of 5 days, which can\nrange from 2 to 14 days.23 Mildly symptomatic\nor possibly asymptomatic infections have been reported, and progression\nto severe disease is associated with pre-existing medical conditions\nincluding cardiopulmonary disease, obesity, and diabetes. Most (98%)\nof reported MERS cases are among adults, with a median age of 50 years.\nIn severe cases respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation\ntypically occurs within 7 days of symptom onset.22 Laboratory abnormalities include lymphopenia, leukopenia,\nthrombocytopenia, elevated serum creatinine levels consistent with\nacute kidney injury, and elevated liver enzymes.23\u221227 High lactate levels and consumptive coagulopathy\nhave also been reported.24,28 Chest radiographic\nabnormalities are observed in most cases consistent with viral pneumonitis,\nsecondary bacterial pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.22\u221224,27,29\n\nData characterizing immune responses during MERS-CoV infection\nare limited. Faure et al. evaluated cytokine levels in serum and bronchoalveolar\nlavage (BAL) from two MERS patients, one with fatal disease and one\nwho survived.30 Higher levels of retinoic\nacid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1), melanoma differentiation-associated\nprotein 5 (MDA5), interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and -7, interleukin\n(IL) 17A, and IL-23 and lower levels of IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 were\nobserved in the fatal case compared with the survivor. More recently,\nMin et al. performed a temporal analysis of cytokine, chemokine, and\ngrowth factor blood levels from 14 patients during the recent outbreak\nof MERS in South Korea.31 The patients\nwere subcategorized into four groups on the basis of disease severity:\nGroup I patients developed fever and recovered. Group II patients\ndeveloped mild pneumonia without hypoxemia. Group III patients had\nprolonged and severe pneumonia. Group IV patients had severe pneumonia\nand acute respiratory distress syndrome. Group IV patients included\nfive fatal cases of MERS; all patients in groups I\u2013III fully\nrecovered from illness. IFN\u03b1 was elevated in all groups and\nlargely peaked during the second week of illness. Granulocyte-colony\nstimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte macrophage (GM)-CSF were\nsimilarly elevated across all patient groups; however, patients with\nfatal disease had reduced GM-CSF responses following antiviral treatment\nas compared to patients that recovered. Patients with pneumonia had\nrelative elevations of IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1,\nIL-6, and IL-10 during the second and third weeks of illness. Elevated\nIL-6 and IL-10 appeared to trend positively with the severity of illness.\nA robust induction of multiple chemokines was found in most patients.\nNotably, eotaxin and regulated on activation, normal T expressed and\nsecreted (RANTES) was elevated in all patients. In contrast, IL-8,\nmonocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-3 and macrophage inflammatory protein\n(MIP)-1\u03b2 were more prominent in groups II and III as compared\nto groups I and IV. Furthermore, elevated interferon gamma induced\nprotein (IP)-10 correlated with the development of pneumonia (groups\nI\u2013III). Multiple growth factors, including epidermal growth\nfactor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor (VEGF), and TGF-\u03b1, were significantly elevated\nacross all patients; however, EGF was significantly higher in patients\nthat recovered from disease as compared to the fatal cases. Further\nevaluations are needed to characterize the natural history of immune\nresponse during acute MERS-CoV infection and recovery.\n\nIn an effort to better\ncharacterize MERS-CoV pathogenesis in the absence of available samples\nfrom human patients and, in particular, address pathologic changes\nassociated with infection, multiple animal species have been employed\nin MERS-CoV investigations. While multiple small animals are not susceptible\nto MERS-CoV infection,32 rhesus macaques\nand marmosets develop mild to severe lung pathology following experimental\ninfection. Transcriptome analysis in MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques\nrevealed that genes related to antiviral immunity, chemotaxis, and\ninflammation were overexpressed in lesional versus grossly normal\nlung tissue at 3 days postinfection.33 A\nsignificantly smaller number of differentially expressed genes was\nfound on day 6 postinfection with no obvious trends following pathway\nenrichment analysis. Significant changes in the transcriptome profiles\nof peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were observed at only\nday 1 postinfection. This global analysis suggests a key role for\nan initial rapid innate immune and inflammatory response (through\npattern recognition receptors) followed by rapid resolution.33 A study of MERS-CoV-infected marmosets evaluated\nlung lesions by RNaseq at days 3\u20136 postinfection.34 Pathway analyses demonstrated that chemotaxis\nand cell migration, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation\nand fibrogenesis were highly over-represented relative to uninfected\ncontrols. To a lesser degree, pathways associated with inflammation,\nvascularization, endothelial activation, proliferation of smooth muscle,\nand tissue repair were also over-represented in infected animals.\nDifferences were most significant on days 4 and 6 postinfection during\nillness progression relative to day 3.\n\nRecently, Menachery and\ncolleagues examined the interaction between MERS-CoV EMC/2012 and\nthe host IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) response by transcriptomics.35 ISG responses in MERS-CoV infected Calu3 cells,\na lung adenocarcinoma cell line, had no discernible induction initially\nupon infection but were up-regulated by 12 h postinfection.35 Down-regulation of a subset of ISGs resulted\nin altered histone modifications, a potential epigenetic contributor\nto early impairment of antiviral cellular defenses. In a separate\nanalysis genetically distinct MERS-CoV strains, MERS-CoV SA1 and MERS-CoV\nEng1, produced distinct gene expression profiles in Calu-3 cells.36 These analyses may better inform early host-cell\nantiviral responses and the impact of viral evolution on these and\nother complex biological responses. Proteomics analysis corroborated\nthese transcriptional data with induction of ISGs observed 18 h postinfection.\nSignificantly reduced levels of STAT1 and PKR compared with uninfected\ncontrols were also noted. Differential host transcriptome responses\nto MERS-CoV SA1 and MERS-CoV Eng1 highlight both the propensity of\nemerging viral pathogens to evolve rapidly and the importance of additional\nhost response analyses for augmenting and clarifying such complex\nbiological responses.\n\nHost responses to MERS-CoV infection through kinome analysis were\nrecently assessed using Huh-7 cells, an immortalized human hepatocyte\ncell line, that are highly permissive to MERS-CoV infection.37 Temporal analysis of kinome responses by peptide\narrays revealed selective modulation of extracellular signal-regulated\nkinases (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases\n(PI3K)/AKT (also known as protein kinase B)/mechanistic target of\nrapamycin (mTOR) signaling responses. Over-representation analysis\n(ORA) revealed ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling responses were\nconsistently up-regulated during infection. Multiple ERK/MAPK family\nmembers formed central components of functional networks and signaling\npathways throughout infection. Similar results were observed for intermediates\nof the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway at 1 and 24 h postinfection,\nsuggesting that modulation of ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling\nmay be important for productive MERS-CoV infection.\n\nDownstream\nanalysis of the phosphorylation patterns of pathway intermediates\nfrom the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling supported observations\nfrom the kinome analysis. Both investigations demonstrated that nuclear\nfactor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF\u03baB)-regulated\nfamily members were important mediators of MERS-CoV infection.38 IL8- and IFN-mediated signalings were also modulated\nduring MERS-CoV infection, consistent with prior analyses.39,40 These results were also in agreement with in vitro transcriptional\nanalysis of MERS-CoV infection.38 Prophylactic\nor therapeutic addition of FDA-licensed kinase inhibitors targeting\nactivated kinases in MERS-CoV infection impaired viral replication.\nThese hypothesis-generating data may inform directed investigations\ninto MERS-CoV pathogenesis and, importantly, demonstrate the potential\nto identify novel host-centric therapeutic targets.\n\nEBOV transmission occurs through exposure of infected body fluids\nor tissues to mucous membranes or nonintact skin.43 The mean incubation period is 6\u201310 days, ranging\nfrom 2 to 21 days.43 Initial signs and\nsymptoms are nonspecific including fever, myalgia, and malaise and\ncannot be reliably distinguished from other endemic illnesses in Africa\nincluding malaria and enteric infections.43 Whereas mild illness has been described, most patients develop severe\ndisease within days of symptom onset. Massive gastrointestinal fluid\nlosses of up to 5\u201310 L per day due to vomiting and watery diarrhea\nmay result in progressive dehydration and hypovolemic shock. Even\nin the setting of adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement, sequential\nmultiorgan failure may occur. EBOV infects multiple organs and cell\ntypes throughout the body with the notable exception of lymphocytes\nthat are indirectly depleted early during infection. Organ injury\ndue to direct viral or indirect host-mediated responses results in\nsevere complications including meningo-encephalitis, uveitis, respiratory\nfailure, secretory diarrhea, disordered coagulation, renal failure,\nhepatic necrosis, and myositis. The clinical presentation, laboratory\nvalues, viral kinetics, and clinical management of EVD patients in\nWest Africa, Europe, and the United States during the 2014\u20132015\noutbreak have been recently well-characterized.44\n\nThere is a paucity of information regarding\nEBOV pathogenesis in humans primarily due to the limited frequency\nof EVD outbreaks prior to 2014 and limitations presented by sample\nacquisition from infected patients in the field as well as the overall\nsize of patient cohorts. Largely contradictory findings regarding\nthe immune responses in those who survive or succumb to EVD have further\nconfounded the understanding of EBOV pathogenesis in human patients.\nFor example, Villinger et al. reported that serum cytokine concentrations\n(including IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and IL-4) were\nelevated in patients with fatal infections in comparison to survivors.45 In contrast, additional studies have suggested\nthat fatal infections were instead related to general immunosuppression\nincluding IFN\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-4.46\u221249 An investigation of SUDV infection\nin humans by Sanchez et al. demonstrated limited changes in the expression\nlevels of cytokines, Fas antigen, and Fas ligand in PBMCs from infected\npatients relative to those found for uninfected patients.50 Furthermore, an investigation of 42 fatally\ninfected EVD patients by Wauquier et al. has further confounded the\nrole of host immune responses in fatal EVD as hypersecretion of multiple\ncytokines and growth factors and decreased secretion of T lymphocyte-derived\ncytokines were associated with fatal disease.51\n\nTo\ndate, no investigations of host gene expression in EBOV-infected patients\nhave been reported, although limited data are available from animal\nmodels of infection or from in vitro investigations.\n\nIn a study\nof PBMCs from EBOV-infected crab-eating macaques, Rubins et al. found\nfew notable changes in the early stages of infection (1\u20132 days);\nhowever, broad changes were observed over days 4\u20136 post-infection.\nPro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1)\nand chemokines (MIP-1\u03b1 and MCP1\u20134) were up-regulated\nat days 4\u20136 postinfection relative to healthy controls.52 Multiple genes related to apoptosis including\nBcl-2 family members, multiple caspases, Fas-associated death domain\nprotein, and TNF superfamily member 10 were also up-regulated at late\ntime points. IFN-regulated genes were up-regulated by day 2 postinfection\nand remained so through study day 6.\n\nYan et al. investigated\nPBMC gene expression in EBOV-infected rhesus macaques with or without\nanticoagulant administration. Untreated animals displayed up-regulation\nof immune response genes, B cell receptor signaling intermediates,\nNK cell mediated cytotoxicity, leukocyte activation, and lymphocyte\nactivation compared with anticoagulant-treated animals during the\nearly stages of infection. The expression levels of these gene clusters\nfell to pre-infection levels at the late-stage of infection. In contrast,\ngenes related to defense responses, apoptosis, wounding, inflammation,\ncoagulation, and leukocyte activation remained elevated during early-\nand late-stage infection.\n\nFollowing the isolation of RESTV from\npigs,53 subsequent investigations have\ndemonstrated that pigs were susceptible to both RESTV and EBOV infection\nwith preferential targeting of macrophages in the lungs. Recently,\nNfon et al. demonstrated that EBOV infection in pigs resulted in up-regulation\nof chemokine expression beginning on day 3 postinfection as compared\nto mock-infected pigs.54 The most pronounced\nchanges in gene expression were found on days 5 and 7 postinfection\nand included the up-regulation of a broad set of cytokines (IL-5,\nIL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-22, IL-26, IL-27, resistin), chemokines (CCL2,\nCCL10, CCL19, CCL20, AMCF-II, CCL3L1, CCL4), cell adhesion protein\n(selectin), antimicrobial protein, palate, lung, and nasal epithelium\nclone proteins, and pro-apoptotic molecules (multiple caspases, caspase\nrecruitment domain-containing protein 6 (CARD), apoptosis-associated\ntyrosine kinase (AATK), Fas, Fas-associated protein with death domain\n(FADD), TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), TNF\u03b1-induced\nprotein 3-interacting protein 1 (TNIP1)). In addition, expression\nof multiple genes related to microbial sensing (pattern recognition\nreceptors) or antiviral responses (ISGs) was up-regulated in the lungs\nof infected animals. Although the localization of the cytokine response\nof pigs and humans or NHPs differs during the course of EBOV infection\n(localized responses in the lungs of pigs versus a predominantly systemic\nresponse in humans and NHPs), the cytokine profiles of pigs, humans,\nand NHPs were quite similar. For example, comparison of NHP52 and porcine responses54 during EBOV infection demonstrated multiple gene expression similarities\nbetween the two species (i.e., IL-6, IL-8, caspase family members).\nIt is also likely that direct comparison of both data sets would likely\nyield many common gene signatures that are conserved in their identity\nas well as their directionality (up-regulation vs down-regulation).\n\nMacrophages are an early target of EBOV infection and support high-level\nviral replication. EBOV attachment and entry into human macrophages\nin vitro induces pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-8,\nand TNF-\u03b1 as early as 1 h postinfection.55 Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is a recognized complication\nof EVD, and human autopsy data support that alveolar macrophages are\na target of EBOV infection. EBOV infection of alveolar macrophages\nin vitro resulted in an early, transient increase in cytokine and\nchemokine expression,56 supporting that\nparacrine-soluble mediators of inflammation may contribute to vascular\nleakage in the lungs. Gene expression responses of EBOV- and MARV-infected\nHuh7 cells resulted in the global suppression of antiviral responses,\nincluding Toll-like receptor (TLR), IRF3, and protein kinase R (PKR)-mediated\npathways.57 However, signal transducers\nand activators of transcription (STAT) phosphorylation in EBOV- and\nMARV-infected cells were differentially modulated. EBOV-mediated IFN\ninhibition has been well characterized and is thought to be attributable\nto EBOV proteins VP24 and VP35.58 Interestingly,\nRESTV infection, which does not induce clinical illness in humans,\nresulted in the activation of >20% of the IFN-stimulated genes\n(ISGs).\n\nHepatocytes are an early\ntarget of EBOV infection, directly contributing to diffuse hepatic\nnecrosis observed in fatal cases. EBOV infection of Huh7 cells has\nbeen evaluated by kinome analyses, shedding light on liver pathogenesis\nin EVD.59 EBOV infection of Huh-7 cells\nresulted in temporal modulation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway\nas compared to mock-infected cells. Pathway ORA demonstrated that\nmultiple TGF-\u03b2-mediated signaling pathways were up-regulated\nat 1 and 24 h post EBOV infection. Furthermore, these responses were\nassociated with changes in the expression patterns of multiple cellular\nproteins associated with a mesenchyme-like transition. These included\nthe up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9, N-cadherin, and fibronectin\nand down-regulation of E-cadhering and claudin 1. In this process\ncells lose polarity and cell-to-cell adhesion transforming into mesenchymal\nstem cells that contribute to wound healing or organ fibrosis; however,\nthe role of these events in EBOV infection remains to be elucidated.\nAdditional analysis demonstrated that inhibition of PI3K/AKT, ERK/MAPK,\nor PKC pathways with kinase inhibitors reduced EBOV replication when\nadministered prophylactically or therapeutically. Supporting this\nobservation, a subset of kinase inhibitors administered to EBOV-infected\nmice reduced lethality. Defining mechanisms by which kinase inhibitors\nshow benefit in these models will better clarify their role as potential\ntherapeutics.\n\nClinical and epidemiological\ninformation regarding human MPXV disease has been derived from enhanced\nsurveillance campaigns in the Congo Basin.61 From this work, it has been demonstrated that human MPXV infection\nand illness largely mirror those of discrete, ordinary smallpox.61 The incubation period for both viruses (VARV\nand MPXV) is 7\u201317 days with an initial febrile prodromal period\nof 1\u20134 days. This prodromal period is normally accompanied\nby fever, headache, backache, malaise, and prostration.61 The rash period for both smallpox and MPXV (including\nlesion appearance and desquamation) normally occurs 14\u201328 days\npostinfection with highly similar appearance, distribution, and progression\nof lesions.60,61 As with smallpox, MPXV-associated\nrash progresses through macular, papular, vesicular, and pustular\nphases. A second febrile period occurs when the lesions become pustular\nand is often associated with deteriorating conditions in the patient.\nLymphadenopathy (maxillay, cervical, or inguinal) is often associated\nwith MPXV infections prior to, or concomitant with, rash development\nbut is absent in VARV infections. It has been postulated that this\nreflects the effective generation of host immune responses during\nMPXV infection as compared to VARV; however, this has yet to be validated.60,61 Severe complications have been noted late in the course of MPXV\ninfection, including pulmonary distress or bronchopneumonia, corneal\nscarring and permanent vision loss, and encephalitis.60 Severe dehydration due to excessive vomiting or diarrhea\nmay also occur. Long-term sequelae in survivors are most commonly\nassociated with pitted scarring.\n\nAlthough MPXV infections\nin humans have been recorded for over four decades, there has been\nlittle information regarding host immune responses during the course\nof natural infection. As disease presentation is highly similar during\nMPXV and VARV infections, it has been postulated that immune responses\nwould likely be highly conserved. Recently, Johnston et al. provided\nthe first empirical evidence for a relationship between cytokine responses\nand disease severity during MPXV infection.65 Serum cytokines were analyzed from 19 patients with confirmed MPXV\ninfections ranging from mild to severe as assessed by the WHO smallpox\nlesion scoring system.66,67 Serum concentrations of IL-1\u03b2,\nIL-1RA, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, MCP-1,\nand RANTES were elevated in all disease groups (mild to severe) as\ncompared to normal serum concentrations. IL-10 concentrations were\nalso elevated in all disease groups and were proportional to disease\nseverity. However, patients with serious MPXV disease had significantly\nhigher concentrations of IL-10 compared to all other disease groups.\nMPXV infection resulted in elevated MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2;\nmild cases had significantly elevated levels above the moderate or\nsevere disease groups. Serum concentrations of IL-2R were elevated\nacross all disease groups; however, patients with serious disease\nhad significantly higher IL-2R serum levels than those with mild to\nsevere MPXV disease. GM-CSF levels were significantly elevated only\nin those with serious MPXV disease as compared to normal serum ranges.\nOn the basis of these observations, MPXV infection resulted in prominent\nT helper 2 (Th2) and dampened Th1 responses.\n\nTranscriptome analyses have largely been employed\nfor the in vitro investigation of the molecular pathogenesis of MPXV\ninfection. Alkhalil et al. investigated the host transcriptome responses\nto MPXV infection during the first cycle of viral replication (3 and\n7 h postinfection) in rhesus macaque kidney epithelial cells.68 Interestingly, MPXV infection resulted in a\nstrong down-regulation of host transcriptional responses. Of the transcripts\nthat met the authors\u2019 criteria for significance, 89% of the\ntranscripts were found to be down-regulated at both postinfection\ntime points. Comparative functional analysis from both time points\nsuggested that the primary biological functions associated with these\ndown-regulated transcriptional responses were largely related to cell\nmorphology, cell development, metabolic responses, and post-translational\nmodifications. Canonical pathway analysis demonstrated a general conservation\nin the identities of over-represented pathways at both time points\nincluding multiple growth factor signaling pathways, p53 signaling,\nand cell cycle-related pathways. More recently, Bourquain et al. investigated\nhost transcriptome responses in MPXV-infected HeLa cells, a cervical\nepithelial cell line.84 At 6 h post-MPXV\ninfection, only 1.1% of the transcripts analyzed were found to have\n>2-fold changes in gene expression. In contrast to Alkhalil et\nal., the majority of these transcripts (\u223c68%) were found to\nbe up-regulated as compared to mock-infected controls. Functional\nanalysis of all transcripts with >2-fold changes in gene expression\ndemonstrated a strong over-representation of genes involved in the\nnegative regulation of MAPK signaling and the intracellular protein\ncascade. Positive regulation of pathways related to Toll-like receptor\nsignaling, chemotaxis, and regulation of leukocyte migration was also\npredicted from the data. An investigation by Rubins et al. compared\nthe temporal host transcriptome response to MPXV in multiple human\ncells targeted by MPXV including primary macrophages, primary fibroblasts,\nand HeLa cells.69 The trasncriptome of\nMPXV-infected fibroblasts was found to have the most significant changes\nwhere MPXV infection resulted in the depletion of \u223c2000 genes\nby a factor of \u22653. Interestingly, MPXV infection resulted in\nthe broad repression of many transcripts related to innate immune\nresponses in all cell types tested. In contrast, inactivated MPXV\nresulted in strong up-regulation of innate immune responses in all\nof the cell types. It was also noted that MPXV infection resulted\nin strong cytopathic effects across all of the cell types in contrast\nto an almost universal repression of innate immune responses.\n\nHuman MPXV infections\nand infection models of MPXV in various animal species have demonstrated\nthat the Congo Basin MPXV clade is more virulent than the West African\nMPXV clade. However, there has been a paucity of information regarding\nthe underlying molecular mechanisms mitigating these virulence differences.\nFurthermore, previous investigations focusing on gene expression or\nproteomic changes during MPXV infection have focused solely on Congo\nBasin MPXV. To address this, host kinome analysis was performed on\nCongo Basin and West African MPXV-infected human monocytes, a host\ncell targeted by orthopoxviruses.70 As\nthe genomes of both MPXV clades demonstrate considerable diversity\nin the regions coding host response modifier proteins, and in particular\nin genes associated with anti-apoptotic activities, it was postulated\nthat the virulence differences of the two MPXV clades may be related\nto differential modulation of host cellular responses. Hierarchical\nclustering of the kinome data sets suggested limited similarities\nat the level of host kinase modulation between the two MPXV clades.\nThe Congo Basin MPXV kinome data set clustered most strongly with\nthe kinome data set from CPXV-infected monocytes and moderately with\nthe VACV-infected monocyte data set. Both CPXV and VACV can cause\nserious disease in humans. The pathway ORA of the kinome data demonstrated\nthat Congo Basin MPXV infection resulted in strong down-regulation\nof a large proportion of host cell responses, most notably apoptosis,\nin comparison to West African MPXV. Biological validation through\nfluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and caspase 3 activity\nanalyses confirmed this phenomenon. From the perspective of individual\nphosphorylation events, the kinome data also suggested that AKT phosphorylation\nat Ser473 was increased in Congo Basin MPXV-infected cells as compared\nto West African MPXV-infected cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of AKT\nphosphorylation at Ser473 resulted in a >250-fold inhibition of\nCongo Basin MPXV virus yields, whereas those for West African MPXV\nwere unaffected. Prior investigations with CPXV and VACV demonstrated\nthat pharmacological inhibition of AKT resulted in decreased viral\nyields for both viruses.71 Overall, this\ninvestigation provided significant insight into the host cellular\nresponse differences between the two MPXV clades.\n\nEmerging and re-emerging pathogens are a continual threat to global\nhealth. In recent years, disease outbreaks associated with SARS and\nthe 2009 influenza pandemic have also demonstrated that these pathogens\ncan have considerable effects on local, national, and international\neconomies. As a consequence, regional outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging\npathogens can have deleterious effects on global stability. Thus,\nit is prudent that a concerted effort is employed to assimilate data\nthat bridge both clinical and molecular information in investigations\nof these pathogens. These efforts will not only provide considerable\ncontext in regard to the molecular events that potentiate clinical\nmanifestations of pathogenesis but also better inform the design and\nimplementation of novel therapeutics. To this end, global analyses\nof host molecular responses can provide considerable insight into\nthe complex molecular events that underlie cellular responses. Indeed,\ntranscriptome analyses have provided important information regarding\nhost transcriptional responses during emerging and re-emerging pathogen\ninfection. These investigations often provide critical insight into\nthe kinetics of host immune responses during the course of infection\nas well as mechanistic information regarding the cellular intermediates\ninvolved in these processes. However, the role of PTMs in the regulation\nof these events cannot be captured by traditional transcriptome technologies.\nIn particular, the role of kinase-mediated regulation of cell signaling\npathways has remained poorly understood. Given the central role of\nkinases in the regulation of cellular processes (e.g., homeostasis,\nmetabolism, proliferation, and stress responses), it is of inherent\nimportance that future investigations also address the role of the\nkinome in the cellular response to pathogen insult. Furthermore, kinomics\nalso provides a mechanism for the identification of novel therapeutic\ntargets based on the direct assessment of the activation state of\ncell signaling pathways. For example, pro-inflammatory responses during\nearly stages of infection, and in particular the dysregulation of\nspecific cytokines or cell signaling events that contribute to these,\nmay represent potential therapeutic targets in the early stages of\nhigh-consequence viral pathogen infection. However, the selection\nof immunomodulatory therapeutics that target these dysregulated host\nresponses is complicated by the regulatory events (i.e., kinase-mediated\ncell signaling events) that occur upstream of changes in gene expression.\nIn addition, mRNA is subject to a variety of regulatory processes\n(including gene silencing, mRNA stability, translational efficiencies,\nprotein turnover, enzyme/substrate subcellular sequestration, and/or\nprotein activation/repression PTMs). Thus, from the standpoint of\ntherapeutic discovery, the sole reliance on technologies for the global\ninvestigations of host responses that do not account for these regulatory\nprocesses or the role of PTMs in the modulation of cellular responses\ncould impede the identification of efficacious therapeutics.\n\nTo this end, kinome analysis may also facilitate the identification\nof immunomodulatory therapeutics that have gained licensure through\nanalysis of a quantifiable biological event (kinase-mediated phosphorylation)\nor for identifying novel host therapeutic targets for which therapeutics\ncould be designed/developed. Furthermore, kinase inhibitors may serve\nas primary or adjunctive therapies for emerging infectious diseases.\nIn addition, preclinical data and the increasing number of kinase\ninhibitors that have gained regulatory approval for cancer and other\nmaladies suggest this approach is feasible and efficacious. From the\nperspective of this review, kinome investigations have identified\nseveral therapeutic targets and licensed kinase inhibitors that have\nimpaired viral replication in vitro and reduced the severity of disease\nin vivo (Table 1).\nFor example, it has been demonstrated that the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR\nsignaling pathways have a role in viral propagation during MERS-CoV\ninfection.37 Indeed, licensed kinase inhibitors\nthat targeted these pathways (i.e., everolimus, selumetinib, and trametinib)\nresulted in decreased viral replication in vitro when added prior\nto, or following, infection. Furthermore, the pharmacologic inhibition\nof PI3K and PKC following EBOV infection provided partial protection\nin a lethal model of EVD in mice.59 It\nshould be noted that although the modulation of an individual kinase\nmay have suppressive effects on infection (i.e., viral replication),\nthis might not provide the level of inhibition required to completely\nnegate viral escape. In addition, given the ability of many cell signaling\npathways to signal through both canonical and noncanonical mechanisms,\ninhibition at a single intermediary point within a pathway may not\nprovide the overall level of inhibition required to negate a deleterious\nresponse (i.e., viral replication, changes in cellular phenotypes,\netc.). Thus, although previous investigations have demonstrated that\nindividual kinases or cell signaling pathways may represent novel\ntargets for anti-infective therapies, it is prudent that future investigations\nalso examine combinations of inhibitors for efficacy and anti-infective\nactivities. Furthermore, the targeting of cell signaling pathways\nat or near the origin point for the cell signaling cascade should\nalso be examined as these likely represent stronger inhibitory targets\ngiven the generally reduced branching of cell signaling networks at\nor near the cell receptor.\n\nIn addition to host-directed\ntherapeutic targeting, kinomics also confers the ability to identify\nnovel inhibitors of pathogens through detailed characterization of\nthe viral life cycle. Host-mediated PTMs, and in particular kinase-mediated\nphosphorylation, have been implicated in the viral life cycle and\npathogenesis for several members of the order Mononegavirales, including\nEBOV.72\u221274 Thus, therapeutic targeting of kinases may represent\na novel therapeutic strategy that can be employed to modulate host-centric\nor pathogen-centric molecular events during infection. For example,\nin silico prediction of viral protein phosphorylation sites provides\na mechanism for the construction and, ultimately, the annotation of\nviral protein PTMs that are critical to the viral life cycle. Furthermore,\nthe use of kinome peptide arrays has extended beyond the human kinome\nand now extends to a variety of animal species.75\u221277 It has been\nsuggested that the interspecies phenotypic variability may reflect\ndifferences in phosphorylation sites found within the proteome.77 Thus, the development of species-specific kinome\npeptide arrays provides additional utility for kinome analysis as\npeptide arrays representing traditional laboratory animal species\n(mouse, guinea pig, nonhuman primate) can be employed to detail the\nspecies-specific host response. The results from such analyses, and\nthe overlap between these and those described previously from the\nanalysis of human infections, may inform the selection of appropriate\nanimal models that meet regulatory approval through the FDA Animal\nEfficacy Rule.29\n\nTaken together,\nit is of inherent importance that future investigations of emerging\nand re-emerging pathogens address the complex nature of biological\nresponses. Thus, molecular investigations of pathogenesis should be\nguided by available knowledge regarding the clinical and pathologic\nmanifestations of disease. Indeed, technologies that provide further\ngranularity into the precise molecular events that potentiate cellular\nresponses during the course of infection will assist investigations\nof emerging and re-emerging pathogens and the identification of novel\ntherapeutic targets. To this end, kinomics-based analyses of host\nresponses provide a mechanism to directly address the cellular events\nat the level of specific cell signaling phenomena that underlie the\nbiological responses and, ultimately, the clinical presentation of\ndisease for emerging infectious pathogens."}
