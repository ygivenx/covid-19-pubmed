{"title": "Development of Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) Assays Targeting SARS-CoV-2", "body": "SARS-CoV-2 is the causative viral pathogen of COVID-19 of which the outbreaks resulted in 106,893 confirmed cases involving 3,639 deaths over 103 countries, areas or territories as of 07 March 2020.\n\n[1] As the name suggests, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to a group of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV), namely subgenus Sarbecovirus, showing 96% identity to a bat coronavirus [2, 3] .\n\nDiagnosis of COVID-19 can be done through CT scan of suspicious patients and confirmatory lab test is performed using RT-qPCR methods [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Although RT-qPCR methods are used as the goldstandard for detection of pathogens due to its high sensitivity and specificity, it still have some caveats.\n\nBriefly, lab-level facility such as reliable supply of electricity, expensive instruments and trained personnel are required to properly perform RT-qPCR tests. These restrictions hinder to utilize RT-qPCR methods for various point-of-care where pathogen detection might be required [9] .\n\nTo overcome such cost-restriction of RT-qPCR and still detect pathogens' nucleic acids, isothermal amplification methods have been developed [10] . Among such methods, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method has some advantages to be applied for point-of-care test (POCT) [11] . Well optimized LAMP assay shows sensitivity comparable to that of PCR, less than 10 copies per reaction [12] . Intercalating fluorescent dyes are compatible with LAMP reaction so that we can observe amplification in real-time [13] . Because amplification efficiency of LAMP reaction is very high, changes in reaction mixture components made it possible to detect the result with colorimetric detection methods [14] [15] [16] . Moreover, unpurified sample can be directly used for LAMP [17] [18] [19] . This indicates that high-throughput test is possible when use of unpurified specimen is combined with noninstrumental (e.g. colorimetric) detection.\n\nIn this study, we designed and evaluated one-step reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) methods to detect SARS-CoV-2. We provide a pair of LAMP primer sets that is specific to SARS-CoV-2 and accompanying optimized reaction conditions. To achieve colorimetric detection of LAMP reaction, leuco crystal violet (LCV) method is applied [15] .\n\n. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

MERS-CoV RNA was isolated from cell pellet lysate of infected Vero cells (ATCC \u00ae CCL-81 \u2122 ).\n\nIn vitro transcribed standard RNA for SARS-CoV-2 was prepared as previously described [20] .\n\nTo prepare standard RNA for hCoV-229E, first amplicon of PCR (Forward primer: 5' -GCTAGTGGATGATCATGCTTTG -3', Reverse primer: 5' -TGGGGCCATAAACTGTTCTATTAC -3') was cloned to pBluescript II KS (+) plasmid with BamHI and XhoI. Then, in vitro transcription template was prepared by restriction enzyme cut with BglI and XhoI and purification after agarose gel electrophoresis. For hCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV, amplicons of PCR (OC43 forward primer: 5' -AGCAACCAGGCTGATGTCAATACC -3', OC43 reverse primer: 5' -AGCAGACCTTCCTGAGCCTTCAAT -3', MERS-CoV: UpE region [21] ) were synthesized and cloned to pBIC-A plasmid (Bioneer). In vitro transcription template for hCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV were prepared by restriction enzyme cut with BamHI-XhoI or SspI-XhoI, respectively. In vitro transcriptions were done with EZ\u2122 T7 High Yield In Vitro Transcription kit (Enzynomics) as manufacturer's instructions. RNA products were then purified using Agencourt RNAClean XP (Beckman Coulter).\n\nStandard RNA copy numbers were calculated from concentration measured by NanoDrop Lite (Thermo Scientific). All restriction enzymes were purchased from Enzynomics.\n\nTo evaluate genomic copy number of viral RNAs, dilutions of standard RNAs and viral RNAs in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) are subjected to one-step RT-qPCR. RT-qPCR reactions were carried out using LightCycler 96 instrument and following reagents: Luna Universal One-\n\nStep RT-qPCR Kit (New England Biolabs, NEB) for hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43, THUNDERBIRD .

Briefly, 10 pmol of random hexamer was used as reverse transcription primer and reaction was performed as follow: 20 minutes at 25\u2103, 30 minutes at 55\u2103 and 10 minutes at 80\u2103.\n\nLAMP reaction was performed with reaction mixture containing following components: 1.

The same amount of cDNA as the first round of screening is used. Two primer sets that showed relatively early non-specific amplification are discarded and remaining seven primer sets are subjected to further screening.\n\nThird and fourth rounds of screening were done by checking sensitivity to dilutions of cDNA and RNA, respectively. Five out of seven primer sets showed specific amplification for at least one replicate of . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Next, we evaluated sensitivity of the five primer sets to RNA dilutions in RT-LAMP using Bst3.0 and SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase. Two primer sets, both targeting Nsp3, showed best sensitivity that showed specific amplification at 10 -6 dilution of RNA (Figure 1) . We also added two primer sets, one targeting S and the other targeting N, for reaction optimization experiments as they showed fast threshold time for cDNA and to keep ranges of target genes. Primer sequences are represented in Table 1 .\n\nTo optimize RT-LAMP reaction with Bst3.0, we first evaluated optimal concentration of dNTP and Mg 2+ for each primer set. Three dNTP-Mg 2+ concentration combinations are tested at 69\u2103: dNTP 1.4 mM and Mg 2+ 8 mM, dNTP 1.4 mM and Mg 2+ 6 mM, dNTP 1 mM and Mg 2+ 6 mM. The copy number of RNA template was 1,000 copies per reaction. Best concentration combination was selected for each primer set by whether both of duplicate show specific amplification and by threshold time. Average threshold time (Tt_av) and corresponding dNTP and Mg 2+ concentrations are as follows: dNTP 1 mM and Mg 2+ 6 mM for \"Nsp3_1-61\" (Tt_av = 11.93), dNTP 1.4 mM and Mg 2+ 8 mM for \"Nsp3_2-24\" (Tt_av = 7.74), dNTP 1.4mM and Mg 2+ 6mM for \"S_1-2-2\" and \"N_21\" (Tt_av = 11.08 and 5.50, respectively).\n\nNext, we checked if amplification is improved at lower temperature (65\u2103) because optimal reaction temperature of SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase is 50-55\u2103 and manufacturer recommend 65-72\u2103 for optimal performance of Bst3.0. Notably, \"Nsp3_1-61\" and \"S_1-2-2\" primer sets show improved threshold time (Tt_av = 8.92 and 8.49, respectively). The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.983064 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nThe Limit of Detection (LoD) of optimized RT-LAMP assays were assessed through 5 to 1000 RNA copies/reaction in triplicate. Among four primer sets subjected to reaction optimization, \"S_1-2-2\" and \"N_21\" sets showed relatively poor sensitivity. For \"Nsp3_1-61\" and \"Nsp3_2-24\" primer sets, we additionally evaluated LoD with 2-fold SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (20U/reaction). LoD and Tt_av were improved by increasing reverse transcriptase amount. (Table 2, Supplementary Figure 2) As a result, both \"Nsp3_1-61\" and \"Nsp3_2-24\" RT-LAMP assays could detect as low RNA concentration as 100 copies per reaction.\n\nThe cross-reactivity of two SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assays targeting Nsp3 to other human Coronaviruses was not found for hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV ( Figure 2 ).\n\nIn this study, we designed and screened LAMP primer sets targeting SARS-CoV-2. Reaction optimization was also performed for selected primer sets. In summary, we designed and evaluated a pair of RT-LAMP assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 with limit of detection of 100 copies per reaction.\n\nOur RT-LAMP assays showed specificity to SARS-CoV-2 versus alphacoronavirus (hCoV-229E), betacoronavirus (hCoV-OC43) and MERS-CoV. Although we could not test specificity to SARS-CoV because proper sample was not in our hand, specificity of the RT-LAMP assays are easily expectable from the mismatching bases in primer binding sites (Figure 1) . Especially, both of F1/B1 sites of \"Nsp3_1-61\" primer set is in SARS-CoV-2 specific region of which aligning SARS-CoV sequence is not exist.\n\nAbout the sensitivity of LAMP assays, note that average threshold time is not well correlated with limit of detection. In fact, average threshold time of \"S_1-2-2\" and \"N_21\" primer sets for 1000 copies were faster than that of \"Nsp3_1-61\": 7.33 (RPR: 2/3) and 5.06 (RPR: 1/3) minutes, respectively. This dis-relation is previously reported [24] .One peculiar observation is that both \"S_1-2-2\" and \"N_21\"\n\nshowed good sensitivity to cDNA template (Supplementary Figure 1) unlike to RNA. Observed difference of sensitivity to RNA and cDNA seems significant even we account slight amplification that . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The reason may include stochastic nature of forming proper LAMP amplification intermediate -\"dumbbell\" structure [24] , higher stability of DNA:RNA double strand than DNA:DNA double strand and more.\n\nThe limit of detection of RT-LAMP assays suggested in this study, 100 copies per reaction, may not enough for sensitive screening of suspicious patients. This relatively high limit of detection would be from the target sequences used for primer design that are selected by specificity versus SARS-CoV. Indeed, target GC percentage and Tm of primers had to be adjusted to get enough number of starting sets for primer screening during LAMP primer design to give less-optimal primer sets.\n\nTherefore, there might be better target sequences for LAMP assay of SARS-CoV-2 in the view point of sensitivity. However, expected high specificity of RT-LAMP assays suggested in this study would be a good feature for a confirmatory test. In addition, considering high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 at early stage after symptom onset [25], suggested RT-LAMP assays may still be usable for screening tests.\n\nIn conclusion, we developed highly specific RT-LAMP assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe results of these RT-LAMP assays can be detected within 30 minutes after amplification reaction begin. In addition, we provided optimized reaction conditions to which LCV colorimetric detection method is applied that can be used for point-of-care tests.
