{"title": "CLINICAL STUDY DESIGN Rationale and Design of the Genomic Research in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis (GRADS) Study Sarcoidosis Protocol Clinical Study Design 1561", "body": "Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease characterized by noncaseating granulomas at sites of inflammation (1). The lungs or intrathoracic lymph nodes are involved in over 90% of cases, with variable involvement of other organs and tissues. There is tremendous heterogeneity in sarcoidosis clinical manifestations, severity, and clinical course that vary among different ethnic and racial groups. Despite progress in the understanding of the genetic and immunologic basis of sarcoidosis, the determinants of its disease manifestations and clinical course remain unclear, as does its etiology. There are currently no validated biomarkers that provide for global organ assessment, prediction of disease course, or response to therapy.\n\nThe human microbiome is a critical determinant of health and disease (2) . As the lung microbiome is likely to have a critical role in the pathobiology of immunologic lung diseases such as sarcoidosis, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute solicited applications for the Genomic Research in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis (GRADS) study. This multicenter study involves a collaborative effort of a Genomics Informatics Center (GIC) and seven clinical centers.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to describe the design of and rationale for the sarcoidosis protocol of the GRADS study. This protocol was derived by the Sarcoidosis Protocol Development Committee from the initial hypothesis of the GIC that distinct patterns in the lung microbiome are characteristic of sarcoidosis phenotypes and are reflected in changes in systemic inflammatory responses as measured by peripheral blood changes in gene transcription.\n\nThe clinical manifestations and disease course of sarcoidosis are both variable and largely unpredictable, representing a challenge to both the patient and clinician. Manifestations range from patients with acute sarcoidosis (or L\u00f6fgren syndrome) to those with chronic severe disease, including advanced lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiomyopathy (3) . A majority of patients experience remission, typically within the first 2-3 years. However, 30-50% of patients have unremitting chronic disease that can lead to significant organ dysfunction requiring long-term corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy. Mortality may reach 12% among those with advanced disease (4) .\n\nThe traditional method for characterizing sarcoidosis lung disease is to use a chest radiograph-based classification scheme referred to as the Scadding stage staging system (Table 1) (5) . There is epidemiologic evidence that the Scadding stage offers some predictive value in estimating the likelihood of spontaneous remission (high in Scadding stage 0 or I but low in Scadding Stages III and IV). Unfortunately, evidence that this staging system or other biomarkers can accurately predict disease course is lacking.\n\nThe pathologic hallmark of sarcoidosis is epithelioid granulomas consisting mainly of monocytes, macrophages, epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells, and T lymphocytes. Highlights of some of the central features of the pathobiology of sarcoidosis and findings that currently lack consensus are summarized in Table 2 (6) . In the lung, the sarcoidosis inflammatory cascade displays a polarized T helper Type 1 (Th1) lymphocyte response, with increased production of IFN-g, IL-2, IL-12, and IL-18 (7) . Chemotactic and proinflammatory effector and regulatory cytokine signals lead to recruitment of additional monocytes and lymphocytes to the lung, macrophage differentiation into epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells, and eventually granuloma formation. More recently, studies have suggested that Th17 effector T-cell responses may contribute to sarcoidosis pathobiology, but whether these responses are critical to disease pathogenesis or play a role in shaping clinical phenotype remains uncertain (8, 9) .\n\nBoth genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers are thought to cause sarcoidosis. Independent molecular and immunologic investigations have suggested the association of pathogenic mycobacteria with some cases of sarcoidosis (10) . GRADS study investigators have contributed molecular evidence of mycobacterial RNA, DNA, and proteins in sarcoidosis tissues that are not found in control nonsarcoidosis tissues (11) (12) (13) . Several research groups have reported enhanced Th1 immune responses to specific mycobacterial proteins in subjects with sarcoidosis compared with control subjects (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Several studies show significant overlap between the transcriptome of patients with sarcoidosis and patients with tuberculosis (19) (20) (21) . Japanese investigators have reported a strong linkage of propionibacteria and sarcoidosis among Japanese subjects (22, 23) . However, there is no consensus on the role of microbial infection in sarcoidosis. Whereas some research groups promote the idea that chronic sarcoidosis results from an active, replicating mycobacterial or propionibacterial infection that may respond to antimicrobial therapies, others posit that sarcoidosis results from a hyperimmune Th1 response to tissue antigens (including those from remnant microbial antigens) that does not involve an active, ongoing infection (6, 24) .The latter possibility may be associated with an aberrant innate response involving aggregation of serum amyloid A within granulomas (6, 25) . These studies highlight the potential importance of interactions between the lung microbiome and genomic regulation in determining clinical phenotype and course in sarcoidosis, both of which are areas of focus in the GRADS study.\n\nIn recent studies, researchers have used genome-wide transcriptome profiling to better define sarcoidosis pathogenesis. \n\nThese studies have confirmed an association with Th1 genes and pathways known to be relevant in sarcoidosis, including T-cell receptor pathways; cell signaling and proliferation; and cytokine genes, including IFN-g (26, 27) . GRADS study investigators evaluating peripheral blood gene expression in sarcoidosis found patterns of gene expression that are associated with disease severity (26, 27) and disease course (26) . Together, these studies support the promise of the GRADS study to discover new molecular signatures to define sarcoidosis phenotypes and outcomes.\n\nHuman Microbiome\n\nThe microbiome refers to the set of microbial agents and their genes contained in an environment (2) , and the term metagenomics refers to the analysis of genetic material recovered directly from an environment. Standard microbiologic and virologic methods can detect only a small proportion of the bacteria and viruses present in various body sites because the great majority of these organisms are uncharacterized or uncultivable. Thus, in practice, microbiomic studies rely on the use of metagenomic approaches-that is, sequence-based rather than culture-based approaches-to investigate microbial communities. Microbiomic studies may focus on fully enumerating all microbial agents in a body habitat through use of sequence tags that are shared between organisms within a group, such as the 16S ribosomal rRNA gene shared by all bacteria and archaea, or can define all of the genes within a community through \"shotgun\" metagenomic sequencing of all genetic material present (28) (29) (30) (31) . Metagenomics has provided insight into the complex composition of the microbiome of several body sites, and this information has allowed us to draw tentative conclusions about the relationship between specific microbiomes and health (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) . Understanding of the overlap and degree of communication between these microbiome niches is rudimentary at best. Perhaps the most extensively studied human microbiome is the human gut microbiome (37) , where the interaction of the gut microflora, independently or through interaction with the genetic makeup of the host, plays a role in obesity, Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis (38) (39) (40) (41) .\n\nIn contrast to the extensive literature about the gut, much less is known about the composition of the microbial population of the lower respiratory tract in health or disease. It is likely that there are undetected organisms as well as complex relationships between the multiple pathogens seen in patients with chronic lung diseases. Although the healthy lung has traditionally been thought to be sterile, emerging data suggest that the microbial DNA present in the healthy lung closely resembles that of the oropharynx, but in markedly lesser amounts, perhaps resulting from microaspiration that occurs even in healthy individuals (42, 43) . Researchers have also detected the presence of unique organisms such as Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple disease, in the lungs of some healthy people (42, 43) Studies of the lung microbiome are challenging, given the difficulty in distinguishing true residents of the lung versus those organisms that are carried over from the mouth by the bronchoscope, as well as difficulties of environmental contamination, given the low biomass of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples.\n\nRecent studies support the emerging concept that the lung microbiome is altered in lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cystic fibrosis (44-49), but little is known about the microbiome in other lung diseases, such as sarcoidosis. The presence of a chronic granulomatous inflammatory response in the lung in sarcoidosis has long suggested that infectious agents are important in sarcoidosis; to date, however, no culturebased studies have directly proven an infectious pathogenesis of the disease. In contrast to the limitations of traditional microbial cultures, culture-independent techniques have the capacity to enhance understanding of the identity and complexity of the microbial community within the lung in patients with sarcoidosis. Use of unbiased 16S sequencing in sarcoidosis has been examined in only one study (50) . The investigators in that study did not find dramatic changes in the lung microbiome, but they examined only seven patients with sarcoidosis. Larger studies that encompass the multiple phenotypes of sarcoidosis are needed to determine the role of the microbiome in this disease.\n\nAs indicated above, published studies suggest that the lung microbiome and genomic network interactions are likely to play critical roles in disease pathogenesis and determining clinical phenotypes in sarcoidosis. However, the current state of knowledge in these areas is rudimentary. The goal of the GRADS study is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the microbiome and genomic patterns and their interactions \n\nin well-defined sarcoidosis phenotypes. Among the questions to be addressed are the following: How does the lung microbiome contribute to the phenotypic landscape? What are the critical interactions between the lung microbiome and host immune response networks that contribute to clinical phenotype and, particularly, clinical outcome? Are there genomic or microbiome signatures associated with clinical phenotype or outcome?\n\nTo begin to answer these questions, the study investigators outlined the following aims: (1) to identify peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression patterns that characterize distinct sarcoidosis phenotypes; (2) to determine whether patterns in the lung microbiome are associated with sarcoidosis severity and disease phenotypes; (3) to correlate mRNA and microRNA expression patterns in sarcoidosis-affected organs with changes in microbiome, clinical parameters, and PBMC gene expression patterns; and (4) to integrate clinical, transcriptomic and microbiome data to identify novel molecular phenotypes in sarcoidosis.\n\nThe aims of the GRADS study are to understand how genomic and microbiomic relationships associate with clinical phenotype, so it was necessary to define specific phenotypes important to the study. Not all manifestations could be included, owing to disease heterogeneity and the limited sample size of the study. The Sarcoidosis Protocol Development Committee prioritized nine phenotypes (Table 3 ) on the basis of considerations described in the paragraphs that follow.\n\nFirst, more than 90% of patients with sarcoidosis have involvement of the lung, which is a well-studied site of disease pathogenesis and immune activity; thus, patients with this manifestation dominate our groupings (1, 51). Second, perhaps the most critical phenotypic distinction of biologic importance is the separation of remitting versus chronic sarcoidosis, the latter being disproportionate in its disease impact. Given the limitations of the study that precluded a lengthy follow-up period sufficient to confidently determine a chronic versus remitting outcome, phenotypes with known outcome expectations were chosen. For pulmonary sarcoidosis, we chose to distinguish pulmonary phenotypes on the basis of the Scadding chest radiograph staging system because different stages are associated with differences in outcome (Table 1) . We theorize that the prognostic information reflects changing pathobiologic processes underlying the different radiographic stages. Third, both advanced lung disease with pulmonary fibrosis and cardiac sarcoidosis represent phenotypes that portend the highest mortality associated with sarcoidosis and thus deserve specific attention. Fourth, the effects of treatment were judged to be critical to interpretations of genomic and microbiome data.\n\nLimitations in any phenotypic grouping of sarcoidosis are readily apparent. The instruments and definitions used to define organ involvement (and thus phenotype) are based on previously published studies (51, 52) but have not been validated in large clinical trials (see online supplement). In part this is due to the fact that instruments and definitions remain a \"moving target\" because advances in imaging continue to improve the sensitivity in detecting inflammatory sites in sarcoidosis. However, not all of these imaging changes have proven clinical, functional, or phenotypic significance. For example, the prognoses associated with the Scadding chest radiograph staging system were first used by international convention in the 1950s and were validated in multiple international studies in the subsequent decades. There is no similar scope of studies in which chest computed tomography (CT) correlates were used for prognostic staging. Despite these drawbacks, we selected the following nine phenotypes based on data from prior published clinical studies, such as A Case Control Etiologic Study of Sarcoidosis (ACCESS) (51) and clinicians' experiences: d Phenotype 1: Multiorgan sarcoidosis.\n\nPatients with sarcoidosis with clinically significant inflammation in many organs may represent one of the purest phenotypes in terms of outcome because they invariably have chronic, unremitting disease. These patients have widespread inflammatory changes, often with the presence of abdominal sarcoidosis (typically with liver, spleen, bone, or bone marrow involvement and subdiaphragmatic lymphadenopathy) along with pulmonary or other extrapulmonary organ involvement. Although the number of organs that define this phenotype will vary with the instruments and definitions used, our intent was to define a group having a high likelihood of representing chronic sarcoidosis. To this end, we settled on five or more organs to meet the criteria for this phenotype, based more on clinical experience than on any specific data. d Phenotype 2: Stage I pulmonary sarcoidosis, untreated. This fundamental phenotype represents a group with active sarcoidosis based on intrathoracic lymph node granulomatous inflammation, but \n\nWe are conducting an observational cohort study to explore the role of microbiome and genomic regulation as they relate to specific sarcoidosis clinical phenotypes. The study was not designed as a case-control study to study the microbiome in sarcoidosis etiology. To achieve the goals of the study, clinical centers are recruiting subjects who meet the initial entry criteria (detailed below and in Table 4 ), including American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society criteria (1), for a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Participants are either (1) classified within the targeted clinical phenotypes defined within this protocol upon review of their clinical information gathered from the initial study visit or (2) excluded from additional study participation. Eligible participants undergo self-administered questionnaires, physical examinations, research chest CT examinations, pulmonary function tests, and blood and urine tests (Table 5 ). Most subjects either undergo research BAL as part of an otherwise clinically indicated bronchoscopy for suspected pulmonary sarcoidosis or are recruited to undergo a research-only bronchoscopy with BAL. In the former group, if a diagnosis of sarcoidosis is confirmed by biopsy, the patient is then entered into the database of participants undergoing full testing and sample collection. If an alternative diagnosis is made for these recruits, they will not undergo any further testing. Participants can elect to undergo bronchial brushings and, if appropriate, skin biopsy of a suspected sarcoidosis skin lesion. Those subjects in the cardiac phenotype group and a subset of Stage IV pulmonary sarcoidosis participants will not undergo bronchoscopy, owing to a higher theoretical risk of bronchoscopic complications. The rationale for collecting BAL, bronchial brushing, and blood samples is clear. High-throughput unbiased analyses of the lung microbiome can potentially identify patterns in the lung microbiome that determine disease activity and persistence as well as response to therapy. Sampling by BAL, bronchial brushing, and oral washing offer the opportunity to compare regional lung microbiome environments in the alveolar compartment with more proximal bronchial wall and oral environments. Focusing on accessible blood cells for genomic analyses enables GRADS study researchers to identify markers for disease phenotype, severity, and outcome that are easily transferable to the clinical arena. In addition, such studies may indicate whether blood sampling can be a surrogate for BAL sample analysis. Analysis of the transcriptomes in sarcoidosis tissues (BAL cells and peripheral blood), the microbiome in BAL fluid, and biochemical signatures in BAL, serum, plasma, and urine provides an opportunity to identify new molecular phenotypes that correlate with disease phenotype and organ system involvement.\n\nTo achieve the aims of the study, we plan a recruitment goal of 400 participants with at least 35 \n\nQuestionnaires Self-administered questionnaires are collected to assess dyspnea, fatigue, and quality of life using published instruments (Table 6 and online supplement). Information on personal and medical risk factors, including demographic variables, current and past medical history, reflux history, and current and past medication use, is obtained. Detailed information on occupational, recreational, environmental, and residential exposures is assessed using modifications of the ACCESS occupational and environmental questionnaires (54) . These variables will be correlated with phenotype-specific associations and with microbiome and genome expression patterns.\n\nPulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis are variable, with different subgroups demonstrating dominant restrictive, obstructive, or reduced diffusing capacity impairment or a mixture of these physiologic impairments. Pre-and postbronchodilator spirometry is performed to assess the degree of bronchodilator responsiveness, which has not been systematically studied in sarcoidosis. To confirm restrictive ventilatory impairment, (a) Have a diagnosis of sarcoidosis established by consensus criteria (ATS/ERS) (1) and confirmed by either biopsy or by manifestations consistent with acute sarcoidosis (L\u00f6fgren syndrome) in absence of other known diagnosis; or (b) have a suspected diagnosis of sarcoidosis and scheduled to undergo biopsy procedure to confirm diagnosis of sarcoidosis using same consensus criteria (ATS/ERS) (1) 3.

Female participants who present ,3 mo after giving birth will be asked to reschedule their visit until 3 mo have passed since the birth. 4. Former smokers who quit ,3 mo before enrollment. \n\nlung volumes are obtained on participants whose slow vital capacity is less than 80% of the predicted value. American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines (55) serve as the primary guidance for the conduct and interpretation of spirometric (56) and lung volume (57) measurements and measurements of the single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (58) .\n\nRadiologic studies include a standard chest radiograph to classify participants according to the Scadding staging system and a research chest CT scan (59) . The chest CT protocol was developed to account for potential scanner variation across the clinical centers and body habitus (Table E1 in the online supplement) (60, 61) . The helical (spiral) chest CT data are acquired with the participants in the supine position during breath holding at end inspiration (or total lung capacity) and without radiopaque contrast dye. Radiation exposure is based on three body mass index categories.\n\nRecruitment Potential study participants having either an established diagnosis of sarcoidosis or who are highly suspected of having sarcoidosis are recruited at the clinical centers through flyers, websites, mailings, and physician referrals. The determination of eligibility for study participation based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in Table 4 . Eligible participants with a confirmed sarcoidosis diagnosis are approached to request consent to undergo the study procedures using one of three consent forms, depending on whether a research bronchoscopy, clinical bronchoscopy, or no bronchoscopy is planned. All recruitment and consenting procedures are compliant with current Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations and were approved by the local institutional review board (IRB) as well as the IRB of the GIC.\n\nA phenotype based on the categories noted above is determined with the use of a modified organ assessment instrument initially developed in the ACCESS study (52, 62) . Eligible participants without a confirmed clinical diagnosis are consented before their clinical bronchoscopy; if a diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy, the participant is enrolled in the study database and completes testing. Participants are asked to consent to a skin biopsy if cutaneous involvement is deemed consistent with sarcoidosis and a biopsy is planned for clinical purposes.\n\nBronchoscopy is performed with the goal of minimizing bias in the collection of samples for microbiome analysis as previously described by GRADS study investigators (43) . Briefly, before anesthesia is induced, the bronchoscopy is preceded by a tongue scraping and an oral rinse to collect microbial communities on the tongue and oral mouth and upper airway. The participant is then asked to gargle with an antiseptic wash for oral decontamination. A sample of the working channel of the bronchoscope is also collected to assess preexisting levels of microbial contamination. BAL is performed using a predesigned algorithm guided by radiographic sites of involvement in the chest radiograph or CT scan, with preferential locations being the right middle lobe and lingula. For those participants who agree to undergo \n\nbronchial brushing, this procedure is performed following BAL.\n\nSamples collected during the study are detailed in Table E2 . Bronchoscopic samples are processed to maximize sample integrity for RNA, microRNA, DNA, and proteins as recently described (63, 64) . A portion of the BAL fluid is centrifuged to separate it into a cell-free BAL fluid supernatant and a BAL cell pellet for microbiome, transcriptomic, and biochemical analyses. For subjects undergoing a clinical bronchoscopy, a portion of the BAL sample is sent for routine clinical tests at the discretion of the bronchoscopist, and the remainder is collected for research purposes. Bronchial brushings are placed in a solution to preserve RNA integrity. Blood is collected by phlebotomy, with aliquots sent to the clinical laboratory for tests typically obtained in assessing patients with sarcoidosis patients (Table E2) . PBMCs are separated using a single-tube separation system, and serum and plasma are stored frozen. Aliquots of whole blood are placed in solutions designed to preserve RNA and DNA integrity. A urine sample is obtained and assayed for cotinine at the clinical site for an objective test of recent smoking. Stool samples are requested from participants who are undergoing research BAL collection for future gut microbiome comparison with the lung microbiome. Samples are shipped to the GIC, where they are stored in a biorepository.\n\nData are entered at the clinical sites using an encrypted, password protected, web-based system. Clinician-rated data are entered into this system from paper forms, and participant-rated data are entered directly into the system via a tablet computer.\n\nRadiographic data are transferred electronically to the GIC in a deidentified format compliant with the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine standard.\n\nData sharing is an important feature of the GRADS study. The GIC has developed a web-based data portal that provides dynamic exploratory cohort selection tools which allow data exploration across a large number of clinical variables. Microbiome and genomic data will be deposited in the appropriate National Center for Biotechnology Information repositories, such as the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes, known as \"dbGaP,\" in accordance with National Institutes of Health policies.\n\nFor the identification of bacterial species within an environment, the amplification of 16S rRNA genes (or 16S rDNA) is useful because this genetic locus is present in all bacterial species. Polymerase chain reaction primers target conserved regions of the gene that are shared by all bacteria but flank hypervariable regions that differ. The nine hypervariable regions of the 16S rDNA can be used for bacterial species identification, with some regions having better discriminatory value than others. In contrast, there are no conserved genes that can be targeted for identification of all viruses; thus, whole shotgun sequencing of a sample enriched for viruses (such as by filtering) can lead to an effective characterization of viral communities. The GRADS study researchers will perform bacterial and viral analyses of oral washes, BAL samples, and environmental control samples to determine differences in microbial community structure in relation to sarcoidosis phenotype and clinical course.\n\nFew studies have incorporated host gene expression and microbiomic data to determine the interactions that occur between host and organisms. By integrating clinical, transcriptomic, and microbiome data, the GRADS study is positioned to identify novel molecular phenotypes as well as genomic correlates of known clinical phenotypes that will form the basis for molecular fingerprints to predict both disease severity and response to therapy as well as patient stratification for clinical trials.\n\nNormalized gene expression levels will be related to established phenotypes and crossphenotype characteristics using linear models (i.e., analysis of variance or linear regression tools). Sample size calculations for the analysis of variance are based on prior data showing that a minimum of 35 samples per group is required for detection with power exceeding 95% for changes of 1.25 or more, allowing for a single false positive and assuming 1,500 genes are truly differentially expressed (65, 66) . Thus, an overall sample size of 400 participants, with a goal of 44 or 45 subjects per phenotype, is planned to allow for incomplete data collection.\n\nFundamentally, the GRADS study is a study of interactions. It integrates state-of-the-art high-throughput microbiome and genomic analyses in well-defined clinical phenotypes with measures of quality of life and environmental variables in a disease with tremendous unexplained clinical heterogeneity. This information is likely to provide a wealth of information on potential mechanistic pathways and interactions that play critical roles in disease pathogenesis and determine clinical manifestations, clinical course, and response to therapy. Future studies based on the data foundation provided by the GRADS study might include the multiple potential avenues of investigation shown in Table 7 .\n\nThe GRADS study is a multicenter collaboration tasked with investigating the role of the lung microbiome and systemwide genome expression in two orphan Table 7 .
