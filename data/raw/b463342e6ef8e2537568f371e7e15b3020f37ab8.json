{"title": "", "body": ". This prospective study will describe the response to 5 major vaccines among a large 74 cohort of adult autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients in a 'real-life' setting. 75\n\n. The impact of pre-and post-transplant factors (i.e. graft-versus-host-disease) on vaccine 76 response will be analysed. 77\n\n. Innovative immune functional assays will assess innate and adaptive immune response 78 of HSCT recipients at the transcriptomic, protein and cellular level immediately before 79 and 3 months after primary vaccination. 80\n\n. Vaccine response will be correlated to the functional immune status. 81\n\n. Immunization will be initiated upon haematologist's referral, which might create a bias 82 of inclusion and impact vaccine response. 83\n\n. Biomarkers of immune functionality could help to optimize vaccine schedules at an 84 individual level. This will have to be addressed and validated in further specific studies. 85\n\n. The results obtained regarding immune response to vaccines will be compared in the 86 future with similar data obtained from further HCST protocols. 87 control healthy volunteers will be enrolled and will be tested for immune functional assays. 149\n\nHealthy volunteers will be recruited among the donors to the blood bank of the 150 Etablissement Fran\u00e7ais du Sang (EFS) of Lyon. According to the EFS standardized procedures 151 for blood donation, informed consent will be obtained from healthy donors, and personal 152 data will be anonymised at the time of blood donation prior to the transfer of blood to the 153 research laboratory. 154\n\nParticipants. The workflow of the VaccHemInf cohort is described in Figure 1 . Recipients 155 aged 18 years or more will be included. During the first visit (V1), explanations will be given 156 on: (i) implementation of the vaccination schedule and pre-blood test assessment, and (ii) 157 post-vaccination assessments at the 3-month (V2), 12-month (V3) and 24-month (V4) visits 158 to monitor vaccine response and tolerance. FIGHT immune functional assays will only be 159 Endpoints. To address the objectives mentioned above, the primary endpoint will be to 163 measure vaccine-specific antibody titres and to express vaccine response in percentage of 164 responders and geometric mean titres (GMT) immediately before and at 3, 12 Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)  184   classification for infections, infectious agent-related reactivations and diseases (updated  185   with the latest guidelines, and which list and full definition criteria are provided in Table  186 1),[16-30] peripheral blood T-and B-lymphocytes subsets and Natural killer (NK) counts (Box 187\n\n3). Event variables will correspond to the applied French vaccination schedule ( 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The second immune functional assay will consist in inducing T lymphocyte proliferation and 219 measuring IFN-\u03b3 release in the supernatant in response to an ex vivo stimulation with a 220 standard mitogen, phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 221 will be isolated from fresh, heparinized blood samples by Ficoll density gradient 222 centrifugation (U-04; Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) and will be incubated with culture medium 223 overnight. Then, PBMCs will be stimulated in duplicate with PHA at 4\u00b5g/mL (R30852801;  224 Remel, Oxoid, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in a 96-well cell culture plate at 37\u00b0C for 72 225 hours. Upon incubation, supernatant will be harvested for IFN-\u03b3 quantification using the 226 ELLA\u2122 platform. Cells will be harvested and cell proliferation will be determined by the 227 incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) at 10 \u00b5M for 2 hours in T cells using the 228 Click-It\u00ae EdU AF488 flow kit (C10420; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA). In first, 229 cells will be stained with allophycocyanin (APC)-labelled anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies 230 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA), fixed with IOTest\u00ae3 fixative solution (Beckman 231 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   12 Coulter, Brea, California, USA), and EdU will be activated with 100 \u00b5L of a reaction cocktail 232 containing Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 (AF488) azide (component of the Click-It). Flow cytometry 233 analyses will be performed on a Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, 234 USA). CD3 + cells will be first selected among total events based on a monoparametric CD3-235 APC histogram. Then, the percentage of EdU + cells among CD3 + cells, along with the 236 geometric means of fluorescence intensity (MFI) of EdU-AF488 in this population, will be 237 measured among 2.5x10 3 CD3 + cells recorded.\n\n[41] 238\n\nUsing the immune functional assay described above, an innovative approach will consist in 239 appropriate with associate 95% confidence intervals (CI). For the GMT, means and 95% CI 291 will be computed for the log10 transformed titres and then transformed back to the original 292 units by exponentiation. For vaccine targets with low to moderate responder rates, the 293 association between responders/non-responders endpoint and factor will be established 294 using logistic regression. All factors associated with endpoint with a significance level p <0.15 295 will be kept for multivariate logistic regression models. These models will be adjusted with at 296 most two or three confounding factors chosen according to evidence-based literature. In 297 case of relapse of the haematological disease, in case of death during follow-up or in case of 298 loss to follow-up, patients will be included in the analysis provided that there is at least the 299 pre-and one or more post-vaccination assessment available. Analyses will be based on two-300 sided p-values, with statistical significance defined by p <0.05 and conducted with R version 301 3.4.4. Finally, appropriate multiple imputations (i.e. at random or not) will be taken into 302 consideration in the case of a relevant amount of missing values. 303 Informed consent. The identification of recipients included in the study will be kept 312 anonymous and protected by a cryptographic code. Data will be anonymously extracted 313 from medical records (HCL software). The informed and signed consent will be registered on 314 the computerized record of each recipient. Full information of the objectives and the 315 workflow of the study will be given and the possibility will be provided to the recipient to 316 refuse to participate or to exit the study whenever chosen. A comprehensive notice will be 317 distributed to the recipient summarising the protocol and the follow-up of the study. 318\n\nDissemination. Results will be communicated at scientific meetings and submitted for 319 publication in peer-reviewed journals. 320\n\nprospective cohort including all consecutive adult HSCT recipients who complete the 324 vaccination schedule and have the full pre-and post-vaccination assessments, 325\n\nindependently of their complications and immunomodulatory therapy, is to test such a 326 schedule in a \"real-life\" setting. Another interest is the long-term assessment of antibody 327 HSCT, the better for immune recovery; secondly, some recipients receive intravenous Igs 331 after transplantation, which may overestimate assessment of serological response to 332 vaccine. We also acknowledge the bias due to the serology methods, notably for 333 pneumococcus, which may be optimized through alternative methods such as the 334 measurement of specific IgG2 antibodies or in vitro opsonisation test. 335\n\nfunctional assays is to measure deeper aspects of the immunity in response to vaccines. 337\n\nPrecisely here, the variables collected in the database will potentially have an impact on the 338 immune function, consequently altering the readout, interpretation, specificity and 339 sensitivity of the assays. The Milieu Interieur consortium has set up preliminary reference 340 ranges of a healthy immune response and its natural variance.\n\n[39] Similarly, in order to map 341 the immune disorders, the 30 healthy donors of the VaccHemInf study will provide a 342 reference panel essential for the evaluation of the \"in-range\" or \"out-range\" scale. In 343 addition, the duration of the follow-up for this current project will last 24 months for a 344 population of patients closely monitored by their referent physicians, with virtually no loss 345 to follow-up. An added value might be to extend the duration of follow-up, upon recipient's 346 agreement, to sustain the quality of information. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that a 347 potential confounder will be the important number of collected variables with a sample size 348 that may not allow complex analysis or may likely be statistically underpowered. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\n74 \uf02e This is a prospective study to describe the response to 5 major vaccines among a cohort 75 of adult autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients in a 'real-life' setting.\n\n76 \uf02e Secondary outcomes of this study will offer opportunity to assess the impact of pre-and 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 134 tetanus and diphtheria) administrated after HSCT using the antibody titre reference method 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   9 159 control healthy volunteers will be enrolled and will be tested for immune functional assays.\n\n160 Healthy volunteers will be recruited among the donors to the blood bank of the 161 Etablissement Fran\u00e7ais du Sang (EFS) of Lyon.
