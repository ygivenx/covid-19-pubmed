{"title": "Molecules and Cells Supplementary Materials", "body": "To identify the aptamer binding region on NS1, ELISA was performed as described in Materials and Methods, with slight modifications. GST-tagged RBD (2-73 amino acids), ED (72-230 amino acids), and mutants (K41A and K41A/R38A) of the NS1 protein were purified as described previously (Woo et al., 2013) . 3\ufffd-Biotinylated RNA aptamers were synthesized by terminal transferase using Biotin-16-dUTP (Roche) (Rosemeyer et al., 1995) . A streptavidin-coated plate was incubated with 100 \u03bcl/well of the selected 3\ufffd-biotinylated aptamer (100 nM in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were blocked with 5% BSA in PBST for 1 h and further incubated with 100 \u03bcl/well of truncated and mutant NS1 proteins (full length, RBD, ED, R38A mutant, and R38A/K41A double mutant at 100 nM in PBS)\n\nfor 1 h at room temperature. The bound aptamers were detected using a GST antibody-conjugated HRP (1:1000 in PBS, Pierce). Then the color developing reaction was performed as described in Materials and Methods. \n\nThe 3\ufffd "}
