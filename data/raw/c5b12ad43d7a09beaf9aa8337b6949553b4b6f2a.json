{"title": "alkaloids from the roots of Ziziphus jujuba", "body": "Cyclopeptide alkaloids are one of the chemotaxonomic specific constituents in Rhamnaceae plants, especially for Ziziphus species. They usually contain a p-or m-ansa 13-, 14-, or 15-membered ring structure that consists of a styrylamine moiety and two or three aamino acid residues (Tan and Zhou, 2006) . In some cases, they possess one or two N-methyl or N,N-dimethyl amino acids. Cyclopeptide alkaloids of Rhamnaceae plants are divided into three types: Ia, Ib, or Ic, according to ring structure size. The Ib-type alkaloids have 13-membered macrocyclic structures composed of a moxystyrylamino moiety, a ring bond amino acid, and a b-oxyproline moiety as an intermediate amino acid. Sedative, antibacterial, antifungal, antiplasmodial, antimycobacterial, and antimalarial effects have been reported for some cyclopeptide alkaloids (Gournelis et al., 1998; Panseeta et al., 2011; Tan and Zhou, 2006) .\n\nZiziphus jujuba Mill. is a common species in the genus Ziziphus and is widely cultivated in southern Europe and Asia, including Russia, India, the Middle East, and China (Outlaw et al., 2002) . Although the fruit is the most widely used part of the plant for food, cyclopeptide alkaloids have been separated from other plant parts, especially from the stem bark. Four Ia-type (frangufoline, scutianine D, jubanine C, and mauritine A) and eight Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids (amphibine H, jubanine A, jubanine B, jubanine E, mucronine D, nummularine A, nummularine B, and zizy-phine A) have been isolated and reported from the Z. jujuba stem bark (Devi et al., 1987; Pandey et al., 2008; Tripathi et al., 2001; Tschesche et al., 1976) . However, the chemical constituents of Z. jujuba roots have been rarely reported. To the best of our knowledge, only one publication has reported cyclopeptide alkaloids from the Z. jujuba root. These alkaloids are mauritine A and seven Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids: mucronine D, amphibine H, jubanine A, jubanine B, jubanine D, nummularine A, and nummularine B (Khokhar et al., 1994) .\n\nIn this paper, the isolation and structural elucidation are described of five new Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids (1-5) with three known cyclopeptide alkaloids (6-8) (Fig. 1) . Antiviral evaluations against PEDV are also reported.\n\nAir-dried pulverized roots of Z. jujuba were macerated with MeOH before preparing the alkaloid fraction with an acid-base method from the MeOH extract. This alkaloid fraction was subjected to silica gel column chromatography eluted with increasingly polar mixtures of CHCl 3 /MeOH. Further purification was performed using Sephadex LH-20 and preparative HPLC. As a result, eight cyclopeptide alkaloids (1-8) were isolated and chemically characterized. The UV spectra of 1-8 showed absorption bands at around 270 and 320 nm, which were caused by the characteristic styrylamine chromophore (Panseeta et al., 2011) . All eight compounds, therefore, could be 13-membered cyclopeptide alkaloids. This is because these absorption bands are not observed with 14-membered rings due to the strain of the ring system, except when there is a tryptophan moiety (Gournelis et al., 1998) . Three aromatic protons of the cyclopeptides exhibited an ABX spin system, e.g. d H 6.70 (1H, d, J = 3.2 Hz, H-12), d H 6.87 (1H, d, J = 9.2 Hz, H-15), and d H 6.80 (1H, dd, J = 3.2, 9.2 Hz, for 1 (Table 2 ). This suggests that compounds 1-8 had a moxystyrylamino moiety, which then suggests that they are 13membered cyclopeptide alkaloids (Lin et al., 2000) . In addition, based on 1 H-1 H COSY and 1 H-13 C HMBC spectroscopic data analyses and comparison with previously reported chemical shift analogs, the presence of a b-oxyproline moiety is possible for compounds 1-8 (Tan and Zhou, 2006) . Thus, compounds 1-8 were confirmed as Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids. The olefinic protons (H-1 and H-2) of 1-8 showed coupling constants (J) near 9.0 Hz, and a double bond geometry in styrylamino moieties were indicated to be in Z configurations.\n\nCompound 1 was obtained as a white amorphous powder with molecular formula C 28 H 41 N 5 O 6 , as indicated by ESI-qTOF-MS. From the analysis of 1 H, 13 C, 1 H-1 H COSY, and 1 H-13 C HMBC NMR spectroscopic data (Fig. 2) , two valines and one terminal N-methylalanine moiety were suggested in 1 ( Table 1 ). The HMBC correlations between H-3 to C-4, H-6 to C-7, and H-9 to C-11 indicated linkages between a m-oxystyrylamino moiety and a valine, the valine and a b-oxyproline, and the b-oxyproline and the m-oxystyrylamino moiety, respectively. A NOE relationship between H-18 and H-21 was observed, which agreed with the b-oxyproline connection with another valine moiety. Thus, structure 1 was established as shown in Fig. 1 . The CD spectrum of 1 exhibited two negative Cotton effects around 265 and 321 nm, suggesting 5S,8S,9S-configurations (Schmidt et al., 1983) . No significant NOE enhancements were observed between H-5/H-8 and H-8/H-9 in the NOESY spectrum. This supported the 5S,8S,9S-configuration. A weak vicinal coupling between H-8 and H-9 (J = 3.2 Hz) suggests a trans orientation (Suksamrarn et al., 2005) . To confirm the configuration, acid hydrolysis of 1 was performed. The hydrolysate of 1 was treated with the D-FDLA (N a -(5-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-D-leucinamide) or L-FDLA (N a -(5-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-leucinamide) and the reaction products were analyzed by LC-MS (Fujii et al., 1997) . D-FDLA derivatives are retained longer than the L-FDLA derivatives on C-18 reverse phased HPLC, exhibiting amino acid residues of 1 as L-Val and L-N-Me-Ala, respectively. As a result, the configuration of compound 1 is shown in Fig. 1 . Compound 1 was named jubanine F after its plant origin.\n\nThe molecular formula of compound 2 was determined to be C 29 H 43 N 5 O 6 by ESI-qTOF-MS. Compared to the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of 1, 2 differed in only one amino acid residue. Instead of a valine, two methyl (d C 10.8 and 15.1), one methylene (d C 24.5), and one methine (d C 37.4) signals were observed. 1 H-1 H COSY analysis indicated that these comprised an isoleucine residue. The HMBC cross-peaks of H-3 to C-4, H-6 to C-7, and H-22 to C-23 indicated connections between a m-oxystyrylamino moiety with a valine, the valine with a b-oxyproline, and an isoleucine with a Nmethylalanine, respectively. The absolute configurations of C-5, C-8, C-9, C-21, and C-1 000 were identified as S, S, S, S, and S by CD and advanced Marfey's method. However, 2 contained an isoleucine residue, and the absolute configuration at C-1 00 was determined by chromatographic analysis on GITC (2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-b-Dglucopyranosylisothiocyanate) derivatives (Hess et al., 2004) . The GITC derivatives of L-Ile and L-allo-Ile eluted very closely and co-injection experiments proved that the configuration of the Ile residue was L-Ile (21S, 1 00 S) instead of L-allo-Ile (21S, 1 00 R). Compound 2 was named jubanine G. The molecular formula of compound 3 was determined as C 30 H 45 N 5 O 6 by ESI-qTOF-MS. Since it is similar to compounds 1 and 2, it was determined that 3 has two isoleucine moieties as the ring bound amino acid and the intermediate amino acid residues, respectively. The absolute configurations of 5S, 8S, 9S, 21S, 1 0 S, 1 00 S, and 1 000 S were identified by the same methods for 1 and 2. Compound 3 was named jubanine H.\n\nThe molecular formula of compound 4 was determined to be C 30 H 45 N 5 O 6 using ESI-qTOF-MS. Different from compounds 1-3, compound 4 has N-methyl signals (d H 2.17, s) equivalent to six protons. Thus, 4 was deduced to have a terminal N,N-dimethylalanine instead of a mono-methyl substituted one. Additionally, the presence of a valine and an isoleucine residue was inferred from 1 H, 13 C, 1 H-1 H COSY, and HMBC NMR spectroscopic data. The links between a m-oxystyrylamino moiety with an isoleucine, the isoleucine with a b-oxyproline, and a valine with a N,N-dimethylalanine were respectively confirmed through HMBC interactions of H-3 to C-4, H-6 to C-7, and H-22 to C-23. The absolute configurations of 5S, 8S, 9S, 21S, 1 0 S, and 1 00 S were identified by the same methods as used for the previous compounds 1-3. The absolute configuration of N,N-dimethylalanine was confirmed by chromatographic analyses of the N,N-dimethylalanine with phenylglycine methylester hydrochloride (PGME) amide coupling products (Um et al., 2013) . The PGME derivatives of the synthetic N,N-dimethylalanine were analyzed by LC-MS and the synthetic amides of Land D-N,N-dimethylalanine had retention times of 8.83 min and 10.24 min, respectively. The N,N-dimethylalanine-PGME amide derived from compound 4 was detected at 8.79 min. Thus, the absolute configuration of N,N-dimethylalanine in compound 4 was identified as l (S) and compound 4 was named jubanine I.\n\nThe molecular formula of compound 5 was determined to be for C 31 H 47 N 5 O 6 utilizing ESI-qTOF-MS. Similar to compound 4, compound 5 was deduced to have a terminal N,N-dimethylalanine residue, which was confirmed by amino acid hydrolysate analysis. Two isoleucine residues and their spin systems with styrylamine, boxyproline, and terminal N,N-dimethylalanine moieties were inferred by COSY and HMBC correlations. The absolute configuration of the two isoleucine residues and a N,N-dimethylalanine residue in compound 5 were also determined by the chromatographic analysis on GITC and PGME derivatives. The absolute configurations of C-5, C-8, C-9, C-21, C-1 0 , C-1 00 and C-1 000 of 5 were all identified as S. Compound 5 was named jubanine J.\n\nAfter comparing NMR spectra with previously reports, known compounds 6 and 7 were identified as nummularine B (Panseeta et al., 2011) and daechuine-S3 (Lee et al., 2001) , respectively. Compound 8 was identified as a compound previously isolated and reported, but not given a trivial name (Barboni et al., 1994) . For convenience, compound 8 is named mucronine K, after the plant name in which this compound was first isolated. Pocrine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection in pigs causes epidemic diarrhea, dehydration, and vomiting. Most newborn piglets infected by PEDV would be dying with almost 100% mortality and pigs of all ages are also affected. Infection with this virus has been become a serious economic loss in the swine industry and recent outbreaks led to serious economic losses in many swine producing countries. Only compounds 1-3, and 6 were screened for their antiviral potential against PEDV, due to the scarce amounts of other compounds that were obtained. Compounds 2, 3, and 6 showed potent inhibitory effects on PEDV infected Vero cells, as shown in Table 3 . Compounds 3 and 6 showed EC 50 values at the micromolar range (EC 50 4.49 \u00b1 0.67 and 6.17 \u00b1 0.50 lM, respectively), which was potent as compared to the positive control 6-azauridine (5.58 \u00b1 0.53 lM). However, both compounds showed much lower cytotoxicity (CC 50 211.26 \u00b1 29.64 and 165.30 \u00b1 16.49 lM, respectively) compared to the positive control (44.47 \u00b1 6.11 lM), so they had higher selective index (SI) values (47.11 \u00b1 0.49 and 26 .75 \u00b1 0.54, respectively) than 6-azauridine (7.98 \u00b1 0.37). Compound 2 exhibited lower potency than 3 and 6 (EC 50 13.41 \u00b1 1.13 lM), but 2 also demonstrated high SI values due to the very low cytotoxicity (CC 50 > 400 lM).\n\nIn the phytochemical investigation herein of the Z. jujuba roots, five new Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids were isolated with three known cyclopeptide alkaloids. Among the isolated compounds, three new and one known alkaloids were subjected to in vitro antiviral assays. Three compounds showed potent inhibitory activities against a swine-infecting coronavirus, PEDV. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the antiviral activities of plantderived cyclopeptide alkaloids.\n\nColumn chromatography (CC) was carried out with Kieselgel 60 silica gel (40-60 lm, 230-400 mesh, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and Sephadex LH-20 (25-100 lm, Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA).\n\nTLC was performed on the Kieselgel 50 F254 coated normal silica gel (Merck). The preparative HPLC system consisted of a G-321 pump (Gilson, Middleton, WI, USA), a G-151 UV detector (Gilson), and a XBridge Prep C18 column (250 mm \u00c2 10 mm i.d.; 5 lm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). All solvents (analytical grade) were purchased from Daejung Chemicals & Metals Co. Ltd. (Si-heung, Korea). NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AMX 500 and 600 spectrometers (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). High resolution ESI-qTOF-MS were obtained by a Waters Xevo G2 qTOF mass spectrometer (Waters MS Technologies, Manchester, UK). UV and CD spectra were obtained using a Chirascan and CD spectrometer (Applied photophysics, Surrey, UK). Optical rotations were taken on a JASCO P-2000 polarimeter (JASCO, Easton, MD, USA). IR spectra were recorded on JASCO FT/IR-4200 spectrometer. Advanced Marfey's reagent (D-FDLA and L-FDLA) and GITC were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The (S)-(+)-Phenylglycine methyl ester hydrochloride [(S)-(+)-PGME] reagent was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The absolute configuration of amino acids was analyzed using Agilent 6120 quadruple MSD consisting of the 1260 Infinity pump, 1260 Infinity autosampler, 1260 Infinity DAD detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), a Phenomenex column (Luna 5l C18 (2) 100 \u00c5 New Column, 4.6 mm \u00c2 100 mm, i.d.; 5 lm, Sungmoon Systech Co. Ltd., Seoul, Korea), and an Openlab ChemStation (Agilent) for data acquisition and processing. \n\nPowdered dried roots of Z. jujuba (14.5 kg) were extracted through maceration with MeOH (2 \u00c2 60 L, for one week each) at rt. A crude extract (0.5 kg) resulted from extraction solvent removal. The extract was suspended in H 2 O and acidified with 1 N HCl to pH 3-4. The acidic solution was firstly extracted with EtOAc to yield the EtOAc fraction (186.2 g). The aqueous residue was basified with NaOH to pH 9 and extracted with CHCl 3 to provide the alkaloid fraction (1.7 g), with the latter subjected to silica CC eluted with increasingly polar CHCl 3 -MeOH combinations (30:1, 10:1, 5:1, 3:1 and 1:1) to yield four subfractions, A1-4. Subfraction A3 (348.5 mg) was separated by Sephadex LH-20 CC eluted with CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH (3:1) to give five fractions, A3a-A3e. A3c was purified by a preparative HPLC (0.1% NH 4 Ac in H 2 O-MeCN, 7:3, 4 mL/min) to yield 1 (7.8 mg), 2 (53.1 mg), 3 (6.9 mg) and 6 (13.5 mg). A2 (207.8 mg) was subjected to Sephadex LH-20 CC eluted with CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH (3:1) to give four subfractions, A2a-A2d. A2b was separated by preparative HPLC (0.1% NH 4 Ac in H 2 O-MeCN, 3:2 to 1:4, 4 mL/min) to yield 4 (2.7 mg), 5 (2.0 mg), 7 (1.6 mg), and 8 (2.0 mg). \n\nThe cell viability was calculated using a MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay. Vero cells were adhered at 1 \u00c2 10 5 cells per well in 96-well plates and grown for 24 h before treatment. The cells were treated with various concentrations of compounds. To avoid solvent toxicity, the final DMSO concentration was maintained under 0.05% (v/v) in the culture medium. After incubating further for 48 h, MTT solution (2 mg/mL, 20 lL) was added to each well and kept for 4 h. After removing the supernatant, DMSO (100 lL) was added to solubilize formazan crystals. Consequently, the absorbance was measured at 550 nm. The percentage cell viability is the absorbance in the experiment well compared to that in the control wells and compound toxicity is the percentage cell viability. Regression analysis was used to calculate 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ).\n\nVero cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at 1 \u00c2 10 5 cells per well. The medium was removed a day later and washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). PEDV at 0.01 MOI was inoculated onto near-confluent Vero cell monolayers for 2 h. The media was replaced by DMEM with various concentrations of compounds. After incubating for 72 h at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO 2 atmosphere, cells were replaced with DMEM and MTT (2 mg/mL, 20 lL) to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) was calculated using regression analysis, and the formula SI = CC 50 /EC 50 determined the selective index (SI)."}
