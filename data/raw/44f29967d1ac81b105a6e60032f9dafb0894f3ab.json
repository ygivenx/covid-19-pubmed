{"title": "MERS-CoV spike nanoparticles protect mice from MERS-CoV infection", "body": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic respiratory virus that was first identified in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012 [1] . As of February 10 th 2017, there have been 1905 confirmed MERS-CoV cases, with 677 deaths across 27 countries (http://www.who.int/). Currently, there are no approved vaccines or treatments for MERS-CoV [2, 3] .\n\nMERS-CoV spike (S) protein on the virion surface is the main attachment factor for virion entry through binding to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) on the host cell [4] . As such, MERS-CoV S has been a prime target for vaccination strategies [reviewed in 5] and we have previously reported an S protein vaccine candidate that was able to induce high levels of anti-MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in mice [6] .\n\nA major problem for MERS-CoV treatment or vaccine testing in vivo is that mice are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection [7] because mouse (m)DPP4 is not a functional MERS-CoV receptor [8] . MERS-CoV S binding to mDPP4 is inhibited by glycosylation on two mDPP4 residues which are hypothesized to physically inhibit binding of MERS-CoV S to mDPP4 [9] . Therefore, mouse model development has focused on humanizing mDPP4. Mice can be made susceptible to MERS-CoV infection by adenovirus transduction of human (h)DPP4 into the lungs of mice [10] . Though hDPP4 expressing mice display only mild clinical symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, there is robust MERS-CoV replication in the lungs of the mice [10] , making them useful for testing treatments or vaccines that block MERS-CoV replication in the lungs [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .\n\nIn this study we vaccinated mice with MERS-CoV S nanoparticles and showed protection from MERS-CoV infection in vivo.\n\nThe Jordan strain of MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV-Hu/Jordan-N3/2012) was kindly provided by Dr. Kanta Subbarao (NIH, Bethesda, MD), Dr. Gabriel Defang (NAMRU-3, Cairo, EG), Dr. Michael Cooper (AFHSC) and Dr. Emad Mohereb (NAMRU-3).\n\nStocks of MERS-CoV(Jordan) were grown and quantified using Vero E6 cells (ATCC #CRL-1586) as described previously [17] . All experiments with live MERS-CoV(Jordan) were performed under biosafety level 3 conditions at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Adenovirus expressing hDPP4 (AdCMVhDPP4) was obtained from the Gene Transfer Vector Core at the University of Iowa.\n\nBALB/c mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and all mouse experiments were performed at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in accordance with protocols approved by the local institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC). \n\nBALB/c mice, 8-10 weeks of age, were intramuscularly vaccinated with either PBS, 1 lg, 3 lg or 10 lg MERS-CoV S nanoparticles with or without 5 lg of Matrix-M1 TM adjuvant (Novavax AB, Uppsala, Sweden), which has been previously described [18] . Mice were vaccinated at days 0 and 21. At 0, 21 and 29 days post-initial vaccination, blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding.\n\nMERS-CoV S-specific antibodies in mouse sera were evaluated in an ELISA as described previously [19] , except that 96-well Max-iSorp microtiter plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated with 2 mg/ ml of purified MERS-CoV S protein and a horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotech) was used as the secondary antibody.\n\nMERS-CoV neutralization assays using days 0, 21 and 29 sera from vaccinated mice were performed as described previously [6] .\n\nOn day 30 post-initial vaccination, vaccinated mice were transduced with AdCMVhDPP4 as described previously [10] . Mice were then intranasally inoculated with 2.5 \u00c2 10 3 pfu of MERS-CoV (Jordan), as described previously [16] . During the experiments, mice were weighed on the day of MERS-CoV infection and every subsequent day. At 3 days post-infection, mice were sacrificed and lungs were harvested as previously described [7] .\n\nLung MERS-CoV titers and levels of MERS-CoV genomic RNA and Leader containing mRNA were determined as previously described [16, 17] . Relative RNA levels were quantified using the DDCt method compared to PBS vaccinated controls.\n\nData were analyzed using the 1-way ANOVA with Bonnferoni post-test in Graphpad Prism 5. Statistical significance was achieved where P < 0.05.\n\nSera collected at day 29 post-initial vaccination were analyzed for anti-MERS-CoV S antibody titers by ELISA (Fig. 1) . As expected, PBS vaccinated mice had no detectable anti-S antibody. While some mice in the non-adjuvanted 1 lg, 3 lg and 10 lg MERS S nanoparticles groups had measurable anti-MERS-CoV S antibody, this response was not statistically significant (P > 0.05 in all cases) when compared to PBS vaccinated controls. Sera from mice vaccinated with the Matrix-M1 adjuvant in combination with 1 lg, 3 lg or 10 lg of MERS S nanoparticles demonstrate significantly higher anti-S titers (for example, P < 0.0001 for 10 lg MERS-CoV S nanoparticles) compared to PBS vaccinated controls with an apparent dose dependent increase. These data demonstrate that the MERS-CoV S nanoparticles along with Matrix-M1 adjuvant produce high titer anti-MERS-CoV S antibody in vaccinated mice.\n\nNeutralizing antibody levels in sera from day 29 post-initial vaccination were assessed using a live MERS-CoV neutralization assay (Fig. 2) . Sera from mice vaccinated with 1 lg, 3 nanoparticles showed significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to PBS vaccinated controls (P < 0.05) and also to the corresponding MERS-CoV S nanoparticles alone (for example, for P < 0.01 for 10 lg MERS-CoV S nanoparticles), with the exception of the 3 lg dose (P > 0.05) because 2 mice showed low levels of antibody in the 3 lg MERS-CoV S nanoparticles plus Matrix M1 group. Within the adjuvant groups, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody levels in mice vaccinated with 1 lg, 3 lg or 10 lg MERS S nanoparticles. These data suggest that mice vaccinated with MERS S nanoparticles in combination with Matrix-M1 produce MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies.\n\nWe utilized a MERS-CoV model in which an adenovirus expressing hDPP4 is used to transduce mice [10] to assess MERS-CoV replication in vaccinated mice (Fig. 3) . As expected, there was no weight loss observed from the infection (Fig. 3A ), but we achieved efficient replication of MERS-CoV in PBS vaccinated mice, as demonstrated by MERS-CoV titer (Fig. 3B) , MERS-CoV Leader mRNA expression (Fig. 3C ) and genomic RNA expression (Fig. 3D ). Mice vaccinated with 1 lg, 3 lg or 10 lg MERS-CoV S nanoparticles showed statistically significant (P < 0.001) reductions in MERS-CoV titer (Fig. 3B) , MERS-CoV genomic RNA (Fig. 3C) and MERS-CoV M mRNA (Fig. 3D) , however, in all cases, there was detectable MERS-CoV in the lungs of the vaccinated mice. When mice were vaccinated with Matrix-M1 in combination with 1 lg, 3 lg or 10 lg MERS-CoV S nanoparticles, with the exception of two mice in the 3 lg group, MERS-CoV titer (Fig. 3B) and MERS-CoV genomic RNA (Fig. 3C) and MERS-CoV M mRNA (Fig. 3D) were reduced to baseline levels ( P< 0.001), suggesting that MERS-CoV replication was completely blocked in the lungs of the vaccinated mice. These data suggest that the MERS-CoV S nanoparticle vaccination, in combination with the Matrix M1 adjuvant, is able to block MERS-CoV replication in the lungs of vaccinated mice.\n\nHighly pathogenic coronaviruses have caused significant problems to public health with the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for MERS-CoV, however both vaccine and drug candidates have been shown to be effective in vitro and/or in in vivo animal models [2, 3] . The S protein of MERS-CoV is a prime target for vaccination strategies because it is the main attachment factor and is expressed on the virion surface. Therefore, various vaccination strategies have been tested for eliciting an anti-S response [5] . We have previously described that MERS-CoV S nanoparticles are able to induce a strong neutralizing antibody response to MERS-CoV [6] , however these were not tested in an in vivo model of MERS-CoV infection.\n\nMice are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection because mDPP4 is not a functional receptor for MERS-CoV [8] . DPP4 susceptibility to MERS-CoV S binding is correlated with the glycosylation of critical DPP4 residues [9] , therefore there are few options to make mice susceptible to MERS-CoV. hDPP4 can be expressed in the lungs of mice using an adenovirus vector [10] . In this model, there is robust replication of MERS-CoV in the lungs of the transduced mice that can be detected by both plaque assay and MERS-CoV RNA expression [16] . Therefore, we used this model to test the MERS-CoV S nanoparticle vaccine in vivo.\n\nIn agreement with our previous study [6] , we found that mice vaccinated with MERS-CoV S nanoparticles developed a MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody response targeted to the MERS-CoV S. In our neutralization assays we see low level non-specific neutralization activity of PBS vaccinated mice however all adjuvanted MERS-CoV S nanoparticle vaccinated mice had significantly higher neutralization activity. Furthermore, Matrix-M1 adjuvant enhances the anti-MERS-CoV S neutralizing antibody response in vaccinated mice. Finally, we demonstrated that mice vaccinated with MERS-CoV S nanoparticles with Matrix-M1 are able to efficiently and completely block MERS-CoV replication in the lungs. The MERS-CoV S + Matrix-M1 nanoparticle formulation is a prime candidate for further development for use in camels or humans.\n\nNovavax Inc. is a commercial enterprise with an interest in commercial vaccine development and funded this study.\n\nCMC, TV and MBF were responsible for the vaccination of the mice and collection of serum.
