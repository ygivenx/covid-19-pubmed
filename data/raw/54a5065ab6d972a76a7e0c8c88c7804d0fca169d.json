{"title": "Identification of B Cell Epitopes in the MSG1 Protein of Mycoplasma suis", "body": "M ycoplasma suis is an extracellular bacterial organism that attaches to and causes deformity and damage to porcine red blood cells. (1) This bacterium mainly infects pigs and is responsible for a disease referred to as infectious anemia. (2) Acute clinical porcine infectious anemia can cause hemolytic anemia and death in young piglets, sows' pre-partum or at weaning, and feeder pigs under stress. (3) In addition, chronic infection is associated with reproductive inefficiency in sows and an increased incidence of respiratory and enteric disease and reduced body weight gain in feeder pigs. (3, 4) M. suis can also infect humans, although people infected by M. suis are symptomless. (5, 6) Adherence of M. suis to the surface of porcine erythrocytes is important to its pathogenicity. (7) Eight M. suis-specific antigens have previously been identified by immunoblot analysis. (8) Among these antigens, M. suis glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase-like protein 1 (MSG1), which is similar to bacterial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPDHs), was identified as the most important adhesion protein of M. suis. The similarity of MSG1 with GAPDHs from other pathogenic mycoplasmas ranged from 52.6% to 54.5% at the amino acid sequence level. (9) In addition, vaccination with recombinant MSG1 protein (rMSG1) elicited strong immune responses in pigs (10) ; however, little is known about the antigenic epitopes present in this protein.\n\nRecombinant MSG1 can be used as coating antigen to detect the antibody against M. suis with indirect ELISA and blocking ELISA. (11, 12) In this study, we developed monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against rMSG1 and used them to identify antigenic epitopes in rMSG1.\n\nBacterial strains, plasmids, cells, animals, and other reagents M. suis crude extracts were obtained from experimentally infected pigs, as previously described, (8) with some modifications. Briefly, splenectomized pig was infected with M. suis and confirmed by microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears stained with acridine orange and PCR for 16S rRNA. When the pig was in bacteremia, blood was collected from the vena cava anterior and diluted at a 1:1 ratio with aseptic Alsever's solution (111 mM glucose, 27.2 mM sodium citrate, 71.8 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.1). Blood cells were sedimented by low-speed centrifugation at 300 g for 15 min at room temperature and plasma and buffy coat were discarded. The pellet consisting of M. suis-laden erythrocytes was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 56\u00b0C for 10 min. M. suis cells in the supernatant were sedimented by high-speed centrifugation at 25,000 g for 120 min at 4*8\u00b0C. The resulting pellet of M. suis was re-suspended in sterile 0.15 M NaCl and stored at -20\u00b0C until use. Blood sample from the non-infected pig was processed in the same manner as negative control. Escherichia coli strains Top10 and Ro-setta2, pET-32a( + ), and Ni-NTA agarose were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The recombinant plasmid, pBAD-msg1 was previously constructed by our laboratory. (12) Mouse myeloma cells (SP2/0) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Female BALB/c mice, 4-6 weeks of age, were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Centre of Nantong University (Nantong, China). Animal experiments were approved by the The recombinant plasmid pBAD-msg1 was transformed into Top10 cells (E.coli/pBAD-msg1) and induced by arabinose as previously described. (12) The recombinant MSG1 (rMSG1) was purified by the Ni-NTA purification system and detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Final protein concentrations were determined by NANODROP2000 spectrophotometry (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).\n\nThe specific anti-MSG1 MAbs were developed and screened according to the standard hybridoma technique. (13) Briefly, His-MSG1 was combined with equal volumes of complete/ incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 0.25 mg/mL. Female BALB/c mice (6 weeks old) were then immunized with 0.05 mg of protein at 2-week intervals for 6 weeks. Mouse myeloma cells (SP2/0) were fused with spleen cells from immunized BALB/c mice to generate hybridomas. ELISA plates were coated with purified rMSG1 protein and E.coli/pBAD lysate (as the negative control) and incubated with the hybridoma supernatant. The sera isolated from immunized mice and the supernatant of SP2/0 cells were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Criteria for anti-MSG1 sera were as follows: the OD 450 of the positive control was greater than 1.0, and the OD 450 of the negative controls were lower than 0.2. Samples, giving an S/N ratio value higher than 2.1, were considered to be positive.\n\nWestern blot analysis was used to identify MAbs targeting rMSG1 and whole M. suis. Whole M. suis, rMSG1, and E. coli/pBAD lysate (negative control) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Pall Corp., Port Washington, NY). The membranes were then incubated with the various purified MAbs, supernatant of SP2/0 cells, and positive and negative rabbit polyclonal antibodies against MSG1. After washing, membranes were incubated with HRP-tagged goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG secondary antibody and the colorimetric reactions were developed using chemiluminescence luminal reagents (Super Signal West Pico Trial Kit, Pierce, Rockford, IL).\n\nBroad epitope mapping with overlapping MSG1 protein fragments\n\nIn order to identify the minimal antigenic epitopes recognized by MAbs, a series of primers (Table 1) were synthesized to amplify different fragments of MSG1 gene (Fig. 1) . PCR products were separately cloned into a pET-32a expression vector with EcoRI and KpnI sites. The recombinant proteins were expressed in Rosetta 2 strain and identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, and were then used to determine the epitopes recognized by purified MAbs using indirect ELISA and Western blot methods as described above.\n\nDNAStar, MegAlign, and Bioedit were used to align the amino acid sequences of identified B cell epitopes with MSG1 of eight different M. suis sequences and GAPDH from seven different species accessed at NCBI.\n\nDifferences in the level of antibodies between different groups were determined by one-way repeated measurement ANOVA and least significant difference (LSD). Differences were thought statistically significant when p < 0.05. CHANG ET AL.\n\nIn order to determine antigenic epitopes of MSG1, splenocytes from mice immunized against MSG1 were isolated and fused with mouse myeloma cells (SP2/0) to generate hybridomas. After screening these hybridomas for reactivity against rMSG1 by indirect ELISA, positive hybridoma cells were sub-cloned three times by limiting dilution. Four MAbs targeting MSG1 (1C10, 2F10, 4G10, and 10E9) were obtained. Western blot analysis showed that these MAbs specifically reacted with both the purified His-MSG1 protein and crude M. suis extracts (Fig. 2) . The results revealed that MAbs against MSG1 can be generated and used to identify epitopes in MSG1.\n\nIn order to map the minimal sequences of the epitopes recognized by these MAbs, we generated 23 truncated recombinant MSG1 proteins and used them to test the binding specificity of a polyclonal rabbit anti-MSG1 antibody. The polyclonal rabbit anti-MSG1 antibody bound all 23 truncated recombinant proteins and full-length rMSG1 (Fig. 3) .\n\nWe next examined the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies. Western blot analysis revealed that MAbs 4G10 and 10E9 reacted with rMSG1 fragments F1, F3-8, F10, and F11, all of which contained the amino acids I 268 KDGENE 274 . In addition, fragments missing any one of these amino acids (F2, F9 and F12) were not targeted. These data indicated that the amino acid sequence I 268 KDGENE 274 is essential for the binding of these two MAbs (Fig. 4A) . MAb 1C10 reacted with fragments F1, F3, F4, F13, F15, and F16, but not with F2 (aa 1-180), F14 (aa 292-337), or F17 (aa 233-296) (Fig. 4B) . These data suggest that MAb 1C10 recognized the epitope spanning amino acids D 291 THGSVF 297 . Finally, MAb 2F10 bound the truncated fragments F1, F3, F4, F18, F19, F20, F22, and F23, but not F2, F21, or F24. These data suggested that MAb 2F10 recognized the epitope spanning amino acids 251-255 (Fig. 4C) .\n\nTo further identify the antigens targeted by these MAbs, 23 truncated fragments were used as antigens in an ELISA. The OD 450 values of MAbs 4G10 and 10E9 against F1, F3-F8, F10, and F11 were much higher than the values against F2, F9, and F12 ( p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A ). In addition, the binding of MAb 1C10 to fragments F1, F3, F4, F13, F15, and F16 was significantly higher than that to fragments F2, F14, and F17 ( p < 0.01) (Fig. 5B) . Finally, the OD 450 values of MAb 2F10 against F1, F3, F4, F18, F19, F20, F22, and F23 were noticeably higher than those against F2, F21, and F24 ( p < 0.05) (Fig. 5C ). These data confirmed the Western blot analysis and disclosed specific antigenic epitopes recognized by these MAbs. Amino acid differences of identified epitopes in different M. suis strains We next determined the prevalence of these MSG1 epitopes among various M. suis strains. To this end, we aligned sequences of MSG1 from eight M. suis strains, with GAPDH from seven other species. The amino acid sequence L 251 CLKI 255 was highly conserved among all M. suis strains. In addition, the epitopes I 268 KDGENE 274 and D 291 THGSVF 297 were moderately conserved, except for the amino acid differences at positions 273 (N273S) and 296 (V296I) (Fig. 6) . These data confirmed that the antigenic epitopes identified by Western blot and ELISA are highly conserved among MSG1 sequences and highly variable among GAPDH in other species.\n\nMSG1 was previously shown to be a glycolytic, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-like pro-tein. In addition, GAPDH of M. genitalium binds to mucin and is characterized as an adhesion factor. (14) Similarly, GAPDH from group A. Streptococci binds fibronectin, lysozyme, and cytoskeletal proteins such as myosin and actin. (15) (16) (17) Despite the fact that MSG1 is a surface protein with similarities to GAPDH, there are only a few reports demonstrating the functions of MSG1 in M. suis infection. The msg1 gene was reported and the immunogenicity and adhesive properties of its protein product were studied with recombinant protein expressed in E. coli. (18) However, the antigenic epitopes of MSG1 have not been reported to date.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are useful and effective tools for mapping antigenic epitopes of immunogenic proteins. (19) In this study, four MAbs recognizing the rMSG1 were developed and analyzed. Western blot studies demonstrated that these MAbs specifically reacted with M. suis, suggesting they recognized the epitopes on MSG1 of M. suis. The epitope mapping confirmed that MAbs 10E9 and 4G10 recognized the same linear epitope I 268 KDGENE 274 , 1C10 recognized the epitope D 291 THGSVF 297 , and 2F10 recognized the epitope L 251 CLKI 255 .\n\nB cell epitopes are either continuous or discontinuous, resulting from unique protein folding, and are defined as the regions on the surface of the native antigen that could bind to B cell receptors or specific antibodies. (20, 21) Typically, continuous B cell epitopes are short and recognized directly by immunoglobulin. This study revealed that B cell epitopes on MSG1 of M. suis are continuous and one epitope was conserved among all M. suis strain sequences available on NCBI. Meanwhile, the epitopes I 268 KDGENE 274 and D 291 THGSVF 297 were relatively conserved among all M. suis strains, except for the N273S and V296I variations in two of the strains. Further studies should be carried out to confirm the relationship between these epitope variations and their pathogenicity.\n\nWe generated four MAbs against the MSG1 protein of M. suis and identified three MSG1 epitopes (268-274aa, 291-297aa, and 251-255aa). These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the antigenic structure of the MSG1 protein and facilitate development of diagnostic methods for detecting M. suis in the blood and tissues."}
