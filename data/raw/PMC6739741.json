{"title": "Distinct mutation in the feline coronavirus spike protein cleavage\nactivation site in a cat with feline infectious peritonitis-associated\nmeningoencephalomyelitis", "body": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) and is\nwidely considered to be one of the most significant infectious diseases to affect\nthe feline population.1\u20133 It is the most\ncommon infectious disease of the central nervous system (CNS) of cats.4 FCoVs have been reported to exist as two distinct serotypes: type I (more\ncommon) and type II viruses,5 each with distinct biological properties.5,6 Both FCoV serotypes have\ndistinct \u2018biotypes\u2019. These are typically classified as either feline enteric\ncoronavirus (FECV) or feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), with the biotypes\ndiffering based on the severity of infection in cats.7\u20139\n\nInfection with FCoV is common, especially in high-density housing situations such as\nanimal shelters and breeding facilities.10 The FECV biotype transmits readily and causes only a mild infection, with\ntransmission occurring via fecal\u2013oral and possibly other routes.7,11 If the viral infection worsens\nand becomes systemic (typically infecting macrophages), then the virus is classified\nas the FIPV biotype.8 Such viruses are believed to contain an \u2018internal mutation\u2019 that accounts for\nthe altered tropism, although the nature of this mutation is not well understood.12\n\nClinical signs associated with the FIPV biotype can be quite variable and\nnon-specific, and can include fever, lethargy, anorexia, pica, vomiting and diarrhea.13 These clinical signs can be present in either the \u2018wet\u2019, \u2018dry\u2019 or \u2018mixed\u2019 presentations.14 The wet form of FIP is characterized by an effusion in the abdominal and/or\nthoracic or pericardial cavities, and the \u2018dry\u2019 form by the presence of\npyogranulomatous lesions. The \u2018mixed\u2019 form may present with an array of clinical\nsigns. Most commonly, neurologic clinical signs are associated with the \u2018dry\u2019 form\nbut can occur with all presentations and may be the sole clinical sign\nobserved.12,13\n\nClinical features of neurologic FIP can include, but are not limited to, ataxia, head\ntremors, seizures and/or paresis.12,13,15 Ocular lesions may be present\nwith or without lesions in the CNS. FIP-associated pathologic changes to the CNS\ninclude meningitis, encephalitis, ependymitis and choroid plexitis, often with\nconcurrent vasculitis.12,13 FIP presenting with predominantly neurologic clinical signs\nprovides a diagnostic challenge and definitive ante-mortem diagnosis is difficult.\nMRI has been identified as a sensitive method of diagnosis in conjunction with\nclinical signs and cerebrospinal fluid analysis results such as elevated protein\nlevels and neutrophilic pleocytosis.16 However, such findings are still not specific to FIP and may be financially\nprohibitive. FIP may also be considered a diagnosis of exclusion, following\nevaluation of clinical signs, history and physical examination findings and\nbiochemical values.12,13\n\nThis case report describes a cat with neurologic FIP that progressed over several\nmonths. The observations and findings obtained in this case provide support that FIP\ncan present predominantly in the CNS. When molecular techniques are applied to the\nvirus, a propensity for certain mutations can be associated with specific clinical\npresentations or pathological changes.\n\nAn intact female 8-week-old domestic shorthair cat was taken into a foster/rescue\nhome and cohabited a house with approximately nine other cats. The facility had a\nperiodic history of FIP cases, including two deaths in the previous 4 months. The\ncat was co-housed in a large open sunroom containing seven litterboxes, which were\ncleaned once daily. The diet consisted of commercially available dry and canned\nfood, which was separately offered in individual dishes. The cat was not rabies\nvaccinated, but had obtained two feline viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirus and\npanleukopenia vaccinations.\n\nAt 14 weeks of age, the cat was presented to a general practitioner for evaluation of\npoor weight gain, soft stool and upper respiratory tract infection. The cat was\nunderconditioned and weighed 2.5 lb (1.1 kg), with a body condition score (BCS) of\n2/5, despite being active, alert and having a good appetite. Conjunctivitis and a\nyellow mucopurulent discharge from the nares were noted, and the cat had a fever of\n102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C). A fecal flotation was performed owing to the soft but formed\nstool, and no ova or parasites were detected. A complete blood count (CBC) and\nchemistry profile were performed (Tables 1 and 2). The chemistry profile showed marked\nelevations in alkaline phosphatase, alanine transferase and phosphorus levels. A\ndecrease in creatinine and albumin was also noted (Table 1), along with mild anemia and\nmonocytosis. Amoxicillin clavulanic acid (Clavamox drops; Zoetis) 62.5 mg/ml was\ndispensed and administered at 15.6 mg (12 mg/kg) PO q12h for 10 days. Blood\nparameters were re-evaluated at 20 weeks of age using a less defined panel and\nvalues were within the normal range (Table 1).\n\nAt approximately 6 months of age, the cat returned to the general practitioner for\nevaluation of pelvic limb gait abnormalities that had progressed over the previous 2\nweeks. Examination revealed symmetric pulses in both hindlimbs and the presence of a\npain response; however, less of a response was noted on the right side. Paresis was\nobserved in the right hindlimb. When the forelimbs were lifted, the cat was able to\nwalk minimally on the hindlimbs. The cat had severe non-ambulatory paraparesis, with\nmore severe deficits on the right side. No information about spinal reflexes was\navailable. A CBC and chemistry panel were performed (Tables 1 and 2). The chemistry panel revealed\nhypoalbuminemia, a decrease in the albumin:globulin (A:G) ratio, low creatinine\nvalues and hyperphosphatemia. The CBC revealed a slight anemia, monocytosis and\nthrombocytopenia. Platelet clumping was noted upon microscopic evaluation. Meloxicam\n(Metacam oral suspension) was dispensed and a single 0.2 mg dose was administered\norally.\n\nAt 8 months of age, the cat was returned to the general practitioner due to\nprogression of the paraparesis. The client noted further deterioration of the pelvic\nlimb paresis, and now identified \u2018stiffness\u2019 in the thoracic limbs. There was no\ninformation about the pelvic limb reflexes; however, the cat had started to have\noccasional urinary and fecal incontinence. Appetite seemed normal; however, the cat\nremained thin. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 101.5\u00b0F (38.6\u00b0C),\nheart rate of 170 beats per min and respiratory rate of 30 breaths per min. BCS was\n3/9; however, the weight was not noted. Abdominal palpation revealed a large, easily\nexpressible urinary bladder. Neurologic examination findings revealed normal\nmentation with no involuntary movements such as tremors. The cat was still very\nataxic and ambulatory but now tetraparetic, which was much worse in the pelvic\nlimbs. There was no information about cranial nerve abnormalities, and the eyes and\nretinas were within normal limits. From a video provided by the owner (see supplementary material), tail paresis was identified. The lesion was\nconsidered to affect the CNS and was localized as multifocal. A fecal flotation and\ndirect smear were evaluated, with no ova or parasites seen.\nCryptococcus and Toxoplasma antibody titers\nwere performed and were negative.\n\nThe tetra-ataxia and paresis significantly worsened over the next few months.\nAdditionally, the cat now had titubation, tail plegia (see video in the supplementary material) and consistent urinary and\nfecal incontinence. Owing to the grave prognosis, the client elected humane\neuthanasia, at which time the cat was 10 months (40 weeks) of age. A necropsy was\nperformed at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, Cornell University College of\nVeterinary Medicine, and this revealed no significant gross abnormalities outside of\nmild mesenteric lymphadenomegaly. Representative sections of all organs, including\nthe entire brain and spinal cord, were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin from\nwhich sections were cut, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and analyzed via light\nmicroscopy. Immunohistochemistry for FCoV was carried out using monoclonal antibody\nFIPV3-70 (1:1000), AP-Anti-Mouse IgG and Bond Polymer Refine Red Detection (Leica\nMicrosystems).\n\nHistologic examination revealed lesions typical of FCoV infection within the CNS. In\nthe spinal cord, the leptomeninges were diffusely expanded by moderate numbers of\npredominantly plasma cells, admixed with fewer lymphocytes and macrophages, and\nsurrounded by a moderate amount of edema. The underlying white matter was\nmultifocally vacuolated with numerous dilated myelin sheaths, digestion chambers and\nrare spheroids (Figure 1a).\nAt the level of the lateral aperture, the choroid plexus was expanded by large\nnumbers of plasma cells, lymphocytes and macrophages (Figure 1b). The ependyma lining the\nventricular system was effaced by a similar inflammatory population, admixed with\nfibrin, edema and was also forming thick perivascular cuffs often disrupting the\nsub-ependymal parenchyma (Figure\n1c). Immunohistochemistry revealed strong intracytoplasmic\nimmunoreactivity within macrophages associated with the inflammation (Figure 1d). No FIP-associated\nlesions were present in other organs. Non-FCoV comorbid histologic findings were\nchronic enteritis with mid-mucosal fibrosis and mesenteric lymphoid hyperplasia.\n\nMolecular analysis of the viral spike protein was performed at several time points\nduring the study. Fecal samples were collected at 5 months of age (feces #1) and at\n8 months of age (feces #2). Following euthanasia (at 10 months of age) tissue\nsamples were collected, along with a fecal sample (feces #3). A central 156 base\npair region of the spike protein gene, including the critical S1/S2 activation site\nof the virus, was PCR amplified and sequenced as described in Licitra et al,17 with the following modifications: 25 \u03bcl reverse transcription PCRs were\nperformed with qScript XLT 1-Step RT PCR kit (Quantbio). PCR conditions were 20 mins\nat 50\u00b0C, 3 mins at 95\u00b0C and 40 cycles of 10 s at 95\u00b0C, 20 s at 55\u00b0C, 40 s at 72\u00b0C,\nthen 10 mins at 72\u00b0C. PCR products were purified using Diffinity RapidTips\n(Diffinity Genomics).\n\nPCR and sequencing showed the presence of a type I FCoV, based on a sequence\nalignment with reference genomes. The sequence information obtained from this cat is\nshown in Figure 2. The viral\nsequences from the CNS (brain and spinal cord) contained specific amino acid changes\ncompared with other samples (feces, small intestine, mesenteric lymph node and\nkidney). The most notable change was an arginine to methionine (R-M) substitution at\nthe critical P1 activation position,17 corresponding to residue 793. Other changes that correlated with viruses\npresent in the CNS were present in two other positions: 770 alanine to valine (A-V);\nand 786 threonine to alanine (T-A).\n\nHere we report clinicopathologic findings and molecular analysis of a cat with\nprogressive neurologic clinical signs associated with FIP. The cat initially\npresented to the referring veterinarian with respiratory signs and fever, and with\nabnormal liver enzyme function and anemia. At this time FIP was not suspected. These\ninitial signs resolved but were replaced by progressing neurologic signs, which led\nultimately to euthanasia and submission to the study for evaluation of FCoV\ninvolvement. Upon euthanasia, FCoV was found in various tissues in the cat,\nincluding the CNS. However, histologic examination revealed FCoV-associated\npathology only within the CNS, where there was meningoencephalomyelitis,\nependymitis, choroid plexitis and vasculitis. Histological lesions were compatible\nwith a recent report describing meningoencephalitis in four cats with FIP.18\n\nMolecular analysis of the viral spike protein within the tissues identified a\nspecific, functionally relevant amino acid change (R793M), which was only identified\nin tissues associated with the CNS (ie, brain and spinal cord). The R793M mutation\nin the spike protein S1/S2 cleavage-activation site is a major chemical change from\na basic to a hydrophobic residue, and is consistent with an elimination of\nfurin-mediated proteolytic processing of the S protein, as seen by Licitra et al,17 and a proposed change in the activation properties and entry pathway of the\nvirus. It is interesting to note that the R793M mutation was not present in other\ntissues tested in this cat at the time of necropsy but was found in our previous\nstudy (cat ID #08-153990),17 where samples were of neural origin. While biological confirmation is not\navailable, we consider that the other changes found in the viral spike protein from\ncentral nervous tissue of this cat (A770V and T786A) are not related to changes in\nthe activation properties and entry pathway of the virus, as they are not in defined\nfunctional regions of the spike protein and are not markedly different in their\nchemistry. Interestingly, all samples tested from this cat contained a distinct\nleucine residue at position 791 (the P3 position of the furin cleavage site,\ntypically serine or alanine as defined in Licitra et al).17 The relevance of this is currently unclear. Overall, our results provide\nevidence that mutation of the viral spike protein is linked to FIP outcome,\nspecifically in the S1/S2 cleavage-activation site (residues 789\u2013794).\n\nMutations leading to FIP have also been linked to changes in other areas of the spike\ngene (position 1058)19 and in the 3c gene.20,21 To compare our findings for\nthe S1/S2 region to other proposed FIP-linked mutations, we performed additional\nsequencing, which is summarized in Table 3. All fecal samples, as well as a\nkidney sample, contained methionine (M) at spike position 1058, indicating that an\n\u2018enteric\u2019 form of FCoV22 was present in the cat throughout our study. In contrast, samples from the\nbrain and spinal cord contained leucine (L) at position 1058, indicating an FIP\nvirus. An intact 3c gene was found in feces, with the\n3c gene in neural and other tissues truncated and/or deleted\ndepending on the sample tested.\n\nThis case report describes a young cat with neurologic FIP in which detailed clinical\nand molecular characterization of the associated FCoV infection was performed. While\nthe etiology of FIP remains complex and likely involves multiple mutations in the\nviral genome, our results indicate that a specific mutation of the viral spike\nprotein can be associated with infection of the CNS, which may explain the tropism\nto the CNS as opposed to other organ systems."}
