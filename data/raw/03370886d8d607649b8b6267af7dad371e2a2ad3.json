{"title": "Methylation profile of bovine Oct4 gene coding region in relation to three germ layers", "body": "The induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were firstly developed by the Japanese medical scientist Yamanaka and his colleagues in 2006 (Takahashi and Yamanaka 2006) . The morphology, gene, protein expression, epigenetic modifications, cell reproductive activity and differentiate capacity of iPSCs are similar with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) . iPSCs differentiate into three germ layers in vitro through self-renewing; even further develop to chimeric mice and achieve germ line transmission (Liu et al. 2014 ). The first generation of iPSCs was achieved by overexpression of transcription factors infected retrovirus (Yu et al. 2007; Park et al. 2008) . While the cancer ricks of this method lead to develop integration-free iPSCs as the secondary generation. Recently, iPSCs were induced by adding small-molecule compounds into fibroblast cultures (Hou et al. 2013) .\n\niPSCs actually induced cells to ESCs-like states by cellular reprogramming. Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc and Lin28 are the core inducing factors (Kumar et al. 2015) . Oct4 drive the transition from somatic cells to iPSCs together with Nanog and Sox2 (Herreros-Villanueva et al. 2014) . They also promote self-renewal by interacting with other transcription factors and critical cell signaling molecules (Loh et al. 2006) . Sox2 is the co-activator of Oct4 and Oct4/ Sox2 dimer up-regulate the transcription of Oct4 and Nanog (Masui et al. 2007) . Nanog stabilizes the pluripotent network and Klf4 regulates the expression of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog (Kim et al. 2008 ). But recent research shows that Oct4 and Sox2 do not interact during bovine development as well as mice and humans (Goissis and Cibelli 2014) .\n\nAmong these regulators, Oct4 is the only factor that cannot be substituted in cellular reprogramming (Jerabek et al. 2014) and essential for maintaining pluripotency rather than for the initiation of pluripotency (Wu and Sch\u00f6ler 2014) . Its expression in both mRNA and protein levels has a significant increase before the 8-cell stage in zygotic (Palmieri et al. 1994 ) and maintain the condition in all cells throughout the morula stage. While the expression level start to reduce and restrict to the cells of inner cell mass when embryo differentiate into the trophectoderm (TE) (Rosner et al. 1990 ). The Oct4 protein levels transiently increase at the forming stage of primitive endoderm and keep down-regulated until embryo implantation and gastrulation (Palmieri et al. 1994) . At last, Oct4 expression becomes restricted to primordial germ cells (PGCs) (Yeom et al. 1996) .\n\nInterestingly, different Oct4 expression levels induce multi-lineage differentiation; for example, embryo differentiates into endoderm and mesoderm with Oct4 overexpression whereas inhibition of Oct4 leads to trophoblast differentiation (Hawkins et al. 2014) . The transformation of Oct4 expression is mainly regulated by DNA methylation. DNA methylation, no doubt, plays an important role in gene regulation (Robertson and Wolffe 2000) and casts a long shadow over the mammalian embryonic development, which is a biochemical process mainly involving the addition of a methyl group (CH 3 -) to the cytosine (C) or adenine (A) DNA nucleotide by DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) (Xu et al. 2015) . Mostly, DNA methylation occurs at the C5 position of CpG dinucleotides which contain a high frequency of CpG sites termed \"CpG island\" in mammalian cells (Illingworth and Bird 2009) .\n\nBefore fertilization, DNA in the mature egg and sperm cells are hyper-methylated. Then, large scale demethylations occur in a short period of fertilization and becoming fertilized eggs. The state of unmethylated DNA retention to the morula (Santos et al. 2002) , and a mass of de novo methylation may occur immediately until gastrula stage. Nevertheless, DNA methylation affects the transcription of genes by physically impeding the binding of transcriptional proteins to the target genes (Choy et al. 2010 ). More important, methylated DNA may be bound by methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs) to further silencing gene. DNA methylation effects gene expression through the promoter region modification, but more and more researchers began to pay great attention to exon 1 (Basu et al. 2014) . In exon 1, DNA methylation was tightly related to transcriptional silencing (Brenet et al. 2011 ). Zhang et al. (2008 found that transcription regulation of human Oct4 gene took place in both the promoter and exon 1, and the exon 1 region contained more CpG dinucleotides than the promoter region. Thus, it is of interest to find out whether methylations of Oct4 exon 1 affect embryonic development.\n\nIn this study, we took bovine as experimental subject to investigate DNA methylation profile of Oct4 exon 1 as well as to reveal the epigenetic changes of Oct4 exon 1 between different germ layers during development and the influence of these changes on embryonic development, which would provide epigenetic information for bovine embryonic development and cellular reprogramming.\n\nExperiments have been carried out on heart, lung, liver, cerebrum and cerebellum from three fetal bovines and one adult bovine. A pair of methylation primers were designed and 15 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide loci were figured out in the possible CpG island (196 bp) (Figs. 1 and 2-A). Comparison of the original sequences and the sodium bisulfate sequences (Fig. 1) showed different methylated and unmethylated patterns of 15 CpG-dinucleotide loci (namely, CpG 1-CpG 15) in different bovines (Figs. 2-B and 3).\n\nThe detailed information including L-MF, L-Ho, L-He and locus genetic diversity index (L-H) in each CpG-dinucleotide loci of bovine Oct4 gene exon 1 were shown in Table 1. In low age group (A, <60 d) of fetal bovine, the L-MF in different CpG-dinucleotide loci of tissues ranged from 0.067 to 0.889. In advanced age group (B and C, >60 d), methylated percentages in each locus of tissues distributed from 0 to 93.3%. At last, the L-MF of adult bovine (D) ranged from 0.133 to 0.800.\n\nThere were 15 polymorphic methylation numbers in the total of all expected 15 CpG-dinucleotide dinucleotide loci. The numbers of 100 and 0% methylation for different CpG-dinucleotide loci all slightly ranged from 0 to 1. The average of methylation number was from 5.75 to 11.87. The range of methylation percentage (MP) varied from 38.33 to 79.11% (data not shown). At the same time, the average homozygote and the heterozygote of different tissues for each age was stable. Besides, average heredity diversity index (H) waved from 0.432 to 0.666 of advanced age for different tissues compared with other ages. The scope of maximum and minimum MSR were not distinct, while the average of MSR of low age, advanced age and adult bovine were 0.459, 0.438 and 0.431, respectively (data not shown). \n\nAccording to the number of methylated CpG-dinucleotide lo-cus, methylation differences among different germ layers or different developmental stages exist or not by \u03c7 2 -test. From Table 2 , especially for specific CpG-dinucleotide locus, the methylation status of the 3rd, 5th and 9th CpG-dinucleotide loci of low age were significantly different among different germ layers. But there was no significant difference among germ layers for the advanced age. For endoderm and mesoderm, the results demonstrated significant difference of the 3rd, 5th and 9th CpG-dinucleotide loci (P=0.009, 0.009 and 0.050, respectively). While, only CpG-3 locus was significantly different between endoderm and ectoderm. DNA methylation level of two CpG-dinucleotide loci in mesoderm was different with ectoderm, CpG-5 was 0.046 and CpG-9 was 0.033. Moreover, no significant difference existed between different ages except that the low age versus advanced age of endoderm on the 3rd locus was 0.038 (Table 3) .\n\nFrom Fig. 4 , there were two highly significant overall methylation differences for endoderm (P=0.001) and mesoderm (P<0.001) between low and advanced age. Only for low age, different germ layers had highly significant differences between each two of them (P<0.01).\n\nAs shown in Fig. 5 , a total of 11 possible key transcription factors (SPZ1, ZF5F, PLAG, ZFXY, STAF, CTCF, AP2F, MIZ1, KLFS, ZF02 and GCMF) had been found, among which STAF and CTCF were linked to the significant methylation difference locus (CpG-dinucleotide locus) that made disparities between ages. Besides, there were also several loci with difference between germ layers (the 3rd, 5th and 9th) pointed to some important transcription factors (PLAG, STAF, CTCF and AP2F).\n\nDNA methylation is responsible for transcriptional silencing of Oct4 gene expression (Li et al. 2007) to induce multi-lineage differentiation of embryo (Hawkins et al. 2014) . At the same time, DNA methylation of exon 1 is much more linked to transcriptional silencing than the upstream promoter region (Brenet et al. 2011) . Therefore, it is meaningful to study the influence of methylation patterns of Oct4 exon 1 to embryonic development. In this study, we firstly focused on one available CpG island methylation region located in exon 1 of bovine Oct4 gene, rather than the methylation status of Oct4 promoter region which was most detected in available publications (Brenet et al. 2011; Al-Khtib et al. 2012) .\n\nGenerally, the pregnancy of bovine is about 280 d and 50-70 d post coital is a rapid development period. During embryonic development, embryos form three germ layers -ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm -which then go on to form different organs and tissues. In previous studies, Oct4 expression in the adult has been reported in progenitor cells from various somatic tissues including kidney (Sagrinati et al. 2006) , thyroid , lung (Ling et al. 2006 ), brain (Okuda et al. 2004; Davis et al. 2006 ), liver (Bel-trami et al. 2007 , and heart (Beltrami et al. 2007 ). So we chose five different tissues respectively to represent three germ layers during embryonic development: Liver and lung come from endoderm; heart was from mesoderm; cerebrum and cerebellum developed from ectoderm.\n\nIn this study, it was obvious that DNA methylation levels of Oct4 gene exon 1 were highly significant different between any two of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm in low age (P<0.01) (Fig. 4) . On the contrary, no significant difference has shown in the same layers of advanced age (Fig. 4) . It was considered that 60 d was an important boundary for bovine embryonic development. In the meantime, the analysis between low age and advanced age showed highly significant differences in endoderm (P<0.01), as well as in mesoderm (P<0.01) (Fig. 4) . While, no difference in ectoderm meant the development of ectoderm was earlier than endoderm and mesoderm (Fig. 4) . However, the decrease of Oct4 gene exon 1 methylation level from low to advanced age indicated that the tissues came from mesoderm developed rapidly after 60 d. Besides, no significant difference was found between fetus and adult (data not shown), which indicated that DNA methylation patterns remained stable during the development from fetus to adult, and this result was consistent with the report by Corry et al. (2009) that the DNA methylation patterns of Oct4 would stay the same after de nove methylation.\n\nOct4 begins to express in the early fertilization and gradually reduced along with the increased methylation level in embryonic development (Yamazaki et al. 2006 Fig. 4 Overall methylation patterns within bovine Oct4 gene between germ layers and different ages. EN, endoderm; ME, mesoderm; EC, ectoderm. more linked to transcriptional silencing than the upstream promoter region (Brenet et al. 2011) . 11 possible binding transcription factors have been predicted in exon1 (Fig. 5) . Some of them would possibly influence the expression of Oct4 and affect the embryonic development of bovine, such as: PLAG, STAF, CTCF, AP2F and KLFS.\n\nCTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is a highly conserved DNA-binding nucleoprotein with multiple zinc fingers existing in eukaryotes extensively. It is involved in many cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, insulator activity, and regulation of chromatin architecture (Chaumeil and Skok 2012) . CTCF plays an important role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, genetic, epigenetic and tumorigenesis through adjusting and controlling the physiological activity of cells (Wang et al. 2012 ). The cellular reprogramming will be reduced by increasing or decreasing the expression of CTCF (Buganim et al. 2012) . Therefore, the cellular reprogramming will be regulated and controlled by the methylation patterns of Oct4 with CTCF combining or not. The 5th CpG locus of exon 1 provided the binding site of PLAG, STAF and AP2F. PLAG (pleomorphic adenoma gene) possess the most profound characteristics, for instance, to localize to the nucleus, to target a recognition motif in DNA and to activate or repress transcription of downstream target genes from its binding site (Van Dyck et al. 2007) . STAF (selenocysteine tRNA activating factor) has a synergistic effect with RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase III activates gene, in turn, controls the expression of all selenoproteins (Hern\u00e1ndez-Negrete et al. 2011 ). Kelly's research show that STAF is great important for embryonic development to mouse in uterus (Kelly et al. 2005) . AP2F (activator protein 2) deletion mice will die within a few days after the embryonic development completes childbirth, among the reasons for seriousness malformation at head parts or limbs (West-Mays et al. 2002) , diseases caused by the excessive apoptosis of cells (Moser et al. 1995) or tropho-blast cells stopped proliferation (Werling and Schorle 2002) . Furthermore, cells apoptosis occurred in the inappropriate development stages by the lack of AP-2 which exposed the cells in high concentration of c-Myc (Hilger-Eversheim et al. 2000) . Although KLFS (Krueppel-like transcription factors) showed no significant difference on CpG-dinucleotide locus, it could promote the reprogramming by direct interaction with Oct4. In the absence of Klf4 overexpression, interaction of endogenous Klf4 with Oct4 is also required for reprogramming (Wei et al. 2009 ). Therefore, this experiment indicated that DNA methylation may suppress the combination of specific transcription factors to influence the embryonic development inhibit the expression of Oct4 gene.\n\nIn summary, this study firstly expounded the methylation pattern of Oct4 exon 1 in fetal and adult bovines. Three important CpG-dinucleotide loci (the 3rd, 5th and 9th) were predicted to have significant influence on embryonic development. At the same time, 60-d post coital was an important boundary of bovine embryonic development and the development of endoderm and mesoderm lagged behind ectoderm. Moreover, bovine germ layers differentiation was significantly correlated with Oct4 gene exon 1 methylation patterns. Our research provided epigenetic information for further studying bovine embryonic development and cellular reprogramming.\n\nGenomic DNA samples were obtained from fetal bovines and adult bovine from slaughter house in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China. All the animals were healthy, unrelated, male and belong to Qinchuan breed. Different tissue blocks were dissected from the fetal bovines and the adult bovine, and then stored at -80\u00b0C. The crown-rump lengths of the three fetal bovines were measured and the average crown-rump lengths of them were 7.907, 8.476 and 4.567 cm, respectively. According to measurements of bovine embryos and fetuses by age from cow of mixed breeding (Winters et al. 1942; Harvey 1959) , the different gestational ages of the three fetus respectively were 50-60 d of the first one (A, <60 d) and 60-70 d of the other two (B and C, >60 d). At the same time, the one of adult was D.\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from tissue samples (heart, liver, lung, cerebrum and cerebellum) by saturated phenol-chloroform extraction method (Qin et al. 2014 ) and stored at -80\u00b0C. The concentration of the isolated DNA was determined using a spectrophotometer, diluted to 50 ng \u03bcL -1 , and stored at -20\u00b0C for subsequent analysis. A total of 1 000 ng individual genomic DNA was finally treated by Sodium bisulfite using EZ DNA Methylation-Gold TM Kit (ZYMO RESEARCH, California, US) strictly following the manufacture's instruction strictly.\n\nBased upon the bovine Oct4 gene sequence (GenBank accession no. AC_000180.1), a pair of primers were designed by the software Methprimer online (http://www.urogene.org/ methprimer/) (Li and Dahiya 2002) , which covered a possible CpG island methylation predicted region (MPR) in exon 1.\n\nTouch-down PCR was used to amplify the bisulfite-treated DNA, the annealing temperature of which fell from 68 to 52\u00b0C by 2\u00b0C decrease. The target gene was 196 bp (Fig. 2) . After PCR, the amplified fragments were gel-purified and cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, WI, USA). Besides, positive inserts sent for sequencing and alignment analysis each CpG-dinucleotide locus between any two of the sequences.\n\nDNA methylation or unmethylation of different CpG-dinucleotide loci were scored as 1/0, based on this method, genetic indexes for DNA methylation patterns were directly calculated. Locus methylated frequencies (L-MF) have been listed in Table 1 . Besides observed methylation CpG-dinucleotide numbers (OMCN), observed polymorphic methylation CpG dinucleotide numbers (OPMCN), and methylated percentages (MP) have been calculated but not shown. To analyze epigenetic diversity, genetic indexes including locus heterozygosity (L-He), locus homozygosity (L-Ho), and genetic diversity index (H) were calculated by Nei's method (Nei and Li 1979) . The genetic diversity index (H)=-\u03c0 i ln\u03c0 i , in which \u03c0 i expresses the distribution frequency of each amplified methylation in the general population (Pan et al. 2013 ). Methylated share rates (MSR) and Fig. 3 were analyzed by the software MSRcall online (http://www. msrcall.com/) (designed by Ph D Lan Xianyong and Ph D Liu Liangliang).\n\nThe \u03c7 2 -test was used to analyze the methylation differences at each CpG-dinucleotide locus and the entire region among different tissues and gestational ages (Tables 2  and 3 , Fig. 4) .\n\nIn this study, TFSEARCH (ver. 1.3) and the MatInspector database in Genomatix (http://www.genomatix.de) were used to identify the possible trans-acting factors which might bind to the CpG-dinucleotide locus which mapped the possible important transcription factors related to specific CpG-dinucleotide locus."}
