{"title": "Redefining the BH3 death domain as a \"Short Linear Motif\" HHS Public Access", "body": "that BH3-only proteins are sentinels that communicate the status of diverse cellular processes to the effector BCL-2 homologous proteins (reviewed in [12, 13] ). This network structure ensures appropriate responses to multiple signaling pathways and cell stresses to determine cell death.\n\nWithin this bow-tie network, the binding interactions of BH3 motifs are the most extensively characterized because of their clinical relevance to diagnostics and therapeutics. The search for small molecules that mimic the biological effects of BH3 motifs enabled the identification of one of the first druggable protein-protein interaction interfaces [14] . BH3mimetics ABT-737 and ABT-199 bind into the hydrophobic BH3-binding groove on the surface of anti-apoptotic BCL-xL and/or BCL-2 to kill cancer cells [15] \n\n. However, despite having many high-resolution structures of BH3-bound complexes and extensive mutagenesis data to identify critical residues at the interface of both the BH3 and its binding partners [11, [16] [17] [18] , available studies have not exhaustively examined the full range of sequence variability observed in reported BH3 motifs. Without rigorous criteria to accurately predict or exclude candidate BH3-containing proteins, the persistent lumping of nonhomologous proteins bearing putative BH3-like motifs (e.g. [19] [20] [21] ) appears to defy logic. However, unforeseen logic may indeed prevail in this madness by considering an additional. Here, we argue that BH3 motifs share most of the attributes of short linear motifs (SLiMs) and, more precisely, of those SLiMs that are associated with binding events (BOX 2) . Thus, BH3 motifs appear to represent a protein-protein interaction module of broader scope that spreads beyond even the extended BCL-2 family, and potentially to non-metazoan organisms.\n\nThe BCL-2-regulated apoptotic pathway is a therapeutic target in degenerative disorders, infectious and immune diseases and in cancer [1] . It was hypothesized over 15 years ago that BH3 mimetics, discovered through rational design or high-throughput screening, would induce cancer cell apoptosis by targeting anti-apoptotic members. Consistently, cell-permeable peptides corresponding to BH3 motifs from BID or BAD were shown to induce apoptosis in BCL-2 or BCL-xL-expressing cells [14, 94] . Thereafter, synthetic small-molecule inhibitor drugs that bind a hydrophobic pocket on prosurvival BCL-2 proteins (see Figure) were identified and evaluated for their efficacy as cytotoxic agents used alone or in combination with conventional anticancer drugs. A number of such highaffinity antagonists are at various stages of development, the orally bioavailable molecule ABT-199 (which selectively targets BCL-2) being currently in clinical trials with high expectations [95] . Thus, a better appreciation of the complex interplay between the various blocks of BCL-2 proteins successfully identified one of the first \u03b1-helix-mediated protein-protein interaction target sites (with p53/hDM2), and demonstrated that affinitybased screening for small molecules mimicking the BH3 motif was a feasible strategy. As SLiMs, BH3 motifs may be found to interact with proteins that do not adopt the BCL-2 structural fold, as recently suggested [91] . Future experiments will have to assess the druggability of such interactions and the potential need to increase the current arsenal of BH3 mimetics. The ribbon structure (PDB code: 1PQ1 [92] ) shows that BCL-xL is an all-\u03b1-helical protein with a central hydrophobic core surrounded by amphipathic helices. This helical bundle arrangement is typical of anti-and pro-apoptotic BCL-2 homologous proteins. The BIM-BH3 peptide (in blue) fits into an extended hydrophobic groove at the surface of BCL-xL. Various interactions (hydrophobic contacts, salt bridges, hydrogen bonds) are formed between BH3 residues and residues lining the groove. An aspartate residue (Asp) found in all BH3 motifs forms a salt bridge with a conserved arginine (Arg) residue present in the BH1 motif of BCL-xL, and an invariant leucine (Leu) participates in hydrophobic contacts with the BH3-binding groove. The BH3 motif of BCL-xL is colored blue. The diagrams illustrate the topology of the interacting proteins in their fulllength forms. Position of the nine \u03b1-helices is indicated at the bottom. Helices that form the hydrophobic binding groove in BCL-xL are colored in blue. The four BH motifs are shown in magenta (BH4), blue (BH3), yellow (BH1) and brown (BH2). The grey box represents the C-terminal transmembrane domain (TM). BH motifs are depicted using the same color-code in the structure and in the motif architecture diagrams.

The drawing was prepared with the program PyMOL.\n\nWhat are SLiMs?\n\nShort linear/eukaryotic motifs (SLiMs/ELMs) are short modular functional units of proteins, typically constituted by a stretch of 3-11 contiguous amino acid residues, with only 3-5 core positions conferring the majority of their binding specificity [41, 81] . SLiMs serve as post-translational modification sites or ligands for other molecules (protein domains or nucleic acids) [35, 39-41, 43, 81] . Due to their short length, they constitute only a small binding surface area and engage in low affinity, transient and modulatable interactions, typically in the low micromolar range. The best known examples are binding motifs of typical modular protein-protein interaction domains, such as that of SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains, and they are usually described by a short consensus sequence (also termed a \"regular expression\", e.g. [P-X-X-P] for the SH3 domain binding motif). Because the number of residues involved in the activity of motifs is very small, they exhibit a high evolutionary plasticity, they can be generated by a single point mutation, often arise de novo and evolve convergently. Therefore, motifs are evolutionarily highly variable and are much less conserved than globular domains in the same sequences. SLiMs tend to occur in intrinsically disordered regions of proteins [42, 43] and, owing to this fact, their distinction from molecular recognition features (MoRFs) is not clear-cut. MoRFs are on average longer than SLiMs and are defined on a structural basis (by their ability to fold upon interacting with partners) rather than on a sequence basis [44, 45] . Due to their potential high density and evolutionary agility, SLiMs are thought to be actively involved in wiring and rewiring the connectivity of the interactome. Established motif instances are deposited in the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource [55] , where their major functional classes are ligand-binding (LIG), docking (DOC), degradation (DEG), targeting (TAR), Cleavage (CLV) and post-translational modification (MOD). BCL-2 homologs have never been described before as proteins able to bind linear motifs, though the attributes of SLiMs clearly suggest that BH3 should be considered as such a motif. Although some amount of sequence variation is observed in the BH1 and BH2 motifs of BCL-2 homologous proteins, these regions are not SLiMs as they constitute the borders of the structural hairpin lying at the center of the BCL-2 helical bundle and form the hydrophobic receptor cleft essential for BH3 binding (rather than binding by themselves to a hydrophobic pocket).\n\nThe BH3 motif was originally defined in 1995 as a region of ~7-15 amino acids with sequence similarity shared by the pro-and anti-death BCL-2 homologs BAK, BAX, BCL-2, BCL-xL plus a shorter non-homologous protein, BIK (reviewed in [5] ). In the following five years, BH3 motifs were identified in additional proteins, eventually settling on the full repertoire of fourteen BCL-2 homologs and eight canonical BH3-only proteins in humans (Supplementary S1), consisting of four direct activators (BIM, PUMA, truncated tBID, and NOXA) and four sensitizers (BAD, BIK, BMF, HRK) ( Figure 1A ). The eight BH3 motifs in these eight proteins were identified only on the basis of visual inspection of their sequences, and were confirmed by experimental evidence of pro-apoptotic activity upon binding to BCL-2 homologs. These proteins (plus worm EGL-1) constitute the canonical BH3-only subgroup.\n\nThe opportunity to discover new BH3-only proteins is attractive given their roles as linchpins connecting the cellular interactome to the apoptosis checkpoint. However, computational approaches have not validated the BH3 sequence signature [4, [22] [23] [24] . Most of the additional cellular and viral proteins claimed to contain functional BH3-like motifs belong to unrelated (non-BCL-2) protein families, and are referred to here as \"noncanonical\" BH3-containing proteins due to limited experimental data relative to the 8 canonical BH3-only proteins included in the extended BCL-2 family (Supplementary Figure  S1 and Supplementary Table S1 ). The overwhelming majority of these non-canonical BH3bearing proteins are sensitizer BH3s rather than direct activator BH3s because they trigger cell death by engaging prosurvival BCL-2 family members. Although most non-canonical BH3 motifs are untested for direct BAX/BAK activator function, exceptions have been reported [25] [26] [27] .\n\nThe BH3 motif is traditionally defined as an amphipathic \u03b1-helix that interacts with the hydrophobic cleft of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. Whereas this structural perspective has been highly useful for understanding interaction specificity [11, [16] [17] [18] , the available studies have tested relatively limited numbers of BH3 peptides/proteins compared to the large number of possible sequences at each amino acid position that occurs in natural BH3 motifs. Due to this sequence diversity, a validated BH3 signature sequence turns out to be elusive [4] . However, the BH3 is widely denoted as the hexameric sequence L-X(3)-G-D. Despite considerable progress in defining experimentally the key positions within the BH3 that specify its binding partners, computational methods applied to only the obvious BCL-2 homologs have produced a mixture of BH3 motif signatures [4] . Graphical BH3 alignments derived from each of the traditional subgroups of the extended BCL-2 family, the antiapoptotic BCL-2 homologs (8 proteins: 5 from humans plus worm CED9 and fly Buffy), the pro-apoptotic homologs (8 human proteins plus fly Debcl) and the canonical BH3-only proteins (8 human proteins plus worm EGL-1) indicate some composition bias in that some amino acids occur more frequently at some positions, but only in the central hexameric region ( Figure 1B ). If all three of these protein groups are combined, it is possible to derive a significant phylogenetic signal ( Figure 1B) . However, the signal degenerates to L-x(4,6)-D, which has no predictive value, when the 39 reported non-canonical BH3 motifs are aligned, all of which have at least some functional validation ( Figure 1B , and Supplementary Figure  S1 ). Alignment of the grand total of 63 reported BH3s illustrates only what is already generally agreed upon: that BH3s share two crucial residues (Leu and Asp) separated by four residues L-x(3)-[GA]-D, suggesting BH3s lack sequence conservation (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Attempts thus far to further define BH3 motifs have yielded signatures that are too strict (i.e., they exclude many BCL-2 homologs) or too inclusive (i.e., they fail to discriminate scrambled proteomes) [4] . Furthermore, the borders of BH3 motifs also have not been defined, and some reports include 20 amino acid stretches [11, 28] .\n\nDifficulties with computational definitions of BH3 motifs pose limitations on large-scale in silico screens, invariably resulting in long lists of likely false positives [4] . Thus, BH3 motifs pose two challenging computational problems of de novo identification, motif-finding and functional site prediction (the so-called Futility Theorem [29] ).\n\nThe proteins homologous to BCL-2 have a traceable origin, and therefore their BH3 most probably evolved from the ancestral proto-BCL-2 protein through divergent evolution. This is supported by our observation that BCL-2-like proteins from species at the base of the metazoan tree such as sponges and cnidarians clearly exhibit a recognizable BH3 motif (4 proteins labeled 'BCL2-like' in Supplementary Figure S1 ), indicating that this motif was already present in BCL-2 proteins from stem-metazoans. A similar situation exists for the 8 canonical BH3-only genes, although these are mainly limited to vertebrates (except C. elegans EGL-1). By contrast, the conservation of BH3 motifs in non-canonical proteins is variable. Although eukaryotic proteins BECN1/ATG6, ATG12 and BLM-s arose before chordates, their BH3 motif appeared after the emergence of chordates and has been subsequently conserved (Supplementary Table S1 ). The proposed yeast BH3 motif is conserved only between closely related yeast species, despite obvious overall protein conservation in humans (GRINA), and that of mammalian MOAP-1 only in primates [27] . Non-canonical BH3-containing genes were also described in several unrelated microbial species: DNA viruses (HHV8, HBV, HCV), RNA viruses (SARS coronavirus and NDV) and in a bacterial endosymbiont (Photorhabdus luminescens) (Supplementary Table S1 ). Based only on amino acid sequence, it could appear that BH3 motifs arose independently in several evolutionary lines, either randomly or by convergence.\n\nTo gain further insight into the evolutionary origins of BH3 motifs, we analyzed the exons that encode BH3 motifs. Information about exon size and the reading frames (phase class) at exon/intron boundaries can be useful to reveal evolutionary relationships between fastevolving proteins or remote homologs, as gene structures evolve much slower than sequences [30] . Strikingly, all 8 canonical BH3-only proteins encode their BH3 on a short exon (between 99 and 276 bp), and 5 of the 8, BIM, PUMA, BID, BMF and BAD share the same exon phase structure. In this case, the BH3-encoding exon starts with the last two nucleotides of the first codon and ends with a complete codon, designated phase [1,0] by convention ( Figure 1C , Supplementary Figure S2 and Supplementary Table S2 ). This phase preservation raises the possibility that there is an evolutionary link between these proteins. In addition, EGL1 (canonical BH3-only) and CED13 (non-canonical), which are restricted to nematodes, also have a short BH3-coding exon of the same [1, 0] phase. This suggests that in addition to functional conservation, evolutionary homology between these two molecules may exist, further supported by their 60% sequence identity shared over 21 amino acids in the BH3 region. Furthermore, the genes for BCL-2 homologs belonging to the \"BID clade\" (i.e., BCL2L12, BCL2L14, BCL2L15 and BID [4] ) and several additional non-canonical \n\nDifficulties in defining biologically important protein motifs are not unique to the BH3 motif. The P-X-X-P motif that binds to SH3 domains [32] , the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) retention sequence K-D-E-L (defined by [KRHQSA]-[DENQ]-E-L) [33] , and the L-X-X-L-L motif that binds transcription regulators [34] are difficult to accurately predict due to their low information content. These example motifs are short linear sequence signatures that, like BH3s, bind to specific globular proteins. Such motifs have been termed eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs) [35] , miniMotifs [36] , short linear motifs (SLiMs) [37] or simply \"linear motifs\" [38] . Many proteins contain short linear motifs, referred to here collectively as SLiMs (see BOX 2) . SLiMs serve as either modification sites (e.g. phosphorylation) or as protein binding motifs analogous to BH3s, which bind into pockets on BCL-2 family proteins. Despite the difficulties in defining their sequence signatures, SLiMs appear to be the most abundant type of functional elements in the proteome [35, [39] [40] [41] . SLiMs overlap with molecular recognition features (MoRFs) [42, 43] , a type of recognition elements that originated from research in the intrinsic disorder field (BOX 2) [44, 45] . Although not previously proposed, BH3 motifs of both homologous and non-homologous proteins exhibit multiple attributes of SLiMs/MoRFs, potentially expanding the concept of a BH3 (Figure 2 , Key Figure) .\n\nSLiMs generally are less than 10-12 residues with 3 to 5 hot spot residues critical for binding their targets, consistent with the number of critical interacting residues observed in high-resolution structures of BH3s bound to their globular partners [9, 28] ). Also like BH3s, well-established SLiMs are degenerate, with variable sequence at the majority of their amino acid positions, and thus can occur by random chance at high frequencies, sometimes several times in a single protein.\n\nAlthough not a general rule, mouse BH3-only protein Noxa has two BH3 motifs, and BID is reported to have a second BH3-like motif termed BH3-B [46] . Like SLiMs, BH3 motifs are found in small (human NOXA, 54 amino acids) and large proteins (HUWE1, 4374 amino acids), and can be positioned near or far from the Nterminus (e.g. BLID/BRCC2 and mouse Pxt1 versus MCL-1, CHMP5 and HEPB2). Hence, BH3 motifs appear to resemble SLiMs in terms of overall sequence characteristics and positioning.\n\nPlaced into an evolutionary context, the BH3 motif is plastic because it can arise with very few amino acid substitutions during random or convergent evolution. Thus, distinctions between bona fide BH3 SLiMs and false positives cannot be deduced from sequence alone due to sequence degeneracy [4] . Accurate assignments depend upon additional contextual information including primary sequence features, secondary structure (or intrinsic disorder), and validation through some orthogonal (functional, evolutionary) approaches. In fact, the BH3s of understudied BCL-2 homologs BCL2A1 and BCL2L10/BCL-B display conserved secondary structure rather than sequence. More challenging is the distinction between BH3s that function in nature versus those that function only in experimental settings. The compiled list of all reported BH3-containing proteins (Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary  Table S1 ) also contains invertebrates (e.g. C. elegans EGL-1), bacteria (e.g. MCF/makes caterpillars floppy toxins), viruses (e.g. matrix protein of Newcastle disease virus) and fungi (e.g. YBH3/Ynl305c). While all reported BH3 motifs may not prove to be functional in nature, the existence of seemingly rogue BH3s could suggest that BH3 motifs encompass broad taxonomic diversity, and at least for yeast and bacteria implies yet unidentified non-BCL-2-binding functions because BCL-2 homologous proteins are restricted to metazoan organisms [3] (Figure 2 , Key Figure) .\n\nSLiMs are prominently involved in protein-protein interactions where a globular domain serves as a receptor for the SLiM ligand [40, 41] \n\n. For example, P-X-X-P motifs bind to beta-barrel SH3 domains (PDB code 1SHG), the L-X-X-L-L motif in transcription factor STAT6 binds the PAS-B domain of nuclear co-activator NCoA-1/SRC-1, and the ER retention motif KDEL found in many proteins apparently binds to the seven-transmembrane domain receptor ERD2. These ligand-receptor interactions are frequently transient and reversible [39] , and thus well-suited to mediate dynamic processes, such as signaling and subcellular targeting. and PDZ-binding motifs [49] have intrinsic propensity for \u03b1-helix formation, and thus are also designated \u03b1-MoRFs [44, 45] . The special type of protein-protein interaction mediated by a SLiM and a hydrophobic binding cleft can be druggable [50] , as exemplified by the design of small molecule BH3 mimetics that inactivate anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins to treat cancer [15] \n\n.\n\nAnalogous to many SLiMs, BH3 motifs bind into the hydrophobic groove of particular BCL-2 homologous proteins. In the quest for clinically useful tools, extensive NMR, surface plasmon resonance, optical spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry studies have defined the overlapping binding selectivities of peptides derived from BH3-only proteins [15] (BOX 1 Figure) . Because regions adjacent to the BH3 motif influence the mode of binding to BCL-2 homologous proteins, some canonical BH3-only proteins are more promiscuous than others or bind to a defined subset of BCL-2 homologs (giving rise to the sensitizer versus activator subclasses). The combinatorial diversity of BH3 sequences from BH3-only proteins, particularly in the regions flanking the conserved hot spot residues Lx(3)-G-D, and pairing residues lining the hydrophobic grooves of BCL-2 homologous partners, explain the great selectivity observed in these interactions ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Table 1) .\n\nSLiMs are often encoded on exons that are alternatively spliced [41, [51] [52] [53] . At least for BAX, the BH3-exon is omitted from some splice variants [54] . In contrast, the more conserved BH1 and BH2 motifs of BCL-2 proteins are disrupted by alternative splicing of BCL-2, BCL-X and MCL1, and this splicing event can generate pro-apoptotic \"BH3-only\" splice variants (MCL-1 S , BCL-x S ). In addition, Ensembl predictions suggest that BH3containing exons in approximately half of the non-canonical BH3-bearing proteins are candidates for alternative splicing events to either add or remove BH3 motifs (Supplementary Table S1 ). SLiMs are reported to be posttranslationally regulated including by phosphorylation [41, 51, 52, 55] . Intriguingly, BH3 and BH3-like regions show an abundance of Ser/Thr residues (Supplementary Figure S1 ), suggesting that their phosphorylation states might influence binding of BH3 linear motifs to BCL-2 homologous proteins, as previously reported [56, 57] . Therefore, BH3 motifs bear a number of striking similarities with SLiMs, though the next section will show it is not entirely spot-on.\n\nDespite their similarities, several features of BH3 motifs suggest they constitute a new type of SLiM. SLiMs are preferentially found in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or protein regions (IDRs) [39, 42] , whereas BH3s are found in both disordered and structured proteins. Canonical BH3-only proteins lack native structure (BIM, BAD, BMF, HRK, NOXA, PUMA and worm EGL-1) [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] , and helical folding of their BH3s is coupled with binding to their globular partners [58, 60, 61] , analogous to \u03b1-MoRFs [44, 45, 63, 64] . However, BH3 motifs also occur in the well-folded \u03b1-helical bundle domain (outside the unstructured loops) of BCL-2-like, BAX-like and BID-like proteins [16, [65] [66] [67] [68] as well as in other ordered proteins like the helical protein VIRF1 and the \u03b1/\u03b2 proteins ATG12, RAD9A and TGM2. In addition, numerous BH3 motifs lie in proteins that are predicted to adopt a tertiary structure (Supplementary Table S1 ) (see also [11] ). Therefore, in addition to specifying binding partners, inherently structured BH3 SLiMs also have a role in maintaining globular domain structure integrity (and stability [18] ). Reciprocally, hydrophobic cores of structured proteins may facilitate formation or stabilization of helical structures in BH3 regions, similar to MoRFs or so-called chameleons that change conformations with their surroundings.\n\nThis peculiarity that some BH3 SLiMs are embedded in globular proteins explains why BH3s are automatically discarded by SLiM detection algorithms [38, 55, [69] [70] [71] [72] . Similarly, methods for computational identification of SLiMs/MoRFs from structural data exist (e.g. by screening of PDB complexes [73] ) but fail in recognizing the BH3 motif because no 3D structures for full-length BH3-only proteins in complex with BCL-2 homologous proteins are available to date. BH3 sequences are also likely to be downgraded by evolutionary filtering approaches for detecting remotely similar motifs [71, 74, 75] because some BH3 instances appear to be conserved among BCL-2 homologous proteins. Conversely, BH3 motifs from canonical and non-canonical BH3-only proteins are overlooked by methods that rely on evolutionary conservation scores to derive sequence signatures (e.g. QuasimotifFinder [76] ).\n\nA distinctive trait of the BH3s of globular BCL-2 proteins is their ability to be conditionally exposed on protein surfaces, while SLiMs commonly appear on protein surfaces and exposed unstructured loops [77] . That is, the hydrophobic binding face of the BH3 in BAX and BAK is buried inside the core (in solution) [78] [79] [80] . Thus, BH3 motifs buried within structured domains must be exposed through activating events such as conformational changes upon membrane association and proteolytic cleavage.\n\nSLiMs are reported to bind their partners with low affinity (>1\u03bcM) [81] . Although low affinity interactions have sometimes been measured between prosurvival BCL-2 proteins and BAX-BH3 peptides [82, 83] , most of the BH3 peptides assessed through biophysical and biochemical assays bind prosurvival BCL-2 homologs with relatively high affinity, nanomolar range K D [84] [85] [86] . Factors that increase binding affinity are helical content [14] , length of BH3 peptides [87] , and potentially residues distant from the BH3 core region (i.e., long-range contacts) of BH3-only or BH3-bearing proteins.\n\nAlthough distinct in some aspects, the BH3 motif fits the definition and essential features of a SLiM involved in binding. Furthermore, the subset of BH3 motifs from intrinsically disordered proteins can also be considered MoRFs that change shape upon binding [18] . This novel perspective has the major advantage of reconciling the structural versus sequence definitions of BH3 motifs, taking into account their full diversity.\n\nWe introduce the concept that the intensely studied, cell death-inducing BH3 motif is a newly recognized short linear motif (SLiM) / molecular recognition feature (MoRF) that specifies protein-binding interactions with or between globular proteins. The SLiM/MoRF concept allows the field to avoid the easy and comfortable option of relegating most (if not all) of the non-canonical BH3-containing proteins to the rank of \"false positives\". Validated BH3 motifs are found in intrinsically disordered proteins, but are also found in structured domains (e.g. globular domains of the BCL-2 type), likely delaying the recognition of BH3, and potentially other motifs, as SLiMs or MoRFs. Unlike most SLiMs, some BH3 motifs are only conditionally available for protein-protein interactions, constituting a distinct class of SLiMs that control the mitochondrial checkpoint of apoptosis. The evidence suggests that some BH3 motifs of both BCL-2 homologous and non-homologous proteins share common ancestry, supported by conservation at the genomic level despite amino acid sequence divergence.\n\nIt is not known whether a BCL-2 family protein can bind to intrinsically disordered proteins other than BH3-only proteins. The mainly disordered N-terminal domain of p53 was recently shown to interact with BCL-xL, but the surfaces of interaction appeared to involve elements of secondary structure on both proteins [88] . It is also not known whether a BCL-2 family protein can interact with other types of SLiMs or MoRFs, in addition to the BH3. However, MCL-1 has been reported to interact with proteins sharing a sequence motif distinct from the BH3 in p53 (albeit with the BH3 signature in reverse orientation) [89, 90] . Viewing BH3s as SLiMs also raises the possibility that a BH3 motif could interact with globular domains devoid of any sequence and structural similarity to the BCL-2 protein, such as the binding of BAD BH3 to glucokinase [91] . We further hypothesize that nonmetazoan species will be found to encode BH3-docking receptors (BCL-2 equivalents) not necessarily sharing a globular 3D structure resembling BCL-2 (see Outstanding questions and Figure 2 ). If confirmed, this would suggest that the pro-apoptotic BH3 motif is also a versatile and evolutionary plastic module associated with binding events in different branches of the tree of life.\n\n\u2022 Can we distinguish the functional versus structural definitions of the BH3 motif? Screens for new BH3-containing proteins have generally focused on candidate proteins associated with systems or conditions in which BCL-2-regulated cell death is involved. Yet, it is possible that BH3 motifs, which are often referred to as \u03b1-helices, may turn out to represent protein-protein interaction modules mediating binding between molecules that have functions related or not to apoptosis. This idea is consistent with the non-apoptotic roles of BCL-2 proteins that is mediated through binding the BH3 of Beclin 1 to regulate autophagy.\n\n\u2022 Is the BH3 motif the first of many SLiMs with similar features in the proteome universe? Future research is needed to evaluate the proportion of SLiMs that are embedded in both structured and intrinsically disordered proteins and that, like BH3 motifs, can achieve high-affinity binding to their receptors.\n\n\u2022 Do BH3 motifs interact with non-BCL-2 types of globular domains? BH3 motifs may have a broad phylogenetic distribution and could be involved in interactions with structural domains that do not fold like the BCL-2 proteins and that exert functions different from apoptosis regulation. Identification of non-BCL-2-like BH3 receptors across the tree of life offers a new terra incognita for research.\n\n\u2022 Do BCL-2 homologous proteins interact with other types of SLiMs? Because globular domains often bind to multiple linear motif classes, the question of whether BCL-2 homologous proteins can interact with other types of SLiMs or MoRFs, in addition to the BH3, awaits a rigorous analysis, but is consistent with the finding that the hydrophobic tail of BCL-2 proteins can also occupy the BH3-binding groove.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nThis theorem indicates that searching for bona fide motifs with signatures having weak information content will yield many more random matches than functional hits, making large-scale screens futile\n\nRefers to those amino acids involved at the interface of protein-protein complexes and that contribute significantly to the binding free energy between both partners Protein domain a compact and autonomous folding unit of protein structure, such as the typical 'helix-bundled' BCL-2 fold Sequence motif a conserved amino acid stretch, like BH1-BH4 regions in BCL-2 family members that distinguish them from other proteins\n\nDegree of resemblance (the fraction of identical or chemically similar amino acids) between amino acid sequences, which is usually explained through one or more of the following options: shared ancestry (homology), random coincidence (drift), convergence, and parallelism (the three latter options being usually subsumed under the term homoplasy). Although high sequence similarity often portends structural similarity, proteins with low sequence identity and significant structure similarity can occur (e.g. BCLxL and BID, or BCL-xL and diphtheria toxin translocation domain)\n\n\u2022 BCL-2 family interactions are mediated by evolutionarily diverse BH3 motifs to regulate apoptosis. Given their key roles, BH3 mimetics are in clinical trials as cancer therapies.\n\nThe discovery of novel BH3-only proteins represents a major endeavor in the cell death field. As a result, BH3 motifs are reportedly present in a nebulous conglomerate of different proteins, both structured and intrinsically disordered.\n\nThere is no rigorous definition of a BH3 motif. Currently available BH3 signatures are diverse and elusive for predicting new functional BH3-containing proteins.\n\n\u2022 Redefining the BH3 motif as a new type of short linear motif (SLiM) or molecular recognition feature (MoRF) reconciles many puzzling features of this motif and opens up new avenues for research. BCL-2-related proteins fall into two categories, each with two sub-categories: the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, which are divided into activators (dark blue) and sensitizers (light blue), and the BCL-2 homologous proteins, which can be anti-or pro-apoptotic (light and dark purple, respectively). BH3-only protein localization and function are regulated at transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels in response to specific death stimuli (reviewed in [6] ). Activator BH3-only proteins can directly activate BAX or BAK by a transient physical interaction leading to insertion into mitochondrial membranes, oligomerization, MOMP and apoptosis. Sensitizer BH3-only proteins induce such phenomena only by docking their BH3 \u03b1-helix into a hydrophobic groove on the surface of prosurvival BCL-2 homologs, thereby releasing BAX/BAK or activator BH3-only proteins [8] [9] [10] . Although it behaves as a direct activator BH3-only protein, the BID protein appears to be a bona fide BCL-2/BAX homolog sharing a similar characteristic 3D fold (hence the two colors, half blue, half purple). All BH3-bearing proteins except BID are natively unfolded proteins (e.g. BIM, BMF) or belong to unrelated protein families having or predicted to have distinct structures.

Aligned sequences are the same as in Supplementary Figure S1 Some or all BH3 motifs have the attributes of short linear motifs (SLiMs) associated with protein-protein binding events (left). Yet, BH3 is an unusual SLiM type as it is found in ordered as well as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and it achieves high-affinity binding to globular BCL-2 homologous proteins. BH3-mediated protein-protein interactions (PPIs) form an intricate network that controls the process of apoptotic cell death in metazoan organisms (right). Both pro-and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologs have a globular domain structure, share common ancestry and constitute binding sites (receptors) for BH3 motifs, which act as ligands to either activate the executioner proteins BAX/BAK or inhibit the antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Both pro-and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologs can receive a BH3 from BH3-only proteins, and can also receive the BH3 from BAX/BAK (e.g. BAX-BAX or BAX-BCL-2 interactions). Redefining the BH3 cell death domain as a SLiM/MoRF leads to several testable predictions, including the possible existence of (i) BH3-mediated proteinprotein interactions in non-metazoan organisms (including prokaryotes), and (ii) non-BCL-2-like receptors for BH3 motifs. Because globular domains often bind to multiple linear motif classes, the question of whether BCL-2 homologous proteins can interact with other types of SLiMs, in addition to the BH3, is also open. The color scheme used to group the different attributes of the BH3 SLiM is the following: sequence features (grey), binding features (green), structural features (pink) and other features (violet)."}
