[1] [2] [3] [4] Due to the negative effects it brought, the World Health Organization (WTO) defined the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on January 31th, 2020. 5 As early as December 2019, the COVID-19 epidemic were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.\n\nIn a short period of time, the number of COVID-19 confirmed patients in Zhejiang Province also increase rapidly. 6, 7 Currently, the diagnosis of COVID-19 relies mainly on SARS-CoV-2 nucleicacid detection.\n\nHowever, due to the shortcomings of false-negative results caused by the low viral load in the samples and relatively insufficient detection kits, many patients cannot be detected in time. Although clinical symptoms, epidemiological exposure history and computed tomography (CT) manifestations have been added to the diagnostic criteria of the disease, the atypical early clinical symptoms, unclear epidemiological exposure history and ambiguous imaging conclusions also bring difficulties to the screening of the patients. 6, 8 An effective and simple multi-parameter diagnostic tool is urgently needed.\n\nOur study selected the clinical data of patients who came to our hospital during the first phase of the epidemic (by February 5 th , 2020, most of the confirmed patients were from Wuhan or had a clear history of close contact with the returning population from Wuhan) as the training dataset. By comparing the characteristics of the confirmed cases and excluding cases, the independent risk factors related to the disease were identified and included in the diagnostic model.

This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University (code number IIT20200025A). Data of patients between January 20 th , 2020 and February 5 th , 2020 were enrolled into training dataset, and between February 6 th , 2020 and February 19 th , 2020 were enrolled into validate dataset. All patients who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleicacid detection result were classified into COVID-19 group, while the others were classified into non-COVID-19 group. Due to the huge number of non-COVID-19 group patients, we eliminated the enrolled patients according to the following steps: (1) all negative patients from the COVID-19 designated district, Zhijiang District of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine; (2) negative outpatients from Qingchun District were sorted by \"Z-A\" based on Chinese first name, the first 60% between January 20 th , 2020 and February 5 th , 2020, and the first 40% between February 6 th , 2020 and February 19 th , 2020 were included.

(2) moderate: patients with symptoms and imaging examination shows pneumonia; (3) severe: patients meet any of the following: (i) respiratory rate shock; (iii) combination of other organ failure that requires admitted into intensive care unit (ICU). Mild or moderate patients were included in the non-severe group, and severe or critical patients were included in the severe group.\n\nData were extracted from electronic medical record system of the the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. Epidemiological exposure history within the 14 days before illness onset is defined as: (1) having exposure related to Wuhan: had recently lived, traveled, or had close contact with someone who has been to Wuhan;\n\n(2) close contacts: had contacted with a COVID-19 confirmed patient. Except for SARS-CoV-2 nucleicacid detection, the data used in this study were the first inhospital results. Based on the clinical judgment of doctors and the medical burden considerations, patients who did not performed CT in non-COVID-19 group were assigned as a negative CT report by default.

Two lung is divided into the upper (above trachea juga), middle (between trachea juga and pulmonary vein) and lower (under pulmonary vein) parts. According to the area occupied by different CT signs in each region: normal lung tissue, 0 points; lesion area < 25% of this layer, 1 point; 25% ~ 50%, 2 points; 50% ~ 75%, 3 points; > 75% 4 points. The score of each part were added to obtain the final CT score. 11\n\nContinuous variables were expressed as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR).\n\nCategorical variables were expressed as numbers and percentages in each category.\n\nMann-Whitney U-test were used to evaluate continuous data. Chi-square test were used for categorical variables. Independent risk factor analysis was performed using multivariate logistic regression analyses with forward stepwise method.

All statistical analyses were done by SPSS statistical software package (version 25.0). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nA total of 304 patients were enrolled in the training dataset , including 73 patients in the COVID-19 group and 231 patients in the non-COVID-19 group (Table 1) author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031906 doi: medRxiv preprint\n\nAs shown in Table 1 , the white blood cell count (P = 0.002), lymphocyte count (P < 0.001), monocyte count (P < 0.001), and platelet count (P < 0.001) were lower in the COVID-19 group than the non-COVID-19 group. Although neutrophil count had no obvious difference, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group \n\nVariables with P < 0.05 were selected to perform multivariate logistic regression analysis by using the forward stepwise method.

Other significant parameters, age and meaningful lower respiratory symptoms, were also included into the COVID-19 EWS (Figure 2A) \n\nWe compared the clinical data between the severe group and the non-severe group to find predictive factors of COVID-19 disease severity ( author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031906 doi: medRxiv preprint 37.0-59.0], P < 0.001), indicating that older patients were more likely to develop severe illness. The proportion of male patients in the severe group was great larger than that of female (71.4% vs 28.6%). Percentage of patients with hypertension was higher in severe group (22 [52.4%] vs 4 [12.9%], P < 0.001), while other coexisting disorders, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed no significant differences. In addition, many laboratory items and CT score presenting significant differences too. In order to better distinguish severe and non-severe patients, we defined the new threshold value of the selected parameters (P < 0.05) by calculating the cut-off value using ROC curve analysis. Table 3 showed the parameters with AUROC > 0.60.\n\nThe worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 is intensifying. 12 As the main battlefield on the first stage, early detection and effective quarantine of patients and close contacts has made the epidemic in China so far under effective control. However, practice has shown that detection of highly suspected patients remains problematic. Considering the relative shortage of SARS-CoV-2 nucleicacid detection kits and false-negative results caused by various reasons, such as the quality of the samples taken, the number of viruses and the stage of the disease, medical experts have proposed screening of highly suspected patients with lung CT. However, due to mild COVID-19 patients are defined as no pneumonia on imaging, and imaging findings of some patients are atypical, screening based on CT findings is greatly dependent on the physician's experience and the effectiveness is limited. All the above reasons increase the diagnosis difficult of COVID-19 patients when they first come to the doctors. All rights reserved.

Since this diagnostic model was a logistic regression equation and inconvenient to operate in clinical environment, we converted the diagnostic model into an scoring tool by assigning values to each variable in the equation. Besides of that, we enrolled two more parameters into the final COVID-19 EWS, including age and meaningful respiratory symptoms. Based on the statistical analysis, we found that elderly people were more susceptible to COVID-19 and develop severe, which may due to their lower disease resistance and more basic diseases; some significant symptoms, such as cough, expectoration and dyspnea, can help to strengthen the association between fever and lower respiratory symptoms and weaken the weight of fever caused by other reasons. As a result, the COVID-19 EWS contained easy-to-get parameters on clinical manifestation, epidemiological characteristics, basic vital signs, laboratory and radiologic data, which provide a more comprehensive assessment of patients. Through re-evaluation in the validation dataset and comparison with other methods, results showed that both of our diagnostic model and COVID-19 EWS had relatively high and stable sensitivity and specificity.\n\nThe clinical features of patients in our medical center were similar to those reported in previous studies [13] [14] [15] : Male were more susceptible to COVID-19 but had no significance to predict of disease severity in our study may due to the small sample size, although the male to female ratio was quite high in the severe group (71.4 vs 28.6); most patients had initial symptoms of fever and cough; as for laboratory results, the decrease of white blood cell, lymphocyte, monocyte, and platelet, and the increase of the levels of ESR, CRP, Cr, serum urea nitrogen, LDH, and HBDH were found in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection All rights reserved.

[17] [18] [19] In our study, we also found the increase of NLR in COVID-19 patients, and it was positively related to the disease severity.\n\nConsistent with a previous study, we found CD4 + T cell count and CD8 + T cell count were negatively correlated to the severity of COVID-19, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may direct or indirect damage to T lymphocytes and further aggravates disease progression. 20, 21 Although inflammatory cytokine storms were thought to be a mechanism for COVID-19 progression, 15 we did not find an significantly increased level of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3.\n\nThese findings might due to the limited size of our study and the large heterogeneity at the time-points of the first detection.\n\nThere were also many shortcomings in our study that should be considered. Firstly, it was a retrospective study, which might contain selection bias, although we tried to avoid the bias through sorting patients by \"Z-A\" based on Chinese first name and strictly abide the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In addition, because of the incomplete of potentially valuable information, such as smoking history and basic diseases, we cannot conduct a comprehensive analysis of these factors currently. Besides of that, additional multi-center, multi-ethnic and prospective studies are expected to revised our diagnostic model and COVID-19 EWS, and we also plan to implement a multi-center study with a larger sample size to further validate and optimize the model. More over, it is hoped that better statistical algorithms will make the diagnostic model more practical.\n\nAll rights reserved.
