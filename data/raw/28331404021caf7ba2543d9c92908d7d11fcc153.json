Indeed the IgE discovery process [3] [4] [5] and the development of first generation assays of specific IgE [6] was in part made possible through the availability of large quantitiesofamyeloma-derivedIgE.\n\nAllergic reactions are initiated through the specific interaction between allergens and IgE. Studies describing these interactions had for decades to rely largely on complex mixtures of allergens and IgE antibodies. Although such complex reagents are still in commonuse,researchandclinicaldiagnosisrelatedtoallergyhavesubstantiallymoved forwardthroughthedevelopmentofwell-definedallergens.Asmethodologiestopurify naturalallergensweredevelopedtheyprovidedaccesstomoredefinedpreparationsof suchproteinsthatbindtoIgE.Bythelate1980'iesacriticalbreakthroughoccurredas thefirstgenesencodingallergenswerecloned [7] [8] [9] [10] pavingthewayfortheproduction ofrecombinantallergensinhomogeneousform.Subsequently,numerousallergenshave beenclonedandcharacterizedinquitesubstantialdetailassummarizedforinstanceby theAllergome,AllFamandIUISallergendatabases [11] [12] [13] .Theseeffortstoclonegenes encoding individual allergens have allowed the development of component-resolved diagnosis [14, 15] , of tools able to achieve multiplexed analysis of IgE responses [16] , and of defined vaccines (reviewed by Valenta et al. [17] ). Therefore, the use of recombinant allergens will certainly improve the clinical management of allergic patients. 4 Our knowledge of IgE repertoires is however lagging behind our understanding of allergens.Monoclonalantibodytechnologyandinparticularmoderntoolsinmolecular engineering hold promise to reduce this gap by enhancing our knowledge of the IgE component.Weliveinanexcitingerawheresuchmoleculartoolshavethepotentialto revealseveralaspectsofallergyresearchandmoderniseclinicalpractice.Wewillherein discussthecurrentstatusandfutureprospectsofanalysisofhumanIgErepertoiresand how information on IgE and its reactivities can be used to support our understanding andmanagementofallergicconditions.\n\nHumanantibodies,includingIgE,aremadeupofheavy(H)andlight(L)chains,ofwhich the variable (V) domains of the H chains are believed to contribute much to their antigen-binding properties [18] [19] [20] . As monoclonal IgE are reagents that are hard to generatewhilegenesequencesthatencodetheHchain(butnottheLchain)Vdomains ofIgEcanbeisolatedmoreeasilyfromtranscriptsderivedfromIgE-producinghumanB cells, much of the analyses of the detailed molecular nature of IgE have had to rely on studiesofsuchgenesequences.Thesegenesarefoundinalocusonhumanchromosome 14, a locus that is extensively described in the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) database (http://www.imgt.org) [21] .Briefly,threesetsofgenes,variable(V),diversity(D)and joining (J) genes are present in this locus. They had largely been mapped in an initial formalreadybytheendofthe1990'ies [22] [23] [24] [25] .Abasicknowledgeofmanyofthemajor genes that shape the antibody repertoire has thus been available for quite some time.\n\nYet,asoutlinedinsections2.2-2.3,thereisstillsubstantialcontroversywithrespectto the genetic composition and processes involved in the generation of human IgE responses.\n\nThefunctionalVgenesencodemostoftheHchainVdomain.Thissetofgenes, 39-55of which are available in a single individual's genome [26] , is divided into 7 gene subgroups based on sequence similarity. Among these subgroups, subgroup 3 is the largest subgroup (\u226519 different genes in any given individual [27] ). It is also the most frequently used H chain V gene subgroup as it is used by about one half of all rearrangements [27] .Interindividualdifferencesintheavailablerepertoire(intermsof V,DandJgenemakeup)exist [26] andmayaffectantibodyresponsesbutthebiological 5 significance of such differences in general [28] or in relation to allergic disease is not wellestablished.\n\nKeydiversityoftheHchainofantibodiesderivesfromtherearrangementthatoccursin pre-BlymphocytesthatbringsoneV,(usually)oneDandoneJgenetogethertoforma functional H chain V domain-encoding gene. The precise site of joining of these genes differs between different rearrangements and the incorporation of non-templateencoded nucleotides between the fused genes further adds to the diversity. This particular process results in the creation of sequences that encode a loop, the third complementarity determining region (CDR) of the H chain (CDRH3), that due to the diversityoftheseprocessesvariesgreatlybothintermsoflengthandsequencebetween antibodies produced by different sets of B cells. This particular loop is very important for the specificity of many antibodies [19, 29] . Further diversity is introduced into the antibodyrepertoirethroughcombinationofsuchinitiallycreatedHchaindiversitywith diverseLchainVdomainsequences.Apartfromtheseinitialrearrangementprocesses, antibody-encoding genes may be diversified by somatic hypermutation following antigen encounter in a process believed to select for antibodies with improved recognitionoftheantigen.\n\nSeveral analyses of IgE-encoding transcriptomes have been performed over the years, manyofwhicharesummarizedinSupplementaryTable1.ItistheHchain'sgeneralkey importance for antigen binding [18, 19] that lends credibility to this approach. These studies mostly rely on relatively low throughput sequencing of randomly picked transcripts encoding the H chain V domain of IgE found in biological specimens following amplification of IgE-encoding sequences by PCR. Technological aspects (as further outlined in section 2.2) or the inclusion of very few subjects and/or very few IgE-encoding sequences in several of these studies may explain some of the different conclusionsmadeinthesestudiesofIgErepertoires.Nevertheless,therearesomemain conclusionsandaspectsthatdeserveparticularattentionasdiscussedinthefollowing sections.\n\n6 Several studies report that a quite limited set of IgE H chain V domain-encoding sequences are present in a sample. Similar sequences, evolving from the same rearrangement as defined by an origin in one specific V gene, an identical length and highlyhomologoussequenceoftheCDRH3,andsharedmutationsarefrequentlyfound in individual samples (see for instance Supplementary Figure 1 IthasbeensuggestedthatIGHVgeneorigin-restrictedrepertoiresofIgEaretheresultof responses induced by superantigen activities that preferentially target and expand B cells carrying antibodies derived from particular genes or subgroups of genes [34, 36] ratherthanconventionalantigen-specificantibodyresponses.Suchnotionshavefound support from findings demonstrating alackof evidence forselection by antigenin IgE (furtherdiscussedinsection2.3).Othershavehoweverarguedthattechnicalartefacts in extensive PCR amplification procedures involving complex primer mixtures may cause the observed skewness of IgE-encoding repertoires [39] . We envisage that improvementsinprocedures,forinstancethedevelopmentanduseofhighthroughput sequencingtechnologythatcanaddress1.largersetsofIgE-encodingsequencesatgreat depth, with 2. less dependence on bias-prone amplification processes, from 3. larger cohorts of subjects with different IgE-mediated conditions eventually will resolve the matterifrestrictedIgErepertoiresexistandifsuperantigensareinvolvedintheshaping of(atleastsome)IgErepertoires.\n\n8 SeveralstudiesasoutlinedabovereportthatIgE-encodingtranscriptsfoundinallergic subjects show evidence of a somatic hypermutation process (Supplementary Table 1 ).\n\nTherearenumerouspointmutationsthatdifferentiatethesesequencesfromtheclosest germline IGHV gene. In contrast, IgE-encoding transcripts derived from non-allergic subjects show less evidence of hypermutation [40] . However, parasitized but nonallergic subjects produce IgE from somatically hypermutated genes [39] . Similarly, allergen-specific IgE selected from phage-displayed libraries are extensively mutated (mutation frequency of genes encoding the H-chain of such IgE ( [41] ). The high level of mutation of several IgE repertoires [42] and selected allergen-specific antibody fragments described briefly above might speak against a dominance of the direct switching pathway at least in the conditions that have been studied most extensively.\n\nHowever, the limited set of data certainly suggests that further investigations on this matterareneeded.\n\nThe interpretation of the role of mutations in human IgE is a matter of controversy.\n\nSomestudiesindicatethatthemutationpatternofIgE-encodinggenesshowevidenceof anantigenselectionprocess [43, 44] .Otherstudiessuggestthatthereislittleevidence of antigenic selection in IgE repertoires of allergic [40, 45] and non-allergic but parasitizedsubjects [39] .Somestudiesevenindicate,asoutlinedabove,thatmutations accumulate at patches of the V domain in a manner that indicates an involvement of superantigensintheshapingoftheIgErepertoire [34, 36] .Studiesofantigenselection inantibodyresponsesarehowevercomplicatedbyextensivemethodologicalproblems [46] . It has indeed been proven difficult to analyze if immunoglobulin sequences (including IgE) have undergone positive selection or not, by using sequence data analyzedbyextensivelycontrolledmathematicalmethodsalone [42] .Webelievethatit will not be possible to resolve this matter until methodology has been developed to retrievemultiplehumanmonoclonalIgEinaformidenticaltothosethatoccurinvivoin similaritytostudiesofaffinitymaturationofhumanIgG [33] .Evenifsuchantibodiesare available, the problem to unequivocally demonstrate affinity maturation in a context thatinvolvesantigenicstimulationwithcomplexmixturesofallergensisveryextensive.\n\nUnless methodological advances to analyse the imprint of selection in antibodyencoding sequences occur, we expect it to be a truly challenging endeavour to prove beyond doubt whether or not selection by antigen shapes the repertoire of IgE as it developsinhumansthroughnaturalexposuretoallergens.\n\nAntibody responses are generally believed to be generated and selected in secondary lymphoidorgans.However,severallinesofevidencesuggestthatIgE-producingBcells canbegeneratedanddifferentiatedatothersites.Mucosaltissuehasbeenimplicatedas a site where IgE class-switch, receptor revisionandsomatichypermutationmayoccur [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] and IgE-producing plasma cells have been identified at the site of allergic inflammationinnasalmucosa [52] .Conditionswherethepatientsshownoevidenceof peripheral IgE nevertheless may show local responses indicative of IgE-mediated disease and IgE-encoding transcripts have been isolated at such sites [53, 54] .

Nevertheless, so far they have found little demonstrated application in studies of allergen-specific IgE although comments made in the literature [60] have suggested that efforts are underwaytoimplementsuchtechnologiesforthispurpose.TherarityofIgE-producing cells of the B cell lineage (even in atopic subjects <1% of peripheral blood CD138+ plasmacellsproduceIgE [61, 62] )isamajorhurdleintheseefforts.Ontheotherhand thelikelyoligoclonalIgEresponsetoalimitedsetofwell-definedallergensisafactthat favours efforts of scientists to analyse the IgE repertoire.

These findings demonstrate the potentialofsuchcellmanipulationtechnologiesforresearchonhumanallergen-specific IgGantibodyresponsesandraisehopetousethesetechniquesalsoforIgE.\n\nAs it has been proven difficult so far to use conventional B cell immortalization technology to isolate IgE-producing cell lines or genes, our current knowledge of allergen-specific human IgE relies on the isolation of genes encoding allergen-specific antibody fragments from combinatorial libraries [67] [74] demonstrated isolation of allergen-specific antibody fragments from a library created from genes encoding the IgE Fd regions in combination with genes encoding L chains. All future efforts have essentially followed this plan although with certain modifications, such as the implementation of libraries encodingantibodyfragmentsinthesinglechainfragmentvariable(scFv)formatandin one case by use of synthetic instead of B-cell derived L chain diversity [75] . Antibody libraries have been created from a diverse range of lymphocyte sources and used to identify allergen-specific binders specific for e.g. grass and tree pollen, mite, milk and latex allergens from IgE repertoires ( \n\nMorethan15yearshavepassedsincethefirstapplicationofphagedisplaytechnology to isolate allergen-specific IgE-derived binders from combinatorial libraries based on thediversityofHchainsofIgE-producingBcell.However,onlyfewallergen-specificIgE binders have been selected to date (Table 1) . Nevertheless, an inspection of selected binders so far identifies a few points of particular interest. Firstly, the collection of allergen-specificIgEishighlydiverseandtheseproteinsoriginatefromrearrangements involvingarangeofVgenesandVgenesubgroups.AllimmunoglobulinHchainVgene subgroupsexcepttwoveryminorsubgroups(IGHV6andIGHV7)areusedeveninthis relativelysmallsetofspecificantibodies.SeveralclonesfromIGHV6havebeenisolated but they are highly multireactive and able to bind to a range of unrelated target molecules [37] .Antibodieswithsuchspurious,poly-reactivebindingpropertiesarenot included in this description. The allergen-specific IgE repertoire is dominated by the IGHV3 subgroup, the dominant subgroup of human immunoglobulins in general [27] .\n\nSeveraldifferentgenesofthissubgroup(suchasIGHV3-07,3-09,3-11,3-21,3-23,3-30, 3-30-3 3-43, 3-53) have been identified as being represented in this collection of IgE.\n\nTherepertoireisthushighlydiverseintermsofitsgeneticorigin.TheCDRH3sequences, akeyspecificity-determiningfeatureofantibodies [19, 29] ,ofselectedallergen-specific IgE have an average length (15\u00b14.5 residues; n=39) very close to that of other human antibodies [92] [93] [94] . Average allergen-specific IgE responses thus appear to be quite Table 3 ) and it should not be 13 anticipatedthataffinitiesofclonesbythistechnologytrulymimicthoseofIgEfoundin vivo. Importantly though it has been possible to isolate IgE with a large range of affinities,evenabove10 9 M -1 (seeforinstanceChristensenetal. [87] ,Gadermaieretal.\n\n[20], Jylh\u00e4 et al. [90] , and Levin et al. [78] ). The availability of reagents with such differentbehavioursisimportantbothfortechnicaldevelopment,forinstanceinassay standardization, but also for the elucidation of biological outcomes of IgE-allergen interactions,asfurtherdiscussedinsection6. (Table 1) [77, 78] . In contrast, the IgE response to the group 2 grass pollen allergenappearstobedominatedbyaveryrestrictedsetofantibodies [79] targetinga limited number of epitopes (Table 1 ) [80] . These findings illustrate the diversity of modes whereby antibodies recognize different allergens, even as these originate from thesameallergensource.\n\nDue to the importance of IgE in a major set of diseases and our relative ignorance of howIgEcontributestotheallergicreactionthereisanunmetneedtoestablishreagents thatcanbeusedtoanalyzeitsmodeofaction.Initialstudieshaveindeeduncoveredthe potentialofsuchreagentsandhowtheycanbeusedforinstancetodefineindetailthe parametersthatgoverntheroleofIgEinallergicreactions(seesection6).Weenvisage thatwithaccesstomuchlargercohortsofantibodiesthatdefinethehumanIgEomewe willbeinapositiontodefinehowtheseantibodiesandtheirinteractionwithaplethora of allergens cause allergic disease. We also envisage that human IgE may serve additional roles in research and in the development of appropriate diagnostic singleand multiplex assay procedures and of new tools such as novel hypoallergens, as describedbyLevinetal. [78] .HumanmonoclonalIgEwithanorigininallergicpatients' IgErepertoiresrepresentarenewable,well-definedresourceofreagentsthatarelikely toperformwellforsuchpurposes.\n\nApart from human IgE, there are other sources of antibodies that target antigens also targetedbyhumanIgE.Suchantibodiesrangefromstraightforwardpolyclonalantisera tosophisticatedrecombinantantibodies.\n\nTheground-breakingworkofK\u00f6hlerandMilsteinandtheircolleaguesinthe1970s [95] who developed the first successful technology for the production of monoclonal antibodies by fusing antibody-secreting plasma cells with immortalized neoplastic plasmacelllinesprovidedthefirstpossibilitytocreatemonoclonalantibodiesofknown specificity. Such antibodies offer distinct advantages over polyclonal antisera, such as beingasingledefinedentityandanessentiallyunlimitedresource.Thefirstmonoclonal IgEantibodiesofmouseoriginweresubsequentlygeneratedbyhybridomatechnology [96] [97] [98] . These developments paved the way for more detailed studies of the effects causedbyIgE-allergeninteractions. Recombinant approaches further enabled a transition from exclusively mouse-derived monoclonal antibodies to chimeric molecules consisting of V regions from mouse with constant regions of human isotypes [102, 103] . Already in 1985, Neuberger et al.\n\nwith preserved human effector functions. Its H chain was a combination of a mouse V region and a human epsilon constant region, but the L chain still remained fully of mouseorigin [104] .Inananalogouswayamouse/humanchimericIgEspecificforthe major house dust mite allergen Der p 2 was constructed by Schuurman et al. [105] .\n\nSubsequentchimerizationeffortsproducedIgEcarryingbothHaswellastheLchains with human constant domains [106, 107] . Altogether, several different routes can be used to exploit murine antibody specificities in the context of human IgE functionality for a variety of purposes. Several of these murine antibodies have been used together with one set of clonally related human IgE in ground-breaking studies investigating factors affecting effector cell degranulation through IgE-allergen interaction [88] as outlinedinsection6.\n\nHowever,murineIgEVregionsmayrecognizeepitopesthatdifferfromthoseboundby human IgE. This has been seen in a number of immune responses and lately also in antibodiesspecificforthegrasspollenallergenPhlp1 [78] .Particularcaremustthusbe takenwhenmouseantibodiesareusedasmodelsforhumanIgE-allergeninteractions.\n\nAsanotheralternativetohumanIgE,humanallergen-specificantibodiesoforiginsother thanIgEhavebeendeveloped.Forinstance,monoclonalIgEantibodiesspecificforthe majorbirchpollenallergenBetv1wereselectedfromhumanantibodylibrariescreated fromhumanBcellsthathadbeeninducedtoundergoisotypeswitchingtoIgEinvitro (i.e.fromBcellsthatproducedotherisotypesinvivo)priortotheisolationofmRNAfor library construction [108] . Furthermore, Visco et al. [63] stimulated human B cells obtained from desensitized subjects to isolate Bet v 1-specific human IgG-producing clones.

IgE-binding regionsmaybedetermineddirectlybyscreeningallergen-derivedsyntheticpeptidesor recombinantfragmentswithmonoclonalIgEantibodies [77, 80] .Theinjectionofthese derivatives into rodents leads to the production of specific antibodies which can be alternatively used to locate the epitope by applying them for the competition with the IgE of interest for allergen binding [113] . Further, peptides that represent structural mimics of antigenic determinants but have no sequence relation with the parental allergenmaybeusedtoidentifyepitopes [114, 115] .Thesemimotopescanbeisolated byscreeningrandompeptidelibrariesdisplayedonthesurfaceofbacteriophages [116, 117] or synthetic peptide libraries [118] with the IgE of interest and appropriate algorithms (e.g. EpiSearch [119] ) help to match the mimotopes on the surface of the three-dimensionalallergenstructure.Additionalinsilicomethodshavebeendeveloped targetingthepredictionofepitopeslikethesoftwareSPADEwhichcombinesstructural and cross-reactivity data and therefore localizes epitopes [120]. All these mentioned methods have in common that they only encircle the epitope. The tricky business to preciselypinpointtheinteractingresiduesontheepitopeandtheparatopecanonlybe fulfilled by the determination of the three-dimensional structure of the antibody-allergencomplexbyX-raycrystallography.\n\nOnlytwohumanIgE-allergencomplexes(inbothcasestheIgEhadbeenisolatedfrom combinatorial libraries) have been resolved so far [81, 89] . In the first case an IgE-derivedFabfragmentwascomplexedwithamajorfoodallergen, -lactoglobulinfrom bovine milk [89] while the second complex was formed between an IgE Fab and the major timothy grass pollen allergen, Phl p 2 [81] . These Fabs recognized flat [89] or slightly concave [81] epitopes that were comprised of discontinuous stretches of residuesmainlylocatedwithinthefour-stranded strandsoftheallergens.Incontrast, in the small number of solved mouse IgG-allergen complexes, IgG tend to favour the bindingofprotrudingregionsoftheallergen [121] [122] [123] .However,thetemptationtoset up a new paradigm supposing IgE epitopes to be the planar/concave counterparts (locatedon\u03b2-strands)toloopingIgGepitopesisdefeatedbytwoarguments.First,the scan of available allergen structures reveals that there is no common conformation in allergenicmolecules.Thereareallergenswithalmostexclusive\u03b2-sheetstructurenextto allergens with mixed -sheet/ -helical structure or exclusively -helical structures (reviewed in [124] ). The second argument that prohibits the immediate acceptance of such a paradigm is the latest mouse IgG-allergen complex [125] that shows that the CDR3 region of the antibody is grabbing into a concave epitope. Determination of Several assessments that have been performed over the years to contribute to this subject revealed controversial outcomes. During the course of isolation of monoclonal human IgE antibody fragments, it was found that some but certainly not all allergen-specificHchainswereabletocombinewithdifferentLchainswithsequencevariations of different extents. Their maintained allergen-binding potential suggests a dominant rolefortheHchainintermsofspecificityinthesecases [74, 76, 83] .Incontrast,dueto the results of other studies the conclusion might be drawn that L chains have an essentialroleinthedefinitionofspecificity:somelightchainscombinedwithdifferentH chains and the resulting antibody fragments bound to the same target [90] . In this contextitwasfurtherreportedforPhlp2-specific [79] aswellasother [76] allergen-specificmonoclonalhumanIgEantibodyfragmentsfromcombinatoriallibrariesthata given set of H chain sequences is mostly selected together with similar L chains.\n\nAddressing the aspect of L chain importance for allergen affinity, it was reported that shufflingofLchainsbetweendifferenthumanDerp2-specificIgEderivedfrommurine monoclonalIgGantibodiesresultedinantibodyfragmentswithalteredaffinityforDerp 2 [88] .\n\nArecentlypublishedstudy [20] providesnewresultsthatmayhelptoshedsomelight on these controversies.

The resulting antibody fragments were analyzed for binding specificities, affinities and epitope recognition. It was shown that the H chains in allergen-specific IgEs are mainly responsible for the determination of specificity, whereas pairing of H chainswithdifferentLchainshasaneffectontheaffinityofthefragments.Interestingly, the pairing with different L chains may also influence the fine-specificity in terms of epitope recognition as some of the shuffled fragments recognize an epitope that is different from the parental epitope. So, whereas this study reports the recognition of differentepitopesduetolightchainshuffling,insimilaritytoaninvitroevolutionstudy by Bostr\u00f6m et al.

Since then a lot of studies have been performed using 20 mainly the ISAC microarray technology [16] to evaluate IgE specificity of allergic patientstoabroadpanelofallergens.However,manyoftheserecentstudiesreporton the dissection of IgE reactivity in large patient cohorts by microarray technique focussingonseraderivedfromjustonepointintimeofobservation [130] [131] [132] .Inthese cross-sectional evaluations the general distribution of IgE reactivities to allergenic moleculesintermsofdifferentage,environmentandgenderwasinvestigated [130, 131, 133, 134] . In fact, it could be proven that food-related components (i.e., milk and egg)\n\nwere the most frequently recognized allergens early in life (0-4 years) whereas birchandgrass-specificIgEinvariablyappearedlater(notbefore3yearsofage).IgEspecific forhousedustmitecomponentswasthemostrepresentedspecificityinallinvestigated ageclasses(0-65years)reachingamaximumbetween6and17yearsofage [130, 131] .\n\nThese findings confirmed earlier but much less comprehensive data collected when patients\u00b4 IgE profiles were still determined towards grass and birch pollen using singleplex assay systems [135] [136] [137] . It thus appears that the \"IgE repertoire\" evolves over time as assessed at the polyclonal level. Nevertheless, to fully appreciate the dynamics of the \"IgE repertoire\", sera from single individuals collected over several yearshavetobeanalyzedbytheISACtechnique.Tworecentlypublishedstudiescover exactly this important topic [138, 139] using the ISAC technology they found no sensitization to new allergen families. They concluded that de novo sensitization seems to be a rare event in adults [138] . The second study dealt with the evolution of IgE sensitization in children affected by seasonalallergicrhinitiscausedbygrasspollen.Theinvestigatedbloodsamplesderived fromaperiodof1-13years.ItrevealedthatPhlp1wasaninitiatorofsensitizationin more than 75% of the individuals meaning that many children started as monosensitized patients. Only later, IgE levels were detectable for Phl p 5 and/or Phl p 4 (oligo-sensitized)andfinallyforPhlp2and/orPhlp6and/orPhlp11(poly-sensitized) [139] . These results clearly indicated that the IgE response became progressively stronger and more complex during childhood and early adolescence. As these examinations were conducted only with sera from german children deriving from one birthcohort,morecomprehensiveinvestigationsonchangesofspecificserumIgElevels including huge cohorts of children and adolescents are needed. A recently started EuropeanUnionproject,MeDALL(MechanismsoftheDevelopmentofALLergy) [140] is currently performing such comprehensive investigations on IgE sensitizations.

Already in 2007, Gieras et al. [146] showed that the number of IgE epitopes on a given allergen determines its allergenic activity. Using a defined peptide monomer (i.e. one epitope), dimer (i.e. two epitopes) and multimer (i.e. several epitopes) of the major grass pollen allergen, Phl p 1, the authors were able to demonstrate that the increasing number of epitopes led to an enhanced release of inflammatory mediators. These observations were confirmed in studies of the major housedustmiteallergen,Derp2 [88] .ByusingapanelofmonoclonalDerp2-specific IgE antibodies that bind to non-overlapping epitopes they could demonstrate that increase of the IgE clonality as well as higher affinity of individual IgE antibodies augmentedbasophilsensitivity.Moreover,raisingtheconcentrationofallergen-specific IgE caused an increased effector cell degranulation [146] . By using different concentrations of IgE mixtures consisting of 20% equimolar quantities of three monoclonal Der p 2-specific IgE antibodies with 80% of non-Der p 2 specific IgE to imitateatypicalallergicIgErepertoire,itturnedoutthathighertotalIgEconcentrations increased basophil sensitivity and maximal degranulation levels [88] . By changing the ratio of Der p 2-specific IgE /non-Der p 2-specific IgE it could be clearly shown that 100%ofequimolarDerp2-specificIgEinducedmaximaldegranulationandsensitivity.\n\nAlteringtheconcentrationsofindividualDerp2-specificIgEantibodiestolevelsother than equimolar the maximal degranulation was reduced remarkably [88] . Altogether, thesestudiesdemonstratethatthemakeupoftheIgEpopulation,i.e.theIgErepertoire, isanimportantfactorthatdeterminestheoutcomeoftheIgE-allergeninteraction.\n\nBesidesaffectingbasophilsandmastcells,IgEplaysanimportantrolebyaffectingTcell activation. Indeed, IgE has been shown to promote facilitated antigen presentation (FAP) [147] . Based on these studies and the disposability of defined antibodies, it was demonstratedthattheIgErepertoirecomplexityandtheaffinityofIgEantibodieshavea strong influence also on the FAP-mediated T cell activation [144] . By measuring the formation of allergen/IgE/CD23 complex on B cells as surrogate parameter for FAP-mediatedTcellproliferation,thecombinationofthreehighaffinitynon-overlappingIgE antibodies were proven to elicit maximal complex formation. In contrast, the combinationofonehighandonelowaffinityIgEresultedinanintermediateresponse.\n\nOnly when a third low affinity IgE binding to a non-overlapping epitope was added to this mixture maximal complex formation could be achieved. Through these important experimentsitturnedoutthatforFAP-mediatedTcellactivationIgEclonalityismore important for providing the avidity required for efficient complex formation than for basophilactivation [144] .\n\nThe above-described data clearly demonstrate that distinct properties of the IgE repertoiredeterminevariableeffectorcellandTcellactivationinresponsetoallergen challenge. We foresee that further investigations of these important aspects of allergic disease will require new defined antibody reagents. As human monoclonal antibodies are likely to best represent the relevant antibody populations in patients, we firmly 24 believe that there is a substantial need for further developments in the field of generationofsuchantibodiesagainstallergens.\n\nThe development of our understanding of the IgE antibody repertoire has relied on rather low throughput methodology both in terms of transcriptome analysis and the generationofspecificbindersderivedfromthehumanIgEome.Yetsuchtechnologyhas been able to provide a first picture of IgE-encoding transcriptomes as well as a first generation of human monoclonal antibodies from that population of transcripts. We anticipate that developments in high throughput sequencing technology, approaches that already have made substantial impact on our understanding of other human antibodyrepertoiresinhealthanddisease [27, 148] ,willcontributesubstantiallytoour understanding of IgE in disease. We also envisage that by exploiting high throughput methodology [149, 150] in selection of binders from libraries will make substantial contributiontoincreasethenumberofantigen-specificantibodiesderivedfromtheIgE transcriptome thereby providing access to a large source of antibodies that mimic the repertoire of IgE found in vivo. Furthermore, the realization of efficient techniques to identify human IgE-producing single cells and to rescue IgE-encoding genes directly fromsuchcellswillcertainlyfurtherimproveourconfidenceinhumanmonoclonalIgE in the future as such technology holds promise to eliminate biases that may be introduced by combinatorial antibody procedures.
