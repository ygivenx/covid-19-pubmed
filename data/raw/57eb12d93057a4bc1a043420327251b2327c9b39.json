Delayed detection and resulting widespread distributions of EVD have significantly contributed to epidemic growth. 9 Containment strategies which prioritize isolation over care can be counterproductive by discouraging sick individuals from presenting to high-mortality Ebola units. [10] [11] [12] Unreported cases occurred at higher rates during the early period of the 2013-2016 West Africa outbreak, 13 and urban transmission may also occur at a higher rate than rural transmission. 14 Change to subcritical transmission (reproduction number below 1) tends to occur when Ebola response organizations deploy control, prevention and care measures, 15, 16 communities adopt more protective behaviors, 17, 18 and/or transmission decreases in a social network. 19, 20 In the current Ebola outbreak in DRC, scientific advances with rapid diagnostics and vaccines from the West Africa outbreak has the potential to limit Ebola virus transmission as they are being deployed. [21] [22] [23] We used reported case counts from the current outbreak and/or time series from 18 prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without the use of vaccines. These projections are intended to help organizations anticipate and allocate sufficient resources to the 2018 Ebola outbreak in DRC.\n\nWe used the following methods to generate projections: a stochastic branching process model, 24 statistical regression based on prior outbreaks, and Gott's Law. 25 On May 27, 54 EVD cases were reported in three locations (Iboko, Bikoro, and Mbandaka) (Figure 1 ). Based on EVD situation reports from DRC, we assumed the ring vaccination campaign would start on May 26.\n\nWe modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process model, parameterized by transmission rates estimated from the dynamics of prior Ebola outbreaks, and conditioned on agreement with reported case counts from the current outbreak to date. We incorporated high and low estimates of vaccination coverage into this model. Then we generated a set of probabilistic projections of the size and duration of simulated outbreaks in the current setting.\n\nTo estimate the reproduction number R as a function of the number of days from the beginning of the outbreak, we included reported cases by date from thirteen prior outbreaks and excluded the first historical outbreak reported in those countries (e.g., 1976 outbreak in Yambuko, DRC) (Supplement 1). [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] As there is a difference in the Ebola response system as well as community sensitization to EVD following a country's first outbreak, we employed this inclusion criterion to reflect the Ebola response system in DRC during what is now its ninth outbreak. We used the Wallinga-Teunis technique to estimate R for each case and therefore for each reporting date in the outbreak. 34 The serial interval distribution used for this estimation was a gamma distribution with a mean of 14.5 days and a standard deviation of 5 days, with intervals rounded to the nearest whole number of days, consistent with the understanding that the serial interval of EVD cases ranges from 3 to 36 days with mean 14 to 15 days.\n\nWe fit a curve R = R0 e -\u03c4d to each outbreak's estimates of R by day d, initial reproduction number R0 and quenching rate \u03c4 (Supplement 2).\n\nWe modeled transmission using a stochastic branching process model in which the number of secondary cases caused by any given primary case is drawn from a negative binomial distribution whose mean is the reproduction number R, and variance is controlled by a dispersion parameter k. 35, 36 All transmission events were assumed to be independent. The interval between date of detection of each primary case and that of each of its secondary cases is assumed gamma distributed with mean 14.5 days and standard deviation 5 days, rounded to the nearest whole number of days, as above. The pair of parameters R0 and \u03c4 estimated for the different past outbreaks used, and dispersion parameter k, were used in all possible combinations (with R0 and \u03c4 taken as a unit) to simulate outbreaks.\n\nThis model generated randomly varying simulated outbreaks with a range of case counts per day. The outbreak was assumed to begin on April 4 with a single case. The simulation process occurs as follows: proposed epidemic trajectories are generated in an initial step based on the above branching process, and these are then subsequently filtered by discarding all but those whose cumulative case counts match the known counts of the current DRC outbreak on known dates ( Table 1 ). The filtration accepts epidemics within a range of 3 cases more or less than each recorded value.

This filtered ensemble is then used to generate projections of the eventual outcome of the outbreak. 14 To model vaccination coverage with respect to total transmission (unreported and reported), we multiplied the estimate of vaccine effectiveness by low and high estimates of reported cases. In a ring vaccination study at the end of the West Africa outbreak, the overall estimated rVSV-vectored vaccine efficacy was 100% and vaccine effectiveness was 64.6% in protecting all contacts and contacts of contacts from EVD in the randomized clusters, including unvaccinated cluster members. 22 We designed the stochastic model using vaccine effectiveness. Then, we used past estimates of the proportion of unreported cases to estimate the proportion of exposed individuals not covered by the vaccination process. Based on a Sierra Leonean study from the 2013-2016 outbreak, 13 we estimated that the proportion of reported cases in DRC would rise over time from a low of 68% to a high of 96%. Given these low and high estimates of reported cases and the estimate of vaccine effectiveness, a low estimate of vaccination program coverage was 44% (68% * 64.6%) and a high estimate of vaccination program coverage was 62% (96% * 64.6%). We modeled the course of the outbreak with and without the vaccination program, with the program beginning on May 26, based on dates available from situation reports. 4\n\nIn the 2013-2016 West Africa outbreak, the mean time from symptom onset to reporting was found to be approximately 4 days. 37 Based on that estimate, we assumed a four-day period of transmission, with mean time of a All rights reserved.

Based on this, we modeled transmission from a primary case to a secondary case using the value of R corresponding to two days before the reporting date of the primary case.\n\nFrom 122,683,392 simulated outbreaks, 904 were retained after filtering on approximate agreement with DRC case counts. The simulated outbreaks that were retained after filtering were continued until they generated no further cases.\n\nWe used this ensemble to derive a distribution of outbreak sizes and durations.\n\nWe calculated mean and median values and 95% credible intervals using the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of simulated outbreak size and duration. We conducted the analyses using R 3.4.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

To reduce the influence of outliers and high leverage points, and to improve linearity, we calculated the pseudologarithm transform f(x)=arcsinh(x/2), asymptotically logarithmic but wellbehaved at 0. We used non-parametric Theil-Sen regression (R-package mblm) followed by calculation of the resulting prediction interval for a new observation. 45, 46 Finally, we reported the median and 95% central coverage intervals for the prediction distribution conditional on the value being no smaller than the observed value on day 34. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using ordinary least squares regression. We conducted these analyses using R 3.4.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\n\nWe applied Gott's Law to estimate the outbreak size using data from early in the current outbreak period. 25 With Gott's Law, we assume we have no special knowledge of our position on the epidemic curve. If we assume a non-informative uniform prior for the portion of the epidemic that still remains, the resulting probability distribution for the remaining number of cases y is P(Y=y)= Y0/y 2 . We estimated the median outbreak size, along with the two-sided 95% confidence interval.\n\nAs of May 27, 2018, there were 54 EVD cases (Table 1, Figure 1 ).

This outbreak still has the potential to become the largest outbreak in DRC since 2007, regardless of vaccine use. Introduction of Ebola virus into Mbandaka with its over 700,000-person population resulted in multiple transmission chains and redoubles the importance of an adequate influx of support for response team efforts to implement interventions that control and prevent the spread of EVD. While real-time modeling projections historically overestimate outbreak size and duration, 47, 48 this study exemplifies how simple mathematical models can be useful for advising real-time decision making because they provide rapid projections and similar estimates of R as compared to complex models. 49 Vaccine use, regardless of 62% or 44% coverage levels, is projected to provide a limited preventive benefit, which may be partially due to timing of implementation (after predicted peak of the epidemic curve). As such, the massive mobilization of resources to roll it out should not detract from the prioritization of patient and survivor care, lest we recapitulate the control-overcare paradigm that marred the response to the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa.

Projection distributions are rightskewed, with long tails (and we therefore report the median instead of the mean).\n\nWhile there have been 22 observed EVD outbreaks with a case count greater than ten cases, we were unable to include all prior outbreaks in our estimates due to data availability. 44, 54 Note that the simple regression projection is based entirely on past outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (measured and reported in different ways), and cannot account for the improved control measures and vaccination in the way that a mechanistic model does. We included, however, as much real-time information into our estimates as possible, but situations such as the introduction of EVD into a large urban population and implementation of RDTs and vaccines are new to DRC. We did not include vaccination of healthcare workers in the stochastic model. Our estimates of vaccination All rights reserved.

A strength of our approach was the use of multiple methods to estimate the outbreak size, even though Gott's Law has not been validated for outbreak projections.\n\nAs of May 27, the epidemic curve of the EVD outbreak is thought to be declining, even though EVD transmission entered an urban setting. We do not believe this outbreak will be a repeat of the 2013-2016 West African one.\n\nIntroduction of vaccines will limit transmission, even with lower levels of vaccination coverage, and DRC has the significant experience of eight prior outbreaks. As vaccine coverage is scaled up, an influx of support is warranted to support and bolster the evolving rapid response and be continued during the post-outbreak period. Stronger surveillance, preparedness, and health systems are needed to detect EVD cases before transmission threatens an even larger populace during future outbreaks. contributed to concept and design, interpretation, revising, and final approval;\n\nand T.C.P. contributed to concept and design, analysis, interpretation, revising, and final approval. a."}
