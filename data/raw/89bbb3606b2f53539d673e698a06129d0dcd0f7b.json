{"title": "Inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity by the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus nonstructural protein 1 for innate immune evasion", "body": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting, watery diarrhea and a high mortality rate in neonatal piglets (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980; Junwei et al., 2006; Song and Park, 2012; Sun et al., 2012) . The current virulent PED outbreaks started in China in the late 2010 and quickly spread to other countries in Asia, causing significant economic losses in the swine industry (Sun et al., 2015 (Sun et al., , 2012 . PED emerged in the US for the first time in April 2013 and resulted in more than 8 million deaths of pig in less than 8 months of the first outbreak. Marthaler et al., 2013; Mole, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013) .\n\nPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family (http:// ictvonline.org/virustaxonomy.asp). The PEDV genome is a singlestranded, positive-sense RNA of \u223c28 kb in length with a 5'-cap and a 3'-polyadenylated tail. It encodes two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1a/b), an accessory protein (ORF3), and four structural proteins (spike S, envelope E, membrane M, and nucleocapsid N, envelope E, membrane M, and nucleocapsid N) (Duarte et al., 1993; Kocherhans et al., 2001) . Pp1a and pp1a/b are processed to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) by the proteinase activity of nsp3 and nsp5. Among nsps, nsp1 is the most N-terminal and first cleavage product (Ziebuhr, 2005) .\n\nVirus-infected cells react quickly to invading viruses by producing type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and establish an antiviral state, which provides a first line of defense against viral infection. The viral nucleic acids are sensed by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as transmembrane toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasmic RNA/DNA sensors (Kawai and Akira, 2011) . This recognition leads to the activation of cytosolic kinases which promotes the activation of IFN regulator factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), and their subsequent translocation to the nucleus allows them to bind to their respective positive regulatory domain (PRD) for production of type I IFNs (Honda et al., 2006) . The activated IRF3/IRF7 bind to the PRD I/III sequences and induces the expression of type I IFN genes (Hermant and Michiels, 2014) . For NF-\u03baB, the activated form is translocated to the nucleus and triggers IFN-\u03b2 expression by binding to the PRD II element (Escalante et al., 2002) . Type I IFNs are then secreted and bind to their receptors on virus-infected cells as well as uninfected neighbor cells, and activate the JAK/STAT pathway to produce hundreds of interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs) to establish an antiviral state (Stark and Darnell, 2012) . In unstimulated cells, NF-\u03baB (p50/p65 heterocomplex) remains associated with the inhibitory protein I\u03baB\u03b1 masking the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of NF-\u03baB and sequesters the NF-\u03baB\u00b7I\u03baB\u03b1 complex in the cytoplasm. The NF-\u03baB signaling pathway may be activated by intracellular products such as IL-1 and TNF\u03b1 that are induced by viral infections or extracellular stress such as phorbol esters and UV (Campbell and Perkins, 2006; Ghosh et al., 1998) . Activated NF-\u03baB then induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines and regulates a variety of gene expressions, which affects cell survival, differentiation, immunity, and proliferation (Hayden and Ghosh, 2012) . TNF\u03b1 binds to its receptor and initiates a signaling cascade culminating the activation of I\u03baB kinase complex (IKK\u03b1/\u03b2). The IKK complex then phosphorylates I\u03baB\u03b1 to mediate ubiquitination and degradation and releases NF-\u03baB. Released NF-\u03baB is transported to the nucleus, where it binds to target sequences and initiates transcriptions (Hayden and Ghosh, 2012; Napetschnig and Wu, 2013; Verstrepen et al., 2008) .\n\nTo circumvent such responses of the cell, many viruses have developed various strategies to evade the host innate immunity. We have previously reported that PEDV suppresses the type I interferon and ISGs productions and have identified nsp1 as the potent viral IFN antagonist . PEDV nsp1 causes the CREB-binding protein (CBP) degradation in the nucleus and antagonizes the IFN production and signaling . Despite the importance of NF-\u03baB during infection, regulation of NF-\u03baB by PEDV is poorly understood. The PEDV N protein blocks the NF-\u03baB activity and inhibits the IFN-\u03b2 production and IFN stimulating genes (ISGs) expression (Ding et al., 2014) . PEDV nsp5 is a 3C-like proteinase and cleaves the NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO) , suggesting that PEDV has the ability for NF-\u03baB suppression. Although PEDV has been shown to activate NF-\u03baB at a late stage of infection (Cao et al., 2015b; Xing et al., 2013) , it is unclear whether it is time-dependent and TNF\u03b1-mediated. In the present study, we show the inhibition of NF-\u03baB, and temporal regulation of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines by PEDV. Among PEDV proteins, nsp1, nsp3, nsp5, nsp7, nsp14, nsp15, nsp16, ORF3 , and E were identified as NF-\u03baB antagonists with nsp1 being the most potent. We also showed that the conserved residues of nsp1 were crucial for NF-\u03baB suppression. The nsp1mediated NF-\u03baB modulation may facilitate the replication and pathogenesis of PEDV.\n\nThe primary target cells for PEDV in pigs are villous epithelial cells of the intestinal tract (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980; Lee et al., 2000; Sueyoshi et al., 1995) . Vero cells are commonly used for the study of PEDV, but these cells are deficient for type I IFN genes, and we have previously identified MARC-145 as an additional cell line permissive for PEDV. In these cells, PEDV has been shown to inhibit type I IFN production . However, MARC-145 cells are originated from monkey kidney epithelium, and porcine epithelial cells will serve a better model to study the innate immune regulation for PEDV. To this aim, we identified LLC-PK1 as a permissive cell line for PEDV. LLC-PK1 is of porcine kidney epithelial cells, and we found that these cells efficiently supported PEDV infection. Even at an MOI of 0.01, almost 100% of LLC-PK1 cells became infected by 24 h of infection (data not shown). Western blot analysis of PEDV N protein confirmed the productive infection in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 1A) . To examine the growth of PEDV, LLC-PK1, MARC-145, and Vero cells were infected with the virus at a low MOI (0.01), and the culture supernatants were collected to determine the titers at different times of infection. The growth curves show the productive infection of PEDV in these cells (Sup Fig. 1A ). Similar growth kinetics was observed for Vero and MARC-145 cells. PEDV induced extensive cell fusion in Vero cells and these cells died by 24 h post-infection (hpi). LLC-PK1 cells supported PEDV growth most efficiently, and the peak viral titer was as high as 10 7.5 TCID 50 /ml at 48 hpi (Sup Fig. 1A ), compared to 10 5 TCID 50 /ml in MARC-145 cells. The one-step growth curve for PEDV was determined by infecting with a high MOI of 5. Syncytia formation characteristic for PEDV was evident as early as 9 hpi in PEDV-infected cells (Sup Fig. 1B, arrows) . The one step growth curve showed that PEDV replicated in LLC-PK1 cells most effectively compared to MARC-145 and Vero cells (Sup Fig. 1C ). To examine the type I IFN regulation in LLC-PK1 by PEDV, cells were infected with the virus, and RT-qPCR was conducted for both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 mRNAs. While poly(I:C) induced the production of IFN-\u03b1 and INF-\u03b2 in uninfected LLC-PK1 cells as anticipated, hardly any IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 were produced in PEDVinfected LLC-PK1 cells especially at 8-24 hpi (Fig. 1B) . Even at 5 MOI, PEDV infection did not induce type I IFNs (Fig. 1C) and also inhibited the production of type I IFNs even when stimulated with poly(I:C) (Fig. 1D, E) , further confirming the suppression of type I IFN production by PEDV.\n\nEvidence suggests that PEDV modulates innate immune response for optimal viral replication (Annamalai et al., 2015; . PEDV may also have the ability to modulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines for viral pathogenesis and virulence. To determine this possibility, we assessed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in virus-infected cells. LLC-PK1 cells were infected with PEDV, and total RNA was prepared at different times to determine different cytokine gene expressions by RT-qPCR using specific primers (Table 2) . PEDV infection caused down-regulation of TNF\u03b1 during 8-12 hpi, but later times of 24-30 hpi, its expression was upregulated ( Fig. 2A) . The IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels were significantly downregulated at early times (8-24 hpi) and returned to the basal level by 30 hpi (Fig. 2B) . The IL-6 mRNA expression was also suppressed at 8-18 hpi but became activated at 30 hpi (Fig. 2C) . Similarly, the IL-15 expression was inhibited at early times (8-18 hpi) but activated later times of infection (24-30 hpi) (Fig. 2D) . The IL-17 expression was also suppressed at 8-24 hpi but upregulated at 30 hpi (Fig. 2E) , and the TGF-\u03b23 expression was inhibited at 12 and 24 hpi (Fig. 2F ). These results demonstrate that PEDV regulated the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a time-dependent manner. This was confirmed in two other cell types, MARC-145 and Vero, using TNF\u03b1 mRNA. PRRSV is known to suppress TNF\u03b1 production (Subramaniam et al., 2010) and VSV is known to activate TNF\u03b1 production (Garcia et al., 2009) , and thus both viruses were included as controls. As anticipated, PRRSV inhibited the expression of TNF\u03b1 at 18 hpi, whereas VSV activated the TNF\u03b1 expression continuously over time (Fig. 2G ). In both PEDVinfected MARC-145 cells and Vero cells, the TNF\u03b1 expression was suppressed at early times (6-18 hpi) and became activated later (24 hpi), confirming the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by PEDV at early times.\n\nThe NF-\u03baB signaling is a central pathway regulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines (Blackwell and Christman, 1997) . Viral infections can trigger NF-\u03baB activation and produce TNF\u03b1 and IL-1, which in turn may activate NF-\u03baB in a positive regulatory loop (Barnes and Karin, 1997) . This positive feedback mechanism may amplify and perpetuate local inflammatory reactions. To understand the basis for PEDV suppression of early proinflammatory cytokines, we first examined whether PEDV induced the NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation. LLC-PK1 cells were infected with PEDV and treated with TNF\u03b1, followed by costaining with anti-p65 mAb and anti-PEDV N mAb. Without TNF\u03b1 treatment, p65 remained in the cytoplasm as anticipated. When stimulated with TNF\u03b1, however, p65 was translocated to the nucleus in uninfected cells (Fig. 3A , white arrows). Interestingly in PEDVinfected cells, p65 remained in the cytoplasm, and even after stimulation with TNF\u03b1, p65 was not translocated to the nucleus and remained in the cytoplasm in virus-infected cells (Fig. 3A , yellow arrows), indicating that NF-\u03baB activation by TNF\u03b1 was inhibited by PEDV. Only a minimal fraction of PEDV-infected cells showed p65 in the nucleus at late infection. The ratios for p65 nuclear translocation were quantified in PEDV-infected cells (Fig. 3B ). PEDV did not induce p65 nuclear translocation through 12 hpi, and only approximately 4% of PEDVinfected cells showed p65 in the nucleus at 18-24 hpi in the absence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation. The suppression of p65 in PEDV-infected cells after TNF\u03b1 stimulation was proportional to viral replication with the peak at 10 hpi followed by a gradual decrease. This result indicates that PEDV suppresses early NF-\u03baB activation. Two other cell types permissive for PEDV were examined for p65 nuclear translocation. Similar to LLC-PK1, both MARC-145 and ST cells showed the lack of p65 nuclear translocation when infected with PEDV and stimulated with TNF\u03b1 (data not shown), indicating that the PEDV-mediated NF-\u03baB suppression was cell type-independent. The p65 phosphorylation remained unchanged at the basal level in PEDV-infected cells throughout the infection (data not shown), which further confirms the cell-type independent suppression of NF-\u03baB by PEDV.\n\nOnce IRF3/7 and NF-\u03baB translocate to the nucleus, they bind to their respective PRD domains for expression of type I IFNs. Activated IRF3/7 binds to PRD I/III element in the nucleus, whereas NF-\u03baB binds to the PRD II element for IFN gene expression. Evidence shows that type I IFN suppression by PEDV is mediated through the IRF3/7 singling pathways (Cao et al., 2015a; Xing et al., 2013; . To examine whether PEDV inhibited PRD II, luciferase assays were performed. It was apparent that the PRD II activity was suppressed even when stimulated with poly(I:C) in PEDV-infected cells (Fig. 4A) , demonstrating the significant inhibition of NF-\u03baBmediated IFN production by PEDV. We previously identified ten different PEDV proteins as IFN antagonists , and these proteins suppressed the PRD I/III activity. Thus to identify PRD II antagonists among the ten viral protein, PRD II luciferase assays were conducted for these proteins. PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 (P-nsp1\u03b1) is known to inhibit PRD II and included as a positive control, and its cysteine Cells were infected with PEDV at an MOI of 1 for indicated times and the production of TNF\u03b1 was determined by RT-qPCR. PRRSV as a known inhibitor of TNF\u03b1 and VSV as a known stimulator were included as controls. Asterisks indicate statistical significance calculated by the Student's t-test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. mutant P-nsp1\u03b1(m) (C28S) was included as a negative control (Han et al., 2013; Song et al., 2010) . Upon stimulation, PRD II-dependent luciferase activities were reduced in cells expressing nsp1, nsp3, nsp14, nsp15, ORF3, E, and N protein, compared to those of pXJ41 empty vector-and GST gene-transfected cells (Fig. 4B ). These results indicate that NF-\u03baB-mediated type I IFNs suppression also participate in type I IFN suppression by these viral proteins.\n\nIn uninfected cells, NF-\u03baB was activated up to 150 folds by TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Fig. 5A ). In PEDV-infected cells, however, NF-\u03baB activation was blocked even after TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Fig. 5A) , suggesting a possible suppression of proinflammatory cytokines, in addition to the suppression of type I IFNs, by PEDV at early time of infection. It was of interest to first identify viral proteins inhibiting NF-\u03baB, and therefore individual PEDV genes were examined. As anticipated, TNF\u03b1 upregulated NF-\u03baB in cells expressing GST and P-nsp1\u03b1 (m), whereas P-nsp1\u03b1 suppressed the NF-\u03baB activity (Fig. 5B ). Of nsps of PEDV, nsp1, nsp3, nsp5, nsp7, nsp14, nsp15 and nsp16 appeared to downregulate the NF-\u03baB activity, and similarly, the ORF3 protein also downregulated NF-\u03baB (Fig. 5B ). Of structural proteins, only E protein was found to suppress the NF-\u03baB activity (Fig. 5C ). Among all NF-\u03baB antagonists, nsp1 and nsp14 appeared to be the most potent inhibitors.\n\nPEDV nsp1 is a nuclear-cytoplasmic protein and antagonizes type I IFN production by degrading the CREB-binding protein in the nucleus . In the present study, PEDV nsp1 also appeared to inhibit the activation of PRD II and NF-\u03baB ( Fig. 4B and Fig. 5B ). It seems that nsp1 blocks NF-\u03baB so as to inhibit the production of IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, it was of interest to examine Asterisks indicate statistical significance calculated by the Student's t-test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. whether nsp1 suppressed TNF\u03b1 expression. PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 (P-nsp1\u03b2) has been shown to suppress TNF\u03b1 activation by inhibiting NF-\u03baB and Sp1, and PRRSV N (P-N) does not interfere with TNF\u03b1 activation (Subramaniam et al., 2010) , and thus both constructs were included as controls. Similar to P-nsp1\u03b2, PEDV nsp1 appeared to suppress the TNF\u03b1 activation when stimulated with LPS ( Fig. 6A ). Suppression of proinflammatory cytokines by nsp1 was examined by RT-qPCR in nsp1-gene transfected cells, and the results showed that nsp1 significantly suppressed TNF\u03b1 mRNA transcription (Fig. 6B ), validating the nsp1 antagonism against TNF\u03b1 expression. PEDV nsp1 also suppressed the expression of IL-8, CXCL10, MCP-1, and RANTES ( Fig. 6B ), indicating that PEDV nsp1 was able to antagonize TNF\u03b1-mediated NF-\u03baB activation and suppressed the proinflammatory cytokines.\n\nStimulation of cytokine receptors such as those in the TNF receptor superfamily by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1 leads to activation of the IKK complex (IKK\u03b1/\u03b2). Activated IKK induces I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in its proteasomal degradation and release of NF-\u03baB for nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of target gene expressions (Napetschnig and Wu, 2013) . The p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB is a key transcription factor for downstream signaling, and in the present study, PEDV appears to inhibit p65 nuclear translocation (Fig. 3) . To investigate the mechanism of NF-\u03baB suppression by nsp1, nuclear translocation of p65 was first examined in nsp1-expressing cells. Without TNF\u03b1 stimulation, nsp1, PEDV N, and PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 did not activate p65, and it remained in the cytoplasm. When the N-expressing cells were stimulated with TNF\u03b1, p65 was activated and normally translocated to the nucleus as anticipated (Fig. 7A ). In contrast, p65 was remained in the cytoplasm in PRRSV nsp1\u03b1-expressing control cells and PEDV nsp1-expressing cells after TNF\u03b1 stimulation, indicating that PEDV nsp1 suppressed the p65 nuclear translocation. Only 10-13% of nsp1-expressing cells showed the p65 in the nucleus, whereas more than 90% of control cells showed p65 in the nucleus after TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Fig. 7B) , confirming that PEDV nsp1 blocked p65 nuclear translocation. The cell fractionation study also confirmed the blockage of p65 nuclear translocation in nsp1-expressing cells (Fig. 7C) .\n\nActivated IKK\u03b2 phosphorylates I\u03baB\u03b1 for its degradation via ubiquitination. To examine whether nsp1-mediated NF-\u03baB suppression was due to the prevention of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation was examined by Western blot. In contrast to cells transfected with the empty vector, phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 was reduced, and the amount of I\u03baB\u03b1 was stable in nsp1expressing cells as well as in PRRSV nsp1\u03b1-expressing control cells when treated with TNF\u03b1 (Fig. 7D ). This result demonstrates that nsp1 inhibited the I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation. Similar to PRRSV nsp1\u03b1, the densitometric analysis for p-IkB\u03b1 showed the significant inhibition of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation by nsp1 after TNF\u03b1 treatment for 5 min (Fig. 7E ). The level of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation was further decreased by the increasing amount of nsp1 (Fig. 7F) , suggesting that the suppression of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation by nsp1 was dose-dependent. TNF\u03b1 caused the I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation, but no phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 was observed in PEDV-infected cells (Fig. 7G ), which confirmed that nsp1 suppressed I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation. To examine whether nsp1 interferes with IKK activation, nsp1-expressing cells were stimulated with TNF\u03b1, and the IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 phosphorylation was examined. The expression of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 was stable, and the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 normally occurred in nsp1-expressing cells (Fig. 7H ). The inhibition of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and degradation was also observed (Fig. 7H ) and the densitometric analysis also showed this inhibition (Fig. 7I ). This indicates that the inhibition by nsp1 takes place between steps of IKK and I\u03baB\u03b1 in the NF-\u03baB signaling. Together, our data demonstrate that PEDV nsp1 interferes with the I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and degradation, resulting in the inhibition of p65 nuclear translocation.\n\n2.7. The highly conserved residues of nsp1 are crucial for NF-\u03baB suppression Coronavirus nsp1 is the N-terminal cleavage product of the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab and is one of the most divergent proteins among the four different genera in the Coronaviridae family (Ziebuhr, 2005) . Nsp1 proteins of \u03b1-CoV are similar in their lengths and thus may share some functions . Similar to PEDV nsp1, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) nsp1 also inhibits the IFN-\u03b2 production . Thus, we made structural comparisons of PEDV nsp1 and TGEV nsp1. TGEV nsp1 displayed a (A) (B) Fig. 4 . Inhibition of NF-\u03baB-mediated IFN production by PEDV. (A), Inhibition of PRD II promoter by PEDV. MARC-145 cells were co-transfected with the pPRD II-Luc reporter plasmid along with the pRL-TK internal control for 6 h followed by PEDV infection at an MOI of 1 for 12 h. Cells were then stimulated with poly(I:C) for 12 h, and cell lysates were subjected to dual-luciferase reporter assays.

HeLa cells were co-transfected with the pPRD II-Luc reporter along with individual type I IFN antagonist for PEDV followed by stimulation with poly(I:C). Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to luciferase assays. PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 (P-nsp1\u03b1) is known to inhibit the PRD II promoter and was included as a positive control. Its mutant P-nsp1\u03b1(m) (C28S) was included as a negative control (Han et al., 2013; Song et al., 2010) . Results from three independent experiments were presented as the mean relative luciferase values with standard deviation. Asterisks indicate statistical significance calculated by the Student's t-test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.\n\nsix-stranded \u03b2-barrel fold with a long \u03b1-helix on the rim of the barrel (Fig. 8A , left panel; Jansson, 2013) , and PEDV nsp1 showed a similar structure, except two missing \u03b2-sheets (Fig. 8A , right panel), suggesting that PEDV nsp1 may have a unique mechanism for immune modulation. As with TGEV nsp1, the surface of PEDV nsp1 displayed two highly conserved areas. The first area was consisted of four conserved residues D13/E15/N93/N95, and the second area was consisted of three conserved residues L98/E99/E100. These two areas made up two conserved circles placed on a protruding ridge and were potential surfaces for interaction with a partner molecule. Besides, two highly conserved residues (G38/F39) were connected to the hydrophobic core of PEDV nsp1, whereas G87 was highly conserved. We hypothesized that the change of the conserved residues might revert the IFN suppression function of nsp1. To examine this hypothesis, 13 nsp1 mutants were made based on the structural prediction. The mutated genes were individually expressed in cells and examined for their cellular distributions by confocal microscopy. Consistent with the previous report , PEDV nsp1 appeared as a nuclear-cytoplasmic protein (Fig. 8B) . Among the nsp1 mutants, T23A, T68A, K70A, T68A/K70A, and L101A remained nuclear-cytoplasmic. G38A/F39A, F44A, G87A, G87E, L98A/E99A/E100A, and the deletion mutant \u039437-75 exhibited nuclear punctate patterns. N93A/ N95A was perinuclear whereas \u039437-51 became cytoplasmic, suggesting the deletion region was crucial for nuclear localization of nsp1. The results indicated that the highly conserved residues are crucial to maintain the higher order structure of nsp1. To determine the crucial residues for nsp1-mediated IFN suppression, luciferase assays for NF-\u03baB and IFN-\u03b2 were performed for individual mutants. While T23A, T68A, G87A, K70A, T68A/K70A, and L101A still retained the function of NF-\u03baB suppression (Fig. 8C) , G38A/F39A, F44A, G87E, N93A/ N95A, L98A/E99A/E100A, and \u039437-75 lost the NF-\u03baB suppression, indicating that the conserved residues in nsp1 are crucial for NF-\u03baB suppression. The deletion mutant \u039437-51 retained NF-\u03baB inhibition, further confirming that the suppression of NF-\u03baB is a cytoplasmic event. N93A/N95A and L98A/E99A/E100A did not suppress the IFN\u03b2 production (Fig. 8D) , indicating that the conserved residues are also MARC-145 cells were co-transfected with pNF-\u03baB-Luc along with pRL-TK in 12-well plates for 6 h followed by PEDV infection at an MOI of 1 for 12 h.

Results from three independent experiments were presented as the mean relative luciferase values with standard deviation.

HeLa cells were grown in 48-well plates and co-transfected with pNF-\u03baB-Luc along with individual PEDV genes and pRL-TK at a ratio of 10:10:1. For nsp3, nsp5, and nsp16, transfection was conducted as described previously . PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 (P-nsp1\u03b1) is a known NF-\u03baB promoter suppressor, and its mutant P-nsp1\u03b1(m) reverts its suppressive function. Both constructs were included as controls. Cells were stimulated with poly(I:C) (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) at 12 h post-transfection for 12 h and dual luciferase activities were determined. Results from three independent experiments were presented as the mean relative luciferase values with standard deviation.

Unlike the NF-\u03baB suppression, T23A, T68A, T68A/K70A, and G87A lost the IFN suppression function. Additionally, \u039437-51 was cytoplasmic and lost the IFN suppression function, confirming that the IFN suppression by nsp1 is a nuclear event . Our study indicates that the suppression of innate immune responses by PEDV nsp1 relies on its highly conserved residues.\n\nThe innate immune system forms the first line of antiviral defense of a host. It activates the production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines controlled by IRF3/IRF7 and NF-\u03baB. Many viruses have evolved to counteract the host innate immunity for optimal viral adaptation and replication. Studies have shown that PEDV inhibits type I IFN production in virus-infected cells. Of 22 PEDV proteins, ten proteins appear to suppress the IFN production. The nsp1 protein antagonizes the IRF3 signaling by degrading CBP in the nucleus via the proteasome-dependent pathway , and the nsp5 protein antagonizes NF-\u03baB to suppress type I IFN production by cleaving NEMO . The N protein suppresses IRF3 and NF-\u03baB and inhibits IFN-\u03b2 production (Ding et al., 2014) . PEDV infection leads to activation of NF-\u03baB at later times post-infection (Cao et al., 2015b; Xing et al., 2013) . However, the basis for temporal regulation of NF-\u03baB for the production of type I IFNs and proinflam-matory cytokines is unknown. In the present study, we show that PEDV blocks TNF\u03b1-mediated p65 nuclear translocation and have subsequently identified nine NF-\u03baB antagonists. Among these, nsp1 is the most potent NF-\u03baB inhibitor, which blocks the p65 nuclear translocation by inhibiting the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1.\n\nBoth coronaviruses and arteriviruses in the order Nidovirales are sensitive to type I IFNs and modulate the IFN response. Equine arteritis virus (EAV) inhibits type I IFN production in virus-infected equine endothelial cells (Go et al., 2014) . Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is also sensitive to type I IFNs and modulate the IFN production in cells and pigs (Albina et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2004; Overend et al., 2007) . Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) induces extremely low levels of type I IFNs in macrophages, microglia, and oligodendrocytes of infected mice (Li et al., 2010; Roth-Cross et al., 2008; Zhou and Perlman, 2007) . SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV also do not induce type I IFN responses in virus-infected cells (Cinatl et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2014) . TGEV can induce a high level of IFN-\u03b1 in newborn pigs (La Bonnardiere and Laude, 1981) . However, the IFN expression is delayed and the IFN response inhibits TGEV replication in the early stage of infection (Zhu et al., 2017) . Protein 7 and nsp1 of TGEV have been shown to counteract the host antiviral response (Cruz et al., 2013 (Cruz et al., , 2011 . Viruses often code for multiple IFN antagonists, and PEDV also encodes at least 10 IFN antagonists ( . RAW cells were co-transfected with pswTNF\u03b1-Luc and individual viral genes along with pRL-TK for 24 h followed by stimulation with LPS (1 \u03bcg/ml) for 6 h. Firefly luciferase activities were determined and normalized using the Renilla luciferase internal control. PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 (P-nsp1\u03b2) is known to suppress TNF\u03b1 promoter and was included as a control (Subramaniam et al., 2010) . Results from three independent experiments were presented as the mean relative luciferase values. Asterisks indicate statistical significance calculated by the Student's t-test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. (B), Inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines by nsp1. LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with PEDV nsp1 gene for 12 h and stimulated with TNF\u03b1 (15 ng/ml) and for 12 h. Expressions of proinflammatory cytokines were determined by RT-qPCR. Asterisks indicate statistical significance calculated by the Student's t-test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. essential for NF-\u03baB-mediated IFN-\u03b2 production. The p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB specifically functions as a key element for early phase IFN production after infection. The PEDV N protein inhibits NF-\u03baB (Ding et al., 2014) , suggesting that the NF-\u03baB inhibition may lead to the suppression of type I IFNs. In the present study, we have shown that PEDV blocks NF-\u03baB activation and suppresses NF-\u03baB-mediated type I IFN production. Of the ten IFN suppressors, nsp7, nsp16, and M do not interfere with PRD II, suggesting the specific target of IRF3/7. Thus, targeting PRD II via NF-\u03baB and PRD I/III via IRF3/7 results in synergistic effects on the viral IFN antagonism to allow efficient replication of the invading virus. The p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB undergoes various post-translational modifications for activation. Not only for type I IFN induction, but NF-\u03baB is also a key regulator for proinflammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 (Lappas et al., 2002) . Proinflammatory cytokines initiate inflammation and disease progression during viral infection. IL-12 plays a critical role in the early inflammatory response and the generation of Th1 cells leading to cell-mediated immunity (Hsieh et al., 1993) . Activation of NF-\u03baB is critical for host defense and thus occurs rapidly after stimulation without additional protein translation. In turn, NF-\u03baB is an attractive viral target for optimal replication during infection. For SARS-CoV, N protein activates NF-\u03baB (Liao et al., 2005) , whereas M protein suppresses NF-\u03baB probably through a direct interaction with IKK\u03b2 (Fang et al., 2007) . PEDV has also been shown to activate NF-\u03baB later time post-infection (Cao et al., 2015b; Xing et al., 2013) , and the N protein is the NF-\u03baB activator for up-regulation of IL-8 and Bcl-2 (Xu et al., 2013) . The basis for PEDV-mediated NF-\u03baB modulation remains uncharacterized. We show in the present study that PEDV blocks the NF-\u03baB activation and suppresses the production of early proinflammatory cytokines. The PEDV replication cycle is less than 12 h (Sup Fig. 1) , and the inhibition of NF-\u03baB during the early stage of infection may play a role to help viral replication. Nine viral proteins have been identified to regulate NF-\u03baB, and it is of interest to study their individual mode of action for NF-\u03baB.\n\nFor activation of NF-\u03baB, the release of I\u03baB\u03b1 from NF-\u03baB is crucial. In the latent state, NF-\u03baB is sequestered in the cytosol by I\u03baB\u03b1. In response to stimulation by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1, a series of membraneproximal events lead to activation of the IKK complex (IKK\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3). The IKK complex is responsible for the phosphorylation of two serine residues in I\u03baB\u03b1, which in turn leads to Lys48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Proteasomal degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 frees and translocates NF-\u03baB to the nucleus for binding to the \u03baB DNA element in the specific promoters and enhancers of target genes (Napetschnig and Wu, 2013) . Viruses have evolved to develop sophisticated strategies to modulate NF-\u03baB signaling, and ample examples are available. PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 inhibits I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and degradation for suppression of type I IFNs (Song et al., 2010) . Bocavirus NS1 and NS1-70 protein blocks the binding of p65 to the \u03baB DNA element and inhibits TNF\u03b1-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB (Liu et al., 2016) . Molluscum contagiosum poxvirus (MCV) MC160 protein degrades IKK\u03b1 and prevents TNF\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activation (Le Negrate, 2012) . Influenza virus NS1 protein specifically interacts with IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 for inhibition of IKK\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 (Gao et al., 2012) .\n\nPEDV nsp1 inhibits the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and blocks p65 from nuclear translocation. PEDV nsp1 does not interfere the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 complex (Fig. 7H ) nor interact with I\u03baB\u03b1 or IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 (data not shown), suggesting a possible modulation of posttranslational modifications of I\u03baB\u03b1 such as SUMOylation. Unlike ubiquitination and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, SUMOylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 inhibits NF-\u03baB activation (Desterro et al., 1998) . Breast cancer-associated gene 2 (BCA2) functions as an E3 SUMO-ligase and enhances the SUMOylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, leading to improved sequestration of NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing the expression of NF-\u03baB-responsive genes (Colomer-Lluch and Serra-Moreno, 2017). It is of interest to examine whether PEDV nsp1 recruits an E3 SUMO-ligase and enhances SUMOylation of I\u03baB\u03b1.\n\nIn coronaviruses, nsp1 proteins of \u03b1-CoV and \u03b2-CoV are potent IFN antagonists. The \u03b2-CoV nsp1 protein regulates cellular and viral gene expressions. SARS-CoV nsp1 is consisted of 180 amino acids and inhibits the translation of capped cellular mRNAs by blocking the formation of the 80 S complex. It also recruits a cellular endonuclease to induce an endonucleolytic cleavage of host mRNAs . Unlike SARS-CoV nsp1, MERS-CoV nsp1 selectively targets host mRNAs for translation inhibition and mRNA degradation but spares mRNAs of cytoplasmic origin . The \u03b1-CoV nsp1 protein also inhibits the expression of reporter genes. The C-terminal portion of \u03b2-CoV nsp1 is crucial for host mRNA cleavage, and this region is lost in \u03b1-CoV nsp1, suggesting that \u03b1-CoV nsp1 may have evolved a distinct mechanism for immune evasion. Unlike SARS-CoV nsp1, TGEV nsp1 does not bind to the 40 S ribosomal subunit for suppression of host gene expression (Huang et al., 2011) . Surface electrostatics, shapes, and amino acid conservations between \u03b1-CoV nsp1 and \u03b2-CoV nsp1 may contribute to different mechanisms for nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression (Jansson, 2013) . The structure of TGEV nsp1 is characterized by an irregular six-stranded \u03b2-barrel flanked by a \u03b1-helix. Most conserved residues are centered on the highly conserved \u03b27 strand, which is likely involved in its structural stability. Two highly conserved patches on the surface of TGEV nsp1 are placed on a producing ridge formation, which forms potential sites for interaction with cellular proteins (Jansson, 2013) . PEDV nsp1 also shows two highly conserved surface patches, and mutations of these regions alter their cellular distributions and functions for IFN and NF-\u03baB suppressions. It is of interest to identify the cellular proteins that may interact with PEDV nsp1. The PEDV full-length infectious clone is available (Beall et al., 2016; Jengarn et al., 2015) and it will be useful to study nsp1 function in pigs using replicating mutant viruses. Fig. 7 .

LLC-PK1 cells were infected with PEDV at an MOI of 5 and cells were lysed at indicated times, followed by Western blot using anti-I\u03baB\u03b1 and anti-phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 antibodies. Mock-infected cells with the treatment of TNF\u03b1 for 5 min were used as a control. (H), PEDV nsp1 does not interfere phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1/IKK\u03b2. HeLa cells were transfected with PEDV nsp1 gene for 24 h and then stimulated with TNF\u03b1 for indicated times. Cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot using antibodies for p-IKK\u03b1/IKK\u03b2, IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b1, and p-I\u03baB\u03b1. In conclusion, we have shown that PEDV inhibits NF-\u03baB activity and early production of proinflammatory cytokines. PEDV modulates TNF\u03b1-mediated p65 nuclear localization, and we have identified nine viral NF-\u03baB antagonists. PEDV nsp1 interferes the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and blocks NF-\u03baB activation. The conserved residues of nsp1 are crucial for nsp1-mediated NF-\u03baB activity. Our study provides a better understanding for PEDV-mediated innate immune modulation and the basis for PEDV pathogenesis.\n\nTwo different lines of African green monkey kidney cells, MARC-145 (Kim et al., 1993) and Vero (ATCC\u00ae CCL-81\u2122), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Corning\u2122 Cellgro\u2122) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco\u00ae) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 .
