The arguments presented 106 above are qualitative and only superficially identify the scope of the problem. Quantitative understanding 107 ultimately rests on analysis of mathematical models. However, as the models have many interacting processes 108 -minimally innate immunity, adaptive immunity and intrinsic growth differences between vaccine versus inferiority. Yet even if vaccine selective 'neutrality' turns out to be fleeting, merely a mistaken impression 119 from short-term observations, we will find that the phenomenon of short-term stability mirrors a solution to 120 minimize vaccine evolution within the host. infections [26] [27] [28] [29] . The relative role of each mechanism in clearing infections is the basis of ongoing discussion, 145 but it is widely accepted that the roles differ among infections by different viruses and that each mechanism 146 is potentially important for some viruses. Adaptive immunity. 165 Adaptive immunity can be induced by the wild-type vector and the vaccine virus. Adaptive immune responses 166 specific to antigens expressed by the wild-type vector will presumably affect the vaccine and revertant equally 167 -because the vaccine encodes a complete vector genome, and the revertant is also a complete vector. As with 168 the preceding pair of mechanisms, adaptive immunity common to both revertant and vaccine will operate so 169 that revertant abundance will depress vaccine. Adaptive immunity to the vaccine antigen will be considered 170 shortly. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/545087 doi: bioRxiv preprint one mechanism may take precedence over the others, simply because it is activated earlier or enforces a lower 173 limit on viral density than the others. However, there are different stages or degrees of vaccine suppression, 174 so an early mechanism may act to control the infection without clearing it, and another mechanism may 175 act later to clear. Because of the delay in developing an adaptive response, viral suppression by adaptive 176 immunity typically occurs later than effects of innate immunity or resource limitation and so might seem 177 to be unimportant in vaccine evolution. Yet adaptive immunity may be important in clearing the vaccine 178 following control by other mechanisms, in which case it could have an important role in vaccine evolution. The preceding paragraphs omitted adaptive immunity to the antigen. By its very nature, adaptive immunity 182 suppresses vaccine growth. But adaptive immunity to the antigen is specific to the vaccine and is thus 183 another reason -besides intrinsic fitness effects -that the vaccine may have lower fitness than revertant.\n\nThe evolutionary consequences should be the same for both types of inferiority, reducing the long term 185 generation of antigen levels. But the interesting twist is that adaptive immunity to the antigen might feed 186 back negatively on itself to limit its own growth -immunity against a virus is intrinsically inhibitory, so 187 adaptive immunity against the vaccine will limit vaccine growth and thus limit antigen build-up that would 188 fuel further immunity. One question is whether this self-inhibition is worsened with vaccine evolution.\n\nThe effect is biologically complicated because adaptive immunity to the antigen does not necessarily translate 190 into selection against the vaccine. Selection against the vaccine per se operates only when adaptive immunity 191 specifically targets the vaccine genome over the revertant genome, and this selection need not occur -either 192 because adaptive immunity is so delayed that it is never manifest during vaccine growth, or because the 193 antigen is physically decoupled from its genome when attacked by the adaptive response. Without imposing 194 selection on the vaccine, antigen-directed immunity will not affect vaccine evolution. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Given the high 197 dimensionality of the problem, we are especially interested in how well intuition works and whether generalities The models assist us by forcing us to specify assumptions for how the viruses and immunity interact, and 208 by allowing us to rigorously explore outcomes in different scenarios. However, there is uncertainty in the 209 model structure, many parameter values are unknown, and different viruses will behave somewhat differently.\n\nConsequently, we focus on broad generalities that arise from many simulations and illustrate these for a 211 few specific cases, reserving the supplement for further details. The presentation below briefly discusses 212 the individual dynamics of individual trials for illustration but then moves to plots that reveal differences \n\nIn the trials used for illustration, we allow innate immunity to control the infection and adaptive immunity The dynamics of virus and immunity are shown in the absence of revertant (i.e. no evolution). (Right) The revertant is included, but at two different levels. The solid lines correspond to little evolution: the vaccine has a small cost (intrinsic cost =1%, initial level of W is 0.1 that of initial vaccine, and the mutation rate is 10 \u2212 6 per day). The dotted lines correspond to major evolution: the vaccine has a 20% intrinsic cost, the mutation rate is 10 \u22123 , and the initial level of the revertant is 10 fold that of the vaccine.\n\n.

The effect of evolution is 245 We focus on infections of short duration. Factors that limit the duration of infection include resource immunity by allowing revertant to grow and interfere with vaccine. This section considers whether these 252 arguments are supported by the model.\n\nAny real vaccine that elicits immunity against the antigen may also experience an intrinsic fitness cost.\n\nThe effect of immunity on evolution would then be confounded with the effect of intrinsic fitness effects on 255 evolution, making it difficult to isolate one from the other. The models do not face this problem, however. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/545087 doi: bioRxiv preprint from trials that lack revertant and then compare those results with trials that include revertant.\n\nThere are several background points to note about the model structure. First, adaptive immunity specific 261 to vaccine (X) develops at a rate proportional to the vaccine abundance (V ) and parameters s and \u03c6 X .\n\nIn contrast the impairment of vaccine growth depends on the level of immunity (X) and the parameter 263 (k X ). Thus, immunity can develop even when there is little or no impairment, i.e., when k X \u2192 0. Second, 264 adaptive immunity to the vector (Y ) develops according to its own parameter (\u03c6 Y ) in response to vaccine 265 plus revertant abundance (X + Y ), and it impairs both vaccine and revertant growth equally by parameter 266 k Y . When revertant is present, it will increase the level of immunity to vector backbone/revertant but not 267 directly affect immunity specific to the vaccine. This immunity will result in faster clearance of both revertant 268 and vaccine, and this results in decreased immunity to the antigen.\n\nTrials were run that contrasted revertant absence versus revertant introduced at 75% of the inoculum -no 270 evolution versus evolution, respectively (Fig. 5) . Absence of the revertant is the baseline against which the 271 effect of evolution can be compared. The horizontal axis varies k X , the parameter for impairment specific to 272 vaccine, and the vertical axis varies k Y , impairment to vector, which affects vaccine and revertant equally. In 273 both panels, increasing impairment against vaccine leads to lower levels of immunity to the vaccine -this 274 is the self-limiting effect of adaptive immunity, which exists even in the absence of evolution. As expected, 275 impairment of vaccine by immunity to vector is also found. vaccine; inoculum size is unchanged. All loss of immunity against vaccine is thus due to revertant in the 280 inoculum and any selective effect from immunity against vaccine.\n\nA question motivating this analysis was one step deeper in the complexity of these effects: does the self-282 limiting effect of adaptive immunity worsen with evolution? This question can be answered by comparing 283 the self-inhibitory effect between left and right panels as k X is increased. It is seen that the self-inhibitory 284 effect is actually somewhat reduced by the revertant. The revertant lowers the response overall, but when 285 correcting for that difference, the effect of increasing k X is weaker in the right panel than in the left. We 286 attribute this weakening of self-limitation as due to the same effect in Fig. 1 : revertant presence becomes 287 irrelevant as more of the adaptive response to vaccine is controlled by immunity to the vaccine antigen rather than vector -revertant is interfering less.\n\nIn sum, therefore, immunity to the vaccine (X) is reduced by itself and by evolution (presence of revertant).\n\nThe self-limiting effect of anti-vaccine immunity depends heavily on the impairment parameter. The two 291 effects do not interact to make the problem worse than from their separate effects. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/545087 doi: bioRxiv preprint is high). Second, the vaccine should elicit a large response to this antigen. This requires that the antigen 300 rapidly elicits immunity (i.e. has low \u03c6 X , and in terms of immunology it should be an immunogenic antigen), 301 and also requires a high vaccine viral load to generate a large response. Engineering this requires tackling 302 a trade-off between avoiding vaccine clearance (i.e. having a low k X ) but allowing for rapid clearance of 303 the pathogen (having a high k P ). Vaccines designed to express the antigen in a form that is different from 304 that in the pathogen might help solve this problem. Thus, to elicit immunity to influenza, one might design 305 secreted forms of the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase proteins. A recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is 306 secreted rather than on the virion surface would prevent the antibody response to this protein from clearing 307 the recombinant vector vaccine (have low k X ) without compromising the clearance of the influenza virus 308 pathogen which has hemagglutinin on its surface (i.e. has high k P ). In this manner our model allows the 309 identification and tuning of parameters that affect vaccine efficacy, and a comprehensive search of parameter 310 space would identify ideal combinations of vaccine properties. We now turn to vaccine designs that overcome 311 problems created by evolution, our specific interest here. \n\nThe results above suggest that vaccine evolution is only likely to compromise immunity to the antigen if 314 there is substantial evolution and this evolution results in more rapid clearance of the vaccine virus. In this 315 case, one possible solution takes advantage of the short-term nature of vaccine growth: control the inoculum.\n\nTwo ways of controlling the inoculum are to control its composition and to control its size. Evolution can 317 be reduced by purifying the inoculum -an inoculum that is entirely vaccine cannot begin to give way to 318 revertant until some are generated by mutation, hence a low (or zero) density of revertant in the inoculum 319 enhances the duration of within-host vaccine utility. If it not feasible to eliminate the revertant from the 320 inoculum, it can nevertheless be beneficial to lower the frequency of the revertant virus in the inoculum.\n\nThe effect of revertant frequency in the inoculum is evident in Figure 6 : the magnitude of immunity to the 322 vaccine increases by orders of magnitude as the initial frequency of the revertant is decreased.\n\nEvolution can also be reduced by increasing the inoculum size. To achieve a threshold antigen level, a large 324 inoculum requires less growth than a small one. Less growth means less evolution -in the extreme, a large The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/545087 doi: bioRxiv preprint appreciably increases the magnitude of immunity; a much reduced benefit is seen when revertant frequency is 328 low, likely because there is less evolutionary interference from the revertant. These results hint at a potential Composition of the vaccine has the larger effect for these parameters, as indicated by the contours being more horizontal than vertical. An intrinsic fitness cost of c = 0.1 was set for these trials. Smaller c values would lead to higher vaccine and immunity levels across the graphs.\n\nWhether and how well controlling the inoculum will work in practice will depend on details. Solutions may 333 be quantitative rather than absolute. Intuition is useful for guidance but needs to be confirmed by formal 334 analyses, guided by data for the specific implementation. Our results revealed that that for a broad parameter regime, within-host evolution is unlikely to cause 360 a significant loss of vaccine efficacy (i.e. reduction in the level of immunity to the inserted transgene).\n\nFurthermore, undesirable consequences of vaccine evolution may often be easily remedied by ensuring the 362 frequency of the revertant virus in the inoculum is low and by increasing the size of the inoculum. We 363 also suggest that further gains in vaccine efficacy can be achieved by appropriate engineering of the vaccine 364 antigen, allowing it to elicit immunity that clears the pathogen but not the virus vaccine, although such 365 engineering may not be easy.\n\nOne major outcome of our analysis was that intuition about vaccine evolution was not easily translated into 367 18 .

Indeed, even intuition about evolution often failed because that intuition was based 368 on vaccine versus revertant fitness, but the vaccine growth phase was short enough that differential fitness 369 had little effect on evolution. Even more fundamentally, intuition sometimes failed because the development 370 of immunity to vaccine could be unaffected by the revertant. Thus, our intuition suggested that vaccine 371 inferiority could stem from both an intrinsic fitness disadvantage and a disadvantage due to adaptive immunity 372 to the transgene/antigen. Both effects were found to impair the development of immunity to vaccine, but not 373 necessarily for the reasons suggested by our intuition. of whether vaccine evolution would lead to reduced antigen levels in vivo, but it would be less sensitive in 386 measuring evolution than is measuring mutation frequencies.\n\n2.
