{"title": "Physica A Discovery of a missing disease spreader", "body": "In this study, a perturbation theory quantifies how the perturbation which a missing spreader node exerts disturbs the growth of the number of cases. The missing spreader may be the place where the first patient appears (an index node) or not (an intermediate node). Its presence impedes the reproduction of the observed spread by an unperturbed mathematical model. The irreproducibility is rather the clue to solve the problem. Two statistical discriminators are invented. Their role is discriminating between the nodes which are neighboring to the missing spreader node, and the rest (non-neighboring nodes), given a dataset. It is a collection of the time sequence data on the number of cases, or on the cumulative number of new cases, at the nodes within the scope of surveillance in the early growth phase of the spread. The network topology and transmission parameters may be given as an input to the discriminators. Or they may be unknown and must be estimated. The discriminators examine the mid-body or the tail-ends of the probability density function of the number of cases, and search for disturbed time sequence data to which the perturbation gives rise. The mid-body discriminator is founded on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The tail-end discriminator is founded on the Chauvenet rejection test. The discriminators are tested with a number of computationally synthesized datasets, and applied to the WHO datasets on the SARS outbreak and on the flu pandemic (H1N1 swine influenza A) in 2009.\n\nThe mathematical model of the spread in this study is a special case of a stochastic reaction-diffusion process, the integration of a standard epidemiological SIR compartment model and a meta-population network model. The metapopulation network model [20] sub-divides the entire population into distinct sub-populations in many geographical regions. The geographical regions are the nodes n i (i = 0, 1, . . .). The transportation between two regions is a pair of unidirectional links. The adjacency matrix l, whose i-th row and j-th column element is l ij , determines the network topology.\n\nIf a link from n i to n j is present, l ij is 1. If absent, l ij is 0. The parameter \u03b3 is a matrix whose i-th row and j-th column element \u03b3 ij is the probability at which a person moves from n i to n j per a unit time. In many application areas, an empirical law \u03b3 ij = \u0393 ij (l) determines \u03b3 as a function of l. In the following, \u03b3 and l are interchangeable.\n\nIn the SIR compartment model [21] the state of a person changes from a susceptible state, through an infectious state, to a removed (recovered) state. The quantity S i (t) is the number of susceptible persons at a node n i at time t. I i (t) is the number of infectious persons. R i (t) is the number of recovered persons. J i (t) is the cumulative number of new cases until t. The parameter \u03b1 represents the probability at which an infectious person contacts a person and infect the person per a unit time. The parameter \u03b2 represents the probability at which an infectious person recovers per unit time. These transmission parameters do not depend on time and sub-populations. The reproductive ratio r is defined by r = \u03b1/\u03b2 [22] . Movement, infection and recovery are Markovian stochastic processes which are governed by \u03b8 = {\u03b1, \u03b2, l}.\n\nNode discovery is a problem to determine whether the nodes n 0 , n 1 , . . . , n N\u22121 which appear in a given dataset are neighboring a missing spreader node n N or not. The neighboring nodes are those having links to n N . The dataset is either\n\n, where i = 0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1 denotes the nodes, and d = 0, 1, . . . , D \u2212 1 denotes observations. The interval between observations is \u2206t = t d+1 \u2212 t d . ND is the number of data. The network topology and the transmission parameters \u03b8 = {\u03b1, \u03b2, l ij } for i, j = 0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1 are given under some conditions, and unknown under other conditions. No other information is available. The node n N is either present or absent. If present, it is either an index node or an intermediate node. The parameters l iN and l Nj are unknown under any conditions. An empirical law \u03b3 ij = \u0393 ij (l) is postulated in this study. Without the law, when \u03b8 were unknown, the continuous parameter \u03b3 would be estimated, rather than the binary parameter l.\n\nThe time evolution of I i (t), or J i (t) is given by Langevin equations [4] . They are a system of stochastic differential equations [23] . The ensemble of an infinite number of sample trajectories I i (t) is equivalent to the time dependent joint probability density function P(I , t) of the probability variables I = (I 0 , I 1 , . . .). Stochastic differential equations for I i (t) are converted to a partial differential equation for P(I , t). This Fokker-Planck equation [23] is converted to ordinary differential equations to calculate the moments of I i one order after another. The first order moments m i (t|\u03b8) = \ued4e I i P(I , t)dI are the mean of I i at t. The second order moments v ij (t|\u03b8) are the covariance about the mean between I i and I j . The third order moments s ijk (t|\u03b8) are the skewness about the mean among I i , I j , and I k . The fourth order moments \u03ba ijkl (t|\u03b8) are the kurtosis about the mean among I i , I j , I k , and I l . The fifth and higher order moments are not analyzed. The formulae for the moments are listed in Appendix A. The observations I i (t d ) at t d are the initial condition to obtain the moments at t d+1 . In the following, the lower order moments refer to the mean and variance, and the higher order moments refer to the skewness and kurtosis.\n\nFor small \u2206t, s ijk (t d+1 |\u03b8), \u03ba ijkl (t d+1 |\u03b8) \u226a m i (t d+1 |\u03b8), v ij (t d+1 |\u03b8). The probability density function is a multi-variate normal distribution in Eq. (1). The i-th element of the row vector m(t d+1 |\u03b8) is m i (t d+1 |\u03b8). The i-th row and j-th column element of the matrix v(t d+1 |\u03b8) is v ij (t d+1 |\u03b8).\n\n(1) P(I , t) depends on time and many probability variables. Analyzing a dataset is an involved task. Time dependent conditional z-score for I i resolves the involvedness. The variables I i at t d+1 are converted to the variables z i defined by Eq. (2) .\n\nIn Eq. (2), the mean m C i (t d+1 |\u03b8) and the variance v C ii (t d+1 |\u03b8) are conditioned on the observation for the rest of the variables I\u00afi = (I 0 , . . . , I i\u22121 , I i+1 , . . . , I N\u22121 ) at t d+1 . Generally, given I\u00afi, the conditional probability density function for I i is a uni-variate normal distribution P N (\n\nis given by Eq. (3). It is a sum of the unconditional mean m i and a term dependent on the difference between the observation and the expected value (I \u2212 m) for the rest of the variables at t d+1 . The column vector (I \u2212 m) T is a transpose of a row vector\n\nThe conditional variance v C ii (t d+1 |\u03b8) is a Shur compliment of v\u00afi\u00afi in v. It is given by Eq. (4) . Because the observation reduces uncertainty, v C ii is smaller than v ii by the amount determined by the second term.\n\nIn Eqs. (3) and (4), the unconditional mean is partitioned into the i-th element and a row vector. The unconditional covariance is partitioned into four sub-matrices\n\n. These are given by Eq. (5).\n\nThe non-uniform growth at different nodes at different times is absent in z i . Eq. (1) becomes Eq. (6), which is valid for all nodes n i at any time t as far as the approximation that I obeys a multi-variate normal distribution holds true.\n\nIn the above discussion, it is assumed that \u03b8 is known and I i (t d ) is given as a dataset. If \u03b8 is unknown, the network topology and transmission parameters must be estimated from a given dataset. A well-known statistical technique for this purpose is the maximal likelihood estimation or the maximal a posteriori probability estimation [24] . The true parameter \u03b8 is substituted by the estimator\u03b8. If \u2206J i (t d ) is given, instead of I i (t d ), \u2206J i (t d ) is converted to I i (t d ) by Eq. (7) . All the formulae for I i (t d ) are applicable then.\n\nEq. (7) is a discrete-time approximation to the stochastic differential equation. The fluctuation terms are simply discarded. The motivation to use Eq. (7) is as follows. The model in this study is a hidden Markovian model in the sense that the observation \u2206J i (t d ) is determined by the unobserved states of variables I i (t) in a Markovian stochastic process. It is generally intractable to estimate the model with many continuous-time dependent (so-called heteroskedastic) continuous latent variables. Such an approximation as Eq. (7) is critical in the estimation. If the true value \u03b1 in Eq. (7) is unknown, it is substituted by the estimator\u03b1. The mathematical details for these estimation and conversion are presented in Ref. [13] .\n\nA perturbation theory quantifies the impact of a missing spreader node on its neighboring nodes and non-neighboring nodes. Let us investigate a simple network which consists of a missing spreader node n s , a neighboring node n n which is connected to n s , and a non-neighboring node n a which stays apart from n s . That is, N = 2 and n 2 = n s . The three nodes are connected with two links between n n and n a , and n n and n s . Assume that \u03b3 na = \u03b3 an = \u03b3 , \u03b3 ns = \u03b3 sn = \u03b3 \u2032 , and \u03b3 as = \u03b3 sa = 0. The presence of n s means \u03b3 \u2032 > 0. Given \u03b8 = {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 }, how does non-zero \u03b3 \u2032 disturb the moments of I n and I a ?\n\nThe formulae for the moments in this network are listed in Appendix B. The mean for n n changes in the direction determined by the sign of I n (t d ) \u2212 I s (t d ). The variance increases in proportion to \u03b3 \u2032 . The terms dependent on O(\u03b3 \u20322 ) appear in the formulae for the skewness and kurtosis. The mean and variance of the z-score for n n are given by Eqs. (8) and (9) .\n\nThe quantity \u27e8z\u27e9 is the average of z over the observations at different times. In Eq. (2), the disturbance is included in the observation I i whose moments are m i (t d+1 |\u03b8, \u03b3 \u2032 ) and v ii (t d+1 |\u03b8, \u03b3 \u2032 ). On the other hand, nothing can be assumed about the presence of n s in calculating m C i and v C ii . These are the values predicted from m i (t d+1 |\u03b8, 0) and v ii (t d+1 |\u03b8, 0) when \u03b3 \u2032 = 0, given \u03b8 = {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 }.\n\n\u221a \u2206t. (8) \u27e8(z n \u2212 \u27e8z n \u27e9) 2 \u27e9 = 1 + \u03b3 \u2032 (I n + I s ) (\u03b1 + \u03b2)I n + \u03b3 (I n + I a ) . (9) As \u03b3 \u2032 increases, the difference between the probability density function of z n and the standardized normal distribution becomes more significant. In contrast, the mean, variance, and skewness for n a do not change at all. In terms of the z-score for n a , \u27e8z a \u27e9 = 0 and \u27e8(z a \u2212 \u27e8z a \u27e9) 2 \u27e9 = 1. Interestingly, the kurtosis increases in proportion to \u03b3 \u2032 . The presence of n s disturbs the fourth and higher order moments for n a . The coupling with a spreader and non-neighboring nodes emerges at this order.\n\nBut such a signal from non-zero \u03b3 \u2032 may be too weak to detect from n a . The above discussion implies that the normality of the probability density function for neighboring nodes is vulnerable to the perturbation which a missing spreader node exerts, but that the impact on the normality for non-neighboring nodes is not salient. This is the basis to discriminate between the neighboring nodes and non-neighboring nodes statistically. Let us extend the theory to multiple non-neighboring nodes. The entire set of non-neighboring nodes is treated as a big node n a . The number of infectious persons at the individual nodes is roughly the same as I n . Assume there are k such nodes. I a \u2248 kI n holds. If n s is an index node, I s \u226b I n holds. The variance of z n in Eq. (9) is sufficiently large as a signal when k < \u03b3 \u2032 I s /\u03b3 I n . Any k satisfies this criterion unless \u03b3 \u2032 is extremely small. If n s is an intermediate node, I s \u2248 I n holds. The variance is large enough when k < (2\u03b3 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)/\u03b3 . A small k, rather than a small N, seems a prerequisite for discrimination. When a household or a hospital ward form a sub-population, the population of a node is very small. Most of the subpopulation are likely to get infected immediately at the onset of infection. The day-by-day fluctuating growth of the number of patients, in which the trace of perturbation is left, will not be observed. The formulae in this study may not work under this condition. Moreover as an extreme, a social network model, where an individual is a node, is suitable to analyze the transmission of such diseases as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) [25] . Formulating a stochastic model and perturbation theory for the social network model is beyond the scope of this study.\n\nThe mid-body discriminator is founded on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [26] estimates the minimal distance between two cumulative density functions. In many applications, the test is used for a one-sample hypothesis testing where the null hypothesis is that the cumulative density function drawn from a dataset empirically is the same as a given reference cumulative density function. A typical reference function is a cumulative normal distribution with a given mean and variance. The test is more sensitive to the difference in the mid-bodies of the cumulative density functions than that in the tail-ends. In other words, it is more sensitive to the difference in the lower order moments. Let z(d) denote multiple observations (d = 0, 1, . . . , D \u2212 1) for a single probability variable z. The empirical cumulative density function F (z) is given by Eq. (10) . The function H(x) for a real argument x is a Heaviside function whose value is 1 when x > 0, and 0 when x < 0.\n\nThe test statistic T is given by Eq. (11) . F R (z) is the reference cumulative density function which z obeys in the hypothesis. This is the minimal distance between the cumulative density functions. The supremum sup x for a real variable x is the least upper bound of x.\n\nThe null hypothesis is rejected at the significance level of a when T > K a where K a = K \u22121 (1 \u2212 a). K (x) is a cumulative density function of the Kolmogorov distribution for a probability variable x > 0. K a = 1.38 for a = 5%, and K a = 1.63 for a = 1%. Eq. (10) is applicable to calculating the empirical cumulative density function F i (z) of the z-score for n i in Eq.\n\n(2) from the observation of I i at t = t d (d = 0, 1, . . . , D \u2212 1). Because of the property in Eq. (6), the reference cumulative density function is the cumulative standard normal distribution F R (z) = (1 + erf(z/ \u221a 2))/2. The test statistic T in Eq. (11) for n i becomes T i in Eq. (12) .\n\nIt is not obvious which value of the threshold K a is the most suitable because the normality for non-neighboring nodes and non-normality for neighboring nodes are just an approximation. On the other hand, it is difficult to derive an analytical formula for an appropriate discrimination threshold as a function of the parameters and experimental conditions. Searching for the threshold T * experimentally is rather practical. If T i > T * , the mid-body discriminator determines that the perturbation from an unknown origin disturbs I i , and consequently that n i neighbors a missing spreader node.\n\nThe tail-end discriminator is founded on the Chauvenet rejection test. The Chauvenet rejection test [27] detects an outlier in a given dataset. It was invented as a criterion to assess statistically whether particular one-dimensional numerical data are likely to be spurious or not, and is used widely in experimental physics and chemistry today. First, the mean and variance of a given dataset are calculated. The probability at which the individual datum is obtained under the calculated mean and variance is evaluated. Then, the datum is considered to be an outlier if the product of the probability and the number of data in the dataset is less than a given threshold. The threshold is 0.5 in the conventional Chauvenet rejection test. For example, the data are spurious if the probability is less than 0.05 when the number of data is 10.\n\nThe test statistic L is the likelihood function [24] , which is the conditional probability of the data as a function of the parameters. The conditional probability will be noticeably small if the data are spurious, that is, the data lies in the tailends. The test is sensitive to the anomaly in the higher order moments. The test statistic L i of the z-score for n i is defined by Eq. (13) .\n\nAccording to the conventional Chauvenet rejection test, the discrimination threshold for the test statistic is C = ln 0.05 = \u22123 when N = 10. Recall the discussion on the significance of the absolute value of K a for the mid-body discriminator.\n\nInstead of relying on C in the conventional Chauvenet rejection test, searching for an appropriate discrimination threshold L * experimentally is rather appropriate. If L i < L * , the tail-end discriminator determines that a node n i is a neighboring node.\n\nThe performance of the discriminators is studied with a number of computationally synthesized test datasets. The test datasets are synthesized by numerical integration [28] of the Langevin equations for random network topologies and transmission parameters. The network is a Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi model. The probability at which a link is present between n i and n j (l ij = l ji = 1) is a constant \u27e8k i \u27e9/(N \u2212 1). The nodal degree of a node n i is given by k i = \u2211 j l ij . The average over the all nodes\n\nIt is postulated that the total number of persons who move from n i to n j per a unit time is proportional to\n\npresent. This is valid generally for the world-wide airline transportation network [29] . Eq. (14) determines \u03b3 ij as a function of l. The fraction of persons outgoing per a unit time is a constant \u03b3 over the network.\n\nIt is also postulated that the initial population P i (0) = S i (0) + I i (0) + R i (0) of a node n i is proportional to the total number of persons outgoing from the node per unit time [13] . P i (0) is given by Eq. (15) . The total population is P = 10 6 N in the experiment. This is relevant in synthesizing the test datasets, but not necessary in discrimination.\n\nA receiver operating characteristic curve [30] is drawn to evaluate the accuracy of discrimination. In signal processing, a receiver operating characteristic curve is a plot of the true positive ratio R TP on the vertical axis and the false positive ratio R FP on the horizontal axis for a binary discriminator as its discrimination threshold is varied. It is generally a concave function. The discrimination threshold is T * for the mid-body discriminator, and L * for the tail-end discriminator. There are four possible outcomes from the discriminator. They are summarized in Table 1 . True positive and true negative are right answers, but false positive and false negative are wrong answers. The number of the true positive is N TP . The number of nodes is N = N TP + N FN + N FP + N TN . The ratios are defined by Eq. (16) . R TP is called recall alternatively, and R FP is called fallout.\n\nThe ratios take the value between 0 and 1. If the discriminator works ideally excellently, N TP = k N , N FN = 0, N FP = 0, and N TN = N \u2212 k N . The curve for the ideal discriminator degenerates to the upper left corner (R FP , R TP ) = (0, 1). The curve for a random discriminator is a straight line R TP = R FP between (0, 0) and (1, 1) . The curve for a more excellent discriminator comes closer to the upper left corner. The closeness of R TP \u2212 R FP to its ideal value of 1 is a scalar indicator of accuracy. It is used as an objective function to search for the optimal thresholds L * and T * experimentally. Fig. 1a, b shows the receiver operating characteristic curves for N = 10 when the missing spreader node n 10 is an index node. The tail-end discriminator works excellently both when \u03b8 is given and unknown. The best performance is R TP \u2212R FP \u2248 1. The mid-body discriminator is the most suitable when \u03b8 is given. The best performance is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 1 for given \u03b8, and \u2248 0.2 for unknown \u03b8. Fig. 1c , d shows the curves for N = 30 when the missing spreader node n 30 is an index node. Fig. 1e , f shows the curves for N = 10 when the missing spreader node n 10 is an intermediate node. Discrimination is not as excellent as that in a, b, but excellent moderately. The best performance of the tail-end discriminator is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 0.9 for a given \u03b8, and \u2248 0.7 for an unknown \u03b8. The best performance of the mid-body discriminator is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 0.65 for a given \u03b8.\n\nThe intermediate node and its neighboring nodes look alike as sinks of infected travelers indistinguishably. This is in strong contrast to the index node which is a salient source of them.\n\nWhen \u03b8 is unknown, the estimation searches for a network topology of N nodes and transmission parameters, whose behavior bears the closest resemblance to I 0 , I 1 , . . . , I N\u22121 in the actual network topology of N + 1 nodes. In the simple network in 3.2, this results in m i (t d+1 |\u03b8, 0) \u223c m i (t d+1 |\u03b8, \u03b3 \u2032 ) and v ij (t d+1 |\u03b8, 0) \u223c v ij (t d+1 |\u03b8, \u03b3 \u2032 ), consequently \u27e8z n \u27e9 \u223c 0 and \u27e8(z n \u2212\u27e8z n \u27e9) 2 \u27e9 \u223c 1, rather than Eqs. (8) and (9). This is confirmed by measuring the moments with the datasets. The measured moments are shown in Appendix C. When a missing spreader node is absent, the moments for given \u03b8 are almost the same as those for the estimator\u03b8. And the moments are \u27e8m i \u27e9 \u2248 0 and \u27e8v ii \u27e9 = 1. The estimator reproduces the spread accurately. On the other hand, the difference in every moment between neighboring nodes and non-neighboring nodes for the estimator\u03b8 is much smaller than that for a given \u03b8 when the missing spreader node is an index node. The difference in \u27e8m i \u27e9, and that in \u27e8v ii \u27e9 are so small that n n can not be distinguished from n a by examining the lower order moments. This is the reason why the mid-body discriminator is not suitable if \u03b8 is unknown. Furthermore, the difference in every moment between neighboring nodes and non-neighboring nodes is particularly small when the missing spreader node is an intermediate node. Discovery of a missing intermediate node is a hard problem. Fig. 2a, b shows the curves when the number of data is D = 33. Accuracy is the same as that in Fig. 1a ,b. It does not depend on these experimental conditions. Fig. 2c , d shows the curves when the reproductive ratio is r = 8, which is four times larger than the value in Fig. 1a, b . The best performance of the tail-end discriminator is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 0.95 for a given \u03b8, and \u2248 0.85 for an unknown \u03b8. The best performance of the mid-body discriminator is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 0.95 for a given \u03b8.\n\nThere is a small degradation in accuracy, but discrimination is still excellent. Fig. 2e ,f shows the curves when the fraction is \u03b3 = 0.4, which is four times larger than the value in Fig. 1a, b. The accuracy is the same as that in Fig. 1a, b.  Fig. 3a , b shows the curves when \u2206J i (t d ), instead of I i (t d ), is given as a dataset. The missing spreader node n 10 is an index node. The experimental conditions are the same as those in Fig. 1a , b. These two spreads are identical. Discrimination from \u2206J i (t d ) is not so excellent as that from I i (t d ) in Fig. 1a , b. The best performance of the tail-end discriminator is R TP \u2212R FP \u2248 0.55 for a given \u03b8, and \u2248 0.85 for an unknown \u03b8. The best performance of the mid-body discriminator is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 0.65 for a given \u03b8. Fig. 3c , d shows the curves under the condition where the missing spreader node n 10 is an intermediate node. The best performance of the tail-end discriminator is R TP \u2212R FP \u2248 0.4 both for given and unknown \u03b8. The best performance of the mid-body discriminator is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 0.6 for a given \u03b8. The performance of the mid-body discriminator does not change much between a, b and c, d. Somehow these tendencies are contrary to the results so far. Recall that the fluctuation term in the stochastic differential equations is discarded in the approximation of Eq. (7). The term is more complex than a mere Gaussian white noise because its amplitude includes \u221a I i (t), and the ensemble of sample trajectories I i (t) does not obey a multi-variate normal distribution in Eq. (1) for large t. Eq. (7) is correct on the average, but the conversion of the higher order moments from \u2206J i (t d ) to I i (t d )\n\nis inaccurately distortive. It is the reason why the tail-end discriminator is only moderately excellent, and the shape of the curve looks awkward when \u03b8 is given. On the other hand, when \u03b8 is unknown, the estimator\u03b8 may be able to make up for the distortion in the higher order moments. The tail-end discriminator with the estimator\u03b8 outperforms the discriminators for a given \u03b8. Even if the true parameters are given, adjusting the parameters is rather indispensable for excellent discrimination from \u2206J i (t d ). Substantial improvement of Eq. (7) is beyond the scope of this study and is for a future challenge. Fig. 4a , b shows R TP \u2212 R FP as a function of the discrimination threshold L * or T * when \u03b8 is given. The rising edges of the three curves coincide with each other. L * = \u22123 to \u22123.5, and T * = 1.5 to 2 are reasonable if there is no prior information on the presence or absence of a missing spreader node. If the assumption is grounded well that an index node is missing, there is a distinct optimal threshold L * = \u22124, and T * = 2.1. Fig. 4c , d shows R TP \u2212 R FP when \u03b8 is unknown. Setting L * = \u22123 to \u22123.5 is reasonable. The position of the falling edges of the curves in c, d are different from that in a, b. There is a distinct optimal threshold L * = \u22123.4 for a missing index node. Fig. 5a , b shows the optimal thresholds L * and T * as a function of the transmission parameters r (\u03b1 and \u03b2) and \u03b3 . Fig. 5c , d shows the optimal thresholds L * and T * as a function of the number of nodes N. The optimal thresholds depend on r. This means that it is practical to find the optimal threshold experimentally, which is suitable for individual conditions. The dependence on \u03b3 and N is so small that the dependence can be ignored.\n\nSARS is a respiratory disease in humans caused by the SARS corona-virus. The epidemic of SARS appears to have started in Guangdong of south China in November 2002. SARS spread from Guangdong to Hong Kong in early 2003 [22] , and eventually conditions are the same as those in Fig. 1a, b , e, f.\n\nnearly 40 countries around the world by July [31] . WHO archives the cumulative number of reported probable cases of SARS. 1 The dataset in the archive had been updated every day. It is a collection of time sequence data J i (t d ) with \u2206t = 1 day.\n\nThe target geographical regions in this study are those where five or more cases had been reported in a month since March [11] . The window size here is W = 3 (\u2248 0.1D). It is postulated that the empirical law in Eq. (14) holds true. Table 2 shows the calculated test statistic L i for the mid-body discriminator, T i for the tail-end discriminator, and the mean m i , variance v ii , skewness s iii , and kurtosis \u03ba iiii of z i for the 11 regions. The lower order moments averaged over the all regions are \u27e8m i \u27e9 = \u22121.0 and \u27e8v ii \u27e9 = 3.2. The entire dataset is disturbed. The lower order moments tend to be anomalous for the United States, Canada, Singapore, and Taiwan, while the higher order moments are anomalously large for Malaysia and Vietnam. The estimated values of the parameters are\u03b1 = 0.18,\u03b2 = 0.13 (r = 1.4), and\u03b3 = 0.13. The optimal threshold L * = \u22123.6 is obtained in the experiment for this condition. Perturbation is discovered in the time sequence data for Hong Kong, the United States, Canada, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The data for Hong Kong is disturbed extremely strongly. The variance and kurtosis are anomalous particularly.\n\nRecall that Mainland China is not included in the dataset. The actual cumulative number of cases in Guangdong alone exceeded that in Hong Kong in the period. Guangdong was a spreader which had not been known to the rest of the world in the early growth phase. This is illustrated by an example of the uncovered chains of transmission. Two of the index patients in Toronto in Canada and another three of the index patients in the United States stayed at a hotel in Hong Kong, where a Chinese nephrologist, who had treated many patients in Guangzhou in Guangdong and became infected, was staying in late February. 2 This implies that China was influential potentially in infecting Hong Kong, the United States, and Canada. The large amount of passenger traffic between south China and Southeast Asian countries is supposed to affect the spread in these countries. On the other hand, the disturbance is not evident in the data for European countries. It is highly probable that the discovered signal of perturbation originates in the transmission between China, a missing spreader node, and north Pacific Rim countries.\n\nThe Fig. 1a , b.\n\nTest statistic L for the mid-body discriminator, T for the tail-end discriminator, and the mean m i , variance v ii , skewness s iii , and kurtosis \u03ba iiii of z i for the 11 regions where a local outbreak is reported in the early growth phase of the SARS outbreak. then to the South American countries, West European countries, and Pacific Rim countries. It began to decline in November. WHO archives the cumulative number of the reported laboratory-confirmed cases of the flu pandemic. 3 The dataset in the archive had been updated every day. It is a collection of time sequence data J i (t d ) with \u2206t = 1 day. Table 3 shows the calculated test statistics, the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of z i for the 22 regions. The lower order moments averaged over the all regions are \u27e8m i \u27e9 = \u22120.11 and \u27e8v ii \u27e9 = 1.3. The entire dataset is not disturbed. The lower order moments tend to be anomalous for the United States and Mexico, while the higher order moments are anomalously large for Canada. Irregularly, Japan has large absolute values of both lower and higher order moments. The higher order moments for South American countries tend to be large while those for West European countries are small. This may be related to the seasonality for the tropics and the northern hemisphere. The estimated values of the parameters are\u03b1 = 0.88, \u03b2 = 0.77 (r = 1.2), and\u03b3 = 0.29. The optimal threshold L * = \u22124.2 is obtained in the experiment for this condition.\n\nPerturbation is discovered in the time sequence data for the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Japan. The ratio of this number is 4/N = 0.18, which is remarkably smaller than 7/N = 0.64 for the SARS outbreak. In addition, the absolute value of L is much less anomalous than that for the SARS outbreak. In most regions, L is close to 0 while L is less than \u22122 for the SARS outbreak. The disturbance from an unknown origin of perturbation is small and localized. Then, what happened to the spread in the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Japan?\n\nThe national transportation statistics of the United States 4 reports that most passengers cross the borders between the United States and Mexico, and the United States and Canada by land. The annual number of passengers from Mexico to the United States by land is 24 times larger than that by air in 2009. The number from Canada to the United States by land is 7 times larger than that by air in 2005. The meta-population network model relies on Eq. (14) which is known to be valid for the world-wide air transportation. The actual heavy land transportation lets the probability of movement across the border deviate from the value estimated in the model. This is supported by the result that the fraction\u03b3 is twice as large as that for the SARS outbreak. The deviation imposes an impact on the speed of the spread at such cities near the border as San Ysidro CA, then inland cities, and finally such cities near another border as Buffalo-Niagara Falls NY [32] . The discovered signal of perturbation for the United States, Mexico, and Canada could originate in a localized exception to the empirical law for the probability of movement, rather than a missing spreader node.\n\nThe onset of infection in Japan started suddenly on May 9 after many travelers had returned from North America during Japan's two week long festive break. Flu spread explosively among high school students in Osaka and Hyogo. The effective reproductive ratio reached the peak value around May 14 [33] . The ratio is significantly higher than 1.4 to 1.6 from an epidemiological analysis, or 1.2 from a genetic analysis, in Mexico and other countries [34] . School closure started on May 17 just after the secondary transmission had been confirmed and announced officially. The effective reproductive ratio declined below 1. The reproductive ratio in Japan rose and fell sharply in 10 days in early May. The precondition of the SIR compartment model is that the values of the transmission parameters do not depend on time and sub-populations. The discovered signal of perturbation for Japan could originate in an accidental localized anomaly on the probability of infection, rather than a missing spreader node.\n\nThe above results demonstrate the potential capability of the discriminator in discovering unknown origins of perturbation which violate the preconditions of the mathematical models. On the other hand, the signal discovered by the discriminators satisfies the sufficient condition to ascertain the presence of a missing spreader node incompletely, although it satisfies the necessary conditions. Prior knowledge on the demographic and socioeconomic nature of individual regions makes up for the incompleteness. This is similar to the false positives where the signal identified an early warning for a catastrophe originates in wide classes of impending transitions because the underlying mechanism is understood incompletely [35] . It is also of interest to see if the discovered location of a missing node satisfies the criterion for a strongly influential spreader in the core of the network [36] . Is it possible to distinguish the presence of a missing spreader node from an anomaly on the parameters mathematically? The solution will be worked out by examining how possible origins of perturbation appear in respective order moments of the disturbed time sequence data, and by finding a suitable backward mapping from the pattern of disturbance to the possible origins. The criterion for discrimination may be a complex function of the preconditions of a mathematical model, experimental conditions, and given datasets, rather than a simple scalar threshold of a test statistic in this study. These issues are for future challenges.\n\nThis study poses an intriguing problem which few studies have addressed before. The problem is a node discovery problem for the spread of an infectious disease. Two statistical discriminators are invented to solve the problem.\n\nThe performance of the discriminators is studied with computationally synthesized datasets. The findings are as follows. The tail-end discriminator is excellent both when the parameters are given and unknown. The mid-body discriminator is the most suitable when the parameters are given. Discovery of a missing intermediate node is more difficult than a missing index node, but possible. The performance depends neither on the speed of the spread, on the size of the network, nor on the number of data much. If the cumulative number of new cases is given as a dataset, discrimination is moderately excellent, and interestingly, the tail-end discriminator works more excellently when the parameters are unknown than when they are given. The optimal thresholds for discrimination depend solely on the reproductive ratio (the probability of infection and recovery).\n\nThe WHO dataset on the SARS outbreak and flu pandemic are analyzed with the discriminators. The findings are as follows. The entire dataset on the SARS outbreak is disturbed. The signal of perturbation from an unknown origin is discovered in the time sequence data for Hong Kong, the United States, Canada, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The data for Hong Kong is disturbed extremely strongly. It is highly probable that the discovered signal originates in the transmission between China, a missing spreader node, and north Pacific Rim countries. In the flu pandemic, the signal of perturbation is discovered in the time sequence data for the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Japan. The ratio of the number of these regions is much smaller than that for the SARS outbreak. The test statistics are much less anomalous than those for the SARS outbreak. The disturbance in the dataset is small and localized. The signal for the United States, Mexico, and Canada could originate in the heavy land transportation which is an exception to the empirical law for the probability of movement. The signal for Japan could originate in an accidentally sharp rise and fall of the probability of infection.\n\nTwo advanced problems still remain unsolved. One is raising the accuracy of discrimination from the cumulative number of new cases as well as from the number of cases. The other is deriving the criteria to distinguish the presence of a missing spreader node from an anomaly on the parameters. Solving them is a milestone to the theory on the stochastic reaction-diffusion process where hidden external or internal entities are at work. These issues are for future challenges.\n\nThe time evolution of I i (t) is given by the Langevin equations in Eq. (17) . The fluctuation terms \u03be [\u03b3 ] (t), \u03be [\u03b1] (t), and \u03be [\u03b2] (t) are Gaussian white noises. Their explicit functional forms are unknown. The equations are applicable to any nodes including missing nodes.\n\nIn most cases, the outbreak is contained before the spread reaches equilibrium. In the early growth phase of the outbreak, I i \u226a S i and R i \u226a S i hold true. Eq. (17) becomes Eq. (18) [13] .\n\nThe time evolution of J i (t) is given by Eq. (19) .\n\nEq. (17) is equivalent to the Fokker-Planck equation in Eq. (20) .\n\nThe coefficients a ip and b ijp in Eq. (20) are given by Eqs. (21) and (22).\n\nThe moments satisfy Eq. (23) through (26) . The explicit functional forms of lower order moments are necessary to obtain higher order moments. \n\nds ijk (t|\u03b8) dt = \u2212 p (a ip s pjk (t|\u03b8) + a jp s pik (t|\u03b8) + a kp s pij (t|\u03b8)) + \u2212 p (b ijp v pk (t|\u03b8) + b ikp v pj (t|\u03b8) + b jkp v pi (t|\u03b8)).
