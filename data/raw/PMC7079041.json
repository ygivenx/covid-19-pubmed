{"title": "Two\u2010pore channels regulate Tat endolysosome escape and Tat\u2010mediated HIV\u20101 LTR transactivation", "body": "Infecting 36.9 million people globally, HIV\u20101 virus can enter the brain early after infection1, 2 and it can harbor in CSF, perivascular macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes.3 Although combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively suppresses HIV\u20101 replication, it does not eliminate the virus. Resting memory CD4+ T cells in the blood are the best characterized cellular HIV\u20101 reservoirs.4 However, there are other sites of HIV persistence in the body. The brain is unique in terms of its \u201cimmune privileged\u201d status and evidence does suggest that the brain is a viral reservoir for HIV\u20101.5, 6 In brain, macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes can be infected by HIV\u20101; HIV\u20101 infection of macrophages and microglia is more productive than astrocytes.7 Although endocytosis is involved in HIV\u20101 entry in both macrophages7, 8 and astrocytes,7 different receptors are used for HIV\u20101 entry in macrophages or astrocytes and this could help explain the restrictive nature of HIV\u20101 infection in astrocytes. It has been reported that up to 19% astrocytes carry HIV\u20101 DNA in HIV\u20101 infected brain9, 10 and because of their abundance, astrocytes could be an important viral reservoir in the brain.\n\nThe existence of HIV\u20101 reservoirs in peripheral cells and brain cells5, 6 and the persistence of chronic low levels of neuroinflammation might be responsible for the 30%\u201050% prevalence rates of HIV\u2010associated neurocognitive disorders in this ART era.11, 12 The existence of such viral reservoirs that act as sanctuaries for HIV\u20101 has made the complete eradication of HIV\u20101 extremely challenging.10, 13, 14 Therefore, additional potential strategies are needed to block viral reactivation to maintain HIV\u20101 in a state of prolonged silencing and to prevent disease progression and the development of HIV\u2010induced CNS dysfunction.\n\nThe HIV\u20101 viral protein Tat represents an attractive target for the eradication of HIV\u20101 because Tat is essential for viral transcription15, 16, 17 and because current ART does not block the secretion of Tat in HIV\u20101 infected individuals.18, 19 Further, brain levels of Tat remain elevated even though HIV\u20101 virus is below detectable levels.19 Actively secreted from HIV\u20101 infected cells,20, 21, 22, 23 Tat can bind to cell surface receptors including LRP1, heparin sulfate proteoglycan, CD26, and CXCR4, and enters cells via receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis.24, 25, 26, 27 The arginine\u2010rich basic domain of Tat48\u201060 is responsible for cellular entry,28, 29, 30, 31 and, as such, Tat48\u201060 is widely used for transporting a variety of macromolecules into cells.32, 33 In brain, secreted Tat is taken up rapidly by CNS cells via endocytosis by interacting with specific cell surface proteins and receptors.24, 25, 26, 27, 34, 35 Following its endocytosis and internalization into endolysosomes, Tat must undergo endolysosome escape into the cytosol, where it can transit to the nucleus and activate the HIV\u20101 LTR promoter.36, 37, 38 However, it is not clear how Tat escapes endolysosomes.\n\nOthers and we have shown that exogenous Tat leads to calcium dyshomeostasis in neuronal and non\u2010neuronal cells.39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 Accordingly, we investigated the involvement of calcium in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation using split\u2010GFP Tat endolysosome escape and Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation assays. We demonstrated blocking endolysosome\u2010resident two\u2010pore channels (TPCs) attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation.\n\nU87MG glioblastoma cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). U87MG cells were stably transfected with luciferase reporter gene under the control of HIV\u20101 LTR promoter following neomycin (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) selection pressure. These cells were provided generously by Dr Lena Al\u2010Harthi (Rush University, Chicago). H1299 cells with stable GFP\u03b21\u201010 expression under hygromycin selection were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen).\n\nU87MG cells with luciferase reporter gene under the control of HIV\u20101 LTR promoter were incubated with 2 \u03bcg/ml HIV\u20101 Tat (ABL Inc and NIH AIDS program) in the presence of 100 \u03bcM chloroquine. Forty\u2010eight hours post\u2010incubation, luciferase activity assays (Promega) were performed and relative luminescence units were quantified using a fluorometer/luminometer plate reader (Spectra MAX GEMINI EM).\n\nH1299 cells with stable GFP\u03b21\u201010 expression under hygromycin selection were treated with various concentrations of GFP\u03b211\u2010Tat for up to 4 hours with GFP\u03b211 plus Tat as controls. GFP fluorescence was analyzed with flow cytometry (Attune NxT). The peptide sequences were as follows; GFP\u03b211\u2010Tat RDHMVLHEYVNAAGITGRKKRRQRRRPPQ, GFP\u03b211 RDHMVLHEYVNAAGIT, and Tat GRKKRRQRRRPPQ.\n\nQuantitative analysis of Tat internalization in H1299 cells was performed using a method as described previously,46 but with minor modifications. Cells plated on glass\u2010bottom 35\u2010mm2 tissue culture dishes were treated with 5 \u03bcg/mL Tat\u2010FITC (ImmunoDX, 1002\u2010F) for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C. Following treatment, 100 \u03bcL of cell media was used to determine the remaining levels of Tat\u2010FITC and relative fluorescence intensity was quantified using a fluorometer plate reader (Spectra MAX GEMINI EM). Cells were washed with an acid wash solution (0.2 M acetic acid, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 2.8) at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes and then washed with ice\u2010cold PBS for 5 minutes to remove surface\u2010bound Tat\u2010FITC. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and images were taken with a confocal laser\u2010scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM800). The average integrated intensity of the Tat\u2010FITC signal per cell was quantified using ImageJ software.\n\nCells were stably transfected with TPC1 and TPC2 targeted shRNA (Santa Cruz) and scrambeled control shRNA following puromycin (Invitrogen) antibiotic selection pressure (25.0 \u03bcg/mL). Knockdown efficiency of TPC1 and TPC2 was confirmed by immunoblotting (Ab94731 and Ab119915 from Abcam) and by flow cytometry (Attune NxT) using immunofluorescence antibodies targeting TPC1 (Abcam, Ab94731) and TPC2 (Novus Biologicals, NBP1\u201092152).\n\nOverexpression of TPC1 and TPC2 proteins was conducted using CRISPR\u2010based gene activation plasmid\u2010encoded lentivirus particles against TPC1 (Santa\u2010Cruz, Sc\u2010404943\u2010LAC) and TPC2 proteins (Santa\u2010Cruz, Sc\u2010402960\u2010LAC); scrambled lentivirus (Santa\u2010Cruz, Sc\u2010437282) was used as a control. Following 48 hours post\u2010transduction, 10 \u03bcg/mL of puromycin (Fisher Scientific), hygromycin (Santa\u2010Cruz), and blasticidin\u2010HCl (Fisher Scientific) were added to stable activation of CRISPR\u2010based gene activation plasmids. After incubation for 3\u20104 days, cells were passaged to remove the dead and dying cells, and the remaining living cells were cultured for an additional 48 hours prior to being taken for experimentation. Gene activation or overexpression efficiency was confirmed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies against TPC1 (Abcam, Ab94731) and TPC2 (Abcam, Ab119915).\n\nThe release of fluorescent\u2010dextran from endolysosomes into the cytosol and the detection of the translocation of galectins to damaged endolysosomes were used to assess endolysosome membrane permeability. For the detection of released fluorescent\u2010dextran from endolysosomes into the cytosol, cells were seeded on 35 mm2 dishes. The next day, Alex488\u2010Dextran (MW: 10K) (10 \u03bcM, Thermo Fisher) was incubated with the cells for 5 hours. Then, chloroquine (100 \u03bcM) or Trans\u2010Ned19 (50 \u03bcM) was added to the cells and incubated for 4 hours. Cells were then washed three times by 1X PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes. Cells were examined by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM800). Green fluorescence in the cytoplasm and in puncta structure was quantified (Image J) and analyzed. Increased green fluorescence in the cytoplasm and decreased green fluorescence in the puncta pattern indicates the leakage of dextran from the endolysosomes. For the detection of the translocation of galectins to damaged endolysosomes, cells were seeded on 35 mm2 dishes. The next day, cells were treated with chloroquine (100 \u03bcM) or Trans\u2010Ned19 (50 \u03bcM) for 24 hours. Cells were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes followed by cold methanol (\u221220\u00b0C) for 10 minutes. The cells were then washed with PBS, blocked with 5% goat serum, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibody Alexa\u2010647 conjugated Galectin\u20103 (Abcam, Ab207358). Cells were examined by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM800). Galectin\u20103 positive puncta in each single cell were quantified and analyzed. Increased numbers of galectin\u20103 positive puncta indicate the increased leakage of endolysosomes.\n\nCells were harvested and lysed in 1X RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher) plus 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma\u2010Aldrich). After centrifugation (14 000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C), supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined with a DC protein assay (Bio\u2010Rad). Proteins (10 \u03bcg) were separated by SDS\u2010PAGE (12% gel) and transferred to PVDF membranes with iBlot 2 (Invitrogen). The membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with antibodies against GAPDH (Abcam, Ab181603), TPC1 (Abcam, Ab94731), and TPC2 (Abcam, Ab119915). The blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified with our LI\u2010COR Odyssey Fc Imaging System. Quantification of results was performed by densitometry and the results were analyzed as total integrated densitometric volume values (arbitrary units).\n\nAll data were presented as means and standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance between two groups was analyzed by Student's t\u2010test and the statistical significance among multiple groups was analyzed by one\u2010way or two\u2010way ANOVA plus a Tukey post hoc test. P < .05 was accepted to be statistically significant.\n\nBecause Tat disrupts intracellular calcium homeostasis,39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 we investigated the involvement of calcium in Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation in U87MG cells stably expressing luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV\u20101 LTR promoter.47, 48 We first determined the extent to which cytosolic calcium is involved in Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. Here, free cytosolic calcium was decreased using BAPTA\u2010AM, a plasma membrane permeable calcium chelator. BAPTA\u2010AM (1\u20104 \u03bcM) significantly attenuated Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation (Figure 1A). Using a cell\u2010free assay, we demonstrated that Tat did not affect BAPTA's ability to chelate calcium (Data not shown). Given that endolysosomes have readily releasable stores of intracellular calcium ranging in concentration from 400 to 600 \u03bcM,49, 50 we next determined if endolysosome calcium affected Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. Endolysosome calcium depleting using a high\u2010affinity rhodamine\u2010dextran (MW: 10 000) that enters cells via endocytosis and efficiently chelates endolysosome calcium51 significantly inhibited Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation (Figure 1B). These findings indicate that endolysosome calcium plays a role in Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation.\n\nTo activate LTR transactivation in the nucleus, exogenous Tat must first escape endolysosomes. Here, we used a quantitative split\u2010GFP fluorescence assay for the direct measurement of Tat endolysosome escape.52 In this assay, H1299 cells stably expressing the GFP\u03b21\u201010 protein fragment were treated with a 29\u2010amino acid GFP\u03b211\u2010Tat peptide. The exogenously added GFP\u03b211\u2010Tat peptide, once released from endolysosomes, induced fluorescence complementation with the intracellularly expressed GFP\u03b21\u201010 protein fragment (Figure 2A). Using flow cytometry, we first determined concentration (0\u2010100 \u03bcM)\u2010 and time (0\u20106 hours)\u2010dependent responses of exogenous GFP\u03b211\u2010Tat\u2010induced GFP fluorescence complementation. We demonstrated that 50 \u03bcM of exogenous GFP\u03b211\u2010Tat\u2010induced robust GFP fluorescence complementation that plateaued at 4 hours and that GFP\u03b211\u2010Tat treatment (50 \u03bcM for 4 hours) did not have cytotoxicity as indicated by LDH assay (Data not shown). We demonstrated that GFP\u03b211\u2010Tat\u2010induced concentration\u2010dependent increases in GFP fluorescence (Figure 2B) was enhanced in the presence of chloroquine, a lysosomotropic agent that enhances the efficiency for extracellular Tat\u2010induced LTR transactivation27, 38, 53, 54, 55 and enhances HIV\u20101 infectivity in cells that require endocytosis for HIV\u20101 virus entry.56, 57 Using confocal microscopy imaging, we confirmed that GFP\u03b211\u2010Tat\u2010induced the fluorescence complementation of the intracellularly expressed GFP\u03b21\u201010 protein fragment (Figure 2C) and that this effect was enhanced by chloroquine. Using this split\u2010GFP Tat endolysosome escape assay, we determined next the involvement of calcium in Tat endolysosome escape. We demonstrated that chelating cytosolic calcium with BAPTA\u2010AM (2.5\u201010 \u03bcM) significantly attenuated Tat endolysosome escape (Figure 2D). Using a cell\u2010free assay, we demonstrated that BAPTA did not affect GFP\u03b211\u2010Tat\u2010induced GFP fluorescence complementation with GFP\u03b21\u201010 protein fragment (Data not shown). Furthermore, we demonstrated that chelating endolysosome calcium with rhodamine\u2010dextran significantly attenuated Tat endolysosome escape (Figure 2E). Using a cell\u2010free assay, we demonstrated that rhodamine\u2010dextran did not affect GFP\u03b211\u2010Tat\u2010induced GFP fluorescence complementation with GFP\u03b21\u201010 protein fragment (Data not shown). Given that calcium affects vesicular trafficking,58 we then determined the extent to which chelating endolysosome calcium with rhodamine\u2010dextran affects Tat internalization; rhodamine\u2010dextran did not affect Tat\u2010FITC internalization nor did it affect Tat\u2010FITC levels in the media (Figure 2F). These findings indicate that endolysosome calcium plays a role in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation.\n\nNext, we determined the involvement of endolysosome\u2010resident calcium channels in Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. A variety of endolysosome\u2010resident calcium channels have been implicated in endolysosome calcium release including TRPML, TPC, TRPM2, P2X4, P\u2010type, and L\u2010type.59, 60, 61 Using pharmacological approaches, we determined the extent to which blocking endolysosome calcium channels affected Tat\u2010mediated LTR\u2010transactivation. For these studies we blocked TPC with Ned\u201019, TRPML with ML\u2010SI1, TRPM2 with flufenamic acid, P2X4 with 5\u2010BDBD, P\u2010type calcium channel with \u03c9\u2010agatoxin TK, and L\u2010type calcium channels with verapamil. Ned\u201019 significantly inhibited Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation in a concentration\u2010dependent manner (Figure 3E), but none of the other calcium channel blockers significantly affected Tat\u2010induced LTR transactivation (Figure 3A\u2010D). However, verapamil at the high concentration of 50 \u03bcM did significantly inhibit Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation (Figure 3F), but it is likely that this was due to its ability to block TPCs at such high concentrations.62 Using the newer TPC blockers tetrandrine and fangchinoline63, 64, 65 at subtoxic concentrations of 0.5 and 1 \u00b5M66 we showed that tetrandrine (Figure 3G) and fangchinoline (Figure 3H) both significantly attenuated Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. Thus, our pharmacological studies suggest strongly that blocking TPC attenuates Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation.\n\nWe next determined the involvement of TPCs in Tat endolysosome escape using the split\u2010GFP fluorescence Tat endolysosome escape assay. Blocking TPCs with Ned\u201019 significantly attenuated Tat endolysosome escape in the absence and presence of chloroquine (Figure 4A). To further investigate whether these effects resulted from altered Tat internalization, we then determined the extent to which blocking TPCs with Ned\u201019 affected Tat internalization. Ned\u201019 did not affect the internalization of Tat\u2010FITC nor did it affect the remaining levels of Tat\u2010FITC in the media (Figure 4B). These observations indicate that blocking TPCs prevents Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation.\n\nGiven recent findings that blocking TPCs prevents the entry of virus into cells,63, 64, 65 blocking TPCs may generally affect the escape of a variety of macromolecules from endolysosomes. Thus, we determined the extent to which blocking TPC affects the release of fluorescent\u2010dextran (MW: 10 000) from endolysosome into the cytosol and the translocation of galectin\u20103 (26 kDa) to damaged endolysosomes.67, 68 As a gene delivery enhancing agent, chloroquine's ability to promote endolysosome escape has long been recognized.69, 70, 71 Chloroquine can rapidly diffuse into cells where it can be trapped in endolysosomes,72 and upon protonation and subsequent influx of water molecules, chloroquine can induce osmotic swelling of the endolysosome and endolysosome leakage.73, 74 Thus, we used chloroquine as a positive control for endolysosome leakage and determine the extent to which blocking TPCs affects endolysosome leakage. Indeed, we demonstrated that chloroquine induced the endolysosome leakage of fluorescent\u2010dextran and galectin\u20103 (Supplementary Figure S1). Significantly, we demonstrated that blocking TPCs with Ned\u201019 significantly attenuated chloroquine\u2010induced endolysosome leakage of fluorescent\u2010dextran (Figure 4C); Ned\u201019 attenuated chloroquine\u2010induced increases in cytosolic green dextran fluorescence and decreases in endolysosome green dextran fluorescence. In addition, using the galectin\u20103 puncta assay we found that Ned\u201019 significantly reduced chloroquine\u2010induced endolysosome leakage (Figure 4D); Ned\u201019 attenuated chloroquine\u2010induced increases in the number of galectin\u20103 puncta. Our finding suggests that blocking TPCs exerts a general protective effect on endolysosome leakage.\n\nTo further explore the involvement of TPCs in Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation, we knocked down the expression levels of TPC1 (Figure 5A) and TPC2 (Figure 5C) using shRNA strategies in U87MG cells, as confirmed by immunoblotting. Both TPC1 and TPC2 antibodies were validated in overexpression studies. The knockdown of TPC1 (Figure 5B) and TPC2 (Figure 5D) both significantly attenuated Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. Consistent with our pharmacological findings, TRPML1 knockdown did not affect the Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation (Supplementary Figure S2).\n\nTo further determine the extent to which TPCs are involved in Tat endolysosome escape, we knocked down the expression of TPC1 (Figure 6A) in H1299 cells using shRNA strategy. The knockdown of TPC1 attenuated Tat endolysosome scape (Figure 6B). Blocking TPCs with Ned\u201019 did not further block Tat endolysosome escape in TPC1 knockdown cells (Figure 6B). We then determined the extent to which TPC1 knockdown affects Tat internalization and found that TPC1 knockdown did not affect the internalization of Tat\u2010FITC nor did it affect the remaining levels of Tat\u2010FITC in media (Figure 6C). Next, we knocked down the expression of TPC2 (Figure 7A) in H1299 cells using shRNA strategy and found that knockdown TPC2 also attenuated Tat endolysosome scape (Figure 7B). Blocking TPCs with Ned\u201019 could not further block Tat endolysosome escape in TPC2 knockdown cells (Figure 7B). We also determined the effect of TPCs knockdown on Tat endolysosome escape in the presence of chloroquine and found that TPC1 knockdown, but not TPC2 knockdown attenuated Tat endolysosome escape in the presence of chloroquine (Supplementary Figure S3). To further investigate whether these effects resulted from altered Tat internalization, we then determined the extent to which blocking TPC2 knockdown affects Tat internalization. We found that TPC2 knockdown significantly increased the internalization of Tat\u2010FITC and decreased the remaining levels of Tat\u2010FITC in media (Figure 7C). In addition, we knocked down the expression of TRPML1 using shRNA strategy (Figure 7D) and found that TRPML1 knockdown did not affect Tat endolysosome escape (Figure 7E).\n\nThe endocytic delivery of extracellular macromolecules and plasma membrane components for intracellular degradation requires traffic through early to late endosomes followed by fusions between late endosomes and lysosomes.75, 76, 77, 78 Endolysosomes are complex and dynamic organelles that exhibit morphological and functional heterogeneity as well as the ability to physically and functionally interact with other organelles. An important hallmark of endolysosomes is their acidic luminal pH, which is maintained largely by the electrogenic pumping of protons by the v\u2010ATPase in conjunction with vesicular chloride transporters that shunt the membrane potential and allow for a build\u2010up of luminal protons.77, 79 The acidic pH of endolysosomes is critical for the activity of up to 60 different pH\u2010sensitive hydrolytic enzymes including proteases, lipases, and nucleases thus enabling the endolysosomes to break down a wide range of endogenous and exogenous cargos.78\n\n\nIn order to replicate, viruses need to enter host cells, and many viruses including HIV\u20101 enter host cells through the endocytic pathway.80, 81, 82, 83 Once endocytosed, viruses can be degraded by pH\u2010sensitive hydrolytic enzymes in endolysosomes or alternatively they can escape the endolysosomes following which they can transit to the nucleus or recycled back into the extracellular space.84 Similar to viruses, secreted viral proteins from infected cells can also enter cells via endocytosis. For instance, released HIV\u20101 viral proteins gp12085, 86 and Tat24, 25, 26, 27 have been shown to enter cells via endocytosis, where they can exert direct cytotoxic effects. Tat protein is of particular importance for HIV\u20101 infection, HIV\u20101 disease progression, and the development of HIV\u2010associated neurological complications because HIV\u20101 Tat is essential for viral transcription,15, 16, 17 ART does not block the secretion of Tat in HIV infected individuals,18, 19 and because brain levels of Tat remains elevated even though HIV\u20101 levels are undetectable.19 Secreted from HIV\u20101 infected cells,20, 21, 22, 23 Tat can bind to cell surface receptors including LRP1, heparin sulfate proteoglycan, CD26, and CXCR4, and enters CNS cells via receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis.24, 25, 26, 27 Following its endocytosis and internalization into endolysosomes, Tat must undergo endolysosome escape and transit to the nucleus where it can activate the HIV\u20101 LTR promoter.36, 37, 38 Tat transits through late endosomes to the cytosol,38 but it is not clear how Tat escapes endolysosomes.\n\nBesides protons, endolysosomes contain high levels of calcium second only to the endoplasmic reticulum.49, 87 The release of calcium from endolysosomes has been implicated in numerous functions central to cellular well\u2010being including lysosomal exocytosis,88 endosome\u2010lysosome fusion,89 the activation of TFEB,90 and the regulation of oxidative stress.91 The release of calcium from endolysosomes is mediated by a variety of endolysosome\u2010resident calcium channels.60, 61 Because others and we have shown consistently that Tat treatment leads to calcium dyshomeostasis in neuronal and non\u2010neuronal cells,39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 we investigated the involvement of calcium in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation using split\u2010GFP Tat endolysosome escape and Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation assays. We found that chelating endolysosome calcium attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation, and that these affects were not the result of altered Tat internalization.\n\nEndolysosomes contain multiple calcium channels including a family of TPCs; TPC1, TPC2, and TPC3 (not present in mice, rats, and primates).92, 93 TPCs are located in endosomes and lysosomes where they trigger the release of Ca2+, Na+ or other cations from acidic organelles in response to various activators.65, 92, 93 TPC1 is broadly localized to recycling endosomes, early and late endosomes, and lysosomes, while TPC2 is localized more with lysosomes.92, 94, 95, 96 One fundamental difference between TPC1 and TPC2 is their voltage dependence97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103; TPC1 is a voltage\u2010gated channel able to be activated by the NAADP, Ca2+, and PI(3,5)P2, whereas TPC2 is voltage\u2010insensitive.\n\nTPCs participate in the regulation of multiple endolysosome trafficking pathways97, 98, 99, 100, 101 and TPC1 helps control the uptake and processing of proteins in endolysosomes through the release for calcium.104 TPCs are also involved in the pathogenicity of viruses like Ebola and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV). In particular, the inhibition of or the absence of TPCs blocks the entry of the Ebola virus into the host cell62, 63 and impairs the progression of MERS\u2010CoV through the endolysosome system.64 Consistent with these findings, our findings provide evidence that TPCs are involved in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent Tat\u2010mediated LTR activation. First, we demonstrated that a set of pharmacological blockers (Ned\u201019, verapamil, tetrandrine, and fangchinoline) of TPCs attenuated Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. Second, we demonstrated that blocking TPCs with Ned\u201019 attenuated general endolysosome leakage as well as specific Tat endolysosome escape. Third, the knockdown of TPC1 or TPC2 attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. These effects were selective to TPCs because knocking down the endolysosome\u2010resident TRPML1 did not affect Tat endolysosome escape or subsequent Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. Our findings suggest that blocking TPCs exert a general protective against the leakage of endolysosomes and especially the escape of larger molecules (MW \u2265 10 000) from endolysosomes because pharmacologically blocking TPCs attenuated the leakage of dextran (10 kDa) and increased the accumulation of galectin\u20103 (26 kDa), and because knocking down TPC1 enhanced Tat (14 kDa)\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. However, knockdown TPC2 had a modest effect on endolysosome escape of the 29\u2010amino acid GFP\u03b211\u2010Tat peptide (MW ~ 3.5 kDa) used in the Tat endolysosome escape assay possibly due to enhanced internalization of Tat\u2010FITC.\n\nThe significance of these findings is threefold. First, because Tat is essential for HIV\u20101 replication and important for the activation of latent HIV reservoir, our findings that TPCs are involved in Tat endolysosome escape indicate that TPCs might be involved in latent HIV\u20101 infection especially in cells that require endocytosis for HIV\u20101 virus entry. Thus, blocking TPCs represent a novel therapeutic strategy against latent HIV\u20101 infection. Second, Tat is a neurotoxic protein, and the neurotoxic effect could result from Tat disturbing endolysosome function or Tat disturbing the function of other organelles such as mitochondria following Tat endolysosome escape. Thus, Ned\u201019, by inhibiting endolysosome leakage and preventing Tat endolysosome escape, may ameliorate Tat\u2010induced neurotoxicity and may represent a novel therapeutic strategy against HIV\u2010associated neurological comorbidities. It is important to note that the advantage of blocking TPCs as a therapeutic strategy is that TPC1 as well as TPC2 knockout mice do not have a reduced life span or an obvious reduction in quality of life.97 Third, it is well known that Tat has the extraordinary ability to cross the plasma membrane and has been used to transport a variety of macromolecules into a plethora of cell types.105, 106, 107, 108 Our findings that TPCs are involved in Tat\u2010endolysosome escape provide TPCs as a novel target for enhancing the transport of macromolecules into cells. Although we explored the involvement of TPCs in Tat endolysosome escape in the present study, the underlying mechanisms whereby Tat escapes endolysosomes remain unclear. Thus, further mechanistic studies are warranted.\n\nIn summary, our finding demonstrated that TPCs are involved in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation. Our findings suggest that TPCs might be a therapeutic target against latent HIV\u20101 infection and HIV\u2010associated neurological complications, and our findings represent a step forward toward developing TPC antagonists as a novel therapeutic approach against HIV. In addition, our findings suggest that TPCs might represent a novel target for enhancing the transport of macromolecules into cells.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\nX.
