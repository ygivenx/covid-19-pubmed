{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Beyond the assistance: additional exposure situations to COVID-19 for healthcare workers", "body": "1 Beyond the assistance: additional exposure situations to COVID-19 for healthcare workers Sir, Although many workers may be exposed to the novel coronavirus, healthcare workers (HCWs) have an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their close contact with patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 [1, 2] . For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other authorities have recommended the adoption of adequate prevention and control measures for HCWs. WHO has recommended that HCWs should use proper personal protective equipment (PPE), such as medical masks, gowns, gloves and eye protection [3] . In some cases, such as in aerosol-generating procedures, WHO has recommended the use of FFP2 respirator masks [3] . Strict compliance with these recommended measures and with good practice procedures for managing infectious diseases may minimize the risk of virus transmission from patients to HCWs. We also want to emphasize the continued need to provide HCWs with adequate PPE in order to reduce the high risk of contracting COVID-19 whilst caring for patients.\n\nNone declared.\n\nNone."}
