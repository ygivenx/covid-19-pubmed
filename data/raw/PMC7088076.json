{"title": "Age effects in monetary valuation of reduced mortality risks: the relevance of age-specific hazard rates", "body": "To reduce mortality risks and hence save people\u2019s lives, various risk reduction programmes are generally available. They differ in their effectiveness regarding the number and groups of beneficiaries. For example, reducing air pollution leads to a reduction in respiratory diseases, which saves the lives of primarily the youngest and oldest groups of the population, while only working people benefit from reduced work place risks. If budget constraints are relevant, the question emerges how restricted resources should be distributed across the available life-saving measures so that social benefits are maximised.\n\nAn economic approach to evaluate the benefits resulting from reduced health risks is the concept of \u201cvalue of statistical life\u201d (VSL). The VSL provides a monetary measure of health benefits and represents the ratio at which people are willing to exchange income for risk changes. The VSL is often inferred from information about the individual willingness-to-pay (WTP) to prevent mortality risks. It is an ongoing discussion whether the financing of life-saving measures should be adjusted to individual characteristics (for a comprehensive discussion, see Sunstein 2004). Adjustment according to age has provoked particularly intense debate. Government agencies pursue different approaches regarding the use of such a \u201csenior discount\u201d. For example, while the European Commission DG Environment recommends an adjustment to age (European Commission 2000), an age-dependent VSL is not applied by the US Environmental Protection Agency (Environmental Protection Agency 2003, p. 37). These different governmental approaches may result from ambiguous findings in the literature with respect to age effects on VSL.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to investigate empirically the importance of hazard rates in explaining the ambiguity discussed in theoretical and empirical literature regarding the age-sensitivity of the VSL. In contrast to previously published preference studies, the relevance of an individuals\u2019 probability of dying for VSL estimates is analysed by using information on a particular risk specification that allows for distinguishing explicitly between two groups exposed to the same risk type. In this paper, mortality risk is defined as the probability of dying in a snow avalanche. While one group (skiers) faces an age-dependent hazard rate, the hazard rate of the others (non-skiers) is rather insensitive to individual characteristics. The paper addresses the question of whether people benefit differently from reduced mortality risks, in particular, whether WTP and VSL is sensitive to age once the individual mortality risk (which can be either sensitive or insensitive to age) is taken into account. Age is considered by calculating the WTP and VSL for particular age classes.\n\nI find that the individual hazard rate associated with a particular risk plays a crucial role in explaining the age dependency of VSL measures. Age effects do occur for skiers but are not present for non-skiers. Accordingly, adjustment to age may be justified only in cases where the individual probability of dying varies with age.\n\nThe paper is organised into the following sections: \"Review of literature\" examines the literature dealing with the estimation of VSL and its age dependency, \"Survey design\" describes socio-economic characteristics, survey setting and wording of risk. \"Estimation procedure\" explains model specification, VSL, and age effects. \"Results\" summarises the overall effects. \"Conclusion\" presents resolving remarks.\n\nThe literature dealing with estimation of VSL is extensive. VSL is discussed in various contexts, such as valuation of reduced health risks (e.g. cancer, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases), work place risks, traffic risks, or risks arising from natural hazards.1 In general, VSL estimates are dependent on whether they are based on one\u2019s overall risk of dying or on a very specific risk of dying, the profile of future income, the remaining life expectancy or the individuals\u2019 baseline risk. Among these determinants, the relevance of age in mortality risk assessment is of ongoing interest and has been discussed and analysed in several studies.\n2 The theoretical literature defines two key components of how age affects the monetary valuation of reduced mortality risks: (1) the individual hazard rate (probability of dying), and (2) the level of optimal consumption.\n\nShepard and Zeckhauser (1984) discuss the trade-off between an increase in survival probability and the level of consumption. In their simulations, the authors demonstrate that the profile of WTP with respect to age depends on the existence of markets for borrowing and annuities, as such markets influence the individuals\u2019 income over time and, hence, the individual consumption path. If no markets exist, the WTP for risk reductions follows an inverted-U shape, with lower values for the youngest and oldest individuals in the population and a peak of payments at the age of 40. However, this shape is dampened considerably when perfect markets for borrowing and annuities are available. A further theoretical discussion of age effects on VSL is provided in Johansson (2002) or Alberini et al. (2004). These authors also analyse the role of individual hazard rates and the utility of income and argue that theory does not support a general decline of VSL with age. They conclude that, depending on the age sensitivity of the hazard rate and the utility of income, the VSL can either remain age-independent, increase, or decrease with increasing age.\n\nSuch theoretical discussions show that age can influence the VSL quite differently. Empirical studies provide evidence for this ambiguous picture. For example, Smith et al. (2004) estimate the VSL for older workers by observing their behaviour (wage-risk trade-offs) on the labour market. Their findings show an increase of compensation requirements with increasing age, which is mirrored in higher VSL figures for older employees. Viscusi and Aldy (2007) examine how VSLs vary with age across the working population considering age-specific fatality risks. Their VSL estimates for different age classes project an inverted U-shape, indicating that VSL figures first rise and then fall with age. A considerable decrease of VSL with age is found in Alberini et al. (2005), in which the authors estimate the WTP for reduced cardiovascular and respiratory risks. According to their results, people in their 70s state values that are about three-quarters lower than the statements of 30-year-old respondents. Alberini et al. (2004) examine the influence of age and health risks on VSL using data from two contingent valuation studies conducted in Canada and the US. They analyse the individuals\u2019 WTP for a reduction in their overall mortality risk\u2014without pointing at a specific risk\u2014and find weak (no) evidence for decreasing VSL with increasing age in the Canadian (US) sample. Liu et al. (2005) refer to mortality risks due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and do not find any influence of age on WTP to eliminate the chance of becoming infected.\n\nBased on these examples, I argue that the individual probability of dying associated with a particular risk type plays a crucial role. For instance, while workplace risks or cardiovascular risks are age-dependent and affect a particular group of individuals (job risks: working population; cardiovascular risks: elderly people), people of all ages are potentially in danger of becoming infected with some viruses. The following sections describe in detail how the assumption that the individual probability of dying is an important factor in the monetary valuation process for reduced health risks is tested in a stated preference framework.\n3\n\n\nThis paper analyses responses from a contingent valuation survey conducted in September/October 2004 and February 2005 in Tyrol, a federal state of Austria. A randomised quota sample of 1,997 individuals was drawn from the Tyrolean population aged over 15 years. The quota applied to the subjects\u2019 district of residence and size of domicile. Within the quota, random sampling was used. The respondents were asked in face-to-face interviews at their permanent residences about their WTP to prevent an increase in the risk of dying in a snow avalanche.\n4 Table 1 compares the socio-demographic characteristics of survey participants and the population of Tyrol to give an insight into how well the sample represents the population.\n\n\nA comparison of the sample characteristics with the census attributes shows a good approximation to the population characteristics in gender, birth place, and income,\n5 while the divergence in age, children per capita, and smoking behaviour is considerable. The self-reported health\n6 in the sample conforms quite well with the census average. The differences between the sample and census with respect to education and employment may result from the younger age of individuals in the sample.\n\nIn order to control for the sensitivity of WTP to the dimension of risk variation (=\u201cscope effects\u201d) two different risk changes were incorporated in the questionnaire: participants in the winter survey were asked about their WTP to prevent a doubling or quadruplication of the baseline risk.\n7 The initial risk level was inferred from official statistics. Risk prevention was assumed to come from passive control measures against avalanches, i.e. fatal avalanche accidents could be reduced by means of constructions such as tunnels or barriers. In the underlying study it was assumed that an increase in risk is avoidable by means of maintenance of pre-existing risk reduction programmes. The reduction in question was described as follows (divergence in wording for the larger risk variation in parentheses):Several risk reduction programmes against avalanches on roads and in residential areas have been implemented in Tyrol. At present, on average 2.35 people out of 100,000 inhabitants are killed by avalanches annually. Assume that all public funds for maintaining these measures will be cut, and so servicing costs henceforth have to be paid exclusively out of private funds. If aggregate private contributions are too small, maintenance is not carried out, and the probability of a fatal avalanche doubles (quadruples). Then, on average, 4.7 (9.4) people out of 100,000 inhabitants die in avalanche-related accidents (see Fig. 1). Would you be willing to pay\u2014given your income constraint\u2014a monthly insurance premium of \u20ac 2.5/5/10 to maintain the effect of previous risk reduction programmes to save human lives?\n\n\n\nRespondents were assigned randomly to one of three versions that differ in the bid vector. The initial bids of versions 1, 2 and 3 are 2.5, 5, and 10, respectively. Depending on the response to the first question, participants were asked whether they would also pay 5 (version 1)/10 (version 2)/20 (version 3) Euros in case of a \u201cyes\u201d answer to the initial question, or 1.3 (version 1)/2.5 (version 2)/5 (version 3) Euros if the reply to the first question was \u201cno\u201d.\n8 If the interviewees\u2019 answers were \u201cno; no\u201d or \u201cdo not know; no\u201d they were asked whether they would pay anything at all and why they refused payment.\n9 Individual responses were classified as protest answers if the interviewees stated that they generally refuse payments for protection against natural hazards or if it was argued that the protection of citizens was the responsibility of the government. Protesters (N = 329) were excluded from further analyses.\n10\n\n\nAvalanche protection of roads and residential areas are usually financed by national, federal and municipal funding. Analogous to the Austrian social security system, which finances publicly provided health services through compulsory insurance premiums, \u2018insurance premium\u2019 was used as a parafiscal payment vehicle that respondents are familiar with. This approach was chosen to avoid respondents\u2019 negative attitudes towards taxes.\n11\n\n\nIn order to reduce the difficulty of interpreting small risk variations (Kunreuther et al. 2001, Shanteau and Ngui 1989), I considered the recommendation of Corso et al. (2001) and visualised the risk change in question. In the Tyrolean study, a logarithmic scale was implemented to picture the risk variation (see Fig. 1; graph shown for the smaller change). The bottom and top indicate low and high risk, respectively. Along the risk ladder, other mortality risks, such as cancer, AIDS, or car accidents were plotted to enable a comparison and relative estimate. Additionally, the magnitude of the risks was also stated as number of affected persons in differently sized populations (e.g. small town, city).\n\nThis section links the theoretical background of VSL and the econometric approach chosen in this paper and refers to the arguments given in Johansson (2001).\n\nReductions in mortality risk are commonly evaluated within a state-dependent utility framework (Jones-Lee 1974; Pratt and Zeckhauser 1996; Weinstein et al. 1980). It is assumed that individuals substitute income, y, for a risk change, \u0394p, so as to maximise their expected utility. Johansson (2001) looks at this maximisation problem using a life-cycle VSL approach, explicitly considering the influence of age on the VSL. This approach assumes that individuals maximise their expected remaining present value utility (ERPVU) subject to a dynamic budget constraint. Solving the maximisation problem results in the maximal ERPVU at age \u03c4, denoted by V\n\u03c4(\u03c4), conditional on having survived until age \u03c4 (for details, see Johansson 2001):\n1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ V_{\\tau}(\\tau)=\\int\\limits^{\\infty}_{\\tau}{u\\left[c^{*}(t)\\right]}e^{-\\theta(t-\\tau)}\\mu(t;\\tau){\\rm d}t $$\\end{document}\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$u\\left[c^{*}(t)\\right]$$\\end{document} denotes the utility derived from the optimal consumption level at age t,  \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$c^{*}(t),$$\\end{document} with t \u2265 \u03c4,  \u03b8 represents the marginal rate of time preference and is assumed to be a constant, and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mu(t;\\tau)={\\frac{\\mu(t)} {\\mu(\\tau)}}$$\\end{document} stands for the survival function conditional on attaining age \u03c4 with \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mu(t)=e^{-\\int_0^t\\gamma(s)ds}$$\\end{document} and the hazard function \u03b3(s).12 Consider a decrease in the hazard rate and the associated change in the ERPVU:2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ dV_{\\tau}(\\tau)=\\int\\limits^{\\infty}_{\\tau+T}{u\\left[c^{*}(t)\\right]}e^{-\\theta(t-\\tau)}d\\mu(t;\\tau) $$\\end{document}with \u03c4 + T referring to the point in time when the risk reduction starts and d\u03bc(t;\u03c4) representing the time change in the survival function resulting from the change in the hazard rate.

Thus, negative aspects of new constructions (e.g. interference with the environment, natural scenery), which may cause negative WTP values, should not impact the valuation process. Given the individuals\u2019 and the public\u2019s preference for safety, a reduction in mortality risks increases welfare. Hence, respondents are expected to have at least non-negative WTP values so that a distribution that allows only zero or positive values is appropriate. A naturally positive distribution is therefore used to estimate WTP.\n\nThe estimates in this paper are based on a Weibull distribution assumption of the error term.\n14 The cumulative distribution function for a Weibull distribution is\n10\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ F({\\rm WTP}_{i}^{*})=1-\\exp(-(B_{i}^{\\bullet}/\\psi_{i})^{\\rho}) $$\\end{document}with the bid level B\ni\u2022, shape parameter \u03c1 and scale parameters \u03c8i.\n15 Thus, using Eqs. 8, 9 and 10, the log-likelihood function for the Weibull can be written as\n11\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\rm Log}L_{\\rm weib}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} d_{i}^{nn}\\ln[1-\\exp(-(\\frac{B_{i}^{L}}{\\psi_{i}})^{\\rho})]+\\\\ d_{i}^{yy}\\ln[\\exp(-(\\frac{B_{i}^{H}}{\\psi_{i}})^{\\rho})]+\\\\ d_{i}^{yn}\\ln[\\exp(-(\\frac{B_{i}^{I}}{\\psi_{i}})^{\\rho})-\\exp(-(\\frac{B_{i}^{H}}{\\psi_{i}})^{\\rho})]+\\\\ d_{i}^{ny}\\ln[\\exp(-(\\frac{B_{i}^{L}}{\\psi_{i}})^{\\rho})-\\exp(-(\\frac{B_{i}^{I}}{\\psi_{i}})^{\\rho})] \\end{array} \\right\\} $$\\end{document}\n\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimates resulting from Eq. 11 are used to calculate the mean WTP, which is the appropriate welfare measure informing cost benefit analysis (CBA) of avalanche risk reduction programmes.\n16 In the case of the Weibull distribution, mean WTP is calculated as\n12\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\rm mean}_{\\rm weib}=\\psi_{i}\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{\\rho}+1\\right) $$\\end{document}where \u0393(\u2022) represents the gamma function (see Cameron and Trivedi (2005), p. 584).\n\nThe VSL describes the rate at which individuals are willing to forgo money for a (small) risk reduction. It is calculated by dividing the annual WTP by the given risk change. Here, WTP and VSL figures are presented for six different age classes to examine variations in VSL with age.\n\nIn order to examine the influence of age on WTP for the two groups of hazard rates (skiers/non-skiers), indicator variables for age classes\u2014defined according to Viscusi and Aldy (2007)\u2014are included as explanatory variables in the regressions.\n17 The observations of respondents aged 18 and older were used, and were classified into six age classes: 18\u201324, 25\u201334, 35\u201344, 45\u201354, 55\u201362, and 63+.\n\nThe theoretical arguments given in Shepard and Zeckhauser (1984), Johansson (2002), and Alberini et al. (2004) show that the impact of age on the VSL is ambiguous and depends primarily on the individual hazard rate and optimal level of consumption. Under the assumption that skiers and non-skiers differ only in their hazard rate (higher age-specific avalanche risks for skiers vs age-independent risks for non-skiers), the skier\u2019s VSL is expected to have a larger age-gradient than the non-skier\u2019s VSL. For non skiers, the VSL should even be quite constant over age as their hazard rate is age-independent (see the theoretical analysis above).\n\nThe empirical evidence also suggests that the age-specific mortality risk (hazard rate) may be a crucial argument. Thus, the following analysis focuses on examining the relevance of the hazard rate in individual valuations. If it is true that the type of hazard rate (age-dependent vs age-independent) influences individual utility differently, this pattern has to be considered in the evaluation of corresponding life-saving measures and in designing an optimal policy.\n\nDue to the topographical characteristics of residential areas in Tyrol (see Footnote 1), the present survey of WTP to reducing avalanche risks allows two types of hazard rates to be distinguished: one refers to the risk for non-skiers and the other to mortality risks for skiers. While the former face a baseline risk of dying in an avalanche, which is relevant for most residents (independent of their age), the group of skiers are confronted with additional avalanche risks by pursuing their hobby. The following paragraphs describe the different hazard rates with respect to avalanche risks for skiers and non-skiers.\n\nNon-skiers as well as skiers who live in Alpine regions are confronted with a basic avalanche risk. Exposure to this basic avalanche risk is related mainly to the location of residential areas and the traffic routes chosen by residents while carrying out their daily business (working, shopping, \u2026). The risk of getting caught in an avalanche in their own homes or while in a car, bus or train is independent of the individual resident\u2019s age.\n18 Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the avalanche risk for non-skiers is age-independent, as all people who live in Alpine regions are\u2014independent of their age\u2014exposed to this basic avalanche risk.\n\nThe difference in the hazard rate between skiers and non-skiers emerges from the skiers\u2019 additional risk of dying in an avalanche due to their presence in snowy Alpine areas. From the official statistics of avalanche fatalities [provided by the Alpine Safety and Information Centre (ASI-Tirol) and the Kuratorium fuer Alpine Sicherheit] in the past five winters it can be inferred that all deaths listed occurred among the group of skiers.\n19 Furthermore, the number of fatalities varies across age groups. On a 5-year average (winter 2004/2005\u2014winter 2008/2009), the highest number of avalanche-related deaths, namely 4.6, occurred among 25- to 34-year-olds. The average death toll among those aged 35\u201344 and 45\u201354 years amounts to 3.8 and 4.4, respectively (see sixth column in Table 2). What is of relevance in this context is not the absolute number of skiers who died in avalanches but their probability of dying, which depends on the number of people exposed to additional avalanche risks (i.e. skiers). I combined information given in the survey with data from official statistics to obtain a rough estimate of this probability.\n\n\nThe second and third column in Table 2 report the number and proportion of skiers per age class in the sample. Overall, 822 out of 1,545 respondents were skiers but the proportion of skiers decreases steadily with age. The number of skiers in the population (fifth column) was calculated by multiplying the age specific proportion of skiers in the sample (third column) by the corresponding 5-year average of population size in each age class (fourth column), which gives the number of skiers in the Tyrolean population assuming that the sample\u2019s proportion of skiers is constant over time and that the sample is representative of the Tyrolean population. Dividing the average number of avalanche-related fatalities of (back country) skiers in the 5-years period 2004/2005\u20132008/2009 by the number of skiers in the population leads to the skiers\u2019 conditional probability of dying in an avalanche (seventh column). This probability\u2014conditional to being a skier\u2014shows that the probability of dying in an avalanche is lowest for 55- to 62-year-olds and peaks for 45- to 54-year-olds.\n20\n\n\nThe level and intensity of risk exposure (e.g. how often skiers go on ski trips or back country tours; the ability to adequately respond to challenging terrains) among skiers depend on their (physical) abilities and skills. As Table 2 indicates, the probability of being a skier and therefore being potentially at (higher) risk varies with age. Age-related variation is also seen in the absolute number of avalanche fatalities and, more important, for the probability (conditional on being a skier) of dying in an avalanche.\n\nBy splitting the sample into skiers and non-skiers, it is possible to examine age effects on the VSL implicitly by considering the different levels of individual hazard rates. According to Eq. 5, the VSL among the group of skiers is expected to vary across age classes and should be lower for individuals at higher avalanche risk [higher hazard rate, i.e. lower survival function \u03bc (t;\u03c4)]. On the contrary, the age-gradient of non-skiers should be less pronounced, and their VSL should be more constant due to their age-independent hazard rate. The relevance of age is considered by calculating the WTP and VSL for particular age classes.\n\nApart from the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants (age, gender, income, \u2026), the survey data provide information about risk-related attributes, such as individual behaviour in risky situations (e.g. using sunscreen, wearing seat belts), preferences for alternative risk reduction programmes (other than protection against avalanches), and risk perception.\n21 These variables are included in the regression to control for internal validity of WTP estimates. Table 3 provides a brief description of these explanatory factors.\n\n\nThe intensive discussion of how age influences WTP for risk reduction programmes encourages a detailed analysis of age effects. I estimated an econometric model using all observations and also ran regressions for each sub sample (skiers and non-skiers) separately. This procedure allows one to determine whether the influence of age on the respondents\u2019 WTP differs between the two types of hazard rates. Table 4 presents the estimated coefficients.\n\n\nEstimates using the information in the total sample are discussed first. The coefficient of the scope dummy (largereduct) indicates that the results pass the sensitivity test; respondents who value higher risk prevention reveal a significantly higher WTP than those whose statements are based on the smaller variation. As expected, WTP increases with increasing income (lnincome) and increasing perception of avalanche risks (riskpercept). WTP is significantly higher for respondents who had personal experience with avalanches in the past (famexp), who volunteer their time for welfare services (volunteer), who are skiers (skiing), and who face workplace risks (jobrisk).\n22 Negative impacts on WTP show higher education (alevel) and existing preferences for alternative risk reduction programmes (impalter). Surprisingly, respondents in the winter sample state a significantly lower financial contribution although avalanche events often occur in this period. From previous analyses it can be inferred that interviewees in winter who consider avalanches as human-caused events state a significantly lower WTP, and that the \u201coutrage effect\u201d, as discussed in Kahneman et al. (1993) or more recently in Bulte et al. (2005), is weaker than the \u201cresponsibility effect\u201d (Walker et al. 1999) for respondents in winter.\n23 The lower WTP statements of those who consider avalanches as human-caused events indicate that these respondents are not willing to support risk-reduction programmes in situations where people at risk voluntarily choose their level of risk exposure and, hence, are themselves responsible for their risk experience. This result also indicates that the claim for responsible behaviour outweighs the potential upset (outrage) involved with man-made adverse situations (i.e. those which would not have occurred without human intervention) and the individual\u2019s willingness to correct man-made harm accordingly.\n\nOnce the sample is split into two groups, an interesting pattern concerning these significant variables can be observed. Skiers are in general much more sensitive to the above-mentioned characteristics than non-skiers\u2014with two exceptions. (1) While the coefficient on income (lnincome) is positive in both groups it is significant only for non-skiers. (2) If non-skiers think that other risk reduction programmes to save human lives are more important than protection against avalanches they state a significantly lower WTP (impalter). This effect is not significant for skiers.\n\nWhich influences of age on WTP can be observed? Using the full sample, I found that respondents aged 35\u201344 (age35\u201344) and 63+ (age63+) reveal a significantly lower WTP (21 and 27%, respectively). The remaining age classes do not differ significantly from the youngest group. When the sample is divided into \u201cSkier\u201d and \u201cNon-Skier\u201d, the significantly lower WTP statements at higher age occur only among respondents facing an age-sensitive hazard rate (see column \u201cSkier\u201d). Furthermore, the significant effects are even more pronounced for skiers: people aged 35\u201344 and 63+ state significantly lower payments, which are 28% and 40% below the WTP of the reference group of 18- to 24-year-old individuals. No significant age effect is observable for the group of non-skiers who are equally affected by avalanches\u2014independent of their age.\n\nThese results point to an age dependency of WTP for respondents whose hazard rate varies with age (skiers), while no age-related variation is observable for non-skiers whose avalanche-related fatality rate is independent of age.\n\nMean WTP for risk reduction programmes against avalanches is calculated by using the estimated coefficients shown in Table 4. The coefficients reported for \u201cSkiers\u201d and \u201cNon-skiers\u201d are combined with the characteristics of an average respondent in the particular group. Mean WTP is computed using Eq. 12. VSL figures can be calculated from WTP values by dividing the annual WTP by the dimension of prevented risks for the average respondent (=1/42,500).\n24 Table 5 depicts WTP and VSL for each age class and type of hazard rate referring to the smaller risk change.\n\n\nMonthly mean WTP (and therefore VSL) across age classes is quite similar for non-skiers and ranges from \u20ac4.77 to 5.98 (from \u20ac2.4 to 3.1 million). For non-skiers whose risk of dying in an avalanche is age-independent, no significant differences occur between the age classes. However, a more pronounced variation among age classes is observable for skiers: their WTP figures range from \u20ac3.45 to 5.85 (=monthly WTP) and from \u20ac1.8 to 3.0 million (=VSL), respectively. The differences in WTP between the reference group of 18- to 24-year-old skiers and the age classes 35\u201344 and 63+, respectively, are statistically significant.\n25\n\n\nThis analysis supports the hypothesis made: age variation is more pronounced for the group of skiers and is statistically significant within this group only. There is evidence that age-sensitivity matters for the valuation of fatality risks and that age-dependent hazard rates play a crucial role in explaining the variation in VSL figures: age effects occur for individuals whose mortality risk due to avalanches is age-dependent, while no age effects are observable for respondents whose risk level is independent of their age.\n26 These results suggest that policies that aim at an efficient provision of live-saving measures have to take into account such variations in the beneficiaries\u2019 hazard rates. An overall approach would miss the diversity in benefits and would lead either to an over- or under-supply of risk-reducing measures.\n\nAssuming that the utility of consumption and life expectancy is constant, another question can be addressed: do skiers know that they belong to a higher risk group? Jones-Lee (1974) or Weinstein et al. (1980) argue that the higher the individual\u2019s mortality risk, the higher the WTP for reducing life-threatening risks. This means that, based on the tendency shown in Table 2, the 45\u201354 (55\u201362) year-olds with the highest (lowest) conditional probability of dying in an avalanche should reveal the highest (lowest) WTP. But the estimated WTP paints a different picture: WTP of 55\u201362 (45\u201354) year-olds is the highest (third lowest) value. This admittedly rough and simplified comparison could lead to a premature conclusion that skiers do not correctly predict their risk of dying in an avalanche (i.e. they rather base their decision on subjectively perceived risk levels). However, one has to keep in mind that such a statement is based on strong assumptions. The skiers\u2019 remaining life expectancy and their potentially time-variant utility of consumption are further determinants of the VSL (see \"Estimation procedure\"), which may explain these deviations.\n\nThe estimation procedure described in \"Estimation procedure\" assumes a Weibull distribution of the error term. Both responses (initial and follow-up) to the payment questions are used, which implies that respondents show a consistent behaviour and think of a single amount when stating their WTP. It is often questioned whether it is appropriate to use both answers from a DBDC format. The resulting estimates are inconsistent when the responses to the follow-up questions do not reveal utility-maximising behaviour or rational preferences but are influenced by various factors such as yea-saying, weariness or free-riding (see for example, Herriges and Shogren 1996; Bateman et al. 2001; McFadden 1994; Park 2003). An alternative to deal with these problems would be to consider only the first response to the payment question. The disadvantage of this approach is that one forgoes a gain in statistical efficiency provided by the follow-up responses (e.g. Alberini 1995; Hanemann et al. 1991). This means that a trade off between bias and efficiency exists.\n\nIn order to check how the results vary using the single-bounded approach the same regressions discussed for the DBDC format but ignoring the responses to the second question are conducted. The coefficients estimated do not change considerably. For example, using the sample of skiers, the corresponding coefficients on the age dummies age25\u201334, age35\u201344, age45\u201354, age55\u201362, and age63+ are \u22120.202, \u22120.077, \u22120.205, 0.349, and \u22120.655. However, the age effects cannot be estimated precisely any more due to the large standard errors, which are at least twice as high as in the double-bounded case.\n\nA second approach\u2014the Turnbull distribution-free estimator described in Haab and McConnell (2002)\u2014that imposes as few restrictions as possible on the estimation procedure is conducted to test for the robustness of age effects.\n27 The calculation of the welfare measure is quite straightforward but this is at the cost of testing for covariate effects,\n28 i.e., the Turnbull mean WTP is a descriptive unconditional estimate. Comparing the Turnbull WTP among age classes for the group of skiers, one finds that the WTP for people aged 25\u201334 and 63+ is significantly lower than WTP for the youngest. Further significant differences are observable between other age classes as well. The depreciation is strongest, and always highly significant, for the oldest. In the group of non-skiers, such a pronounced age pattern is not observable. There are only three pairs of age classes where WTP differs significantly from each other.\n29 But WTP for non-skiers aged 63 and older does not show a statistically significant deviation from the mean values in the other age classes. As the Turnbull estimates represent a lower bound of WTP, mean WTP virtually always lies below the parametric mean values.\n\nTo summarise, among the group of skiers, strong evidence for a lower WTP for older people is found using the Turnbull estimator but this clear pattern does not occur among non-skiers. As the Turnbull estimator is a distribution free estimator that uses only the first response to the bid question, one can conclude that the difference in age sensitivity between the two groups is dependent neither on the chosen distributional assumption nor on the presumptions imposed by using the DBDC format. The single-bounded estimates also suggest that the dimensions of age effects do not differ considerably when only the first response is used, so that the double-bounded approach is favoured and the additional information from the follow-up response is used.\n\nThis paper discusses a relevant feature of monetary valuation of reduced mortality risks: the age-sensitivity in an individuals\u2019 valuation of live-saving measures. I focus on comparing the WTP statements of two groups of beneficiaries who focus on the same type of risk but who face different hazard rates: for one group the hazard rate varies across age, for the other it is constant. The results indicate that the consideration of age-specific hazard rates is important and can explain the different findings regarding the age dependency of VSL estimates in the empirical literature.\n\nThe analysis is based on a CV survey carried out in Austria in two waves (autumn 2004/winter 2005). WTP for preventing fatal avalanche accidents is estimated by the method of maximum likelihood using an interval-data model and assuming a Weibull distribution of the error term. The sample is split into two groups (skiers and non-skiers) who differ in their levels of fatality risks. Age class dummies are included in the regression model to test for age effects among the two groups.\n\nThe results highlight the fact that the non-skiers\u2019 evaluation of risk reduction is almost constant and independent of age, while the skiers\u2019 WTP statements considerably vary over age. In other words, the estimates reveal age-sensitive VSLs for respondents to whom risk exposure is age-dependent (skiers). But no significant differences between the age classes are observable for non-skiers who face only an age-independent \u201cbaseline\u201d risk due to the location of their residences. Average VSL for non-skiers ranges from 2.4 to 3.1 million Euro. For the group of skiers the VSL lies between 1.8 and 3.0 million Euro. Within the latter group a statistically significant depreciation of VSL for the age classes 35\u201344 and 63+ is observable: VSL is 28 and 40% lower than the VSL for the youngest.\n\nWhat implications can be drawn from these findings for the efficient use of public funds to finance life-saving measures? The results in this paper indicate that the age pattern of individual hazards rates is a decisive determinant in explaining age variations in VSL figures and, hence, in justifying an adjustment of those measures to age. If protection measures that aim at protecting a wide population whose mortality risks do not depend on individual characteristics such as age are at stake (i.e. risk exposure is the same for all beneficiaries), an adjustment of the resulting benefits to age is not justified. In this setting, non-skiers belong to this group as they reveal similar WTP across all ages. A \u201csenior discount\u201d as sometimes proposed would contradict the individual statements. In the context of preventing fatal avalanche accidents, an age adjustment in VSL measures is appropriate solely for skiers. In this case, policies that simply use an overall value but do not control for such variation ignore the diversity in benefits and, hence, lead to an insufficient provision of (environmental) risk-reducing measures.\n\nConsidering the growing number and intensity of weather extremes it is of increasing importance to learn how residents evaluate protection measures against natural hazards to provide an efficient level of life-saving policies. Further research remains to be done to learn about the validity of these findings for, and the transferability to, other environmental risk or health risk valuations."}
