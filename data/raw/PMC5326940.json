{"title": "Characterization of canine coronavirus spread among domestic dogs in\nVietnam", "body": "A total of 80 fecal swabs were collected from 30 diarrheic and 50 healthy dogs in animal\nhospitals and households, respectively, in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam from 2013 to 2015.\nTheir ages ranged from 2 months to 13 years. Swab samples were dissolved in 2\nml of phosphate-buffer saline (PBS), filtrated through a\n0.22-\u00b5m filter (Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Ireland) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C\nuntil analysis.\n\nA total of 201 serum samples were collected from healthy dogs in different districts in\nHo Chi Minh City from 2013 to 2015 and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until analysis.\n\nRNA was extracted from CCoV-infected cells and filtrated fecal swabs using RNeasy Mini\nkit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), respectively.\n\nRT-PCR was performed using QIAGEN One step RT-PCR (Qiagen). The primer sets ORF3F, 5\u2032-CAC\nTAA ACT CAA AAT GTT GAT TC-3\u2032 and ORF3R, 5\u2032-TTA AGG ATT AAA AAC ATA TTC TA-3\u2032 [15] and 2bF, 5\u2032-AGG TTG TTG TGG ATG CAT AG-3\u2032 and 2bR,\n5\u2032-ACG GTC AAG TTC GTC AAG TA-3\u2032 [3], were used for\ndetection of CCoV-I and CCoV-II, respectively. Amplified products were confirmed as 628 bp\nfor CCoV-I and 232 bp for CCoV-II by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and were then\npurified using QIAquick PCR Purification kits (Qiagen) for sequencing.\n\nFor differentiation of CCoV subgenotypes, primers 1bF, 5\u2032-TTG ATT CAA AGA TTT GAG TAT\nTGG-3\u2032 and CCVSR, 5\u2032-GTT AGT TTG TCT AAT AAT ACC AAC ACC-3\u2032, were used to amplify the\n5\u2032-terminal region of the S gene [30]. RT-PCR was\nperformed using a TaKaRa RNA LA PCR TM kit (AMV) Ver.1.1 (Takara, Otsu, Japan).\nRT was carried out with random 9-mer primers at 30\u00b0C for 10 min, 42\u00b0C for 30 min and 99\u00b0C\nfor 5 min, and then, PCR was performed. Amplified fragments were purified using a QIAquick\nPCR Purification kit (Qiagen) for sequencing.\n\nFelis catus whole fetus-4 cells (fcwf-4 cells; ATCC Number: CRL-2787)\n[11] were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s minimum\nessential medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) containing 10%\nheat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Sigma-Aldrich), 100 units/ml\npenicillin and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Life\nTechnologies). Fcwf-4 cells in 6-well plates were inoculated with extracts from\nCCoV-positive feces and were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nCells were observed daily for cytopathic effects (CPE). If there were no CPE, cells were\nblind-passaged five times.\n\nIsolated CCoV was plaque-purified three times. Briefly, 10 PFU of CCoV were inoculated on\nfcwf-4 cells in 6-well plates. After 1 hr of adsorption, inoculum was removed, and 0.8%\nagarose in DMEM containing 10% FCS was overlaid on cells. After the appearance of CPE,\nplaques were picked up by tips and dissolved into DMEM. This plaque-purification procedure\nwas repeated three times.\n\nThe sequence of the 3\u2032-terminal one-third of the viral genome from S gene to poly A was\ndetermined by RT-PCR using TaKaRa RNA LA PCRTM kit (AMV) Ver.1.1 (Takara). RT\nwas carried out with random 9-mer primers at 30\u00b0C for 10 min, 42\u00b0C for 30 min, 99\u00b0C for 5\nmin and 4\u00b0C or oligo dT-Adaptor primer at 42\u00b0C for 30 min, 99\u00b0C for 5 min and 4\u00b0C for 5\nmin. Then, PCR was performed with the following primers: 1bF, 5\u2032-TTG ATT CAA AGA TTT GAG\nTAT TGG-3\u2032; CCVSR, 5\u2032-GTT AGT TTG TCT AAT AAT ACC AAC ACC-3\u2032; CCVScenF, 5\u2032-TAA GTA ACA TCA\nCAC TAC C-3\u2032; S6, 5\u2032-CCA AGG CCA TTT TAC ATA AG-3\u2032; ScenFF3, 5\u2032-CTG GAC TGT ACC TGA ATT\nG-3\u2032; and the reverse primer M13 primer M4, 5\u2032-GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG AC-3\u2032.\n\nIn order to amplify the S gene of CCoV-IIa, PCR was performed using the following pimers:\n1bF, CCVSR, CCVS2CenF, 5\u2032- CTA TTC TGT GAC ACC ATG TG-3\u2032 [30] and 2bR. Amplified products were confirmed by electrophoresis on 0.8%\nagarose gels and were then purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen). The\nnucleotide sequences were determined by an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer auto sequencer\n(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.). Sequences were assembled and analyzed using\nGENETYX\u00ae ver.8 (Software Development Co., Tokyo, Japan).\n\nVN testing was performed using fcwf-4 cells as described previously [26, 30] with\nmodifications. CCoV-IIa fc1, isolated in Japan in 1990 [1], and CCoV-IIb CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015 strain, which was isolated and\nplaque-purified three times in this study, were used. Briefly, dog sera were inactivated\nat 56\u00b0C for 30 min before VN test. Equal volumes of two-fold serially diluted sera and\nvirus solution containing 2.0 \u00d7 103 PFU/ml of CCoV were mixed\nand incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. Then, 50 \u00b5l of this mixture was\ninoculated onto fcwf-4 cells monolayer in 24-well plates. After adsorption at 37\u00b0C for 1\nhr, inoculum was removed, and 0.8% agarose (Lonza, Rockland, ME, U.S.A.) in DMEM\ncontaining 10% FCS was overlaid. Infected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C until CPE was\nobserved, followed by fixing with phosphate-buffered formalin and staining with crystal\nviolet. When the number of plaques was less than 75% of those in control wells, diluted\nsera were judged to be positive. Titers were expressed as the highest serum dilution\nshowing 75% plaque reduction or more.\n\nPhylogenetic relationships based on the nucleotide sequences of the 5\u2032-terminal region of\nS genes or complete S genes were analyzed using distance-based (neighbor-joining) with\nMEGA 7.0 software [13]. Bootstrap values were\ncalculated based on 1,000 replicates.\n\nChi-squared and Fisher\u2019s exact probability tests were used for statistical analysis.\nP values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically\nsignificant.\n\nEighty-seven dogs (43.3%) were positive for anti-CCoV-II antibody. Prevalence of\nanti-CCoV-II antibody in dogs aged over 3 years (52.0%) was significantly higher than that\nin dogs aged under 1 year (28.6%) (P<0.05).\nPrevalence of anti-CCoV-II antibody in Vietnamese (39.2%) was significantly lower than\nthat in other breeds (63.3%) (Table\n1). Antibody titer against CCoV-II ranged from 1:10 to 1:320 (data not\nshown).\n\nTo detect CCoV-I and CCoV-II genes in fecal samples, RT-PCR was carried out using fecal\nsamples from 30 diarrheic and 50 healthy dogs. Although CCoV-I was not detected, CCoV-II\nwas detected from two diarrheic dogs (6.7%) and five healthy dogs (10%, 5/50) (Table S1).\nNext, nucleotide sequences of 5\u2032-terminal region of the S gene were analyzed to\ndifferentiate subgenotypes of CCoV-II and were deposited into the DNA database of Japan\n(DDBJ; Accession No. LC190901-LC190907) (Table S1). Phylogenetic analysis based on the\n5\u2032-terminal region of the S gene showed that one and six strains belonged to CCoV-IIa and\nCCoV-IIb, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table S1). Vietnamese CCoVs-IIb formed one cluster and was similar to Chinese\nferret badger DM95/2003 (95.4\u201395.6%) and CCoV/NTU336/F/2008 (95.2\u201395.6%). Vietnamese\nCCoV-IIa was similar to Raccoon dog GZ43/2003 (95.6%) (Fig. 1).\n\nNext, the full length of the S gene of CCoV/dog/HCM27/2014 was also determined (4,362 nt,\nDDBJ Accession No. LC190906). Phylogenetic analysis based on complete S genes showed that\nVietnamese CCoV/HCM47/2015 was similar to Chinese ferret badger CoV/DM95/2003 (95.9%) and\nCCoV/NTU336/F/2008 (95.2%), and that Vietnamese CCoV-IIa, CCoV/dog/HCM27/2014 was similar\nto Raccoon dog CoV/GZ43/2003 (97.4%) (Fig. 2).\n\nOne CCoV-IIb was successfully isolated from a healthy dog (female, six years old) and\ndesignated as CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015. For further analysis, the isolate was plaque-purified\nthree times, and the nucleotide sequence of the 3\u2032-terminal one-third CCoV genome from the\nS gene to poly A (8,995 nt) was determined. Surprisingly, the plaque-purified CCoV had a\nlarge deletion in the ORF3abc and partial E genes (1,165 nt), and a short deletion in the\nORF7b gene (60 nt). Next, we determined nucleotide sequences of the original virus in the\nfeces, confirming that the original virus in feces did not have any deletions (DDBJ\nAccession No. LC190907) (Fig. 3).\n\nTo compare antibody titers against CCoV-IIa and -IIb, 60 sera were examined by VN testing\nusing fc1 and plaque-purified CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015, respectively. The results showed that\npositivity of antibody against CCoV-IIb (58.3%) was slightly higher than that against\nCCoV-IIa (51.7%) (Table 2). Four additional dogs became positive for anti-CCoV-IIb antibody, and nine\ndogs had significantly higher antibody titers (over 4-fold) against CCoV-IIb than CCoV-IIa\n(data not shown).\n\nIn this study, the prevalence of anti-CCoV-II anibody was 43.3%, suggesting that CCoV-II\nhas been spreading among the dog population in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. Seroprevalance of CCoV\ninfection was 15.8% in the open population and 40.8% in kenneled populations in Australia,\n44.1% in Japan, 90.8% in Italy and 96.5% in Turkey [1,\n9, 19, 24]. Sera from dogs in Vietnam reacted more strongly with\nCCoV-IIb than CCoV-IIa (Table 2), indicating\nthat CCoV-IIb is the major genotype in Vietnam. The results of RT-PCR in this study also\nsupported the notion that CCoV-IIb is the predominant genotype circulating in domestic dogs\nin Vietnam (Fig.1, Table S1).\n\nThe prevalance of antibody against CCoV-II increased with age (Table 1). Similar results were reported in Turkey [9]. Older dogs must have more opportunities to be infected\nwith CCoV. Seroprevalence of CCoV-II in imported breeds (63.3%) was significantly higher\nthan that in domestic breeds (39.2%). There have been similar reports in Japan [27, 29],\nindicating that many dogs are infected with CCoV while housed with breeders or in pet\nshops.\n\nIn this study, two diarrheic dogs (6.7%) and five healthy dogs (10%) were positive for\nCCoV-II, but no dogs were positive for CCoV-I. One of seven Vietnamese CCoVs strains was\npositive for CCoV-IIa, and others were positive for CCoV-IIb. Positivity for CCoV-I and\nCCoV-II in feces of dogs has been reported in Japan (CCoV-I: 53.2% and CCoV-II: 56.9%)\n[28], China (CCoV-I: 4.5% and CCoV-II: 23.9%)\n[32], Italy (CCoV-I: 25.2% and CCoV-II: 36.3%),\nUnited Kingdom (CCoV-I: 15.0% and CCoV-II: 20.6%), Hungary (CCoV-I: 22% and CCoV-II: 15%),\nGreece (CCoV-I: 37% and CCoV-II: 36%) [7], Brazil\n(CCoV-I: 47% and CCoV-II: 63%) [5] and Korea (CCoV-I:\n22% and CCoV-II: 10%) [12]. In Vietnam, CCoV-II,\nespecially CCoV-IIb, may be more predominant among the dog population than CCoV-I. However,\nCCoV-I infection in Vietnamese dogs should be examined by RT-PCR using further primer sets\nspecific for CCoV-I.\n\nBoth CCoV-IIa and IIb cause enteritis, and the lesion is limited to the small intestine\n[17]. On the other hand, pantropic CCoV-IIa spread\nsystemically and caused hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, neurological signs and leukopenia\n[8, 16].\nCCoV-IIb also spread systemically and infected to internal organs, when it co-infected with\ncanine parvovirus [16, 21]. However, there were no significant differences in CCoV infection\nbetween diarrheic dogs and healthy dogs. CCoV infection may not be a serious problem in\nVietnamese dogs. Further studies will be required to clarify the pathogenicity of CCoV in\nVietnam.\n\nPhylogenetic and sequence analysis based on S genes showed that Vietnamese CCoV-IIa\n(CCoV/dog/HCM27/2014) and CCoV-IIb (CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015) were smilar to CCoVs in China,\nChinese ferret badger CoV/DM95/2003 and raccoon dog CoV/GZ43/2003, respectively (Fig.2). These Chinese CoVs were found in\nlive animal markets in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China [31], suggesting that Vietnamese CCoVs might have the same\nancestor as these Chinese CCoVs. In our previous study, canine distemper virus in Vietnam\nwas also similar to Chinese viruses [20].\n\nWe succeeded in isolation of CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015 and plague-purified the isolate three\ntimes for further characterization. Surprisingly, the plaque-purified CCoV had a large\ndeletion in the ORF3abc and partial E genes (1,165 nt) and a short deletion of ORF7b (60 nt)\n(Fig. 3). Deletions in ORF3a (47 nt) and ORF3b\n(31 nt) in CCoV 1\u201371 [18], a deletion in ORF3b (38\nnt) in CB/05 [8] and a deletion in ORF7b (154 nt) in\n341/05 [7] have also been reported. These data\nindicate that ORF3abc and ORF7b are not essential and that they are stable in viral\nreplication in vitro, but not in vivo. In feline CoV, it\nwas reported that ORF3abc plays an important role in the efficient macrophage and monocyte\ntropism [2] and that deletion of ORF7b is correlated\nwith a loss of virulence [10]. In our preliminary\ndata, two dogs orally inoculated with plaque-purified CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015 did not show any\nclinical signs, but anti-CCoV antibody increased after challenge. Now, we are examining the\nvirulence of this plaque-purified CCoV. Importantly, virus isolation is important for\ncharacterization, but rapid adaptation by passage of coronaviruses should be monitored.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the first characterization of CCoV in Vietnam. In Vietnam, CCoV-IIa\nand CCoV-IIb, but not CCoV-I, are co-circulating among domestic dogs. This plaque-purified\nCCoV/dog/HCM47/2015 may be a good tool for diagnosis of CCoV infection, because of its rapid\nviral growth in vitro and antigenicity. Furthermore, the virus is a\ncandidate for inactivated and/or attenuated live vaccines, because genetic markers in\nORF3abc and 7b are able to differentiate it from field isolates."}
