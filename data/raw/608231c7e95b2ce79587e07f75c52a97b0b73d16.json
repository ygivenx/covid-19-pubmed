{"title": "A Filippov system describing media effects on the spread of infectious diseases", "body": "When a type of contagious disease appears and starts to spread, people's response to the threat of disease is dependent on their perception of risk, which is affected by public and private information disseminated widely by the media. Massive news coverage and fast information flow can generate a profound psychological impact on the public. Media communications have played an important role in affecting the outcome of infectious disease outbreaks, such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recent 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In particular, the propagation of information and education by media have great influence not only on individual behavior but also on the implementation of public intervention and control measures. If susceptible individuals are alert enough to avoid unnecessary contact with infected individuals or all infected individuals stay in the region being treated and cancel their trips, new transmission will apparently decrease due to reduced contact rates [7, 8] . The role of media coverage on the transmission of disease is thus crucial and should be given prominence in the study of disease dynamics.\n\nThere has been an increasing interest in models in which the impact of media coverage on disease spread in a given population is considered. Liu et al., in [1] , described the impact of media coverage on the transmission coefficient by a decreasing factor, resulting in the transmission coefficient \u03b2 exp(\u2212a 1 E \u2212 a 2 I \u2212 a 3 H), where E, I, and H are the numbers of reported exposed, infectious, and hospitalized individuals, respectively. Cui et al., in [3] , proposed a compartment model with incidence rate \u00b5 exp(\u2212mI)SI with m > 0 to reflect the impact of media coverage on the transmission. They have shown that Hopf bifurcation can occur when m > 0 is sufficiently small. Li et al., in [6] , used \u03b2 2 I/(m + I) to reflect the reduced amount of contact rate through media coverage and formulated an SIS (susceptible-infective-susceptible) epidemic model with incidence rate (\u03b2 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 I/(m + I))SI/N. Moreover, other forms, such as (\u00b5 1 \u2212 \u00b5 2 f (I))SI/(S + I), have been formulated to approximate the media-induced incidence rate (see details in [2, 4, 5] ).\n\nA common assumption for the models in [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] is that the impact of media coverage on the transmission of the infectious disease occurs as soon as the disease emerges and remains during the whole process of the disease's spreading. However, this is not really the case. Mostly, at the initial stages of an emerging infectious disease, both the general individuals and public mass media are unaware of the disease. Media reports, information processing, and individuals' alerted responses to the information can only arise as the number of infected individuals reaches and exceeds a certain level. For example, the A/H1N1 virus was first reported in two US children in Mexico in March 2009, but health officials have stated that it apparently infected people as early as January 2009 in Mexico [9] . Hence, at the initial stage, the number of A/H1N1 cases and information about early precautionary measures against the disease were not available. With a diseases spreading further and information about infectious disease outbreaks being reported, media coverage about an epidemic disease can encourage the public to take precautionary measures against the disease such as wearing masks, avoiding public places, avoiding travel when sick, and frequent hand washing.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary to refine the existing mathematical models with a media-induced effect to reflect this feature. Our main purpose is then to modify the known models in order to describe the impact of media coverage on disease transmission by introducing a piecewise continuous transmission term. We shall examine the effect of media coverage on disease transmission and to address whether the improved function representing a media-induced effect influences the global dynamics of disease transmission.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we propose a Filippov epidemic model to describe the mediainduced effect on the transmission of infectious diseases. In Section 3, sliding mode dynamics and the existence of a pseudo-equilibrium are investigated. In Section 4, the bifurcation set and the sliding bifurcation of the proposed system are discussed. The global dynamics under variable threshold levels is examined in Section 5, and a discussion and biological conclusion are given in Section 6. Finally, for readers' interests, we present a brief introduction to threshold policy in the Appendix.\n\nWhen the number of infected individuals increases and reaches a certain level I c , mass media often start to report information about the disease, including ways of transmission, number of infected individuals, and then the public try their best to avoid being infected. This consequently lowers the effective contact, resulting in a reduction in transmission rate which is usually represented by exp(\u2212\u03b1I). We consider a population that is divided into three types: susceptible, infective, and recovered. Let S, I, and R denote the proportions of susceptible, infective, and recovered individuals with respect to the total population of individuals, respectively. Then the model equations are\n\nwhere \u03c3 (S, I) is a given function which may depend on the number of susceptible and infected individuals, and \u03f5 is a discontinuous control function. But here we choose the special function \u03c3 (S, I) = \u03c3 (I) = I \u2212 I c , which means that only the number of infected individuals is the index for mass media to exhibit its effect. We note that model (1) with \u03f5 = 0 was introduced and examined in [10] . All other parameters are positive constants, where \u00b5 is the natural birth (death) rate, \u03b2 denotes the basic transmission rate, and \u03b3 represents the removed/recovered rate. Model (1) with (2) reveals a dynamical system subject to a threshold policy (TP), which is referred to as an on-off control or as a special and simple case of variable structure control in the control literature. A more detailed introduction on the TP is presented in the Appendix. Since the recovered class R does not influence the dynamics of the first and second equations of model (1), we only need to focus on the first two equations in the rest of this work. It is easy to show that\n\n= \u2126 is an attraction region of system (1). In fact, it follows from model (1) that S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = 1 and\n\nso all solutions will enter into the region \u2126 and remain in it ultimately. Hence, \u2126 is an attraction region. The (S, I) phase plane is split into three parts: G 1 = {(S, I) \u2208 R 2 + |\u03c3 (I) < 0}, G 2 = {(S, I) \u2208 R 2 + |\u03c3 (I) > 0}, and the discontinuous boundary\n\nThus, in region G 1 , there is no effect from media coverage, and the transmission rate \u03b2 remains unchanged, while in region G 2 , media coverage exhibits its effect, and hence the transmission rate declines to \u03b2 exp(\u2212\u03b1I). For convenience, let the vector Z = (S, I) T , and denote\n\nThen system (1) with (2) can be rewritten as the following Filippov system [12] :\n\nThe main characteristic of a Filippov system is that control is suppressed when the value of the threshold function is below a previously chosen threshold policy; above the threshold, control is applied, while in classical systems, control has been implemented all along [13] [14] [15] . In the following, we call Filippov system (4) defined in region G 1 system S 1 and that defined in region G 2 system S 2 . Since the right-hand side of system (4) is piecewise continuous, we consider its solutions in Filippov's sense throughout the paper, which refers to solutions of the differential inclusions\u017b (t) \u2208 F (Z(t)), where\n\nco stands for the convex hull, B(Z ; \u03b4) is the open \u03b4-neighborhood of Z , and \u00b5 denotes the Lebesgue measure. It follows from the definition of F G i , i = 1, 2, that F (Z(t)) is nonempty, bounded and closed, convex, and upper semicontinuous in Z . Then, by [12] , one gets that there exists a solution for system (4) with initial value S(t 0 ) = S 0 , I(t 0 ) = I 0 .\n\nWe note that system S 1 has been studied in [10, 11] , but for clarity we present the main result and main method here. It is easy to obtain the basic reproduction number R 0 = \u03b2/(\u00b5 + \u03b3 ).\n\nis globally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1, while the unique endemic equilibrium E 1 = (S 1 * , I 1 * ) is feasible and globally asymptotically stable if R 0 > 1, where S 1 * = 1/R 0 , I 1 * = \u00b5/\u03b2(R 0 \u2212 1). Proof. If R 0 < 1, taking a Lyapunov function V (t) = I(t) and applying LaSalle's invariance principle, one gets that E 0 is globally asymptotically stable. If R 0 > 1, we choose a Lyapunov function\n\nThen, by using LaSalle's invariance principle, we conclude that the endemic equilibrium E 1 is globally asymptotically stable.\n\nMoreover, the endemic equilibrium E 1 is a stable focus if \u2206 1 < 0, while it is a stable node if \u2206 1 \u2265 0, where \u2206 1 = \u03b2 2 \u00b5 \u2212 4(\u00b5 + \u03b3 ) 2 [\u03b2 \u2212 (\u00b5 + \u03b3 )].\n\nFor system S 2 , the basic reproduction number is also R 0 , and the disease-free equilibrium is E 0 . The possible endemic state E 2 = (S 2 * , I 2 * ) satisfies\n\nthen we have\n\nFurther, simple calculation yields\n\nfor all I \u2265 0. All those indicate that there exists a unique I such that g(I) = 0, denoted by I 2 * and such that 0 < I 2 * < \u00b5/(\u00b5 + \u03b3 ), which can be determined analytically. In fact, g(\n\n\ued61\ued61 .\n\nAccording to the definition of the Lambert W function and solving the above equation with respect to I 2 * , one obtains\n\nConsequently, S 2 * can be determined. The definition and properties of the Lambert W function can be found in the literature [16] .\n\nProof. If R 0 < 1, we take a Lyapunov function V (t) = I(t), and the same discussion as that in the proof of Proposition 1 yields that E 0 is globally asymptotically stable. If R 0 > 1, it is easy to get that the Jacobian matrix of S 2 at E 2 possesses two eigenvalues with negative real parts, so it is locally asymptotically stable. Further, letting a Dulac function B = 1/(SI) and\n\nusing Bendixson-Dulac criteria, we can exclude the existence of limit cycles, and hence E 2 is globally asymptotically stable.\n\nNote that the equilibria E 1 and E 2 are endemic equilibria for subsystems S 1 and S 2 , respectively. However, they could be either in region G 1 or in G 2 . If the equilibrium points are located in their opposite regions, they are named virtual equilibrium points. Otherwise, they are called real equilibrium points. Both real equilibrium and virtual equilibrium are called standard equilibrium or regular equilibrium (see the definitions in [17, 18] or the Appendix).\n\nThere may exist sliding segments on the boundary (3) if there are some subregions of the line \u03a3 such that both vectors of the two systems S 1 and S 2 are directed towards each other. Mathematically, there are two methods to determine sufficient conditions for a sliding mode to occur on the discontinuous surface: the well-known Filippov convex method [12] and Utkin's equivalent control method [18] . In the following, we employ the equivalent control method to determine the sliding domain and sliding mode dynamics of Filippov system (4).\n\nLet\n\n, where \u27e8\u00b7\u27e9 denotes the standard scalar product and F \u03c3 (Z) = \u27e8\u03c3 Z (Z), F (Z)\u27e9 is the Lie derivative of \u03c3 with respect to the vector field F at Z . Then the sliding domain can be defined as\n\nBy the definition of the switching surface \u03c3 (Z) (i.e., \u03c3 (Z) = I \u2212 I c ), and solving the two inequalities given in the above equation, one obtains the sliding domain of the Filippov system (4) as follows:\n\nNext, we address the dynamics of Filippov system (4) on the boundary \u03a3 S [18] . Note that \u03c3 \u2032 = I \u2032 = \u03b2 exp(\u2212\u03b1\u03f5I)SI \u2212 (\u00b5 + \u03b3 )I. Let \u03c3 \u2032 = 0; solving with respect to \u03f5, we have\n\nSubstituting this and \u03c3 = I \u2212 I c = 0 into the first equation of model (1), we obtain the sliding mode dynamics, which can be determined by the following differential equation:\n\nIt follows that there is an equilibrium S * = (\u00b5 \u2212 (\u00b5 + \u03b3 )I c )/\u00b5 for system (6) \n\nwhich is equivalent to\n\nwhere I 1 * and I 2 * are defined in Section 2.\n\nSince the components of both E 1 and E 2 satisfy \u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5S \u2212 (\u00b5 + \u03b3 )I = 0 and S 1 * < S 2 * , we know that I 1 * > I 2 * , which implies that the inequalities (7) are well defined. Note that the equilibrium E S = (S * ,\n\na pseudo-equilibrium of Filippov system (4) according to Definition A.2 in the Appendix.\n\nIn order to analyze the relation between the sliding segment \u03a3 S and the attraction region \u2126, we need to solve the following equations:\n\nIt is easy to derive \n\nsolving which yields\n\nThen we can get that the sliding segment \u03a3 S is totally out of the attraction region \u2126 if I c > I 1 c , while it lies totally in \u2126 for\n\nc , part of \u03a3 S is out of the attraction region \u2126 and part of it is in \u2126.\n\nBifurcation sets of equilibria and sliding modes are related to the sliding bifurcations, and all these are useful for the forthcoming global dynamics analysis.\n\nIn this subsection, we will address the richness of the possible equilibria and sliding modes that the system can exhibit.\n\nParameters \u03b1 and I c are chosen to build the bifurcation diagram, and all other parameters are fixed as those in Fig. 1 . We define the four curves for parameters \u03b1 and I c as follows:\n\n, are defined as in previous sections. The two solid lines L 1 and L 2 divide the \u03b1 \u2212 I c parameter space into three parts, and the coexistence of regular, virtual, or pseudo equilibria are indicated in each part. When I c > I * 1 (i.e., the region \u0393 1 \u222a \u0393 2 \u222a \u0393 3 ), the equilibrium E 1 is real, while E 2 is virtual (denoted by E 1 r and E 2 v , respectively), and E S does not exist. When I 2 * < I c < I 1 * (i.e., the region \u0393 4 \u222a \u0393 5 ), both the equilibria E 1 and E 2 are virtual (denoted by E 1 v and E 2 v , respectively), and E S does exist. When I c < I 2 * (i.e., the region \u0393 6 ), the equilibrium E 2 is real, while E 1 is virtual (denoted by E 1 v and E 2 r , respectively), and E S does not exist, either. It should be noted that the equilibria of system (4) actually include the equilibria of S 1 or S 2 , which may be real or virtual equilibria, and pseudo-equilibria, if feasible.\n\nThe two dashed lines L 3 and L 4 also divide the parameter space into three parts. In region \u0393 1 , the sliding segment \u03a3 S is totally out of the attraction region \u2126. In region \u0393 2 \u222a \u0393 4 , \u03a3 S is partly out of the attraction region \u2126 and it lies totally in \u2126 in region \u0393 3 \u222a \u0393 5 \u222a \u0393 6 .\n\nThis implies that, as the threshold level I c increases, the sliding segment \u03a3 S will enlarge and may intersect with the boundary of the attraction region \u2126 such that part of it is in the attraction region or even lies out of the attraction region ultimately.\n\nIt is clear that, if one or more parameters changes, some bifurcations occur in Fig. 1 . For example, boundary focus bifurcation as well as boundary node bifurcation can occur when one of the parameters varies such as I c , which will be addressed in detail in the following subsection.\n\nIn this subsection, we fix all other parameters and choose the threshold value I c as the bifurcation parameter. By Section 2, we know that E i is a focus (node) if \u2206 i < 0 (\u2206 i \u2265 0), where i = 1, 2. In the following, we only investigate the boundary focus bifurcation (i.e., \u2206 i < 0); the boundary node bifurcation (i.e., \u2206 i \u2265 0) can be discussed similarly. To clearly show the boundary focus bifurcation of Filippov system (4), we first discuss the following two types of special point named the tangent point (denoted as T ) and the boundary equilibrium (denoted as E b ). See [19, 20] and the Appendix for detailed definitions of the tangent point and boundary equilibrium.\n\nTangent points of Filippov system (4) satisfy\n\nsolving which with respect to S yields the following two tangent points:\n\nIt is clear that points T 1 and T 2 are the endpoints of the sliding segment \u03a3 S .\n\nThe boundary equilibrium of Filippov system (4) satisfies\n\nWe require the equalities \u00b5 + \u03b3 \u03b2 exp(\u2212\u03b1\u03f5I c ) = \u00b5 \u00b5 + \u03b2 exp(\u2212\u03b1\u03f5I c )I c to hold true to ensure the existence of boundary equilibria, which indicates that I c = I 1 * for \u03f5 = 0, while, for \u03f5 = 1, it is equivalent to\n\nsolving which gives I c = I 2 * . Hence, there exists boundary equilibrium\n\nprovided that I c = I 1 * or I c = I 2 * . If the pseudo-equilibrium, tangent point, and real equilibrium (or tangent point and real equilibrium) collide simultaneously when the parameter I c passes through a critical value, boundary focus bifurcation may occur. For example, when parameter I c passes through the first critical value I c = I 1 * , the equilibrium E 1 r and tangent point T 1 can collide, as shown in Fig. 2(b) , where I 1 * = 0.4667. In this case, the boundary equilibrium E 1 b is an attractor (see Fig. 2(b) ). A stable focus E 1 r and a tangent point T 1 coexist for I c > I 1 * , as shown in Fig. 2(a) with I c = 0.5. They collide at I c = 0.4667 and are replaced by a pseudo-equilibrium E S and a tangent point T 1 for I c < I 1 * , as shown in Fig. 2(c) with I c = 0.43. This bifurcation shows how a stable focus can become a stable pseudo-equilibrium. Another boundary focus bifurcation of Filippov system (4) occurs when parameter I c passes through the second critical value I c = I 2 * . In this case, a stable focus E 2 r and a tangent point T 2 coexist for I c < I 2 * . They collide at I c = I 2 * and are replaced by a pseudo-equilibrium E S and a tangent point T 2 for I c > I 2 * .\n\nWe shall investigate the global stability of all the possible equilibria, including the standard equilibrium and pseudoequilibrium, under different threshold levels and R 0 > 1. If R 0 < 1, the disease is eradicated, and it is not necessary to consider any media-induced effect; thus we only focus on the case when R 0 > 1.\n\nIndeed, to prove the global stability of the equilibrium of system (4), we need to rule out the existence of limit cycles. First, we shall preclude the existence of limit cycles totally in region G 1 or G 2 . Denote the right-hand sides of system S i by\n\nso there is no limit cycle totally in G 1 . Similarly, for system S 2 , we get\n\n\u2212 \u03b1\u03b2 exp(\u2212\u03b1I) < 0, so no limit cycle is totally in G 2 . By the above discussion, we easily obtain the following result.\n\nThere is no limit cycle for Filippov system (4) which is totally in region G i (i = 1, 2).\n\nNext, we shall preclude the existence of limit cycles, pieces of which are in the sliding region \u03a3 S .\n\nThere is no closed orbit for Filippov system (4) which contains part of the sliding segment T 1 T 2 .\n\nProof. By Section 4.1, there does exist a pseudo-equilibrium E S for I 2 * < I c < I 1 * which is asymptotically stable in the sliding domain \u03a3 S . The local stability of the pseudo-equilibrium E S on the sliding domain indicates that no limit cycle containing part of the sliding segment exists in such a case. Therefore, we only need to show the result for I c > I 1 * or for I c < I 2 * . In the following, we shall do it for I c > I 1 * ; for I c < I 2 * , we can use a similar process.\n\nIn fact, since I c > I 1 * , by the expression of the sliding domain given in (5), the sliding mode dynamics (6) satisfies S \u2032 < 0, which shows that the trajectory moves from the right to the left on the sliding segment T 1 T 2 (as shown in Fig. 3 ).\n\nWe only need to show that the orbit starting from the tangent point T 1 , denoted by l 1 , cannot hit the manifold \u03a3 again. Since E 1 r is a stable focus for \u2206 1 < 0, the orbit l 1 intersects with the horizontal isocline g 1 I , where g 1 I refers to \ued1b (S, I)|S = (\u00b5 + \u03b3 )/\u03b2, I < I c \ued20\n\n, at point M 1 first, and at point N 1 second. Hence we conclude that point N 1 lies between T 1 and E 1 r . Otherwise, the trajectory l 1 may either coincide with point T 1 or hit the manifold \u03a3 at some point to the right of point T 1 . If the former is true, l 1 is a closed orbit which is tangent to the sliding segment T 1 T 2 . Then any trajectory starting from a point out of the closed orbit l 1 cannot cross the cycle l 1 , and certainly cannot tend to the endemic equilibrium E 1 r , which contradicts the stability of equilibrium E 1 r in G 1 . If the latter holds, it indicates that the endemic state E 1 r is an unstable focus, which also contradicts that E 1 r is stable in G 1 . Hence the orbit initiating from point T 1 cannot hit the manifold \u03a3 but spirally approaches the stable equilibrium E 1 r . Therefore, no closed orbit containing part of the switching segment T 1 T 2 exists. This completes the proof. \n\n, denoted by g 2 I and g 2 S , respectively. The typical orbit l 1 is plotted simply to show the asymptotical stability of the focus E 1 r for Case 1 without great accuracy.\n\nWe now rule out the existence of the limit cycle induced by the nonsmooth nature of the trajectories on the complement to \u03a3 S in \u03a3; that is, we will prove that there is no limit cycle surrounding the sliding segment T 1 T 2 which is partly in region G 1 and partly in region G 2 . So, we give the following result when the sliding segment is totally within the attraction region.\n\nThere is no limit cycle surrounding the sliding segment T 1 T 2 in the attraction region \u2126.\n\nProof. The method of proving this lemma is similar to that in [21, 22] , but for readers interested in the technical aspects we give the details in the following. Suppose that X is a limit cycle in the interior of the attraction region \u2126, and that it surrounds the sliding segment T 1 T 2 with a period T , as shown in Fig. 4 . Denote its part below the line I = I c by X 1 and its part above the line I = I c by X 2 . Denote the intersection points of the limit cycle X and the line I = I c by H 1 and H 2 , the intersection points of X and the auxiliary line I = I c \u2212 \u03f5 by A 1 and A 2 , and the intersection points of X and another auxiliary line I = I c + \u03f5 by A 4 and A 3 , where \u03f5 (\u03f5 > 0) is any sufficiently small number. Let D 1 be the region delimited by X 1 and the segment A 2 A 1 , and let D 2 be the region delimited by X 2 and the segment A 4 A 3 . We denote the boundary of D 1 and D 2 by C 1 and C 2 , respectively, with the directions indicated in the Fig. 4 . Let the Dulac function be B = 1/(SI) defined as before. By the discussion given above and Green's theorem, we get\n\nthen, since we know that \u03be < 0, and, furthermore,\n\nSuppose that the abscissas of the points H 1 , 1, 2, 3, 4) is continuous and satisfies lim \u03f5\u21920 h i (\u03f5) = 0 and h i (0) = 0. Thus, we get\n\nBy the same process, we get\n\nwhich contradicts (8) . This rules out the existence of the limit cycle X . This completes the proof.\n\nTo establish all the possible behaviors that the system can exhibit, we choose variable sets of values for the parameters such that the dynamics in all regions are presented. In this subsection, we consider the following three cases. a b\n\nc d e f \n\nfor different parameter sets. The isoclinic lines g 1 I (g 2 I ) and g 1 S (g 2 S ) are plotted for the free (controlled) system S 1 (S 2 ). The curves represent the orbits in the phase plane indicating the asymptotical equilibrium. Parameters values are chosen such that dynamics in all region \u0393 i , i = 1, 2, . . . , 6 as shown in Fig. 1 Proof. By Lemmas 1 and 2, we know that there is no limit cycle totally in the region G i (i = 1, 2), or containing part of the sliding segment T 1 T 2 . Note that the sliding segment may be partly or totally in the interior of the attraction region. Then there are two possibilities to consider.\n\n(i) If I c \u2265 min{I 2 c , I 1 * }, it is easy to get (\u03b1, I c ) \u2208 \u0393 4 in the \u03b1 \u2212 I c plane (see Fig. 1 ), and part of the sliding segment T 1 T 2 is in the attraction region, as shown in Fig. 5(d) . Note that again the direction of the vector field in region G 2 \u2229\u2126 points downward.\n\nBy using similar arguments as the second possibility of Case 1, we obtain that no limit cycle exists in the attraction region.\n\n(ii) If I c < min{I 2 c , I 1 * }, then (\u03b1, I c ) \u2208 \u0393 5 in the \u03b1 \u2212 I c plane (see Fig. 1 ), and the sliding segment is totally in the attraction region \u2126, as shown in Fig. 5(e) . Based on a similar argument to Lemma 3, we can exclude the existence of limit cycles in the attraction region \u2126 which surround the sliding segment T 1 T 2 .\n\nNote that both locally stable equilibria E 1 and E 2 are virtual and then cannot be attained. Consequently, any orbit initiating from region G 1 (G 2 ) intersects with the switching segment in order to approach the equilibrium point E 1 v (E 2 v ). Further, according to the above discussion, no limit cycle exists in the attraction region. We then conclude the pseudo-equilibrium E S is globally asymptotically stable. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.\n\nCase 3. If I c < I 2 * , then we have (\u03b1, I c ) \u2208 \u0393 6 in the \u03b1 \u2212 I c plane (see Fig. 1 ). The endemic equilibrium E 1 is virtual and E 2 is a real equilibrium, and there is no pseudo-equilibrium. The sliding mode does exist, and the trajectory moves from the left to the right on the sliding segment in such a case, as shown in Fig. 5(f) . By a similar discussion to that in the third possibility of Case 1, we know that there is no limit cycle totally in the attraction region \u2126. If the endemic equilibrium E 2 r is locally stable, E 2 r is globally asymptotically stable, and we get the following conclusion.\n\nTheorem 3. For Filippov system (4) , the endemic equilibrium E 2 r is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 > 1.\n\nRemark. If we consider the continuous transmission rate (i.e., I c = 0), then system (1)-(2) becomes system S 2 . This indicates that the media coverage exhibits its effect once the epidemic disease emerges and begins to spread. By Proposition 2, we know that system S 2 will stabilize at the disease-free equilibrium E 0 or endemic equilibrium E 2 depending on the basic reproduction number R 0 . In fact, when R 0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium E 0 is globally asymptotically stable, suggesting that the disease is eradicated; when R 0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium E 2 turns out to be a global attractor, suggesting that the disease persists and the number of infected individuals approaches the level of I 2 * , which is determined uniquely by system S 2 itself. However, Filippov system (4) is an epidemic system with piece-wise continuous transmission rate. It follows from Theorems 1 and 3 that it may stabilize at one of the endemic equilibria (i.e., E 1 or E 2 ) of the variable structures when R 0 > 1, depending on the choice of the critical level I c . The most interesting and crucial issue is that the switched system (4) can stabilize at the pseudo-equilibrium E S (Theorem 2), which is new and qualitatively different from the equilibrium for system S 2 . This indicates that a previously chosen level of the desired number of the infected persons can be reached when the threshold level and other parameters are chosen properly, which may suggest to us an idea for disease control when the emergent infectious diseases cannot be eradicated immediately.\n\nA few mathematical models have described the impact of media coverage on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases (see [1, 3, 5, 6] ). The formulated models implicitly assume that the media-induced effect occurs throughout all the epidemic time. However, public mass media usually cannot be aware of or report infectious diseases when the number of infected individuals is generally small at the initial stages of disease spreading. To model this vital fact, we extend the existing models by incorporating a piecewise continuous transmission rate to represent that media reports and education can exhibit their effects once the number of infected individuals exceeds a certain level. To our best knowledge, system (1) with (2) is the first epidemic system that incorporates a piecewise continuous transmission rate to describe the real impact of media coverage on infectious diseases. The proposed epidemic model in this paper, which is described by a piecewise smooth ordinary differential equations, describes the media-induced effect subject to variable structure control. The system is actually called a Filippov system (or switching system) in control language [12] . A commonly used and implementable control is the simple on-off control, which can stabilize the models [21, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . The overall objective of this paper is to examine the effect of media coverage on disease transmission and to address whether the improved function representing the media-induced effect influences the global dynamics of disease transmission.\n\nThe analysis performed in this work establishes all possible dynamic behaviors that the present model can exhibit, as can be seen in Figs. 2 and 5. We employ the properties of the Lambert W function [16] and bifurcation analysis of piecewise smooth systems [19, 20] to investigate the long-term dynamical behavior of the proposed Filippov epidemic model. In particular, the sliding mode dynamics and the local sliding bifurcations have been addressed in this paper. The crucial role of the variable structure control in determining the dynamical behavior of the model is shown. We have also obtained the global stability for the Filippov epidemic model by using qualitative techniques. Our main results suggest that the system stabilizes at the equilibrium point E 1 r , E 2 r , or E S , depending on the threshold level I c . Six different types of threshold level are considered (see Fig. 5 ). For each one, the sliding segment is exclusively, partly, or totally in the attraction region. Fig. 5(a)-(c) show that the endemic state E 1 r is globally asymptotically stable, i.e., E 1 r is a global attractor. Trajectories may approach the endemic equilibrium E 1 r without sliding, or enter the sliding region and then slide and approach the equilibrium E 1 r , depending on the initial data. Similarly, Fig. 5(f) shows that the endemic equilibrium E 2 r is an attractor.\n\nThe most interesting case is represented in Fig. 5(d) and (e), where the threshold level I c is in between I 1 * and I 2 * (i.e., I 1 * < I c < I 2 * ) and both the equilibria E 1 and E 2 are virtual, from which we know that the pseudo-equilibrium E S is globally asymptotically stable. Comparing with the former cases, trajectories will enter the sliding domain and slide to the pseudoequilibrium E S . This implies that the infected population can stabilize at a previously chosen level (i.e., I c ) when the threshold policy and other parameters are chosen properly. Therefore, the threshold policy combines the characteristics of the free and controlled systems, and, in particular, induces a new equilibrium E S at which system (4) stabilizes compared to the dynamic behavior for system S 2 with continuous transmission rate incorporating media coverage (see [1, 3, 6] ).\n\nAlthough the threshold policy can significantly modify the dynamical behavior of the models studied, it is important to note that the number of infected individuals in the steady state triggered by the threshold policy is confined to a set of values determined previously by the parameters of the model, if some conditions on the parameters hold true. Hence, the policy is robust [17] to bounded uncertainty in the parameters, although it may cause displacement of the endemic equilibrium.\n\nIn this paper, we have conducted a qualitative analysis of the impact of media coverage on the transmission of infectious diseases. We have provided a more realistic and more natural description for the epidemic model with media coverage by considering the real procedure of media propagation and education in disease transmission. The results obtained here could be beneficial for accurately assessing the effect of the media coverage in the control and treatment of infective diseases.\n\nA threshold policy (TP) implies that, if the value of the threshold function is below the specified threshold level, control is suppressed, while if it is above the specified threshold level, control is implemented. As a result, a system subject to a TP leads to a variable structure system. The TP is also referred to as an on-off control in the control literature (see [17, 18] ). In the following, we shall establish a mathematical form for a TP. To illustrate our ideas, we choose a planar system as an example. A two-dimensional system submitted to a TP can be rewritten as\n\nwhere x (x \u2208 R 2 ) is the state vector, f \u2208 C (R 2 , R 2 ) is continuous, and the control u \u03c4 (u \u03c4 \u2208 R) is defined as\n\nwhere u 1 (x) = 0, \u03c4 (x) is a threshold dependent on the state vector x, and u \u03c4 is not continuous. For the case when \u03c4 (x) = 0, u \u03c4 is not defined, i.e., u \u03c4 is discontinuous on the boundary \u03c4 (x) = 0. A 'controlled system' refers to one in which the control u \u03c4 = u 2 is implemented, and a 'free system' is one in which the control is not implemented (i.e., u \u03c4 = 0). Let\n\nDenote the right-hand side of (A.1) (i.e., f (x, u \u03c4 )) in the region G i by f (i) (x, u \u03c4 ). 2), i.e., \u03bbf (x * , u 1 (x * )) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f (x * , u 2 (x * )) = 0, \u03c4 (x * ) = 0, where \u03bb = \u27e8\u03c4 x (x), f x (x, u 2 (x))\u27e9 \u27e8\u03c4 x (x), f x (x, u 2 (x)) \u2212 f x (x, u 1 (x))\u27e9 2) if f (1) (x * , 0) = 0, \u03c4 (x * ) = 0 or f (2) "}
