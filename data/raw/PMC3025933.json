{"title": "A Sensitive Assay for Virus Discovery in Respiratory Clinical\nSamples", "body": "Respiratory tract infection is the most common cause of hospitalization of children\nbelow the age of 5 years [1], [2]. In 5\u201340% of these hospitalizations no\ninfectious agent can be identified but it is suspected that a viral infection is\ninvolved [3]\u2013[5]. In these cases a yet unknown virus might be the cause of\nrespiratory illness.\n\nIn the last decades several viral discovery methods have been developed which can\ndetect viruses without knowledge of the genome sequence. We have previously used\nvirus discovery cDNA-AFLP (VIDISCA) to discover the human coronavirus NL63\n(HCoV-NL63) [6] and we were the first to describe human parechovirus type\n5 and 6 in the Netherlands using the same technique [7]. In the VIDISCA assay viral\ngenomes (which are (reverse-) transcribed into double stranded DNA) are digested\nwith restriction enzymes. The enzymes digest short (4 nucleotides) recognition\nsequences that are present in virtually all viruses. After ligation of adaptors, the\ndigested fragments are PCR amplified with adaptor-specific primers. The assay is\nuser-friendly however the sensitivity of the assay is low. At least 1 E6 genome\ncopies/ml of a virus in a background that is low in competitor RNA/DNA are needed.\nThese conditions are generally only met when virus culture supernatant is used. In\nclinical respiratory samples like nasopharyngeal swabs in universal transport medium\n(UTM) various amounts of competitor RNA/DNA from disrupted cells/bacteria can be\npresent. Ribosomal RNA, which is \u223c80% of the total cellular RNA, is one\nof the biggest problems due to its high copy number and its stability within\nribosomes. In particular RNA viruses are difficult to discover since in these cases\na reverse transcription is needed, which will enable rRNA to act as competiting\nnucleic acid sequences.\n\nOne research group has addressed the problem of competing rRNA [8]. Endoh et al showed that reverse\ntranscription with 96 hexamers that can not anneal to rRNA, decreases the amount of\nbackground amplification and enhances the sensitivity of a virus discovery assay. We\nevaluated the benefit of the non-rRNA-hexamers in VIDISCA. Furthermore, we evaluated\nwhether the choice of the restriction enzyme can decrease rRNA amplification.\nFinally, specific blocking of rRNA reverse transcription by rRNA recognizing\noligo's that contain a 3\u2032 dideoxy-C6 modification (which can not be\nextended), further inhibits cDNA synthesis of the target. All three steps to\ndecrease the effect of inhibitor rRNA are presented in this paper. Furthermore we\nmonitored the performance of the optimized amplification in a high throughput\nsequencing setting, by combining VIDISCA with Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium\nsequencing.\n\nEndoh and colleagues designed a mix of 96 hexamers that do not or hardly\ntarget rRNA but can amplify all known viruses by RT-PCR [8]. These\nnon-rRNA-hexamers were tested in VIDISCA by using a dilution range of human\nechovirus 18 culture supernatant (1 E8\u20131 E4 copies/ml), a virus\nharvest of which we established that it contains competitor rRNA. The cDNA\nwas produced either with normal hexamers (containing the 4096 variants) or\nnon-rRNA-hexamers. Viral sequences could be detected in samples with a\nconcentration of 1 E6 to 1 E8 viral genomic RNA copies/ml (see in figure 1A) in case\nnon-rRNA-hexamers are used in the RT reaction, whereas the sample that was\ntreated with the normal random hexamers was only positive in the highest\nconcentration (1 E8 copies/ml). Moreover, 3 viral fragments were amplified\nin the non-rRNA-hexamer amplification, whereas only 1 viral fragment was\namplified with the standard procedure (figure 1A). Figure 1B shows that the enhanced\nsensitivity is caused by reduced competitor rRNA amplification, since the\nPCR fragment that originates from rRNA is notably reduced (arrow in figure 1B).\n\nTo quantify the inhibition of rRNA amplification we performed various\nreal-time PCRs targeting cDNA of 28S rRNA and 18S rRNA using 2\nnasopharyngeal swabs (I and II) as input. Both samples contained high\nconcentrations of rRNA. The samples were reverse transcribed with either the\ncomplete set of hexamers or the non-rRNA-hexamers. With non-rRNA-hexamers\nsubstantially lower amounts of rRNA-derived cDNA was generated with on\naverage more than 1 log decrease, compared to the samples treated with\nrandom hexamers (see table\n1). We observed that the decreased cDNA synthesis on the\n3700-region of 28S rRNA and 1000-region of 18S rRNA was considerable\n(\u223c3,5 Ct = 1 log), however, not as strong as the\ndecrease at regions 40\u2013110 and 1780\u20131880 of 28S rRNA (almost 2\nlog decrease, table\n1). Inspecting the non-rRNA-hexamers revealed that this phenomenon\ncan be explained by residual priming by the non-rRNA-hexamers. Although the\nprimers are designed to anneal not or hardly to rRNA, some do perfectly\nmatch with human rRNA, especially in the region 3800 to 4000 (position 3803,\n3840, 4040), and the same for 18S rRNA region 1100 till 1200 (position 1121,\n1123, 1134, 1185, 1187, 1207). However, in the regions where we show strong\ndecrease in rRNA cDNA synthesis (40\u2013110 128S rRNA and 1780\u20131880\n18S rRNA), non-rRNA-hexamer can not anneal at the 3\u2032site at close\nvicinity (position 1613 and 2272 respectively). One might suggest expelling\nthe 8 hexamers that anneal at the abovementioned locations to further\nenhance the benefit of non-rRNA cDNA synthesis. However, Endoh et al\ndesigned the non-ribosomal hexamers such that amplification of viruses is\nnot hampered, therefore we recommend using all 96 Endoh-designed non-rRNA\nhexamers.\n\nTo check whether viral amplification is not hampered by using the\nnon-rRNA-hexamers for cDNA synthesis we performed real-time PCRs on cDNA of\nHCoV-NL63, echovirus 18, and human coxsackievirus A16 virus culture\nsupernatant. In all cases the cDNA synthesis with non-rRNA-hexamers occurs\nas efficient as normal hexamers, as no difference in virus specific real\ntime PCRs was noted (Table\n2). The same has been demonstrated by Endohet al\nfor SARS-CoV and bovine PIV-3 control viruses [8].\n\nThe original VIDSICA method described in 2004 is based on amplification after\ndigestion with 2 restriction enzymes (Hinp1-I and\nMseI) [6]. Investigation of\nhuman rRNAs revealed that 28S rRNA contains a very high number of\nHinp1-I recognition sites (85, see table 3), but relatively\nlow frequency of MseI restriction sites. The high frequency\nof HinP1-I digestion in 28S rRNA and the generation of a\nmassive amount of small digested fragments likely interferes in the\nVIDISCA-ligation. VIDISCA can also be performed with only one restriction\nenzyme, the only adaptation needed is the addition of 2 different adaptors\nthat both can ligate to MseI digested fragments. We checked\nour hypothesis by digesting coxsackievirus B4 culture supernatant with only\nMseI in comparison to the Hinp1-I/MseI\ncombination, and evaluated the efficiency of viral genome amplification in a\nsingle PCR. We observed a strongly reduced background amplification in case\nonly MseI was used in VIDISCA (Figure 2, dots all indicate viral\nfragments).\n\nTo improve the sensitivity of VIDISCA even further we designed\noligonucleotides to block amplification of ribosomal RNA. These\noligonucleotides were designed to anneal specifically to 18S and 28S rRNA\nand contain a 3\u2032 dideoxy C6 amino modification to inhibit the\nelongation and thus the amplification of rRNA-derived cDNA. These so called\nrRNA-blocking oligo's were designed on the most prevalent rRNA\nsequences retrieved from VIDISCA experiments with nasopharyngeal swabs. To\ntest the inhibitory capacity of the blocking oligo's we performed\nVIDISCA with a nasopharyngeal sample as input. Blocking oligo's were\nadded during reverse transcriptase reaction, and inhibition was observed\nwhen blocking oligo's were added (indicated as arrow in figure 3). Sequencing of\nthe inhibited PCR products confirmed that they were derived from rRNA\nindicating that the blocking oligo's can reduce the amplification of\nrRNA.\n\nIn addition we performed a real-time RT-PCR targeting 18S and 28S rRNA. As\ninput 2 nasopharyngeal samples were used (same samples that were used with\nthe non-rRNA annealing hexamers). We monitored cDNA synthesis via real time\nPCRs at 3 regions of 28S rRNA and 1 region of 18S rRNA. The choice for these\nregions to monitor the rRNA-cDNA reverse trancription efficiency was based\non the VIDISCA fragments of which we know that they are generated in VIDISCA\namplification. Three of the 4 regions are targeted by the rRNA-blocking\noligo's. On average a 50% reduction of rRNA amplification was\nnoticed at the regions that were targeted by the rRNA-blocking oligo's\n(see Table 1). Of\nnote, the reduction was not visible in the fragment that was not targeted by\na blocker (1780\u20131880 of 28S rRNA), which is as expected. One exception\nwas observed however. In sample II no diminished signal was observed at 18S\nrRNA 1000-region. This sample had extremely high concentrations of rRNA (Ct\nvalue 16), thus we investigated whether the rRNA-blocking oligo's would\nwork better in this sample when higher concentrations of the blockers were\nused. Indeed, with 25 \u00b5M and 50 \u00b5M a decrease in signal was\nnoted (36.9% decrease and 70.1% decrease, respectively)\nindicating that in some samples a concentration of 10 \u00b5M might be\nsuboptimal. However, to diminish the chance of unspecific blocking of viral\nRNA, we prefer the 10 \u00b5M concentration of rRNA-blocking oligo's.\nWith this concentration we observed no decrease in cDNA synthesis on\nHCoV-NL63 and coxsackievirus B4 (measured by real-time RT-PCR, (table 4) ).\n\nIn figure 1 it is shown that\nthe sensitivity of VIDISCA reaches 1 E6 viral genome copies/ml. Although this is\nan improvement, this detection limit might be too low to detect viruses directly\nin clinical samples. The concentration of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal\nswabs is in the main below 1 E6 copies/ml, and we can assume that a yet unknown\nvirus will be present in similar concentrations. Thus additional improvement of\nthe VIDISCA-sensitivity is needed. High throughput sequencing is a relatively\nnew method allowing millions of nucleotides to be sequenced in only one run\n(pyrosequencing). One of these devices is the 454 FLX/Titanium system of Roche\nwhich can generate over 1.000.000 DNA fragments of approximately 500 nucleotides\nper run. By generating thousands of clonal amplified sequences from a single\nsample, a viral minority can be detected. The VIDISCA technique can easily be\nadapted for 454-FLX sequencing (VIDISCA-454 method). The anchors that are\nligated to the digested fragment can be designed to contain the \u201cA\u201d\nand \u201cB\u201d primer sequence that are needed for clonal amplification in\nan emulsion PCR to be used as input for 454 FLX sequencing.\n\nHowever, VIDISCA-454 only becomes cost-effective in case a few thousand sequences\nare sufficient for virus detection, as one 454 plate can then be used to analyze\n56 samples (roughly 200 \u20ac per sample). In that view VIDISCA-454 benefits\nstrongly from the aforementioned reduction in rRNA amplification since fewer\nsequences are needed to detect a viral sequence.\n\nWe monitored the efficiency of VIDISCA-454 in 18 nasopharyngeal swabs that\ncontain known viruses. Only one third of a 454 picotiterplate was used, to check\nwhether indeed a few thousand sequences are enough for virus detection. Samples\nwere selected randomly from a large sample set collected during the GRACE study,\na large EU financed study on acute cough and antibiotic use in adults. The 18\nsamples were assigned positive via specific diagnostic PCRs, but supplied to us\ndouble blind to ensure unbiased sequence analyses. Each sample was processed\nwith its own identifier sequence that allows pooling during emulsion PCR.\nVIDISCA-454 products were visualized on agarose gel and fragments were cut from\ngel at different size regions (200\u2013300,\n300\u2013500 and 500\u2013700 bp). Samples were run on\n1.3 regions of a 4 regions Picotiterplate for the 454 Titanium system (per\nregion 14 MID tagged samples were pooled) and processed according to the small\nvolume emulsion PCR. In total 202.975 reads were generated of which 4406 were\nviral (2.2%). In 11 out of 18 samples viral sequences could be identified\nwhich all matched with the respiratory virus that was found in diagnostic PCRs\n(Table 5). The\nfrequency of viral sequences per sample ranged between 0.01% and\n40.5% (Table 5).\nThe median viral load in the VIDISCA-454 positive samples was 7.2 E5 viral\ngenome copies/ml (ranging from 1.4 E3\u20137.6 E6 genome copies/ml). Detection\nwas correlated to input viral load since the very low load samples remained\nnegative in VIDISCA-454 (median viral genome concentration in VIDISCA-negative\nsamples 3.5 E3; range 6.0 E2\u20131.1 E5). For most VIDISCA-454 positive\nsamples large genome coverage was observed, see table 5.\n\nNowadays molecular techniques are becoming the standard for the discovery of new\nviruses. Some methods use a conserved region for universal primer design, based on\nthe known viral genomes [9]\u2013[11]. These methods are applicable to specific virus families,\nbut cannot be used for all viruses. Furthermore, some yet unknown viruses could be\ntoo diverse and therefore remain negative in these kind of detection techniques\n[7]. Sequence\nindependent amplification methods, such as VIDISCA and random-PCR, can identify\nviral sequences without prior knowledge of a viral genome. Unfortunately, the\ndetection of unknown viral pathogens in respiratory clinical material is difficult\nwith these sequence independent virus discovery methods because of low viral load\nand high background nucleic acids in these samples. During the last years sequence\nindependent virus discovery techniques were mostly used with virus culture\nsupernatant, as they contain high concentrations of viral genomes [6], [12], or to\ndiscover previously unknown DNA viruses [13]\u2013[15]. So far no study has been able\nto identify novel human respiratory RNA viruses with sequence independent\namplification techniques. Thus sequence independent amplification techniques like\nVIDISCA have to be optimized to allow discovery without requiring a culture\namplification step.\n\nIn the current study we increased the sensitivity of VIDISCA by 1) reducing\nbackground rRNA amplification, and 2) by increasing the number of sequences obtained\nfrom a sample. We managed to unfavor rRNA amplification by adjusting the reverse\ntranscription step. Utilization of primers during cDNA synthesis that poorly\nrecognize rRNA, in combination with the addition of oligo's that halt cDNA\nsynthesis on rRNA templates successfully decreased interfering background\namplification. Additionally, using a single restriction enzyme with low numbers of\nrecognition sites in 28S rRNA provided further reduction of useless and interfering\namplification. Thus all steps increased the ratio of viral genome versus rRNA\namplifications, and the benefit was shown in VIDISCA-high throughput sequencing of\nclinical samples containing known viruses. In the majority of clinical samples the\nvirus was easily identified by VIDISCA-454 (11 of 18). In two cases even an input of\n140 and 190 genome copies of an adenovirus and influenza A virus could be detected\nby VIDISCA-454. Ideally, old-protocol VIDISCA-454 (two restriction enzymes, random\nhexamers and no rRNA-blocking oligo's) should have been compared with optimized\nVIDISCA-454. However, this comparison is regrettably not possible due to limitation\nof the respiratory clinical specimens that we used. Thus we rely on all the\nreconstructions and monitoring performed with normal VIDISCA.\n\nAs mentioned above, the use of one restriction enzyme (MseI)\ndiminished background rRNA amplification. There is one additional advantage of\nsingle restriction enzyme usage. In the traditional VIDISCA two restriction enzymes\nwere combined (MseI and HinP1-I) and only\nfragments that have one restriction site on the 5\u2032 site and the other in the\n3\u2032 site are amplified after ligation. Such VIDISCA amplification is restricted\nin case one of the two enzymes has few recognition sites, or when the position of\nthe sites is not optimal (too far or too close from each other). By using only one\nrestriction enzyme, large parts of the genome would be divided in amplifiable\nproducts, provided that the fragment size is between 50 and 600 bp. In case of\nsingle restriction enzyme digestion, both anchors can potentially ligate to both\nMseI generated sticky end but only AB or BA containing\nfragments can be used for sequencing. This might give the suggestion that 50%\nof the VIDISCA products are ineffective as they contain the same adaptor (AA and\nBB). However, the fragments containing 2 different primers are preferentially\namplified in the PCR, since an AA or BB fragment has a disadvantage that 5\u2032\nand 3\u2032 ends anneal to each other which interferes with primer annealing. We\ndefinitely observed the higher chance of amplification of several genome segments\nwhen only one restriction site is used. Remarkably high genome coverage was noted in\nseveral samples (reaching >70% for the samples containing RSV and\nHCoV-OC43), a coverage which could never be achieved in case two restriction enzymes\nwere used in amplifications.\n\nOther groups have used high throughput sequencing for virus discovery as well. In one\npaper the viral community in an Antarctic lake was described [16]. Lopez-Bueno et\nal. collected water in spring and late summer from a fresh water lake\n(Limnopolar lake) in Antarctica and used high throughput sequencing to study the\nviral community in a location hardly visited by larger eukaryotes. For the first\ntime a large amount of sequence data was retrieved from this isolated place which\nled to the identification of at least 12 viral families of which two are claimed to\nrepresent new families. Their results show the enormous possibilities for virus\ndiscovery and high throughput sequencing. The authors also address a large amount of\nunknown sequences present in their data set. We also observed the presence of\nunknown sequences within our data set. It could be that these sequences are derived\nfrom yet unknown viruses, or it could be that the sequences are part of a genomic\nsequence from a known organism, e.g. a bacterium of which not the complete genomic\nsequence is present in the Genbank databases. Thus care should be taken to assign\nsequences as potentially viral, since so many organisms have not been fully\nsequenced.\n\nThere are several advantages of high throughput sequencing in comparison to BigDye\nterminator sequencing. First of all, with high throughput sequencing and pooling of\nsamples that carry their own recognition sequence the VIDISCA cost per sample is\nreduced, since selective VIDISCA-PCR, metaphor agarose gel visualization,\npurification of fragments from gel, TA cloning, colony PCR and subsequent BigDye\nsequencing can all be omitted. Secondly, the amount of sequence data received from a\nsingle sample is higher than what can be achieved in standard VIDSCA, thus\nincreasing the chances of identifying an unknown virus. This method opens new\nopportunities for virus discovery, not only in respiratory samples of undiagnosed\nrespiratory infection, but also in diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n(ALS), Kawasaki disease (KD) and Multiple sclerosis (MS). For these syndromes a\nviral pathogen has been suggested [17]\u2013[19] but could not be confirmed so far. With VIDISCA-454 it is\nnow possible to investigate samples from these patients for unknown viruses.\n\nPatients were randomly chosen from the large European EU-financed GRACE study\n(https://www.grace-lrti.org). Ethics review committees in each\ncountry approved the study, Cardiff and Southampton (United Kingdom):\nSouthampton & South West Hampshire Research Ethics Committee A; Utrecht\n(Netherlands) Medisch Ethische Toetsingscommissie Universitair Medisch Centrum\nUtrecht; Barcelona (Spain) Comit\u00e8 \u00e8tic d'investigaci\u00f3\ncl\u00ednica Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona; Mataro (Spain):\nComit\u00e8 d'\u00c8tica d'Investigaci\u00f3 Cl\u00ednica\n(CEIC) del Consorci Sanitari del Maresme; Rotenburg (Germany) Ethik-Kommission\nder Medizinischen Fakult\u00e4t der Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t\nG\u00f6ttingen, Antwerpen (Belgium): UZ Antwerpen Comit\u00e9 voor Medische\nEthiek; Lodz, Szeczecin, and Bialystok (Poland): Komisja Bioetyki Uniwersytetu\nMedycznego W Lodzi; Milano (Italy) IRCCS Fondazione C\u00e0 Granda\nPoliclinico; Jonkoping (Sweden): Regionala etikpr\u00f6vningsn\u00e4mnden i\nLink\u00f6ping; Bratislava (Slovakia): Etika Komisia Bratislavskeho; Gent\n(Belgium): Ethisch Comit\u00e9 Universitair Ziekenhuis Gent; Nice (France)\nComit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes Sud-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e II,\nH\u00f4pital Salvator; Jesenice (Slovenia): Komisija Republike Slovenije za\nMedicinsko Etiko. Written informed consent was provided by all study\nparticipants.\n\nHCoV-NL63, echovirus 18, human coxsackievirus A16 and human coxsackievirus B4\nwere cultured on an epithelial monkey kidney cell line (LLC-MK2 [6]) in MEM\nHank's/Earle's (2\u22361) medium (Invitrogen) with 3%\ninactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Cambrex Bio Science). Both media were\nsupplemented with penicillin (0.1 mg/ml) and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) (Duchefa\nBiochemie). Viruses were harvested on day 2 except human coronavirus NL63\n(HCoV-NL63) which was harvested at day 7.\n\nDuring the GRACE study, a large EU financed study on acute cough and antibiotic\nuse in adults consulting their general practitioner, flocked nasopharyngeal\nswabs (Copan) in universal transport medium (UTM) were collected from all\npatients. Eighteen of these nasopharyngeal specimens were randomly selected\n(double blind) and included in this study and proven positive by specific\ndiagnostic PCR's for either human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial\nvirus (RSV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), HCoV-NL63, Influenzavirus A,\nInfluenzavirus B, parainfluenzavirus 3 (PIV3) or adenovirus. The diagnostics for\nthe respiratory viruses were determined by in-house multiplex real-time PCR\nassays [20]\u2013[22], all primers and probes\nare available on request. Viral loads were determined by virus-specific\nquantative real time PCRs using standard curves based on plasmids containing the\nvirus sequence of interest (details available on request).\n\nNucleid acids were extracted by Boom isolation [23]. Elution of nucleic acids was\nperformed in sterile H2O or in 10 \u00b5M of rRNA-blocking\noligonucleotides (2 \u00b5M each, see below). The reverse transcription was\nperformed as described [6] with the adjustment that in some cases 25 ng of random\nhexamers (Amersham Biosciences) or non-ribosomal hexamers were used. Enterovirus\nreal-time PCR was performed to quantify the efficiency of echovirus 18, human\ncoxsackievirus A16 and human coxsackievirus B4 reverse transcription reactions,\nwhereas a specific HCoV-NL63 real time PCR was performed to quantify the\nHCoV-NL63 reverse transcription efficiency [24], [25]. Ribosomal RNA real time PCR\nwas performed with the primers below, and the Quantifast SYBR Green PCR kit\n(Qiagen). Real-time PCR with primerset 5/6 was additionally run with a probe\n(rRNA28S_3674 5\u2032-FAM-GGGTGTTGACGCGATGTGATTTCT-TAMRA-3\u2032) and\nthe platinum quantitative PCR Supermix-UDG system (Invitrogen).\n\nVIDISCA was performed as described with some adaptations [6]. In short, cell debris\nand mitochondria were removed by centrifugation and residual DNA was degraded\nwith 20 U TURBO\u2122 DNase (Ambion). Nucleic acid isolation was performed as\ndescribed by Boom et al.[23], elution in H2O\nwith or without 10 \u00b5M rRNA-blocking oligonucleotides:\n\nReverse transcription was performed with 2.5 \u00b5g of random hexamers\n(Amersham Biosciences) or 2.5 \u00b5g non-ribosomal hexamers [8] and 200 U of\nMoloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase enzyme (Invitrogen). After\nthe RT reaction, second strand synthesis was performed with 5 U Klenow frament\n(3\u2032 - 5\u2032 exo-) (Westburg) and 7.5 U of RNase H (Amersham) followed\nby a phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The digestion was\nperformed for 2h at 37\u00b0C by 10 U of HinP1-I (New England\nBiolabs) and 10U of MseI (New England Biolabs) restriction\nenzymes or only by 10U of MseI (New England Biolabs). Ligation\nof MSE and HINP anchors was performed as described [6]. In case of single\nMseI digestion a 2nd MSE anchor was added\n(MID1-top-A 5\u2032-GCCTCCCTCICGCCATCAGACGAGTGCGTA-3\u2032;\nMID1-bottom-A 5\u2032-TATACGCACTCGTCTGATGGCGCGAGGGAGGC-3\u2032; Top-B\n5\u2032-\nGCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGA-3\u2032; Bottom-B 5\u2032-TATCTGAGCGGGCTGGCAAGGC-3\u2032). The first round of\nPCR amplification was performed with primers annealing to the anchors and covers\n20 cycles, or 45 cycles in case only a single PCR was used. A second PCR was\nused to enhance the signal using primers that are extended at the 3\u2032 with\none nucleotide (either A, T, C, or G) so a total of 16 primer combinations. PCR\nfragments were visualized on 3% metaphor agarose gels (Cambrex),\nfragments of interest were cut from gel, purified with NucleoSpin\u00ae Extract\nII (Macherey-Nagel), cloned using TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced\nwith BidDye terminator reagents (Applied Biosystems). Data analysis was\nconducted with CodonCode Aligner software and BLAST.\n\nVIDISCA was performed as described above with minor changes (Figure 4). Reverse transcription was\nperformed with Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) in a mixture containing E.coli\nligase (5 U, Invitrogen). The anchor ligation was performed with anchors, based\non primer A with an identifier sequence (MIDs of 10 nt see GS FLX Shotgun DNA\nLibrary Preparation Method Manual) and 1 anchor containing primer B. In total 14\ndifferent identifier sequences were used, allowing 14 samples to be pooled.\nAmplification in a single PCR was performed with 0.4 \u00b5M of primer A-MID\n(5\u2032- CGTATCGCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAG\n-3\u2032) and 0.4 \u00b5M of primer B (5\u2032- CTATGCGCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAG\n-3\u2032) with the following thermo-cycling profile: 1\ncycle of 94\u00b0C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 60 s, 55\u00b0C for 60 s\nand 72\u00b0C for 2 min, and 1 cycle of 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Of each sample 15\n\u00b5l of product was loaded on a 1% agarose gel and 3 size regions\nwere cut from gel: 200\u2013300 bp, 300\u2013500 bp and 500\u2013700. Each\nsize region was purified with NucleoSpin\u00ae Extract II (Macherey-Nagel). DNA\nwas quantified with the Quant-iT\u2122 dsDNA Assay Kit on a Qubit\nfluorometer (Invitrogen). Emulsion PCR was performed according to the suppliers\nprotocol (LIB-A SV emPCR kit, GS FLX Titanium PicoTiterPlate kit (70\u00d775),\nGS FLX Titanium XLR 70 Sequencing kit (Roche)). Each emulsion PCR amplifies\nfragments of 14 different samples. Samples were run on a 4 regions\nPicotiterplate for the 454 Titanium system (per region 14 samples were run) and\nprocessed according to the emulsion small volume PCR protocol with 2 E6 beads\nper emulsion as input and 4 small volume emulsions per region (direct titration\nprotocol). Sequence reads were assembled using the CodonCode software (www.codoncode.com) and the search for viral sequences was\nperformed with the Blast tool of Genbank."}
