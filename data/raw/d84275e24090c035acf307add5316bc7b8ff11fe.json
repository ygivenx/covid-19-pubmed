{"title": "Long-term persistence of donor alveolar macrophages in human lung transplant recipients that influences donor specific immune responses HHS Public Access", "body": "Tissue resident macrophages (TRM) represent distinct cell populations in terms of phenotype and function (1, 2) . Despite heterogeneity, TRM are adapted to their tissue of residence and participate in various tissue specific immunologic and physiologic functions (3) . The requirement at lung microenvironment is unique, as during gas exchange the respiratory surface to be protected from potential airborne infectious and polluting agents. Alveolar macrophages (AM) and interstitial macrophages (IM) are two recognized lung TRM that respectively constitute 80% and 20% of lung resident macrophage pool. Further, vast majority of AM occur in the lumen of alveoli and bronchioles, and comprise up to 95% of the leukocytes present in mouse bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) under steady state (4) . Mature mouse lungs contain up to 3\u00d710 6 AM while that of humans contain up to 6\u00d710 9 AM (5) . AM are professional phagocytes and have been implicated in homeostatic maintenance of the respiratory surface, and airway immunity and inflammation (1) . Furthermore, AM are stationary cells and are found attached to the alveolar epithelium during steady state as well as inflammatory challenges (6) . A selective loss of AM results in lung failure, fatal hypoxia, severe morbidity and mortality due to viral infections (7) . Functional impairment of AM has been linked to pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (8) . While role of AM in gaseous exchange and immune surveillance at respiratory interface has been recognized, cellular origin, persistence and/or turnover rates of AM particularly following lung transplantation (LTx) remains undefined. AM were earlier considered as a component of the lung mononuclear phagocytic system with circulating monocytes as central precursor for AM differentiation and replenishment (9, 10) . A number of recent studies have examined the progenitors and phenotypes of mature TRM (reviewed in (3, 11, 12) ). Opposed to the earlier held view, TRM including AM (and Kupffer cells, microglia, Langerhans cells, cardiac macrophages and osteoclasts) have prenatal origins from yolk-sac erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMP) (4, (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . These studies have demonstrated a negligible contribution by bone marrow (BM) derived monocytes in AM recruitment and sustenance. Further, development and differentiation of AM from EMP requires both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic signals and is granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma dependent (2, 4, 15) . AM are long-lived TRM and locally maintained independent of replenishment by BM cells (4, 18) . In this background, we evaluated AM persistence following human LTx. Though, LTx remains as the viable treatment option for various end-stage lung diseases, >50% of lung allografts undergo chronic rejection in the first five years post-transplantation, clinically diagnosed as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Development of immune responses to mismatched donor HLA and immune responses directed to lung-associated self-antigens are significant risk factors for development of BOS (19) (20) (21) (22) . Studies have demonstrated that depletion of donor specific antibody (DSA) as well as Abs to lung-associated self-antigens lowers the hazard ratio for the development of BOS (23) (24) (25) (26) . In view of poor long-term success following human LTx, we postulated that post-LTx persistence of donor AM can influence immunologic responses directed to donor antigens.\n\nHuman LTx recipients (LTxR) that underwent bilateral LTx at Barnes Jewish Hospital/ Washington University School of Medicine were enrolled in the study. The LTxR gave informed consent and Washington University Institutional Review Board approved the studies. Recipient and donor HLA phenotypes and DSA status were obtained from histocompatibility laboratories. Cells were isolated by centrifugation of BAL fluid at 500xg for 10min at 4\u00b0C and AM were identified by flow cytometry. For AM isolation, stained live cells were sorted by a BD FACS Aria II cell sorter and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 20% L-929 culture supernatant.\n\nIsolated AM were stimulated either with toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (Human TLR 1-9 agonists, InvivoGen) or 2 phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin or mAb to framework-HLA (W6/32) or isotype control (C. 1.18.4) . Culture supernatants were analyzed by a 25-Plex Human Cytokine/Chemokine luminex Panel (ThermoFisher Scientific). AM endocytosis was accessed by incubation with pH sensitive pHrodoRed dextran beads and analyzed by EVOS FL Cell Imaging System (ThermoFisher Scientific).\n\nWild-type C57BL/6 (H-2K b ) and Balb/c (H-2K d ) mice (6-8 wks, male) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. C57BL/6 mice that express H-2K d transgene on macrophages (huCD68-K d Tg C57BL/6) were described earlier (27) . All animals were maintained at Washington University School of Medicine according to institutional guidelines and approved protocols. Mice were anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine, lungs perfused with 1\u00d710 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) via right ventricle and BAL collected via a 22G catheter installed into trachea followed by 5\u00d71 mL washes with icechilled PBS supplemented with 0.5mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. BAL cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 250xg for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. For reconstitution studies, AM (CD11c+ and Siglec-F+ BAL cells) were flow sorted and administered intrabronchially. Since our average yield was 6\u00d710 5 AM (10 wk, male), we transferred 4\u00d710 5 AM/mouse at a harvestable ratio of 60:40. Lung tissue was fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded and sectioned for pathologic evaluations by H&E and Trichrome staining.\n\nElicitation of H-2K d specific Abs in BAL and serum following AM reconstitution were evaluated by staining mouse T cells (CD4+ T cell isolation kit, Stemcell Technologies) by BD FACSCanto II cell analyzer. Enumeration of H-2K d and H-2K b reactive T cells was conducted by stimulating splenocytes from recipient mice at 16 wk post AM-transfer with irradiated (30Gy) T cells from Balb/c and C57BL/6 respectively in ELISPOT assays (BD Biosciences).\n\nDetection of mouse de novo Abs to lung-associated Ags (K\u03b11Tubulin (K\u03b11T) and Collagen V (Col V)) was conducted by an ELISA assay detailed in our previous publication (28) . Briefly, wells were coated with recombinant Col V or K\u03b11T proteins (100ng/well) and quantitation of the specific Abs in serum was done by probing with HRP conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Analysis of donor specific HLA Abs, and Col V or K\u03b11T auto-Abs in LTx patient sera were earlier described (29) . Enumeration of lung infiltrating K\u03b11T and Col V specific Th1 and Th17 cells was conducted by quantifying cytokine (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A) secreting T cells in ELISPOT assays following our optimized protocol (28) .\n\nWe enrolled15 human LTxR that received first-time bilateral lung transplant where the HLA mismatches between the lung donor and LTxR encompassed at least one of the HLA-A2 or HLA-A3 allele. In this cohort, donor and recipient mismatched at >1 HLA-A locus that was correlated with development de novo DSA ( Table 1 ). All of the subjects underwent an Ab directed immunosuppressive regimen following which DSA was resolved in 40% (6/15) of LTxR. Additionally, K\u03b11T and Col V specific Ab were detected at varying levels. Clinical history included at least one episode of acute rejection and 12 out of 15 (~70%) LTxR developed BOS.\n\nUntil recently, lack of a definitive identification and characterization of AM was the major impediment to fully understand role of AM in fibrosis, immunity and inflammation of the lungs. Studies by Misharin et al. (30) , and Yu et al. Figure 1 ). This analysis eliminated lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and other granulocytes that occur in clinical BAL samples. Furthermore, it allowed us to distinguish between AM from donor or recipient origin by differential HLA staining between LTxR and graft donor. Relative composition of the AM in BAL cells is presented ( Table 2 ). Based on the above morphometric and phenotypic characteristics, AM constituted 6.87% of the total BAL cells isolated from human LTxR ( Table 2 ) with 97% purity (Figure 1 ). In the LTxR cohort, donor and recipient HLA mismatches were either HLA-A2 or HLA-A3 (Table 1) . We analyzed BAL samples encompassing three possible donor\u2192recipient combinations i.e. A2/A3\u2192A3/A2 (P1-P4), A2/A3\u2192X (P5-P10) and X\u2192A2/A3 (P11-P15) where X being a non-HLA-A2 or non-HLA-A3 allele). The analyzed BAL samples ranged between 302 to 1265 days post-LTx. Vast majority (94-100%) of identifiable AM in BAL cells from A2/ A3\u2192A3/A2 group were positive for the donor-HLA ( Figure 2 ). Significantly, no AM carrying unique recipient HLA-A were detected. Further, in A2/A3\u2192X group, 87-97% of the total AM population was positive for donor HLA. Likewise, we did not detect any AM in X\u2192A2/A3 group that expressed recipient HLA. Since our probes encompassed markers for both donor and recipient HLA in A2/A3\u2192A3/A2, it was feasible to assess donor vs recipient contributions into the AM pool. Significantly, majority of AM in A2/A3\u2192A3/A2 group were donor derived with no detectable contribution from the recipient. The two other groups (A2/A3\u2192X and X\u2192A2/A3) allowed us to estimate, respectively, the persistence of donor AM and their replacement by cells of recipient origin. Since MHC class I is ubiquitously expressed on nucleated cells and clone BB7.2 (anti-HLA-A2) and clone GAP.A3 (anti-HLA-A3) have no known cross-reactivity, we chose to focus on these two HLA-A locus mismatches. Collectively, in our experimental settings, a significant proportion (>87%) of detectable AM were donor derived indicating a long-term persistence of AM without being replaced by recipient's cells up to 3.5 years post-LTx ( Figure 2 ).\n\nWe next determined post-LTx AM responses to various inflammatory stimuli (TLR ligands) and donor specific HLA Abs. We used highly purified (>99%) AM isolated via flow sorting to determine their responsiveness to a panel of human TLR agonists, mitogen (PMA +Ionomycin) and Abs (anti-HLA and isotype control). Cytokine production was expressed as fold increase in stimulated cells over that of unstimulated cells. Overall, AM responded to stimuli, albeit, differentially in range and magnitude ( Figure 3 ). The stimuli mimicked infections by virus, gram positive and negative bacteria, and induced status of an intracellular infection. An up-regulation in inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF\u03b1 were prominent. Additionally, chemokines including macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2), RANTES, IP-10 and MIG involved in chemotaxis of T cell and other inflammatory cells were also elicited. These cytokine/ chemokine signatures are part of a broader immune response by cells including but not limited to macrophages and indicate a preservation of AM responsiveness to various infectious and inflammatory stimuli during post-LTx period. Furthermore, TLR stimuli induced IL-8 (a macrophage produced chemokine important in neutrophil recruitment and degranulation) up to 9.3 fold (Table S1 ). By contrast, as expected, the cytokine signature lacked any T cell specific cytokines (IL-2 and IFN\u03b3) indicating an absence of contaminating T cells in the AM purification protocol. The most striking finding was the AM responsiveness to anti-HLA. W6/32 induced a unique signature with stimulation of IL-1\u03b2 (19.47 fold), IL-6 (4.86 fold), IL-12 (8.48 fold), RANTES (4.31 fold), MIP-1\u03b1 (3 fold), MIP-1\u03b2 (3.3 fold), MCP-1 (3 fold), TNF\u03b1 (2.75 fold) and MIG (1.88 fold) over that of isotype control ( Figure 3A ). Importantly, W6/32 also induced IL-8 >3 fold compared to isotype treatment (Table S1 ). Taken together, our data demonstrate that donor AM purified from the BAL following LTx are not only able to respond to infections but also react to MHC ligation with Abs resulting in secretion of inflammatory cytokines.\n\nWe then assessed AM endocytosis by pH sensitive dextran beads. The beads following internalization into acidic endosomal and lysosomal compartments fluoresce that allowed their detection. Following a 20-min pulsing, >95% of AM ( Figure 3B ) demonstrated bead uptake indicating preservation of particle endocytosis in post-LTx AM.\n\nThe murine AM in BAL cells were identified by being CD45+, CD11c+ and Siglec-F+ ( Figure 4A ). We utilized a novel huCD68-K d Tg C57BL/6 mouse, which expresses a full length H-2K d transgene in C57BL/6 macrophages (27) to evaluate AM reconstitution. Nearly all (~98%) of AM from huCD68-Kd Tg expressed both H-2K d and H-2K b ( Figure  4A ). This unique expression of surface H-2K d transgene in huCD68-K d Tg AM enabled us to examine effect of AM restricted donor specific MHC mismatches in elicitation of donor specific alloimmunity. We evaluated whether transfer of huCD68-Kd Tg (Tg) AM into C57BL/6 (B6) recipient will induce H-2K d specific immune responses. In parallel, we also carried out allogeneic transfer of B6 AM into Tg recipients and syngeneic transfer of Tg AM into Tg recipients, and transfer of B6 AM into B6 recipients. Development of H-2K d (alloantigen) reactive lung-resident T cells ( Figure 4B ) and alloAbs in BAL fluid and serum ( Figure 4C ) were analyzed. Adoptive transfer of Tg into B6 stimulated alloantigen specific T cell responses and elicited detectable H-2K d Abs both in BAL fluid as well as in serum. Since the donor AM expressed H-2K d as a transgene, it is being recognized as a foreign antigen. It is important to note that both the AM donors (huCD68-K d Tg) and recipients (C57BL/6) had identical MHC class II (I-A b ). Therefore the donor AM was capable of priming I-A b restricted H-2K d reactive CD4 T cells. Further, the engrafted AM expressed equivalent levels of surface MHC II present on native AM indicating an optimal antigen presentation ability ( Figure 4D ). Taken together, demonstration of H-2K d specific Ab and T cell responses suggest that mismatched MHC I antigen on AM is sufficient to elicit donor specific immune responses.\n\nWe have earlier developed a murine obliterative airway disease model where administrations of exogenous MHC Ab into native lungs induce bronchiolitis, a clinical correlate of human BOS (33, 34) . In the present study of AM transfer model, we evaluated pathologic effect of de novo DSA on small airway obstruction and fibrosis. Increased peribronchiolar leukocyte clusters, and greater epithelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia were evident in Tg\u2192B6 compared to B6\u2192Tg group ( Figure 5A ). Additionally, higher depositions of collagenous extracellular matrix proteins and higher occurrence of small airway obstruction in Tg\u2192B6 mice indicated a respiratory impairment. Histopathology assessment for the AM transfer groups is presented in Figure 5B and allogeneic AM transfer (Tg\u2192B6) that stimulated DSA resulted in a significant loss of bronchiolar architecture with concomitant increase in small airway inflammation and obstruction.\n\nIn the view of Tg\u2192B6 eliciting de novo DSA ( Figure 4 ) and bronchiolar obstruction ( Figure   5 ), we examined stimulation of lung-associated self-antigen (K\u03b11T and Col V) specific autoimmunity following AM transfer. Mean serum titers for anti-K\u03b11T and anti-Col V in Tg\u2192B6 AM transfer mice were 105 \u03bcg/mL and 183 \u03bcg/mL respectively and were significantly higher than that in other transfer groups measured at <40 \u03bcg/mL ( Figure 6A ). Furthermore, Tg\u2192B6 stimulated significantly greater K\u03b11T and Col V reactive IL-17 and IFN\u03b3 secreting T cells ( Figure 6B ). The mean K\u03b11T specific IL-17 and IFN\u03b3 secreting T cells were 75 and 55 (spots/10 6 cells) respectively while those of Col V reactive T cells were 97 and 84 (spots/10 6 cells) respectively. The self-antigen reactive T cells in other AM transfer groups remained <20 spots/10 6 cells. Taken together, stimulation of T cells and development of Abs directed to lung-associated antigens indicate that MHC I mismatched AM were sufficient to induce humoral and cellular immune responses to lung-associated self-antigens.\n\nDespite improvements in surgical techniques and post-operative care, incidence of BOS continues to be the primary obstacle in long-term success of LTx (35) . Development of de novo DSA to mismatched donor HLA and Ab to lung-associated self-antigens are considered major risk factors for BOS development (20, 36, 37) . Role of AM in DSA induced lung inflammation and BOS is largely unknown. This is partly due to lack of a uniform experimental approach and definitive AM characterization. AM are terminally differentiated TRM and express distinctive surface markers compared to other tissue resident and circulatory macrophages (3). The recently described flow cytometric analyses (30) (31) (32) allow unambiguous identification of human and mouse AM and enable them to be distinguished from \"passenger leukocytes\". It is generally believed that recipient stem cells seed the transplanted organ, and endothelial cells and macrophages repopulate the graft with potential to minimize host immune detection (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) . However, the dichotomy of immunologic complications and poor prognosis associated with LTx intrigued us to investigate post-LTx persistence of donor AM and its contribution to chronic rejection. AM are the major lung TRM and constitute professional phagocytes at blood-air interface (47) . We, for the first time, demonstrate that donor AM persist following LTx for a long period (up to 3.5 yr) and respond to HLA specific Ab resulting in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This finding has two-fold implications. First, long-term survival of donor AM (bearing donor-HLA) in transplanted lungs may serve as a repository of mismatched HLA antigens. Second, our finding demonstrating pro-inflammatory responsiveness of AM to MHC ligation indicate a putative role for AM in mediating DSA induced pathogenesis. Our findings of a long-term sustenance of AM following human LTx and our inability to detect recipient derived cellular chimerism in AM compartment is in contrast to earlier published studies (39, 40, 44, 48) . The disagreement is due to differences in experimental methods and target cells studied. For example, report by Kjellstr\u00f6m et al. (40) used DNA microsatellite described a rapid turnover of donor CD14+ BAL cells. By lineage analysis, human AM lack CD14 expression while monocytes are CD14+ (31, 49, 50) . The study by Judson et al. (39) analyzed pleural cell chimerism primarily in unilateral LTx patients. Cellular composition in pleural lavage fluid includes lymphoid and myeloid cells (51) but lacks AM. Nakata et al. (44) and Kennedy et al. (48) while studying reconstitution and proliferation of BAL cells following BM transplantation (BMT) reported appearance of BM derived AM in BAL around 60 days post-BMT. These authors based their conclusions on lymphocyte-depleted monocytes and macrophages but not on purified AM following irradiation and BMT. Therefore, due to lack of a consistent analysis on AM, it is difficult to interpret these results in recipient AM reconstitution. Our approach to identify AM is based on surface markers that enabled us to distinguish the AM from IM, monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes and other granulocytes (30) (31) (32) . In addition, using HLA allele we are able to identify AM as either of donor or recipient origin. Until recently, AM have been consistently misidentified and misrepresented with regards to their phenotype and lineage specificity. Recent studies have concluded that yolk-sac derived fetal monocyte but not circulating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) derived monocyte is precursor for AM development (4, 15) . Genetic reconstitution and parabiosis experiments have also confirmed that circulating monocytes minimally contribute to the homeostatic AM pool (4, 15, 16, 52) . Further, constitutive and inducible fate mapping of embryonic cells indicated that yolk-sac EMPs accumulated in fetal liver give rise to AM while HSC driven hematopoiesis minimally replaced the AM compartment (13) . Moreover, transplantation of fetal liver cells following AM depletion by clodronate liposomes or lethal irradiation resulted in an efficient reconstitution of AM cells (53) . IM, on the other hand, are blood monocyte derived and demonstrate a high turnover rate (54) . The impact of an ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) associated with LTx on AM is currently unknown. In a rat LTx model, viable AM were isolated from BAL cells following transplantation suggesting a minimal effect of IRI, if any, on AM survival (55) . Though we did not specifically test the influence of IRI on AM in this study, our results suggest that human AM endured IRI stress and persisted up to 3.5 years post-LTx. While in experimental models a long-term replacement of steady state AM by HSC cells was negligible, a slow (~1yr) and partial (~40-48%) turnover of AM has been reported in BMT following myeloablative irradiation (18, 48) , infection with influenza virus (56), high dose endotoxin challenge (57) and due to old age (13) that depleted the homeostatic AM pool. It remains unclear though the phenotypic and transcriptional differences between yolk-sac derived native AM and neo-differentiated AM from BM hematopoiesis. Our cohort of LTxR received no irradiation treatment and remained free from a documented viral infection during the follow-up period. So existence of a negative pressure on donor AM survival was unlikely. Further, donor AM responded to TLR agonists and MHC ligation. Responsiveness to TLR stimuli indicates AM's functional preservation as \"first line of innate defense\" at respiratory interface (50) . Further, we demonstrate inflammatory responses by donor AM following MHC I ligation, which is in agreement with the reported dominant role for donor endothelial cells in anti-HLA induced inflammation (58) . In addition, we conclusively demonstrated that the donor AM in an ex vivo assay stimulated inflammatory cytokines in response to anti-HLA. Extracorporeal removal of DSA has been shown to reduce inflammatory cytokines and increase anti-inflammatory cytokines (23) . This has a significant clinical implication as AM may contribute to DSA induced pathogenesis in fibrotic and inflammatory lung diseases.\n\nWe investigated whether AM reconstitution is viable with adoptive transfer of allogeneic AM (with a single MHC I mismatch). Intrabronchial administration of na\u00efve Tg AM resulted in AM persistence with a stable reconstitution rate ( Figure S1 ). The donor AM were localized to alveoli and detectable even after four months post-transfer suggesting a viable engraftment. Since the Tg AM carried surface H-2K d , an alloantigen, we evaluated whether Tg\u2192B6 led to alloimmunity. We evaluated elicitation of local as well as systemic alloAb. Following AM transfer, Tg\u2192B6 stimulated Ab and T cell responses to alloantigen ( Figure  4B -C) and lung-associated self-antigens ( Figure 6A -B) concomitant with bronchiolar obstruction and fibrosis ( Figure 5A-B) . AM serve as antigen presenting cells in natural infection (59) and vaccination (60, 61) . Earlier studies reported persistence of donor AM and induction of alloAb (in BAL and serum) and T cells following allogeneic AM transfers (62, 63) . The genetic mismatches between donor and recipient in those studies were major encompassing both MHC (I and II) and non-MHC loci. By contrast, AM transfer experiments performed in our study included one defined allelic mismatch that helped us to determine immunogenicity of MHC I mismatched AM.\n\nA limitation to our study is narrow probe range that permitted analysis of human BAL cells only when the organ donor and recipient's genetic mismatches included at least HLA-A2 or HLA-A3. This excluded a number of potential BAL samples resulting in a small sample size. Nevertheless, our finding of donor derived AM in engrafted lungs is the first demonstration of a long-term persistence of native AM following human LTx. In this study we did not evaluate causality and/or consequence of donor AM in the development of BOS. It is possible that additional cellular and molecular processes participate in the development of DSA and bronchiolar obstruction leading to BOS. However, ability of AM to induce DSA and be stimulated by MHC Ab demonstrate an important role for AM in the DSA induced immunopathogenesis leading to chronic lung allograft rejection.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nThis work was supported by grants from NIH (R01HL056643 and R01HL092514) and BJC foundation to TM, and a grant from NIH (R01AI102891) to MT.
