{"title": "Function-Based Mutation-Resistant Synthetic Signaling\nDevice Activated by HIV-1 Proteolysis", "body": "We prepared the following plasmids:\nCD4(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16, FAS(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16, CD4(HA)-hivp-CFP-6xHis,\nand FAS(HA)-hivp-mCherry-2xNLS (Tables S1\u2013S4). We prepared the HIV-1 protease mutants pNL4\u20133.HSA.R\u2013.E\u2013(G48V/I54T)\n(hereafter referred to as G48V/I54T) with the G48V and I54T mutations\nwithin the HIV-1 protease sequence and pNL4\u20133.HSA.R\u2013.E\u2013(V82A)\n(hereafter referred to as V82A), in which the HIV-1 protease sequence\ncontains a mutation for V82A. The same mutations were also introduced\ninto the vector pcDNA3/GFP-PR (hereafter referred to as GFP-PR) to\nprepare the construct GFP-PR(G48V/I54T). The effector plasmid pABM2(IFN-\u03b21)\nwas prepared from the plasmid pABM2 with GAL4-binding sites and coding\nfor firefly luciferase, a kind gift from Dr. Mark S. Ptashne.\n\nThe HEK293T cells were harvested\nfrom an actively growing culture and plated on 96-well tissue culture\nplates at 2 \u00d7 104 cells per well. After 24 h at approximately\n70% confluence, the cells were transfected with appropriate plasmid\ncombinations: a plasmid for fusion protein CD4(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16\nor FAS(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16, a plasmid coding for the (wild type or\nmutant) HIV-1 protease, reporter plasmid pABM2 (15 ng), and pHRL-TK\ncoding for the constitutive Renilla luciferase transfection\ncontrol. The cells were harvested 24 or 48 h after transfection. The\nactivities of the firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase\nwere measured using the dual-luciferase assay.\n\nHEK293T cells (5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were seeded in\n8-well tissue culture chambers.\nAt 30% confluency, the cells were transfected with plasmids: 40 ng\nof CD4(HA)-hivp-CFP-6xHis or FAS(HA)-hivp-mCherry-2xNLS with or without\n320 ng or 360 ng pNL4\u20133.HSA.R\u2013.E\u2013. The images\nwere acquired 2 days after transfection.\n\nThe HEK293T cells\nwere harvested from an actively growing culture and plated on 96-well\ntissue culture plates at 2 \u00d7 104 cells per well. After\n24 h at approximately 70% confluence, the cells were transfected with\na plasmid CD4(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16 (10 ng), a plasmid coding for (wild\ntype or mutant) HIV-1 protease, and an effector plasmid pABM2(IFN-\u03b21).\nAt 48 or 72 h after transfection, we collected the culture medium\nand determined the IFN-\u03b21 level in the medium."}
