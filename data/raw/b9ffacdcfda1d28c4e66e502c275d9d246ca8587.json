{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Transmission of COVID-19 in the terminal stage of incubation period: a familial cluster Manuscript Title: Transmission of COVID-19 in the terminal stage of incubation period: a familial cluster", "body": "Family and hospital clusters with COVID-19 cases were previously reported and person-to-person transmission has been confirmed [2] . Until now, the infectious period of the disease has not been fully explained [3, 4] . Here, we report a familial cluster of COVID-19 to evidence that a potential transmission of the disease during the incubation period. Person E is a 7-year-old girl who was asymptomatic during the whole medical observation period, and the chest CT showed normal.\n\nA familial cluster of 4 patients with COVID-19 in Zhoushan, China, had close contact before their symptom onset with an asymptomatic family member who was developed symptoms later and diagnosed in Wuxi city. All persons' respiratory specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR assay [5] . Person A's laboratory test and epidemiological investigation was conducted by Wuxi CDC.\n\nUnfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 detection as well as chest CT examination for person A had not been conducted before February 6th, so we do not know when he began to shed virus and have imaging changes in both lungs.\n\nThe present report suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been transmitted in theterminal stage of incubation period. The infectivity during the incubation period for the SARS-CoV-2 is a big challenge for controlling the disease, especially with the new considerations for the potential infectious sources, the recognition of close contacts, and the isolation of close contacts.\n\nThis work was supported by (1) the Zhoushan Science And "}
