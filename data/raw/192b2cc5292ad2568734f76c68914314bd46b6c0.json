Some hospital departments are at higher risk of infection. Objective: To describe TB cases detected after TB screening in HCW from a hospital department (Ear, Nose and Throat -ENT) who had had contact with active TB cases. Material and methods: All HCW (73) from Hospital S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o's ENT Unit who had been in contact with two in-patients with active TB underwent TB screening. Those who had symptoms underwent chest X-ray and mycobacteriological sputum exam.\n\nA todos aqueles que referiram sintomas foi realizada radiografia tor\u00e1cica e exame micobacteriol\u00f3gico de expectora\u00e7\u00e3o. Resultados: Dos 73 profissionais de sa\u00fade submetidos ao rastreio, foi estabelecido o diagn\u00f3stico de tuberculose em 9 (8 do sexo feminino; idade mediana: 30 anos; uma m\u00e9dica, seis enfermeiros e dois auxiliares de ac\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dica). Em 8 profissionais de sa\u00fade foi diagnosticada tuberculose pulmonar, tratando-se o outro caso de tuberculose extra-pulmonar. O diagn\u00f3stico microbiol\u00f3gico foi obtido em 7 casos pelos seguintes m\u00e9todos: exame micobacteriol\u00f3gico directo de expectora\u00e7\u00e3o, n=2; exame cultural de lavado br\u00f4nquico, n=4; exame histol\u00f3gico de tecido pleural, n=1. Em 4 casos, o DNA do Mycobacterium tuberculosis foi extra\u00eddo das culturas, tendo sido efectuada tipagem molecular. Todos estes casos apresentaram tipagem id\u00eantica, o que permite a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de uma liga\u00e7\u00e3o epidemiol\u00f3gica. Conclus\u00e3o: A tuberculose nosocomial \u00e9 relevante, sendo necess\u00e1rio efectuar um esfor\u00e7o para implementar, com sucesso, medidas de controlo de infec\u00e7\u00e3o nas institui\u00e7\u00f5es de sa\u00fade, assim como um programa eficaz de rastreio de tuberculose entre os profissionais de sa\u00fade. A tipagem molecular do Mycobacterium tuberculosis facilita a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de clusters de infec\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nPalavras-chave: Tuberculose, profissionais de sa\u00fade, nosocomial.\n\nResults: Of 73 HCW who underwent TB screening, TB diagnosis was established in 9 (8 female; median age: 30 years; 1 doctor, 6 nurses, 2 nursing auxiliaries). Pulmonary TB was found in 8 and extra--pulmonary TB in 1. Microbiology diagnosis was obtained in 7 cases by sputum smear, n=2; culture exam in bronchial lavage, n=4 and histological exam of pleural tissue, n=1. In 4 cases, Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic DNA was extracted from cultures and molecular typing was done. All cases had identical MIRU types, which allowed identification of the epidemiological link. Conclusion: Nosocomial TB is prominent and efforts should be made to implement successful infection control measures in health care facilities and an effective TB screening program in HCW. Molecular typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis facilitates cluster identification.\n\nWhile the last thirty years have seen a decline in the rate of tuberculosis in Portugal, there is still a high incidence (33.7 new cases/100000 inhabitants in 2004) 1 Esta prova foi executada atrav\u00e9s da injec\u00e7\u00e3o in-concern. It is also a matter for concern for HCW exposed to the risk of contagion through their jobs, such as via exposure to aerosols or poorly ventilated spaces. Nosocomially transmitted tuberculosis is a very real problem 2,3,4,5 and one which demands a consideration of the infection control mechanisms adopted as part of HCW daily working practices 6 \n\nSeventy three ENT HCW were screened for TB. Of these, 24 (32.8%) were referred for a Pulmonology appointment for suspected TB, as they were positive in the tuberculin test (all) with one patient in addition having a dry cough. The HCW with suspected TB were evaluated via chest X-ray, mycobacteriological sputum smear, bronchofibroscopy with bronchial lavage, diagnostic thoracocentesis and pleural biopsy. All 24 HCW underwent chest X-ray, which showed abnormalities in 10 cases. Six had expectoration and underwent mycobacteriological smear sputum exam and culture, which was positive in 2. Seven underwent bronchofibroscopy with bronchial lavage. In 2 cases, this was performed as the mycobacteriological sputum smear was negative and in the other 5 as they did not (Fig.1 ). Sete dos 9 doentes apresentavam sintomas sugestivos de tuberculose present expectoration. Diagnosis was made in 4 cases. One patient, with chest X-ray showing left pleural effusion, underwent diagnostic thoracocentesis and pleural biopsy. The latter method was conclusive in diagnosing TB. The evaluation and study allowed the diagnosis of 9 cases of TB (12.3%) and 3 cases of latent tuberculosis (4.1%). Eight of the 9 new TB cases were female and 1 male. Mean age of the patients was 30 years old (23-61 years). Six were nurses, 2 nursing auxiliaries and I a doctor (Fig.1) . Seven of the 9 patients presented symptoms suggesting TB (Fig. 2 ). X-rays showed pulmonary infiltrates (Fig. 2) . A apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o radiol\u00f3gica dos casos distribuiu-se da seguinte forma: infiltrado pulmonar em 6 doentes; n\u00f3dulo pulmonar em 2 casos e derrame pleural em 1 doente (Fig. 3) . O diagn\u00f3stico de tuberculose foi confirmado microbiologicamente atrav\u00e9s da identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de Mycobacterium tuberculosis em 6 casos; num caso houve confirma\u00e7\u00e3o histol\u00f3gica, pela presen\u00e7a de granulomas epiteli\u00f3ides com necrose caseosa em retalhos de pleura parietal; em 2 casos foi assumido o diagn\u00f3stico de presun\u00e7\u00e3o (Fig. 4) . Um dos 9 casos de tuberculose apresentava derrame pleural esquerdo, que foi estudado, tendo para esse efeito sido realizada toracocentese diagn\u00f3stica (ADA: 119 U/L; exame directo e cul-in 6 patients, pulmonary nodules in 2 and pleural effusion in 1 (Fig. 3) . TB diagnosis was confirmed microbiologically via identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 6 cases. Histological diagnosis was used to confirm one case, identifying epithelioid granulomas with caseous necrosis in sections of parietal pleura. Two cases had a presumed diagnosis only (Fig. 4) . One of the 9 TB cases presented left pleural effusion. Diagnostic thoracocentesis ADA: 119 U/L was performed to study this. Smear and culture exam of the pleural liquid was negative. Mycobacterium tuberculosis study of the pleural liquid using the polymerase chain reaction molecular biology technique was negative. Pleural biopsy was performed as histological exam of the pleura fragments (Table I) .\n\nA presumed diagnosis was made in 2 cases as the mycobacteriological exams (smear, culture and polymerase chain reaction) of the bronchial lavage were negative. One patient had respiratory (chest pain) and bodily (fever) symptoms, a pos- Assim, verificou-se que em 2 casos os exames micobacteriol\u00f3gicos (directo, cultural e polymerase chain reaction) do lavado br\u00f4nquico foram negativos, tendo sido assumido um diagn\u00f3stico de presun\u00e7\u00e3o. Um dos doentes apresentava sintomas respirat\u00f3rios (toracalgia) e constitucionais (febre), prova de tuberculina positiva e altera\u00e7\u00e3o radiol\u00f3gica (n\u00f3dulo pulmonar no lobo superior direito), pelo que efectuou tratamento com anti--bacilares de primeira linha durante seis meses, tendo ficado assintom\u00e1tico. Por outro lado, a tomografia computadorizada tor\u00e1cica de controlo, realizada 8 meses depois do in\u00edcio do trata-itive reactive to the tuberculin test and X--ray abnormalities (pulmonary nodule of the right upper lobe) and so was prescribed first line anti-bacillary treatment for six months, after which symptoms disappeared. In addition, a control chest CT scan made 8 months after start of treatment showed the nodular lesion on the right upper lobe had decreased in size. While the other patient had no symptoms, there was a positive reactive to the tuberculin test and X-ray abnormalities (pulmonary infiltrates in both upper lobes). Anti--bacillary treatment was prescribed for six months, after which a control chest CT scan showed resolution of the abovementioned pulmonary infiltrates, with patient remaining asymptomatic. Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic DNA was extracted from cultures in 4 of the 9 patients. In 3 cases the culture was of bronchial lavage and in one case sputum. Molecular typing was then carried out, using Three cases of latent TB were also identified, one in a 54 year old nurse, one in a 50 year old nurse and one in a 32 year old nursing auxiliary. These were diagnosed due to positive reaction to the tuberculin test as patients did not present any symptoms of TB and chest X-rays did not show any abnormalities suggesting the disease. These 3 health care workers were prescribed chemo-prophylaxis with isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide for 2 months.\n\nSeventy three HCW from the HSJ ENT department were studied. They had been in probable contact with 2 ENT in-patients with active pulmonary TB who had undergone tracheotomy and were infectious. Evaluation revealed TB disease in 9 and TB infection in 3, corresponding to a TB rate of 12328.8 per 100000 persons. This high rate of TB in HCW as compared to the population at large is a matter of concern, and has been documented in other studies 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 . Our results underline the importance of and the need to abide by hospital-wide infection control measures 12 . We stress the higher rate usually seen in nurses, perhaps due to their closer and more prolonged contact with the 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 . Os resultados apresentados neste trabalho alertam para a import\u00e2ncia e a necessidade do cumprimento de medidas de controlo de infec\u00e7\u00e3o a n\u00edvel hospitalar 12 . De referir que o grupo profissional de enfermagem, talvez porque tenha um contacto mais pr\u00f3ximo e prolongado com o doente infectante durante a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de actividades, com exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a aeross\u00f3is, apresenta, habitualmente, valores de incid\u00eancia de tuberculose mais elevados 3,7,8 . As t\u00e9cnicas de tipagem molecular, nomeadamente a de mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU) ou a de restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), facilitam a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de clusters de infec\u00e7\u00e3o 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 . O rastreio da tuberculose \u00e9 essencial para a detec\u00e7\u00e3o da doen\u00e7a e seu tratamento precoce 18 .\n\ninfectious patients during activities with exposure to aerosols 3, 7, 8 . Molecular typing techniques, particularly Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit (MIRU) or Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), make it easier to identify infection clusters 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 . Screening for TB is vital in the early detection and treatment of this disease 18 . "}
