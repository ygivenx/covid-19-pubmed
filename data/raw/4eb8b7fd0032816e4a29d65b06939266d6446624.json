{"title": "Encoding of odor fear memories in the mouse olfactory cortex", "body": "Odor perception, and emotional and behavioral responses to odors strongly depend on experience, and learned odor-context associations often last for the lifetime of an animal (Mouly and Sullivan, 2010) . The cellular and neural circuit mechanisms underlying olfactory learning and memory, however, remain poorly understood.\n\nRecent studies on episodic and contextual learning in hippocampal neural networks have suggested that memories are encoded in the activity of distributed ensembles of neurons, often referred to as a 'memory trace' (Mayford and Reijmers, 2015; Poo et al., 2016; Tonegawa et al., 2015) . The neurons constituting such a memory trace are thought to encode information about the environmental context and associated emotions of past experiences, and their activity is necessary and sufficient for memory retrieval (Liu et al., 2012; Reijmers et al., 2007; Tanaka et al., 2014) .\n\nHere, we investigate the organization of odor memory traces in the olfactory (piriform) cortex of mice. The piriform cortex, a trilaminar paleocortical structure, is the largest cortical area receiving direct afferent inputs from the olfactory bulb, which, in turn, receives topographically organized inputs from olfactory sensory neurons in the nose. Individual piriform neurons respond to combinatorial inputs from multiple Piriform cortex has long been hypothesized to support auto-associative network functions that can retrieve previously learned information from partial or degraded sensory inputs (Haberly, 2001; Wilson and Sullivan, 2011) . Piriform pyramidal cells form a large recurrent network, which is reciprocally connected with adjacent highorder associative areas including the prefrontal, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex and the amygdala (Johnson et al., 2000; Sadrian and Wilson, 2015) . Storage of information is made possible by NMDA-dependent, associative plasticity of connections (Johenning et al., 2009; Kanter and Haberly, 1990; Quinlan et al., 2004) .\n\nFurthermore, changes in piriform network activity (Chapuis and Wilson, 2011; Chen et al., 2011; Li et al., 2008; Sevelinges et al., 2004) and stabilization of piriform odor representations (Shakhawat et al., 2015) have been observed after associative olfactory learning. Finally, excitotoxic lesions of the posterior piriform cortex in rats perturb odor fear memories (Sacco and Sacchetti, 2010) , and optogenetic stimulation of artificial piriform ensembles is sufficient to drive learned behaviors (Choi et al., 2011) . Taken together, these studies have led to the hypothesis that piriform neural ensembles encode olfactory memory traces.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we have developed an intersectional genetic strategy in mice to target piriform neurons that are activated by olfactory experience. We employed\n\nTo selectively label and manipulate piriform neurons that were activated during odor exposure, we used cFos-tTA transgenic mice (Reijmers et al., 2007) , in which the activity-dependent cFos promoter drives expression of the tTA transcription factor, and we stereotaxically injected in their piriform cortex Adeno-Associated Viruses (AAVs) expressing Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) under the control of the tTA-responsive promoter tetO ( Figure 1A) .\n\nDREADDs (Alexander et al., 2009; Ferguson et al., 2011) increase (hM3Dq:mCherry) or decrease (HA:hM4Di-IRES-mCitrine) the excitability of neurons upon activation by their ligand clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Temporal control of DREADD expression is provided by doxycycline, administered through the diet, which interferes with the binding of tTA to tetO and thus suppresses transgene expression (Gossen et al., 1995) . Mice maintained in their home cage on a doxycycline-containing diet showed low basal DREADD expression, detected by anti-HA immunohistochemistry and native mCherry fluorescence (Figure 1B and C) . To induce DREADD expression, mice were taken off doxycycline five days before odor presentation. Exposure to odor followed by foot shock (see Experimental Procedures) resulted in the Fos-tagging of sparse neural ensembles (median (interquartile range): 1.6 (0.3) % of piriform neurons, n=2 for hM4Di; 2.2 (0.5) % of piriform neurons, n=3 for hM3Dq), which were broadly dispersed throughout the anterior and posterior piriform cortex ( Figure 1B and C), consistent with previous observations of endogenous cFos expression (Datiche et al., 2001; Illig and Haberly, 2003) .\n\nTo test whether CNO-mediated activation of DREADDs in Fos-tagged piriform neurons alters their excitability, we performed whole-cell recordings in acute brain author/funder.

DREADD-expressing neurons were identified based on mCitrine (HA:hM4Di-IRES-mCitrine) or mCherry (hM3Dq:mCherry) fluorescence. Figure 1) . In the absence of the DREADD ligand CNO, the resting membrane potential of DREADD-expressing piriform neurons was indistinguishable from DREADD-negative cells (-71.70 (4.37) mV in n=24, (4.32) mV in hM4Di-expressing cells, n=14, -72.56 (3.92) mV in hM3Dq-expressing cells, n=15, p=0.631, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Figure 1D ). After bath application of CNO (5 \u00b5M), the membrane properties selectively changed in DREADD-expressing cells: hM4Di-expressing cells hyperpolarized (-74.51 (5.17 ) mV, n=12, p=0.007, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test), and hM3Dq-expressing cells depolarized (-66.95 (4.12) mV, n=13, p=0.001, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test), whereas the resting membrane potential of DREADD-negative cells remained unchanged (-70.28 (3.81) mV, n=15, p=0.890, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test, Figure 1D ). The relative changes were 1.00 (0.03) in DREADD-negative cells (n=15, p=0.890, One Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test), 1.04 (0.03) in hM4Di-expressing cells, (n=12, p<0.001, One Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test) and 0.91 (0.09) in hM3Dq-expressing cells, (n=13, p=0.001, One Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test), Figure 1E ). To determine the impact of CNO treatment on neuronal excitability, we delivered depolarizing current steps and compared the number of action potentials triggered by 60 pA step current above action potential threshold (see Experimental Procedures). We found that in hM4Di-expressing cells, the number of evoked action potentials significantly decreased after CNO application (3.75 (1.59) vs. 0.30 (3.48), n=10, p=0.010, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test), whereas in hM3Dq-expressing cells, the number of author/funder.

In contrast, DREADDnegative cells did not exhibit a significant change in the number of evoked action potentials upon CNO application (4.33 (1.67) vs. 4.67 (3.00), n=9, p=0.672, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test, Figure 1F ). The relative changes were 1.00 (0.41) in DREADDnegative cells, (n=9, p=0.641, One Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests), 0.09 (0.81) in hM4Di-expressing cells (n=10, p=0.010, One Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests) and 1.81\u00b11.09 in hM3Dq-expressing cells (n=11, p=0.004, One Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests, Figure 1G ). Taken together, these experiments show that Fos-tagging during olfactory fear conditioning marks a sparse and dispersed subpopulation of piriform neurons, and that CNO-mediated activation of hM4Di or hM3Dq expressed in Fos-tagged neurons selectively decreases or increases their excitability.\n\nIf Fos-tagged piriform neurons that were activated during olfactory learning constitute an essential component of an olfactory memory trace, then perturbing the activity of these ensembles should interfere with memory recall. To test this prediction, we Fostagged piriform neurons during olfactory fear conditioning, and then chemogenetically silenced Fos-tagged ensembles during odor fear memory recall. cFos-tTA transgenic mice (\"experimental group\", n=8) were bilaterally injected in piriform cortex with the AAV-tetO-hM4Di vector. Wild-type mice injected with the same virus served as a control (\"control group\", n=8). During training, the conditioned odor (CS+) was presented at one of the ends of the conditioning box and paired with a foot shock, applied to the side of the box where the odor was delivered (see Experimental author/funder.

Mice thus learned to escape from the conditioned stimulus (CS+) by running towards the opposite side of the box. Two control odors, whose presentation was not paired with foot shock (CS-), were used to entrain odorspecific as opposed to generalized fear responses (Chen et al., 2011) . Doxycycline was removed from the diet of mice prior to training, to permit the induction of hM4Di expression in active Fos-expressing piriform neurons of mice of the experimental group. Mice were returned to doxycycline-containing diet immediately after odor fear conditioning, and memory recall of the odor-foot shock association was tested three days later by presenting the odors alone in a new box ( Figure 2B and C). All mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with CNO before testing, to exclude potential offtarget effects by CNO (Gomez et al., 2017) . For all mice, we verified viral gene expression by post hoc histological examination. Previous studies have suggested that the posterior piriform cortex is important for associative memory encoding (Sacco et al., 2010; Calu et al., 2008; Haberly 2001) . We therefore excluded from our analysis mice in which parts of the posterior piriform cortex were spared from viral infection (Supplementary Figure 2) . We combined two parameters to quantify the learned escape behavior: the position of the mouse in the box, and the increase in its maximum velocity after odor presentation ( Figure 2B ). These parameters were chosen because they described well the behavioral response of mice to the odor-foot shock pairing during training (Supplementary Figure 3) .\n\nAs expected, mice in the control group exhibited robust escape behavior upon CS+ presentation. The median position of the mice in the box at the end of stimulus delivery was 0.74 (with 0 defined as the site of odor presentation and 1 as the opposite end of the box), and mice exhibited a 1.9-fold increase of their maximum velocity ( Figure 2E, G and H) . In contrast, escape behavior was significantly reduced author/funder. All rights reserved.

Their median position in the box at the end of stimulus delivery, (0.42), and their 1.1-fold increase in maximum velocity were significantly lower than in the control group (Mann-Whitney test, U=7, p=0.007 for both position and velocity, Figure 2E , G and H). The difference in the position of mice after CS+ and CS-presentation was also significantly different between the control and experimental groups (Mann-Whitney test, U=13, p=0.0499, Figure 2F ). Differences in behavioral responses of cFos-tTA transgenic mice were specifically due to hM4Di activation, as escape behavior after CNO injection was unaffected in cFos-tTA transgenic mice injected with AAVs expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP (n=9, Supplementary Figure 4 ).\n\nAll mice were similarly close to the odor port at the onset of CS+ odor presentation (Mann-Whitney test, U=28, p=0.7209, Figure 2D ), and had similar maximum velocities during the 7 s time period that preceded odor presentation (Mann-Whitney test, U=24, p=0.4418, Figure 2G ). These observations exclude any inherent differences between groups due to how the CS+ was presented. Furthermore, escape behavior in control mice was specific to the CS+, as none of the mice ran away from the CS-( Figure 2D , E and H). Finally, we did not observe any differences in the overall mobility of mice throughout the entire testing session. The median speed of mice of all groups (0.68 (0.28) cm/s and 0.46 (0.14) cm/s for the control and experimental groups respectively) was not significantly different (Mann-Whitney test, U=22, p=0.3282), nor did mice show a bias for the left or right side of the testing box (time spent on the left side divided by time spent on the right side: 1.36 (0.72) and\n\n1.51 (0.52) for the control and experimental groups respectively, Mann-Whitney test, U=27, p=0.6454). Together, these data suggest that Fos-tagged piriform ensembles that were activated during olfactory fear conditioning are necessary for odor fear author/funder. All rights reserved.

They were further away from the odor port after CS+ presentation than after CS-presentation (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, W=-36, p=0.0078, Figure 2E ), and their maximum velocity ratio was significantly higher (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, W=-36, p=0.0078, Figure 2H ). This could indicate a partial memory of the learned association, possibly due to incomplete silencing of Fos-tagged neurons in piriform cortex, or the existence of parallel neural pathways that partially compensate for the loss of piriform functions. Finally, silencing of the piriform cortex in only one hemisphere did not abolish the learned escape behavior to the conditioned odor (Supplementary Figure 5) .\n\nIt is possible that the chemogenetic silencing of piriform ensembles that were Fostagged during olfactory fear conditioning disrupts odor detection and discrimination rather than selectively affecting odor fear memory recall. To test this possibility, we monitored sniffing behavior of mice during an olfactory habituation/dishabituation assay ( Figure 3A) , a well established test for odor detection and discrimination (Coronas-Samano et al., 2016; Verhagen et al., 2007; Wesson et al., 2008) . Fostagging of piriform neurons during olfactory fear conditioning was performed as described above. Three days later, changes in sniffing behavior in response to odor exposure were tested in a plethysmograph, while hM4Di-expressing piriform neurons author/funder. All rights reserved.

We observed that mice of both experimental (n=8) and control (n=6) groups increased their sniff frequency upon presentation of a novel, neutral odor (1.6 fold increase; Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, W=21, p=0.0312 and W=36, p=0.0078 for the control and experimental groups, respectively; Figure 3B and C). Repeated exposure to the same odor (neutral odor or CS-) resulted in a decrease in the sniff frequency, reflecting habituation after 4 consecutive exposures (Figure 3C and D) . Finally, presentation of the CS+ increased sniff frequency (1.4 fold increase; Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, W=21, p=0.0312 and W=34, p=0.0156 for the control and experimental groups, respectively, Figure 3D ). Such changes in odor sampling behavior have been shown to report the detection and discrimination of different odor stimuli (Coronas-Samano et al., 2016; Verhagen et al., 2007; Wesson et al., 2008) . Therefore, these data suggest that basic behaviors characteristic of odor sampling, detection and discrimination were unaffected by the silencing of piriform ensembles that were Fostagged during olfactory fear conditioning.\n\nOdors activate unique but overlapping ensembles of piriform neurons (Bolding and Franks, 2017; Poo and Isaacson, 2009; Roland et al., 2017; Stettler and Axel, 2009 ). Therefore, silencing neurons that respond to one odor could partially interfere with the retrieval of information associated with other odors. To test this prediction we modified the behavioral protocol to separate Fos-tagging from olfactory fear conditioning. cFos-tTA transgenic and wild-type control mice were injected with AAV-tetO-hM4Di, and expression of hM4Di in piriform neurons was induced while mice author/funder.

Fos-tagging resulted in the labeling of sparse neural ensembles, similar to those labeled during odor-foot shock association (1.1 (0.3) % of piriform neurons, n=3). Mice were returned to doxycycline-containing diet and trained two days later to associate a different odor (ethyl-acetate, CS+) with foot shock.\n\nBehavioral testing of the learned escape behavior in response to the CS+ was performed one day later, after i.p. injection of CNO (see Experimental Procedures and Figure 4A ). We found that learned escape behavior of cFos-tTA transgenic mice expressing hM4Di (experimental group, n=12) was similar but somewhat attenuated compared to wild-type controls (n=10). Both groups exhibited an escape behavior after CS+ presentation, indicated by the significant increase in the maximum velocity (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, W=55, p=0.0020 and W=56, p=0.0269 for the control and experimental groups respectively; no difference in the maximum velocity ratio after/before between groups, Mann-Whitney test, U=35, p=0.1071, Figure 4E and F). The difference in the position of mice after CS+ and CSpresentation was also similar between the control and experimental groups (Mann-Whitney test, U=37, p=0.1402, Figure 4D ). However, we observed that silencing neutral odor representations somewhat dampened the behavioral response to the conditioned stimulus, as behavioral responses were less robust compared to controls when quantifying the position of mice in the box after CS+ presentation (Mann-Whitney test, U=22, p=0.0112, Figure 4B and C). The attenuated behavioral responses we observe likely reflect the partial degradation of odor information as a result of the silencing of piriform neurons responsive to both the CS+ and the neutral odor.\n\nauthor/funder.

To test this prediction, we devised a modified behavioral task to assess memory recall. We monitored exploratory behavior in an open field during ambient odor exposure or artificial reactivation of Fos-tagged neurons, a test that does not rely on an escape behavior from an odor originating from a spatially defined odor source ( Figure 5A ). We first trained mice to associate ethyl-acetate, the CS+, with foot shock. Upon ambient exposure to the CS+, diffused above the open field, exploratory behavior of mice was significantly attenuated compared to baseline exploratory behavior measured one day earlier (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, n=6, W=-21, p=0.0312). Ethyl-acetate exposure did not affect exploratory behavior of mice that had previously been exposed to ethylacetate without foot shock (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, n=5, W=1, p>0.9999). These data suggest that re-exposure of mice to the CS+ causes an increase in anxiety-like behavior, expressed as a decrease in exploratory behavior in the open field.\n\nWe next repeated the experiment in cFos-tTA transgenic mice, in which the piriform cortex had been infected with the activating DREADD AAV-tetO-hM3Dq (Supplementary Figure 6) . Instead of exposure to the CS+, we i.p. injected the DREADD ligand CNO to reactivate hM3Dq-expressing piriform neurons that were Fos-tagged during odor-foot shock association (see Experimental Procedures and Figure 5A ). We found that CNO-mediated reactivation, similar to CS+ exposure, caused a significant decrease in exploratory behavior of mice that had undergone author/funder. All rights reserved.

CNO-mediated reactivation of piriform neurons that were Fos-tagged during ethyl-acetate exposure without foot shock did not affect exploratory behavior of mice (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, n=7, W=-10, p=0.4688, Figure 5B and C). Taken together, these data suggest that chemogenetic reactivation of piriform neurons that were active during odor-foot shock exposure is sufficient to trigger fear memory recall.\n\nWe next asked whether artificial memory recall depends on the specificity of the Fostagged neural ensemble: is piriform reactivation sufficient to trigger fear memory recall, as long as it includes the CS+-tagged ensemble? For this purpose, we generated a synthetic Fos-tagged ensemble, by sequentially exposing mice to ethylacetate paired with foot-shock (CS+) and neutral odors (CS-, eugenol and betacitronellol) ( Figure 5D ). While exposure to the CS+ resulted in anxiety-like behavior similar to what was observed in the previous experiment (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, n=6, W=-21, p=0.0312, Figure 5E and F), artificial reactivation of synthetic Fos-tagged ensemble did not result in changes in exploratory behavior that would indicate memory recall (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, n=8, W=-4, p=0.8438, Figure 5E and F). These data suggest that during artificial reactivation, piriform cortex cannot extract meaningful information from the synthetic representation generated by the sequential presentation of CS+ and CS-odors. author/funder.

Several studies have shown that piriform cortex cells can encode information that carries behavioral significance (Calu et al., 2008 , Mandairon et al., 2014 , Sacco et al., 2010 ), yet their functional relevance has never been assessed by direct experimental manipulation. Using a cFos-dependent, intersectional genetic approach to visualize and manipulate piriform neurons activated during olfactory fear conditioning (Figure 1 ), we found that chemogenetic silencing of Fos-tagged piriform ensembles abolished a learned odor escape behavior (Figure 2 ). Silencing these Fos-tagged ensembles did not alter basic odor detection and discrimination (Figure 3) . Furthermore, chemogenetic silencing of neurons responsive to a neutral odor only moderately attenuated odor fear memory recall, suggesting that Fos-tagged piriform ensembles are largely odor-specific ( Figure 4) . Finally, specific chemogenetic reactivation of piriform ensembles that were active during learning resulted in reduced exploratory behavior in an open field assay, an effect that was similarly observed when exposing mice to the conditioned odor stimulus (Figure 5) . Together, our experiments identify piriform neurons that were active during learning as necessary and sufficient to trigger odor fear memory recall. This indicates the formation of functional connections between Fos-tagged piriform cells and other associative areas and firmly establish piriform ensembles as an essential component of odor fear memory traces.\n\nArtificial reactivation of an olfactory memory trace author/funder.

How piriform neural circuits and downstream target regions process such artificial activity patterns remains to be determined. One possibility is that despite the temporal limitations of memory trace reactivation, piriform network mechanisms can retrieve the perception of the reinforced conditioned stimulus. Consistent with this model, recent studies have shown that spatial patterns of odor-evoked activity, in the absence of precise temporal information, are sufficient to decode odor identity in piriform cortex (Bolding and Franks, 2017; Miura et al., 2012; Roland et al., 2017) . Alternatively, it is possible that reactivation generates a state of stress and anxiety, but without evoking the perception of the odor. Candidate target areas for the processing of odor-fear associations include the basolateral amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (Dejean et al., 2016; Gore et al., 2015) , however, the relevant neural circuit components remain to be identified. Finally, reactivating a synthetic ensemble of neurons activated during exposure to the reinforced stimulus (CS+) and the nonreinforced stimuli (CS-) did not elicit a measurable behavioral response. This observation suggests that behaviorally relevant information cannot be extracted from a neural ensemble representing conflicting (aversive versus neutral) information. This result is consistent with the finding that the reactivation of an artificial contextual memory in the hippocampus competes with the retrieval of a learned context-shock association (Ramirez et al., 2013) . author/funder.

The duration of the expression of tTA-dependent proteins is determined by the time course of induction and the stability of cFos-tTA-dependent transcripts and proteins in tagged neurons. Previous studies have shown that TetTag-dependent expression of regulators of neural activity lasts for at least five days but becomes undetectable by thirty days (Cowansage et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015) . We therefore restricted our manipulations of neural activity and behavioral analyses to a three-day time window after Fos-tagging of neurons during olfactory conditioning. Another constraint of the Fos-tagging system is its slow temporal dynamics. As a consequence, neurons responding to the reinforced conditioned stimulus (CS+), the odorant paired with foot shock, and neurons responding to the non-reinforced conditioned stimuli (CS-), the odorants not associated with foot shock, were tagged in our silencing experiments. The use of a CS-compromises the specificity of the Fos-tagged neural ensembles. Nevertheless, the CS-provides an important experimental readout for the odor selectivity of the behavioral response.\n\nInterestingly, the number of Fos-tagged piriform neurons we observe is significantly lower than the number of odor-responsive neurons detected in electrophysiological recordings in awake mice (Bolding and Franks, 2017; Miura et al., 2012; Zhan and Luo, 2010) . However, in these experiments, a large fraction of cells exhibited low firing rates. Therefore, the Fos-tagged population could represent a subpopulation of neurons that is strongly activated by odor (Schoenenberger et al., 2009) . Fos-tagging could also mark plastic changes supporting memory formation (Cole et al., 1989; Minatohara et al., 2015) .

Future studies will allow to directly test these hypotheses.\n\nThe hippocampus has been studied extensively for its role in spatial and contextual memory (Basu and Siegelbaum, 2015) . Recently, Fos-tagging of hippocampal neurons during contextual fear conditioning has provided important insight into the cellular and neural circuit mechanisms of learning and memory (Cai et al., 2016; Garner et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012; Ramirez et al., 2013; Roy et al., 2017; Ryan et al., 2015) . However, if principles of memory formation and storage in hippocampusrelated neural networks apply to other cortical structures remains largely unknown.\n\nInterestingly, pirform cortex and hippocampus share a similar circuit organization and both have been modeled as auto-associative networks (Haberly, 2001) . Consistent with this model, our findings reveal striking similarities between olfactory memory traces in the piriform cortex and memory traces of contextual fear in the hippocampus. In both piriform cortex and hippocampus, learning activates sparse and distributed ensembles of neurons that appear to lack topographic organization. Furthermore, hippocampal neurons tagged during contextual fear conditioning, and piriform neurons tagged during olfactory fear conditioning were both necessary and sufficient for memory retrieval (Liu et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2014) , The olfactory system is particularly well-suited for studying learning and memory. Indeed, odor memories and olfactory-driven behaviors are robust in animals, including in mice, providing highly reliable and quantitative behavioral readouts. Furthermore, the author/funder.

Mice were group-housed with littermates until the beginning of surgery and then single-housed in ventilated cages throughout the duration of the experiment. cFos-tTA mice (Reijmers et al., 2007) were fed a diet containing 1g/kg doxycycline for a minimum of 4 days before surgery. Wild-type control animals were siblings that did not carry the cFos-tTA transgene. The age of mice at the time of behavioral testing ranged from 10 to 15 weeks. Male mice were used for the hM4Di-mediated neural silencing, and females for the hM3Dq-mediated neural activation experiments. Experiments were carried out according to European and French national institutional animal care guidelines (protocol APAFIS#2016012909576100).\n\nThe Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) were generated at Penn Vector Core, University of Pennsylvania (serotype 8, 10 13 genome copies/mL, 1:2 dilution with sterile PBS on the day of injection).\n\nauthor/funder.

Images were acquired as Z-stacks (70 to 140 \u00b5m in total thickness, step size 7 \u00b5m) with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope or as single plane sections with a Zeiss Axio Zoom microscope and processed in Fiji.\n\nCounting Z-stacks (7 \u00b5m step) were acquired with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 20X objective and a resolution of 512x512 or 1024x1024 pixels (1 pixel: 0:72\u00b5m). First, the piriform cortex was delineated on a maximum projection of each stack using a custom-written ImageJ macro. For each mouse, 2 to 4 sections (median volume 9.3e-2 (9.4e-3) mm 3 ) were analyzed, from one or both hemispheres, at Y=-0.8 and Y=-1.6mm relative to bregma.\n\nHA-stained neurons (hM4Di) were counted by hand. hM3Dq-mCherry positive neurons were counted using a custom-written ImageJ plugin. After pre-processing the image (Subtract Background, Remove Outliers and Median Filter), the z-stack is thresholded using the RenyiEntropy algorithm. On each slice of the stack, objects with an area smaller than 40\u00b5m 2 are removed using the Analyze Particle command in ImageJ. A mask of each slice from the stack is created containing the filled outline of the measured particles. The number of cells is the number of 3D objects detected in the stack. Automated cell detection can be prone to error, thus, the detection efficiency was checked on a few pictures by two people blind to the experimental conditions.\n\nThe numbers of cells were calculated as numbers of cells per cubic millimeter. An estimate of the total number of neurons (counterstained with NeuroTrace) per cubic millimeter (7.1e4 mm -3 ) was obtained by counting neurons in representative volumes author/funder.

Animals were anaesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (100 mg/kg/10 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich), perfused with ice-cold ACSF (125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 25 mM glucose 25mM NaHCO 3 , 1.25 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM pyruvic acid, bubbled with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 and adjusted to 295\u00b15 mOsm osmolarity), and decapitated. The brain was cooled with ice-cold ACSF solution and then sliced using a 7000SM2 vibrating microtome (Campden Instruments, UK). Slices were incubated in the same solution at 34\u00b0C for one hour and then continuously perfused with ACSF solution (2 mL/min) at 34\u00b0C in the recording chamber. DREADD expression was detected with two-photon excitation (830nm, ChameleonMRU-X1, Coherent, UK) under a Scientifica TriM Scope II microscope (LaVision, Germany), with a 60x water-immersion objective. Whole-cell recording pipettes with 5-7 M\u03a9 resistance were filled with the following solution (in mM): 122 Kgluconate, 13 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 0.3 EGTA (adjusted to pH 7.35 with KOH). The recording solution also contained the morphological tracer Alexa Fluor 594 (5 \u00b5M, red channel) for nonexpressing and hM4Di-positive cells or the Ca 2+ -sensitive dye Fura-2 (300 \u00b5M, replacing EGTA in the recording solution, green channel) for hM3Dq-positive cells, to enable identification of the patched cell and to visualize its morphology.

We compared the number of action potentials triggered by equivalent depolarization at each step 60 pA above the action potential threshold before and after CNO (5 \u00b5M) application. The series resistance was usually <20 M\u03a9, and data were discarded if it changed by more than 20% during the recording. Signals were amplified using EPC10-2 amplifiers (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Voltage-clamp recordings were filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz, and current-clamp recordings were filtered at 10 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz, with the Patchmaster v2x32 program (HEKA Elektronik).\n\nA training box was used to train mice to escape from an odor. The box was rectangular (L 57 cm, W 17 cm, H 64 cm), with a grid floor made of 72 stainless-steel rods (diameter=6 mm, space between rods=2 mm). Current was delivered by an aversive stimulator (MedAssociates, 115V, 60 Hz). A custom-made switcher allowed an electric foot shock (0.6 mA, 0.6 ms) to be applied independently to either half of the box. A testing box was used to test memory retrieval. Its dimensions were similar to the training box. Materials for the walls and floor were different from the training box to create a different context. The open field box consisted of a white Plexiglas (6 mm thickness) container (50 cm x 50 cm x 38 height).\n\nSniffing behavior was monitored in freely moving mice using a plethysmograph (Emka Technologies). Electrical signals were amplified using RHD 2132 amplifier boards (Intan Technologies) and band-pass filtered (1-30 Hz).\n\nOdors were delivered using an 8 channels olfactometer (Automate Scientific).\n\nContinuous air flowed through a bottle of mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich) to avoid pressure changes when presenting the odors.

Mice were given 10 days to recover, before being habituated on day 11 to the training and testing/open field/plethysmograph boxes (40 and 10 min each). 24 hours after habituation, doxycycline was removed and replaced by a normal diet. Five days later, mice were fear conditioned to ethyl-acetate or exposed to an odor (odor \"C\") in a neutral environment. Immediately after fear conditioning or odor presentation, mice were put back on a diet containing doxycycline. During fear conditioning, ethyl-acetate (the CS+) was presented at one extremity of the training box, and the corresponding halfside of the box' floor was electrified for 0.6 s (0.6 mA). The foot shock was delivered 4 seconds after CS+ presentation, and the CS+ lasted for an additional 2 seconds.\n\nMice learned to escape to the opposite side when the CS+ was presented. The CS+ was presented 4 times, 2 times on each side of the box. When fear conditioning included presentation of two non-reinforced conditioned stimuli (CS-1 and CS-2), the choice between CS+ and CS-as well as the side of presentation was pseudorandomized. Training always started with one presentation of each CS-followed by the CS+. The two CS-odors were presented during 7 seconds, 3 times each, with a total presentation of 3 on the right side and 3 on the left side. During testing, the CS+ was presented 4 times (2 times on each side), and each CS-was presented once on each side, for 7 s each. As for the training session, the order and side of odor presentations was pseudo-randomized: testing always started with one presentation author/funder. All rights reserved.

Aliquots were stored for up to two months at -20\u00b0C and equilibrated to room temperature before injection. The solution was administered intraperitoneally (3 mg/kg). After injection, mice were left undisturbed for 25 minutes (Figure 2 and 4) or 5 minutes (Figure 3 and 5) in their home cage before the start of the experiment.\n\nElectrophysiological data were analyzed with custom-made software in Python 3.0 and averaged in MS Excel (Microsoft, USA). Behavioral sessions were video recorded and analyzed using custom-written MatLab programs (available upon request). Parameters extracted from multiple CS+ (CS-) presentation were averaged for each mouse.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed with Prism (GraphPad).

The CS+ is presented at one end of the training box, and the corresponding half-side of the box is electrified. Training includes the presentation of two other odors that are not paired with foot shock (CS-, eugenol and beta-citronellol).\n\nThe CS+ is presented 4 times (2 times on each side) and each CS-three times. The order and side of odor presentations is pseudo-randomized. B) During testing, the CS+ is presented 4 times (2 times on each side), and each CSis presented once on each side, for 7 s each.

Since the odor is presented randomly on the left or right side of the testing box, 0 is defined as the extremity where the odor is presented. For velocity measurements, a 7 s time window is defined both before and after stimulus onset (bottom). C) Experimental design: cFos-tTA transgenic mice (experimental group, n=8) or wildtype mice (control group, n=8) are injected with AAV-tetO-hM4Di in both hemispheres of piriform cortex. Ten days later, mice are habituated to the training and testing boxes. Upon doxycycline (DOX) removal, mice are fear-conditioned, and hM4Di expression (green circles) is induced in Fos-tagged neurons (filled in blue and yellow). Mice are returned to DOX-containing diet to avoid further expression of hM4Di. Three days later, all mice are i.p. injected with CNO, which silences hM4Diexpressing neurons (black crosses), and memory retrieval is tested.\n\n(D to H) Olfactory memory retrieval after CNO injection, assessed by the position of mice in the testing box and their maximum velocity upon odor exposure.
