{"title": "A model simulation study on effects of intervention measures in Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic", "body": "In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China. transmissions between human were seen by the middle of January. And patient number increased sharply. In order to block the virus transmission from entire China and even worldwide. This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization.\n\nWuhan municipal government issued an official order to stop all transportation between Wuhan and the rest of China. Public transportations within Wuhan were also stopped. By 9th, February 2020, China central government mobilized enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces to support Wuhan. Till 11th February\uff0c18700 healthcare personals belong to 154 medical teams had arrived in Wuhan and started to work with local hospitals. Wuhan government also declared regulations on residence building control, which include identity check at building entrance and strict infection control measures in buildings with suspect patients or identified patients.\n\nWith all these intervention measures undertaken, and maybe more on the way, proper tools are need anticipate possible effects on epidemic control and to provide reliable information to support future decisions. Simulation also can help people understand how infectious disease spread and how to understand the purpose and consequences of various efforts.\n\nThis current work was based on simulation model build on known transmission parameters from published research papers.\n\nAccording to Qun Li et al. [1] , 2019-nCoV's average incubation time is 7.5 days (95% CI 5.3-19.0), 95% percentiles is 12.5 days. In early stage of the disease, patients' number would double every 7.4 days. Basic reproduction number (R0) was presumed to be 2.2 (95% CI 1.4-3.9). In Qun's paper R0's 95% CI was between 1.4-3.9. R0=2, 3 or 4 were used in model preparation. And 2 and 4 were ruled out because of obvious devotion from open reported data. So R0 was set at 3 in this simulation.\n\nPatient incubation time after been transmitted was assigned by python numpy random.normal function, with parameters set as: loc ( mean value of random serie )=7.5, scale ( standard deviation) = 3.4. Values lower than 0 are converted to positive values. In this study, simulation cases can only transmit virus to new patients on the last day of incubation to make calculation simple.\n\nAccording to media report and Wuhan government's announcement, the 2019-nCOV epidemic could be divided into 3 periods. .

PAI=1 means no restriction of social activity, while PAI=0 means totally grounded (include in house isolation and all sorts of hospitalization) .\n\nBased on these parameters a simple simulation model was accomplished with python 3.6.\n\nAll calculation was run on a mac pro notebook with 3.1 GHz duel core CPU and 8GB memory. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status.\n\nData were shown as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.\n\nSimulations were run by 50 times. 141427709 simulated patients were created with incubation time 7.5 \u00b1 3.4 days. The distribution of incubation time are show in Figure 2 . 913396.5 \u00b1 559099.9 (Table 1) . And among these patients, 5% (more than 45000 patients) would be critically ill [2] .\n\n.

Among the infected patients, 5% or more were in critical condition and were located in intensive care units. When could the public see ending of this epidemic become a common concern. We used computer model simulation to show effects of .

To make things simple, restrictions of patients' activities (including in-hospital treatment, cabin hospital stay, and in-house surveillance) were represented as personal activity index PAI.\n\nRead, Jonathan's preprint work showed a R0 to be 3.6-4.0 [3] . In our simulation study, data Till 11 th February 2020, more than 154 medical teams, 18700 healthcare personels were sent to Wuhan. A whole population body temperature monitoring program was also undertaken to identify fever patients. And local CDC announced to stop using time consuming RNA test as common diagnosis standard. Local residencies were locked down to minimize inter people transmission.\n\nHow these measures would affect disease spreading is still not knowing. So we simulated the effects by set PAI from 0.9 to 0. PAI = 0.9 means no change in current people behavior while PAI = 0 means total grounded (include hospital stay and in-house surveillance).\n\nWith simulated data, we found that: .

We found that new daily patients number seem to stay in plateau when PAI =0.3.\n\nWhen PAI reduced to 0.2, a decline in daily new patient could be seen. If PAI could be restricted to 0.1, an ideal state of zero new daily patient would show up at the end of period 3.\n\n1. COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. It can cause strong inter people transmission. Enormous difficulties could be anticipated if not contained in early stage.\n\n2. 5% of COVID-19 patients need intensive care. This will put great burden on the shoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements.\n\n3. Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. And long-term effect relates to how well Wuhan fulfill this task.\n\n4. An early detecting, reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to prevent future unknown infectious disease.\n\nA respiratory disease spreading involves numerous factors. This simulation model uses only arbitrary data to make the calculation. And also, parameters are simplified to make the calculation faster, the results may be varying from real data. The model should be modified using actual data in order to get more accurate results.\n\n.
