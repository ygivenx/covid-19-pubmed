{"title": "Peptide Mimicrying Between SARS Coronavirus Spike Protein and Human Proteins Reacts with SARS Patient Serum", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nis a new emerging infectious disease,  which was first reported in China in 2002\nand was rapidly spreading all over the world in 2003 [1, 2]. The disease was\ntransmitted by droplets and close contact. Patients develop persistent fever, dry cough, progressive\nradiographic changes of chest, and lymphopenia once infected. Despite\ntreatment, about 10\u201315% of the patients would die due to the acute respiratory\ndistress [3\u20136]. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was isolated from\nSARS patients [7\u20139]. SARS-CoV is a positive-stranded RNA virus with an envelop.\nThe genome of SARS-CoV is around 29,727 nucleotides in length. The sequence was\nannotatedin silico [10].\nComparative genomic studies using the in silico annotated proteins have\nsuggested that SARS virus belongs to a new group of coronavirus.\n\nAccording to the genomic sequence of\nSARS-CoV, it is predicted that there are several structural proteins can be\nproduced by SARS-CoV including spike (S), envelop (E), membrane (M), and\nnucleocapsid. Spike protein is very important in the binding and fusion of\ncoronavirus to the host cells [11, 12]. The S protein of SARS-CoV has 1255 amino\nacids in length and 23 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The amino\nterminus of the SARS-CoV S protein contains a short type 1 signal sequence\ncomposed of hydrophobic amino acids that are presumably removed during\ncotranslational transport through the endoplasmic reticulum. The carboxyl\nterminus consists of a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail rich in\ncysteine residues. The majority of protein (residues 12\u20131195) is outside the virus\nparticle, which can be divided into amino-terminal S1 and carboxyl-terminal S2\ndomain. The S1 domain (residues 12\u2013672) binds to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while the\nS2 domain is responsible for membrane fusion [13\u201315]. Monoclonal\nantibodies against S1 domain can block the receptor binding and contain potent\nneutralization activity against SARS-CoV [16]. However, peptides derived\nfrom S2 domain can also inhibit SARS-CoV infection [12].\n\nMolecular mimicry, which is defined as similar structures shared by\nmolecules from dissimilar genes or by their protein products, is a\ngeneral strategy for pathogens to infect host cells and has been proposed as a pathogenic mechanism for autoimmune disease [17].\nTherefore, identification of the molecular mimic regions of pathogen may be\nhelpful to understand the disease induced by that pathogen. At present, it is\nunclear whether molecular mimicry occurs between SARS-CoV S proteins and human\npeptides. We have approached this question using computer to analyze the\nsequence of spike protein of SARS-CoV and select regions that share the sequence\nhomology with human proteins. The criteria for the selection of potential\nregions include antigenic analysis and surface accessibility. In this study, we\nfind that several regions of the S protein share sequence homology with human\nproteins. Synthetic peptides, which represent some of these regions, were\nsynthesized to understand their roles in SARS-CoV infection.\n\nPublically available human and coronavirus genome sequences at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Md, USA)\nwere used for in silicoprediction. Algorithms predicting immunogenicity, second\nstructure prediction, protein topology analysis, and hydrophobicity were\nconducted to design the tested peptides. Immunogenic viral peptides were\ncalculated based on the algorithm developed by Kolaskar and Tongaonkar [18]. The\nalgorithm is based on a table constructed from the occurrence of amino acid\nresidues in experimentally known antigenic epitopes. The reported accuracy of the method is about\n75% [18]. In silico secondary structural analyses of spike protein were\nperformed based on PHD [19] and PREDATOR [20] algorithms. Protein topology\nprediction was based on the algorithm developed by TMHMM [21]. Hydrophobicity of the peptides was calculated\nbased on the algorithm HMOMENT [22]. Similarity searches between S protein and\nhuman genome database were performed by using BLASTP [23] with BLOSUM 62. Extra amino acid residues were added at either\nN- or C-terminus to keep the hydrophobic amino acid content below 50%.\nPeptides with high hydrophobicity are difficult to be tested in biochemical experiments\nsince most of in vitro assays\nare conducted in aqueous buffers. Also,\non average, one charged residue is added for every five amino acids. Multiple antigen peptides were synthesized by\nCytoMol Corp (Mountain View, Calif, USA). In addition, bradykinin and\nangiotensin I (Ang I) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo, USA).\n\nSARS patient sera were collected by the Center for Disease Control, Department of\nHealth (Taipie, Taiwan) from March to June, 2003. Diagnosis of SARS was based on the clinicalcriteria\nestablished by the World Health Organization (WHO). Patients with\nSARS-CoV were confirmed by laboratory methods, including viral antigen detection,\nRT-PCR, and serologic methods. Ten SARS patient sera collected at the convalescent stage (\u226520 days after disease onset)  were included in this study. Ten\nnormal sera from healthy\nindividuals were used as controls.\n\nAntibodies against peptides in human sera were detected by solid-phase capture technique\nusing individual peptide-coated plates. ELISA plate was coated with or without 50 \u03bcL \npeptides (100 \u03bcg/mL) per well and blocked by 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.05% Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\nfor 1 hour at room temperature. Test\nserum samples were 1:100 diluted and added to the plate for 2 hours at room\ntemperature. After incubation, the ELISA plate was washed with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS for three times. The\nbound antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase- (HRP-) conjugated antihuman\nimmunoglobulin antibodies (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo, USA) and peroxidase substrate,\nTMB (Promega, Madison, Wiss, USA). The absorbance was measured using the Vmax microplate\nreader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, Calif, USA) at 450 nm.\nAntibodies against peptides in mouse sera were assayed by ELISA as in human\nsera except HRP-conjugated antimouse immunoglobulin antibodies (Sigma Aldrich)\nwas used to detect bound antibodies.\n\nHuman lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and Vero cells were grown in DMEM supplemented\nwith 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamate, and 50 ng/mL gentamycin. Cells were incubated in CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. For immunofluorescent microscopy\nobservation, monolayers of A549 cells were cultured on sterile glass slides\nbefore the experiment.\n\nSix- to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were used in this study. These mice were\noriginally purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me, USA) and bred in\nthe Laboratory Animal Center, National Cheng Kung University (Tainan, Taiwan).\nSynthetic peptides (1 mg/mL) were emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant\nand injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice. Mice were boosted with the\nsame peptide in PBS (50 \u03bcg/mouse) intraperitoneally two weeks\nafter priming. Sera were collected from the axially plexus of the mice at\ndifferent time intervals and tested for the presence of antibody against\npeptides by ELISA as mentioned above. Significant increase of antibody titer (greater\nthan 4 folds) against immunized-peptide was found in mouse hyperimmune sera as\ncompared to normal sera after boosting.\n\nMouse hyperimmune sera against peptide D08 were incubated with A549 cells \nat 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. After washing\nthree times with PBS, cells were incubated with 1 mL of 1 \u03bcg/mL FITC-conjugated antimouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch\nLaboratories Inc., West Grove, Pa, USA) at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour and washed again with PBS. The immunofluorescent stain of cells was\nobserved by fluorescent microscopy.\n\nProteins in the cell lysate of A549 were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE\nand transferred to nitrocellulose sheets as described previously [24]. Proteins\nrecognized by normal or peptide D08 hyperimmune mice sera were detected using\nHRP-conjugated antimouse immunoglobulin antibodies (Sigma Aldrich) and\nsubstrate.\n\nVero E6 (4\u00d7104) and A549 cells (5\u00d7103) were incubated with\ndifferent doses of synthetic peptides as indicated for 72 hours. Cell\nproliferation was detected using commercial XTT assay (Roche Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, Ind, USA).\n\nThe IL-8 production was assessed by commercial ELISA kits (R&D systems, Minneapolis,\nMinn, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, A549 cells (1\u00d7105) were cultured alone or with different doses of peptides for 48\nhours. Culture supernatants were collected after incubation, added to precoated\nELISA plates, and incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. Plates were washed four times\nwith the washing buffer. The bound IL-8 was detected by HRP-conjugated\nantibodies and substrate. The developed color was read by the Vmax microplate\nreader (Molecular Devices, Calif, USA). The concentration of IL-8 was calculated\naccording to the standard curve.\n\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). The levels of\nsignificance for the differences between groups were analyzed using Student's t-test. A value of P < .05 was considered to be significant.\n\nThe whole amino acid\nsequence of spike protein was analyzed to find out the potential immunogenic\nregions and the regions shared sequence homology with human proteins, which is defined\nas the pathogenic regions. As shown in Figure 1, there are 4 pathogenic\nregions. Region 1 (residues 199\u2013254), region 2 (residues 658\u2013715), region 3\n(residues 893\u2013951), and region 4 (residues 1127\u20131184) have shared sequence homology\nwith hydroxyacid oxidase, human golgi autoantigen, Angrgm-52, and pallidin,\nrespectively. Among these regions, region 3 with homology to human Angrgm-52 has\nthe highest score (with 34% identities and 48% similarity of conservative\nsubstitutions). Its sequence comparison with angrgm-52 is shown in Figure 2(a).\nIn addition, because des-Arg bradykinin and Ang I are the substrates for ACE2 [25], we also compared the sequence of S protein against bradykinin (RPPGFSPFR) and Ang I (DRVYIHPFHL) and\nfound that residues 490\u2013502 (GYQPYRVVVLSFEE) of S protein showed sequence homology with bradykinin as\nindicated by bold letters here and in Figure 2(b). The identity score is 27%; and\nthe similarity score from conservative substitutions is 36%.\n\nEleven peptides (D01\u2013D11, see Table 1), which represent those pathogenic regions were\nsynthesized as well as bradykinin and Ang I were tested to see whether those peptides\ncan be recognized by SARS patients' sera.\nThe peptides were designed based on the algorithms predicting immunogenicity,\nsecond structure, protein topology, and hydrophobicity. Our goal is to select for peptides with high\nimmunogenicity, with location on the protein surface, and with low hydrophobicity. The designed peptide sequences were\nsynthesized and tested with clinical samples of SARS patient sera. A significant increase of SARS patients' sera\nbinding to peptide D01, D07, and D08 was found as compared to the binding of\nnormal sera (see Figure 3).\n\nTo test whether synthetic peptides D01, D07, and D08 can induce antibodies crossreacted with\nhuman proteins, we immunized mice with these peptides to generate hyperimmune\nsera against these peptides. We found hyperimmune sera against D08 can bind to\nthe cytoplasmic region of human A549 cells as demonstrated by immunofluorescent\nstain (see Figure 4). Using Western blot analysis, hyperimmune sera against D08\ncould recognize more bands in A549 cell lysate as compared to normal mice sera\n(see Figure 5). In addition, hyperimmune sera against D07, but not D01, showed\nsimilar crossreactivity to A549 cells as hyperimmune sera against D08 did (data\nnot shown).\n\nTo test whether synthetic peptides D10, indeed, can induce antibodies crossreactive with\nbradykinin and Ang I, we immunized mice with D10 peptides to generate\nhyperimmune sera against this peptide. Significant increase of antibodies\nagainst D10 was found in D10 hyperimmune sera, which could crossreact with\nbradykinin, but not with Ang I-coated plates (see Figure 6).\n\nTo understand whether D10 has similar biological activity as Ang I, we incubated\nVero cells and lung epithelial A549 cells with D10, Ang 1, or control peptide D11. \nBoth Vero and A549 cells were induced to proliferate in the presence of D10 and\nAng I but not the control peptide (see Figure 7). In addition, D10 and Ang I could\nalso induce chemokine IL-8 production of A549 cells (see Figure 8).\n\nIn this study, we have identified four\npathogenic regions of SARS-CoV S protein which share sequence homology with\ndifferent human proteins. Among them, pathogenic region 3 (residues 893\u2013941),\nwhich shares sequence homology with Angrgm-52 (GenBank accession no. AAL62340), a\nnovel gene upregulated in human mesangial cells stimulated by angiotensin II, may\ndeserve further investigation. Peptides D07 and D08 of this region were\nrecognized by the sera of SARS patient indicating that this region is\nimmunogenic and can be recognized by the immune system during SARS-CoV\ninfection. Murine hyperimmune sera against peptides D07 or D08 were able to\nbind to recombinant S2 but not S1 domain of S protein (data not shown). In\naddition, hyperimmune sera against D07 or D08 also bounded to the cytoplasmic region of A549 cells\nand recognized several proteins in the A549 cell lysate. These results indicate\nthat regions represented by D07 and D08 are immunogenic and may induce\nautoantibodies. However, further study is required to understand the biological\nfunction of these regions and the role of their antibodies in the pathogenesis\nof SARS-CoV infection.\n\nIn addition to D07 and D08 peptides, we also noticed that D10\npeptide which represents residues 490\u2013502 of S1 domain contained some\ninteresting activities. The D10 peptide, which shared sequence homology with\nbradykinin, was able to generate antibodies crossreactive with bradykinin. In addition,\nD10 peptide could stimulate A549 to produce IL-8 and proliferation as Ang I did.\nThese results suggest that the region of D10 in S protein may bind to Ang I receptor, ACE2, and\nmay be involved in the binding of SARS-CoV to ACE2. This is consistent with the\nprevious report, which indicates that residues 318\u2013510 of S1 domain can bind to ACE2 [25] and is similar to\nthe receptor binding domain of the HCoV-229E, which is within a fragment\ncontaining residues 407 to 547 [26]. Therefore, region 490\u2013502 of S1 domain may\nbe involved in the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV.\n\nIn summary, our results suggest that molecular mimicry occurs between\nSARS-CoV and host proteins. Motifs shared sequence homology with host proteins of\nSARS-COV may be involved in the binding and fusion of SARS-CoV to host cells. Antibody against these motifs may contain\nneutralization activity against SARS-CoV infection or participate in the\nimmunopathogenesis induced by SARS-CoV. \nAs reported previously, SARS-CoV, like influenza, can inhibit the host's\ncorticosteroid stress response via a molecular mimicry strategy [27]. Our studies on the mimicry motifs of S protein, which is involved in the virus, entry may provide alternative approaches to disrupt the infection of SARS-CoV, similar to the previous studies on the virus entry \n[28, 29]."}
