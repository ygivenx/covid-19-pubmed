{"title": "Reply to \"Statins may decrease the Fatality Rate of MERS Infection\"", "body": "S ince the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) on the Arabian Peninsula in 2012, there has been a steady stream of MERS cases geographically focused in the Middle East, indicating that either zoonotic transmission from camel to human or person-to-person transmission likely takes place on a frequent basis (1) . As reaffirmed by the recent MERS outbreak in South Korea, highly pathogenic coronaviruses are capable of causing epidemics affecting hundreds of individuals as a result of sustained person-to-person transmission in nosocomial settings that can be linked to a single traveler who became an index patient (2) . Currently, the best public health strategy to circumvent sustained coronavirus transmission in an outbreak situation is to quarantine individuals who have a history of contact with confirmed cases of MERS. In the most recent outbreak in South Korea, this led to the isolation and monitoring of more than 16,000 individuals, a feat that may not be economically or logistically feasible in future outbreaks (2) . Due to the diversity and presence of prepandemic zoonotic coronaviruses in bat populations, we may expect the continual reemergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses related to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), or other CoV strains to be a future risk to global public health (3, 4) . There is clearly a need for coronavirus-specific medical countermeasure strategies against these respiratory pathogens, as studies indicate that general antiviral medications like interferon and ribavirin are ineffective in MERS or SARS patients (5, 6) .\n\nYuan suggests in a comment on our recent paper (7, 8) that immunomodulatory therapeutic administration of an early, high dose of statins to treat acute MERS or SARS patients should be an experimental course of treatment. The author anticipates that treatment with statins would inhibit MyD88 signaling and downstream NF-B responses, predicting an inhibition of inflammatory responses that would lead to improved disease outcomes in MERS patients. Although there is a linkage in MERS and SARS patient samples between aberrant signaling of interferonstimulated genes or cytokines and severe coronavirus-induced disease, innate immune signaling is still required for an effective immune response that results in less severe disease following coronavirus infection (9, 10) . While testing drugs like statins that are already know to be safe for human use is an attractive concept, there is no evidence that the combination of attenuated MyD88 and NF-B signaling would improve disease outcome compared to the outcome using NF-B-inhibiting drugs, which do increase survival in mouse models of SARS-CoV infection (11) . Importantly, the efficacy of NF-B inhibitors, statins, or other therapeutics should be rigorously evaluated in more vulnerable agedmouse models which replicate the increased severity of coronavirus disease seen in elderly humans (12) .\n\nOur study and others indicate that, in animal models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection, the aberrant signaling stemming from a lack of either Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor TRIF or MyD88 leads to severe lung disease or death (7, 13, 14) . If\n\nMyD88 signaling was largely repressed by the use of statins in MERS patients, this could lead to exacerbated compensatory signaling by other innate immune factors, resulting in a poor disease outcome in coronavirus patients. Of critical importance is that the absence of these central TLR adaptor molecules results in increased viral loads that persist for longer periods of time than in wild-type mice following SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection (7, 13, 14) . Currently, high viral titers during the acute phase of infection are thought to be a potential factor that increases the likelihood of person-to-person transmission of highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Caution must be used when weighing potential therapeutic options that may increase the likelihood of the spread of these viruses.\n\nImmunomodulatory drugs have great appeal as potential antiviral medications, due to the promise of broad-spectrum therapeutics that may be suitable against a number of different pathogens or maladies, depending on the downstream inflammatory gene expression profile. However, while there is a great need for treatment options for highly pathogenic coronaviruses that are already known to be safe in humans, we must temper our hope for these drugs against the potential of these immunomodulatory agents to cause more severe disease or increased transmission in MERS patients. Reliance on data from cell culture experiments is not likely to yield helpful assessments of drug efficacy against highly pathogenic coronaviruses, as ribavirin and interferon are both highly effective against coronavirus infection in vitro but not in human patients (5, 6) . The recent development of small-animal models of MERS-CoV infection offers a viable platform to test larger numbers of antiviral therapeutics and will be of critical importance in the development of medical countermeasure strategies against MERS or other emergent highly pathogenic coronaviruses (14, 15) . As we now know, the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak in the Middle East has the potential to spread elsewhere, indicating that there is a critical need for basic research on highly pathogenic coronaviruses and that applied studies on potential therapeutic options could make significant contributions to global public health."}
