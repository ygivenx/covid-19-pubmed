{"title": "Evidence of translation efficiency adaptation of the coding regions of the bacteriophage lambda", "body": "Because of a major advantage of being a diverse group of easily manipulated viruses, bacteriophages have various potential uses both in fundamental research and in various biotechnological and biomedical applications. For example, they are used as vehicles for vaccines (both DNA and protein), for the detection of pathogenic bacterial strains, and as a display system for many proteins and antibodies.1\u20134 Furthermore, phages were also suggested to be used as biocontrol agents in agriculture and petroleum industry, and as alternatives to antibiotics in the case of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. In addition, they often serve as model organisms in molecular evolution studies.1\u20134 Therefore, understanding the way the viral fitness is encoded in the genetic material of bacteriophages (or other type of viruses) is an important and challenging mission that may potentially contribute to all biomedical disciplines.1\u20134\n\nDeciphering the regulatory information encoded in the genomes of phages or other viruses, and the relation between the nucleotides composition of the coding regions and the viral fitness is a very challenging mission, which was tackled, in the recent years, by various researchers.5\u201313 Among others, it was suggested that ribosome profiling, which enables the large in vivo genome wide monitoring of ribosome state at a resolution of single nucleotide, is a very useful tool for deciphering the coding complexity of viral (and other organisms) genomes. Specifically, it was shown that ribosome profiling enables detecting novel (possibly very short) coding regions and estimate the translation status of various open reading frames.5\u20139\n\nHere, we focus on the Bacteriophage lambda which is a well-known and studied member of the Siphoviridae family of double-stranded DNA viruses in the Caudovirales order (also known as \u2018tailed bacteriophages\u2019 due to their characteristic form). During its lifecycle this phage either resides within the genome of its Escherichia coli host through lysogeny or enters into a lytic phase (which lasts \u223c25 min) during which it produces progeny viral particles, and kills and lyses the cell (see for example14,15). The genome size of the bacteriophage lambda is \u223c50 kb nt and includes 66 known genes that were analysed in this study. These genes can be divided into two groups, \u2018early\u2019 and \u2018late\u2019 according to the stages in the lytic phase when their expression is dominant.9\n\nThe specific aim of this study is at exploring the way in which translation efficiency related information is encoded on a synonymous level in the coding regions of genes that are expressed during different bacteriophage lambda development stages (i.e. 0\u201320 min after the beginning of the lytic phase). Some previous studies shed some light on specific elements related to this topic. For example, a recent study by Liu et al.9 employed ribosome profiling to study the progress of bacteriophage lambda gene expression during phage development and showed that the known genes are expressed in a predictable fashion; in addition many previously unknown potential open reading frames were detected. Other studies focused on different aspects of viral translation (and lifecycle in general) regulation that has a significant effect on shaping viral genomes, such as: secondary structures within viral transcripts (mainly in untranslated regions16,17 but also within coding regions18\u201320) and evolutionary pressure on synonymous codons usage bias.21\u201325\n\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study aiming to perform a comprehensive, large scale analysis of different types of genomic synonymous information related to regulation of translation efficiency in all coding regions of a bacteriophage lambda, during different stages of its development. In particular, basing on the analysis of ribosome profiling data,9 we demonstrated, for the first time, the condition specific adaptation of the bacteriophage codons in early/late genes to the intra-cellular E. coli environment during the different stages of phage development.\n\nRibosome footprint sequences were obtained from9 (GSE47509, induction 0\u201320 min). We trimmed the poly-A adaptors from the reads using Cutadapt26 (version 1.8.3), and utilized Bowtie27 (version 1.1.1) to map them to the E. coli-lambda transcriptome. The location of the A-site was approximated by an 11-nt shift from the 5\u02b9 end of the aligned read. This shift maximized the correlation between MTDR (described below) and the observed read densities per E. coli gene. Further details related to the ribo-seq processing appear in the supplementary methods.\n\nQuantifies the adaptation of the codons of a coding region to the tRNA pool. Technical details regarding this measure appear in the supplementary.\n\nWe began this analysis by reconstructing ribosome profiles for E. coli and Bacteriophage Lambda expressed genes and performing normalization described in the supplementary data. The normalization enables measuring the relative time a ribosome spends translating each codon in a specific gene relative to other codons in it, whilst considering the total number of codons in the gene, resulting in its normalized footprint count (NFC)30:\nNFCj=RCj(1J-40)RC21+RC22+\u2026+RCJ-20,j=21\u2026J-20,\nwhere J is the number of codons in the gene and j is the index of a codon.\n\nWe generate histogram of NFC for each codon. Each NFC distribution describes the probability (Pi) (y-axis) of observing each of the codon\u2019s NFC values (x-axis) in the ORFs of the analysed organism.\n\nTo estimate the typical decoding time of each codon based on NFC distributions, we used a novel statistical model,17 which takes into consideration the skewed nature of the NFC distribution. The aim is to describe the NFC histogram of each codon as an output of a random variable which is a sum of two random variables: a normal and an exponential variable. Thus, the distribution of this new random variable includes three parameters, and is called EMG distribution.30 In this model, the typical codon decoding time was described by the normal distribution with two parameters: mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3); the \u03bc parameter represents the location of the mean of the theoretical Gaussian component that should be obtained if there are no phenomena such as pauses/biases/ribosomal traffic jams; \u03c3 represents the width of the Gaussian component. The exponential distribution has one parameter \u03bb which represents the skewness of the NFC distribution due to reasons such as ribosomal jamming caused by codons with different decoding times, extreme pauses, incomplete halting of the ribosomes and biases in the experiment. The EMG is defined as follows:\nfx;\u03bc,\u03c3,\u03bb=\u03bb2e\u03bb22\u03bc+\u03bb\u03c32-2xerfc\u03bc+\u03bb\u03c32-x2\u03c3,erfcx=1-erf\u2061x= \u222bx\u221ee-t2dt.\n\nWe used the maximum likelihood criterion to estimate these three parameters for each codon based on E. coli ribosome profiling data by fitting the suggested model to the NFC distribution. 1/\u03bc was defined to be the TDR of each codon.\n\nIn order to optimize the TDR to E. coli\u2019s read counts in every time condition; we removed outliers from the NFC distribution of each codon in the following way: for every codon (in every time condition), and for each NFCi point related to the codon, we calculated the Pi to see value larger or equal to NFCi based on the pdf fitted to the codon (EMG distribution). Let Ni denote the number of measurements of the codon NFC based on the data; we removed points in which the result of pi*Ni was lower than 0.001.\n\nA measure which estimates the translation elongation efficiency of the entire gene as a geometric average of TDRs of its codons: \nMTDR=e(1/L)\u2211l=1L log \u2061(TDRil),\n\nwhere i is an index of a codon and L is the gene length in codon unit.\n\nWe computed the MTDR based on the ribosome profiling data of the E. coli (TDRs are effected by translation factors which are common to the host and the bacteriophage). Thus, it should not be sensitive to the low number of bacteriophage reads at the first time points.\n\nQuantifies the relative differences in mean MTDR values of early and late gene: RTEC = mean MTDRE -mean MTDRL(mean MTDRE +mean MTDRL) where E and L sigh for early and late genes.\n\nMinimum free folding energy (MFE) is a thermodynamic energy involved in maintaining a secondary structure available to perform physical work whilst being released, and thus is characterized by non-positive values. mRNA secondary structure is believed to be in the most stable conformation when minimum amount of free energy is exerted (the MFE obtains the most negative value). The local MFE-profiles were constructed by applying a 39 nt length sliding window to a genomic sequence: in each step the MFE of a local subsequence enclosed by the corresponding window was calculated by Vienna (v. 2.1.9) package RNAfold31 function with default parameters (see, also16,32). This function predicts the MFE and the associated secondary structure for the input RNA sequence using a dynamic programming based on the thermodynamic nearest-neighbor approach (the Zucker algorithm).33\n\nFirst, all the genes in the bacteriophage genome were lined up according to their start codon and MFE-profiles were calculated for each coding region together with 40-nt up-stream the start codon sequence from the 5\u02b9 UTR. Then, all the genes in the genome were lined up according to their end codon and MFE profiles were calculated for each coding region together with 40-nt down-stream the end codon from the 3\u02b9 UTR.\n\nFor each gene 100 randomized MFE-profiles variants were computed basing on randomized sequences generated by the dinucleotide preserving and codon preserving randomization models (both preserving also the encoded proteins, see section above).16,17,28 We did not change the UTRs in the randomization as in this study we are interested in the coding regions.\n\nThe mean MFE-profile was obtained by averaging the MFE-profiles of all genes (in a position wise manner). In a similar manner, 100 randomized mean MFE-profiles were computed by grouping the randomized MFE-profiles of all genes in 100 groups, each group contains a different variant for each gene, and then averaging the profiles in each group in a position-wise manner.\n\nIn order to assess the statistical significance of the folding strength at a particular position in a sequence, we compared the mean MFE values at this position with the mean MFE values in the corresponding position in each one of the randomized variants by calculating an empiric P-value\u2014a proportion of the randomized values as extreme as in the wild type. Positions with MFE related P-value <0.05 were defined as selected for strong/weak folding.\n\nIn addition, we computed mean MFE values for each gene over all windows (by averaging the values in the corresponding MFE-profiles) and compared them to the mean MFE values obtained from the corresponding 100 randomized profiles. For each gene we calculated its mean MFE value and an average of 100 mean MFE values from its randomized variants; the distributions of the wildtype and randomized mean MFE values of different genes were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Early and late genes were analysed separately.\n\nThis measure is based on the assumption that evolution shapes the organismal coding sequences (and other part of the gene) to improve their interaction with the intra-cellular gene expression machinery. Since these interactions are mediated via binding of the gene expression machinery (e.g. translation/transcription factors, RNAP, ribosomes, RNA binding proteins, etc.) to the genetic material (DNA or RNA), the genetic material tend to have optimized binding sites (which are sub-sequences of nucleotides). We also expect that binding sites will appear in many coding regions and that more optimal binding sites will tend to appear more times in the genome. Thus, if longer substrings of a genome tend to appear in a certain organism\u2019s coding sequence, it suggests that this coding sequence is more optimized to the intra-cellular gene expression machinery and thus it is probably more highly expressed. Here, we computed the ARS index for each bacteriophage gene in comparison to the host (E. coli) and in comparison to the rest of the viral genes.\n\nThe algorithm of ARS index is based on the following steps: (i) For each position i in the coding sequence S find the longest substring Sij that starts in that position, and also appears in at least one of the coding sequences of the reference genome (E. coli/viral). (ii) Let |S| denote the length of a sequence S; the ARS index of S is the mean length of all the substrings Sij:ARS=\u2211sij|s|.\n\nRare codons in a reference set of coding sequences were defined as codons with the relative synonymous frequency <0.2. Three reference sets were used: E. coli coding sequences, bacteriophage early coding sequences, bacteriophage late coding sequences.\n\nA rare codons score (RCS) for a specific early/late/E. coli coding sequence with respect to a reference set of all early/all late/all E. coli coding sequences is defined as a percentage of amino acids in that sequence encoded by a rare codon out of all amino acids that are encoded by at least one rare codon in the corresponding reference set (if an AA is not encoded by codons that are rare in the reference set we exclude it from the analysis):\nRCS= 1N\u2211cIc, Ic= 1, RSCFc<0.20, otherwise ,\nwhere the sum is over all codons c that have at least one rare synonymous codon that appears in the reference set and N is the total number of such codons.\n\nIn order to control the influence of the difference of genes length between early and late groups we sampled the late genes so that the average length of both genes groups is the same. The sampling was of random contiguous blocks of codons from the late genes and according to distributions of early genes.\n\nAt the first step (Fig. 2A), we aimed at comparing the synonymous codons usage in E. coli and bacteriophage early and late coding sequences. To this end, for each coding sequence, we computed its relative synonymous codon frequencies (RSCF)\u2014a 61-dimensional vector representing each codon (except the stop codons) by its frequency in that sequence normalized relative to the frequencies of other synonymous codons coding for the same amino acid (Methods). Our analysis demonstrated that the early and late genes tend to be clustered into two significantly separated (P-value <0.01) clusters according to their synonymous codons usage. In addition synonymous codon usage in both groups of viral genes was found to be significantly different (P-value <0.01) from that of E. coli (Fig. 2A; Methods). These results provide evidence that different sets of synonymous codons for early vs. late genes are selected in the course of viral evolution and may be related to the optimization of the viral fitness.\n\n\nHaving shown that early and late viral genes have a significantly different composition of synonymous codons which may be associated with various features of their expression, we would like to focus one such feature, and understand the translation elongation efficiency of bacteriophage coding regions and how it behaves in different stages of the viral lytic cycle.\n\nTo this aim we employed a condition specific measure of translation elongation30 to study the elongation speed of viral codons/genes during the different steps of phage development. This measure, called MTDR, is based on the estimation of a typical codon decoding rate (TDR) of each codon at each time point30 based on the ribosome profiling data9 and enables ranking codons and coding regions according to their elongation rate whilst controlling for other factors, such as initiation rates and mRNA levels (see details in the Methods section).\n\nAt the first step, we wanted to check whether the bacteriophage coding regions undergo any selection for optimizing translation elongation. To this end, at every time condition we computed two average MTDR values, for early and late genes separately, and compared them to the average MTDR values obtained for corresponding randomized variants that maintain the wild type amino acid content and the dinucleotide distribution (Methods). As can be seen in Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1, the average MTDR of both groups is significantly higher than expected from the random model in all time points (early: p <0.01; late: p <= 0.04). These results suggest that, indeed, translation elongation efficiency is maintained along the lytic cycle of infection and may be a factor that drives codon evolution in both groups of the bacteriophage genes.\n\nAt the next step, to compare the translation elongation efficiency between early and late genes, we looked at the RTEC which quantifies the relative differences in average MTDR values of two gene groups: more positive RTEC values mean that early genes are more efficient than the late genes and vice versa, more negative RTEC values mean that late genes are more efficient than the early ones; RTEC values close to zero mean that the two groups of genes have a similar translational efficiency (Methods). Figure 2C describes the RTEC as a function of time (0\u201320 min). As can be seen, the relative efficiency of elongation of early genes (in comparison to the late genes) is high at the beginning and become lower with time (P-value = 0.04; based on spearman correlation). These results demonstrate that translation elongation efficiency of the early genes is relatively higher at the early stages of the bacteriophage development (when they are expressed) and the translation elongation efficiency of the late genes is relatively higher at the late stages of the bacteriophage development (when they are expressed).\n\n\nFigure 2D describes the per codon correlation between the TDR and RSCF for the two bacteriophage gene groups (early and late) and the E. coli genes at different time points. As can be seen, the correlation is higher and significant for the first time points in the case of the E. coli and early bacteriophage genes. For the late genes, the correlation is significant only at the initial points. The fact that the correlation between RSCF and TDR in the case of the early viral genes is significant at the initial points supports the conjecture that the relative codon decoding times change during the viral development; this is probably related, among others, to the fact that the bacteriophage affects extensively the gene expression in the cell.\n\nThe lower correlations at time 2 does not seems to be relate to trivial biases/problems with the experiment as the number of reads in the E. coli (used for inferring the MTDR) is similar to the number of read in the different time points; in addition, the number of reads mapped to the viral genes is higher than in time 0. Thus, it is possible that the lower correlation is related to a biological phenomenon: e.g. it is possible that in this time point there is (strong) deviation (which is possibly short in time) of the concentration levels of the translation factors in the cell related to the other points; whilst the codon distributions were shaped to fit the other (longer) periods of the bacteriophage development.\n\nPrevious studies demonstrated that that the codon decoding times may be directly influenced by the tRNA levels in the cell (see, for example30).\n\nIn Fig. 2E, we analysed the adaptation of the viral codons to the genomic tRNA copy number in the host at natural conditions (Methods) and found it to be significant in comparison to the randomized variants that maintain the dinucleotides distribution for both early and late gene groups. However, as can be seen in Fig. 2F, the correlation between the TDR and the tAI of different codons is significant but decreases during the viral development stages. These results may suggest that among others the tRNA levels change during the viral development stages, affecting the codon decoding times.\n\nIn addition, we analysed the tendency of early/late bacterial coding sequences to use rare synonymous codons with respect to early/late/bacterial gene groups, respectively (RCS). Supplementary Fig. S2 describes the per condition partial correlation (controlling for gene length) between RCS and mean read counts for the two viral gene groups (early and late) and the E. coli genes. As can be seen, the correlation decreases in the case of the early genes and E. coli genes and increases for late genes. Our analysis demonstrates that early/late genes with rare early/late genes codons tend to be lowly expressed at the early/late stages, respectively.\n\nThe results reported in this section support the conjecture that some of the differences between the early and the late genes are related to the adaptation of viral codons to the intracellular environments in different stages of the phage development. Specifically, we suggest that such adaptation may be result of the fact that the typical decoding times (possibly due to changes in tRNA levels) change during the bacteriophage development.\n\nIn the previous section, we emphasized the importance of the translation elongation efficiency on shaping the codon composition of the Bacteriophage coding regions. In this section, we demonstrate that additional gene expression aspects are also encoded (in parallel) in the coding sequences.\n\nFirst, we examined whether there is a selection for strong/weak local folding in different regions along the genomes (coding regions and flanking UTRs) (Fig. 3A\u2013C). To this end, all early/late genes were aligned to the start codon and average values of a minimal folding energy (MFE) over all genes in each group were predicted within all possible 39-nt length local window. These average MFE values where compared in a position wise manner (Fig. 3A and B) and in average over all positions (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3) to the MFE values expected in random. Positions with significantly strong (more negative MFE) or weak (more positive MFE) folding where identified (Fig. 3A and B) and also global P-value related to the mean average MFE values was computed (Fig. 3C). To make sure that the obtained folding signals were not mainly an indirect consequence of codon usage bias and/or selection for specific dinucleotide contents not related to mRNA folding we employed two randomization models, one designed to maintain both the encoded protein and the distribution of dinucleotides and the other designed to maintain both the encoded protein and the codon usage bias (see the Methods section for more details).\n\n\nOur analysis suggests that in general, there is an evidence of evolutionary selection for strong folding in the coding region of the bacteriophage in the case of the late genes but not in the case of the early genes and this is not related to very specific region along the coding region (Fig. 3A\u2013C).This selection is manifested by lower average MFE values than expected in random (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3) and a higher number of positions selected for strong folding (27 in the early and 123 in the late genes in Fig. 3A; 37 in the early and 144 in the late genes in Fig. 3B).\n\nLocal genomic regions (both in UTRs and in coding sequences) selected for strong mRNA folding may be related to various functional mRNA structures in the coding regions that effect the viral life cycle16,17,34; specifically, it is possible that the mRNA structures are more important in the late genes due to less canonical regulatory aspects needed at the later phases of viral life. Interestingly, we found that in the case of the late genes there is an evidence of selection for weak folding at the 5\u02b9 end of the coding regions, suggesting that there is a significant evolutionary pressure for improved initiation efficiency.34\n\nSecondly, we performed an analysis with a measure that detects long sub-sequences in the viral genome (ARS index) and were able to detect gene expression codes in an unsupervised manner35 (see technical details in the Methods section). Our analysis (Fig. 3D) demonstrates that both in the early and late genes there are significant gene expression codes in the bacteriophage coding regions that cannot be explained by the viral codon frequency or dinucleotide composition. These results suggest that in parallel to single codon adaptations, the bacteriophage coding regions undergoes an evolutionary pressure to include more complex/longer regulatory signals in the coding region. This suggests that additional future studies should be performed on this topic.\n\nThe analyses performed in this study emphasize the way evolution shape the coding region of Bacteriophage Lambda to improve its expression levels and fitness. We demonstrate that evolution shapes the codon content of the Bacteriophage genes to fit them to the dynamic intracellular environment during the Bacteriophage development. Specifically, we show that the codon frequencies of the early and late genes were shaped in a different manner: (i) there is high intra group similarity in codon usage frequencies than inter-group similarities; (ii) the codons frequencies of both groups are significantly different than the codon frequencies of the host; (iii) whilst the decoding rates of both group is higher than expected based on the amino acid content and dinucleotide composition, the mean decoding rate of the early genes is relatively higher/lower than the late genes during the initial/late stages of the viral development, respectively.\n\nThe results reported here demonstrate and suggest that it may be possible to better understand the function of viral genes via the analysis of their codon distribution. They can also promote developing novel approaches for vaccine development and viral therapies: For example, based on the codon frequencies of different viral ORF we may be able to predict if they are early of late genes. In addition, engineering the viral genome such that its decoding rate (e.g. as measured by ribosome profiling) is attenuated may enable generating live attenuated based vaccines; on the other hand, improving the viral decoding rate may contribute to developing efficient oncolytic viruses and contribute towards developing efficient procedures for generating inactivated vaccines.\n\nOur analysis support the conjecture that the that tRNA pool in the host changes during the bactriophage development with a tRNA pool similar to the host pool in natural conditions at the early points but more different than the host natural tRNA pool during the late points (see Fig. 2F). Thus, the accurate measure for estimating the optimization of the codon decoding rates of the bactriophage genes is the TDR and measures based on the genomic tRNA copy number (such as the tAI).\n\nNevertheless, it is important to mention that previous studies suggest that relative levels of tRNAs tend to have high correlation among different conditions and tissues (see for example36,37). This may be related, among others, to the fact that a significant change of tRNA levels ranking may have strong effect on co-translation protein folding (see for example38) and thus a strong effect on the functionality of many proteins, effecting both the host and the bacteriophage. Similar phenomena was observed also in this study\u2014there is significant correlation between codon decoding rates at different time points and the relevant genomic tRNA copy number (see Fig. 2F); however, as mention, this correlation is lower at the later time points.\n\nAt each time point the \u2018optimal\u2019 solution relate to the optimization of translation elongation speed and the optimal allocation of translation factors include using the codons with the highest codon decoding rates (i.e. the ones related to factors such as tRNA molecules that have relatively higher abundance in the cell). Thus, genes undergo selection to have codons similar to the translation factor concentration and this selection is expected to be higher in highly expressed genes (see39,40) in each condition since non-optimality in these genes should have higher effect (in comparison to lowly expressed genes) on the organism/viral fitness; eventually, at early/late stages the early/late genes are expected to have higher mean decoding rate than late/early genes, respectively (as we see in Fig. 2C).\n\nWhilst the codons of the early/late genes are different both groups use all the codons. However, the fact that the two groups of genes have different codons also means that they use a little different set of tRNA molecules\u2014the late genes use tRNA molecules less used by the early genes.\n\nAn interesting topic for future study is measuring the tRNA levels in different time point and an interesting topic for future study will be to perform such measurements to validate and better understand the different codon frequencies of early/late genes.\n\nFinally, whilst this study focused on codon frequencies and its relation to translation elongation our analysis suggest that additional regulatory aspects are encoded in via the local folding of the viral RNA and possibly additional viral genomic motives (longer than singe codon; Fig. 3D); these results and the previous ones demonstrate that the complexity and information content of the Bacteriophage genome is higher than thought before and encourages further studies in this direction."}
