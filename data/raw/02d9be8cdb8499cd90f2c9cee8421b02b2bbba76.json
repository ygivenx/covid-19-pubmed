Can this be more specific -will all be included regardless of significance, or will some elimination procedure be used (and what this is)?

Some more details on data sets: Does Alberta have workplace vaccination? If so are these included in the 'mass vaccination clinics' recorded in Imm/ARI? The SESE and MACAR systems -How many diagnosis codes can be entered in these systems? Are there free text fields too that are not extracted for linkage? ie if a patient sees a GP for their diabetes and an ARI, will both be recorded?

Has validation of these data sources been done? AHCIP: how is socio-economic status determined?\n\nIt would be beneficial if the authors could check over the paper again for editing -eg acute respiratory infection is defined as ARI on page 8 line 147 but is still spelt out on page 11 lines 214-5.\n\nSilvio Tafuri 1. Statistical analysis says 'All covariates will be considered for the adjusted model'. Can this be more specific -will all be included regardless of significance, or will some elimination procedure be used (and what this is)?\n\n\u2022 Response: Yes, all of the covariates are placed in the model regardless of significance. They are being included as they are deemed scientifically important to control for confounding.\n\n2. Will VE estimates be calculated separately for age groups of particular interest ie <5, 65 and over? \u2022 Response: Yes, when we have adequate sample size for a particular season, the VE for those age groups will be estimated.\n\n3. Will time since vaccination be included in the model, given evidence that the vaccine wanes during the season (6-11% per month, Ferdinands CID 2017), and 3 months elapses between vaccination campaigns and peak activity page 7 lines 129-30.\n\n\u2022 Response: Thank you very much for pointing this out. We had omitted an element of time from our list of covariates. Month will be included in the model as the rate of exposure to influenza varies significantly over the season. Approximately two-thirds of all individuals who will receive the vaccine in a particular season do so within the first 2 weeks of the public immunization campaign. Other than in pandemic seasons where there is significant public fear around the time of the peak (such as the 2009/10 influenza season), the rate of immunization drops off rapidly after the first two weeks. Given that the start time for the analysis is one month after the start of the public campaign when the vast majority of vaccinations will be complete, and adjusting for both month and time since vaccination would cause over adjustment in the model, we have chosen to adjust only for month.\n\n\u2022 Response: Deterministic linkage is carried out across the multiple databases. In Alberta, the personal health number (PHN) is a unique identifier used across all provincially funded health care systems. All systems have quality assurance programs in place to ensure that the health record is matched with the correct person. The linkage is then carried out by surveillance analysts in the Ministry of Health. Validation of the PHNs is performed by confirming the sex and date of birth of individuals across the databases.\n\n5. Does Alberta have workplace vaccination? If so are these included in the 'mass vaccination clinics' recorded in Imm/ARI? \u2022 Response: Alberta does have some workplace vaccination clinics and vaccination clinics at universities and other post-secondary educational institutions. While all workplace and educational institutional vaccination clinics are scheduled for eventual inclusion in Imm/ARI, the majority are not at this time. The number of doses of vaccine distributed to these groups is less than 5% of vaccination in Alberta.\n\n6. The SESE and MACAR systems -How many diagnosis codes can be entered in these systems? Are there free text fields too that are not extracted for linkage? ie if a patient sees a GP for their diabetes and an ARI, will both be recorded? Or is there a chance diabetes would be the diagnosis code and ARI would only be recorded in free text (which is not available as far as my reading of the protocol).\n\n\u2022 Response: Up to 25 diagnostic codes are included in the MACAR system and up to 3 diagnostic codes are included in the SESE system. There are no free text fields in either system. If a patient is admitted to a hospital, emergency room or outpatient clinic there are specialized abstractors that code all of the diagnoses given to a patient and include it in the MACAR system, therefore the diabetic patient with ARI you referenced in your question would get both codes. GPs are required to provide at least one diagnostic code for each patient encounter, but are not required to provide more than one. How the patient would be coded would vary depending on the diligence of the GP and which concern was considered the main reason for the visit.\n\n7. Has validation of these data sources been done? \u2022 Response: Yes, there has been significant work to establish the validity of these administrative datasets in Alberta. Please see the following references. A note has been placed in the methods. However, because of the small sample size the confidence interval was large, ranging from 8% to 72%. Some of us have prepared a manuscript (currently under review) that indicates that VE estimates generated using linked health administrative and laboratory data in the province Ontario are comparable to previously published estimates.\n\n8. Laboratory methods must be described in depth.\n\n\u2022 Additional information and one additional reference was provided. \n\nThe methods were tested in the 2018/19 season but were not performed in real time. Implementation of the real-time analyses will occur in the upcoming season. One of the strengths of the method is that it can be implemented quickly whenever required. So at times when there is high concern (such as at the start of the influenza season or in a pandemic) it can be implemented weekly or biweekly, while at times of low concern it may be implemented once or twice a month. A likely schedule for the upcoming season (assuming it is a typical influenza season) would be biweekly until the peak of the influenza season and monthly thereafter. The date range has been updated in this version.\n\nKylie Carville VIDRL at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity REVIEW RETURNED 03-Jul-2019\n\nI would still appreciate some clarity on what 'near real time' is, or what it is expected to be, or a statement that this will be determined by the study protocol. Adding an extra year to the protocol to ensure it is prospective, not retrospective, doesn't address this query. I don't think this is sufficient to block publication, but I do think that clarity in this matter would be appreciated by readers.\n\nMy apologies if our use of the term near-real time was vague. We have revised the paper to indicate that the VE will be estimated every two weeks prior to the peak of the season and estimated every month thereafter. Does that address your concern? Please feel free to contact me at 1-587-635-0613 if it does not."}
