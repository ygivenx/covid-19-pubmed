Mice (n=4 per group) were vaccinated with 10 6 PFU of X-31ca and challenged with 10 6 PFU of RSV A2 2 days later (-2d Vac). Non-vaccinated mice were infected with 10 6 PFU of RSV A2 only (No Vac). After RSV challenge, lungs were obtained daily for 4 days. To investigate CD4 and CD8 T cells subsets, cells obtained from lungs were stained with fluorescence antibodies as presented in the Methods and analyzed by flow cytometry. ( ** P < 0.01 compared with the No Vac control group).\n\nMice (n=4 per group) were vaccinated with 10 6 PFU of X-31ca, and BAL fluids were collected daily for 6 days. To investigate the number of and the percentage of AMs (A) and neutrophils (B), cells obtained from BAL were stained with fluorescence antibodies as presented in the Methods and analyzed by flow cytometry. ( * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 compared with the PBS control group)"}
