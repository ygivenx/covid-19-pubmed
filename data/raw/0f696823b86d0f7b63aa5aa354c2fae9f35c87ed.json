{"title": "Protective and Detrimental Roles for Regulatory T Cells in a Viral Model for Multiple Sclerosis NIH Public Access Author Manuscript", "body": "The precise etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the trigger for the initial demyelinating attack remain elusive, it has been suggested that the immunopathogenesis of MS is triggered by an autoimmune response against CNS antigens and/or a microbial infection, particularly virus infections (29) . Autoreactive antibody and T cell responses can be found in MS patients, which supports an autoimmune etiology (45) . Experimentally, experimental autoimmune (or allergic) encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model that resembles MS histologically, can be induced by sensitization with CNS antigens. On the other hand, an infectious etiology for MS has been considered since its initial descriptions (32) . Direct virus infection of oligodendrocytes can result in demyelination (9) . In addition a viral infection can result in development of autoimmunity either through molecular mimicry between a virus and myelin or through determinant (or epitope) spreading following the destruction of myelin and release of autoantigen (30, 65) . Clinically, the viral etiology of MS has been supported by detection of virus itself or anti-viral immune responses from MS patients (55) . Experimentally, a demyelinating disease can be induced by infection with several viruses, including Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) (47) .\n\nTMEV initially infects neurons during the first 2 weeks post-infection (p.i) (acute stage) and spreads via axonal transport, causing axonal degeneration. During the chronic stage, more than 3 weeks p.i., TMEV infects macrophages and glial cells, causing inflammatory demyelinating lesions similar to the neuropathology found in MS. TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) in susceptible mouse strains, such as SJL/J mice, has been used as a viral model for MS (28) . Moreover, resistant mouse strains, such as C57BL/6 and BALB/c, develop only acute disease without viral persistence or demyelination. Although the precise pathomechanism in TMEV-IDD is unclear, both direct viral infection and immune-mediated pathology (immunopathology) can contribute to demyelination. While TMEV can directly infect and lyse myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, there is also evidence of the involvement of CD4 + T helper (Th1) and Th17 cells, CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, and antibodies in the pathogenesis of TMEV-IDD (8, 15, 18, 35, 42, 43, 56) .\n\nRegulatory T cells (Tregs) are characterized by the expression of CD4, CD25 and the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) (2) . These cells play a central role in protecting an individual from autoimmunity (46) . Tregs can suppress proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 type immune responses, which have been suggested to play a pathogenic role in several immune-mediated diseases and animal models, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), MS, and EAE (24, 44) . Adoptive transfer of Tregs isolated from na\u00efve mice has been shown to ameliorate EAE induced with either active myelin antigen sensitization or passive transfer of myelin-specific T cells (14, 24) . These findings in EAE imply that Tregs could also be beneficial in MS.\n\nOn the other hand, the role of Tregs in viral infections, where tissue damage can be caused by uncontrolled immune responses (immunopathology) or viral replication and persistence, remains relatively unknown (28) . Although Tregs may play a protective role by preventing immunopathology, Tregs can also play a detrimental role by suppressing anti-viral immune responses, which leads to more active viral replication and/or viral persistence. For example, in West Nile virus infection, since the tissue damage is caused by immunopathology, suppression of anti-viral immune responses reduced pathology (26) . In contrast, in Friend virus infection, since the tissue damage is caused by viral replication, suppression of antiviral immune responses by Tregs was detrimental (12) . Thus, we hypothesized that Tregs can be a double-edged sword in TMEV-IDD, since both immunopathology and direct virus infection can contribute to the pathogenesis.\n\nIn TMEV infection, a rapid expansion of Tregs was found in susceptible SJL/J mice but not in resistant C57BL/6 mice after TMEV infection (40) . In TMEV-infected SJL/J mice, administration of anti-CD25 antibody during the acute stage of disease to inactivate Tregs enhanced anti-viral immune responses and reduced disease severity. These results suggest that a differential induction of Tregs between mouse strains may be responsible for susceptibility to TMEV-IDD, where Tregs play a detrimental role in susceptible SJL/J mice. On the other hand, in the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) model of virus-induced demyelinating disease using the neurotropic strain of MHV, adoptive transfer of Tregs was found to decrease immune-mediated demyelination and mortality (1, 54) . These results suggest that clinical application of Treg modulation in viral pathology requires consideration of viral replication kinetics, antiviral immune responses, and immunopathology.\n\nWe have developed a novel method to ex vivo generate approximately 2 \u00d7 10 7 induced Tregs (iTregs) from the spleen of one SJL/J mouse (21) . These iTregs were CD4 + , FOXP3 + , and CD25 + , and can suppress the proliferation of CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cells in vitro. These iTregs have been shown to suppress inflammation in a mouse model of IBD (20) . We tested the role and potential translational application of Tregs in TMEV-IDD by administering iTregs to TMEV-infected mice. Therapeutic iTreg treatment during the chronic stage of disease suppressed inflammation in the CNS of mice. In contrast, early iTreg treatment resulted in exacerbation of acute disease. These results suggest that an efficient Treg-based treatment requires careful consideration of several factors, including viral replication, anti-viral immune responses, immunopathology and the timing of the treatment.\n\nFemale 4-week-old SJL/J and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and Harlan Laboratories, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN), respectively. Animals were maintained on 12/12-hour (h) light/dark cycles in standard animal cages with filter tops under specific pathogen-free conditions in our animal care facility at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC)-Shreveport and given standard laboratory rodent chow and water ad libitum. All experimental procedures involving the use of animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of LSUHSC and performed according to the criteria outlined by the National Institutes of Health.\n\niTregs were induced as previously described (21) . Briefly, a 24-well plate was coated with anti-mouse CD3\u03b5 antibody (Ab) (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) by an overnight incubation with 500 \u03bcl of a 10 \u03bcg/ml solution at 4\u00b0C. Spleens were aseptically removed from mice and mashed through a 74-\u03bcm stainless steel mesh (CX-200, Small Parts Inc., Miami Lakes, FL) and pipetted up and down vigorously to reach a single cell suspension. CD4+ cells were isolated from the suspension using an EasySep\u00ae Negative Selection Mouse CD4+ T Cell Enrichment Kit (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). These cells were resuspended at 5 \u00d7 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Manassas, VA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), 1% L-glutamine (Mediatech), 1% antibiotics (Mediatech), 50 \u03bcM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 100 U/ml recombinant human interleukin (IL)-2 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 20 ng/ml transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and 1 nM all trans retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). The anti-CD3 Ab coated plate was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then the cell solution was added at 1 ml/ well to the plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 4 days. Cells were assessed for purity by flow cytometry. In the absence of TFG-\u03b2 and retinoic acid the cell populations were only 20-40% FOXP3 + .\n\nFc receptors of cells were blocked with anti-CD16/32 Ab (Biolegend, San Diego, CA). Cells were stained with antibodies against CD3 (Biolegend), CD4 (Biolegend), CD8 (Biolegend), CD11c (Biolegend) a dendritic cell marker, B220/CD45R a B cell marker (Biolegend) (17) , F4/80 a macrophage marker (Biolegend), FOXP3 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 (Biolegend), IL-10 (Biolegend), IL-17A (Biolegend), CD25/interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) \u03b1 (Biolegend), and CD49d/\u03b14 integrin (Biolegend). Cells were permeabilized and fixed using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm \u2122 Plus Fixation/Permeabilization Kit. The flow cytometry data was acquired on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using Cellquest Pro (BD Biosciences). For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were incubated with 500 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma-Aldrich), 25 ng/ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) with or without TMEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, and 1 \u03bcl/ml of brefeldin A (GolgiPlug \u2122 , BD Biosciences) for 6 h before staining.\n\nSuppression of CD4 + T cell proliferation was assessed as previously described (10) . iTregs were cultured with 5 \u00d7 10 4 responder CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cells at 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, and 1:50 of iTreg/responder ratios, 10 5 irradiated antigen presenting cells (APCs), and 2.5 \u03bcg concanavalin A (ConA); in a flat bottom 96-well plate at a final volume of 300 \u03bcl/well. APCs were prepared by irradiating splenocytes with 2,000 rads in a model 143 laboratory irradiator (JL Shepherd and Associates, San Fernando, CA). CD4 + CD25 \u2212 (responder) T cells were isolated by first isolating CD4 + T cells using an EasySep\u00ae Negative Selection Mouse CD4 + T Cell Enrichment Kit (Stemcell Technologies), then incubating the CD4 + T cells with biotinylated CD25 antibody (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and streptavidin magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA), and then running the labeled cells through a magnetic column to remove the CD25 + fraction. The iTregs, responder cells, and APCs were cultured together with ConA for 72 h, with the addition of 1 \u03bcCi/well of tritiated [ 3 H]thymidine (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) for the final 24 h. Cells were harvested on Reeves Angel 934AH filters (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) using PHD \u2122 Harvester (Brandel). The incorporated radioactivity was measured by Wallac 1409 Liquid Scintillation Counter (PerkinElmer). All cultures were performed in triplicate and the data was expressed as stimulation indexes (experimental cpm/control cpm).\n\nInduction of iTregs from a na\u00efve mouse was verified with flow cytometry; the iTregs were washed in PBS and resuspended at 4 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml in PBS. Mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 500 \u03bcl of iTregs (2 \u00d7 10 5 cells) either on day 0 (iTreg-early) or 3-4 weeks p.i (iTreg-late). This was the optimal dose that was previously determined in an IBD model (20) . We found that this cell number was also efficacious to all mice, since all iTregtreated mice showed similar changes clinically, pathologically, and immunologically. Mice were infected by intracereberally (i.c.) with 2 \u00d7 10 5 plaque forming units (PFU) of the Daniels (DA) strain of TMEV in a volume of 20 \u03bcl in PBS (60) . Mice were weighed and observed daily for up to 3 months. Clinical signs of neurological disease were evaluated by measuring impairment in the righting reflex, which is a standard scoring system for motor impairment during TMEV infection (38, 53) . Additionally, using the righting reflex test daily does not condition the mice and improve their score (5) . When the proximal end of the mouse's tail is grasped and twisted to the right and then to the left, a healthy mouse resists being turned over (score of 0) (60) . If the mouse is flipped onto its back but immediately rights itself on one side or both sides, it is given a score of 1 or 1.5, respectively. If it rights itself in 1 to 5 seconds, the score is 2. If righting takes more than 5 seconds, the score is 3. iTreg-early mice were killed on either day 7 or 8 p.i., and iTreg-late mice were killed on days 48, 60, or 81 p.i.\n\nMice were perfused with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich). The brains, coronally divided into five slabs, and the spinal cord, transversely divided into 12 segments, were embedded in paraffin. Four-\u03bcm-thick sections were stained with Luxol fast blue for myelin visualization. Histological scoring was performed as described previously (61) . Brain sections were scored for meningitis (0, no meningitis; 1, mild cellular infiltrates; 2, moderate cellular infiltrates; 3, severe cellular infiltrates), perivascular cuffing (0, no cuffing; 1, 1 to 10 lesions; 2, 11 to 20 lesions; 3, 21 to 30 lesions; 4, 31 to 40 lesions; 5, over 40 lesions), and demyelination (0, no demyelination; 1, mild demyelination; 2, moderate demyelination; 3, severe demyelination). Each score from the brain was combined for a maximum score of 11 per mouse. For scoring of spinal cord sections, each spinal cord segment was divided into four quadrants: the ventral funiculus, the dorsal funiculus, and each lateral funiculus. Any quadrant containing meningitis, perivascular cuffing, or demyelination was given a score of 1 in that pathological class. The total number of positive quadrants for each pathological class was determined and then divided by the total number of quadrants present on the slide and multiplied by 100 to give the percent involvement for each pathological class. An overall pathological score was also determined by giving a positive score if any pathology was present in the quadrant. This was also presented as the percent involvement. CD3 + T cells were visualized by antigen retrieval using citrate-based Vector\u00ae Antigen Unmasking Solutions (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), followed by immunohistochemistry with anti-CD3 antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), using the avidinbiotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) technique (Vector Laboratories) (58) . The numbers of CD3 + cells were counted under a light microscope using 10 to 12 transverse spinal cord segments per mouse as previously described (58) .\n\nBrains and spinal cords were aseptically isolated from infected mice, weighed, and homogenized in 1 ml of Minimal Eagles Media (Gibco/BRL Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) (33) . Baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells were plated in six-well plates. When the monolayers had reached 80-90% confluence, the media was aspirated and 0.3 ml of diluent, PBS containing 1% FBS, was added to each well. Serial dilutions (0.2 ml) of brain or spinal cord homogenate were added to each well and the virus was allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The diluent was aspirated and 3 ml of a 50:50 mixture of sterile 1% agarose and 2X 199 media (Mediatech) containing 2% FBS and 3% antibiotic/antimycotic (Mediatech), was added to each well. The agarose overlay was solidified at room temperature for 20 minutes and the plates were returned to the 37 \u00b0C incubator for 3 days. The plates were fixed with a 2.5% formalin solution in PBS overnight and stained the following day with a 0.1% solution of crystal violet (EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown, NJ) in PBS.\n\nMice were killed and perfused with sterile PBS and then the tissue was removed and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissue was homogenized in TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center Inc, Cincinnati, OH) and the total RNA was isolated from the homogenate using a RNAeasy\u00ae mini kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA) (19) . The reverse transcription reaction was performed with 1 \u03bcg of total RNA, using an ImProm-II Reverse transcription system (Promega, Madison, WI). Sequential reaction conditions were annealing at 25\u00b0 C for 5 minutes and extension at 42\u00b0 C for 1 h. Real-time RT-PCR was performed in iCycler iQ \u2122 96-well PCR plates (BioRad, Hercules, CA) containing 12.5 \u03bcl RT 2 Fast SYBR \u00ae Green qPCR Master Mix (SA Biosciences, Valencia, CA), 10.5 \u03bcl double distilled (dd) H 2 O, 1.0 \u03bcl template cDNA (50 ng), and 1.0 \u03bcl gene-specific 10 \u03bcM PCR primer pair stock in a MyiQ2 Two Color Real-time PCR Detection System (BioRad). Sequential reaction conditions for RT-PCR were activation of HotStart Taq DNA polymerase at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes, and then 40 cycles of 95\u00b0 C for 10 seconds and 60\u00b0 C for 30 seconds. The primers were purchased from RealTimePrimers.com (Elkins Park, PA). The primer pair sequences for VP2, a virus capsid protein, were forward (5\u2032-TGGTCGACTCTGTGGTTACG-3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032-GCCGGTCTTGCAAAGATAGT-3\u2032). Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) 1was used as an internal reference to normalize the results (49) . The PGK1 primers were forward (5\u2032-GCAGATTGTTTGGAATGGTC-3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032-TGCTCACATGGCTGACTTTA-3\u2032).\n\nSerum anti-TMEV antibodies were titrated by ELISA (25) . Sera from mice was collected either at the acute or chronic stage. Plates were coated with 0.5 \u03bcg of TMEV antigen, and then blocked with 10% FBS in PBS. Serial dilutions of serum were plated. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) was used to detect binding anti-TMEV Abs. The reaction was developed by adding ophenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), and stopped with 1N HCl. Absorbance was read at 492 nm on a Multiskan MCC/340 (Thermo Scientific, Rochester, NY).\n\nSpleens were removed from TMEV-infected mice during the acute or chronic stage of disease, mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated using Histopaque\u00ae 1083 (Sigma-Aldrich) (60) . A volume of 100 \u03bcl of 2 \u00d7 10 5 MNCs in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% glutamine, 1% antibiotics, 50 \u03bcM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% FBS was added to each well of 96-well plates. This was incubated with 100 \u03bcl of solution containing 2 \u00d7 10 5 TMEV-infected APCs (TMEV-APCs) or 2 \u00d7 10 5 sham-infected APCs (nAPCs) (61) . TMEV-APCs were made from whole spleen cells infected in vitro with DA virus at a MOI of 5, 1, and 0.1 and irradiated with 2,000 rads, while nAPCs were prepared from sham-infected spleen cells. The cells were cultured for 4 days, after which time each well was pulsed with 1 \u03bcCi of [ 3 H]thymidine. Then, 18 to 24 hours later, the cells were harvested and ( 3 H) incorporation was determined. A stimulation index was calculated using the following formula: [counts per minute (cpm) of MNCs incubated with TMEV-APCs]/(cpm of MNCs incubated with nAPCs). We have not included anti-myelin immune responses in the lymphoproliferation assay, since epitope spreading to myelin epitopes has been shown to be detected 100 days or more p.i. in TMEV infection (63) .\n\nA volume of 2 ml of 4 \u00d7 10 6 spleen MNCs in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% glutamine, 1% antibiotics, 50 \u03bcM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% FBS was added to each well of 6-well plates. This was incubated with 2 ml of media or a solution containing 10 \u03bcg/ml ConA or 4 \u00d7 10 6 PFUs of TMEV MOI of 1 for 2 days. After 2 days the supernatants were collected and analyzed by ELISA (58) . IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and IL-10 concentrations were detected with BD OptEIA kits (BD Biosciences) and IL-17 was detected with a Mouse IL-17A ELISA MAX \u2122 kit (BioLegend).\n\nWe first determined whether iTregs generated from SJL/J mice were similar in numbers and purity to what has been previously established in C57BL/6 mice (21) . After the induction process, 84 to 90% of the cells were FOXP3 + CD4 + ( Figure 1B ). This population was 98% CD25 + and 93% CD49d + [(\u03b14 integrin of very late antigen (VLA)-4)], which are markers for Tregs and adhesion molecules related to homing to the CNS, respectively (Figures 1 A and C). We next examined whether iTregs have suppressive functions. iTregs were incubated with CD4 + CD25 \u2212 responder cells and irradiated APCs in the presence of ConA. At a 1 to 1 ratio of iTregs to responder cells, the amount of suppression was nearly 100%, and at a 1 to 50 ratio, the amount of suppression was approximately 25% ( Figure 1D ). The amount of suppression by iTregs from SJL/J mice depended on the ratio of iTregs versus responder cells and was similar to the amount from iTregs from C57BL/6 mice that was described previously (21) . Thus, we were able to induce iTregs from SJL/J mice, which were comparable to iTregs from C57BL/6 mice, phenotypically and functionally.\n\nTo test whether iTregs could be used to suppress ongoing TMEV-IDD, we injected iTregs into TMEV-infected mice after the onset of the chronic demyelinating disease (iTreg-late) and compared the development of demyelinating disease with TMEV-infected mice without iTreg treatment (control). The control mice developed severe inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the spinal cord, particularly the lateral and ventral funiculus with meningitis and perivascular cuffing (Figure 2A ). Although the iTreg-late mice had a similar distribution of lesions in the spinal cord, they had reduced neuropathology in the spinal cord, particularly the level of MNC infiltration around vessels [mean perivascular cuffing score \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM): iTreg-late, 4.8 \u00b1 2.4; control, 16.3 \u00b1 2.7; P < 0.05, t-test] ( Figures  2B and F, Supplemental table 1 ). Clinically, we monitored impairment of righting reflex as an indicator for neurological deficit, both groups of mice developed progressive impairment of their righting reflex (Supplemental Figure 1 ) (60). iTreg-late mice tended to have lower righting reflex scores than control mice (e.g. righting reflex score on day 81 p.i. \u00b1 SEM: iTreg-late, 1.7 \u00b1 0.1; control, 2.0 \u00b1 0.1; P = 0.051, t-test; results are representative of three independent experiments).\n\nImmunohistochemistry against CD3 showed that the iTreg-late mice had less CD3 + cells in their spinal cords compared with control mice (Figures 2C and D) . Quantification of CD3 staining showed that the percentages of CD3 + cells in total cell infiltrates in the CNS were similar between iTreg-late and control mice (Supplemental Figure 2) . We also examined whether iTreg-late mice had altered viral replication in the CNS, since suppression of immune cell recruitment in the CNS by iTregs could decrease CNS anti-viral immune response, resulting in enhancement of viral replication (66) . The amounts of infectious virus and viral RNA in the spinal cords, measured by RT-PCR and plaque assay, were similar between the iTreg-late and control mice ( Figure 3 ). Thus, therapeutic iTreg treatment suppressed inflammation without increasing virus persistence.\n\nSince iTregs can suppress immune responses in vitro ( Figure 1D ), we speculated that iTregs could also suppress immune responses in vivo, which would explain the decreased CNS inflammation. Using spleen MNCs form iTreg-late and control mice we have compared virus-specific lymphoproliferative and antibody responses as well as virus-and mitogeninduced cytokine production between the groups. Interestingly, however, there were no significant differences in the levels of lymphoproliferation in response to TMEV (cellular immunity) or serum anti-TMEV titers (humoral immunity) between the iTreg-late and control mice (Figure 4 ). On the other hand, MNCs from the iTreg-late mice produced significantly more IL-10 in response to stimulation with TMEV than the control group ( Figure 5A , P < 0.05), while MNCs from both groups of mice produced similar amounts of IL-10 when stimulated with ConA. The levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and IL-17 production after stimulation with ConA or TMEV were similar in both iTreg-late and control mice ( Figures  5B-D) . Thus, therapeutic iTreg treatment altered the cytokine balance without suppressing the overall levels of anti-TMEV immune responses.\n\nOur findings showed IL-10 as a potential mediator of the reduced amount of inflammation in the CNS of the mice given iTregs. To investigate which cell types were producing IL-10, we stimulated cells with TMEV followed by PMA and ionomycin and then stained the cells for surface markers (B220, F4/80, and CD11c were used for B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, respectively) and IL-10 ( Figure 6 ). The control and iTreg-late mice had similar numbers of spleen cells and percentages of populations of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cells, B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Interestingly, there were no differences in the percentages of CD4 + FOXP3 + Tregs in the total spleen MNC population between iTreg-late and control mice (iTreg-late, 0.07 \u00b1 0.03; control, 0.06 \u00b1 0.05). However, the iTreg-late mice had higher percentages of IL-10 + cells and a higher mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of IL-10. The iTreg-late mice had higher percentages of IL-10 + cells, including CD4 + and B220 + cells. In addition, most cell types, particularly CD11c + dendritic cells, had a higher mean fluorescent intensity of IL-10, indicating more IL-10 per cell in the iTreg-late compared with the control group ( Figure 6D ) (51) .\n\nPreviously, Karlsson et al showed that a single iTreg treatment suppressed IBD (21) . Additionally, Tregs have been shown to be beneficial when used prophylactically in an autoimmune model for MS, EAE (24) . We determined whether early treatment with iTregs could be beneficial in TMEV infection by injecting mice with iTregs on the same day of TMEV infection (iTreg-early mice) (approximately 3-4 weeks before the onset of demyelinating disease) and monitored their weight and clinical signs (Figure 7) . During the acute stage of TMEV infection, 1-2 weeks p.i., TMEV has been shown to induce only mild or no disease clinically, but induce inflammation mainly in the brain, histologically. Interestingly, iTreg-early mice developed obvious clinical signs during the acute stage. Although no control TMEV-infected mice developed an impaired righting reflex, the iTregearly mice had a significantly impaired righting reflex during the acute stage of disease (mean righting reflex scores \u00b1 SEM on day 8: iTreg-early 0.9 \u00b1 0.2; control 0, P < 0.05, ttest). In addition, iTreg-early mice had more weight loss compared with control mice, which had a weight increase during the acute stage (mean weight change (g) \u00b1SEM on day 8: iTreg-early, \u22120.8 g \u00b1 0.3; control, 0.8 g \u00b1 0.3, P < 0.05, t-test). By 2 weeks p.i., iTreg-early mice recovered from acute disease and both iTreg-early and control mice showed no clinical signs between 2-3 weeks p.i. During the chronic stage, the iTreg-early mice had slightly lower clinical scores than control mice; although this difference was not significant.\n\nWe next determined why iTreg-early mice developed more severe acute clinical disease. Neuropathology (inflammation and cell death) was examined at the peak of the acute stage. In both groups of mice, neuropathology was predominantly observed in the grey matter of the brain, including the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and hypothalamus, while spinal cord involvement was mild. Histologically, iTreg-early mice displayed less CNS inflammation, despite showing worse clinical signs compared with control mice. In control TMEV-infected mice, layers of cell infiltrates were observed around the perivascular area, while in iTreg-early mice only dilation of venules with few or no infiltrating cells was observed (Figure 8 ). Immunohistochemistry against CD3 showed substantial CD3 + cell infiltration in the brains of control mice, while very little CD3 + T cells were observed in the brains of iTreg-early mice (Figures 8C and D) . Quantification of brain inflammation confirmed that the level of perivascular cuffing was significantly lower in the iTreg-early mice than control mice (P < 0.05, Figure 8F ).\n\nWe next tested whether suppression of immune cell recruitment in the CNS in iTreg-early mice resulted in enhancement of viral replication during the acute stage (6) . We found more infectious virus and viral RNA present in the brain in iTreg-early mice, compared with control mice during the acute stage ( Figure 9 ). The level of infectious virus present in the brains of iTreg-early mice correlated with the amount of weight loss of the mice (r = 0.85, P < 0.05) ( Figure 9C ). Thus, the higher amount of viral replication, but not the extent of inflammation, was associated with the increased severity of acute disease in iTreg-early mice.\n\nWe tested whether increased viral levels in iTreg-early mice could be due to an alteration of the in vivo levels of anti-TMEV immune responses in iTreg-early, compared with control mice. However, we detected similar levels of lymphoproliferative (cellular) and antibody (humoral) responses to TMEV in both iTreg-early and control mice ( Figure 10 ). MNCs from iTreg-early mice produced more anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-4 and less proinflammatory IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 than control mice during the acute stage ( Figure 11 ). Thus, similar to therapeutic treatment, early iTreg treatment altered the balance of cytokines without suppressing overall anti-TEMV immune responses. In the iTreg-early mice, exacerbation of acute viral disease with increased viral levels was associated with their antiinflammatory cytokine profile, which likely suppressed (anti-viral) immune cell recruitment into the CNS.\n\nThe susceptibility to TMEV-IDD has been shown to differ among mouse strains; for example, SJL/J mice are known to be susceptible, while C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice are known to be resistant (34) . The above results showed that early iTreg treatment could exacerbate acute viral disease by suppression of CNS immune cell recruitment, facilitating increased viral replication in SJL/J mice. This raised the question whether early iTreg treatment of TMEV-resistant C57BL/6 mice could render them susceptible to TMEV-IDD, where TMEV infection may result in more active virus replication and virus persistence in the CNS, leading to TMEV-IDD in C57BL/6 mice. We treated TMEV-infected C57BL/6 mice with iTregs (iTreg mice) on day 0 (early treatment), and compared clinical signs and neuropathology with TMEV-infected mice with no iTreg treatment (control). We compared clinical signs, histology, and immune responses between the two groups (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4) . We found that B6 mice remained resistant to TMEV-IDD regardless of iTreg treatment; no iTreg mice developed TMEV-IDD.\n\nSince 1-2 \u00d7 10 7 iTregs could be generated ex vivo from the spleen of one mouse, this method for iTreg induction allowed for a large amount of iTregs to be generated with minimal reagents, unlike when using freshly isolated Tregs where only about 1 \u00d7 10 6 Tregs can be harvested from one mouse (7) . The iTregs were highly immunosuppressive in vitro and were able to modulate anti-viral and autoimmune immune responses in vivo (21) . The high percentage of CD25 expression in the iTregs that is typical of Tregs. Expression of CD49d on iTregs suggests that they can migrate into to the CNS by binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1. The large number of functional Tregs that can be generated makes this system ideal for not only investigating the role of Tregs in general but also translational applications. The high yield of iTregs makes this system promising for potential use in Treg-based therapies, which have been suggested for many immunemediated diseases, including MS (41).\n\nSufficient anti-viral immune responses need to be generated by a host to eradicate invading viruses. However, if this immune response goes uncontrolled, the resulting immunopathology can cause more damage than the pathology induced by viral replication (viral pathology). The TMEV-IDD model of MS can serve as a model to demonstrate the deleterious effects of both viral pathology and immunopathology (4, 16, 36, 57) . The pathomechanisms have been demonstrated to change during the course of TMEV infection: during the acute stage, neuronal and axonal degeneration is mainly induced by viral pathology, while during the chronic stage; demyelination is primarily induced by immunopathology. Tregs can play an important role in balancing immunopathology and pathogen-specific immune responses. In the current study, we have used ex vivo generated iTregs to investigate the role and therapeutic potential of Tregs during the acute and chronic stages of TMEV infection.\n\nDuring the chronic stage of disease, less immune cell infiltration was observed in the spinal cords of iTreg-late mice compared with control mice (Figure 2 ). We initially speculated that this could lead to increased viral persistence; however, we found no difference in the amount of virus persistence between iTreg-late and control mice. We also demonstrated that both the cellular and humoral anti-TMEV immune responses were similar between the iTreg-late and the control mice ( Figure 3 ). Then, we compared the cytokine profiles between the two groups of mice. The iTreg-late mice produced significantly more IL-10 in response to TMEV than the control mice, but similar amounts of other cytokines ( Figure 5 ). The amount of IL-10 produced in response to TMEV was even higher than what was produced in response to a T cell mitogen, ConA (39) . This was the only cytokine that was produced in higher levels in response to TMEV than ConA. IL-10 has been shown to suppress neuroinflammation (3), therefore, the enhanced IL-10 response to TMEV could be responsible for the reduction in inflammation in the iTreg-late mice.\n\nSince most types of immune cells can produce IL-10, we attempted to identify the source of IL-10 production to help determine the mechanism by which the iTregs modulated the immune response (11, 31) . While only a small percentage of the cells were IL-10 + , there were more IL-10 + cells in the iTreg-late mice after stimulating the cells with TMEV, compared with control mice (Figure 6 ). There were higher percentages of CD4 + and B220 + (a B cell marker) cells among the IL-10 + cells, which was somewhat expected, since these cell types have been associated with IL-10 production (13) . Interestingly, the IL-10 MFI was also higher in all the cell types investigated in the iTreg-late mice compared with the control mice, except CD4 + cells ( Figure 6D ). The higher MFI was not due to an increase in autofluorescence or nonspecific antibody binding, since the MFIs of samples incubated with isotype control antibody were similar between control and iTreg groups (data not shown). Overall, the higher MFI suggests that these cell types are producing more IL-10 (51). Since most cell types, except CD4 + cells, have a higher IL-10 MFI, the iTregs may change the immune response systemically to a more regulatory phenotype. Although IL-10 production was seen in very low percentages in all cell subsets, there was a higher percentage of IL-10 + cells and a higher MFI in the iTreg-late mice compared with the control mice, combined these increases could explain the significant increase in IL-10 production in response to TMEV seen by ELISA. This systemic change to a more regulatory phenotype may explain how the iTreg-late mice have similar anti-TMEV immune responses and viral load, and less inflammation compared with control mice.\n\nThese results support the idea that immunopathology is a contributing factor to the overall pathology during the chronic stage of TMEV infection (34, 62) . Here, it appears that iTregs are influencing the immune response to TMEV in other immune cell types, mostly in the lymphoid organs, and altering them to a more anti-inflammatory response via IL-10 production. Consistent with this theory, Karlsson et al, whose method for generating iTregs in C57BL/6 mice was applied to SJL/J mice, found substantial numbers of iTregs in the peripheral lymphoid organs after iTreg transfer. Anghelina et al also reported a systemic distribution of transferred Tregs in MHV-infected mice. Although this does not deny the possibility that iTregs influence the immune system in the target organ (i.e., CNS) in our current experiments, we were not able to precisely determine the localization of transferred iTregs by distinguishing between iTregs and nTregs in the recipient mice, due to a lack of GFP-FOXP3 or DEREG mice on the SJL/J genetic background.\n\nAlthough there was no difference between the numbers of CD4 + FOXP3 + Tregs or IL-10 + Tregs present in the iTreg-late or control mice, the early production of IL-10 or other immune mediators by iTregs in the iTreg-late mice could result in a lasting effect. We are investigating how the iTregs affected the other cell types to enhance their IL-10 production. Kearley et al. observed a similar effect of Tregs in a mouse model of airway inflammation, where transferred Tregs were able to suppress inflammation by inducing IL-10 expression in CD4 + T cells in recipient mice (22) . In their model, the transfer of IL-10-deficient Tregs could induce IL-10 production in CD4 + T cells. Anghelina et al. also demonstrated that in MHV infection, another viral model for MS, transfer of IL-10-deficient Tregs was able to suppress disease, while transferring Tregs to IL-10-deficient recipient mice did not suppress virus-induced demyelination (1) . Although the authors were unable to determine the source of IL-10, their data suggests that IL-10 was essential for disease suppression and that its production was induced in recipient cells by transferred Tregs. These experiments demonstrated that Tregs can influence the amount of IL-10 production without necessarily producing it by themselves. Interestingly, the iTreg-early mice killed 1 week after iTreg injection (in contrast to the iTreg-late mice that were killed over a month after iTreg injection) also had increased IL-10 responses to TMEV, compared with control mice, although their IL-10 response to ConA was greater than the response to TMEV (Figure 6 ). This suggests a change from a non-specific to a virus specific IL-10 response during the course of TMEV infection; which may need to be addressed to determine how IL-10 contributes to the immunomodulatory effects of iTregs in TMEV and other virus infections, in general. The long-term effects of the iTregs were similar to what was seen in a mouse model of IBD, where injection of iTregs suppressed disease 8 weeks after injection (21) .\n\nAlthough the enhanced IL-10 production appears to be TMEV-specific, we did not find an increase in virus-specific iTregs. This is reasonable since the iTregs were generated without TMEV-specific antigen stimuli and the number we injected was low (5 \u00d7 10 5 ). In theory, a small number of TMEV-specific iTregs that were present in the inoculum could have expanded and altered the cytokine milieu to a more favorable environment for the expansion of resident TMEV-specific Tregs (52) . However, this is unlikely to be the case, since there were similar amounts of CD4 + FOXP3 + Tregs recovered from both iTreg-late and control mice.\n\nOne of our concerns was that by suppressing or altering the immune response by giving the mice iTregs would make the mice more susceptible to cancer, since Tregs have been shown to play a role in the development of some cancers (48) . SJL/J mice spontaneously develop reticulum cell sarcomas, typically around 5-6 months of age (37) . Despite the changes in the immune response to TMEV the iTreg-late mice did not have a higher incidence of developing reticulum cell sarcomas or other tumors than the control mice, which were identified by macroscopic swelling of the lymph nodes and spleen and confirmed microscopically. However, these experiments typically lasted until the mice were less than 3 months old; thus a longer term experiment would be required to determine longer term effects of iTreg injection on the development of reticulum cell sarcoma and other malignancies in these mice.\n\nTo our surprise, mice receiving early treatment with iTregs developed obvious clinical signs including significantly more weight loss and impaired righting reflex scores, during the acute stage of TMEV infection, while control infected-mice without iTreg treatment were asymptomatic (Figure 7) . In TMEV infection, SJL/J mice generally do not develop obvious clinical disease during the acute stage; infected mice sometimes show mild weight loss without impairment of righting reflex. Interestingly, control mice had a higher level of cell infiltration, including T cells, in the brain. On the other hand, we detected higher infectious virus and viral RNA in the brains of iTreg-early mice, compared with control mice. Thus, viral pathology (replication), but not inflammation (immunopathology), seemed to contribute to exacerbation of acute disease in iTreg-early mice. We first suspected that the iTregs inhibited the immune response to TMEV, which reduced the amount of CNS inflammation. However, both the cellular and humoral immune responses to TMEV were similar between iTreg-early and control mice. Although the mice had similar overall antiviral immune responses, the iTreg-early mice produced four-fold more IL-10 and three-fold less IFN-\u03b3 in response to TMEV compared with the control mice ( Figure 11 ). This suggests that modulation of the immune response to TMEV could prevent CNS recruitment of antiviral immune cells and allow for more viral replication. This is similar to what has been previously demonstrated with CNS infections with GDVII versus DA strains of TMEV, where the neurovirulent GDVII strain caused mice to die due to more severe viral replication (viral pathology) with significantly reduced T cell recruitment in the CNS (59) . In herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, Lund et al. found that Tregs were essential for prolonging the lifespan of infected mice by coordinating the migration (recruitment) of effector T cells to the site of infection, where in the absence of Tregs the effector cells accumulated in the draining lymph nodes and were less prevalent at the site of infection (27) . The authors concluded that Tregs were orchestrating timely immune cell recruitment to the site of infection to aid the immune response to HSV. In TMEV infection, Tregs may also affect the recruitment of effector cells to the CNS and preventing them from entering the site of infection in a deleterious manner, which is in contrast to what occurs in HSV infection.\n\nTregs have been proposed to be a key determinant to the susceptibility of SJL/J mice to a chronic TMEV infection (40) . Using anti-CD25 antibody, Richards et al. inactivated Tregs in SJL/J mice during the acute stage of TMEV infection and found a reduced viral burden during the acute stage of disease and a delay in the onset of TMEV-IDD and a reduction in the severity of disease (40) . The results from our study are in agreement with their results, where depletion of Tregs reduced viral loads, while addition of iTregs increased viral loads in our study. Richards et al. also found that depletion of Tregs enhanced CD4 + and CD8 + T cell as well as antibody responses to TMEV. In contrast, we demonstrated that the addition of iTregs did not reduce the anti-TMEV immune response, either cellular or humoral, but altered the cytokine balance to a more anti-inflammatory bias. These differences between the two studies could be due to the different mechanistic approaches and the characteristics of the in vivo inactivated Tregs and the ex vivo generated iTregs. Richards et al. inactivated Tregs in vivo ('loss of function' approach), while we gave the mice ex vivo generated iTregs ('gain of function' approach). In addition, since CD25 is expressed on activated T cells and during T cell development, and on B cells and other cell types, inactivation or depletion of these cell populations could create additional effects other than Treg inactivation, which may account for the discrepancies (23, 64) . Furthermore, Karlsson et al. demonstrated that iTregs from C57BL/6 mice were more potent at suppressing colitis and had different expression patterns of homing molecules and cytokines compared with natural Tregs (nTregs) (20) . Thus, the differences between ex vivo generated iTregs and in vivo generated nTregs may also explain the discrepancies between the experiments by Richards et al. and ours.\n\nWhile this study and the one conducted by Richards et al demonstrate the impact that Tregs can have during the acute stage of TMEV infection, it is unlikely that iTregs alone can account for the difference in susceptibility to TMEV-IDD between resistant C57BL/6 and susceptible SJL/J mice. We have conducted iTreg transfer experiments with TMEV-infected C57BL/6 mice and found that they did not become susceptible to TMEV-IDD or virus persistence (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4) . There was no difference in the immune response to TMEV during the acute stage of TMEV infection between the control C57BL/6 mice and the C57BL/6 mice given iTregs. This is consistent with the findings by Richards et al. that there was no enhancement of anti-TMEV immune responses when they depleted Tregs in C57BL/6 mice. These data suggest that SJL/J mice have different effector mechanisms that can be exacerbated by Tregs and contribute to their susceptibility compared with C57BL/6 mice.\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that Tregs can play distinct roles in viral infections, which depended on the disease stage. During the chronic stage of TMEV infection where immunopathology is the dominant pathomechanism, iTreg treatment reduced CNS inflammation without increasing the viral burden suppressing TMEV-IDD. On the other hand, during the acute stage of TMEV infection where viral replication causes most of the pathology, iTreg treatment enhanced viral replication leading to more severe disease. These two contrasting effects of Tregs have been observed individually in several viral infections (1, 12, 26, 50, 66) . To our knowledge, however, this is the first study to demonstrate that iTregs could have both detrimental and beneficial effects in the different stages of a single virus infection. Since Tregs have been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for many diseases that may have a viral component or occur in parallel with viral infections, the present data suggest that Tregs may be a double-edged sword. The type and stage of virus infection must be carefully considered before using Tregs for a personalized medicine approach.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. Spinal cord pathology during the chronic stage of TMEV infection. A, B, and E. Luxol fast blue staining of thoracic spinal cord segments. TMEV-infected mice receiving iTregs during the early-chronic stage (iTreg-late) had less inflammation (arrows), compared with control mice. C and D. Immunostaining using CD3 antibody showed less CD3 + cells in the spinal cords of iTreg-late mice (D), compared with control mice (C) F. Quantification of inflammation in the spinal cord of mice infected with TMEV, mice were killed on day 48. iTreg-late mice (hatched bars) had lower pathology scores in all pathological classes, particularly perivascular cuffing (*P < 0.05), compared with control mice (closed bars). Spinal cord sections were divided into four quadrants consisting of the anterior funiculus, the posterior funiculus and each lateral funiculus. The total number of positive quadrants for each pathologic class was determined, then divided by the total number of quadrants present on the slide and multiplied by 100 to give the percent involvement for each pathologic class. The overall pathology was determined by counting the number of quadrants containing any lesions. Six mice per group were used. These results are representative of three independent experiments.

A. Righting reflex score: 1 and 1.5, the mouse is flipped onto its back but immediately rights itself on one side or both sides, respectively; 2, the mouse rights itself in 1 to 5 seconds; 3, righting takes more than 5 seconds.
