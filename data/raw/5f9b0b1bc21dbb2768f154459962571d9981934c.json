{"title": "", "body": "The histories of pathology and microbiology are intertwined. 6 Pathologists should add their diagnostic techniques to those of microbiology for the best diagnostic yield (Table 7. 2). 7 Unfortunately the diagnostic work-up and reporting of findings in anatomic pathology and microbiology typically run along nonintersecting paths, often without one group knowing (or acknowledging) the findings of the other. An interdisciplinary approach based on mutual understanding and communication is the ideal scenario for clinical management. 8 Our concept of an integrated morphologic and microbiologic approach is presented schematically in Fig. 7 .1 and with greater detail for specific situations in which bacterial ( Fig. 7. 2), mycobacterial ( Fig. 7. 3), fungal ( Fig. 7.4) , or viral ( Fig. 7 .5) pathogens are suspected. Specific species diagnoses are typically not possible from most pathology specimens, and attempts at pure morphologic diagnosis can be misleading. Pathologic findings should always be correlated with microbiologic findings. Accordingly, foresight is required on the part of the intraoperative pathologist in obtaining and properly handling tissues for culture. 9 The pathologic report should correlate the relevant microbiologic findings.\n\nSimilarly, Pneumocystis organisms may be easily identified in patients with AIDS, but when immunosuppression is less severe (such as that produced by corticosteroids therapy for arthritis), the organism is rare. The relationship between the level of immunity, burden of organisms, and patterns of disease is illustrated for cryptococcosis in Fig. 7 . 6. In the immunocompromised patient, there is always a broader differential diagnosis. 17 In addition to infection, other disorders come into consideration, such as pulmonary involvement by preexisting disease, drug-induced and treatment-related injury, noninfectious interstitial pneumonias, malignancy, and new pulmonary diseases unrelated to the patient's immunocompromised state, such as aspiration, heart failure, and pulmonary embolism. When immunosuppression is intentional, as in transplant recipients, unique additional challenges come into play, such as transplant rejection, graft-versus-host disease, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. Immunosuppressed persons are at risk for multiple simultaneous infections, so when one organism is found, a careful search for others is always warranted (Fig. 7.7) .\n\nA number of well-characterized genetic disorders of immunity and cellular function are known to predispose affected persons to lung infection. [18] [19] [20] [21] Cystic fibrosis bears special recognition in this context because it is associated with reproducible patterns of lung disease and susceptibility to a wide spectrum of infectious organisms. This genetic disease of autosomal recessive inheritance involves mutation of the CFTR gene, which affects the ability of epithelial cells to effectively transport chloride and water across cell membranes. As a result, many organs, including the lungs, develop excessively viscous mucous secretions that cannot be cleared from the airways effectively. In the\n\nIdentification of the patient's risk factors and immune status is important because these parameters typically influence the spectrum of histopathologic changes, the types of etiologic agents, and number of organisms. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] The degree of immunosuppression can influence the burden of organisms making the etiologic organisms more difficult to demonstrate histopathologically. For example, organisms are less often found in lung tissues from patients with normal or near-normal immunity. In this setting, cultures, serologic studies, and epidemiologic data must be relied on to provide the diagnosis. 16 Contrast the tedious search for rare acid-fast organisms in reactivation tuberculosis granulomas with Mycobacterium avium infection in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. In the AIDS patient, M. avium infection typically manifests poorly formed granulomas or simply histiocytic infiltrates, with an overabundance of organisms identified by tissue acid-fast stains. mycobacterial infection and allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease, and the condition is potentially exacerbated by superimposed viral infections. [24] [25] [26] [27] Pattern Recognition\n\nKnowledge of the radiologic pattern of infectious lung disease in a given patient often helps to narrow the scope of the differential diagnosis. 28, 29 Patterns of lung infection seen on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) are typically dominated by increased attenuation (opacity). Such opacities may occur as one or more localized densities lung, retention of such secretions leads to progressive and widespread bronchiectasis with airway obstruction, which in turn paves the way for recurrent infection ( Fig. 7.8 ). Bacterial organisms commonly isolated include Pseudomonasaeruginosa (both mucoid and nonmucoid strains), Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Achromobacter xylosoxidans. 22 Polymicrobial infections are not uncommon, and some of these pathogens, especially certain subspecies within the B. cepacia complex, are linked to an adverse prognosis. 23 Cystic fibrosis is also a risk factor for nontuberculous (nodule, mass, or infiltrate), as ground-glass opacities (attenuation that allows underlying lung structures to be visible), or consolidation (attenuation that overshadows underlying structures). 30 Review of the chest imaging studies and the pace of the disease (acute, subacute, and chronic) can be very helpful in arriving at a clinically relevant diagnosis. (Fig.  7.9 ). Fortunately the recognized histopathologic patterns of lung infection are fairly limited (airway disease, acute lung injury, cellular infiltrates, alveolar filling, and nodules), and these typically correlate with a particular group of organisms (Table 7. 3).\n\nSome pathologists have an aversion to the use of special stains for identifying organisms in tissue sections based on less than optimal specificity and sensitivity and the technical difficulty of performing some of these (especially silver impregnation methods, such as the Dieterle, Steiner, and Warthin-Starry stains). Nevertheless, several tissue section staining techniques are quite useful in detecting bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi in tissue sections. A list of these is presented in Box 7.2. These stains should be applied as part of an algorithmic strategy for acute lung injury, especially in the immunocompromised patient. 31 For example, when bacteria are being sought, some pathologists would prefer to begin with the tissue Gram stain (e.g., Brown and Hopps, Brown and Brenn; Figs. 7.10 and 7.11), but silver impregnation techniques (e.g., Warthin-Starry) are actually more sensitive and a good starting point for approaching a suspected bacterial infection. By coating the bacteria with metallic silver, the bacterial silhouettes are enhanced ( Fig. 7 .12) and become more visible. 31 Other stains (e.g., Giemsa) will sometimes detect bacteria that do not stain well with more conventional stains ( Fig. 7.13 ). The Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) stain ( Fig.  7 .14) is the best stain for most fungi in tissue; it also stains Actinomycetes, Nocardia, Pneumocystis (cysts), free-living soil amebae, algal cells, the spores of certain microsporidia, and the cytoplasmic inclusions of cytomegalovirus (CMV). 7 Most mycobacteria stain well with the Ziehl-Neelsen procedure ( Fig. 7.15 ), but the auramine-rhodamine fluorescent procedure is superior in terms of sensitivity ( Fig. 7.16 ). Nocardia organisms, Legionella micdadei, and Rhodococcus equi are weakly or partially acid-fast, and the use of modified acid-fast stains such the Fite-Faraco technique is more satisfactory for the identification of these organisms. Some mycobacterial species, such as M. avium complex (MAC), are also periodic acid-Schiff reagent (PAS)-positive, GMS-positive, and weakly gram-positive.\n\nFinally, for the identification of most protozoa and helminths, as well as viral inclusions, a good-quality hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)stained section suffices; in fact, a well-prepared H&E section alone is diagnostic for many infectious diseases. This stain can often detect and even distinguish between bacterial cocci and bacilli when the burden of organisms is high (Fig. 7.17 ).\n\nThe application of ancillary studies-such as immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization (Fig. 7.18 ), 32 or nucleic acid amplification technology-can provide a specific etiologic diagnosis in certain cases. These techniques have the best chance of diagnosing infections caused by fastidious species that are difficult or impossible to culture from fresh samples; they are also useful in situations where only formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues are available. Immunohistochemical reagents for microbiologic detection are becoming increasingly available and provide added power to determining specific diagnoses on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue ( Fig. 7.19 ). 33 Although these techniques provide the diagnostic equivalence of culture confirmation, they are not without limitations and diagnostic pitfalls. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method first introduced in the 1980s has undergone a number of modifications. Non-PCR DNA amplification methods and methods based not on the amplification of the DNA target per se but on amplification of the signal or probe have also been introduced. 34 Among the more recently available technologies is the rapid-cycle real-time PCR assay, representing an especially powerful advance in that it is significantly more sensitive than culture. The adaptation of various amplification methods to real-time and multiplex formats enables laboratories to detect a wide range of respiratory pathogens. Furthermore the transition from traditional and analyte-specific methods to more global technologies such as PCR arrays, liquid bead arrays, microarrays, and high-throughput DNA sequencing is under way. Over time, these methods will find a place in laboratories of all sizes and dramatically impact the speed and accuracy of microbiologic testing practice for all types of microorganisms. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] Limiting Factors in Diagnosis Needless to say, the diagnostic tools employed by both pathologists and microbiologists have their limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. 7 Some common tools are listed in Box 7.3. Culture alone cannot distinguish contamination from colonization, or in the case of viruses, asymptomatic shedding from true infection. Molecular tests may require specialized, often costly equipment and are susceptible to false-positive and false-negative results. 37 If a surgical biopsy is available, correlation of the histopathologic features can help assign an etiologic role to an agent recovered in culture or help establish if the microbiologically discovered organism has caused any microscopically visible lesion. The host inflammatory pattern and morphologic features of an organism can be characteristic for certain types of infections, but often the organism's morphology alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis at the genus or species level. Furthermore, the classic histopathologic findings for a given infection may be incomplete or lacking, making specific morphologic diagnosis possible for relatively few organisms. For example, the etiologic diagnosis is straightforward when large spherules with endospores characteristic of Coccidioides species are present, when the small budding yeasts of Histoplasma capsulatum are seen, or when yeasts with the large mucoid capsules of Cryptococcus neoformans are identified. However, atypical forms of these organisms can be confusing. 40 Similarly, hyphal morphology is helpful when it is characteristic of a specific genus or group, but the many look-alikes ( Fig. 7 .20) require separation by searching for subtle differences under high magnification (or oil immersion) or by relying on special techniques and culture. 41 Certain viruses may have characteristic inclusions in tissue, but there are notable pitfalls. For example, the eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions of adenovirus may resemble the early inclusions in herpes simplex virus (HSV) or CMV, especially when the typical smudged cellular forms of adenovirus are absent. Also, simulators of viral cytopathic effect (CPE), such as macronucleoli, optically clear nuclei, and intranuclear cytoplasmic invaginations, can occur in a number of conditions and need to be recognized ( Fig. 7.21) .\n\nPseudomicrobe artifacts also have been recognized on routine and special stains for the identification of bacteria and fungi. Such potential artifacts include fragmented reticulin fibers, pigments, calcium deposits, Hamazaki-Wesenberg (yellow-brown) yeast-like bodies (Fig. 7.22 ), pollen grains, and even lymphoglandular bodies. 42 For all of these reasons, the pathologist must maintain a high threshold for diagnosing organisms on morphologic grounds. If any question remains, it is best to repeat special stains liberally on deeper levels or in different tissue blocks. \n\nHistopathologic examination: Inflammatory changes nonspecific, atypical, or absent; organisms not visualized or nonspecific morphology (e.g., \"Aspergilluslike\"); unexpected or unfamiliar site Special stains, immunohistochemical/molecular techniques: Sensitivity and specificity issues; misinterpretation (e.g., aberrant forms, artifacts, nonmicrobial mimics); limited reagents, false-negative and false-positive results Cytopathologic analysis: Limitations similar to those with histopathologic examination\n\nDirect visualization: Sensitivity and specificity Culture/identification: Normal flora versus pathogens; colonization or asymptomatic shedding versus invasion; difficult, dangerous, or slow to grow; treated; fixed, contaminated tissue; too small or nonrepresentative sample Serologic studies: Single sample; no early response or lack of response; nondiagnostic for highly prevalent/persistent microbe; cross reaction; acute versus chronic; false-positive result on IgM tests\n\nA wide variety of infectious diseases of the lung-including bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic-can be diagnosed through exfoliative or fine-needle aspiration cytologic techniques. [43] [44] [45] [46] Fine-needle aspiration is an especially powerful tool compared with the exfoliative cytology study of respiratory secretions: sputum, bronchial washings/ brushings, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The usefulness of exfoliative cytology examination is often limited owing to the difficulty of distinguishing colonizing/contaminant organisms in the airways from true pathogens. Nonetheless both diagnostic techniques are complementary and have been used in recent years to evaluate pneumonias and pulmonary nodules in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Mass-like infiltrates are often the target of aspiration biopsy needles when suspicion or exclusion of an infectious process ranks high in the differential diagnosis. Besides the morphologic features of the microorganism, important cytologic clues to the diagnosis include the accompanying cellular response and the presence and character of any necrotic debris, as outlined in Table 7 .4. Although nonspecific, such features can suggest certain possibilities to the cytopathologist and assist the microbiology laboratory in triaging the specimen. 47 To this end, the presence of a cytopathologist, microscope, and staining setup during the aspiration process can be useful. The cytopathologist can correlate the clinical setting, radiologic features, and clues from the gross character of the aspirate (color, consistency, odor, and so on), thereby assisting in narrowing the diagnostic possibilities and avoiding false-positive and false-negative diagnoses. 48 Also, immediate evaluation of smears by rapid stain procedures allows the cytopathologist to either make or suggest a specific diagnosis, as with the preparation and evaluation of a frozen section during intraoperative consultation. Smears can be prepared for special stains, needle rinses can be performed for culture and other ancillary studies, and additional aspirations may be encouraged for these purposes. 49 Special stains for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi should be used whenever the character of the aspirate and the clinical setting (e.g., compromised immune status) indicate that such studies may be useful. Some interventionists prefer to provide only a needle core biopsy in lieu of an aspirate for a variety of reasons. These two techniques can be viewed as complementary; whereas needle core biopsies work well for neoplasms and many granulomas, the aspirate is often superior for diagnosing many types of infections, especially bacterial abscesses. Sometimes a rapid and specific etiologic diagnosis is possible at the bedside, based on the microscopic features of the organism itself. However, when the organism is not readily apparent or its features are inconclusive, the microbiology laboratory can be invaluable for its role in isolation and identification. 49 BAL, typically performed in the evaluation of infection in an immunocompromised host, provides a standard panel of microbiology results, which should always be correlated with the cytology findings. 50, 51 Summary The successful treatment of pulmonary infections depends on accurate identification of the pathogen involved. In turn, this requires collecting the best specimens, transporting them to the anatomic and microbiology sections of the laboratory under optimal conditions, and processing them with techniques appropriate for the spectrum of possible etiologic disorders. An interdisciplinary approach enhances this process. It is best that pathologists, clinicians, and microbiologists communicate frequently and recognize the strengths and weaknesses of their respective disciplines. Joint strategies can be developed for the approach to certain \n\nThe surgical pathologist rarely receives biopsy specimens from patients with community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonias. Most of these infections are suspected clinically by symptoms and physical and radiologic findings; some are confirmed immediately by Gram stains (or later by culture) performed on respiratory secretions in the microbiology laboratory. Serologic studies sometimes prove to be diagnostic. Even when conventional microbiologic approaches are applied, however, approximately 50% of bacterial pneumonias remain undiagnosed. [52] [53] [54] Patients with mild disease are often not tested and treated empirically with antibiotic regimens following established guidelines. By contrast, patients with severe disease, whether immunocompromised or not, often become candidates for invasive procedures.\n\nBacterial pneumonia may be classified according to various parameters including pathogenesis, epidemiology, anatomic pattern, clinical course, and organism type (Box 7.5). 55 Using bacterial type as a starting point allows the pathologist to correlate anatomic and histopathologic patterns of lung injury with categories of etiologic agents. The pyogenic bacteria most commonly associated with communityacquired pneumonias include S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. 54 Other pathogens such as Legionella species, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (often referred to as the atypical group) are clinically important, but controversy exists with regard to the relative frequency of these organisms as etiologic agents. Although community-acquired pneumonia is considered to be fundamentally different in children and in adults, severe or complicated pneumonias in both of these age groups are of similar etiology. 56 The enteric gram-negative bacilli cause relatively few community-acquired pneumonias, whereas they account for most of the nosocomial pneumonias, along with Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, S. aureus, and anaerobes. 57, 58 Most nosocomial pneumonias result from aspiration of these bacterial species that colonize the oropharynx of hospitalized patients, and such pneumonias can be polymicrobial. Any of the bacterial organisms listed (including mixtures with fungi and viruses) can cause pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. 14, 59 Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a special subset of nosocomial pneumonia and an important acute lobular pneumonia ( Fig. 7 .23), which usually correlates with patchy segmental infiltrates on the chest film (consolidation pattern on HRCT). 29, [71] [72] [73] With increasing organism virulence and disease severity, lobular exudates may become confluent (i.e., lobar pneumonia). In milder cases, the disease may be limited to the airways (bronchitis/bronchiolitis) with a mixed cellular infiltrate of mononuclear cells and neutrophils ( Fig. 7 .24). One very common manifestation of such airway-limited infection has been designated as acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A majority of these exacerbations are caused by particular bacteria (specifically H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis) with approximately one third resulting from viral airway infections, typically resulting from rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus. 74 Nodular/Necrotizing Lesions Nodular inflammatory infiltrates with or without necrotizing features ( Fig. 7 .25) are characteristic of infection by certain species, such as R. equi (Fig. 7.26 ). 75 Necrotizing pneumonias may also be produced by pyogenic bacteria such as S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and the gram-negative bacilli-Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Burkholderia species. \n\nAcute Chronic\n\nPyogenic species Atypical agents Granule/filamentous group Box 7.5 Classification of Bacterial Pneumonia cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. [60] [61] [62] The bacterial etiology in this setting is quite diverse and dependent on such factors as patient characteristics, underlying lung disease, and geographical location. 63 Most recently, an increase in skin and soft tissue staphylococcal infections due to methicillin-resistant strains has led to the recognition of these organisms as an important cause of both communityacquired and nosocomial pneumonia with attendant morbidity and mortality. 64 In rare nosocomial pneumonias, a number of unusual organisms, such as Salmonella, Rhodococcus, and Leptospira species, may be the etiologic agent. 65, 66 The atypical pneumonia agents do not commonly produce lobar consolidation. Although this potentially implicates a wide variety of bacterial, viral, and protozoal pathogens, a selective list by convention includes M. pneumoniae, Legionella species, and C. pneumoniae as the three dominant nonzoonotic pathogens, and Coxiella burnetii (the agent of Q fever), Chlamydia psittaci (causing psittacosis in people), and Francisella tularensis (causing tularemia) as the three more common zoonotic pathogens. 67, 68 The filamentous/granule group refers to those bacteria that form long, thin, branching filaments in tissues, such as Actinomyces (anaerobic actinomycetes) or Nocardia (aerobic actinomycetes). 69 Botryomycosis is caused by nonfilamentous bacteria, especially S. aureus, or gramnegative bacilli, such as P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, which form organized aggregates referred to as grains or granules. 70 Histopathology Bacterial lung injury patterns will vary in accordance with the virulence of the organism and the host response. These patterns are further modulated by therapeutic or immunologic factors. Although some of the patterns presented in Box 7.6 are characteristic, none are diagnostic. Overlap and mixed patterns occur.\n\nAcute exudative pneumonia is most often caused by pyogenic bacteria, such as streptococci, which typically produce a neutrophil-rich intraalveolar exudate (i.e., alveolar filling) with variable amounts of fibrin and red cells. Pathologists recognize this constellation of findings as \n\nA subset of the nodular histopathologic pattern, miliary infection ( Fig.  7 .27), strongly implies pneumonia secondary to the hematogenous spread of bacteria (septicemia). This pattern of infection can be seen with other organisms, such as Nocardia and the anaerobic Actinomycetes. In these settings, histopathologic examination may show a combination of both nodular disease and alveolar filling.\n\nThere are multiple scenarios for aspiration pneumonia, including cases caused by chemical pneumonitis (so-called Mendelson syndrome), airway obstruction, exogenous lipoid pneumonia, chronic interstitial fibrosis, diffuse bronchiolar disease, bacterial pneumonia, and lung abscess. 76, 77 Aspiration pneumonia refers specifically to the aspiration of bacteria in oropharyngeal secretions, with the bacterial species depending on whether the aspiration event occurs in the community or hospital setting. Recognition of food particles (so-called pulses) is important in diagnosis. These may or may not be invested by giant cells but are usually found in purulent exudate or granulomatous foci. In the organizing phase of the pneumonia, food particles may be found within polyps of organizing pneumonia in the alveolar ducts and alveoli. Lobular pneumonia, lipoid pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, alone or in combination, may also be seen. 73, 78 The pathogens in lung abscess ( Fig. 7 .28) usually encompass a polymicrobial mixture of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, 79 and formation of such abscesses most often is secondary to aspiration (Fig. 7.29) . Infections due to Actinomyces species (Fig. 7 .30) and Nocardia species may also manifest this pattern, as can those infections caused by certain pyogenic bacteria, such as S. aureus and the other organisms listed previously for necrotizing pneumonias. Granulomatous inflammation with foreign bodies may be present if aspiration is the cause (Fig. 7.31 ).\n\nChronic bacterial infections ( Fig. 7 .32) that are slow to resolve as a result of inappropriate initial therapy, involvement with certain microbial species, a noninfectious comorbid process, or an inadequate host response can produce a nonspecific fibroinflammatory pattern, with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, macrophages, or organization with polyps of immature fibroblasts in alveolar ducts and alveolar spaces. [80] [81] [82] [83] If not resorbed, polyps of airspace organization may become polyps of intraalveolar fibrosis, which sometimes ossify (dendriform ossification). Such scarring in chronic pneumonia is often associated with localized interlobular septal and pleural thickening ( Fig. 7.33) , producing a jigsaw puzzle pattern of scarring best seen at scanning magnification.\n\nDiffuse alveolar damage is the histopathologic correlate of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and today lung infection is the leading cause of diffuse alveolar damage and ARDS in the United States. 84 Diffuse alveolar damage may coexist with any of the necroinflammatory patterns described earlier. The initial exudative phase of this ARDS is accompanied by hyaline membranes (Fig. 7.34 ), the later organizing phase by airspace and interstitial fibroplasia. In clinical practice, diffuse alveolar damage accompanied by tissue necrosis is nearly always a manifestation of lung infection.\n\nThe atypical pneumonias include the well-described cases due to Legionella species and the less well-described cases caused by other organisms comprising the atypical group. Legionella infection typically results in an intensely neutrophilic acute fibrinopurulent lobular pneumonia ( Fig. 7 .35A). 3, 5, 71 Legionella bacilli can be identified in silver impregnation-stained sections ( Fig. 7 .35B) or recovered in culture, but newer diagnostic methods, such as real-time PCR and in situ hybridization ( Fig. 7.36 ), can also be applied when standard approaches fail. 85 The histopathologic patterns associated with the other members of the atypical group (i.e., Chlamydia, Mycoplasma) are not well characterized, mainly because investigation of these pneumonias rarely includes biopsy. The few well-documented cases of Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Coxiella infections resemble viral bronchitis or bronchiolitis, with mixed inflammatory infiltrates in airway walls and in the adjacent interstitium ( Fig. 7.37 ). 86, 87 Relative sparing of the peribronchiolar alveolar spaces has been described, although patchy organized fibrinous exudates are seen in some cases and complications may superimpose additional findings.\n\nThe grains and granules formed by the Actinomycetes and bacteria of botryomycosis may have a uniform tinctorial hue on routine H&Estained sections, but sometimes these bacterial aggregations display a distinctive body with a hematoxylinophilic core and an outer investment of eosinophilic material; formation of this array is referred to as the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon (Fig. 7.38 ). Actinomycetes species tend to form similar-appearing granules, and both they and the bacteria of botryomycosis are typically found in the midst of purulent exudates. 69, [88] [89] [90] Nocardia species may aggregate in colonies simulating granules, but with a much looser texture ( Fig. 7 .39) and more monochromatic tinctorial properties. 91 Rarely, these colonies may be identical in appearance to the grains or granules of botryomycosis or actinomycosis in H&E sections.\n\nThe potential for use of microbial pathogens as agents of bioterrorism requires that clinicians be alert to this possibility when communityacquired pneumonias are found to be caused by these agents. In turn, pathologists must become familiar with the histopathologic features these agents can produce. 92 Respiratory disease caused by the inhalation of Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and F. tularensis is especially pertinent in this context and is discussed next. 93\n\nIn 1877, Robert Koch's conclusive demonstration that B. anthracis was the etiologic agent of anthrax revolutionized medicine by linking microbial cause and effect. 6 Inhalational anthrax causes a severe hemorrhagic mediastinitis. [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] This pathologic process in combination with the toxemia (B. anthracis produces an exotoxin with three potent components-protective antigen, lethal factor, and edema factor) from 7 spaces. This distribution suggests hematogenous rather than airway acquisition. Hemorrhagic mediastinitis in a previously healthy adult is essentially pathognomonic for inhalational anthrax. The lymph node parenchyma generally is teeming with intact and fragmented grampositive bacilli, which can be identified as B. anthracis by immunohistochemical studies. 96, 97 Cultures of blood and pleural fluid, if available, are likely to yield the earliest positive diagnostic results. 98 Sputum studies are much less useful in this regard. Specific guidelines for pathology and microbiology specimens for anthrax diagnosis (as well as other potential agents of bioterrorism) are current and available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. 99\n\nPrimary pneumonic plague follows inhalation of Y. pestis bacilli in a potential bioterrorism scenario. 100, 101 The infection begins as bronchiolitis and alveolitis that progress to a lobular and eventual lobar consolidation. 102 The histopathologic features evolve over time, beginning with a serosanguineous intraalveolar fluid accumulation with variable fibrin deposits ( Fig. 7.40 ), progressing through a fibrinopurulent phase, and culminating in a necrotizing lesion. 103 The presence of myriad bacilli the ensuing massive bacteremia severely compromises pulmonary function, leading to death in 40% or more of the cases. Pleural effusion may be present, but pneumonia generally is minor and secondary. In those patients in whom pulmonary parenchymal changes are found, the alveolar spaces contain a serosanguineous fluid with minimal fibrin deposits and some mononuclear cells but few if any neutrophils. 97 Large gram-positive bacilli (some may appear partially gram-negative) without spores pervade the alveolar septal vessels, with a few in the alveolar in the intraalveolar exudates with significantly fewer organisms in the interstitium (a characteristic of primary pneumonia) is one of several pulmonary and extrapulmonary features used to distinguish primary from secondary pneumonic plague. 104 These bacilli may be obvious in H&E-stained sections ( Fig. 7 .41) but generally are better visualized with Giemsa rather than Gram stain. Immunohistochemical staining provides a rapid and specific diagnosis. 102 In contrast to inhalational anthrax, sputum Gram stain and culture are useful tests that are likely to yield a positive result at clinical presentation. Also, because sepsis is an integral component of the pneumonia, it is important to collect blood culture specimens. 105\n\nInhalation of F. tularensis bacilli following a bioterrorism aerosol release is generally expected to result in a slowly progressing pneumonia with a lower case-fatality rate than with either inhalational anthrax or plague. 104, 106 Initially a hemorrhagic and ulcerative bronchiolitis is followed by a fibrinous lobular pneumonia with many macrophages but relatively few neutrophils ( Fig. 7 .42). Necrosis then supervenes and evolves into a granulomatous reaction. The small, gram-negative coccobacillary organisms are difficult to identify in a tissue Gram stain, and the use of silvering techniques (e.g., Steiner, Dieterle, Warthin-Starry) is required to enhance their silhouette. 107 Specific fluorescent antibody testing for formalin-fixed tissue and immunohistochemical studies are available through public health laboratories. In the microbiology laboratory, Gram stain and culture of respiratory secretions are useful for diagnosis, but blood cultures are often negative. Antigen detection and molecular techniques, such as PCR amplification, can also identify F. tularensis. Serologic tests are available but probably would not provide timely information in an outbreak situation. 104\n\nThe stereotypic cellular response to pyogenic bacteria is acute inflammation, characterized by variable numbers of neutrophils. Bacteria may be visualized in various stained preparations made from respiratory tract secretions and washings using the Papanicolaou and Diff-Quik methods. 45 The clinical significance of bacteria in such specimens may be limited owing to potential contamination by oral flora and the problem of distinguishing colonization from infection. However, when the upper respiratory tract can be bypassed by means of either transtracheal or transthoracic needle aspiration, the presence of bacteria becomes much more significant, especially when sheets of neutrophils or necroinflammatory debris are present ( Fig. 7 .43A), as would be the case with a typical lobar or lobular consolidation, lung abscess, or other complex pneumonia. 53, 90, 108, 109 In this context, transthoracic needle aspiration can establish the etiologic diagnosis of community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias in both children and adults when coupled with modern microbiologic methods. 49, 58, 110, 111 Proponents consider it an underused technique the potential benefits of which, in experienced hands, outweigh the modest associated risks. Many types of bacilli and cocci can be seen within and around neutrophils on Diff-Quik-stained smears ( Fig. 7 .43B). A smear can also be prepared for Gram stain and the aspirate needle rinsed in nonbacteriostatic sterile saline or nutrient broths for culture. The size (length and width) and shape of organisms and the Gram reaction allow rough categorization of organisms into groups, such as enteric-type bacilli, pseudomonads, fusiform anaerobic-type bacilli, tiny coccobacillary types suggestive of the Haemophilus-Bacteroides group ( Fig. 7.44 ), or gram-positive cocci. 112 Branching filamentous forms suggest Actinomycetes or Nocardia species (Fig. 7 .45), with the latter distinguished by being partially acid-fast. 113, 114 Although most aspirated cavitary lung lesions with the abscess pattern are the result of bacterial infection, considerations in the differential diagnosis include necrotic neoplasm (particularly squamous cell carcinoma), granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and nonbacterial infections associated with suppurative granulomas such as those due to fungi and mycobacteria.\n\nMicrobiology techniques in current use for the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia are summarized in Box 7.7. 39, [115] [116] [117] The traditional morphologic and functional approach to microbiologic diagnosis is gradually shifting to molecular methods, and diagnostic arrays of common respiratory pathogens are marketed by several vendors; they are adjusted for laboratory size, for individual random access testing, or for test batching in larger laboratories.\n\nThe work-up of respiratory secretions such as sputum in the microbiology laboratory may or may not be indicated based on the clinical and immunologic status of the patient. The value of microbiologic work-up for community-acquired pneumonias has been questioned 7 or the presence of many benign oral squamous cells. Pneumonia in the hospitalized or immunocompromised patient requires an aggressive strategy to collect a good sputum sample for Gram stain and culture. If this attempt is unsatisfactory or the findings are nondiagnostic, then the use of invasive techniques beginning with fiberoptic bronchoscopy and BAL with protected catheters should be considered. 60, 62, 126 Anaerobic pulmonary infections, typically in the form of a lung abscess, can also be approached in this way or with transthoracic needle aspiration. 79 Gram staining of tissue sections from bronchoscopic or surgical biopsy specimens is notoriously insensitive and nonspecific. As with sputum, the presence of a predominant bacterial morphotype in a distinctive necroinflammatory background carries diagnostic weight, for some time, and evolving guidelines from two specialty societies-the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America-have lately coalesced. [118] [119] [120] [121] Despite microbiologic testing, in a retrospective review of 2259 patients with radiographic evidence of pneumonia hospitalized from January 2010-June 2012 in selected US communities, no pathogen was detected in the majority of patients. 122 When a carefully collected specimen reveals one or two predominant bacterial morphotypes on a well-prepared Gram stain ( Fig. 7.46) , especially in the presence of neutrophils and few or no squamous cells, a presumptive diagnosis can be offered and correlated with whatever grows on culture plates. [123] [124] [125] A mixed bacterial population is usually considered nondiagnostic, especially in the absence of inflammation A A B types of gram-negative pneumonias ( Fig. 7 .48) can also be confirmed with well-prepared Gram stains. 81 In the case of an abscess, a mixture of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli in tissue (illustrated earlier in Fig. 7 .29) is a useful finding that is helpful in supporting a diagnosis of an anaerobic infection. When organisms are sparse, other stains such as Giemsa or silver impregnation may highlight the organisms in the exudates ( Fig. 7 .49). The Gram stain is also useful for evaluating infections with granules and allows differentiation of the agents of botryomycosis (the grampositive cocci or gram-negative bacilli) from the filamentous Actinomyces organisms (Fig. 7 .50).\n\nStaining with methenamine silver is the best procedure for detecting Nocardia organisms. The modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain allows for differentiation of Nocardia (positive) from the anaerobic Actinomyces (negative). 114 Commercially available immunohistochemical reagents exist for relatively few bacterial species. Immunohistochemistry testing for the potential bioterrorist agents discussed in this chapter is available through the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia. It is expected that commercial reagents will become increasingly available for the common etiologic agents in the near future. 33 Culture media that will allow recovery of common bacterial species causing pneumonia from various types of respiratory samples (secretions, washings, brushings, aspirates, and tissues) include sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, and McConkey agar. These media also will support growth of B. anthracis and Y. pestis. Buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar is the primary medium for Legionella species. Because Legionella organisms survive poorly in respiratory secretions, rapid especially when correlated with available clinical and laboratory data. Because histology laboratories do not generally observe the same level of caution in reagent preparation and storage as microbiology laboratories, it is worth remembering that tissue sections are prone to false-positive results from in vitro bacterial contamination.\n\nIn those cases where bacteria are visible on H&E-stained sections, the Gram stain can be helpful in confirming a presumptive etiology. For example, pairs and chains of gram-positive cocci in a necroinflammatory background suggest a streptococcal pneumonia, whereas numerous slender gram-negative bacilli investing and infiltrating blood vessels are characteristic of Pseudomonas pneumonia ( Fig. 7 .47). Other The Actinomycetes are best isolated from invasive specimens such as needle aspirates and transbronchial and lung biopsy specimens. The laboratory should be alerted to search for these agents because special consideration must be given to culture setup and incubation conditions. 89 The Actinomycetes responsible for actinomycosis require anaerobic media and atmosphere as well as prolonged incubation. Nocardia, an aerobic Actinomycete, grows well on most nonselective media but requires extended incubation. Determination of colonial morphology, Gram and acid-fast stains, and a few biochemical tests generally suffice transport and immediate plating is essential for recovery. BCYE is also a good all-purpose medium for growing other fastidious species, including F. tularensis. However, F. tularensis grows best in cysteine-enriched media. 127 In addition to respiratory samples, blood can be obtained for cultures in patients sick enough to lead to suspicion of bacteremia; pleural fluid culture can be used when effusions are present. Positive cultures of these normally sterile fluids circumvent the interpretive problems associated with bacterial growth in sputum samples. to identify these organisms at the genus level. However, genotype rather than phenotype characteristics are required to identify newly emergent species. 128 In general, the laboratory diagnosis of pneumonia caused by most of the atypical agents is difficult because systems are not routinely available or are costly, cumbersome, or unsafe. For the atypical agents (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Coxiella species), serologic testing has been the method of choice for diagnosis. 67, 129 Classic cold agglutinin and complement fixation tests for these agents have largely been replaced by enzyme immunoassay and microimmunofluorescence testing. 87, 130, 131 Serologic methods are also useful for the diagnosis of tularemia because of the difficulty in culturing the fastidious bacterium.\n\nLegionella pneumonia is a common form of severe pneumonia that is not readily diagnosed for a number of reasons, including the organism's fastidiousness. 132 In the microbiology laboratory, the direct fluorescent antibody test and culture on buffered BCYE agar have been the mainstays of diagnosis. Culture is considered the diagnostic gold standard but is only 60% sensitive. Serologic testing is available for most of the Legionella pneumophila serotypes, which account for 90% of the pneumonia cases; however, the need to collect paired sera weeks apart limits its usefulness in the acutely ill patient. Antigen detection in urine has become commercially available for both L. pneumophila and S. pneumoniae; because the need to collect acute and convalescent sera is obviated, it has become a frequently used diagnostic test. 132, 133 Its advantage lies in its potential to effect early treatment decisions through rapid diagnosis. Its disadvantage lies in the fact that it identifies only patients infected with L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (LP1), the most prevalent species and serotype, but none of the non-LP1 serotypes or cases due to other Legionella species. [134] [135] [136] The use of molecular diagnostic tools (in situ hybridization and nucleic acid amplification by PCR or other methods) to detect these agents has been reported. 85, 136, 137 PCR nested assays are replacing more and more of the above classical methods with sensitive, specific, and rapid diagnostic technique. Multiplex assay, to detect multiple agents in a single reaction, would seem to be an ideal pursuit for the laboratory diagnosis of the most common community-acquired pneumonias, including those due to the atypical pneumonia agents. 36, [138] [139] [140] [141] \n\nThe key morphologic and microbiologic features of the bacterial pneumonias are summarized in Table 7 .5. The presence of purulent exudates or significant numbers of neutrophils in biopsy or cytologic samples should always trigger a search for bacterial infection. Because lung biopsies are usually performed late in the clinical course after procedures have been performed and bacterial infections have been excluded and/or treated with antibiotics, neutrophilic exudates may not signify bacterial infection unless accompanied by necrosis, as in an abscess. Instead, consideration should be given to one of several noninfectious acute inflammatory diseases, with an immunologic basis, that can mimic bacterial infection. Some of these include granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Goodpasture syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and microscopic polyangiitis, all conditions that can produce acute inflammation predominantly involving alveolar septal blood vessels (\"capillaritis\"). On occasion, capillaritis can result in airspace accumulation of neutrophils, further raising concern for bronchopneumonia. Centrally necrotic or cavitary neoplasms of various types may mimic as a \"last resort\" effort. 142, 143 In recent years, delays in the diagnosis of mycobacterial infection have markedly decreased, thanks in part to recommendations from the CDC for improving laboratory turnaround time and to the response of the diagnostics industry with better methods and technology. Because direct acid-fast smears of respiratory specimens yield negative findings in at least half of the cases, 144 and because many mycobacterial species are fastidious and slow-growing, the biopsy results may be the first suggestion of a mycobacterial infection. The biopsy findings can also define the organism's relationship to a histopathologic lesion and host response-important information in evaluating the significance of a culture result. Although an isolate of M. tuberculosis is always taken seriously, obtaining a single isolate of a nontuberculous mycobacterium from the respiratory tract does not necessarily implicate the organism as the cause of disease. 145 \n\nThe mycobacterial species can be categorized in two clinically relevant groups: Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) and the nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). MTC includes the subspecies Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, and Mycobacterium microti. The last three species produce tuberculosis in some areas of the world, but in the United States the prevalence of such disease is very low.\n\nM. tuberculosis is the most virulent mycobacterial species and an unequivocal pathogen that is responsible for numerous deaths worldwide. This organism is the etiologic agent of tuberculosis in its various forms, which are listed in Box 7.8.\n\nPrimary tuberculosis occurs in patients without previous exposure or with the loss of acquired immunity. Progressive primary tuberculosis occurs in patients with inadequate acquired immunity-that is, impaired cellular immunity. Postprimary tuberculosis, also referred to as secondary or reinfection-reactivation tuberculosis, occurs in patients with previous immunity to the organism and accounts for most clinical cases of tuberculosis. 146, 147 Many clinical experts consider that most cases of active tuberculosis in adults with normal immunity arise from reactivation of latent infection (postprimary tuberculosis), whereas reinfection with a new strain derived from the environment (primary or postprimary tuberculosis) can occur in the immunocompromised patient. More recently, DNA fingerprinting methods (genotyping) have challenged this dogma by showing that exogenous reinfection accounts for a significant percentage of cases in some areas of the world. 148 Miliary tuberculosis and extrapulmonary disease can occur with any of these forms. 146, 149 Primary tuberculosis is usually a mild illness that is often not recognized. The bacillemia that occurs during its development can seed extrapulmonary organs and set the stage for subsequent reactivation. abscesses grossly and microscopically, and exceptionally well-differentiated adenocarcinomas containing glands filled with detritus may mimic inflammatory and bacterial diseases. Suppurative granulomas can have a bacterial, mycobacterial, or fungal etiology. Even the miliary necroinflammatory lesion typical of bacterial infection can be produced by viruses, some fungi, and even protozoa (e.g., Toxoplasmagondii). Aspiration, common in hospitalized patients, may manifest with an acute bronchopneumonia/bronchiolitis type of pattern, and it should also be in the differential diagnosis as a contributing or etiologic factor when considering most pneumonias; microscopic identification of foreign material is a definitive diagnostic clue, frequently gained only from histopathologic examination. 78 \n\nThe surgical pathologist tends to encounter mycobacterial infections in lung biopsies when standard clinical diagnostic approaches to pulmonary infiltrates are unsuccessful and the lesions persist or progress. Tuberculosis is but one of several different types of lung infection that can manifest clinically as community-acquired pneumonia, resulting in delay until an invasive procedure such as transbronchial biopsy, transthoracic needle biopsy, or surgical lung biopsy is performed, often Approximately 5% of patients pass through latency to postprimary disease within 2 years of primary infection, and another 5% do so later in their lives. 150\n\nRecognized NTM species, many of which were identified during the past decade, number more than 125. 151, 152 However, relatively few cause pulmonary disease. 145 \n\nThe histopathologic patterns produced by mycobacteria are listed in Box 7.9. The radiologic, gross, and microscopic patterns of mycobacterial disease reflect the virulence of the various mycobacterial species as well as the patient's prior exposure and immune status. [157] [158] [159] [160] Primary Tuberculosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs typically in the best-aerated lung regions (anterior segments of the upper lobes, lingua and middle lobe, or basal segments of the lower lobes). 158 The disease passes through progressive phases of exudation, recruitment of macrophages and T lymphocytes, and granuloma formation followed by repair with granulation tissue, fibrosis, and mineralization. 147, 161 Macrophage-laden bacilli also travel to the hilar lymph nodes, where the phases are repeated. This combination of events produces the classic Ghon complex, consisting of a peripheral 1-to 2-cm lung nodule ( Fig. 7 .51) and an enlarged, sometimes calcified hilar lymph node. In both locations, the histopathologic hallmark is a necrotizing granuloma ( Fig. 7 .52) composed of epithelioid cells with variable numbers of Langhans giant cells, a peripheral investment of lymphocytes, and a central zone of caseation necrosis, a form of necrosis attributed to apoptosis. 146, 162 A spectrum of lesions may be seen, from the tuberculoid \"hard\" granuloma without necrosis and rare organisms to the multibacillary necrotic lesion with scant epithelioid cells. 163 In a minority of patients the lesions enlarge and progress as a result of increased necrosis or liquifaction. The complications of tuberculosis are listed in Box 7.10 and illustrated in Fig. 7 .53. Other complications may include extension into blood vessels with miliary ( Fig. 7 .54) or systemic dissemination, lymphatic drainage into the pleura with granulomatous pleuritis and effusions, involvement of bronchi by bronchocentric granulomatous lesions ( Fig.  7 .55), or tuberculous bronchopneumonia. Granulomas may also encroach upon blood vessels, mimicking a \"granulomatous\" vasculitis. The hemophagocytic syndrome, which has been implicated in a variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, has also been associated with tuberculosis. 164\n\nPostprimary tuberculosis, the most common form in adults, typically involves the apices of the upper lobes, producing granulomatous lesions with greater caseation, often with cavities and variable degrees of fibrosis and retraction of the parenchyma. 149, 160 Fibrosis and bronchiectasis occur with the healing of cavities and is the major cause of pulmonary disability in this disease. 165 Recent studies have proposed that postprimary disease begins as a form of lipoid pneumonia, with bacilli-laden foamy alveolar macrophages and bronchiolar obstruction progressing to caseating cavitary disease and microvascular occlusion due to delayed-type hypersensitivity. 166 Extension to other lobes or hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes and miliary spread through the lungs and to extrapulmonary sites can occur. Other presentation patterns include acute and organizing diffuse alveolar damage with advanced or miliary disease, acute tuberculous bronchopneumonia, and the solitary pulmonary nodule Disseminated disease is typically associated with the immunocompromise produced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, in which the disease tends to target the gastrointestinal tract (the likely portal of entry) and pulmonary and reticuloendothelial disease signifies dissemination. 171 In this setting, NTM bacilli (predominantly MAC) proliferate characteristically to high levels in poorly formed granulomas or in sheets and clusters of plump, finely vacuolated macrophages (\"pseudo-Gaucher\" cells) containing abundant phagocytosed intracytoplasmic bacilli (Fig. 7.57) .\n\nA distinctive form of NTM disease occurs as the \"Lady Windermere syndrome. \" In the classic clinical scenario, an elderly, nonsmoking, immunocompetent woman of particular habits, demeanor, and body type presents with multiple pulmonary nodules, preferentially involving the middle lobe and lingula. The airway-centric granulomas and bronchiectasis can be subtle or pronounced (Fig. 7 .58); these findings have been recognized as one of the patterns of middle lobe syndrome. 172 NTM bacilli can also colonize bronchiectatic lung from any cause, with resultant granulomatous inflammation predominantly affecting the airway walls-presumably as a result of localized decreased mucociliary clearance.\n\nHypersensitivity-like pulmonary disease has been associated with contaminated water in hot tubs (\"hot tub lung\") and other environmental sources such as humidifiers and air conditioners. 16 Biopsy reveals a miliary bronchiolocentric and interstitial granulomatous pattern, similar to that produced by hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Fig. 7.59) . A similar infection-colonization-hypersensitivity syndrome has been described in workers exposed to metalworking fluid aerosols. 173 The clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings are similar to disease associated with hot tub use and other water sources except that a distinctive rapid-growing NTM species, M. immunogenum, has been recovered almost exclusively. Organisms are difficult to find in these cases but can sometimes be recovered in culture or with molecular techniques. Whether this entity represents an infection, a colonization, a hypersensitivity reaction, or a hybrid condition remains unresolved at this time.\n\nA rare morphologic manifestation of mycobacterial infection is the so-called spindle cell inflammatory pseudotumor (Fig. 7.60 ), which may occur in lung, skin, lymph nodes, and a number of other sites in immunocompromised patients. 174 The etiologic agents usually are NTM (MAC and M. kansasii), but M. tuberculosis has also been identified in some cases. Another uncommon variant is proximal endobronchial disease, discussed earlier in the spectrum of postprimary tuberculosis.\n\n(tuberculoma). A proximal endobronchial form may mimic a neoplasm, noteworthy for its necrosis and large numbers of bacilli. 167 Because characteristic granulomatous morphology may not be visible around the necrotic material, stains for mycobacteria should be considered for all necrotic endobronchial samples.\n\nTuberculosis is a rare cause of chronic pleural effusion. Pleural biopsy may be included when clinical suspicion for tuberculosis is high, both to improve recovery of the organisms and to visualize granulomas. The presence of pleural caseating granulomas can be considered nearly diagnostic of tuberculous pleural effusion and a powerful indication for treatment 168 ; lack of true caseation in the granulomas expands the differential diagnosis to include sarcoid, fungal infection, and rheumatoid disease.\n\nNTM infections may be similar to those due to M. tuberculosis, but certain differences have been noted. For example, the NTM pathogens do not cause the same sequence of primary or postprimary disease, and systemic dissemination does not occur except in the immunocompromised patient. M. kansasii is more virulent than MAC, and the infection-associated histopathologic pattern is more like that produced by M. tuberculosis. 169 Infections due to MAC and other common pulmonary NTM pathogens generally manifest as one of five clinicopathologic entities: solitary pulmonary nodule, chronic progressive pulmonary disease, disseminated disease, chronic bronchiolitis with bronchiectasis, and hypersensitivity-like pneumonitis. 147, 170 Solitary pulmonary nodules generally exhibit granulomas resembling those caused by M. tuberculosis.\n\nChronic progressive disease also resembles tuberculosis, with upper lobe thin-walled cavities and granulomatous inflammation with or without caseous necrosis (Fig. 7.56 ). Multiple confluent granulomas in fibrosis can mimic sarcoidosis. Organisms are usually sparse and more difficult to find in the immunocompetent patient. This presentation most often is seen in patients with underlying chronic lung disease, such as COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, pneumoconiosis, reflux disease, or preexisting cavitary lung disease of any cause (including old tuberculous cavities). Most cases are due to M. avium complex and manifest as polypoid lesions in immunocompromised HIV-infected patients, but this lesion may also be seen in immunocompetent persons. 175 Certain species of rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGMs) are capable of producing pulmonary disease, albeit infrequently. 145, 176, 177 M. abscessus is the third most frequently recovered NTM respiratory pathogen in the United States, after M. avium complex and M. kansasii. M. abscessus produces chronic lung infection that has a striking clinical and pathologic similarity to M. avium complex infection, including the propensity to involve the lungs of patients with bronchiectasis. The RGMs have also been thought to colonize lipoid pneumonia 178 ; however, it is more likely that the pathogenesis of the lung injury pattern caused by the RGMs is similar to that seen in skin and soft tissue cases, in which various combinations of suppurative foci, poorly formed or necrotizing granulomas, scattered multinucleated giant cells, and vacuoles are typical (termed pseudocysts). 179 These combined features may mimic lipoid pneumonia and constitute an important clue to the presence of RGM infection.\n\nFine-needle aspiration biopsy has been successfully used to diagnose both tuberculous pulmonary lesions and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. 180, 181 The finding of finely granular amorphous necrotic debris associated with aggregates of epithelioid histiocytes (with or without multinucleate giant cells; Fig. 7 .61) is suggestive of a mycobacterial or fungal infection. 182 In this setting, necrotic cancers must be excluded by a thorough search for atypical cells. Epithelioid granulomas manifest a similar cellular pattern, but the granular necrotic debris is absent. Another pattern that may be seen, particularly in specimens from the immunocompromised patient, is a pure histiocytic or macrophage reaction with few or no epithelioid or multinucleate giant cells or necrotic debris. Numerous bacilli may be present in the distended cytoplasm of histiocytes and in the extracellular background. In air-dried (Diff-Quik) and alcohol-fixed (H&E-or Papanicolaou-stained) smears, the bacilli may be recognized as negative images (Fig. 7.62) The use of fine-needle aspirate to target and harvest potential microbiologically positive diagnostic specimens is an important technique, especially in underdeveloped countries where bronchoscopy may not be available. Fine-needle aspiration, especially of affected lymph nodes, combined with an automated rapid PCR diagnostic platform where available (such as Xpert MTB/RIF, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California) is a public health opportunity for faster diagnosis and containment of disease in areas with a large incidence. 181, 183 Microbiology The traditional as well as newer molecular approaches to the laboratory diagnosis of mycobacterial lung infection are outlined in Box 7.11. The mycobacterium is a slender, slightly curved bacillus 4 \u00b5m in length, often with a beaded appearance; the length, curvature, and beading are sometimes accentuated in M. kansasii. 184 In tissue sections or on smears, the Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast stain or auramine-rhodamine fluorescent stains are most often recommended for best visualization; practice among pathologists in the use of acid-fast stains, quality control, and their perception of the value of such stains varies considerably. 185 Organisms are most often found within the area of granulomatous reaction at the immediate periphery of the necrotic zone of the granulomas or the cellular reactive process in the lining of cavities. Sections from several tissue blocks may be required to find organisms. Bacilli are rarely found in the absence of necrosis except in smears from immunocompromised of compelling histopathologic findings. 195 Furthermore, tissue culture is prone to sampling error unless more than one site is sampled. 196 Specimens may also be smear-positive and culture-negative in patients whose disease has been treated. When only a rare bacillus is found, strict criteria must be maintained and artifactual pseudo acid-fast bacilli excluded. As a general rule, a cutoff value of three organisms for a positive result seems prudent. False-positive smears can also result from contamination with local tap water, which may harbor mycobacteria.\n\nTraditional solid media (Lowenstein-Jensen, Petragani, and Middlebrook agars) have given way to liquid media (radiometric and nonradiometric) as the first-line systems. Liquid media have demonstrated increased recovery of mycobacteria and decreased time to detection. They also facilitate rapid and accurate susceptibility testing. 144, 197 Some of these liquid systems are manual with visual inspection, whereas others are fully automated and continuously monitored. Most laboratories back up liquid systems with conventional media because no system, at this time, is capable of identifying all isolates. Commercially available DNA probes that hybridize to the mycobacterial RNA have largely replaced traditional biochemical testing, and these methods have significantly shortened the time to identification of M. tuberculosis and selected NTM. 198 For identification of the less frequently isolated species of NTM, for which probes are not available, it usually is necessary to send specimens to reference or state laboratories, where identification is accomplished by either biochemical testing, cell wall analysis using chromatographic techniques, or genotypic sequencing. 151 The rapid differentiation of M. tuberculosis from NTM species is clinically very important because the latter are much less infectious. In this context, molecular techniques have decreased the time to detection and identification of mycobacteria to less than 3 weeks in most instances. Direct nucleic acid amplification testing of clinical specimens using commercially available PCR or transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) methods can reduce detection and identification times to less than 8 hours. 196 Immunochromatographic techniques based on the detection of secreted mycobacterial proteins have the potential to reduce these times even further. 199 Although nucleic acid amplification is faster, its overall accuracy is higher than that of smears but less than that of culture. 198 In fact, no single test at this time has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to stand alone; therefore the use of a combination of available techniques, depending on the clinical and economic setting, may be the best overall strategy. 200, 201 Interpretation of a culture isolate can sometimes be difficult. The presence of M. tuberculosis is always significant. M. kansasii is an important pathogen, and its isolation is usually also significant, although it may represent colonization. The significance of other NTM isolates is variable depending on whether there is clinical and radiologic evidence of disease. It is in this setting that histopathologic examination plays an important role. M. avium complex can be isolated from the respiratory tract of otherwise healthy adults as well as HIV-infected patients with no clinical or radiologic evidence of disease. The American Thoracic Society has proposed diagnostic criteria requiring that certain clinical, radiologic, and laboratory parameters be met in order to prove pathogenicity. 145 A synopsis of the key morphologic and microbiologic attributes of mycobacterial lung infections is presented in Table 7 .6. Mycobacteria produce a wide spectrum of inflammatory patterns, both granulomatous and nongranulomatous. Although the potential differential diagnostic listing is long, in practical terms major considerations are fungal infections, sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and bacterial infections that produce suppurative granulomas, such as those due to Nocardia, Actinomyces, Brucella, and Francisella species. Generally, the use of special stains and cultures will resolve most diagnostic dilemmas. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis can usually be excluded based on the patients, in which they are visible and abundant within pseudo-Gaucher cells on H&E-stained sections, or as ghosted intracellular outlines with Giemsa-type stains. Dead bacilli lose their acid-fast character but may sometimes be identified with the GMS stain. The NTM, especially the RGM, may be more sensitive to acid alcohol decolorization and may not stain well or at all with the auramine-rhodamine method. 145 There are several recent series of confirmed identification using anti-MPT64 for immunostaining of the M. tuberculosis complex in pathology and cytology specimens. [186] [187] [188] Differentiation of mycobacterial species in Ziehl-Neelsen-positive, formalin-fixed sections has also been achieved by in situ hybridization techniques with specific nucleic acid probes. [189] [190] [191] PCR amplification plus identification is likely to be the most sensitive technique in those cases in which the lesion is suspected to harbor mycobacteria but yields a negative result on acid-fast staining. 192 This technique may also be useful in cases in which the characteristic granulomatous pattern of inflammation is lacking or mycobacteria have been identified in acid-fast-stained sections but culture results remain negative or cultures were not performed. 193, 194 Conventional wisdom states that culture is more sensitive than direct examination; however, the literature clearly documents cases where acid-fast stains on tissue biopsies succeeded when cultures of tissue failed-an outcome that speaks to the virtue of perseverance in the face \n\nThe pathologist examining fungi can provide at least a provisional diagnosis at the group or genus level and make a judgment about fungal invasion or the presence of fungi as a pathogen, saprophyte, or allergen. One effective diagnostic strategy available is the rapid identification of fungi in frozen sections, routine sections, or cytologic samples. 45, 202, 203 This approach is especially important when opportunistic infection is being considered in the immunocompromised patient. Prudent practice requires caution in morphologic diagnosis alone; integration of microbiologic data and histopathologic findings is required.\n\nNearly 70,000 fungi are known, and approximately 100 have been recovered from respiratory infections. 204 A small number are implicated as pathogenic on a consistent basis; these are listed in Box 7.12.\n\nLike mycobacterial species, fungal pathogens typically produce one or more nodular lesions in the normal host ( Fig. 7 .63); these may become cavitary as the lesions evolve ( Fig. 7.64 ). Inflammatory histopathologic patterns that suggest the presence of a fungal infection are summarized in Box 7.13. As is the case for other etiologic agents, there are no absolutely diagnostic patterns. Overlap is common and atypical reactions occur, ranging from overwhelming diffuse alveolar damage, little or no reaction, or sheets of organisms in the immunocompromised patient. Proximal endobronchial disease mimicking a neoplasm has also been described for various fungal species. 205 Detection of the etiologic agent in tissue by microscopic examination, ancillary tests, or culture confers specificity and significance to the listed patterns. Large spherules with endospores characteristic of Coccidioides immitis or yeast with large mucoid capsules of C. neoformans can be diagnostic. However, atypical forms of these organisms can be misleading and challenging. For example, in aerated cavities or in the setting of bronchopleural fistula, Coccidioides species may produce branching septate and moniliform hyphae or immature morula-like spherules mimicking other fungi (e.g., hyaline molds and Blastomyces dermatitidis). 40 Similarly, C. neoformans, H. capsulatum, and S. schenckii have been reported to produce hyphae or pseudohyphae in tissue, whereas acapsular C. neoformans may mimic other yeasts or Pneumocystis organisms. 206 Mycelial morphology is helpful when it is characteristic of a specific genus or group. For example, broad, sparsely septate, nonparallel, twisted or irregular in diameter, thin-walled mycelia with variable wide-angle branching characterize Zygomycetes. Progressively proliferating, regularly septate, 45-degree angle, dichotomously branching mycelia with parallel walls are typical of Aspergillus species (Fig. 7.65 ). In the case of Aspergillus, an important point is that only the presence of a fruiting body (conidiophore with sterigmata and conidia) permits diagnosis at the genus level, and there are many Aspergillus look-alikes in tissue, such as Fusarium, Paecilomyces, Acremonium, Bipolaris, Pseudallescheria boydii, and its asexual anamorph Scedosporium apiospermum. 206 Sometimes careful examination of tissue with special stains under high magnification or oil immersion will reveal clues, such as in situ sporulation, allowing a more definitive diagnosis. 41 However, these clues are often subtle, and it is important to defer to culture whenever possible. 207 Typical morphologic injury patterns and related etiologic agents are detailed next.\n\nBlastomycosis, the chronic granulomatous and suppurative infection produced by B. dermatitidis, is essentially a North American disease, concentrated in the Ohio and the Mississippi River valleys. The prevalence of infection is particularly high in the state of Mississippi. Blastomycosis is the third most common endemic mycosis in North America, following histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. It may occur in patients with normal immunity as well as those immunocompromised by diseases or medical therapy. [208] [209] [210] The isolated nodular manifestation can simulate lung cancer radiologically. 211 The disease almost always begins in the lungs, although skin and bone are other common sites of involvement. In the lung, pathologic manifestations include focal or diffuse infiltrates, rare lobar consolidation, miliary nodules, solitary nodules, and acute or organizing diffuse alveolar damage (Box 7.14). 208, [211] [212] [213] Necrotizing granulomas are characteristic and often of the suppurative type ( Fig. 7.66A ), but nonnecrotizing granulomas may be found as well.\n\nThe of community-acquired pneumonias in some metropolitan areas. [216] [217] [218] [219] Granulomas are characteristic and may occur with or without necrosis. Intact spherules induce fibrocaseous granulomas (Fig. 7.67A ), whereas ruptured spherules may incite suppurative and bronchocentric granulomatosis (BCG)-like reactions (Fig. 7.67B ). 216 The large mature spherule (up to 40 to 60 \u00b5m in diameter) has a thick refractile wall lined by or filled with endospores; it constitutes the key diagnostic finding (Fig. 7.67C ). This finding allows the distinction of coccidioidomycosis from other fungal infections such as blastomycosis and histoplasmosis, which are associated with similar histopathologic reaction patterns. In aerated cavities or in the setting of bronchopleural fistula, mycelia resembling various hyaline molds may be seen with or without a variety of mature and immature spherules (Figs. 7.20 and 7.67D). Coccidioides spherule look-alikes include large-variant B. dermatitidis, adiaspiromycosis, pollen grains, and pulses (legume seeds).\n\nHistoplasmosis, the most common pulmonary fungal infection worldwide, is endemic in the Ohio and the Mississippi River valleys of North America and is the most common endemic mycosis in AIDS. 220 The clinical forms of H. capsulatum infection 55, 203, 221, 222 are presented in Box 7.16. The histopathologic correlates include a spectrum ranging from an exudative to a granulomatous process influenced by such factors as the fungal burden and the immune status of the patient. In patients with normal defenses, the characteristic histopathology is dominated by well-formed necrotizing and nonnecrotizing granulomas occurring as solitary lesions indistinguishable from other granulomatous infections. Other presentations include miliary nodules (Fig. 7.68 ), cavitary lesions, and laminated fibrous solitary nodules (Fig. 7.69 ) that may be partially calcified (sometimes referred to as residual granulomas). In patients with impaired immunity, striking macrophage response with numerous intracellular yeasts is a characteristic pattern (Fig. 7.70A ). The exudative lesion resembles acute lobular pneumonia with fibrinopurulent exudates. 223 typically 8 to 15 \u00b5m in diameter, with some forms measuring up to 30 \u00b5m (Fig. 7.66B) . These large forms can mimic small Coccidioides spherules, 214 H. capsulatum organisms are yeasts (2 to 5 \u00b5m), with narrow-based unequal budding (Fig. 7.71; Fig. 7 .70B). They may be seen on H&Estained sections and, when numerous, appear as small refractile ovoid structures within macrophages. Yeasts typically occur in clusters but may be rare in old granulomas. A search for budding organisms in these situations may prove futile. Sometimes, yeasts may have dark-staining foci resembling Pneumocystis organisms. Also, some yeast cells may be surrounded by a clear space and may be mistaken for Cryptococcus. 55 Other look-alikes include Candida species, P. marneffei, capsule-deficient cryptococci, intracellular B. dermatitidis, and Hamazaki-Wesenberg bodies. \n\nSeven clinical forms occur, but they rarely cause lung infections in North America. In areas of high endemicity, such as Brazil, the several forms can mimic malignancy or sarcoidosis. 224, 225 The histopathology resembles that of other mycoses and can be exudative or granulomatous. Paracoccidioides braziliensis appears as a large spherical yeast (10 to 60 \u00b5m) with multiple buds attached by narrow necks (a \"steering wheel\" or \"ship's wheel\" appearance). 226 When budding is sparse, look-alikes include H. capsulatum with small intracellular forms, B. dermatitidis and capsule-deficient cryptococci for medium-sized forms, and C. immitis or C. posadasii for large forms.\n\nInfection by Sporothrix schenckii is usually confined to the skin, subcutis, and lymphatic pathways, but the organism can disseminate to the lungs. Rarely, S. schenckii is a primary pulmonary pathogen. 227 The organism can produce cavitary disease in the form of a single lesion. Infection may be bilateral and apical, progressive and destructive, or it may be identified clinically as a solitary pulmonary nodule. Microscopically, caseous and suppurative granulomas (Fig. 7 .72A) occur with variable numbers of round to oval, small (2 to 3 \u00b5m), narrow budding yeast ( Fig. 7 .72B) or cigar-shaped forms. 228 Nonnecrotizing granulomas also occur. Asteroid bodies are an important clue, especially when organisms are sparse, as is often the case. Look-alikes include H. capsulatum, acapsular cryptococci, Candida organisms, and Hamazaki-Wesenberg bodies.\n\nSoutheast Asia is the endemic setting of the unique dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei. The disease it produces is not seen in North America except in travelers, especially immunocompromised persons.\n\nAsia and a significant clue to the presence of AIDS in that area. 229 The respiratory tract is the portal of entry, with pulmonary infiltrates and disseminated disease, especially involving the skin. Microscopically, alveolar macrophages stuffed with spherical to oval yeast-like cells (2.5 to 5 \u00b5m) are seen, each with a single transverse septum; short hyphal forms and elongated, curved \"sausage\" forms may be formed in necrotic and cavitary lesions. 230, 231 The septum distinguishes it from H. capsulatum, its look-alike. 229, 232 Cryptococcosis C. neoformans is a ubiquitous, facultative intracellular yeast. Pulmonary cryptococcosis occurs worldwide but has a particularly high incidence in the United States. 233 The pathogenicity and histopathologic features of lung infection depends largely on the patient's immune status, as illustrated earlier in Fig. 7 .7 and summarized in Box 7.17. In the normal host, a substantial proportion of cryptococcal infections are asymptomatic, others are symptomatic, with infiltrates or nodules. Immunocompromised patients are almost invariably symptomatic and often develop disseminated disease with a predilection for the brain and meninges. Pulmonary injury patterns include single or multiple large nodules, segmental or diffuse infiltrates, cavitary lesions, and miliary nodules. Normal hosts most often develop nodules comprising fibrocaseous granulomas (Fig. 7.73A ), or granulomatous pneumonia (Fig. 7.73B) . Immunocompromised patients are more likely to have histiocytic (Fig.  7 .73C) or mucoid infiltrates without inflammation (Fig. 7.73D) .\n\nThe cryptococcal organisms are round yeast forms ranging in diameter from 2 to 15 \u00b5m, with an average size of 4 to 7 \u00b5m. Cryptococcal yeasts are visible on H&E-stained sections as pale gray to light blue structures, frequently with attached smaller buds. They often occur in clusters and can sometimes be found within giant cells. 203 The mucicarmine stain highlights the capsule (Fig. 7 .74A); but with capsule-deficient forms Fig. 7 .74B) the pleomorphic appearance can be confused with that of other yeast forms (e.g., H. capsulatum, B. dermatitidis, S. schenckii) and sometimes Pneumocystis.\n\nThe lungs of patients with the most severe immunodeficiency may show myriad yeasts in alveolar septal capillaries (Fig. 7.74A) , with little if any intraalveolar reaction 234 ; this form of the disease may also be associated with mucoid pneumonia. 235 The mucoid pneumonia (Fig.  7 .75A) of cryptococcal infection can be confirmed with mucin stains such as Alcian blue (Fig. 7.75B ). Another microscopic pattern recently described in HIV-infected patients is the inflammatory spindle cell pseudotumor, a lesion much more commonly associated with mycobacterial infection. 236\n\nCandida organisms are yeasts that can produce pseudohyphae and are the most common invasive fungal pathogens in humans. Secondary Candida pneumonia is relatively common, but primary Candida pneumonia is rare in other than immunocompromised patients in the intensive care unit. 55 In general, Candida albicans is the most frequently isolated of the more than 100 known species, which include a few rare and emerging human pathogens. Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis, together with C. albicans, account for 95% of bloodstream infections, the principal route for the acquisition of Candida pneumonia. 237 A non-blood-borne route to pneumonia results from aspiration of organisms from a heavily colonized or infected oropharynx. When the infection is blood-borne, miliary nodules with a necroinflammatory center and a hemorrhagic rim reflect an intravascular distribution of fungi. In the case of aspiration, the organisms may be found in the airways associated with an alveolar filling pattern of bronchopneumonia (Fig. 7.76A) 238 or, much less commonly, a bronchocentric granulomatosis pattern.\n\nIn tissue sections, oval budding yeast-like cells (blastoconidia) 2 to 6 \u00b5m in diameter may appear with pseudohyphae that constrict at points of budding, creating the impression of bulging rather than parallel walls ( Fig. 7.76B ). The pseudohyphae branch at acute angles and can overlap in width with the true hyphae of Aspergillus, from which they must be distinguished. Among the medically important species, Candida glabrata \n\n(formerly Torulopsis glabrata) and Candida parapsilosis produce only yeast cells in tissue, in contrast with most other Candida species, which produce both yeast and pseudohyphae. 203 Other look-alikes include H. capsulatum, Trichosporon beigelii, and Malassezia furfur, depending on whether pseudohyphae or yeast forms alone are present. They can be distinguished from Histoplasma by their extracellular location and Gram stain positivity. T. beigelii tends to be somewhat larger and more pleomorphic. Malassezia is clinically associated with parenteral nutrition, Intralipid, and indwelling catheters. Pulmonary lesions include pneumonia, mycotic thromboemboli, infarcts, and vasculitis. M. furfur may be found in small arteries, where the organisms appear as small 2-to 5-\u00b5m yeast-like cells. They form distinctive unipolar broad-based buds but no pseudohyphae. 55\n\nAspergillus species and other hyaline and dematiaceous molds have emerged as significant causes of morbidity and death in the immunocompromised host. Worldwide, species of Aspergillus are the most common invasive molds. They are the second most common fungal pathogens after Candida species but, in contrast with Candida, are more commonly isolated from the lung. Several species are recognized, but Aspergillus fumigatus is the one most often seen in the clinical laboratory and most often isolated from the lungs of immunocompromised patients. 239 Respiratory aspergillosis can be classified into a colonizing or saprophytic form (intrabronchial and preexisting cavity fungus ball, Fig. 7 .77A); hypersensitivity forms (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, including mucoid impaction of bronchi and hypersensitivity pneumonitis; Fig. 7 .77B); and invasive disease (minimally invasivechronic necrotizing or angioinvasive-disseminated, Box 7.18). 55, [240] [241] [242] [243] Invasive disease (Fig. 7.78 ) tends to occur in immunocompromised patients, including those with prolonged neutropenia, transplant recipients (especially hematopoietic stem cell and lung transplants), advanced AIDS, and the inherited immune deficiency disorder referred to as chronic granulomatous disease of childhood. The clinicopathologic features of invasive disease reflect these host-associated risk factors. 244 In patients with neutropenia, a characteristic angioinvasive pattern occurs, with intravascular spread resulting in hemorrhagic infarcts (Fig.  7.79 ). In the nonneutropenic patient, the necroinflammatory pattern tends to lack this angioinvasive feature. 245 Some cases defy categorization (e.g., bronchocentric and miliary patterns; Fig. 7 .80) or may be hybrids of infection and hypersensitivity. 246 Microscopically, septate hyphae, dichotomously branched at a 45-degree angle, have uniform, consistent width (3 to 6 \u00b5m) without constrictions at points of septation. When numerous, as in some angioinvasive lesions and fungus balls, these features can be readily appreciated in H&E-stained sections. Fruiting heads of Aspergillus (shown earlier in Fig. 7 .65) are sometimes formed in cavities. Oxalate crystals, visible in plane-polarized light (Fig. 7.81) , are an important clue to Aspergillus infection when hyphae cannot be identified.\n\nLook-alikes include various hyaline molds such as Zygomycetes and Candida species as well as Pseudallescheria boydii. 247 Another look-alike is Fusarium species. Fusariosis is an emerging mycosis in the immunocompromised host, and Fusarium is the second most common opportunistic pathogen after Aspergillus species in immunosuppressed patients with hematologic malignancies. 248 The clinical and pathologic features in the lung and at sites of dissemination mimic those of aspergillosis, and the mycelia are essentially indistinguishable. Isolation in culture, immunohistochemistry, or molecular techniques, such as in situ hybridization or PCR amplification, is required for definitive diagnosis. Other previously uncommon but newly emerging hyaline molds that may be difficult to distinguish from Aspergillus in tissue are Paecilomyces, Acremonium, Scedosporium, and Basidiobolus. 237, 249, 250 \n\nThe taxonomic organization of the fungal phylum Zygomycota includes the class Zygomycetes, which is subdivided into two orders: Mucorales and Entomophthorales. These orders contain the agents of human zygomycosis. 251 The order Mucorales includes the genera Absidia, Apophysomyces, Rhizopus, Rhizomucor, and Mucor, from which the often taxonomically incorrect term mucormycosis is derived. In fact, most infections are due to Rhizopus and Absidia species. 252 The zygomycete species share clinical and pathologic features with invasive Aspergillus species, being angiotropic and capable of inducing hemorrhagic infarcts with sparse inflammation.\n\nClinical syndromes produced by these fungi include rhinocerebral, pulmonary, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal infections with a predilection for neonates. 253 Hematopoietic malignancies and diabetes mellitus with acidosis underlie most cases of pulmonary infection in children and adults. 254,255 Box 7.19 lists a broad spectrum of pulmonary diseases that includes solitary or multiple and bilateral nodular lesions, segmental or lobar consolidation, cavitary lesions, fistulas, and infarcts (Figs. 7.82 and 7.83); direct extension into mediastinal, thoracic soft tissue, chest wall, and diaphragm; chronic tracheal and endobronchial infection; and fungus balls similar to those seen with aspergilloma. 256 An endobronchial syndrome with a propensity for blood vessel erosion has also been described, sometimes resulting in fatal hemoptysis. 257 Hyphae are broad (6 to 25 \u00b5m), thin-walled, and pauciseptate ( Fig.  7 .84A). They display variation in width, with twisted, nonparallel contours and random wide-angle branching nearing 90 degrees. 203 They also have a tendency to fragment more commonly than Aspergillus organisms, which tend to retain their elongated sweeping profiles. Additional features include variability in tinctorial staining in H&E sections, ranging from basophilia to eosinophilia. In frozen sections, hyphae may show weak staining, and they often have a bubbly or vacuolated appearance. 256 In addition to being angiotropic, they are neurotropic. 258 In lesions exposed to air, the hyphae may form ovoid or spherical thick-walled chlamydoconidia, within or at the terminal ends ( Fig. 7.84B ). 259 Look-alikes at the lower-width range include Aspergillus and other Aspergillus-like hyaline molds. The pseudohyphae of Candida species can sometimes be similar. especially when lightly pigmented or nonpigmented. Typically only small mycelial fragments are seen, which may be mistaken for artifacts, sometimes with terminal swellings resembling chlamydoconidia (Fig.  7 .85B). The dematiaceous agents of subcutaneous forms of chromoblastomycosis appear as pigmented muriform cells in granulomas, and they do not form mycelia. Chromoblastomycosis is rarely encountered in the lung. Another Aspergillus look-alike is P. boydii, an organism that is sometimes grouped with the dematiaceous fungi. P. boydii usually exhibits a more ragged, disorganized, and densely clustered pattern of mycelia. Clinically, localized disease may be cured by excision alone; systemic disease is often refractory to treatment. 262\n\nA few genera of dematiaceous molds produce infections resembling those of Aspergillus, including allergic bronchopulmonary disease (Fig.  7 .85A) and bronchocentric granulomatosis patterns. 260, 261 The more than 80 genera and species of these saprophytes, which occur naturally in wood, soil, and decaying matter, include Bipolaris, Exserohilum, Xylohypha, Alternaria, and Curvularia, among others. 203 The unique appearance of these fungi is due to their cell wall melanin content. In the allergic mucin or other deposits of necroinflammatory debris, the phaeoid (dark brown-to black-pigmented) hyphae (2 to 6 \u00b5m in diameter) are generally sparse but can resemble Aspergillus and other hyaline molds, \n\nThe face of Pneumocystis pneumonia continues to change. Once considered to be a protozoan, this organism is now classified as a fungus, and the species infecting humans has been renamed Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly Pneumocystis carinii). 263 Once a disease of malnourished or leukemic children, today Pneumocystis infection is identified most commonly in patients with defective immunity, especially AIDS, or those on immunosuppressive therapies for hematopoietic malignancies, organ transplants, and collagen vascular diseases. With the success of contemporary therapy for AIDS, the pathologist is now more likely to encounter the disease in the latter group of patients in whom it is apt to be more subtle. 264 The classic pattern during the HIV epidemic was the foamy alveolar cast (Fig. 7.86 ) with moderate to numerous organisms, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and a scant to moderate interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. 265, 266 In recent years a number of atypical and unusual patterns have been described that are worth recognizing. 55, 267, 268 These are listed in Box 7.20. P. jirovecii infection can mimic any lung injury pattern, ranging from acute diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes (Fig. 7.87 ) and minimal or no foamy exudates to an organizing phase with sparse organisms. There is also a spectrum of granulomatous infection, both nonnecrotizing and necrotizing, that may overlap morphologically with mycobacterial or other fungal infections, particularly histoplasmosis ( Fig. 7.88 ). Cavitary disease, solitary pulmonary nodules that may be relatively fibrotic, cysts, and dystrophic calcification are also described. [268] [269] [270] Microscopically, the three life stages of the organism are still referred to by protozoan terminology as sporozoites, trophozoites, and cysts. The cyst is the most common form seen by pathologists. On silver stains the cyst is seen as an oval (4 to 7 \u00b5m) yeast-like cell that may be collapsed, helmet-shaped, or variably crescentic. The intracystic dot or paired-comma structures are important keys to distinguishing P. jirovecii cysts from look-alikes such as Histoplasma, the capsule-deficient form 7 of Cryptococcus, Candida species, and even overstained red blood cells. Sporozoites and trophozoites are seen to best advantage in touch imprints and cytologic preparations of respiratory samples.\n\nMany of the fungal pathogens involving the respiratory tract can be detected by cytologic techniques in sputum samples, bronchial washings and brushings, BAL fluid samples, and needle aspirates. 46 The aspirates and other samples can also be submitted for culture and ancillary studies. 271 The four most common yeast forms-C. neoformans, C. immitis or C. posadasii, H. capsulatum, and B. dermatitidis-must be distinguished from each other, and P. jirovecii can also enter the differential diagnosis. 45 Morphologic features of these organisms are often better visualized in cytologic preparations than in tissue sections, usually permitting a rapid and definitive diagnosis on smears prepared using routine stains (Papanicolaou, Diff-Quik, and H&E). More specific fungal stains (GMS, Gridley, and Fontana-Masson) can often be held in reserve.\n\nAmorphous granular debris and epithelioid cells characterize many necrotizing granulomas. Typically a background of neutrophils is seen when suppurative granulomas are aspirated. Histoplasma infections may manifest an epithelioid or phagocytic cell population. Cryptococcal infections can be similar or may be associated with little or no accompanying inflammation in the immunocompromised patient.\n\nMorphologic features of some of the more common yeast forms that the pathologist may encounter in cytologic material are presented in Table 7 .7.\n\nC. neoformans organisms are seen as are single budding yeast forms with a narrow, pinched-off base, approximately 4 to 7 \u00b5m in diameter but ranging in size from 2 to 15 \u00b5m. In needle aspirates, the mucoid capsule investing the yeast imparts a \"spare tire\" appearance ( Fig.  7.89) . B. dermatitidis organisms are refractile, double-contoured yeast forms and range in diameter from 8 to 15 \u00b5m with broad-based budding (Fig. 7.90 ). An internal amorphous mass can be appreciated in some stained preparations. Smaller or larger yeast cells can be mistaken for C. neoformans or C. immitis, respectively. C. immitis/C. posadasii spherules exhibit a variety of sizes and shapes, ranging from large spherules packed with endospores ( Fig. 7 .91A) to empty, collapsed spheres and small immature spherules. 272 The latter may overlap with Blastomyces and other yeasts. Mycelial forms of Coccidioides species, with arthrospores, may be found in aspirates of cavitary nodules exposed to air (Fig. 7.91B ). H. capsulatum yeast cells are small (2 to 5 \u00b5m) and stain poorly in routine smears, but the presence of this pathogen can be suspected on the basis of the dot-like refractile appearance of these cells in the cytoplasm of macrophages. In Diff-Quik-stained smears, the characteristic purple, polarized yeast forms (Fig. 7 .92) are discernible, and they are outlined entirely in GMS-stained smears. P. jirovecii is most commonly identified in exfoliative samples and aspirates by the presence of the foamy alveolar cast, which varies from eosinophilic to basophilic and is highly characteristic (Fig.  7 .93A). These organisms rarely occur singly. The GMS stain outlines the characteristic cysts (Fig. 7.93B ).\n\nThe cytopathologist's most frequent challenge is the interpretation of mycelial forms in exfoliated material, especially the distinction between Aspergillus look-alikes-Zygomycetes and Candida hyphae. The morphologic features of some of the more common agents are compared in Table 7 .8.\n\nCandida species are readily seen and easily diagnosed when both yeasts and pseudohyphae are present. However, interpretation of their significance is difficult in all except transthoracic needle aspirates, where the presence of any mycelial structure, particularly in the setting of mass-like and cavitary infiltrates, provides strong morphologic evidence of infection. Aspergillus species are characterized by septate mycelia that branch at angles approaching 45 degrees (Fig. 7.94) . Aspergillus hyphae lack constrictions at points of septation. However, Aspergillus organisms cannot be differentiated from one of their mimics by morphology alone unless accompanied by a fruiting body. A rapid in situ hybridization technique specific for Aspergillus species can be performed on pulmonary cytocentrifuge preparations, as well as on tissue. 273 Zygomycete mycelia are distinguished from Aspergillus and Candida forms by their often broader width and their pleomorphic, twisted ribbon-like, pauciseptate features. Of note, however, in aspirates of aspergilloma, the mycelia may also have a twisted appearance. A potential pitfall in the evaluation of cytopathologic specimens in fungal infections (both exfoliative samples and needle aspirates) is the confounding presence of atypical reactive squamous cells and type II pneumocytes, which can mimic the cytologic atypia of malignant neoplasms. 48 Furthermore, the pathologist interpreting lung biopsy findings, especially with transbronchial specimens, should always attempt to correlate such findings with samples that may have been collected for cytologic or microbiologic study. This is especially advisable because etiologic agents that escape detection in tissue, such as Pneumocystis, Aspergillus, and CMV, may be found in washings or lavage fluid. 274 \n\nComplementary laboratory methods are often required for the diagnosis of fungal infection; these are listed in Box 7.21. 204 Under the microscope, many fungi are readily apparent in H&E-stained sections, where they appear colorless (negative staining) or phaeoid (naturally pigmented). The GMS stain is the best histologic stain for demonstrating fungi when they are sparse or not visible on H&E sections. However, some fungi, notably the Zygomycetes, may stain poorly with GMS. The GMS preparation can be counterstained with H&E, allowing coevaluation of the host inflammatory response. The Fontana-Masson stain has been used to detect melanin in C. neoformans and phaeoid fungi, but many Aspergillus species and some Zygomycetes will also stain with this reagent. 259, 275 The PAS stain can be useful in select circumstances, and histochemical stains for mucin (Alcian blue or mucicarmine) are useful for C. neoformans infections. The PAS and mucin preparations can also be counterstained with GMS or Fontana-Masson to simultaneously highlight cell walls and capsules of cryptococci. It is important to recognize that not everything that stains with the silver methods is a fungus, and care must be taken to distinguish organisms from pseudomicrobes, such as overstained red cells, white blood cell nuclei, reticulin and elastic fibers, calcium deposits, and even Hamazaki-Wesenberg bodies. 42 In the microbiology laboratory, the age-old technique of direct light microscopic visualization of fluids, exudates, and tissue homogenates treated with potassium hydroxide (the KOH wet prep) is being replaced by chemofluorescent cotton-brightening agents (such as calcofluor white and fungiqual). Fluorescence microscopy with these reagents can detect a wide variety of fungi in wet mounts as well as frozen sections and paraffin-embedded tissue. 276, 277 Laboratory techniques for the identification of fungi (gross colonial and microscopic morphologic analysis after isolation on fungal media, followed by biochemical testing) are the principal means to a speciesspecific etiologic diagnosis. For deep tissues, including the lung and other sterile sites, the Emmons modification of Sabouraud glucose agar with chloramphenicol is recommended by many mycologists. 278 Additional use of enriched media such as brain-heart infusion agar can improve recovery of C. neoformans, B. dermatitidis, and H. capsulatum. Selective media containing cycloheximide are not recommended for normally sterile sites because they are potentially inhibitory for yeasts, such as Cryptococcus and Candida species, and molds, such as Aspergillus and the Zygomycetes.\n\nThe interpretation of a positive fungal culture must be made in the clinical context. In the absence of proof of tissue invasion or compelling ancillary data, the interpretation of laboratory results requires considerable judgment. Many fungi are ubiquitous in the environment, and most fungal isolates from nonsterile respiratory samples do not represent disease unless there are also significant risk factors such as HIV infection, organ transplantation, or immunocompromising drug therapy. 279 For most of the dimorphic fungi, in vitro hyphae-to-yeast conversion studies have given way to commercially available nucleic acid probes for rapid specific identification. Procurement of tissue for culture before formalin fixation is important whenever fungal infections are suspected. The tissue sample should be kept moist using sterile, nonbacteriostatic saline or Ringer's solution. Specimens are minced but not ground before plating.\n\nThe value of bringing multiple, often complementary laboratory methods to bear on inconclusive morphologic findings cannot be overemphasized. In this context, while culture has been considered the most reliable method for definitive diagnosis and histopathology often the fastest, the greatest yield results from combining histopathology with traditional culture and one or more of the newer molecular methods. 280, 281 Culture may fail to yield an isolate even in the face of positive microscopic findings. In fact, the yield from tissue specimens, needle aspirates, BAL fluid samples, and bronchial washings is quite low for molds and other fungi for reasons that are not entirely clear. 49, 282 Immunofluorescence testing using specific monoclonal antibodies can achieve a rapid and specific diagnosis in selected infections, especially when tissue has not been submitted for culture. Antibodies directed against the antigens of Aspergillus species and selected other fungi have been described, but most are not yet commercially available. For the problematic case, the mycology section of the CDC can provide assistance. Immunohistochemical identification of fungi can be accomplished fairly easily for those species for which reagents are commercially available. 33, 283, 284 Molecular techniques, including in situ hybridization and amplification technologies such as PCR, are other powerful tools that can provide rapid, accurate diagnosis for yeasts and molds that may be present in small numbers or manifest overlapping histologic features. 277, [285] [286] [287] A few laboratories (including the CDC) are performing such assays. Use of quantitative real-time PCR assays on blood, body fluids, and other samples holds promise for relatively rapid definitive diagnosis when routine methods of isolation and identification fail in critical situations. 288, 289 Serologic tests can support a morphologic diagnosis when positive titers are present, but effective serodiagnosis of systemic fungal infections is not available for most fungi. 290 Unfortunately an antibody response does not necessarily correlate with invasive disease, and an antibody response may be lacking for various reasons. False-positive results due to cross reactions and false-negative results due to a variety of reasons plague many of these assays. Some of the most accurate serologic tests (with high sensitivity and specificity) for fungal infections are those for histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis, yet tests for both have limitations that must be recognized in interpreting results. 291, 292 The detection of macromolecular antigens shed into various body fluids requires a relatively large microbial burden, which tends to limit sensitivity for most fungal infections except histoplasmosis and crytococcosis. 280 For these two fungi, useful antigen detection techniques are available using serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and BAL fluid. They are especially sensitive in patients with defective immunity. 271, 292 In patients with pneumonia and normal immunity, however, these tests may be positive in lavage fluid but negative in urine unless the disease has disseminated. Other assays designed to detect antigens or metabolites of invasive fungi include those for 1,3\u03b2-d-glucan, a cell wall component of several fungi such as Aspergillus, Candida, Fusarium, and others, and for galactomannan, a polysaccharide antigen in the cell wall of Aspergillus; these assays have shown fair sensitivity and specificity. 203, 293, 294 Differential Diagnosis A synopsis of the key morphologic and mycologic features of the fungal pneumonias is presented in Table 7 .9. 295 When H&E and GMS stains fail to detect fungal elements, the use of ancillary procedures may provide the specific diagnosis. Sometimes, if tissue or other patient specimens have been submitted for culture, the answer may lie in the mycology section of the microbiology laboratory, as many species begin to grow in a matter of days. When fungi are not readily identified by any of these techniques or strategies, other granulomatous infections should be considered, especially mycobacterial, uncommon bacterial (e.g., tularemia, brucellosis), and parasitic infections. Noninfectious necrotizing and nonnecrotizing granulomatous disorders also enter the differential diagnosis. These include granulomatosis with polyangiitis, idiopathic bronchocentric granulomatosis, aspiration, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid nodules, pyoderma gangrenosum-like lung lesions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and Churg-Strauss syndrome. 224 Budding yeasts and pseudohyphae in wet mounts, KOH-and calcofluor-stained smears; cultures on selective and nonselective fungal media yield creamy tan to white yeast-type colonies; identification by germ tube production, carbohydrate assimilation, and cornmeal agar morphology\n\nSurgical pathology Various forms include saprophytic (fungus ball), allergic (ABPA and mucoid impaction), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and invasive disease ranging in severity from minimal chronic necrotizing to extensive pneumonia; angiotrophic with necrotizing infarcts; also hybrid forms of disease; septate, dichotomous, 45-degree angle mycelia; oxalate crystals; presence of fruiting body is genus-specific Cytopathology Tangled clusters of septate mycelia in a necroinflammatory background; may appear sparsely septate and twisted, mimicking Zygomycetes\n\nPositive staining of mycelia with calcofluor and GMS; culture of sterile lung tissue on nonselective fungal media produces mold-type colonies in a range of colors; species differentiation by conidial and conidiophore morphology\n\nSurgical pathology Nodular lesions, lobar consolidations, cavitary lesions, fungus balls, and airway infections commonly necrotizing and ischemic secondary to angioinvasion; broad pauciseptate mycelia with 90-degree angle, branching, often with twisted-ribbon morphology Cytopathology Pauciseptate mycelia, often with twisted-ribbon morphology in a necroinflammatory background\n\nPositive staining of mycelia with calcofluor and GMS; rapidly growing cottony colonies are grown on most nonselective fungal media, but \"controlled baiting\" with bread sometimes necessary; identification based on presence and locations of rhizoids, shape of sporangia, presence of columellae, and shape of sporangiospores\n\nSurgical pathology Allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease similar to aspergillosis Cytopathology Similar to ABPA pattern-\"allergic mucin\" with eosinophils, Charcot-Leiden crystals in inspissated mucus; fungal mycelial fragments sparse or absent Microbiology Dematiaceous (phaeoid) dark brown to black colonies on nonselective fungal media; identified by shape and cross walls of multicell, pigmented conidia suggests that more viruses will be linked to respiratory tract disease in the future.\n\nThe respiratory tract viruses have a tendency to target specific regions of the tracheobronchial tree and lungs, producing characteristic clinical syndromes. However, sufficient overlap clinically, radiologically, and pathologically often limits a strict interpretation of findings for a definitive diagnosis. The information in Box 7.22 can sometimes be useful in narrowing the search for a specific etiologic agent. The microscopic findings in most pulmonary viral infections include the direct effect of the virus as well as the host's inflammatory response. The clinical outcome depends upon the virulence of the organism and the nature of the host response, be it diffuse alveolar damage, diffuse or patchy bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonitis, giant cell reactions, or even minimal change. 309 The histopathologic diagnosis of viral infection is impossible without identification of the characteristic CPE. The term cytopathic effect has traditionally been used by virologists to describe cellular changes in unstained cell culture monolayers seen by light microscopy, 310,311 but it can be applied to all virus-associated nuclear and cytoplasmic alterations seen on H&E-stained slides or highlighted by immunohistochemical staining, molecular in situ-based methodology, or ultrastructural localization. 312, 313 Diffuse alveolar damage, often with bronchiolitis, is the most typical pattern of viral lung injury. As noted earlier, however, diffuse alveolar damage also occurs in bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal pneumonias, so a careful search for specific viral CPE becomes important in this setting. For the surgical pathologist, CPE manifests mainly as the viral inclusion present in the nucleus or cytoplasm of an infected cell. Viral inclusions confer diagnostic specificity to the pathologic pattern of injury in which they are found, and for the common respiratory tract viruses, the features are presented in Table  7 .11. Finally, it is worth mentioning that most clinically significant viral pneumonias that have CPE also show necrosis somewhere in the biopsy.\n\nInfluenza viruses are the most pathogenic of the respiratory viruses and predispose patients most commonly to secondary bacterial pneumonia. These viruses also account for the greatest public health burden. Annually they cause epidemic outbreaks of respiratory disease that are often associated with considerable morbidity; periodically, they produce pandemics with high mortality rates. These viruses target the ciliated epithelium of the tracheobronchial tree, producing necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis and a spectrum of changes that vary depending on the stage of the disease (early vs. late), outcome (fatal vs. nonfatal), and the presence or absence of secondary bacterial pneumonia. Uncomplicated influenza pneumonia is rarely biopsied today. Based on historical data from bronchoscopic biopsies performed in the 1950s and early 1960s, the histopathologic findings in nonfatal uncomplicated influenza\n\nViruses cause more infections than all other types of microorganisms combined and involve the respiratory tract more commonly than other organ systems. 296 Fortunately, the lung diseases produced by viruses are usually mild and self-limited. Nevertheless, viruses cause major public health illnesses and account for many of the new and emerging diseases in current headlines. At times viruses are also capable of producing serious and life-threatening infections that come to the attention of pathologists in both immunocompromised patients and young, healthy persons. 297 The viruses that commonly infect the lung are listed in Table  7 .10. 298\n\nThe conventional respiratory viruses-influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, RSV, and adenovirus-cause outbreaks of respiratory illness in the general population each year. In infants, the elderly, and in patients with chronic diseases, these pathogens can cause serious pneumonias. Pneumonia in immunocompromised persons is usually attributed to the herpesviruses (HSV and CMV). Less appreciated is that the conventional respiratory viruses are also frequent causes of respiratory illness in these patients and that such infections result in high rates of morbidity and mortality. 299 Newly recognized respiratory viruses 300,301 include H5N1, a highly pathogenic strain of influenza. First detected in 1997 in Hong Kong, it has since spread to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Another unique, triple-reassortment swine-origin influenza virus A, H1N1 (S-OIV), emerged in 2009 as the cause of outbreaks sustained by person-to-person transmission in multiple countries. It was characterized by respiratory illness of variable severity ranging from self-limited disease resembling seasonal flu to severe illness requiring hospitalization and occasionally eventuating in death from respiratory failure. 302 An acute cardiopulmonary syndrome in the southwestern United States was etiologically linked to a new hantavirus referred to as Sin Nombre (\"without a name\"). The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which began in southern China and was carried by travelers to 33 other countries and 5 continents, was caused by SARS-CoV, a newly recognized coronavirus. Four other coronaviruses linked to respiratory illnesses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1) have since been reported. 303 Human metapneumovirus, a paramyxovirus closely related to RSV clinically and pathologically, has become recognized as one of the leading causes of respiratory illness in children and can also cause illness in adults and immunocompromised patients. 304 Human bocavirus (HBoV) has been isolated in several countries from children with wheezing. 305 Other viruses such as the picornavirus group (rhinovirus and enterovirus) can cause pneumonia, as can polyomavirus (BK virus). 306 Parvovirus B19, an Erythrovirus, has long been known to cause disease, primarily in maternal-fetal and pediatric patients.\n\nRecently an autoimmune-type pneumonitis associated with serologic evidence of parvovirus B19 has also been described. 308 The evolution of diagnostic laboratory methods and large-scale molecular screening 1918, 1957, and 1968 and in fatal cases of interpandemic (seasonal) influenza. 317 A characteristic feature of the H5N1 and 1918 cases is the high mortality rate, especially among previously healthy older children and young adults. Excessively high levels of cytokines and chemokines are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the acute lung injury pattern seen in these fatal cases of influenza. 320 Because these viruses produce no characteristic cellular inclusions, etiologic diagnosis is not possible by morphology alone and requires antigen detection by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, or culture. 321 The influenza virus genome steadily shifts over the passage of time; infections occur in those without previous immunity to each new strain. Rapid characterization of each viral variant is a continuous challenge, with numerous virologic methods concentrating on rapid point-of-care methods needed for effective prophylaxis. 322\n\nParainfluenza virus comprises four serotypes (I to IV) that typically target the upper respiratory tract, classically in the form of croup. 323 Some cases involve distal airways, as in infections due to RSV and are those of active tracheobronchitis. 314 Necrosis and desquamation of the epithelial cells to the basement membrane is associated with a relatively scant lymphocytic infiltrate; however, in more severe cases, the virus and its attendant inflammatory response spread more distally into the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli, with hemorrhage, edema, fibrinous exudate with hyaline membranes, and patchy interstitial cellular infiltrates (Fig. 7.95 ). This constellation of findings comprises the lesion of characterization. 315 In contemporary pathologic terms this would correspond to diffuse alveolar damage and, clinically, a primary viral pneumonia. Depending on the clinical course and time of lung biopsy (or autopsy) within the first 2 weeks of illness, the process may be in the acute and/or organizing phase. 316, 317 Later, the airway epithelial damage may pave the way for secondary bacterial pneumonia, which accounts for much of the morbidity and mortality of influenza and may obscure the features of primary viral pneumonia. 318 From 2003 through 2008, 391 human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza involving the H5N1 strain were recorded with 247 deaths. 319 The histopathologic changes observed in the few autopsied cases fall within the spectrum of findings described during the pandemics occurring during the winter and early spring months. 304, 332 The virus also causes disease in immunocompromised patients 333 and likely explains some lower respiratory tract infections in the elderly. The clinical spectrum of croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia is similar to that for infections due to other paramyxoviruses, such as RSV and parainfluenza virus. The pathologic features are not well characterized because few well-documented cases have included biopsy in the evaluation. However, histopathologic assessment of lung tissue in severe cases has revealed acute and organizing diffuse alveolar damage as well as smudge cell formation. 334, 335 The definitive identification of the virus can be established in tissue culture, but monoclonal antibody reagents and molecular techniques (real-time PCR assay) are the current diagnostic methods of choice.\n\nThe measles virus causes a highly communicable childhood viral exanthem worldwide that, unlike varicella (chickenpox), leads to complications that are common and serious. 336 Measles pneumonia accounts for the vast majority of measles-related deaths, and most of these are a consequence of secondary pneumonia (bacterial or viral) or attributable to an aberrant immune response. Despite vaccination, measles is still a global pathogen and has resurfaced due to variation in vaccination rates, even in the United States. 337, 338 Primary viral pneumonia occurs but is uncommon, even in immunocompromised hosts. Microscopically, bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial degeneration and reactive hyperplasia with squamous metaplasia is typically accompanied by peribronchial inflammation. Diffuse alveolar damage may occur, and quantitative immunohistochemical studies have revealed severe immune dysfunction with loss of key effector cells and their cytokines. 339 Characteristic giant cells show distinctive intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions surrounded by halos (Fig. 7.97 ). This is the classic measles injury pattern 307 and is referred to as Hecht giant cell pneumonia. Minute intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions precede the development of the intranuclear inclusions and are often difficult to identify. Pneumonia with giant cells should always suggest measles, influenza virus, but are milder, with less morbidity and requiring fewer hospitalizations. A few documented cases have been described with a diffuse alveolar damage pattern or an interstitial pneumonitis with giant cells, the latter resembling those of measles and RSV infection. The giant cells of parainfluenza tend to be larger and have more intracytoplasmic inclusions. 55 Parainfluenza virus is a potential opportunist in immunocompromised patients, especially children with congenital immunodeficiency disorders, 324 in whom fatal pneumonitis with disseminated disease may occur. 325 Respiratory Syncytial Virus RSV causes more significant respiratory infections in early childhood than those attributable to either influenza viruses or parainfluenza viruses. 326, 327 The annual outbreaks of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants are especially severe during the first year of life and in those of low birth weight or with cardiopulmonary disease. 323 Considered primarily a childhood virus, RSV has more recently been recognized as the etiologic agent of pneumonia in community-dwelling and high-risk adults with chronic lung disease requiring hospitalization. 324, 328, 329 Also, RSV is often an unsuspected opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients. 299, 330 RSV targets the epithelium of the distal airway, producing bronchiolitis with disorganization of the epithelium and epithelial cell sloughing (Fig. 7.96A ). 307 In fatal cases, airway obstruction due to sloughed cell detritus, mucus, and fibrin is compounded by airway lymphoid hyperplasia. 331 Diffuse alveolar damage may be seen in immunocompromised patients. Giant cells (syncytia), similar to the cytopathic changes seen in cell culture, may be present in alveolar ducts and airspaces around areas of bronchiolitis (Fig. 7.96B) . Eosinophilic inclusions in cytoplasm may be seen in tissues and cytology specimens from immunosuppressed patients, but these are difficult to confirm as diagnostic of RSV without immunohistochemistry.\n\nHuman metapneumovirus, a newly recognized paramyxovirus, is a leading cause of respiratory tract disease in infants, with annual epidemics came to public attention as an emerging infection following an outbreak in the southwestern United States in 1993; it was causally linked to a previously unrecognized hantavirus. All members of this genus are zoonotic and are found in rodents around the world. The specific type responsible for the cardiopulmonary syndrome, Sin Nombre, is present in rodent feces and is acquired from the environment through inhalation. It produces florid pulmonary edema with pleural effusions, variable fibrin deposits, and focal wispy hyaline membranes (Fig. 7.98A ). 340 Immunoblast-like cells are present in vascular spaces and in the peripheral blood ( Fig. 7.98B ). Morphologic diagnosis is presumptive because hantaviral antigen in endothelial cells, detected by immunohistochemistry, is required for definitive diagnosis. 341 In the appropriate clinical setting, clues to the diagnosis can sometimes be found in a constellation of morphologic findings on a peripheral blood smear, and confirmation can be achieved serologically by the detection of hantavirus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies or by the detection of hantavirus RNA by PCR assay in peripheral blood leukocytes. [342] [343] [344] Coronaviruses Coronaviruses are ubiquitous RNA viruses known to cause disease in many animals. At least five different coronaviruses are known to infect humans, and these cluster into two antigenic groups. 303 They, along with the rhinoviruses, are responsible for a majority of common colds. Coinfections with other respiratory viruses occur in infants and children presenting with more severe respiratory disease. In certain epidemiologic situations, they can cause pneumonia in children, frail elderly individuals, and immunocompromised adults. 345, 346 In November 2002, the appearance of an atypical pneumonia in China, subsequently labeled SARS, became an alarming global health problem in the period of a few months. 347 The disease was linked (Koch's postulates were fulfilled) by means of tissue culture isolation, electron microscopy, and molecular analysis to an emergent novel coronavirus, proposed as the Urbani strain of SARS-associated coronavirus. 348 Clinically the disease ranges from a nonhypoxemic febrile respiratory disease (with minimal symptoms in some patients) to one of severe pulmonary dysfunction, manifesting as ARDS and eventuating in death for approximately 5% of the patients affected. 349 In the reported cases, the chest x-ray appearance on presentation was either normal or the chest film showed unilateral, predominantly peripheral areas of but similar changes can be seen in RSV and parainfluenza pneumonias, and not all cases of measles pneumonia have these giant cells. 307 Hard metal pneumoconiosis (giant cell interstitial pneumonia) is in the differential diagnosis, but the overall appearance of hard metal disease is one of a chronic disease with some fibrosis and few if any acute changes. In the absence of giant cells, the cellular interstitial pneumonia must be differentiated from those caused by other viruses and atypical pneumonia agents as well as from nonspecific interstitial pneumonia.\n\nThe recently identified hantavirus produces a rapidly evolving cardiopulmonary syndrome with a high mortality rate. This disorder first pneumonitis with \"dirty\" or karyorrhectic necrosis 356 (Fig. 7.101) . These patterns may coexist in some cases, and the pneumonia may be accompanied by hemorrhage secondary to adenovirus-induced endothelial cell damage. 357 Two types of adenoviral CPE may be seen. Initially an eosinophilic (Cowdry A) intranuclear inclusion occurs surrounded by a halo with marginated chromatin, similar to HSV (Fig. 7.102A ). This later enlarges and becomes amphophilic and then more basophilic, obliterating the nuclear membrane and producing the characteristic smudge cell (Fig. 7.102B ). 307\n\nHSVs types I and II have had traditional assigned roles as etiologic agents of mucocutaneous disease of the head and neck (type I) and\n\nconsolidation that progressed to bilateral, patchy consolidation, the degree and extent of which correlated with the development of respiratory failure. In patients who presented with a normal x-ray appearance, CT scans often revealed bilateral ground-glass consolidation resembling that in bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (cryptogenic organizing pneumonia). Lymphopenia and elevated LDH were helpful clues, but the clinical, radiologic, and laboratory features, although characteristic, were not distinguishable from those in patients with pneumonia caused by other viruses and bacteria and various atypical agents.\n\nHistopathologic findings in lung biopsy and autopsy tissues included acute lung injury (diffuse alveolar damage) in various stages of organization. 350, 351 Lung biopsy specimens in milder cases showed relatively scant intraalveolar fibrin deposits with some congestion and edema (Fig.  7.99) . However, the spectrum of findings included acute fibrinous pneumonia, hyaline membrane formation, interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates, desquamation of alveolar pneumocytes, and areas undergoing organization of the acute-phase injury. 352 In some patients, multinucleate syncytial cells reminiscent of the CPE seen in influenza virus, RSV, and measles virus infections were noted. Viral inclusions were not identified, and initial immunohistochemical studies failed to reveal viral antigen. Subsequent investigations detected virus in epithelial cells (predominantly type II pneumocytes) and alveolar macrophages using immunohistochemical staining, in situ hybridization, RT-PCR methods, and electron microscopy. A unique coronavirus (Fig. 7.100 ) was finally implicated as the etiologic agent. 352, 353 Comparative histopathologic studies in fatal cases of SARS and H5N1 avian influenza reveal similarities and differences. 354 Both infections feature acute and organizing diffuse alveolar damage, but SARS appears to be more frequently associated with subacute injury with intraalveolar organization, whereas H5N1 virus causes a more fulminant diffuse alveolar damage pattern with patchy interstitial inflammation and paucicellular fibrosis.\n\nAdenovirus comprises several genera, with multiple serotypes that cause infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, conjunctiva, and gut. Respiratory tract infections are most common and account for approximately 5% to 10% of pediatric pneumonias. These can be especially severe in neonates, children, and immunocompromised persons. 307, 355 In the lung, adenovirus infection produces two patterns of lung injury: diffuse alveolar damage with or without necrotizing bronchiolitis and genitalia (type II). Considerable crossover has been documented, however, with both types isolated from patients with disease at either site. Tracheobronchitis and pneumonia due to these viruses are rare in healthy adults with intact immune systems. They occur primarily in patients with underlying pulmonary disease and in association with inhalational and intubational trauma. They also occur in neonates and in patients who are immunosuppressed or compromised by various chronic diseases. Characteristic lesions include tracheobronchitis (Fig. 7.103A ) with ulcers and hemorrhagic diffuse alveolar damage. Necrosis in a miliary small (or rarely large) nodular pattern is a helpful clue and the best location to identify CPE (Fig. 7.103B ). 73 Like adenovirus, HSV also has two types of CPE: Initially a ground-glass amphophilic intranuclear inclusion, Cowdry B, appears with marginated chromatin; later a single eosinophilic Cowdry A inclusion (Fig. 7.104 ) surrounded by a halo, similar to that seen with adenovirus, develops. The Cowdry A inclusion is considered noninfectious, as it is devoid of nucleic acid protein and is thought to represent the nuclear \"scar\" of HSV infection. 307 In the absence of smudge cells, HSV and adenoviral infections can look identical. Fortunately, immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization can often resolve this differential diagnosis.\n\nintranuclear inclusions are present but may be sparse and difficult to identify. A miliary pattern of calcified nodules (Fig. 7 .105B) may be present in the healed phase. 358 Cytomegalovirus CMV infections are acquired throughout life. This virus can cause considerable morbidity and even death in the neonate, but infection is generally asymptomatic in older healthy children and adults. As in the case of other herpesviruses, primary infection is followed by latency, which persists until immune deficiency or immunosuppressive therapy causes it to reactivate and disseminate. CMV has therefore become one of the most common opportunists in patients with AIDS and those who receive organ transplants. In these settings, CMV can produce a variety of patterns, including one with minimal changes where only scattered alveolar lining cells with typical viropathic changes are seen. The CPE of CMV produces cytomegalic cells with large, round to oval, smooth \"owl eye\" eosinophilic to basophilic intranuclear inclusions surrounded by a clear halo (Fig. 7.106A) .\n\nLater, multiple eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions develop that may be positive on staining with PAS and GMS ( Fig. 7.106A, inset) . The more numerous the cytomegalic cells, the greater the clinical significance. In some cases, atypical inclusions may be seen in cells that are not significantly enlarged, and the nuclei may contain dark-staining homogeneous inclusions that may lack a clear halo. Despite their atypical appearance, these inclusions will usually be highlighted with immunohistochemical stains. 359 Another typical pattern that suggests viral infection is the presence of small miliary nodules with a central hemorrhage surrounded by necrotic alveolar walls (Fig. 7.106B ). 73 Interstitial pneumonitis is the least common pattern of CMV infection. Ulcers may be seen in the trachea and bronchi, but they occur less often than in herpetic infections. In CMV pneumonias, it is advisable to look for other pathogens, typically P. jirovecii (Fig. 7.107 ); but bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and other viruses are all possible coinfecting organisms. 360\n\nEBV infections are usually acquired in childhood and are generally asymptomatic. The pathologist most often encounters this virus in the lung in the context of pulmonary lymphomas or in other EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders that can occur in transplant recipients and other immunocompromised patients. However, the most common\n\nVaricella-zoster virus (VZV) infection produces considerable morbidity in the newborn, the adult, and the immunocompromised host, both in its primary form (varicella) and in its reactivated form (zoster). Varicella pneumonia is rarely observed in otherwise healthy children but is a major complication of adult varicella, occurring in approximately 10% to 15% of adults with VZV. In affected adults without underlying diseases and normal immunity, the course is generally mild and self-limited. Nevertheless, fatality rates of up to 10% have been reported. 307 By contrast, high mortality rates (25% to 45%) have been noted among some cohorts of immunosuppressed patients. Microscopically, small miliary nodules of necrosis are seen, associated with interstitial pneumonitis, edema, fibrin deposits, or patchy hyaline membranes (Fig. 7.105A ). HSV-like symptomatic primary EBV infection is infectious mononucleosis. Most of these patients recover uneventfully, but a few develop one or more complications. Pneumonitis is one of them, albeit rare and not well characterized. The few reports describing pathology indicate a nonspecific lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, which may be bronchiolocentric (Fig. 7.108) . 361, 362 CPE is absent, and although serologic studies can be supportive of a clinicopathologic diagnosis, etiologic proof of EBV infection requires the demonstration of the virus in lymphoid cells by in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA-1 (EBER-1).\n\nThe cytologic features of viral infections in the respiratory tract are most likely to be found in exfoliative specimens, such as bronchial washings and BAL fluid samples, rather than needle aspirates, although viral diagnosis has been achieved with this technique. 363, 364 This is because viral infections are less likely to produce radiologic mass-like infiltrates, which are the most common targets of needle biopsy procedures. Herpes simplex virus, CMV (Fig. 7.109) , and adenovirus are the most commonly identified viral pathogens in respiratory cytologic specimens, but varicella virus, parainfluenza virus, RSV, human metapneumovirus, and measles virus have also been detected.\n\nCharacteristic CPE produced by these viruses is often better appreciated in cytologic smears than in tissue sections, which may, in fact, yield a negative result. Therefore review of any cytology sample taken at the time of biopsy can be valuable. Other, less specific changes may be found. These include ciliocytophoria (free cilia complexes with terminal bars) and cytologic atypia mimicking cancer. 46 \n\nDiagnostic virology is the newest of the microbiology and infectious disease specialties to have benefited from the technologic revolution in laboratory medicine. Rapid and accurate diagnosis can often be achieved today using practical, convenient laboratory methods that employ reliable, commercially available mammalian cells, media, and reagent systems. 297, 365, 366 This has allowed many rural and small urban hospital laboratories to provide timely viral diagnostic services not possible a short time ago. It is predicted that self-contained, rapid-cycle real-time PCR methods will one day account for the majority of viral assays in laboratories of all sizes. As a result, the pathologist who suspects a viral infection will increasingly have a variety of tools to obtain an etiologic diagnosis when morphologic manifestations are suggestive of viral infection.\n\nThe basic approaches to viral diagnosis in the laboratory are listed in Box 7.23. In questionable cases, confirmation by immunohistochemical studies (Fig. 7.110A ), in situ hybridization (Fig. 7.110B ), or electron microscopy may be helpful. 32, 367 Many of the traditional methods of viral detection, detailed later, are being augmented by respiratory panel assays based on the detection of nucleic acid and compiled around common respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens. 368, 369 The diagnosis of viral respiratory infections can also be based on antigen detection and culture (Fig. 7.111 ). Direct antigen detection in clinical specimens collected by nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal washings, and aspirates or BAL fluid (but not sputum samples or, with rare exception, throat swabs) is performed using monoclonal antibodies by either immunofluorescence microscopy or enzyme immunoassay. By using a single reagent containing the monoclonal antibodies against several viruses and dual fluorochromes, the common respiratory viruses can be rapidly screened by direct immunofluorescence testing. Positive specimens can then be tested with individual reagents to determine the specific etiologic agent, while negative specimens can be submitted for culture. 370 Enzyme immunoassay includes methods that offer speed and convenience at the point of care. However, they are less sensitive than standard virologic methods, which must still be used to test negative specimens. Direct detection can also be accomplished in cellular samples, including tissue, by in situ hybridization or amplification techniques such as PCR. For RNA viruses, PCR amplification uses a reverse transcriptase (RT) step. PCR methodology has recently evolved into multiplex formats, and novel systems have been introduced that combine multiplex PCR chemistry with electron microarray (DNA chip) technology or fluid microsphere-based systems, permitting the simultaneous detection of a wide array of respiratory viruses and other pathogens. [371] [372] [373] [374] [375] [376] These systems have the potential to more rapidly and accurately diagnose acute infections and may also allow the study of complex coinfections and the active monitoring of outbreaks of influenza and other viral illnesses. 377 Panels composed of common respiratory bacterial and viral pathogens are available; these are based on nucleic acid detection by nested PCR and come by several brand names. Such panels typically encompass many of the respiratory viruses detailed previously with specimens obtained through sampling with a nasopharyngeal swab. 378, 379 Traditional viral cultures in tubes with various types of cell monolayers are currently performed with greater sensitivity and turnaround time using the shell vial technique. This technique uses centrifugation of clinical specimen suspensions onto coverslipped cell monolayers followed by brief incubation (1 to 2 days) and antigen detection. 365 It is important, therefore, to preserve a portion of tissue from a bronchial or transbronchial biopsy or thoracotomy specimen in viral transport medium, especially with an immunocompromised patient, who may not have had BAL fluid submitted for culture. Shell vials, although faster than the traditional tube culture method, are still a slow method based on viral growth and are being replaced by direct nucleic acid detection.\n\nViral serologic testing has commonly been used for diagnosis but may be the least sensitive approach. A positive serodiagnosis is typically based on a fourfold rise in titer between acute and convalescent sera and therefore cannot be achieved by this means in the acutely ill patient; antigen detection or culture of respiratory tract specimens is much preferred. However, a serologic strategy, utilizing a panel of antigens in an immunofluorescence or enzyme immunoassay format on a single specimen, is useful in suspected EBV infections. 380 A case also can be made for the benefit of CMV serologic testing for assessing the antibody status of organ donors and recipients for \n\nSeveral parasite species migrate through the lungs as part of their normal life cycle, but few preferentially infect the human lung. 390 Most are aberrant pulmonary localizations in the human host, where they become lost in transit or are part of a secondary disseminated infection from another organ system, often in the setting of compromised immunity. The listing of etiologic agents in Box 7.24 is selective, based on the more common pathogens known to be associated with pulmonary involvement.\n\nWhen parasites in the form of adult worms, larvae, or eggs invade or become deposited in lung tissue, they usually provoke an intense inflammatory reaction with neutrophils, eosinophils, and various mononuclear cells. One or more of the patterns listed in Box 7.25 may be identified. When the predominant site of involvement is the bronchial mucosa, a bronchitis and bronchiolitis pattern is observed; when they become impacted in pulmonary arteries, a nodular angiocentric pattern is observed, although it may be overshadowed by thrombosis and infarction. Some parasites invade the alveolar parenchyma, resulting in a pattern of miliary small nodules or pneumonitis. Naturally none of these patterns are consistently present and combinations of patterns may be seen. In some cases, an acute Loeffler-like eosinophilic pneumonia may reflect an allergic reaction to the transient passage of larvae through the pulmonary vasculature.\n\nThe various patterns, although nondiagnostic, can be suggestive of a parasitic infection, particularly when they incorporate a heavy eosinophilic infiltrate or granulomatous component. Eosinophilic lung disease, with or without blood eosinophilia, has a diverse etiology but is particularly characteristic of parasitic infection, especially in the tropics. 385 In the United States, other infections, such as coccidioidomycosis, must be considered, in addition to the many noninfectious causes of pulmonary eosinophilia. The challenge for the pathologist is the identification of a parasite, distinguishing it from artifact or foreign body, and classifying it as precisely as possible based on its size and unique morphologic features. Once the presence of suggestive morphologic features has been confirmed, the patient's travel or avocation history can help to further narrow the scope of the differential diagnosis.\n\npredicting the risk of posttransplantation CMV disease. When tissue is not available or findings are inconclusive, tests for the detection of actual disease in these transplant recipients include the p65 antigenemia assay on peripheral blood leukocytes and amplification or quantitation of CMV DNA in various peripheral blood compartments (plasma, whole blood, and leukocytes). 381 These assays may eventually replace culture of BAL fluid for surveillance of CMV infection in such patients. 382 The detection of virus in respiratory secretions (including BAL fluid), urine, or blood establishes the presence of virus but does not necessarily implicate it as the etiologic agent of a pneumonia. Quantitation of viral load by real-time PCR amplification, however, can be useful in this regard by linking high viral load with infection. 383 \n\nA synopsis of the key morphologic and microbiologic features of the viral pneumonias is presented in Table 7 .12. In the absence of CPE, diffuse alveolar damage and other patterns of lung injury are not diagnostic of viral infection. Diffuse alveolar damage is a nonspecific response to many types of infection, including bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, and protozoal, all of which must be considered in the differential diagnosis. In addition, other noninfectious causes include reactions to drugs, radiation, toxic inhalants, and shock of any type. Occasionally, CPE may not be diagnostic; for example, the early inclusions of adenovirus, HSV, and CMV may be quite similar. In most cases, immunohistochemistry or molecular techniques can resolve the diagnostic dilemma. Mimics of CPE that must be ruled out include macronuclei in both reactive processes and occult neoplastic infiltrates and intranuclear cytoplasmic invaginations, which can occur in a variety of cells. Cytoplasmic viral inclusions can also be simulated by aggregated altered protein and particulate matter.\n\nApproximately 300 species of helminth worms and 70 species of protozoa have been acquired by humans during our short history on Earth. 384 Most of these are rare, but approximately 90 are relatively common and some have been found in the lung. [385] [386] [387] [388] [389] With travel to endemic areas and emergence (or reemergence) of parasitic pathogens in immunocompromised patients, pathologists will see these organisms 36 Of interest, a common \"parasite\" encountered in clinical practice is not a parasite at all but aspirated vegetable material simulating the complex structure of an organism. 391\n\nT. gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan and a common opportunist in patients with AIDS, the disease underlying most cases of toxoplasmosis seen in recent years. The brain and retina are most commonly involved in these patients, but pulmonary lesions may also be present in cases of disseminated disease. These often take the form of miliary small nodules with fibrinous exudates, which may progress to a confluent fibrinopurulent pneumonia. 392 and cysts may be identified (Fig. 7.112 ). Pseudocysts packed with tachyzoites can be distinguished from true cysts with bradyzoites by staining of the latter with PAS and GMS. 393 Serology is the main method of diagnosis in the acute phase, and serology with concomitant radiologic findings in appropriate settings in immunocompromised hosts usually obviates the need for direct demonstration of the organisms. Either PCR on the specimen or immunohistochemistry can be used to demonstrate the organisms. 394\n\nAmebic dysentery becomes invasive in a small percentage of patients. When the trophozoites leave the gut, they most commonly travel to the liver. From the liver, either by direct extension or rarely by hematogenous spread, the lungs may become involved. In this scenario, abscesses composed of liquefactive debris-with few neutrophils, distinguishable from bacterial abscess where neutrophils are dominant-may be seen, most often in the right lower lobe adjacent to the liver. 395, 396 Trophozoites can be best seen at the margin of viable tissue (Fig. 7.113 ). They resemble histiocytes but are usually larger, with a lower nucleocytoplasmic ratio. A tiny central karyosome within a round nucleus having vesicular chromatin is characteristic. 397, 398 Bronchial fistula formation and empyema can occur as complications; amebas may be found in sputum and pleural fluid, respectively, in these situations. For free-living amebic species (those of the genera Acanthamoeba, Balamuthia, Naegleria), the central nervous system is the principal focus of infection. However disseminated disease including lung infection (Fig. 7 .114) may occur in certain epidemiologic situations, especially those involving compromised immune status, or in lung transplants. [399] [400] [401] Cryptosporidiosis Ten species of the intracellular coccidian protozoa are currently recognized, but one of them, Cryptosporidium parvum, causes most human infections. 402 Clinically, infection due to this organism may have three major manifestations: asymptomatic shedding, acute watery diarrhea that lasts for approximately 2 weeks, and persistent diarrhea that lasts several weeks. Patients with AIDS have a wider spectrum of disease severity and duration that includes a fulminant cholera-like illness. 402 These patients are most likely to manifest extraintestinal disease. In the lung, the organism targets the epithelium of the airways, just as it does the surface epithelium of the gut and biliary tract. 403 In H&E sections, cryptosporidia appear as small (4 to 6 \u00b5m in diameter) round to oval protrusions from the cell surface. Electron microscopy reveals that they are intracellular but extracytoplasmic. In addition to H&E, they stain with Giemsa, PAS, GMS, and acid-fast stains. A mild to moderate chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate is usually present in the submucosa. Pulmonary cryptosporidiosis is largely a case report event, most reports being from earlier phases of the AIDS epidemic 404 -a surprise in reviewing acid-fast stains for more common organisms. 405 Newer reports suggest that respiratory cryptosporidiosis may occur in immunocompetent children with cryptosporidial diarrhea and cough. 406, 407 \n\nThe microsporidia are obligate intracellular spore-forming protozoa. More than 140 genera and 1200 species are recognized, but only 7 genera and a few species have been confirmed as human pathogens. 408 They are opportunists that have recently emerged in severely immunocompromised patients, AIDS patients, and transplant recipients, with case reports of pulmonary infections in the immunocompromised population. [409] [410] [411] Clinically they primarily cause chronic diarrhea and cholangitis. In the lung, they cause bronchitis or bronchiolitis (or both), usually in patients who also have intestinal infections or disease at other sites, especially the biliary tract. 412 The predominant pathologic changes are in the airways, which show a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. 413 The organisms are found within vacuoles in the apical portion of epithelial cells lining the airways. They appear as very small (1 to 1.5 \u00b5m in diameter) basophilic dots whose recognition depends on organism load. However, even when heavy, the findings can be subtle. Also, as with cryptosporidiosis, their presence is often overlooked or obscured by coexistent pneumonias. Special stains-such as modified trichrome, Warthin-Starry-type silver, and Gram stains-are more sensitive and specific, especially when used in combination. 414 Leishmaniasis Leishmaniasis (Leishmania donovani infection) is transmitted to humans by several species of the Phlebotomus sand fly. 415 Pulmonary leishmaniasis has been reported in HIV-infected patients and transplant recipients. 385, 416, 417 The organisms (L. donovani amastigotes) can be found in the alveoli and alveolar septa and may be recovered in BAL fluid from these patients. 418 They also can be found in bronchoscopic biopsies ( Fig.  7.115 ). Serologic testing for leishmaniasis has been suggested as part of the pretransplantation work-up in endemic areas. 419 A rapid PCRamplified diagnostic method has been described. 420\n\nThe zoonosis caused by Dirofilaria immitis, a parasite of dogs and other mammals, is transmitted by mosquitos and black flies to humans. [421] [422] [423] Larvae injected by these insect vectors migrate from the subcutis into veins and travel to the heart, where they die before maturing into adult worms. They are then washed into the lungs by the pulmonary arterial blood flow, where they form the nidus of a thrombus. Formation of an infarct follows, typically manifesting as an asymptomatic solitary pulmonary nodule (\"coin lesion\") in the lung after hatching from ingested eggs, 428 invade the small intestinal mucosa. At this site occult infection may remain asymptomatic for years. Dissemination typically follows debilitation brought on by immunocompromising diseases and therapies. When this occurs, filariform larvae leave the gut and travel through the pulmonary vasculature. When they penetrate alveoli (Fig. 7.119) , they provoke hemorrhage and inflammation. [429] [430] [431] Loeffler syndrome, eosinophilic pneumonia, and abscesses may develop. When migration is interrupted, filariform larvae may metamorphose in situ to adult worms, which can produce eggs and rhabditiform larvae. Larvae identified in the sputum indicate hyperinfection. 432 Disseminated strongyloidiasis is but one example of an infection that may become manifest, particularly in immunocompromised patients, years after emigration from or travel to an endemic periphery ( Fig. 7.116 ) that may be visualized on a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. [424] [425] [426] Microscopically the nodule resembles a typical infarct with a core of coagulation necrosis but also containing degenerated worm fragments in the remnant of an arteriole (Figs. 7.117 and 7.118). A peripheral investment of chronic granulation tissue forms an interface with the alveolated parenchyma. \"\n\nStep\" sections and trichrome stains may be needed when H&E sections do not show the parasite. 427\n\nStrongyloides is a parasite most often found in patients or travelers in the tropics, but endemic foci are present in the southeastern United States. Rhabditiform larvae of the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis, chronic inflammatory cells that form an interface with the alveolated parenchyma. Cysts that rupture into bronchi may be expectorated as debris with protoscolices or portions of the cyst wall. Abscesses and granulomas may also form in the lung, pleura, and chest wall. 436\n\nThe parasite Paragonimus targets the lung and is acquired by the ingestion of freshwater crabs or crayfish infected with the metacercarial larvae of Paragonimus species. 437 Most cases worldwide are due to P. westermani, but several other species exist in Asia, Africa, and South and Latin America. In the United States, infections due to P. kellicotti have been reported. 390 The disease manifestations are related to the migratory route and the inflammatory response these hermaphroditic flukes stimulate as they enter lung parenchyma and travel to sites near larger bronchioles or bronchi. Typically an area of eosinophil-rich inflammatory reaction surrounds them, and this reactive process may evolve to form a fibrous pseudocyst or capsule containing worms, exudate, and debris ( Fig.  7 .121A). Cysts rupturing into bronchioles may result in eggs, blood, and inflammatory cells being coughed up in the sputum. Alternatively, eggs may become embedded in parenchyma, producing nodular granulomatous lesions (Fig. 7 .121B) that progress to scars. 438 The eggs are yellowish, ovoid, and operculated, measuring 75 to 110 \u00b5m by 45 to 60 \u00b5m. The opercula unfortunately are not easily seen in tissue; however, the eggs are birefringent under polarized light, which helps to distinguish them from nonbirefringent schistosome eggs (Fig. 7.122 ). 390\n\nThe public health burden of schistosomiasis is enormous. This parasitic infection affects 200 million people in 74 countries while continuing to expand its geographical range. 439, 440 The life cycle and disease manifestations of the three major Schistosoma species-Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma haematobium, and Schistosoma japonicum-involve eggs, snail intermediate hosts, and free-swimming cercaria, which penetrate the skin of susceptible animals and people and develop into adult worms. The male and female worms eventually come to reside in various human venous plexuses, depending on the species, where egg deposition occurs. Pulmonary schistosomiasis comprises both acute and chronic forms. The acute disease, referred to as Katayama syndrome, manifests with fever, chills, weight loss, gastrointestinal symptoms, myalgia, and urticaria in patients with no previous exposure to the parasite. Acute larval area harboring pathogens that are considered unusual or exotic by pathologists in the United States.\n\nEchinococcosis is a zoonosis that occurs wherever sheep, dogs or other canids, and humans live in close contact. Ingested eggs of the tapeworm Echinococcus hatch in the gut, releasing oncospheres, which then invade the mucosa, enter the circulation, and travel to various sites, where they develop into hydatid cysts. 433, 434 In the lung, unilocular slow-growing cysts are produced by Echinococcus granulosus. 435 Echinococcus multilocularis proliferates by budding, producing an alveolar pattern of microvesicles. 398 The cyst of E. granulosus has a trilayered membrane (Fig. 7.120A) with an outer fibrous, middle-laminated hyaline, and inner germinal layer that gives rise to brood capsules containing infective protoscolices with hooklets and suckers (Fig. 7.120B ). The layers usually become separated in tissue, with the outer fibrous layer containing resemblance. Adult schistosomes may rarely be found in pulmonary blood vessels. Worldwide, given the burden of disease in Africa and Asia, chronic disease is associated for unclear reasons with pulmonary hypertension. 444\n\nThe common parasites that cause visceral larva migrans are the dog tapeworm, Toxocara canis, and the less common cat tapeworm, Toxocara cati. When embryonated eggs are ingested by an intermediate host, typically a child with a history of pica, they hatch into infective larvae in the intestine. Subsequently, the larvae penetrate the intestinal wall, gain access to the circulation, and are carried to many organs, including pneumonitis and a Loeffler-like eosinophilic pneumonia may be seen in this setting. 439, 441 Chronic pulmonary disease is almost always secondary to severe hepatic involvement with portal hypertension. In this setting, the eggs of S. mansoni, and rarely S. japonicum or S. haematobium, may be shunted through portosystemic collateral veins to the lungs. The eggs lodge in arterioles, provoking a characteristic granulomatous endarteritis with pulmonary symptoms and radiologic infiltrates. 442, 443 When the endarteritis is accompanied by angiomatoid changes, the lesion is considered pathognomonic for pulmonary schistosomiasis. 390 Eggs typically are surrounded by epithelioid cells and collagen ( Fig.  7.123 ). Most schistosome eggs do not exhibit birefringence and are larger than Paragonimus eggs, with which they share a superficial by standard smear preparation, cytocentrifugation, or ThinPrep technology. A battery of special stains-including Gram, modified trichrome, Giemsa, GMS, acid-fast, chemofluorescent, and immunofluorescent, depending on reagent availability-can then be applied to detect cryptosporidial oocysts, microsporidial spores, or other etiologic agents.\n\nThe morphologic features of many of the aforementioned organisms are usually better defined in cytologic preparations than in tissue biopsy specimens provided that obscuring background debris is limited and that the cytopreparation technique and staining have been well performed. Pseudoparasites such as vegetable matter, textile fibers, pollens, red cell \"ghosts, \" and other extraneous material must be recognized and excluded. Thus, as for all of the various categories of microorganisms cited in this chapter, cytopathologic examination adds synergy to surgical pathologic and microbiologic methods.\n\nThe laboratory diagnosis of parasitic disease depends on the collection of appropriate specimens, which, in turn, requires appropriate clinical evaluation. For example, just as stool examination is the most efficient means of diagnosing most intestinal protozoa and helminths, respiratory specimens (e.g., sputum samples, bronchial washings, BAL fluid samples, touch imprints of lung biopsy tissue) can provide a specific etiologic diagnosis when pulmonary infections are suspected. 458 As in the case of cytologic samples, these specimens often reveal the characteristic microanatomic features of parasite larvae and eggs that usually cannot be readily seen when they are embedded in tissue. Moreover, the identification of organisms in respiratory specimens is diagnostic of pulmonary infection, whereas the presence of the organism in the feces of a patient suspected to have pulmonary disease provides only presumptive evidence.\n\nSerodiagnosis with immunologic and molecular methods can be useful when parasites are located deep within tissue, such as the lung, and not easily accessible to biopsy or cytologic sampling. 396 The effectiveness of serodiagnosis of parasitic diseases has been hampered by tests with low sensitivity and specificity, mainly as a result of the complex composition of parasitic antigens and the occurrence of frequent cross reactions. 458 In recent years, however, significant refinements in antigenic preparations and improvements in technology have resulted in assays with greater predictive value. The newer tests are based on enzyme immunoassay and immunoblot methodology. Many test kits are the lungs. This is the end point, for their growth is arrested by a granulomatous reaction and they never mature into adult worms. The granulomatous reaction usually has a conspicuous eosinophilic component, and larvae may be seen. 445 \n\nThe cytologic literature contains many reports of the successful identification of parasites in pulmonary specimens recovered by exfoliative (sputum, bronchial washing or brushing, BAL fluid, pleural fluid) and needle aspiration techniques. Some of these are listed in Box 7.26. 418, [424] [425] [426] 436, [446] [447] [448] [449] [450] [451] [452] [453] [454] [455] [456] [457] Commonly cited in textbooks and reviews is the finding of Strongyloides stercoralis larvae in expectorated sputum or bronchial washings of patients with hyperinfections ( Fig. 7.124) . Also common are reports of Echinococcus protoscolices and hooklets in needle aspirates from patients with pleuropulmonary disease. 45, 46 Use of largebore and cutting needle biopsies has traditionally been contraindicated in the setting of suspected Echinococcus infections; reports of success with fine-needle aspiration without untoward reactions suggest that this technique is a relatively safe procedure in which the benefits outweigh the risks. 448 Cytologic analysis is a sensitive and often preferred method to diagnose cryptosporidiosis, microsporidiosis, and other respiratory tract infections in the immunocompromised patient because it has the advantage of being less invasive. Specimens such as bronchial washings and BAL fluids can be prepared by high-speed centrifugation followed commercially available, and diagnostic services are available from the CDC and other reference laboratories. 459 With protozoal infections, serologic testing is especially useful for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. Several commercial kits are available for detection of IgG and IgM antibodies; however, false-negative results are possible in immunocompromised patients, and positive results must be interpreted with caution, especially when the index of clinical suspicion is low. 460 Real-time PCR analysis has been used for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in the immunocompromised patient. 461, 462 Antibody determinations also have value in cases of pulmonary and other tissueinvasive forms of amebiasis as compared with antigen detection methods, which are more useful for noninvasive amebic intestinal diseases. However, the best diagnostic approach to invasive disease may be the use of serologic testing, antigen detection, and PCR methods in various combinations. 463 For the identification of cryptosporidia, the new immunofluorescence tests and enzyme immunoassays that have been developed for intestinal infections may have application in respiratory infections. Similar tests are not available for the microsporidia, and diagnosis of infection with these organisms continues to rely on direct \n\nSurgical pathology Eosinophilic pneumonia, abscess, Loeffler syndrome with filariform larvae Cytopathology Filariform larvae in sputum indicate hyperinfection Microbiology Primary diagnostic stage in stool is rhabitiform larvae; filariform larvae may be seen in sputum and lung tissue; eggs resemble hookworm eggs but are rarely seen\n\nSurgical pathology Trilayered cyst with brood capsules containing protoscolices; fibrous wall forms interface with lung parenchyma; sometimes abscess and granulomas Cytopathology Protoscolices with sucker and hooklets or detached hooklets in granular background debris\n\nIdentification of hooklets and protoscolices in needle aspirates, pleural fluid, and sputum; serologic testing available staining techniques. For the helminths, serodiagnosis is possible for Echinococcus, Paragonimus, Strongyloides, and Schistosoma species using enzyme immunoassay methods, which have fair sensitivity and specificity. 385, 459 The available tests for Dirofilaria suffer from poor sensitivity and specificity and are not clinically useful at this time.\n\nThe key morphologic and microbiologic features of selected parasitic lung infections are summarized in Table 7 .13. In the absence of eggs, larvae, worms, or trophozoites, the various inflammatory patterns must be distinguished from those of other infections and various noninfectious processes due to toxins, drugs, and such entities as asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and pulmonary vasculitis syndromes including Churg-Strauss and hypereosinophilic syndromes. 464 Acute and chronic forms of eosinophilic pneumonia, as previously emphasized, have a varied etiology that includes parasitic infections. 465 False-positive morphologic diagnosis of a parasitic infection may be based on the presence of objects resembling parasites, 391, 466 such as lentils in aspiration pneumonia, pollen grains, or Liesegang rings. These ring-like structures can simulate various types of nematodes. 467 Careful attention to the microanatomy of an apparent foreign body and comparison with parasites illustrated in atlases can often resolve such diagnostic dilemmas. Some cases, however, may require referral to pathologists with specialized training and experience in parasitic diseases.\n\nSelf-assessment questions and cases related to this chapter can be found online at ExpertConsult.com."}
