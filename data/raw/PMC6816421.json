{"title": "Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector vaccines for WHO blueprint priority pathogens", "body": "In clinical trials, various dose levels have been assessed, ranging from 3 \u00d7 103 plaque-forming units (PFU) to 1 \u00d7 108 PFU.32 Considering both risk and benefit profiles evaluated in human dose-finding phase I trials, a dose of 2 \u00d7 107 PFU was determined as the preferred dose30 and was consecutively used in phase II and III trials33\u201337 as well as in WHO\u2019s vaccination strategy during subsequent EBOV outbreaks. Due to the high demand for vaccine doses in the growing DRC outbreak and, consecutively, to a relative vaccine shortage, WHO\u2019s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization has now, however, revised this recommendation for the current outbreak. Potency data from the currently deployed vaccine lots show that a 2-fold dosage reduction would on average still approximate a concentration of 2 \u00d7 107 PFU, and, therefore, a 50% reduced vaccine dose is recommended to be given to high-risk contacts (including health-care workers as well as contacts and contacts of confirmed EVD cases). In addition, a vaccine with a 5-fold dose reduction is recommended to be utilized more widely (i.e. in broader populations in which EVD cases occurred), potentially preventing tertiary EVD cases more rapidly.38 Efficacy data for this dosage, however, need to yet be generated.\n\nIn all clinical trials, VSV-EBOV was administered intramuscularly and primarily as a single-shot regimen \u2013 a regimen that had previously been shown to be protective soon after administration in NHP.15,24\u201326 These tested single-shot regimens are indispensable in outbreak situations, especially in volatile regions with insufficient infrastructure where follow-up vaccinations are often not possible. Yet, in comparison, prime-boost strategies utilizing VSV-EBOV may be beneficial when durability of the vaccine response needs to be expanded. First data have been gathered in a phase I trial, where a subgroup of 30 individuals received a prime-boost regimen (days 0 and 28) of VSV-EBOV at three different dose levels. The vaccinees developed higher antibody (Ab) and virus neutralization titers compared to participants who only received a single-shot; yet these observations were no longer statistically significant six months after initial vaccination.29 Prime-boost regimens are further evaluated in ongoing studies: The PREVAC study is presently assessing a prime only as well as a prime-boost regimen (at days 0 and 56) of VSV-EBOV in comparison to other vaccine strategies in an estimated 4500 volunteers, including children from 1 year of age, with a follow-up time of 12 months. Another ongoing study, the PREPARE study investigates immune response durability and vaccine efficacy is investigated in persons at occupational risk of EBOV exposure, such as health-care workers and laboratory personnel, across a three-year timeframe. Here, participants are either vaccinated with a single shot of VSV-EBOV or receive a booster immunization 18 months after initial vaccination. In addition, participants whose antibody levels decrease beneath a predefined threshold will also be offered a booster vaccination.\n\nAs studies published to date differ widely across variables such as size, study population characteristics, dosage, etc., a comprehensive concluding safety assessment has not been made. Nonetheless, VSV-EBOV has been described as safe and overall well tolerated, while also being reactogenic in the clinical studies published to date. The adverse events documented were generally mild to moderate and transient. Importantly, there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAE), other than one case of fever and two allergic reactions (one of them when the vaccine was co-administered with amoxicillin) \u2013 all which were resolved without sequelae \u2013 in now over 18,000 individuals who have received the vaccine in clinical trials.16,33 Besides local reactogenicity, which was reported in up to 90\u2013100% of the volunteers,28,29 the most frequently reported adverse events were systemic solicited reactions such as headaches, which were reported in 21\u201371%, fever in 10\u201350%, and fatigue in 12\u201350% of vaccinees in all published phase II/III studies.33-37 An initially unexpected adverse event constituted the emergence of arthritis cases that tested PCR-positive for rVSV in the phase I trial in Geneva, Switzerland. The study was halted when 11/51 volunteers developed oligoarthritis after having received 1 \u00d7 107 PFU or 5 \u00d7 107 PFU of VSV-EBOV and was ultimately resumed with a reduced dose of 3 \u00d7 105 PFU. Arthritis occurred on median 11 days after vaccination and lasted for 8 days. The development of arthritis did, however, not correlate with the dosage, as 13/51 individuals who had received the reduced dose likewise developed arthritis. In the reduced dose cohort, the risk of arthritis furthermore correlated with increasing age.39 It was also observed that its development correlated with higher vaccine efficacy.40 Three affected participants also developed rVSV-PCR positive skin lesions, with infectious rVSV recovered from one participant. After the study halt, simultaneously running phase I studies of VSV-EBOV included arthralgia/arthritis as a solicited adverse event, but while transient arthralgia was likewise reported, the high frequency of arthritis cases was not observed to the same extent.28\u201331,41 Finally, arthritis frequency was assessed in a large placebo-controlled phase III trial. Here, the incidence of arthritis or joint swelling was 4.9% in a study population of 1050 individuals. Its onset and duration was comparable to the observations in the Geneva trial, and again, age was associated with a higher incidence, which was more pronounced in the lower dose cohort (here: 2 \u00d7 107 PFU vs. 1 \u00d7 108 PFU).35 The first emerging data from a small subset of 90 surveyed individuals vaccinated during the current EVD outbreak in the DRC seem to mirror the safety assessment obtained in these clinical trials, and while adverse events were frequent, arthralgia and rash were reported in only 7% and 5%, respectively.42 Importantly, vaccine satisfaction was reported to be high, which is a very encouraging finding, as misconceptions about the vaccine and EVD constitute a serious challenge for health-care workers to administer vaccinations and care in the current outbreak setting.\n\nBesides the assessment of adverse events, early clinical studies also focused on evaluating potential viral shedding by vaccinated individuals via testing of saliva and urine. In the NHP model, viral shedding was previously not observed.24 In humans, rVSV viremia could be detected early after vaccination with resolution 3\u20135 days p.v.; however, viral shedding was extremely rare and presented in individuals with very high viremia.31 Notably, children (6\u201312 years of age) and, less pronouncedly, adolescents were found to have higher viremia and shedding frequency than adults when vaccinated with 2 \u00d7 107 PFU of VSV-EBOV, raising the question whether lower vaccine doses might be required in pediatric populations.41\n\nIt is important to note that vaccine safety was primarily assessed in healthy adults. Pregnant women and children are, however, disproportionally affected by EVD and safety data from these populations are scarce but essential.\n\nUntil now, a small number of children have been included in clinical trials. Despite the observed aforementioned higher viremia in a total of 40 pediatric individuals by Agnandji and colleagues, the vaccine had a comparable safety and immunogenicity profile to that of adults receiving the same dose.41 A subsequent phase III trial as well as vaccine usage under expanded access showed an acceptable safety profile in over 500 vaccinated children aged 6\u201317.33,43 Unpublished and ongoing trials are now also including children aged 1 year and above (M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) (NCT03161366) and PREVAC trials) and will hopefully provide more data on safety and efficacy of VSV-EBOV in the pediatric population.\n\nTo date, pregnant women have been excluded from VSV-EBOV vaccine trials due to the safety concerns of administering a live-attenuated vaccine to this vulnerable population. At the same time, mortality rates are exorbitantly high with a lethality of around 90% in EVD-affected pregnant women and roughly 100% for the unborn children. Of those pregnant women who have inadvertently received the vaccine, no case outcomes have been published to date. However, 43 women reported pregnancies within 2 months of receiving the vaccine in a controlled phase II/III trial. Reassuringly, in this cohort pregnancy losses did not occur more often than in the control cohort and no congenital anomalies were observed.37 The policy that pregnant women are not being offered the possibility of receiving VSV-EBOV has been a topic of repeated debate and controversy.44,45 MSF among others, have strongly argued in favor of inclusion of pregnant women, given the enormously high probability of death once infected. In view of the above, the Congolese Ministry of Health, backed by WHO, has recently announced a change of this policy, offering pregnant and lactating women as well as children under the age of 12 months who are contacts of identified EVD cases the vaccine as of June 15th 46,47 which is not only vital for the protection of this population, but is also an opportunity to generate data on vaccine safety and efficacy in this group and will be of great value in future outbreaks.\n\nAs EVD outbreaks occur in a population with high HIV incidence rates, it is all the more important to evaluate how safe the vaccine is in immunocompromised individuals. VSV-EBOV was reported to be tolerable in severely immunocompromised NOD-SCID mice48 and was consecutively tested in a simian-human immunodeficiency (SHIV) model. SHIV infected macaques did not develop overt symptoms such as fever after vaccination with 1 \u00d7 107 PFU of VSV-EBOV, a dosage previously shown to be protective in NHPs. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was limited, and EBOV-GP-specific antibodies could not be detected prior to challenge. When challenged with a lethal dose of EBOV 31 days post-vaccination (p.v.), 4/6 of vaccinated animals showed clinical signs of illness and two of them ultimately died. These two animals had been most affected by SHIV as they displayed the highest SHIV viremia and had the lowest CD4+ T cell counts in the group. Also, unlike the survivors, they did not show VSV viremia after vaccination.49 This study underlines the need for a further assessment of VSV-EBOV in immunocompromised individuals and probably for adapting vaccine dosage and schedule. One phase II trial of VSV-EBOV to date has included a small subgroup of 22 HIV-positive individuals: no SAE was reported in HIV-positive participants within one month of vaccination, but immunogenicity as measured by antibody responses was found to be lower as compared to HIV-negative individuals.34 To generate data in a larger cohort, the ongoing ACHIV phase II trial is specifically examining the safety and immunogenicity of VSV-EBOV in an estimated 200 HIV-positive individuals.\n\nVSV-EBOV contains the GP of the EBOV Kikwit strain, yet, in an NHP model, it showed cross-protection against the heterologous West African outbreak strain of EBOV Makona.50 The subsequent phase III trial \u201cEbola \u00c7a Suffit\u201d is the only completed clinical trial reporting human efficacy data of VSV-EBOV to date \u2013 and, as such, is the only trial reporting efficacy data of any EVD vaccine at the time of this review. The study was conducted towards the end of the West African epidemic and has yielded highly encouraging results. The trial utilized a ring-vaccination strategy: a cluster of contacts and contacts-of-contacts around a case of EVD was identified and randomized to receive either immediate or delayed vaccination after 21 days, the duration of one incubation period reported for EBOV, and EVD cases from day 10 p.v. were assessed.33,51 As the study reported a vaccine efficacy of 100%, randomization was lifted and all ring contacts were offered the vaccine, now also including children. None of the 3796 immediately vaccinated individuals developed EVD from 10 days post vaccination (p.v.), while EVD occurred in 16/2041 contacts of the delayed vaccination cohort plus in seven never vaccinated contacts. The perfect efficacy rate had initially been questioned and spurred a controversial debate since the trial design was unblinded and, as the number of EVD cases had already decreased, only few EVD cases were reported in the delayed vaccination cohort. The authors\u2019, however, rejected the notion that trial results were biased due to the open trial design.52,53\n\nOn the basis of these efficacy data, VSV-EBOV has received Priority Medicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medical Association (EMA) as well as Breakthrough Therapy designation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which enables a faster licensure process. The submission of a rolling licensure application to the FDA has been initiated by the manufacturer Merck in November 2018.54 Owing to its PRIME and Breakthrough Therapy designation, VSV-EBOV has been pre-approved for emergency use during outbreaks by SAGE as part of its Expanded Access framework (also called compassionate use program), while pending licensure.55 Under the framework, WHO provides the vaccine to consenting at-risk individuals, health-care workers as well as ring contacts outside of clinical studies.55,56 In a new flare-up of EVD in Guinea in March 2016, after the end of the West African epidemic was declared, the framework was utilized to vaccinate over 1500 individuals including children from the age of 6, and no EVD cases were reported in the vaccinated population.57 Another 3481 people were vaccinated during the 9th EBOV outbreak in the DRC in May and June 2018.58 During the current 10th EBOV outbreak in the DRC, which was declared on August 1st, 2018 and has claimed the lives of 2592 humans as of July 21st, 2019, VSV-EBOV has been administered a total of 171,052 times since the initiation of vaccination seven days later.59\n\nIn addition to WHO, MSF is also providing the vaccine using the ring vaccination strategy and has assessed vaccine efficacy in a clinical trial including 500 individuals from the age of one. The trial was reportedly completed on November 30, 2018 (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03161366) and the results are awaited with great anticipation. Meanwhile, WHO recently reported highly encouraging preliminary results of the ring vaccination regimen applied during the recent DRC EBOV outbreaks including a total of 93,965 vaccinated individuals and reported an estimated vaccine efficacy of 97.5%, thus strongly supporting the findings of the phase III trial.60\n\nIn the context of the deployment of VSV-EBOV in the field setting, the storage of the vaccine, which must be kept at a temperature of \u221270\u00b0C maximum, remains a challenge. The establishment and maintenance of cold chains in often rural surroundings with suboptimal infrastructure has been difficult.61 To date, stability data remain scarce, yet one study found that the vaccine stayed stable with comparable viral titers for 7 days when stored at +4\u00b0C.62 In a guinea-pig challenge model, vaccination with VSV-EBOV conferred protection from disease even when stored in various suboptimal conditions over 7 days (4\u00b0C, room temperature, 32\u00b0C, or three cycles of freeze-thawing from \u221280\u00b0C to room temperature), and only the vaccine kept at 32\u00b0C showed a significant reduction in virus titer.63 The data indicate that short-term interruptions of the cold chain may be tolerated without affecting vaccine efficacy.\n\nUnderstanding the correlates of protection in EVD remains a challenge. There is still no biomarker that associates with EBOV vaccine efficacy. The identification of EBOV-associated correlates of protection is challenging as markers can only be defined when EBOV incidence is sufficiently high such as during outbreaks. While the \u201cEbola \u00c7a Suffit!\u201d trial provided strong evidence for high protection of VSV-EBOV, blood samples to analyze immunogenicity and protection markers could not be generated during this trial.\n\nFirst insights into possible correlates of protection have been provided by assessing immune responses of survivor and fatal cases from EBOV-infected individuals following the West African EVD epidemic. One study demonstrated that fatal cases were associated with an increased expression of the exhaustion markers CTLA-4 and PD-1 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.64 A transcriptomic analysis of blood RNA from EBOV-infected patients showed elevated expression levels of genes associated with interferons and acute phase signaling pathways.65 Lower levels of inflammation correlated with virus clearance and robust EBOV-specific T-cell responses. Although these novel data provide insight into innate and adaptive immune responses, their contribution to protection in humans is still not defined. Notably, correlates of protection may differ between natural EVD infection and vaccine-induced immune responses.\n\nStudies comparing immune responses in EVD survivors are currently ongoing (C\u00e9sar Mu\u00f1oz-Fontela, Florian Klein personal communication).\n\nAnimal models can be crucial to decipher immune response mechanisms important for protection. In the past, guinea pig as well as non-human-primate EBOV models were used to unravel protective mechanisms. Andrea Marzi and colleagues comprehensively analyzed EBOV challenges in cynomolgus macaques after vaccination. Depletion methods, in which CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as B-cells were blocked, revealed a critical role for EBOV GP-specific antibodies.66 The pivotal role of VSV-EBOV-induced innate immunity in conferring early antiviral control and generating effective humoral immune responses was demonstrated in an NHP challenge model. Transcriptional whole blood profiling from vaccinated animals challenged at different timepoints (28, 21, 14, 7 and 3 days p.v.) uncovered that genes associated with antiviral innate responses were upregulated at early timepoints, and were delayed in an animal that did not survive challenge at day 3 p.v.50,67\n\nThe collection of samples obtained during the West African epidemic and the ongoing outbreak in the DRC together with numerous individuals vaccinated with VSV-EBOV can now generate a highly valuable body of information to fill critical knowledge gaps regarding mechanisms crucial for immune protection. A first meta-analysis has now been published by Gross and colleagues summarizing antibody responses of all clinical trials in which VSV-EBOV was tested.68 All studies observed induction of EBOV GP-specific antibody responses following immunization with VSV. Antibody responses developed at 14 days p.v., peaked around day 28 and remained detectable for at least 2 years.28,29,40 Besides evaluating humoral responses, clinical trials also evaluated all other arms of immune responses. One study focused on T follicular helper (TFH) cells and observed a correlation with antibody titers.69 Cellular immune responses were observed in the cohort receiving a dose of 2 \u00d7 107 PFU. Here, EBOV GP specific T-cells secreted mainly CD107a and TNF\u03b1, while lower dose groups showed antigen-specific T-cell responses.70 Recent advances in our understanding of the innate immune system and the use of systems biology approaches are beginning to reveal the fundamental mechanisms by which the innate immune system orchestrates protective immune responses to vaccination. We investigated innate immune responses following VSV-EBOV immunization and our data revealed an innate immune signature that correlated with antibody responses in the Hamburg VSV-EBOV vaccine trial.71 In addition, changes in expression levels of circulating miRNAs have been associated with increased EBOV GP-specific antibody titers. Furthermore, innate immune signatures were assessed in vaccinees from Europe and Africa, revealing an early induction at day 1 p.v. of chemokines and cytokines, associated with monocyte functionality.72\n\nComprehensive evaluations of immunogenicity following VSV-EBOV vaccination are still ongoing. Systems vaccinology approaches in which clinical, immunological, transcriptomic and metabolomic data from clinical vaccine studies can now be integrated and analyzed with data from survivors will be instrumental to further identify EBOV vaccine correlates of protection.\n\nVSV-EBOV is intended for use as a prophylactic vaccine; however, its implementation as a post-exposure prophylaxis is intriguing, as a swift identification and vaccination of EVD-affected individuals \u2013 if effective \u2013 would contribute to a timely containment of future outbreaks. In NHPs, VSV-EBOV was fully protective when given 7 days before challenge and ameliorated disease when given 3 days pre-exposure.50 In mice, vaccination with VSV-EBOV 24 h post-infection (p.i.) conferred complete protection, while guinea pigs only showed partial protection from challenge when vaccinated 24 h pre- to 24 h post-exposure. Lastly, in NHP, 50% protection was conferred in animals vaccinated 20\u201330-min post-exposure.73 In line with this finding, a separate study described an overall 50% protection from EVD when NHP were vaccinated either 1 h or 24 h p.i. or when vaccinated twice, at 1 h and 24 h p.i. with half the vaccine dose, respectively. Surprisingly, however, post-exposure prophylaxis with an rVSV-vectored vaccine against Marburg virus conferred similar protection against EVD, and the authors argued that VSV-driven innate immune activation as well as filovirus-specific immune responses may play a role in protection from EVD.74\n\nOf note, compared to the disease course in humans, the onset of clinical disease is faster and its manifestation more severe in the NHP model, with a lethality of close to 100%. When NHPs were challenged with Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), which leads to lethal disease in NHP later than does EBOV, 100% of NHP were protected when vaccinated with rVSV-SUDV 20\u201330 min p.i.75 The efficacy of post-exposure prophylaxis may thus well be higher in humans than in the NHP model.76\n\nIn humans, VSV-EBOV was first used as an emergency post-exposure vaccine in 2011, long before entering clinical trials, and has been used in a total of seven individuals with occupational exposure to EBOV. Here, the vaccine was administered 24 h to 3 days post-exposure and none of the individuals developed EVD.77\u201379 It is of course unknown whether, and to what extent, post-exposure prophylaxis prevented the development of EVD, but albeit that these case reports are anecdotal in nature, they are encouraging and provide the basis for current EVD post-exposure recommendations.76\n\nAlthough pre-existing anti-VSV immunity is rarely found in humans,8 anti-vector immunity after vaccination with a VSV vector vaccine might impair vaccine efficacy of future VSV-based vaccines and prime-boost regimens. While data investigating pre-existing immunity remain scarce, we recently demonstrated that vaccination with VSV-EBOV induced both vector-specific humoral and cellular immune responses.80 The VSV-specific antibody responses generated in humans in this study following vaccination with VSV-EBOV were non-neutralizing and correlated with EBOV GP-specific antibody responses.80 With regard to the potential simultaneous use of VSV-EBOV and VSV-based Lassa virus (LASV) vaccines in West Africa, Marzi et al. vaccinated cynomolgus macaques with VSV-EBOV 90 days after having received a protective dose of the Lassa vaccine VSV\u0394G/LASVGPC. Despite having significant anti-VSV antibody titers before vaccination with VSV-EBOV, the vaccination conferred full protection from EBOV challenge, suggesting that a repeated vaccination with VSV-vectored vaccines may be efficacious.81\n\nWhile clinical trials of VSV-EBOV are still ongoing, efforts to create more attenuated second-generation rVSV-EBOV vaccines are already underway with the goal to reduce reactogenicity while maintaining immunogenicity. In one approach, VSV GP was substituted with an EBOV GP exhibiting the mutation F88A which impairs cell entry. \ufeffVSV*\u0394G(EBOV-GPF88A) induced immunogenicity in guinea pigs comparable to vaccination with rVSV expressing propagation-competent EBOV GP. However, the vaccine construct was found to be genetically unstable and quickly reverted back to a more infectious variant when passaged. Further mutations may, therefore, have to be introduced in order to maintain propagation restriction.82 N4CT1-EBOVGP1 is another attenuated rVSV-EBOV vaccine candidate. The rVSV vector is attenuated by combining a translocation of the N protein from position 1 to 4 (N4) with a truncation of the VSV-G cytoplasmatic tail (CT), and expresses the EBOV GP from the EBOV-Mayinga strain from the first position of the rVSV genome.83 The vector has previously been tested as an HIV vaccine candidate in phase I clinical trials and was well tolerated.19,84 \ufeffN4CT1-EBOVGP1 vaccinated mice developed both humoral and cellular immune responses and guinea pigs and macaques were completely protected from EBOV challenge, mounting antibody responses in the latter by day 14 p.v.83 Importantly, vaccinated primates were also protected against heterologous challenge with EBOV-Makona.85 N4CT1-EBOVGP1 is licensed by Profectus BioSciences, a biotech company that has specialized in vaccine development and uses the attenuated rVSV vector in a number of vaccine candidates. N4CT1-EBOVGP1 is now being evaluated in a phase I dose-escalation trial (NCT02718469).\n\nWhile the largest EVD outbreaks to date have been caused by EBOV, EVD outbreaks caused by other ebolavirus species have also been described, and MARV and EBOV outbreaks occur in overlapping geographic regions. Cross-protection of VSV-EBOV and -MARV against heterologous strains has been demonstrated as outlined above;50,89 however, limited or no cross-protection might exist between the more distantly related species and genera.24,95,96 Therefore, a combination of rVSV-vectored filovirus vaccines would be desirable and has been evaluated.\n\nAfter being vaccinated with a multi-component vaccine consisting of rVSV-\u0394G-EBOV-, -MARV- and -SUDV-GP, macaques survived challenge with either of the respective species or TAFV. Monkeys challenged with MARV, EBOV or TAFV did not show clinical signs of disease, while those challenged with SUDV did. The authors argued that this observation could be due to slower replication kinetics of rVSV\u0394G-SUDV or the differential affinity of GP to antigen-presenting cells. They, therefore, tested a two-stage vaccination administering rVSV\u0394G-SUDV two weeks prior to vaccination with rVSV\u0394G-EBOV and -MARV, which resulted in complete protection from challenge with no clinical evidence of infection both when challenged with SUDV and subsequently back challenged with MARV.97 In another study, the rVSV-N4CT1 vector expressing either EBOV, SUDV or MARV GP from the first position of the rVSV genome was administered to macaques as a trivalent vaccine and none of the animals succumbed to the disease after challenge with any of the pathogens. However, a subset of vaccinated macaques did develop mild signs of disease as well as low levels of filovirus viremia, especially after challenge with EBOV, when this attenuated vector was used.98 The same vector is currently employed in efforts to develop a multivalent vaccine candidate against MARV, SUDV, EBOV and additionally Lassa virus.99\n\nThe arenavirus LASV is one of the primary causal agents of hemorrhagic fevers worldwide with more than 300,000 estimated infections recorded annually in West Africa, where it is endemic.100 It is a rodent-transmitted disease and, while disease courses are highly diverse depending on LASV clade, morbidity is significant.100 Since January 2019, Nigeria has been facing an ongoing outbreak of Lassa fever with 526 confirmed cases of LASV infections and 121 deaths (case-fatality rate 23%, Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) as of March 31, 2019).101 Due to its widespread geographic distribution, high incidence and the lack of a preventive vaccine or approved therapies, LASV has been identified as an emerging virus for which R&D efforts are given very high priority by multiple international professional organizations, including the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO.102\n\nAnalogous to rVSV vectors expressing MARV and EBOV GP, Drs. Feldmann and Stroeher had described a LASV Glycoprotein C (GPC) expressing rVSV, \ufeffVSV\u0394G/LASVGPC (clade IV, isolate Josiah), with no detectable pathogenicity in mice.17 As the NHP model is the most relevant animal model for LASV infection, efficacy of a vaccine dose of 2 \u00d7 107 PFU was assessed in macaques (n = 4).103 \ufeffVSV\u0394G/LASVGPC was well tolerated and no viral shedding occurred after vaccination. Hematology and blood chemistry analysis found a slight thrombocyte decrease as well as a slight elevation of ALT in 3/4 animals. 100% of the animals remained asymptomatic after lethal LASV challenge 28 days after vaccination in contrast to controls, which succumbed to infection, and high LASV-specific antibody titers as well as moderate T-cell responses could be detected. Immunity was not sterile and animals developed viremia that was cleared by day 10.103 Viremia was, however, not observed in consecutive experiments.81,104 Another vaccine construct with VSV expressing LASV nucleoprotein (NP) meanwhile only showed limited protection and was not pursued further.104\n\nThe genetic heterogeneity observed between LASV clades raises concerns on whether VSV\u0394G/LASVGPC can act as a universal vaccine and this question was examined in subsequent studies. In inbred guinea pigs as well as NHPs, vaccination with VSV\u0394G/LASVGPC resulted in full protection against homologous challenge as well as against challenge with heterologous LASV clade IV isolates 28 days p.v. Again, challenge of inbred guinea pigs with the clade I isolate Pinneo, one of the most genetically divergent isolates compared to Josiah, did not result in clinical disease, while it has to be noted that animals vaccinated with an irrelevant control vector did develop symptomatic disease, but were able to clear infection.104 Further work to elucidate Lassa cross-clade immunity is currently ongoing.105\n\nA better understanding of the durability of VSV\u0394G/LASVGPC is needed to estimate its potential benefit as a vaccine candidate. Stein and colleagues, therefore, sought to examine how early and how long VSV\u0394G/LASVGPC can confer protection. In a guinea pig-adapted (GPA) LASV model, animals vaccinated with 1 \u00d7 106 PFU VSV\u0394G/LASVGPC were challenged at a timepoint between 7 and 355 days p.v. As early as 7 days p.v. the vaccine provided full protection from clinical disease; however, immunity was not sterile. Antibody responses peaked on day 51 and were sustained until the final sampling date one year later. When challenged 355 p.v., the guinea pigs did develop signs of disease, but 71% of animals were still protected from death.106\n\nIn recent developments, CEPI furthermore awarded considerable research funds to develop, manufacture and ultimately stockpile a Lassa virus vaccine based on the above mentioned rVSV-N4CT1 platform.107\n\nWhile further research including additional studies in NHPs is warranted, the data suggest that VSV\u0394G/LASVGPC may be a universal vaccine candidate that can confer early and lasting immunity.\n\nBased on the promising results obtained from the studies with rVSV vaccine candidates expressing filo- and arenavirus GP, a replication-competent rVSV expressing glycoprotein precursor (GPC) of CCHFV, likewise a hemorrhagic fever virus, has recently been developed and tested in an immunocompromised (STAT-1 knock-out) mouse model. In this study, a prime-only and a prime-boost regimen (days 0 and 7) were compared to mock vaccination, and immunogenicity, as well as protection from challenge with CCHFV 35 days after prime vaccination were assessed. Both groups receiving either one or two injections developed CCHFV-GP binding as well as virus neutralizing antibodies. The prime-boost group showed milder signs of infection and 100% of animals in both prime-only and prime-boost groups survived the challenge, while none of the mock-vaccinated did.108\n\nThe Henipavirus Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic pathogen that can cause severe pulmonary and neurologic disease with a high case-fatality rate and has been responsible for almost yearly outbreaks on the Indian subcontinent. The NiV vaccine portfolio currently under development includes rVSV-vectored Nipah vaccines, which utilize rVSV expressing two different structural proteins as antigens, the NiV fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins \u2013 two surface proteins that together are required for viral cell entry. The rVSV vector expressing either antigen has been described in two different models, one with the insertion of either protein after VSV-G (VSV-G/F(NiV)), the other in place of the VSV glycoprotein (rVSV\u2206G-G/F(NiV)). In mice, intranasal (i.n.) administration of rVSV-G(NiV) and/or -F(NiV) induced neutralizing Ab (nAb) formation, and highest nAb formation was observed when rVSV-G(NiV) alone or in combination with rVSV-F(NiV) was given. The rVSV\u2206G vector was evaluated using i.m. vaccination and likewise induced nAb, especially when rVSV\u2206G-G- and -F(NiV) were used in combination.109 Of note, the combined administration of\ufeff rVSV\u2206G-G/F(NiV) was found to be lethal when given intranasally in 5/8 postnatal mice in a later study, while the individual administration of either vaccine candidate did not cause any symptoms, even when directly injected into the brain.110\n\nVaccination with rVSV\u2206G-G- or -F(NiV) was demonstrated to be fully protective against NiV challenge in a Syrian hamster model, where none of the animals developed disease.111 Similarly, the vector VSV-EBOV, complemented with NiV F or G protein downstream of EBOV-GP, was assessed in the hamster model and conferred the same level of protection from disease.112 Importantly, while the vaccine was administered 28 days prior to challenge in this study, a follow-up study additionally demonstrated peri-exposure protection. Full protection was achieved until one day before vaccination and decreased to 17% until one day after challenge, while administration three days after challenge did not show protection.113 Interestingly, similarly to observations made by Marzi et al. in an EBOV post-exposure vaccine model,74 an rVSV vector vaccine control also mediated partial protection when given one day pre-challenge.113 Antibody generation was associated with protection113 and a serum-transfer experiment confirmed that protection was antibody-dependent.112 A simultaneously assessed rVSV-\u2206G-EBOV vector expressing NiV nucleocapsid protein (N) was shown to be inferior to the F and G variants.112 The more immunogenic rVSV-\u2206G-EBOV-G(NiV) was subsequently demonstrated to be completely protective in African Green Monkeys, described as the most appropriate animal model for NiV infection.114,115\n\nSARS as well as MERS constitute severe pulmonary infections that are caused by SARS- and MERS- coronaviruses (CoV), respectively. A severe outbreak of SARS-CoV, which originated in China in 2002, spread swiftly and ultimately affected over 8000 humans within a few months.116 While the virus has been contained, its potential to reemerge and cause new outbreaks remains high, and the rVSV platform has been employed to create SARS-CoV vaccine candidates for such a future scenario. VSV-S expresses the immunogenic spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV between the G and the L gene of VSV. In a mouse model, vaccination with VSV-S induced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than immunization with SARS-CoV and conferred protection as measured by low or undetectable SARS-CoV viral loads in the respiratory tract, even when challenged 4 months p.v. Using antisera from VSV-S vaccinated mice in na\u00efve mice, it could further be shown that the protective effect was mediated by antibodies.117 This vaccine candidate was then attenuated by replacing VSV G with SARS-CoV S, resulting in \ufeffVSV\u0394G-S. Immunogenicity of the replication-defective vector was surprisingly greater than the immunogenicity of VSV-S when applied i.m., an effect the authors argued that could be due to a higher expression of SARS-CoV S protein in VSV\u0394G-S, among others. In an analogous manner, VSV\u0394G was later used to create a MERS-CoV vaccine by expressing the MERS-CoV spike protein (S), and VSV\u0394G-MERS displayed immunogenicity in rhesus monkeys.118 To date, no human clinical trials have been reported for VSV-based CoV vaccines and the WHO roadmap for MERS-CoV research and product development does not currently include rVSV-vectored vaccines in the port- folio of vectored vaccines.119\n\nrVSV vectors have also been employed in designing vaccine candidates against Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus closely related to Dengue, West-Nile, Japanese encephalitis and Yellow Fever viruses, which has been associated with severe neurological disorders such as microcephaly in newborns and Guillan-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. In 2015\u20132017, the spread of ZIKV infections received attention when it rapidly disseminated from Brazil throughout the Americas, where no autochthonous case of ZIKV infection had been described before 2015.120,121\n\nrVSV vaccine vector expressing diverse ZIKV antigens have been described in proof-of-concept studies. In 2017, an rVSV vectors that entails a mutated M protein as an attenuation factor (VSVm) and expresses either Zika envelope (ZENV) alone or ZENV \ufeffcontaining the precursor to membrane (prM) proteins (\ufeffZprME) was described. The constructs remained replication competent. In mice, vaccination did not trigger any overt pathology and \ufeffVSVm-ZprME vaccination did induce neutralizing antibody titers.122 As ZIKV infection does not lead to disease in adult mice, challenge studies were performed in offspring of vaccinated mothers and, therefore, statements about the efficacy of the vaccine were limited.\n\nIn another approach, the attenuated VSV-EBOV was used as a vector to express ZprME or \ufeffprM and soluble envelope proteins as antigens (ZprMsolE) and efficacy was tested in type I interferon receptor deficient mice (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212). The ZIKV vaccine candidates did not result in pathogenicity in mice, however, unexpectedly vaccination with VSV-EBOV control vector led to severe clinical symptoms in the immunocompromised mice, thus the VSV-EBOV-based ZIKV vaccine constructs appear to be more attenuated than the original VSV-EBOV in this study. Mice challenged with ZIKV 28 days p.v. were fully protected from disease. Antigenicity of ZprME seemed to be superior to ZprMsolE and 50% and 100% protection was achieved when mice were vaccinated with rVSV-ZprME 1 and 3 days pre-challenge, respectively. Interestingly, vaccination with the vaccines was sufficient to also protect outbred CD1 mice from EBOV challenge.123\n\nIn a study assessing multiple ZIKV antigens in a VSV vector, which was attenuated via a point mutation in the VSV L protein, combining the ZIKV prM and E proteins with the nonstructural NS1 protein showed robust humoral and cellular responses in immunocompetent mice, as well as protection from disease in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice.124\n\nFurthermore, a VSV vector expressing the ZIKV capsid protein was also shown to be immunogenic with dominating cellular immune responses and reduced viral replication in the spinal cord and brain tissues of immunocompetent mice.125 No human clinical trials using VSV-based ZIKV vaccine candidates have been initiated to date.\n\nThe rVSV vaccine platform exhibits many advantages as a vaccine vector backbone for the expression of viral antigens and has been tested as a vaccine candidate against a multitude of emerging infections. As a result of the recent clinical phase I-III trials of VSV-EBOV, we have now gained a significant amount of data in humans, which encouragingly suggest a favorable safety profile of the vaccine candidate as well as swift protection after a single immunization. VSV can readily be attenuated while remaining immunogenic. While the comprehensive details on VSV vaccine-mediated protective immunity have yet to be elucidated, the data generated to date support the premise that protection appears to be primarily inferred by antibody responses. However, cellular immunity is simultaneously induced. In addition, the fact that recombinants can be manufactured quickly with diverse antigens further adds to its value as a vaccine platform for outbreak pathogens. While we have focused here on WHO blueprint priority pathogens, a variety of VSV-based vaccine candidates have been described for other emerging or reemerging pathogens, including enterovirus 71,126 Chikungunya,127,128 West-Nile,129 Dengue,130 Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome,131 and Andes viruses.132\u2013134 Animal studies of VSV-based vector vaccines against MARV, LASV, NiV, ZIKV, and MERS- and SARS-CoV described above have yielded promising results and the progression of rVSV vaccine candidates to clinical trials may add to the portfolio of effective outbreak vaccines in the foreseeable future."}
