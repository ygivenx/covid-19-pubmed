We urge all countries to acknowledge the Italian lesson and to immediately adopt very restrictive measures to limit viral diffusion, ensure appropriate health-system response, and reduce mortality, which Green dots are for countries with more than 2 weeks of lag time from Italy; orange is for countries with 1-2 weeks of lag time; and red is for countries with 1 week or less of lag time. The Italian data curve is cut at 8000 cases to convey easier interpretability of lag times. Source: Center for Systems Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University."}
