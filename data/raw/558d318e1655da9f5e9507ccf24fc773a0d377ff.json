{"title": "Connectivity analyses of bioenergetic changes in schizophrenia: Identification of novel treatments Running title: Bioenergetic function in schizophrenia", "body": "Schizophrenia is a devastating illness that affects over 2 million people in the U.S. and displays a wide range of symptoms (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Cognitive impairment is a hallmark feature of the illness, and antipsychotics have poor efficacy in treating cognitive decline (7, 8) . The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a brain region heavily implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, possibly contributing to defects in working memory (9) . A variety of abnormalities have been reported in the DLPFC of schizophrenia patients, including changes in gene expression, cell density, receptor binding, and cerebral blood flow (10) (11) (12) .\n\nThere is also accumulating evidence of bioenergetic dysfunction in chronic schizophrenia, which has recently been reviewed and highlights a number of abnormalities associated with glucose metabolism, the lactate shuttle, and bioenergetic coupling (13) . There is also evidence for genetic linkage between enzymes that control glycolysis in schizophrenia including 6phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2) and hexokinase 3 (HK3), suggesting that genetic risk for this illness includes bioenergetic substrates (14) . Interestingly, studies using cell-level techniques have demonstrated complex bioenergetic changes, including decreases in mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism genes in dentate granule neurons (n=22) and in layer 3 and 5 pyramidal neurons from the DLPFC (n=36 and n=19) (15) (16) (17) .\n\nDecreases in metabolic transcripts included lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenases (NADH), and ATP synthases. We have also recently demonstrated decreases in glycolytic enzymes (HK1, and phosphofructokinase muscle type, PFKM) and glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT3) in pyramidal neurons, but not astrocytes, in the DLPFC of schizophrenia subjects (n=16) (18) . While examining the expression of individual targets is important, employing a signature based bioinformatics approach may help elucidate the pathophysiology of large biological networks. gene to determine if a knockdown signature has been catalogued in the database. By clustering the seed gene knockdown signatures in iLINCS, we are able to analyze the connectivity of the knockdown signatures (and thus establish a schizophrenia bioenergetic profile), identifying groups of L1000 genes that change concordantly following genetic perturbation. Furthermore, we can perform Enrichr analyses on these genes to gain perspective on bioenergetic pathology, describe potential multisystem pathological mechanisms, and inform pharmacological studies.\n\nNext, we aimed to identify therapeutic compounds with the potential to \"reverse\" glycolytic deficits as well as the associated changes in the L1000 genes. In order to select a potential drug intervention for preclinical testing, we relied on the 'connectivity' analysis to reveal positively (concordant) and negatively correlated (discordant) chemical (small molecule) and genetic perturbations. We developed a discovery based workflow to generate a list of small molecule perturbagens with L1000 transcript changes in the opposite direction of our knockdown signatures (based on concordance values from iLINCS, i.e. generating an \"inverse/discordant signature\") ( Figure 1 ). iLINCS provides over 40,000 transcriptomic profiles (signatures) of cell lines following treatment with chemical perturbagens such as FDA approved drugs, chemical probes, and screening library compounds including those with clinical utility and known mechanisms of action (19) . FDA approved drugs generated from this \"knockdown signature connectivity\" analysis could serve as candidates for therapeutic treatment in a preclinical model of schizophrenia. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists had multiple hits in our analysis and similar drugs in this class are currently FDA approved for use in humans (21) .\n\nOne of the leading hypotheses of the etiology of schizophrenia is glutamatergic hypofunction (22) (23) (24) . N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype glutamate (NMDA) receptor dysfunction is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, particularly in human pharmacological studies (25) (26) (27) (28) . Converging evidence suggests that NMDA receptor hypofunction may actually reflect a dysregulation at the receptor level, including mutations in NMDA receptor subunits (29) . Several studies have found associations between the gene that encodes the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (Grin1) and schizophrenia (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) . The GluN1 knockdown mouse model has a ~90% global reduction of normal functioning NMDA receptors, achieved by targeted insertion of 2 kb of foreign DNA into intron 19 of the Grin1 gene (39) . Additionally, mice with mutations in the Grin1 gene have well-characterized behavioral endophenotypes for schizophrenia; this includes impairments in executive function and working memory, increased stereotypic behavior, decreased anxiety-like behavior, decreased sensorimotor gating, and abnormal social interaction (40) . Several of these behaviors are attenuated with typical and atypical antipsychotics at doses similar to those used in pharmacological models of schizophrenia (MK-801 or phencyclidine models), including hyperactivity, stereotypy, and sociability deficits (39, 41) . Therefore, the GluN1 knockdown mouse model is a viable and useful tool for studying the interface of NMDA receptor hypofunction, bioenergetics, and schizophrenia symptomology.\n\nThere is evidence of abnormal bioenergetic pathways in GluN1 knockdown animals and other models of impaired synapses. For example, there is strong evidence linking lactate shuttle defects to NMDA receptor dysfunction in MK-801 treated rats and in GluN1 subunit knockdown mice (42) (43) (44) . Dysregulation of the energetic flow of lactate inhibits long term potentiation (45, 46) , and may contribute to cognitive deficits in GluN1 knockdown mice. Additionally, when lactate flow from astrocytes to neurons is stimulated, or when lactate is introduced to extracellular space, it enhances working memory and memory formation in rats (45) (46) (47) . Thus, drug-induced stimulation of lactate production coupled with behavioral studies in GluN1 knockdown mice could help elucidate the role of bioenergetic abnormalities in cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.\n\nPioglitazone is a member of the thiolazinedione (TZD) drug family (that appeared in our knockdown signature connectivity analysis) that is approved to treat type 2 diabetes and hyperglycemia (48) . Pioglitazone is a synthetic ligand for PPAR\u03b3, a nuclear receptor that is responsible for the regulation of several bioenergetic functions such as lipid homeostasis, adipocyte differentiation, and insulin sensitivity (48, 49) . Interestingly, PPAR\u03b3 agonists have the ability to reduce oxidative stress (via mediating nitric oxide production) as well as modifying mitochondrial metabolism by interacting with proteins associated with mitochondrial function (mitoNEET proteins) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) . Activation of PPAR\u03b3 via pioglitazone can also alter the transcription and expression of GLUT1, leading to changes in glucose uptake through PPAR\u03b3 and other mechanisms (48, 54) . Thus, we hypothesize that treatment with pioglitazone will help restore cognitive endophenotypes associated with schizophrenia in the GluN1 knockdown model via stimulation of metabolic pathways.\n\nIn our final experiment, we treated animals with pioglitazone and measured various behavioral outputs that are endophenotypes for schizophrenia (55, 56) . First, we assessed locomotor activity, stereotypic behaviors, and mania-like behavior. Next, we assessed executive function and cognitive flexibility using the puzzle-box test. This test requires the mouse to display problem-solving behavior as well as short-and long-term explicit memory to reach a goal area. To assess pioglitazone's effect on sociability, we used an ageand sex-matched mouse as a social stimulus (57) . Finally, we assessed sensorimotor gating using the pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle paradigm (58) . Taken together, these studies provide a bioinformatics translational approach to identify novel treatment strategies through the use of the LINCS library of signatures and connectivity analysis, coupled with the analyses of primary data and published work (to extend the set of 'seed' genes).\n\n.\n\nWe used laser capture microdissection coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (LCM-qPCR) to assess mRNA expression of our metabolic targets in enriched populations of astrocytes and pyramidal neurons in schizophrenia and control subjects (Table   S1 and S2). We have previously shown our LCM samples are enriched for specific cellsubtypes using neurochemical markers (11, 18, 59, 60) . No significant associations were found between pH, post-mortem interval (PMI), RNA integrity number (RIN), or age and any of our dependent measures. In a sample enriched for pyramidal neurons, we found decreases in PFKL (27%, p=0.010) and GPI (26%, p=0.015) mRNA expression (Figure 2 , p<0.05). We did not detect any significant changes in mRNA expression in samples enriched for astrocytes ( Figure   S1 ). To assess the use of antipsychotic medication in our patient population, we reanalyzed our significant cell-level targets with and without antipsychotic na\u00efve subjects. All findings remained significant without these subjects (PFKL p=0.037, GPI p=0.034) ( Figure S2 , panels A and B).\n\nWe also assessed the effects of antipsychotics on PFKL and GPI across multiple brain regions in the Stanley Medical Research Institute genomics database and detected an effect on GPI (p=0.006, fold change=1.09), but not PFKL (p=0.09, fold change=1.06). However, this effect was in the opposite direction of our findings, suggesting the decreased expression in pyramidal neurons in schizophrenia is not due to a medication effect. Additionally, we assessed the effects of ethanol use, smoking, and laterality on our dependent measures in schizophrenia subjects via secondary analyses of schizophrenia subjects on and off ethanol, smokers/nonsmokers, and left/right brain and did not detect any effects ( Figure S2 , panels C-H).\n\nWe built a schizophrenia bioenergetic gene profile of 6 glycolytic genes based on data from our cell-level postmortem findings (HK1, PFKM, PFKL, GPI) and the literature (LDHA, PFKFB2). These \"seed genes\" were used in subsequent \"lookup\" replication studies, iLINCS clustering analyses (followed by Enrichr analysis), and iLINCS connectivity analyses (drug discovery analysis using \"inverse/discordant\" signatures). Figure 1 summarizes the bioinformatic work flow for both clustering and connectivity analyses.\n\nTo replicate our bioenergetic findings, we performed in silico validation studies (\"lookup\" studies) using three independent datasets (Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI), Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM), and a frontal cortical neuron RNAseq dataset generated from IPSCs of a patient with schizophrenia and DISC1 mutation (61)). Table 2 summarizes findings from this study and previous studies in our laboratory, as well as the mRNA expression of our selected seed genes (LDHA, HK1, PFKM, PFKL, GPI, PFKFB2) in each dataset.\n\nLDHA is significantly downregulated in both the SMRI (-1.11 FC, p=0.022) and frontal cortical neuron mRNA (-1.64 FC, p=0.018) dataset, while PFKFB2 was downregulated in the MSSM microarray dataset (-1.31 FC). Many seed genes were unchanged in the SMRI and MSSM datasets. However, the SMRI database is an aggregate of 5 brain regions and the MSSM dataset utilized blended samples from the whole DLPFC, while our findings are from cell-level studies. This is supported by 5/6 seed genes being above our fold change threshold in the cell-level frontal cortical neuron dataset.\n\nWe used iLINCS (http://ilincs.org) to retrieve knockdown signatures for each seed gene individually. Each seed gene knockdown signature (GPI knockdown signature, HXK1 knockdown signature, PFKM knockdown signature, PFKL knockdown signature, LDHA knockdown signature, PFKFB2 knockdown signature) is comprised of the transcriptional changes of 978 landmark genes (L1000 genes) when that seed gene is knocked down ( Figure   S3 ). Only signatures designated to be reproducible and self-connected (\"gold\") by the Broad Institute are available. When multiple shRNAs are available for gene knock-down experiments, consensus gene knock-down signatures, as defined by iLINCS are used. To minimize variability, we compared signatures for seed genes using one consistent cell line (vertebralcancer of the prostate, VCAP).\n\nFor unsupervised clustering analyses, we used iLINCS to cluster the union of the top 50 differentially expressed L1000 genes from each of the 6 seed gene knockdown signatures using Pearson correlation coefficients (Figures 3 and 4) . Due to gene overlap between top 50 differentially expressed L1000 genes in seed gene knockdown signatures, this resulted in the clustering of expression data for 260 L1000 genes. We next used the dendrogram function in iLINCS to select panels of mRNAs with increased expression across clustered seed gene knockdown signatures (\"panels of clustered upregulated genes\") and with decreased expression across clustered seed gene knockdown signatures (\"panels of clustered downregulated genes\").\n\nThese clustered gene panels (Table S3) were carried forward to two separate Enrichr analyses.\n\nWe performed Enrichr analyses on panels of clustered upregulated genes from our iLINCS clustering analysis. Top cell signaling pathways included forkhead box O (FOXO), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Wnt signaling pathways ( Figure S4 ). These pathways often interact and all have important roles in cell metabolism, inflammation, cellular proliferation, oxidative stress prevention, and apoptosis (62) (63) (64) (65) . Analysis of gene ontology (GO) cellular components for our panels of clustered upregulated genes included several microtubule and cytoskeletal components ( Figure S5 ), while the top hits for GO molecular function included protein kinase C (PKC) and MAPK binding ( Figure S6 ). Our protein-protein interactions analysis ( Figure S7 ) yielded multiple hits for protein kinases such as RPS6KA3, MAPK14, GSK3B, and CDK1. We also found hits for proteins involved in protein degradation and protein ubiquitination (CUL1 and SKP1), chromatin remodeling (PCNA and HDAC1), and an estrogen receptor (ESR1).\n\nWe next probed for kinases that when knocked down in various cell lines, have upregulated genes similar to the panels of clustered upregulated genes from our iLINCS clustering analysis. Top hits included several serine/threonine-protein kinases (AKT1, MAP2K2, PTK2, ATR) as well as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in energy homeostasis (NMUR2, FFAR1) ( Figure S8 ). We next probed for transcription factors that had occupancy sites for our panels of clustered upregulated genes. We found several transcription factors that play important roles in developmental processes, such as WT1, TRIM28, NFIB, NUCKS1, and TCF3 ( Figure S9 ). Finally, our database of genotypes and phenotypes (dbGaP) analysis implicates diabetes as the most relevant phenotype ( Figure S10 ). A summary of these findings can be found in Table 3 .\n\nWe performed Enrichr analyses on our panels of clustered downregulated genes from our iLINCS clustering analysis. Top cell signaling pathways include pathways relevant to immune/inflammatory responses and cell cycle regulation ( Figure S11 ). The top 5 hits in our GO cellular components analysis for our panels of clustered downregulated genes implicated mitochondrial function ( Figure S12 ), while the top hits for GO molecular function included several RNA polymerase promotors/activators ( Figure S13 ). Our protein-protein interactions analysis ( Figure S14 ) yielded multiple hits for chromatin remodeling proteins (PCNA, HDAC1, HDAC2, CREBBP). We also found hits for proteins involved in immunity/cell cycle regulation (NFKB2, CSNK2A1, MYC), and ubiquitination (BRCA1).\n\nWe next probed for kinases that when knocked down in various cell lines, have downregulated genes similar to our panels of clustered downregulated genes from our iLINCS clustering analysis. Top hits included several kinases involved in fatty acid metabolism and energy homeostasis (RXRA, PPARG, PXK), cellular growth (RYK, WEE1, ABL2), GPCRs (GPR37, LPHN1), and a glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) ( Figure S15 ). We next probed for transcription factors that had occupancy sites for our panels of clustered downregulated genes. We found several transcription factors that play important roles in cell proliferation (MYCN, MYC, E2F1, E2F4, FOXM1), development (NUCKS1, POU5F1) , and erythroid function (EKLF) ( Figure S16 ). Finally, our dbGaP analysis implicates carcinoma, memory, and Grave's Disease as the most relevant phenotypes ( Figure S17 ). A summary of these findings can be found in Table 3 .\n\nUsing the connected signatures function in iLINCS, we identified chemical perturbagens that produce L1000 signatures that are highly discordant (anti-correlated) with our seed gene Next, we combined all discordant perturbagens from Table S4 and reported the top 20 overall discordant perturbagen signatures across all seed gene knockdown signatures (Table   S5 ). After removing duplicate hits, 12 unique perturbagens remained (Table 4 ). Hits included PPAR\u03b3 agonists (troglitazone and genistein), valproic acid (a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker and HDAC inhibitor), typical antipsychotic drugs (trifluoperazine, thioridazine, and fluphenazine), and two PI3K inhibitors (Wortmannin and LY-294002). We selected the FDA approved PPAR\u03b3 agonist pioglitazone for preclinical trials due to its ability to regulate glycolytic pathways that are abnormal in schizophrenia, as well as evidence that pioglitazone treatment improves negative symptoms in patients (cognition has not been studied) (54, 66) .\n\n.

The affinity purified samples were enriched for PSD95 when compared to the supernatant and total homogenate ( Figure 5A ). Following mass spectrometry on affinity purified samples, we analyzed the top 20 increased proteins in GluN1 knockdown mice relative to WT mice with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The top 5 implicated pathways in the GluN1 knockdown mice were gluconeogenesis, glucose metabolism, pyruvate and citric acid metabolism, metabolism of carbohydrates, and glycogen storage disease ( Figure 5B ). Finally, we examined mRNA expression of metabolic transporters (MCT1, MCT2, MCT4, GLUT1, GLUT3) using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in a cohort of GluN1 knockdown and wildtype (WT) mice (n=5 per group). We found significant decreases in GLUT1 (47%, p=0.018) and GLUT3 (34%, p=0.013) in GluN1 knockdown mice compared to WT controls ( Figure 5C ), confirming that a strategy to increase glucose uptake capacity might be a successful intervention for schizophrenia.\n\nFor pioglitazone studies (in a different cohort of mice, Table S6 ), we assessed caloric intake and body weight to ensure pioglitazone treatment did not have adverse effects.\n\nPioglitazone did not affect the intake of chow or the body weight of the animals (p=0.5096) ( Figure S18 ).\n\nIn the puzzle box assay, we found that one week of pioglitazone treatment decreased (improved) time to perform task in GluN1 mice in Trial 1 (training, p=0.011) and Trial 4 (longterm memory, p=0.017) ( Figure 6 , Panels C and D).\n\nIn the open field test, we detected a genotype effect on locomotor activity, stereotypy, littermates, displayed an increase in hyperlocomotion, as quantified by an increase in total distance traveled measured in centimeters, which was accompanied by an increase in overall stereotypic movements and rearing. We did not detect changes in hyperactivity, stereotype, or vertical activity in GluN1 knockdown mice following pioglitazone treatment (Figure 7 , Panels B-D).\n\nIn the elevated plus maze, we detected an effect of genotype (p< 0.0001). GluN1 knockdown animals spent significantly more time in the open arms than did WT mice, regardless of pioglitazone/vehicle treatment ( Figure S19 ). Increased time in the open arm indicates a lack of anxiety and is observed in mouse models of mania-like behavior. We did not detect any significant differences in genotype or drug treatment in our social paradigm ( Figure   S20 ). We did not detect any differences in the acoustic startle response between any groups, although GluN1 knockdown animals tended to have higher startle responses ( Figure 8 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nBig biomedical data resources, such as LINCS, open new avenues for innovative analyses of primary data generated in conjunction with focused, hypothesis driven research being undertaken in individual research labs. Interdisciplinary studies that combine such resources and research expertise in neuroscience, bioinformatics, and data science can greatly enhance our ability to generate novel hypotheses and offer key insights into the mechanisms of human disease. The goal of this study was 4 parts: first, to further characterize changes in glycolytic enzyme expression at the cellular level in schizophrenia and to explore these findings in available in silico databases; second, to analyze the connectivity of bioenergetic pathology in schizophrenia by generating a schizophrenia bioenergetic profile in iLINCS and performing pathway analyses on panels of clustered genes that are highly differentially expressed across knockdown signatures; third, to generate a list of promising drug interventions with the goal of future preclinical testing; and fourth, to examine endophenotypes of schizophrenia following treatment with an FDA approved drug identified by our bioinformatic analyses in an animal model.\n\nOur findings of decreased PFKL and GPI mRNA in pyramidal neurons build upon previous reports of abnormalities in glycolytic enzymes, as well as glucose/lactate transporters, in the DLPFC in schizophrenia (18) . PFKL codes for the liver (L) subunit of the PFK enzyme, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in the third, irreversible and rate-limiting step of glycolysis (67) . There are several tetrameric isoforms of the PFK enzyme, each comprised of different combinations of L, muscle (M), or platelet (P) subunits. The PFK-5 protein is entirely comprised of L subunits, while the PFK-1 protein is entirely comprised of M subunits. Other erythrocyte PFK enzymes contain a heterogenic composition, and all PFK enzymes are found in brain (67) . Under conditions of high glycolytic .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint flux, cells can divert glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway; however, the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by PFK commits glucose to the glycolytic pathway. As a gatekeeper in the metabolic degradation of glucose, PFK is highly regulated, both by downstream metabolites and its strong allosteric activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP), which is produced by PFKFB when glycolysis is upregulated (Warburg effect) (68) .\n\nNotably, knockdown of PFKL impairs glycolysis and promotes metabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway (69) . Decreases in PFKL or PFKM expression in schizophrenia could affect normal enzyme activity, resulting in either decreased glycolytic breakdown of glucose or an inability to upregulate glycolysis when energy demand is high. Interestingly, the human PFKL gene is located on chromosome 21 and abnormal expression of PFKL is associated with Down's syndrome (70) . Additionally, we previously reported decreased PFK activity in the DLPFC of schizophrenia subjects (18) .\n\nWe also found a decrease in the mRNA expression of GPI in an enriched population of pyramidal neurons in schizophrenia. GPI is a dimeric cytoplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate in the second step in the glycolytic pathway. When expressed extracellularly, the GPI protein functions as a neurotrophic factor that promotes neuronal survival (71) . One study found an increase in glucose-6-phosphate levels, as well as several other metabolites in the glycolytic pathway, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of schizophrenia patients, suggesting improper functioning of glycolytic enzymes (72) . Other data suggest that GPI deficiency results in an accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate and over activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (73) . A decrease in GPI expression in pyramidal neurons could contribute to dysregulation of both glycolysis and mTOR signaling. A disruption in mTOR signaling could affect protein synthesis and lead to aberrant neuronal growth and synapse connectivity.\n\nSupporting this hypothesis, the mTOR pathway has been previously implicated in schizophrenia (74) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nBased on strong cell-level evidence from this study and prior work, as well as decreases in glycolytic enzyme activity, we generated a schizophrenia bioenergetic profile consisting of 6 functionally related genes (14, 15, 18) . These 6 genes (\"seed genes\") are strong glycolysis regulators and critical steps in the glycolytic pathway. The 6 seed genes in our profile were used for lookup replication studies, iLINCS clustering, and iLINCS connectivity (drug discovery) analyses.\n\nWe sought to replicate our metabolic LCM findings, as well as explore the mRNA expression of seed genes through in silico \"lookup\" analyses (18) . In our LCM studies, we found decreases in HK1, PFKM, PFKL, and GPI in pyramidal neurons in the DLPFC in schizophrenia ( Figure 2 , Table 2 )(18). We probed a second cell-level dataset (frontal cortical neurons differentiated from IPSCs of schizophrenia subjects with the DISC mutation (75)) and found that 5/6 of our seed genes were abnormally expressed (LDHA, HK1, PFKM, PFKL, and GPI) ( Table   2 )(75). LDHA, which was previously found to be downregulated in dentate granule neurons in schizophrenia, was also significantly downregulated in the SMRI genomics database (15) . We also found that PFKFB2, which is genetically linked to schizophrenia, is downregulated in schizophrenia in the MSSM DLPFC microarray data (14) . The SMRI and the MSSM databases contain region-level findings in multiple brain regions, while IPSCs and LCM techniques provide cell-subtype specific resolution. Further, prior work in our laboratory found a decrease in PFK and HK enzyme activity levels in the DLPFC in schizophrenia (18) . These findings suggest our seed genes are dysregulated at the cell, region, transcript, and functional level in schizophrenia, as well as by genetic association.\n\nWe used iLINCS (http://ilincs.org) to retrieve knockdown signatures for each seed gene individually. Each seed gene knockdown signature (GPI knockdown signature, HK1 knockdown .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint signature, PFKM knockdown signature, PFKL knockdown signature, LDHA knockdown signature, PFKFB2 knockdown signature) is comprised of the transcriptional changes of 978 landmark genes (L1000 genes) when that seed gene is knocked down ( Figure S3 ).\n\nAfter clustering the knockdown signatures of our 6 seed genes in iLINCS, we (separately) selected panels of clustered upregulated and downregulated genes using the interactive dendrogram function. This resulted in 67 upregulated and 69 downregulated genes carried forward to Enrichr analyses.\n\nWe began by using Enrichr to identify pathways associated with our panels of clustered upregulated genes from our iLINCS clustering analysis ( Figure 3 , Figures S4-S10). Using KEGG, we generated top cell signaling pathways which returned hits such as FOXO, Wnt, and MAPK signaling. These signaling pathways implicate glucose utilization, energy homeostasis, mitochondrial function, and cell growth. Our top protein-protein interaction hits (RPS6KA3, MAPK14, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) and cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), etc.) suggest a role for pathways involved in energy metabolism and cell proliferation. Next, we probed for kinases that when knocked down in specific cell lines, increased the expression of genes that were in our panels of clustered upregulated genes. We found several serine/threonine-protein kinases including AKT1, PTK2, MAP2K2, and ATR. AKT1 is one of 3 closely related serine/threonine-protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) thought to regulate metabolism and promote cellular proliferation (76) . We also had significant hits for G-protein coupled receptor proteins NMUR2 and FFAR1. Neuromedin U (NMUR2) encodes a G-protein coupled receptor protein widely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) that binds the neuropeptide neuromedin U in order to regulate energy homeostasis (77, 78) . These results suggest that kinases involved in glucose metabolism and cell cycle regulation are relevant to our panels of clustered upregulated genes. Finally, we performed pathway analyses to identify .

Our transcription factor analysis also generated hits for estrogen receptors (ESR1, ESR2), tumor suppressors/activators (ELK3), and transcription factors involved in immune responses and macrophage function (CEBPB) (79, 80) . Enrichr analyses are summarized in Table 3 and a full discussion of panels of clustered upregulated genes can be found in the supplement.\n\nWe used Enrichr to identify pathways associated with our panels of clustered downregulated genes from our iLINCS clustering analysis ( Figure 4 , Figures S11-S17). Using KEGG, we generated top cell signaling pathways which returned hits such as HTLV infection, hepatitis B, p53 signaling, and cell cycle pathways ( Figure S11 ). This implicates inflammation, impaired immunity, and cell proliferation. The top 5 hits in our GO cellular components analysis for panels of clustered downregulated genes implicate mitochondria and oxidative phosphorylation ( Figure S12 ). The top hits of our protein-protein interaction analysis ( Figure   S14 ) for panels of clustered downregulated genes included histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC2, a ubiquitously expressed protein that removes acetyl groups from lysine residues on core histones (81) . Other top hits in our protein-protein interaction analysis include proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and BRCA1, which also bind HDAC1 and are involved in epigenetics, DNA replication, and DNA repair (82) . Interestingly, HDAC1 is increased in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in schizophrenia and overexpression of HDAC1 leads to impairments in working memory (83) (84) (85) . There are accumulating instances of schizophrenia patients with mutations in genes encoding chromatin regulators (such as histone modifying enzymes and transcription factors) (86) . Other hits included transcription factors involved in inflammation and the balance of activation and suppression of cellular proliferation processes.\n\nNext, we probed for kinases that when knocked down in specific cell lines, decreased the expression of genes that were in our panels of clustered downregulated genes ( Figure S15 ). We The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint found multiple kinases with important roles in glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism. The nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b3 forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), two of our top hits, increasing the transcription of various genes that stimulate glucose uptake and carbohydrate metabolism (87) . PPAR\u03b3 ligands such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) increase glucose utilization, treat hyperglycemia, and represent therapeutic possibilities in diseases with deficient glycolytic systems (88) . We also found kinases that are involved in axonal growth during CNS development (RYK), cell growth and cycle progression (WEE1, ABL2), and cytoskeletal remodeling (ABL2). Finally, we performed pathway analyses to identify transcription factors with occupancy sites for our panels of clustered downregulated genes, several of which played key roles in cellular proliferation/development and were similar to hits from previous analyses (MYC, MYCN, NUCKS1, forkhead box M1) ( Figure S16 ). Enrichr analyses are summarized in Table 3 and a full discussion of panels of clustered downregulated genes can be found in the supplement.\n\nIn summary, we extrapolated on the abnormalities of glycolytic enzymes using Enrichr pathway analyses for panels of clustered up and downregulated genes. These analyses yield additional pathways and regulators involved in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and inflammatory responses. Inappropriate cell cycle regulation could contribute to metabolic deficits, while the immune system has previously been implicated in schizophrenia (89) (90) (91) .\n\nSeveral of our metabolic and immune findings were replicated in other large scale transcriptomic bioinformatic analyses of psychiatric disorders (92). These results highlight the connectivity of glycolytic pathology in schizophrenia to several systems that could be important targets in future studies.\n\nWe divided the top 12 unique perturbagens from our signature connectivity analysis into 5 groups: PPAR agonists, PI3K inhibitors, antipsychotic drugs, HDAC inhibitors, and other (Table 4 ). PI3K inhibitors constituted 2 of the drugs that may \"reverse\" our disease signature. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint These antitumor drugs inhibit PI3K enzymes, which are part of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and play critical roles in many cellular functions such as cellular proliferation, metabolism, and immune cell activation (93) (94) (95) . Recent work has linked schizophrenia pathology to the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling cascade (74, 96, 97) . Additionally, PI3K signaling can modulate synaptic formation and plasticity, and has been implicated in both schizophrenia and autism disorder (reviewed in (98, 99) ). Previous work demonstrated pharmacological inhibition of the catalytic subunit of PI3K blocks amphetamine induced psychosis in mice, highlighting PI3K inhibitors as therapeutic targets for the treatment of psychiatric disorders (100) . However, PI3K inhibition may be more suitable for \"positive symptoms,\" as PI3K inhibition results in diminished insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by inhibiting translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane (101) . Three of our drug discovery analysis hits were typical antipsychotics, which also treat positive symptoms of schizophrenia via dopamine receptor D2 antagonism (102) . It is possible that the glycolytic knockdown signatures used to generate these perturbagens could cause transcriptional changes in L1000 genes involved in the regulation of dopaminergic synapses, suggesting dopamine and metabolic systems could be connected in schizophrenia. This is not entirely surprising as antipsychotics have well documented metabolic effects (103) .\n\nThe top unique perturbagen in our signature connectivity analysis (Table 4 ) was valproic acid, an HDAC inhibitor that modulates sodium channels and enhances gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neurotransmission (traditionally used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder) (104) . Interestingly, sodium valproate (valproic acid) is commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of schizophrenia, and a recent 4 week randomized clinical trial demonstrated improvement in psychopathology with a combination therapy of valproate and risperidone or olanzapine compared to antipsychotics alone (n=249) (105) . There is also some evidence for positive effects on aggression and tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenia, although sample sizes are small (106) . Valproic acid also affects ERK and Wnt pathways, which were .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint implicated in our pathway analyses and regulate cell survival and cytoskeletal modifications (107) . Stimulation of ERK1/2 has the ability to enhance the transcriptional activity of PPARs and increase glucose metabolism, indicating PPAR agonists might also be potential therapeutic targets (108) . Interestingly, two of our unique perturbagen hits included PPAR agonists (troglitazone and Genistein) (109) . Troglitazone, part of the TZD family, is an anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic drug developed to treat type 2 diabetes. Troglitazone is a ligand to both PPAR\u03b1 and (more strongly) PPAR\u03b3, promotes glucose uptake by increasing two transporters we previously found decreased in pyramidal neurons in schizophrenia (GLUT1 and GLUT3), and inhibits the pro-inflammatory factor NFKB (implicated in our Enrichr analyses) (18, 54, 110, 111) .\n\nThe TZD family of PPAR agonists present an interesting therapeutic intervention for studies in preclinical models of schizophrenia due to their ability to modulate glucose systems we find abnormal in schizophrenia (112, 113) . Pioglitazone, a current FDA approved member of the TZD family, also stimulates glycolytic systems and can attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction, reverse memory impairment, and decrease the incidence of dementia (48, (113) (114) (115) (116) (117) (118) (119) . Thus, pioglitazone is an easily accessible drug candidate to \"reverse\" pathology and possibly restore cognitive defects related to schizophrenia.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we first examined metabolic pathways in the GluN1 knockdown model of schizophrenia. GluN1 knockdown animals display a wide variety of endophenotypes associated with schizophrenia, including deficits in cognition (40) . We found that top pathways associated with protein changes at the synapse in GluN1 knockdown mice compared to WT controls were metabolic in nature ( Figure 5B ). Additionally, expression of glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT3) were significantly decreased in the frontal cortex of GluN1 knockdown mice ( Figure 5C ). These results suggest there are similar abnormalities in bioenergetic systems in this model to schizophrenia, and that modulating these systems are viable treatment strategies. Thus, we examined the effects of pioglitazone, a PPAR agonist that increases glucose uptake, on behavioral endpoints in the GluN1 knockdown model. Pharmacological The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint manipulation of glycolytic pathways via pioglitazone could stimulate glucose uptake and metabolism, possibly restoring some behavioral deficits. We are also able to control for medication treatments, which can be difficult to interpret in human studies. It is important to distinguish significant metabolic changes as underlying features of the illness and not epiphenomena related to treatment with antipsychotics.\n\nWe hypothesized that pioglitazone treatment would improve cognitive function in the GluN1 knockdown model. The puzzle box assay examines cognitive function and is progressively more difficult, evident in the similarly poor performance by all groups in later trials.\n\nHowever, in all earlier trials (where GluN1 deficit is more robust), pioglitazone tended to increase WT mean latencies while decreasing GluN1 knockdown mean latencies. Our statistical analyses found that in Trial 1 and Trial 4, pioglitazone significantly decreased the latency to perform the task in GluN1 knockdown mice ( Figure 6 , panels C and D). This suggests that in normal physiology, pioglitazone could have a negative effect on learning, while in a pathological brain with impaired synapses, pioglitazone may have restorative effects on cognition.\n\nWe also examined the effects of pioglitazone on behaviors reflecting positive and negative schizophrenia symptoms. In line with published findings for this model (39) , our data suggest that GluN1 knockdown animals have increased locomotor activity and stereotypy compared to WT littermate controls, as well as increased mania and anti-anxiety like behavior (increased % time spent in open arms in EPM compared to WT mice) (Figures 7 and S19 ).\n\nPioglitazone did not have an effect on these behaviors regardless of genotype, suggesting that either glucose metabolism does not play a role in this phenotype of GluN1 knockdown mice or that this is a neurodevelopmental phenotype that requires earlier intervention.\n\nWe did not detect any changes in sociability between any groups. All groups choose to spend more time in the social zone ( Figure S20 ). Previous studies demonstrate inherent social abnormalities in GluN1 knockdown mice, suggesting our experiment may be underpowered to detect an effect of sociability (39) . We also did not detect any changes in social novelty- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint however our social novelty data has high variability, which could contribute to lack of significant findings.\n\nFinally, we assessed sensorimotor gating using pre-pulse inhibition and acoustic startle response (Figure 8 Our findings suggest that pioglitazone may selectively exert its effects on specific endophenotypes of schizophrenia, suggesting circuit-specific modulation of neuroplastic substrates. One possibility is that pioglitazone improves the function of brain regions and circuits that are hypometabolic, while having no effect/negative consequences on brain regions that are normal or hypermetabolic. Many behavioral endpoints that are markers of \"positive symptoms\" of schizophrenia could correspond to \"hypermetabolic\" circuitry, and thus not be amenable to rescue via pioglitazone. We found pioglitazone had no effect on behavioral deficits such as hyperactivity, increased stereotypy, and social impairments, which are normalized by typical and atypical antipsychotics in GluN1 knockdown animals (39, 41, (120) (121) (122) (123) . However, pioglitazone did have a restorative effect on cognition (puzzle box assay), while typical antipsychotics do not .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint (7, 124) . Studies examining the effects of antipsychotic treatment on cognition in GluN1 knockdown animals has not yet been done and are warranted.\n\nCognition includes several subprocesses, not all of which are uniquely sustained by the frontal cortex, but also by distributed cortical networks including frontal regions which may not be associated with the frontal lobes (125, 126) . These processes can include task management, planning, flexibility of behavior and thought, working memory, attention, or others. Thus, poor performance in any of these parameters could reflect a number of possible cognitive mechanisms (125, 127) . For instance, two meta-analyses of cannabis use on cognition in schizophrenia demonstrated cannabis improved certain subtasks for elements of cognition (visual memory, planning, working memory) while having no effect or worsening other tasks (attention, verbal memory, processing speed) (128, 129) . It is also possible that pioglitazone may only improve a metabolic subtype of schizophrenia. This is supported by our LCMS and qPCR studies in GluN1 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint Our findings also justify future pioglitazone studies examining different types of memory.\n\nFor example, pioglitazone may independently influence associative learning, spatial or working memory, cognitive flexibility, long-term memory, or recognition memory. Pioglitazone is also an FDA approved drug, and further human trials examining pioglitazone, antipsychotic treatment, and a larger number of specific cognitive aspects would be useful. This could be achieved through measures such as the Stroop word-color task (selective attention), n back test and backward digit span tests (working memory), Brown-Peterson test (memory capacity), or Wisconsin card sorting (planning and set-shifting) (125, 130) . Other indices of cognition such as the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), the Perceptual Organizational Index (POI), the Working Memory Index (WMI), the Processing Speed Index (PSI), the Immediate Memory Index (IMI) and the General Memory Index are useful in human cognitive battery (125) . In summary, these data suggest that pioglitazone may impact specific elements of cognition in models of schizophrenia.\n\nBioinformatics approaches have the potential to offer key insights into our understanding of how specific human diseases or healthy states manifest themselves. However, the techniques presented here have several limitations. Our pathway analyses are inherently biased as Enrichr is limited by previously published experiments, meaning some systems are more extensively studied and may skew results. Additionally, when selecting panels of clustered genes as inputs for Enrichr using dendrograms and clustering (Figure 3 and Figure 4) , it is not uncommon for 5/6 of the knockdown signatures to change in the same direction for a gene, while 1/6 knockdown signatures have no change or a change in the opposite direction.\n\nHowever, since the goal of the study is to analyze an aggregate signature, we selected clusters of genes that largely change together in the same direction. Enrichr merges human, mouse and rat data, an approach that has advantages and disadvantages, such as comprehensive libraries but a lack of species specificity (131).\n\nFor our chemical perturbagen analyses, two seed genes (HK1 and PFKL) had the .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint strongest discordant perturbagen signatures (Table S4) , leading to the overrepresentation of these two seed genes in the overall top 20 chemical perturbagens table (Table S5) . (132) . This is especially true of fundamental aspects of cellular biology, including energy metabolism and related pathways considered here. Further, the LINCS database includes 978 \"landmark\" genes that are selected as providing representatives of classes of co-expressed genes and to enable imputing the levels of expressions for genes that are not measured directly. There may be instances where this panel does not fully capture the changes found in disease states.\n\nOur in silico lookup analyses of metabolic targets in schizophrenia also present challenges. The SMRI database analysis function performs a meta-analysis across 12 independent studies, combining molecularly and functionally distinct brain regions. It is possible that for some genes, regions such as the cerebellum drive results, while more subtle differences in cortical regions are not reported. Additionally, both the SMRI and the MSSM databases were generated for whole brain regions, and are not cell-subtype specific. It is not surprising that . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint many of our cell-subtype specific findings were not appreciated at the region-level in our lookup confirmation studies. Gene expression may be increased in certain cell types and decreased in others, with no net changes (10) . The SMRI database particularly raises concern due to the number of individual studies used for comparison, many of which have varying subject demographics. This notion is supported by the observation that many of our targets are differentially regulated at the cell-level in the frontal cortical neuron database (75) . Limitations aside, it will be interesting to probe these datasets (and more publicly accessible databases) for targets in pathways that were implicated in our Enrichr analyses (Table 3 ).\n\nOur GluN1 knockdown work is not without limitations. While our locomotor and cognitive assay is adequately powered (n=9-12 per group), elevated plus maze, social paradigm, and PPI studies have an average of n=6 mice per group, which may not be large enough to fully elucidate subtle behavioral differences. It is also possible that pioglitazone doses used here may not fully produce therapeutic effects, and future work with varying dosing regimens is warranted. Additionally, as discussed above, cognition is multifaceted and the current study only utilizes one approach examining executive function (puzzle box assay). Several behavioral tasks such as fear conditioned learning (context versus cue), water mazes (contextual memory), radial arm maze (working memory), and novel object task would be useful in determining more nuanced effects of pioglitazone. Finally, additional biochemical experiments in GluN1 knockdown mice could help elucidate other potential metabolic pathways to target. This would provide the framework for future intervention studies using promising new pro-metabolic drugs in GluN1 knockdown mice or of pioglitazone in more models of schizophrenia (i.e. pharmacological, other mutants such as DISC1, SHANK3, NRG-1, etc.). This reverse translational approach could also generate targeted questions for future postmortem work.\n\nIn summary, we have utilized the LINCS library of genetic and chemical perturbations, coupled with a novel bioinformatics approach to gain insight into the connectivity of bioenergetic pathology in schizophrenia, generated candidate drugs with the potential to reverse the .

The cohort consisted of subjects with schizophrenia (n=16) and nonpsychiatrically ill comparison subjects (n=16) (Tables S1 and S2).\n\nSubjects were diagnosed with schizophrenia based on DSM-IV criteria. The medical records of the subjects were examined using a formal blinded medical chart review instrument, as well as in person interviews with the subjects and/or their caregivers, as previously described (133) .\n\nSchizophrenia and comparison groups were matched for sex, age, pH, and PMI (Tables S1 and   S2 ).\n\nLCM was performed as previously described (11, 18, 59, 60) .

Cells were captured in 4 hour sessions as we have previously demonstrated this time frame has minimal effects on messenger RNA integrity (11) . Following cell capture, each cap was incubated with 50 \u00b5l of PicoPure RNA extraction buffer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) for 30 min at 42\u00ba C. Samples were then centrifuged for 2 min at 800 \u00d7 g and stored at -80\u00baC until further processing.\n\nRNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (79254; Qiagen, NL) during processing. RNA was reverse-transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Before PCR experiments, samples were preamplified as previously described (11, 59, 60) . \n\nWe began by selecting genes of interest from schizophrenia pathophysiology to build a \"bioenergetic schizophrenia profile.\" We selected targets from the glycolytic pathway that were selectively downregulated in this study and our previous studies (GPI, HK1, PFKM, PFKL), as well as dysregulated in the literature (LDHA, PFKFB2) (Table 1) (14, 15, 18) . Knockdown signatures were retrieved for each seed gene in iLINCS, and these knockdown signatures were used in subsequent lookup replication, iLINCS clustering (Enrichr), and iLINCS connectivity (drug discovery) analyses.\n\nTo replicate our bioenergetic findings in schizophrenia, we probed a publicly available The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

The RNAseq database contains data from frontal cortical neurons differentiated from IPSCs from a schizophrenia subject with the DISC mutation and an unaffected sibling control subject (75) . We reported fold change and p-values for our metabolic targets in Table 2 .\n\nWe used iLINCS (http://ilincs.org) to retrieve knockdown signatures for each seed gene \n\nWith the goal of identifying panels of correlated transcriptomic changes in our seed gene knockdown signatures, we used iLINCS to perform unsupervised clustering of the top 50 differentially expressed L1000 genes from our 6 seed gene knockdown signatures (maximum of 300 L1000 genes) (Figure 3 and Figure 4 ). Due to gene overlap between top 50 differentially expressed L1000 genes in seed gene knockdown signatures, this resulted in the clustering of expression data for 260 L1000 genes. To generate this heatmap, we used the interactive \"gene The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We refer to genes that are upregulated across all signatures as \"panels of clustered upregulated genes\" and genes that are downregulated across all signatures as \"panels of clustered downregulated genes.\" Panels of clustered upregulated and panels of clustered downregulated gene groups were selected separately and the data was exported to Excel (Table S3, Figure 3 and Figure 4 ). These clustered gene panels (Table S3) were carried forward to two separate Enrichr analyses.\n\nTo assess the biological underpinning of correlating transcriptional changes in our seed gene knockdown signatures from iLINCS, we performed traditional pathway analyses on panels of clustered upregulated and panels of clustered downregulated genes using Enrichr (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) ( Table 3 , Figures S4-S17) (131, 134) . Analyses for panels of clustered upregulated genes (67 genes) and panels of clustered downregulated genes (69 genes) were performed separately. We report results for KEGG cell signaling pathway, gene ontology (GO) molecular function, GO cellular components, protein-protein interacting partners, and dbGaP disease implications. Using the ChEA 2016 database in Enrichr, we also report transcription factors that have occupancy sites for a significant number of our panels of clustered genes. Finally, using LINCS L1000 database in Enrichr, we report kinases that when knocked down in specific cell lines, increase or decrease genes that are in our panels of clustered upregulated and downregulated gene data sets, respectively (Table 3 , Figures S4-S17 ).\n\n.

This was done individually for each seed gene knockdown signature (unclustered) and the top 20 discordant chemical perturbagen signatures were recorded (Table S4 ). PFKFB2 had no discordant signatures, while GPI and PFKM had less than 20. Perturbagens appearing multiple times for the same seed gene are either in different cell lines or were administered to cells at different concentrations. We also recorded the top 20 overall discordant chemical perturbagen signatures across all seed gene knockdown signatures (Table S5 ). The top 20 overall discordant chemical perturbagen signatures were in the VCAP cell line. When duplicates were removed, 12 unique discordant chemical perturbagen signatures remained (Table 4 ). This list was use to select an FDA approved drug for preclinical trials.\n\nAnimal housing and experimentation were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Council in Animal Care (CCAC) guidelines for the care and use of animals. Mice were group housed with littermates on a 12-h light-dark cycle (0700 to 1900h) and were given access to food (2018 Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet, Envigo, Madison Wisconsin USA, www.envigo.com) ad libitum, unless otherwise specified.

We verified the specificity of this antibody using multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry analysis of PSD-95 peptides captured by affinity purification. 5ug of PSD-95 antibody was coupled per 1mg of Dynabeads (Life Technologies) according to the antibody coupling kit protocol (#14311D).\n\nFor each sample, 1000ul of 10mg/ml antibody coupled beads were washed 2x 1ml with ice cold 1x PBST (#9809S, Cell Signaling) then incubated with mouse brain lysate brought to a final volume of 1000ul with ice cold 1x PBST for 1 hour at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and the beads were washed 4 x 10 minutes at room temperature in 1ml ice cold 1x PBST. Captured protein complexes were eluted with 30ul of 1N Ammonium Hydroxide (#320145, Sigma), 5mM EDTA, pH 12 for 10 minutes at room temperature. 6ul of 6x protein denaturing buffer (4.5% SDS, 15% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.018% bromophenol blue, and 36% glycerol in 170 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) was added to each sample elution.

The Swiss-Prot Homo Sapien database, downloaded March 17 th 2015, was used as the reference database for all MS/MS searches. A precursor and fragment-ion tolerance for QTOF instrumentation was used for the Protalizer Caterpillar spectral-library free identification algorithm. Potential modifications included in the searches were phosphorylation at S, T, and Y residues, N-terminal acetylation, N-terminal loss of ammonia at C residues, and pyroglutamic acid at N-terminal E and Q residues.\n\nCarbamidomethylation of C residues was searched as a fixed modification. The maximum valid protein and peptide expectation score from the X!

A minimum of five fragment-ions were required for a peptide to be quantified (except where indicated otherwise). In datasets where a minimum of seven consistent fragment-ions were not detected for the same peptide ion in each of the three files compared in a triplicate analysis, the algorithm identified the file with the largest sum fragment-ion AUC and extracted up to seven of these in the other files using normalized retention time coordinates based on peptides detected by the Caterpillar algorithm in all the files in a dataset.\n\nTo generate the top pathways for GluN1 knockdown mice we input the top 20 increased proteins in GluN1 knockdown mice relative to WT mice from LCMS experiments into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).

The two areas are separated by a black Plexiglas divider, but connected via an underpass large enough for mice to pass through easily. Mice were placed in the start box facing away from the divider, and the time to move to the goal zone (through the underpass, with both hind legs in the goal zone) was manually scored and recorded. Mice were tested over three days, 3 trials/day, with each day consisting of increasingly difficult obstacles present in the underpass connecting the start area and the goal zone. 2 min were given between each trial on a given day, with a max 300 sec allowed for the completion of each trial.\n\nThe trials (and obstacles) for the puzzle box were as follows: The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Accelerometers were calibrated to 700\u00b15 mV and output voltages were amplified and analyzed for voltage changes using SR Analysis, and exported as an excel file. Background white noise was maintained at 65dB. PPI was measured in a 30-min test with 80 randomized trials of: (1) 10 trials pulse alone (2) 10 trials pre-pulse alone (for each pre-pulse), (3) 10 trials pre-pulse plus pulse (for each pre-pulse), and (4) 10 trials no pulse. 5 pulse alone trials were performed before and after the 80 trials, totaling 90 trials per run. The pre-pulse (4dB, 8dB, or 16dB) was presented 100ms prior to the startle pulse (165dB). The inter-stimulus interval (ISI) was randomized between 5 and 20s. Experimental mice were placed in a cylindrical tube on a platform in a soundproof chamber. Mice were allowed to acclimatize in the chamber and to the background noise for 300s, followed by 5 consecutive pulse alone trials, then by 80 randomized trials (as described above) and then 5 consecutive pulse alone trials. Pre-pulse inhibition was measured as a decrease in the amplitude of startle response to a 100dB acoustic startle pulse, following each pre-pulse (4dB, 8dB and 16dB).\n\nStatistical analyses for human LCM-qPCR were as follows: data were analyzed using Outliers were removed from data sets using the ROUT method (Q = 5%). All dependent measures were tested for normalcy and homogeneity of variance using D'Agostino & Pearson omnibus normality test followed by Student's t-tests. We probed for associations between our .

We did not detect any significant correlations between age, pH, and PMI with any of our dependent measures.\n\nIn addition to postmortem interval, pH, and age, we performed secondary analyses (using t-tests) to examine ethanol use, smoking, and laterality as grouping variables in our schizophrenia subjects and found no significant effects. We also performed t-tests after removing antipsychotic na\u00efve subjects and all targets remained significant. No subjects had any dependence for cocaine, sedatives, cannabis, amphetamines, hallucinogens, inhalants, or opioid dependence (only subject 828 took morphine for pain). Subjects with prolonged agonal states were not included in this cohort. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
