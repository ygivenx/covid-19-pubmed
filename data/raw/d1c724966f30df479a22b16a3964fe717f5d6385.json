With the active efforts from prevention and control, the quantity of discharged patients is escalating. How to manage these patients normatively is still challenging. We hereby reported an asymptomatic discharged patient with COVID-19 who was retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, which arouses concern regarding the present discharge standard of COVID-19.\n\nSince December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei, China caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a serious epidemic in China and other countries, resulting in worldwide concern. 1 Because of the seriousness of this outbreak, WHO declared it a public health emergency of international concern on Jan 30, 2020. As of February 21, \n\nWith the huge efforts from medical professionals to treat patients, substantial public health prevention measures, and accelerated research, the quantity of discharged patients is escalating. 2 How to manage these patients normatively is still challenging.\n\nWe hereby reported an asymptomatic discharged patient with COVID-19 who was retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, which arouses us to rethink the present discharge standard of COVID-19.\n\nA 54-year-old man had a close contact with a person from Wuhan at a meeting on January 12, 2020. He felt fatigue and mild myalgia on January 17. And on January 20, he began to have a fever of 37.5\u2103, so he went to a fever clinic of a tertiary hospital.\n\nChest CT scan on January 20 showed multiple and scattered ground-glass opacities in the sub-pleural area of bilateral lungs. Immediately he was diagnosed as suspected case of COVID-19 and isolated at an observation unit. On January 21, throat swab sample tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay, so he was diagnosed as a confirmed COVID-19 case. Gradually, he had a mild to moderate dyspnea, and a fever of 38.3 \u2103 on January 24. Followed chest CT scan demonstrated increasing area and number of ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs on January 24. He received supplemental oxygen at a rate of 5 liters per minute, and took antiviral drugs (0.2g of arbidol hydrochloride tablet orally taken three times a day) and low-dose hormone since January 24. However, the symptoms weren't improved at all. On January 27 he was transferred to a COVID-19-designated hospital and given antiviral treatment in an isolated ward (0.2g of arbidol hydrochloride tablet orally taken three times a day and 0.5g of chloroquine hydrochloride tablet orally taken J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f respiratory nucleic acid was negative for two consecutive times (24 hours sampling time interval at least), which is from the guideline proposed by the National Health Commission of China, the patient can be discharged and released from isolation. 3, 4 However, it remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-nasopharyngeal swab or sputum, and fecal virus nucleic acid detection were negative for more than 2 consecutive times (the interval was greater than 24 hours).\n\nAs mentioned above, an asymptomatic discharged patient with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid retested positive arouses concern regarding the discharge standard of COVID-19. Up to now, although no evidence demonstrated that a discharged patient who had repeated SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive could be infectious to others, the patient reported by us showed high viral load for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid after discharge. If any of these individuals was contagious and released from quarantine, he or she might be a potential and mobile infectious source. 8 Ethical Approval: This study was approved by Ethics Committee of our hospital.\n\nContributors: JFZ and TC designed the study, KY collected the data, HHY and JL analyzed the data, JFZ and JJZ wrote this article."}
