{"title": "A model for the emergence of drug resistance in the presence of asymptomatic infections", "body": "A characteristic that influences the transmission dynamics of many infectious diseases is the existence of a subclinical state, where an infected person does not show any symptoms but can, however, spread the infection to other individuals. These, so called, silent spreaders can make a substantial contribution to the transmission of the infectious agent in a population. Therefore, their contribution to the transmission dynamics of an infection should be incorporate d into the associated models.\n\nDuring a disease outbreak, any intervention strategy aimed at mitigating the disease impact is highly dependent on the ability to identify infected individuals, a task which is greatly impeded in the absence of clinical symptoms [1] . In particular , this becomes a vital task for a newly emergent pathogen (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome, pandemic influenza), due to the absence of a vaccine in the early stages of the outbreak. Policy decisions for public health planning rely on early estimate s of disease parameters, however, unreported subclinical cases lead to difficulties in accu-rately estimating the basic reproduction number of the disease [2] . The resultant uncertainty in epidemiologica l models greatly hinders the decision making process and casts doubt on the effectiveness of proposed interventions. The presence of subclinical infections in a population can significantly influence the outcome of non-pharma ceutical interventions , for example monitoring internati onal borders for symptomatic travellers can be undermined as asymptomatic individua ls are impossible to identify using standard methods [3] . Furthermore, isolating and/or treating clinical cases may be inadequate to protect vulnerabl e populations from the further spread of disease. Prophylaxis of exposed populations can be a useful intervention, in particular, when a vaccine needs time to be developed. However, the possibilit y of drug resistance as a byproduct of the treatment process is an undesirable, but potential, side effect and its epidemiolog ical impact and the likelihoo d of transmission of drug-resistant infectious agents need to be studied closer.\n\nSubclinic al infections are typically modelled using two approaches . The first separates the infectious population into asymptomatic and symptomati c states immedia tely following the onset of infectiousnes s [4] [5] [6] . However, not all diseases follow such a straightfo rward path and, in particular, the relative duration s of the latent and incubation periods should be considered. For certain diseases, a more appropriate model may allow for a preclinical state where an asymptom atic infectious state precedes the onset of 0025-5564/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2013.03.003 clinical symptoms, Fig. 1 . Such a model has been used in the context of influenza where the incubation period is believed to exceed the duration of the latent state [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .\n\nIn this paper we present some features of a mathematical model for aerially transmitted diseases (e.g. meningitis, influenza, staphylococcus aureus). In the model there are two classes of infected, and thus infectious, individuals; those who develop symptoms after an asymptomatic period and those who remain asymptomatic but infectious and recover without having passed through the symptomatic state. We provide a comparison with an alternative widely-used model which neglects the existence of a preclinical infectious state. We investigate the same features in a modified version of the model, where treatment is applied as an intervention strategy and the resultant developmen t of drug resistance as a side effect is evaluated. Both models are based on a previously developed model for the emergence of drug resistance during influenza epidemics under explicit consideration of asymptomati c cases [7] . We now generalise that model for any persistent infectious disease with infectious asymptomati c cases and in addition we elaborate on the dynamics when treatment is used as interventi on strategy.\n\nThe total population N\u00f0t\u00de is divided into four distinct classes such that N\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc s\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe i A \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe i S \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe r\u00f0t\u00de, where s\u00f0t\u00de denotes the number of susceptible individuals at time t, i A \u00f0t\u00de the number of asymptomati c infectives , i S \u00f0t\u00de the number of symptomatic infectives and r\u00f0t\u00de the number of recovered people. The infection is transmitted to a susceptible person through contact with either a symptomati c or asymptomatic infected person. Once infected, all susceptible individuals enter an asymptomatic state, indicating a delay between infectious ness and symptom onset. From here, an individual can either progress to the symptomatic state of infection or recover without ever developing symptoms. It is assumed that there are no disease related deaths and all infected individuals eventually recover. We further assume that recovered individuals do not obtain lifelong immunity to infection. This assumption incorporate s the antigenic drift of some infectious agents, such as influenza, which results in previously infected individuals becoming susceptibl e to the virus again. The transition diagram for the infection pathway is shown in Fig. 2 and the model is described by the system of equations ds dt\n\nwhere K and l are the constant birth and natural death rates respective ly. We assume all infected individua ls eventually recover , losing their acquired immunit y after a period of 1=a days and return to the suscep tible class. The transition rates associated with asymptomatic and symptom atic individua ls are b A and b S respective ly. Follow ing the onset of symptom s, the average time to recove ry is 1=c S days. For an asympt omatic case two scenarios are possible. An individua l may remain asympt omatic for the duration of the infection and recover after 1=c A days. Alternat ively, an individua l may remain asymptomat ic (preclinical) for a shorter period of 1=d days before ultimately developin g symptom s. Therefo re, the average residence time in the I A class is 1=\u00f0d \u00fe c A \u00fe l\u00de.\n\nThe limiting case d ! 0, yields a standard SIRS model for a silent (asymptomatic) infection [13] . In contrast, the asymptomatic state becomes redundant in the limit d ! 1, which corresponds to individua ls spending an infinitely short time in the asymptomatic stage and again results in a standard SIRS model for a purely symptom atic infection. Symptomatic individuals, on coming in contact with susceptibl e individua ls, transmit the infection more readily than asymptomati c individuals due to physical signs of illness (coughing, sneezing, etc.). However, asymptomatic individuals will presumably have more contacts since lack of symptom s implies a lack of self-induced quarantine [14] . We assume that the first effect outweighs the second and take b S \u00bc cb A , with c > 1.\n\nThe change in the total population size follows\n\nand the total population then develops via\n\nwith N approachi ng the limiting value N 1 \u00bc K=l. We assume that the population is approximat ely constant over the infection where births balance natural deaths. The constant populat ion assumption also allows us to write r\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc N \u00c0 \u00f0s\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe i A \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe i S \u00f0t\u00de\u00de and eliminate the equation for r from the analysis. It is conve nient to scale each compartm ent with the total populati on so that the resulting variable s represen t the proportio n of the total population in each compar tment. The model now becomes dS dt\n\nand the fraction of recovered individua ls is determine d from R \u00bc 1 \u00c0 \u00f0S \u00fe I A \u00fe I S \u00de. Equilibria of the system (1)-(3) are obtained by setting the right-ha nd side of each of the equations equal to zero. Clearly the point P 0 \u00bc \u00f01; 0; 0\u00de is a solution and represe nts a diseasefree state. The disease-free equilibrium can be used to determine the basic reproduct ion number. It represents the averag e number of secondary infections arising from an average primary infection in an entirely susceptible population [15] . It can be explici tly derived by calculating the next generation matrix using the methods outlined in [16] [17] [18] [19] . The basic reproduction number is given by the largest eigenv alue of this matrix which is found to be\n\nThe spread of infection can be viewed as a series of linked subepidemics. One subepidem ic will be driven by infection s caused through contact with subclinic ally infected individua ls (b S \u00bc 0) with a reproduct ion number R A and another driven by infection through contact with clinically infected individuals (b A \u00bc 0) with a reproductio n number R S . In practice, it is extremely difficult to estimate transmission rates for an epidemi c in progre ss. However, the basic reproduction number can be determine d from disease incidence data. Accordingly , R 0 is effectively a known paramete r from which the transmissi on rate b A can be determine d, and the symptom atic transmission rate is calculate d from\n\nNow in addition to the disease -free equilibrium P 0 , the system also possesses an endemic state P e given by\n\nWhen 0 < R 0 < 1 the infected populations become negative and the equilibrium point is no longer biologic ally feasib le. When R 0 \u00bc 1 the endemic state merges with the disease-free state to yield a single equilibrium . When R 0 > 1 both equilibria exist.\n\nFollowing the results outlined in [16] , the disease-free equilibrium P 0 of the system (1)-(3) will be locally asymptotically stable when R 0 < 1. To determine the stability of the endemic equilibrium P e , given by (5)-(7), the Jacobian matrix is evaluated at this point\n\nwhere, for convenience , we have set\n\nThe characterist ic equation is the cubic polynom ial F\u00f0k\u00de \u00bc\n\nand stability requires\n\nClearly f 0 > 0 when R 0 > 1. In any case, this conditio n must be satisfied for P e to exist. The second inequality can be written as\n\nwhich is alway s satisfied when R 0 > 1. Finally , the third inequal ity can be written in the form\n\nHence, the endemic equilibrium P e is always locally asympto tically stable. The existence and stability of the equilibria is complet ely determine d by the threshold paramete r R 0 . The disease-free equilibrium exists for all R 0 , is stable when R 0 < 1 and unstable when R 0 > 1. The endemic equilibrium exists only for R 0 > 1 and is alway s stable. This is an exampl e of a transcrit ical bifurcatio n. As R 0 crosses unity from below the disease-free equilibrium loses its stability and a positive asymptotic ally stable endemic equilibrium appears. The forward bifurc ation is shown in Fig. 3 , where we plot the steady state value of S as a function of R 0 .\n\nAs discussed in the introduction , another model commonly used to describe an asymptomatic-symptomatic infection neglects the possibility of a preclinical state, with the instantaneo us development of clinical illness following the onset of infectious ness. In addition, this model assumes that all asymptomati cally infected individuals recover without ever developing symptoms. We believe this is an oversimplification of the disease pathway for many infections (e.g. influenza). In this section we investigate the impact of neglecting the preclinical state on disease dynamics. For clarity, we will refer to this model as Model II. The alternativ e system of equations is given by dS dt\n\nwhere all variables and paramete rs are defined as before and p denotes the proportio n of infected individua ls who develop symptoms. The two limiting cases of a solely asymptom atic or symptom atic infection occur in the limits p ! 0 and p ! 1 respective ly. In fact, the two models are identical when p \u00bc d \u00bc 0 or in the limit d ! 1 with p \u00bc 1. The averag e residence time in the asympt omatic state differs in both models, with Model II yielding a longer residen ce time of 1=\u00f0c A \u00fe l\u00de.\n\nAs in the previous case, we can obtain an expression for the basic reproduction number from the next generation matrix,\n\nwhere R A and R S describe the contributio ns to the initial epidemi c growth of each infectiou s (asymptomatic/sym ptomat ic) state. The basic reproduct ion number is a characteris tic of the disease and can be estima ted from incidence date. In contrast, it is all but impossibl e to estimate the transmission rate and, accordingl y, R 0 is fixed and the above expressio n is used to determine the transmission rate for Model II,\n\nwhere it is assumed that b II S \u00bc cb II A . On compari son with the transmission rate for the basic model (4) we see that, with all other paramete rs fixed by the observed disease dynamic s, the two models yield unique transmis sion rates. So that, for a fixed value of R 0 , the two models will yield different transmission rates. For clarity, we denote the transmission rates of Model II as b II A and b II S and the corresponding asympt omatic and symptom atic reproduction numbers as R II A and R II S respective ly. The transmission rate contains information about the contact structure within the population and its value will depend on the partitioning of the population into the different disease states. The two models distribut e the infected population differently, determined by the parameters p and d, and we propose that this can lead to two distinct transmission rates. To compare the two models we write b II\n\nwhich contains the informa tion about the different distribution of cases between the two models. Identical transmission rates, corresponding to F\u00f0d; p\u00de \u00bc 1, are achieved in the two limiting cases of a purely asymptom atic (d \u00bc p \u00bc 0) or symptomatic (p \u00bc 1 and d ! 1) infection . In addition, it can be easily shown that\n\nThe recent influenza 2009 H1N1 pandemic has heightened the need for public health authorities to have pandemic preparednes s plans in place in advance of a future outbreak. However , the presence of silent spreaders, in the form of asymptomati cally infected individua ls, can severely undermine potential control strategies.\n\nIn particular, such individuals can have a profound impact on immunolog ically naive or compromise d populations, such as those in schools and health care facilities, where unavoidable close contact encounters can lead to the rapid spread of an infection. Disease transmis sion by asymptom atic individua ls was documented in such settings during the 2009 outbreak [20, 21] . Furthermor e, viral shedding during the preclinical stage of infection was confirmed to occur in approximately 1-8% of infections [22] and preclinical transmis sion was also recorded in early H1N1 outbreaks [23] . Mathema tical models have demonstrated how preclinical transmission can influence the magnitude of outbreaks in large closed populations , such as schools, workplaces and military facilities, and highlight s the importance of such transmis sion in the decision process [24] . In particular, a greater transmis sion ability during the preclinic al period has been associated with children [25] and this increases the need to understa nd the effects of this state on the disease pathway. In this section we investigate the behaviou r of the two models previously discussed for the specific case of the influenza virus. In particular, we consider the impact of a simple public health intervention applicabl e to large closed populations, where the easily identifiable clinical cases are isolated from the general population.\n\nTo parameterise the model we take the average human lifespan to be 70 years, with infection acquired immunity being lost after a period of 1 year. The degree to which asymptomatic individuals contribute to transmission is uncertain. Existing mathematical models assume the relative transmis sion from an asymptomatic case is from as little as one tenth [7] [8] [9] to as high as twice [26] that of a symptomati c case. However, while it is widely acknowled ged that asymptomatic infection is common, the ability of such individuals to efficiently transmit has been questioned, due to the low levels of viral shedding in such cases [22, 27, 28] . So as not to overestimat e the asymptomati c contribution we take the value c \u00bc 10. For modelling purposes, the proportion of infected individuals developing symptoms is commonly taken as approximately two thirds [4, 5, 29] . Justification for this choice is rarely provided, however , a recent review of experimental studies in which volunteer exposure to wild-type influenza virus was examine d determined that the frequency of symptom developmen t was 66.9% [30] . We adopt this assumption and set p \u00bc 0:67.\n\nThe course of infection for influenza is not fully understood. The primary uncertainty surrounds the incubation period and the possibility that it is longer than the latent period resulting in asymptomatic individuals who are infectious [1] . A mean incubation period of 2.05 days was estimated from laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 in the United Kingdom [31] . Viral shedding has been detected on average one day after inoculation with the influenza virus indicating that a latent period of approximately 1 day precedes the onset of infectious ness [30] . Accordingl y, the duration of the preclinical infectious state is approximat ely 1 day and we take d \u00bc 1 day \u00c01 , in agreement with experimental observations [30] . We neglect the latent period in our analysis as it essentially introduces a delay into the system and rarely results in qualitatively different dynamics [13, 15] . Infected individuals are commonly assumed to recover from clinical illness after an average period of 4 days and we set c S \u00bc 0:25 day \u00c01 [4, 32, 33] . This estimate is predominantly derived from studies that estimate the average duration of viral shedding and represents a rather conservati ve estimate. One could also use values derived from estimates of the mean serial interval, which in general have been somewhat lower, approximately 3 days, depending on the viral strain [33] . The duration of infectiousnes s for an asymptomatic case is unknown but previous modelling studies have taken it to be half that of a symptomati c case [34, 35] and we also adopt this assumpti on, taking c A \u00bc 0:5 day \u00c01 . The choice of a 2 day duration for the asymptomati c state yields a probabili ty of progressing to a symptomatic state given by d=\u00f0c a \u00fe d \u00fe l\u00de % 0:67, in agreement with the corresponding probability in Model II of p \u00bc 0:67. With the above choice of paramete rs, the average residence times in the asymptomati c state predicted by the basic model and Model II are approximat ely 2/3 day and 2 days respectively . It should be noted that, although the basic model yields a significantly shorter residence time, all infected individuals pass through this state and are capable of eluding intervention attempts while preclinical and silently spreading the infection within a susceptible population.\n\nThe basic reproduction number can vary significantly between different pandemic and seasonal outbreaks. Estimates for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic are in the range 1.3-1.7 [36] and an average seasonal value is approximat ely 1.3 [37] and we take this value in our simulations . The paramete r choices discussed above yield identical transmis sion rates for the two models since d c % 1 day \u00c01 from (13) and , thus, F\u00f01; 0:67\u00de \u00bc 1 in (12) . All paramete rs and the values used in numerical simulations are listed in Table 1 .\n\nThe solution for the infected populations of both models, with initial conditions S\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1 \u00c0 1=N, I A \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0 and I S \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1=N, is Table 1 and initial conditions are S\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0:99, IA\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0 and IS\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0:01. plotted in Fig. 4 . This initial condition corresponds to one symptomatically infected person in a completely susceptible population of size N \u00c0 1. A population of N \u00bc 10 4 is taken in all simulations. The solutions are qualitatively similar, however, Model II yields a higher peak incidence. Significantly, identical transmission rates does not produce quantitative ly identical disease incidence and the partitioning of the population into unique disease states is an important factor in the modelling process. In fact, there will still be differences between the models in the generation time, as well in several other quantities, such as the expected number of cases generated by an asymptotic individual. The delay observed in the basic model is invariably due to the delay introduced by all newly infected individuals being required to first pass through the asymptomati c state prior to symptom onset and the reduced transmission therein. The reverse occurs when the initial infectious seed is asymptomatic. The solution with initial conditions S\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1\u00c0 1=N, I A \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1=N and I S \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0 is plotted in Fig. 5 . Under this scenario, the delay in symptomati c cases is observed to occur in Model II. This can be attributed to the relatively small transmission potential of the asymptomati c cases and the resultant time taken for the infection to gain a foothold in the population. Whereas, some of the initially asymptomatic individua ls in the basic model quickly transition to the symptomatic cases and can start transmitting the infection more efficiently.\n\nThe impact of the duration of the preclinical state on the epidemic growth can be analysed by considering the relative contributions of each infectious state for varying d, Fig. 6 . It is clear that R A ! R 0 and R S ! 0 as d ! 0 and the only contribution to the basic reproduction number comes from the asymptom atic population, as expected with a silent infection. Similarly, R S ! R 0 and R A ! 0 as d ! 1 indicating the sole presence of symptomati c individuals. When d < 1 the basic model predicts a larger R A and smaller R S than Model II. This implies that, when the duration of the preclinical state exceeds 1 day, asymptom atic infections make a more significant contribution in the basic model and Model II may underest imate their contribution to the initial epidemic growth. Conversel y, when d > 1, corresponding to a preclinic al state of less than 1 day, the basic model predicts a smaller R A and larger R S than Model II, with the greater contributi on coming from the symptomati c cases, since the average residence time spent in the asymptomati c state decreases as d increases. Table 1 .\n\nTo investigate the consequences of the different population partitionings adopted by the two models we consider the implementation of one of the simplest public health interventions , whereby symptomatic individuals are isolated from the general population. The models can be easily adapted to incorporate this process by removing symptomatic individuals at the rate r that they are identified and placed in isolation. The proportion of isolated cases Q at time t will then satisfy the differential equation\n\nwhere isolated individua ls recover and rejoin the general population after an average of 1=c S days. The transmissi on term must also be modified to account for the fact that the fraction of infectiou s contact s changes from I=N to I=\u00f0N \u00c0 Q \u00de.\n\nThe results of the introduction of isolation as an intervention measure are qualitatively similar to before, Figs. 7 and 8. As Table 1 and initial conditions are S\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1 \u00c0 1=N, IA\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1=N and IS\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0.\n\nexpected, the peak severity of the outbreak is reduced and a delay is again observed between the two model solutions. However, the duration of the outbreak is extended and, in particular, the delay observed between the peak incidence of both models is significantly increased. In the case of a symptomatic initial seed, the delay in symptomati c cases increases from approximat ely 17 days (Fig. 4) to 33 days (Fig. 7) when isolation is present. If the initial seed is asymptomatic then this delay increases almost fourfold from 14 days to 55 days. Therefore, the different partitions of the asymptomati c population in the two infection models can produce very different results which could potential ly interfere with the design and impleme ntation of intervention strategies. More biologically realistic models can aid public health systems to effectively manage disease outbreaks .\n\nIf we consider the long term behaviour of both models, when the repopulation of the susceptible class through births and loss of immunity becomes important, we find the basic model approaches the endemic equilibrium given by (5)-(7). Model II approaches the endemic equilibrium P e II where S e II \u00bc 1 R 0 ;\n\nwhich exists when R 0 > 1. It can be easily shown that the two endemic equilibria are equal. Thus, the long-term behaviour of the two models is identica l but the short term oscillations are out of phase with each other, Fig. 9 . The reason for this delay was discussed in the previous section. The endemic equilibria as a function of d are plotte d in Fig. 10 . The equilibria coincide when d \u00bc d c \u00bc 1. When d < 1, and the duration of the preclinical state exceeds 1 day, the basic model predicts a larger endemic value for I A and a smaller value for I S . The opposit e is true when the preclinical state is shorter than 1 day, d > 1. This indicates that, in the long term behavi our of influenza, the disease burden could be over or under estima ted if the duration of the preclinical state is not accurately known. Better estima tes of this paramete r could yield more reliable predict ions. Table 1 .\n\nDeterminist ic models with vital dynamics have been shown to exhibit damped oscillations about an endemic disease state for childhood diseases [13, 15] . Influenza has a relatively short infectious period and small reproduction number compared with such infections (measles, rubella, etc.). As a conseque nce, the disease dynamics of influenza are sufficiently rapid that vital dynamics are typically neglected as they are inadequate to replenish the pool of susceptible individua ls quickly enough for the infection to persistent in the population. The classic childhoo d diseases also confer permanent immunity on those previously infected and consequently such diseases are largely restricted to the immunolog ically naive child population. Conversel y, the waning immunity associated with influenza results in individuals of all ages being susceptible to infection at the beginning of each flu season. This implies that the repopulati on of the susceptibl e class through loss of immunity may be an important contributing mechanism driving damped oscillations in the case of influenza, Fig. 9 .\n\nIt has been proposed that the long term seasonal variation in influenza incidence is the result of small seasonal variations in an external stimulus which resonates with the intrinsic period of oscillation [38] . This external stimulus was neglected in the previous discussion, where the intent was to highlight the intrinsic oscillations. The endemic equilibria only exist when either a or l are nonzero so that the susceptibl e compartme nt can be repopulated following an outbreak. The period of oscillation of the damped oscillations can be approximat ed by 2p=q, where q is the complex part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the endemic equilibria. The approximat e period is plotted as a function of duration of acquired immunity in Fig. 11 . For acquired immunity lasting up to 4 years an intrinsic period of less than 2.5 years is observed for the basic model, which can clearly resonate with an annually forced seasonal transmis sion rate. As immunity becomes permane nt (a ! 0) the system exhibits a period of approximat ely 10.6 years (Fig. 11 insert) indicating that natural birth/death processes alone are not sufficient to produce a period that will resonate with an annual seasonal stimulus . The differing periods observed between the basic model and Model II explains the out-of-phase oscillation observed in previous simulations (Fig. 9 ).\n\nVarious interventions can be adopted to slow the spread and lessen the impact of a disease. For a newly emerging virus, vaccines are unlikely to be available in the short term and the primary pharmac eutical intervention at the disposal of the health authorities is the use of antiviral drugs. A major concern with the widespread use of these drugs is the possibility of the emergence of a drug-resis tant strain which is more virulent than the drugsensitive strain. In this section, we consider the effects of treating symptom atically infected individuals with an antiviral drug. Asympto matic individuals are not treated as there is no way of distinguishing them from the susceptible population. However , the preclinic al cases, who proceed to the symptomatic state, can be treated once symptom s develop and they become visible to surveilla nce systems. We extend the basic model of Section 2 to describe two co-circulating strains, a drug-sens itive and drugresistant strain. Treatment is given to individuals infected with either strain but only to clinical cases. An initially susceptibl e individual can get infected with either strain. However, once infected with the drug-sens itive strain, the treatment process may result in the emergence of the drug-resis tant strain in said individual. As with the basic model, the subscripts A and S refer to asymptomatic and symptomatic individua ls respectively. We further adopt the notation that subscripts r and tr refer to the drug-resistant strain and treated individuals respectively . Thus, we denote the disease compartme nts as follows:\n\nI A , infected with drug-sensitive strain and asymptomati c, I S , infected with drug-sensitive strain and symptomati c, I A;r , infected with drug-resistant strain and asymptomati c, I S;r , infected with drug-resis tant strain and symptomatic, I S;tr , infected with drug-sensitive strain, symptomatic and receiving treatment, I S;r;tr , infected with drug-resistant strain, symptomati c and receiving treatment.\n\nThe transition diagram for the infection pathway is shown in Fig. 12 and the corresp onding system of equations is dS dt \u00bc \u00f0l \u00fe a\u00de\u00f01 \u00c0 S\u00de \u00c0 aR I \u00c0 \u00f0b A I A \u00fe b S I S \u00fe b A;r I A;r \u00fe b S;r I S;r \u00fe qb S I S;tr \u00fe b S;r I S;r;tr \u00deS; \u00f014\u00de dI A dt \n\nwhere R I \u00bc I A \u00fe I S \u00fe I A;r \u00fe I S;r \u00fe I S;tr \u00fe I S;r;tr . Each dependent variable represe nts the proportion of the total population that resides in that compartm ent. There is also an equation for the recovered compartment R. However , as before, adopting the constant population assumpt ion (K \u00bc lN) and noting that R \u00bc 1 \u00c0 \u00f0S \u00fe I A \u00fe I S \u00fe I A;r \u00fe I S;r \u00fe I S;tr \u00fe I S;r;tr \u00de, we can discard this equation and limit our analysis to the above system . Symptom atic individua ls are treated after 1=h days and, for the drug-sen sitive strain alone, treatment is assumed to reduce the potential infectivi ty of such an individua l by a factor q and enable a faster recover y determine d by r. We take Table 1 .\n\nr > 1 so that individua ls treated for the drug-sen sitive strain recover faster than those treated for the drug-resist ant strain. Following treatment for the drug-sensiti ve strain, the probability of the emerge nce of resistanc e is denoted by q with such resistanc e developing after an average of 1=g days. In addition, the transmiss ion rates for the resistant strain are related via b S;r \u00bc cb A;r with c > 1. All other paramete rs are defined as before and are listed in Table 1 .\n\nBy inspection, it can be seen that the system (14)-(20) possesses a disease-free equilibrium, which we denote by P 0 , and this can be used to calculate the basic reproduction number. The model consists of six diseased compartme nts, and we write the vectors F and\u1e7c as ;\n\n\u00f0c A \u00fe d r \u00fe l\u00deI A;r \u00c0d r I A;r \u00fe \u00f0c S \u00fe h \u00fe l\u00deI S;r \u00f0rc S \u00fe qg \u00fe l\u00deI S;tr \u00c0 hI S \u00f0c S \u00fe l\u00deI S;r;tr \u00c0 qgI S;tr \u00c0 hI S;r : The next generation matrix will then satisfy K \u00bc FV \u00c01 , where F \u00bc @F i =@x j j P 0 and V \u00bc @\u1e7c i =@x j j P 0 , and we find two nonzero eigenvalues given by\n\nwhere R A and R S are defined as for the basic model and\n\nWe essentia lly get two reproduct ion numbers, one for each strain of the virus (drug-sensitive R 1 and drug-resist ant R 2 ), and the basic reproduct ion number for the system will be the largest of these eigenv alues, R 0 \u00bc maxfR 1 ; R 2 g. Setting the right-han d sides of Eqs. (14)- (20) equal to zero, we can determine the remaining equilibrium points. We find that another steady state b P \u00bc \u00f0 b S; 0; 0;\u00ce A;r ;\u00ce S;r ; 0;\u00ce S;r;tr \u00de occurs where only the resistant strain is present. We obtain\n\nwhere, for convenience , we have set\n\nand X 0 ; X 1 and X 2 are defined as before. Clearly, when R 2 \u00bc 1 we simply get the disease -free equilibrium with b P \u00bc P 0 . When R 2 < 1 the infected populations become negative, which is not a biologically feasible solution. Hence, b P only exists when R 2 > 1. Finally , a third equilibrium state can also be achieved where both drug-sensitive and drug-resis tant strains coexist. We denote this equilibrium by P \u00c3 and find \n\nand where, for convenience , we define\n\nWhen R 1 \u00bc 1 we simply have the disease-free equilibrium with P \u00c3 \u00bc P 0 . When R 1 < 1 we find that S \u00c3 > 1 which is not biologically feasible. So we require R 1 > 1. In addition, if we consid er the expression for I \u00c3 A;r we see that the denomin ator must be positive to ensure I A;r P 0. Thus we require\n\nNow, consider ing the expressi on for I \u00c3 A we see that the numerator must also be positive which requires R 1 > R 2 and thus (32) is automatically satisfied. The above results on the existence of the equilibria are summaris ed in Theorem 4. The theorem is expressed graphically in Fig. 13 , where the existence of P 0 ; b P and P \u00c3 is shown in R 1 \u00c0 R 2 param eter space. Theorem 1. The system (14)- (20) always has a disease-fr ee equilibrium P 0 . An endemic equilibrium b P, given by (21)- (24) and where only the drug-resista nt strain is present in the population, exists when R 2 > 1. Another endemic equilibrium P \u00c3 , given by (25)-(31) and where both drug-sens itive and drug-resistant strains are present, exists when R 1 > 1 and R 1 > R 2 .\n\nIn this section we consider the local stability properties of the three equilibria .\n\nTheorem 2. The disease-free equilibrium P 0 of the system (14)- (20) is locally asymptotically stable when R 2 < 1 and R 1 < 1.\n\nProof. The characterist ic equation , determined form the Jacobian matrix evaluated at P 0 , is a seventh order polynomial which we can write in the form\n\nwhere the cubic coefficients are given by\n\nThe disease-free equilibrium will be locally asymptotic ally stable when all eigenvalues k i have negative real part. The eigenvalue k 1 \u00bc \u00c0X 0 < 0 is easily obtained . All roots of the polynom ial G \u00bc 0 will have negative real part when g 0 > 0; g 2 > 0; g 1 g 2 \u00c0 g 0 > 0:\n\nThe first inequality can only be satisfied when R 2 < 1. The second inequal ity can be written in the form\n\nwhich is automatic ally satisfied when R 2 < 1. Finally , the third inequal ity can be written as\n\nThus, all roots of the cubic G \u00bc 0 will have negative real part when R 2 < 1. Similarly , the roots of the polynom ial F \u00bc 0 will have negative real part when\n\nThe first inequal ity is satisfied only when R 1 < 1. The second inequal ity can be written in the form\n\nwhich is automaticall y satisfied when R 1 < 1 and, finally, the third inequal ity can be written as\n\nThus, the all roots of cubic F \u00bc 0 have negative real part when\n\nAnalytical results for the local stability propertie s of the endemic equilibria are not easily obtained due to the complicated algebraic nature of the characteri stic equation s. For the drug-resistant equilibriu m b P the characteristic equation is Fig. 13 . Existence of equilibria in R1 \u00c0 R2 parameter space. P 0 denotes the diseasefree state, b P denotes the presence of only the drug-resistant strain and P \u00c3 denotes the coexistence of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. Table 1 .\n\nSince 0 < U < 1, all inequalities are satisfied when R 2 > R 1 . The conditions for L \u00bc 0 to have roots with negative real part are \u00f0i\u00de l 0 > 0; \u00f0ii\u00de l 3 > 0; \u00f0iii\u00de L 1 \u00f0R 2 \u00de \u00bc l 2 l 3 \u00c0 l 1 l 4 > 0;\n\n\u00f0iv\u00de L 2 \u00f0R 2 \u00de \u00bc l 1 \u00f0l 2 l 3 \u00c0 l 1 l 4 \u00de \u00c0 l 0 l 2 3 > 0:\n\nIt can be easily shown analytically that (i) and (ii) are always satisfied when R 2 > 1. The other conditions are not so readily analysed and we provide a numerical analysis for the specific case of an influenza virus. Currently, the most widely used antiviral drugs are the neuraminidas e inhibitors oseltamivi r and zanamivir. The emergence of resistance to oseltamivir was documented during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, however, little zanamivi r-resistant cases were detected [41, 43] . All relevant parameter values for influenza are listed in Table 1 . We plot condition s (iii) and (iv) in Fig. 14 and it is clear that both inequalities are satisfied for all R 2 . Thus, we conclude that, for the case of influenza, b P is locally stable when R 2 > R 1 .\n\nThe characterist ic equation corresponding to the endemic equilibrium P \u00c3 is intractabl e to an analytica l analysis. However , based on previous results, we would expect this fixed point to be locally stable for all R 1 > 1 and R 2 < R 1 . To analyse the stability properties we generate a mesh in R 1 \u00c0 R 2 parameter space and then at each point we numerica lly determine the local stability of each equilibrium through examination of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. We indicate stability of P 0 ; b P and P \u00c3 with a cross, circle and triangle respectively and the results are displayed in Figs. 15 and 16. It can be seen that there are three distinct regions: region I where the disease-free equilibrium P 0 is stable, region II where b P is stable and only the drug-resistant strain of the virus is present and region III where P \u00c3 is stable and both the drug-sensitive and drug-resis tant strains of the virus coexist. Similar results have been documented for models of tuberculosis treatment when the latent state is considered [44] [45] [46] in place of an asymptomati c infectious state, which can account for approximately one third of all influenza infections .\n\nIn Fig. 17 (a) we show a solution correspondi ng to region I. Here the disease-free equilibriu m is stable and, following a short initial increase, the virus dies out rapidly. In Fig. 17 (b) we show a solution correspondi ng to region II. The solution initially oscillates around the fixed point b P and approach es it as t ! 1. In Fig. 17 (c) we show a solution correspondi ng to region III. Again, after some initial oscillatory behaviour the solution approaches P \u00c3 . Finally, for complete ness, we also consider the upper portion of region III where both endemic equilibria exist (see Fig. 13 ). A solution corresponding to this region is shown in Fig. 17 (d) . Both endemic equilibria exist and the solution approaches the stable equilibrium P \u00c3 .\n\nWhen a novel influenza virus emerges, the delay in deliverin g a strain-specific vaccine requires preparednes s plans to reply on other containmen t strategies. The sole pharmaceutical measure available to public health authoriti es to alleviate the pandemic impact is the use of antiviral drugs for therapeutic or prophyla ctic use. It is possible that health systems would have to reply on these stabl\u00ea P stable * P stable 0 P III II I Fig. 16 . Stability of equilibria in R1 \u00c0 R2 parameter space. P 0 denotes the diseasefree state, b P denotes the presence of only the drug-resistant strain and P \u00c3 denotes the coexistence of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. drugs for several months while a vaccine is developed and, thus, their timely availability in sufficient quantities to meet international requirements would be crucial. Such a demand could only be met if the drugs were stockpiled in advance of a pandemic [47, 48] . If a highly virulent drug-resis tant strain were to emerge the economic impact of losing valuable stockpile s would further devastate already overburdened health systems. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of the emergence of drug resistance is an important topic in the preparation for future pandemic outbreaks. It has been shown that widespread use of antiviral drugs should be avoided during a pandemic, except in the case of high reproduction number, to prevent a more virulent drug-resis tant strain developing [49] . This theory is supported by our findings. The existence and stability of the two strains are complete ly determined by the valu es of the re pr odu cti on numb er s R 1 and R 2 . Th e gre ate r the reproduction number of the drug-sensitive strain the greater the reproduction number required by the drug-resistant strain to become endemic in the population. If the reproduction number of the sensitive strain is close to 1 then a lower value of R 2 can allow the drug-resistant strain to become endemic .\n\nA mathematical elaborati on of some dynamic features of an epidemiological model that explicitly considers asymptom atic infectious cases and loss of immunity, together with the associate d model that accounts for treatment and the development of drug resistance was presente d in this paper. It was shown that the dynamics of the simple model without intervention are entirely determined by the basic reproduction number R 0 , with the disease becoming endemic when R 0 > 1 and dying out when R 0 < 1. In addition, it was demonstrated that the long-term dynamics are characterised by damped oscillatio ns approaching an endemic state, whose period of oscillation is greatly influenced by the rate at which infection acquired immunity is lost. A comparison was provided between this model and another commonly used model in which the preclinical infectious state is absent. It was shown that, for the general model, two unique transmis sion rates are obtained. For the specific case of influenza the transmission rates are equal, however, the models still predict quantitat ively different disease incidence. By considering a simple public health intervention, where the easily identifiable symptomati c cases are isolated from the general population, it was shown that, under certain conditions, neglecting the preclinical state could underestimate the peak incidence and the resultant burden on public health systems during an epidemic. Better estimate s for the duration of preclinical viral shedding could help to provide more accurate estimates for the impact of pre-symptomatic influenza transmission. We emphasis that the two models considered here cannot be directly compared and we merely present the two approach es and highlight their similarities and differences.\n\nAn interesting result could also be derived from this analysis regarding the stability of the model when treatment and the development of drug resistance are considered. In addition to the locally stable disease free equilibrium, two other endemic equilibria were identified. The first corresponds to the presence of the resistant strain when R 2 > 1 and, for influenza parameter values, is locally stable when R 2 > R 1 . The second correspond s to the co-circulation of both the drug-sensitive and resistant strains when R 1 > 1 and R 2 < R 1 . Elaborati on of the second endemic equilibrium is mathematically intractable. However, a graphical analysis of the stability properties, in the case of influenza, indicates that it is always locally stable. We note, however, that the effects of back-mu tation from resistant to sensitive strains was neglected. This might possibly occur when the resistant strain carries a cost and is the reason underlying the fact that there is an equilibrium where only the resistant strain is present and no equilibrium with only the sensitive strain."}
