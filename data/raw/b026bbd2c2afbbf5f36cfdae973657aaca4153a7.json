This assumption should be regarded as speculative, since 170 .

We have selected these three data sets to illustrate that the evolution of the epidemic has a 204 local flavor that mainly depends on the number of initial infected persons, the demographic 205 density, and the set of containment measures taken by government officials and society. 206 line should be observed, and the slope of that line denotes the specific rate (\u00b5) of the 212 epidemic spreading. Note that COVID-19 has exhibited a wide range of spreading rates in 213 different countries (from ~0.3 to ~0.9 day -1 ). Note also that \u00b5 is related to the doubling time 214 (t d ), often reported in population and epidemiological studies, by the equation t d =Ln 2/ \u00b5. 215 .

In addition, two 236 localities that experienced similar initial specific epidemic rates may exhibit dramatically Validation and predictions 249 We have run different scenarios to validate the predictive capabilities of our epidemic 250 model for COVID-19. Overall, the model is capable of closely reproducing the progression 251 .

We found that, adapting the model to a particular locality Figure 2A ). Note 296 that his suggest that the measures of social distancing imposed in NYC were equivalent to 297 decrease the effective demographic density to 50%. At the end of March, after this 298 adjustment, our model forecasts a peak of infections of nearly 5,000 new cases per day (less 299 than half than the prediction before social distancing), and a cumulative number of 1 \u00d7 10 6 300 citizens infected. For instance, our results suggest that, for an urban area such as NYC, imposing measures 322 that guarantee a social distance equivalent to a decrease in demographic density of 50% 323 will delay the peak of maximum number of infections by 25 days and will decrease its 324 intensity from 23000 to 9000 new cases of infection per day. In turn, this implies a lower 325 demand for hospital beds per day during the epidemics and may mark the difference 326 between a manageable crisis and a public health catastrophe 5,30 . 327 .

In prospective, the total number of beds in the Mexican public health 377 sector is estimated in 20,000 (for the whole country). 378 379 Concluding remarks 380 We used a set of differential equations, recent epidemiological data regarding the evolution 381 of COVID-19 infection in a reduced set of regions (i.e., Spain, Iran, and NYC), and basic 382 information on the characteristics of COVID-19 infection (i.e., time from infection to 383 recovery, case mortality rate) to accurately recreate the onset of the COVID-19 in two 384 urban areas with different demographic characteristics (i.e., NYC and Monterrey, M\u00e9xico). 385\n\nWe showed that the model can be adapted to closely follow the evolution of COVID-19 in 386 densely populated urban areas by simply adjusting two parameters related to (a) population 387 density and (b) aggressiveness of the response from a society/government to epidemics. 388\n\nScenarios such as those currently unfolding in Iran, Italy, or Spain emphasize the 389 importance of planning ahead during epidemic events. The availability of a simple model 390 may be highly enabling for local governments, physicians, civil organizations, and citizens 391 as they struggle in their endeavor to accurately forecast the progression of an epidemic and 392 formulate a plan of action. As previously stated, the use of simple/user-friendly models to 393 evaluate in (practically) real time the effectiveness of containment strategies or programs 394 may be a powerful tool for analyzing and facing epidemic events 6,12 .
