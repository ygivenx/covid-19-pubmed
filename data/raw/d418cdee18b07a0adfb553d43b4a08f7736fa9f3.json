This problem is underscored by autopsy studies showing that previously undetected pulmonary pathogens may contribute to death in 30% of HCT recipients (3, 4) . Despite this, the etiologic pathogens remain unidentified in most cases of LRTI, due largely to the limitations of current microbiologic tests in terms of sensitivity, speed and breadth of assay targets (5) .\n\nDiagnosis of LRTI in HCT recipients is particularly challenging due to high rates of noninfectious inflammatory conditions such as graft versus host disease (GVHD) that can drive pulmonary inflammation, induce fever and mimic infection (6). Furthermore, the diagnostic yield of traditional tests is reduced in HCT patients due to antimicrobial prophylaxis, reduced antibody titers, and infections from uncommon opportunistic microorganisms (7) .\n\nThe limitations of current microbiologic tests drive excessive use of empiric broadspectrum antimicrobials, which potentiates the emergence of drug resistance and increases risk of Clostridium difficile infection (8) . In some situations, empiric regimens may lack activity against an underlying microbe, leading to treatment failure, disease progression, and consequent adverse outcomes (5, 9) . Furthermore, in transplant patients, concern for GVHD may compel clinicians to initiate empiric immunosuppressive agents that could inadvertently exacerbate disease in the presence of an unrecognized infection (10) .\n\nPreviously, microarray approaches proved useful for broadening the scope of pathogens detectable in a single LRTI assay; some microarrays have even incorporated conserved sequences from all known viruses, allowing detection of novel viral strains (11) . Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) inherently offers enhanced diagnostic capabilities by providing a culture-independent, comprehensive measurement of the microbial composition of clinical samples (12, 13) . This technology permits the simultaneous detection of bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens without introducing bias associated with fixed-target PCR or serologic All rights reserved.

By capturing both microbial and human RNA, mNGS also permits simultaneous transcriptional profiling of the host immunologic response, which can provide complementary insight regarding the presence and type of infection (15, 16) . Due to the clear need for enhanced respiratory pathogen diagnostics in HCT recipients, we undertook this study examining the utility of host/pathogen mNGS for detection of LRTI pathogens in HCT patients hospitalized with acute respiratory illnesses.\n\nThis retrospective study evaluated sequentially enrolled adult HCT recipients who underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at the University of Michigan Medical Center between January 25 th , 2012 and May 20 th , 2013. All patients met established clinical definitions of community-acquired or hospital-acquired pneumonia and had two or more of the following: cough, fever, chills, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, crackles, or bronchial breathing; in addition, an opacity, infiltrate or nodules on chest radiograph was required (17) (18) (19) \n\nTotal nucleic acid was extracted from 250\u00b5l of patient BAL fluid using bead-based lysis and the Zymo Viral DNA/RNA Kit (Zymo Research). RNA and DNA were isolated separately using DNAse or RNAse, respectively, and the former was reverse transcribed to generate complementary DNA (cDNA). DNA and cDNA then underwent adapter addition and barcoding using the Nextera system (Illumina). Depletion of abundant sequences by hybridization (DASH) was employed to selectively deplete human mitochondrial cDNA, thus enriching for microbial transcripts (20) . The final RNAseq and DNA sequencing (DNAseq) libraries underwent 135 nucleotide paired-end Illumina sequencing. Methodology is described further in the online data supplement.\n\nDetection of microbial pathogens leveraged a custom bioinformatics pipeline to discriminate pathogens from background microbial sequences in clinical samples. This methodology is detailed in the Online Data Supplement (21) . Briefly, this analytical approach involved first filtering for quality and complexity, next extracting sequences aligning to the human and Pan troglodytes genomes (NCBI GRC h38 and UCSC PanTro4) using STAR (22) and then subsequently removing reads aligning to non-fungal eukaryotes and phage using All rights reserved.

The identities of the remaining reads were determined by querying the NCBI nucleotide (nt) and non-redundant protein (nr) databases using GSNAP-L.\n\nTo mitigate spurious taxonomic assignments due to laboratory background contaminants, we calculated a standard Z-score for each microbial genus relative to a control group of 17 \"no-template\" water-only controls (detailed in Table E1 ) derived from sequencing runs performed in our laboratory over the past 2 years (24). Z-scores were calculated based on unique reads aligned to either NCBI nt or nr, per million sequence input reads (rpM nt , rpM nr ).\n\nThe respiratory tract is not a sterile environment, and as such, we devised a ranking score to aid in the stratification of the inherently complex alignment data. This metric involved multiplying the number of reads aligned per million reads sequenced by the sum of the nt and nr Z-scores for each microbial genus identified in each patient: score = rpM nt x (Z nt + Z nr ). To further improve the specificity of microbial assignments, we required 1) microbes to be detected in both nucleotide (nt) and protein (nr) database alignments; 2) microbes to have a Z nt and Z nr > zero and 3) bacteria and fungi detected by RNAseq to also have detectable genomic sequence by DNAseq. In addition, we permitted DNA viruses to be detected on only DNAseq and RNA viruses to be detected on only RNAseq. For each patient, any microbes that passed these requirements were then processed using the following decision tree, summarized in Figure 1 .\n\nMicrobes were considered confirmed pathogens if a) both clinical testing and mNGS identified the microbe, b) there existed literature evidence of microbial pathogenicity in the lungs, and c) the microbe score was as least two-fold greater than that of any other microbe of the same type (virus, bacteria or fungus) identified in the patient (17) . Microbes were considered new potential pathogens if a) mNGS alone identified the microbe, b) there existed literature evidence of microbial pathogenicity in the lungs, and c) the microbe score was two-fold greater than any other microbe of the same type (virus, bacteria or fungus) in the patient.

Finally, microbes were considered unlikely or uncertain pathogens if they a) lacked robust literature evidence of microbial pathogenicity in the lungs, b) had a score that was less than two-fold that of the top-ranking microbe, suggesting a polymicrobial sample, c) determined to be clinically insignificant by the treatment team, or d) were a DNA virus of uncertain pathogenicity present in low abundance (< 5rpM).\n\nAlpha diversity of the respiratory microbiome in each subject was assessed using the Simpson Diversity Index (SDI) and compared between patients with a) confirmed pathogens, b) unlikely or uncertain pathogens and c) new potential pathogens using the nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (25) .\n\nRNA transcripts aligning to the human genome were captured by our computational pipeline as described above. Cumulative sum scaling normalization of protein-coding gene transcripts was carried out (26) and genes expressed in fewer than 30% of samples, or as outliers in only 10% of samples, were removed. Using a supervised approach, pathways related to immune functionality were selected a priori from the Molecular Signatures Database (27) and compared in terms of total normalized expression between subjects using the nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test as described in the online data supplement. These pathways contained gene biomarkers associated with antiviral response, interferons \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, IL-6/JAK/STAT5 signaling and adaptive immunity, and have all been strongly associated with the immune response to infection (28, 29) .\n\nAll rights reserved.

Their most common transplant indications were leukemia (n=12) and lymphoma (n=8). The majority of patients received allogeneic HCT (n=20) and/or myeloablative conditioning (n=20), as summarized in Table E2 . The median absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at the time of BAL was 3.8/\u00b5L (IQR 2.1- \n\nAll study subjects received antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to symptom onset and bronchoscopy. Empiric broad spectrum antibiotics were used in 16 of the 22 (73%) patients including vancomycin (n=4), cefepime (n=4), vancomycin + cefepime (n=5), cefepime + tobramycin (n=1), and vancomycin + cefepime + tobramycin (n=1) ( Table 1) . Pathogen-targeted antimicrobials were used in three subjects (14%). Four patients (15%) received no antimicrobials aside from pre-existing prophylactic agents. All rights reserved.

These included HMPV (n=2), RSV (n=2), HHV-6 (n=1) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=1). CMV was identified by shell vial culture in subject 37 but thought to represent incidental carriage because of symptom resolution in the absence of intervention prior to the return of testing.\n\nAn average of 49 million paired-end sequencing reads were generated from each BAL sample, of which <1% were microbial. Sequencing statistics and pipeline output for each patient are described in Table E3 . mNGS identified all seven microbes found by standard clinical diagnostics, demonstrating 100% sensitivity for pathogen detection. In total, RNAseq identified 10 RNA viruses, all of which have established pathogenicity in the lungs, and the RNA intermediates of five DNA viruses that have uncertain pulmonary pathogenicity. DNAseq identified the genomes of these same five DNA viruses as well as five others including CMV and HHV-6, which have been associated with pneumonitis. mNGS captured entire viral genomes for five patients at an average read depth of 3500-fold, as shown in Figure E1 . Bacteria known to exist contextually as either pathogens or commensals, including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus mitis, and Corynebacterium propinquum were identified, as were genera not typically considered pathogenic (30) (31) (32) . Specificity of mNGS could not be assessed because this cohort lacked patients with proven non-infectious respiratory illnesses.\n\nLoss of diversity within respiratory tract microbial communities has been proposed as an ecological marker of infection (33, 34) . We thus evaluated alpha diversity of actively replicating All rights reserved.

Reduced diversity was also observed if subjects with confirmed or potential new pathogens were compared together against those without (0.41, IQR 0.20-0.55, n=12 vs. 0.92, IQR 0.86-0.93, n=10, p<0.001).\n\nWe hypothesized that gene expression from respiratory fluids obtained at the site of infection would distinguish patients with LRTI from those with non-infectious respiratory diseases. To test this idea, we evaluated a priori selected gene biomarkers of innate and adaptive immune responses using the total normalized expression of all genes. Given suspected between-subject immunologic response heterogeneity due to differences in infection type and degree of immunologic compromise, we created a composite metric based on the sum normalized gene expression of all biomarkers. We found significantly increased expression in patients with confirmed LRTI pathogens versus those without (94.9, IQR 93.8-105.6, n=6 vs. All rights reserved.

When benchmarked against the conventional standard of care testing performed during the time of study enrollment, mNGS demonstrated 100% sensitivity for microbial detection and permitted identification of potential new viral and bacterial pathogens in six of 15 (40%) subjects with otherwise negative testing. We observed that the presence of respiratory pathogens was characterized by increased expression of host immune response genes and lower airway microbial diversity. Our results suggest that simultaneous mNGS detection of respiratory pathogens, the host's immunologic response and the airway microbiome may provide complementary data that could inform the clinical significance of a detected pathogen.\n\nAmongst the cases with negative clinical testing, mNGS identified six patients harboring transcriptionally active microbes with recognized respiratory pathogenicity (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) . With respect to viruses, HCOV-229E was identified in two patients and HRV-A was identified in three patients, one of whom was also culture-positive for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Notably, HRV and HCOV were not represented on the multiplex PCR panel used at the study hospital; similar limited panels are still in use at many hospitals today. Unlike rapid antigen or multiplex PCR assays, mNGS is not limited to a fixed number of pre-specified targets on a panel, obviating the need to order multiple independent diagnostic tests. Furthermore, mNGS can detect entire viral genomes, as illustrated in Figure E1 , an attribute that can enable genotyping, detection of resistance mutations, and epidemiologic tracking of disease outbreaks (41).\n\nWith respect to previously unidentified bacterial pathogens, mNGS detected Streptococcus mitis, an oropharyngeal microbe known to cause bacteremia and acute respiratory distress in HCT recipients, as a potential pulmonary pathogen in one patient (40, 42) . Corynebacterium propriniquum, one of the few virulent Corynebacterium species associated with LRTI, comprised the majority of microbial transcripts in another subject's BAL All rights reserved.

Both patients received empiric vancomycin, which has activity against Streptococcus and Corynebacteria spp., and recovered from their acute respiratory illnesses. Findings were independently confirmed at the genus level by 16s rRNA gene sequencing.\n\nTen patients with negative conventional testing were found to have microbes of unlikely or uncertain pathogenicity. Notably, each of these patients had potential alternative explanations for their respiratory symptoms. While one of these patients had bacteremia/sepsis, the remaining nine had acute and/or chronic GVHD, underlining the importance of non-infectious alloreactive inflammation in post-HCT pulmonary complications. mNGS identified several viruses with DNA genomes, however only five of these also had well-defined evidence of active replication marked by detectable RNA transcripts (HSV, human papilloma virus and torque teno viruses (TTV, n=3). TTV was the most commonly detected DNA virus, a finding consistent with prior reports demonstrating an increased prevalence of this presumptively innocuous constituent of the human virome in immunosuppressed patients (44) .\n\nHerpesviridae genomic DNA in the absence of viral transcripts was identified in five patients and included HHV-6 (n=1), CMV (n=2), HSV (n=1) and EBV (n=1). One subject, who died 10 days post-BAL due to relapsed lymphoma, had EBV DNA detected in the setting of EBV viremia. WU polyoma virus was detected by DNA sequencing another case, and while this virus has been associated with respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients, evidence supporting its role as a pathogen is lacking (45) .\n\nCMV was identified by both viral culture and mNGS in one subject, however this finding was considered unrelated to the patient's respiratory illness by the treating physicians. Notably, while CMV was detected by DNAseq, no RNA transcripts were identified, suggesting that it may have represented incidental carriage as opposed to a transcriptionally active pathogen (46) . This patient was also found to harbor Pseudomonas fluorescens, a described colonizer of the human respiratory tract (47) , as well as several other taxa representing common constituents of All rights reserved.

Our findings suggest that respiratory tract microbial diversity may be such a biomarker. Specifically, we found that patients with LRTI pathogens had significantly lower alpha diversity versus those without (p=0.017, Figure 2 , Table E5 ), presumably reflecting dominance of actively replicating pathogens (33, 34) .\n\nOur results also demonstrate that both mNGS and conventional methods identify clinically significant and insignificant microbes, and emphasize the need to assess the impact of a given microbiologic finding in the context of a patient's immunologic response (5) . Expression of a multi-gene immune response metric was significantly increased in patients with confirmed respiratory pathogens relative to those without, suggesting that despite significant and heterogeneous states of immune suppression, HCT recipients still exhibited immunologic biomarkers of active infection (p=0.022, Figure 3 ).\n\nAmongst subjects with potential new pathogens, we observed that two of the three HRV-A positive subjects demonstrated the lowest expression of this immune response metric, while the remaining subject, who was co-infected with HRV-A and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, had one of the highest values. This is consistent with prior reports demonstrating that HRV can induce a broad range of clinical disease severity, and that viral-bacterial co-infection can increase the severity of disease (48, 49) . Amongst subjects with confirmed pathogens, the patient with clinically suspected HHV-6 pneumonitis was notably an outlier in terms of reduced immune metric expression and elevated airway diversity.

For instance, patient 1, whose conventional testing While these results are highly encouraging, this proof-of-concept study suggests many routes for further improvement. First, this study was limited by a relatively small sample size, only one case of culture-positive bacterial LRTI, no fungal infections, and no subjects with clinically diagnosed non-infectious airway diseases. Future studies with larger cohorts will be needed to validate the sensitivity and specificity of mNGS for LRTI diagnosis in this population.\n\nSecond, our limited sequencing depth did not yield the human transcriptome coverage that would be desired for robust differential gene expression analyses, although we were able to rigorously evaluate a composite metric of immunity genes. Future larger studies are needed to identify and validate gene classifiers that can distinguish LRTI from non-infectious airway diseases in HCT recipients.\n\nHere we leverage continued improvements in metagenomic sequencing to expand the capabilities of LRTI diagnostics in HCT recipients with acute respiratory illnesses. We demonstrate that compared to current microbial diagnostics, mNGS has a greater capacity for detecting microbes and an ability to couple pathogen detection with simultaneous profiling of the All rights reserved.
