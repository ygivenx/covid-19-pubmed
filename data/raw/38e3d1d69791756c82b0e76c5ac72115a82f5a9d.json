{"title": "A Machine Learning Model Reveals Older Age and Delayed Hospitalization as Predictors of Mortality in Patients with COVID-19", "body": "The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused unprecedented morbidity and mortality in almost all the continents (1) . Despite implementations of extensive control measures, spread of the disease and eventual fatality could not be effectively halted till date. The major cause of death in COVID-19 is due to virus-induced pneumonia leading to respiratory failure (2) . Epidemiological evidence suggests that older age and the associated co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes put patients at higher risk of mortality (3) . Thus identification of novel risk factors predictive for patients' outcome including mortality is needed.\n\nHere using the publicly available clinical data from Kaggle, we have employed a machine learning tool to identify the risk factors that could potentially contribute to the mortality of COVID-19 patients from 22 countries in 4 continents. We show that older age and delayed hospitalisation of symptomatic patients are the two major risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe dataset was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novelcorona-virus-2019-dataset#COVID19_line_list_data.csv) on 23 rd March, 2020. It contained a total of 1085 reported cases of COVID-19 from 13 th January to 28 th February, 2020. Missing values were removed for all the variables to obtain a dataset of 433 individuals. 3 cases were filtered out from the dataset as the date of hospital visit preceded the date of symptom onset for them. Among the 430 cases selected finally from 22 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe and All rights reserved.

The descriptive statistics of the deaths and confirmed recovered cases have been depicted in Table 1 .\n\nRandom Forest classification algorithm (4) was implemented over a dataset with 37 deaths and 78 recoveries using the randomForest package in R. The dataset was randomly split into training and test dataset containing 70% and 30% of the total samples respectively. To evaluate the model performance, the Area under the ROC curve was calculated on the test dataset. A variable importance plot was generated using the importance of the predictors over the outcome. The importance of the variables has been reported according to both the mean decrease of Gini and the mean decrease of Accuracy. The partial dependency plots were finally generated using the pdp package in R to determine the marginal effect of the Age and Time to Hospitalization over the fate of COVID-19 infection.\n\nThe descriptive summary of the data has been represented by mean and standard deviation (SD). The numerical variables have been compared between groups by independentsamples two-sided Student's t-test. The categorical variables have been tested using Chi-square test. All the statistical analyses were performed in RStudio (Version 1. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043331 doi: medRxiv preprint (AUROC) curve during validation on the test dataset. The AUROC on the test dataset was found to be 0.97. Age was the most important variable in the model for predicting the fate which was interestingly followed by the time gap between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization. The importance of the variables in terms of Mean Decrease in Accuracy and Mean Decrease in Gini are graphically shown in Figure 2 (A, B) .\n\nIn order to inspect the marginal effect of the predictors over the mortality of patients with COVID-19, we generated the partial dependency plots for the odds of Death among COVID-19 patients with Age and Days from the onset of symptoms to hospitalisation. As shown in Figure 2 (C, D), accentuation in odds of death was found with age beyond 62 years as well as beyond a time gap of 2 days between the onset of symptoms to hospitalisation. Taken together, our analysis identifies older age (\uf03e62 years) and delayed hospitalisation as the two most important predictors of mortality among patients with COVID-19.\n\nMortality of critically ill patients of COVID-19 is high and co-morbidities including hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease are often present in hospitalised patients.\n\nThough 48% of the non-survivors had a co-morbid disease, in multivariate analyses, independent associations of in-hospital death were found to be present with older age, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and elevated d-dimer levels (6) . Another study has also identified older patients as a high risk group for mortality (7) . In agreement with previously published studies, our analysis also identified Age to be the most important risk factor for mortality among COVID-19 patients. However, the role of delayed hospitalisation following the development of symptoms as another significant risk factor for mortality among COVID-19 patients (after Age) is being reported for the first time. The inadequacy of healthcare resources has already been reported to associate with increased mortality among COVID-19 patients (8) .\n\nAll rights reserved.
