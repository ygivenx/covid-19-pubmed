Cells were maintained at 6 9 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 .\n\nPurification of antibody 7 1 The hybridoma for mAb 1A9 was previously generated [19] . All mAbs were purified 7 2 from cell culture supernatant using a HiTrap protein G HP affinity column (GE 7 3 Healthcare) and stored at -80 \u00b0C. The purity of the mAb was confirmed by sodium 7 4 dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE) analysis. The 7 5 concentration of the purified mAb was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein 7 6 assay reagent (Thermo Scientific). 7 7 Transient transfection and western blot analysis 7 8 COS-7 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates 24 hours prior to the transient transfection 7 9 using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's 8 0 protocol. SARS-CoV-2 S-expressing plasmids were codon-optimized and generated by 8 1 gene synthesis (Bio Basic Asia Pacific) according to GenBank accession QHD43416.1. 8 2 One plasmid is for expressing full-length S while the other is for expressing a fragment 8 3 consisting of residues 1048-1206. At 48 hours post-transfection, cells were harvested, 8 4 spun down by centrifugation and washed with cold PBS twice. Cells were then 8 5 resuspended in RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 0.5% 8 6 deoxycholic acid, 0.005% SDS and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] and subjected 8 7 to five freeze-thaw cycles. Clarified supernatant containing the protein of interest was 8 8 obtained by spinning down the cell lysate at 13,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C to remove the cell debris 8 9 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The membrane was blocked in 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered 9 2 saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature and incubated with 9 3 primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C overnight. After the membrane was washed with TBST, it was 9 4 incubated with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific) at room 9 5 temperature for 1 hour. The membrane was then washed with TBST again and detected 9 6 with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Scientific). 9 7 Transient transfection and immunofluorescence analysis 9 8 For immunofluorescence (IF) analysis, COS-7 cells on glass coverslips were transfected 9 9 as above and fixed at 24 hours post-transfection in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at iPC objective lens and Olympus DP27 colour camera with Olympus cellSens software.

A 1 2 5 multiple sequence alignment was created with MAFFT using the slow but accurate L- INS-I parameter settings [21] and the alignment curated, cut to the target region 1029- 1192 (SARS-CoV numbering) and visualized with Jalview [22] . We used Mega X [23] to 1 2 8 calculate the number of amino acid differences for all sequence pairs in the alignment of the mAb target region ( Figure 1B ) and the full S protein ( Figure 1C ) normalized by the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.980037 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nTo determine within-outbreak sequence diversity in the spike glycoprotein, 230 human mutations were counted and tabulated using a custom Perl script (Supplementary Table 2 ). 1 4 4 By using five different fragments of SARS-CoV S to immunize rabbits, a fragment 1 4 5 corresponding to residues 1029 to 1192 was found to stimulate neutralizing antibodies 1 4 6 against SARS-CoV [24] . Interestingly, sequence alignment shows that this domain, 1 4 7 which encompasses the heptad repeat (HR) 2 but not HR1, is highly conserved in SARS- 1 4 8 CoV-2 ( Figure 1A ). When compared with additional reference sequences from bat 1 4 9 RaTG13 (closest bat precursor), MERS and human common cold coronaviruses 229E,\n\n1 4 3\n\nNL63, OC43 and HKU1 ( Figure 1A) , it becomes apparent that the amino acid identity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is much higher in this region (93%, Figure 1B than over the full protein length (78%, Figure 1C ) and the similarity drops sharply (<40% 1 5 3 author/funder.

As shown in Figure 3 , all 4 mAbs bound to the full-length 1 7 8 S protein of SARS-CoV-2. 1 8 1 Since mAb 1A9 was previously shown to have broad cross-reactivity to civet SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV strains [20] , it was tested on SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero-E6 cells. As shown in Figure 4 , mAb 1A9 stained a significant number of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells Numerous mAbs against the S protein of SARS-CoV have been generated for research 1 8 9 and diagnostic assay development. Some of these may be able to cross-react with the S 1 9 0 protein of SARS-CoV-2 and serve as tools to aid research on this newly emerged virus. 1 1 useful for studying the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and development of 1 9 8 diagnostic assays for COVID-19. It is noteworthy that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) 1 9 9 epitopes also reside at residues 884-891 and 1116-1123 within the S2 subunit of SARS-\n\nCoV [26] . Interestingly, the latter CTL epitope overlaps with the epitope recognized by 2 0 1 mAb 1A9 [20] . Hence, the S2 subunit may serve as an important antigen for inducing 2 0 2 both humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 as a receptor for viral entry [3, 10] , several SARS-CoV RBD-directed mAbs did 2 0 6 not cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD [27, 28] . Interestingly, CR3022, which was 2 0 7 isolated from a SARS convalescent patient, showed cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 2 0 8 RBD and recognizes an epitope that does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site [28] . To CoV [29] [30] [31] . Thus, it will be important to determine if these mAbs can also cross-react with SARS-CoV-2.
