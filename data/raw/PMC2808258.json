Human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) was propagated as\n                            described previously (33) and\n                            purified using a ViraBind adenovirus purification kit (Cellbiolabs). The\n                            HeLa cell line stably expressing GFP-tagged ribosomal protein RPL27 has\n                            been reported elsewhere (34). For\n                            microscopy, HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well\n                        dishes.\n\nIsolation of purified nucleoli from uninfected and infected cells was\n                            performed as described previously (29). For both SILAC and standard 2D gel analysis, 108\n                            HeLa cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5\n                            with Ad5 and harvested at 18 h postinfection.\n\nFor SILAC analysis, prior to infection cells were grown for five rounds\n                            of cell division in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium\n                            containing\n                                l-[13C6,15N4]arginine\n                            and\n                                l-[13C6,15N2]lysine\n                            (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) supplemented with 10%\n                            dialyzed fetal calf serum (Biowest) to ensure all the cellular proteins\n                            were labeled to saturation. Prior to nucleolar isolation, equal numbers\n                            of uninfected, unlabeled cells and Ad5-infected, labeled cells were\n                            mixed. Nucleoli were then isolated from the mixed cell populations using\n                            a standard protocol (35).\n                            Nucleoli were lysed by heating in lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer\n                            (Invitrogen), and nucleolar proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a\n                            4\u201312% precast gradient gel (Invitrogen). The gel\n                            was fixed, stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Invitrogen), and cut\n                            into six slices.\n\nPeptides were isolated from each gel slice after in-gel digestion,\n                            desalted, and concentrated as described previously (32); separated by HPLC (Agilent) on\n                            a C18 reverse phase column; and analyzed by a QSTAR XL hybrid\n                            quadrupole TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The peak lists\n                            were generated by the Analyst QS software, version 1.1 (Applied\n                            Biosystems). The MS data were searched against the NCBInr database\n                            (February 19, 2006 release, 3,230,559 sequences searched) for\n                                Homo sapiens using the MASCOT search engine,\n                            version 1.9 (Matrix Science). Variable modifications used were\n                            carboxymethyl (Cys), oxidation (Met) and phospho (Ser, Thr, and Tyr) as\n                            well as the appropriate SILAC modifications. Trypsin specificity was\n                            used, two missed cleavages were allowed, and a mass tolerance of 0.5 Da\n                            was used for both precursor and fragment ions. Peptide charges of\n                            +1, +2, and +3 were selected.\n                            Individual ions with MASCOT scores higher than 20 were used, making sure\n                            the \u201caverage peptide scores\u201d of all identified\n                            proteins exceeded 20, a threshold commonly used for confident protein\n                            identification from tandem MS data (36). Only bold red peptides were also considered, effectively\n                            removed duplicate homologous proteins from the results. Under these\n                            conditions, the estimated false positive rate is less than\n                            5%, according to a previous analysis (37). SILAC quantitation was done by the MSQuant\n                            software, which measures the averaged MS peak areas of the isotopic\n                            pairs. Only proteins with bold red peptides and combined scores higher\n                            than 50 were quantitated. Proteins with heavy/light isotopic ratios\n                            lower than 0.01 were discarded; they mostly represented environmental\n                            contaminants. The S.D. of a protein ratio represented the variations\n                            among the measured peptide ratios for the same protein. Functional\n                            classification of the identified proteins was performed using\n                            Proteincenter (Proxeon). The biological reproducibility was addressed by\n                            a parallel 2D gel-based approach and by microscopy analysis (see\n                        below).\n\nNucleolar pellets were resuspended in 450 \u03bcl of 7 m\n                            urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.002%\n                            bromphenol blue, 0.5% (v/v) IPG buffer, pH 3\u201311\n                            non-linear (GE Healthcare), and 1.2% (v/v) Destreak reagent\n                            (GE Healthcare) and loaded onto 24-cm Immobiline DryStrip gels (pH\n                            3\u201311 non-linear) by passive rehydration for a minimum of 12\n                            h. Following rehydration, the DryStrip gels were transferred to an Ettan\n                            IPGPhor 3 system (GE Healthcare), and isoelectric focusing was performed\n                            by applying 500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h, and 8000 V for 10.5 h until a\n                            total of 64,000 V-h had been achieved. Following isoelectric focusing,\n                            strips were equilibrated in SDS equilibration buffer (50 mm\n                            Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol,\n                            2% (w/v) SDS, and 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue)\n                            containing 1% (w/v) DTT for 15 min at room temperature\n                            followed by a further incubation in fresh SDS equilibration buffer\n                            containing 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide for 15 min at room\n                            temperature. Strips were then applied to 12.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE\n                            gels and run at 5 mA/gel for 1 h, 8 mA/gel for an additional hour, and\n                            then at 20 watts/gel until completion using an Ettan DALT-6 separation\n                            unit (GE Healthcare). Gels were fixed for 1 h in 50% methanol\n                            and 10% acetic acid and stained overnight using SYPRO Ruby\n                            total protein stain (Invitrogen). Following destaining in 10%\n                            methanol and 7% acetic acid, the gels were imaged using a\n                            Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare).\n\nSelected protein spots were cut from the gel using the Investigator\n                            ProPic automated 2D spot picking robot and digested with trypsin using\n                            the ProGest automated digestion unit (both from PerkinElmer Life\n                            Sciences).\n\nMass spectra were recorded in positive ion reflector mode on an Applied\n                            Biosystems 4700 MALDI mass spectrometer. The instrument was calibrated\n                            before each run using the 4700 Calibration Mix 1 (Applied Biosystems),\n                            and in addition, individual MS spectra were internally calibrated using\n                            tryptic autolytic peaks (if present). MSMS analysis was calibrated on\n                            the fragmentation of Glu-fibrinopeptide. For MSMS analysis, the top five\n                            most intense, non-tryptic precursors were selected for fragmentation by\n                            collision-induced dissociation. Neither base-line subtraction nor\n                            smoothing was applied to recorded spectra.\n\nMS and MSMS data were analyzed, and peak lists generated using GPS\n                            Explorer 3.5 (Applied Biosystems). MS peaks were selected between 800\n                            and 4000 Da and filtered with a signal to noise ratio greater than 15\n                            and to exclude masses derived from trypsin autolysis (842.51, 1006.48,\n                            1045.56, 2211.1, 2283.18, and 2299.18). MSMS peaks were selected on the\n                            basis of a signal to noise ratio greater than 10 over a mass range of 50\n                            to 20 Da below the precursor mass. A peak density filter was used with\n                            no more than 30 peaks per 200 Da and a maximum number of peaks of 65.\n\nData were analyzed using the MASCOT 1.9 search engine (Matrix Science) to\n                            search against the human (148,148 sequences) MSDB protein database\n                            (Release 20063108). Search parameters allowed for one missed tryptic\n                            cleavage site, the carbamidomethylation of cysteine, and the possible\n                            oxidation of methionine; precursor ion mass tolerance was 150 ppm, and\n                            fragment ion mass tolerance was 0.25 Da. All identified proteins have a\n                            MASCOT score greater than 64 (the default MASCOT threshold for such\n                            searches), corresponding to a statistically significant\n                            (p < 0.05) confident identification.\n\nAntisera used were anti-adenovirus protein V (5), anti-DBP (a kind gift from W.

Feitelson; Ref. 40), and\n                            anti-eIF6 (a kind gift from B. Stefano; Ref. 41). The expression plasmids encoding tagged\n                            plasmids were vesicular stomatitis virus-tagged hPOP1 (a kind gift from\n                            G.

Sekiguchi; Ref. 48).\n                            Transfection of tagged plasmid constructs was done using Lipofectamine\n                            2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instructions.\n                            Appropriate secondary antibodies were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 or\n                            Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen).\n\nHeLa cells grown on coverslips were either infected, mock infected,\n                            and/or transfected with expression plasmids encoding tagged proteins as\n                            indicated. At 18 h postinfection, cells were fixed for 5 min with\n                            4% formaldehyde in PBS followed by washing in PBS before\n                            permeabilizing in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After\n                            permeabilization, the cells were washed briefly with PBS before blocking\n                            for 30 min at room temperature in 10% FCS in PBS. The cells\n                            were then incubated with primary antibodies for 60 min, washed, and\n                            incubated with secondary antibodies. Cells were mounted with Vectashield\n                            plus DAPI to visualize the nuclear DNA. Images were taken using a Leica\n                            confocal microscope (TCS-SP2).\n\nThe rate of adenovirus replication depends on the serotype of virus, the\n                            cell type, and the m.o.i. For the prototype strain Ad5, infection of\n                            HeLa cells with a modest m.o.i. of about five infectious particles per\n                            cell results in detectable viral early gene expression by 4 h\n                            postinfection, detectable DNA replication by 10 h postinfection,\n                            production of structural proteins that will form progeny virions by\n                            about 18 h postinfection, and release of infectious particles from about\n                            30 h onward. To ensure the isolation of intact nucleoli, we chose to\n                            examine the composition of the nucleoli at \u223c18 h\n                            postinfection when late structural gene expression would be just\n                            underway in some cells but when active viral replication would be well\n                            underway in virtually all the cells examined (for a review, see Ref.\n                                49).\n\nIn this study, we isolated nucleoli from infected and mock infected HeLa\n                            cells and compared the differences in the isolated proteins by\n                            quantitative proteomics. To test the suitability of this approach, we\n                            infected a HeLa cell line stably expressing a GFP-tagged ribosomal\n                            protein RPL27 (34) with Ad5.\n                            RPL27-GFP was used as a nucleolar marker in live cells and in isolated\n                            nucleoli. At 18 h postinfection, the cells were harvested, and nucleoli\n                            were isolated using a standard protocol (29, 35). As shown in\n                                supplemental Fig. 1, live cell imaging revealed that the\n                            RPL27-GFP signal in the nucleolus of infected cells (supplemental Fig. 1C) was similar to that in untreated\n                            cells (supplemental Fig. 1A). The GFP signals in nucleoli\n                            isolated from untreated (supplemental Fig. 1B and infected (supplemental Fig. 1D) cells were also similar, although\n                            the nucleoli from infected cells appeared slightly larger.\n                            Interestingly, adenovirus infection induced the appearance of RPL27-GFP\n                            in threadlike structures in the nucleoplasm. The significance of the\n                            accumulation of this ribosomal protein in these structures or the\n                            apparent slight enlargement of nucleoli is unknown. The threadlike\n                            GFP-containing structures were not observed in the isolated nucleolar\n                            preparation, suggesting that the preparation was not contaminated with\n                            nucleoplasmic materials and was suitable for future proteomics\n                        analysis.\n\nA total of 351 proteins were quantified by SILAC analysis comparing\n                            virally infected host cell nucleoli to uninfected nucleoli that were\n                            ranked according to whether there appeared to be depletion or enrichment\n                            in the infected cell nucleolus (Fig.\n                            1 and supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Functional classification\n                                (Fig. 1A)\n                            revealed that the distribution of the functional roles of the detected\n                            proteins was similar to that of the previously reported human nucleolar\n                            proteome (29), indicating that\n                            the nucleoli isolated in this study were of purity comparable to the\n                            nucleolar preparations used in our previous proteomics studies.\n                            Interestingly, no viral proteins were detected in the nucleoli of the\n                            virally infected cells using adenoviral genome data in MASCOT searches,\n                            potentially reflecting a lack of abundance at that time point. Fig. 1B shows the\n                            changes in abundance of the detected proteins in isolated nucleoli after\n                            viral infection. Remarkably, a majority of the nucleolar proteins\n                            remained relatively unaffected by viral infection; very few proteins\n                            exhibited significant changes in levels (more than \u00b11-fold).\n                            A closer comparison of the nucleolar responses to viral infection and\n                            with previously reported data (29) on the effects of transcription inhibition by ActD is shown\n                            in Fig. 1C. The\n                            SILAC -fold changes of the nucleolar levels of selected proteins after\n                            viral inhibition and ActD treatment were very different, indicating that\n                            the human nucleolus reacts to these two perturbations in highly distinct\n                            manners. In particular, the effects of viral infection on components of\n                            the rRNA transcription machinery were distinct from the effects of ActD\n                            treatment. The SILAC ratios of ribosomal proteins showed a mild decrease\n                            after viral infection (Fig.\n                                1D), whereas ActD treatment had a\n                            significant impact on a number of ribosomal proteins.\n\nWe next investigated the adenovirus-induced changes on nucleolar\n                            composition. Of the proteins shown to be depleted, UBF was the most\n                            affected in accordance with previous reports (11). Protein B23.1 has also been shown to be\n                            sequestered into viral replication centers (12), and this depletion was also detected by our\n                            high throughput proteomics analysis as an almost 2-fold depletion\n                            compared with uninfected cells. Accordingly, we concentrated on proteins\n                            that, like B23.1 and UBF, showed a 2-fold depletion or enrichment in the\n                            nucleoli of infected cells (Table\n                            I).\n\nWe repeated the isolation of nucleoli from uninfected and infected cells\n                            a further three times at 18 h postinfection. Western blotting confirmed\n                            the purity of the nucleolar fractions (data not shown). The nucleoli\n                            from these experiments were examined using 2D gel analysis, which showed\n                            that only a small number of proteins had clearly altered amounts at this\n                            time point. Fig. 2 shows a typical\n                            pair of gels, and seven proteins showing a change in quantity are\n                            marked. These spots were picked and sequenced as described under\n                            \u201cExperimental Procedures.\u201d Their identities are\n                            listed in Table II.\n\nBecause adenovirus induces significant changes in nuclear structure, it\n                            is possible that the nucleolar isolation protocol no longer reliably\n                            enriches intact nucleoli. Moreover, although many of the proteins\n                            identified could conceivably play a role in adenovirus infection, we\n                            wanted to independently verify any potential changes in the nucleolar\n                            proteome. This would have a further key benefit of prioritizing future\n                            work relating these changes to function. We therefore used a range of\n                            antisera and tagged expression constructs to examine the fate of a\n                            number of proteins identified as being enriched or depleted in the\n                            nucleolus. We concentrated on those proteins for which reagents and\n                            published data on subcellular location were already available so we\n                            could be confident of their locations in uninfected cells. We compared\n                            the location of target antigens relative to adenovirus DBP, a key\n                            component of the adenovirus DNA replication machinery that is expressed\n                            to high levels in the nucleoplasm but not the nucleolus in\n                            virus-infected cells. DBP has a distinct pattern of fluorescence and\n                            well defined localization relative to viral mRNA transcription and\n                                de novo viral DNA synthesis (50). Fig. 3\n                            shows the effects of infection on those proteins apparently depleted\n                            from the nucleolus during viral infection. Two nucleolar antigens, hPOP1\n                            and Nopp140, were clearly depleted from the nucleolus (Fig. 3, A and\n                                B). hPOP1 was sequestered from the nucleolus into a\n                            mottled pattern within the nucleoplasm and was excluded from the\n                            DBP-rich centers (Fig.\n                            3A). Nopp140 protein showed some co-localization\n                            with viral DBP but also significant enrichment in centers adjacent to\n                            DBP, reminiscent of our previously published findings that UBF is\n                            sequestered into regions adjacent to DBP (11). We therefore compared UBF with Nopp140 to\n                            confirm that some Nopp140 is apparently sequestered in a manner similar\n                            to that of UBF (Fig.\n                            3B, bottom row). The next group\n                            of proteins, hnRNPU isoform a, SFPQ, U2AF65, hnRNPA2/B1,\n                            histone H1c, and exportin 5 were not detectable in the nucleolus by\n                            immunofluorescence (Fig. 1,\n                                C, D, E, and\n                                F, top rows). However, they were\n                            consistently detected in the nucleolus using proteomics methods and are\n                            considered components of the nucleolar proteome (51). In adenovirus-infected cells, they all showed\n                            a pattern of exclusion from the DBP-rich replication centers apart from\n                            hnRNPA2/B1, which did not show any striking change in its distribution.\n                            However, we noted that hnRNPU, SFPQ, and U2AF65 were localized adjacent\n                            to DBP-rich centers, whereas histone H1c was clearly distinct and\n                            separated from the DBP-rich centers (Fig.\n                                3G). Exportin 5 was also readily detectable\n                            in the cytoplasm of infected cells but not in uninfected cells (Fig. 3H).\n\nWe also examined the localization of a number of proteins apparently\n                            enriched in the nucleolar fraction during infection (Fig. 4). PP2C\u03b5 is typical\n                            of proteins for which we were unable to detect any consistent change in\n                            distribution in adenovirus-infected cells (Fig. 4A). In a similar manner, we were\n                            unable to detect significant consistent changes in the subcellular\n                            location of C-NAP1 and nucleoporin 210 (data not shown). However, for\n                            PIK3-p87 (Fig. 4B)\n                            and ribosomal protein S15a (Fig.\n                                4C), we did see some enrichment in the\n                            nuclear compartment that could account for the apparent increase in\n                            detection in the nucleolar fractions analyzed.\n\nAs with the SILAC data, we examined using immunofluorescence a number of\n                            candidate proteins identified by 2D gel analysis that were altered in\n                            abundance following infection. Fig.\n                            5 shows that proteins RBM4 (Fig.\n                                5A) and eIF6 (Fig. 5B) were both nucleolar antigens in\n                            uninfected cells. On the other hand, RBM4 was apparently recruited from\n                            the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm but with exclusion from the DBP-rich\n                            centers. However, eIF6 became more diffuse with reduced nucleolar\n                            location but, notably, without specific exclusion from DBP-rich centers.\n\nFor completeness, we tested a protein that did not change its location at\n                            this time point postinfection. Nop132 is a nucleolar antigen that has\n                            not been previously investigated in the context of adenovirus infection.\n                            We used a FLAG-tagged construct to examine its location in uninfected\n                            and infected cells. As can be seen from Fig. 6, Nop132 maintained its apparent nucleolar location\n                            with no detectable depletion from the nucleolus to other compartments.\n\nWe utilized both quantitative MS-based proteomics techniques and more\n                            traditional 2D gel analysis to provide the first detailed analysis of\n                            changes in the human nucleolar proteome after infection with a human\n                            pathogen. These data reveal novel nucleolar antigens that were affected\n                            by adenovirus infection and therefore identify new candidate proteins\n                            that may play either a direct or indirect role in viral infection. In\n                            addition, our data illustrate the benefits offered by confocal\n                            microscopy when assessing proteomics analysis of a subcellular fraction.\n                            We feel this combination of techniques is crucial for several reasons.\n                            First, viral infection may have unsuspected effects on the integrity of\n                            cellular compartments that could affect the fractionation process.\n                            Second, this combination enables targets identified by proteomics\n                            analysis to be prioritized for further in-depth analysis. Finally, a\n                            proportion of the proteins in our SILAC analysis were only identified by\n                            one peptide, and for these proteins further verification is\n                        important.\n\nComparison with the response of the nucleolar proteome after\n                            transcriptional inhibition by ActD treatment (in which the flux of\n                            \u223c500 nucleolar proteins was characterized) was very revealing\n                                (29). Comparison with our\n                            data set showed that the effect of adenovirus infection is very specific\n                            with only a limited range of proteins showing a relative change in\n                            abundance (e.g. compare our Fig. 1B with Fig. 4a of Andersen et al. (29)). For example, although\n                            transcription inhibition by ActD causes depletion of ribosomal proteins\n                            of the 40 S subunit and, to a lesser extent, the 60 S subunit (29), this pattern was not observed\n                            in viral infection (Fig.\n                            1D). This was interesting because adenovirus has\n                            been shown to eventually affect ribosomal RNA export (2). However, our chosen time point\n                            of 18 h postinfection is the earliest time that such defects in rRNA\n                            export can be detected (2). As\n                            such, it is probable that defects in processing or export of ribosomal\n                            proteins may be only just beginning at this time point and are therefore\n                            not yet readily detectable by our methods.\n\nThus, adenovirus infection induces a change in the nucleolar proteome\n                            that is distinct from the classical nucleolar disruption caused either\n                            by transcription inhibition or by other general cellular stresses. Viral\n                            infection in this case induces a much more limited and targeted effect\n                            on the nucleolar proteome. Moreover, the 2D approach reinforces the\n                            observation from SILAC analysis that adenovirus infection does not\n                            induce dramatic changes in the nucleolar proteome at this 18-h\n                            postinfection time point. These observations are important because they\n                            argue against the effects of adenovirus infection on the nucleolus being\n                            a nonspecific consequence of viral damage to the host cell. Further work\n                            will establish how this targeted effect on the nucleolus relates to the\n                            adenovirus replication cycle.\n\nFig. 1C\n                                (top panel) also reinforces the distinct effects of\n                            adenovirus infection compared with ActD treatment. Looking at rRNA\n                            transcription, upon ActD treatment, RNA polymerase I subunits and\n                            accessory transcription factors were similarly depleted from the\n                            nucleolus. However, in virally infected cells, nucleolar levels of the\n                            RNA polymerase subunits and transcription factor UBF were affected\n                            differently (Fig.\n                            1C, bottom panel). This is\n                            consistent with previous observations during adenovirus infection where\n                            UBF was depleted from the nucleolus whereas RNA polymerase I remained\n                            nucleolar as evidenced by immunofluorescence using antibodies specific\n                            for RNA polymerase I, in situ visualization of ongoing\n                            RNA synthesis, and S1 nuclease protection assay of rRNA synthesis\n                            initiation (11). This suggests\n                            that adenovirus induces a specific removal of UBF from the nucleolus,\n                            independently of other components of the rDNA transcription complex.\n                            This gives us confidence that our data reflect genuine changes in the\n                            nucleolar proteome because we know of no other way of inducing this\n                            pattern of changes on the rDNA transcription complex.\n\nThe SILAC data point to depletion of UBF and B23.1 during viral\n                            infection, which reflects previously published data by ourselves and\n                            others that UBF and B23.1 are functionally sequestered upon adenovirus\n                            infection into viral DNA replication centers (11\u201313). Another\n                            example is U2AF65, a splicing factor known to play a role in\n                            splicing of adenovirus transcripts (52, 53). Finally,\n                            exportin 5 is known to export adenovirus VA RNA, competing with cellular\n                            microRNA export and potentially modulating cellular protein expression\n                                (54). The identification of\n                            these proteins by SILAC/MS analysis further validates our approach\n                            because they are all well established functional partners in adenovirus\n                            infection. This gives us confidence that some, if not all, of the novel\n                            proteins examined here by microscopy will prove to have functional\n                            relevance to adenoviral infection.\n\nOf those proteins examined that show a clear nucleolar localization in\n                            uninfected cells, all had a dramatic redistribution in infected cells.\n                            For example, hPOP1 is normally involved in rRNA processing (42, 55), and its mislocalization may reflect data showing that\n                            adenovirus eventually inhibits rRNA processing during infection (2). Nopp140 mislocalization also\n                            fits with these observations because it is a chaperone for small\n                            nucleolar RNA (56, 57). However, its co-localization\n                            with UBF and DBP implies that it may be an accessory factor in viral DNA\n                            replication during viral infection. Notably, in interphase cells, UBF\n                            and Nopp140 are co-localized and are known to be recruited together\n                                (56). RBM4 has been reported\n                            to be either predominantly nuclear or predominantly nucleolar, depending\n                            on experimental conditions (43,\n                                58\u201360).\n                            In our hands, the protein was nucleolar in >80% of\n                            cells. RBM4 has been implicated in the modulation of splice site\n                            selection, something of clear relevance to adenovirus infection, but it\n                            has also been suggested that this protein may inhibit cap-dependent\n                            translation while promoting internal ribosome entry site-mediated\n                            translation (43). This too may be\n                            significant because at later times in infection adenovirus makes use of\n                            a ribosome shunting method to promote the translation of its structural\n                            proteins at the expense of cellular mRNA translation (61). In a similar vein, ribosome\n                            assembly is regulated by eIF6, and it too may be used by adenoviruses to\n                            maximize the suitability of the infected cell for viral protein\n                            expression (41, 62).\n\nMany proteins in the current nucleolar proteome were not readily\n                            visualized in the nucleolus by fluorescence microscopy. However, our\n                            data show that even in these cases quantitative changes in nucleolar\n                            content are reflected in visible changes in protein distribution. For\n                            example, U2AF65, hnRNPU, and SFPQ (also known as PSF) are all\n                            known to be involved in mRNA metabolism, and at least U2AF65\n                            has been shown to play a role in adenovirus mRNA metabolism (38, 52, 63). As such, it\n                            seems reasonable to expect that these factors will be sequestered into\n                            regions adjacent to adenovirus DBP because these regions are known to be\n                            active in viral mRNA synthesis (50). Indeed, U2AF65, hnRNPU, and SFPQ were all\n                            apparently sequestered into a similar pattern that would be consistent\n                            with a role for these proteins in viral mRNA metabolism. However, we do\n                            not see any particular sequestration into these regions for hnRNPA2/B1,\n                            which weakens the case hnRNPA2/B1 plays a role in viral mRNA metabolism,\n                            something which can only be determined through further\n                        experimentation.\n\nThat we detected cellular proteins enriched in the nucleolus was\n                            intriguing, and this was reflected in changes in distribution of p87\n                            PIKAP and S15a by immunofluorescence (Fig.\n                                4, B and C). That ribosomal\n                            protein S15a is enriched in the nucleus/nucleolus during infection again\n                            may reflect eventual interference by adenovirus with aspects of rRNA\n                            maturation and/or export.\n\nThe enrichment of p87 PIKAP (also known as PIK3R6) is also interesting.\n                            This protein is a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase\n                            \u03b3, which is part of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling\n                            pathway. These pathways cover a very wide range of responses from\n                            cellular growth to cellular motility. However, activation of\n                            phosphoinositide 3-kinase \u03b3 is linked mainly to host-wide\n                            responses to injury or infection (64). Indeed, it is clear that adenovirus does directly modulate\n                            the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway (65).\n\nA further set of proteins apparently enriched in the nucleolus were not\n                            detected by microscopy, possibly reflecting differences in sensitivity\n                            of proteomics methods compared with microscopy. Thus, a protein may be\n                            enriched in the nucleolus but still be below the level of detection by\n                            microscopic methods.\n\nWe also thought it a relevant control to examine a protein that did not\n                            apparently change in nucleolar abundance by 18 h postinfection. Nop132\n                            is thought to help recruit dead box protein DDX47 to the nucleolus and\n                            therefore play a role in rRNA processing (48). As can be seen in Fig. 6, there is no apparent change in the pattern\n                            of distribution of Nop132 at the time examined.\n\nInterestingly, there was a diverse range of localization changes in\n                            response to infection. For example, eIF6 was diffuse throughout the\n                            infected nucleoplasm. Alternatively, hnRNPU, SFPQ, and U2AF65\n                            were adjacent to DBP-rich centers, whereas histone H1c was cleared from\n                            the DBP-rich centers and regions adjacent to the DBP centers. This\n                            suggests that exclusion of cell proteins from DBP-rich centers is not\n                            simply a nonspecific feature of the adenovirus-infected cell\n                            nucleoplasm. Moreover, hPOP1 was excluded from the DBP-rich centers but\n                            was clearly enriched in a mottled pattern distinct from Nopp140 and\n                                U2AF65 for example. Thus, there is, as might be expected,\n                            enrichment of nucleolar antigens in distinct regions of the infected\n                            nucleoplasm. This suggests, not surprisingly, that distinct aspects of\n                            adenovirus replication benefit from different nucleolar antigens.\n\nComparing 2D gel analysis and SILAC approaches revealed that the SILAC\n                            method provided more information. However, only one protein (hnRNPA2/B1)\n                            was identified by both methods, and the depletion of eIF6 and RBM4 was\n                            not detected by SILAC. This reflects two key points: first, the lower\n                            sensitivity of the 2D gel approach, and second, that for the SILAC\n                            analysis, we only divided the one-dimensional gel electrophoresis sample\n                            into six slices prior to analysis.\n\nAs with previous proteomics investigations of subcellular components, we\n                            anticipate that further refinement over time will be possible and will\n                            yield a more detailed picture of the effects of adenovirus on this\n                            important structure both at the 18-h postinfection time point analyzed\n                            here and other time points. Also of note is the lack of viral proteins\n                            identified by either method. In part, this is a consequence of the time\n                            point chosen as the expression of late adenovirus proteins that are\n                            known nucleolar antigens would have only just begun. Other explanations\n                            are inherent in the methodology; i.e. the viral\n                            proteins may dissociate from nucleoli under the conditions present in\n                            the nucleolar isolation protocol.\n\nSeveral members of the cytoskeletal family were also highlighted by the\n                            2D gel approach. This may well reflect the observation that adenovirus\n                            protease cleaves cytokeratin 18 during infection, leading to altered\n                            cytoskeletal structure (66, 67).\n\nOur data show that adenovirus specifically targets aspects of the\n                            nucleolar proteome in contrast to nonspecific disruption by agents like\n                            ActD, providing the first high throughput insight into viral-nucleolar\n                            interactions. Moreover, by examining the nucleolar proteome, we were\n                            able to highlight misdistribution of antigens from all compartments of\n                            the cell. We believe this demonstrates the utility of proteomics\n                            approaches to generate meaningful data sets that will help us understand\n                            the role of the nucleolus in viral infection and to uncover previously\n                            unsuspected effects on the host cell during viral infection. Indeed,\n                            subcellular fractionation of this sort coupled with confocal microscopy\n                            provides a powerful new tool for understanding viral host cell\n                            interactions in a broad context and is a positive step toward a\n                            systematic understanding of virus host cell interactions."}
