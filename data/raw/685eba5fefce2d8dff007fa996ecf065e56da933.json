{"title": "Quantitative Temporal in Vivo Proteomics Deciphers the Transition of Virus-Driven Myeloid Cells into M2 Macrophages", "body": "Myeloid immune cell populations are phenotypically dynamic and arise from a common pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell lineage. Following infection, bone marrow (BM)-emigrating immature monocytic myeloid cells\ue0d5identified in mice as CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C + cells\ue0d5are recruited to the site of infection and mediate antimicrobial, as well as inflammatory, functions. Importantly, site-specific environmental cues dictate the functionality and cellular phenotype of these myeloid cells, ranging from pro-inflammatory to immunosuppressive. It is hypothesized that, through a temporal transition, these inflammatory immature myeloid cells differentiate into monocytes and macrophages that acquire specific phenotypes, functionalities, and metabolic profiles throughout infection. Such plasticity permits these myeloid cells to be associated with a plethora of pathological conditions including pathogenic infections, 1\u22123 inflammatory diseases/responses, 4,5 cancer progression, 6\u22129 and antitumor immune responses. 10 Following infection, recruitment and transition of inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6C + cells are instrumental in L. monocytogenes, 2 K. pneumoniae, 1 and influenza virus clearance. 11 Although the exact mechanism of how inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C + cells contribute to pathogenic clearance is unclear, it is apparent that these cells are pivotal in both innate immunity as well as adaptive immunity. 1, 12 Thus, an in depth examination of their transitory, temporal, and stage-specific phenotype is necessary to understand the role and function of virus-driven inflammatory myeloid cells.\n\nChanges in immune cell functions during infections are dependent on dynamic proteomic changes over time. Notwithstanding previous technological challenges, comprehensive and temporal characterization of proteomes to understand cellular function is now possible due to recent advancements in multiplex quantitative proteomics. 13, 14 Combined with novel synchronous precursor selection with three-stage mass spectrometry (SPS-MS3) acquisition methods, extremely precise measurements of cellular proteomes are now possible. 15, 16 Although proteomic analysis has previously captured single time point \"snapshots\" of in vivo cell populations, in vivo dynamics of immune cell populations have not been explored. Here, we report a quantitative temporal in vivo proteomics (QTiPs) approach, which combines SPS-MS3-based 10-plex quantitative proteomics with flow cytometry-based cell sorting to precisely capture temporospatial proteomic changes of newly recruited, transitory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells during reovirus infection.\n\nReovirus is a benign, enteric, human dsRNA virus that drives an acute viral infection and is readily cleared through an immunocompetent host. 17 In addition to its use as a model of acute infection, reovirus is known for its potent preferential cancerkilling (also known as oncolytic) activities and is being tested as a therapeutic oncolytic virus in phase I, II, and III clinical trials internationally for the treatment of a variety of tumors. 18\u221223 In this context, it is now clear that immunological events initiated following the administration of reovirus in immunocompetent hosts are the indispensable part of reovirus-based cancer therapy. Thus, the detailed understanding of immunological events initiated following viral infection is pertinent to the therapeutic effectiveness of oncolytic virus-based cancer immunotherapy. 24, 25 Thus, using QTiPs combined with phenotypic, transcriptional, functional, and metabolic validations, we illustrate a temporal transition of reovirus-driven CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C + cells from their role in innate antiviral immune response (CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high cells) to their acquisition of M2-like macrophage phenotype (CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C low cells) during viral infection. Our QTiPs approach reports a novel platform to elucidate in depth, quantitative, temporospatial cellular transitions in the context of various pathophysiological conditions in situ. Our QTiPs approach reports a novel platform to elucidate in depth, quantitative, temporospatial cellular transitions in the context of various pathophysiological conditions in situ.\n\nThe following reagents used were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA): FITC-antimouse Ly6G (1A8), Alexa Fluor 647-antimouse Ly6G (1A8), PE-antimouse Ly6C (Hk1.1), APC-antimouse Ly6C (Hk1.1), Alexa Fluor 647-antimouse CD206 (C068C2), PerCP/Cy5.5-antimouse CD11b (M1/70), Alexa Fluor 647-antimouse MHC-11 (I-A/I-E) (M5/114.15.2), and PE-antimouse H.2kb bound to SIINFEKL (25-D1.16). Antimouse CD16/32 (93) and APC-antimouse CCR2 (cat# FAB5538a) were purchased from BioXCell (West Lebanon, NH) and R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), respectively. Metabolic stains, DAF-FM diacetate (4-amino-5-methylamino-2\u2032,7\u2032-difluorofluorescein diacetate) (D23844), and CM-H2DCFDA (C6827) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Rochford, IL, USA).\n\nIn vivo experimental procedures were approved by the Dalhousie University Animal Ethics Committee in accordance with the regulations/guidelines from the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) (project numbers 14-086 and 16-107). C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratory (Montreal, Quebec, Canada), and CCR2KO and C57BL/6-GFP mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).\n\nAnimals were injected with reovirus as previously described, 26, 27 and inflammatory myeloid cells were collected from the site of infection as well as bone marrow on 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 days postinfection (d.p.i.). Harvested cells were collected and stained as previously described 26 and sorted using a FACSAria III (BD Biosciences), resulting in \u223c95% purity. Isolated cells were washed with PBS, pelleted, and lysed in 6 M guanidine-HCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5, containing Roche complete mini protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet per 10 mL) (Roche, Madison, WI). Lysis was performed via sonication and cleared by centrifugation. Cysteine residues were reduced using 5 mM dithiothreitol and then alkylated with 14 mM iodoacetamide. Aliquots containing 50 \u03bcg of protein were diluted to 1.5 M guanidine-HCl, 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5) and digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Digested peptides were desalted using 60 mg solid-phase C18-extraction cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA), lyophilized, and labeled using TMT 10-plex reagents as described previously. 28 Samples were then mixed equally, desalted using solid-phase C18 extraction cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA), and lyophilized.\n\nTMT10-labeled samples were fractionated using high-pH reversed phase chromatography performed with an Onyx monolithic 100 \u00d7 4.6 mm C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The flow rate was 800 \u03bcL/min, and a gradient of 5\u221240% acetonitrile (10 mM ammonium formate, pH 8) was applied over 60 min using an Agilent 1100 pump (Agilent) from which 12 fractions were collected. Fractions were desalted using homemade Stage Tips, 29 lyophilized, and analyzed with an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Rochford, IL) using the SPS-MS3 method as described previously. 28, 29 Protein identification was performed using a database search against a mouse proteome database (downloaded from UniProtKB in September 2014) concatenated to a mammalian orthoreovirus 3 (Dearing strain) database (downloaded from UniProtKB in September 2014). All false discovery rate (FDR) filtering and protein quantitation was performed as previously described. 28 A protein was required to have a minimum total signal-to-noise of 100 in all TMT reporter channels, and the maximum number of missing channels was equal to 8. Data for heat maps and individual protein profiles are represented by relative intensity, which is based on the summed signal-to-noise.\n\nGO-annotation analysis was originally conducted on the whole data set using the open access Gene Ontology Consortium. 30, 31 The data set was subsequently analyzed via k-means clustering with Euclidean distance using MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) 32 followed by DAVID Bioinformatics Resources (https://david. ncifcrf.gov/) to conduct GO-term analysis for BPs, MFs, and cellular compartments on specific clusters. Our total data set was utilized as the background for the data analysis searches. For the indicated experiments, the Interferome Web site 33 and MitoCarta database 34, 35 were utilized to cross-list for proteins associated with interferon (IFN) response and mitochondrialassociated proteins, respectively. Insertion of individual clusters into the Interferome search engine identified IFN-associated proteins and classified such proteins into different IFN types. The mass spectrometry proteomics data (Data S-1) have been deposited into ProteomeXchange Consortium 36 via the PRIDE 37 partner repository with the data set identifier PXD005064. \n\nFlow cytometry of harvested all immune cells from the spleen and bone marrow from independently collected animals as previously described. 26 Peritoneal cavity (PC) cells were harvested via a flush of the PC with PBS. Flow cytometry for MHC-ova (SIINFEKL) was conducted by first pulsing unlabeled immune cells harvested from the PC with SIINFEKL peptide (5 \u03bcg/mL) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in RPMI complete media (5% vol/vol Glutamax, 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS], 1\u00d7 sodium pyruvate, 1\u00d7 nonessential amino acids, and 1\u00d7 Anti-Anti [Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA]). Harvested cells (PC, spleen, and BM) were treated with RBC-lysing ammonium chloride (ACK) buffer, washed, and blocked with anti-CD16/32 antibody prior to primary antibody. For metabolic stains (NO and ROS), cells were incubated with 2.5 \u03bcM DAF-FM diacetate (4-amino-5methylamino-2\u2032,7\u2032-difluorofluorescein diacetate) (D23844; Molecular Probes) or 2.5 \u03bcM CM-H2DCFDA (C6827; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C in combination with antibodies in flow cytometry running buffer (PBS-EDTA with 1% FBS) (FACS buffer). Cells harvested for flow cytometry, with the exception of DAF-FM-or DCF-stained cells, were fixed with 4% PFA, washed, and resuspended in FACS buffer prior to analysis. Flow cytometry data were collected using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Bioscience), and analysis was conducted with the use of CellQuest Pro (BD Bioscience) and FCS Express V3 software (DeNovo Software, Los Angeles, CA).\n\nReovirus (serotype 3, Dearing strain) was cultured, amplified, and isolated using a previously established protocol. 38 Reovirus was titered on L929 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) by standard plaque assay as described previously. 27 ,39 L929 cells were cultured in minimum essential media with 5% vol/vol Glutamax, 5% fetal bovine serum, 1\u00d7 sodium pyruvate, 1\u00d7 nonessential amino acids, and 1\u00d7 Anti-Anti (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To assess the intra-and extracellular virus from the (site of infection) SOI, 5 mL of PBS was added to the peritoneal cavity. The resultant peritoneal flush was collected and spun down at 500g for 6 min to separate the cells (for analysis of intracellular virus) from the extracellular fraction (containing the free extracellular virus). Either sorted CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells or nonsorted cells (total heterogeneous population of cells) from such a peritoneal flush were lysed with RIPA buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA) to extract intracellular virus. To determine the viral titer (plaque forming units/mL), L929 cells were infected with a serial dilution of cell lysate or peritoneal flush supernatant. Virus titers were accessed 96 h post the initial L929 cell infection.\n\nRNA extractions, cDNA synthesis, and qPCR were conducted as previously described 26 on independently collected samples. The indicated gene-specific primers were purchased from Invitrogen. Data were analyzed using Livak and Schmittgen's 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT method 40 and normalized to Gapdh.\n\nSorted cells (5 \u00d7 10 5 cells), independently collected from a pooled population of 5\u221210 mice, were resuspended in XF media and plated onto X24 Seahorse cell plates coated with Cell-Tak (Corning). Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were measured in XF assay media under basal conditions and in response to 1 \u03bcM oligomycin, 1.5 \u03bcM carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP), 1 \u03bcM rotenone, and 1 \u03bcM antimycin A (all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, ON, Canada) on the XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA, USA). Basal OCR was calculated by subtraction of the residual rate after antimycin A treatment. Maximal rate was calculated by subtraction of the residual rate after antimycin A treatment from FCCP-induced OCR. Proton leak was calculated as the difference between OCR after oligomycin treatment and OCR after antimycin A treatment. ATP production was calculated by subtraction of OCR after oligomycin treatment from basal OCR. Spare respiratory capacity was calculated by the difference between maximal OCR and basal OCR. Spare respiratory capacity coupling efficiency was calculated by the dividend of basal OCR and ATP production. Glycolytic capacity was calculated as the ECAR after oligomycin treatment. Glycolytic reserve was calculated by the difference between glycolytic capacity and ECAR. Glycolytic reserve percentage was calculated by the dividend of glycolytic capacity and ECAR.\n\nBone marrow cells were collected from femur and tibia bones and cultured for 6\u22128 days in RPMI complete media supplemented with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (20 ng/mL for M1-like macrophages) or macrophage colonystimulating factor (100 ng/mL for M2-like macrophages).\n\nDepending on the indicated experiment, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test or a two-tailed Student's t-test with 95% confidence interval were used for statistical analysis, and p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Asterisks were used to signify p values as not significant (ns) = p > 0.05, *p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01, and ***p \u2264 0.001.\n\nQTiPs of Virus-Induced CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high Myeloid Cells Exposure to pathogens, especially viruses, drives the recruitment of CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high myeloid cells that undergo functional transition at the site of infection. To directly visualize this transition of newly recruited, virus-induced myeloid cells in situ, we performed 10-plex quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) on temporally collected, cell-sorted, reovirus-driven myeloid cells. Reovirus induces the accumulation of otherwise absent CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high cells at the site of infection as early as 1 d.p.i., which subsequently exhibited a gradual loss of Ly6C expression over time (hence the reference to these cells as CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low ; Figure 1A and Figure S-1A-B). These CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells were sorted from the site of infection (SOI, inflammatory) and the BM (resident) from 10 C57BL/6 mice per collection point. QTiPs analysis identified 6634 proteins and quantified 5019 proteins from the in vivo harvested and cell-sorted myeloid cell population spanning the course of 10 days in both the SOI and BM ( Figure 1B , Data S-1). Comparing 10 to 1 d.p.i., SOI-isolated cells contained more proteomic changes (>-or <2-fold) than in the BM myeloid cells (12.69 vs 5.46%, respectively) ( Figure 1C ). Because the QTiPs data set provides rich temporal proteomic data, it can be interrogated further to reveal temporally distinct virus-driven myeloid cell changes over the course of acute infection.\n\nBecause of the limited knowledge of the overall proteomic signature of CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells, we first conducted\n\nArticle GO annotation analysis 30,31 of all identified proteins in our data set. The most represented biological processes (BPs) were cellular (including cell cycle, proliferation, recognition, and growth) and metabolic (including catabolic, biosynthetic, and coenzyme) processes pertaining to 33.6 and 20.7% of the overall annotation analysis, respectively ( Figure 1D and Figure S-1C) . As anticipated, we observed immune system-associated BPs ( Figure 1D ), which encompassed antigen processing/presentation, immune response, and macrophage activation BPs ( Figure S-1C) . Investigation of BP-associated proteins identified temporal differences between the SOI and BM. For example, immune-associated proteins (complement C4-B, IFN-inducible GTPase 1, and activated macrophage/microglia WAP domain protein [WFDC17]) were predominantly higher in the SOI-isolated cells. Interestingly, unlike complement C4-B and IFN-inducible GTPase, which peak in relative abundance at 1 and 5 d.p.i., respectively. WFDC17 increased \u223c10-fold from 1 to 10 d.p.i., suggesting a timedependent discrepancy in immune function ( Figure 1E ). Additionally, numerous cell cycle-associated proteins (e.g., Retinoblastoma-like protein 1) were more abundant in BM-isolated fractions, proposing that cellular proliferation of these myeloid cells is greater in the BM. Because metabolic alterations can contribute to immune cell function/differentiation, we inspected the data set for metabolic proteins and observed a 2.1-and 8.4-fold induction of lactate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase, respectively, from 1 to 10 d.p.i. in SOI-isolated cells; however, no change was observed within the BM-isolated collections ( Figure 1E ). These changes suggest that SOI-isolated cells develop a more Warburg-like metabolism at 7 and 10 d.p.i.. Collectively, our QTiPs approach successfully captured temporal, quantitative, and spatially comparable proteomes of transitory myeloid cells directly from their in situ microenvironment.\n\nTemporal Transition of Inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high Cells Aids in Viral Clearance\n\nTo understand distinct functions of virus-driven CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high cells, we clustered the data set using k-means clustering, revealing temporally distinct patterns of protein expression. Three of ten clusters contained proteins repressed over the period of 1\u221210 d.p.i. (Figure S-2) . GO annotation analysis using DAVID bioinformatics 41,42 of cluster #1 (decreased expression patterns Figure 2 . CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C + cells mount an antiviral immune response early following reovirus infection. Clusters #1\u22123 were generated via k-means cluster analyses using the Euclidean distance metric and are representative of three of ten clusters of the total proteomic analysis. GO annotation analysis of biological process (BP) and molecular function (MF) for clusters #1 (A, B), #2 (C, D), and #3 (E, F) using DAVID bioinformatics are summarized in a bar graph and are represented as individual protein profiles for the indicated GO terms. Bar graphs illustrate the \u2212log10 (adjusted [adj.] p-value) and number of identified targets per GO term (in brackets). These data are representative of a pooled cell-sorted population from 10 C57BL/6 mice per collection time point.\n\nArticle from 1 to 3 d.p.i.) showed an over-representation of BPs corresponding to response to cytokine stimulus, humoral immune response, defense response (e.g., IFIH1 and CCL2), and steroid metabolic processes (Figure 2A, B) . Alongside these BPs, serinetype peptidase and endopeptidase inhibitor activity molecular functions (MFs) were over-represented within this cluster \n\nArticle (e.g., ZP1 and HRG). In cluster #2 (expression peak at 5 d.p.i.), we observed an over-representation of response to wounding, response to stimulus (hormone and positive regulation) (e.g., CCL7 and CCL12), and endopeptidase inhibitor activity (e.g., SPA3K and MUG1) ( Figure 2C, D) . These data suggest that SOI-isolated cells are early responders to viral infection. Furthermore, cluster #3 represented proteins with a general elevated relative intensity within SOI-vs BM-isolated cells. GO annotation of cluster #3 showed an over-representation of BP-associated categories for the response to virus (e.g., RSAD2 and toll-like receptor 3 [TLR3]), response to wounding, endocytosis, and antigen processing/presentation (e.g., ICAM1 and HA11) ( Figure 2E, F) . Specifically, cluster #3 contained hallmark viral infection-associated immunological targets, such as 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthase 1A (OAS1A), TLR3, TLR9, H-2 Class-I histocompatibility antigen, \u03b2-2-microglobulin, and ICAM1. Collectively, this These experiments (E, F) are representative bar graphs of mean \u00b1 SEM with n = 3\u22125. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test (E, F) with a 95% confidence interval were used for statistical analysis, and p-values of <0.05 were considered significant. Asterisks were used to signify p-values as *p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01, and ***p \u2264 0.001.\n\nArticle analysis reveals a time-dependent transition of inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells and suggests a role for inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells in antiviral immunity.\n\nConsidering that reovirus exposure stimulates pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), especially toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3), and produces a type I IFN response, clusters #1\u22123 were additionally analyzed using an Interferome database. 33 This analysis revealed profiles for numerous IFN-associated genes (e.g., ISG20, MPEG1, IFI5A, Q9DCE9, and IRG1) ( Figure 3A\u2212C) . Gene-specific RT-PCR amplification of Isg56, Cd40, Igtp, Serpina3k, Ccl7, If it3, Irgm1, Trafd1, and If i5a showed compatible mRNA expression trends with that of their respective protein expression profiles from clusters #1\u22123 ( Figure 3D ). Importantly, temporal changes in IFN-associated protein expression were mostly within SOI-isolated cells as opposed to their BM-isolated counterparts. Categorizing these IFN-associated proteins into type I and II responses emphasizes a predominant type I IFN-response from SOI-isolated cells early following infection in addition to a secondary elevation in type II IFN-associated proteins (shown in cluster #2) ( Figure 3E ). Together, these results suggest that CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells contribute to type I and type II IFN response following infection.\n\nOn the basis of the temporal IFN response associated with CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells, we next sought to determine if they affect viral replication. First, we investigated the viral titers of reovirus within CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells (intracellular) as well as those present within the SOI (extracellular). In congruence with the reoviral lambda protein expression profile captured within the QTiPs data ( Figure 4A ), plaque assaybased analysis for the intracellular and extracellular virus showed the highest viral titers at 1 d.p.i. that steadily declined over the course of 10 days ( Figure 4B, C) . These data demonstrated the ability of inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells to harbor reovirus in a time-dependent manner. In the context of the proposed role for such myeloid cells as oncolytic virus carriers, 43\u221245 these findings bear clinical relevance.\n\nBecause the SOI contains a diverse mixture of immune cells, we wanted to delineate whether the CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells specifically affect viral persistence. For this purpose, we used a well-documented CCR2 KO mouse model in which the trafficking of inflammatory myeloid cells from the BM to the SOI is defective. 2 Importantly, this characteristic of impaired trafficking of inflammatory myeloid cells in CCR2 KO mice is routinely used to identify the contribution of myeloid cells during viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. 11, 12, 37, 38 Thus, we first conducted comparative frequency/kinetic analysis of reovirusdriven CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 versus CCR2KO mice and showed a near absence of CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cell accumulation within the SOI of CCR2KO mice ( Figure 4D ), confirming the requirement of CCR2 for the recruitment of CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells at the SOI. No significant frequency/kinetics differences for these cells were observed within the spleen and BM of WT vs CCR2KO mice (Figure S-3A) . Furthermore, the comparative intracellular virus load analysis on total SOI-collected immune cells illustrated significantly higher titer of replication-competent reovirus in CCR2KO mice (which contain a lower number of CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells) as compared to that of the WT mice ( Figure 4E ) and suggested an antiviral role for inflammatory myeloid cells. It should also be noted that these inflammatory cells also contain the known antiviral mediators including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), especially at 1 d.p.i. (Figure 4F ). Together, these analyses validate the QTiPs-revealed role for CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells in viral clearance.\n\nA particularly interesting cluster of proteins, showed delayed (7\u221210 d.p.i.) increased abundance in SOI-but not BM-isolated CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells ( Figure 5A, cluster #4) . GO annotation of cluster #4 illustrated an increased peptidase activity (MF) within these cells during the later stages of infection, which included antigen processing/presentation-associated proteins, such as Cathepsin B (CATB) and Cathepsin D (CATD), that are essential to drive an effective adaptive immune response ( Figure 5B, C) . 46 GO annotation also revealed an over-representation of MFs of the immune effector process, response to wounding (e.g., PERF and ARGI1), homeostatic process, endocytosis, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II antigen processing/presentation (e.g., MRC1 and HG2A) in SOI-isolated cells ( Figure 5B, D) . qRT-PCR-based validation of many of these targets showed consistent temporal gene expression patterns for genes Mrc1, Pepd, H2-ab1, Cd74, Tpp1, and Lip1 ( Figure S-3B) . Together, the QTiPs suggested the acquisition of antigen-presentation capabilities by inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells late during infection.\n\nTo validate this hypothesis, we examined MHC-II surface expression on CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells during infection. Congruent with our proteomics data, these cells demonstrated higher surface expression of MHC-II at 7\u221210 d.p.i. compared to those at 3 and 5 d.p.i.; however, it was interesting to note that these cells were initially recruited with elevated MHC-II expression at 1 d.p.i. (Figure 5E ). Finally, to demonstrate the antigen presentation capacity, we monitored the ability of virusdriven CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells to present the immunodominant epitope of ovalbumin (OVA; peptide SIINFEKL) in the context of MHC-I. Importantly, CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells showed the highest capacity to present SIINFEKL at 7 d.p.i. ( Figure 5F ). Altogether, our data suggest that inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells undergo a phenotypic and functional transition to acquire enhanced antigen processing/ presentation abilities during the later stage of infection.\n\nMetabolic Reprogramming Accompanies Inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low Cell Transition/Differentiation Because of the connection between distinct metabolic pathways and myeloid cell functional capacities, and based on the QTiPsidentified induction of proteins regulating metabolism (e.g., LDHA), we also assessed the metabolic profiles of transitory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells. Metabolic-associated proteins (indicated by BPs and cellular compartment GO annotation analysis) were evident in cluster #5 with an increasing trend from 1 to 10 d.p.i. in SOI-isolated cells ( Figure S-4A\u2212C) . We compared our QTiPs data set to the mouse MitoCarta2.0 data set 34, 35 to exclusively examine known mitochondrial proteins. Using k-means clustering, we subdivided the total mitochondria-associated proteomic data into various clusters (Mitoclusters #1\u221210; Figure 6A and Figure S-5) . GO annotation analysis of Mito-clusters #1 and 2 showed an over-representation of proteins involved in cellular response to ROS, the fatty acid metabolic process, response to oxidative stress, and generation of precursor metabolites and energy ( Figure S-6A) . KEGG pathway analysis 41, 42 of Mito-clusters #1\u22122 showed an over-representation of fatty acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and the citric acid cycle ( Figure S-6A) , and STRING network analysis 47 further illustrated the interaction of these pathways among all\n\nArticle metabolic pathway-associated proteins (shown in red) within these clusters ( Figure 6B ). Individual protein profile analysis from Mito-clusters #1 and 2 of the citrate acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation revealed a general increasing trend from 1 to 10 d.p.i. (Figure 6C ). These analyses highlight the metabolic reprogramming of inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells following viral infection.\n\nBecause the proteomic data suggested a metabolic switch in SOI-isolated CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells, especially at 7\u221210 d.p.i., we examined time-dependent cellular bioenergetics (mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis) ( Figure 6D and Figure S-6B) in isolated CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells. As shown in Figure 6E and Figure S-6C , SOI isolated cells displayed the highest basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP produc- Basal OCR and ECAR graphically represented (E) and summarized for the spare respiratory capacity (%) (F) and glycolytic reserve (%) (G). Graphs in D\u2212G are data represented as mean \u00b1 SEM and collected from n = 1\u22124 each with a pooled population from 5 to 10 mice. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test (F\u2212H) with 95% confidence interval were used for statistical analysis, and p-values of <0.05 were considered significant.

Concurrently, basal extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) ( Figure 6E and Figure S-6F ) of isolated CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells were also greatest at 7\u221210 d.p.i. Importantly, the opposing trend was observed with spare respiratory capacity ( Figure 6F ), maximal OCR ( Figure S-6G) , and glycolytic reserve ( Figure 6G and Figure S-6H) , indicating that these cells utilize glycolysis close to their theoretical maximum at 7\u221210 d.p.i. These data show that inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells undergo metabolic reprogramming at the SOI and increase both glycolytic and respiratory capacities during the later stages of infection. It has been hypothesized that immature myeloid cells give rise to antigen-presenting cells (APCs), especially those of monocytic lineage. 48 Our data suggest that the virus-driven CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells undergo temporal transformation and acquire molecular signatures of APCs. Hence, we next investigated whether these myeloid cells differentiate into any specific subtype of the APCs. The QTiPs data ( Figure 7A ) identified an increasing trend for proteins (CCL24, ARG-1, Alox15, Stab1, and TGF-\u03b2) characteristic of M2 macrophages between 1 and 10 d.p.i. in SOI-isolated myeloid cells. In contrast, M1-macrophage- Figure 1B .

One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test (C\u2212H) with 95% confidence interval was used for statistical analysis, and p-values of <0.05 were considered significant. Asterisks were used to signify p-values as *p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01, and ***p \u2264 0.001.\n\nArticle associated proteins (IRF5, MMP9, and IRF1) showed the opposing trend ( Figure 7B ). In support of this, flow cytometry analysis of inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells further identified contrasting kinetics for the surface expression of M2 macrophage marker CD206 (increased over time; Figure 7C ) and M1 macrophage marker CCR2 (decreased over time; Figure 7D ). In line with our metabolic bioenergetics, these results reveal the transition of inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells into M2-like macrophages around 7\u221210 d.p.i.\n\nTo further strengthen our hypothesis that the inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells acquire M2-like macrophage characteristics, we performed qRT-PCR on SOI-and BM-isolated CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells. First, we analyzed the expression of key transcription factors Irf4 and Irf5 known to be involved in M2 vs M1 macrophage polarization, respectively. 49\u221251 As shown in Figure 7E and F, SOI-isolated myeloid cells showed contrasting profiles of Irf4 and Irf5 between 1 and 10 d.p.i.; the levels of M2-macrophage transcription factor Irf4 increased over time, whereas Irf5 decreased over time. Furthermore, using a list of M2 and M1 macrophage markers, 52, 53 we showed that M2-associated marker Ccl17 followed a similar trend as Irf4 ( Figure 7G ), whereas additional M2-associated genes (Ym1, Cd206, and Il4) displayed mostly nonsignificant changes ( Figure S-7A) . Importantly, the expression of M1-associated markers (Cd86, Il-1\u03b2, Cd68, Socs1, Tnf\u03b1, and If n\u03b3) showed an opposing trend throughout infection with decreasing expression from 1 to 10 d.p.i. (Figure 7H ). Analysis of M2-and M1-associated genes in the BM-isolated cells showed little significant variation (Figure S-7B and C, respectively). These results, in combination with QTiPs analysis, conclusively demonstrate that the virus-driven CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells undergo phenotypic and functional transition at the SOI and acquire the characteristics of M2 macrophages.\n\nMyeloid cells and their descendants, including monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), play pivotal roles in both innate and adaptive immunity during infections. With regard to viral infections, newly recruited Ly6C high monocytes have been implicated in viral clearance following infection with West Nile virus, vaccinia virus, murine cytomegalovirus, and influenza virus. 54\u221256 These studies demonstrate that viral-driven myeloid cells readily interact with other innate (NK cells) and adaptive cells (virus-specific CD8+ T cells) 11, 56 and contribute toward viral clearance as well as disease pathology through direct or indirect mechanisms. For instance, inflammatory myeloid cells recruited following mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) contribute toward virus clearance through a CCR2-dependent mechanism. 57 Furthermore, influenza-mediated CD11b + , Ly6C high cell recruitment is a major contributor to excessive collateral damage within the lungs, and the absence of such recruitment compromises viral clearance and decreases the CD8+ T cell frequency. 11 In congruence with these reports, our data demonstrates that the recruitment of reovirus-driven CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high inflammatory cells is CCR2-dependent ( Figure 4D ) and that their presence at the SOI positively correlates with viral clearance ( Figure 4E) . Interestingly, at the SOI, intracellular virus be found within the cells with and without the CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high phenotype ( Figure 4E ), suggesting the involvement of other immune cells in antiviral immune reactivities. Thus, it could be concluded that virus-driven CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high inflammatory cells, in combination with other immune constituents, contribute toward virus clearance.\n\nHere, we provide the first comprehensive temporospatial quantitative proteomic analysis of inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells directly isolated from their in situ microenvironment. Notably, our QTiPs approach accounts for host environmental factors, such as cytokines, metabolic changes, and immune infiltrating/resident cells, at the SOI. In combination with detailed biological validation, the QTiPs data show that reovirusdriven CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells have differential roles throughout the course of infection: newly recruited CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high cells mount a robust immune response and aid in viral clearance during the early phase of infection (1\u22125 d.p.i.), whereas during late phase infection (7 and 10 d.p.i.), these cells undergo a metabolic shift, acquire enhanced antigen-presentation capacity, and achieve M2-like macrophage characteristics.\n\nQuantitative multiplexed proteomic approaches (e.g., labelfree, tags, or stable isotope labeling) represent an unbiased strategy to observe global proteomic changes and answer key biological questions. With respect to immunological studies, label-free quantitation has been the predominant means to investigate proteomic discrepancies of ex vivo expanded/ cultured or transformed cell lines (e.g., cytotoxic T lymphocytes, 58 dendritic cells, and/or macrophages 59\u221261 ), and primaryisolated cells such as dendritic cell subsets, 62 MDSCs, 63 and human T cells. 64 Unlike such label-free approaches, TMT reagents now facilitate simultaneous analysis of 10 proteomes. Employing TMT in our QTiPs approach enabled accurate and deep proteomic coverage of in vivo proteomic profiles of isolated CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells. The temporal nature of the data set revealed a secondary phase of antiviral/wound damage response at 5 d.p.i. indicative of increased type I and II IFNassociated proteins (e.g., IFI5A, IRF5, IRG1, and Q9DCE9, an IFN-\u03b3-induced GTPase). IFI5A in particular has been shown to be a transcriptional regulatory factor induced during myeloid cell development 65 and may have implications in CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cell differentiation at 5\u221210 d.p.i. Furthermore, late stage variations illustrated in clusters #4 and 5 or Mito-clusters #1 and 2 correlate with increased antigen presentation/processing and metabolic shift, respectively. Such temporal fluctuations in the proteomes highlight the advantages of utilizing an approach that monitors the in vivo dynamics of an immune cell population. Our QTiPs approach provides a global, timely, and in depth platform facilitating the capture of immune cell transitions while accounting for the interplay between cytokines and immune cells throughout the course of infection.\n\nConsidering the current contentious nomenclature and phenotypic categorization around myeloid cells and its derivative subpopulations, 52 we identified virus-driven murine myeloid cells simply by their factual phenotype (based on CD11b, Ly6G, and Ly6C surface expression). To this end, we viewed these myeloid cells as a newly recruited cell population at the SOI and then analyzed their transition into existing paradigmal subpopulations in terms of surface marker, gene expression, protein, and metabolic profiles. Our temporal analysis reveals that SOI-associated CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high cells undergo a time-dependent decrease in Ly6C expression and display increased MHC-II expression and wound healing characteristics at 7\u221210 d.p.i., suggesting maturation/differentiation during the later stages of infection. Upon further dissection, we observed that M2-macrophage-associated proteins and transcripts increase at 7\u221210 d.p.i. as opposed to pro-inflammatory/M1-macrophageassociated markers that are upregulated during the early stages of infection. Similar to myeloid cells, there is a growing appreciation for the plasticity of the distinction between M1-vs M2-like\n\nArticle macrophages. It is now acknowledged that macrophages rather demonstrate a spectrum of phenotypic, functional, and physiological features of M1 and M2 classes and thus often display these features in a context-dependent manner. It should be noted that many of the M1-or M2-associated features have been originally discovered in the context of the macrophages that were generated using defined in vitro growth conditions, such as through the supplementation of GM-CSF or M-CSF. Thus, it is possible that cells differentiated in the context of the complex in vivo milieu hosting a myriad of soluble and cellular interacting partners bear a differential pattern of M1 and M2 markers that is observed with the in vitro-generated macrophages. In our analysis, virus-driven CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high cells show several M2-associated markers during the later phases of infection; however, at the same, these cells failed to show any congruent trends with of Il4, Ym1, and Cd206 gene expression that have been described to be associated with the M2 phenotype. On the basis of these findings, we surmise that the macrophages generated in a complex in vivo microenvironment differ from those generated in vitro using defined growth conditions and should be considered as such with a special consideration for their microenvironmental context.\n\nThe metabolic signature of myeloid cells, particularly macrophages, is a major hallmark to distinguish contrasting M1 vs M2 macrophage phenotypes. 66 In comparison to this existing paradigm and our own experiments with ex vivo-generated/cultured M1-and M2-like macrophages ( Figure S-7D, E) , 66 we observed that CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells became more metabolically active during the later stages of infection, as indicated by increasing basal OCR and basal ECAR ( Figure 6D, E) . Such a metabolic shift could be indicative of the necessity to require energy for newly acquired endocytic, antigen presentation, and/ or M2-like functionality. In the context of currently reported metabolic profiles assigned to M1-(low basal OCR, high basal ECAR, and low spare respiratory capacity) and M2-(high OCR, low basal ECAR, and high spare respiratory capacity) macrophages, the infection-driven CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells demonstrate a dynamic metabolic signature in the transition between M1-and M2-like macrophages in line with the proteomic signature elucidated through QTiPs. This analysis further confirms the highly plastic nature of the myeloid cell\u2212 macrophage transition and, in line with the recent evidence 67,68 specifically using lipopolysaccharide/TLR4 stimulation versus IL-4-stimulated BM-derived macrophages, further supports the hypothesis that in vitro-generated macrophages do not completely recapitulate all metabolic and functional characteristics of in vivo-isolated or human cells.\n\nIn conclusion, QTiPs analysis comprehensively captures the temporospatial transition of inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G \u2212 , Ly6C high-low cells following reovirus infection. These data contain a plethora of information on native, as well as infection-driven, myeloid cells that reside in the BM or at the SOI and are a resource for future hypothesis testing with regard to myeloidspecific differentiation, antiviral response, and metabolic alteration. The data also have implications for the therapeutic management of myeloid cells in the context of antiviral immune responses, vaccine development, cancer immunotherapies, and especially oncolytic virus therapies, which are known to drive myeloid cell recruitment to the tumor microenvironment following administration. 26 Our data also demonstrate that the QTiPs approach can be applied further to precisely capture the complex, dynamic, and temporal nature of other types of immune cells collected from their in situ microenvironment.
