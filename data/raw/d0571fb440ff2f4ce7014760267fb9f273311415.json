{"title": "Multicentre randomised controlled trial to investigate the usefulness of continuous pneumatic regulation of tracheal cuff pressure for reducing ventilator-associated pneumonia in mechanically ventilated severe trauma patients: the AGATE study protocol", "body": "\u2022 This study will be conducted as a multicentre randomised, controlled and open-label trial adequately powered to determine whether continuous regulation of tracheal cuff pressure using a pneumatic device reduces the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia.\n\n\u2022 This will be the first large study on that topic with the potential of changing international recommendations on ventilation associated pneumonia prevention.\n\n\u2022 Study's benefits include reduced duration of mechanical ventilation and stay in the ICU, improved patient prognosis and reduction in antibiotics use.\n\n\u2022 Limitations due to the lack of masking related to the nature of the intervention is limited by a masked endpoint's assessment. Severe trauma represents the leading cause of mortality worldwide, and is the third highest cause of death in France behind cardiovascular disease and cancer. About 46 deaths following trauma occur per 100,000 inhabitants per year in France, representing close to 8% of all deaths. [1 2] While 80% of deaths occur within the first 24 hours of trauma, directly related to the trauma itself, 20% of deaths occur later and are mainly due to healthcareassociated infections (HAI). [3] [4] [5] [6] More than 50% of patients that present with severe trauma will develop at least one HAI during their stay. Neurological disorders, recourse to mechanical ventilation and early post-traumatic immune suppression may explain the elevated incidence of HAI, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which mainly occur in the first week following trauma. [7] [8] [9] Ventilator-associated pneumonia represents the predominant HAI in severe trauma patients with a mean incidence of 35%, which may even exceed 60% in some series, followed by catheter infections and bacteraemia. [3] [4] [5] [6] HAI account for heightened morbidity and mortality, longer stays in the ICU and increased treatment costs. In France, the additional cost is estimated at \u20ac800 million per year [1] . These infections also require high use of antibiotics, and VAP alone makes up more than half of the antibiotic treatments prescribed in the ICU. [7] Given the selection pressure they induce, these antibiotic therapies favour the appearance of bacterial resistance.\n\nVentilator-associated pneumonia pathophysiology\n\nThe presence of a foreign material (tracheal tube or stomach tube) facilitates colonisation of the upper airways and digestive tract by endogenous and exogenous microorganisms. Maintaining a sufficient level of pressure in the tracheal tube cuff is of critical importance.\n\nWhen the pressure is too low the patient risks inhaling the accumulated subglottic secretions from the oropharynx, which is known to play a major role in VAP incidence.[14 F o r p e e r r e v i e w o n l y 9 15] Alternatively, if the pressure is too high there is a risk of ischemia of the tracheal mucosa and, at removal, of tracheal oedema and later tracheal stenosis. Therefore, regular monitoring of tracheal cuff pressure is recommended, but the optimal monitoring frequency has yet to be clearly determined. Underinflation and/or overinflation of the tracheal cuff often occurs in ventilated patients under intermittent manual control of tracheal cuff pressure using a manometer, which is a well-known source of morbidity and mortality. [23] Recently published data favour use of automatic devices that are able to continuously regulate the tracheal cuff pressure. \n\nThe objective of this study is to determine whether continuous regulation of tracheal cuff pressure using a mechanical pneumatic regulation device (Nosten\u00ae, Leved, Paris) is superior \n\nThe AGATE trial is a multicentre, randomised, controlled and open-label clinical trial with two parallel groups, with the primary endpoint being the proportion of patients that develop VAP in the ICU at day 28. Randomisation will be carried out through a secure web-based randomisation system, stratified by the centre and severity of patient unconsciousness at the time of inclusion (Glasgow Coma scale lower and higher or equal to 8).\n\nPatients will be considered candidates for inclusion in the study if they meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (Table 1) . Patients suffering from severe trauma admitted within the first 24 hours, who require invasive mechanical ventilation expected to last longer than 48 hours, should be included in the study. For all cases, patient inclusion will take place as soon as possible after ICU admission, during the 24 hours following trauma and/or over the 15 hours following oral intubation of the trachea. Pregnant or lactating women can be included in the study because the material used does not present any specific risk of teratogenicity.\n\nAll of the patients included in the study will be randomised in one of the two treatment groups, which are based on the method used to monitor tracheal cuff pressure and benefit from daily monitoring throughout their hospital stay in the ICU. The following criteria will be applied to all patients and controlled throughout the duration of the study. \u2022 Implementation of identical sedation and weaning protocols for all centres.\n\n\u2022 Implementation of a lung protective ventilation strategy [34] by maintaining: a tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg of ideal body weight, Positive End Expiratory Pressure [PEEP] >3 cmH 2 O, and respiratory rate set to achieve normocapnia or optional moderate hypocapnia.\n\n\u2022 According to the protocol observed in the unit, extubation should be considered as soon as: (1) the patient's Glasgow Coma score is >10; (2) the patient is coughing spontaneously or secondary to bronchial aspiration; and (3) the level of pressure support is <10 cm H 2 O, or spontaneous ventilation on a T-piece with F i O 2 lower than 40% is tolerated by the patient for at least 30 minutes.\n\n\u2022 No systematic changes to the respirator circuits. \u2022 Preferential use of heat and humidity exchange filters to be changed only when soiled.\n\n\u2022 Systematic application of bed inclination of at least 30\u00b0 to be monitored every 4\n\nhours.\n\n\u2022 Hand washing (hydro-alcoholic friction) prior to any treatment and following isolation measures.\n\n\u2022 Mouth care every 4 to 8 hours according to the protocol observed in the unit.\n\n\u2022 Tracheal aspiration carried out using sterile equipment, only to be performed when required.\n\n\u2022 Preferential oral insertion of feeding tubes.\n\n\u2022 Starting enteral feeding as soon as possible.\n\n\u2022 Systematic application of a glucose monitoring protocol in which the patient's blood sugar level is measured every 4 hours, the objective being to maintain the glucose level between 4 and 8 mmol/L.\n\n\u2022 Prophylactic antibiotic treatment limited to 48 hours for fractures operated within the first 6 hours.\n\n\u2022 Curative antibiotic therapy reserved for infections for which the bacterial origin is Antibiotic therapy should be reevaluated between 24 and 72 hours.\n\n\u2022 Prevention of ulcer disease by anti-H 2 and proton pump inhibitors, in accordance with the protocol observed in the centre.\n\nPrimary endpoint (Table 3) . [36] -Number of ventilator-free days.\n\n-Number of antibiotic-free days.\n\n-Length of stay in the ICU.\n\n-Proportion of patients that die during their ICU stay.\n\n-Proportion of patients that require corticosteroids or bronchodilators within 48 hours of tracheal extubation.\n\nAttempted detection of VAP signs will be performed on a daily basis while the patient is being mechanically ventilated, in accordance with the definition established by the ATS in 2005 (Table 2 ). [7] A thoracic X-ray aimed at detecting VAP is to be carried out within a few hours whenever at least two of the following clinical signs of VAP are observed in the same 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Whenever the patient meets the clinical and radiological criteria on the same day, VAP is suspected and the modified clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) will be calculated, as presented in Table 4 . Bacterial analysis of the respiratory tract will be carried out especially if the calculated score is >6. The type of sampling (bronchoalveolar lavage, blind distal sampling or tracheal aspirates) is left to the discretion of the attending physician, and depends on the procedures of the unit.\n\nWhen a patient is suspected to have developed VAP, two assessors masked to the group assignment will review the case-report form and classify the case according to the accepted definition.\n\nThe patients will be monitored from randomisation through to their discharge from the ICU without exceeding 60 days following inclusion. Evaluation of the assessment criteria will be carried out depending on the duration of patient stay in the ICU.\n\n\u2022 Evaluation will be carried out upon discharge from the ICU for patients with an ICU stay of <28 days.\n\n\u2022 Evaluations will be carried out on day 28 and upon discharge from the ICU for patients with an ICU stay of \u226528 but <60 days.\n\n\u2022 Evaluations will be carried out on day 28 and day 60 for patients with an ICU stay of \u226560 days.\n\nAny patient that leaves the ICU will be considered to have exited the study. Any readmission into the ICU (even within 60 days following the trauma) will not be taken into account.

Patient enrolment will be decided by the attending physicians.\n\nA computer-generated numbered list was provided by a statistician not involved in either screening patients or the assessment of outcomes. Randomisation will be carried out using a secure web-based randomisation system with stratification by centre and severity of unconsciousness at the time of inclusion (Glasgow Coma scale <8 or \u22658), to account for 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   17   differences in patient treatment between centres and the heightened VAP risk in patients with a Glasgow Coma scale lower than 8. Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) into one of the two treatment groups, based on the method used to monitor tracheal cuff pressure.\n\nMasking of the participants and ICU staff will not be feasible due to the nature of the device, which is placed closed to the patient's face. However, the microbiologists that test the pulmonary and blood samples, the outcome assessors (NM and OM) and the statisticians will be masked to the group assignment.\n\nIndependent clinical research assistants are available at each participating hospital to help with running the study and data collection.

Any prophylactic or curative antibiotic therapy related to the trauma will not be considered.\n\nThe VFD and AFD will be assessed in the same manner, and will be compared between groups using regression models that allow adjustment for stratification factors. The other categorical secondary endpoints will be compared between groups using logistic regression models. Statistical analyses will all be conducted using SAS 9.3 software.\n\nMissing data will be described as the number and corresponding percentage for each group.\n\nThe presence of any imbalance in the proportion of missing data between treatment groups will be evaluated using logistic regression models. To assess the robustness of the results in the case of missing data, sensitivity analyses will be performed with imputation of missing data (worst value such as failure, death, etc.) and multiple imputation.\n\nClinical research associates will ensure that patient inclusion, data collection, registry and rapport are in line with the protocol, and that the study is conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Furthermore, he or she will verify the following variables:\n\npatient initials, date of birth, sex, signed consent form, eligibility criteria, date of randomisation, treatment assignment, adverse events, and study endpoints.\n\nThe clinical trial will be carried out in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki \n\nPrior consent of the subject will not be possible; therefore, consent of the subject's legally acceptable representative will be requested. A consent form specifically designed for the subject's legally acceptable representative will be provided with documented approval or favourable opinion of the institutional review board in order to protect the rights, safety and wellbeing of the subject and to ensure compliance with any applicable regulatory requirements. Non-objection to participation in the study by the patient's relatives will be solicited, according to the requirements of the ethics committee.\n\nPeople with direct access to the data will take all necessary precautions to maintain confidentiality. All data collected during the study will be rendered anonymous. Only initials and inclusion number will be registered.\n\nThe results of the study will be released to the participating physicians, referring physicians and medical community no later than 1 year after the completion of the trial, through presentation at scientific conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health under number 13-0054. Funder will not have role in the study's conception or in the data analysis.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to evaluate the usefulness of continuous pneumatic regulation of tracheal cuff pressure in a population of severe trauma patients, who will also benefit from other recommended VAP preventive measures. At an individual level, the benefits are expected to include reduced duration of mechanical ventilation and stay in the ICU, as well as improved patient prognosis. At a collective level, a In order to keep management practices as standardised as possible, we decided to limit the number of investigating centres to 15 university hospital centres (CHU), all of which are recognised in the field of trauma care and treat more than 50 severe trauma patients per\n\nyear. These centres belong to three networks that share the common objective of promoting In the present study, no additional risk will be incurred by the study participants in terms of the usual therapy received during their hospital stay. Patients will be cared for as usual by their attending physicians. No supplementary examination will be imposed by the protocol.\n\nAs the patient will be unable to hear the given information, information regarding the study will be delivered to his or her close relatives or friends. In accordance with the directives of the French national commission for data protection and liberties, the patient will be afforded the possibility of objecting to the use of data gathered in his or her name. Another limitation of this study is that masking is not feasible due to the nature of the intervention. However, the endpoints will be assessed by two assessors that are masked to the group assignment in order to minimise bias.\n\nThe trial is currently in progress, and the inclusion process started in July 2015. At the time of manuscript submission 229 patients had been included. The first patient was included 2 days after registration of the study on ClinicalTrials.gov. We estimate that the last patient will be recruited in January 2018.\n\nIn conclusion, this trial is the first multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label study adequately powered to test the hypothesis that a continuous pneumatic regulation of tracheal cuff pressure prevents ventilator-associated pneumonia in mechanically ventilated severe trauma patients. \n\nWe thank all physicians, nursing staff and clinical research associates of the participating centers for their participation in this study.\n\nOM conceived the study, coordinated its design and drafted the manuscript. \n\nFrench Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

Statistical analyses will take into account the 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The categorical variables will be reported as numbers and percentages, while continuous variables will be summarised using means (\u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) or medians (interquartile range [IQR]) for normally and non-normally distributed data, along with their respective 95% confidence intervals.\n\nAnalyses of the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints related to VAP incidence will use logistic regression models adjusted for stratification factors and covariates significantly imbalanced between groups.\n\nThe cumulative event curves (time until first VAP diagnosis) will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier procedure.\n\nThe number of ventilator-free days (VFD) is the number of days for which the patient is successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation until the endpoint at day 28 (or day 60).\n\nThis is defined as follows: VFD = 0 for patients that died within 28 (or 60) days or required mechanical ventilation for 28 (or 60) or more days; VFDs = (28 [or 60] -x) for patients that were successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation within 28 (or 60) days, where x is the number of days on mechanical ventilation.\n\nThe number of antibiotic-free days (AFD) is the number of days that the living patient did not receive antibiotics over 28 (or 60) days. Any prophylactic or curative antibiotic therapy related to the trauma will not be considered.\n\nThe VFD and AFD will be assessed in the same manner, and will be compared between groups using regression models that allow adjustment for stratification factors.

Statistical analyses will all be conducted using SAS 9.3 software.\n\nMissing data will be described as the number and corresponding percentage for each group.\n\nThe presence of any imbalance in the proportion of missing data between treatment groups will be evaluated using logistic regression models. To assess the robustness of the results in the case of missing data, sensitivity analyses will be performed with imputation of missing data (worst value such as failure, death, etc.) and multiple imputation.\n\nClinical research associates will ensure that patient inclusion, data collection, registry and rapport are in line with the protocol, and that the study is conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Furthermore, he or she will verify the following variables: patient initials, date of birth, sex, signed consent form, eligibility criteria, date of randomisation, treatment assignment, adverse events, and study endpoints.\n\nThe clinical trial will be carried out in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nPrior consent of the subject will not be possible; therefore, consent of the subject's legally acceptable representative will be requested. A consent form specifically designed for the subject's legally acceptable representative will be provided with documented approval or favourable opinion of the institutional review board in order to protect the rights, safety and wellbeing of the subject and to ensure compliance with any applicable regulatory requirements. Non-objection to participation in the study by the patient's relatives will be solicited, according to the requirements of the ethics committee.\n\nPeople with direct access to the data will take all necessary precautions to maintain confidentiality. All data collected during the study will be rendered anonymous. Only initials and inclusion number will be registered.\n\nThe results of the study will be released to the participating physicians, referring physicians and medical community no later than 1 year after the completion of the trial, through presentation at scientific conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 In the present study, no additional risk will be incurred by the study participants in terms of the usual therapy received during their hospital stay. Patients will be cared for as usual by their attending physicians. No supplementary examination will be imposed by the protocol.\n\nAs the patient will be unable to hear the given information, information regarding the study will be delivered to his or her close relatives or friends. In accordance with the directives of the French national commission for data protection and liberties, the patient will be afforded the possibility of objecting to the use of data gathered in his or her name.\n\nThe incidence of VAP is the primary endpoint of this trial; however, VAP diagnosis may be difficult to perform in the ICU. Because, mouth care and stress ulcer prophylaxis are based on local written protocols, they may act as potential confounding variables. However, this will be controlled by the stratification of the randomization at the centre level and adjustment of statistical analyses in cases of differences between groups.\n\nFinally, masking is not feasible due to the nature of the intervention. However, the endpoints will be assessed by two assessors masked to the group assignment in order to minimise bias. \n\nThe trial is currently in progress, and the inclusion process started in July 2015. At the time of manuscript submission 229 patients had been included. The first patient was included 2 days after registration of the study on ClinicalTrials.gov. We estimate that the last patient will be recruited in January 2018. \n\nWe thank all physicians, nursing staff and clinical research associates of the participating centers for their participation in this study.\n\nOM conceived the study, coordinated its design and drafted the manuscript. \n\nFrench Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
