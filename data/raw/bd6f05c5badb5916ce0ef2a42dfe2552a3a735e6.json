{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Evolutionary genetics of canine respiratory coronavirus and recent introduction into Swedish dogs", "body": "Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) complex, colloquially referred to as kennel cough, is a contagious disease in dogs, particularly prolific in rehoming centers and kennels. Dogs suffer from a dry hacking cough, which is usually cleared in 1-3 weeks, however, severe bronchopneumonia can develop (Appel, 1987) . CIRD is a multifactorial disease with identified disease agents including canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) (Appel and Percy, 1970) , canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) (Ditchfield et al., 1962) , canine pneumovirus (Mitchell et al., 2013) , and the bacteria Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bemis, 1992) and Mycobacterium cynos (Mitchell et al., 2017) . More recently, canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) was also identified as a causative agent of CIRD. This virus was first identified in the UK in a rehoming center with a high incidence of CIRD (Erles et al., 2003) , however, a retrospective study has suggested that it may have circulated as early as 1996 in Canada (Ellis et al., 2005) . Additional surveys have identified antibodies in dogs in the UK, Ireland, Italy, Japan, and the US, with antibody prevalence as high as 87.7% in the state of Kentucky, USA (An et al., 2010b; Decaro et al., 2007; Erles and Brownlie, 2005; Knesl et al., 2009; Priestnall et al., 2006; Priestnall et al., 2007; Schulz et al., 2014) . A small number of isolates have also been sequenced and characterized (An et al., 2010a; Erles et al., 2007; Erles et al., 2003; Jeoung et al., 2014; Yachi and Mochizuki, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 closely related species or strains such as Sambaar deer coronavirus, Waterbuck coronavirus and human enteric coronavirus (HEC 4408), illustrating the proliferation of these BCoV-like viruses.\n\nIn this study, we screened nasopharyngeal swabs from privately-owned dogs in Sweden with and without CIRD for CRCoV. We identified the first CRCoV positive dogs from Sweden, and we used these to assess the evolutionary genetics of CRCoV, both locally and globally. Specifically, we wanted to determine genetic variation and quasispecies of CRCoV in Swedish dogs to clarify diversity within Sweden and the relationship of Swedish viruses to other CRCoV isolates in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nFurthermore, we aimed to understand the introduction of these viruses into Sweden by using timestructured phylogeny and recombination analysis. Finally, given the large number of CRCoV isolates sequenced in this study, we were able to better elucidate the emergence of CRCoV through analysis of recombination dynamics of CRCoV and BCoV.\n\nThis research was reviewed, approved and conducted in accordance with the regulations provided by the Swedish Board of Agriculture and approved by the Swedish Animal Research Ethics Board (Uppsala djurf\u00f6rs\u00f6ksetiska n\u00e4mnd, reference numbers C227/11 and C127/14).\n\nBetween April 2013 and December 2015, privately owned dogs with characteristic upper respiratory signs of CIRD (dry cough) for up to 7 days were enrolled in a study investigating the cause of CIRD in Sweden. Maximum two dogs per households were sampled, and sampled dogs were not treated by antibiotics at the sampling. Samples were taken from seven veterinary clinics across Sweden, with dogs residing in 12 Swedish counties (Fig 1) . Nasopharyngeal swabs (E-swabs with Amies medium and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 We used generalized linear models (glm, family = binomial) to evaluate the effect of age, breed, location, and sex on CRCoV prevalence. Explanatory variables were entered in isolation or in combination, where the resulting model improvements were \u03c7 2 tested for significance. Statistics were done in R 3.5.1 (R Development Core Team, 2008) integrated into R Studio 1.0.143.\n\nViral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs with the Magnatrix 8000+ extraction robot (Magnetic Biosolutions, Sweden) and Vet Viral NA kit (NorDiag ASA, Oslo, Norway), as described in (Jinnerot et al., 2015) . cDNA was subsequently synthesized using SuperScript\u2122 III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the second strand was synthesized using Klenow Fragment\u2122 3'->5' exo-(New England Biolabs, M0212S, Ipswich, MA, USA).\n\nFour approaches were utilized to sequence viruses. First, using traditional PCR and Sanger sequencing of the PCR products, and second, using Illumina MiSeq to sequence PCR products of partial S gene.\n\nThird, a viral metagenomics approach was done on two samples (CRCoV4 and CRCoV6) with the aim to get close to complete genomes. Lastly, a probe-based capture method was used on one sample (CRCoV1) (Table A1 ).\n\n2.4.1 Sanger Sequencing. For the first approach, PCR reactions targeting the S, Membrane (M) and\n\nHemagglutinin-esterase (HE) genes were carried out using previously published primers (An et al., 2010a; Erles et al., 2007) (Table A2 ) using KAPA2G Robust HotStart ReadyMix PCR Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Roche Sequencing, Pleasanton, CA, USA). Thermocycling conditions were 95\u00b0C for 3 minutes and then 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, a reaction specific annealing temperature for 15 seconds, a reaction specific elongation time at 72\u00b0C, and finally 72\u00b0C for 1 minute (Table S1 ). The PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with GelRed, visualized under UV transillumination (GelDoc, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Richmond, CA, USA), purified using GeneJet Gel Extraction Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and sequenced at Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, NL).\n\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Sp1F and Sp10R (Table A2) , and 3\u00b5l of template. Thermocycling conditions were 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds and then 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 64\u00b0C for 45 seconds, elongation time at 65\u00b0C for 220 seconds, and finally 65\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The PCR products were purified using the GenJET PCR 2.5.3 High-throughput sequencing of viral metagenomics prepared samples. The reads were assembled using MEGAHIT version 1.1.4 (Li et al., 2016) , with default settings. A taxonomic classification of the contigs using Diamond version 0.9.24 (Buchfink et al., 2015) against the non-redundant protein database from NCBI (nr, release February 2019) was then performed. The produced output files (daa format) were uploaded into MEGAN (version 6.12.6) (Huson et al., 2007) and all the contigs classified as Betacoronavirus 1 were extracted and inspected. The longest contigs were selected for further structural and functional annotation.\n\n2.5.4 Probe-based-capture. Reads were assembled using SPAdes (v 3.7.0) (Bankevich et al., 2012) but as the coverage was too high to get a correct assembly, the dataset was randomly reduced down to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2.5.5 Annotation. The CRCoV1, CRCoV4 and CRCoV6 genomes were annotated using an annotation pipeline for prokaryotic and viral genomes, PROKKA (Seemann, 2014) . We had previously extracted all the protein sequences belonging to the Coronaviridae family from UniProtKB (release April 2019).\n\nThis dataset was provided to PROKKA for annotating the newly assembled coronavirus genomes.\n\nAll generated sequences from this study have been deposited to the European Nucleotide Archive at EBI, under the BioProject PRJEB34079. High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) reads have been deposited in the EBI Short Read Archive (accession numbers: spike amplicons datasets: ERR3489845-ERR3489847, ERR3489112-ERR3489114, ERR3489104-ERR3489106. CRCoV1 probe-based capture dataset: ERR3486809, metagenomics datasets: CRCoV4: ERR3489103 and CRCoV6: ERR3489111).\n\nNucleotide Archive under the accession numbers: ERZ1079470 (CRCoV1), ERZ1079468 (CRCoV4), ERZ1079469 (CRCoV6). Full length genes generated through sanger sequencing have been deposited in European Nucleotide Archive, Accession numbers ERZ1080291 to ERZ1080310.\n\nResulting sequences were aligned using the MAFFT algorithm (Katoh et al., 2009) within Geneious R11 (Biomatters, New Zealand). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed for each gene (ORF1ab, hemagglutinin-esterase HE, S, and matrix M) using PhyML 3.0 (Guindon et al., 2010) implementing the best substitution model for each gene.\n\nFor the full length S gene, we utilized BEAST 1.8 (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007) to better infer the evolutionary relationship within CRCoVs. Shortly, we used Maximum Likelihood trees constructed in MEGA 6 to test for clock-like behavior in each data set by performing linear regressions of root-to-tip distances across years of sampling in TempEst (Rambaut et al., 2016) . Using BEAST, time-stamped data were analyzed using both the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed and strict molecular clock, the SRD06 codon position model -a HKY85 substitution model and a different rate of nucleotide substitution for the 1+2 codon position and the 3 rd codon position (Bahl et al., 2013; Shapiro et al., 2006) . We implemented the Bayesian Skyline coalescent tree prior. Three independent analyses of 50 million generations were performed and convergence assessed using Tracer 1.6. Independent runs were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f combined in LogCombiner v1.8 following a burnin of 10%. Maximum credibility clade trees were generated using TreeAnnotator v1.8. The maximum credibility clade trees were visualized in FigTree v1.4.3.\n\nTo assess recombination, a concatenated sequence was generated including the viruses from which there were sequences from the partial Non-structural protein 2a (NS), and full length HE, S, envelope (E), and M, resulting in 6541bp for analysis and the genes were placed in genomic order. To assess evolutionary patterns of all segments a splitstree network was constructed with CRCoV as well as BCoV outgroups using SplitsTree4 (Huson and Bryant, 2006) . Splitstree builds a network which takes recombination into account. To better understand the recombination process, the concatenated alignment was used in RPD4 to estimate break points (Martin et al., 2010) . Specifically, we used the algorithms RDP (Martin and Rybicki, 2000) and BOOTSCAN (Martin et al., 2005) to detect the recombination window, and used additional algorithms within RPD4 to cross reference support for the detected window.\n\nTo understand genetic variation within each sample, we utilized sequences of the partial spike gene generated using Illumina MiSeq of nine samples. The amplicon sequenced ranged from position 1630 to the 3' end (4092) of the spike gene, so variants were only studied in this 3' region. The genetic variant population was estimated using a combination of both ShoRAH version 1.0 (Zagordi et al., 2011) and QuasiRecomb version 2.1 (Topfer et al., 2013) with default parameters. We used a combination of both to ensure the accuracy of the SNPs found.\n\nA total of 108 dogs were sampled as part of this study, comprising 88 dogs with signs of disease and 20 healthy dogs. Thirteen samples collected from dogs with signs of disease were positive for CRCoV (14.7%, 8.4-23 .7% [95% confidence interval (CI)]), and were collected from dogs living in the counties of Stockholm (4/22), Sk\u00e5ne (3/17), V\u00e4stmanland (3/14), V\u00e4sternorrland (2/8) and Dalarna (1/1) (Fig 1) .\n\nNone of the healthy dogs tested positive for CRCoV. Overall prevalence of CRCoV did not vary significantly by dog clinic (X 2 =11.95, df=7, p=0.1022) or county from which dogs originated (X 2 =13.194, df=11, p=0.2809) . There was further no statistical difference across dog breed (X 2 =3.037, df=1, p=0.08137), sex (X 2 =3.8, df=1, p=0.0504), or age category (X 2 =6.778, df=3, p=0.07932) (Fig J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f A1). The largest number of positive samples were detected in winter months (n=8) compared to the autumn (n=1) and spring (n=5); no positive samples were detected in the summer. Despite this detection difference, prevalence of CRCoV was not significantly different across season (X 2 =6.83, df=3, p=0.075) (Fig A1) .\n\nUsing probe-based capture one complete genome was generated (CRCoV1). The complete genome of CRCoV1 was 31190bp and following annotation 9 coding regions were predicted: Orf1a, Orf1ab, Nonstructural protein 2a, HE, S, 12.8kDa non-structural protein, E, M and Nucleoprotein (NP) ( Figure A2 ). This full genome now brings the number of complete CRCoV genomes to 3 [CRCoV-K37 (An et al., 2010a) and CRCoV-BJ232 (Lu et al., 2017) ]. Viral metagenomics resulted in partial genomes of CRCoV4 and CRCoV6 covering 7933bp and 16085bp, respectively. Following annotation of the CRCoV4 genome, 6 coding regions were predicted: a partial gene coding for the HE, and all full genes coding for: S, 12.8kDa non-structural protein, E, M and the NP. Annotation of the CRCoV6 genome predicted a partial ORF1ab gene and all the remaining genes located between ORF1ab and the 3' end of the genome. Of the remaining viruses, 1-3 genes were sequenced through a combination of Sanger sequencing and Illumina high-throughput sequencing (Table A1) .\n\nAssessment of the S, E, M, NS2 and HE genes generated using Sanger and high-throughput sequencing (Table A1 ) demonstrated high genetic similarity of viruses detected in Swedish dogs, despite sampling from numerous clinics across Sweden and an over a period of 3 years. Indeed, all samples for all genes were within 99% identity (Fig A3) . Phylogenetic reconstruction of the larger genes (S, HE and M) indicates that Swedish viruses are most closely related to a CRCoV isolated in Italy in 2005 (EU999954), and in some trees CRCoV isolated in the UK in 2003 (DQ682406) (Fig A4) . Given discordance between trees, we constructed a consensus tree from a concatenated alignment using Splitstree, suggesting that all Swedish viruses are likely the result of a single introduction and despite recombination being a common feature in CRCoV's, are most similar to the two aforementioned viruses (Fig 4, Fig A4) . Time-structured phylogenetic analysis of the S gene suggests that the most recent common ancestor of all Swedish CRCoVs was introduced to Sweden at the beginning of 2010\n\n[2010.152 with a confidence interval ranging from 2004.035-2012.697], with subsequence proliferation within Sweden (Fig 2) . As suggested with previous analysis, the viruses isolated in Sweden are most closely related to an isolate from Italy, but not necessarily the UK, and that CRCoVs found in Europe may have emerged and been introduced from Asia. However, due to the sparseness of sequences, we have not undertaken phylogeographic analysis, and these observations should be interpreted with caution.\n\nLargely, CRCoV and BCoV form independent lineages in phylogenetic analysis, and large number of Swedish sequences in each tree help to better define the CRCoV clade. This lineage separation is most evident in the S tree (Fig A4C) , where all CRCoVs form a clade that is different from BCoV. However, CRCoV does not always fall into a distinctive clade; some genes like the HE and M of some isolates are more closely related to BCoV sequences than CRCoV. This was not the case with the viruses from Sweden, which are very similar to each other, and more distantly related to BCoV than other CRCoV sequences ( Fig S2A, Fig 3) . When assessing pairwise identity, it is clear that the percentage identity of all global CRCoVs only ( Fig A3B) and a combination of all CRCoV and BCoV sequences (Fig A3C) for the partial NS, HE and the complete M gene is rather similar. This is in contrast to the S gene, where percentage identity of all CRCoVs ranges from 99-100% whereas when including BCoV outgroups the range is from 97.5-99%. This is because for many genes, viruses from Korea (K9, K37, K39) and a recent sequence from China which were mined from GenBank are more similar to BCoV than to CRCoVs detected in Europe (Fig 4A) . Recombination detection algorithms detect that there is indeed a recombination event in these previously described Korean and Chinese viruses, where the NS, HE, E and M sequence is more similar to BCoV than to other CRCoV sequences (Region probability with MC correction: 0.002691556) ( Table A3 ). The breakpoint, represented by the end of the HE gene and start of the S gene, has a high probability (0.008164); however, the certainty of the breakpoint at the end of the S gene is undetermined due to a number of potential breakpoints (Fig A5) , which is revealed in the BOOTSCAN analysis. This is because all CRCoVs, but especially the Asian CRCoVs, have higher signal for BCoV at the end of the S gene ( Fig 4B) . Whether this is due to recombination within the S gene, or due to evolutionary processes of conservation in this section of the S gene, is unclear given some similarity between Swedish CRCoV and BCoV in this region as well. Regardless, To better understand the variation within each CRCoV virus detected in Sweden, partial spike amplicon high-throughput sequencing of all CRCoV isolates except CRCoV1, 4 and 8 were analysed for variations with 2 different methods: ShoRAH and QuasiRecomb. Overall, ShoRAH identified more Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) compared to QuasiRecomb (Fig 5) , however approximately half of the SNVs predicted by ShoRAH were also predicted by QuasiRecomb (except for the insertions/deletions that are only predicted by ShoRAH). Furthermore, regardless of method, most of the SNVs observed were at a frequency lower than 0.1. There was variation in SNV's across samples.\n\nThere were no variants identified in CRCoV5 with either method. In contrast, CRCoV10 contained 17 different SNV's. CRCoV7 and CRCoV12 had marked different pattern depending on method used, whereby SNV's were identified with ShoRAH but not with QuasiRecomb due to differences in detection of indels. There are no positions of SNVs that are common to all samples. Only one SNV was common to CRCoV3 and CRCoV9 (position 2807). This variation analysis suggests that the studied region of the S gene is not variable among the CRCoV isolates collected from Swedish dogs.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to reveal the epidemiology and evolutionary genetics of CRCoV, one of the causative agents of canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD), in Sweden. CIRD is a major cause of morbidity in dogs and an important animal welfare condition. This disease is multi-factorial, and a recent European survey reported that CRCoV, canine pneumovirus and the bacteria Mycoplasma cynos, besides the previously established main causes (mainly CPIV and B. bronchiseptica), all played a role in the disease (Mitchell et al., 2017) . To date, the highest prevalence of CRCoV remains in rehoming centres (Erles and Brownlie, 2005; Erles et al., 2003; Mitchell et al., 2017) , or other instances where dogs may be cohoused, such as in racing greyhounds (Sowman et al., 2018) . Epidemiology is unclear in pet dogs, such as those sampled in our study, but we predict that occasions where many dogs meet (e.g. dog day-care centres, dog shows and other activities), are likely contributing to spread, similarly to other CIRD-causing pathogens. Overall, we found that 13% of pet dogs with signs of CIRD in a split, which is a collection of sequence differences that separates one group of sequences from another. Non-tree like evolution is expected to be from recombination. The distance between taxa represents the sum of weights of all splits that separate taxa. QuasiRecomb. The position refers to the position of the spike gene, and only the region from 1500-4000bp is shown given this was the region amplicon sequenced. Each sample is represented by a unique colour code.\n\nSupplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version. Journal Pre-proof "}
