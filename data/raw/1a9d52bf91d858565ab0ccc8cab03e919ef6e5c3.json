{"title": "High incidence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, Chongqing, China", "body": "WHO has announced on March 11 in Switzerland that SARS-CoV-2 has the characteristics of a global pandemic 1 . As of March 15, 2020, China has accumulated 81,048 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a mortality rate of 3.95 %, also, there is a total of 64322 cases expect China, with a mortality rate of 3.51% 1,2 . The proportion of asymptomatic patients has gradually increased 3 . Asymptomatic patients are still highly contagious, paying special attention to the epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic patients is of great significance for the control of the epidemic. \n\nThe clinical data of 167 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients treated in\n\nChongqing Public Health Medical Center from January 2020 to March 2020 were collected. COVID-19 is diagnosed according to the WHO Interim Guidelines 6 . The severity of COVID -19 was defined according to the American Thoracic Society's Community Acquired Pneumonia Guidelines 7 . A confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive result on RT-PCR assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Public Health Medical Treatment Center (NO.2020-018-01-KY), informed consent was allowed to be waived.\n\nWe reviewed and analyzed the clinical files, radiologic and laboratory results of all 167 patients. All data are completed through independent survey forms to ensure that they do not interfere with each other. At the same time, three investigators complete the data collection and management to ensure the independence, completeness and authenticity of the data.\n\nThe detection of SARS-CoV-2 was determined based on new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan developed by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China. All the patients performed the RT-PCR assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection 8 . Radiologic and laboratory detection of all patients were completed according to normal inspection procedures.\n\nStatistical Analysis Data in the full text are expressed as median, mean \u00b1 SD, or percentage. The missing data are not counted. Statistical analysis in this study were conducted with SPSS 25.0.\n\nThere were 22 patients with severe COVID-19, and the proportion of severe Table 2 for the detailed data. .

Most of the asymptomatic patients did not show typical and abnormal clinical characteristics, radiologic and laboratory indexes, only 1 (5%) had myocardial injury. In particular, some of the asymptomatic patients also had atypical changes in the radiologic indexes, which were not the diagnostic criterion of Covid-19, such as bronchiectasis, general inflammatory changes in the lung, etc. For the asymptomatic patients over the age of 70, there were 2 (66.67%) patients with ground-glass opacity in radiologic examination.\n\nAll the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were treated according to the new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan developed by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China. At present, all the patients have recovered. For the asymptomatic patients, compared with the mild and common Covid-19 patient, the hospital length of stay in children group was prolonged (16.5 days vs 9.8 days).

However, the hospital length of stay may be shorten due to decreased toxicity during transmission. In addition, the mean latency was long in children and older group(10.8 days, 11.3 days). Overall, the hospital length of stay increases with age. This suggests that in the process of epidemic prevention and control, special attention needs to be paid to children and elderly people.\n\nSee Table 4 for the detailed data. .

As the epidemic develops, the proportion of asymptomatic patients is getting higher and higher (up to 19% in the onset after February 1 st , 2020). The mean latency of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was prolonged (10.5 days), but the hospital length of stay was shortened (14.3 days).\n\nAll countries have adopted isolation measures for imported populations from areas or countries with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and treated patients with symptoms who have a history of contact with this imported population 1 . However, a large number of asymptomatic patients with contact history with imported cases failed to be included in the focus surveillance. Our study shows for the first time that asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have a contact history with imported case account for a large proportion. Therefore, the next stage of SARS-CoV-2 prevention and control needs to focus on the screening of asymptomatic patients in the community with a history of contact with the imported population, especially for children and the elderly. \n\nWe declare no competing interests.\n\n.
