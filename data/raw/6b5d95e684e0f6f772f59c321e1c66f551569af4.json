{"title": "Tracking the engraftment and regenerative capabilities of transplanted lung stem cells using fluorescent nanodiamonds", "body": "Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen) containing 100 units\u00b7ml -1 penicillin and 100 \u00b5g\u00b7ml -1 streptomycin. They were minced with a razor blade and then dissociated by incubating overnight at 4 \u00b0C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 0.1% protease type-XIV (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 mg\u00b7ml -1 DNase I (AppliChem). Proteolytic digestion was quenched with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in DMEM. Media with tissue were pipetted several times to release pulmonary cells and then filtered through a 100-\u00b5m nylon cell strainer.\n\nLSC isolation and expansion. Cells dissociated from pulmonary tissues were suspended in ice-cold red blood cell lysis buffer. Live cells were recovered and incubated on ice for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 3% FBS and an optimally pretitrated mixture of antibodies including R-phycoerythrin (R-PE)-conjugated anti-CD157 (BD Bioscience), fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD54 (BD Bioscience), allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-CD45 (eBioscience), fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD31 (eBioscience) and relevant isotype controls for labeling. Next, labeled cells were washed, resuspended in staining buffer containing propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma-Aldrich), and subsequently analyzed and isolated by using a FACSAria flow cytometric system (BD Bioscience). Isolated LSCs were seeded at a density of 5 \u00d7 10 4 cells\u00b7ml -1 in a collagen I-coated plate in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% insulin-transferring-selenium (ITS) (Invitrogen), and 10 ng\u00b7ml -1 epithelial growth factor (EGF) (Invitrogen). Cultures were incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 for cell attachment and expansion. For differentiation studies, attached cells were incubated in MCDB201 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 1% FBS, 1% ITS, and 10 ng\u00b7ml -1 EGF.\n\nImmunofluorescence staining. Isolated LSCs and cultured LSCs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized and blocked with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS for 2 h. Afterwards, cells were incubated at 4 \u00b0C with the primary antibodies against antigens including SP-C, Aqp-5, cytokeratin-7 (all from Millipore), CCSP, Oct-4, vWF (all from Santa Cruz), CD54, CD157 (both from BD Bioscience), and biotinylated isolectin (Vector Laboratories). After overnight incubation, cells were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the respective FITC-or Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were then counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Photomicrographs of the stained cells were immediately taken with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. FND production. FNDs were produced by radiation damage of diamond powders (Micron+MDA 0-0.10, Element Six) using a 40-keV He + beam at a dose of ~2 \u00d7 10 13 ions\u00b7cm -2 , followed by thermal annealing in vacuum at 800 \u00b0C for 2 h, as detailed previously 6 . Freshly prepared FNDs were then oxidized in air at 450 \u00b0C for 1 h to remove graphitic surface carbon, purified in concentrated H 2 SO 4 -HNO 3 (3:1, v/v) solution at 100 \u00b0C in a microwave reactor (Discover BenchMate, CEM) for 3 h, and extensively rinsed and suspended in water. The final size of the particles was determined by dynamic light scattering to be ~100 nm.\n\nFND labeling. Isolated LSCs were cultured through several passages and seeded at a density of 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells\u00b7ml -1 in a collagen I-coated plate in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% ITS, and 10 ng\u00b7ml -1 EGF, and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 for cell attachment. Following a previously reported protocol 7 , FND labeling media were first prepared by adding bare FND particles into serum-free DMEM at different concentrations. After sonication for 30 min to ensure complete dispersion of FNDs, 1 ml of the medium was pipetted into each well of a 6-well plate containing the cells. The FND labeling proceeded for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 , after which cells were washed three times with PBS to remove free FNDs. Extents of the labeling were analyzed by using a FACSAria flow cytometer equipped with a 594-nm laser through a 670LP emission filter in the far-red channel.\n\nConfocal fluorescence microscopy and FLIM. Confocal fluorescence images of FND-labeled LSCs were acquired by using a SP5 inverted microscope (Leica) equipped with three continuous-wave solid-state lasers operating separately at 561, 488, and 405 nm for the excitation of FND, FITC, and DAPI, respectively. Fluorescence was collected through an oil-immersion objective (100\u00d7, NA 1.4) and detected with either a photomultiplier tube (PMT) for FITC and DAPI or an avalanche photodiode (APD) for FNDs. To conduct time-gated fluorescence imaging with the microscope featuring an FLIM system, an external frequency-doubled picosecond Nd:YAG laser (IC-532-30, High Q Laser), operating at 532 nm with a pulse width of 7 ps and a repetition rate of 50 MHz, was coupled into the Leica microscope through a single-mode optical fiber. Fluorescence was collected through a 63\u00d7 oil-immersion objective and detected with APD at the wavelength of 650 ~ 850 nm using a bandpass filter (Chroma OS019606-HQ750/210m).\n\nA time-correlated single-photon counting system (Pico-Harp 300, Pico Quant) measured the fluorescence lifetimes, from which time-gated images were obtained with the SymPhoTime software.\n\nIn vivo tracking. Mouse LSCs were labeled with FNDs for 4 h at 100 \u00b5g\u00b7ml -1 . After washing away excess FNDs, 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells in 100 \u00b5l PBS were i.v. injected into adult mice (4 weeks old) through tail veins. Mice were maintained until being sacrificed on day 1, 4, and 7 (n = 3 per group), after which organs were collected for subsequent analyses. Lung and kidney tissues were digested with protease, and liver and spleen tissues were homogenized in PBS. A FACSAria flow cytometer analyzed the released cells. For fluorescence imaging, tissues were first fixed in 10% formalin overnight and then embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Five-micrometer sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and incubated in blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBS for 2 h). Sections were stained by H&E or incubated overnight with antibodies against antigens including F4/80 (eBioscience), CCSP and pan-cytokeratin (both from Santa Cruz), and then washed. Afterwards, immunohistochemical analyses were performed with a peroxidase detection kit (Vector Laboratories) using diaminobenzene as the substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions. All sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Images of lung tissues after H&E staining or immunostaining were acquired by using a bright-field scanner (Aperio Digital Pathology System) and a 40\u00d7 objective.\n\nIn separate experiments with lung injury models (n = 3 per group), naphthalene (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in Mazola corn oil and injected intraperitoneally at 275 mg\u00b7kg -1 into sex-matched adult (4 weeks old) CD-1 \u00ae (ICR) mice. FND-labeled LSCs were then administered at 52 h after the naphthalene treatment and subsequently analyzed following the same procedures as described above. All assays were repeated in triplicate. Figure S1 . a, FACS analysis of pulmonary cells prepared by proteolytic disaggregation of neonatal lung tissue using CD45 and CD31 markers, compared with their corresponding concentration-matched isotype controls. b,c, Immunofluorescence staining of sorted CD45 -CD54 + CD157 + cells (b) and CD45 -CD54 + CD157cells (c) with the von Willebrand factor (vWF) and isolectin endothelial markers (DAPI in blue, vMF and isolectin in green). Scale bars, 50 \u00b5m. The data shown are representative images from three independent experiments. Figure S2 . FACS analysis of the sorted CD45 -CD54 + CD157 + subpopulation for the co-expression of CD49f (\u03b16-integrin), EpCAM, and CD24 markers, compared with their corresponding isotype controls. Experiments were repeated in triplicate. Figure S3 . Immunofluorescence staining of the CD45 -CD54 + CD157 + cells at the time of isolation using Oct-4 and Nanog (red), and CK-7, CCSP, SP-C, and Aqp-5 (green) markers, compared with their corresponding isotype controls. Cell nuclei were stained in blue by DAPI. The green fluorescence background is negligible in all isotype controls, indicating that neither non-specific labeling nor cell autofluorescence is a confounding factor in the immunofluorescence analysis. Scale bar, 10 \u00b5m. Experiments were repeated in triplicate. Figure S4 . Images of isotype control antibody labeled cells for the CK-7 (cytokeratin-7), CCSP, SP-C, and Aqp-5 markers before and after differentiation of the CD45 -CD54 + CD157 + cells for 7 days. The cells were examined under the same conditions as the primary antibody labeled cells in Figures 1, 2c, and 2d . Cell nuclei were stained in blue by DAPI. The green fluorescence background is negligible in all four control experiments, indicating that neither non-specific labeling nor cell autofluorescence is a confounding factor in the immunofluorescence analysis. Scale bar, 50 \u00b5m. Experiments were repeated in triplicate. Figure S5 . Bright-field and immunofluorescence images of the CD45 -CD54 + CD157 + cells after 10 days of culture in DMEM and then staining with the anti-Oct-4 (red), anti-Nanog (red), anti-cytokeratin (green), and anti-CCSP (green) markers. Scale bar, 50 \u00b5m. Experiments were repeated in triplicate. Figure S6 . Uptake of FNDs by LSCs after 4 h of incubation with the particles at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . The mean fluorescence intensity of the FND-labeled cells, as measured by flow cytometry, increased steadily with the particle concentration and reached a plateau at 100 \u00b5g\u00b7ml -1 . Error bars represent standard deviations of three independent measurements. Figure S7 . Flow cytometric analysis of the lung, kidney, liver, and spleen tissues harvested from uninjured mice. The data were collected on day 1 after i.v. injection of saline (control) and FND-labeled LSCs (FND-LSC) into the mice (n = 3 per group). Figure S8 . Flow cytometric analysis of the lung tissues harvested from uninjured mice. The data were collected on day 1, 4, and 7 after i.v. injection of saline (control) and FND-labeled LSCs (FND-LSC) into the mice (n = 3 per group). Figure S9 . a, Flow cytometry and b-f, fluorescence microscopy analyses of the lung tissues harvested from uninjured mice. The data in (a) were collected on day 1 after i.v. injection of LSCs co-labeled with CFSE and FND into uninjured mice. The FITC + Far-red + double positive cells represent LSCs labeled with both markers. The percentage of the FITC + Far-red + population among all viable cells is up to 2.5%. Images shown in (b \u2212 f) were acquired for the same lung tissue section using confocal fluorescence microscopy (b \u2212 d), FLIM (e), and time-gated fluorescence imaging with \u03c4 = 9 \u2212 18 ns (f). The wavelengths of the light used to acquire the images of DAPI, CFSE, and FND were 405 nm (b), 488 nm (c), and 561 nm (d), respectively. White arrows indicate FNDs. Note that no CFSE-labeled cells could be identified in (c), whereas gating of the fluorescence signals at the time longer than 9 ns allows clear identification of the FND-labeled cells in (e) and (f). Scale bar, 50 \u00b5m. Experiments were repeated in triplicate."}
