{"title": "Expedient synthesis and biological evaluation of alkenyl acyclic nucleoside phosphonate prodrugs", "body": "The ProTide approach, pioneered by Chris Mcguigan's group, 1,2 is a powerful technology aimed to optimize intracellular drug delivery and circumvent metabolic bottlenecks in the activation of nucleoside-based antiviral and anticancer drugs. In the last years this technology has displayed a great deal of success in the antiviral field with two compounds in the market: the phosphoramidate Sofosbuvir 3,4 (Sovaldi\u00ae) approved in 2013 against HCV infections and the phosphonoamidate tenofovir alafenamide fumarate 5 (TAF, Vemlidy\u00ae) approved in 2015 for the treatment of HIV 6, 7 and later in 2016 for HBV infections 8, 9 (Fig. 1) .\n\nSeveral other ProTides have entered in clinical trials while many others are in preclinical evaluation either as antiviral or anticancer drugs. 2, 10, 11 Given the tremendous importance of phosphor(n)oamidate prodrugs in the antiviral arena and beyond, after the approval of Sofosbuvir and TAF, the application of the ProTide technology has grown dramatically and it has started to show very promising results in other therapeutic areas as well. [12] [13] [14] While there are several efficient procedures to synthesize phosphoroamidate nucleosides, the phosphonoamidate cognate class especially of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) lacks of such plethora of synthetic methodologies. 15 ANPs play a key role in the treatment of viral infections, and this class of compounds can be regarded as one of the most significant group of drugs in the antiviral field. 16, 17 Discovered almost 30 years ago, a great wealth of research has been dedicated to the development of efficient synthetic methodologies that resulted in a great variety of ANPs. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] These new structures offer a potential for the discovery of more effective drugs against a variety of infectious diseases including antiparasitic, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] antimicrobial, [30] [31] [32] [33] and antitubercolous 34, 35 medicines. Among these synthetic strategies, quite recently, Agrofoglio's group has elaborated a novel, efficient and straightforward synthesis of C5-alkenyl substituted ANPs via olefin cross-metathesis. [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] Although structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on acyclic nucleosides have not clarified their pharmacophore model, the introduction of a rigid structural element such as the double bond has proved to be extremely important for their antiviral activity. 43, 44 Precisely, the trans-alkene skeleton is able to mimic the three-dimensional geometry of the ribose ring maintaining also an electronic contribution similar to the one provided by the oxygen. 45 There are considerable evidences that the trans-alkenyl acyclic nucleotide motif has a strong affinity with recombinant human thymidylate kinase (hTMPK) active site, responsible for the nucleotide phosphorylation and consequently correlated to its antiviral activity. 41 Interestingly, Agrofoglio's group employed the olefin cross-metathesis methodology also for the direct synthesis of a vast array of unsaturated ANPs analogues including bis-POM, bis-POC, and alkoxyesters prodrugs. 36, [38] [39] [40] [41] 46, 47 Although adopting a different procedure, our group extended the range of prodrugs of (E)-but-2-enylpyrimidine, by synthesising their ProTide and bisamidate derivatives. 48 In this study we showed that the ProTide technology was able to broaden the spectrum of antiviral activity when compared to other phosphate prodrug approaches. However, we discovered that this methodology suffers from the limitation that only linear olefin must be employed, as with trisubstituted alkenyl derivatives we observed only formation of traces of the desired ProTides. This finding prompted us to investigate the possibility of using the cross-metathesis for the direct synthesis of unsaturated branched ANP phosphonoamidates. At the time we started this investigation, no application of such procedure for the synthesis of ProTides was yet reported. However, during the preparation of this manuscript, a paper reporting the use of the cross metathesis for the synthesis of ProTide derivatives of linear (E)-but-2enyl nucleoside scaffold, was published. 49 The prodrugs described in this work belong to the same family of compounds previously reported by us, 48 and indeed their antiviral profile was in agreement with our published results. In the present article, we would like to report an effective and improved methodology for the synthesis of allyl phosphonoamidate and their further application in olefin cross-metathesis for the synthesis of ANP ProTides. We also anticipate that our two-steps, one-pot methodology can also be applied to the synthesis of symmetrical allyl phosphonodiamidates. Compared with the recently published procedure, 49 our synthetic strategy presents some advantages which we believe, merit consideration.\n\nOur research began with the synthesis of the aryloxy allylphosphonoamidate synthon 3a, for which the only literature procedure available is a long and tedious multistep sequence. 50, 51 Based on our experience in the application of Holy's one-pot procedure for the direct synthesis of phosphonodiamidates, 52 we envisaged that this protocol could be used to get access to the desired synthon starting from the commercially available dimethyl allylphosphonate 1 (Scheme 1). This methodology was already adapted in our laboratory for the synthesis of adefovir and tenofovir phosphonoamidate prodrugs 53 and more recently for the preparation of (E)-but-2-enyl pyrimidine ProTides. 48 Briefly, commercial dimethyl allylphosphonate 1 was converted into the corresponding silyl ester 2, by reaction with an excess of bromotrimethylsilane (5.0 equivalents). Due to the hydrolytically instability of this ester, 2 was not isolated but immediately dissolved in a mixture of pyridine/Et 3 N and treated with the L-alanine isopropyl ester hydrochloride (1.0 equivalents), an excess of 1-naphthol (6.0 equivalents), and a premade solution of PPh 3 (6.0 equivalents) and aldrithiol-2 (6.0 equivalents) in pyridine. After 16 h, the crude mixture did not show the presence of either the desired product or phosphonodiamidate compound (which, based on our experience, is almost invariably formed). We attributed this lack of reactivity to the decomposition of the disilyl ester 2 caused by the release of hydrobromic acid, generated by the hydrolysis of the excess of TMSBr used. Pleasingly, when we attempted the reaction in the presence of 2,6-lutidine (4.0 equivalents) as acid scavenger, the formation of the desired product 3a was observed ( 31 P NMR and LC-MS analysis of the crude mixture). 3a was isolated by flash chromatography in excellent yield (79%) ( Table 1 , Entry 1). Quite surprisingly, no evidence of side reactions 48 (bromination of the double bond and formation of the phosphonodiamidate) have been observed.\n\nWith the above methodology, we prepared six different allyl phosphonate analogues 3a-f in which a variety of aryloxy groups were introduced in combination with two different amino acid esters (L-alanine isopropyl or benzyl esters). From Table 1 it can be appreciated that our method worked well with aryl alcohols with different steric requirements. In particular, we were able to prepare the allyl phosphonoamidates bearing the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-napthol 3e and 3f (Entries 5 and 6, Table 1 ), which have shown to impart remarkable antiviral activities in compounds of previous series. 48, 53 This procedure is short and efficient, representing an improvement of the literature method, which accounts for a 29% overall yield in four steps. 49 With these allyl phosphonoamidates in hand we began the synthesis of (E)-methylbut-2-enyl pyrimidine 6 and 7, selected as the other partner for the cross-metathesis reaction. These nucleosides and their bis-POM prodrugs were originally prepared by Agrofoglio and colleagues, 38 which found the latest to have moderate activities against feline herpes virus (FHV) and feline corona virus (FCoV). Considering that ProTides of alkenyl pyrimidine with \"linear\" (E)-but-2-enyl double bond have shown improved antiviral activities and a broad antiviral spectrum when compared to the corresponding bis-POM derivatives, we were now interested in investigating whether ProTide of branched alkenyl pyrimidine might have the same effect. We therefore synthesised a thymine and uracil derivative 6 and 7 as reported in Scheme 2. Amino acid ester hydrochloride (1.0 equiv), aryl-alcohol (6.0 equiv), Et 3 N (15.0 equiv), aldrithiol-2 (6.0 equiv), PPh 3 (6.0 equiv), pyridine, 50\u00b0C, 16 h. With both alkenyl derivatives in hand we were in the position to investigate the cross-metathesis conditions between the aryloxy allylphosphonoamidate synthon 3a and the olefin 6 as model reaction. First we employed the same CM conditions developed and used by Agrofoglio for the synthesis of the corresponding bis-POM alkenyl derivatives 38 . As expected we obtained a mixture of E/Z isomers of which the desired compound E-8a was afforded in 24% yield (Entry 1, Table 2 ). Both E-8a and Z-8a isomers were isolated by preparative reverse phase-HPLC and their configurations were confirmed by NOESY experiments. The homodimer 9 was formed along with the E/Z derivatives. Any attempt to improve the reaction outcome using different catalysts (Hoveyda-Grubbs 2nd generation catalyst (A), Grubbs 2nd generation catalyst (B) and Grubbs catalyst C859 (C) failed providing 8a in similar or lower yield and almost identical E/Z ratio (Entries 2-3, Table 2 ). Since catalyst A resulted the best in terms of product/ homodimer ratio further screening was conducted keeping A as catalyst. Prolonged reaction time (Entry 4, Table 2 ) resulted in a slightly increased yield that however, was not further improved with addition of more catalyst (Entry 5, Table 2 ,). These conditions are different from those reported by Agrofoglio in his recent paper, 49 where (E)-but-2-enyl pyrimidine ProTides were formed via cross metathesis only when water was used as solvent.\n\nUsing these conditions, we prepared different aryloxy phosphonoamidates of both thymine and uracil derivatives. The desired compounds E-8a-f and E-10a-f were isolated in moderate yields (Scheme 3, Table 3 ). In few cases Z-isomers (Z-8a, Z-8e, Z-8f, Z-10e) were also isolated in 1 to 7% yield (Scheme 3).\n\nPleased by the outcome of the above procedure, and to expand the versatility of this methodology, we decided to use the same reaction conditions to prepare the symmetrical phosphonodiamidate 12. Briefly, the desired bis-amidate intermediate 11 was obtained in 52% yield by treating the allyl phosphonate 1 with an excess of TMSBr (in presence of 4.0 equivalents of lutidine) and the resulting silyl diester reacted with an excess (5.0 equivalents) of L-alanine isopropyl hydrochloride (Scheme 4). Compound 11 was then subjected to olefin cross-metathesis reaction with compound 7 under the conditions reported in Scheme 4. Phosphonodiamidate 12 was obtained as a mixture of the E and Z isomers. The E-isomer was isolated in 2% yield, after purification by preparative reverse phase-HPLC.\n\nSince ruthenium catalyst was used during the synthesis, we were interested in measuring its residual amount in the final sample. ICP-MS experiment on compound E-10e showed ruthenium content of \n\nAll the ProTide derivatives synthesised were evaluated against a panel of DNA and RNA viruses as previously described. 48 None of the compounds were active against herpes simplex virus-1 (KOS) (HVS-1), herpes simplex virus-2 (G) (HVS-2), thymidine kinase deficient herpes simplex virus-1 (KOS Acyclovir-resistant strain) (TK -HSV-1), vaccinia virus (VV), adenovirus-2 (AV-2), human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) in HEL cells, parainfluenza-3 virus (HPIV-3), reovirus-1 (REO-1), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in HeLa cells, influenza A/H1N1, influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B in MDCK cells.\n\nAs shown in Table 4 , thymine derivatives E-8a-f showed weak antiviral activity against varicella-zoster virus (VZV TK + and TK -) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV AD-169 strain and Davis strain) with EC 50 ranging from 20 to 76 \u03bcM, whereas uracil derivatives E-10a-c were mostly inactive against these viruses with the exception of E-10a (EC 50 = 20 \u03bcM VZV TK + ) and E-10b (EC 50 = 58 \u03bcM VZV TK -). Interestingly uracil derivatives E-10e-f, bearing the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1napthol as aryl moiety, resulted slightly active against VZV both TK + and TKstrains, confirming once again the biological potential of this promoiety. No specific information about the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1naphtol LD 50 is reported in the literature as for phenol and 1-napthol. However, in previous studies 48, 53 we have shown that in an in vitro assay the CC 50 values of ANP ProTides bearing the 5,6,7,8 tehydro-1napthyl moiety have a comparable CC 50 values to those bearing phenol and 1-napthol. This is also observed in the presented studies. Remarkably, all the Z isomers isolated (Z-8a,e,f and Z-10e) showed to some extent antiviral activity against both AD-169 and Davis HCMV strains. Furthermore, compound Z-8e was found weakly active against Sindbis Virus (SINV), coxsackie virus B4, Punta Toro virus (PTV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) in Vero cells with EC 50 values in the range of 20-58 \u00b5M.\n\nNone of the compounds showed significant cytotoxicity. Being able to inhibit VZV, ProTides of allylphosphonate pyrimidine showed a broader antiviral activity than the corresponding bis-POM prodrugs, previously reported by Agrofoglio. 41 On the contrary linear alkenyl derivatives showing higher EC 50 against VZV perform better than those branched, suggesting that a more substituted double bond is detrimental for the antiviral activity.\n\nThe metabolic activation of phosphonoamidates follows the same two-enzymatic steps involved in the activation of the phosphoroamidates. 11 Although the use of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-naphthol as aryloxy group in the ProTides is quite recent we have shown its metabolic activation by carboxypeptidase Y in previous studies. 53 To prove the stability of this class of compound we have performed stability assays of compound E-8e, in rat and human sera, which indicate a suitable pharmacokinetic profile of the tested phosphonoamidate with a half-life higher than 12 h (Fig. 2 ).\n\nIn conclusion, we have successfully reported the one pot-two steps synthesis of a family of allyl phosphonoamidates. Our methodology is an important improvement of a recently reported strategy 49 that allows the synthesis of these substrate in a shorter synthetic sequence and with an overall higher yield. We also extended this protocol to the synthesis of hitherto unknown allyl phosphonodiamidate. We also proved that both synthons are capable to undergo alkene cross-metathesis with alkenyl functionalized uracil and thymine nucleobases although the yields need to be further optimized, especially in the case of phosphonodiamidates. These phosphonoamidate prodrugs were evaluated for their biological activity against a panel of DNA and RNA viruses. None of the compounds prepared, showed significant cytotoxicity. ProTides of allylphosphonate pyrimidine showed a broader antiviral activity than the corresponding bis-POM prodrugs against VZV infected cells. We have also demonstrated, once again, that the introduction of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl moiety into the ProTide scaffold is capable to increase the antiviral activity of the prodrug. Finally, not only the E-isomers showed some biological activity, but also all the Z isomers isolated (Z-8a,e,f and Z-10e) showed to some extent antiviral activity against both AD-169 and Davis HCMV strains. Further studies directed to the optimization of the cross metathesis procedure especially for the allyl phosphonoamidate, are currently in progress in our laboratory.\n\nAll solvents used were anhydrous and used as supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.

All nucleosides and solid reagents were dried for several hours under high vacuum prior to use. For analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC), precoated aluminium-backed plates (60F-54, 0.2 mm thickness; supplied by E. Merck AG, Darmstadt, Germany) were used and developed by an ascending elution method. For preparative thin-layer chromatography (prep TLC), preparative TLC plates (20 cm \u00d7 20 cm, 500-2000 \u03bcm) were purchased from Merck. After solvent evaporation, compounds were detected by quenching of the fluorescence, at 254 nm upon irradiation with a UV lamp. Column chromatography purifications were carried out by means of automatic Biotage Isolera One. Fractions containing the product were identified by TLC and pooled, \n\nEC 50 : 50% effective concentration or concentration required inhibiting viral induced cytopathic effect (HCMV, SINV, coxsackie virus B4, PTV and YFV) or plaque formation (VZV) by 50%.

All 31 P and 13 C NMR spectra were protondecoupled. Chemical shifts are given in parts per million (ppm) and coupling constants (J) are measured in Hertz (Hz). The following abbreviations are used in the assignment of NMR signals: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), bs (broad singlet), dd (doublet of doublet), ddd (doublet of doublet of doublet), dt (doublet of triplet). The assignment of the signals in 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR was done based on the analysis of coupling constants and additional twodimensional experiments (COSY, HSQC). Analytical High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed using both Spectra System SCM (with X-select-C18, 5 mm, 4.8 \u00d7 150 mm column) and Varian Prostar system (LCWorkstation-Varian Prostar 335 LC detector). Preparative HPLC was performed with Varian Prostar (with pursuit XRs C18 150 \u00d7 21.2 mm column). Low and high-resolution mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Daltonics MicroTof-LC system (atmospheric pressure ionization, electron spray mass spectroscopy) in positive mode. The \u226595% purity of the final compounds (E-8a-f, E-10a-f, Z-8a,e,f and Z-10e) was confirmed by HPLC analysis.\n\nIn a round bottom flask, under an argon atmosphere, 2,6-Lutidine (4 eq) and trimethylsilyl bromide (TMSBr, 5 eq) were added to a solution of dimethyl allylphosphonate (1 eq) in anhydrous acetonitrile (8 ml/mmol of allylphosphonate).
