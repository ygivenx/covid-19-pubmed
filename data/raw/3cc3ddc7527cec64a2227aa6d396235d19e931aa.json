Two siRNA strategies have been considered for activator of PKR (PACT), two cellular dsRNA binding proteins.\n\nHIV; the first is to target essential viral genes and the second is to target cellular genes required by HIV for replication (table I) . The multi-protein entity is shuttled through interaction with the argonaute 2 (Ago2) protein into an effector complex, the RNA-To date, HIV sequences that have been targeted include the induced silencing complex (RISC).

[29] In many of the above examples, it should be pointed out that instead of directly introducing siRNA duplexes into cells the effect of which is transient, in many cases, RNAi was expressed using a DNA plasmid expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA). It is recognized that the cell's Dicer enzyme can remove the hairpin loop from shRNA molecules, processing them to their siRNA counterparts. Currently, a myriad of systems are available for expressing shRNAs (e.g. under the control of an RNA polymerase III U6 or H1 promoter or an RNA polymerase II CMV promoter) in several vector systems (e.g. adenoviral or lentiviral vector [17, 41] ), allowing for long-term silencing even in nondividing cells.\n\nHIV-1 is a notoriously mutable virus. To be effective, antiviral drugs based on sequence hybridization must take into account that HIV-1 mutates its sequence easily. Indeed, HIV-1 can escape env, and TAR RNA.

Alternatively, the deletation of an siRNA recognition site that virion-associated HIV-1 genomic RNA that infects cells apcan also allow the virus to evade restriction.

[50] In addition, the viral RNA, TAR, [51] is also envisioned for in vivo use as human drugs. One anticipates that used by HIV-1 as a suppressor of RNAi. [52, 53] If siRNA-based methods and modifications that minimize off-target hybridization therapy of HIV-1 and other viruses is to be usefully contemplated, would need to be greatly improved to enable further siRNA drug one needs to consider strategies that address virus-encoded RNAi development. [64] suppressors. Despite virally encoded suppressors, there is ample Another unwelcome adverse effect of siRNA use is the potenevidence for RNAi-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 replication. It is tial to inappropriately elicit interferon and inflammatory possible that the suppressors are either synthesized too late or in cytokines. Normally, RNA duplexes shorter than 30 nucleotides in amounts too small to counter the effect of a pre-existing siRNA or length would not be expected to trigger the interferon-linked shRNA.\n\nprotein kinase R pathway. However, recently it was found that some GU-rich sequences, such as 5\u2032-UGUGU-3\u2032and 5\u2032-GUC-CUUCAA-3\u2032, which are toll-like receptor (TLR) immunostimu-\n\nlatory motifs, can trigger an interferon response [65] even when presented in duplexes shorter than 30 nucleotides. To minimize The siRNA machinery used in eukaryotic cells is the same as nonspecific interferon responses, judicious care must be exercised that used to process a class of endogenous small RNAs called in the sequence design of siRNA drugs. microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are important regulators of at least 30% of cellular genes, including those involved in development, signal transduction, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and 4.
