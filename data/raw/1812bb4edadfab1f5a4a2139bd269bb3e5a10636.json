{"title": "Preliminary investigations on the role of Drp-1 dependent mitochondrial fission in attenuating RLR downstream signaling during nervous necrosis virus infection", "body": "Mitochondria are the most dynamic organelle in the cell that constantly undergoes fission and fusion to facilitate cellular homeostasis [1] . The fission process of the mitochondria is mediated by mitochondrial translocation of cytosolic dynamin related protein-1 (Drp-1). The recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria is regulated by phosporylation of respective serine residues and are specifically modulated by mitochondrial outer membrane proteins like mitochondrial fission 1 (Fis1), mitochondria fission factor (Mff) [2, 3] . Mitochondrial dynamics is tightly regulated in response to variations in cellular physiology such as stress, infections, and nutrient supply [4] .\n\nThe innate antiviral response through the RIG-1 like receptor (RLR) pathway is oriented towards a key regulatory molecule, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). Up on recognition of the viral RNA, the RLRs, Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5 (MDA5) signal downstream through the MAVS by mutual caspase activation and recruitment domains [5, 6] . Localized to the mitochondria, MAVS coordinates the IFN production through regulated signaling cascades [5] [6] [7] [8] . Studies have shown that many viral proteins enhance mitochondrial fission and compromise the host immune response by preventing MAVS signaling and the majority of the mammalian viruses escape the host IFN response by targeting the MAVS [9] [10] [11] [12] . The IFN response escape strategy used by many of the aquatic viruses are still unclear, even though, studies demonstrated that the N protein of spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) degrades Zebra fish MAVS [13, 14] .\n\nNodaviruses are small, non-enveloped, spherical viruses with bipartite positive-sense RNA genomes that are capped but not polyadenylated comprised of two molecules of single stranded, positive polarity RNA (RNA1 and RNA2) approximately 3.1 and 1.4 kb. RNA1 encodes an approximately 100 kDa non-structural protein that has been designated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or protein A. Nodavirus synthesize a sub-genomic RNA3 from the 3\u2032 terminus of RNA1 during RNA replication which encode a B2 protein which plays a role in silencing host RNA interference [15] . Betanodavirus predominantly infect fish causing viral nervous necrosis (VNN), an infectious neuropathological disease characterized by necrosis of the central nervous system and retina [16] . VNN can induce massive death of the larval and juvenile populations of several marine teleost species including Asian seabass in India accounting for a larger mortality rate. Despite their severe economic impact on the aquaculture industry, the viral molecular regulation processes and the mechanism(s) of viral pathogenesis and infection of NNV have not been well studied. Oxidative stress and presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by NNV was observed in previous studies [17, 18] . Studies of Su et al. [19] reported that B2 protein of NNV increases the production of hydrogen peroxide and leads to Drp-1 activation invitro. In this study, we investigated the involvement of mitochondrial fission in the attenuation of RLR downstream signaling during NNV infection.\n\nSISS cells derived from the Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) spleen were obtained from National repository of fish cell lines (NRFC), NBFGR, India and cultured in Leibovitz L-15 media (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin at 25\u00b0C. Nervous necrosis virus of RGNNV genotype, isolated from infected seabass was used in the present study. Virus stocks were prepared in SISS cells and titer was determined by Reed and Muench method [20] .\n\nLabtek chamber slides were infected with NNV using multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in HBSS (MP Biomedicals, Ohio). Following the infection, slides were stained at 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hpi with 300 nM of MitoTracker \u00ae probe. The washed cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for and mounted with coverslip using Prolong Gold Antifade\u2122 mounting reagent (Life technologies, USA). The slides were imaged using Olympus FV500 CLSM Confocal microscope. To determine the mitochondrial ROS production, confluent cells were stained with MitoSOX at a final concentration of 5 \u03bcM according to manufacturer's recommendation. Cells were allowed to load MitoSOX for 30 min and the cells were washed two times with HBSS. Cells were infected with NNV using multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in HBSS and were imaged at 0, 6,12, 24, 48 and 72 hpi using a confocal microscope All experiment were repeated thrice.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was prepared from 1 to 2 mg of RNA using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers. Real time PCR reactions (50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 10 min) were performed in triplicate using Power SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with primers specific for NNV-RdRp, EF-1\u03b1, MAVS, IFN-1, IRF-3, MX, Drp-1, Mff and Fis-1 (Table 1) . Relative gene expressions were normalized to EF-1\u03b1 using the formula 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT (\u0394\u0394CT = \u0394CT sample -\u0394CT untreated control ) [21] .\n\nsiRNA was transfected into SISS cells at a concentration of 100pM with Turbofect reagent (Thermo scientific, Lithuania) according to the manufacturer's protocol. siRNA was custom synthesized at Euofins India ( Table 1 ). The cells were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 6 h with rocking the plate every 15 min to prevent cell drying. Immediately after siRNA treatment, the cells were infected with NNV and the cells were analyzed at different time points to monitor the expression pattern of viral transcripts and RLR downstream molecules.\n\nFollowing treatments (Viz, viral infected, siRNA transfected, SiRNA transfected and virus infected and mock), the cells were trypsinized and used for the isolation of mitochondria using mitochondria isolation kit (Thermo scientific, USA) according to manufacturers' instruction. Briefly, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 850g for 2min. To the pellet, 800 \u03bcL of Mitochondria Isolation Reagent A was added, vortexed and incubated on ice for 2min. The suspension was homogenized in a Dounce tissue grinder and 800 \u03bcL of mitochondria isolation reagent C was added and inverted several times to mix. Tubes were centrifuged at 700g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. To the pellet 500 \u03bcL Mitochondria Isolation Reagent C was added and centrifuged at 12,000g for 5min. The mitochondrial pellet was maintained on ice before downstream processing.\n\nSamples of total cell lysate or mitochondrial fraction lysate were prepared with Totex buffer (20 mM HEPES at pH 7.9, 0.35 M NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 50 mM NaF and 0.3 mM Na 3 VO 4 ) containing mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), Samples were incubated in protein sample buffer (final concentration: 50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% b-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) for 5 min at either 95\u00b0C before running SDS-PAGE at room temperature followed by immunoblotting with detection antibodies. Primary antibodies were identified with HRP conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and DAB substrate (Amresco, USA). Primary antibodies used were polyclonal anti-MAVS, anti Phospho-DRP1 (Ser616) -p-DRP-1(Thermo scientific, USA) and anti -VDAC1.\n\nAll the experiments were carried out in triplicates and mean data with standard error of mean were incorporated for the statistical analysis. All data were analyzed by one way ANOVA with Duncan's multiple range test using SPSS 22.0 (Chicago, USA).\n\nTo investigate the NNV-induced alterations of mitochondrial Table 1 List of primers and siRNA used in the study. Name primer/siRNA sequence 5\u2032-3\u2032\n\ndynamics, and physiology, SISS cells were infected with cell culturederived NNV. For studying the oxidative injury in NNV infected cells, we detected the mitochondrial superoxide production with MitoSOX\u2122 Red, a mitochondrially localized, superoxide-sensitive fluorescent ROS indicator. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 , NNV infection in the cells resulted in greater mitochondrial superoxide production compared with control in a time dependent manner. Studies have demonstrated that damaged mitochondria are potential source to initiate a vicious cycle of ROS generation and deteriorate other cellular components promoting cell death [22] . Concurrent with the present observations, HCV core protein resulted in the Ca 2+ -dependent mitochondrial ROS production and inhibited complex I activity in Huh7 cells [23, 24] . NNV infection induced oxidative stress has been reported in turbot brain, and the presence of ROS in GF-1 cells at an early stage of infection (24 h post infection, h.p.i.) induced cell death by affecting mitochondrial morphology [17, 18] . As shown in Fig. 2 , NNV-infected cells displayed distinct fragmented mitochondria (mitochondrial fission), in contrast to un-infected cells, which displayed a typical tubular mitochondrial network indicative of normal healthy cells. A similar result was also observed in Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [25] [26] [27] .\n\nThe physiologic regulators such as mitochondrial morphology, dynamics and mitochondrial ROS also play a major role in mitochondria mediated antiviral signaling [28, 29] . Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) are being recognized as both positive and negative modulators of RLR signaling. NOX2 and ROS are reported to have a major role for triggering the host cell for efficient MAVS signaling [30] . However in the present study, as the mitochondrial ROS and fragmentation increased significantly in a time dependent manner, transcript abundance and protein expression of MAVS have shown considerable depletion in the cells (Fig. 3) . Further, gene expression analysis of MAVS downstream molecules viz, IRF-3, IFN-1 and Mx have shown the significant down regulation in the mRNA transcript levels (Fig. 3C) . The majority of the mammalian viruses escape the host IFN response by targeting the MAVS. In case of hepatitis C virus, en-terovirus71, GBvirusB and the coxsackievirus B3, their NS3/4A serine protease, protease2Apro NS3/4A serine protease and cysteine protease 3Cpro respectively cleaves MAVS [9] [10] [11] [12] . Studies demonstrated that the N protein of spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) degrades Zebra fish MAVS by E3 ligase(s) mediated K48-linked ubiquitination [13, 14] . In Contrast to these, the influenza A virus, oncolytic measles virus and the SARS corona virus dampens MAVS signaling by perturbing the mitochondrial physiology [31] [32] [33] . Thus the exact mechanism of MAVS depletion in the cells post infection with NNV needs to be addressed with more studies.\n\nSer616 phosphorylation of Drp-1 by cyclin B/cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) recruits them to mitochondria and drive the fission process [34] . To understand whether NNV induces mitochondrial fission by promoting Drp1 Ser616 phosphorylation and its subsequent translocation to mitochondria, NNV-infected cells were analyzed by using a anti-Drp1 antibody that recognizes the Ser616-phosphorylated Drp1. Confocal microscopy revealed a significant stimulation of Drp1 Ser616 phosphorylation in NNV-infected cells and most of the Ser616 phosphorylated Drp1 localized to the mitochondria (Fig. 4A ). To conclude the observation that NNV induced Drp1 translocation to mitochondria, western blot analysis of mitochondrial fractions demonstrated that phosphorylated Drp1 is associated with mitochondria ( Fig. 4B ). Further real time expression studies stated that NNV infection increased the expression of Drp1 and Mff at mRNA level but the transcript abundance of Fis 1 remained stagnant throughout the infection (Fig. 4C) . These results were in concordance with previous studies of HBV, HCV and PRSSV thus suggesting that NNV promoted Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria by stimulating Ser616 phosphorylation. To substantiate the functional role of Drp 1in mitochondrial fission, the siRNA mediated silencing of Drp 1 expression was performed. As shown in Fig. 5A , intracellular viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) was decreased in Drp 1deficient cells indicating the functional role of Drp1in mitochondrial fission. In similar studies on hepatitis C virus, classical swine fever virus and dengue virus, silencing of Drp1 had shown significant reduction in the viral replication as in the present study [25, 35, 36] . The transcript abundance of MAVS and its downstream molecules have also shown significant upregulation in Drp 1 deficient cells (Fig. 5C and D) .Western blot analysis of mitochondrial fraction of NNV infected Drp 1 deficient cells shown high abundance of MAVS on mitochondria as the infection progress (Fig. 5B) .\n\nIn summary our study shows that NNV stimulates the expression of Drp1 promotes its recruitment to mitochondria by stimulating the phosphorylation of Drp1 (Ser616), leading to mitochondrial fission and abrogation of MAVS downstream signaling. These preliminary observations state the functional relevance of mitochondrial dynamics in NNV infection and innate immune evasion. Further studies are required to elucidate the possible roles of other fission factors and involvement of other signaling cascades like mitophagy associated with the mitochondrial fission dynamics. Expression was normalized with EF1\u03b1 as the internal control. Data are expressed as means with SEM of three independent experiments (p < 0.05), * indicates significance difference."}
