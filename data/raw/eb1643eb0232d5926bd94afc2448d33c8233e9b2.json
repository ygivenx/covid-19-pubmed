{"title": "", "body": "It was a great honour for infection prevention and control practitioners in Middle Eastern countries to be able to participate in this inaugural HIS Middle East Summit. The sharing of experience and ideas among speakers and delegates from different countries and cultures was very fruitful. Although the Summit was widely publicized in our countries, June would have been a difficult month for many interested delegates to attend, and this author believes that an even greater attendance would have been achieved if the Summit had been held in the autumn.\n\nThe Summit opened with Professor Tawfik Khoja describing the challenges of infection prevention and control in the Middle East. His understanding of the problems that we face locally in implementing standard infection control precautions, and his suggested solutions, set the scene for the rest of the Summit. After his talk he discussed with delegates the possibility of developing a Middle East Association of Infection Prevention affiliated to the HIS; this idea was attractive to many delegates, and we hope that it will progress.\n\nDr Tim Boswell's presentation on infection prevention and control challenges in Europe raised some important points of interest for delegates, especially around the value of public reporting and external scrutiny, which happens little, or not at all, in most of our countries. We were also interested to hear of the risk posed by patient curtains as a source of infection transmission.\n\nThere then followed an important overview of MERS-CoV by Dr Ali Omrani, highlighting some important material such as the results of MERS-CoV national sero-surveillance. 1 He reminded us of the role of the dromedary camel as an intermediary host. These animals are known to have a high rate of carriage in nose or lung tissue, and a recently published study has shown that the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies is significantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population. 1,2 Dr Omrani then discussed the importance of social media in dispersing the news among KSA cities during the MERS-CoV outbreak, emphasizing the importance of being transparent during outbreaks of infection, engaging with the public through effective communication. Although Dr Omrani showed the value of surveillance in relation to MERS-CoV, a later presentation by Dr Muhammad Halwani, giving an overview of infection control in the Middle East, focusing on multidrugresistant organisms, brought home the fact that limited surveillance data are available in most Middle East countries.\n\nDr Nick Phin discussed influenza, and Carole Fry preparedness for Ebola. These presentations were based largely on preparedness for these infections in their own country. In countries such as ours where attitudes towards safety among healthcare workers are quite different, where diagnostic facilities are limited, and where waste disposal and decontamination are less regulated, the threats posed by emerging infections are even greater. The presentations that followed from Dr Tim Boswell and Peter Hoffman highlighted the constraints imposed on infection control in countries with limited resources. The former speaker highlighted the role of the environment in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens and the role of cleaning and disinfection. The latter presentation was particularly interesting for those of us working with limited resources, and covered the safe reprocessing of reusable instruments, as well as reminding us of the importance of not reprocessing single-use items.\n\nThe free paper presentations were well received by local delegates; it was very useful to hear about local experiences, and I was only sorry that this session was not longer. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the predominant theme of these presentations was that of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The first presentation was from colleagues at Mansoura University in Egypt who described how bloodstream infections were the commonest healthcare-associated infection in their hospital, with a predominance of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (and also a relatively high prevalence of MRSA). A presentation from Dr Abdalla Ahmed and colleagues used an investigation of isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii to show the future potential of next-generation sequencing in understanding the epidemiology of healthcare-associated pathogens. The presentation concluded with a reminder that automated data interpretation tools are required in order to generate easily understandable clinical reports. The final presentation in this session was from Dr Arif Al-Hamad, who described the epidemiology and aetiology of Gram-negative bacteraemia at Qatif Central Hospital, Saudi Arabia. Although there had been no significant changes in non-critical care areas of the hospital over the nine-year period studied, non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria, especially A. baumannii, had become increasingly important in critical care units. This suggests that infection control measures have so far been more successful in preventing infections with Enterobacteriaceae than with non-fermenters, and reminds us of the threat posed by drug-resistant A. baumannii.\n\nBack in the workshop hall the presentations from Peter Hoffman from the UK and Dr Amany Shebl from Egypt provided a nice contrast in how this important subject area is dealt with in different countries with different cultures and resources.\n\nFinally, I was one of the presenters on a session on basic infection control practices e these are not as well embedded into practice in Middle Eastern countries as they are in other countries. I considered the use of personal protective equipment to protect against bloodborne virus infection, while Dr Valerie Harmon discussed hand hygiene and reminded us of some of the interventions that have been reported to improve hand hygiene in studies from around the world. At the end of our session we presented delegates with a clinical scenario, and heard a range of different responses from different cultures. This was a fitting reminder at the end of the conference that different cultural attitudes and access to resources are important even in countries from the same geographical area.\n\nIn summary, we as a team from Egypt and other Arabic countries enjoyed very much the summit, science, friendship, and good poster presentations. We hope that it will be repeated again in a Middle East country."}
