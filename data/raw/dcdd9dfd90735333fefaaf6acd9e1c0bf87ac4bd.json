{"title": "pMINERVA: A Donor-Acceptor System for the in vivo Recombineering of scFv into IgG Molecules", "body": "There has been tremendous progress in DNA sequencing technology to decrease cost and increase capacity. Yet technologies for proteomics have not advanced much in the last 30 to 40 years. Gene expression does not always correlate with protein abundance levels. And post-translational modifications (especially important in cell signaling) cannot be studied at the nucleic acid level. Improved methods for deriving high quality affinity reagents are needed to keep up with the 'explosion' of genomics information. Currently, less than half of around 6,000 routinely-used commercial antibodies (Abs) recognize only their specified targets (1, 2) , and according to a publication in Nature Methods, over $350 million in biomedical research is wasted yearly in the United States alone due to poorly characterized Abs (3) . To overcome this problem, there is a need for all Abs to be defined by their sequences and made recombinant, such that researchers will be able to use the same binding reagents under the same conditions (2) (3) (4) (5) . However, while a number of approaches for generating recombinant affinity reagents exist (6) (7) (8) (9) , the high costs and low throughput of current technologies represent significant roadblocks to the development of a comprehensive and broadly available resource of renewable affinity reagents.\n\nPhage display is the most widely used method for selecting binding molecules from recombinant antibody libraries (10) (11) (12) (13) . In this technique, large numbers (>10 10 ) of singlechain variable fragment (scFv) or Fab antibodies are displayed on the surface of filamentous phage, and specific binders are selected by enrichment of binding phage during cycles of biopanning and propagation. High affinity phage Abs have been selected against numerous cellular proteins and small molecules (8) . However, validation of the phage antibodies often requires early production of the cognate full-length immunoglobulin G (IgG). Phage library outputs can be sub-cloned to generate a full immunoglobulin, but this step is timeconsuming and limits the number of clones that can be evaluated.\n\nWe have developed a system for the facile subcloning of phage display scFvs into IgG molecules in vivo, and for little cost. The system takes advantage of two genetic principles, recombination in E.coli (14) and splicing in mammalian cells (15, 16) . A phage display vector contains both bacterial and mammalian regulatory regions that support antibody expression in bacteria and mammalian systems. The scFv is expressed as a fusion to the bacteriophage M13 gp3 gene in bacteria and converted to an IgG that can be expressed in mammalian cells by transducing the phagemid into a second E.coli F + strain. In that strain, the phiC31 serine integrase is used to fuse the heavy chain constant domain (C H ) from an acceptor plasmid to the heavy chain variable domain (V H ) and to introduce controlling elements upstream of the light chain variable domain (V L ) (Fig. 1 ). Positive selection for the recombination events is built into the system (Fig. 1) . To generate the light-chain V L -C L fusion, mammalian splice sites flank the M13 gIII gene, allowing the V L to be fused to the light chain constant domain (C L ) in mammalian cells (Fig. 1 ). Using the designed vector system, a single shuttle vector can be employed for phage library construction, phage display screening, and IgG antibody production in mammalian cells. Here, we demonstrate the utility of the features of this 'pMINERVA' subcloning system and proof-of-concept functional testing.\n\nphagemid, pAX1565, is a derivative of the phagemid, pAP-III 6 (17) with a single-chain variable fragment antibody (scFv) fused to coat protein III of bacteriophage M13. The scFv in pAX1565 is based on the monoclonal antibody, Herceptin (DrugBank # DB00072), and contains a (Gly 4 Ser) 3 linker between the V H and V L domains.\n\nStandard cloning methods were used for cloning, sub-cloning, DNA extraction, protein purification, protein and DNA quantitation. Required mutagenesis was done using Agilent's site directed mutagenesis kits (18) . Synthetic genes were constructed at GeneArt (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmid pCDF-1b was purchased from Novagen (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Restriction enzymes, ligases and polymerases were purchased from (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Electro-competent cells were purchased from Lucigen (Middletown, WI). CHO Free style and HEK293 Free Style cells were acquired from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Mammalian cell growth media was purchased from Life Technologies.\n\nThe phagemid, pAPIII 6 (17) was used as the template vector for the pDonor construct. The full-length M13 gpIII gene flanked by splice sites was synthesized by GeneArt (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and cloned into pAPIII 6 vector using Sal I and Xho I restriction sites. The constant region of the kappa light chain (C L ) and the SV40 late polyA sequence was synthesized by GeneArt and cloned into the above vector using the Xho I restriction site. Recombinants were sequence confirmed for directionality. A synthetic scFv based on the anti-Her2 antibody, Herceptin, with the 36 bp attP sequence for phiC31 as a linker between the variable heavy (V H ) and variable light (V L ) genes was cloned between the Hind III and Sal I sites in the vector. A Mlu I site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) upstream of the phoA promoter in the vector. The synthetic promoters and leader peptides (Pro Cat or Pro Splice ; See figure 5) were cloned between the Mlu I site and Hind III sites, replacing the phoA promoter upstream of the scFv gene. The origin and references for all genes and regions included in the pDonor vector are described in Table 1 (14, 17, (19) (20) (21) .\n\nTo engineer the pAcceptor vector: The phiC31 gene (22) was synthesized by GeneArt (Life Technologies) and cloned into pCDF-1b (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) using Not I and Avr II restriction sites. The heavy chain acceptor construct consisting of the human EF1a promoter, IL-2 signal sequence, 36 bp attB sequence for phiC31 in frame with the signal sequence, human IgG1 constant domain, a ribosome binding site and spacer followed by the chloramphenicol gene (CAM), the BGH polyA sequence, and the T7 transcription terminator, was synthesized by GeneArt (Life Technologies). This 3.3 Kb DNA region was cloned into the pCDF-1b/phiC31 vector using the Acc65 I restriction site to generate pAcceptor. Recombinants were sequence confirmed. The origin and references for all genes and regions included in the pAcceptor vector are described in Table 1 .\n\nA single vector system for IgG expression consisting of the EF1a promoter upstream of the light chain (variable light (V L ) and constant light (C L ) regions) and a second mammalian promoter upstream of the heavy chain (variable heavy (V H ) and constant heavy (C H ) regions) was used to test individual components of the pMINERVA system. For the addition of the attL sequence between the signal sequence and V L, the attL duplex was cloned into the IgG expression vector using the Not I restriction enzyme (NEB) and sequenced to screen for directionality. For the addition of the attR sequence between V H and C H , site-directed mutagenesis was performed to introduce the 36 base pair attR sequence following the manufacturer's protocol (QuikChange, Agilent Technologies).\n\nTo introduce the M13 gpIII sequence flanked by splice sites between V H and C H of the IgG expression test vector, the gene was synthesized by GeneArt (Life Technologies) and cloned into the IgG expression test vector using BsiW I restriction sites. Recombinants were screened for directionality by sequencing.\n\nTo exchange the mammalian promoter driving the light chain of the IgG with Pro cat or Pro splice , the promoter sequences were synthesized by GeneArt (Life Technologies) and cloned into the IgG expression test vector using Mlu I and Not I restriction sites. To exchange the mammalian promoter driving the heavy chain of the IgG with Pro cat , the Pro cat sequence was synthesized by GeneArt (Life Technologies) and cloned into the IgG expression test vector using EcoR V and Nde I restriction sites.\n\nTo exchange V H and V L regions in the IgG vector, the V H gene was PCR amplified from a commercially available human IgG heavy chain expression vector (Invivogen, San Diego, CA) and cloned into the IgG expression test vector using Nde I and BsiW I restriction enzymes (NEB) and T4 DNA ligase (NEB). The entire light chain (V L and C L ) and a piece of the SV40 late polyA sequence were PCR amplified from a commercially available human IgG light chain expression vector (Invivogen) and cloned into the IgG expression test vector containing the correct V H using Not I and Hpa I restriction sites. Recombinants were sequence confirmed.\n\nTransformation reactions were set up as follows: 0.5 \u03bcl ligation product was mixed with 50 \u03bcl of TG1 electrocompetent cells (Lucigen) and added to a 0.1 cm gap cuvette. DNA was electroporated into bacterial cells using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad, at the following settings: 1.6 kV, 200 ohms, 25 \u03bcF). One ml of recovery media was added and the electroporated cells were transferred to 14 ml culture tubes and shaken at 37 \u00b0C. After 1 hr, one hundred \u03bcl of each of the dilutions was plated onto LB plates containing ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml), and the plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Chemically competent NEB5\u03b1 cells (NEB) were transformed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 50 \u03bcL of cells were incubated with 1 \u03bcL of DNA for 30 min on ice, heat shocked at 42\u00b0C for 30 sec and 250 \u03bcL of recovery media was added. Cells were incubated while shaking for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C and 100 \u03bcL was plated on LB plates with 100 \u03bcg/mL of ampicillin.\n\nFor vectors containing the Pro Splice promoter, a single colony of transformed TG1 cells was picked off of a TYE/Amp/Glucose plate into a 2 ml starter culture of 2YT supplemented with ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml) and 1% glucose. Single colonies containing Pro cat vectors were picked off of LB plates containing ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml) into a 2 ml starter culture of LB supplemented with ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml). Cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2-3 hours with shaking, diluted into 50 ml of their respective media, and further incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking until an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4 was reached. Once the cultures reached mid-log phase, 10 ml were transferred into individual 15 ml conical tubes, and 5 \u03bcl of KM13 helper phage was added (23) . After a 30 min incubation at 37\u00b0C without shaking, tubes were centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes and the supernatants were aspirated. Pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of appropriate media (Pro Splice : 2YT supplemented with ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml), kanamycin (50 \u03bcg/ml) and 0.1% glucose; Pro Cat : LB supplemented with ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml) and kanamycin (50 \u03bcg/ml)) and incubated at 30\u00b0C with shaking overnight. After overnight incubation, the cultures were centrifuged at 15,000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes. Supernatants were transferred to an ELISA plate pre-coated with the specific target antigen.\n\nFor coating of the ELISA plates, 100 \u03bcl/well of antigen diluted to 2.5 \u03bcg/ml in 1\u00d7 PBS was added to maxisorp ELISA plates (ThermoScientific, NUNC) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Wells were coated with either specific antigen or with non-relevant protein to test for nonspecific binding. The wells were washed three times with PBS (250 \u03bcl/well) and blocked for 1 hr with 2% nonfat dry milk in PBS (MPBS). The wells were washed for a total of three times with PBS. 100 \u03bcl of undiluted supernatant containing phage was added to the ELISA plate and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.01% Tween (PBS-T) followed by a 1 hr room temperature incubation with anti-M13 monoclonal antibody conjugated to Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The ELISA was developed by adding 100 \u03bcl TMB Ultra (Pierce, cat# 34029) to each well, and the reactions were stopped with 50 \u03bcl 2M H 2 SO 4 . Plates were read at 450 nm in a standard plate reader and fold over background (FOB) was calculated by dividing the OD450 of a well containing phage on specific antigen by the signal of the same phage on non-relevant protein.\n\nIgG expression vectors were transiently transfected into mammalian HEK293 (Life Technologies; 293-F; cat# R790-07) suspension cells under sterile conditions in a cell culture ventilation hood. On the day prior to transfection, the HEK293 suspension cells were diluted back to 0.7\u00d710 6 cells/ml in 30 ml total volume using Freestyle 293 Expression Medium (Life Technologies). On the day of transfection, 24 \u03bcg of sterile IgG expression vector DNA was diluted in 3 ml Freestyle 293 Expression Medium and vortexed for 10 seconds. To the diluted DNA, 24 \u03bcl of FectoPRO transfection reagent (Polyplustransfection, New York, NY) was added and vortexed for 10 sec. The DNA-transfection reagent mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The DNA-transfection reagent mixture was added to the 30 ml culture of HEK293 suspension cells that were seeded the day prior. Post-transfection the HEK293 cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 8%CO 2 with shaking at 130 rpm for 72 hours, at which point 15 ml of fresh Freestyle 293 Expression Medium was added. The cultures continued incubating at 37\u00b0C and 8% CO 2 shaking at 130 rpm for an additional 48-72 hours. The transfected cells were centrifuged at 1,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min and the IgG-containing supernatants were transferred to new, sterile tubes. The IgG antibodies were purified from the clarified supernatants with 0.5 ml Protein A bead slurry. The Protein A beads were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 45 mL of IgG supernatant for one hour while rocking at 4\u00b0C. The Protein A bead + IgG mixture was poured into an empty 2 ml chromatography column and loaded via gravity flow. The columns were washed twice with 3 mL of PBS supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and eluted with 1.5 mL of 0.1 M glycine at pH 3.0 and neutralized with 60 \u03bcl of 1 M Tris buffer at pH 9.0. The eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Final purified IgG was quantitated by Coommassie Plus assay kit (ThermoFisher, cat# 23236).\n\nFor biotinylated antigens, ELISA plates were coated with 100 \u03bcL per well of neutravidin at 10 \u03bcg/mL and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The wells were washed three times with PBS (250 \u03bcl/well) and blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. The wells were incubated with 1 \u03bcg/mL of biotinylated peptide (either specific target or non-relevant protein) for 1 hr at room temperature after which they were washed three times with PBS (250 \u03bcL/well) and blocked again for 1 h with 3% BSA in PBS. After washing the wells with PBS 3\u00d7, the purified IgG antibodies were added at 1 \u03bcg/ml in 3% BSA/PBS and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. The wells were washed four times with PBS + 0.01% Tween (PBS-T) and incubated with anti-human-IgG-HRP (ThermoFisher, cat# AHI0404) diluted 1:5,000 in block for 1 hr at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with PBS-T and the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was detected with TMB reagent (100 \u03bcL/well) with a 2-3 minute incubation. The reaction was stopped with 2M H 2 SO 4 (50 \u03bcL/well), absorbance was read at 450 nm and FOB was calculated by dividing the OD450 of a well containing IgG on specific antigen by the signal of the same IgG on non-relevant protein.\n\nHEK293 cells stably expressing a target antigen and HEK293 cells not expressing the antigen were added to V-bottom ELISA plates (Phenix, cat# MPG-651101) at a concentration of 2.3\u00d710 6 cell/mL (0.15 mL per well). Cells were blocked with 3% BSA for 30 min at room temperature after which they were centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 4 min and the supernatant was removed. Purified IgG was added to the cells at 1 \u03bcg/mL (100 \u03bcL per well) and incubated while shaking for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were washed 2\u00d7 with PBS, centrifuging the plate in between each wash at 500 \u00d7 g for 4 min. Cells were incubated while shaking with anti-human-HRP at 1:5,000 in block for 1 hr at room temperature, Cells were washed 2\u00d7 with PBS and transferred to a pre-blocked V-bottom plate and washed once more. 100 \u03bcL of luminescence reagent (Piece, cat #37069) was added to the cells/well and transferred to a white bottom ELISA plate (NUNC, cat# 436110). After a 2 min incubation the plates were read with a luminescence detector and FOB was calculated by dividing the relative luminescence unit (RLU) of a well containing IgG on HEK293 cells expressing the target antigen by the RLU of the same IgG on HEK293 cells not expressing the target antigen.\n\nCompetent TG1 cells containing the spectinomycin-resistant pAcceptor plasmid were prepared according to the New England Biolabs on-line protocol (https://www.neb.com/ protocols/2012/06/21/making-your-own-electrocompetent-cells). The cells were transformed with the pDonor or a mock-recombined control plasmid following standard electroporation procedure (described above). Transformants were plated on LB media containing ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml) or chloramphenicol (10 \u03bcg/ml). The ratio of ampicillin to chloramphenicolresistant transformants was determined.\n\nPhage-encoded serine integrases mediate directionally regulated site-specific recombination between short attP and attB DNA sites without host factor requirements (14) . The phiC31 serine integrase can be used to induce recombination between two plasmids in E. coli (22) . We designed a system that uses phiC31 to fuse the heavy chain variable domain (V H ) on our phagemid vector (pDonor) to the heavy chain constant domain (C H ) on a second plasmid (pAcceptor; Fig. 1 ). For this approach to be feasible, the linker between the variable heavy (V H ) and variable light (V L ) domains of the scFv must contain a 36 bp phiC31 integrase recognition site (attP or attB) that is able to function as both a peptide linker in the scFv and a functional substrate for phiC31 integrase.\n\nWe replaced the wild-type (Gly 4 Ser) 3 linker between the V H and V L of a model scFv (anti-Her2) in our phagemid vector with the phiC31 integrase site, attP or attB. The phage-scFv were produced in E.coli and tested for function in a phage ELISA against the target antigen, Her2, or a non-relevant control protein. As shown in figure 2, phage containing the attP linker bound selectively to Her2 with comparable activity to phage containing the wild-type linker (Fig. 2a) . Phage with the attB site as a linker in the scFv was unable to bind to its specific antigen (data not shown).\n\nSuccessful recombination between the attP site on the phagemid and the attB site on the acceptor plasmid generates a 36 base pair recombined phiC31 site (attR) at the hinge junction of the variable heavy domain and constant heavy domain of the immunoglobulin (Fig. 1) . In addition, a 36 base pair recombined phiC31 site (attL) is produced between the leader peptide and variable domain of the light chain (V L ) (Fig. 2b) . Tested IgGs containing the attR or attL sequences at these junctions, respectively, express at wild-type levels and recognize their respective target antigens (Fig. 2c, and Fig. 2d) .\n\nTo test the function of phiC31 in our system, the gene was cloned into a plasmid (derived from pCDF-1b; Novagen) under the control of a constitutive E. coli promoter (pCam; pACYC184) and transformed into the E. coli strain, TG1. A promoterless chloramphenicol resistance (camR) gene was placed 3\u2032 of the phiC31 integrase attB site on the same plasmid (pAcceptor). Successful integration of the phagemid (pDonor) into the pAcceptor plasmid places an E. coli promotor upstream of the pAcceptor camR gene and produces a bicistronic gene-pair composed of the immunoglobulin heavy chain and camR genes (Fig. 3a) . The cells that are harboring this resulting co-integrated plasmid thereby become chloramphenicol resistant. The phiC31-mediated integration efficiency was tested in E. coli by transforming a pAcceptor TG1 strain with the pDonor plasmid and measuring the percent of ampicillinresistant transformants converting to camR. Conversion would only occur as a result of successful co-integration. The ratio of chloramphenicol-resistant (camR) transformants to ampicillin-resistant (ampR) transformants was compared with the ratio of camR to ampR transformants using an already co-integrated plasmid in TG1 cells. Our results (Fig. 3b) demonstrate that the phiC31 integrase is able to site-specifically recombine the pDonor vector into a pAcceptor vector at >90% efficiency. No chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were obtained when the pDonor lacked the attP site (data not shown).\n\nWhile phiC31-mediated recombination is used to join the V H to the C H domain in our pMINERVA system, the light chain variable domain (V L ) domain in the scFv also needs to be fused to the light chain constant domain (C L ) (Fig. 1) . In eukaryotic cells, large sequences can be efficiently removed from mRNA by the RNA splicing machinery. We designed a synthetic intron containing the M13 gpIII gene flanked by consensus 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice site sequences. In E. coli, the scFv is expressed on the surface of bacteriophage M13 as a genetic fusion to the gpIII gene. In mammalian cells, the intron containing the gpIII gene is excised, creating a fusion of the V L to the C L (Fig. 1) . In the absence of proper splicing, the C L will be out of frame with the V L , and functional IgG cannot be produced. As shown in figure 4a, introduction of splice sites between the scFv and gpIII gene does not interfere with phage production or function. In HEK-293 cells, IgG expression from the intron-containing vector is comparable to expression from the original construct containing no intron, indicating that splicing is efficient (Fig. 4b, top) . Both IgGs tested are functional and show comparable activity in an ELISA against the target antigen (Fig. 4b, bottom ).\n\nTo enable scFv production in bacteria and IgG production in mammalian cells, a dualfunctional promoter that supports both E. coli and mammalian expression is required. We tested two different promoter systems here: a promoter intron-splicing system (Pro splice ) and a catenated polyfunctional promoter system (Pro cat ) (Fig. 5) . In the Pro splice system, the EF1a promoter is followed by the mammalian IgG heavy chain secretion signal sequence that contains an intron. The lac promoter/operator and bacterial signal peptide is contained within the mammalian intron, and the bacterial signal sequence overlaps the splice acceptor site. In E. coli, transcription from the bacterial lac promoter/operator within the mammalian intron results in expression of the scFv in the bacterial periplasm. In mammalian cells, splicing removes the bacterial regulatory sequences located in the intron, generating the mammalian signal sequence.\n\nIn the catenated promoter system (Pro cat ) developed by the Weiner team (24) the mammalian promoter is followed by a polyhedron promoter (for expression in insect cells) and bacterial promoter. The ATGs are removed from the downstream polyhedron and bacterial promoter such that the first ATG fMet start site for bacterial, insect and mammalian expression is identical. In this case, the same signal sequence is used for all three organisms. The Pro cat developed here uses the EF1a promoter for mammalian expression, the phoA promoter for E. coli expression, and the IL-2a signal peptide for secretion in both systems. Phage displaying the model scFv is produced from both promoter systems at equivalent levels (Fig. 5c ). In addition, the IgG yield from the dual promoter systems in HEK-293 cells is equivalent to the yield using the EF1a promoter alone (Fig. 5d and Table 2 ).\n\nBy combining together all of these elements, the pMINERVA system completely eliminates the labor-intensive subcloning and DNA sequence confirmation steps currently needed to convert a scFv into a functional IgG antibody.\n\nWe are building a platform that takes advantage of fundamental molecular biology principles to enable the rapid identification of specific Abs. Our screening platform is being developed with single-chain variable fragment Abs (scFvs) but the technology is applicable to other scaffolds, including both Fabs (4) and yeast display libraries (12, (25) (26) (27) . Here, we describe a vector system that enables high-throughput conversion of Ab fragments to full length immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules that can be directly validated in standard immunoassays.\n\nOur system relies on a phage integrase, phiC31, to induce site-specific recombination between a donor and acceptor plasmid in E. coli to generate a fusion of the antibody heavy chain variable domain (V H ) to the heavy chain constant domain (C H ) and to introduce regulatory elements upstream of the variable light chain gene (V L ). Recombinases such as Cre and FLP are commonly used for genome engineering in multiple organisms (28) (29) (30) . However, the efficiency of integration with these enzymes is low because the enzymes perform both integration and excision with the same target sites. Some phage integrases, including phiC31, perform only the integration reaction and require accessory factors for the reverse reaction (22) . We have shown here that phiC31 is greater than 90% efficient at inducing recombination between two plasmids in E. coli. There are many additional known serine-and tyrosine-integrases, such as B\u00d7B1, lambda, etc. that also mediate unidirectional, site-specific recombination and could be evaluated in this system (31) .\n\nThe phiC31 integrase has a 36 base pair (i.e., equivalent to 12 amino acids) recognition sequence. Our system requires incorporation of these integrase attachment sites in the linker of the scFv, and subsequently, at the hinge junction between the heavy chain variable and constant domains and between the signal sequence and light chain variable domain. We show that these 12 amino acid sequences do not interfere with phage production or IgG expression and function of the specific recombinant antibodies tested in this study. If needed, attP or attB mutations that would alter the resulting linker peptide to a more flexible linker sequence could be tested for their ability to support efficient integration. Additionally, in order to generate a \"seamless\" IgG, it may be possible to incorporate splice sites flanking the integrase attachment sites in the vector. We successfully used mammalian splicing in this study to excise the M13 gpIII gene and fuse the light chain variable domain (V L ) to the light chain constant domain (C L ). Intron splicing has further been shown to enhance the expression of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells (32) .\n\nWe describe two dual expression promoter systems here that both worked well for E. coli and mammalian expression. One system utilizes mammalian splicing to excise bacterial expression elements, and the second system uses catenated promoters for mammalian, insect cell, and E. coli expression. The catenated promoter system requires the same signal peptide to work in both E. coli and mammalian cells. We show here that the IL-2 signal sequence is able to function as a secretion signal in bacteria. Other signal peptides that work in both mammalian and bacterial systems have been reported (15) and can be tested for improved expression in our system. We utilized the human EF1a promoter to build our dual function promoter system, but other promoters that enable high-level protein expression in mammalian cells, including the CMV promoter, can be tested. Our catenated promoter system (24) includes the polyhedron promoter such that insect cells could be used as an alternative to HEK-293 cells for high-throughput IgG production.\n\nOur current system is modeled on a human IgG1 antibody. However, additional pAcceptor plasmids can be constructed to extend the utility of the system. Acceptor constructs containing other human immunoglobulin isoforms (including IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgM) can be generated, as well as acceptors containing the constant domains for mouse or rabbit antibodies. Different types of 3\u2032 fusions could also be generated, including enzyme fusions (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) , protein purification tags (38) (39) (40) (41) , labels (42) (43) (44) , and fusion-tags that can direct proteins to the endosome (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) . We believe that this will be the ideal vector system for producing recombinant antibodies.\n\nTo capitalize on the investment and availability of sequenced genomes, it will be essential to devise methods for rapidly and inexpensively generating affinity reagents at a proteomescale. Combining the pMINERVA system with our previous improvements, AXM mutagenesis (55), Phage ESCape (56) , and phage libraries using entirely pre-defined complementarity determining regions (CDR) (57) we present a platform for the rapid generation of recombinant monoclonal Abs in as few as three weeks and at a cost comparable to that of polyclonal antibodies. The scFv Abs encoded on the pDonor vector as M13gpIII-fusions can be screened in a phage display biopanning procedure to identify a phagemid encoding a scFv with the desired biophysical properties. This phagemid is transduced into an E. coli strain expressing phiC31 integrase and harboring an IgG acceptor vector. The product of the recombination event introduces a polyadenylation signal site adjacent to the 3\u2032 end of the C H gene. Furthermore, the recombination event introduces both a mammalian promoter and functional protein initiation site 5\u2032 to the V L gene. Of special note, the linker between the V H and V L domains of the scFv is composed of a phiC31 36-bp attP site that is able to function as both a: i) peptide linker between the heavy and light variable domains, and ii) 36-bp functional substrate for phiC31 integrase.

Anti-M13 antibody that is conjugated to Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used for phage detection and the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed with Ultra Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) reagent. The fold over background (FOB), which is the signal against target over the signal against non-relevant control, is shown for each phage tested. Error bars represent the standard deviation of phage binding tested in triplicate (B) IgG molecule modeled with attL and attR. The attL (thick blue loop) and attR (thick red loop) peptides are inserted schematically in a typical human IgG1 molecule (PDB ID: 1hzh) shown as ribbons (heavy chain: white, light chain: cyan). (C) The same IgG, with either no linker or the recombined phiC31 integrase attL site between the IL2 signal sequence (ss) and V L , was produced. In parallel, expression of the wild-type IgG was compared to expression of the same IgG with the recombined phiC31 integrase site attR site between V H and C H . A coommassie stained SDS-PAGE gel is shown. (D) An IgG with attL between the IL2ss and the V L (top graph) and an IgG with attR between V H and C H (bottom graph) were tested for binding to both a specific and a non-relevant target antigen in a cell ELISA. The binding of both molecules was compared to the binding of a wildtype IgG. Both ELISAs used anti-human-HRP to detect the IgGs and the ELISA was developed with Ultra TMB reagent. The ODs at 450nm are shown. The same IgG, with either no linker or the intron containing the M13 gpIII gene between the V H and C H was produced. An ochre stop codon placed 3\u2032 of the M13 gpIII gene prevents full length light chain protein expression from nonspliced mRNAs. Upper arrow indicates the band corresponding to the heavy chain and the lower arrow corresponds to the light chain gene product in the SDS-PAGE. IgG molecules were tested for functionality in an ELISA using purified antigen. FOB (fold-overbackground) signal is shown for both. \n\nEleven scFv V H and V L sequences were cloned into a single IgG expression test vector using the Pro cat promoter to drive the heavy chain. The IgG vectors were transfected into HEK293 cells and the secreted IgG proteins were purified from the supernatant six days post-transfection. The amount of final purified IgG was determined and yields were calculated based on transfecting 100mL cell culture volumes. "}
