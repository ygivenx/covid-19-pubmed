{"title": "Structure-activity relationship studies of lipophilic teicoplanin pseudoaglycon derivatives as new anti-influenza virus agents", "body": "Human influenza A and B viruses cause the annual influenza epidemics and sporadic pandemics associated with high fatality rate [1] . The viral envelope contains two glycoproteins with a crucial role in virus replication. The hemagglutinin (HA) is responsible for initial attachment of the virus to sialylated cell surface glycans, and fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes after endocytosis of the virus particle [2] . The influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) catalyzes release of newly formed virions at the end of the viral life cycle. Currently available influenza virus blockers are the NA inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, and the M2 ion channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine [3] . The latter two are rarely used nowadays because of global viral resistance against them [4] . The increasing awareness of potential oseltamivir resistance [5, 6] advocates the need for new antiinfluenza medications. Clinical trials are ongoing for a few HAtargeting approaches, i.e. the fusion inhibitor arbidol and diverse broadly neutralizing anti-HA antibodies [3] . In addition, the possibility to target a host factor involved in HA functioning is tested with the HA maturation inhibitor nitazoxanide and a receptordestroying sialidase enzyme, besides various concepts in the preclinical stage [7] . Antiviral drugs are also required for pandemic preparedness against zoonotic and highly virulent influenza viruses [8] . In this context, antiviral glycopeptide analogues seem particularly Abbreviations: DCM, dichloromethane; DMF, dimethylformamide; CPE, cytopathic effect; Et 3 N, triethylamine; Galp, galactopyranose; HA, hemagglutinin; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; logP, logarithm of the partition coefficient; MCC, minimum cytotoxic concentration; MDCK, Madin\u00c0Darby Canine Kidney; M2, Matrix-2;\n\nMTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; NA, neuraminidase; Ph, phenyl; PMB, p-methoxybenzyl; SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SI, selectivity index; SEM, standard error of the mean; TEG, tetraethylene glycol; TLC, thin layer chromatography; tosyl, p-toluenesulfonyl. relevant since they often display broad activity against influenza plus some other emerging viruses. Derivatives of teicoplanin or related antibiotics were reported to inhibit, among others, influenza virus [9] ; coronaviruses [10] including SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) [11] ; Ebola pseudovirus [12] ; HIV [13] ; or hepatitis C virus [14] . Our focus of the last years was to investigate the structure-activity relationship and mechanism of action for influenza virus. We reported lipophilic derivatives of ristocetin aglycon modified on the N-terminal part of the molecule, which proved to be strong inhibitors of influenza virus replication in cell culture [15] . Mechanistic studies with the lead compound demonstrated that it interferes with influenza virus endocytosis [16] . Its favorable selectivity index encouraged us to prepare a series of analogues to gain further insight into structure activity relationships [17, 18] . The outstanding antiviral properties were lost in analogues containing teicoplanin aglycon or pseudoaglycon, meaning that minor structural differences between the aglycon of teicoplanin and that of ristocetin, have major impact on antiviral activity [19] .\n\nNext, we found that a special lipophilic modification of teicoplanin pseudoaglycon also resulted in derivatives with high antiinfluenza virus activity [20] . These derivatives contain a sugar unit carrying two n-octyl chains, and this lipophilic auxiliary is attached to teicoplanin pseudoaglycon through a tetraethylene glycol chain and a triazole ring (1a and 1b, Fig. 1 ). Although the antiviral mode of action of 1a and 1b remains to be elucidated, we observed that these dually octylated teicoplanin pseudoaglycon derivatives inhibit influenza virus-induced hemagglutination, suggesting that they interfere with the binding interaction between the viral HA and sialylated host cell receptors. We also found that the lipophilic side chains in these molecules are essential for antiinfluenza virus activity, since changing these octyl chains to methyl groups (1c) completely abolished the antiviral effect [20] . Unfortunately, the strong activity of 1a and 1b was accompanied by high cytotoxicity, while the inactive and less amphiphilic 1c was only moderately toxic.\n\nSurprisingly, we recently found that teicoplanin pseudoaglycon achieves anti-influenza virus properties by a simple lipophilic modification based on the well-known azide-alkyne cycloaddition click reaction (2a-j) [21] . The activity oddly correlated to the structure, since it disappeared and then reappeared by increasing the length of the lipophilic alkyl chains. Changes in cytotoxicity, however, were more consistent and indicated that the addition of longer alkyl substituents resulted in higher cytotoxicity. Although compounds 2a and 2d showed excellent inhibitory activity against influenza virus, their selectivity indices were unfavorable [21] . Noteworthy, some of these derivatives with amphiphilic, bulky substituents (2i, 2j) displayed anti-influenza virus activity without significant cytotoxicity, despite their high calculated logP values.\n\nWith the aim of achieving derivatives with more favorable biological properties, we decided to carry out a systematic structure-activity relationship analysis of teicoplanin pseudoaglycon derivatives resembling 1a, 1b, or e.g. 2d. A simple conjugation method for protein and peptide modification was reported [22] , involving rapid and clean reaction of 3,4-dibromomaleimides and thiols, and giving bis-alkylthio maleimides in high yields through an addition-elimination mechanism. We envisioned the application of maleimide chemistry in combination with azide-alkyne Fig. 1 . Structure of previously synthesized teicoplanin derivatives. Compounds 1a, 1b, 2a and 2d showed promising anti-influenza virus activity; 1c, 2b, and 2c were inactive; and 2e showed modest activity [20, 21] \n\nclick chemistry, to produce three sets of teicoplanin derivatives equipped with two lipophilic substituents similarly as in 1a and 1b. (In the Discussion, these derivatives are denoted as Series 1e3). Compounds 2a-j are referred to in the SAR analysis as Series 4. Two further sets of derivatives (Series 5 and 6) comparable to 2a-g, which contain only one lipophilic alkyl chain, were prepared by azide-alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction and by N-sulfonylation. Here we describe the synthesis and antiviral investigation of these compounds.\n\nChemistry. The first group of derivatives (12e18) was prepared by synthesizing various bis-alkylthio maleimides 4a-10a from 3,4dibromomaleimide 3, followed by subsequent ethoxycarbonylation of the maleimide NH group [23] making compounds 4b-10b suitable for conjugation to the N-terminus of teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 11 (Scheme 1). Although we have described this path earlier [24] for the synthesis of compounds 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18 , this time we also prepared the bis-n-butylthio and bis-n-hexylthio maleimide derivatives (5 and 6) for the sake of the systematic approach in this study. We also prepared the asymmetrically substituted maleimide variant 9 that has an n-propyl and n-dodecyl function.\n\nThe second series of derivatives contains similar maleimidederived side chains as the previous group, but these are attached through a triazole linker to the glycopeptide core, in order to increase the distance of the lipophilic chains from the pseudoaglycon. In this synthetic procedure we prepared N-propargyl maleimides 19e24 by reaction of the corresponding N-ethoxycarbonyl maleimides (4b-8b, 10b) with propargylamine. Finally, an azide-alkyne click reaction was carried out between azido teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 25 [9] and maleimides 19e24, yielding final products 26e31 (Scheme 2).\n\nThe third group of derivatives carrying maleimide substituents differs from the previous one in the structure of the linker, which in this case contains a tetraethylene glycol segment besides the triazole ring as in compounds 1a and 1b. By introduction of the tetraethylene glycol fragment, the overall lipophilicity of the compounds is reduced, while the crucial lipophilic substituents are still incorporated in the structure. This linker modification proved to have a substantial effect on the biological profile of the molecules (see below).\n\nThe compounds suitable for this type of modification (33e39) were prepared by the simple reaction of N-ethoxycarbonyl Scheme 1. Synthesis of maleimide derivatives 12e18 (Series 1) with double lipophilic tails by direct coupling of 4e10 to teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 11. Scheme 2. Conjugation of the bis-alkylthio maleimide derivatives 19e24 to azido teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 25 through a triazole moiety (Series 2). maleimides 4b-8b, 10b, 32b and triethylene glycol 2-aminoethyl propargyl ether. Subsequent click reaction with azido teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 25 gave glycopeptides 40e46 (Scheme 3).\n\nThe fourth type of modification we describe here was based on our previous results mentioned above. Although compounds 2a and 2d possessing single, relatively long alkyl chains were highly active against influenza virus, they also displayed considerable cytotoxicity [21] . (For the sake of clarity, these compounds are listed as a separate series, i.e. Series 4 in Table 1 . The structures can be found in Fig. 1.) We speculated that this high cytotoxicity might be related to a combination of two factors, the first being high lipophilicity of the side chains in contrast to the hydrophilic pseudoaglycon part, which may cause a membrane-disrupting effect. This might be enhanced by the simple structure of the alkyl chains, which could facilitate insertion of these molecules into biological membranes. In our previous work [21] we attached two very bulky substituents (a perbenzylated disaccharide and a calix [4] arene carrying tert-butylsubstituents) to the same pseudoaglycon (2i and 2j). Calculated logP values for these compounds indicated higher lipophilicity than e.g. the n-hexadecyl or n-octyl derivatives 2a and 2d. These derivatives did not produce profound cytotoxic effect, supporting our hypothesis that cytotoxicity is determined by the combination of the lipophilicity and bulkiness of the substituents. It needs to be mentioned here, that in the A2 components of teicoplanin the \u00df-Dglucosamine on the D-ring is N-acylated by similarly simple acyl chains, yet these compounds seem to be harmless to mammalian cells. Therefore, the overall lipophilicity of the molecules may also influence cytotoxicity.\n\nSince the introduction of alkyl chains proved to be promising in terms of antiviral activity, we decided to insert the tetraethylene glycol linker between the core and these substituents, in order to decrease lipophilicity as in the case of maleimide derivatives, which again caused a significant change in biological properties.\n\nFirst, the mono-azido derivative of tetraethylene glycol 47 was utilized in a click reaction with alkyl propargyl ethers 48e51, yielding triazole derivatives 52e55. These were O-alkylated with propargyl bromide to provide compounds 56e59, which were used in the last step in a CuAAC reaction with azido teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 25 to obtain derivatives 60e63 (Scheme 4).\n\nFinally, by the reaction of teicoplanin pseudoaglycon with different sulfonyl chlorides 64e71 we prepared sulfonamide derivatives (72e79) (Scheme 5). This type of derivatization was attractive mainly because of its simplicity and high stability of the sulfonamide bond. Despite this, to our knowledge no one has thus far reported this type of derivatives of teicoplanin or related glycopeptides.\n\nBiological evaluation. The anti-influenza virus activity was determined in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells using a reported cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction method, in which CPE is assessed by microscopy plus formazan-based cell viability assay [25] . In parallel, cytotoxicity was determined in mock-infected cells. Table 1 summarizes the data for three human influenza A strains (including an A/H1N1 2009 pandemic strain) plus one influenza B strain.\n\nSeries 1, maleimide derivatives 12e18, showed variable activity against the four influenza virus strains tested, but neither of them proved as potent as compound 1a. Only compounds 17 and 18 displayed quite consistent activity against the four strains. Curiously enough, neither the double n-propyl nor the double ndodecyl substituted maleimide moieties yielded active compounds, while the combination of n-propyl and n-dodecyl chains (compound 17) led to notable activity. The fair activity of compound 18 carrying a double galactose substituted maleimide was accompanied by modest selectivity with an SI of 5 [selectivity index (SI): ratio of MCC to average EC 50 ]. This indicated the need for structural modification in order to reduce the cytotoxicity.\n\nSeries 2 (26e31) containing the triazole linker was, overall, more successful against influenza virus with somewhat lower cytotoxicity than the first series. Namely, antiviral activity was seen in the case of compounds 27, 28 and 29 which contain double nbutyl, n-hexyl and n-octyl chains, respectively. The presence of the linker highly altered the behavior of these compounds, since the analogous derivatives in the previous series (i.e. no triazole linker) with the same alkyl chain lengths were inactive. 29 displayed robust antiviral activity and a favorable SI of 10, whereas 27 and in particular 28 still had poor selectivity. 30 with the double ndodecyl moiety remained inactive, but became less cytotoxic, which was a general finding in Series 2. Sadly, the double galactose substituted derivative lost its activity on introduction of the triazole linker.\n\nThe biological results for Series 3 (40e46) demonstrated that by introducing the tetraethylene glycol linker, cytotoxicity was generally reduced, while the anti-influenza virus activity was retained in the n-butyl (41) and n-hexyl (42) derivatives, and even increased in the n-octyl (43) analogue. Since the tetraethylene glycol element seemed beneficial, we also prepared a derivative with double tetraethylene glycol side chains (46), but this modification did not yield an active compound, probably because it misses the lipophilic moiety that proved to be essential for anti-influenza virus activity (see conclusions). Surprisingly, despite the lack of lipophilic moieties, compound 46 proved to be highly cytotoxic. Ultimately, 41 stood out as the most promising compound in this group, with very low cytotoxicity and robust activity against all tested strains, yielding a nice SI of 16.\n\nThe activities of triazole derivatives (2a-j) in Series 4 have already been published [21] elsewhere. These data are shown again, considering the systematic approach in our present report and the structural analogy to some of the compounds in this work. Surprisingly, among the alkyl substituted compounds, only the nhexadecyl (2a) and n-octyl (2d) derivatives showed high activity, while the attachment of n-dodecyl (2b) and n-decyl (2c) side chains led to inactive compounds. However, all four derivatives had very high cytotoxicity. 2e with a n-hexyl side chain and compounds with aromatic substituents (2f, 2g) were only mildly active with Scheme 3. Conjugation of bis-alkylthio maleimide derivatives equipped with an N-TEG-propargyl moiety (33e39) to azido teicoplanin pseudoaglycon 25 gave Series 3 (40e46). c Cytotoxicity expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC; compound concentration producing minimal changes in cell morphology, as estimated by microscopy) or the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ; estimated by the MTS cell viability assay). Data represent the means of two to five independent tests. moderate cytotoxicity. Interestingly, 2h and 2i (a perbenzylated lactose and a calix [4] arene derivative) displayed moderately high activity which was accompanied by only modest cytotoxicity, despite their very high calculated logP values indicating much higher lipophilicity when compared to 2a. As stated above, the explanation could be that, although these molecules are very lipophilic, their bulky structures may lead to an inability to disrupt cellular membranes as is the case for alkyl derivatives.\n\nTo further investigate how the tetraethylene glycol linker impacts the cytotoxicity, we synthesized Series 5, derivatives 60e63, which are analogous to the alkyl chain-containing triazole derivatives in Series 4. We speculated that introduction of the linker would boost the antiviral activity and reduce the cytotoxicity compared to the published compounds. Indeed, compound 63 (an analogue of 2c) showed excellent antiviral activity and reasonable cytotoxicity compared to 2c which is highly cytotoxic and devoid of anti-influenza virus activity. Interestingly, lowering the length of the alkyl chain (analogues 60e62) did not yield effective compounds.\n\nAlso for the sulfonamide derivatives (Series 6), the size and type of lipophilic substituents seemed to play an important role. The less hydrophobic tosyl (72), benzenesulfonyl (73), and p-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl (74) derivatives had rather low or no antiinfluenza virus activity and were also not cytotoxic. However, the more lipophilic aryl substituted compounds, such as the biphenylsulfonyl (75) and dansyl (76) derivatives, displayed good activity. Unfortunately, they were also cytotoxic in the MDCK cells. The relationship between alkyl chain length, cytotoxicity and antiviral activity was very clear in case of alkylsulfonates 77e79. The hexanesulfonyl derivative (77) was the best compound showing moderate cytotoxicity and very consistent anti-influenza virus activity. With growing alkyl chain length (78, 79), the activity rapidly increased, but so did the cytotoxicity.\n\nInhibition of influenza HA-and NA-bearing lentiviral pseudoparticles. We previously published the anti-influenza virus mechanism of action of a lipophilic derivative of aglycoristocetin denoted SA-19 [16] . This compound proved to have nice activity in an assay with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing lentiviral pseudoparticles bearing influenza virus HA and NA. This was consistent with other findings that SA-19 interferes with HAmediated endocytosis. We now used the same procedure for two of the most potent teicoplanin pseudoaglycon derivatives (1a, 63). Strong and dose-dependent inhibition was seen with all four control compounds (Fig. 3) , i.e. SA-19; chloroquine (an inhibitor of endosomal acidification); and two aniline-based influenza fusion inhibitors (80, 81, Fig. 2 ) which inhibit the conformational refolding of H1 HA at low endosomal pH [26] . With 63, the inhibition of pseudoparticle entry, as deduced from the reduction in GFP signal, was 92% at 10 mM and 56% at 2 mM. Likewise, 1a produced 54% reduction at 2 mM.\n\nActivity against human coronavirus 229E. Given that teicoplanin and related glycopeptides were reported to have anticoronavirus activity [10, 11] , we evaluated a subset of the newly synthesized compounds against human coronavirus 229E, using two complementary methods, i.e. CPE reduction in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblast cells and virus yield reduction in human lung carcinoma A549 cells. Among Series 1, 2 and 3, we tested the analogues carrying alkyl groups of intermediate length, i.e. n-butyl and n-hexyl; for Series 6, the entire series was tested. The antiviral activity values obtained (see Table S6 in Supporting Information) in HEL and A549 cells showed nice agreement. In A549 cells, several compounds produced 2-log 10 (i.e. 100-fold) reduction in coronavirus yield at a concentration of~10 mM, with no or minimal cytotoxicity at 50 mM. The alkanesulfonamide derivatives 77 and 79 displayed potent anti-coronavirus activity in terms of EC 50 (~2 mM) and SI (ratio of MCC to EC 50 : 11 for 77 and 13 for 79). Within the same series, the p-toluenesulfonamide analogue 72 was also nicely active and selective (SI: 19).\n\nIn summary, we synthesized and evaluated several derivatives of teicoplanin pseudoaglycon in a systematic manner to obtain structure-activity relationships concerning the anti-influenza virus activity of the compounds. Many of the lipoglycopeptides exhibit remarkable activity against both influenza A and B viruses and showing, occasionally, favorable selectivity index.\n\nBased on the biological data, it became evident that inhibition of influenza virus replication is not primarily dependent on the type or complexity of the chemical bond or functional group between the glycopeptide N-terminus and the newly introduced fragments. The structure of the side chains, but even more the overall lipophilicity of the compounds are the most influential on biological properties.\n\nHence, the presence of a lipophilic side chain is definitely a requirement for antiviral activity. The optimal length of alkyl substituents, which is somewhat dependent on the structure of the linker, is usually equivalent to 6e10 methylene groups. If the side chain carries two alkyl groups, reduced length might be enough, e. g. double butyl substitution. The incorporation of longer alkyl groups (>14 carbon atoms, Series 4) might also lead to active compounds, however most of these proved to be highly cytotoxic. The latter was even noted for some compounds with the optimum side chain lengths (e.g. 8e10). Reducing the cytotoxicity with preservation of antiviral activity was achieved by incorporation of the tetraethylene glycol linker. In some cases, this modification led to an improvement, while other derivatives became less active, probably due to a loss of required lipophilicity.\n\nAnalyzing the influence of the aryl substitution is more difficult, since this type of substituent is only present in two compound series (Series 4 and 6) in a smaller number. Nevertheless, these analogues seem to display a similar relationship between lipophilicity, anti-influenza virus activity and cytotoxicity, as the alkyl substituted compounds. Compounds containing one aromatic ring are usually not very active nor cytotoxic. Two aromatic rings seem to boost antiviral activity because of increased lipophilicity, but cytotoxicity also becomes prominent. Interestingly, the two compounds that carried numerous aromatic rings in the form of a highly bulky, lipo/hydrophilic side chain were effective against one or more influenza virus strains without causing serious cytotoxicity.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it is likely that cytotoxicity of the lipoglycopeptides increases with the compounds' ability to solubilize cellular membranes and with net lipophilicity. With bulky and amphiphilic side chains, this effect might be weaker compared to more simple structures such as alkyl chains which could easily insert into lipid membranes. This could explain the apparent contradiction that some analogues displayed very high lipophilicity without severe cytotoxicity.\n\nIt is evident that the major challenge lies in designing the optimal lipoglycopeptide structures to provide sufficient lipophilicity for anti-influenza virus activity without causing serious cytotoxicity. As we have demonstrated, high activity goes hand in hand with high toxicity in many instances. Still, our study proved that once an active lead compound has been identified, it is possible to diminish its cytotoxicity by applying appropriate structural adjustments. Besides the modifications described here, there are unlimited variations that could lead to derivatives with excellent biological profiles. Moreover, as we have seen, the promising antiviral activity is not limited to influenza virus since some of our derivatives also displayed activity against human coronavirus. This makes this class of lipoglycopeptides a relevant class for further investigation [27] .

The virus strains were: A/ PR/8/34 (A/H1N1); A/Virginia/ATCC3/2009 (A/H1N1pdm); A/HK/7/ 87 (A/H3N2); B/Ned/537/05; and B/HK/5/72. The infection medium consisted of Ultra-MDCK \u00ae medium (Lonza), supplemented with 0.0225% sodium bicarbonate, 2 mM L-glutamine and 2 mg/mL tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. On day 0, semiconfluent cultures of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in 96-well plates were infected with influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0004 plaque forming units (PFU) per cell. After three days incubation at 35 C, virus-induced CPE and compound cytotoxicity were scored by microscopy, after which the data were confirmed by formazan-based MTS cell viability assay (CellTiter 96 \u00ae AQ ueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay from Promega). The antiviral effect was expressed as the compound concentration producing 50% inhibition of the virus-induced CPE (EC 50 ). Compound cytotoxicity was expressed as the compound concentration causing minimal changes in cell morphology (MCC), and 50% cytotoxic concentration based on MTS (CC 50 ).\n\nThe plasmids for the lentiviral pseudoparticle assay [described in full detail elsewhere [16] ] were: pCGGagPol (a gift from G. Maertens [33] ); pQCXIP-AcGFP (kind gift from D. Daelemans); and two pCAGEN plasmids, i.e. pCAGEN backbone [kindly provided by C. Cepko (Boston, MA) via Addgene (plasmid No. 11160 [34] ] into which we cloned the A/PR/8/34 HA and NA cDNA sequences. The four plasmids were transfected into human HEK-293T cells to produce GFP-expressing lentiviral particles. Two days after transfection, the supernatant was collected and trypsin was added to activate the influenza HA0 protein [16] For lentiviral transduction, MDCK cells were seeded at 7500 cells per well in 96-well plates, and incubated one day later with lentiviral particles together with test compounds. After three days incubation, the cells were trypsinized, fixated with paraformaldehyde, and submitted to flow cytometry for GFP detection, using a BD FACSCanto II apparatus.\n\nHuman embryonic lung fibroblast (HEL) 299 cells; human lung carcinoma A549 cells; and human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E were obtained from ATCC. During virus infections, the medium contained 2% fetal calf serum. To conduct the CPE reduction assay, confluent HEL cell cultures in 96-well plates were exposed to HCoV-229E (MOI: 100 CCID 50 per well) together with the test compounds. After 5 days incubation at 35 C, microscopy was performed to determine the EC 50 and MCC values (same definition as above).\n\nTo perform the qRT-PCR-based coronavirus yield assay, the materials were: HCoV-229E nucleoprotein-derived forward primer (5 0 -TTAGAGAGCGTGTTGAAGGTG-3 0 ); reverse primer (5 0 -GTTCTGAATTCTTGCGCCTAAC-3 0 ); probe (5 0 -6-FAM-TCTGGGTTG/ ZEN/CTGTTGATGGTGCTA-IBFQ-3 0 ; and a standardization plasmid with a 294-bp sequence of the HCoV-229E N-gene. As reference compound, the HCoV RNA synthesis inhibitor K22 [35] (from ChemDiv) was used.\n\nOn day 0, confluent A549 cells in 96-well plates were exposed to the compounds together with HCoV-229E. One hour after infection, the virus inoculum was removed and the cells were further incubated at 35 C in the presence of compounds. At day 3 p.i., the supernatants were frozen at \u00c080 C. Before qRT-PCR, virions were lysed by treating 2 ml sample with 10 ml resuspension buffer and 1 ml lysis enhancer (CellsDirect One-Step qRT-PCR kit; Invitrogen), and 10 min incubation at 75 C. Next, quantification of CoV genome copies was performed by one-step qRT-PCR. The program was run on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast instrument and consisted of 15 min at 50 C; 2 min at 95 C; and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 C followed by 45 s at 60 C. The EC 99 and EC 90 values were calculated by interpolation and defined as the compound concentration producing respectively a 2-log 10 and 1-log 10 reduction in viral RNA copy number, as compared to the virus control receiving no compound. To monitor compound cytotoxicity, microscopy was done on mock-infected cells incubated with the compounds for three days; the MCC value was defined as above."}
