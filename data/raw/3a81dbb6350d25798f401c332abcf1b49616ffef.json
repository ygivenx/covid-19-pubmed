This class of antiviral agent has always been 45 touted as having a high barrier to resistance (Jordheim et al., 2013) . The typical explanation for 46 this high barrier is that amino acid substitutions in the active site of the viral RNA polymerase 47 conferring resistance to the antiviral ribonucleoside also impair the specificity and/or efficiency 48 of incorporation of natural ribonucleotides (Carroll et al., 2003) . Elimination of the most-fit 49 members of the viral population by an antiviral agent requires that resistance emerge from the 50 surviving, low-fitness member of the population, which would ultimately require restoration of 51 fitness for the population to survive the myriad mechanisms of host restriction (Andino and 52 All rights reserved.

Restoration of fitness may be the insurmountable barrier precluding the 53 development of resistance to chain-terminating antiviral ribonucleotides. 54\n\nThis study was designed to determine the extent to which single-cell analysis of antiviral 55 agents can contribute to our understanding of antiviral therapeutics relative to traditional 56 approaches. We describe a microfluidics device that can be used to produce complete dose-57 response curves. We have used this device to compare three, mechanistically-distinct classes of 58 antiviral agents: a PV polymerase inhibitor (2'-C-methyl-adenosine, 2'-C-Me-A); a PV protease 59 inhibitor (rupintrivir); and two HSP90 inhibitors (geldanamycin, GA, and ganetespib, GS). We 60 find that single-cell analysis distinguishes these classes of inhibitors. We suggest that addition of 61 single-cell analysis to the existing paradigm for preclinical development of antiviral therapies 62 may have the potential to identify leads with limited potential for development of resistance. 63 All rights reserved.

Our initial foray into 65 single-cell analysis of PV infection dynamics used cell density to control single-cell occupancy 66 of wells of a microfluidic device (Guo et al., 2017) . What this means practically is that most 67 wells are empty. Reducing the number of events monitored by a mere factor of two takes us 68 below the number of events required for statistical analysis of the data. Acquisition of a dose-69 response curve was therefore impossible using this first-generation device. 70\n\nTo address this problem, we created a multi-layer device as previously described (Fig. 1a ) 71 (Guo et al., 2017) but added a trapping structure to the channel layer of the device (Figs. 1b and 72 S1a). Position of the trapping structure was guided by simulation ( Fig. 1c) , leading to placement 73 of the trapping structure on the rear wall of each well (Fig. 1d) . The device contains five 74 independent zones, each containing 1140 wells for a total of 5700 wells. The device mounts 75 easily to the stage of a microscope (Fig. S1b) ; the device in cross-section is shown in Fig. S2 . 76\n\nSingle-cell occupancy of the device was sensitive to the width of the channels used for loading 77 ( Fig. S3a ) and cell density ( Fig. S3b) with maximum occupancy near 90% (Figs. 1d and S3) . 78\n\nUnder conditions in which an inhibitor reduces infection to 10%, ~100 infected cells will be 79 observed using this device. This number of events is more than enough for statistical analysis. 80 All rights reserved.

Each well is monitored for 109 eGFP fluorescence every 30 min for a 24 h period, which gives rise to a population of time 110 courses exhibiting substantial between-cell variability (Fig. S4a) . We plot the percentage of 111 infected cells as a function of drug concentration and fit to a hyperbola to obtain a value for the 112 IC50 value. In the case of 2'-C-Me-A, concentrations greater than 50 \u00b5M exhibit toxicity 113 (Stuyver et al., 2006) ; therefore, these data do not fit to a hyperbola (Fig. S4b) . It is clear from 114 this experiment, however, that the approach is sensitive enough to acquire data for a complete 115 dose-response analysis (Fig S4b) . 116 All rights reserved.

To analyze the single-cell data, we use five phenomenological 118 parameters extracted from each time course (Fig. S4c) . These parameters are: maximum 119 fluorescence observed, which correlates to yield of genomic RNA; slope at the time of half-120 maximum fluorescence, which correlates to replication speed; infection time, which, to a first 121 approximation, is the time it takes for an infection to go from start to finish akin to the virus was most sensitive to 2'-C-Me-A was unexpected but could be easily rationalized by the notion 140 All rights reserved.

This outcome with rupintrivir is clearly distinct from that above with 2'-157 C-Me-A. We conclude that not all antiviral agents interfere with the viral population in the same 158 manner or at the same stage(s) of the lifecycle. 159 All rights reserved.

An earlier study 181 did not observe an impact of GA prior to virus assembly; however, it is possible that a reduction 182 of the magnitude shown here would be concealed by experimental error (Geller et al., 2007) . 183 Because infection is monitored by eGFP, which requires virus entry, genome replication, and 184 genome translation, interference with any of these steps would lead to a reduction in the number 185 of eGFP-positive cells. It is clear, however, that translation and folding of eGFP are not altered in 186 the presence of the highest concentration of GA used in this experiment (Fig. S5) . 187\n\nAnalysis of the single-cell data is presented in Tables S5 and S6. The mean of the 188 distribution of values for the maximum parameter did not change in the presence of GA (Fig. 3b) , 189 in contrast to the inhibitors targeting viral proteins.

A statistically significant difference for mean of the distributions for the 192 remaining parameters was observed at concentrations corresponding to the IC50 and above (Figs.  193   3c, 3e and 3f) . A third signature of antiviral action is therefore revealed with GA. 194 Given the interest in using HSP90 inhibitors as therapeutics for cancer, a variety of 195 compounds exist (Hwang et al., 2009; Sidera and Patsavoudi, 2014) . For example, ganetespib 196 (GS) is an HSP90 inhibitor that differs from GA substantially in chemical structure (compare 197 inset in Fig. S6 to that in Fig. 3a) , has a higher affinity for HSP90 than GA for GA (Fig. S6) . In this case, it is clear that mechanistically identical compounds yield identical 205 signatures at the single-cell level. 206 All rights reserved.

The long-term utility of an antiviral therapy is 215 determined, in part, by the time required for resistance mutants to emerge. One approach to 216 delaying or even eliminating the emergence of drug-resistant mutants is the use of antiviral 217 combinations (Dunning et al., 2014; Hofmann et al., 2009) . What is often evaluated is the ability 218 of two drugs to exhibit greater efficacy (synergy) in preventing infection in combination than 219 observed when either drug is used alone. We evaluated the ability of 2'-C-Me-A to synergize 220 with GA by treating cells with the concentrations of one or both at their IC50 values (Fig. 4a) . In 221 the absence of drug, 34 \u00b1 3% of cells in the device were infected. That number was reduced to 18 222 \u00b1 2%, 30 \u00b1 3%, or 15 \u00b1 3% in the presence of 2'-C-Me-A, GA, or the combination thereof, 223\n\nrespectively. Based on this observation alone, the conclusion would be that this combination of 224 antiviral agents is not even additive. Analysis of the entire single-cell dataset is presented in 225\n\nTables S9 and S10. Because 2'-C-Me-A exhibits the most substantial antiviral effect relative to 226 the DMS0 control, here we compare the combination to 2'-C-Me-A alone. We observed a 227 statistically significant difference for all parameters (Figs. 4b -4f ). Single-cell analysis therefore 228 has the ability to reveal efficacy of drug combinations masked at the population level. We 229 performed the comparable experiment with GS and reached the same conclusion (Fig. S7 , Tables 230 S10 and S11). 231 All rights reserved.

We reasoned that PCA might 243 provide an even more robust approach to compare datasets using our five parameters. As shown 244 in Fig. 5 , PCA resolves each class of inhibitor from the other, as well as from outcomes in the 245 absence of drug. Importantly, the mechanistically related but chemically distinct inhibitors of 246 HSP90 cluster by PCA (see GA and GS in Fig. 5) . We conclude that single-cell analysis of 247 antiviral therapeutics can provide not only information on the efficacy of a drug but also 248 information on the mechanism of action. This experimental paradigm should have a 249 transformative impact on the drug-development process. 250\n\nAll rights reserved.

Our first-generation microfluidic device for on-chip investigation of viral infection 279 dynamics relied on cell density as the mechanism to achieve isolation of single cells in wells of 280 the device, an approach which leaves most wells of the device empty (Guo et al., 2017) .

The outcome of 282 which is the ability to achieve single-cell occupancy of ~90% of the ~6000 wells of the device 283 (Figs. 1, S1-S3) . The enhanced occupancy enabled the complete characterization of antiviral 284 therapeutics by permitting the acquisition of complete dose-response curves (e.g. Fig. 2a) . 285\n\nThe three classes of antiviral therapeutics chosen target a viral polymerase (2'-C-286 methyladenosine, 2'-C- Me-A, Fig. S4) , a viral protease (rupintrivir, Fig. 2) , or a host factor, 287 HSP90, (geldanamycin, GA, Fig. 3; ganetespib, GS, Fig. S6 ). Our data-analysis pipeline 288 emphasizes five phenomenological parameters with correlates to traditional parameters for 289 assessment of the viral lifecycle. 7 The major finding of this study is that each class of antiviral 290 therapeutics exhibited a unique signature with respect to the five phenomenological parameters 291 measured and so much so that it was possible to use principal component analysis (PCA) to 292 stratify the different therapeutic classes (Fig. 5) . Importantly, both GA and GS overlapped by 293 PCA despite their substantial differences in structure and efficacy (Fig. 5) . 294\n\nTo our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of a range of antiviral 295 therapeutics on viral infection dynamics at the single-cell level. The resolution afforded by this 296 approach is unprecedented when compared to other cell-based approaches, which only provide a 297 measure of efficacy. Given the substantial effort required to go from compound to mechanism 298 using the traditional experimental paradigm, the ability of single-cell analysis to inform 299 mechanism should make this approach a welcome addition to the drug discovery and 300 development toolbox. It is not uncommon for analogues to be synthesized during the drug-301 development process that lose specificity or even function by a different mechanism of action, 302 single-cell analysis has the potential to reveal changes such as these at the start of the analysis 303 instead of much, much later in the development process. Finally, although we have used antiviral 304 agents to demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis, use of this technology and approach will 305 All rights reserved.
