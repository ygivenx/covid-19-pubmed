{"title": "Genomic relationship of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus to bovine coronavirus and human coronavirus OC43 as studied by the use of bovine coronavirus S gene-specific probes", "body": "Coronaviruses are important pathogens in animals and man. Two major antigenic groups of mammalian coronaviruses are distinguished. [13] .\n\nThe coronavirus genome consists of a single-stranded, nonsegmented RNA with positive polarity. Three to four major structural proteins are encoded: the nucleocapsid protein (N), the membrane protein (M) and the spike or peplomer protein (S). Members of the second antigenic group have an additional glycoprotein, the hemagglutinin esterase protein (HE). The S proteins of BCV and MHV are cleaved by host-cell proteases into two subunits of similar size, S 1 and $2, respectively [1, 3, 17] .\n\nGenome sequences of the hemagglutinating coronaviruses BCV and HCV-OC43, mainly concerning the genes coding for structural proteins, were published [6 -8, 10, 11, 19-21] . Homologies between the deduced aminoacid sequences of the BCV-L9 and HCV-OC43 structural proteins revealed the S protein to be less conserved (91.2% homology) than the N (97.5% homology), M (94% homology) and HE (95% homology) protein.\n\nTo date, studies on the HEV genome have not been conducted. In order to study the relationship of HEV to BCV and HCV-OC43 two probes were generated from the BCV S gene and investigated for their reactivities with HEV and HCV-OC43 by dot-blot hybridization assays.\n\nThe L9 [2] and the LY138 [4] strain of bovine coronavirus, the OC43 strain of human respiratory coronavirus [9] and the 67N-[ATCC VR 7419], VW572- [12] and NT9 [5] -strains of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus were propagated on the human rectal tumor cell line HRT-18 [ 14] . Canine coronavirus (ATCC VR-809) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (kindly provided by Dr. Frost, Staatl. Veterin/iruntersuchungsamt, Frankfurt, Germany) were grown on Crandell feline kidney cells (ATCC CCL-94). The virus suspensions were harvested from the supernatants of infected cells, partially purified fi'om cell debris and concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 70 000 x g for 1.5 h at 4 \u00b0C.\n\nAn indirect immunofluorescence assay was performed with monoclonal antibodies (Mab) I7, F7 and 116 which were shown to differentiate between BCV, HCV-OCA3 and HEV [16] . Virus infected cells were fixed with formaldehyde for 10 rain, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X in PBS for 6 rain and incubated each with Mab F7, I7 and I16 at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. After rinsing two times with PBS the slides were stained with an anti mouse IgG-FITC (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) at 37 \u00b0C forl h.\n\nRNA was isolated from virus-infected HRT-18 cells by the guanidinium-thiocyanate method using a RNA-isolation-kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturers' instructions.\n\nPrimers used for cDNA synthesis (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were chosen from the BCV-L9 S-gene sequence (EMBL/Gen Bank accession No. M 64667). Primers 3'S1 (5'-CACCATCTTGATFGAAAGCTAG-3') and 5' S 1 (5'-GCACTGATATTGTCGATGTTAC-3') were chosen to amplify a fragment of 726 bp located near the 5' -end of the Sl-glycoprotein gene of BCV corresponding to nucleotides 128-853 (Fig. 1) . For preparation of the probe located within the S2-g lycoprotein gene a nested PCR was performed. The outer primer pair 3' S2a (5'-AATATATCGTCAGGAGCCAATA-3' )/5' S2a (5' -ACACTACACAGTTGCAAGTAGCT-3') and the inner primer pair 3' S2b (5'-ATCACAACAACCACCACATATC-3')/5'S2b (5'-GGAGAAGGTTAATGAATGTGTCA-3') were used to amplify a fragment of 680 bp corresponding to the nucleotides 3378-4 058 (Fig. 1) .\n\nSingle-stranded cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript Plus RNase H-reverse transcriptase (GIBCO BRL, Eggenstein, Germany) and primer 3' S 1 or 3' S2a, respectively, at 47.5 \u00b0C for BCV and 42 \u00b0C for HEV according to the manufacturers' instructions.\n\nProbes were amplified in a reaction mixture adjusted to 1 x PCR buffer, 200 gM dATP, dGTP, and dCTP each, 160 g M dTTP and 40 la M DIG-11-dUTP (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), 400 nM of each primer and 0.5 U Tfl-polymerase (Biozym, Hameln, Germany) in a final volume of 50 gl with annealing temperatures of 58 \u00b0C.\n\nTo determine the detection limit of each probe log 2-dilutions ofa BCV-L9 suspension as well as a dilution series of homologous DNA in amounts ranging from 100 ng to 40 pg were directly applied to the nylon membrane.\n\nFor dot blot hybridization assays log-2 dilutions of each virus starting with 5 x 105 TCIDs0were adjusted to 1 x SSC (0.015 M NaCitrat, 0.15 M Nacl, pH 7.0) and directly applied to a positively charged nylon membrane (Boehringer, Mannhein, Germany) presoaked with H20 and equilibrated with 20 x SSC, by means of a dot-blot apparatus (Biorad, Mttnchen, Germany). Blots were air dried and viral RNA was fixed and denatured by UV-illumination for 5 min (TFL-20M, Biometra, G6ttingen, Germany). Prehybridization and hybridization were basically done according to the manufacturers instructions (DIG luminescent detection kit for nucleic acids, Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). Prehybridization was performed at 42 \u00b0C for 4 h followed by an incubation with hybridization solution containing 30 ng/mI of freshly denatured Digoxigeninlabeled probe at 42 \u00b0C overnight. Membranes were washed twice at room temperature for 5 min in 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS and then twice for 15 min at moderate (50 \u00b0C) or high (60 \u00b0C) stringency conditions in 0.1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS. The hybridization signals were immunologically detected according to the manufacturers directions. The blots were exposed to a X-Ray film for 7 h.\n\nNon-radioactive sequencing reactions were performed using the prism ready reaction dye-deoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (ABI, Applied Biosystems Inc., Weiterstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturers instructions. Further analysis was done on the AB1373A sequencer using standard protocols from ABI. The PCR products were purified for sequencing with the Quiaquick-spin PCR purification kit (Quiagen, Chatsworth, CA). 300 ng purified DNA were used as template for each sequencing reaction. The primers used for sequencing were 3' S2b and 5' S2b as well as two additional primers (3' $3: 5' -TATAGTTAGCAGCACAGGTA-3' ; 5' $3: 5' -GCT-GAACATTTCAACACCC-3' ). For detailed DNA sequence analysis the DNASTAR software package (DNASTAR Inc., London, U.K.) was used.\n\nThe indirect immunofluorescence assay results gained by the use of Mabs, previously published by Vautherot et al. [16] , revealed different reaction patterns between the bovine, human and porcine coronavirus strains (Table 1) . Mab J7 only [16] bSpecific for the BCV-S gtycoprotein, no antigenic cross reactivity with other hemagglutinating coronaviruses ~Specific for the BCV-S glycoprotein, antigenic cross reactivity with HCV-OC43 dSpecific for the BCV-S glycoprotein, antigenic cross reactivity with HCV-OC43 and HEV reacted with BCV. Mab F7 recognized BCV as well as HCV-OC43 and Mab I16 recognized HEV-67N, -NT9 and -VW572, additionally.\n\nUsing the $1 probe, the minimal detectable amounts of the BCV-L9 virus suspension were 7.8 x 103 and 3.1 x 104 TCIDs0 and the minimal detectable amounts of homologous DNA were 781 pg and 3.12 ng at washing temperatures of 50 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C, respectively. By hybridization with the $2 probe the detection limit was lower. With this probe 3.9 x 103 TCIDs0 of BCV-L9 or 390 pg DNA at 50 \u00b0C and 1.5 x l04 TCIDs0 or 781 pg DNA at 60 \u00b0C could be detected.\n\nThe hybridization results are shown in Fig. 2 . In general both probes did not react with viruses belonging to the antigenic unrelated group (CCV, FIPV) or with mock infected cells (data not shown). The S 1 probe hybridized with BCV and HCV-OC43 \n\nA fragment of 680 bp of the HEV S gene was amplified with the BCV-specific primer pair 3'$2 and 5'$2. 645 bases (corresponding to position 3384-4028, EMBL: M64667) of this fragment were sequenced on both strands (Fig. 3) . Fourty-eight mismatches were found in HEV compared to the corresponding BCV-L9 sequence (EMBL: M64667) and 52 compared to HCV-OC43 (EMBL: Z21849). No insertions or deletions occured. The resulting nucleotide sequence homology was 92.6% with BCV-L9 and 91.9% with HCV-OC43.\n\nHybridization and sequencing results presented in this paper indicate a high degree of genomic relationship of HEV to BCV and HCV-OC43. However, the two BCV S gene-specific probes used for cross hybridization experiments were able to differentiate these three hemagglutinating coronaviruses.\n\nThe S 1 probe failed to detect HCV-OC43 by hybridization under high stringency conditions. This result reflects the nucleotide sequence data. Alignment of the published genome sequences of the region corresponding to the $2 probe in BCV and HCV-OC43 revealed 24 mismatches. In contrast, 41 mismatches as well as 24 insertions into the HCV-OC43 genome occured in the sequence corresponding to the S 1 probe [7, 19] .\n\nThe failure of the S 1 probe to hybridize to HEV even under moderate stringency hybridization conditions and the failure of the $2 probe to detect HEV under high stringent hybridization conditions indicated that the S genes of HEV and BCV or HCV-OC43, respectively, were less related. This hypothesis was further confirmed by PCR results utilizing the BCV Sl-and S2-specific primers. Both primer pairs produced amplicons of the expected length from HCV-OC43 cDNA. In contrast, a specific amplicon from HEV cDNA could be synthesized only with the $2 primers. The nucleotide sequence analysis of this 680 bp-amplicon (HEV strain 67N) and the alignment with the corresponding sequence in BCV and HCV-OC43 revealed a lesser degree of homology between HEV-67N and BCV-L9 (92.6%) or HCV-OCA3 (91.9%) than exists between BCV-L9 and HCV-OC43 (96.3%).\n\nSequence data of the S genes of BCV and HCV-OC43 revealed a high degree of homology between their deduced aminoacid sequences (91.2% identity). As compared to the $2 protein (95.3% homology) greater sequence divergence occured in the S 1 protein (88% homology) [7, 11, 19] . The hybridization results presented in this paper indicate that the $2 region of HEV-67N is similarly conserved, as it is reported for BCV and HCV-OC43 [7, 11, 19] .\n\nThe failure of the S 1 probe to hybridize with HEV and the obvious lack of the BCV S 1-specific primers during HEV-PCR are indicative of a higher degree of genotypic divergence between HEV and BCV or HCV-OC43, respectively, than there is between BCV and HCV-OC43.\n\nSimilar differences were demonstrated on the phenotypic level. HEV, BCV and HCV-OC43 share colm~on antigenic determinants but they can be differentiated by their reactivities with certain anti-BCV Mabs [15, 16] . Identical results were obtained for the coronavirus strains used in this study by immunofluorescence assays with Mabs directed against different S 1 epitopes, which were published by Vautherot et al. [16] .\n\nHEV was recently shown to have a strong tropism to neurons in experimentally infected young mice [18] . In naturally infected newborn pigs the virus spreads to the central nervous system via peripheral nerves. BCV and HCV-OC43, in contrast, have a tropism to the respiratory and enteric tract [17] . It could be hypothesized that divergences in the putative bulbous part (SI) of the S protein are related to tissue tropism. The complete amino acid sequence of the HEV S protein is needed to provide the knowledge for studying its possible role in tissue tropism."}
