{"title": "", "body": "Thinning of the iris with loss of normal iris color. Loss of normal pupillary constrictor function resulting in sluggish pupil light reflex in an old cat.\n\n\u2022 Iris coloboma (p 1304)\n\nNotch-like or sectorial defect in structure of the iris. Unusual.\n\n\u2022 Persistent pupillary membranes (p 1304)\n\nSmall strand-like structures going from one part of the iris collarette to another, to the anterior lens capsule or to the posterior corneal surface. Rare.\n\nSmall brown to black cyst-like structures commonly found at the pupil margin which may become more obvious with pupil dilation. May be semi-transparent.\n\n\u2022 Pre-iridal fibrovascular membranes* (p 1303)\n\nNew vessels growing across the anterior surface of the iris giving the iris a pink injected appearance. An intra-ocular neoplasm, a retinal detachment or signs of chronic inflammation may be evident. There may be secondary hyphema or glaucoma.\n\n\u2022 Iris neoplasia*** (p 1297)\n\nDiffuse iris melanoma appears as a brown to light tan discoloration, which is rapidly progressive over the iris surface over weeks to months. It usually occurs in older cats, and is usually unilateral. Lymphosarcoma appears as bilateral iris swelling, and anterior chamber hemorrhage, in a young cat with or without other signs suggesting a multicentric location. Ciliary body adenoma is rare, and appears as a slow-growing whitish to cream mass behind the pupil margin. Metastatic neoplasia from an extra-ocular primary tumor is an intra-ocular neoplasm involving the iris, and is associated with a similar neoplasm remote from the eye, e.g. mammary or uterine adenocarcinoma.\n\nSigns of anterior uveitis such as blood, fibrin or cloudiness in the anterior chamber, miosis, or general reddening or thickening of the iris in a FeLV-positive cat. Bilateral iris swelling from lymphosarcoma may be present.\n\nSigns of anterior uveitis such as blood, fibrin or cloudiness in the anterior chamber, miosis, or general reddening or thickening of the iris and/or swelling associated with lymphosarcoma in a FIV-positive cat.\n\nSevere anterior fibrinous uveitis, usually bilateral, in a young cat. Other signs of FIP such as anorexia, weight loss, depression, pyrexia, abdominal or chest effusions and/or multifocal neurological disease.\n\n\u2022 Bartonella henselae (cat-scratch fever) (p 1305)\n\nTypically, naturally infected cats only develop subclinical disease, although anterior uveitis has been reported.\n\n\u2022 Toxoplasma gondii*** (p 1296)\n\nSigns may be acute, or chronic and intermittent. Fever, lethargy and anorexia with various combinations of respiratory, hepatic, ocular and neurological signs.\n\nThe most common cause of changed iris appearance is inflammation, most commonly associated with infectious agents, although inflammation secondary to neoplasia and immune-mediated disease may also occur.\n\nImportant pathophysiologic processes involved in iris inflammation (anterior uveitis) include breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier associated with increased vessel permeability, release of chemical mediators following tissue damage, and chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leukocytes.\n\nThe most important chemical mediators are probably the arachidonic acid derivatives released from damaged cell membranes, which then participate in the cyclo-oxygenase and the lipoxygenase pathways. Prostaglandins produced by the cyclo-oxygenase pathway are regarded as the most important chemical mediators. Oxygen free radicals may also be important.\n\nWhile most types of immunologic responses are thought to occur in the eye, types II (antibody-mediated cytotoxic responses), III (immune-complex deposition and complement activation) and IV (cell-mediated cytotoxic responses) are thought to be the most important. Monocytes and macrophages are important in Fungal:\n\n\u2022 Fungal infections (Cryptococcus neoformans, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, Histoplasma capsulatum)** (p 1302)\n\nFever, depression, anorexia and weight loss combined with signs of other organ disease such as involvement of lung, liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes, CNS and/or eyes. Typically there is chorioretinitis progressing to anterior uveitis and endophthalmitis associated with positive serological evidence of an infectious cause, or identification of an organism in anterior chamber fluid. Fungal uveitis has a geographic distribution.\n\n\u2022 Cuterebra larval migration (ophthalmomyiasis) (p 1305)\n\nVision loss, poor PLR and characteristic track-like lesions in the tapetal fundus, with or without anterior uveitis.\n\n\u2022 Ocular dirofilariasis (p 1305)\n\nUveitis occurs associated with presence of adult filaria in the eye. Rare.\n\n\u2022 Lymphocytic-plasmacytic uveitis* (p 1302)\n\nChronic gray to slightly tan nodules in the anterior stromal surface of the iris.\n\n\u2022 Idiopathic uveitis* (p 1302)\n\nUveitis in a cat where extensive investigation does not reveal a possible etiology.\n\n\u2022 Penetrating injuries to the iris** (p 1299)\n\nChanges may occur in the iris appearance associated with trauma, including fibrinous adhesions to adjacent structures, tears in the iris proper or iris prolapse through the outer ocular coats, i.e. the cornea and sclera. Penetrating foreign bodies may or may not be obvious.\n\ncontinued phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation to T cells.\n\nImmune-mediated responses to retinal or lens antigens may be important in immune-mediated uveitis where no infectious cause is identified.\n\nSome neoplastic diseases, e.g. intra-ocular lymphosarcoma can look very inflammatory, whereas others (e.g. diffuse iris melanoma) tend to cause gross pigment changes without necessarily causing an inflammatory response until the disease becomes very advanced.\n\nChanges which can be seen in association with inflammation of the iris (anterior uveitis) include:\n\n\u2022 Generalized reddening (hyperemia) and thickening of the iris. \u2022 Frank hemorrhage from the iris surface. \u2022 Fibrinous exudation resulting in cream to redcolored solid opacities in the anterior chamber, or over the surface of the iris. \u2022 Miosis. \u2022 Grayish nodules on the iris surface which represent localized aggregations of lymphoid cells. \u2022 Gray to tan, dot-like, or sometimes coalescing opacities on the endothelial surface of the cornea (called keratic precipitates). \u2022 Cloudiness of the aqueous fluid (called aqueous flare). \u2022 Deposits of pigment or inflammatory cell debris on the anterior lens capsule. Adhesions of the pupil margin to the lens may occur (called posterior synechiae). If synechia are extensive, there may be anterior bowing of the iris (called iris bomb\u00e9) and a shallow anterior chamber. \u2022 Anterior cortical cataract. \u2022 Iris cysts, either attached to the pupillary margin or free floating in the anterior chamber. \u2022 Anterior vitreous opacity due to inflammation of the pars plana of the ciliary body (\"pars planitis\"). This change is especially associated with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection. \u2022 Corneal vascularization. \u2022 Engorgement of the deep episcleral vessels. \u2022 Lens subluxation or luxation. This is usually due to inflammatory destruction of ciliary zonules, but may result from secondary glaucoma, which causes globe enlargement and zonule stretching.\n\nDiseases which alter iris appearance can arise in and be confined to the iris, they can result from disease processes involving other parts of the eye, or they can be a localized manifestation of systemic disease.\n\nMost diseases which alter iris appearance are inflammatory. Investigation of many cases of anterior uveitis for a possible infectious cause may not identify an etiologic agent, and so many cases of uveitis in the cat are regarded as \"idiopathic\". Most cases of idiopathic uveitis probably involve an autoimmune response to an unidentified endogenous antigen.\n\nSevere inflammation in a young cat is more likely to have an infectious etiology and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) should be considered as one of the more likely possibilities.\n\nA change in pigmentation in an older cat is more likely to be due to neoplasia.\n\nIris atrophy secondary to degenerative changes is a common incidental finding in may old cats.\n\nCongenital abnormalities such as persistent pupillary membranes or iris colobomas are seen far less commonly.\n\n\u2022 Severe anterior fibrinous uveitis, usually bilateral, in a young cat. \u2022 Other signs of FIP such as anorexia, weight loss, pyrexia, abdominal or chest effusions, multifocal neurological disease.\n\nSee main references on page 372 for details (The Pyrexic Cat).\n\nInfection is thought to be acquired by inhalation or ingestion.\n\nThe virus replicates in the tonsils, epithelial cells of pharynx, respiratory mucosa and small intestine then infects monocytes, which disseminate the virus throughout the body.\n\nThe effusive form of the disease is thought to occur in cats with poor cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses, and the non-effusive form in cats with partial cellmediated immunity.\n\nThe effusive form is associated with immune complexmediated vasculitis.\n\nThe non-effusive form is characterized by pyogranulomatous and granulomatous lesions in many organs in particular eyes, brain, liver and kidney.\n\nInitially mild upper respiratory tract signs may occur, but usually go unnoticed.\n\nGenerally the disease is seen in young cats less than 1-2 years of age.\n\nAnorexia, pyrexia, weight loss and malaise are typical. Other signs including icterus, abdominal distention, dyspnea and multifocal neurological signs are variably present.\n\nIn the eye, the most common presenting sign is a fibrinous uveitis. Fibrinous exudation results in cream to red-colored solid opacities in the anterior chamber, or over the surface of the iris.\n\nOther signs of anterior uveitis such as blood or cloudiness in the anterior chamber, miosis, general reddening or thickening of the iris, and injection of deep episcleral vessels may be evident.\n\nA presumptive diagnosis is initially based on a combination of the clinical signs and laboratory findings. FIP should be suspected especially when a bilateral fibrinous uveitis occurs in a young cat.\n\nHematology and biochemistry may be helpful but are not definitive. Changes typical of FIP include a mild normocytic, normochromic anemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis and lymphopaenia, elevated total serum proteins, and a polyclonal gammopathy due to elevated alpha-2 globulins and gamma globulins.\n\nSerology is usually regarded as being of dubious benefit in the diagnosis, as the FIP coronavirus cross-reacts with enteric forms of coronavirus.\n\nDiagnosis can only be confirmed on characteristic histopathology of affected tissues on biopsy or necropsy examination. Typical change is described as a pyogranulomatous vasculitis. Necrosis and a fibrinoid response are seen in some cases.\n\nNo treatment will cure the disease, which is invariably fatal. There is no prognosis for long-term survival, especially for cases with the effusive form. Cases with uveitis only may have a slightly better long-term prognosis.\n\nRecent interest has been shown in the use of recombinant alpha interferon at doses ranging between 10 000-30 000 IU/kg given SQ daily for short-term remission of signs.\n\nPalliative therapy traditionally has included the use of corticosteroids, including topical 0.5% prednisolone acetate applied to the eyes q 6-8 h for cases with uveitis.\n\nCats which are anorexic and depressed, and do not respond to supportive therapy, should be euthanized.\n\n\u2022 Fever, weight loss, inappetence, malaise.\n\n\u2022 +/-Muscle or joint pain.\n\n\u2022 +/-Signs of respiratory, hepatic and/or neurological disease. \u2022 Typical signs of anterior uveitis.\n\nSee main references on page 375 for details (The Pyrexic Cat) and page 958 (The Cat With Generalized Weakness).\n\n\u2022 Ingestion of tissue cysts (bradyzoites) from an intermediate host (most common) or \u2022 Ingestion of sporulated oocysts from soil or water (far less common) or \u2022 Transplacental transmission (rare).\n\nAfter ingestion a gut replication cycle occurs. The cat is the definitive host and is the only species in which this occurs. This results in the production of unsporulated (non-infective) oocysts which are passed in feces. The oocysts sporulate in the environment after 1-5 days and become infective. Intestinal replication will also result in the formation of tachyzoites (active acute infection) or bradyzoites (inactive latent infection).\n\nActivation of bradyzoites, typically found in muscle, brain and liver, may occur because of other disease states such as FIV, which act as stressors or immunosuppressors. High-dose corticosteroid use has been known to activate dormant T. gondii infections.\n\nWhen bradyzoites are activated, they undergo rapid replication causing destruction of tissue and inciting an inflammatory response in various tissues, notably the central nervous system, uveal tract of the eye, liver and lungs.\n\nSigns may be acute, or chronic and intermittent. The acute fatal form occurs mostly in kittens.\n\nMuscle or joint pain may be evident.\n\nDyspnea is common in kittens and cats with the acute form, and is associated with pneumonia.\n\nSigns of liver disease such as jaundice, enlarged liver, ascites or elevated liver enzymes.\n\nOcular signs, especially anterior uveitis, chorioretinitis and optic neuritis. The organism may cause a lymphocytic-plasmacytic uveitis evidenced by gray to tancolored nodules on the iris surface.\n\nDiagnosis may be based initially on the clinical signs, but obtaining supportive laboratory data is essential in making a definitive diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Demonstration of a rise in IgM titers indicates a recent active infection. \u2022 Comparison of levels of aqueous humor T. gondii antibody levels with serum levels (Goldman-Witmer coefficient or C-value) has been advocated to determine that anterior uveitis has been caused by T. gondii, although the use of C-values is still controversial.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the organism in inflamed tissues or fluid samples by histology, immunohistochemistry, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques.\n\nClindamycin (Antirobe, Upjohn) at a dose rate of 12.5 mg/kg twice daily for 3-4 weeks is usually effective against the organism. If no response is evident after 3 weeks of antibiotic therapy, reconsider the diagnosis.\n\nConcurrent anti-inflammatory therapy decreases the anterior uveitis, e.g. topical 0.5% prednisolone acetate drops applied bid-qid.\n\n\u2022 Diffuse pigmentary change across the anterior iris surface. \u2022 Mass lesions bulging forward from the anterior iris stroma or distorting normal pupil shape.\n\nVarious tumors occur in the iris such as melanoma, lymphosarcoma, sarcoma and ciliary body tumors.\n\nDiffuse iris melanoma arises as a primary neoplasia of the iris stroma, and is the most common primary intraocular neoplasm seen in cats.\n\nLymphosarcoma results from invasion of neoplastic lymphocytes from the peripheral circulation.\n\nIntra-ocular sarcoma usually occurs as a sequel after (usually years) trauma causing penetrating injury to the lens. It is believed that the sarcoma arises from transformed lens epithelium. This neoplasm forms solid masses within the eye, which metastasize rapidly, usually via the optic nerve.\n\nCiliary body tumors may represent primary neoplasia or metastatic neoplasia from an extra-ocular site.\n\nDiffuse iris melanoma typically appears as an enlarging area over months to years of light tan to dark brown pigmentation on the iris surface. Usually the neoplasm does not form an obvious discrete mass, but the iris may become diffusely thickened. The disease is usually unilateral and typically occurs in older cats.\n\n\u2022 Presentation may more resemble uveal inflammation than neoplasia. \u2022 Sometimes the disease may present in an advanced state with secondary glaucoma. \u2022 Amelanotic diffuse iris melanomas have also been reported.\n\nLymphosarcoma and post-traumatic sarcoma more commonly form discrete masses within the eye. Lymphosarcoma often presents as bilateral iris swelling, and anterior chamber hemorrhage in a young cat, with or without other signs suggesting multicentric neoplasia.\n\nCiliary body adenoma is a rare, slow-growing neoplasm, which appears as a whitish to cream mass behind the pupil margin.\n\nMetastatic neoplasia from an extra-ocular primary tumor appears as an intra-ocular neoplasm involving the iris, and is associated with a similar neoplasm remote from the eye, e.g. mammary or uterine adenocarcinoma.\n\nDiagnosis is based initially on the appearance of the iris and consideration of the history.\n\nAmelanotic diffuse iris melanomas are difficult to diagnose unless the effects of the tumor on angle obstruction and resultant glaucoma are observed.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis may be obtained by fine-needle aspirate biopsies or anterior chamber centesis and cytology.\n\nDiffuse iris melanoma needs to be differentiated from other causes of pigmentation of the iris and can look similar to: \u2022 A benign pigmented nevus, which appears as a flat pigment spot in the iris. A nevus will be observed not to have changed in size with serial examination. \u2022 Post-inflammatory pigmentation. A detailed history may reveal previous bouts of anterior uveitis within the eye. This pigmentation will not be progressive.\n\nEnucleation of an eye with diffuse iris melanoma is recommended if: \u2022 There is evidence of rapid spread of a diffuse iris melanoma. The eye should be reassessed frequently to determine if the pigmentary change is progressive. \u2022 Pigmentary change is seen near or in the iridocorneal angle on gonioscopy. \u2022 A change in pupil shape or mobility occurs. \u2022 Secondary glaucoma develops.\n\nEvidence of metastasis may still occur as late as 2-3 years after enucleation.\n\nIf there is a high suspicion or confirmation of an intraocular sarcoma it requires immediate enucleation with exenteration of orbital tissue. Prognosis is still guarded and most cats will eventually die from metastatic disease within months.\n\nSystemic chemotherapy for lymphosarcoma can be attempted unless the eye is already affected by secondary glaucoma. For more detail see main reference on page 432 (The Yellow Cat or Cat With Elevated Liver Enzymes).\n\n\u2022 Corneal lacerations. \u2022 Mis-shapen pupil margin and bulging of iris tissue into the corneal defect. \u2022 Visible iris tear. \u2022 Blood and fibrin in the anterior chamber.\n\nInjuries to the iris usually occur in conjunction with injuries to the adjacent cornea or sclera.\n\nIf the corneal injury is large, the iris may prolapse through the cornea and plug the defect.\n\nTrauma to the eye may result in a variety of changes to the iris including: \u2022 Visible iris tears. \u2022 Iris prolapse through the corneal wound.\n\nA black, bulging membrane will be seen with associated fibrin. The pupil margin is mis-shapen associated with the iris moving forward into the corneal defect. \u2022 Fibrinous adhesions to adjacent structures.\n\nFibrin and blood in the anterior chamber (hyphema) are often present with trauma.\n\nAssociated lens injury may occur, which may be difficult to appreciate without removing fibrin from the anterior chamber and dilating the pupil.\n\nA penetrating foreign body may or may not be evident.\n\nDiagnosis is based purely on the appearance of the iris on careful examination.\n\nSurgical repair is recommended. This might include replacement of iris tissue into the anterior chamber with suturing of the corneal defect. Viscoelastic substances and mydriatics can be used to push the iris away from the cornea.\n\nIntra-ocular surgery may be required to remove a damaged lens to prevent destruction of the eye by severe lens-induced intra-ocular inflammation. If the lens is severely traumatized then eye ablation would be recommended to reduce the possibility of later posttraumatic intra-ocular sarcoma development.\n\n\u2022 Loss of normal iris color and increased transparency of the iris in an old cat. \u2022 Sluggish pupillary light reflex (PLR).\n\nIris atrophy is an age-related atrophy and thinning of iris structures, especially the anterior stroma, pupil margin and associated pupillary constrictor muscle.\n\nIris atrophy occurs in old cats, and appears as loss of normal coloration and increased transparency of the iris because of loss of pigment in the anterior iris stroma. This may be especially obvious in old Siamese cats or other color-dilute cats with blue irides. The iris can become so thin that it may take on a transparent appearance.\n\nThere may be some loss of normal pupillary light reflex (PLR) associated with atrophy of the pupillary sphincter. In old cats with iris atrophy, pupil shape is often retained, but the PLR is not as brisk as in a younger cat. It is unusual to see atrophy to the degree sometimes seen in old dogs, where notch-like defects occur, with thin connecting strands across the defect.\n\nIf the pupil becomes very dilated, the equator of the lens may become visible.\n\nDiagnosis is based principally on a consideration of age and clinical signs.\n\nThere is no treatment for iris atrophy.\n\n\u2022 Discrete iris or ciliary body masses (FeLVassociated lymphosarcoma). \u2022 Anterior uveitis, fibrin and blood in the anterior chamber. \u2022 Otherwise unexplainable intermittent asymmetric changes in pupil size, shape or response. \u2022 Other FeLV-associated signs, e.g. anemia.\n\nSee main references on page 540 for details (The Anemic Cat) and page 350 (The Thin, Inappetent Cat).\n\nFollowing oral or nasal exposure to the virus, there is viral replication in oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue. If the immune response to the virus is ineffective in eliminating it, there is replication of virus in bone marrow, which leads to viremia, FeLV-related diseases or latent infection. Infection with the virus is known to cause a number of neoplasms, including alimentary, mediastinal, renal, spinal, retrobulbar or lymph node forms as well as a number of hematologic lymphoid malignancies involving different bone marrow precursors.\n\nA viral neuritis can also be caused by FeLV, and affect parasympathetic or sympathetic efferent fibers to the iris in feline spastic pupil syndrome.\n\nFeLV is also associated with uveitis.\n\nDiscrete iris or ciliary body masses, which cause gross distortion of iris structure, and are usually bilateral.\n\nFibrin and/or blood may be evident in the anterior chamber indicating the presence of anterior uveitis.\n\nSpastic pupil syndrome is associated with FeLV neuritis. Vision is retained, but one or both pupils are intermittently miotic or dilated over weeks or months, and they do not dilate appropriately with darkness. For more detail see main reference on page 878 (The Cat With Anisocoria or Abnormally Dilated or Constricted Pupils).\n\nDiagnosis is based on the clinical signs observed in the eye, in association with other signs suggestive of FeLV, e.g. multicentric lymphoma, FeLV-associated anemia.\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed on clinical pathology including hematology and cytology of lymph nodes or aqueous centesis samples which demonstrate neoplasia.\n\nA positive serological test for FeLV antigen suggests association of the neoplasm or spastic pupil syndrome with FeLV infection. For more details of testing see main reference on page 543 (The Anemic Cat).\n\nFor more detail see main reference on page 544 (The Anemic Cat) Treatment of the ocular condition in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy might include topical corticosteroids such as 0.5% prednisolone acetate drops given q 6-12 h. Prognosis for the eye will be poor to guarded if secondary glaucoma has occurred. \n\nIn general, all deep fungal infections enter the body by the inhalation of aerosolized spores leading to either fungal rhinitis (e.g. Cryptococcus) or pneumonia (e.g. blastomycosis, histoplasmosis) with subsequent dissemination to other parts of the body, including the eye, by hematogenous or lymphatic spread.\n\nThe initial ocular site for establishment of infection is usually the choroid, while the anterior uveal tract is often involved later in the course of the infection.\n\nThe different intra-ocular fungi vary in their geographical distribution. \u2022 Blastomycosis is caused by a dimorphic fungus, which grows as a yeast in mammalian tissue and as a mycelial form in the environment. Found in the USA (in the midwestern and southeastern states along the Mississipi, Ohio and Missouri Rivers and occasionally mid Atlantic states), Central America, parts of Asia, Africa, Europe and Israel. Close proximity to water may be a factor in its geographical distribution. \u2022 Cryptococcosis is caused by a budding capsulated yeast-like fungus with more worldwide distribution. C. neoformans is shed in pigeon feces and can be found in soil or in avian excreta. C. neoformans var. gatti is found in the developing flower of some Australian Eucalypt trees (red river gums and forest red gums). High concentrations of organisms are found in the bark and the accumulated debris surrounding the base of the tree. These trees have been widely exported around the world from Australia. \u2022 Histoplasmosis is caused by a dimorphic fungus which forms a free-living mycelial form and yeastlike organisms in mammalian tissues. Found in central USA especially in Ohio, Mississippi and Missouri River basins and in Central and South America. There is association with moist humid conditions, nitrogen-rich soils, and bat and bird excrement. \u2022 Coccidioidomycosis is caused by a soil mycelial organism with a natural resevoir in desert soils and around animal burrows. Found in Southwestern USA, Mexico, Central and South America. Animal infection occurs by inhalation of arthrospores, which can transform into spherules and then endospores in lung tissue.\n\nTypically, there is anorexia, depression, fever and weight loss combined with other systemic signs which can involve many other organs, especially the lungs, brain, nasal cavity but also the orbital tissues, lymph nodes, bones, toenails and skin.\n\nMost intra-ocular fungal infections cause either:\n\n\u2022 Choroidal granulomas which are typically evident on fundoscopy as a raised area of tapetal hyporeflectivity, or small swollen brownish discolored areas in the tapetal and non-tapetal retina. \u2022 Generalized chorioretinitis and secondary retinal detachments. This may progress to anterior uveitis and endophthalmitis. \u2022 Optic neuritis, which is seen as a red, swollen optic nerve that is hyperemic. \u2022 Anterior uveitis, which appears as anterior chamber flare, miosis and an inflamed discolored iris. \u2022 Vision loss and reduced pupil light reflexes in affected eyes.\n\nInitial diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation of a cat with a rapidly progressive, usually bilateral chorioretinitis progressing to anterior uveitis, with signs of other systemic disease, and occurring in a geographic area where such fungal disease is known to occur.\n\nImaging techniques can be used to obtain more supportive evidence of a deep fungal infection: \u2022 Thoracic radiography for pulmonary granulomas.\n\n\u2022 Nasal cavity radiography.\n\n\u2022 Ocular ultrasound for signs of retinal detachment.\n\n\u2022 Cerebrospinal fluid. \u2022 Samples taken by centesis of vitreous or subretinal exudate. \u2022 Histopathology of enucleated globes. \u2022 Bone marrow biopsy samples (histoplasmosis). \u2022 Lung or lymph node aspirates or draining tracts.\n\nSerological tests can be performed, looking for elevated: \u2022 Antibodies (blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidiodomycosis). \u2022 Antigen -Cryptococcal capsular antigen in blood, CSF, or urine is sensitive and specific.\n\nAntifungal medications. Drug chosen should be based on results of fungal culture and sensitivity where possible. Treatment may need to be prolonged, depending on response.\n\n\u2022 Itraconazole 100 mg PO daily with food.\n\n\u2022 Fluconazole 50 mg PO q 8 hours.\n\n\u2022 Amphotericin B. See page 26 (The Cat With Signs of Chronic Nasal Disease) for description of administration in a subcutaneous infusion of glucose and sodium chloride to reduce the renal toxicity.\n\nTopical steroids or non-steroidals may be used to control the anterior uveitis.\n\nSupportive therapy is important until anti-fungal medication is effective.\n\nEnucleation of the eye is recommended if endophthalmitis and/or secondary glaucoma develop.\n\nGuarded to grave in most cases where there is systemic involvement.\n\n\u2022 Signs of uveitis.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral iris swelling associated with neoplasia.\n\nSee main references on page 330 for details (The Thin, Inappetent Cat) and page 399 (The Cat With Enlarged Lymph Nodes).\n\nOcular disease including uveitis, glaucoma, infiltration of inflammatory cells in the posterior chamber (pars planitis), focal retinal chorioretinitis and retinal hemorrhages have been reported associated with FIV infection.\n\nNeoplasia including lymphoma (often extra-nodal) have been associated with the terminal stage of the disease, although the exact role of FIV in the neoplastic process is unclear.\n\nSigns of anterior uveitis, e.g. miosis, injected iris surface, anterior chamber flare, fibrin.\n\nDiscrete iris or ciliary body masses causing iris swelling, which is associated with lymphosarcoma.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the clinical signs of uveitis or lymphosarcoma in a FIV-positive cat, and failure to identify any other possible cause.\n\n\u2022 Gray to tan nodules on the anterior surface of the iris. \u2022 Keratic precipitates.\n\nLymphocytic-plasmocytic uveitis stems from an immune-mediated process, which results in the formation of numerous lymphoid nodules within the anterior uveal tract. It is probably a response to endogenous antigens, and in some cats, Toxoplasma is regarded as a possible cause.\n\nTypically there are gray to tan nodules on the anterior surface of the iris.\n\nOpacities occur on the endothelial surface of the cornea (keratic precipitates) Aqueous flare (cloudiness of the anterior chamber due to suspended proteins and cells)\n\nPre-iridal fibrovascular membranes occur in the chronic stages.\n\nSecondary glaucoma, lens luxation and globe enlargement occur in the chronic stages.\n\nDiagnosis is based principally on the appearance of the iris.\n\nCytology of aqueous humor usually reveals lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells.\n\nThere is no cure for this disease. Once the nodules have been formed they will never go away completely with therapy, however treatment will control the inflammation and reduce the incidence of the secondary sequelae.\n\nPrednefrin Forte (Allergan -1%) applied q 8-12 h. Sterofrin (Alcon -0.5%) q 6-8 h reducing to effect.\n\n\u2022 Flurbiprofen (Ocufen 0.03%) applied q 8-12 h.\n\nMydriatics such as atropine are rarely indicated because of the side effects of salivation seen in cats and the chronic nature of the disease.\n\n\u2022 Continuing steroid or NSAID therapy.\n\n\u2022 Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (Dorzolamide 2% topically tid). \u2022 Topical beta-blockers, e.g. timolol maleate 0.5% applied bid-tid.\n\nLaser cyclo-photo-coagulation in chronic cases nonresponsive to medical treatment.\n\nGlaucoma will often be refractory to treatment.\n\n\u2022 New vessels growing across the anterior surface of the iris giving the iris a pink injected appearance. \u2022 \u00b1 Intra-ocular neoplasm, detached retina and/or uveitis.\n\nPre-iridal fibrovascular membrane (PIFM) formation is associated with angiogenic factors released by proliferating intra-ocular neoplasms, retinal hypoxia or chronic inflammation.\n\nPIFMs appear as new vessels growing across the anterior surface of the iris, giving the iris a pink discoloration.\n\nBecause PIFM formation is associated with intraocular neoplasms, retinal detachment or chronic inflammation, these abnormalities may be evident on careful examination of the eye.\n\nPIFMs may be associated with secondary hyphema or glaucoma.\n\nOccasionally the vessels in PIFMs may be visible leaving the pupil margin and migrating across the anterior lens capsule.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the characteristic appearance of the fibrovascular membranes on the anterior stromal surface of the iris.\n\nOccasionally an underlying cause may be apparent, e.g. a ciliary body epithelial tumor at the pupil space or a total retinal detachment.\n\nIris neoplasia, especially secondary neoplasms of the iris arising in some other part of the body, e.g. lymphosarcoma resulting in hyphema.\n\nAcute inflammation resulting in pinkish injection of the anterior iris surface.\n\nThere is no treatment for PIFMs except for treatment of the underlying chronic diseases, which may be associated with the condition. Once formed the PIFMs will remain permanently on the iris surface.\n\n\u2022 Signs of uveitis.\n\n\u2022 Extensive laboratory investigations fail to identify possible etiology.\n\nIdiopathic uveitis is characterized by any signs of anterior uveitis such as miosis, injected iris surface, anterior chamber flare, and fibrin, where extensive laboratory investigations fails to identify a possible etiology.\n\nOne study showed there may be a significant positive association of idiopathic anterior uveitis with high aqueous titers to herpesvirus.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the clinical signs of uveitis with failure to identify a possible cause.\n\n\u2022 Strands of iris-like tissue arising from the iris collarette and crossing the pupil space, or attaching to the cornea or lens. \u2022 Dot-like gray to black opacities on the endothelial surface of the cornea or the anterior capsule of the lens unassociated with history of previous inflammation within the eye. \u2022 Rare in cats.\n\nPersistent papillary membrane is an embryonic structure, and results from failure of the pupillary membrane to rarify in late fetal life.\n\nThe pupillary membrane is formed from mesoderm, which, until regression, forms a solid sheet of tissue bridging the pupil space from the iris collarette. In normal adult cats, the collarette appears as a slightly raised region halfway between the pupil margin and the iris root.\n\nThe condition is seen rarely in cats compared to the frequency with which it is seen in dogs, and rarely seems to affect the pupil light response or pupil shape.\n\nPersistent papillary membrane appears as fibrous strands of iris-like tissue running from the:\n\n\u2022 Iris collarette to another region of the iris collarette.\n\nThe iris collarette is a raised area approximately half way between the iris root and the pupillary margin. \u2022 Iris to anterior capsule. \u2022 Iris to posterior corneal surface (most common).\n\nThe strands can be very thin and magnification may be required to visualize them.\n\nPersistent papillary membrane may also appear as dotlike gray to black opacities on the endothelial surface of the cornea or the anterior capsule of the lens, unassociated with history of previous inflammation within the eye.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the characteristic appearance of the PPMs on careful ocular examination.\n\nThe gray opacities formed by PPMs which attach to the corneal endothelium should be differentiated from keratic precipitates, formed as a result of anterior uveitis. A strand of tissue attaching the opacity to the iris and the absence of other signs of anterior uveitis is diagnostic of a PPM.\n\nNo treatment is indicated for PPMs.\n\n\u2022 Segmental full-thickness defect of the iris with lens visible behind the defect. \u2022 Remaining iris is normal. \u2022 May also cause an abnormal pupil shape. \u2022 Rare in cats.\n\nThe defect is a rare anomaly that may be detected in a young cat, and results in a notch-like or sectorial defect in the iris.\n\nIris coloboma appears as thinned to absent iris stroma in a radial sector of the iris. The remaining iris appears normal.\n\nSmall strands, which are remnants of the iris dilator muscle, may be seen bridging the space formed by the defect.\n\nAbnormal pupil shape (dyscoria) may be present.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the characteristic appearance of iris coloboma on ocular examination.\n\n\u2022 Pigmented cyst-like structures, translucent on illumination, in the anterior chamber or attached to the pupil margin. \u2022 Rare in cats.\n\nIris cysts appear as brown-or black-pigmented cystlike structures freely floating in the anterior chamber, or attached to the posterior pigmented epithelium of the iris at the pupil margin. They may be more obvious with pupil dilation.\n\nIris cysts occur as a congenital abnormality, or occur as a result of inflammation, and are uncommon in cats.\n\nIris cysts are usually partly translucent on focal light illumination.\n\nDiagnosis is based purely on the characteristic appearance of iris cysts on ocular examination.\n\nClassical signs \u2022 Vision loss. \u2022 Cloudy posterior segment with linear track-like lesions on fundoscopy.\n\nClassical signs-Cont'd \u2022 Typical signs of anterior uveitis associated with larva in the anterior chamber.\n\nMigration of cuterebra larva through the eye causes vision loss and poor pupillary light reflexs.\n\nCharacteristic signs on fundoscopy include linear hyper-reflective \"tracks\" in the tapetal fundus, linear light gray areas of reduced pigmentation in the non-tapetum and cloudy posterior segment. The white body of a fly larva is sometimes seen associated with one of the tracks.\n\nSometimes the larva is seen in the anterior chamber with associated signs of anterior uveitis.\n\nDiagnosis is based on appearance of the suspicious fundoscopic lesions, or on the observation of the parasite in the anterior chamber with the associated uveitis.\n\n\u2022 White filarial worm in the anterior chamber associated with typical signs of anterior uveitis.\n\nImmature adult dirofilaria are rarely found in the anterior chamber, and are associated with signs of corneal edema and/or anterior uveitis.\n\nDiagnosis is on observation of a filarial-like parasite within the anterior chamber on ocular examination."}
