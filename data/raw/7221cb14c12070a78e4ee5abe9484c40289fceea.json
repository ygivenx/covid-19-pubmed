{"title": "A novel bat coronavirus reveals natural insertions at the S1/S2", "body": "The unprecedented epidemic of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, HCoV-19, in 30\n\nChina and beyond has caused public health concern at a global scale. Although bats are 31 regarded as the most likely natural hosts for HCoV-19 1,2 , the origins of the virus remain unclear. 32\n\nHere, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a 33 metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China 34 between May and October, 2019. RmYN02 shared 93.3% nucleotide identity with HCoV-19 at 35 the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene in which it was the 36 closest relative of HCoV-19. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to 37\n\nHCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-38 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, however, and in a similar manner to 39 RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the 40 author/funder. All rights reserved.

In December 2019, viral pneumonia caused by an 55 unidentified microbial agent was reported, which was soon identified to be a novel 56 coronavirus 4 , now termed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of 57 Viruses 5 and HCoV-19 by a group of Chinese scientists 6 . The number of patients infected with 58\n\nHCoV-19 has increased sharply since January 21, 2020, and as of March 2rd, 2020, more than 59 80,000 confirmed HCoV-19 cases have been reported, with >11,000 severe cases and >2900 60 deaths in China. By the end of January confirmed HCoV-19 cases were present in all the 61 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. and feces (n=78). All but three bats were sampled alive and subsequently released. Based on 89 the bat species primarily identified according to morphological criteria and confirmed 90 through DNA barcoding, the 224 tissues and 78 feces were merged into 38 and 18 pools, 91 respectively, with each pool including 1 to 11 samples of the same type (Extended Data Table  92 1). These pooled samples were then used for next generation sequencing (NGS). polymorphisms in the NGS data, although these did not include the S1/S2 cleavage site 104 (Extended Data Figure 3) . Only a few reads in the remaining 55 pools could be mapped to 105 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. (Fig. 1a) . RmYN02 and HCoV-19 were extremely similar (>96% sequence identity) in 112 most genomic regions (e.g. 1ab, 3a, E, 6, 7a, N and 10) (Fig. 1a) . In particular, RmYN02 was 113 97.2% identical to HCoV-19 in the longest encoding gene region, 1ab (n=21285). However, 114\n\nRmYN02 exhibited far lower sequence identity to HCoV-19 in the S gene (nucleotide 71.8%, 115 amino acid 72.9%), compared to 97.4% amino acid identity between RaTG13 and HCoV-19 116 (Fig. 1a) . Strikingly, RmYN02 only possessed 62.4% amino acid identity to HCoV-19 in the RBD, 117\n\nwhereas the pangolin beta-CoV from Guangdong had amino acid identity of 97.4% 7 , and was 118 the closest relative of HCoV-19 in this region. A similarity plot estimated using Simplot 10 also 119 revealed that RmYN02 was more similar to HCoV-19 than RaTG13 in most genome regions 120 (Fig. 1b) . Again, in the RBD, the pangolin/MP789/2019 virus shared the highest sequence 121 identity to HCoV-19 (Fig. 1c) . 122 123 Results from both homology modelling 1 , in vitro assays 2 and resolved three-dimensional 124 structure of the S protein 11 have revealed that like SARS-CoV, HCoV-19 could also use ACE2 125 as a cell receptor. We analyzed the RBD of RmYN02, RaTG13, and the two pangolin beta-126 CoVs using homology modelling (Fig. 2a-2f and Extended Data Figure 4 for sequence 127 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The amino acid deletions in RmYN02 RBD made two loops near the receptor 128 binding site that are shorter than those in HCoV-19 RBD (Fig. 2a and 2f) . Importantly, the 129 conserved disulfide bond in the external subdomain of SARS-CoV (PDB: 2DD8) 12 , HCoV-19 130 (PDB: 6LZG), RaTG13 (Fig. 2b) , pangolin/MP789/2019 (Fig. 2c) and pangolin/GX/P5L/2017 131 (Fig. 2d) was missing in RmYN02 (Fig. 2f) . We speculate that these deletions may cause 132 conformational variations and consequently reduce the binding of RmYN02 RBD with ACE2 133 or even cause non-binding. It is possible that the bat SARS-related CoVs with loop deletions, 134 including RmYN02, ZXC21 and ZC45, use a currently unknown receptor. In contrast, RaTG13 135 . 149 author/funder.

The insertion of polybasic 152 amino acids at the cleavage site in the HAs of some AIV subtypes is associated with enhanced 153 pathogenicity 16, 17 . Notably, HCoV-19 is characterized by a four-amino-acid-insertion at the 154 junction of S1 and S2, not observed in other lineage B beta-CoVs 18, 19 . This insertion, which 155 represents a poly-basic (furin) cleavage site, is unique to HCoV-19 and is present in all HCoV-156 19 sequenced so far. The insertion of three residues, PAA, at the junction of S1 and S2 in 157 RmYN02 ( Fig. 2h and Extended Data Figure 2 ) is therefore of major importance. Although the 158 inserted residues (and hence nucleotides) are not the same as those in RmYN02, and hence 159 are indicative of an independent insertion event, that they are presented in wildlife (bats) 160 strongly suggests that they are of natural origin and have likely acquired by recombination. 161\n\nAs such, these data are strongly suggestive of a natural zoonotic origin of HCoV-19. More notable was that RmYN02 was the closest relative of HCoV-19 in most of the virus 170 genome, although these two viruses were still separated from each other by a relatively long 171 author/funder.

In the spike gene tree, HCoV-19 clustered 172 with RaTG13 and was distant from RmYN02, suggesting that the latter virus has experienced 173 recombination in this gene ( Fig. 3b and Extended Data Figure 6 ). In phylogeny of the RBD, 174\n\nHCoV-19 was most closely related to pangolin-CoV/GD, with the bat viruses falling in more 175 divergent positions, again indicative of recombination ( Fig. 3c and Extended Data Figure 7) . 176\n\nFinally, phylogenetic analysis of the complete RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, 177 which is often used in the phylogenetic analysis of RNA viruses, revealed that RmYN02, 178\n\nRaTG13 and HCoV-19 formed a well-supported sub-cluster distinct from the pangolin viruses 179 and southeast Asia. Generally, they do not migrate over long distances and are highly 186 gregarious such that they are likely to live in the same caves, which might facilitate the 187 exchange of viruses between them and the occurrence of recombination. Notably, RaTG13 188 was identified from anal swabs and RmYN02 was identified from feces, which is a simple, but 189 feasible way for bats to spread the virus to other animals, especially species that can utilize 190 cave environments. 191 192 Based on the currently available data we propose that HCoV-19 likely originates from multiple 193 author/funder.
