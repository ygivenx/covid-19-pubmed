{"title": "Origin and Evolution of Viruses", "body": "The complexity of mutant spectra can infl uence disease progression and viral pathogenesis, as demonstrated using virus variants selected for increased replicative fi delity. Complementation and interference exerted among components of a viral quasispecies can either reinforce or limit the replicative capacity and disease potential of the ensemble. In particular, a progressive enrichment of a replicating mutant spectrum with interfering mutant genomes prompted by enhanced mutagenesis may be a key event in the sharp transition of virus populations into error catastrophe that leads to virus extinction. Fitness variations are infl uenced by the passage regimes to which viral populations are subjected, notably average fi tness decreases upon repeated bottleneck events and fi tness gains upon competitive optimization of large viral populations. Evolving viral quasispecies respond to selective constraints by replication of subpopulations of variant genomes that display higher fi tness than the parental population in the presence of the selective constraint. This has been profusely documented with fi tness effects of mutations associated with resistance of pathogenic viruses to antiviral agents. In particular, selection of HIV-1 mutants resistant to one or multiple antiretroviral inhibitors, and the compensatory effect of mutations in the same genome, offers a compendium of the molecular intricacies that a virus can exploit for its survival. This chapter reviews the basic principles of quasispecies dynamics as they can serve to explain the behavior of viruses.\n\n* Dedicated to Manfred Eigen on the occasion of his 80th birthday, for the insights that his pioneer studies have represented for virology.\n\nThe quasispecies theory of molecular evolution was fi rst proposed to describe the error-prone replication, self-organization, and adaptability of primitive replicons such as those thought to have populated the earth some 4000 million years before the present ( Eigen, 1971 ( Eigen, , 1992 Eigen and Schuster, 1979 ; see Chapter 1). Quasispecies was formulated initially as a deterministic theory involving mutant distributions of infinite population size in equilibrium. Extensions and generalizations to ensembles of genomes of fi nite population size replicating in changing environments have been developed ( Eigen, 2000 ; Wilke et al. , 2001a Wilke et al. , , 2001b Saakian and Hu, 2006 ) . Virologists use the term \" viral quasispecies \" to mean complex distributions of non-identical but closely related viral genomes subjected to genetic variation, competition and selection, and which act as a unit of selection (reviewed in different chapters of Domingo, 2006 ) . More simple and general, a quasispecies has been defi ned as a population of similar genomes ( Nowak, 2006 ) . Quasispecies dynamics is most clearly manifested in systems such as RNA viruses that display short duplication times, generally high fecundity, and errorprone replication, traits that have been maintained despite a probable ancient origin of most extant RNA viruses in coevolution with a cellular world. Increasing numbers of careful analyses of viral populations have supported quasispecies dynamics for animal and plant RNA viruses (for recent examples see Ge et al. , 2007 ; Zhang et al. , 2007 and references included in these articles; see also other chapters of this book).\n\nAs discussed by Villarreal in Chapter 21, there are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of RNA viruses and other RNA genetic elements: that they are remnants of an ancient RNA world, or that they are modern derivatives of cells, originated in cellular RNAs that acquired autonomous replication. Viroids and other subviral RNA replicons may be direct descendants of early RNA (or RNA-like) replicons that preceded an organized cellular world ( Robertson et al. , 1992 ) (Chapter 2). Cells and viruses share a considerable number of essential functional domains or modules: polymerases, proteases, enzymes involved in nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism, etc. However, on the basis of key proteins involved in viral replication, that are absent in cells, and also based on the evidence of extensive genetic exchange between diverse viruses, the concept of an ancient virus world has been proposed ( Koonin et al. , 2006 ) . A primordial pool of genetic elements could have been the ancestor of viral and cellular genes. Cells and viruses share a ubiquitous ability to modify, lose, or acquire new genes or gene segments through genomic rearrangements, insertions, deletions, and other recombination events. Shuffl ing of functional modules among cells, viruses, and other replicons (plasmids, episomes, transposons, retrotransposons) is probably a frequent occurrence through fusion, transfection, conjugation, and other types of horizontal gene transfers ( Botstein, 1980 ; Hickey and Rose, 1988 ; Zimmern, 1988 ; Davis, 1997 ; Holland and Domingo, 1998 ; Bushman, 2002 ) . Sequence comparisons strongly suggest that all extant viruses have deep, ancient evolutionary roots ( Gorbalenya, 1995 ; Villarreal, 2005 ) (Chapter 21).\n\nOne of the critical features that distinguishes cells from viruses is the difference in the complexity of their genetic material, even after accounting for repeated DNA in animal and plant cells. Complexity in this case means the amount of genetic information encoded in their genetic material. A typical mammalian cell includes a number of chromosomes amounting to a total of about 3 \u03eb 10 9 base pairs (bp) of DNA. The chromosomal DNA of Escherichia coli has a complexity of about 4 \u03eb 10 6 bp. In contrast, RNA viruses have genomes in the range of 3.0 \u03eb 10 3 to 3.2 \u03eb 10 4 nucleotides. Point mutation rates for eukaryotic cells have been estimated to be in the range of 10 \u03ea 10 \u03ea 10 \u03ea 11 substitutions per nucleotide (s/nt), while for bacterial cells, values may reach up to 10 \u03ea 9 s/nt ( Friedberg et al. , 2006 ) . Mutation rates for a number of genomic sites of RNA viruses, determined using both genetic and biochemical procedures, are in the range of 10 \u03ea 3 \u03ea 10 \u03ea 5 s/nt ( Drake, 1993 ; Drake et al. , 1998 ; Drake and Holland, 1999 ; Domingo, 2007 ) (Chapter 7). Despite mutation rates varying with a number of environmental parameters, the above values mean that, in the process of RNA replication or retrotranscription, each progeny genomic molecule of about 10 kb will contain on average 0.1 to several mutations. These determinations of mutation rates and frequencies suggest that even the viral progeny of a single infected cell will be genetically heterogeneous ( Domingo et al. , 1978 ; Holland et al. , 1982 ; Temin, 1989 Temin, , 1993 Domingo, 2006 Domingo, , 2007 ; see also other chapters of this book).\n\nPenetration into the composition of mutant spectra, either by determining the nucleotide sequence of many clones from the same population, or by other \" diving \" strategies, has quantitated large genotypic and phenotypic diversity within mutant spectra ( Duarte et al. , 1994a ( Duarte et al. , , 1994b N\u00e1jera et al. , 1995 ; Marcus et al. , 1998 ; Pawlotsky et al. , 1998 ; Qui\u00f1ones-Mateu et al. , 1998 ; Wyatt et al. , 1998 ; Fernandez et al. , 2007 ; Garcia-Arriaza et al. , 2007 ; Ge et al. , 2007 ; Zhang et al. , 2007 ) . Diversity can extend to multiple mutant and recombinant genomes within an infected organ, and even within a single infected cell. Diversity of genetic forms is a prerequisite for evolution, including the major transitions undergone by our biosphere ( Eigen, 1992 ; Maynard Smith and Szathmary, 1995 ) . RNA viruses have an exhuberant diversity to offer as a substrate for evolution. A virus population, by virtue of consisting of dynamic mutant spectra rather than a defi ned genomic sequence, has the potential to adapt readily to a range of environments.\n\nOne of the predictions of quasispecies dynamics of RNA viruses is the existence of an error threshold, defi ned as an average copying fi delity value at which a transition between an organized mutant spectrum and sequences lacking information contents occurs (reviewed in Eigen and Schuster, 1979 ; Eigen and Biebricher, 1988 ; Biebricher and Eigen, 2005 ; Nowak, 2006 ; Chapters 1 and 9) . This transition has been coined \" entry into error catastrophe, \" a term fi rst used by L. Orgel to describe errors during protein synthesis that could contribute to a collapse of cellular regulatory networks in the process of aging ( Orgel, 1963 ) . Both, the concept expressed by Orgel and the one applied to genetic information of viruses address deterioration of meaningful information with a biological consequence, due to errors in an informational macromolecule. The error threshold relationship establishes a limitation for the maximum complexity of genetic information that can be stably maintained by a replicon displaying a given copying accuracy (Chapter 1). Theoretical calculations of the range of mutation rates that should be compatible with maintenance of the information carried by the simple RNA bacteriophages were compatible with the mutation rates and frequencies found experimentally (compare Batschelet et al. , 1976 ; Domingo et al. , 1976 , 1978 , with Eigen and Schuster, 1979 Eigen and Biebricher, 1988 ) . In addition to intrinsic copying fi delity levels of viral polymerases, other biochemical features of virus replication may have evolved to preserve a minimal replication accuracy. It has been hypothesized that the \" rule of six \" (genome of polyhexameric length) in Mononegavirales that edit their phosphoprotein mRNA, may have evolved to prevent the negative effects of illegitimate editing that could result in error catastrophe ( Kolakofsky et al. , 2005 ) . Some biological systems exploit enhanced mutagenesis as a defense mechanism against invading molecular parasites. A mechanism known as \" repeatinduced point mutations (RIP) \" operates in some fi lamentous fungi such as Neurospora crassa resulting in the production of mutations in repeat DNA copies that penetrate into the cells ( Bushman, 2002 ; Galagan and Selker, 2004 ) . Also, the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases are innate immunity factors that induce hypermutation in retroviral DNA. Such activities can be regarded as a form of natural \" error catastrophe \" against retroviral genomes (see Chapter 8). Thus, a mutagenesis-based antiviral approach to drive virus to extinction has a parallel in natural mechanims which have contributed to the survival of organisms in the face of perturbing molecular parasites.\n\nIncreased genetic complexity as is embodied in cells required a correspondingly higher copying accuracy of the genetic material. This appears to have been accomplished with a number of pathways for post-replicative repair mechanisms as well as with the acquisition of a 3 \u0408 -5 \u0408 proofreading-repair exonuclease activity by most cellular DNA polymerases ( Goodman and Fygenson, 1998 ) . No evidence of a 3 \u0408 -5 \u0408 exonuclease activity in viral RNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases has been obtained from either biochemical or structural studies with viral enzymes ( Steinhauer et al. , 1992 ; Ferrer-Orta et al. , 2006 ) . A possible exception was presented in an early report by ( Ishihama et al. , 1986 ) showing that the infl uenza virus RNA polymerase was able to remove excess GMP residues added to a capped oligonucleotide primer. A 3 \u0408 -end repair mechanism has been described in a satellite RNA of the plant virus turnip crinkle carmovirus, involving synthesis of short oligoribonucleotides by the viral replicase using the 3 \u0408 -end of the viral genome as template, and, probably, template-independent priming at the 3 \u0408 -end of the damaged RNA to generate wild-type, negative strand, satellite RNA ( Nagy et al. , 1997 ) . Also, some coronaviruses encode a polymerase which includes a 3 \u0408 -5 \u0408 exonucleolytic activity (i.e. nsp14 of SARS) ( Minskaia et al. , 2006 ) . In the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus, mutations in the MSP14 exoribonuclease decreased replication fi delity (Eckerle et al ., 2007) .\n\nThe limitations imposed on average mutation rates to maintain the genetic information transmitted by simple RNA replicons ( Swetina and Schuster, 1982 ; Eigen and Biebricher, 1988 ; Nowak and Schuster, 1989 ) (Chapter 1) encouraged the fi rst experiments to investigate whether chemical mutagenesis was detrimental to RNA virus replication. The fi rst studies indicated that chemical mutagenesis could increase the mutation frequency by at most three-fold at defi ned genomic sites of poliovirus (PV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) , and 13-fold in the case of a retroviral vector ( Pathak and Temin, 1992 ) . Also, increased mutagenesis had an adverse effect on fi tness recovery of VSV clones ( Lee et al. , 1997 ) . These early results suggested that RNA viruses replicate near the error catastrophe threshold, with a copying fi delity that allows a generous production of error copies. Additional studies in cell culture and in vivo have established that enhanced mutagenesis can result in virus extinction (reviewed in Anderson et al. , 2004 ; Domingo, 2005 ) . Loeb and colleagues coined the term \" lethal mutagenesis \" to refer to the loss of virus infectivity associated with the action of mutagenic agents ( Loeb et al. , 1999 ) . Mutagenic nucleoside analogues, some used in antimicrobial and anticancer therapy, are currently actively studied as promoters of lethal mutagenesis of viruses, including an ongoing clinical trial with AIDS patients ( Harris et al. , 2005 ) .\n\nLethal mutagenesis is attracting increasing interest, and several theoretical models have addressed the mechanisms underlying lethal mutagenesis and the relationship between the observations on viral extinction and the original concept of error catastrophe (several models are reviewed in Chapter 1, and one model is described in Chapter 9). Key to the validation of these models as applied to RNA viruses is the experimental fi nding that a low viral load and low replicative fi tness (relative replication capacity) favor extinction ( Sierra et al. , 2000 ; Pariente et al. , 2001 ) , and that a mutagenic activity (not merely an inhibitory activity) is necessary to achieve extinction . This was shown by absence of extinction when the virus was subjected to equivalent inhibitory activities with cocktails of non-mutagenic inhibitors . However, since low viral loads favor extinction, the inhibitory activity that is associated with the action of some mutagenic agents may contribute to lethal mutagenesis. In this respect, a combination of a mutagenic nucleoside analogue and the antiretroviral inhibitor AZT was required to extinguish high fi tness HIV-1 during infections in cell culture ( Tapia et al. , 2005 ) . Even strong reductions in population size of highly debilitated foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) populations did not result in virus extinction unless a mutagenic activity intervened ( Sierra et al. , 2000 ; Pariente et al. , 2001 ; Pariente et al. , 2003 ) . A second fi nding to be considered in the development of theoretical models is the negative interference exerted by mutants that either coinfect the cells along with standard virus, or are generated inside the cell by mutagenesis. The interfering activity of such \" defector \" genomes as contributing to viral extinction has been documented both experimentally with FMDV and LCMV, and by in silico simulations ( Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al. , 2004 ; Grande-P\u00e9rez et al. , 2005b ; Perales et al. , 2007 ) . Production of a fraction of non-infectious hepatitis C virus (HCV) in infected patients as a result of ribavirin (1--Dribofuranosyl-1,2,3-triazole-3-carboxamide) therapy is a key parameter in the models of HCV clearance following treatment with ribavirin and interferon alpha (IFN-) ( Dixit et al. , 2004 ; Dahari et al. , 2007 ) (see Chapter 15 ).\n\nAn argument that has been used to deny a connection between lethal mutagenesis and the transition into error catastrophe has been the absence of hypermutated molecules in mutagenized populations of RNA viruses. However, any hypermutated genome transiently generated during mutagenesis is unlikely to be replication-competent and to be included in any sampling of viral genomes. This has been recognized by us ( Grande-P\u00e9rez et al. , 2005a ) and others ( Perelson and Layden, 2007 ) . Despite this, a genome with a mutation frequency lying in the lower range of typically hypermutated genomes was identifi ed in a population of 5-fl uorouracil (5-FU)-treated LCMV ( Grande-P\u00e9rez et al. , 2005a ) . The absence or very low frequency of hypermutated genomes in standard genome samplings of pre-extinction viral populations cannot constitute an argument against a mutagenesis-driven transition into error catastrophe.\n\nConcerning the relationship between the concept of error catastrophe and extinction of viruses by lethal mutagenesis, M. Eigen pointed out the following: (i) dependence of copying fi delity on sequence context and the type of mutagen; (ii) fi tness landscape of the quasispecies distribution, including the perturbing effects of specifi c types of mutants that may arise during mutagenesis (as discussed above); (iii) participation of multiple viral functions (not only RNA replication) in determining the replicative collapse of the system. As pointed out by Eigen, \" Theory cannot remove complexity, but it shows what kind of ' regular ' behavior can be expected and what experiments have to be done to get a grasp on the irregularities \" ( Eigen, 2002 ) .\n\nIn line with the application of the error threshold relationship to real viruses ( Eigen, 2002 ) , it is obvious that virus extinction will not occur through \" evaporation \" into the entire sequence space theoretically available to a viral genome. This is physically impossible. As mutagenesis progresses during viral replication myriads of end-point genomes harboring lethal or highly deleterious mutations will impede further expansions into sequence space by such genomes. This is a consequence of the multiple viral functions (not only RNA replication) that affect replicative competence ( Eigen, 2002 ) . These differences between the mechanisms that mediate extinction of real viruses and the original concept of error catastrophe can be expressed by distinguishing \" phenotypic \" and \" extinction \" thresholds from an \" error theshold, \" as has been done in some theoretical treatments (for example, Huynen et al. , 1996 ; Manrubia et al. , 2005 ) . Apart from these rather obvious adaptations of error catastrophe to a real biological system, the experimental studies carried out in the laboratory of one of us (E.D.) do not provide any basis to dissociate lethal mutagenesis from error catastrophe, as initially developed by Eigen, Schuster, and colleagues, and even less to consider that the approach to error catastrophe will impede viral extinction. In the section on \" Intra-mutant spectrum suppression can contribute to lethal mutagenesis \" in this chapter, we summarize our current view on the mechanisms that underlie virus extinction through lethal mutagenesis based on experimental results, and the main challenges facing, in our view, this new antiviral strategy.\n\nA viral quasispecies can have a biological behavior that is not predictable from the behavior of its components considered individually. Several observations with viruses as they replicate in cell culture or in vivo suggest that intra-population interactions can modulate the replicative capacity of the ensemble of mutants or of individual mutants introduced in a spectrum of mutants. Fitness of biological clones of bacteriophase Q ( Domingo et al. , 1978 ) and of VSV ( Duarte et al. , 1994a ) was lower than the fi tness of the average populations from which the clones were derived. These quantifi cations of clonal fi tness suggest that an ensemble of related mutants may collectively acquire a selective replicative advantage, perhaps because competent gene products may complement suboptimal or defective products expressed by subsets of components of the mutant spectrum. Specifi c mutants, including deleterious and lethal mutants, can be maintained in viral populations in vivo, and can be transmitted to susceptible hosts ( Moreno et al. , 1997 ; Yamada et al. , 1998 ; Aaskov et al. , 2006 ; Vignuzzi et al. , 2006 ) . A seemingly opposite manifestation of the internal interactions within viral quasispecies is the suppression of the replication of specifi c mutants by the surrounding mutant spectrum. This possibility was suggested by theoretical models according to which a simple replicon of inferior fi tness to another could nevertheless dominate the population by virtue of being surrounded by a more favorable mutant spectrum ( Swetina and Schuster, 1982 ) (reviewed in Eigen and Biebricher, 1988 ; Nowak, 2006 ) (Chapter 1). The fi rst experimental documentation of this prediction with real viruses was by de la Torre and Holland who showed that a standard VSV population interfered with the replication of a VSV clone of superior fi tness, unless the latter was present above a certain frequency in the population ( de la Torre and . Suppressive effects of this type have been subsequently documented in several virus-host systems (reviewed in Domingo, 2006 ) . Remarkable examples include suppression by attenuated PV of neuropathology in monkeys associated with virulent PV present in the vaccine preparation ( Chumakov et al. , 1991 ) , suppression of pathogenic LCMV by non-pathogenic variants ( Teng et al. , 1996 ) , the lowered replication rates of drug-resistant viruses ( Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005 ) , and complementing-interfering effects of specifi c FMDV mutants ( Perales et al. , 2007 ) .\n\nThe complexity of the mutant spectrum of a virus (that is, the average number of mutations that distinguish the individual components of the mutant distribution) can affect the course of viral disease and the response to treatment. Most notably, prolonged persistence of HCV infection correlated with high mutant spectrum complexity ( Farci et al. , 2000 ) ; other aspects of quasispecies behavior of HCV were reviewed in Domingo and Gomez, 2007 ) (see also Chapter 15). Studies with a PV mutant with an amino acid substitution in the viral polymerase which increases about fi ve-fold its template-copying fi delity have been particularly revealing. The mutant PV produces a narrower mutant spectrum (with a lower average number of mutations per genome) than wild-type PV. In infections of susceptible mice (transgenic for the human PV receptor) the mutant replicated in the animals but failed to reach the brain and to produce the neuropathology that was associated with the infection with wild-type PV ( Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005 ; Vignuzzi et al. , 2006 ) . Remarkably, restoration of the standard mutant spectrum complexity by subjecting the mutant PV to 5-FU-induced mutagenesis led to a neuropathogenic mutant spectrum ( Vignuzzi et al. , 2006 ) . Moreover, Sabin ' s attenuated PV vaccine shows relatively low mutant frequency compared with wild-type strains, and this observation could be due to differences in polymerase fi delity (Vignuzzi, personal communication; see also Chapter 6). These observations are highly relevant ( Biebricher and Domingo, 2007 ) . Foremost, the results show the biological relevance of high mutation rates, in that they may affect pathology by allowing the virus to reach specifi c target organs, thereby increasing viral loads and chances of transmission. The observed phenotypic transitions of PV demand consideration of the virus as a quasispecies, since PV behavior could not be explained by taking into account consensus genomic nucleotide sequences alone. We come to the conclusion that virus evolution can affect viral pathogenesis in at least two ways ( Domingo, 2007 ) : (i) The information for increased pathology or for adaptation to multiple environments can be contained in the genetic material of the virus (in most of its individual clones) irrespective of the mutant spectrum to which they belong ( Kimata et al. , 1999 ; Greene et al. , 2005 , among \n\nThe information for increased pathology can be contained in a distribution of mutants as such, as documented above for HCV and PV. Again, these observations reinforce the biological advantage of high mutation rates for the long-term survival of RNA viruses, and the consideration of entire quasispecies as the units of selection (see also Domingo, 2006 Domingo, , 2007 , and other chapters of this volume).\n\nThe PV polymerase mutant displaying higher fi delity than the wild type was obtained by passaging the virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of the nucleoside analogue ribavirin ( Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2003 ; Vignuzzi et al. , 2006 ) . The amino acid replacement in the polymerase (G64S) is located away from the catalytic domain of the enzyme, and an action at a distance was invoked to explain the general effect of this substitution on the copying fi delity ( Arnold et al. , 2005 ) (see Chapter 6). A mutant of FMDV, selected also by passaging the virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of ribavirin, displayed higher fi tness than the wild-type virus when virus replication took place in the presence of ribavirin but not in its absence ( Sierra et al. , 2007 ) . This phenotypic change was mapped to amino acid substitution M296I in the viral polymerase, and the mutant enzyme displayed decreased capacity to use ribavirin triphosphate as substrate (instead of GTP or ATP), but did not show an apparent alteration of general templatecopying fi delity ( Sierra et al. , 2007 ) . Substitution M296I is located at a loop whose fl exibility seems to be required to adapt its conformation and interactions to the size and shape of template residues and incoming nucleotide substrates. Ile at this position may restrict the loop fl exibility and affect nucleotide recognition ( Ferrer-Orta et al. , 2007 ) . M296 is quite distant from the site (G62) where the equivalent, ribavirin-selected substitution in PV lays. These results suggest that in the picornaviral polymerase multiple sites (perhaps domains) might be involved either in specifi c interactions with nucleotide analogues or in recognition of nucleotide substrates.\n\nComparison of the structure of the FMDV polymerase complexed with RNA ( Ferrer-Orta et al. , 2004 ) , and with RNA and a number of nucleotides and nucleotide analogues ( Ferrer-Orta et al. , 2007 ) has documented the involvement of multiple amino acids of the FMDV polymerase in the recognition of nucleotides. Several interactions are key to catalysis, as shown by modifi cation of the polymerase activity of the corresponding mutants produced by site-directed mutagenesis. Interestingly, some interactions are common to standard nucleotides and nucleotide analogues, while other interactions are specifi c for a given nucleotide analogue ( Ferrer-Orta et al. , 2007 ) . These results suggest that multiple sites in the polymerase can modulate substrate recognition, thereby affecting the fi delity properties of picornaviral (and probably other) polymerases ( Arnold et al. , 2005 ; Ferrer-Orta et al. , 2007 ) . These and other recent studies on the mechanism of substrate discrimination by viral RNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases are providing important information that may help in the design of drugs able to lower the copying fi delity of viral polymerases to facilitate lethal mutagenesis (see also Chapter 6).\n\nPopulations of RNA viruses subjected to increased mutagenesis by nucleoside analogues display decreases in specifi c infectivity due to accumulation of viral genomes harboring deleterious or lethal mutations ( Crotty et al. , 2001 ; Grande-P\u00e9rez et al. , 2002 , 2005b Airaksinen et al. , 2003 ; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al. , 2004 Arias et al. , 2005 ) . Mutagenized, pre-extinction FMDV RNA interfered with the replication of standard FMDV RNA, resulting in a delay and in a decrease in the production of progeny virus ( Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al. , 2004 ) .\n\nSince the interfering FMDV displayed at least a 0.1-fold fi tness relative to the standard FMDV ( Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al. , 2005 ) , the suppression observed could not be due to mechanisms invoking competition between genomes of comparable replication capacity (such as positive clonal interference). It was suggested that the expression (normal or aberrant) of altered viral proteins could contribute to the suppression of replication of standard FMDV, and also to the extinction of FMDV RNA. To test this hypothesis, a number of capsid and polymerase mutants of FMDV were examined regarding their capacity to interfere with standard FMDV, in experiments involving coelectroporation of cells with the relevant RNAs ( Perales et al. , 2007 ) . The results showed that an excess of several replication-competent mutants caused a strong and specifi c interference on FMDV replication. Furthermore, mixtures of some capsid and polymerase mutants evoked a very strong, synergistic interference ( Perales et al. , 2007 ) . Notably, some of the mutants tested had been isolated from mutagenized FMDV populations in their way towards extinction. These results with FMDV are in agreement with observations on enhanced mutagenesis of LCMV which resulted in populations in which the loss of infectious progeny production preceded the loss of replicating viral RNA ( Grande-P\u00e9rez et al. , 2005b ) . A deleterious effect on infectivity exerted by defective LCMV genomes was also supported by numerical simulations using realistic parameters of LCMV replication ( Grande-P\u00e9rez et al. , 2005b ) . The picture emerging from the studies with FMDV and LCMV is that the transition towards viral extinction associated with lethal mutagenesis can have at least two phases: an initial one, with a limited input of mutations in the viral genomes, in which a subset of defective genomes that have been termed \" defectors \" interfere with replication of standard genomes, and can contribute to viral extinction. This is termed the \" lethal defection model \" of virus extinction, proposed on the basis of experiments with LCMV ( Grande-P\u00e9rez et al. , 2005b ) , and supported by the strong interference on FMDV replication exerted by combinations of specifi c capsid and polymerase mutants of FMDV ( Perales et al. , 2007 ) . In a second phase, as the number of mutations per genome increases due to continuing mutagenesis, the proportion of lethal mutations increases, resulting in further decreases in specifi c infectivity ( Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al. , 2005 ; Grande-P\u00e9rez et al. , 2005b ) . In Chapter 6, Cameron and colleagues describe elegant experiments that show that low-fi delity mutants of poliovirus manifest an acceleration of the onset of lethal mutagenesis. Genomes with either deleterious or lethal mutations have been isolated from mutagenized FMDV and LCMV populations on their way towards extinction ( Sierra et al. , 2000 ; Pariente et al. , 2001 ; Arias et al. , 2005 ) . Some detrimental mutations may be maintained in the viral populations by complementation and whenever the genomes harboring them increase in frequency they may exert an interfering activity provided that the type of genetic lesion belongs to the interfering class ( Perales et al. , 2007 ) . Interestingly, some genomes harboring multiple mutations (for example a triple mutant in the polymerase of FMDV) that render the genome replicationincompetent may differ in a single nucleotide position from a replication-competent, strongly interfering mutant ( Arias et al. , 2005 ; Perales et al. , 2007 ) . Viral genomes with interfering or lethal mutations may occupy proximal or distant positions in sequence space, relative to the standard, non-mutated genome. Thus, there might be a gradual but overlapping transition between a phase of dominance of interfering mutants and a phase of increasing presence of lethal mutants, until a replicative collapse and virus extinction occur, in agreement with the theory of error catastrophe (see Chapter 1 for a discussion of the contribution of lethal mutants to error catastrophe). Recent biochemical data have documented that viral proteins are frequently multifunctional and that they often form oligomeric complexes. Thus, mutated forms of a given protein may affect multiple viral functions and result in inactive protein complexes (several examples can be found in Mesters et al. , 2006 ; Sobrino and Mettenleiter, 2008 ) . Abnormal behavior of altered viral proteins may be one of the molecular mechanisms underlying virus transition into error catastrophe, very much in line with the cascade of events initially proposed as a model for aging ( Orgel, 1963 ) .\n\nThe transition of FMDV and LCMV towards extinction by lethal mutagenesis occurred with a 10 2 -to 10 3 -fold decrease in specifi c infectivity (PFU/total viral RNA), and without a modification of the consensus sequence of the population ( Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al. , 2004 ; Grande-P\u00e9rez et al. , 2005a ) in agreement with results with poliovirus ( Crotty et al. , 2001 ) . Loss of infectivity was very sharp, and extinction occurred generally after 1-20 passages, depending on viral fi tness and the mutagen-inhibitor combination treatment (compare the extinction kinetics in Sierra et al. , 2000 ; Pariente et al. , 2001 Pariente et al. , , 2003 Grande-P\u00e9rez et al. , 2005a ) . Extinction can be preceded by minimal increase in the average mutation frequency of the mutant spectra ( Crotty et al. , 2001 ; Grande-P\u00e9rez et al. , 2005b ; Tapia et al. , 2005 ) . These experiments have not provided evidence that as the mutational load in the viral genome increases, the virus acquires resistance to extinction. It remains to be seen whether the presence of M296I in the FMDV RdRp, which was selected by ribavirin, confers any signifi cant resistance to lethal mutagenesis. The vulnerability of FMDV to extinction by lethal mutagenesis offers a signifi cant contrast with the resistance of FMDV to extinction despite accumulation of mutations as a result of plaque-to-plaque transfers (Escarmis et al. , 2002 (Escarmis et al. , , 2008 Lazaro et al. , 2003 ) .\n\nThe key difference between the two scenarios is that resistance to extinction (despite accumulation of mutations accompanying serial bottleneck events) results from the selection for a next transfer of a virus able to replicate thanks to the presence of compensatory mutations. This is in contrast to mutagenesis of a complex population whose suppressive effects do not allow the rescuing of replication-competent individuals .\n\nThe course of events preceding viral extinction that we have outlined here has a number of experimentally testable predictions, currently under study. Clarifi cation of the mechanisms underlying virus extinction may help in the design of improved protocols of administration of mutagenic agents and antiviral inhibitors for lethal mutagenesis. In our view, the main challenges facing progress in lethal mutagenesis are: (i) fi nding and design of new mutagenic base or nucleoside analogues that target viral (but not cellular) polymerases, that can be used in combination with antiviral inhibitors; (ii) evaluation of how widespread is the occurrence of mutagen-resistant virus mutants, and whether lethal mutagenesis may fail either because of the presence of mutagen-resistant mutations ( Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2003 ; Sierra et al. , 2007 ) or other mechanisms ( Sanjuan et al. , 2007 ) ; (iii) understanding of the molecular basis of templatecopying fi delity of nucleic acid polymerases, and the design of drugs that can lower specifi cally the copying fi delity of viral polymerases; (iv) the application of lethal mutagenesis to model systems in vivo ( Ruiz-Jarabo et al. , 2003a ; Harris et al. , 2005 ) . Concerning possible applications of lethal mutagenesis in vivo, measurements of the \" critical drug effi cacy \" -as developed for treatments of infections by HIV-1 and HCV ( Callaway and Perelson, 2002 ; Y. Huang et al. , 2003 ; Dahari et al. , 2007 ) -for mutagen-inhibitor combinations, should guide in establishing protocols adequate for viral clearance, to avoid stabilization of viral levels at a therapyinduced set point.\n\nOne of the consequences of the quasispecies dynamics of RNA viruses is fi tness variations in a constant environment triggered by changes in viral population size. Fitness is a complex parameter that measures the degree of adaptation of a living organism or simple replicons to a specifi c environment (as general reviews see Williams, 1992 , and Reznick and Travis, 1996 ) . For viruses, fi tness values have been measured as the relative ability of two competing viruses to produce infectious progeny reviewed in Domingo and Holland, 1997 ; Qui\u00f1ones-Mateu and Arts, 2006 ) . In the standard protocol, competitions are started by infecting cells or organisms with a mixture of a reference wild-type virus (given arbitrarily a fi tness value of 1) and the virus to be tested, in known proportions. The progeny viruses are used to initiate a second round of infection, and the process is repeated a number of times (serial infections). Then, the logarithm of the proportion of the two competing viruses at each passage defi nes a fi tness vector, the slope of which is the logarithm of the fi tness of the test virus relative to the reference virus ( Figure 4 .1 ). The two competing viruses must be distinguishable by some phenotypic trait (e.g. a clear difference in the ability to replicate in the presence of an antibody or a drug) or by some genetic change, such as nucleotide substitutions that allow the proportion of the two viruses to be determined by densitometry of a sequencing gel or by their specifi c amplifi cation by real time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using discriminatory oligonucleotide primers. Fitness determinations of viruses subjected to different passage regimes have established an important effect of population size of the virus involved in the infections, on fi tness evolution.\n\nAnimal viruses are likely to undergo genetic bottlenecks during transmission; most of the evidence suggesting bottleneck effects comes from sequence analysis of infected hosts (for instance, Frost et al. , 2001 ) , but Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard demonstrated bottlenecks during PV transmission from inoculated sites to the brain in transgenic mice expressing the human PV receptor ( Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2006 ) . In addition, there is direct evidence demonstrating that plant viruses experience signifi cant bottlenecks during movement from the site of infection ( Ali et al. , 2006 ; Jridi et al. , 2006 ) (see Chapter 12). RNA virus populations subjected to severe serial bottleneck events in cell culture-such as those occurring upon serial plaque-to-plaque transfers-undergo, on average, a decrease in fi tness ( Chao, 1990 ; Duarte et al. , 1992 ; Escarm\u00eds et al. , 1996 ; Yuste et al. , 1999 ; de la Iglesia and Elena, 2007 ) . This is due to the stochastic accumulation of deleterious mutations ( Figure 4 .2 ), predicted by M\u00fcller (1964) to occur for small populations of asexual organisms lacking in mechanisms, such as sex or recombination, that could eliminate or compensate for such debilitating mutations ( Maynard-Smith, 1976 viral population reduced to a single genome at the onset of plaque formation (extreme genetic drift), and high mutation rates.\n\nA study by Novella et al. (1995c) using VSV established that the extent of fi tness loss for any given bottleneck size depends on the initial fi tness of the viral clone under study. The higher the initial fi tness, the less severe must the bottleneck be to avoid fi tness losses. Debilitated viral clones often gain fi tness even when subjected to considerable bottlenecking ( Novella et al. , 1995a ( Novella et al. , , 1995c . Rather constant, stable fi tness values could be attained by choosing the appropriate bottleneck size, although occasional fi tness jumps were observed ( Novella et al. , 1996 ) . Escarm\u00eds et al. (1996 Escarm\u00eds et al. ( , 2008 examined the genetic lesions associated with M\u00fcller ' s ratchet by determining genomic nucleotide sequences of FMDV clones prior to and after undergoing repeated (up to 409) plaque-to-plaque transfers. The result was that fi tness loss was associated with unusual mutations that had never been seen in natural FMDV isolates or laboratory populations subjected to passages involving large viral populations. Particularly striking were an internal polyadenylate extension preceding the second functional AUG initiation codon of the FMDV genome, and amino acid substitutions at internal capsid residues. Additions or deletions of nucleotides have been frequently observed at homopolymeric tracts, particularly on pyrimidine runs in templates copied by proofreading-repair-defi cient polymerases ( Kunkel, 1990 ; Bebenek and Kunkel, 1993 ) . The experimental results suggest that only when the repeated bottlenecks limit the action of negative selection (elimination or decrease in proportion of low fi tness genomes) can such internal polyadenylate extensions (and other deleterious mutations) be maintained in the FMDV genome ( Escarm\u00eds et al. , 1996 . In contrast, sequence analysis of VSV genomes subjected to plaque-to-plaque passages did not show unusual mutations, with the possible exception of mutations in the RNA termini, which are uncommon in viruses evolving in regimes of acute replication ( Novella and Ebendick-Corpus, 2004 ) .\n\nFitness decrease upon subjecting FMDV to plaque-to-plaque transfers was biphasic: an initial decrease was followed by a highly fl uctuating pattern with a constant average fi tness value. The fl uctuating pattern followed a Weibull statistical distribution ( Weibull, 1951 ; Lazaro et al. , 2003 ) . A Weibull distribution describes disparate physical and biological processes. In the case of plaque-to-plaque transfers of a virus this type of distribution probably results from the multiple host-virus interactions that occur as the virus life cycle is completed, and alterations of such interactions as mutations accumulate in multifunctional viral proteins ( Lazaro et al. , 2003 ) . The studies of evolution of FMDV when subjected to many repeated serial bottleneck transfers revealed a remarkable resistance of the virus to extinction despite a linear accumulation of mutations in its genome , as well as the existence of multiple evolutionary pathways for fi tness recovery ( Escarm\u00eds et al. , 1999 ) (see also \" Intra-mutant spectrum suppression can contribute to lethal mutagenesis, \" above).\n\nFitness has often been considered a component of parasite virulence, defi ned as the capacity of parasites to infl ict damage upon their hosts. Indeed, very frequently an increase in viral fi tness parallels an increase of virulence. However, a comparative quantitative analysis of fi tness and virulence (cellkilling capacity) of an FMDV clone subjected to plaque-to-plaque transfers, and of its parental clone, revealed that fi tness and virulence can be two unrelated traits ( Herrera et al. , 2007 ) . The molecular basis for the different trajectories followed by fi tness and virulence resided in the fact that fi tness was affected by mutations anywhere in the viral genome while determinants of cell-killing capacity were multigenic but restricted to some specifi c genomic regions of the viral genome. As a consequence, the random accumulation of mutations associated with bottleneck transfers had a more negative impact on fi tness than on virulence of this FMDV clone ( Herrera et al. , 2007 ) . That viral fi tness and virulence can follow different trajectories is supported by several observations with animal and plant viruses. VSV populations that were subjected to a regime of persistent infection in sandfl y cells showed overall decrease in both fi tness and virulence in mammalian cells, but the decrease in virulence continued throughout the experiment, while the decrease in fi tness peaked at intermediate passages and was followed by some degree of recovery ( Z\u00e1rate and Novella, 2004 ) . Simian immunodefi ciency virus SIVmac239 attains similar high viral loads in the sooty mangabey and the rhesus macaque, yet it is only virulent for the rhesus macaque ( Kaur et al. , 1998 ) . At an epidemiological level, greater fi tness of historical versus current HIV-1 isolates was taken as evidence of HIV-1 attenuation over time, assuming a direct correlation between fi tness and virulence ( Arien et al. , 2005 ) . However, no trend towards HIV-1 attenuation since the time of introduction of the virus into Switzerland was observed ( Muller et al. , 2006 ) . These and other studies with viral and non-viral parasites (reviewed in Herrera et al. , 2007 ) suggest that evolution in nature can drive parasites to attain virulence levels that are not necessarily coupled to fi tness. This distinction between fi tness and virulence should be taken into consideration in the formulation of models for parasite virulence.\n\nIn contrast to bottleneck passages, large population infections generally result in fi tness gains of RNA viruses ( Martinez et al. , 1991 ; Clarke et al. , 1993 ; Novella et al. , 1995b ; Escarm\u00eds et al. , 1999 ) . Fitness increase in this case is expected from a gradual optimization of mutant spectra when their different components, arising by mutation and in some cases also by recombination, are allowed unrestricted competition in a constant environment ( Figure 4 .2 ). High replicative fi tness may help a virus to overcome selective constraints-including antiviral agents or immune responses (Qui\u00f1ones-Mateu et al. , 2006; Grimm et al. , 2007 ) -and to delay extinction by lethal mutagenesis ( Sierra et al. , 2000 ; Pariente et al. , 2001 ) . When the relative fi tness of the evolving quasispecies reaches a high value, even quite large population sizes can constitute an effective bottleneck and prevent continuing fi tness increase ( Novella et al. , 1999a ( Novella et al. , , 1999b . This limiting high fi tness level was manifested by stochastic fl uctuations in fi tness values expected from random generation of mutations in a continuously evolving mutant swarm. These perturbations illustrate how diffi cult it is to attain a true population equilibrium even when viruses replicate in a constant environment. A rare combination of mutations-one that may occur only once over many rounds of viral replication-may transfer one genome and its descendants to a distant region of sequence space, and trigger the dominance of one viral subpopulation over another, thereby disrupting a period of population equilibrium. In competitions between two VSV clones of similar fi tness coexisting at or near equilibrium, a rapid and unpredictable displacement of one VSV population by the other provided support for a classical concept of population biology: the competitive exclusion principle ( Gause, 1971 ) . Furthermore, in the competition passages preceding mutual exclusion, both the winners and the losers gained fi tness at comparable rates, in support of yet another concept of population genetics: the Red Queen hypothesis ( Van Valen, 1973 ; Clarke et al. , 1994 ; reviewed in Domingo, 2006 ) (see Figure 4 .1 ).\n\nParallel fi tness gains were also observed for minority memory genomes and their majority counterparts in evolving FMDV quasispecies . Memory genomes are subpopulations of genomes that remain in a replicating viral quasispecies at a frequency about 10 2 -to 10 3 -fold higher than the frequency that can be attributed to mutational pressure alone, and refl ect those genomes that were dominant at a previous stage of the evolution of the same viral lineage ( Ruiz-Jarabo et al. , 2000 ; review in Domingo, 2000 ) . Memory has been documented with a number of genetic markers of FMDV ( Ruiz-Jarabo et al. , 2000 , 2003b and HIV-1 ( Briones et al. , 2003 ( Briones et al. , , 2006 , and similar results have been described for VSV ( Novella et al. , 2007 ) . Memory is a consequence of fi tness variations inherent to quasispecies dynamics, likely to exert its main infl uence on the composition of mutant spectra that have been subjected to various alternating selective pressures ( Domingo, 2000 ) .\n\nRelative viral fi tness may depend on the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) used during selection or competition. High m.o.i. promotes coinfection, and the higher the level of coinfection the more likely that complementation will take place. Complementation effectively hides benefi cial (and deleterious) variation from the effects of selection ( Sevilla et al. , 1998 ; Wilke and Novella, 2003 ; Wilke et al. , 2004 ) . In addition, high m.o.i. effects may relate to the use of alternative receptors or to interfering interactions occurring within the mutant spectra of viral quasispecies ( Sevilla et al. , 1998 ; Perales et al. , 2007 ) (see section on \" Intra-population complementation and interference in viral quasispecies: mutant distributions as the units of selection \" ).\n\nDefective viruses can be maintained in the course of high m.o.i. passages by complementation. An extensively documented case is the generation and maintenance of helperdependent defective-interfering (DI) RNA and particles, which follow the process of mutation, competition and selection typical of quasispecies dynamics ( Holland et al. , 1982 ; Roux et al. , 1991 ) . Other types of defective genomes can also be maintained in viral populations by complementation Moreno et al. , 1997 ; Yamada et al. , 1998 ) . Some defective genomes can be transmitted from infected into susceptible hosts, rendering the maintenance of defective genomes by complementation an event of potential epidemiological signifi cance ( Aaskov et al. , 2006 ) .\n\nA striking, extreme case of complementation between defective genomes was provided by evolution of standard FMDV towards two defective forms that were infectious and killed cells by complementation in the absence of standard FMDV ( Garc\u00eda-Arriaza et al. , 2004, 2005, 2006 ) . These studies have provided evidence of a continuous dynamics of generation of defective FMDV genomes harboring in-frame internal deletions within genomic regions encoding trans -acting proteins, giving rise to swarms of genomes with non-identical, related deletions ( Garc\u00eda-Arriaza et al. , 2006 ) . Each virion encapsidates only one type of defective genome and, therefore, the same cell must be infected by at least two different particles to permit complementation and formation of progeny defective genomes . The high m.o.i.-dependent evolution of FMDV towards two defective forms that can complement each other has been regarded as experimental support of a fi rst step in a process towards viral genome segmentation. Interestingly, multipartite segmented genomes are rare among the animal and bacterial viruses but are frequent among plant viruses, and the latter are characterized by high m.o.i. as they spread in their host plants ( Lazarowitz, 2007 ) .\n\nThe main conclusion we derive from the results summarized in the preceding paragraphs is that even in a relatively constant biological and physical environment, as is usually provided by in vitro cell culture systems, the degree of adaptation of viral quasispecies may undergo remarkable quantitative variations, prompted by the stochastic generation of mutant genomes, and different opportunities for competitive optimization of mutant spectra.\n\nThe experiments of fi tness variation of viruses in cell culture summarized in the previous section have been instrumental in defi ning some basic infl uences that guide fi tness evolution of viral quasispecies. However, in their replication in a natural setting, viruses encounter multiple and changing environments, and they often have to cope with confl icting selective constraints. Because of polymorphisms in key host proteins involved in cellular and humoral immune responses, and in many other cell surface antigens, viruses do not face the same selective constraints in different individuals of the same host species. Biological environments are heterogeneous and vary with time within each infected individual. Furthermore, a considerable number of viruses are capable of infecting different host species, extending even further the range of environments they face.\n\nArboviruses that replicate in mammalian and insect hosts constitute a classical example of obligate environmental alternacy in vivo ( Scott et al. , 1994 ; Weaver, 1998 ) (Chapter 16) . Early work documented that extensive replication of viruses in insect cells led to attenuation of infectivity for mammalian cells ( Peleg, 1971 ; Mudd et al. , 1973 ) . Prolonged persistence of VSV in sandfl y cells cultured at low temperatures resulted in several orders of magnitude greater fi tness in insect cells than in mammalian cells ( Novella et al. , 1995a ; Z\u00e1rate and Novella, 2004 ) . In contrast, acute VSV replication in sandfl y cells led to fi tness increase in mammalian cells ( Novella et al. , 1999a ) , and replication of West Nile virus in mosquito cells resulted in populations that, while not improved, showed no fi tness losses in vertebrate cells ( Ciota et al. , 2007 ) . Thus, we cannot assume selective differences between insect and mammalian cells types, and when we observe tradeoffs, these may be due to different strategies of replication (persistent versus acute), not to difference in cell type per se .\n\nA single passage of sandfl y cell-adapted VSV in mammalian cells led to an increase in fi tness in mammalian cells to near original values. It would be interesting to test whether this capacity for fi tness shift would be similar for non-arboviral RNA viruses able to grow in insect cells in culture. VSV adapted to sandfl y cells was highly attenuated for mice. Again, a single passage in mammalian cells restored the virulence phenotype in vivo ( Novella et al. , 1995a ) .\n\nSeveral groups have studied the evolutionary consequences of alternating environments during arbovirus replication (reviewed in Wilke et al. , 2006 ; Ciota et al. , 2007 ) . The overall results showed that extensive alternating replication between mammalian and insect cells led to fi tness improvement in both environments; the only exception was VSV adapted to alternation between persistent insect replication and acute mammalian replication: adaptation during alternation is dominated by the persistent environment and there is fi tness loss in the mammalian environment ( Z\u00e1rate and Novella, 2004 ) (for details, see Chapter 16).\n\nStudies of fi tness variations in vivo have been approached in at least three ways. Some studies have involved growth-competition experiments between two viruses replicating in host organisms. In other studies, the outcome of competitions between viruses that were isolated in vivo has been analyzed in primary or established cell cultures. In yet another line of research, the effect of fi tness variations in cell culture on the replicative potential of viruses in vivo has been examined. Carrillo et al. (1998) isolated two variant FMDVs present at low frequency in the course of replication of a clonal virus preparation in swine. One of the variants was a MAbresistant mutant (MARM), while the other was isolated from blood during the early viremic phase of the acute infection. The ability of the two variants to compete in vivo with the parental clonal population was examined by coinfection of swine with mixtures of the parental clone and each of the two variants individually. None of the two variants became completely dominant in a single coinfection in vivo , but fi tness differences were clearly documented. The parental FMDV clone manifested a selective advantage over the MARM in that the parental clone was dominant in most lesions (vesicles) in the diseased swine. In contrast, the parental clone and the variant from the early viremic phase were about equally represented in the lesions of the animals infected with equal amounts of the two viruses ( Carrillo et al. , 1998 ) .\n\nThe lentivirus equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) experiences continuous quasispecies fl uctuations during persistent infections in horses ( Clements et al. , 1988 ) . EIAV quasispecies were characterized in a pony experimentally infected with a biological clone of the virus. New quasispecies were associated with recurrent episodes of disease. A large deletion in the principal neutralizing domain of the virus was identifi ed during the third febrile episode and became dominant during the fourth febrile episode. This drastic genetic change did not appear to diminish signifi cantly the fi tness of EIAV in vivo and in cell culture ( Leroux et al. , 1997 ) . The complexity of sequential EIAV populations in vivo , was characterized with a nonhierarchical clustering method to analyze quasispecies, termed PAQ (partition analysis of quasispecies) ( Baccam et al. , 2001 ) . This procedure to dissect the composition of mutant spectra should allow the recognition of subpopulations within viral quasispecies as they evolve towards fi tness gain or loss.\n\nThe multiple environments in which viruses have to replicate in vivo may promote the selective expansion of subpopulations from viral quasispecies thereby leading to variant viruses that display altered relative fi tness in different host organs, as compared with their parental populations. Such variations in the potential replicative capacity constitute one of the ingredients that may affect the emergence and reemergence of viral disease (reviews in Smolinski et al. , 2003 ; Peters, 2007 ) . The genetic lottery of blind variation through mutation, recombination, and genome segment reassortment is played in the face of a background of multiple ecological, sociological, and demographic factors. In recent decades viral disease emergences that have affected humans have occurred at a rate of about one per year. Salient examples are acquired immune defi ciency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), encephalitis associated with West Nile virus, the expansion of dengue fever, or periodic infl uenza pandemics ( Smolinski et al. , 2003 ; Peters, 2007 ) .\n\nMultiple genetic changes may favor the adaptation of a virus to a new host. Once adaptation has taken place, the adapted virus may lose or maintain the pathogenic potential for the former (donor) host (as an example of maintenance of virulence for a donor and recipient host in FMDV see Nu\u00f1ez et al. , 2007 ) . A core (or basal) genetic composition of a viral pathogen may be in itself a predictor of pathogenic potential, as profusely documented with natural or laboratory-generated, attenuated variants of many viral pathogens. To take infl uenza A virus and the threat of a human infl uenza pandemics as examples, out of the 16 hemagglutinin (H) and 9 neuraminidase (N) subtypes circulating among animal reservoirs, some potentially threatening forms being more carefully kept under surveillance include H 5 N 1 , H 7 N 7 , H 9 N 2 , and H 2 N 2 viruses. The expansion of the H 5 N 1 subtype among wild and domestic avian species and human contacts since 2005 has resulted in over 300 human cases in nearly 50 countries, with more than 50% deaths, as well as the killing of millions of poultry ( Wright et al. , 2007 ) . Key parameters for an avian infl uenza virus to give rise to a human infl uenza pandemic include acquisition of receptorrecognition specifi city for human cells, and the capacity for effi cient human-to-human transmission ( Parrish and Kawaoka, 2005 ; Suzuki, 2005 ) . This capacity can be expressed as the basic reproductive ratio (Ro) which is the average number of infected contacts from each infected host (review in Nowak and May, 2000 ) . \" Epidemiologic fi tness \" has been used to describe (through samplings of defi nitory genomic sequences, diagnostic surveys, etc.) the capacity of a virus to become dominant (relative to related viruses or variants) during epidemic outbreaks ( Domingo, 2007 ) . In the case of human infl uenza virus, the acquisition of high epidemiological fi tness depends on multiple gene products. Critical substitutions in H may modify the receptorbinding specifi city of infl uenza viruses, and such substitutions have been found in minority subpopulations of infl uenza virus in several surveys. In one study, two substitutions in H identifi ed in a human infl uenza virus from a fatal human case, were shown to modify the receptor-binding preference of H of a H 5 N 1 virus from sialic acid-2,3 galactose (associated with replication in avian hosts) to both sialic acid-2,3 galactose and sialic acid-2,6 galactose, both associated with binding to human-type receptors, each expressed preferentially in different sites of the human respiratory tract ( Auewarakul et al. , 2007 ) . Thus, in infl uenza virus, and probably many other pathogenic viruses, both epidemiologic fi tness and replicative fi tness are multigenic traits ( Grimm et al. , 2007 ) .\n\nSeveral studies have compared the amino acid sequence of multiple infl uenza virus proteins to search for markers (amino acid substitutions) of human isolates and human pandemic strains (from 1918, 1957, 1968 and recent human H 5 N 1 isolates). In one such proteomics survey, several amino acid changes located in PB2, PA, NP, M1, and NS1 distinguished avian infl uenza viruses from their human counterparts ( Finkelstein et al. , 2007 ) . Some markers were conserved in the infl uenza viruses that caused the 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemics. Other studies have identifi ed HA and PB2 as critical for adaptation of avian virus to humans, that may occur by a step-wise process refl ected in acquisition of diagnostic amino acid markers. Evidence of human-to-human transmission of avian infl uenza virus H 5 N 1 has been obtained in some family case clusters but not in others ( Yang et al. , 2007 ) . Infl uenza constitutes the paradigm of a viral disease which, favored by a continuum of genetic variation, reemerges periodically to cause pandemics, and for which extensive epidemiological surveillance is currently in operation.\n\nAn increasing number of measurements of viral fi tness involve human immunodefi ciency virus 1 (HIV-1) variants isolated from quasispecies replicating in vivo . Particularly relevant are fi tness comparisons among multiple mutants harboring amino acid substitutions related to resistance to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors (see also Chapter 14).\n\nSince the discovery of AZT (3 \u0408 -azido-3 \u0408deoxythymidine, zidovudine) as an effective inhibitor of HIV replication ( Mitsuya et al. , 1985 ) , drug therapy has been widely used in the treatment of AIDS. The loss of therapeutic effect due to the acquisition of resistance was recognized for AZT in 1989, when Larder and colleagues showed that HIV isolates from patients with advanced HIV disease became less sensitive to the drug during the course of treatment ( Larder et al. , 1989 ) . High-level resistance to AZT is achieved through the accumulation of several mutations including M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, and K219Q/E (for a review, see Larder, 1994 ) . The fi rst substitution arising during AZT treatment is usually K70R, followed by T215Y. The K70R mutation appears frequently, since it requires only one nucleotide change, and does not have a major impact on viral fi tness ( Harrigan et al. , 1998 ) . The simultaneous presence of Leu41 and Tyr215 in the viral RT-coding region confers high-level resistance to AZT, without having a major effect on viral fi tness. In contrast, other combinations of AZT resistance mutations (e.g. M41L/K70R) confer reduced replication capacity ( Jeeninga et al. , 2001 ) . Interestingly, transmitted HIV-1 carrying D67N or K219Q evolve rapidly to AZT resistance in vitro (selecting for K70R) and show a high replicative fi tness in the presence of zidovudine ( Garc\u00eda-Lerma et al. , 2004 ) . On the other hand, L210W improved infectivity and relative fi tness of an M41L/T215Y mutant in the presence of AZT, but decreased infectivity and relative fi tness when introduced into a D67N/K70R/K219Q background . Drug-resistant mutations occur in the mutant spectra of HIV-1 quasispecies from untreated patients ( N\u00e1jera et al. , 1995 ) . The replacement of Tyr215 by Cys, Asp, or Ser has been observed in vivo in the absence of zidovudine treatment ( Goudsmit et al. , 1997 ; Yerly et al. , 1998 ) . In the absence of inhibitor, T215S and T215D confer a small but signifi cant advantage over the wild-type virus, as determined in vitro in growth competition experiments. However, the replicative advantage conferred by T215S was lost in the presence of zidovudine-resistance mutations such as M41L and L210W ( Garc\u00eda-Lerma et al. , 2001 ) .\n\nOther nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 RT are listed in Table 4 .1 . High-level resistance to the nucleoside analogue 3TC (2 \u0408 , 3 \u0408 -dideoxy-3 \u0408thiacytidine, lamivudine) is rapidly achieved by the substitution M184 V, located at the YMDD motif, which is part of the catalytic core of the enzyme. During 3TC treatment, the substitution M184I appears fi rst, but then\n\nAmino acid substitutions associated with drug resistance a Clotet et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2007) . b Primary resistance mutations are shown in bold. Most PR inhibitors (saquinavir, indinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir, atazanavir, tipranavir, and darunavir) are usually prescribed in combination with a low dose of ritonavir, that has a boosting effect on the PR inhibitor concentration in plasma.\n\nit is lost due to the outgrowth of the M184Vcontaining viruses ( Keulen et al. , 1997 ) .\n\nGrowth competition experiments showed a selective advantage of viruses with Val184 over those with Ile184. The low effi ciency of 3TC-resistant HIV-1, carrying RT mutations M184V or M184I, has been attributed to the low processivity of the mutant RT ( Back et al. , 1996 ) , which was accentuated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ( Keulen et al. , 1997 ) .\n\nOther nucleoside analogue resistance mutations (e.g. K65R, K70E, or L74V) also have a signifi cant impact on viral fi tness, which correlates with a defect in RT processivity ( Sharma and Crumpacker, 1997 ; Miller et al. , 1998 ; Sharma and Crumpacker, 1999 ; White et al. , 2002 ) . The presence of K65R together with L74V or M184V has a strong deleterious effect on viral replication, due to the poor ability of K65R/L74V to use natural nucleotides relative to the wild type ( Deval et al. , 2004 ) , or to the negative impact of the simultaneous presence of K65R and M184V on the RT ' s processivity, as well as in the initiation of reverse transcription ( White et al. , 2002 ; Frankel et al. , 2007 ) . These observations are consistent with the low prevalence of the K65R mutation among isolates from antiretroviraldrug experienced patients, and give rational support to the benefi t in combining mutations that impair virus replication.\n\nDrug combinations are very effective in blocking HIV replication, leading to a more than 10 000-fold reduction of viral load. Early studies showed that multiple drug resistance to AZT and other inhibitors can be achieved through the accumulation of mutations appearing in monotherapy ( Schmit et al. , 1996 ; Shafer et al. , 1998 ) . However, the response of a viral quasispecies to multiple constraints (e.g. different antiviral drugs) is often diffi cult to predict. Simultaneous treatment with AZT and ddI led to viruses with reduced sensitivity to AZT, ddC, ddI, ddG, and d4T ( Shirasaka et al. , 1995 ; Iversen et al. , 1996 ) . The resistant viruses contained substitutions A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151 M. Substitution Q151 M, which results from two nucleotide changes, is the fi rst to appear and confers partial resistance to AZT, ddI, ddC, and d4T. Fitness assays involving the determination of replication kinetics or growth competition experiments showed that mutations at codons 62, 75, 77, and 116 improved the replication capacity of the resistant virus ( Maeda et al. , 1998 ; Kosalaraksa et al. , 1999 ) .\n\nWith the increasing complexity of the antiretroviral regimens, novel mutational patterns conferring resistance to multiple antiretroviral drugs have been identifi ed. Thus, HIV-1 variants with insertions or deletions in the \" fi ngers \" subdomain of the RT have been found in patients failing therapy with multiple RT inhibitors  for a recent review, see Men\u00e9ndez-Arias et al. , 2006 ) . The presence of the amino acid changes T69S and T215Y in the RT, together with a dipeptide insertion between positions 69 and 70 (usually Ser-Ser), and the subsequent accumulation of additional mutations (e.g. M41L, A62V, T69S, and K70R) leads to the emergence of virus displaying high-level resistance to thymidine analogues ( Matamoros et al. , 2004 ; Cases-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. , 2007 ) . Dual infection/competition experiments revealed that in the presence of low concentrations of AZT, removal of the two serine residues forming the dipeptide insertion in a multidrugresistant isolate does not cause a detrimental effect on the replication capacity of the virus ( Qui\u00f1ones-Mateu et al. , 2002 ) . However, in the absence of drug, the insertions improved the fi tness of virus-carrying thymidine analogue mutations (e.g. M41L, L210W, T215Y, etc.). Although, multidrug-resistant mutants are able to maintain high viral loads in the presence of antiretroviral therapy, it should be noted that in vivo wild-type HIV variants outcompete those bearing the insertion, as demonstrated when therapy is interrupted Lukashov et al. , 2001 ) .\n\nNon-nucleoside RT inhibitors bind to a hydrophobic cavity which is 8-10 \u00c5 away from the polymerase active site, and lined by the side-chains of Tyr181, Tyr188, Phe227, and Trp229 ( Kohlstaedt et al. , 1992 ) . High-level resistance appears quickly after treatment and involves amino acid changes in residues located at the inhibitor binding site (Table  4 .1). Again, resistance mutations often lead to reduced in vitro replication capacity. Examples are the nevirapine-resistance mutation V106A and the delavirdine-resistance mutation P236L that impair RNase H activity ( Gerondelis et al. , 1999 ; Archer et al. , 2000 ; Dykes et al. , 2001 ; Iglesias-Ussel et al. , 2002 ; Collins et al. , 2004 ) , as well as several mutations at codons 138 and 190, whose effects appear to be related to impaired DNA synthesis and RNase H degradation ( Pelemans et al. , 2001 ; Collins et al. , 2004 ; Wang et al. , 2006 ) .\n\nThe HIV-1 PR is a homodimeric enzyme composed of two polypeptide chains of 99 residues. The substrate binding site is located at the interface between both subunits. The side-chains of Arg8, Leu23, Asp25, Gly27, Ala28, Asp29, Asp30, Val32, Ile47, Gly48, Gly49, Ile50, Phe53, Leu76, Thr80, Pro81, Val82, and Ile84 form the substrate-binding pocket and can interact with specifi c inhibitors ( Wlodawer and Vondrasek, 1998 ) , such as those used in the clinical treatment of AIDS. Approved PR inhibitors share relatively similar chemical structures and cross-resistance is commonly observed in the clinical setting ( Menendez- Arias, 2002 ) . It is not unexpected that many resistance mutations affect residues of the inhibitor-binding pocket of the PR ( Table 4 .1 ). Studies carried out in vivo and in vitro have shown that several amino acid substitutions involved in drug resistance may have a deleterious effect on viral fi tness. Examples are D30N, I47A, I50V, G48V, and V82A ( Eastman et al. , 1998 ; Martinez-Picado et al. , 1999 ; Kantor et al. , 2002 ; Prado et al. , 2002 ; Yusa et al. , 2002 ; Colonno et al. , 2004 ) .\n\nThe deleterious effects caused by drug resistance mutations can be rescued by other amino acid replacements. For example, multidrug-resistant virus arising during prolonged therapy with indinavir contained PR with the substitutions M46I, L63P, V82T, and I84V ( Condra et al. , 1995 ; Martinez-Picado et al. , 1999 ) . Crystallographic studies of the mutant enzyme revealed that substitutions at codons 82 and 84 were critical for the acquisition of resistance, while the amino acid changes at codons 46 and 63, which are away from the inhibitor-binding site appear as compensatory mutations ( Chen et al. , 1995 ; Schock et al. , 1996 ) . Although compensatory mutations within the PR-coding region increase the catalytic effi ciency of the enzyme, there are other molecular mechanisms that lead to fi tness recovery during PR inhibitor treatments. Examples are: (i) mutations at Gag cleavage sites that increase polyprotein processing ( Doyon et al. , 1996 ; Zhang et al. , 1997 ; Pettit et al. , 2002 ) , (ii) mutations that affect the frameshift signal between the gag and pol genes that lead to an increased expression of pol products ( Doyon et al. , 1998 ) , or (iii) mutations outside of the cleavage sites that could affect the conformation of the Gag polyprotein and make the cleavage sites more accessible to the viral PR ( Gatanaga et al. , 2002 ; Myint et al. , 2004 ) .\n\nFor many years, the RT and the PR were the only targets of approved antiretroviral drugs. In 2003, enfuvirtide, a synthetic peptide that impairs virus-host cell membrane fusion, was licensed for clinical use. Resistance to enfuvirtide is mediated by amino acid substitutions at codons 36-38 of the envelope glycoprotein gp41. The amino acid sequences found at those positions in drug-sensitive viruses (DIV, SIV, GIV, or GIM) are replaced by SIM, DIM, or DTV in the drug-resistant clones ( Rimsky et al. , 1998 ) . As observed with PR and RT inhibitors, resistance mutations cause a fi tness loss, which was estimated to be approximately 10% in replication kinetics and growth competition experiments ( Lu et al. , 2004 ; Reeves et al. , 2005 ) . However, it should be noted that mutations in the V3 loop of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 can also affect the viral susceptibility to enfuvirtide ( Reeves et al. , 2002 ) , and further studies will be necessary to evaluate its impact on viral fi tness in vivo.\n\nIn August 2007, a CCR5 coreceptor antagonist known as maraviroc was approved for clinical use. Maraviroc has potent antiviral activity against CCR5-tropic HIV-1 variants, including primary isolates from various clades ( Dorr et al. , 2005 ) . Maraviroc-resistant HIV variants contained unique amino acid changes in the V3 loop (e.g. A316T and I323V) and other positions within the envelope glycoprotein, gp120, but continued to be phenotypically CCR5-tropic and sensitive to CCR5 antagonists in preclinical development, such as vicriviroc ( Westby et al. , 2007 ) .\n\nOther antiretroviral drugs showing promising results in clinical trials are the integrase inhibitors raltegravir (licensed in October 2007) and elvitegravir. However, the information available on specifi c drug resistance mutations and their effects on the viral replication capacity is still preliminary.\n\nThis review of fi tness effects of drugresistance mutations in HIV-1 provides a dramatic illustration of the adaptive potential of a viral quasispecies. Acquisition of critical amino acid replacements for drug resistance, fi tness effects that favor selection of compensatory mutations either in a viral enzyme or in its target substrate, occurrence of clusters of mutations for multidrug resistance are but some of the mechanisms displayed by HIV-1 to persist in the human population.\n\nThe virological signifi cance of quasispecies theory becomes more apparent each year. Initial reports of extremely high error rates and great population diversity of RNA viruses were hotly disputed as being incorrect and inconsistent with often-observed stability in virus markers such as antigenicity, disease characteristics, host range, etc. High error rates and intra-population heterogeneity for RNA viruses are now widely accepted. Fortunately, early quasispecies theory presented a timely, remarkably prescient theoretical framework within which the behavior of replicating and evolving RNA virus populations could begin to be understood. Following elaboration by Eigen, Biebricher, Schuster, and colleagues, quasispecies-derived theory has been rapidly progressing and evolving. Its ground-breaking initial theoretical structure for exploring consequences of extreme biological error rates was informed by elegant molecular replication/ mutation kinetic studies with small RNA replicons in vitro. Original quasispecies theory was formally applicable to these in vitro experiments, and was necessarily generalized, idealized, and, in many specifi cs, openly unrealistic for real viruses. Some simplifying assumptions not applicable to viruses in the real world include: infi nite virus populations; global optima in the selective landscape; one most-fi t master sequence in a single, unvarying selective landscape; fi tness restricted to competition solely between one master sequence and diverse variants of equally low fi tness; and, fi nally, omission of complexities such as replicative interference, lethal mutations, complementation, recombination, etc.\n\nEarly modeling could not reasonably encompass all real-life complexities. To attempt inclusion of all would render any model (or alternative collection of models) hopelessly unwieldy, uninformative, and poorly predictive due to requisite alternate weightings of factors. Simplifi ed assumptions not conforming to complex realities need not detract from the ability of models to serve as starting points and guideposts toward new directions for experiment and theory. Quasispecies theory has indisputably led virology to powerful new insights, deductions, and directions. A few critics have suggested that the non-real world parameters in early quasispecies models, and the nonrealistic (and foregone) conclusions that can be contrived from them, are reason to reject the general validity and broad signifi cance of quasispecies. Such circular arguments are specious and trivial relative to the experimental and conceptual advances already-made, and yet-to-be-made, via quasispecies theory with its straightforward conclusions and more subtle implications.\n\nIncreasingly sensitive analyses of viral quasispecies in recent decades have produced many remarkable insights. The most basic, far-reaching, awesomely predictive tenet of quasispecies theory will never be overshadowed; numerous variant genomes are bound together through extreme mutation rates, forming obligatorily co-selected partnerships in a vast, error-prone mutant spectrum from which they cannot escape, and from which they inevitably and coordinately may exert myriad, changing, ultimately unforseeable effects on all life forms. This tenet has been unquestionably and elegantly confi rmed recently by the U. C. San Francisco, Stanford and Penn State groups (as reviewed above and elsewhere in this volume).\n\nA signifi cant postulate of early quasispecies models was that of \" error catastrophe. \" This posits that replicase-generated quasispecies mutation rates are, through evolutionary selection, poised at, or near, an error threshold. Prolonged violation of this threshold (through replicase dysfunction, mutagens, elevated temperatures, nucleotide pool alterations, etc.) leads to virus extinction via a fast and irreversible transition, that has sometimes been equated with a phase transition in physics, as discussed in the opening chapter of this volume. Because the simplifi ed model employed nonrealistic parameters and envisioned indefi nite mutational drift, critics deny the existence of error thresholds and sharp transitions to error catastrophe. No real-world virus could conform to the simplifying assumptions employed in that model, but recent data from lethal mutagenesis experiments do demonstrate devolution to error catastrophe. Historical precedent for the term \" error catastrophe \" lies with Orgel ' s suggestion in 1963 of cascading coordinate collapse of cellular information within (and between) various interdependent cellular nucleic acid and protein trans -networks. We also employ the term in a broad manner for lethal mutagenesis. This is especially appropriate with mutagens such as 5-FU (which modify both viral and cellular nucleic acids and their encoded functions and structures). We cannot presently rule out some roles for mutagenized cellular, as well as viral, macromolecules, during lethal mutagenesis. Regardless, complex interactions of altered viral macromolecular networks are defi nitely involved. Extinction is mediated by \" trans -acting networks \" among abundant lethal defector genomes. The senior author ' s group in Madrid demonstrated (reviewed above) that strongly mutagenized RNA virus populations do collapse to extinction via a sharp transition, but without the non-lethal, continuous mutational drift exemplifi ed in the original quasispecies simulations. Extremely rapid extinctions are observed for low-fi tness input virus strains, which transition into error catastrophe during a single round of infection/mutagenesis. Lethal mutagenesis of FMDV and LCMV is mediated by full-length, replicating, interfering, lethal defector genomes. Total (defective and viable) genomic RNA mutation frequencies are elevated to varying extents, whereas specifi c infectivity of total genomic RNA is decreased by several orders of magnitude without any change of RNA consensus sequence. In light of quasispecies \" variant-ensemble \" behavior, it is not surprising that defective genomes can predominate within trans -acting networks during lethal mutagenesis, and continue to replicate even after extinction of LCMV infectivity. Defector trans -effects can provide positive complementation in concert with, or alternation with, (orthogonal) interference. Standard concepts of virus fi tness are only tangentially applicable within such collapsing trans -networks. Catastrophic decay of viral digital information proceeds on (at least) two levels: (1) genetic quenching due to egregious fi xation of genomic mutations in a trans -network environment that does not always select for optimal function of self-encoded proteins, and (2) phenotypic transquenching of potentially viable genomes via altered, defector-encoded (interfering) proteins. Possible roles of RNA recombination remain to be explored.\n\nDefector-driven transitions will be challenging to dissect, and no theoretical model can possibly capture even their main intricacies. During lethal mutagenesis at high multiplicities of infection, each infected cell is a single compartment in which a separate, discrete error catastrophe event may devolve. Each discrete trans -network is disrupted and obscured during virus passages or RNA transfections following initial infection/ mutagenesis. Multiplicity of infection (for both viable and defector virions) is clearly a crucial variable during passages. Virus strains with low replicative fi tness (and mutagendebilitated genomes) theoretically should be (and are) more vulnerable than highly fi t strains to defector-mediated error catastrophe. Low-fi tness strains cannot quickly produce high yields during temporary escape from defector networks. Future investigations with controlled compartmentalization (e.g. characterization of isolated infectious centers, microinjection of single cells, etc.), together with molecular genetic construction/reconstruction of defi ned trans -networks will illuminate preextinction events.\n\nThe Madrid group has already verifi ed that ordinary, viable FMDV variant RNAs, and mixtures of variant RNAs bearing defi ned mutations in the capsid and polymerase genes can exert trans -complementation and interference effects on standard FMDV RNA following co-electroporation of cells. Clearly, at high multiplicities of co-electroporation, such mixtures of defi ned variant and control RNAs generate unique, mutually supportive or suppressive (complementing/interfering) trans -acting networks within each individual, coinfected cell. This provides strong analogies to events during the transitions of lethal mutagenesis. The compelling differences, of course, are that the latter devolve to extinction due to: (1) mutagenelevated mutation, AND elevated mutationfi xation rates in a poorly-selective trans -milieu;\n\n(2) potent trans -quenching of surviving-andcollapsing infectious virus via interfering (lethal defector-encoded) proteins.\n\nThus, the quasispecies postulate of a rapid transition to extinction has been experimentally verifi ed, albeit the complex defector mechanisms for real viruses differ signifi cantly from those originally modeled, as indeed recognized and anticipated by Eigen (see above). It is evident that the details of lethal mutagenesis will likely differ among families of RNA viruses (e.g. those having mono-, bi-, or multipartitite genomes, strong or weak complementation, homologous or only non-homologous recombination, naked or enveloped capsids, etc.). However, it seems probable that error catastrophe will be observed in all. Although no theoretical model can possibly capture all the ingredients involved in the replicative collapse of a mutagenized viral population, it was the original error threshold which inspired the experiments currently being performed in several laboratories.\n\nThe tenets of Eigen, Biebricher, Schuster, and colleagues, derived from fi rst principles and tractable models, have had enormous infl uence in virology. This pervasive infl uence is in no manner weakened nor negated by original simplifying assumptions. "}
