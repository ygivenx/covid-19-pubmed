As shown in Figs. 1G and 1H, cells expressing MHC class I and II antigen were easily detected in infected spinal cords. However, the morphology of these cells did not appear to be that of astrocytes but, rather, suggested that the labeled cells were either macrophages or microglia (compare with Fig. 1D ). In addition, MHC class I antigen could be detected on endothelial and meningeal cells (data not shown). These results suggest that if astrocytes with the morphology shown in Fig. 1C express either MHC class I or II antigen, then the level of expression is significantly lower than that present on other cells in the CNS of mice with demyelination.\n\nIncreased expression of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 mRNA has also been reported in mice with MHV-JHM-induced acute encephalitis (Pearce et al., 1994) . Since mice with encephalitis die before virus spreads to the spinal cord, the midbrain and the brainstem of mice with the acute disease were assayed for GFAP and the three cytokines described above. GFAP (Fig. 5A ), TNF-a (Fig. 5B) , and IL-6 ( Fig. 5C ), but not IL-1b (data not shown), were readily detected on these sections, with most of the cells positive for these molecules arranged in a perivascular distribution, as shown in Figs. 5B and 5C for TNF-a and IL-6, respectively. At present it is not known why IL-1b could not be detected since IL-1b mRNA expression has been shown to be upregulated in the brains of mice with acute encephalitis (Pearce et al., 1994) .

To determine if cells with this pattern were cephalitis or chronic demyelination were analyzed for the labeled in the spinal cords of infected mice, longitudinal expression of three pleiotropic cytokines, TNF-a, IL-1b, sections were cut and analyzed for MHV-JHM by in situ and IL-6, and the inducible isoform of NOS.

This labeling for cytokines or iNOS could represent IL-6, and iNOS were primarily detected in cells with the either de novo synthesis by astrocytes or production morphology of mononuclear cells. These cells were obelsewhere and subsequent uptake of these molecules served to radiate from large blood vessels, consistent by astrocytes. We favor the former interpretation for two with production by infiltrating, blood-derived cells ( Fig.  reasons . First, astrocytes are the predominant cell la-5). Mononuclear cell perivascular infiltration is one of the beled for all three cytokines and iNOS. If these molecules early pathological changes described in mice infected were synthesized by other cells, these cells should also with MHV-JHM (Weiner, 1973) , and our results suggest be labeled in the sections. Second, iNOS is not secreted, that these cells produce cytokines and iNOS as part making it unlikely that the enzyme was produced by other of the initial response to the virus. These results are cells and taken up by astrocytes. In addition, expression consistent with a recent study in which macrophages of all three cytokines and iNOS has been well docuand microglia were shown to produce TNF-a in mice mented in experiments in which cultured astrocytes were with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (Renno et activated in vitro (Simmons and Murphy, 1992; Eddleston al., 1995) as well as other reports showing that infiltrating mononuclear cells but not resident CNS cells produced and Mucke, 1993) . Our data represent one of the few examples in which apparent synthesis of all of these iNOS in animals with virus-induced acute encephalitis (Zheng et al., 1993; Campbell et al., 1994) . Of note, in our cytokines and iNOS by astrocytes is documented in situ and are consistent with the notion that this synthesis study, large numbers of macrophages/microglia were present in the CNS of mice with hindlimb paralysis, but cytokines by many cell types and by increasing vascular permeability and expression of adhesion molecules (Tra-most of these cells did not express the three cytokines or iNOS at levels comparable to what was observed in cey and Cerami, 1993). IL-6, among other functions, is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of cyto-acutely infected mice. Macrophages have been shown to strip myelin sheaths off axons in MHV-JHM-infected toxic T cells (Akira et al., 1993) . IL-1 and TNF-a induce the synthesis of iNOS (Murphy et al., 1993) . While the mice with extensive demyelination (Powell and Lampert, 1975) . Therefore, it is possible that macrophages have role of each cytokine in the pathogenic process and the extent to which they affect the level and function of each different roles in the acute and chronic infections.\n\nThe pathogenesis of demyelination induced by MHV-other is not well understood, maintenance of a chronic inflammatory response likely requires the continued syn-JHM has similarities with the pathogenic process observed in the brains of patients with MS. In both cases, thesis of one or more of these cytokines. It is striking that the source for these cytokines and iNOS shifted inflammatory infiltrates and astrogliosis are associated with active lesions (Lee et al., 1990; Raine, 1994) . TNF-from macrophages/microglia to a preponderance of astrocytes as the MHV infection changed from an acute a and iNOS are expressed by astrocytes associated with the lesions in both cases (Hofman et al., 1989; Selmaj et to a chronic phase. Cytokine production by astrocytes may be a general feature of chronic viral infections since al., 1991; Bo et al., 1994a) . TNF-a and IL-1, but not IL-6, can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients such production by astrocytes has also been documented at autopsy in patients with subacute sclerosing with MS and MHC class II expression is upregulated in the CNS of both diseased humans and mice (Hauser et panencephalitis (Nagano et al., 1994) . The basis for the predominant synthesis of cytokines by astrocytes and al., 1990). In MS, MHC class II is only rarely, if ever, seen on reactive astrocytes (Bo et al., 1994b) and in our study, not macrophages in chronically infected mice remains to be determined. However, expression of TNF-a and no expression of either MHC class I or II antigen could be detected on cells with the typical morphology of nitric oxide by astrocytes located adjacent to demyelinating lesions might contribute to the process of demyelin-astrocytes (compare Figs. 1C, 1G, and 1H).
