{"title": "Altered polarization of PAR-2 signaling during airway epithelial remodeling", "body": "Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that can drive inflammation in asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and allergic rhinitis. 1, 2 PARs are activated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular N-terminus, exposing an intramolecular tethered ligand. 1, 2 PAR-2 may be activated by mast cell tryptase, 3 neutrophil elastase, 4 Alternaria fungal proteases, 5 and house dust mite proteases 6 and may promote Th2 inflammation in bronchial epithelial cells. 7 We previously found that PAR-2 is expressed on the basolateral membrane of healthy well-polarized differentiated primary sinonasal epithelial ciliated cells, where it elevates intracellular calcium to increase ciliary beating and apical membrane Clsecreation, 8 suggesting PAR-2 promotes epithelial mucociliary clearance in response to protease activity.\n\nWe hypothesized basolateral polarization of PAR-2 may limit its activation except during times of epithelial barrier breakdown during infection or inflammation. Alteration of epithelial polarization or cell type composition occurs in obstructive airway diseases such as asthma and COPD. 9, 10 Loss of airway cilia may occur with viral or bacterial infection, [11] [12] [13] [14] type-2 inflammationdriven remodeling, 15 or smoking. 16, 17 Squamous metaplasia occurs after bacterial infection, particularly in cystic fibrosis-related CRS, 18 and is frequently reported in CRS patient tissue samples. 19, 20 Much of the literature on airway remodeling focuses on barrier dysfunction, but airway cells in vitro can maintain tight junctions and barrier function despite substantial morphological changes, including loss of cilia. 12 Less is known about how signaling is altered before large scale barrier breakdown in severe disease. We hypothesized that loss of epithelial polarization may affect PAR-2 signaling independently of barrier disruption, perhaps sensitizing cells to protease allergens.\n\nWe first tested activation of PAR-2 by Aspergillus fumigatus, the most prevalent fungal cause of pulmonary allergic disease, including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis associated with chronic lung injury in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or chronic asthma. 21 We next examined PAR-2 signaling in airway squamous cells using pharmacology and live cell imaging. We then tested PAR-2 signaling in well-differentiated air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of primary nasal cells exposed to disease-related modifiers, including IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate (CSC), and retinoic acid deficiency, all of which alter epithelial morphology. We also examined isolated tissue from inflamed nasal polyp and compared it with control middle turbinate. The data below reveal important alterations of the polarity of PAR-2 signaling in squamous cells and primary epithelial cells de-differentiated through disease-relevant mechanisms.\n\nWhile Alternaria proteases are well documented to activate PAR-2, 32, 33 \n\nAspergillus fumigatus also activates PAR-2 in the airway 7 and cornea. 34 A. fumigatus is a common cause of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, 21 and can cause fatal invasive aspergillosis. 35 To confirm if A. fumigatus produces PAR-2-activating proteases, we utilized a fluorogenic assay (Trio assay) to directly visualize PAR-2 activation by its interaction with b-arrestin, 36 which associates with activated and phosphorylated GPCRs and mediates further signal transduction and/or internalization to endosomes 37 (Fig 1A) . This assay is based on a tripartite GFP, with the 11 th b strand fused to the C-terminus of PAR-2, the 10 th b-strand fused to barrestin, and b strands 1-9 expressed as a soluble protein. 36 When PAR-2 is activated, association with b-arrestin allows a complete GFP to form and increases fluorescence (Fig 1B) . This approach eliminates other effects that may impinge on downstream signaling (e.g., toll-like receptor activation during exposure to fungal conditioned media).\n\nWe visualized PAR-2 activation via appearance of GFP fluorescence A549 alveolar cells (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig S1) and Beas-2B bronchial cells (Supplementary Fig S2) .\n\nStimulation with peptide PAR-2 agonist 2FLI resulted in appearance of punctate GFP fluorescence over the course of 2 hours (Fig 1C-D and Supplementary Fig S2A-B) . In cells imaged at 90 min, 2FLI increased GFP fluorescence ~30-fold while PAR-4 agonist AY-NH2 had no effect ( Supplementary Fig S1A and S2C ). Exposure to conditioned media (CM) from A. fumigatus, but not A. niger, increased GFP fluorescence (Fig 1E and Supplementary Figs S1B and S2G-K), signaling PAR-2 activation. Heat inactivation of the CM (100 \u00b0C for 20 min) eliminated PAR-2 activation (Fig 1E and Supplementary Figs S1B, S2H and S2K ). No activation of the b-2 adrenergic receptor was observed (Supplementary Fig S1C) . These results support that A. fumigatus activates of PAR-2, likely via a secreted heat labile protease.\n\nControversy exists over whether certain host and pathogen proteases activate PAR-2 by cleavage at the activating site or inhibit PAR-2 by cleavage downstream, removing the tethered ligand and \"disarming\" it. 38 Neutrophil and Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase have both been suggested to either activate 4, 39, 40 or disarm PAR-2. 41, 42 Differential results may be due to altered protein processing in different cell types or different assays used. We tested if several proteases implicated in allergy can activate PAR-2 expressed in airway cells, and observed activation with human lung tryptase, neutrophil elastase, and dust mite protease Der p 3 ( Supplementary Fig   S2L-R) .\n\nWe observed expression of PAR-2 in nasal septal squamous RPMI 2650 cells (Supplementary Fig S3) . PAR-2 peptide agonist 2FLI increased intracellular calcium (Supplementary Fig S4) and transiently activated protein kinase C (Supplementary Fig S5) in both RPMI 2650 and lung squamous line NCI-H520. We also observed activation of PAR-2 by human lung tryptase and Der p 3 (Supplementary Fig S6) . PAR-2 activation also had a small but significant effect of acutely reducing squamous cell line metabolism and/or proliferation through lowering of cAMP, but did not activate apoptosis (Supplementary Fig S7) . PAR-2 activation increased secretion of TNFa and GM-CSF from RPMI 2650 cells and IL-6 and GM-CSF from NCI-H520 cells, likely involving dual coupling to Gq and Gi G protein isoforms (Supplementary Fig S8) .\n\nThus, PAR-2 in airway squamous cells can regulate inflammation. We next tested how PAR-2 signaling and polarization change with epithelial de-differentiation and/or remodeling using primary cells.\n\nTo begin to understand how epithelial remodeling changes polarization of PAR-2 in primary sinonasal cells, we initially de-differentiated/remodeled primary ciliated air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures by two methods. The first was exposure to IL-13 (10 ng/ml, basolateral), which induces cilia loss and goblet cell metaplasia. 43, 44 The second was apical submersion, which induces a more squamous phenotype. 43, 45 ALIs were cultured for 21 days to establish a well-ciliated baseline (Fig 2A) . IL-13 or apical submersion both resulted in a decrease in the number of ciliated cells over 6 days, shown by a reduction in b-tubulin IV immunofluorescence (Fig 2A-B) . While IL-13 increased goblet cell specific Muc5AC intensity (Figs 2A and C) , submersion only minimally increased Muc5AC at 6 days (Figs 2A and C) . Submersion instead increased expression of transgutaminase 1 (TG-1; measured via ELISA), previously reported to reflect squamous differentiation 46, 47 (Fig 2D) . Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) remained intact up to 4 days (Fig 2E) , and maintenance of epithelial barrier function was confirmed by measurement of FITC-conjugated dextran flux at day 4 as well as ability of cells to maintain low apical glucose levels (Supplementary Fig S9A) . Evidence of cell death (LDH release) was not observed (Supplementary Fig S9B) .\n\nauthor/funder. All rights reserved.

At this time point, we saw no differences in expression of PAR-2 by qPCR (Supplementary Fig S9C) , which mimicked a lack of differences observed in nasal polyp tissue (frequently characterized by type II inflammation) and control middle turbinate tissue (Supplementary Fig S9C) , in contrast to another study. 48 As a control, we did see increased expression of PAR-2 in ALIs after lipopolysaccharide (LPS), agreeing with previous results from bronchial fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig S9C) . 49 \n\nIn primary ALIs at 5 days after seeding, when ALIs have electrical resistance but cilia have not yet developed, both apical or basolateral 2FLI or trypsin induced calcium responses (Fig 3A   and F) . After a saturating dose of apical 2FLI, another increase in apical 2FLI did not elicit a further response, while application of basolateral 2FLI did (Fig 3A, left) . This suggests that 2 separate pools of PAR-2 receptors exist, separated by the apical-to-basolateral tight junction diffusional barrier. By day 21, responses to apical 2FLI or trypsin were lost, while responses to basolateral stimulation were intact (Fig 3B and F) .\n\nIf primary cells were incubated for a further 4 days with the apical side submerged (Day 21 + 4 submerged) to promote squamous de-differentiation, the response to apical 2FLI was again observed (Fig 3C and F) . Basolateral application of antagonist FSLLRY-NH2 blocked the response to basolateral but not apical 2FLI (Fig 3C, right) , ruling out 2FLI diffusion across the epithelial barrier to the basolateral side. Similar results were seen at ALIs after 4 subsequent days of basolateral IL-13 (Fig 3D) . If primary ALIs were carried out to day 25 with no IL-13 and no apical submersion, only basolateral 2FLI responses were observed (Fig 3F) . RPMI2650 squamous cells cultured at ALI also had 2FLI responses with application to either the basolateral or apical side; basolateral addition of antagonist blocked basolateral but not apical responses (Fig   3E and F) . No significant differences in TEERs were observed (Fig 3G) .\n\nWe measured airway surface liquid (ASL) height in primary ALIs. Physiological ASL was labeled with Texas red dextran sonicated in perfluorocarbon (PFC) and ASL height was measured from orthogonal confocal slices. Primary ALIs were compared at differentiation day 25 (Fig 4A) or after 21 days + 4 subsequent days IL-13 (Fig 4B) . Baseline ASL height was not different.\n\nBasolateral 2FLI caused an increase in ASL height in both groups (Figs 4A-C) that was inhibited by basolateral application of the Na + K + 2Clco-transporter (NKCC) inhibitor bumetanide (Fig 4C) ,\n\nshowing that this reflected fluid secretion. However, when 2FLI was added to the apical side in PFC, IL-13 treated cultures, but not control cultures, exhibited increased ASL height (Figs 4A-C) that was blocked by calcium-activated Clchannel (CaCC) inhibitor CaCCinh-A01 but not CFTRinh-\n\nSimilar responses to apical 2FLI were observed after 21 days of differentiation + 4 days of submersion (Fig 4C) . Apical 2FLI response was blocked by PAR-2 antagonist FSLLRY-NH2 ( Fig   4C) . We performed experiments using cells from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients homozygous for DF508 CFTR. CF ALIs robustly secreted fluid in response to PAR-2 stimulation. These data suggest that apical PAR-2 agonist exposure does not result in epithelial fluid secretion in well differentiated cultures, but remodeling or dedifferentiation results in apical PAR-2-activated fluid secretion via CaCC.\n\nTo further examine effects of PAR-2 signaling alterations above, we examined secretion of TGF-b2, an important epithelial-derived cytokine in type 2 airway diseases, 50 In RPMI 2650 ALIs, TGF-b2 secretion was activated by basolateral 2FLI and inhibited ~50% by Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX; Fig 5A) . In contrast, activation of the TNF-a receptor, which is not a GPCR, increased TGF-b2 that was not inhibited by PTX (Fig 5A) . In primary differentiated ALIs, apical 2FLI had no effect, but basolateral 2FLI increased TGF-b2 that was inhibited by basolateral but not apical FSLLRY-NH2 (Fig 5B) . Similarly, apical trypsin or lung tryptase had little effect while basolateral trypsin and tryptase increased TGF-b2 secretion (Fig 5B) .\n\nIn RPMI 2650 ALIs or ALIs exposed to 4 days of submersion, apical 2FLI increased TGF-b2 ( Fig 5C) . It also potentiated TGF-b2 secretion in the presence of TNF-a (Fig 5C) . In RPMI 2650\n\nALIs and primary ALIs treated with basolateral TNF-a, basolateral 2FLI caused a further increase of TGF-b2 beyond TNF-a alone (Fig 5C) . In RPMI 2650s and ALIs exposed to 4 days of submersion, this occurred with apical 2FLI as well (Fig 5C) . Similar results were observed in mouse nasal septum ALI cultures with responses lost in ALIs from PAR-2 knockout (par2 -/-) mice ( Supplementary Fig S10) .\n\nauthor/funder. All rights reserved.

We tested if other alterations of epithelial development and ciliogenesis cause this phenotype. We used cigarette smoke condensate (CSC), shown to inhibit ciliogenesis in nasal ALIs. 17 Human ALIs cultured in the presence of 10-30 \u00b5g/ml CSC exhibited impaired ciliogenesis at day 20 ( Supplementary Fig S11A-B) . Higher concentrations increased epithelial permeability, but barrier function remained intact up to 30 \u00b5g/ml CSC (Supplementary Fig S11C-D) .\n\nIn day 20 human nasal ALIs cultured in 10-30 \u00b5g/ml CSC, apical 2FLI, Der 3 p, and tryptase induced calcium responses, while control cells (0 \u00b5g/ml CSC) did not respond ( Supplementary   Fig S11E) . Apical PAR-2 activation also induced TGF-b2 and GM-CSF in human nasal ALIs cultured in 10-30 \u00b5g/ml CSC, while control cells responded only to basolateral PAR-2 stimluation ( Supplementary Fig S11E-F) . Similar results were observed in mouse ALIs, and par-2 -/mice confirmed responses were indeed due to PAR-2 (Supplementary Fig S12) . Fig S13A) , increased acetylated tubulin (Supplementary Fig S13B) , and increased TEER (Supplementary Fig S13C) . R.A.-deficient (15 nM) ALIs exhibited apical 2FLI calcium responses (Supplementary Fig S13D) while R.A. replete (50 nM) ALIs did not (Supplementary Fig S13D) . Similar results were observed with tryptase and PAR-2 agonist AC-5541 (Supplementary Fig S13E) . Calcium responses correlated with GM-CSF secretion at 24 hrs. Thus, impairment of ciliogenesis by CSC or reduced R.A. can both alter epithelial polarity of PAR-2 signaling.\n\nTo further test if epithelial remodeling observed in airway diseases translates to altered PAR-2 responses, we took tissue explants from nasal polyps, removed from CRS patients during functional endoscopic sinus surgery, and control middle turbinate tissue, removed from patients during the course of surgery for other indications (e.g., trans-nasal approaches to the skull base to author/funder.

Tissue was mounted, imaged by confocal microscopy, and stimulated apically with PAR-2 agonists. Polyp tissue exhibited apical responses to 2FLI, trypsin, or Der p 3, but not thrombin (Fig 6A-B) . Control uninflamed middle turbinate tissue did not (Fig 6C) . Data are summarized in (Fig 6D) . Immunofluorescence revealed that PAR-2 was nonetheless basolaterally expressed in ciliated cells from nasal polyp (Fig 6E) , as we previously reported for non-polyp tissue. 8 Moreover, the calcium responses to PAR-2 stimulation were no enhanced in isolated polyp vs turbinate ciliated cells (Fig 6F) . We thus hypothesized that apical PAR-2 responses do not originate from within the ciliated cells themselves.\n\nTo test if ciliated cells autonomously respond to apical PAR-2 stimulation, we measured ciliary beat frequency (CBF) to apical PAR-2 agonists in control and IL-13-treated cultures. We combined CBF measurement with two structurally distinct gap junction inhibitors, steroid-like small molecule inhibitor carbenoxolone (CBX) and peptide inhibitor Gap 27. 28 Control cultures exhibited CBF increases with basolateral but not apical 2FLI; basolateral responses were unaffected by CBX (Fig 7A, B, and G) . IL-13 treated cultures exhibited CBF increase with apical 2FLI (Fig 7C) inhibited by CBX or Gap 27 (Fig 7D-F and G) . Basolateral 2FLI responses were not inhibited by CBX. Apical ATP responses were inhibited by neither CBX nor Gap 27 (Fig 7G) . These data support a model by which well differentiated epithelium (Fig 7H) expresses basolateral PAR-2 within ciliated cells, as CBF increases do not require intercellular gap junction communication ( Fig   7H) . However, dedifferentiation of the epithelium results in apical expression of PAR-2 within nonciliated cells that can increase CBF in ciliated cells only in the presence of functional gap junctions, likely to allow diffusion of calcium and/or IP3 (Fig 7I) .\n\nauthor/funder.

This may represent a novel mechanism by which the airway epithelium can be \"sensitized\" to apical exposure to inspired/inhaled proteases such as dust mite or Alternaria proteases. This may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory airway diseases. We also confirm previous observations that PAR-2 is a player in detection of A. fumigatus.\n\nOur data suggest that such alterations of epithelial morphology and composition due to inflammation, exposure to toxic compounds, or other environmental factors can all alter PAR-2 polarity (Fig 8) . This may occur through increased Th2 cytokines, cigarette smoke exposure, or vitamin A deficiency. Exposure to inhaled allergens like dust mite or fungal proteases may normally be tolerated in healthy airway tissue if these allergens are cleared by mucociliary clearance before they can degrade the epithelial barrier and activate basolateral PAR-2.\n\nMoreover, airway submucosal gland secretions contain a variety of protease inhibitors that could neutralize pathogen proteases upon contact with mucus. 55, 56 However, in some obstructive airway diseases, altered polarization of PAR-2 may combine with impaired protease inhibitor secretion due to gland duct plugging often observed. [57] [58] [59] These phenotypes may result in epithelial sensitization to proteases at the apical membrane, increasing inflammatory responses.\n\nSquamous de-differentiation is a commonly observed histological finding in CRS patients, 19, 20 CF patients, 60 or smokers. 16, 61 Squamous metaplasia also occurs during epithelial injury and repair. 15 Prior studies have focused on the loss of ciliated cells and resulting reduced mucociliary clearance, but we show here that introduction of squamous cells into the epithelium can alter airway epithelial signaling, including an increase in apical PAR-2 responsiveness. This suggests disruption of the normal epithelial composition during disease has physiological consequences beyond reduced mucociliary clearance.\n\nRPMI 2650 cells were proposed as a model of nasal permeability for drug transport studies 62, 63 and cytokine release in allergy 64 or viral infection. 65 Our data here suggest that RPMI 2650 PAR-2 polarization is similar to squamous epithelial cells but not the same as welldifferentiated ciliated cells, so interpretation of RPMI 2650 studies should be done cautiously.\n\nAltered polarization may extend to multi-drug resistance proteins or other transporters or channels relevant for epithelial absorption. RPMI 2650 studies might not reflect healthy sinonasal epithelium but may reflect inflamed remodeled epithelium such as polyp tissue. author/funder. All rights reserved.

Such antagonists delivered via inhaler may be similarly useful in patients with allergic asthma. Alternatively, restoring a normal differentiated epithelial phenotype by reducing inflammation may lower the epithelial sensitivity to proteases. author/funder. All rights reserved.
