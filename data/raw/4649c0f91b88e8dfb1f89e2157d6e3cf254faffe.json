{"title": "TETRAHEDRON REPORT NUMBER 370 THE NATURAL PRODUCTS CHEMISTRY OF WEST INDIAN GORGONIAN OCTOCORALS", "body": "The octocoral fauna of the West Indies is unique ill its profusion of gorgonian corals (also known as sea whips, sea fans, or sea plumes).t Faunistically, extensions of the West Indian region reach into the Gulf of Mexico, all the Antilles, the Bahamas, the Florida Keys, the Bermudas, the Islands of the Caribbean, and south along the northeast coast of South America to the reefs of Brazil. All over this region the families Gorgoniidae and Rico. Their structures were defined by chemical and spectroscopic methods. Although diterpenoids 13-17 did not display significant antibacterial activity, they possess strong cytotoxicity when screened against a panel of five human tumor cell lines. 28 Recently, sixteen additional asbestinin diterpenes, asbestinins 11-23 (18-30) , 11acetoxy-4-deoxyasbestinin E (31), 1 l-acetoxy-4-deoxyasbestinin F (32) , and 4-deoxyasbestinin G (33), were isolated from Puerto Rican specimens of B. asbestinum and identified by interpretation of spectral data and chemical methods. 29 That publication also includes structure revisions for asbestinin-6 (13) and asbestinin-7 (14) . 29 The same study also resulted in the isolation of known diterpene (4S*,9R*,14S*)-4-acetoxy-9,14dihydroxydolasta-1 (15),7-diene (34) which has the dolastane carbon skeleton. 3\u00b0 Compound 34 represents the first dolastane to be isolated from a species of the genus Briareum and extends the structural variability for this species. The hexane extract of the same specimen of B. asbestinum contained traces of a novel seco-asbestinin diterpenoid. The structure of 35, the first representative of this novel class of diterpenoids, was assigned on the basis of extensive NMR analyses and by comparison with analogous spectral data from related asbestinane diterpenoids. 31 Confirmation of structure 35 was achieved by partial synthesis from known asbestinin-6 (13).\n\nInterestingly, seco-asbestinin derivative 35 was not cytotoxic against HeLa and CHO-KI cells, suggesting a possible role for the ten-membered ring in the cytotoxic properties of asbestinane diterpenes. A collection of B. Briareum asbestinum also produces a series of interesting, highly oxidized diterpenes called briareins, which may sometimes contain chlorine, headed by briarein A (37) . The X-ray structure of briarein A, isolated from B. asbestinum collected in Jamaica, has been reported. 33 The physical and chemical properties of briarein A as well as those for a tetraacetate monobutyrate analog of 37, briarein B (38) , which were obtained during collections of B. asbestinum from Belize 23 and Honduras, 24 have also been reported. 24 Extracts of B. asbestinum collected off the coast of Tobago, have afforded five diterpenes 39-43 that belong to the briarane class. 32 The structures of briaranes 39-43 were determined spectroscopically and that of methyl briareolate (39) , a crystalline compound, was confirmed by X-ray crystal structure. 34 Brianthein V (44) is a cytotoxic and antiviral diterpene from B. asbestinum collected near Sandy Cay, Bahamas. X-ray analysis of a suitable crystal of 44 grown from a solution of methanol furnished the absolute structure and ring conformation. 35 The variation in defensive chemistry of colonies of Briareum asbestinum, which has been recognized as one of the most ubiquitous and chemically deterrent of the Caribbean gorgonians, has been sampled. The basis of deterrence appears to reside in the diverse complement of briarane and asbestinane diterpenoids found in individual colonies. 36 The structural variability for this species has been expanded even further with the recent discovery of five new diterpenoids possessing the eunicellin ring system from B. asbestinum collected in Puerto Rico. The isolation of asbestinins, briareins, and eunicellins from the same organism supports the theory that metabolites belonging to these skeleton Detailed analysis of the spectral data and chemical correlation of briantheins X and Z established the gross structures of these highly oxidized, chlorinated diterpenes. X-ray diffraction confirmed the placement of the butyrate ester in brianthein Y and defined the absolute configuration for all three compounds. 39 Briantheins Y (46) and Z (47) have also been found in specimens ofB. asbestinum collected in the Bahamas. 35 Two additional nonchlorinated diterpenes with the briarane skeleton, brianthein-W (48) and the unnamed compound 49, were reported from the same organism shortly after. The structure of brianthein-W was defined from spectral data and X-ray diffraction studies. 40 The structure of brianthein 49 was described in 1986, but the spectral data for this metabolite were not reported. 41 Two of these compounds, brianthein Y (46) and brianthein W (48), have been tested to determine their effects on the feeding behavior of the grasshopper Melanoplus bivittatus, a major agricultural nuisance in the plain and plateau states. 40 Brianthein Y proved toxic at a high dose but inactive at a lower dose; brianthein W produced no deleterious effect at either dose. 42,43 Briantheins Y (46) and Z (47) showed viral inhibition in the in vitro mouse corona-virus assay, and 47 is also active in vitro against Herpex simplex-I virus and P338 cells. 35 Brianthein Y was quite toxic at 250 ppm when subjected to the tobacco hornworm assay.43 A unique antimicrobiai pyranone, bissetone (50) , was isolated from the very polar extracts of B. polyanthes. Spectroanalytical and chemical methods were used to develop plausible structures, but X-ray diffraction settled the correct structure and relative stereochemistry. 44 The (S,S) configuration of (-)-bissetone has been established by total synthesis from D-glucose. 45 In addition, a species of Briareum from Puerto Rico, which was identified as either B. asbestinum or B. polyanthes, contained nine new briarane diterpenes, which were named briareolides A-I (51-59). 46 Their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods, especially one-Natural products of gorgonian octocorals 4577 and two-dimensional NMR. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of briareolide B (52) were determined by X-ray analysis. 46 Some of the briareolides [A(51), B(52), C (53), D (54) , and E (55)] display antiinflammatory activity. However, these briarein type compounds, which are all nonchlorinated and highly oxygenated, were not cytotoxic against P-388 leukemia cells. All the briareolides except briareolide G (57), which has an ~x,l~unsaturated ~/-lactone, contain an ~x,13-epoxy-7-1actone, a feature found only in a few other briarane diterpenes isolated from Briareum spp. 46\n\nRelatively uncommon, the only documented species of this genus, Erythropodium caribaeorum, can be found from southern Florida to the Virgin Islands. E. caribaeorum specializes in the biosynthesis of diterpenoids of the briarane skeleton class. These compounds, named erythrolides, are usually chlorinated at C-6 and are highly oxygenated. \n\nOAc OAc H OR2 ..,--'1\"~ ~\"\"--\u00a2\"~ CH 3 . ~ CH a O,\n\nErythrolide A (60) and erythrolide B (61), isolated from the encrusting Caribbean gorgonian coral Erythropodium caribaeorum collected in Carrie Bow Cay, Belize, are two remarkably interesting chlorinated diterpenes. The structures of erythranes 60 and 61 were determined by X-ray analysis and from spectral data, respectively. Photochemical conversion of 61 into 60, by a di-~-methane rearrangement, helped confirm their structural relationship. 47 Erythrolides A and B along with seven additional erythrolides have been isolated from E. caribaeorum collected in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Jamaica. The structures of erythrolides C-I (62-68) were elucidated from spectroscopic dam. 46 All of these erythrolides, except erythrolide H (67) , arc chlorinated at the C-6 position. Erythrolide H (67) is unique among the compounds in this series in having a C-5,6 double bond and a 4578 A.D. RODRIGUEZ hydroxyl substituent at C-16 instead of an exocyclic C-5,16 double bond. Erythropodium caribaeorum obtained off the coast of Tobago yielded also the diterpenes erythrolide A (60), erythrolide B (61), and erythrolide E (64) along with a new diterpene, which has been designated erythrolide J (69) . The structure of 69 was determined by high-resolution NMR. 48 Erythrodiene (70), a new sesquiterpene hydrocarbon of a rare structural class, has been isolated from E. caribaeorum collected at Chub Cay, Bahamas. The structure of 70 was assigned from spectral studies and through X-ray analysis of the diol obtained during ozonolysis of erythrodiene followed by reductive work up with NaBH4. 49 Erythrodiene has been synthesized from 4-isopropylcyclohexanol in 8 steps and approximately 16% overall yield. The synthesis features a stereoselective intrarnolecular carbomercuration reaction as the key step. 50 When an extract of E. caribaeorum was incorporated into food strips, natural groups of fishes on the same reef from which the gorgonian had been collected were deterred from feeding. The feeding deterrent effects were present in a sample fraction containing erythrolides, but not in a fraction containing erythrodiene (70) . Although the erythrolides appear to defend E. caribaeorum from reef predators, the function of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons remains unclear. 51 2.3, Eunicea (family Plexauridae) Gorgonians of the common Caribbean genus Eunicea were among the first marine invertebrates to be investigated chemically with over fifteen species documented. Although common and abundant, the genus Eunicea is taxonomically complex with many species varying only slightly in form and color. Consequently, secure species assignments were difficult to make and over the years a comprehensive chemical evaluation of this group was impeded. Animals belonging to this genus are usually rich in cembrane diterpenoids.\n\nAsperdiol (71) is an antineoplastic agent (found in both Eunicea asperula and Eunicea tourneforti collected in the Caribbean region), whose structure was elucidated by X-ray analysis. 52 Asperdiol is unique in that it was the first cembrane lacking the lactone function that displays significant in vitro antitumor activity in the National Cancer Institute's KB, PS, and LE test systems. The I3C-NMR spectral assignments of asperdiol, 53 its synthesis, 54,55 as well as the synthesis of two plausible precursors, have been reported. 56,57 Asperketals A-F (72) (73) (74) (75) (76) (77) are diterpenes isolated from the Caribbean sea whip E. asperula collected along the offshore islands of the Tobago Cays. Compounds 72-76 are ketals and hemiketals related to the dilophol class of 10-memhered-ring diterpenoids, while asperketal F (77) belongs to the fuscol class. Their structures were assigned on the basis of chemical and spectroscopic studies. 58 In addition, the isolation of the known diterpenoid obscuronatin (78) from the same organism was reported. Further studies to determine the stereochemistry of this compound were not pursued. The stereochemistry of asperketal B (73) (89) is an elemene-type diterpene that has been isolated from the gorgonian Euniceafusca collected near South Caicos, W.I. 62 Although the data collected did not permit unequivocal assignment of the stereochemistry at C-4 in fuscol, the isolation of ketone 90 from the same animal implies that the side chain should be equatorial. An E configuration could be assigned to the disubstituted double bond. However, the geometry of the trisubstituted double bond could not be specified in the original report although it was later assigned as E. 63 Their structures were elucidated by combined spectra and chemical methods and in that study the researchers established that the structure of palominol should be revised from 97 to 102. 68 A brine shrimp assay, which was used as a simple lethality test to screen for biological activity in palominol, produced a 0% death response at an initial concentration of 30 I.tg/mL after a 24 hour count period. When screened for antimicrobial activity palominol was found to inhibit weakly the growth of Gram negative bacteria. 67 Palominol also displayed modest cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 10 I.tg/mL) against the human colon (HCT 116) cell line. 69 Isopalominol (103) Specimens collected at Jamaica and the Florida Keys contain (+)-o~-muurolene (112) \n\nThe structure of this y-cembranolide, which showed significant cytotoxicity against CHO-K 1 cells, was assigned on the basis of spectral analysis. 88 The structures of six additional cembrane derivatives, eupalmerone (117) \n\nAlso isolated from the same organism were four known (x-methylene-7-1actone derivatives, namely, euniolide \n\nF. Eunicea palmeri (Bayer) (Palmer's Eunicea ) Eunicea palmeri from Miami contains (+)-~-muurolene (112) and (+)-I~-copaene (141) . 3 E. palmeri has also been reported to contain (+)-~l-ylangene (142), 74 although this claim was later noted to be incorrect. 5 A study on a new route to the total synthesis of (+)-ct-and I~-copaene and (+)-ylangene has been reported. 92 The 7cembranolide eupalmerin acetate (113) (147), which occurs largely as the acetate 148.100,101 The structure of cueunicin (147) was proposed on the basis of spectral analyses and chemical degradation and that of cueunicin acetate (148) by X-ray crystallography. 102 A systematic fractionation of the crude extract of specimens collected in Bimini led to the discovery of (13ctH, 14~H)-jeunicin (149) . The molecular structure and absolute configuration of 149 (also known as 13,14-bis-epijeunicin) 6 were determined by X-ray crystallography. 99 This compound displayed in vitro cytotoxicity against KB and LE cell lines. The marine cembranolide peunicin (150) was isolated as the major component from the hexane extract of E. succinea collected in Panama. 103 The 4586 A.D. RODRIOU~ molecular structure and absolute configuration were determined from X-ray data. 104 Peunicin (150) is cytotoxic in vitro against KB and PS cell lines and, like eunicin (143) , jeunicin (145) , and eupalmerin acetate (113) , shows strong anticiliary action. 81-84 Epipeunicin (151) is an unstable 7-1actonic cembranolide diterpene isolated from the same specimen ofE. succinea, and its proposed structure is based on spectral data. 6,103 . . The ~cembranolide 12,13-bisepieupalmerin (152) was isolated from specimens of E. succinea collected in St.\n\nCroix, U.S. Virgin Islands, and identified by X-ray methods. 105 12,13-Bisepieupalmedn possesses the correct stereochemistry to be a biosynthetic precursor for the related cembranolides eunicin (143) and jeunicin (145), which were found to occur with 152 in the same organism. Eunicin (143) (143) were also found in Puerto Rican E. succinea specimens. 76 During this study 12,13-bisepieupalmerin was successfully converted chemically to eunicin (143) and jeunicin (145) under acidic conditions (SiO2, I)205) and thus provided evidence to establish 152 as their logical biosynthetic precursor. All three eembranolides 115, 143, and 152 displayed strong in vitro cytotoxicity against CHO-KI cells. 76 In addition, 12,13-bisepieupalmerin and eunicin were found to be active pharmacologically on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The researchers concluded that these compounds act as noncompetitive inhibitors of peripheral AChR. 106 Extraction of a freshly collected sample of E.\n\nsuccinea from a different location near Puerto Rico yielded 12,13-bisepieupalmerin acetate (155), 12-epieupalmerin acetate (156) , and succinolide (157) liberates free iodine vapors. The iodine probably arises from the thermal degradation of covalently bonded iodine from 3,5-diiodotyrosine (172) . 112 Extracts of this gorgonian collected in the Bahamas were reported to contain at least a dozen nonpolar terpenoids. 113 However, no structures were described in that report. Fractions containing these compounds reduced feeding by natural assemblages of tropical fishes by 87%; sclerites reduced feeding by fishes by 95%. In ship-board feeding experiments, artificial diet containing G. ventalina crude extracts was consumed 49% less by Cyphoma gibbosum (the flamingo tongue snail), an ovulid predatory gastropod that specializes on gorgonians. 113 \n\nSeveral species and varieties of these leaf-corals have been described, largely because of their extraordinary variation in growth form. There is also a wide range of variation in the spicules. The gorgonian P. dilatata is a species endemic to Brazil.\n\nA nardosinane sesquiterpene, 11,12-epoxynardosin-l(10)-ene (177) , was isolated from the Brazilian gorgonian Phyllogorgia dilatata, and its structure has been deduced from chemical evidence and spectral dam. 118 Gorgonians belonging to this genus arc usually rich in cembrane diterpenes and prostanoids.\n\nA. Plexaura A (spee. nov.) 119\n\nPlexaurolone (178) was first discovered from an undescribed gorgonian collected in Puerto Rico that appears to be related to the genus Plexaura, and that was found subsequently in the same species collected at Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. The crystal structure and absolute configuration of the acetate derivative of plexaurolone were determined from three-dimensional X-ray diffraction data. 120 Plexaurolone (178) may represent the first example of a Caribbean cembranoid belonging to the or-series. Later data, however, suggested that the PGA2 of P. homomaUa is not used to compete allelopathically or to reduce fouling, but to provide protection from predators. 140 Interestingly, during a re-evaluation of the ichthyodeterrent role of prostaglandins in P. homomalla, it was found that the consumption of food strips containing the acetoxy methyl ester of (15R)-PGA2 did not differ from consumption of control strips when presented to a natural assemblage of Caribbean coral reef fishes. However, treatment with the acetoxy acid, hydroxy methyl ester, and hydroxy acid of (15R)-PGA2 inhibited consumption of food strips by reef fishes. Although the results of the latter study suggest that the esterified prostaglandins present in P. homomalla do not deter fish predators, these compounds may have very different effects on other potential predators of gorgonians, particularly invertebrates. 141,142 The mechanism of biosynthesis of prostaglandins of the A and E series from P. homomalla, which clearly follows a distinct pathway from the mammalian cyclooxygenase/endoperoxide route, has been the subject of intense research. 143-147 A major discussion of the chemistry and chemical ecology of Plexaura homomalla appeared in 1992. 9\n\nAbout six species of Plexaurella have been distinguished in the West Indian region. They occur in the western Atlantic from the Bermudas to Brazil. Gorgonians belonging to this genus are particularly rich in acyclic and cyclic sesquiterpenes.\n\nA. Plexaurella dichotoma (Esper) (Double-forked Plexaurella) PlexaureUa dichotoma from the Caribbean region has been reported to contain (+)-o~-muurolene (112), (+)-13-bisabolene (174), (-)-a-cureumene (175), (+)-a-bisabolene (194) , and (+)-I~-cureumene (195 \n\nThe gorgonian PlexaureUafusifera from the Caribbean region contains (+)-~-muurolene (112) \n\nThe genus Pseudoplexaura is extremely common and abundant and can be found distributed along the Bermudas, Florida Keys, Bahamas and Antilles regions. Four species of Pseudoplexaura have been documented. This genus is characterized by a complex mixture of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons that have been consistently found in many species from well-separated geographical locations)\n\nA. Pseudoplexaura crucis (spee. nov.)\n\nTrace quantities of the ~-lactonic cembranolide crassin acetate (200) were found to be responsible for the marginal KB activity of Pseudoplexaura crucis collected near St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. Crassin acetate has also been found in other gorgonians belonging to the genus Pseudoplexaura (see below). 150 (203) , and alloaromadendrene (204 \n\nIn addition to (+)-ylangene (142), 74 Pseudoplexaura porosa (originally referred to as P. crassa) contains the same complex mixture of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (112, 141, 154, 201, 202, 203 , and 204) described above. 3,5 (+)-Calamenene (205) , which could be an artifact, was also isolated during steam distillation of the hydrocarbon fraction of P. porosa. 5, 74, 152 The synthesis of (+)-cis-calamenene has been reported. 153 The gorgonian P. porosa was among the first gorgonians to be investigated and, 20 after extensive chemical studies, the structure of crassin acetate (200) Subsequently, crassin acetate was also isolated from several gorgonians of the genus Pseudoplexaura, namely P. flagellosa, P. wagenaari, and P. crucis. 150, 157 This lactone showed substantial activity in the KB test, an in vitro bioassay against a human carcinoma of the nasopharynx, and against P-388 lymphocytic leukemia. 150 The spectral characteristics of crassin acetate, 60 its total 13C-NMR assignment, 158 and the total synthesis of crassin (206) , obtained by saponification of crassin acetate, have been reported. 159-161 An intramolecular alkylation of a lithioalkyne with an allylic bromide has produced the 14-membered ring of crassin acetate (2,00). 162 A nitrile oxide cycloaddition furnished the lactone and the stereocenters at C-I and C-14. The total synthesis of (+)-crassin acetate methyl ether has also been reported. 163 Crassin acetate (200) , which may constitute as much as 1.5-2% of the dry weight of the cortex of the gorgonian P. porosa, functions in the marine ecosystem, along with other related compounds, by decreasing the viability of ciliated larvae of organisms which compete with gorgonians for space.t64, 165 Recently, two additional cytotoxic antitumor diterpenoids of the cembrane class related to crassin acetate, named 14-deoxycrassin (207) and pseudoplexaurol (208) , were isolated from a specimen of P. porosa The first successful synthetic approach to a pseudopterane, viz., 213, was reported. 169 A retrosynthetic strategy for the total synthesis of pseudopterolide (212) and allied pseudopteranes has been reported. 170,171 Several routes to the 2,5-furanocyclic ring system of the pseudopterane family of natural products along with prototype pseudopterane and furanocembrane systems have recently been described. 172-176 A collection of a Pseudopterogorgia spp. from Belize, whose spicule analyses closely related the animal to the Caribbean sea whip P. acerosa, produces exclusively the sesquiterpene 12-hydroxy-E-'pbisabolene (214) . The structure of this alcohol was based upon spectral analyses and chemical interconversions. 177 Tobagolide (215) is a nitrogenous pseudopterane derivative from a Tobago specimen of P. acerosa. 2D-NMR spectroscopy was used to establish the structure of tobagolide as the dimethylamino derivative 215.178 Pseudopterolide (212) can be transformed efficiently into tobagolide (215) by reaction with dimethylamine. Sequential treatment of tobagolide with methyl iodide and sodium hydride results in intramolecular SN' displacement with reconstruction of pseudopterolide. 179,180 Two collections of P. acerosa from Tobago produced mixtures of acids that were esterified with diazomethane to obtain deoxypseudopterolide (216) and acerosolide (217) in the former collection and tobagolide (215) in the latter collection. The reported structural assignments for the pseudopterane 216 and the cembrane 217 were devoid of relevant stereochemistry and depended heavily on 2D-NMR spectroscopy. 181\n\nThe relative stereochemistry shown for acerosolide (217) The structure of an additional pseudopterane, diepoxygorgiacerone (218) , isolated from the same specimen of P. acerosa, was determined by 2D-NMR methods and confirmed by X-ray analysis, which also established its relative stereochemistry. This compound is an unusually stable diepoxyfuran derivative. 184 Six more pseudopteranoids, namely pseudopterolide-methanol adduct (219), gorgiacerone (220), gorgiacerodiol (221), methoxygorgiacerol (222) , isogorgiacerodiol (223) , and bis(gorgiacerol) amine (224) were also isolated from P. acerosa collected around the coast of Tobago and were identified by interpretation of spectral data. 185 The total synthesis of gorgiacerone (220) The weU-known carotenoid peridinin (225) was isolated from a sample ofP. acerosa collected on the north coast of Tobago. After preliminary characterization by conventional spectral methods, the unambiguous 1H-and 13C-NMR assignments of peridinin were carded out. 186 The total synthesis of peridinin has been reported. [187] [188] [189] Further investigations of the polar extracts of this gorgonian led to the isolation and structure determination of the tetrahydroxysterol 226. The structure of acerosterol (226) was determined on the basis of spectral data. 190\n\nAssays on coral reefs have demonstrated that the crude lipid extract of P. acerosa collected at the Grenadine Islands and Belize, deterred natural predators at concentrations below their normal levels in gorgonian tissues.\n\nAssays conducted with purified sclerites from P. acerosa showed that the sclerites alone also function effectively to reduce predation on otherwise palatable food. 191, 192 Similar results were also obtained with the crude lipid extracts of the Caribbean gorgonian P. rigida collected at the same sites. (229) , and (x-chamigrene (231), a new compound, l,l-dimethyl-7-isopropylidene-l,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydronaphthalene (232) . The latter compound was given the trivial name caridiene. The structure of 232 was elucidated by interpretation of spectroscopic data. 194 Two short syntheses of (+)-ct-chamigrene have been reported. 195, 196 Norzooanemonin (233) was isolated from the alcohol extract of P. americana (Florida Keys) by ion exchange followed by alumina chromatography. Its structure was deduced from its elemental composition and spectral features and has been confirmed by synthesis. 197 In addition to norzooanemonin, the betaine fraction contained a mixture that appeared from its NMR spectrum to consist of trigonelline (N-methyl nicotinic acid betaine) and possibly homarine (N-methyl ct-picolinic acid betaine). 197 The proposed structure for furanogermacrene derivative 234, which was isolated from extracts of P. \n\n(Bipinnate sea feathe0\n\nThe gorgonian Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata, a widely distributed member of the genus Pseudopterogorgia, produces a large variety of cembrene derivatives somewhat dependent upon collection site. The characteristic of Pseudopterogorgia cembrenes is their rather high levels of oxygenation. Two cembrene derivatives, the bipinnatolides 242 and 243, were found to have antiinflammatory activity with potency equivalent to that of indomethacin. Their structures were established by spectroscopic, X-ray, and chemical methods. 200 Reportedly, over fifteen cembrane derivatives have been isolated from P. bipinnata but neither their structures nor the spectral data for 242 and 243, appear to have been reported. T T -o=, CH3 .,~ CH3 The structure of pseudopterosin F (268) was determined by X-ray analysis, and the remaining compounds were identified by spectroscopic methods. 217 Pseudopterosin E (267) has superior antiinflammatory properties to those of other compounds in this series, is less toxic, and appears to act by a novel mechanism. Two enantiospecific syntheses of pseudopterosin E from (1S,2R,5S)-(+)-mentho1212 and from (S)-citronella1213 have been outlined.\n\nThe aglycone of pseudopterosin E (267) has been synthesized from 5-methoxytetralone. 218 \n\nThe gorgonian Pseudopterogorgia rigida can be easily distinguished from the more abundant P. americana because it is non-slimy and sparsely branched. The characteristic sesquiterpene components of P. rigida are the ct, 1~, and y-bisabolenes and (-)-ct-curcumene (175) . 223 Three derivatives of the aromatic sesquiterpene \u00a2xcurcumene, (-)-curcuphenol (282), (-)-curcuquinone (283), and (-)-cureuhydroquinone (284), are, collectively, responsible for the antibiotic properties of P. rigida. The structures of these antibacterial metabolites were elucidated by spectral analysis and chemical interconversions. 223 \n\nThe three species documented as belonging to this genus occur along the Bermudas, southern Florida and the Keys, and the Greater Antilles south to Curaqao. The branches of P. citrina are flattened, and the colony is low and sparsely branched. The colonies of P. anceps, however, are bushy and more profusely branched, and larger. Sea whips of this genus are usually rich in polymethylene butenolides. On the other hand, they appear to have an insignificant hydrocarbon content. 74\n\n(Angular sea whip)\n\nThe major component from the pentane extracts of Pterogorgia anceps collected in Bimini, Bahamas, was identified as ancepsenolide (285). 20 The structure of this crystalline bisbutenolide was elucidated by interpretation of spectroscopic data and by chemical degradation. 226 Three total syntheses for ancepsenolide have been reported. 227-229 The latest synthesis, which proceeded in 31% overall yield in seven steps, established the absolute stereochemistry of ancepsenolide as 5S, 5'S. 229 Another dilactone, hydroxyancepsenolide (286), was later isolated from this same organism and its structure was identified by spectroscopic and chemical methods. 230\n\nField and laboratory experiments have demonstrated the feeding-deterrent properties of lipid-soluble extracts of the octocoral P. anceps. Bioassay-directed fractionation of these extracts revealed that the deterrent property was restricted to an ancepsenolide-containing fraction. TM Two additional acetogenin class compounds from two collections of P. anceps, one near the reefs surrounding the Bahama Island of San Salvador and a second from 4606 A.D. RODR[GUEZ Belizian waters, have been reported. The structures of 287 and 288, however, have not been elucidated nor their spectroscopic data reported. 231 Laboratory assays of purified metabolites isolated from P. anceps revealed a substantial feeding-inhibitory effect, which was restricted to the ancepsenolide diacetoxy derivative 288. The structure of 296, which has been given the trivial name guadalupensic acid diacetate, 157 was proposed on the basis of spectroscopic data and conversion to ancepsenolide. Lactone 296 exhibited mild antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium smegmatis. In general, gorgonians from this region appear to be quite consistent in that near 89% of their metabolites are terpenoid and only 1.4% and 5.2%, respectively, contain nitrogen or chlorine. Figure 1 shows a graphical breakdown by chemical class of the total number of metabolites isolated during this thirty-seven year period. The diterpenoids, the largest division, are in turn further analyzed and the distribution by skeleton classes of compounds in this group is shown in Figure 2 . These figures profile the current interest in the field and demonstrate some pertinent differences between the secondary metabolism of West Indian gorgonians. For instance, the traditional clear dominance of cembranoid metabolites has been reduced significantly during the late 4608 A.D. RODRIGUEZ 1980's and early 1990's with the discoveries of numerous diterpenoids of the asbestinane and briarane classes.\n\nThey now represent, respectively, the second and third most frequently found types of diterpenoids in gorgonians from this region. Class (from 1958-1994) . A number of these compounds have offered special opportunities for advancing basic science and laying a foundation for new research. For instance, determining the natural functions of these secondary metabolites is currently an issue of more broad interest. Most marine scientists are now convinced about the defensive roles of these compounds and many suspect that they may have contributed to the evolutionary success of the producing organisms (the ecological roles of the majority of these compounds, however, have yet to be clearly dermed). Their interest, coupled with the demonstration of potent feeding deterrence, has added a new dimension to gorgonian biology. Moreover, metabolites isolated from West Indian gorgonians are frequently the subjects of biochemical and biosynthetic investigations. Some of these compounds have already found application as probes for new mechanisms of action, and a selected few may soon be found under development as pharmaceutical agents (i.e. the pseudopterosins are currently in clinical evaluation for topical skin diseases and fuscosides A (91) and B (92) are of possible interest. At this time, however, there are no other compounds isolated from West Indian gorgonians in preclinical study or in clinical evaluation). 235 The majority of the species of gorgonians listed by Bayer (about 80%) 1 are not easily available as chemical targets, since they are either extremely rare or occur very deep. As a result, the emphasis of those already involved in the isolation of new compounds and those who may choose to enter this field, should inevitably move to the study of gorgonians that are rare or difficult to collect. The emphasis on new directions is well justified for it is becoming increasingly difficult to find new compounds from those specimens that are too obvious or easily collected using SCUBA. Notwithstanding, the recent literature provides confidence that many gorgonian species from the West Indian region will continue to yield fascinating and previously undescribed secondary metabolites with potent pharmacological activity. One can comfortably predict not only that the natural products isolated from these marine invertebrates will provide a rich source of biologically active compounds of medicinal importance but, even more importantly, that they will provide models on which to base extensive synthetic programs leading to still more efficacious pharmaceuticals.
