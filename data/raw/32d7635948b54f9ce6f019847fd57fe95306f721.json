{"title": "", "body": "provides the results (reproduction number estimates) for different folds of reporting rate by using three different Serial intervals (SI). Since limited studies are available in details about SI for novel coronavirus so it is obvious to use the serial interval of MRES and SARS but many studies show wide variation in their serial interval [2] . The estimates of serial intervals used in the paper are 7.6 \u00b13.4 and 8.4 \u00b13.8 (in days) respectively for MEES and SARS hence the coefficient of variation (CV) of SI for MERS and SARS seems higher (44.73 % and 45.23 % respectively). Due to this variation, it is highly recommended to a perform sensitivity analysis between SI and reproduction number so that variation between SI and reproduction number for novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) can be obtained.\n\nThere is a significant difference between the estimates of reproduction number reported by WHO and the findings of Shi Zhao et al. and this variation could be due to many reasons including the parameters used in the model (SI) this can be also understood by sensitivity analysis [3] .\n\nFunding Source: None.\n\nEthical Approval: Approval was not required."}
