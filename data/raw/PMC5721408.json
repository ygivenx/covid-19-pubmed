{"title": "A global perspective on hepatitis B\u2010related single nucleotide polymorphisms and evolution during human migration", "body": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a global disease. The majority of carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are inhabitants of Africa and Asia.1, 2 Immune tolerance is a hallmark of persistent HBV infection.3 Typically, patients with chronic hepatitis B are infected through their parents in the early stage of life.4 Remarkably, the immune system of the host may respond to the HBV5 but does not produce the immune clearance of HBV. HBV may replicate in host cells peacefully until they enter immune clearance phases 2\u20104 decades later.3 If the HBV can be eradicated, HBV replication will be terminated, and ultimately 50% of hosts may clear HBsAg by 80 years of age.6 Genome\u2010wide association studies from Asia have revealed that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)\u2010DP and HLA\u2010DQ loci play roles in persistent HBV infection. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Our objective is to understand the evolution of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were responsible for HBV\u2010related immune tolerance during human migration and to correlate the HBV\u2010related SNPs with a prevalence of chronic HBV infection among global populations. Based on the data from 1,000 genomes collected worldwide, we conducted a global perspective study on the allele frequency of hepatitis\u2010related SNPs.\n\nBased on a literature review, 12 HBV\u2010 and HLA\u2010related SNPs,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 five hepatitis\u2010 and immune\u2010related SNPs in complement factor B (CFB), clusters of differentiation molecule 40 (CD40), and interferon lambda 4 (IFNL4) loci14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and five nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)\u2010related SNPs in HLA regions19, 20, 21 were selected for this analysis (Tables 1 and 2). These SNP data from around the world were downloaded from the phase 3 data of 1,000 genomes (http://www.1000genomes.org/).22 The subjects participating in the 1,000 genome project were older than 18 years and had three out of four grandparents who identified themselves as members of the group. The location of the 26 populations evaluated in the 1,000 genomes are shown by abbreviation on a global HBsAg prevalence map reported by Hou et al.2 (Fig. 1). The allele frequencies of different geographic groups in viral hepatitis\u2010related SNPs and NPC\u2010related SNPs are illustrated in Fig. 2. The SNP genotype differences between groups are listed in Tables 1 and 2. We used interactive chi\u2010square tests to calculate the difference in genotypes between groups (http://quantpsy.org).\n\nAmong two HBV\u2010 and immune\u2010related SNPs in the CFB and CD40 regions14, 15 and three hepatitis C virus\u2010related SNPs in the IFNL4 regions,16, 17, 18 allele type differences can be found between Africa and Europe or between Africa and South Asia (Fig. 2A). All these immune\u2010related SNP genotypes differed significantly between Esan in Nigeria and Toscani in Italy and between Luhya in Webuye, Kenya (LWK) and Gujarati in India (GIH) (Table 1; P < 0.001).\n\nAmong 12 HBV\u2010 and HLA\u2010related SNPs,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 the allele frequency showed marked differences between South and East Asian genome samples (Fig. 2B). Eight of the 12 SNPs differed significantly between Bengali in Bangladesh (BEB) and Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna, China (CDX); these areas represent the junction of South and East Asia (Table 2; P < 0.001).\n\nThree of the 12 HBV\u2010 and HLA\u2010related SNPs (Fig. 2B, dotted lines; rs9276370, rs3128917, and rs9380343) also showed significant differences between LWK in Africa and GIH in South Asia (Table 2; P < 0.001). In contrast, we found the allele frequency of NPC\u2010related SNPs18, 19, 20 to be relatively stable among different populations (Fig. 2C).\n\nBased on the well\u2010known human migration pathways23, 24 and the recent data from 1,000 genomes,22 our analysis of hepatitis\u2010 and immune\u2010related SNPs demonstrate a significant change in allele frequency shortly after the migration out of Africa (Fig. 2A). All genotypes of five immune\u2010related SNPs differed significantly between Esan in Nigeria in Africa and Toscani in Italy in Europe and between LWK in Africa and GIH in South Asia (Table 1; P < 0.001). In addition, both CFB and CD40 shifted from a higher expression in African genotypes (rs12614:TT; rs1883832:CC) to a lower expression in European and South Asian genotypes (rs12614:CC; rs1883832: TT).14, 15 These changes conferred a decrease in the strength of immune responses. The CC genotype of rs12979860 (IFNL4), which is more prevalent in East Asia, is associated with a lower baseline IFNL3 (interleukin\u201028B) expression.16, 17 The IFNL4 open reading frame is truncated by a polymorphic frame\u2010shift insertion (rs368234815), which turns IFNL4 into a polymorphic pseudogene in East Asian populations.18 Because the prevalence of HBsAg is higher in Africa than in Europe or South Asia, these trends of decreased immune protein expression are not related to HBV\u2010specific immune tolerance. Although it is clear that Europeans and South Asians are two different races, they showed similar genetic adaptions when they migrated out of Africa. These changes suggest that the decreased expression of immune\u2010related genes might have been an important survival strategy when humans migrated into new territories and faced new pathogens. The contact between different races of humans may induce devastating diseases, for example, when the New World was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492.25 A similar situation was well documented when Japan sent troops to Taiwan in 1874 and 1895; only 0.1% to 0.3% of soldiers died in battle, while around 10% died of diseases in a short period of time after arrival.26\n\n\nOur second principal result is that the allele frequency of HBV\u2010 and HLA\u2010related SNPs show marked differences between South and East Asian genome samples (Fig. 2B). Eight of the 12 SNPs differed significantly between BEB and CDX (Table 2; P < 0.001). These two populations are located at the junction of South and East Asia. The unique allele types of HBV\u2010related SNPs in East Asian populations are different from those of other geographic populations. These genotypic changes could be related to antigen presentation and could be associated with persistent HBV infection.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Our findings are in agreement with a higher prevalence of HBsAg in East Asia than in South Asia (Fig. 1). These genotypic populations are generally overlapped in the Y chromosome haplogroup O1\u2010O3 distribution map (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Y\u2010chromosome_DNA_ haplogroup) as they started in the Indo\u2010China Peninsula and travelled to northern China and Japan.\n\nGiven the results, we theorized on the reason behind the dramatic allele differences in HBV\u2010related SNPs between BEB in South Asia and CDX in East Asia. One possible explanation for this variation involves the consideration of environmental landscape factors.27 For example, Bangladesh is a predominately rich, fertile, and flat land, with many areas situated less than 12 m above sea level. On the other hand, Xishuangbanna is situated in a mountainous and forested area that has the largest diversity of plants and animals in China.\n\nRegions with higher plant and animal biodiversity are often accompanied by an increased range and abundance of vector\u2010borne or nonvector\u2010borne diseases.28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 Accordingly, the inhabitants of these areas should be able to tolerate an increased number of unfamiliar microorganisms. We speculated that the subjects who demonstrate direct and strong immune responses may die of a cytokine storm in fulminant hepatitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza, and other infections.30, 31, 32, 33, 34 This concept is supported by a lower mortality rate from influenza H1N1 in Asia than in Australia, New Zealand, and North America.35\n\n\nCytokine storm was first described in graft\u2010versus\u2010host disease and was soon also identified in many infectious diseases36; many cytokines, chemokines, and complements are involved.37, 38, 39 The immune\u2010related SNPs selected in this study that included IFN (IFNL4), tumor necrosis factor\u2010receptor (CD40), and complements (CFB) are all participants in cytokine storms. HLA class II molecules are associated with antigen presentation and are also modulated by cytokines.40 A cytokine storm is considered to be a hyper\u2010reaction of the immune response to a pathogen that may cause fulminant disease and mortality.36, 37, 38, 39 When humans migrate to a new territory, they face many unfamiliar pathogens. Those subjects with a strong immune response will die of disease, but those subjects with a weak immune response to the pathogens may survive. Chronic HBV infection with an immune tolerance stage is an example of a weak immune response.3, 4, 5\n\n\nEast Asian populations carry similar allele types of HBV\u2010related SNPs (Fig. 2B), although the environments of northern China and Japan differ substantially from those of southern China and the Indo\u2010China Peninsula.41 We therefore propose that there was a significant physical block to gene flow on the Indo\u2010China Peninsula. Most of the survivors in East Asia exhibit delayed HBV\u2010related immune clearance genotypes. This could have been a survival strategy to pass through the Indo\u2010China Peninsula and southern China during human migration. Such HLA class II genotypes are aimed toward an immune tolerance strategy.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 These changes were successful because this group of people spread to northern China and Japan and have become the largest population in the world numerically. However, such a survival benefit may have been a trade\u2010off with cold tolerance as these populations were unable to cross the Bering Strait in large numbers. Indigenous Americans do not show the same HBV\u2010related allele pattern; they have a low prevalence of chronic HBV infection and high influenza\u2010related mortality rates.1, 2, 35\n\n\nOverall, we identified two genetic adaptations that occurred during human migration. The first was the decreased expression of immune\u2010related genes after leaving Africa; the second was the evolution of an HLA system with migration into the Indo\u2010China Peninsula. Both events may have aimed to decrease the strength of the immune response and avoid cytokine storms when facing different types of pathogens. The high prevalence of chronic HBV infection in East Asia could be a consequence of such a strategy. However, persistent HBV infection\u2010related HLA genotypes are not present in the African population (Fig. 2B) and cannot be responsible for the high prevalence of HBsAg in Africa.\n\nDifferent genetic and nongenetic mechanisms of chronic HBV infection are presented between East Asian and African populations.4, 42, 43, 44 We summarize the differences on HBsAg carriers between East Asia and Africa in Table 3. These differences may provide a clue for the mechanism of the function of SNPs in the persistent HBV infection. The high prevalence of low\u2010expression\u2010type immune\u2010related SNPs and chronic HBV infection\u2010related SNPs on the HLA locus may be a reason for a longer hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)\u2010positive phase in East Asia. IFN\u2010alpha has been recommended for treatment of HBeAg\u2010positive chronic hepatitis B. In a larger series from pediatric patients, IFN\u2010alpha was found to be an effective therapy in chronic hepatitis B with severe inflammation that facilitates HBeAg seroconversion in earlier life.45 In addition, HBV\u2010 and HLA\u2010related SNPs are also associated with spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion.46, 47, 48 These genetic polymorphisms could be a reason for an early HBeAg seroconversion and a lower vertical transmission in Africa compared to East Asia.\n\nIt is well known that HBV genotypes A, B, and D show an earlier HBeAg seroconversion compared to genotype C.42, 44 This early HBeAg seroconversion was suggested to be the reason of low vertical transmission in Africa.49 However, HBV genotype B also had an early HBeAg seroconversion but had a high vertical transmission rate in East Asia.4 Therefore, host factors rather than HBV genotypes alone should be considered for the high vertical transmission rate in East Asia. Most HBV\u2010related genome\u2010wide association studies were done in East Asia. We need studies to understand the genetic roles in persistent HBV infection in African populations.\n\nOur study found two stages of genetic changes toward a weak immune response when humans migrated out of Africa. These changes could be a survival strategy for avoiding cytokine storms and surviving in new environments.\n\nAuthor names in bold designate shared co\u2010first authorship."}
