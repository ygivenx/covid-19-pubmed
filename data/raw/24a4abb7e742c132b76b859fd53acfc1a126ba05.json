{"title": "", "body": "For crystallization and gel shift assays, full-length IFITs (1, 3 and 5), and nIFIT1 (residues 7-279) were cloned into a pSMT3 27 vector between BamHI and NotI sites. The fusion proteins contained an N-terminal, Ulp1-cleavable 6xHis-Sumo tag. All proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells using standard protocols, and purified with a two-step Ni-affinity chromatography followed by cleavage of the tag. RNA contaminated samples of IFIT1 and IFIT5 were passed over a Mono Q 4.6/100 PE (GE Healthcare) or HiTrap Q HP 5ml (GE Healthcare) in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and eluted over a shallow salt gradient. To recover IFIT5 that co-purified with RNA from E. coli, the contaminated fractions were incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 5 M NaCl, and buffer exchanged in an Amicon Ultracel (30kDa cutoff) concentrator several times until the bound RNA flowed through (purity was determined by A 260 :A 280 ratios). A final gel filtration step using Superdex75 or Superdex200 (GE Healthcare) columns was carried out in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 3 mM DTT (IFITs 1, 3 and 5) or 20 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 150 mM NaCl and 3 mM DTT (nIFIT1).\n\nSelenomethionyl (SeMet) derivative proteins were expressed by inhibition of methionine biogenesis pathways, and purified as the native. For the gel shift with 7SK-as, IFIT5 was expressed from a pETG10A-hIFIT5 plasmid and purified on a HisTrap column as previously described 7 , followed by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) in 2x PBS and 0.5mM TCEP. For pulldowns, c-myc-hIFIT1 or c-myc-hIFIT5 constructs (wild-type or mutant) were expressed by transfection of pCS2-6myc-based vectors into HEK293 cells. Cells were cultured in DMEM (PAA) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FCS (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin) and lysed by incubation in TAP buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5% (vol/vol) glycerol, 0.2% (vol/vol) Nonidet-P40, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 and protease inhibitor 'cocktail' (Complete; Roche)).\n\nIn vitro transcription protocols were adapted from 28 . Briefly, T7 polymerase was made recombinantly or purchased from NEB and used to transcribe the templates. To generate the various PPP-RNAs for crystallization, we used several dsOligo templates (oligoCT 7 , oligoUT 7 , oligoAT 7, BioCorp DNA, Supplementary Table 4), which encoded 3 templated positions of C, U or A. By ensuring that each reaction contained only CTP, UTP or ATP, the final product was guaranteed to have sequence homogeneity. The typical non-templated n + 1, n + 2 products of T 7 transcription were observed (see crystallization section). The reactions were cleaned up by phenol/chloroform extraction, and precipitated with ethanol. For gel-shift assays, a 44nt PPP-ssRNA (Supplementary Table 5 RNA was purified from the in vitro transcription reaction using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 7SK-as RNA for gel shifts was prepared using the SP6 MEGAscript kit (Invitrogen). 5'monophosphorylated RNA was obtained by adding guanosine 5'-monophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) at a 5:1 ratio to GTP in the in vitro transcription reaction, and capped RNA by adding cap analog (m7G(5')ppp(5')G, Epicentre) at a 4:1 ratio. 5'-OH RNA was prepared by CIP (New England Biolabs) treatment of ppp-RNA. RNA was purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen).\n\nPrior to crystallization, proteins were buffer exchanged into their respective gel filtration buffers supplemented with 1-10 mM TCEP. Crystals of apo IFIT5 were obtained in 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 5-10% PEG 3350 and 0-7.5% glycerol, and used as seeds for SeMet IFIT5 crystallization. Single crystals of SeMet IFIT5 (~0.7 mm x 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm) grew at 4 \u00b0C at 4 mg/ml in 10% PEG 3350, 0.1 M HEPES pH7.5, 2% ethylene glycol. The structure of apo IFIT5 was solved by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) using ShelX 29 to determine the heavy atom substructure, and refined with Arp/Warp 30 , Coot 31 , and Phenix 32 .\n\nThe final model contained residues 2-189 and 193-481 from the full-length construct.\n\nTo crystallize a 1:1 complex of IFIT5:PPP-RNA, pellets of the RNA oligos (see RNA and in vitro transcription) were resuspended in a solution of IFIT5, incubated for at least 1 hour, and purified on Mono Q and Superdex200 columns as described above. Crystals of the complex were obtained at 22 \u00b0C between 5 and 20 mg/ml in 5-10% ethanol and 0.1 M Tris pH 7 -8. The structures were solved using the apo-IFIT5 structure broken up into two search models (residues 1-282 and residues 283-481) for molecular replacement. For the oligo-C structure, four nucleotides were modelled in the electron density and the 5\u2032-phosphate of a fifth nucleotide was also modelled with no electron density visible for the fifth sugar and base.\n\nThe second base was found in both syn-and anti-conformations and both were modelled with occupancy 0.5 for each ( Supplementary Fig. 10a ). For the oligo-U structure, RNA could be modelled up to the 5\u2032-phosphate of the fourth nucleotide ( Supplementary Fig. 10b ). For the oligo-A structure, 4 nucleotides could be modelled within the electron density and the second base was found in the anti-conformation ( Supplementary Fig. 10c ). For the metal ion, both sodium and magnesium could be refined with acceptable temperature factors, but the distances after refinement more closely matched the ligation geometry of magnesium, in the oligo-C and oligo-A complexes. The distances of the metal within the oligo-U complex were more consistent with sodium. The final models contained residues 1-482 (in the oligo-C and oligo-U complex) and residues 6-481 (in the oligo-A structure).\n\nCrystals of SeMet nIFIT1 were obtained at 4 \u00b0C in 17-20% PEG 3350, 0.25-0.3 M KSCN and 6% glycerol at 5-15 mg/ml. The structure was solved by the SAD method using SOLVE 33 APBS was used to calculate surface electrostatic potential 34 , and PyMol to generate all molecular figures 35 .\n\nSmall Angle X-ray Scattering IFIT5 and IFIT5:PPP-RNA were purified as above and dialysed into SAXS buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP). Measurements were made on an Anton Paar SAXSess mc2 equipped with a PANalytical PW3830 X-ray generator and a Roper/Princeton CCD Detector. The beam length was set to 16 mm and the beam profile recorded using an image plate for subsequent desmearing. 1-D data was collected along 10 mm of the CCD, with 10 sec exposure time per frame. For both proteins, data was collected at 4 \u00b0C with 3 different concentrations (to evaluate concentration dependent effects), and for a maximum amount of time before radiation damage was detectable. SAXSquant 3.5 (Anton Paar) was used for background correction, scaling, buffer subtraction and desmearing. The R g and I(0) were estimated from Guinier plots using PRIMUS 36 in the regions between q min (Supplementary Table 3 ) up to qR g < 1.3. Simulated scattering of the crystal structures were computed with CRYSOL 37 , and distance distribution functions (P(r)) determined with GNOM 38 . Porod and Porod-Debye analyses were carried out as described 19 .\n\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assays were adapted from 39 . Protein and RNA were incubated in binding buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 5% v/v glycerol) at 4 \u00b0C at a ratio of 0.5 \u00b5M:0.1 \u00b5M for 2-4 hours, and run on 7% PAGE, 1X TAE supplemented with 100 mM NaCl, in 1X TAE running buffer. The temperature during the run was maintained at < 10 \u00b0C. The RNA was visualized with SyBr Gold (Invitrogen) staining and scanned using a respectively in annealing buffer (10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 /Na 2 HPO 4 pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Annealing was done by heating to 95 \u00b0C followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Proper annealing was verified on a 15% Native PAGE with an RNAse A protection assay ( Supplementary Fig. 16 ). For the agarose gel shift with 7SK-as RNA, IFIT5 was diluted in PBS, and mixed at the indicated concentrations with 50 nM 7SK-as RNA. The reaction was supplemented with 5x loading buffer (250 mM DTT, 50% glycerol, 0.05% Bromophenol Blue, 2 x Tris-glycine) and incubated for 15 min at RT. The reactions were analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel in 1x Tris-glycine running buffer and RNA was stained with SyBr Gold (Invitrogen).\n\nIn 20 \u00b5l reactions, 20 \u00b5g of IFIT5 or IFIT5:PPP-RNA (purified as above) were incubated with Elastase, Trypsin or Chymotrypsin at protease:protein ratios of 1:10, 1:10 and 1:100, respectively. At time points 0 (before addition of protease), 5 min, 15 min, and 30 min, 5 \u00b5l was removed, mixed with 1x SDS sample buffer, boiled at 95 \u00b0C and frozen at -20 \u00b0C until gel analysis.\n\nPoint mutations were introduced into pCS2-6myc-hIFIT1 or pCS2-6myc-IFIT5 using the Quick change II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the primers listed in Supplementary   Table 6 . For precipitation on PPP-RNA, 1 \u00b5g 7SK-as RNA was added to streptavidin resin (Ultralink Immobilized Streptavidin Plus Gel, Pierce 53117), followed by incubation for 60 min with 3 mg HEK293 cell lysates. Beads were washed three times in TAP buffer 2 ; for precipitation of IFIT5, the NaCl concentration in TAP buffer was raised to 250 mM. Proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Staining for c-myc was done using IRDye-conjugated anti-c-Myc (600-432-381) antibody from Rockland.\n\nTo test the influence of IFIT1 PPP-RNA binding mutants on virus replication we used an influenza replication assay 2, 40 \n\nIsogenic HEK293 Flp-In TREx cells that inducibly express the indicated IFIT5 mutants were generated as before 2 . 1x10 5 cells/24-well-cavity were seeded, left untreated or were treated with 1\u00b5g/ml doxycycline for 8h and infected with VSV-GFP (multiplicity of infection: 0.01) and GFP expression was tested in a spectrofluorimeter after 24h. \n\nStructural alignment of potential PPP-RNA interacting residues from IFIT1 using binding site residues from IFIT5 as the reference. The crystal structure of nIFIT1 is depicted in transparent cartoon, with the helices labelled as in Figure S3 . For clarity, only the corresponding residues from IFIT5 are displayed, with the main chain hidden. The orientation is similar to the main text Fig. 2c , right panel.\n\nClose-up view of the metal ion-binding site in IFIT5. Six atoms -two oxygen atoms from the \u03b1 and \u03b3 phosphates, one carboxylate oxygen from Glu 33 and 3 waters (red spheres) -ligate the ion (Mg 2+ , purple and Na + , green) in an octahedral geometry. The refined distances between the ion and its six ligands suggest that the metal is likely magnesium in the oligo-C complex (purple, top), and sodium in the oligo-U complex (green, bottom). Assignment of the metal was based on typical metal-ligand distances of magnesium (~2.1 \u00c5) and sodium (~2.4 \u00c5) 43 . involve 4 atoms in a plane, and one atom usually out of the plane. In RNA, the 3\u2032-carbon is usually out of the plane (C3\u2032-endo), whereas here at N1, it is found in the C2\u2032-endo conformation, which is typical for metal-NTP structures 44 . In contrast, the sugar pucker of N2 is the typical C3\u2032-endo. In c, the 5\u2032-phopshate of N3 is not shown for clarity. residues, and Van der Waal contact residues are circled with green lines. Residues are coloured by the subdomain from which they originate. Only residues within a 4 \u00c5 sphere were considered as Van der Waal contacts, and polar contacts were cut-off at 3.2 \u00c5. *The Van der Waal contact between Phe339 and the second cytosine base occurs only when the base adopts a syn conformation (see Supplementary Fig. 10) . In Fig. 5c , the only IFIT5 residue that interacted with the 5\u2032-triphosphate and was not critical for binding was the metal coordinating residue Glu33, which only led to partial loss of binding when mutated to alanine. One explanation for this is that the loss of the negative charge from Glu33 is partially alleviated by the immediately adjacent Asp334 (Supplementary Fig. 8 ). Y156F in IFIT5 had little impact on binding, presumably because the interaction also involves significant Van der Waals contact between Y156 and the base (N1). H287A, which hydrogen bonds to the second ribose sugar also led to only a partial loss in binding, presumably because the next residue, Gln288, provides a redundant interaction in this region. Interestingly, IFIT1 Q42E, which would interact with the \u03b2-and \u03b3-phosphates (based on IFIT5), did not lead to loss of binding in IFIT1. This may be related to the natural substitution of nearby Thr37 in IFIT5 for arginine (R38) in IFIT1, which possibly replaces the Gln41 interaction with the 5\u2032-triphosphate group. "}
