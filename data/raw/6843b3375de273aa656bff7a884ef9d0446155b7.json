{"title": "", "body": "T he following recommended practices were developed by the AORN Recommended Practices Committee and have been approved by the AORN Board of Directors. They were presented as proposed recommended practices for comments by members and others. They are effective January 1, 2007. These recommended practices are intended as achievable recommendations representing what is believed to be an optimal level of practice. Policies and procedures will reflect variations in practice settings and/or clinical situations that determine the degree to which the recommended practices can be implemented.\n\nAORN recognizes the numerous types of settings in which perioperative nurses practice. These recommended practices are intended as guidelines adaptable to various practice settings. These practice settings include traditional operating rooms, ambulatory surgery centers, physicians' offices, cardiac catheterization suites, endoscopy suites, radiology departments, and all other areas where operative and other invasive procedures may be performed.\n\nPURPOSE. The rapidly changing health care environment presents health care workers with continuing challenges in the form of newly recognized pathogens and well known microorganisms that have become more resistant to today's therapeutic modalities. Protecting patients and safeguarding health care workers from potentially infectious agent transmission continues to be a primary focus of perioperative registered nurses.\n\nHealth care workers should use standard precautions when caring for all patients in the perioperative setting. 1 . Standard precautions should be applied across all aspects of health care delivery. 1 Any individual (eg, patient, family member, significant other, visitor, or health care provider) may be transiently or chronically colonized with pathogenic microorganisms\n\nand may be asymptomatic, display active infection, or be in the incubation period of the infectious disease. 1 2. Additional precautions may be needed for specific organisms encountered, but at a minimum, standard precautions should be used for all surgical patients.\n\n\u2022 Standard precautions apply to exposure or the potential for exposure to blood and all body fluids, secretions, and excretions (except perspiration) whether or not they contain visible blood; nonintact skin; and mucous membranes. Standard precautions are designed to protect patients and health care workers from contact with recognized and unrecognized sources of infectious agents. 1 \u2022 Infectious agents can be transmitted via direct and indirect contact, respiratory droplets, and airborne aerosols.\n\n3. Exposure to potentially infectious agents should be minimized by the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) (eg, gloves, gowns, aprons), work practices, engineering controls, and other measures tailored to the specific work environment. 2\n\nHand hygiene should be performed before and after each patient contact. 1. All personnel should practice general hand hygiene. Prompt and frequent hand antisepsis is the single most important measure to reduce the spread of microorganisms. [1] [2] [3] Hand hygiene should be performed \u2022 at the beginning of a work shift, \u2022 before and after patient contact, \u2022 after removing gloves, \u2022 before and after eating, \u2022 before and after using the restroom, \u2022 any time there is a possibility that there has \u2022 any time when hands may have been soiled or any time the practitioner believes his or her hands may have been soiled.\n\n2. An appropriate alcohol-based hand antiseptic agent should be available in convenient locations (eg, wall, bedside). 3 Frequency of health care providers' hand hygiene can be increased by convenient access to hand wash sinks or hand sanitation stations. 4\n\nProtective barriers must be used to reduce the risk of skin and mucous membrane exposure to potentially infectious materials. Personal protective barriers are required when it can be reasonably anticipated that a health care worker will be exposed to blood and body fluids or other potentially infectious materials. 2 1. Gloves selected for use should provide an effective barrier against infectious materials (eg, blood, body fluids) and any anticipated chemicals to which the gloves may come in contact. Some chemicals may cause the breakdown of the glove material.\n\n2. Use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or vinyl gloves should be limited to brief, low-risk exposures. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Research has shown that PVC and vinyl gloves have a high failure rate in use.\n\n3. Users should refer to the glove manufacturer's written instructions for use with chemicals (eg, glutaraldehyde, peracetic acid, methyl methacrylate). When handling glutaraldehyde solutions, gloves that are impervious to glutaraldehyde should be worn. 12 Gloves should be changed immediately following direct contact with uncured methyl methacrylate (ie, bone cement). Exposure to uncured methyl methacrylate places the wearer at risk for direct contact with and skin absorption of the methyl methacrylate because it permeates the glove material. Users should contact the specific glove manufacturer and request written reports on specific glove styles and materials for the intrin- \u2022 according to organizational policy.\n\n6. All end users should be familiar with the intended use and the limitations of each glove material. 16 Each surgical glove material has specific characteristics (eg, latex, polyisoprene, chloroprene) which affect the performance and intended use of the glove.\n\n7. Gloves should not be washed between patient contacts or uses. Research has found that pathogens are not effectively removed from gloves by washing. 4 Washing gloves is not a substitute for hand washing. \u2022 More glove perforations are detected when using a colored under-glove indicator system when compared to two pairs of standard latex gloves (P = 0.002). 17 This systematic review also included clinical trials addressing other aspects of gloving practices. These studies found the following.\n\n\u2022 Wearing two pairs of gloves (ie, doublegloving) significantly reduces the number of perforations to the innermost glove, when compared to the outer glove or single gloves. 17 \u2022 Wearing two pairs of gloves does not increase the likelihood of increased perforations to the outermost glove. 17 \u2022 Wearing one pair of standard thickness gloves on top of a pair of standard thickness colored gloves facilitates the wearer's rapid recognition of perforations to the outer glove. 17 \u2022 Wearing a single pair of orthopedic gloves (ie, thicker latex gloves) provides the same protection from perforations as does two pairs of standard latex gloves. 18 \u2022 Wearing two layers of colored gloves does not assist in recognizing breaches to the glove closest to the wearer's skin. [19] [20] [21] \u2022 Wearing a glove liner between two layers of gloves does reduce perforations to the innermost glove during orthopedic surgical procedures. 22, 23 \u2022 Wearing cloth outer gloves during orthopedic surgical procedures does decrease the number of perforations to the innermost glove when compared to doubleglove layers. 24, 25 \u2022 Wearing steel weave outer gloves during orthopedic surgery does not reduce the number of perforations to the innermost gloves when compared to double gloves. 26 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American College of Surgeons, and the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, support doublegloving during invasive procedures. [27] [28] [29] 2. Upon completion of the invasive procedure, both pairs of gloves should be discarded and hand hygiene should be performed. 3 \u2022 wearing gowns when it is anticipated that clothing will have contact with infectious patients or items in the patients' environment (eg, transporting, transferring patient to a bed/cart, positioning); 30\n\n\u2022 wearing a mask when it is anticipated that aerosolized exposure to infectious microorganisms is possible;\n\n\u2022 face protection (eg, goggles, face shield)\n\nwhen it is anticipated that splash or sneezing exposure to microorganisms is possible;\n\n\u2022 ensuring that precautions are maintained during transport; and\n\n\u2022 adequately cleaning and disinfecting patient care equipment and items before use with each patient.\n\n2. When patient transport is necessary, barriers (eg, gown, gloves) should be used to reduce the opportunity for transmission of microorganisms to other patients, personnel, and visitors and to reduce contamination of the environment. 1 3. Noncritical equipment (eg, equipment that touches intact skin) contaminated with blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions should be cleaned and disinfected after each use, according to the organization's written policy. 1 The use of dedicated patient equipment may be indicated in some situations (eg, anesthesia, post-anesthesia care unit). \n\nAirborne precautions should be used when caring for patients who are known or suspected to be infected with microorganisms that can be transmitted by the airborne route (eg, rubeola, varicella, tuberculosis [TB], and smallpox).\n\nMicroorganisms carried by airborne transmission (eg, droplet nuclei or dust particles) can be dispersed widely by air currents, remain suspended in the air for extended periods, and may become inhaled by a susceptible host within the same room or over a longer distance from the source patient. 1 \u2022 Reusable sharps must be handled, removed, and sequestered at the end of the procedure in a labeled, puncture-resistant, closed transportation container. Removable, reusable sharps should be handled using an instrument or device. 3. Health care workers should follow the organization's written policy regarding reporting potentially infectious conditions.\n\n4. Health care workers should consult with the organization's designated health care provider (ie, employee or occupational health department physician) for assessment, treatment, and limits to perioperative practice, if indicated. The organization's written guidelines should be followed with respect to the worker's ability to perform required job functions in the organization, especially in high-risk environments.\n\nPolicies and procedures that address responses to threats of intentionally released pathogens (eg, anthrax, botulism) should be written, reviewed periodically, and readily available within the practice setting.\n\n1. Health care workers should follow the organization's emergency preparedness plan as modified from published CDC guidelines for treating patients exposed to a biological agent in the event of an actual or suspected biological agent release (eg, anthrax, botulism, plague, smallpox). The CDC guidelines, available at http://www.bt.cdc.gov, outline transmission precautions for each organism and define those recommendations. The current CDC guidelines should be consulted in conjunction with the organization's infection control practitioner. 55\n\n2. Perioperative registered nurses should actively participate in the organization's emergency preparedness plan for responding to an intentionally released biological pathogen.\n\nPolicies and procedures that address responses to epidemic or pandemic pathogens (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], avian flu, influenza) should be written, reviewed periodically, and readily available within the practice setting.\n\n1. Personnel should follow the organization's infection control plan for epidemics based on published CDC guidelines for treating patients exposed to organisms considered high public health risks. The CDC outlines precautions for each organism on its Web site at http://www.cdc.gov. 55 The organization's infection control practitioner should be consulted regarding additional specific precautions in the perioperative arena.\n\n2. Perioperative registered nurses should create and maintain an optimal health environment for patients with human and avian influenza and SARS. 56 3. Perioperative registered nurses should actively participate in the organization's emergency preparedness plan for responding to an epidemic or pandemic. \n\nPolicies and procedures should be written, reviewed periodically, and readily available within the practice setting.\n\n1. Personnel should report all exposure incidents (eg, needle sticks, blood exposures), infections, or communicable disease to the health care organization according to organization policy. Prompt reporting enables employers to provide timely and confidential postexposure evaluation, intervention, testing, or appropriate prophylaxis. 2\n\n2. An introduction and review of policies and procedures for infection prevention, exposure mitigation, and emergency response plans should be included in orientation and ongoing education of personnel to assist in the development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that affect safety and surgical outcomes. Policies and procedures also assist in the development of quality assessment and improvement activities.\n\n3. The uniform perioperative nursing vocabulary should be used to document patient care related to prevention of transmissible infections on the intraoperative patient record. The perioperative nursing vocabulary is a clinically relevant and empirically validated standardized nursing language. This standardized language consists of the Perioperative Nursing Data Set and includes perioperative nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes. The expected outcome of primary import to this recommended practice document is Outcome 10 (O10), \"The patient is free of signs and symptoms of infection.\" This outcome falls within the domain of Physiologic Responses (D2). The associated nursing diagnosis is (X28): \"Risk for infection.\" The associated interventions that may lead to the desired outcome include (I98) \"Protects from cross-contamination.\" 57 4. Information about adverse events and near misses should be collected, analyzed, and used for performance improvement as part of the institution-wide performance improvement program. To evaluate the quality of patient care and to formulate plans for corrective action, it is necessary to maintain a system of evaluation.\n\n5. Organizational policies and procedures that address occupational exposure to pathogens must be consistent with federal, state, and local rules and regulations that govern occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens.\n\n6. These recommended practices should be used as guidelines for developing policies and procedures within the practice setting. Policies and procedures establish authority, responsibility, and accountability, and serve as operational guidelines.\n\nPrecautions that reduce the risk of an airborne transmission of infectious airborne droplet nuclei (ie, small particle residue 5 microns or smaller). Airborne transmission refers to contact with infectious airborne droplet nuclei that can remain suspended in the air for extended periods of time or infectious dust particles that can be circulated by air currents.\n\nANTHRAX: An acute infectious disease caused by Bacillus anthracis. Exposure (ie, skin contact, ingestion, or inhalation) to Bacillus anthracis spores from infected animals or animal products can produce infection in humans. Routes of exposure include pulmonary (eg, bioterrorism threat through aerosolization of spores), cutaneous, or gastrointestinal. Person-to-person transmission is not known to occur with inhalation or gastrointestinal anthrax route of exposure.\n\nBOTULISM: An acute infectious disease caused by Clostridium botulinum. Exposure can occur through contaminated food or aerosolization (ie, inhalation) of Clostridium botulinum spores. Person-to-person transmission is not known to occur.\n\nCOLONIZED: The presence of microorganisms that reproduce on tissue without invading tissue or causing disease or infections.\n\nCONTACT PRECAUTIONS: Precautions designed to reduce the risk of transmission of epidemiologically important microorganisms by direct or indirect contact.\n\nDIRECT CONTACT: Person-to-person contact resulting in physical transfer of infectious microorganisms between an infected or colonized person and a susceptible host.\n\nDROPLET PRECAUTIONS: Precautions that reduce the risk of large particle droplet (ie, 5 microns or larger) transmission of infectious agents.\n\nDROPLET TRANSMISSION: The transfer of infectious microorganisms by contact with conjunctival, nasal, or oral mucosa droplets (eg, coughing, sneezing, talking, suctioning). Viral particles can be acquired from environmental surfaces and transmitted to mucous membranes.\n\nEXAM GLOVE: Intended for short duration use, size specific (eg, small, medium, large), can be either nonsterile or can be made sterile by the manufacturer, provided in pairs or singles, made from several materials (eg, latex, PVC, nitrile, chloroprene), but are not intended for invasive surgical procedures because of their lower acceptable quality limit (AQL).\n\nExposure via specific eye, mouth, or other mucous membranes; nonintact skin; or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that results from the performance of an employee's duties.\n\nINDIRECT CONTACT: Contact of a susceptible host to a contaminated object (eg, instruments, bed rails, linens, equipment).\n\nThe surgical entry into tissues, cavities, or organs or repair of major traumatic injuries.\n\nBacteria that may be resistant to one or more antibiotics (eg, MRSA, VRE).\n\nA safe work practice control technique used to ensure that the surgeon and scrubbed person do not touch the same sharp instrument at the same time. This technique is accomplished by establishing a designated neutral zone on the sterile field and placing sharp items within the zone for transfer of the item between scrubbed personnel. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT: Protective equipment (eg, masks, gloves, fluid-resistant gowns, goggles, face shields) for eyes, face, head, and extremities; protective clothing; respiratory devices; and protective shields and barriers designed to protect the wearer from injury. Used wherever it is necessary by reason of hazards of processes or environment, chemical hazards, radiological hazards, or mechanical irritants encountered in a manner capable of causing injury or impairment in the function of any part of the body through absorption, inhalation, or physical contact.\n\nPERSONNEL: Paid or unpaid health care workers, students, volunteers, physicians, and others who may have direct patient contact or opportunity for exposure to patients or devices, supplies, or equipment used for patients.\n\nPLAGUE: An acute, gram-negative, bacterial disease caused by Yesinia pestis. Bubonic and septicemic plague transmission is primarily from infected fleas, although pneumonic plague aerosolization of bacteria can result from bioterrorism-related acts. Person-to-person transmission usually occurs through large aerosol droplets of saliva during face-to-face contact (ie, coughing or sneezing).\n\nBlood; all body fluids, secretions, and excretions (except sweat), regardless of whether they contain visible blood; nonintact skin; mucous membranes; and airborne, droplet, and contact-transmitted epidemiologically important pathogens. SHARPS: Sharps include, but are not limited to, suture needles, scalpel blades, hypodermic needles, electrosurgical needles and blades, safety pins, and instruments with sharp edges or points.\n\nSMALLPOX: An acute, highly contagious viral illness caused by the variola virus. It is transmitted through airborne or droplet exposure (ie, coughing, speaking) and skin contact with skin lesions and secretions. Once exposed, the patient is contagious from the onset of rash until scabs separate (ie, approximately three weeks).\n\nSTANDARD PRECAUTIONS: The primary strategy for successful infection control and reduction of worker exposure. Precautions used for care of all patients regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infectious status. SURGICAL GLOVE: Intended for invasive surgical procedures. Size and hand specific (eg, 5\u00bd to 9, right or left). Manufactured to higher AQL for holes than exam gloves.\n\nTRANSMISSION-BASED PRECAUTIONS (ENHANCED): Second tier of precautions designed to be used with patients known or suspected to be infected or colonized with highly transmissible or epidemiologically important pathogens for which additional precautions are needed to prevent transmission in the practice setting."}
