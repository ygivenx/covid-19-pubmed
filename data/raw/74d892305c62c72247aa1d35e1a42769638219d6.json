At the 17 February 2020 , according to ECDC and CDC surveillance [2, 3] , 71,333 cases have been reported among 29 countries in five main continents, and the number of deaths was 1,775, almost all occurred in China (N=1,770, one in the Philippines, one in Hong Kong, one in France, one in Taiwan and one in Japan), with a currently reported fatality rate between 2 to 2.3% [2, 3] . In this short report, we the aimed to summarize the clinical aspects of novel betacoronavirus infection and its possible manifestations. included. Twelve studies were identified for full-text review as they contained original data.\n\nMost of the patients were males (Table 1) with ranging ages eight to 92 years-old: interestingly, in the first period of this global epidemic there were few cases in young people under fifteen-yearsold [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Nevertheless, among known infected subjects outside China prevalence of males and distribution of age, at the time of diagnosis, resemble those in Chinese epidemic [4, 6, 15] . Although past medical histories were not always available [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , hypertension was the most reported underlying condition [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] in as many as 80% and 31.2% , respectively, in the case series from Ren et al. [9] and Wang et al. [12] . Chen et al. [10] have described mostly cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (40%) in their population. Furthermore, Ren and colleagues [9] have reported underlying chronic liver disease in their whole population (N=5) and this feature differs, at least so far, from the other cases of 2019-nCoV [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .\n\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Huang et al. and Wang et al. [1, 12] have shown a rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) of about 2% and 2,9%, respectively. Subsequently Chen et al. [10] have reported a rate of about 1% of respiratory system diseases, different from an estimated COPD prevalence between 1.2-8.9% in different regions of China [16] . Moreover, interstitial lung diseases, history of smoking, bronchiectasis or asthma were underreported [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Diabetes was firstly mentioned by Huang and colleagues [9] and represented the main comorbidity in their cohort (8; 20%) and afterwards other Authors [11] [12] reported diabetes in about 10% of subjects. Furthermore, among cases outside Asia, Holshue et al. [4] have mentioned hypertriglyceridemia as the sole chronic illness of the first U.S. case of 2019-nCoV; on the other hand, German cases [6] were overall healthy.\n\nPatients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection mostly had respiratory signs and symptoms [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .\n\nFever was reported in all the case series available, flanked by cough, mostly dry (Table 1) . Dyspnea is not uncommon and it was reported in the whole cohort by Ren et al. (N=5, 100%) [9] . A significant proportion of patients have complained gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, also appearing during the course of illness, a distinct feature [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] : Holshue and colleagues [4] meticulously described the evolution of the first American case, complaining firstly respiratory symptoms (i.e., dry cough) followed by abdominal discomfort and self-limiting nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. There were myalgias or fatigue in 44-60% of Asiatic case series [1, 9] .\n\nMultiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In the 41 patients case series reported by Huang et al., [1] all had a plain chest x-ray (CXR) or computed tomography findings of pneumonia. Although CT is the best method to define extension and typology of lung parenchyma involvement, a CXR was mostly employed as a first investigation, probably because of the associated need to comply with infection control procedures [5] .\n\nLeukopenia was the most common abnormality [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , reported in up to 63% of subjects in Huang et al. study [1] . Thrombocytopenia occurred in the reports by Holshue and Chen [4, 10] , but it is rarely J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reported in other series [1, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , although low platelets counts were found in up to 45% of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections [17] [18] . Nevertheless, abnormalities in hepatic (e.g., slightly increase in AST and ALT levels) and muscle enzymes (e.g., slightly increase in creatine-kinase or lactate-dehydrogenase) were seen in early cases and later reported (Table 1 ) [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . As one could expect, C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were frequently abnormal and, on the contrary, most of the patients had normal procalcitonin (PCT) levels at admission: in Huang et al. cohort up to 69% of patients had a PCT level <0\u00b71 ng/mL [1] . Interestingly in Wang et al. [12] case series a prolonged prothrombin time has been reported in about 58% of adults.\n\nIn one of the larger cohort available, with 41 patients by Huang et al. [1] , four (10%) had a superinfection and the risk increased with the intensity of the care (ICU care 31% Vs. no ICU care 0%, P=0.0014), with almost all patients being treated with an empirical antibiotic coverage during acute phase. Furthermore, the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, with or without specific bacterial superinfection, has complicated the clinical course of up to 29% of patients (12) [1] . In the same large cohort by Huang et al. [1] in up to 12% occurred an increase in troponin I count, and five patients have complained an acute cardiac injury: this finding requires further study to assess the heart tropism of 2019-nCoV and cardiovascular risk of infected patients during acute illness.\n\nChen et al. reported a low rate (4%) of fungal isolates with the clinical need of empirical antifungal treatment, with one case of Candida glabrata, three cases of C. albicans and one case, more important, of Aspergillus flavus isolation [10] . Moreover, authors [10] reported a lower rate of bacterial respiratoryisolates, mostly Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae; according to thatmicrobiological data are poorer to represent all the COVID-19 infected population, and followup time reported in literature is shorter to define the real burden of post-viral infectious complication.\n\nThe first wave of 2019-CoV has caused 1775 deaths, despite the severity of illness was mild in most of the cases [1, 4-9, 12, 14-15] . Wang and colleagues [19] have interestingly reviewed underlying diseases, and demographic characteristics of deaths occurred in the Wuhan epidemic and have found that older adults (>70-years-old) have presented a shorter period between first symptom and death [11.5 (range 6-19) days Vs. 20 (range 10-41); P=0.033] as compared to younger persons, as previously reported for other beta-coronavirus [17] [18] : this confirms the increased severity in the elderly for CoV illness [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Furthermore, according to Wang and colleagues [19] , 2019-CoV has developed a median period between symptomatic phase to death (median days 14) somewhat J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f similar to MERS-CoV (median days 14) and SARS-CoV (median days 17.4) of MERS [12, [17] [18] ( Table 2 ).\n\nWe are daily assessing the real extent of 2019-CoV epidemic and the scientific turmoil that was trying to keep up. We have learned, at least scientifically, the lesson from previously epidemics of severe "}
