{"title": "Title: Risk of disease spillover from dogs to wild carnivores in Kanha Tiger Reserve, India. Running head: Disease spillover from dogs to carnivores", "body": "approximately 150 villages in the buffer zone (1,134 km 2 ), where regulated human activities are 25 allowed, and eight villages in the core zone ('core') (940 km 2 ), where stricter regulations on 26 human activity are implemented. All these villages support dog populations (DeFries, Karanth & 27 Pareeth, 2010) . In India, dogs near protected areas threaten wild animals through predation and 28 competition (Home, Bhatnagar & Vanak, 2017) ; and may serve as reservoirs of pathogens that 29 threaten wild carnivores. Majority of dogs in KTR are semi-owned and associate with household 30 but are unrestrained. A few are owned and restrained, and the rest are feral. No village dogs were 31 vaccinated (V. C. pers. comm. with park authorities and owners) so they pose a potential disease 32 spillover risk to carnivores. 33\n\nCarnivores in KTR frequent the villages to prey on dogs (Karanth et al., 2013) and 34 livestock (Miller et al., 2015) , while dogs enter the core with or without their owners. As a 35 result, these animals can interact directly through scavenging on carcasses or predation or, 36 indirectly through scats or spray marks; in ways that can transmit pathogens. We predict that 37 these interactions will be more frequent in villages that are closer to the core (as in Chile) (Torres 38 & Prado, 2010) or that are larger since they may support more dogs. Finally, as some pathogens 39 have common routes of transmission or suppress the immune response, we predict that there will 40 be elevated rates of co-exposure, amplifying the threat (Griffiths et al., 2011) . We conducted 41 6 contact rate with wild carnivores. We randomly selected five villages with centers < 2 km from 70 the core boundary (henceforth 'near') and four villages (summer), and then five (winter) with 71 centers > 6 km from the core boundary ('far') ( Fig. 1) . All villages were sampled in both 72 seasons except one near village that was replaced in winter and one far village that was added in 73 winter (Table 2) . After establishing the active periods for dogs (6:00-9:00 AM & 5:00-6:30 PM 74 in summer; 7:00-9:00 AM & 4:00-5:30 PM in winter), we conducted non-invasive photographic 75 surveys of dogs using a Nikon D3000 digital camera and 80-200 mm lens, on a motorcycle at < 76 20 km/h on roads and on foot in alleys. We noted individual dog's sex (males by descended 77 testicles), age category (juveniles < 1 year or adults by asking the owners and/or estimation), and 78 coat patterns. Each survey was conducted over two consecutive days (a \"mark\" and \"recapture\" 79 in each village) in summer and three consecutive days (a \"mark\" and two morning and two 80 afternoon \"recaptures\") in winter. We measured the area of each village by tracking its villages that were sampled in summer and winter; the inset shows the location of KTR in India. 88 We collected blood samples from dogs in all surveyed villages to estimate the 89 seroprevalence of rabies, CPV, CDV, and CAV. In summer, we collected blood 90 opportunistically from 67 dogs (42 males and 25 females). In winter, we collected blood from 91 five male and five female adults and four male and four female juveniles from each village, 92 except for three near and two far villages where we could only capture three males and three 93 female juveniles. 35 dogs were sampled in both seasons. Dogs less than four months of age 94\n\nwere excluded to rule out presence of maternal antibodies (Greene, 1994 seronegative (S0) and seropositive (S1and above; specifically, S1 & S2 = 'low titers', S3 = 115 'medium titers' and S4+ = 'high titers'). All samples seropositive for CPV and CDV were tested 116 for the viral nucleic acid using PCR, along with positive controls. We did not test samples 117 seropositive for CAV for the virus as we lacked a positive control. The methods for DNA and 118 RNA extraction and PCR analyses are described in Supporting Information S1. 119\n\nWe opportunistically recorded signs of carnivores (direct sightings, photographs, scats 121 and, footprints) in surveyed villages as 'encounters' over 60 day periods in both seasons. 122\n\nNaturalists from KTR confirmed the identifications based on scats. On five occasions, we had 123 permission from the KTR Forest Department to install camera traps (Capture IR, 5 MP camera, 124\n\nCuddeback, Greenbay, WI, USA, 54115) near carcasses of livestock killed by tigers. We 125 recorded the geographical location of each carnivore encounter and collected only once from 126 each location to avoid duplication. This method provides a minimum estimate of the contact rate, 127 since many carnivores are nocturnal and can enter villages undetected.

Since, the dogs are territorial (Pal, 2003) and our surveys were conducted over 132 two or three consecutive days in each village, we assumed the individual populations were 133 closed during survey. Also, since we used non-invasive means to identify dogs, we assumed 134 there was no loss of marks and no change in behavior following the first \"capture\". Using 135 CAPTURE, we compared four models that differ in their assumptions of capture probability: that We used Fisher's two-tailed exact test to examine the relation between seroprevalence of 148 each pathogen and sex and age category of the dogs, and also to test non-random patterns of co-149 exposure. We tested for the difference in seroprevalence for near and far villages (only for 150 winter). We calculated odds ratio (OR) for all significant relationships, which tells the likelihood 151 of seroprevalence given the presence or absence of other conditions, here, the sex and age class 152 of the dogs, and the presence of other pathogens. All analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS 153 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Juveniles 178 constituted 23% and 28.5% of the population in near and far villages respectively in summer 179 rising to 36.1% and 34% in winter (Fig. 2c) . None of these differences, in the number of females 180 or juveniles by proximity to the core or by season, was statistically significant. In the eight 181 villages surveyed in both seasons, 84 of the 155 dogs photographed and identified in summer 182 were still detected in winter (54.2 %). 58% of these 84 dogs were from near villages and 42% 183\n\nwere from far villages. The recapture rate was lower for females (32% of 84) and juveniles (40% 184 of 84 recaptures) which were classified as adults in winter. 185 186 187\n\nThe seroprevalence of CPV, CDV and CAV were all high in summer and declined in 188 winter: CPV decreased from 83.6% to 68.4%, CDV decreased from 50.7% to 30.4% and CAV 189 decreased from 41.8% to 30.9%. There was no significant effect of age or sex to the 190 seroprevalence in all villages in summer (Table 3 ) and in near villages in winter (Table 4) . 191\n\nHowever, in far villages in winter, adults were more likely to be seropositive than juveniles for 192 CPV (P = 0.003), CDV (P = 0.003) and CAV (P = 0.01) ( Table 4 ). The proportion of the dogs 193 with antibody titers of S4+, S3 and S1 varied with the pathogen (Supporting Information S4). 194\n\nDogs that tested positive for CPV antibodies were most often in the high range (S4+) in both 195\n\nseasons, whereas dogs that tested positive for CDV and CAV were predominantly in the 196 moderate range (S3) in both seasons except for dogs in near villages that were more often S4+ in 197 greater proportion as compared to far villages in winter (Supporting Information S5). 198\n\nIn winter, dogs that were seropositive for any one pathogen were more likely to be 199 seropositive for one or both of the others (Table 5 ). This trend was statistically significant in far 200 .

In the far villages, 201 dogs that were seropositive for any combination of two out of three viruses was more likely to be 202 positive for third one. For example, if a sample tested seropositive for CPV and CDV, it is 13.72 203 times more likely to be seropositive for CAV (P = 0.001, OR = 13.72). 204\n\nOf the 35 dogs that were surveyed and sampled in both seasons, all 19 dogs that were 205 seropositive for CPV in summer remained so in winter, while 7 more (43.7% of 16) became 206 seropositive by then. Similarly, all 13 dogs that were seropositive for CDV in summer remained 207 so in winter, and three more showed positive seroconversions (13% of 22). For CAV, of nine 208 dogs that were seropositive in summer, one showed negative seroconversion (11.1%) while one 209 of the others showed a positive seroconversion (3.9%) by winter. Results of the RT-PCR tests, 210 indicated active CDV infection for a two-year-old female and a six-year-old male and active 211 CPV infection in an eight-month old male dog (Supporting Information S1). 212\n\nWe had direct and camera trap sightings of wild carnivores within the villages, as well as 213 a variety of indirect records including calls, footprints and scats (Table 6 ). There were more such 214 records in near villages (16 summer, 18 winter) than in far villages (6 summer, 4 winter). 215\n\nThe potential of disease spillover from dogs to carnivores in KTR is significant as dogs 217 are present in large numbers, are exposed to infectious viruses, and come in direct or indirect 218 contact with carnivores. The average number of dogs in KTR villages that were sampled in both 219 seasons, was 21 in summer and 17 in winter in case of near villages, and in the far villages there 220 were 29 dogs in summer and 27 dogs in winter. The seroprevalence of CPV, CDV, and CAV 221 represents the proportion of the population that were exposed to those viruses at some point and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Rabies transmission from dogs therefore likely poses a serious 248 threat to carnivores in India but was not detected in our study because it is highly and quickly 249 lethal (Tepsumethanon et al., 2004) . However, most dogs had been exposed to CPV (83.6% particular are bigger threat as they are more prone to suffer from high mortality, malnutrition, 307 and disease (Sowemimo, 2009 ). Very few dogs photographed in summer were re-sighted in 308 winter in our survey, possibly due to high mortality of these dogs. Our study does not 309 incorporate any seroprevalence data from feral dogs, which may be higher along with the 310 associated mortality. Feral dogs may have more frequent contact with carnivores making them a 311 greater unknown threat. 312\n\nFragmentation of carnivore habitats due to anthropogenic activities leads to intense 313 interactions between humans, domestic carnivores and wild carnivores (Thorne & Williams, 314 .

These interactions can lead to disease spillover and the risks of infection 315 which can be amplified by environmental stressors like drought, existing infection, prey 316 depletion (Evermann, Roelke & Briggs, 1986 ) and climate change (Munson et al., 2008) . Canine 317 diseases like rabies are public health concern as well ( Sudarshan et al., 2007 , Sakai et al., 2013 . .
