{"title": "Human respiratory coronavirus HKU1 versus other coronavirus infections in Italian hospitalised patients", "body": "Following the first reports in the 1960s, human coronaviruses (hCoVs) 229E and OC43 were found to circulate at a high rate in several seroepidemiological studies (McIntosh et al., 1970) . However, difficulties encountered in virus isolation and recovery from cell cultures hampered medical investigations of these viruses until the recent identification of the etiologic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (hCoV-SARS) in 2003 (Peiris et al., 2003) . In recent years, the development of molecular techniques prompted the resumption of clinical studies aimed at identifying the role of group I (229E-like) and group II (OC43-like) hCoVs in respiratory syndromes. The new technological tools allowed the recent discovery of two new hCoVs: one, referred to as NL63, belongs to group I and is distantly related to 229E (Fouchier et al., 2004; Van der Hoek et al., 2004) , and the second, referred to as HKU1, is more closely related to the group II prototype hCoV-OC43 (Woo et al., 2005a) . HCoV-HKU1 was first detected in two patients with pneumonia in Hong-Kong (Woo et al., 2005a) , and then reported elsewhere (Esper et al., 2006; Garbino et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006; Vabret et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2005b) . In addition, a number of studies from different countries have shown that hCoV-NL63 can be recovered from respiratory secretions of both immunocompetent children and immunocompromised adults (Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005; Boivin et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Gerna et al., 2006a; Mo\u00ebs et al., 2005) .\n\nIn Italy, hCoVs 229E, OC43, and NL63 have been shown to circulate both in the past and present time (Gerna et al., 1978 (Gerna et al., , 1980 (Gerna et al., , 2006a . However, the HKU1 epidemiological and clinical aspects have never been investigated either alone or with respect to the other hCoV groups.\n\nFrom 1 November 2005 through 31 May 2006, 555 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and 130 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected prospectively from 426 (283 pediatric and 143 adult) patients admitted to hospital with an episode of acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI). Respiratory secretions were processed and aliquoted as previously reported (Sarasini et al., 2006) . NPAs were examined for influenzavirus types A and B, parainfluenzavirus types 1-4, human respiratory syncytial virus, and human adenoviruses by both direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining and culture. In addition, human metapneumoviruses were detected by both MAbs (DFA and culture) and RT-PCR as previously reported (Gerna et al., 2006b; Percivalle et al., 2005) . Furthermore, all four hCoVs were tested for by RT-PCR, while 229E and HKU1 strains were tested for in parallel by in-house developed MAbs, as detailed below.\n\nDFA staining was applied to slides containing cells from either NPAs or cell cultures (48 h, p.i.), as reported (Gerna et al., 2006a; Rovida et al., 2005) . In addition, in-house developed MAbs were used for identification of: (i) human metapneumovirus group and type (Gerna et al., 2006b; Percivalle et al., 2005) ; (ii) hCoV 229E strains (Gerna et al., 2006a) ; (iii) hCoV HKU1 strains. A HKU1-specific MAb was recently developed in our laboratory, and shown not to be cross-reactive with OC43-like strains or other hCoVs or respiratory viruses. In this study, it was used retrospectively for DFA detection of HKU1 strains in cell smears from NPAs. In addition, a commercially available MAb anti-OC43 (Chemicon), already shown to be poorly reactive with OC43-like strains (Gerna et al., 2006a) , was used for DFA staining.\n\nThe following cell cultures were inoculated with NPAs: primary monkey kidney, Vero, mixtures of A549 and Mv1Lu (Huang and Turchek, 2000) , LLC-MK2, MDCK, HRT-18, and HuH7 (Nakabayashi et al., 1982) .\n\nNPAs were tested for HKU1 by using: (i) a primer set proposed by Woo et al. (2005b) , and relevant to gene N (nt 29163-29678); (ii) a primer set derived from the primer pair PanCoV-05 (Mo\u00ebs et al., 2005) and relevant to gene 1ab, which was used for both result confirmation and phylogenetic analysis, as follows: HKU1-1ab for, 5 -ACTCAAATGAATTTAAAATATGC-3 ; HKU1-1ab rev, 5 -TCACATTTAGGATAATCCCA-3 (nt 15142-15392). In addition, hCoVs 229E, NL63, and OC43 were sought by using three sets of virus-specific primers relevant to gene 1ab, used for both virus detection and phylogenetic analysis, as reported (Gerna et al., 2006a) . Finally, RT-PCR assays for conventional respiratory viruses were developed to detect at least 10 input plasmid copies, as previously reported (Sarasini et al., 2006) .\n\nThe 250 nt-long fragments of genes 1ab of hCoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, following amplification with specific primers, were sequenced using the ABI PRISM 3100 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Viral sequences of different hCoV strains as well as reference strains were aligned with the ClustalW program version 1.6. The Phylips Megaversion 3.1 (njplot) program was used to construct phylogenetic trees with nucleotide sequences by means of the neighbor-joining method from the same distance matrices. Bootstrap support was determined by 100 resamplings of sequences.\n\nComparison of the distribution frequencies was performed with the Pearson's Chi square test.\n\nDuring the winter-spring season 2005-2006, 426 patients were admitted to the hospital with an ARTI episode. Of these, 48 (11.3%) had one or two episodes of hCoV infection for a total of 52 ARTI episodes during the entire season. HKU1 was associated with 10 ARTI episodes involving 10 patients, 6 presenting as a single infection and 4 as a coinfection. Other respiratory infections were associated with 229E in 21 episodes (10 infections and 11 coinfections), NL63 in 13 episodes (6 infections and 7 coinfections), hCoV OC43 in eight episodes (4 infections and 4 coinfections) (Table 1) . Overall, numbers of single infection (n = 26) and coinfection (n = 26) episodes were identical.\n\nDiagnosis of HKU1 infections was performed prospectively using RT-PCR, and retrospectively (whenever back-up smears were available) by MAb staining. Of 15 NPAs found FluA + Rhino (n = 1) hPIV (n = 2) Rhino (n = 1) Rhino (n = 1) Rhino (n = 2) hRSV (n = 2) hRSV (n = 3) hMPV-B (n = 1) FluA (n = 1) Rhino (n = 1) hMPV-B (n = 1) Rhino + hPIV3 (n = 1) Rhino + AdV (n = 1) hPIV + Rhino (n = 1) HCMV (n = 4) DFA, direct fluorescent antibody; SVC, shell-vial culture; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; Rhino, rhinovirus; hMPV-B, human metapneumovirus B; hPIV, human parainfluenzavirus; Flu A, influenzavirus type A; hRSV, human respiratory syncytial virus; AdV, adenovirus; ND, not done. a One patient had an HKU1 infection and NL63 coinfection within 30 days from each other.\n\nto be positive by RT-PCR, 10 were available as back-up cell smears for MAb staining. Eight of these (80%) were detected as positive by MAb. Two staining patterns were observed: one involved large syncytial formations patchy stained on the cell membrane, the other apparently interested the cytoplasm of singly infected cells (Fig. 1 ). In addition, repeated attempts to isolate HKU1 from HKU1-positive NPAs in different types of cell cultures were unsuccessful. Interestingly, in an immunocompromised child (a 12-yearold boy with severe combined immune deficiency syndrome) NL63 in association with parainfluenzavirus and rhinovirus infections was followed by a HKU1 infection within one month. The longest duration of virus excretion observed in this study was 38 days in a 3-year-old child undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and 25 days in a 1year-old infant, who resolved HKU1 infection 5 days after admission.\n\nThe diagnosis of the other hCoV infections was usually based on RT-PCR (Table 1) . However, diagnosis of 229E infections was done by both DFA in 11/14 samples (78.6%) and shell vial cultures (SVC) in 7/21 (33.3%) samples, using in house developed MAbs, while RT-PCR detected 229E in 13/21 (61.9%) samples.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2 , based on the comparison of a fragment of 250 nucleotides of the ORF 1ab, HKU1 strains circulating in the winter-spring season in 2005-2006 in northern Italy belonged to either genotype A or B (range of genetic distance between the two subtypes 5-6%).\n\nHKU1 infections were detected during the period, January through May 2006 (Fig. 3) . As shown in Table 2 , among the 10 HKU1-infected patients, 5 were children (one immunocompromised), and 5 were adults (all five immunocompromised). Overall, if the other hCoVs were considered (Table 3) , 3/30 (10%) hCoV-infected children, and as many as 18/19 (94.7%) hCoV-infected adults were immunocompromised (p < 0.01). \n\nClinical symptoms Fever \n\nAs reported in Table 2 , in HKU1-infected patients the number of upper episodes greatly exceeded that of lower ARTI episodes (80% versus 20%). On the contrary, in OC43- infected patients, lower ARTI episodes were predominant (88% versus 12%) (Fig. 4) . This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.04). On the other hand, the incidence of upper and lower ARTI episodes in patients infected by 229E and NL63 was comparable. In HKU1-infected patients the most common clinical symptoms were rhinorrhea (90%), followed by sore throat (30%) and fever (30%). No difference in the spectrum of clinical symptoms was observed between patients infected by HKU1 genotype A or B. Similarly, coinfections were associated with either genotype. For the other hCoV infections, the predominant clinical symptoms are reported in Table 3 .\n\nResults of the present study indicate that hCoV HKU1 has been circulating among hospitalised patients in northern Italy during the winter-spring season 2005-2006 along with the other three known hCoVs. Thus, following initial and subsequent reports from Hong Kong (Lau et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2005a,b) , HKU1 has been shown to circulate in several countries on different continents, such as Australia (Sloots et al., 2006) , Switzerland (Garbino et al., 2006) , France (Vabret et al., 2006) , United States (Esper et al., 2006) and, now, Italy. The two recently discovered hCoVs, NL63 (Fouchier et al., 2004; Van der Hoek et al., 2004) , belonging to group I, and HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005a) , belonging to group II, along with the widespread use of molecular techniques allowing detection of conventional respiratory hCoVs 229E and OC43 (McIntosh et al., 1970) , have contributed to the consistent increase in detection of hCoV-positive respiratory specimens. In this study, more than 10% of positive respiratory samples were due to hCoV infections. HKU1 infection interested mostly immunocompetent infants and young children, as well as immunocompromised adult patients.\n\nThe development of RT-PCR techniques has been critical for rapid detection of hCoV as well as other respiratory viruses in clinical samples. However, in parallel, MAbs have been developed for the rapid diagnosis of respiratory viral infections. In this study, we report results obtained with the first HKU1-specific MAb developed. The high specificity of the HKU1-specific MAb was shown by negative DFA results obtained in a large series of NPA smears positive for other respiratory viruses, including OC43, 229E and NL63, while the level of sensitivity appears promising for diagnosis of HKU1 infections. Similarly, a pool of three different 229E-specific MAbs for the prospective diagnosis of 229E infections appeared to be a valuable alternative to RT-PCR.\n\nTwo genotypes of HKU1 (A and B) have been reported (Lau et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2005b) . Correlation between HKU1 genotype and clinical syndrome or clinical symptoms was neither observed in our study, nor in previous studies. However, from a clinical standpoint, a major finding emerging from our study is that, within group II hCoVs, HKU1-infected patients suffered mostly from upper ARTI, while OC43-infected patients were mostly affected by lower ARTI episodes. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.04), and was not observed between the two members of group I hCoVs. Neither bronchiolitis nor pneumonia were detected in our series of HKU1-infected patients. Following the initial report describing the association of HKU1 infection with pneumonia in two adult patients, an epidemiological and clinical study extended to the entire patient population in Hong Kong reported a predominance of upper ARTI, in agreement with the present study (Woo et al., 2005b) .\n\nIn conclusion, HKU1 was circulating in the winter-spring season in northern Italy among hospitalised immunocompetent children and immunocompromised adult patients. Diagnosis was performed by RT-PCR, but MAb appeared to be a promising complement or alternative to RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis showed that genotypes A and B co-circulate. As with other hCoVs, the simultaneous presence in NPAs of other respiratory viruses in association with HKU1 was a frequent event. HKU1 infections were by far predominantly associated with upper respiratory tract syndromes, and the most common symptom was rhinorrhea. No association with bronchiolitis or pneumonia was observed."}
