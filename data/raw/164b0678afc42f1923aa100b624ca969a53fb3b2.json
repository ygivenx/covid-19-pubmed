{"title": "Forecasting the Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemics using a simple (simplistic) model", "body": "Recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus (designated 2019-nCoV) originated in Wuhan, China raised serious public health concerns and many human tragedies. To manage the epidemics resulting from virus spreading across China and other countries forecasting the occurrence of future cases is extremely important. Such forecasting is very complicated and uncertain since many factors are poorly understood or estimated with a large possible error. Two major factors include spatial movement of virus carriers (i.e., infected individuals) and the basic reproduction number R0 (average number of new infections originated from an infected individual).\n\nAs a result of great public attention to the virus spreading several approaches were recently reported attempting to model the epidemics and infection dynamics (Chen et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 //doi.org/10. .02.04.20020461 doi: medRxiv preprint et al., 2020 Liu et al., 2020; Shen, Peng, Xiao, & Zhang, 2020; Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020; Zhang & Wang, 2020b; Zhao et al., 2020a) . These models are certainly useful to understand the implications of various quarantine procedures, public health actions, and possible virus modifications. However, the reported models are, by its nature, very complicated with numerous assumptions and requiring many parameters values of which are not known with good accuracy. As a result, some predictions (Nishiura et al., 2020) were more educated guesses although eventually they were confirmed qualitatively.\n\nIn this work, we present the results of fitting a very simple (perhaps even simplistic) model to the available data and a forecast of new infections.\n\nThe logistic model has been used in population dynamics and specifically in epidemics for a long time (Bailey, 1950; Bangert, Molyneux, Lindsay, Fitzpatrick, & Engels, 2017; Cockburn, 1960; Jowett, Browning, & Haning, 1974; Koopman, 2004; Mansfield & Hensley, 1960; Waggoner & Aylor, 2000) . Mathematically, the model describes dynamic evolution of a population P (in our case the number of infected individuals) being controlled by the growth rate r and population capacity K due to limiting resources. In continuous time t the change of P is\n\nInitially, the growth of P is close to exponential since the term (1 \u2212 \u2044 ) is almost one. When P becomes larger (commensurate with K) the growth rate slows down with = (1 \u2212 ) (2) becoming an effective instantaneous growth rate.\n\nIn discrete time, more appropriate to daily reported infection cases, the logistic model becomes\n\nwhere P(t) and P(t+1) are populations on consecutive days, R0 * is the growth rate (basic reproduction number in epidemiology) at the beginning of the logistic growth, and K is the limiting population. When plotted as a function of time t, both Eqs. (1) and (3) result in a classic sigmoidal curve with\n\nbeing the effective reproduction rate at time t.\n\nThe logistic model may be adequate for the analysis of mainland China since the country can be treated as a unit where a vast majority of cases occurred without any significant \"import\" or \"export\" of cases.\n\n.

As of the time of writing the number of cases is shown in Table 1 . The data are also plotted in Figure 1 . The first column in Table 1 represents days from the beginning of the outbreak. There is a considerable controversy as to the exact date of the outbreak with most reports pointing to mid-December (Li et al., 2020; Wang, Horby, Hayden, & Gao, 2020) while one analysis suggest multiple sources of original infection (Nishiura et al., 2020) . Initially, the outbreak was not recognized and number of confirmed cases is not fully known (P. Wu et al., 2020) . Initially, (Figure 1 ), the number of cases increased exponentially. This feature was also clearly recognized in a previous report (Zhao et al., 2020b) . (1), (2), (3) -ends of Periods 1, 2, and 3. Data beyond Feb. 6 were not used in model fitting and predictions .

This decline of the growth rate is clearly demonstrated by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number Re (fourth column in Table 1 ) calculated simply as a ratio of cases on consecutive days\n\nEq. (5) also shows a linearization of the discrete logistic model (Eq. (3)) that was used to estimate the Re(t=30) = R0 * and capacity K. An example of such linearization for Period 1 is shown in Figure 2 with the initial 16 points (blue points and line in Figure 2) . The same figure also shows linearization using for Period 2 (orange points and line in Figure 2 ). For all periods the effective reproduction numbers decrease in time. As new data were reported daily, we followed with subsequent analysis in near-real time with three periods as shown in Table 2 In contrast, a simple linearization of Re in time (Figure 3) back-estimated the original basic reproduction number R0 at about 2.4 to 2.5, agreeing well with other values recently reported Liu et al., 2020; Majumder & Mandl, 2020; Zhang & Wang, 2020a , 2020b Zhao et al., 2020a) . The discrepancy between these two estimates can be attributed a potential loss of virulence of the virus but most likely due to extreme measures to contain virus spread in China. .

We use linear regression as shown in Figure 3 to calculate the effective reproduction numbers for a series of days Re * (t) with the * superscript denoting that the values are calculated from the regression. Using Eqs. (3) and (4) the predicted values of P(t) can be calculated regressively as\n\nBased on the linearization of Eq. (5), we obtained the parameters of the logistic model for three periods as shown in Table 2 The model predicted further increases of the infected cases but slower than the initial exponential growth. As expected, new data resulted in further model refinement primarily in the values of K and the resulting maximum cases.\n\nFollowing a parallel approach and using Eq. (6) we obtained yet another set of predictions shown in together with those from Figure 4 . This approach results in a dramatically higher predictions .

This prediction is made purely based on the described analysis and may or may not happen in the future. One significant factor that could invalidate the predictions is a possibility of secondary or parallel outbreaks perhaps with different etiology as previously suggested for the original Wuhan outbreak (P.
