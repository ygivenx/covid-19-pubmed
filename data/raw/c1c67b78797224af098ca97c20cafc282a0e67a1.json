{"title": "Energy from Toxic Organic Waste for Heat and Power Generation Health Hazards of Medical Waste and its Disposal", "body": "\"Health care activities lead to the production of waste that may lead to adverse health effects. Most of this waste is not more dangerous than regular household waste. However, some types of health-care waste represent a higher risk to health. These include infectious waste (15%-25% of total health-care waste), among which are sharps waste (1%), body part waste (1%), chemical or pharmaceutical waste (3%), and radioactive and cytotoxic waste or broken thermometers (less than 1%).\"\n\nThe purpose of this document is to inform the reader about different technology options for the treatment of infectious medical waste, particularly for developing countries. It describes incerneration, chemical treatment, autoclaving, microwaving, and shredding/compacting. Performance issues, environmental impact, and perspectives from several developing countries are described. In seeking effective solutions for the disposal of medical wastes in developing-world health-care settings, it is necessary to design and build a sustainable system for managing medical waste. All approaches to the management of medical waste must consider the environmental, financial, and technical feasibility of treatment and disposal technologies in the context of the following requirements: (1) Resolve the most critical factors first: Needle-stick injuries and exposure to pathogens. (2) Identify affordable and cost-effective solutions in each specific health-care situation. (3) Consider technical feasibility within the existing health and sanitation infrastructure. (4) Prioritize best environmental practices, considering local infrastructure.\n\nThe hospital project manager has the overall responsibility of ensuring that the hospital wastes are managed in compliance with national legislation and international conventions.\n\n\u25aa Setting up a working group in charge of drafting the waste management plan. \u25aa Appointing the local waste manager, who will supervise and coordinate the waste management plan on a daily basis. \u25aa Assigning duties; drawing up job descriptions. \u25aa Allocating financial and human resources. \u25aa Implementing the waste disposal plan. \u25aa Conducting audits and continuously updating and improving the waste management system.\n\nThe water and habitat engineer is responsible for: Carrying out an initial assessment of the waste situation; \u25aa Proposing a waste management plan to the working group (including the choice of treatment/disposal methods) that is in line with any existing national waste management plan. \u25aa Planning the construction and maintenance of waste storage and disposal facilities. \u25aa Assessing the environmental impact of waste management (monitoring contamination, conducting hydrogeological assessments, etc.). \u25aa Regularly analyzing risks for the personnel. \u25aa Supervising the local waste manager. \u25aa Training.\n\nThe hospital administrator is responsible for: \u25aa Ensuring that stocks of consumables (bags, receptacles and containers, personal protective equipment, etc.) are permanently available. \u25aa Examining and evaluating costs; drawing up contracts with third parties (carriers, subcontractors). \u25aa Giving advice on purchasing policies with a view to minimize/substitute certain items (mercury-free equipment, PVC-free equipment, etc.). \u25aa Monitoring proper implementation of protective measures. \u25aa Supervising in the absence of the water and habitat engineer.\n\nThe head nurse is responsible for: \u25aa Training care staff in waste management (paying special attention to new staff members).\n\n\u25aa Monitoring, sorting, collection, storage and transport procedures in the various wards. \u25aa Monitoring protective measures. \u25aa Supervising the hospital hygiene and taking measures to control infection.\n\nThe chief pharmacist is responsible for: \u25aa Maintaining medicine stocks and minimizing expired stock. \u25aa Managing waste containing mercury. \u25aa In the absence of the pharmacist, the hospital administrator takes over these responsibilities.\n\nThe head of laboratory is responsible for: \u25aa Maintaining the stock of chemicals and minimizing chemical wastes. \u25aa Managing chemical wastes.\n\nSee Tables 8.1 and 8.2.\n\nThe simplest way to identify the different types of waste and to encourage people to sort them is to collect the various types of waste in separate containers or plastic bags that are color-coded and/or marked with a symbol. The international recommendations are given in Table 8 .3.\n\nWaste and by-products cover a diverse range of materials, as the following list illustrates: Infectious waste: waste contaminated with blood and other bodily fluids (e.g., from discarded diagnostic samples), cultures and stocks of infectious agents from laboratory work (e.g., waste from autopsies and infected animals from laboratories), or waste from patients in isolation wards and equipment (e.g., swabs, bandages, and disposable medical devices); Pathological waste: human tissues, organs or fluids, body parts, and contaminated animal carcasses; Waste containing chemical substances (e.g., laboratory reagents; film developer; disinfectants that are expired or no longer needed; solvents; waste with high content of heavy metals, e.g., batteries; broken thermometers and bloodpressure gauges) Radioactive waste\n\nWaste containing radioactive substances (e.g., unused liquids from radiotherapy or laboratory research; contaminated glassware, packages, or absorbent paper; urine and excreta from patients treated or tested with unsealed radionuclides; sealed sources) Nonhazardous or general healthcare waste\n\nWaste that does not pose any particular biological, chemical, radioactive, or physical hazard Radioactive waste: such as products contaminated by radionuclides including radioactive diagnostic material or radiotherapeutic materials; and Nonhazardous or general waste: waste that does not pose any particular biological, chemical, radioactive, or physical hazard. High-income countries generate on average up to 0.5 kg of hazardous waste per bed per day; while low-income countries generate on average 0.2 kg. However, health-care waste is often not separated into hazardous or nonhazardous wastes in low-income countries making the real quantity of hazardous waste much higher.\n\nExposure to hazardous health-care waste can result in disease or injury.\n\nThe hazardous nature of health-care waste may be due to one or more of the following characteristics: \u2022 It contains infectious agents; \u2022 It is genotoxic; \u2022 It contains toxic or hazardous chemicals or pharmaceuticals; \u2022 It is radioactive;\n\n\u2022 It contains sharps.\n\nThe term health-care waste includes all the waste generated within health-care facilities, research centers, and laboratories related to medical procedures. In addition, it includes the same types of waste originating from minor and scattered sources, including waste produced in the course of health-care undertaken in the home (e.g., home dialysis, self-administration of insulin, recuperative care). Between 75% and 90% of the waste produced by health-care providers is comparable to domestic waste and usually called \"nonhazardous\" or \"general health-care waste.\" It comes mostly from the administrative, kitchen, and housekeeping functions at health-care facilities and may also include packaging waste and waste generated during maintenance of health-care buildings. The remaining 10%-25% of health-care waste is regarded as \"hazardous\" and may pose a variety of environmental and health risks.\n\nInfectious waste may contain any of a great variety of pathogenic microorganisms. Pathogens in infectious waste may enter the human body by a number of routes: through a puncture, abrasion, or cut in the skin; through the mucous membranes; by inhalation; by ingestion. The body fluids are the usual vehicles of transmission.\n\nThere is particular concern about infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis viruses B and C, for which there is strong evidence of transmission via health-care waste. These viruses are generally transmitted through injuries from syringe needles contaminated by human blood.\n\nThe existence in health-care establishments of bacteria resistant to antibiotics and chemical disinfectants may also contribute to the hazards created by poorly managed health-care waste. It has been demonstrated, for example, that plasmids from laboratory strains contained in health-care waste were transferred to indigenous bacteria via the waste disposal system. Moreover, antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli have been shown to survive in an activated sludge plant, although there does not seem to be significant transfer of this organism under normal conditions of wastewater disposal and treatment.\n\nThe reduction of waste generation must be encouraged by the following practices:\n\n\u2022 Reducing the amount of waste at source \u2212 Choosing products that generate less waste: less wrapping material, for example. \u2212 Choosing suppliers who take back empty containers for refilling (cleaning products); returning gas cylinders to the supplier for refilling.\n\n\u2212 Preventing wastage: in the course of care, for example, or of cleaning activities. \u2212 Choosing equipment that can be reused such as tableware that can be washed rather than disposable tableware. \u25aa It is prohibited to reuse needles or syringes. The plastic part of syringes is recycled in some regions, but this practice is not recommended in ICRC contexts. \n\nAll personnel dealing with health-care waste should be familiar with the main categories of health-care waste as set out in either national or local regulations on waste classification. As a minimum, managers responsible for health-care waste should conduct a walk-through of the facility to identify the medical areas that produce waste, to obtain an initial estimate of the types and quantities of waste generated, and to understand how the waste is handled and disposed of. A rapid assessment, combining observations with interviews and survey questionnaires, should provide sufficient data to identify problems and begin the process of addressing them ( \n\nExposure to hazardous health-care waste can result in disease or injury. The hazardous nature of health-care waste may be due to one or more of the following characteristics:\n\n\u2022 It contains infectious agents; \u2022 It is genotoxic; \u2022 It contains toxic or hazardous chemicals or pharmaceuticals; \u2022 It is radioactive; \u2022 It contains sharps.\n\nAll individuals exposed to hazardous health-care waste are potentially at risk, including those within health-care establishments that generate hazardous waste, and those outside these sources who either handle such waste or are exposed to it as a consequence of careless management. The main groups at risk are the following: medical doctors, nurses, health-care auxiliaries, and hospital maintenance personnel; patients in health-care establishments or receiving home care; visitors to health-care establishments; workers in support services allied to health-care establishments, such as laundries, waste handling, and transportation; workers in waste disposal facilities (such as incinerators), including scavengers. The hazards associated with scattered, small sources of health-care waste should not be overlooked; waste from these sources includes that generated by home-based health-care, such as dialysis, and that generated by illicit drug use (usually intravenous).\n\n\u25aa Of the total amount of waste generated by health-care activities, about 85% is general, nonhazardous waste. \u25aa The remaining 15% is considered hazardous material that may be infectious, toxic, or radioactive. \u25aa Every year, an estimated 16 billion injections are administered worldwide, but not all of the needles and syringes are properly disposed of afterwards. \u25aa Health-care waste contains potentially harmful microorganisms, which can infect hospital patients, health workers, and the general public. \u25aa Health-care waste in some circumstances is incinerated, and dioxins, furans, and other toxic air pollutants may be produced as emissions.\n\nHealth-care activities protect and restore health and save lives. But what about the waste and by-products they generate? Of the total amount of waste generated by health-care activities, about 85% is general, nonhazardous waste comparable to domestic waste. The remaining 15% is considered hazardous material that may be infectious, toxic, or radioactive.\n\nHealth-care waste contains potentially harmful microorganisms which can infect hospital patients, health workers, and the general public. Other potential infectious risks may include the spread of drug-resistant microorganisms from health facilities into the environment.\n\nHealth risks associated with waste and by-products also include: \u25aa Radiation burns; \u25aa Sharps-inflicted injuries; \u25aa Poisoning and pollution through the release of pharmaceutical products, in particular, antibiotics and cytotoxic drugs; and \u25aa Poisoning and pollution through waste water; and by toxic elements or compounds such as mercury or dioxins that are released during incineration.\n\nWorldwide, an estimated 16 billion injections are administered every year. Not all needles and syringes are disposed of safely, creating a risk of injury and infection and opportunities for reuse. Injections with contaminated needles and syringes in low-and middle-income countries have reduced substantially in recent years, partly due to efforts to reduce reuse of injection devices. Despite this progress, in 2010, unsafe injections were still responsible for as many as 33,800 new HIV infections, 1.7 million hepatitis B infections, and 315,000 hepatitis C infections.\n\nA person who experiences one needle-stick injury from a needle used on an infected source patient has risks of 30%, 1.8%, and 0.3%, respectively, of becoming infected with HBV, HCV, and HIV.\n\nAdditional hazards occur from scavenging at waste disposal sites and during the manual sorting of hazardous waste from health-care facilities. These practices are common in many regions of the world, especially in low-and middle-income countries. The waste handlers are at immediate risk of needle-stick injuries and exposure to toxic or infectious materials.\n\nIn 2015, a joint WHO/UNICEF assessment found that just over half (58%) of sampled facilities from 24 countries had adequate systems in place for the safe disposal of health-care waste.\n\nTreatment and disposal of health-care waste may pose health risks indirectly through the release of pathogens and toxic pollutants into the environment. \u25aa Landfills can contaminate drinking water if they are not properly constructed. Occupational risks exist at disposal facilities that are not well-designed, run, or maintained. \u25aa Incineration of waste has been widely practised, but inadequate incineration or the incineration of unsuitable materials results in the release of pollutants into the air and of ash residue. Incinerated materials containing chlorine can generate dioxins and furans, which are human carcinogens and have been associated with a range of adverse health effects. Incineration of heavy metals or materials with high-metal content (in particular lead, mercury, and cadmium) can lead to the spread of toxic metals in the environment. \u25aa Only modern incinerators operating at 850-1100\u00b0C and fitted with special gas-cleaning equipment are able to comply with the international emission standards for dioxins and furans. \u25aa Alternatives to incineration are now available, such as autoclaving, microwaving, steam treatment integrated with internal mixing, and chemical treatment.\n\nLack of awareness about the health hazards related to health-care waste, inadequate training in proper waste management, absence of waste management and disposal systems, insufficient financial and human resources, and the low priority given to the topic are the most common problems connected with health-care waste. Many countries either do not have appropriate regulations, or do not enforce them.\n\n1. Thermal destruction (incineration) 2. Chemical treatment 3. Stem-based treatment (autoclaving) 4. Microwave 5. Shredding (during/after treatment), compacting, and landfill\n\nWaste must be collected regularly-at least once a day. It must never be allowed to accumulate where it is produced. A daily collection program and collection round must be planned. Each type of waste must be collected and stored separately. Infectious wastes (categories 1 and 2) must never be stored in places that are open to the public.\n\nThe personnel in charge of collecting and transporting wastes must be informed to collect only those yellow bags and sharps containers which the care staff have closed. They must wear gloves.\n\nThe bags that have been collected must be replaced immediately with new bags. \u25aa It must be closed, and access must be restricted to authorized persons only; \u25aa It must be separate from any food store; \u25aa It must be covered and sheltered from the sun; \u25aa The flooring must be waterproof with good drainage; \u25aa It must be easy to clean; \u25aa It must be protected from rodents, birds, and other animals; \u25aa There must be easy access for on-site and off-site means of transport; \u25aa It must be well-aired and well-lit; \u25aa It must be compartmented (so that the various types of waste can be sorted); \u25aa It must be near the incinerator, if incineration is the treatment method used; \u25aa There must be wash basins nearby; \u25aa The entrance must be marked with a sign (\"No unauthorized access,\" \"Toxic,\" or \"Risk of infection.\"\n\nThese means of conveyance must meet the following requirements: \u25aa They must be easy to load and unload; \u25aa They must not have any sharp corners or edges that might tear the bags or damage the containers; \u25aa They must be easy to clean; (with a 5% active chlorine solution); \u25aa They must be clearly marked.\n\nFurthermore, off-site means of transport must meet the following requirements: \u25aa They must be closed in order to avoid any spilling on the road; \u25aa They must be equipped with a safe loading system (to prevent any spilling inside or outside the vehicle); \u25aa They must be marked according to the legislation in force if the load exceeds 333 kg.\n\nThe management of health-care waste requires increased attention and diligence to avoid the substantial disease burden associated with poor practice, including exposure to infectious agents and toxic substances. Key elements in improving health-care waste management are: \u25aa Building a comprehensive system, addressing responsibilities, resource allocation, handling, and disposal. This is a long-term process, sustained by gradual improvements; \u25aa Raising awareness of the risks related to health-care waste, and of safe practices; and \u25aa Selecting safe and environmentally friendly management options, to protect people from hazards when collecting, handling, storing, transporting, treating, or disposing of waste. \u25aa Government commitment and support is needed for universal, longterm improvement, although immediate action can be taken locally.\n\nWHO developed the first global and comprehensive guidance document, \"Safe management of wastes from health-care activities,\" now in its second edition. It addresses aspects such as regulatory framework, planning issues, waste minimization and recycling, handling, storage and transportation, treatment and disposal options, and training. The document is aimed at managers of hospitals and other health-care facilities, policy makers, public health professionals, and managers involved in waste management.\n\nIn collaboration with other partners, WHO also developed a series of training modules on good practices in health-care waste management covering all aspects of waste management activities from identification and classification of wastes to considerations guiding their safe disposal using both nonincineration or incineration strategies.\n\nWHO guidance documents on health-care waste are also available including: \u25aa a monitoring tool; \u25aa a cost assessment tool; \u25aa a rapid assessment tool; \u25aa a policy paper; \u25aa guidance to develop national plans; \u25aa management of waste from injection activities; \u25aa management of waste at primary health-care centers; \u25aa management of waste from mass immunization activities; and \u25aa management of waste in emergencies. \u25aa In addition, WHO and UNICEF, together with partners in 2015, launched a global initiative to ensure that all health-care facilities have adequate water, sanitation, and hygiene services. This includes addressing health-care waste.\n\n(a) Waste generated each month, by waste category:\n\nIn each department treatment and disposal methods. (b) Waste handled safely and in accordance to the safety operation procedures: Occupational safety (e.g., personal protective equipment) Use of proper and clean equipment and marking equipment Proper segregation at source Internal safe transport and storage Internal safe treatment methods Safe disposal methods if on premises of the health-care facility.\n\nThe infection-control officer should liaise with the waste-management officer on a continual basis, and provide advice about the control of infection, and the standards of the waste treatment and disposal system. The infection-control officer's duties that relate to health-care waste include: Identifying training requirements according to staff grade and occupation organizing and supervising staff training courses on the infection risks from poor waste management liaising with the department heads, the matron, and the hospital manager to coordinate training.\n\nThe infection-control officer may also have overall responsibility for chemical disinfection, the safe management of chemical stores, and minimizing chemical waste creation.\n\nThe chief pharmacist is responsible for the safe management of pharmaceutical stores and for minimizing pharmaceutical waste. Duties include: Liaising with department heads, the waste-management officer, the matron, and the hospital manager, and giving advice, in accordance with the national policy and guidelines, on the appropriate procedures for pharmaceutical waste treatment and disposal; coordinating continual monitoring of procedures for the treatment and disposal of pharmaceutical waste; ensuring that personnel involved in pharmaceutical waste handling, treatment, and disposal receive adequate training; remaining up to date with the proper treatment and safe disposal of expired, damaged, and unusable pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical packaging, and equipment. The chief pharmacist also has the special responsibility of ensuring that genotoxic products are used safely, and that genotoxic waste is managed safely.\n\nThe duties and responsibilities of the radiation officer are the same as those of the pharmaceutical officer, but relate to radioactive waste. There may also be additional regulations regarding the storage and safeguarding of radioactive wastes. These regulations need to be followed strictly for the safety of those handling the wastes.\n\nThe supply officer should liaise with the waste-management officer to ensure a continuous supply of the items required for waste management (plastic bags and containers of the right quality, spare parts for on-site health-care waste-treatment equipment). These items should be ordered in good time to ensure that they are always available, but accumulation of excessive stores supplies should be avoided. The supply officer should also investigate the possibility of purchasing environmentally friendly products (e.g., polyvinyl chloride-free plastic items).\n\nThe hospital engineer is responsible for installing and maintaining waste-storage facilities and handling equipment that complies with the specifications of the national guidelines. The engineer is also accountable for the adequate operation and maintenance of any on-site waste-treatment equipment and is responsible for the staff involved in waste treatment, ensuring that: staff receive training in the principles of waste disposal and are aware of their responsibilities under the hospital waste-management plan; staff operating on-site waste-treatment facilities are trained in their operation and maintenance.\n\n\u25aa Direct costs of supplies and materials used for collection, transport, storage, treatment, disposal, decontamination, and cleaning \u25aa Training costs (labor and material) \u25aa Costs of operation and maintenance of on-site treatment facilities \u25aa Costs for contractor services.\n\nA national management plan will permit health-care waste management options to be optimized on a national scale. A national survey of health-care waste will provide the relevant agency with a basis for identifying actions on a district, regional, and national basis, taking into account conditions, needs, and possibilities at each level. An appropriate, safe, and cost-effective strategy will be concerned principally with treatment, recycling, transport, and disposal options.\n\nAction plan for the development of a national program\n\nStep 1: Establish policy commitment and responsibility for health-care waste management\n\nStep 2: Conduct a national survey of health-care waste practices\n\nStep 3: Develop national guidelines\n\nStep 4: Develop a policy on regional and cooperative methods of healthcare waste treatment\n\nStep 5: Legislation: regulations and standards for health-care waste management\n\nStep 6: Institute a national training program"}
