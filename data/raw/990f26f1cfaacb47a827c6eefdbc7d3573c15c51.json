{"title": "Original Papers Application of Electron Microscopy in Viral Diagnosis", "body": "The development of the first electron microscope in the 1930's and the subsequent elaboration of preparation techniques for examining biological material in the 1940's made visualization of virus possible. Until then nothing was known about the morphology of virus particles, because of their extremely small size (20-500 nm in diameter). Most of them are below the detection limit of the light microscope, and their size was approximately determined through filtration experiments. It is the electron microscope with its high resolving power that has revealed the great variety of virus morphology.\n\nThe first report on use of the electron microscope in diagnostic virology came in 1948 when virus particles were demonstrated by shadow casting technique in clinical specimens from patients affected with smallpox, vaccinia and varicella (Nagler and Rake, 1948; van Rooyen and Scott, 1948) . However, the preparation techniques at that time were cumbersome and timeconsuming, and it was not until the introduction of the negative staining technique (Brenner and Horne, 1959) , that the electron microscope became an instrument of practical value in virology.\n\nSince then detection of a variety of viruses by EM in clinical specimens from infected humans has been reported. Poxvirus and herpesvirus were demonstrated in skin lesions (Peters et al., 1962; Nagington, 1964; Cruickshank et al., 1966) , paramyxovirus in nasopharyngeal secretions (Doane et al., 1967 (Doane et al., , 1969 Joncas, 1969) , hepatitis-Bvantigen in serum (Bayer et al., 1968) , rotavirus and adenovirus in faecal samples (Bishop et al., 1974; Flewett et al., 1973 Flewett et al., , 1974 and several more. But only quite recently, however, has the microscope been recognized as an important tool in rapid diagnosis of viral infections (Banatvala et al., 1975; Doane and Anderson, 1977) .\n\nThe advantages of the electron microscopical techniques compared to other methods used in diagnostic virology are obvious. Speed is essential in cases of smallpox and herpes encephalitis, where the handling of the epidemiological situation and the treatment and prognosis depend on a correct and rapid diagnosis. And electron microscopy is a rapid method. By negative staining and electron microscopy preparation, examination and identification of a virus may be done in minutes or hours. By standard virological methods, primarily isolation of virus in cell cultures, eggs or animals, it may take days or weeks before the answer is available. But also in combination with inoculation of virus samples in cell cultures electron micro scopy may be useful. If the cytopathic effect on the cells is not typical, a rapid demonstration of characteristic virus particles will save time and reagents (Doane et aI., 1969; Pennington et aI., 1975) .\n\nAnother advantage of electron microscopy is its \"lack\" of specificity. Newer laboratory routines in diagnostic virology like immunofluorescence technique (FAT), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzymelinked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) are rapid and sensitive methods, but they require specific antibody and permit only demonstration of one particular virus or virus group at a time. The electron microscope visualizes any virus particle present, and there is no need to have any previous knowledge of what group it belongs to.\n\nFinally the electron microscope is of decisive value when dealing with viruses that are difficult or impossible to culture, either because they do not grow in routine cell cultures at all or because they have lost their infectivity during transportation. The morphology is often stable even if the infectivity is lost. A number of such viruses have been demonstrated for the first time by EM, for example viruses associated with gastroenteritis (Flewett et aI., 1973; Bishop et aI., 1974; Kapikian et aI., 1972; Paver et aI., 1973; Madeley and Cosgrove, 1975) , and hepatitis (Bayer et aI., 1968; Feinstone et aI., 1973) .\n\nDirect electron microscop y onl y places the virus in its morphological group, which, however, in some cases may be sufficient. Further serological typing of the virus requires immuno electron microscopy (IEM) or other serological methods.\n\nThis report reviews the most important electron microscopical techniques used in diagnostic virology to day and describes the main morphological characteristics of the various virus groups, which are most likely to be found in different clinical specimens.\n\nThe first available preparatory technique was the shadow casting technique, which nowadays is practically never used in diagnostic virology. Ultrathin sectioning was the second preparatory technique developed for electron microscopy. This technique is extensively used in cell biology, although rarely in viral diagnosis. Most work is done with the negative staining technique, which is far more simple and gives more information about virus morphology than the other two.\n\nThis technique is mostly used for examination of particles in suspension, but it has been applied to thin sections, cells and cell-organells (Parsons, 1963) . Any biological object, in this case a virus particle, is a poor electron scatterer. The negative stain surrounds the object with an amorphous, high electron scattering coating, which enhances the contrast. The virus particle appears white or \"negative\" against a dark background. The electron scattering material penetrates to a certain degree the particle and reveals details of the surface and in some cases the internal structure.\n\nSuitable electron stains are solutions of heavy metal compounds such as phosphotungstic acid, sodiumsilicotungstate, ammoniummolybdate and uranyl salts. The appearance of the object may vary considerably with different stains and with the same stain at different pH-values (Muller, 1975) . Ammoniummolybdate for example has a preserving effect on membranes, whereas uranylformate stabilizes lipid containing viruses by binding to phospholipids. As an acid solution reveals the finest surface detail, while an alkaline solution visualizes inner structures, an unknown object ought to be examined with different stains at different pH-values in order to find the optimal conditions for this particular particle. In virus diagnostic work, however, this approach would be much too time-consuming, and since most viruses are effectively stained with a 2-3 % solution of phosphotungsticacid (PTA) adjusted with KOH to pH 7, this may be choosen as an allround stain.\n\nThe staining procedure itself may be performed in several ways (Nermuth, 1975; Johansen, 1978) . One simple method is to mix equal volumes of the virus suspension and the stain. One drop of the mixture is placed on a formvar-carboncoated copper grid. After adsorbtion of the virus particles to the grid for one minute excess fluid is removed with a filterpaper, and the grid is airdried and examined in the microscope. In searching for unknown agents a magnification of 50,000 X is suitable, as this enlargement covers the whole size range of viruses.\n\nSpecimen grids with thin carbon support instead of the usual forrnvarcarbon film may be recommended in special cases, as the contrast in the virus structure is enhanced (johansen, 1976) . This may be important in distin-guishing small spherical viruses with different surface structure (Kjeldsberg, 1977) . Unfortunately it seems to be less stable than the formvar-carbon support and thus not quite suitable for routine use.\n\nIf an EM examination should be successful, the specimen must fulfil certain conditions.\n\nOne of these conditions is that the concentration of virus particles is high. If a large and characteristic particle like the poxvirus is present, the concentration must be at least 10 7 particles pr mi. However, the minimum concentration depends on the size and shape of the virus. Small and anonymous particles like enteroviruses require as high concentrations as 10 9_10 10 particles pr ml to be discovered.\n\nAnother requirement for a successful result is that the salt content is low. When drying on the specimen grid the salts crystallize, and if there is too much salt present, this will obliterate the virus particles during examination.\n\nFinally the specimen should contain as little extraneous material as possible. It may be very hard to spot an occasional virus particle among other circular or oval objects of virus size but of non-viral nature. In highly crude samples therefore, the requirement of a high concentration of virus is of importance.\n\nVesicular-and pustular fluids, scabs, nasopharyngeal secretions, biopsyand autopsy tissue are clinical specimens that often contain a large amount of morphologically recognizable virus particles and may be examined directly by EM without prior concentration. Smears of vesicular-and pustular fluids are resuspended in a few drops of distilled water before staining. Scabs are homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in a small volume of distilled water and the homogenate stained. Nasopharyngeal secretions are stained directly. Specimens collected on cotton swabs may be resuspended in distilled water and stained without prior treatment. Biopsy-and autopsy tissue are cut into small pieces (1 mrrr') and frozen and thawn a few times on a metal planchet on dry ice in order to rupture the tissue and release the virus particles. A few drops of distilled water are added and the mixture is suspended and stained.\n\nMost fluid specimens, however, contain a considerable amount of salt and the result may be improved by using the \"water-drop\" method to avoid this problem (Doane et aI., 1969) . A drop of the specimen is placed on a drop of distilled water on a wax plate, and a grid touched quickly to the surface of the drop before negative staining.\n\nOther types of clinical specimens usually contain too small a number of viruses to be examined directly and have to be concentrated by centrifugation prior to negative staining. These include faeces, spinal fluid, urine, serum and throat-and eyewashings. Faecal samples are suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 10-20% v/v and then concentrated. All specimens are clarified by light centrifugation 30 minutes at 3000 g to remove bacteria and cell debris. The supernatant is recentrifuged for 90 minutes at 50,000 g to deposit virus. The pellet is drained off, resuspended in a few drops of distilled water and negatively stained. By this treatment the virus suspension is concentrated, partly purified and freed from disturbing content of salt.\n\nTreatment of cell culture specimens for EM, whether it concerns cells inoculated with virus or control cultures, is often actual and may be done as follows. Cells from culture tubes are scraped off the tube into the medium, and the cell suspension is centrifuged for 90 minutes at 50,000 g. The pellet is transferred to a metal planchet and freeze-thawed a few times to rupture all cells and release virus. A drop of distilled water is added and the suspension is negatively stained and examined in the microscope.\n\nUltrathin sectioning technique combined with positive staining may be used for demonstration of intracellular virus particles in biopsy-and autopsy tissue and in cell cultures. The technique involves ultramicrotorny, and to be able to be cut into ultrathin sections (approx. 50 nm thick) 1 mm' pieces of tissue must be fixed and embedded in a polymerizable resin. Glutaraldehyde or glutaraldehyde-formaldehyde mixtures followed by osmiumtetroxide are the most commonly used fixatives. Epoxy-type resins polymerizable at a high temperature are often used for embedding. Ultrathin sections are cut on an ultramicrotome, collected on grids and positively stained. Heavy metal compounds as uranylacetate and lead citrate, usually in combination, are suitable stains in positive staining, where the salt solution directly interacts with molecules in the tissue; and the object appears dark on a light background (Sevens and Johannessen, 1978) .\n\nBiopsy tissue, which has been formalin fixed and paraffin embedded for light microscopy, may be used for thin section EM (Johannessen, 1977; Johannessen and Behler, 1978) . In diagnostic virology, where the aim is demonstration of the presens of virus particles, this technique may give valuable information, as the virus particles are amazingly well preserved even under less ideal conditions. However, in spite of recently published rapid embedding methods (Johannessen, 1973; Doane et al., 1974) , this technique is complicated and fairly lengthy compaired to negative staining. As it gives less information of the ultrastructure of the virus, it is not routinely used in viral diagnosis.\n\nIn IEM specific antibody is added and allowed to react with virus antigens in an immunological reaction, and the product is visualized in the electron microscope (Almeida and Waterson, 1969) . The technique may be applied to either virus particles in suspension using negative staining, or to intracellular virus in tissues or cell cultures by thin sectioning.\n\nWhen specific antibody is added to a specimen containing virus particles, the antibody molecules will adhere to and aggregate the particles. The appearance depends on the relative amounts of antigen and antibody. Virus and antibody, present in appropriate proportions, form large aggregates of virus particles linked by antibody molecules. Excess antigen or antibody cause a low degree of aggregation. When the aggregation is prevented by too much antibody the virus particles are covered with a thick fuzz of antibody molecules. With unknown concentrations of antigen and antibody, therefore, series of dilutions of the one must be put up against series of dilutions of the other to get satisfactory results.\n\nIEM is a useful method by examination of crude specimens with a low concentration of virus, especially when the virus particles are small and without a distinctive morphology. Aggregates are easier to detect among other disturbing material than single particles. Some of the recently detected gastroenterit viruses like Norwalk agent and astrovirus were demonstrated in faeces by IEM (Kapikian et aI., 1972; Madeley and Cosgrove, 1975) . Hepatitis A virus was found in faeces from patients with infectious hepatitis also by using the patients reconvalescent serum in the IEM method (Kapikian et aI., 1976) .\n\nUtilizing the specificity of immunoreactions, further typing of virus within a morphological group is possible by IEM directly on the specimen grid. This has been reported for enteroviruses (Doane, 1974; Anderson and Doane, 1973) and myxoviruses (Kelen and McLoed, 1974) , but the method may of course be applied to any system.\n\nIn practice one volume of the specimen may be mixed with one volume of antiserum and the mixture incubated 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at + 4\u00b0C to allow the antigen/antibody reaction to take place. The antiserum used in the reaction should be inactivated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C to avoid complications arising from presence of complement, and ultracentrifuged for 1 hour at 100,000 g. Furthermore, the antiserum ought to be used in a dilution of at least YIO (rather Yso) to avoid cross reaction. After an appropriate time of incubation the aggregates may be concentrated either by centrifugation for 1 hour at 50,000 g, or by an agar-diffusion technique (Doane, 1974) and finally negatively stained.\n\nIEM on thin sections should be mentioned as a possibility in special cases, not as a routine technique. Virus antigens may be localized intracellular or on cell surfaces by use of antibody coupled to electron dense marker systems like ferritin or peroxidase (Howe et al., 1974; Dmochowski et al., 1974) .\n\nIn spite of the great variety in sizes and shapes viruses may be divided into three main geometrical groups and each main group further into several subgroups on the basis of their distinctive morphology and symmetry (Madeley, 1972; Horne, 1974) . By direct EM a virus may be placed in one of these morphological groups. The three main groups comprise virions with a) cubic (icosahedral) symmetry, b) helical symmetry and c) complex structure. The symmetry relates to the construction of the nucleocapsid, which is the combined nucleicacid and protein covering of the virus. Nucleocapsids may be enclosed in a cell derived envelope or they may be naked.\n\nThe group icosahedral viruses comprises a large number of spherical-shaped viruses with a diameter ranging from 20 to 100 nm. The central core of nucleicacid is surrounded by a protein shell possessing icosahedral symmetry and assembled from aggregates of identical proteins (capsomeres). These capsomeres may appear as hollow tubes, holes or spherical units, and each morphological subgroup has a distinct number of capsomeres. Adenovirus (Fig. 6) , for example has 252. Other examples of cubic viruses are herpesvirus (Fig. 3a, b and c) , papovavirus (Fig. 4) , and enterovirus (Fig. 7) .\n\nViruses with helical symmetry consist of a helical nucleocapsid, more or less randomly coiled, and by animal and human viruses always enclosed in an envelope. By some of these viruses the envelope is easily ruptured, releasing the inner helical structure. They are highly pleomorphic structures varying in both size and shape (80-500 nm) and the envelope is covered with spike-like projections placed at regular spacings and easily distinguished. The most important subgroups are orthomyxovirus and paramyxovirus, the former including influenzavirus (Fig. 11) , the latter mumpsvirus ( Fig. 12a and b) , parainfluenzaand measlesvirus. Quite recently coronaviruses (Fig. 16) have been demonstrated to contain ribonucleoprotein helices, which probably place them in this same group (Davies et al., 1978) .\n\nThe third geometrical main group includes viruses with a complex structure. Their protein shell is assembled according to a mixture of symmetrical plans. Typical examples are the vaccinia-and paravaccinia subgroups, considered under the heading of poxviruses. They are large particles approximately 250 nm long, and both subgroups appear in two different morphological forms ( Fig. 1 and 2) .\n\nBecause of the distinct morphological differences between the subgroups, herpesvirus, for example, may easily be distinguished from vacciniavirus or enterovirus. On the other hand, differentiation between viruses within a morphological group is impossible by direct EM. All members of the herpesvirus group are morphologically indistinguishable from each other.\n\nClinical specimens from skin lesions often provide excellent sources for direct examination by EM because of their high content of virus. Poxvirus and herpesvirus are easily detected in vesicle fluid and crusts from patients with smallpox and chickenpox, and the differentiation between these two virus groups has been of great importance in diagnostic virology (Peters et al., 1962; Nagington, 1964; Cruickshank et al., 1966) . Orfvirus, the etiological agent of ectyma contagiosum, and molluscum contagiosum are without any difficulties demonstrated in skin tumors (Macrae et al., 1969; Johannessen et al., 1975) , and papovavirus in common warts and genital warts (Williams et al., 1961; Oriel and Almeida, 1970) . Figures 1-4 show some examples of the virus groups, one may expect to find in specimens from the skin. \n\nFaecal samples, too, are suitable for EM, but usually not until after centrifugation. Recently a wide variety of viruses have been found in negatively stained faecal specimens and most of them in association with non bacterial gastroenteritis. Rotavirus (Flewett et aI., 1973) , Norwalk agent (Kapikian et aI., 1972) , adenovirus and enterovirus (Flewett et aI., 1974) , hepatitis A virus (Feinstone et aI., 1973) , astrovirus and calicivirus (Madeley and Cosgrove, 1975, 1976) , coronavirus (Caul et aI., 1975) and some \"viruslike\" particles (Paver et aI., 1973; Mathan et aI., 1975) have been demonstrated by negative staining and EM of faecal samples. In case of gastroenteritis rotavirus is far the most common followed be adenovirus, while the others are more or less rare. Examples of gastroenterit viruses are shown in figures 5-10.\n\nFrom patients with respiratory illness samples drawn from the nasopharynx are usable in demonstration of viruses. Orthomyxo-and paramyxoviruses are the most common (Doane et aI., 1967; Joncas et aI., 1969) . But coronavirus are found to be responsible for respiratory infections (Almeida and Tyrrell, 1967) and the virus particles have been demonstrated directly by EM in nasal secretions from acute upper respiratory tract infections as referred by Doane and Anderson (1977) . Orthomyxo-, paramyxo-and coronavirus are illustrated in figures 11, 12a, 12b and 16. Fig. 7 . Enteroviruses appearing as featureless spheres but with a very constant Size and a sharp outline (arrows). One \"empty\" stain penetrated particle is Visible (arrowhead). \n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rarely contains sufficient quantities of virus to be examined by direct EM. However, herpesviruses have been detected in CSF from a patient with herpes zoster (Evans and Melnick, 1949) and mumpsvirus from a patient with encephalitis (Doane et al., 1967) .\n\nDirect EM of urine is usually of no use. However, cytomegalovirus has been found by centrifugation of a large volume, 30-50 ml, of urine and negative staining of the concentrated virus (Montplaisir et aI., 1972) , and papovavirus has been demonstrated in urine from renal-transplanted patients (Gardner et al., 1971 ).\n\nDemonstration of hepatitis B antigens in serum was earlier to a great extent done by immune electron microscopy. This technique is still used in hepatitis diagnosis, as a supplement to RIA, for detection of Dane particles, the infectious agent of serumhepatitis (Dane et aI., 1970) Fig. 13 . Demonstration of small spherical parvovirus-like particles in serum from healthy blooddonors and from patients was reported by Cossart et a1. (1975) , but their pathogenicity is unknown. However, it appears that serum is not very suitable for direct EM detection of viruses.\n\nBiopsy-or autopsy tissue may be treated either by negative staining technique or by thin sectioning as mentioned above. Thin sectioning is usually the most reliable especially with brain biopsy because of the great content of lipid. Herpesviruses are demonstrated in brain tissue from herpetic encephalitis (Harland et aI., 1967) , papovavirus from progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (zu Rhein and Chou, 1965) and measlesvirus-like structures from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (Tellez-Nagel and Harter, 1966) . Rotavirus was demonstrated in duodenal mucosa (Bishop et aI., 1973) and hepatitis B virus in liver biopsy (Huang, 1971) . Herpesviruses in a brain biopsy are seen in figure 14 .\n\nIsolation of virus in cell cultures may at times be rather troublesome. If the infection produces an atypical cytopathic effect the virus isolate may however be identified by electron microscopy (Doane et aI., 1969; Pennington et aI., Fig. 15 . Reoviruses demonstrated in a cell culture inoculated with faeces from a patient with periodically fever. The virus particles are morph ologically simil ar to rota virus but without a clear outline . Negatively stained with PTA. Bar, 100 nm. Fig. 16 . Coro navirus-like particl e isolared in a cell culture inoculated with cerebrospinal fluid fro m a patient with meningitis.

Foam y agent, a contam inant virus , demonst rated m green mon key kidney (GMK) cells. Th e particle has long well developed surface projections. Negatively sta ined with PTA. Bar, 100 nm . 1975) . Figures 15 and 16 show examples of viruses, which were identified in cell cultures by EM after months with confusing results by other methods. Control of cell cultures used for propagation of virus is important, as primary cell cultures from monkey kidney tissue are widely used, but unfortunately harbour simian viru ses. These viruses do not always produce a recognizable cytopathic effect, but may however interfere with or inhibit isolation of human virus (Anderson and Do ane, 1970) . Periodic checks by EM of primary cell cultures and viru s pools prepared in simian cell cultures help to avoid this problem. Figure 17 shows a Foam y agent particle , one of the contaminant viru ses of monkey cells.\n\nSummarizing the advantages and disadvantages of EM one must come to the conclusion, that it is an invaluable help as a supplement to other virological methods, although it may not be able to replace standard techniques in daily routine work at a great laboratory with a large number of specimens.\n\nThe technique is an expensive one due to the high price of both purchase and maintenance of the microscope. Furthermore, it has a low capacity. Few laboratories have more than, at best, one microscope, and only a very limited number of samples can be examined per day. Examination of a specimen in the microscope takes on the average half an hour.\n\nThe most important application of electron microscopy is probably in situations where speed is really essential. But also when dealing with viruses, which can not yet be propagated in any in vivo or in vitro system, or grow with difficulty and atypical or no cytopathic effect, and in periodic checks of cell cultures and virus pools, the microscope may be very useful to virologists.\n\nIn the last few years the number of viruses, known to be responsible for human diseases, has grown, largely due to electron microscopy. The future importance of both direct and immune electron microscopy in diagnostic virology as well as in the search for new agents might therefore be obvious."}
