{"title": "Seroepidemiology of Astrovirus MLB1", "body": "(5=-ATAGCGGCCGCATGGCTAATGCCAATAAGGGTGTG-3=) and LG0206 (5=-ATACTCGAGTTATTTGTCTAAAAGACA TGCCTCA-3=) for MLB3. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated by the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's protocol at the St. Jude's Protein Production Core Facility. Human astrovirus serotype 1 capsid protein was produced as previously described (8) with the following modification: an N-terminal His tag was added to the previous construct. Baculovirus-expressed His-tagged RANK protein was kindly provided by Daved Fremont (9) . MLB1, MLB2, and MLB3 capsid proteins were expressed in a baculovirus system as N-terminal 6\u03ebHis-tagged proteins and af-finity purified using HiTrap chelating high-performance (HP) columns (GE Healthcare). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining were used to assess the purity of the protein (Fig. 1A) . Also, mass spectrometry was used to confirm the mass of the major product. Additionally, a Western blot assay using the polyclonal rabbit antibodies against MLB1 and MLB2 capsid gave signals of approximately the expected size (88 kDA for MLB1 and 87 kDA for MLB2) (Fig. 1B) .\n\nWe analyzed 395 deidentified sera from subjects 2 months to 95 years of age, which were obtained from healthy volunteers in North America for previous studies conducted at the Saint Louis University Center for Vaccine Development collected between 1984 and 2009 (examples of studies include references 10 and 11). The ages of the subjects and numbers of sera were as follows: 0 to 6 months, n \u03ed 22; 7 to 11 months, n \u03ed 23; 12 to 23 months, n \u03ed 35; 2 years, n \u03ed 13; 3 years, n \u03ed 20; 4 to 6 years, n \u03ed 47; 7 to 17 years, n \u03ed 75; 18 to 32 years, n \u03ed 38; 33 to 64 years, n \u03ed 42; and \u03fe65 years, n \u03ed 80. The institutional review boards at Saint Louis University and Washington University School of Medicine approved this study.\n\nELISAs were optimized and performed as described previously (12) seropositivity of MLB1 was 86.6% (342/395). Anti-MLB1 capsid antibodies appear to be maternally transferred based on the relatively high seroprevalence in the 0-to 6-month age group (68.1%) coupled with a lower positivity rate (31.4%) in the 12-to 23month age group. The seropositivity rate then rapidly increased and reached 100% in the 7-to 17-year age group (Fig. 2) and remained high thereafter. Thus, MLB1 seroepidemiology parallels that of human astrovirus 1 but is in contrast to the low seroprevalence rates of human astrovirus 7 (1).\n\nTo assess the specificity of the MLB1 assay, preincubation assays were performed on 10 serum samples arbitrarily chosen among samples with high-intensity signal (optical density [OD] of \u03fe2.400). Preincubation with His-MLB1 capsid reduced the ELISA signal on average by 70%; in contrast, the signal remained constant when preincubated with His-HAstV-1, His-MLB2, His-MLB3, and His-RANK (Fig. 3) . Sample 10 did not compete with any antigen, including His-MLB1, at the standard 1:100 serum dilution; however, competition was observed with His-MLB1 but not the other proteins at a more dilute serum concentration (1: 800), suggesting that this sample had high-titer MLB1 antibodies (data not shown).\n\nWe also attempted to define the seroprevalence of MLB2 by using a parallel ELISA approach with MLB2 capsid as the target antigen. A total of 89.4% of the cohort was positive in this assay. However, preincubation experiments done on 20 samples (10 arbitrarily chosen among samples with high-intensity signal [OD of \u03fe2.400] and 10 randomly selected from the co-hort) demonstrated significant levels of cross-reaction with MLB1 (50% of samples) and MLB3 (20% of samples), thus precluding definitive interpretation of these results (Fig. 4) . This type of one-way cross-reactivity has been described for other viruses (13) . We did not evaluate MLB3 seropositivity in an ELISA since MLB3 and MLB2 share 89% amino acid identity in the capsid region. In the future, the development of more specific serologic assays, such as a neutralization assay or the use of monoclonal antibodies will be needed to explicitly define the levels of MLB2 and MLB3 seropositivity and to determine whether these are distinct serotypes.\n\nThe potential role that the MLB clade astroviruses may play in human disease is currently unknown. These viruses might cause diarrhea like the canonical human astrovirus serotypes 1 to 8, although we cannot discount the possibility that they may have other pathogenic potential in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or elsewhere. We recently described a febrile patient viremic with MLB2 (7), raising the possibility that MLB2 may be involved in fever; another implication of that study is that MLB2, and thus possibly other astroviruses as well, can clearly access cellular compartments outside the GI tract via the circulatory system. Indeed, a distinct novel astrovirus has been reported in brain tissue of an immunocompromised patient with encephalitis (14) , and serologic analysis demonstrates that infection with this astrovirus is relatively common (15) . Thus, the high rates of seropositivity against MLB1 observed in this study underscore the need to define "}
