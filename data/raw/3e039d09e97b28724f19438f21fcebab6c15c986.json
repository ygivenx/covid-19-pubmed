{"title": "", "body": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of airway that can be exacerbated by various triggering factors. Which tests can predict the loss of asthma control? In this issue, Kreetapirom et al. [4] and Kang et al. [5] shares their experience with forced oscillator technique, a noninvasive objective measurement of lung physiology, and spirometric parameters such as forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity with fractional exhaled nitric oxide.\n\nFruit allergy is an interesting area. Most patients have oral allergy syndrome. However, some patients have very severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis. This issue contains interesting articles on banana-induced anaphylaxis from Thailand [6] , and the association between fruit and vegetable allergies and pollen-food allergy in Japanese children [7] . This issue also contains unique articles on 5-year experience of peanut allergy in the largest pediatric hospital in Singapore [8] and differences in omega-5-gliadin allergy, wheat dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis, from Hong Kong and UK [9] .\n\nProper diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis is very critical in the Emergency Department. De Vera and Tagaro [10] emphasize the importance again in the article from the Philippines. Educations not only for patients and their care givers, but also for medical students, physicians, nurses, nurseries, kindergartens, schools, and emergency rescue teams are very important to increase the awareness on anaphylaxis [11] [12] [13] [14] .\n\nIn this January, there has been lots of difficulties such as Taal volcano eruption in the Philippines (I was in Silang near Taal with medical students for a medical volunteer program at the time of eruption), and 2019-nCoV, a novel corona virus, outbreak. As the Editor-in-Chief, I deeply appreciate those who contributed for this issue in times of difficulty. Our mission is to publish your work, and to introduce you and your work to the world.\n\nPlease note that Japanese Society of Allergology/ World Allergy Organization Joint Congress (WAC 2020) conjoint with the APAAACI/APAPARI 2020 Congress will be held in Kyoto on September 17-20 this year. It is also the official APAAACI congress. Hope many of you can join us. Please save the dates!"}
