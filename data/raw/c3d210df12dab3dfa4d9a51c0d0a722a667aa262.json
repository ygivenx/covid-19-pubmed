{"title": "Supplemental information Supplemental material and methods Experimental infection of ducks, geese and chicken with DE14-H5N8A and DE16-H5N8B 4", "body": "inoculated waterfowl and served as sentinels. Animals were monitored daily for clinical signs 25 for a period of up to 21 days. Animals the suffered severe disease like pronounced lethargy or 26 apathy were sacrificed before and considered dead on the subsequent day. The intramuscular 27 pathogenicity and clinical scoring indices (IMPI) were calculated based on the following tissues, three mice of each group were euthanized on 3 dpi, in addition three mice from the 53 groups 10 3 , 10 5 , 10 6 were euthanized on 6 dpi, and organs (i.e., lungs, conchae, heart, and 54 brains) were harvested for histopathological-and virological examinations. The primer and probe set of the generic PB1 assay (summarized in table S4) was used to 87 determine the quantification cycle (Cq) in swabs, nasal washes, and organs using the one-step 88 RT-qPCR Kit qScript\u2122 XLT One-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix\u00ae (Quantabio, Beverly USA).\n\nThe RT-qPCR assay was optimized for using a total volume of 12.5 \u00b5l. Briefly, for a single 90 well 1.75 \u00b5l RNase-free water, 6.25 \u00b5l 2x RT-PCR buffer, and 1.0 \u00b5l primer-probe-mix for 91 template detection as well as 1.0 \u00b5l primer-probe-mix for detection of the internal extraction 92 control RNA, were pooled as a master mix. Finally, 2.5 \u00b5l RNA template was added and the 93 reaction was run on an CFX96 machine. Genome copy numbers per \u00b5l were determined by "}
