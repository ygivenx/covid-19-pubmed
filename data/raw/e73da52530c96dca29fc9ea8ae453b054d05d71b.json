{"title": "Viral Respiratory Infections and Asthma: the Course Ahead", "body": "A 12th century physician, Moses Maimonides, stated in reference to asthma, \"I conclude that this disorder starts with a common cold, especially in the rainy season, and the patient is forced to gasp for breath day and night, depending on the duration of the onset, until the phlegm is expelled, the flow completed and the lung well cleared.\" 1 Thus, physicians have long recognized an association between common respiratory illnesses and the onset and/or worsening of wheeze and asthma. Until recent years, however, researchers seeking to gain a mechanistic understanding of the nature and relative importance of this association have had a limited number of tools to diagnose viral infections and investigate relationships to acute and chronic effects on asthma. In this article, we will discuss how recent advances in research approaches and technology have helped to define associations between viral respiratory illnesses and the development of wheezing illnesses and childhood asthma as well as asthma exacerbations in children and adults. In addition, we will identify important gaps in our current knowledge and reflect on potential directions for future research into understanding of the role of viral respiratory infections in asthma.\n\nAdvances in respiratory virus detection have led to critical new insights into the development and exacerbation of asthma. For example, in the past respiratory viruses were difficult to detect by conventional methods because some do not grow well in culture. In clinical studies of acute viral illnesses, detection rates of 30-50% were the norm using techniques such as viral culture, antigen detection using labeled antibodies, or serologic detection. More recently, molecular techniques have greatly improved overall rates of viral detection (Table I) , and some studies of acute respiratory illnesses have reported viral detection rates of as high as 90%, especially in infants. These techniques have been used to identify whole new classes of viruses, such as metapneumoviruses, bocaviruses, new strains of coronaviruses (NL63, SARS, HKU1), and polyomaviruses. Each of these viruses may cause acute wheezing in infancy, and some have also been associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.\n\nIn addition, recent reports using molecular detection techniques and partial or full sequence analysis have identified a novel species of human rhinoviruses (HRV), designated HRV-C (also called HRV-A2, HRV-NY, HRV-QPM, and HRV-X). 2-4 This novel group, HRV-C, contributes to a significant burden of HRV-related illness and may be particularly relevant to both infant wheeze and established asthma. It seems likely that HRV-C has been circulating for some time, rather than being a newly emergent virus. Recent data in studies of children suggest that viruses in the HRV-C group may be either more prone to stimulate acute symptoms of asthma, or intrinsically more virulent.5 One common feature of HRV-C and other newly identified viruses is that most are difficult or impossible to grow in standard tissue culture, which explains why they were detected first with molecular techniques.\n\nA caveat with regard to these dramatically improved PCR-based methods of viral detection is that, with increased sensitivity in detecting viral genetic material in the host, the presence of a pathogen in respiratory secretions is not necessarily associated with clinical illness. This is particularly true for HRV, which can be found in a considerable proportion of healthy individuals, especially in the spring and fall. Studies utilizing sequential sampling in children indicate that detection of HRV in well children represents asymptomatic infection. Therefore, it has been important to link symptomatic illnesses, particularly wheezing illnesses, with HRV detection when estimating its role in determining asthma risk. 6, 7 Chronic infection with HRV does not occur except in association with marked immunosuppression. 8 Identification of biomarkers that would allow us to better connect viral detection with clinically relevant outcomes is an important research goal, which would improve our ability to interpret epidemiological data. The use of viral sequencing to track individual strains in clinical studies and the development of new techniques to track the anatomic distribution of viruses in vivo could aid the understanding of this issue.\n\nThe burden of health care costs associated with hospitalizations and emergency room visits for virus-induced wheezing during the first three years of life is significant, and development of specific therapies is a huge unmet medical need. Virus-induced wheezing in infancy is associated with an increased risk for recurrent wheezing as children grow older. 7, 9 Moreover, there is substantial evidence that early life virus-induced wheezing illnesses are associated with subsequent childhood asthma. It is important to note that the fundamental question of whether these viral respiratory infections are causal factors or instead serve as indicators of a predisposition to asthma is still unresolved.\n\nTwo recent studies have readdressed this controversy. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent infection causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children 1 year of age and younger, and commonly presents as a wheezing illness during the late fall, winter, and early spring in temperate climates. 10 Recently, Wu and colleagues reported that the timing of infant birth in relationship to the peak of bronchiolitis hospitalizations for that winter season predicted the likelihood of developing clinically significant bronchiolitis.11 In addition, children who were about 121 days old at the winter virus peak also had the greatest risk of developing asthma. Similarly, seasonal epidemiological analysis has been used to demonstrate that infantile wheezing illnesses during HRV seasons are important predictors of the development of persistent wheezing and asthma later in childhood.7 , 12 These studies suggest the possibility that respiratory virus infections in early childhood contribute to asthma causality.\n\nAnother recent study reached the opposite conclusion. Thomsen and colleagues investigated the relationship between RSV infections requiring hospitalization and the development of asthma by applying genetic variance and direction of causation models to a large twin registry in Denmark. 13 Based on this work, the authors conclude that RSV infections severe enough to result in hospitalization are an indicator of genetic predisposition, rather than a causal factor, for asthma. The apparent disparities between these informative, high quality studies with regard to the direction of causation between severe RSV infections and asthma suggest that resolving this controversy may require prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled interventional studies, e.g., using prophylactic RSV-specific monoclonal antibody therapy.\n\nThe incorporation of improved viral diagnostics into long-term studies suggests that the type of virus causing the wheezing illness could be a significant indicator of asthma risk. For example, there is evidence from several studies that wheezing illnesses with HRV may be associated with an especially high risk of subsequent childhood asthma, 6, 7 , 14 especially in children with early clinical or laboratory indicators of atopy.6 ,7 Further research is needed to determine whether other viruses (e.g., parainfluenza viruses, metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, bocaviruses, adenoviruses, and influenza viruses) differ in their capacity to influence the development of asthma. To what extent viral infections alone impart an increased risk for wheezing after infancy or whether allergen sensitization and exposure during early childhood are critical determinants of the response to these infections and the development of asthma are important questions.\n\nUnderlying current research efforts with regard to the role of host factors in asthma onset is the hypothesis that a variety of host factors, many of which are governed by host genetics, will influence the risk of virus-induced wheeze in early life and the subsequent development of childhood asthma. It is important to understand how host factors modify relationships between early life viral respiratory infections and the development of wheezing illnesses and childhood asthma. Identifying risk factors that determine which infants and young children are most likely to wheeze with infections and the role of these infections in the genesis of asthma has been the focus of intense investigation. In this regard, the relative importance of (1) lower lung volumes at birth, especially in those born prematurely, (2) the atopic status of infants, (3) the intensity of mucus secretion in response to infection, (4) neurotrophic pathways critical to airway hyperresponsiveness provoked by infection, 15 and (5) the ability of infants who wheeze to generate immune responses to viral pathogens, including the production of interferon-\u03b3 and type I and III interferons, remain important areas of research. Overall, it will be important to identify host genetic factors that influence the developing pulmonary and immune systems because maturational delays in host airways and antiviral responses could increase the risk of developing virus-induced wheeze and childhood asthma. That is, differences in the maturational level of airways and the immune system could render some infants and children more susceptible to the development of respiratory virus-initiated, persistent airway sequelae. Alternatively, it is possible that virus-induced wheezing episodes may be a marker for individuals predisposed to asthma because of delays in airway and immune system development.\n\nInvestigation of other host factors, such as nutritional status and response to medications, should also be a priority. Notably, several studies have linked vitamin D status to the risk of developing asthma and also to susceptibility to infectious respiratory illnesses. 16 In addition, an association between acetaminophen use and increased risk for childhood asthma onset has been reported, but because of the confounding factor that this drug is used for fever reduction in childhood viral respiratory infections, randomized controlled clinical trials would be needed to define this risk. 17 It also would be useful to determine whether differential host responses to acetaminophen could modify this potential risk.\n\nAfter 3 years of age, viral respiratory infections and allergy synergistically increase the risk of acute wheezing and exacerbations of childhood asthma. 6, 10, 18 The extent to which the allergic inflammation alters innate antiviral responses in the airway epithelium is also of significant interest. The use of animal models, in vitro experiments, and experimental challenges with HRV and other viruses can provide additional mechanistic insights into interactions between viral infections and respiratory allergies. A promising area of investigation involves the examination of immune system mediators and pathways that intersect allergen-and virusinduced inflammatory responses, e.g., the thymic stromal lymphopoietin and toll-like receptor pathways.\n\nRecent evidence points to impaired innate interferon responses in the airway of asthmatic subjects as a risk factor for asthma exacerbations, although this is controversial. These findings have renewed interest into whether host variations in RNA sensing pathways (e.g., toll-like receptor 3, RIG-I) affect illness outcomes and perhaps asthma. DNA viruses such as bocaviruses can also cause wheezing illnesses, and this indicates that variations in DNA sensing pathways (e.g., toll-like receptor 9 and DNA protein kinase) should also be considered. Whether genetic polymorphisms in these DNA and RNA sensing pathways affect host responses to respiratory viruses needs to be addressed. Different phenotypes of asthma may have different mechanisms of susceptibility to virusinduced exacerbations. Brittle asthma, severe asthma, non-atopic asthma, refractory asthma, frequent exacerbators, and other distinct asthma phenotypes may all possess unique mechanisms of susceptibility to virus-induced exacerbations. In addition, recurrent exacerbations may alter the natural history of asthma by accelerating the loss of lung function. Additional host factors that could alter susceptibility of asthmatic subjects to virus-induced exacerbations include age, gender, nutrition, smoking, stress, and concomitant diseases that may affect the innate and adaptive immune systems.\n\nDoes viral strain make a difference in relation to the development of wheezing illnesses and asthma or the risk of exacerbation? HRV, the principal trigger of asthma exacerbations at all ages, has over 100 canonical serotypes and many new strains of HRV-C. Its genome is a single strand of RNA with 7,200 bases and its RNA polymerase has a high error rate (approximately 1 in 10 4 bases), which may contribute to HRV sequence variability. 19 Because HRV infections not only cause asthma exacerbations, but are associated with asthma onset in young children, it is tempting to hypothesize that certain strains are \"asthmagenic\". Accordingly, recent studies in murine models have shown that different isolates of RSV can vary significantly with regard to their virulence and mucogenicity. 20 If this is the case for HRV, targeting vaccination to a few HRV strains could possibly help prevent exacerbations, or even prevent development of asthma. Determination of pathogenicity factors from more virulent strains could provide new targets for antiviral therapy.\n\nGiven the evidence showing associations between viral respiratory infections early in life and the subsequent development of asthma, understanding the role that environmental influences in infancy may have on the outcomes of these infections represents an important area of future investigation. Factors to be considered would include the manner in which early life exposures to environmental factors, such as allergens, microbial flora, and air pollutants, may influence the development of the immune system and lungs and modulate subsequent responses to viral respiratory infections.\n\nStudies to determine the adverse effects of air pollutants (e.g., environmental tobacco smoke, ozone, and diesel fuel exhaust) on the asthmatic airway highlight the complexity of trying to understand the pathogenesis and persistence of asthma exacerbations in both children and adults. To what extent these environmental exposures interact with airway inflammation initiated by respiratory tract infections and/or allergen exposure, and the mechanisms involved, needs further investigation. Studies evaluating concurrent personal exposures to different risk factors and their interactions are needed. \"Environomics\", i.e., synchronous evaluation of different environmental as well as genetic factors, may be able to help individualize treatment. 21 Taken together, these studies could direct the development of new therapeutics (e.g., antiviral, antiinflammatory, or both) and identify target populations of asthmatic children and adults who will benefit most from new and existing treatment strategies.\n\nAlthough viruses and bacteria are usually considered separately, it is possible that bacteria interact with respiratory cold viruses to alter outcomes of respiratory infections in asthmatic individuals. However, little is known about the role of secondary bacterial infections in increasing the severity and persistence of symptoms. Until recently our knowledge of microbes was restricted only to culturable organisms. New molecular tools and microarrays are being developed for detection of practically all known viruses 22 and bacteria, 23 including thousands of organisms that were previously unknown; these evolving technologies and bioinformatic tools are being used to study the airway microbiome. A better understanding of the airway microbiome, including interactions of microorganisms with respiratory viruses, may shed new light on the development of asthma and the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations. It is possible that there are specific patterns of infections and/or colonization that modify airway development, physiology, and the risk of asthma. In fact, there is recent evidence that the establishment of intestinal flora in infants contributes to immune development, and that this process may influence the development of allergic diseases, and perhaps the quality of antiviral responses. 24 Studies of microbial flora in the gut, skin, and respiratory tract should provide new insights into these relationships, and perhaps provide another strategy for prevention of allergic diseases and asthma. 23\n\nThe best way to determine whether viral lower respiratory tract infections in infancy cause asthma would be to perform a clinical trial using an effective antiviral intervention given prophylactically. Currently, there are no approved vaccines for RSV or HRV that could be used in such a study. However, the results of two nonrandomized studies of passive immunization to RSV in early life suggest that preventing severe RSV infection in infancy using monoclonal antibodies might reduce subsequent asthma. 25, 26 However, randomized and placebo-controlled study designs are needed to definitively answer this question. Similar studies with other respiratory viruses, such as HRV, await the development of safe and effective antivirals or vaccines. The high rates of exposure to these viruses early in life and the relative immaturity of the neonatal immune system will make effective vaccination difficult, and will require the development of novel vaccination strategies or technology. 27 Safe antiviral agents may eventually become as important as antibiotics in changing the microbiological landscape and associated respiratory morbidity. A variety of novel therapeutics, including inhibitors of attachment to host cells, viral protease inhibitors, and inhibitors of viral replication, are at various stages of development. 27 However, there are several challenges to this approach since the time between the onset of cold symptoms and deterioration of lung function can be short, and the development of viral resistance must be considered. For specific antiviral therapies to be implemented into clinical practice, it also may be necessary to develop accurate, affordable, and rapid viral diagnostics. Viral diagnostics may not be needed during periods in which one virus is especially prevalent (e.g., fall HRV infections), when a specific viral syndrome is readily recognizable (e.g., influenza-like illness in January), or if broad-spectrum antiviral agents can be developed.\n\nNotwithstanding the potential of new therapies, considerable improvement may result from optimization of currently available ones. Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs such as inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene antagonists can reduce the risk of exacerbations by 40% to 50%, and this suggests that moderating inflammation may reduce the chances that a cold will precipitate bronchospasm. The mechanism for this reduction in risk is not known and further exploration may lead to new treatments to prevent exacerbations. Examples of possible mechanisms include reduction in the number of inflammatory cells that could amplify responses to virus infection, regeneration of the airway epithelial barrier after removal of chronic epithelial damage caused by products of allergic inflammation, and restoration of normal epithelial innate immunity after alteration by allergic inflammatory mediators.\n\nAdditional research is needed to determine the effects of current asthma controllers on virusinduced exacerbations. Because viral respiratory infections and allergen exposure, in allergensensitized individuals, may combine to increase the risk of asthma exacerbations, 28 therapies targeting allergic airway inflammation, such as anti-IgE treatment, may be promising for allergic individuals prone to virus-induced exacerbations. Also, macrolides deserve more attention as possible antiinflammatory agents targeting exacerbations. While pharmacogenetics is expected to offer personalized solutions in the future, there are currently many attempts to characterize asthma phenotypes in a clinical sense, using, among other criteria, virus-induced exacerbations as a key component. Consequently, it is possible that interventions should be tailored to specific phenotypes. Notably, recent placebo-controlled trials suggest that neither high-dose inhaled nor oral corticosteroids are suitable for virusinduced wheezing in infancy. 29, 30 It is possible that asthma controllers could be of benefit to specific subsets of infants. 31, 32 Study designs evaluating individual responses to controller medications can highlight differential treatment responses. 33 Among other issues, continuous versus on-demand pharmacotherapy for exacerbations should be re-evaluated for different asthma phenotypes. Recent efforts to perform comprehensive studies investigating immunologic, virologic, and physiologic measures in the lower airways of asthmatic individuals during viral infections will help to inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. 34 Strategies aiming at reduction of respiratory virus exposure achievable by simple means such as hand washing can have a significant impact on morbidity, further suggesting the need for including focused educational programs as part of exacerbation management.\n\nRodent models of infections with respiratory viruses, such as parainfluenza (Sendai) virus and RSV, have provided great insights into cellular immune responses to infection and potential mechanisms relating viral infection in young animals to long-term changes in lung structure and function. Recently, rodent models of infection with HRV and a related picornavirus (mengovirus) have been developed that may help to explore areas of HRV biology that have been difficult to evaluate in either in vitro or clinical models. [35] [36] [37] More studies are needed to characterize in detail the innate epithelial response to viral infection under different conditions and to explore effects on infectious outcomes of cofactors such as allergic inflammation, epithelial damage, and pollutants. Studies of differentiated human epithelium or organ culture of lung or sinus tissue may be helpful for these experiments. Finally, continued advances in microarray technology, genome-wide association studies, systems biology, and other highthroughput technologies provide important avenues for future investigations.\n\nWhile important gaps remain in our current knowledge regarding the role of respiratory virus infections in the inception and exacerbation of asthma (Table II) , it is clear that recent advances in investigatory tools and approaches are beginning to allow investigators to make important inroads toward discerning the complex interplay of host, viral, developmental, and environmental factors in these processes. Defining these processes has the potential to provide a mechanistic foundation for the development of new, more effective approaches for the prevention and treatment of virus-induced wheezing illnesses and asthma exacerbations, as well as the longer term goal of developing effective strategies for the primary prevention of asthma. \u2022 Requires sequence information to synthesize primers and probes for target viruses\n\nExtremely sensitive, can detect as little as one copy of the genome"}
