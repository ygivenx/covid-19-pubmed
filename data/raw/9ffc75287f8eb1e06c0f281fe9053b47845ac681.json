{"title": "Pandemic influenza communication: views from a deliberative forum", "body": "Governments around the world rely upon pandemic influenza (PI) planning to protect their countries against the potentially devastating impact of a pandemic. Communication has been recognized as a critical part of PI planning. Authorities including the World Health Organisation (WHO) have issued guidelines, claiming that communication expertise is as important as epidemiological and laboratory expertise for control of outbreaks. 1 Specific PI-related communication strategies in national PI plans 2 are complemented by a burgeoning literature on risk communication, [3] [4] [5] together with analyses of communication in previous crises such as the 2003 outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 6, 7 and Hurricane Katrina. 8, 9 There is growing consensus about principles of risk and crisis communication, embracing concepts such as trustworthiness, transparency, responsiveness, respect, candour and practicality. 1, 10, 11 This literature provides a foundation for governments developing their own PI communication strategies, such as the Communication Strategy Overview 12 published as an annex to the Australian government\u00d5s Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza. 13 There is, however, an additional source of expertise that can contribute to pandemic communication planning: the public. Their views can be accessed in a variety of ways, each with strengths and weaknesses. 14 Deliberative forums are one method of tapping into the community to explore approaches to an issue or problem. 15 Deliberative methods provide opportunities for citizens to articulate and share values. 15, 16 Forums are similar to citizens\u00d5 juries in that a population sample deliberates about an issue after receiving expert information. 17 Like juries, forums share the theoretical assumption that, given enough information about a topic, a small group can provide views that are informed and reflective of community values.\n\nThis study reports results from the \u00d4FluViews\u00d5 project which used deliberative methods to obtain community views about issues related to PI planning. One 2-day forum held in 2008 elicited views on communication and quarantine \u2044 social distancing measures in a pandemic; the results relating to communication are reported here. In choosing the format of the forum, we recognized, given the complexity of the issues presented by pandemic management, that the forum should explore \u00d4the social construction that influences people\u00d5s decision mak-ing\u00d5 15 and must allow for divergent views. \u00d4FluVIews\u00d5 was overseen by a steering group of policy makers and academic experts working in PI planning and infectious diseases.\n\nA market research company from the Adelaide metropolitan area recruited forum members to fulfil these criteria:\n\n\u2022 Sex: 50% female.\n\n\u2022 Age: one-third each from age ranges 18-34, 35-54 and 55+. \u2022 Employment: 50% in paid work.\n\n\u2022 Household income: 50% below $800 \u2044 week.\n\nPotential members were randomly selected from a database weighted by age, sex and geographical location to reflect accurately the South Australian population. 18 Recruiting continued until all places were filled. Forum members received an honorarium of AUD$300 and travel expenses.\n\nAvailable evidence about PI and communication, collated using systematic literature reviews, was summarized for members in twopage modules written in simple language. The topics were: seasonal influenza, PI and future pandemic risks; logistical, political and policy issues related to communication about health and emergencies; effectiveness of strategies for pandemic communication; and related ethical issues. Strenuous efforts were made to ensure that the reviews were systematic and balanced. Where evidence was contentious the forum was informed about the nature of the controversy, the range of views in the peer reviewed literature and the strength of available evidence. The modules were evaluated and ultimately approved by all members of the steering group.\n\nThe forum met in a hotel meeting room over 2 days, with 1 day devoted to the question: What is an acceptable framework for communication in an influenza pandemic? Members sat around a single table, where they were joined by experts in infectious disease, ethics and public policy. There were fewer experts and observers than forum members. Members were asked to act as \u00d4citizens\u00d5 and \u00d4community representatives\u00d5 rather than as \u00d4individuals\u00d5 in the deliberation and decision-making process. A trained independent facilitator called experts and refocused discussion as necessary.\n\nThe forum reflected on the questions using progressive scenarios that moved through a hypothetical PI outbreak in Australia (see Box 1) . Prior to discussion of each scenario, there were short accessible and interactive presentations by the experts with on-going opportunities for members to ask questions. At each stage, members deliberated on what, how and when the community should be told about PI and by whom. The facilitator supported individual reflection, discussion in small groups, brainstorming and whole group discussion. Participants were encouraged to state and discuss their views, seek further information from experts, and then reach a broad consensus in their responses. Care was taken to demonstrate respect for the members\u00d5 views.\n\nMaterial was recorded on an electronic whiteboard to facilitate brainstorming and reaching consensus. A professional reporter with back-up voice recording transcribed forum deliberations verbatim. No formal votes were taken on specific recommendations.\n\nThe data consisted of copies of white board screens containing forum recommendations, anonymized transcripts and contemporaneous notes. The transcripts were checked by one author (WR) to add depth to the recommendations with illustrative comments and these were cross-checked against an independent summary of the data prepared by JS. Current Australian PI communication strategies were evaluated against the forum\u00d5s responses.\n\nThe Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Adelaide approved this study.\n\nParticipant characteristics are in Table 1 . Table 2 lists the summary recommendations that were developed by the group as agreed and recorded on the whiteboard. Table 3 contains a more detailed outline of the results presented by Information was provided about the current world situation including the potential for pandemic influenza, the limited evidence for communication strategies, political and ethical issues associated with communication, and international recommendations Scenario 2: During the pandemic -containment stage\n\nThis was a hypothetical scenario of an international outbreak of pandemic influenza, predominately in Indonesia and Vietnam. The first Australian cases are in a NSW family who holidayed in Bali. The 19-year-old daughter has died, and suspected cases have been reported in the family\u00d5s suburb in northern Sydney. Contact tracing is underway and some people have been asked to remain in voluntary isolation or quarantine. The epidemiology of this influenza strain is unknown although it appears to affect all ages. At this stage the spread of the virus is highly localized Scenario 3: During the pandemic -maintenance stage This was a hypothetical scenario set in week 5 of a full pandemic. The influenza virus is now widespread throughout most major capital and regional centres in Australia. What information should the public receive about PI? Scenario 1: Before a pandemic (see Box 1) Participants were surprised at their lack of knowledge or awareness of H5N1 and the potential for PI. They recommended three topics of public information for this phase: the current situation and its implications; information about PI; and information about seasonal influenza: \u2026not many people are aware of the situa-tion\u2026and, for example, I could ask my three children a bit about the bird flu and how aware they are of that in other countries, and I\u00d5m sure they couldn\u00d5t give me much of an answer. (Ross, p5: [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Pandemic influenza was seen to be a potentially confusing and frightening topic that could be managed by provision of detailed information: I think people need to know the truth. Not watered down or sensationalised, just the truth. (Nanette p [7] [8] The forum recommended comprehensive information:\n\nFirst, you need to explain what a pandemic is and what is the flu and what is the current disease sit-uation\u2026Then, explain to people how they can prepare themselves by vaccinations and general hygiene, and explain who is more at risk, like the young and the elderly, and maybe what is the government\u00d5s plan to stop the pandemic killing everyone. (Tayla p6: [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Providing information about seasonal influenza was seen as an opportunity to link this to PI, with a focus on the importance of personal hygiene:\n\nIt\u00d5s about getting people into the habit of doing it so when the big scary stuff comes they are already in the habit. (Karen p15: [28] [29] [30] The discussion revealed confusion over vaccination for seasonal influenza, and the need for more public information about potential benefits of higher vaccination rates for the community and employers:\n\n\u2026how aware are people about flu shots?\u2026People are not aware of even the current situation with flu shots. (Ross p14: [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Members distinguished between providing information to raise awareness of the potential for Participants unanimously recommended that information about a first or index case should be released by someone in authority. There was some discussion about privacy, with the consensus being to identify the location by suburb:\n\nIn this case it\u00d5s a highly contagious virus and it kills people. Privacy aside, people need to know. (Nanette p49: 27-28) The forum justified this recommendation due to the severity of the threat, the need for accurate and credible information, and the potential for rapid spread:\n\nIt\u00d5s like being forewarned about a tornado coming, you can take preventative measures, you can buy up 20 l of water or 3 weeks\u00d5 worth of food. (Neil p47: [8] [9] [10] Participants discussed the role of the media and a possible media ban to protect privacy of those affected by PI, but finally agreed that a ban would be counter productive as media cooperation would be necessary for transmitting other information about the pandemic. The forum indicated the importance of accurate information during this potentially chaotic pandemic phase: I want to make sure the information I am getting is correct coming from heaps of different sources. (Matt p75: [23] [24] How should this information be communicated? Scenario 1: Before a pandemic (see Box 1) The forum raised obvious but important points about communication methods, such as the need for clear and simple language, and developing awareness and understanding over time, so that if and when a pandemic occurs, people will be prepared.\n\nTelevision was recommended for a number of roles including: updates on PI; in-depth interviews with experts; advertisements about further sources of information; and advertisements about seasonal influenza to foster community attitudes about preventive measures:\n\nIf there was an ad on TV saying \u00d4Thanks for getting your flu shot\u00d5, that would encourage me in the next year. (Karen p13: [31] [32] Other recommendations included posters in community settings (e.g. libraries), council newsletters, government websites and distribution of household leaflets. One novel idea was for reputable non-government organizations, such as the Red Cross, to provide face-to-face explanations:\n\n\u2026a large organisation like Red Cross\u2026go and door-knock and explain to the people in that street, were they aware of what this was and it was a possible thing that was coming to Australia, but not to alarm them but do it through a large organisation, a large respected company like Red Cross. (Ross p5: 36-42) Education of school children was seen as a way of raising awareness and developing a cohort of informed and prepared future citizens:\n\n\u2026it\u00d5s about making sure the education is continuous, so they bring it up into their adulthood. (Jane p19: [4] [5] [6] The forum recommended communication with specific groups, including young people (using internet sites such as Facebook, MySpace or YouTube), rural and remote communities, people with physical or mental disabilities, and working people. Regional television was viewed as an important resource for reaching remote communities, as were existing services such as outback visiting ministers.\n\nAlongside these recommendations about methods, participants argued that information should accumulate gradually, without repetition, to develop community expertise.\n\nNews about an Australian case could be broadcast as part of any existing regular PI updates, because a sensitized population would understand the implications. In the absence of adequate background information, participants thought that only significant media attention would alert people to the potential threat:\n\nI don\u00d5t think I would be too concerned until it is on every channel of TV\u2026 (Tayla p44: 21) They recommended that information be provided via government announcements in the media and on government websites, plus a wellpublicized dedicated hotline. Radio was also identified as a valuable communication medium in an emergency:\n\nThe handy thing with radio is you can have batteries, whereas television, if the power goes out\u2026 (Bill p68: [31] [32] Who should communicate? Scenario 1: Before a pandemic (see Box 1) The forum identified the need for media spokespeople who would be trusted by the Australian community: experts rather than politicians; and the involvement of internationally recognized authorities such as the WHO:\n\nYou would listen to the big guns, wouldn\u00d5t you? You would take it seriously if they [WHO] are getting involved. (Karen p23: [14] [15] General practitioners were identified as important sources of information:\n\n\u2026when you go to the GP, the GP is able to give far more information to the individuals in educating them and pamphlets and stuff like that. (Jane p3: 43-45) As discussed above, non-government organizations were considered to be trustworthy for unsolicited information.\n\nThere was consensus that communication should not be used for political point scoring, and that it was a government responsibility to inform the public and provide information through a range of channels.\n\nScenario 2: During the pandemic -containment stage (see Box 1) As with Scenario 1, the forum recommended an official spokesperson or expert with authority as the appropriate person to make announcements. It was suggested that information from affected individuals would also be effective: Are we going to wait? Is it only important when it\u00d5s here?\u2026What I am saying is it needs to be important now, because when it\u00d5s here there is no time to plan and do all that\u2026 (Karen p24: 38-42) As described above, the forum recommended a sophisticated approach to the question of when information should be communicated. Prior to an outbreak the emphasis should be upon raising awareness of the potential problem and sources of further information. Detailed information would only be necessary once a pandemic was imminent.\n\nScenario 2: During the pandemic -containment stage (see Box 1) The members recommended that Australians be informed as soon as there were confirmed cases in Australia, due to the serious nature of PI and the potential for rapid spread.\n\nScenario 3: During the pandemic -maintenance stage (see Box 1) At this stage, participants felt that information should be available continuously and updated frequently.\n\nThroughout the day, members commented on the fact that, until their involvement in this project, they had known little about either the threat of PI or about existing government planning. This was seen as problematic:\n\nWhat is the point of having them [government preparations] if people don\u00d5t know about them, some of those things?\u2026I didn\u00d5t know any of that. It\u00d5s nice to know they have done stuff. (Karen p32: 33-43)\n\nThe forum\u00d5s recommendations about the content of communication during a pandemic are largely consistent with the strategies described in the Australian government Communication Strategy Overview (hereafter the Strategy). 12 In particular, the key objectives (see Box 2) are similar to forum recommendations, focusing initially on building awareness followed by practical information about minimizing personal and community risks, and what to do if affected. These objectives are supported by the literature on information strategies to effect behaviour change 4,11 and reduce public anxiety and criticism. 10 There are, however, some notable differences. First, the forum wanted full and frank information about the potential risk and international developments including numbers of cases and fatalities. It is not clear whether the Stage 1 key message \u00d4What is the current disease situa-tion\u00d5 anticipates this level of detail. Given the level of prior knowledge amongst participants, either such detail is not planned, or the strategy to date has been unsuccessful. 19 There is evidence that people do want the truth during a crisis, even if this is bleak. 10 Providing information about the potentially deadly nature of an infection increases concern in the population which is associated with taking precautions to protect against infection. 20 Second, although forum members understood that predictions about PI were uncertain, this did not lead to loss of confidence in the experts or the information they imparted. This is consistent with findings that acknowledging uncertainty can increase public confidence. 21 Information about communicating uncertainty is currently absent from the Strategy.\n\nThird, the forum recommended releasing geographically localizing information about initial cases. The Strategy does not indicate how information about individual cases will be handled. In general, health departments maintain confidentiality, releasing information only if this will prevent further cases. Despite recognizing this, forum members argued that the magnitude and severity of the threat justified release of potentially identifying information.\n\nDiscussions about breaking the news of Australian cases of PI exposed a range of perceptions about distance. A threat in a city 1700-km distant was seen by some as quite proximate but by others as distant and hence less significant, indicating that awareness of varying perceptions about the significance of distance is important in communication about PI.\n\nFor communication methods, the Strategy relies upon the Australian Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA) website, its toll-free telephone line, and media activities including interviews, special articles on prevention, and public announcements. To date, these methods of communication appear unsuccessful in developing a base level of awareness, as per our partic-ipants\u00d5 comments. As of September 2008, the PI toll-free number is difficult to locate on the DoHA website (it appears on the avian influenza, rather than the PI website). Toll-free numbers were heavily utilized during SARS, 22 indicating their potential contribution in a pandemic.\n\nThe forum\u00d5s recommendations for education through schools are important for developing community-wide expertise about and good habits in infection control and personal hygiene. The Strategy does not take a whole of community approach that includes school activities.\n\n[We note that the South Australian Department of Health has instigated a hand hygiene campaign (Wash, wipe, cover) for schools as part of its PI planning.] The recommendation to build awareness of seasonal influenza through feedback and \u00d4thank you\u00d5 messages deserves consideration as a way of supporting related messages in the Strategy. Using volunteers from organizations such as Red Cross to provide doorto-door information highlights the potential contribution of the volunteer sector in a pandemic, a group not mentioned in the Strategy. The forum was in disagreement about the value of distributing household leaflets, but interestingly, despite thinking this ineffective, most members remembered recent government information leaflets delivered to their homes.\n\nThe forum recommended increasing use of television and websites, including those targeting youth and rural and remote groups as the pandemic developed. This is consistent with plans for a national information campaign, with media activities intensifying as infection spreads.\n\nResearch following the SARS outbreak found that television was the primary source of information in China; 23 this is similar to US data unrelated to SARS. 7 The internet emerged as a new method of emergency health communication during SARS. 6, 24 Information found online can change health-related behaviour. 25 Australians increasingly use the internet for news 26 indicating that it may be an effective medium for PI communication.\n\nThe literature is uniform about the need for consistent messages as a key feature of effective communication. 27 Inconsistency can affect compliance with public health directives 28 and lead to public distrust. 29 The Strategy identifies Australia\u00d5s Chief Medical Officer as the principal spokesperson, with additional contributions from Ministers including the Prime Minister, an approach that may ensure consistency. Unlike the Strategy and some commentators, 30 the forum did not recommend a single spokesperson, but rather a range of people including experts and personalities, to make the message \u00d4real\u00d5. Members argued that politicians may not be trusted, but that Ministerial level spokespeople would add gravitas in tandem with more trustworthy experts. Experience from SARS demonstrates the success of multiple voices 31, 32 Pandemic influenza communication, W A Rogers et al. particularly in expanding the audience, as long as messages remain uniform.\n\nFinally, there is the issue of when to communicate. Our forum recommended immediate activities to educate and build awareness and swift action if and when Australia has its first cases of PI. This is consistent with other pandemic experiences including the 1918 influenza in which early implementation of multiple interventions was associated with reduced disease transmission. 33 The WHO notes that it is impossible to keep outbreaks hidden; accordingly, it recommends early official announcement to minimize rumours and misinformation. 1 Some commentators believe that too much information can lead to people switching off or getting \u00d4pandemic fatigue\u00d5. 3 This danger was recognised by the forum who argued for a campaign that built up community expertise without losing the audience. The Strategy does not indicate how rapidly information would be made public during the various communication stages, but there is no suggestion that information would be withheld.\n\nDeliberative methods aim to access individuals\u00d5 expertise as community members to provide views and recommendations about policy. Our forum was composed of randomly selected participants, who were provided with information that they were encouraged to discuss before reaching their recommendations. In these aspects, it resembled a citizens\u00d5 jury. There were however, differences. Our forum was asked for their views about communication needs, rather than asked to choose or prioritize amongst options as commonly occurs with juries. In addition, the forum did not deliberate in private to reach ordered or unanimous recommendations. This decision was partly pragmatic as PI communication is a broad topic for which there is little hard evidence about effective strategies. It was also influenced by our desire to seek the maximum information possible given the relative expense of staging a forum. At times, it was difficult for the forum to remain focussed on the questions, leading to recommendations less clear cut than, for example, ordering a set of healthcare priorities. Members of the forum were very curious about PI leading to an occasional blurring of the distinction between their requests for information (as forum members) and their views about information recommended for the public. A more formal process would have avoided this problem; however, this may have been at risk of losing some of the range of views expressed.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, we believe that the deliberative forum is a valuable method for eliciting informed community views and values to inform PI planning and policy. In contrast to focus groups, which also seek a wide range of views, the length and format of the forum meant that participants based their deliberations upon a large amount of specialised information. Our forum met key principles proposed for public participation processes: 14 it was a demographically representative sample, provided with information that was accessible and comprehensive, conducted in a respectful way with clear procedural rules. The results of the forums have been provided on request to the Pandemic Influenza Sub-committee of the Coalition of Australian Governments and have been presented at international conferences and meetings.\n\nEffective communication is critical for the successful implementation of PI plans. As each public health emergency and each pandemic occurs in its own unique context, it is difficult to move beyond theoretical principles of communication. Planners and policy makers therefore face challenges in developing evidence-based communication strategies. A deliberative forum provides one avenue for seeking informed community views on PI communication planning. The recommendations of the forum are consistent with the literature on pandemic communication strategies and, to a large extent, with the current Australian Strategy. This finding confers some confidence in the Strategy whilst also providing valuable feedback together with sug- Using a forum to deliberate on a broad topic such as PI communication is innovative. We have demonstrated that this method can be used to elicit informed recommendations that are relevant for policy and planning. Using a forum rather than other methods such as focus groups ensured that participant deliberations were based upon the best available evidence and local expertise, thereby ensuring relevant recommendations."}
