{"title": "Brief Report", "body": "States to notify all events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). 1 All cases of smallpox, wild-type poliovirus, novel subtypes of human influenza virus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome must be notified; events that meet two of the four following criteria also must be notified: (1) the event has a serious public health impact; (2) the event is unusual or unexpected;\n\n(3) there is a significant risk of international spread; and (4) there is a significant risk of international travel or trade restrictions. 2 A decision-making tool to assist countries in determining whether to notify is provided in Annex 2 of IHR (2005). Member countries report to WHO via a designated National IHR Focal Point (NFP); NFPs communicate to WHO through the designated WHO IHR Contact Point at regional offices. 3 This report provides feedback to the Western Pacific Region on the types of communications and events notified under IHR by disease and country. Significant public health events in the region communicated via IHR from 2007 to 2009 were summarized from internal reports, and an assessment was conducted of information in the dedicated IHR e-mail inbox of the WHO Regional Office of the Western Pacific from January 2010 to June 2013. Other methods of IHR communications which may contribute additional information on IHR mechanisms in the Region were not included. ability of participants to communicate via IHR and notify appropriately. A global assessment of the implementation of IHR revealed that 88% of the 69% of Member States that responded to a survey reported excellent or good knowledge of Annex 2, and 77% reported always or usually using Annex 2 to assess public health events. 5 The regional exercise and global survey both suggest that IHR mechanisms are acceptable to Member States.\n\nThe majority of events communicated through IHR in the Western Pacific Region were infectious disease outbreaks, with significant increases in volume due to human infection with three novel influenza virusespandemic influenza A(H1N1), avian influenza A(H5N1) and avian influenza A(H7N9) -as well as a radionuclear event in Japan. Member States not reporting may not have had an event meeting the criteria for notification or may lack capacity in surveillance and detection of events.\n\nNone declared. WHO regional IHR e-mail also facilitates notifications and contact tracing of infectious cases between NFPs. From 2010, 27 such contact-tracing requests were made; including five for tuberculosis, three for measles related to international flights and one for measles at a resort with international guests. A further 30 communications were sent to advise the WHO Regional Office that successful contact had been made between countries where at least one country was in the Region. IHR communications also included 22 food safety issues and/or recalls from the International Food Safety Authorities Network and approximately 50 requests for information from Member States about significant public health issues occurring elsewhere in the Region.\n\nTo test IHR procedures, especially for those countries and areas that have not notified to date, WHO conducts an annual regional exercise, \"IHR Exercise Crystal.\" 4 In December 2012, 21 of 27 NFPs in the Region participated, with over 86% using Annex 2 of IHR (2005) to determine that the exercise scenario required IHR notification; 15 completed the notification within the allocated five-hour time period. The exercise also identified e-mail as the most reliable communication method. 4 Sites unable to particip ate cited unexpected conflicts, real public health emergencies or other reasons for non-participation. 4 (See report for full details and recommendations.)
