{"title": "Impact of LbSapSal Vaccine in Canine Immunological and Parasitological Features before and after Leishmania chagasi-Challenge", "body": "Leishmania infantum (syn. L. chagasi) is an intracellular protozoon that cause a severe systemic disease named visceral leishmaniasis (VL) [1]. It is widely distributed in the Mediterranean Basin, Middle East, and South America. VL has an annual incidence of approximately 500,000 cases [2]. Brazil declared a total of 50,060 clinical VL cases between 1990 and 2006, and this number accounts for 90% of all reported VL cases in the Americas; however, it is subject to substantial under-reporting [3].\n\nDifferent geographical regions of the globe where visceral leishmaniasis is endemic, present the dogs as main reservoir for the L. chagasi that play a relevant role in transmission of the parasite [4,5]. Dogs are also excellent models for the study of VL because the natural history of the disease in dogs and in humans is similar [6], especially regarding parasite\u2013host interaction, immune response, and the development of new vaccines [7]. The natural history of canine VL (CVL) has been well-described, particularly in regard to the parasite load in different tissues and the immunopathological changes according to progression of clinical forms [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17].\n\nA vaccine against CVL would be an important tool in the control of VL and would decrease the anxiety associated with L. chagasi infection in humans [18]. The induction of long-lasting cell-mediated immune response triggering high levels of protection against CVL is considered as prerequisite of an ideal vaccine for controlling the L. chagasi transmission. Different vaccine candidates against CVL have been reported showing the ability to induce immunoprotective mechanisms [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27].\n\nIn this sense, it has been shown that Leishmune\u00ae (fucose manose ligand plus saponin as adjuvant; Zoetis, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) presented 95% protection in a phase III study [28]. Leishmune\u00ae provided protection associated with the ability to trigger early and persistent activation of neutrophils and monocytes, in addition to activation of T CD4+ and T CD8+ lymphocytes displaying high levels of IFN-\u03b3 in the CD4+ T-cell subset [29,30]. Additionally, the Leish-Tec\u00ae vaccine (Hertape Calier, Juatuba, Brazil; A2 antigen plus saponin as adjuvant) has also been shown to induce increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 in four out of seven dogs with L. chagasi-infected bone marrow [21]. More recently, a vaccine composed of excreted/secreted antigens of L. infantum promastigotes, referred as LiESAp has been shown to induce increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 and nitric oxide (NO), thus supporting its leishmanicidal effect [31]. The efficacy of the LiESAp vaccine was reported as 92% in a double-blind randomized study [19]. LiESAp is commercially available as CaniLeish\u00ae (Virbac, Carros, France) and is able to induce a Th1 profile and reduce the parasitic load of infected macrophages co-cultured with lymphocytes from immunized dogs [32].\n\nThe LbSap (L. braziliensis crude antigens plus saponin as adjuvant) and \u201cLbSapSal\u201d (L. braziliensis crude antigens plus saponin as adjuvant and Lutzomyia longipalpis saliva) vaccines against CVL has also shown to induce a strong immune-mediated response. The LbSap and \u201cLbSapSal\u201d presented higher levels of circulating T-cell subsets (CD4+, CD8+) and B lymphocytes (CD21+), as well as Leishmania-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells [20,22,25,27]. Furthermore, LBSap-vaccinated dogs presented high IFN-\u03b3 and low interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 expression in the spleen, resulting in a significant reduction of parasite load in this tissue [25]. Additionally, LbSap has been shown to induce a prominent pro-inflammatory immune response characterized by increased levels of both IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 and decreased levels of TGF-\u03b2 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which were associated with parasite control in dogs [26].\n\nThe incorporation of salivary proteins of sand flies have been widely used in experimental challenge studies, and the results suggest that this could be a good strategy to protect against Leishmania infection [22,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41]. Previous studies of dogs using the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d vaccine displayed higher counts of circulating and Leishmania-specific CD8+ T cells in addition to high nitric oxide (NO) production [22] and reduction of splenic parasite load [27]. Considering the inclusion of saliva from sand flies as a promising compound in vaccines against Leishmania infection, we describe additional biomarkers induced by the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d vaccine in dogs. We considered the previous vaccine protocol (T0), post-vaccine protocol (T3rd), and early (T90) and late (T885) periods of the L. chagasi-challenge.\n\nAll research involving dogs was carried out according to the regulations of the Brazilian Society of Science in Animal Research, adopted by the Federal University of Ouro Preto Ethics Committee in Animal Experimentation, that approved the technical procedures using dogs under protocol number 2010/71.\n\nAll dogs included in this study, were born and bred in the kennel facility at Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto in Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil. This kennel facility was established with male and female mongrel dogs, with negative serological and molecular/parasitological diagnosis for Leishmania infection, donated by the local zoonosis control center from Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The filial generations, comprising of offsprings resulting from the cross between the original mongrel dogs pairs were used further maintain the mongrel dog colony. In the present study, twenty mongrel dogs (10 males and 10 females), with seven months of age and negative results for indirect fluorescence immunoassay to anti-Leishmania antibodies, were selected and received an anti-helmintic treatment and were submitted to poly-vaccination protocols, including rabies (Tecpar, Curitiba-PR, Brazil), leptospira, parvovirus, canine distemper, type II adenovirus, parainfluenza and coronavirus (Vanguard\u00ae HTLP 5/CV-L; Pfizer Animal Health, New York, NY, USA). Prior the experimental onset, the animals were maintained in quarantine in kennel runs (4m length x 2m width x 3m height) completely covered with stainless steel wire mesh to prevent the entry of sand flies. The kennel facilities were sprayed with pyrethroid insecticide, every three months, as a measure to control insect access. Each run was installed with an infrared lamp heating (250 watts) to ensure the thermal comfort of animals during the night and on cold days. All the dogs were housed without environmental enrichment (e.g. toys, exercise regimes, etc). The dogs were monitored twice a day, as routine inspection, during which the responsible veterinary was in charge of stimulating and playing with them to aiming to avoid behavior problems and minimize their suffering or distress throughout the study. All the experimental procedures described in this study, including this aspect of animal care was approved by Federal University of Ouro Preto Ethics Committee in Animal Experimentation (protocol number 2010/71). The animals were maintained with water and food ad libitum throughout the experiment time. The euthanasia of all dogs was performed under the supervision of a veterinarian physician, using barbiturate anesthetic (Thiopental Sodium, 35mg/kg, iv) followed by intravenous injection of saturated solution of potassium chloride.\n\nFour groups of dogs involved in experiments were treated as follows: (i) \u201cControl\u201d (C) group (n = 5; subcutaneous injections of 1mL of sterile 0.9% saline); (ii) \u201cSal\u201d group (n = 5; subcutaneous injections of salivary Lutzomyia longipalpis gland extract (SGE; obtained as previously described\u2013[22]) in 1mL of sterile 0.9% saline); (iii) \u201cLbSal\u201d group (n = 5; subcutaneous injections of 600\u03bcg of L. braziliensis promastigote antigen and SGE in 1mL of sterile 0.9% saline); and (iv) \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group (n = 5; subcutaneous injections of 600\u03bcg of L. braziliensis promastigote antigen plus 1mg of saponin and SGE in 1mL of sterile 0.9% saline). All animals received three injections in the right flank at 28days intervals. The L. chagasi-experimental challenge in all dogs was performed after 100 days of vaccination protocol, using intradermal 107 promastigotes during the stationary phase of cultivation. The challenge was performed in the inner side of the left ear including five Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary gland acini. All the analyzed dogs were euthanized 885 days after L. chagasi-experimental challenge and the spleens were collected to evaluate parasite loads. The rationale for choosing such a long endpoint (885 days after challenge) was based on the chronic course of the experimental canine visceral leishmaniasis after intradermal L. chagasi-challenge as previously reported [27].\n\nThe vaccine was obtained as previously described [22]. Briefly, L. braziliensis (MHOM/BR/75/M2903) promastigotes were obtained by in vitro culture in Neal, Novy, Nicolle/Liver Infusion Triptose media [20], and the parasite was fully disrupted by ultrasound treatment (40W, 1min, 4\u00b0C), aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Lowry [42]. The SGE used in this study as the antigenic component of the vaccine was obtained from Lutzomyia longipalpis females that were not fed, aged 4 days, and dissected in slightly hypotonic unbuffered saline 0.8%, as described in [22]. After collection, the glands were disrupted in a sonicator for 10 seconds and centrifuged at 10,000g for 2min. The supernatant was collected and stored in a freezer at -80\u00b0C until use.\n\nJugular vein was used for collecting 20mL of peripheral blood in sterile heparinized syringes. We analyze distinct times: baseline before vaccination (T0), 15 days after third immunization dose (T3rd) as well as early (90 days\u2014T90) and late (885 days\u2014T885) after experimental L. chagasi-challenge. The PBMCs were isolated as previously described [20]. Briefly, the whole blood samples were added over 10mL of Ficoll-Hypaque (Histopaque\u00ae 1077; Sigma, USA), centrifuged at 450g for 40 min at room temperature, and the PBMCs were washed twice with RPMI 1640 (450g for 10 min at room temperature). The PBMCs were resuspended in RPMI 1640 at 107 cells/mL. The PBMCs cultures were performed in 48-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA). The in vitro assays were performed using 50\u03bcL of PBMCs (5.0\u00d7105 cells/well) with 100\u03bcL of vaccine L. braziliensis-soluble antigen (VSA; 25\u03bcg/mL) or 100\u03bcL of soluble L. chagasi antigen (SLcA; 25 \u03bcg/ml). The control cultures (CC; unstimulated) were analyzed using 100\u03bcL of RPMI in place of the antigenic stimulus. Incubation was performed in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C for 5 days, after which time the supernatants were collected and stored in a freezer at \u221280\u00b0C for detection of cytokine and NO.\n\nThe quantification of cytokines was carried out by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), as previously described [26]. Minimum cytokine sensitivity detection levels were 62pg/mL (IL-12), 63pg/mL (TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3), 78pg/mL (IL-4 and IL-10) and 31pg/mL (TGF-\u03b2). The analysis of IL-12 (anti-canine IL-12/IL-23 p40, catalog number DY1969), IFN-\u03b3 (anti-canine IFN-\u03b3, catalog number DY781B), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 (anti-canine TNF-\u03b1/TNFSF1A immunoassay; catalog number DY1507) and IL-10 (anti-canine IL-10, catalog number DY735) cytokines were performed using DuoSet ELISA. Quantikine\u00ae kit (mouse/rat/porcine/canine TGF-\u03b21 immunoassay, catalog number MB100B) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used to measure TGF-\u03b2 levels. The analysis of IL-4 levels employed the capture antibody (monoclonal anti-canine IL-4 antibody\u2014catalog number MAB7541); the standard curve was obtained using recombinant canine IL-4 (catalog number 754CL); and streptavidin (DY998; R&D Systems/USA), biotinylated anti-canine IL-4 antibody (catalog number: BAF754) and substrate solution (1:1 mixture of H2O2 and tetramethylbenzidine; product code 50-76-4) were used.\n\nAll experiments were performed according to the instructions of R&D Systems using 96-well plates (Corning Incorporated, COSTAR\u00ae, Washington, DC, USA). The microplate automatic reader (EL800; Biotek, Winosski, VT, USA) was employed at a wavelength of 450nm.\n\nThe measurement of NO levels in supernatants of PBMCs cultures was performed by indirect method that quantify the nitrite concentration by Griess reaction [43,44]. Briefly, 100\u03bcL of Griess reagent (1% sulfanylamide, 0.1% naphthylethylene-diamide-dihydrochloride, and 2.5% phosphoric acid; all from Sigma, USA) was mixed with 100\u03bcL aliquot of cell-free culture supernatant. The microplate reader (Biotek, EL800) was used to analyze the absorbance at 540nm, after 10 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark.\n\nThe final nitrite concentration was determined based on a standard curve interpolation constructed by using sodium nitrite solutions in the range of 0\u2013100\u03bcM. The interference of nitrites already present in the culture medium was discounted; data were calculated by taking into account the blank, as control reaction, assayed by using the PBMCs cultures medium. The data were expressed as nitrite concentration (\u03bcM).\n\nThe spleen specimens (5mm) were collected during necropsy and stored at -80\u00b0C until use for DNA extraction. The Wizard\u2122 Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used to extract total genomic DNA in 20mg of spleen following manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\nPrimers that amplified a 90-bp fragment of a single copy of the DNA polymerase gene of L. chagasi were used to analyze the spleen parasite burden by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). For the q PCR analysis 200nM forward and reverse primers, 5\u03bcL of template DNA and 16SYBER GREEN reaction master mix (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA) were used in a final volume of 25\u03bcL. As previously described [45], we used the targets the DNA polymerase gene L. chagasi (GenBank accession: AF009147) and the pair of primers (forward: 5\u2019 TGT CGC TTG CAG ACC AGA TG 3\u2019; reverse: 5\u2019 GCA TCG CAG GTG TGA GCA C 3\u2019). The PCR reactions employed an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C (10 min), 40 denaturation cycles at 95\u00b0C (15 seconds), in addition to annealing and extension at 60\u00b0C (1min.). The pGEMH T plasmids (Promega) was used for constructing stardart curves, for each run, containing inserts of interest [46]. The GAPDH gene (115-bp fragment GenBank accession number AB038240) was used to analyze the integrity of the samples. The primers 5\u2019TTCCACGGCACAGTCAAG 3\u2019 (forward) and 5\u2019 ACTCAGCACCAGCATCAC 3\u2019 (reverse) were used for GAPDH gene amplification. The spleen parasite load was performed in duplicate and calculated by interpolation from the standard curve included in the same experimental batch. The data was expressed as number of L. chagasi organisms/20ng of total DNA.\n\nThe Prism 5.0 software package (Prism Software, Irvine, CA, USA) was used to evaluate data distribution normality by Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test and for further statistical analyses. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's multiple comparison were used for comparisons of cytokine profiles, NO levels and parasite load amongst the experimental groups. Student\u2019s t-test was used for intra-group comparisons between the control cultures (CC) and antigen-stimulated cultures (VSA or SLcA-stimuli in vitro). Pearson correlation analysis was further applied to evaluate the relationship between spleen parasite burden and NO profiles. Additionally, the cytokine networks were assembled using Cytoscape software version 2.8.2 (Institute of Systems Biology, Seattle, USA), for each experimental group (\u201cControl\u201d, \u201cSal\u201d, \u201cLbSal\u201d, and LBSapSal) in all times analyzed (T0, T3rd, T90, and T885), based on the correlations indices obtained by Pearson correlation analysis. The network constructed using distinct edges between nodes to identify negative or positive correlations, referred as moderate (0.37<r>0.67) or strong (r>0.68). In all cases, the significance were considered at P<0.05.\n\nAiming to verify whether the immunization protocols were able to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we evaluated the profiles of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12 in CC or upon VSA or SLcA-stimuli in vitro.\n\nNo significant differences were observed amongst the experimental groups at baseline (T0) (Fig 1A, 1B and 1C, upper panel).\n\nData analysis performed at (T3rd) post-vaccination did not show any differences in the TNF-\u03b1 levels amongst the experimental groups, regardless the culture conditions. Analysis of IL-12 demonstrated that the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group displayed increased levels (P<0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared with the same cultures in the \u201cControl\u201d, \u201cSal\u201d, and \u201cLbSal\u201d groups (Fig 1B, middle panel). Moreover, the \u201cLbSal\u201d group showed reduced IL-12 levels (P<0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared with the \u201cControl\u201d group (Fig 1B, middle panel). Interestingly, the analysis of IFN-\u03b3 showed that \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group presented increased levels (P<0.05) in CC as compared to the \u201cControl\u201d group (Fig 1C, middle panel). Additionally, \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group displayed increased IFN-\u03b3 levels (P<0.05) upon VSA and SLcA-stimuli in comparison with \u201cControl\u201d, \u201cSal\u201d, and \u201cLbSal\u201d groups (Fig 1C, middle panel).\n\nAnalysis of the cytokine profile early after L. chagasi-challenge (T90) demonstrated that \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group showed a significant increase of TNF-\u03b1 levels (P<0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared to \u201cSal\u201d and \u201cLbSal\u201d groups (Fig 1A, middle panel). No differences in the IL-12 levels were observed amongst the experimental groups, regardless the culture conditions. Analysis of IFN-\u03b3, \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group displayed increased levels (P<0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared to \u201cControl\u201d and \u201cLbSal\u201d groups at T90 (Fig 1C, middle panel). Additionally, \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group showed a significant increase of IFN-\u03b3 (P<0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared with the \u201cControl\u201d group (Fig 1C, middle panel).\n\nData analysis late after L. chagasi-challenge (T885) demonstrated that the \u201cLbSal\u201d group displayed increased TNF-\u03b1 levels (P<0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared with the \u201cControl\u201d group (Fig 1A, bottom panel). In addition, the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group displayed higher levels of TNF-\u03b1 (P<0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared with \u201cLbSal\u201d group (Fig 1A, bottom panel). No differences in the IL-12 levels were observed amongst the experimental groups, regardless the culture conditions. Interestingly, the analysis of IFN-\u03b3 revealed that \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group showed higher levels (P<0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared with the \u201cControl\u201d, \u201cSal\u201d and \u201cLbSal\u201d groups (Fig 1C, bottom panel).\n\nAiming to evaluate whether the immunization protocols would induce regulatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines, we further quantified the levels of IL-10, IL-4, and TGF-\u03b2 upon VSA or SLcA-stimuli in vitro.\n\nNo significant differences were observed amongst the experimental groups at baseline (T0) (Fig 2B, upper panel).\n\nThe results observed at the post-vaccination period (T3rd) demonstrated that the \u201cLbSal\u201d group showed a significant reduction in the IL-10 levels (P<0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared to the \u201cSal\u201d group (Fig 2B, middle panel). No differences in IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2 levels were observed amongst the experimental groups, regardless the culture conditions.\n\nData mining performed early after L. chagasi-challenge (T90) revealed no differences in the IL-10 production amongst the experimental groups, regardless the culture conditions. However, \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group showed a significant reduction of IL-4 levels (P<0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared to the \u201cSal\u201d group (Fig 2A, middle panel). Interestingly, \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group also presented a significant reduction of TGF-\u03b2 levels (P<0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared the \u201cControl\u201d group (Fig 3, middle panel).\n\nAnalysis carried out late after L. chagasi-challenge (T885) did not differences in IL-10 levels amongst the experimental groups, regardless the culture conditions. The results showed that the \u201cLbSal\u201d group presented a significant reduction in the IL-4 levels (P<0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared with the \u201cSal\u201d group (Fig 2B, bottom panel). Interestingly, \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group displayed a significant reduction of TGF-\u03b2 levels (P<0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared with the \u201cControl\u201d group (Fig 3, bottom panel).\n\nAiming to identify the overall balance of the evaluated cytokines, we have applied machine-learning approaches to analyze the cytokine network for all immunization protocols generated upon SLcA and VSA-stimuli in vitro (S1 Fig and Fig 4).\n\nThe cytokine balance was calculated as the IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 ratio for all experimental groups and culture conditions and data provide in the S1 Fig. The results re-enforce that ability of \u201cLbSapSal\u201d vaccine to induce a long lasting IFN- production over the synthesis of both IL-4 and IL-10, regardless the antigen-stimuli (S1 Fig).\n\nData mining by system biology tools were used to generate biomarker networks for each experimental group using both VSA and SLcA-stimuli. The results demonstrated that upon VSA-stimulation, the \u201cControl\u201d group presented negative correlations between IL-4 with TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 (VSA stimulus). Positive correlation was also observed between TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. Upon SLcA-stimulation, positive correlation was observed between IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 along with a negative correlation between TNF-\u03b1 and IL-4 (Fig 4, upper left panel).\n\nThe \u201cSal\u201d group presented, upon VSA-stimulation, a range of positive correlations, including TNF-\u03b1 with IL-12, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 along IL-12 with IL-10. In addition, negative correlation was observed between IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4. Analysis upon SLcA-stimulation demonstrated positive correlations amongst the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12) along positive correlation of them with IL-10 (Fig 4, upper right panel).\n\nAnalysis of the \u201cLbSal\u201d group upon VSA-stimulation demonstrated a single negative correlation between TNF-\u03b1 and IL-4 (Fig 4, bottom left panel).\n\nData analysis demonstrated that upon VSA-stimulation, the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group showed strong positive correlation among TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 along with positive correlation between TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10. Negative correlations were also observed amongst TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 with IL-4 (Fig 4, bottom right panel). Moreover, upon SLcA-stimulation, positive correlation was observed between IL-12 with IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 (Fig 4, bottom right panel).\n\nThe parasitological analysis performed in spleen samples later on (T885) following L. chagasi-challenge and reported as number of L. chagasi organisms/20ng of total DNA in spleen samples and presented in Table 1. Data analysis demonstrated that all vaccination protocols were able to induce a reduction in the splenic parasite load as compared to the \u201cControl group\u201d. Indeed, \u201cSal\u201d and \u201cLbSal\u201d groups yielded 74.6% and 66.5% of reduction in the spleen parasite load (1.56 and 2.06 amastigotes/20ng of total DNA, respectively) as compared to the \u201cControl\u201d group (6.14 amastigotes/20ng of total DNA). \u201cLbSapSal\u201d groups showed the lowest parasite load (1.30 amastigotes/20ng of total DNA), leading to 78.9% of reduction rate in relation to the \u201cControl\u201d group (Table 1). Moreover, no clinical signs and mortality were observed throughout the experimental design (Table 1).\n\nThe levels of nitric oxide produced by PBMCs were evaluated upon VSA or SLcA-stimuli in vitro early (T90) and late (T885) after L. chagasi-challenge.\n\nData analysis carried early (T90) after L. chagasi-challenge, demonstrated that the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group presented upon control culture condition enhanced NO levels (P<0.05) as compared to the \u201cSal\u201d group (Fig 5, upper left panel). Additionally, \u201cSal\u201d, and \u201cLbSapSal\u201d groups showed increase in the NO levels (P<0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared to the \u201cControl\u201d and \u201cLbSap\u201d groups (Fig 5, upper left panel).\n\nThe analysis performed late (T885) after L. chagasi-challenge showed the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group displayed higher NO levels (P<0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared to the \u201cControl\u201d group (Fig 5, upper right panel).\n\nAdditional analysis revealed that the NO production at T885 displayed a negative correlation with the spleen parasite load selectively upon SLcA-stimulation (Fig 5, bottom right panel). Interestingly, it was observed that in the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group, four out of five animals (80%) showed simultaneous high NO production and low spleen parasite load, compatible with a protection profile (Fig 5, bottom right panel). In contrast, in the \u201cControl\u201d group, only one out of five (20%) showed high NO production but all animals presented high spleen parasitism (Fig 5, bottom right panel).\n\nThe control of Leishmania chagasi (syn. Leishmania infantum) infection in dogs is essential to stop the current spread of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis. Therefore, a vaccine against VL would be an important tool for controlling CVL and would dramatically decrease anxiety regarding L. chagasi infection in humans [18,47]. In this sense, the establishment of biomarkers of immunogenicity is considered critical in the rational approach for analyzing candidate vaccines against CVL, and it contributes to identifying the pattern of immune response in dogs and the search for vaccine candidates against CVL [48,49]. For this reason, in this work, the immunogenicity and protective effects of the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d vaccination in dogs were investigated using levels of NO and cytokines and evaluations related to the spleen parasite load. Furthermore, the addition of sand fly saliva extract to vector-based vaccines can enhance the ability of the host to control or block Leishmania infection [38,33].\n\nThe major results observed after \u201cLbSapSal\u201d immunization revealed a reduction in IL-4 levels during the early (T90) post-challenge period. Importantly, previous studies have identified that the presence of IL-4 in splenocytes from dogs naturally infected with L. chagasi would be an important biomarker during ongoing CVL [12,50]. However, in some reports, the role of IL-4 was related to the resistance profile or susceptibility profile of CVL [50,51]; the higher levels of IL-4 are considered the hallmark of dogs naturally infected with L. chagasi [52] and sustained reduction of IL-4 has been also reported by other immunogen candidates. In fact, reduction in the levels of IL-4 after vaccine immunization against CVL has been considered a biomarker for protection against Leishmania infection [53].\n\nIn the present study, the evaluation of IL-10 demonstrated a possible association with events related to the susceptibility to infection by L. chagasi; the \u201cControl\u201d group has presented increased amounts during the late (T885) post-challenge period. In fact, this cytokine has been associated with severity of VL [54] and CVL [12,16,50,52,55,56]. Importantly, the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group did not have increased IL-10 production, even after the late L. chagasi-challenge period.\n\nAdditionally, analysis of TGF-\u03b2 revealed reduced production in the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d-immunized group during the early and late post-challenge periods. Interestingly, the presence of TGF-\u03b2 has been associated with inducing immunosuppression characteristics during the course of VL [57,58]. Moreover, the presence of TGF-\u03b2 in vitro has a protective effect for amastigotes in macrophages, favoring the maintenance of parasitism [59]. In addition, Alves et al. [50] reported high levels of TGF-\u03b2 associated with increased parasite load in lymph nodes from symptomatic dogs and concluded that TGF-\u03b2 is associated with morbidity in CVL. In this context, it is possible to hypothesize that lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 in the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group would indicate the establishment of immunoprotective mechanisms, whereas higher amounts in the \u201cControl\u201d group would be associated with the susceptibility pattern after L. chagasi-challenge.\n\nAnalysis of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been considered a prerequisite for composing immunogenicity analyses before and after experimental challenge with L. chagasi in clinical trials of anti-CVL vaccines [48,26]. The analysis of TNF-\u03b1 before vaccine immunization (T0) demonstrated increased levels in SLcA-stimulated cultures in the \u201cControl\u201d and \u201cLbSapSal\u201d groups and demonstrated a tendency for enhanced amounts in the \u201cSal\u201d and \u201cLbSal\u201d groups. Similar results were observed for IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 at T0. These results seem to indicate that SLcA stimulation would induce increased levels of these cytokines, pointing to an inherent feature of the antigenic stimulus. For this reason, we evaluated all groups and analyzed the same stimulus in each group to identify a cytokine profile regarding type I immune response. This strategy demonstrated enhanced levels of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 post-vaccination and sustained production of both TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 even after early and late post-challenge periods in the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group. Some studies have described TNF-\u03b1 as being associated with a resistance profile in CVL [52,60, 61,62,63] or in dogs vaccinated against CVL [53], and has been associated with susceptibility when associated with high levels of IL-4 and IL-10 [64]. Results obtained by Strauss-Ayali et al. [65] showed that after stimulation with exogenous IL-12, PBMCs from L. infantum\u2212infected dogs were able to reverse an apparent state of anergy, resulting in increased production of IFN-\u03b3. Moreover, Menezes-Souza et al. [62] found that low levels of IL-12 concomitant with high levels of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 represent a favorable condition for the persistence and replication of parasites in CVL. It has been described that IFN-\u03b3 is linked to a resistance profile in different experimental models for VL [50,61,66,67,68] and in dogs vaccinated against CVL [21,26,29, 30,53].\n\nOur data regarding the cytokine network indicated a balanced immune response in the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group. In this sense, we describe positive (TNF-\u03b1 versus IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10; IL-12 versus IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10) and negative (IL-4 versus TNF-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3) correlations demonstrating a prominent pro-inflammatory immune response in the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group. In addition to a non-significant increase in IL-4 or IL-10 levels in the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group, a balanced immune response was demonstrated by taking into account the positive correlations between IL-10 and type I cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1). These data should be related to the regulation of the prominent pro-inflammatory immune response induced by the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d vaccination and should aim to control potential tissue damage by type I cytokines.\n\nThe parasitological evaluation revealed in \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group a remarkable reduction in spleen parasite load (78.9%) after experimental L. chagasi-challenge, in concordance with a prominent pro-inflammatory immune response induced by this vaccine. In fact, we have been described a parasite load reduction of 69% in the LBSapSal group [27], indicating the capacity of this vaccine to control parasite replication even long after challenge (885 days).\n\nSand fly saliva displays an important role in the first steps of Leishmania infection, due to the vast repertoire of pharmacologically active molecules that surround host\u2019s hemostatic system [69]. The re-exposure to the salivary components seems to display an immunogenic activity, eliciting antibody production and cell mediated immunity by the host that could be block or limit the Leishmania infection [70]. Some studies have been shown that L. longipalpis salivary proteins induce an immune response associated with protection in dogs [22,27]. Furthermore, in a hamster model, salivary proteins of a sand fly protects against the fatal outcome of visceral leishmaniasis [40]. Similarly, we observed 74.6% parasite load reduction in \u201cSal\u201d group, showing that salivary components have a high potential to limit infection in dogs.\n\nThe experimental challenge in vaccine studies against canine visceral leishmaniasis is considered as crucial to analyze the protection performance. Distinct studies have been published aiming to determine the experimental L. chagasi-challenge plus sand fly saliva using intradermal route in dogs would be more similar to natural infection than intravenous challenge [71,72]. However, using intradermal challenge, the dogs would be asymptomatic during all the study, besides to present lower parasitism [71]. Since the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d vaccine presents saliva as antigenic compound, the ideal experimental challenge to test the protection should ideally be performed by intradermal route, as analyzed in our study.\n\nImportantly, we observed increased NO levels in the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group during the early and late post-challenge periods. Interestingly, four out of five dogs immunized with \u201cLbSapSal\u201d presented higher NO amounts and low spleen parasite burden during the late post-challenge period, indicating long-term immunogenicity and resulting in reduction of parasitism. In fact, we have previously demonstrated that \u201cLbSapSal\u201d induced resistance biomarkers specifically related to expansion of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and Leishmania-specific subsets and lower levels of parasitism [22,27]. Panaro et al. [73] also observed an increase in NO production and anti-leishmanial activity of macrophages, as well as increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 in PBMCs supernatants, in dogs immunized with a vaccine comprising crude antigens of L. infantum.\n\nTaken together, our major data indicate that immunization with \u201cLbSapSal\u201d is able to induce a protection profile characterized by enhanced amounts of type I (TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, IFN-\u03b3) cytokines and reduction in type II cytokines (IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2), even after experimental challenge. The establishment of a polarized type I immune response after \u201cLbSapSal\u201d immunization supported increased levels of NO production, favoring a reduction in parasitism and indicating long-lasting protection against L. chagasi infection. These results encourage further studies that can provide important information for a better understanding of the effectiveness of the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d vaccine and strategies for addressing Leishmania antigens in combination with sand fly proteins such as those present in the saliva in the vector."}
