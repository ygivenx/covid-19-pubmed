{"title": "Structural characterization of Mumps virus fusion protein core", "body": "Mumps virus (MuV) belongs to genus Rubulavirus, family Paramyxoviridae, and can infect the glands, the central nervous system, the respiratory tract, and possibly also muscle and connective tissue [1] . Both surface glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin neuraminidase protein (HN) and the fusion (F) protein, are needed to effectuate an efficient viral fusion process mediated by Mumps virus [2] . MuV fusion protein shares many common features with those of other viral enveloped glycoproteins, including the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza virus, gp160 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), glycoprotein of Ebola virus, and fusion protein of paramyxovirus [3, 4] . The fusion protein of MuV is synthesized as a precursor protein molecule (F0) which is cleaved in vivo by a host cell protease to yield the active F protein [5] . The mature F protein is composed of two disul-fide-linked polypeptides, the distal subunit F2 and the transmembrane subunit F1, of unequal size (Fig. 1A) . A highly hydrophobic conserved domain in the membraneanchored subunit (F1), termed the fusion peptide, is considered to participate in the membrane fusion event as it would insert into the targeted cellular membrane.\n\nThe regions following the fusion peptide have a 4-3 heptad repeat (HR) of conserved hydrophobic residues for class I viral fusion proteins. The first heptad repeat, termed the HR1, is followed by a long spacer domain (in some viruses it is short) and a second heptad repeat, termed the HR2, followed by another short spacer and the transmembrane (TM) anchor (Fig. 1A) . Previous studies of HA2 [6] , HIV-1/SIV gp41 [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , Ebola virus GP2 [14, 15] , Simian virus 5 (SV5) F1 [16] , and MHV fusion core [17] indicate that these heptad repeat regions form six-helix bundles which are considered as fusion core of these glycoproteins in a post-fusion form. Three HR1 peptides form hydrophobic central coiled-coil and three HR2 helices pack against the central core in an oblique antiparallel manner [3] . Previous biochemical studies indicate that the viral fusion proteins undergo a series of conformational changes when activated [4, 18] . Earlier studies on HA of influenza and gp41 of HIV-1 led to a model for membrane fusion mediated by envelope glycoproteins [3] . In this model, the N (HR1) and C (HR2) peptides of HIV gp41 come together and form a highly stable coiled-coil aligning the vial and cellular membranes juxtaposition, facilitating membrane fusion, and viral entry [19] .\n\nOur recent studies of HR1 and HR2 regions in MuV fusion protein have shown that its HR1 and HR2 also form a stable six-helix bundle, suggesting a common core architecture similar to those of other viral fusion protein [20] . These methods have been successfully used in the biochemical and structural analysis of several other viral fusion pro-tein core, including SARS-CoV [21, 22] , MHV [17] , Newcastle disease virus [23, 24] , Nipah virus, and Hendra virus [25] . Here, we report the determination of crystal structure of MuV fusion core to 2.2 \u00c5 resolution by X-ray crystallography. The structure confirms the similarity between the MuV and other viral fusion proteins, indicating a similar mechanism for viral fusion mediated by Mumps virus. The C terminus of HR1 peptide shows a 3-4-4-4-3 spacing, which is conserved in known SV5 F and HRSV F structure, suggesting the conserved fusion function and mode in family Paramyxoviridae. This structure also adds the repertoire of fusion cores of viral fusion proteins, providing more structural information for understanding of formation of post-fusion state of viral fusion proteins.\n\nExpression, purification, and crystallization. The construction, expression, purification, and biochemical studies of MuV fusion core protein was described previously [20] . The purified MuV fusion core protein were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, pH8.0, 10 mM NaCl, and concentrated to 20 mg ml \u00c01 . Crystallization was performed by the hanging-drop vapordiffusion method at 291 K. One microliter protein solution was mixed with 1 ll reservoir solution and the mixture was equilibrated against 200 ll reservoir solution at 291 K. Crystallization conditions were screened using Crystal Screen reagent kits (Hampton Research). Crystals with good quality can be obtained in 15% PEG800, 0.5 M lithium sulfate in 2 weeks.\n\nData collection and processing. Data collection of MuV fusion core was performed in-house on a Rigaku RU2000 rotating-copper-anode X-ray generator operated at 48 kV and 98 mA (CuKa; k = 1.5418 \u00c5 ) with a MAR 345 image-plate detector. The crystal was mounted on nylon loops and flash-cooled in cold nitrogen-gas stream at 100 K using an Oxford Cryosystems with reservoir solution as the cryoprotectant. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK programs [26] . b Phase determination and model refinement. The structure of MuV fusion core was solved by molecular replacement with the program CNS [27] . A model derived from the SV5F N1/C1 trimer [16] was used as a search model. The MuV fusion core trimer molecules were built into the electron density map using the program O [28] . After several cycles of manual building and refinement using the programs O [28] and CNS [27] without non-crystallographic restrain, the structure was subsequently refined to a final resolution of 2.2 \u00c5 with an R-value of 23.5% and free-Rvalue of 27.9%. The quality of the structure was verified by PROCHECK [29] . No residue was in disallowed regions and 98% residues were in mostpreferred regions of the Ramachandran plot. The data collection statistics and the structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 . The figures were generated with the programs GRASP [30] , SPDBViewer [31] , and MOLSCRIPT [32] .\n\nProtein Data Bank Accession numbers. The coordinates and the structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with Accession code 2FYZ.\n\nTwo regions encompassing the N-terminal and C-terminal heptad repeats of MuV fusion protein assemble into a stable trimer of heterodimers [20] . The HR1 region consists of residues 124-184 and the HR2 of residues 447-486 of the MuV F protein sequence (GenBank Accession No. NP_054711.1) (Fig. 1A) . The fusion core of MuV fusion protein was prepared as a single chain by linking the HR1 and HR2 domains via a six amino-acid linker (SGGRGG, single amino-acid abbreviation used here). The constructs and the encoded proteins were also called 2-helix (Fig. 1A) . The preparation and characterization of the 2-helix proteins have been reported earlier [20] . The MuV 2-helix forms crystals which have unit-cell parameters a = 161.2, b = 60.8, c = 40.1 \u00c5 , a = 90\u00b0, b = 98.4\u00b0, c = 90\u00b0, and belongs to space group C2. The crystals contain three HR1/HR2 2-helix and 378 water molecules per asymmetric unit and the diffraction pattern extends to 2.2 \u00c5 resolution [33] .\n\nThe crystal structure of the MuV 2-helix was solved by molecular replacement from a single crystal of the protein.\n\nA model derived from the SV5 fusion core trimer was used as a search model. The model was further improved by cycles of manual building and refinement using the programs O [28] and CNS [27] . The structure was subsequently refined to a final resolution of 2.2 \u00c5 with R-value of 23.5% and free-R-value of 27.9%. No residues were in disallowed regions, and 98% were in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. The data collection statistics and final model statistics are summarized in Table 1 .\n\nIn the three-dimensional structure of the MuV 2-helix, the fusion core has a rod-shaped structure approximately 90 \u00c5 in length and a maximum diameter of 28 \u00c5 . The complex is a six-helix bundle (trimer of heterodimer), similar to other viral fusion core structures. The center of this bundle consists of a parallel trimeric coiled-coil of three HR1 helices which are packed by three HR2 helices in an oblique antiparallel manner ( Fig. 2A and B) . The rmsd between each pair of HR1 and HR2 are 1.13 and 1.21 \u00c5 , respectively. The N terminus of HR1 and the C terminus of HR2 are located to the same end of the six-helix bundle, presumably placing the fusion peptides inserted into the cellular membrane and transmembrane domains in viral membrane close together. Several residues in linker (SGGRGG) and several terminal residues at the C terminus of HR1 regions were disordered and could not be traced in electron density map. Here, we focused our structural analysis on the welldefined regions, including residues 124-179 in HR1 region and residues 449-475 in HR2 region.\n\nResidues 124-179 of HR1 region fold into a 16-turn ahelix stretching the entire length of the coiled-coil. As in other naturally occurring coiled-coil of the fusion core, the residues at the a and d positions in HR1 region are predominantly hydrophobic, although occasional polar residues are also observed in these positions ( Fig. 1B and C) . A sequence alignment of MuV and several typical paramyxoviruses fusion proteins shows that the residues at these heptad repeat positions are highly conserved (Fig. 1B) .\n\nResidues 449-475 of HR2 region form a 7-turn amphipathic a-helix. Each HR2 helix packs against the long grooves on the surface of central coiled-coil. There is no interaction between individual HR2 helix ( Fig. 2A and B) . The C terminus of HR2 ends with Q475, aligning with A138 which is also the N terminus of the HR1. The N terminus of HR2 starts with I449, aligning with Q169 of HR1.\n\nThree HR2 helices pack obliquely against the hydrophobic grooves of the central coiled-coil trimer in an antiparallel orientation. The HR2 peptides interact with HR1 peptides mainly through hydrophobic residues and hydrophobic grooves on the surface of central coiled-coil (Fig. 2C) . Sequence alignment between MuV and other paramyxoviruses fusion proteins shows that the residues contribute to the HR1/HR2 interaction (residues at the e and g positions in HR1, residues at the a and d positions in HR2) are highly conserved (Fig. 1B) .\n\nThis pattern of sequence conservation can also be shown on a helical wheel representation of three HR1 helices and one HR2 helix (Fig. 1C) . In this diagram, residues at the a and d positions in HR2 region align with residues at the e and g positions in HR1, mainly through hydrophobic interaction with the grooves on the surface of central coiledcoil. Sequence alignment between MuV and SV5 fusion protein shows that 7 out of 16 \n\nAmong paramyxovirus fusion proteins, only the structures of the SV5 and hRSV fusion core have been determined [16, 34] . Here, we focus our structural comparison on MuV F and SV5 F since the fusion core structures of hRSV and SV5 share significant similarity ( Fig. 3A and  B) . MuV fusion core structure has a similar conformation with SV5 F1 and the two structures can be superposed with an RMS deviation of 0.89 \u00c5 between all Ca atoms. Although MuV and SV5 fusion cores are very similar in the whole conformation, they also have some significant differences.\n\nIn SV5 F structure, the last two heptad repeats of the nine in HR1 region exhibit a skip or increase in spacing [16] . The side chains of I172, V176, I180, and A183 in the C terminus of HR1 peptide produce a 3-4-4-4-3 spacing rather than the expected 3-4-3-4-3. This skip was predicated to be conserved in paramyxovirus and also found in hRSV F structure [34] . In MuV fusion core structure, all the heptad repeats also exhibit the typical 3-4-4-4-3 spacing predicated by LearnCoil-VMF program [35] . In the core structure studied here, I175 faces the outside of the trimer and holds d position in heptad repeats of HR1 region, while M176 at the e position faces the center of the central coiled-coil (Fig. 4A) . Sequence alignment shows that residues in the same position in other paramyxovirus fusion proteins as I175 in MuV F are almost all hydrophilic (Val in SV5 F) and the next residues are all hydrophobic and highly conserved (Fig. 4B) . This arrangement will lead to increase in spacing that will make the central coiled-coil more stable within the hydrophobic interaction and the outer side of the fusion core more hydrophilic in solution. Expectably, in MuV F structure, the residues in this region also form typical 4-4 spacing because residue I175 is at the d position and faces outside. We can consider that the skip pattern is conserved in paramyxovirus fusion proteins for executing fusion functions successfully.\n\nOur structure studied here shows that HR2 of MuV fusion core has one additional extended region at the C terminus not observed in SV5 and HRSV C peptide. This additional extended region contains only four residues (SVNV). The extended chains can also be found at the N terminus of SV5 and HRSV HR2 regions. We can find a motif termed O-X-O in which O represents hydrophobic residues and X represents any residues, especially hydrophilic [17] . V 477 -N 478 -V 479 in MuV F, L 442 -S 443 -I 444 and L 447 -D 448 -I 449 in SV5 F, L 481 -V 482 -F 483 in HRSV F all belong to O-X-O motifs. The O-X-O pattern of hydrophobic residues is amphipathic when in an extended conformation but not in the context of a-helix. Therefore, this section of HR2 packs as an extended strand against the hydrophobic grooves between the HR1 helices. In these three structures, the distance between two hydrophobic residues in the O-X-O motifs is almost equal to 5.4 \u00c5 which is also the distance between the two adjacent turns in an a-helix. Thus, the two hydrophobic residues (O residues) could exactly pack against the grooves of the central coiled-coil formed by three HR1 helices just like residues at the a and d positions in normal heptad repeat regions of HR2. This compatibility of HR2 segments makes the fusion core more stable in solvent because most of the hydrophobic residues in HR2 regions are packed against the central coiled-coil and leave the hydrophilic residues faced the solvent. This pattern also explains why not all residues in HR2 of viral fusion proteins form a-helix and why HR1 peptides of these fusion proteins are highly conserved but HR2 peptides are always different in their three-dimensional conformations. Compatibilities of HR1 and HR2 segments we discussed here both indicate the basic rule for the formation of viral fusion core.\n\nThe structure of MuV fusion core adds to the repertoire of paramyxovirus six-helix bundle fusion core structures, of which only two are available at present, providing more structural information for the understanding of formation of fusion-active state of viral fusion proteins. The evident similarity between MuV F1 and well-studied viral fusion proteins like HIV gp41 and influenza HA, as well as previous biochemical anal- ysis [20] indicates a similar mechanism of membrane fusion mediated by Mumps virus fusion protein. Similar to HIV gp41, MuV F1 likely has distinct conformational states, including the native state, the prehairpin intermediate, and fusion-active hairpin state [3] . The structure determined here likely corresponds to the fusion-active hairpin state of MuV F protein formed after several conformational changes, aligning cellular membrane and viral membrane juxtaposition which is followed by virus-cell membrane fusion."}
