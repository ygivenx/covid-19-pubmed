{"title": "The use and reporting of airline passenger data for infectious disease modelling: a systematic review", "body": "International movement of individuals through commercial airline travel has been implicated in the transnational dissemination of many infectious diseases and is thought to be the principle mode of human pathogen transfer between continents. Examples include the global dissemination of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 which quickly spread from Hong Kong to North America [1]. The 2009 influenza pandemic [2], which emerged in Mexico and affected more than 208 countries, followed a similar international dissemination [3]. There is, year-on-year, an increasing number of airline travellers, with a total of 1,186 million international tourist arrivals globally in 2015, a 4.6% increase from 2014 and 510 million arrivals more than in 2000 [4]. In addition, tourism visits to emerging economies are now comparable to those of high-income countries, with countries such as Mexico and Thailand entering the top 15 of the most visited destinations. The global trend is expected to keep rising and reach 1.8 billion arrivals in 2030 [4]. Lower fares and greater availability make geographically distant destinations easier to reach for a greater number of people [5]. \n\nWith the volume of airline passengers increasing each year [6], it is important to understand the dynamics of the airline network and its role in disease spread and control [7]. We need to be able to accurately predict international transmission through passenger flow. Mathematical models are useful tools that can estimate the risk of infectious disease importation and exportation by international airline passengers [8], especially in the early stages of an outbreak when accurate reporting may be difficult [9]. Models such as the one developed by Lopez et al. use the force of infection in the visited country to determine the risk to international visitors, assuming an arbitrary number of airline passengers [8]. However, this risk can also extend to new areas when returning passengers carry pathogens back to their country of residence, as was the case in Italy in 2007, when an autochthonous chikungunya outbreak occurred following importation [10]. Mathematical models of pathogen importation/exportation risks usually entail a function of the infection level in the visited country and the airline passenger volume between the two involved geographical locations, as described by Quam and Wilder-Smith [11]. Access to accurate and appropriate data sets describing passenger flow between locations is crucial when developing transmission models of global spread [12]; such models can explore the potential role the airline network may play in the spread of disease, but also predict future spread, particularly when new threats emerge. However, a variety of data sources have been used leading to inconsistency and incomparability between modelling studies [7]. The sources themselves are generally not designed for epidemic modelling purposes. They include data for use within the aviation industry, which may be expensive to access and impose user restrictions, including prohibition to share with a third party [7,12]. Open-access data sources do exist but may be geographically restricted, provide information in forms not easily convertible into passenger numbers or are limited in temporal resolution [7]. \n\nTo gain an overview of the range of airline passenger data sources used by modelling studies, a systematic literature review was designed and conducted. The principal aim of the review was to determine the data types (e.g. passenger numbers and seat capacity) and sources used for the purposes of modelling international infectious disease importation. A secondary aim of the review was to assess the reproducibility of those studies regarding sourcing and use of airline passenger data.\n\nWe conducted a search of the literature on 2 October 2017 using PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus with no restriction on the earliest date of the articles returned. A combination of three sets of search terms was used in this review (#1 AND #2 AND #3). The first set (#1) was: \u2018air\u2019 OR \u2018airline\u2019 OR \u2018aviation\u2019 OR \u2018flight\u2019 OR \u2018airport\u2019 OR \u2018passenger\u2019 OR \u2018transport*\u2019 OR \u2018travel*\u2019 AND NOT \u2018pollution\u2019. The second set (#2) was: \u2018epidemic\u2019 OR \u2018pandemic\u2019. The final set (#3) was: \u2018global\u2019 OR \u2018international\u2019. The term \u2018pollution\u2019 was classed as an exclusionary term as initial scoping suggested that a large proportion of results included pollution studies, which were deemed irrelevant to this review.\n\nWe included articles if they matched the following inclusion criteria: (i) they were primary and peer-reviewed research; (ii) they modelled the international spread of human infectious diseases between at least two countries and (iii) the model was parameterised with airline passenger data. We included modelling studies which considered either dynamic models of the transmission process or non-dynamic modelling of the movement of infected individuals. We also permitted the inclusion of any additional articles if they were identified as the source of passenger data used in already selected articles and met the three inclusion criteria above. Although no language restriction was applied to the searches, articles in a language other than English were excluded during the abstract review if no translated version of the abstract could be found. Review articles not containing primary research were also excluded, unless they addressed specifically the use of airline passenger data in epidemic modelling. Articles for which an abstract could not be accessed were excluded at this stage. \n\nFollowing deduplication, the full list of abstracts and titles was reviewed and included or excluded by at least two reviewers independently. Any disagreement regarding inclusion of an article in the review was then discussed between all reviewers. The full text of selected articles was accessed and screened for relevance in more detail. Articles for which the full text could not be accessed, which were not open access and could not be accessed through the University of Liverpool or Lancaster University library subscriptions, were excluded. The bibliographies of the selected articles were searched for additional relevant articles, based on title and full text, subject to the same inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\nFrom the final selection of articles, we extracted information regarding the airline passenger data used in each article (Table 1). This information focused on the source, type and validity of data used in the study (Table 1, part A) and the reproducibility of data usage judged by pre-defined criteria (Table 1, part B). For the purposes of this review, data validation was defined as the comparison of primary data used in an article against at least one independent and appropriately comparable set of data. An article was deemed to have validated its data source if it cited another independent and comparable data set and contained a comparison between them. To determine reproducibility, each article was assessed for its reporting of data source using the checklist shown in Table 1, part B and scored accordingly. We did not plan or conduct any bias analysis of the selected publications.\n\nFrom the 4,012 articles identified in the search, 2,547 were identified as duplicates and rejected, resulting in 1,465 articles which went forward for title and abstract screening (Figure). A further 1,130 were rejected at this stage as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 335 articles were selected based on their title and abstract and read in full. From these, 223 were rejected: the majority (n = 87) did not contain airline data, 73 were deemed not relevant (did not contain at least two required criteria, such as airline data and model) and 20 used no model. An additional 19 were country-specific, 17 were inaccessible (no access to journal or language barrier), five were reviews and two were not focused on human disease movement. After reading the articles in full, 112 were selected as relevant to this review. Finally, 24 additional articles, not detected by the search but through reading the bibliography of accepted articles, were included after being read in full to determine relevance.\n\nThe publication year of the 136 articles selected ranged from 1985 to 2017, with the largest number of articles (n = 17) published in 2016 (Table 2). In the 20 years following the publication by Rvachev and Longini in 1985, the oldest article relevant to this review, only seven relevant articles were published [13-19].\n\nA wide range of data sources have been used for modelling passenger flow between countries; in total 45 distinct sources were identified (Table 3). Commercial or industry data sources were most often used (14 sources, used in 131 articles), followed by governmental data (14 sources, used in 30 articles). Of the commercial data sources, those most often acknowledged were from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) (61 articles) and OAG, an airline industry company specialising in data provision and analysis (38 articles). Some articles used the airline data directly, however, two articles [17,20] used data from one or more articles (see Table 2) and therefore were also thought of as using industry data. Where a database was named from IATA or OAG sources, OAG MAX was the most common (5 articles). A range of other industry-orientated data sources were cited, including Diio (airline market information), Amadeus (travel reservations database), Feeyo (a Chinese flight scheduler) and OpenFlights.org (an open-access database of flight records contributed by members of the public). Four articles used passenger surveys such as TravelPac from the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) Office for National Statistics (ONS), and nine articles used tourism surveys (Table 3). Eleven articles used information published by airports, and four other sources were reported (the social media site Twitter, two aircraft manufacturers and EuroStat).\n\nMost data sources contained information about origin and destination (n = 91, 67%) or passenger numbers (n = 73, 54%) (Table 4). Data pertaining to direct flights only were used more often than data pertaining to full passenger itineraries: n=33 and n=27, respectively. Of the 62 studies using IATA as a data source, 15 used information of direct flight only [10,21-34] and of the 38 using OAG, 11 used information of direct flight only [2,23,24,34-41]. Finally, eight articles [21,22,24,42-46] indirectly used IATA data by using the online modelling tool GLEAMviz [47], and two [10,48] by using BioDisapora (now Bluedot.global [49]).\n\nAccording to the set of standards we had established to determine an article\u2019s reproducibility (see Table 1, part B), no article was considered fully reproducible. Eight (6%) articles were deemed partially reproducible (score of 3 or above), where some information regarding the description and use of passenger data was reported [13,50-56]. Of the 45 total data sources identified, 26 were open source, 11 were closed source, and 8 were not publicly available. The date range of the data (start and end date) was reported in 58% (n = 79) studies, and an access date was stated in 25% (n = 34) of the sources used. Data validation as previously defined was performed in 5% (n = 7) of the articles [13,34,46,51,57-59]. Only 40 articles (29%) reported performing any data cleaning or manipulation before using the data set. \n\nThe majority of articles (n = 115; 85%) were concerned with the global spread of infectious diseases, while the analysis of the airline network itself (while modelling pathogen spread) was the next most common purpose (n = 11; 8%). Five articles used passenger data for descriptive or illustrative purposes [13,29,30,60,61], two articles used the data for passenger screening simulations [62,63] and two articles described the development of a public health tool [23,64]. Of the pathogens modelled, pandemic influenza was the most frequent subject of the models (n = 40; 29%) (Table 5). Generic models not focussing on a specific pathogen were also common (n = 23; 17%).\n\nThe screening and selection of articles was done in a systematic manner and by two independent reviewers to ensure all relevant articles were included in the selection of articles to be read in full. The full reference lists of accepted articles were read to find additional relevant articles. Although a number of articles were found when going through reference lists, we are confident that this selection was a good representation of the range of airline data used. In addition, no other review that we are aware of is focused on the analysis of the validity and reproducibility of the data used for mathematical models of infectious disease spread by air travel. Limitations of this study include not contacting authors regarding their methods and not including other search engines which may have yielded additional articles but would also have returned a very large number of potential articles to process. In addition, by limiting the articles to international spread only, some articles which focused primarily on spread within a country were excluded, even though they may include relevant data sources.\n\nWe conducted a systematic review to assess the range and reporting of data used by authors to model the international spread of infectious diseases through the airline network. We found 136 articles matching our inclusion criteria and extracted information regarding source, data type, validation assessment and reproducibility. We found a variety of data sources and types used, limited validation performed and poor reporting, rendering many studies unreproducible. We recommend that greater effort is devoted to validation and data sources and that a consensus is achieved on the use of information sources providing airline passenger data. Public health modelling would benefit greatly from the availability of a validated contemporary open-source data source which includes detailed origin\u2013destination information, including connecting passengers, and has high temporal resolution."}
