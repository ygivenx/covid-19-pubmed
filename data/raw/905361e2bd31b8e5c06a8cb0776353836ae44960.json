{"title": "Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor Antagonism Enhances Proliferation and Migration of Engrafted Neural Progenitor Cells in a Model of Viral-Induced Demyelination", "body": "The oral drug FTY720 affects sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling on targeted cells that bear the S1P receptors S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5. We examined the effect of FTY720 treatment on the biology of mouse neural progenitor cells (NPCs) after transplantation in a viral model of demyelination. Intracerebral infection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) resulted in an acute encephalomyelitis, followed by demyelination similar in pathology to the human demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis. We have previously reported that intraspinal transplantation of mouse NPCs into JHMV-infected animals resulted in selective colonization of demyelinated lesions, preferential differentiation into oligodendroglia accompanied by axonal preservation, and increased remyelination. Cultured NPCs expressed transcripts for S1P receptors S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5. FTY720 treatment of cultured NPCs resulted in increased mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and migration after exposure to the chemokine CXCL12. Administration of FTY720 to JHMV-infected mice resulted in enhanced migration and increased proliferation of transplanted NPCs after spinal cord engraftment. FTY720 treatment did not improve clinical disease, diminish neuroinflammation or the severity of demyelination, nor increase remyelination. These findings argue that FTY720 treatment selectively increases NPC proliferation and migration but does not either improve clinical outcome or enhance remyelination after transplantation into animals in which immune-mediated demyelination is initiated by the viral infection of the central nervous system. Intracranial infection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) results in an acute encephalomyelitis, followed by chronic demyelination characterized by viral persistence within the central nervous system (CNS), axonal damage, and demyelination. 1e7 Previous studies from our laboratory have used the JHMV model of neuroinflammation-mediated demyelination to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of mouse neural progenitor cell (NPC) engraftment on remyelination. 8e10 Transplantation of mouse NPCs into the spinal cords of JHMV-infected mice results in extensive migration and colonization of areas of white matter damage and preferential differentiation into oligodendroglia. 8e10 Engrafted NPCs physically engage damaged axons, and this ultimately leads to increased axonal integrity that correlates with remyelination. 8, 11 These findings, along with others, 12e14 argue that engraftment of NPCs may provide an important unmet clinical need for treatment of human demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), by facilitating sustained remyelination that can restore motor function and ameliorate clinical symptoms.\n\nAfter engraftment of NPCs into the spinal cords of JHMV-infected mice, transplanted cells migrate both rostral and caudal from the implantation site. 8, 9 The chemokine ligand CXCL12 is enriched within areas of demyelination, and transplanted NPCs express the signaling receptor CXCR4, resulting in colonization of areas of white matter damage. Blocking CXCR4 signaling on NPC transplantation impaired NPC migration, arguing for an important role for this chemokine signaling pathway in contributing to repair by mediating trafficking to sites of myelin damage. 9 However, the molecular mechanisms governing positional migration of NPCs are likely complex and consist of additional soluble factors that affect the ability of NPCs to effectively congregate within areas of white matter pathology.\n\nAmong potential molecules that may influence migration is the lysophospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) that is well documented in controlling proliferation and migration of numerous cell types. 15e18 Although the importance of S1P signaling in controlling lymphocyte homing and egress from lymphatic tissues is well documented, 19e21 increasing evidence indicates a functional role within the CNS as glia and neurons express different combinations of specific signaling receptors S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5. 22, 23 Activation of these receptors yields different effects on migration and survival of astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. 24e26 In addition, NPCs express S1P receptors, and signaling has previously been reported to influence in vitro differentiation. 27 Moreover, Kimura et al 28 demonstrated an important role for S1P signaling in controlling migration of transplanted NPCs to an injury site in a model of spinal cord injury.\n\nWe examined the functional role of S1P signaling after NPC transplantation into the spinal cords of JHMV-infected mice. FTY720 is a U.S. Food and Drug Administrationeapproved oral drug for treatment of patients with relapsing MS. 22,23,29e31 FTY720 exerts immunomodulatory effects that reduce acute relapses, new lesion formation, and disability progression and brain volume loss in MS patients. 32 The mechanism(s) behind FTY720 functions are not yet defined; however, the phosphorylated active form of FTY720 (FTY720P) is an S1P receptor modulator that inhibits egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes. FTY720 is a functional antagonist of S1P1 on lymphocytes, 20 yet also can act as a nonselective agonist of S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5. 33 Therefore, the available evidence suggests that cellular source and receptor expression profile are critical in terms of how FTY720 affects S1P signaling, and likely lead to a dampening of autoreactive T cells specific for myelin antigens infiltrating into the CNS. More important, FTY720, because of its lipophilic nature, penetrates the blood-brain barrier and readily enters the CNS parenchyma. Furthermore, FTY720P is detected in situ, suggesting that it may influence the biology of resident cells of the CNS. Our findings reveal that treatment of cultured NPCs with FTY720P led to an active signaling response, as determined by phosphorylation of mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase, yet did not influence lineage fate commitment. FTY720 treatment of JHMV-infected mice, transplanted with NPCs, demonstrated enhanced migration associated with increased numbers of NPCs compared with vehicle-treated control animals. FTY720 treatment did not affect the accumulation of T cells or macrophages within the CNS. Finally, after treatment in animals in which demyelination is established, FTY720 did not augment the effects of NPCs on influencing remyelination, indicating a selective effect on migration/proliferation on spinal cord engraftment into JHMV-infected mice.\n\nAge-matched (5 to 7 weeks) S1P1 enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) knock-in mice (C57BL/6 background) 34 and C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of 150 mL of a mixture of ketamine (Western Medical Supply, Arcadia, CA) and xylazine (Phoenix Pharmaceutical, Saint Joseph, MO) in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Mice were injected intracranially with 150 plaqueforming units of JHMV (strain V2.2-1) suspended in 30 mL saline. 9 Clinical severity was assessed by blinded investigators (T.E.L. and C.A.B.) using a previously described four-point scoring scale. 35 FTY720 (2-amino-2-[2-(4octylphenyl) ethyl]-1,3-propanediol, hydrochloride) and FTY720P (2-amino-2 [2-(4-octylphenyl) ethyl]-1,3propanediol, mono dihydrogen phosphate ester) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co (Ann Arbor, MI). FTY720 or the vehicle was administered by daily i.p. injections of 100 mL, starting at day 13 postinfection (p.i.). Experiments for all animal studies were reviewed and approved by the University of Utah (Salt Lake City) and the University of California (Irvine) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.\n\nNeurosphere cultures were prepared from brains of perinatal S1P1 eGFP knock-in mice, as previously described. 8, 36 Briefly, dissected striata were razor minced and triturated in 0.05% trypsin for 10 minutes, followed by anti-trypsin to inactivate the digestion. Single cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F12 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), insulintransferrin-selenium-X (Invitrogen), penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), 40 ng/mL T3 (T67407; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and 20 ng/mL human recombinant epidermal growth factor (E9644; Sigma). Cells were cultured for 6 days with replacement of media every other day, at which point ajp.amjpathol.org -The American Journal of Pathology mature neurospheres were isolated and GFP expression was visualized by fluorescence microscopy.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from neurospheres, DNase treated, and purified via phenol-chloroform extraction. cDNA was synthesized with a reverse transcription kit superscript VILO (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers were used to identify S1P1-S1P5 mRNA expression: S1P1, 5 0 -TTTCCATCGCCATCCTC-TAC-3 0 (forward) and 5 0 -GCAGGCAATGAAGACAC-TCA-3 0 (reverse); S1P2, 5 0 -TCTCAGGGCATGTCACTC-TG-3 0 (forward) and 5 0 -CAGCTTTTGTCACTGCCGTA-3 0 (reverse); S1P3, 5 0 -GTGTGTTCATTGCCTGTTGG-3 0 (forward) and 5 0 -TTGACTAGACAGCCGCACAC-3 0 (reverse); S1P4, 5 0 -GGCTACTGGCAGCTATCCTG-3 0 (forward) and 5 0 -AAGGCCACCAAGATCATCAG-3 0 (reverse); and S1P5, 5 0 -GATCCCTTCCTGGGTCTAGC-3 0 (forward) and 5 0 -TAGAGCTGCGATCCAAGGTT-3 0 (reverse). Primers were purchased from Invitrogen. Sequencing of PCR amplicons confirmed primer specificity.\n\nNPCs were plated on Matrigel-coated 6-well plates and treated with either 100 nmol/L FTY720 phosphate or vehicle for 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours. The cells were then lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCL (pH 7.4), 175 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholic acid] supplemented in protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). P44/42 MAP kinase (1:2000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and phosphorylated p44/42 MAP kinase (1:15,000; Cell Signaling) were detected by Western blot analysis using horseradish peroxidaseeconjugated secondary antibodies (1:25,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) and exposed to Supersignal West-Femto chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL).\n\nTo assess differentiation potential, NPCs expressing GFP 8, 9, 11, 37 were grown on Matrigel-coated chamber slides with epidermal growth factor for 24 hours, at which point growth factor was removed and NPCs were allowed to differentiate for up to 7 days. 8 Cells were treated daily with 100 nmol/L FTY720P or vehicle subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature. Immunofluorescence was performed using established protocols: rabbiteanti-mouse Olig 2 (1:200; Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), rabbiteanti-mouse glial fibrillary acidic protein (1:1000; Invitrogen), mouseeanti-mouse Map2 (1:750; Sigma), Alexa-594 anti-rabbit (1:500; Invitrogen), and anti-mouse (1:1000; Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies. Samples were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and coverslip was mounted with DAPI Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The percentage of immunopositive cells for each stain was determined by dividing the total number of immunopositive cells by the total number of DAPI-positive cells.\n\nTransplantation was performed on day 14 p.i. with JHMV, at which point infected mice have established demyelination. 8, 9, 11 Mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of 150 mL of a mixture of ketamine (Western Medical Supply, Arcadia, CA) and xylazine (Phoenix Pharmaceutical, Saint Joseph, MO) in Hanks' balanced salt solution, a laminectomy was performed at T9, and 2.5 \u00c2 10 5 NPCs resuspended in 2.5 mL solution were injected into the spinal cord using a 10-mL Hamilton syringe, as previously described. 8,38e40 Recipient mice also received daily i.p. injections of 3 mg/kg FTY720 starting at day 13 p.i., whereas a control group received vehicle starting at day 13 p.i.\n\nIn vitro chemotaxis assays were performed using a NeuroProbe ChemoTx system, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, GFP-NPCs treated with 100 nmol/L, 10 nmol/L, and 1 mmol/L FTY720P or vehicle control were allowed to migrate in response to recombinant mouse CXCL12 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Migration after 16 hours of culture was assessed by a fluorescent microplate reader (Synergy H1; BioTek, Winooski, VT), according to manufacturer's specifications.\n\nSpinal cords were isolated at defined time points and fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 C. Individual spinal cords were divided into sections, and twelve coronal sections (1 mm thick) were cryoprotected in 20% sucrose and embedded in OCT (VWR, Radnor, PA). Coronal sections (8 mm thick) were cut, and sections were stained with luxol fast blue. Areas of total white matter and demyelinated white matter were determined with ImageJ software version 1.48 (NIH, Bethesda, MD; http://imagej.nih.gov/ij). 41 Demyelination was scored as a percentage of total demyelination along the entire length of the spinal cord. The total numbers of GFP-positive cells were determined in each of the twelve spinal cord sections surrounding the transplant site by counting GFP-positive cells colocalized with DAPIpositive nuclei. Determination of both the severity of demyelination and numbers of GFP-positive cells was performed blinded (T.E.L. and C.A.B.).\n\nMice were perfused with 0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer containing 2% paraformaldehyde/2% glutaraldehyde, and spinal\n\nThe American Journal of Pathologyajp.amjpathol.org cords were isolated, and then embedded in Epon (Danbury, CT) epoxy resin. Serial ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetateelead citrate and analyzed as previously described. Images at \u00c21200 magnification were analyzed for g-ratio using ImageJ software. 42 A minimum of 150 axons were analyzed per mouse, and the g-ratio was calculated by dividing the axon diameter by the total fiber diameter.\n\nFor immunophenotyping of glial cells, fixed spinal cord sections were incubated in 10% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 hour at room temperature. This was followed by an overnight incubation at 4 C with the following primary antibodies in 1% bovine serum albumin: rabbit anti-mouse glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p (1:1000; MBL, International Corporation, Woburn MA), rabbiteanti-mouse glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:1000; Invitrogen), and rabbiteanti-mouse Ki-67 (1:300; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Sections were then washed in PBS and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with Alexa fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies (goateanti-rabbit Alexa 594 or goateanti-mouse Alexa 594; 1:1000 in PBS; Invitrogen). Next, sections were washed in PBS and coverslip mounted using DAPI Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). The percentage of immunopositive cells for each stain was determined by dividing the total number of immunopositive cells by the total number of DAPI-positive cells.\n\nBrain, spinal cords, and blood were isolated at day 21 or 28 p.i. from infected mice treated with 3 mg/kg FTY720 or vehicle, starting at day 13 p.i. and transplanted with GFPlabeled NPCs. By using previously described protocols, 41 tissues were then homogenized and immunophenotyped by flow cytometry using the following antibodies: rateantimouse CD4-allophycocyanin (1:50; Biolegend, San Diego, CA), rateanti-mouse CD8-allophycocyanin (1:50; Biolegend), S510 to S518 tetramer-phosphatidylethanolamine (1:300; NIH), and M133 to M147 tetramer-phosphatidylethanolamine (1:150; NIH). Blood was collected by cardiac heart puncture, and cells were stained with rateanti-mouse CD4allophycocyanin and CD8-phosphatidylethanolamine after red blood cell lysis. Samples were analyzed using a BD-Fortessa X-20 Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ).\n\nFTY720 functions as both an antagonist and agonist for members of the S1P receptor family whose natural ligand is S1P. Previous studies have demonstrated that FTY720 preferentially binds S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 receptors, including lower affinity for S1P4, but does not bind to S1P2. 19 We tested whether mouse NPCs expressed S1P receptors and if FTY720 treatment affected defined responses. Neurospheres were isolated from the subventricular zone of day 1 old eGFP-S1P1 knock-in mice, 8, 36 and immunofluorescence confirmed that NPCs express S1P1, as evidenced by GFP expression ( Figure 1A ). Subsequent analysis of additional S1P receptor expression by RT-PCR demonstrated expression of transcripts for all five defined . Neurospheres were isolated from the subventricular zone of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) neonatal pups. A: Representative immunofluorescence images confirm that neurospheres express S1P1, as evidenced by GFP expression. B: Analysis of S1P receptor expression by NPCs at the mRNA level demonstrates expression of transcripts specific for S1P1 to S1P5; the sequence of amplicons confirmed primer specificity. C: Western blot analysis of cultured NPCs treated with either vehicle or 100 nmol/L phosphorylated active form of FTY720 (FTY720P) reveals increased phosphorylation over time. D: Quantitative analysis of Western blot data confirms increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Analyses of band intensity on films are presented as the relative ratio of phosphorylated MAPK/actin. BF, brightfield microscopy; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. ajp.amjpathol.org -The American Journal of Pathology S1P receptors ( Figure 1B) . Previous studies have demonstrated that FTY720 treatment activates several intracellular signaling cascades, including phosphorylation of MAP kinase. 43, 44 Treatment of cultured NPCs with the activated FTY720P (100 nmol/L) resulted in phosphorylation of MAP kinase in a time-dependent manner, indicating receptor binding and activation (Figure 1, C and D) . These findings support earlier studies 15 demonstrating that NPCs express S1P receptors and FTY720 treatment initiates activation of intracellular signaling pathways.\n\nWe next tested whether exposure of cultured NPCs to FTY720 influenced lineage fate commitment. Under defined conditions, cultured NPCs will preferentially differentiate into oligodendroglia, although astrocytes and neurons are \n\nThe American Journal of Pathologyajp.amjpathol.org also present. 8, 9 Exposure of NPCs to 100 nmol/L FTY720P did not influence differentiation because we detected similar frequencies of oligodendroglia (Olig2 positive), astrocytes (GFAP), and neurons (Map2) when compared with vehiclecontroletreated cultures (Figure 2, AeD) . Therefore, S1P receptor antagonism does not affect NPC differentiation.\n\nTo test if FTY720 affects migration of engrafted NPCs, JHMV and GFP-expressing NPCs (GFP-NPCs) were transplanted into the spinal cord at day 14 p.i., 8, 11, 37, 39 and FTY720 treatment (3 mg/kg, daily, via i.p. injection) was initiated at day 13 p.i. Control groups consisted of JHMV-infected mice transplanted with GFP-NPCs treated with vehicle only. Mice were sacrificed at 3 weeks posttransplant, and GFP-NPC distribution was assessed histologically in spinal cord cross sections. In both FTY720 and vehicle-treated control mice, GFP-NPCs were distributed rostral and caudal from the implantation site and colonized areas of demyelination within the ventral funiculus and lateral white matter columns (Figure 3, A and B) . Quantification of GFP-NPCs in defined spinal cord sections rostral and caudal to the implantation site indicated a significant (P < 0.05) increase in numbers of GFP-NPCs in FTY720-treated animals when compared with vehicle-treated mice ( Figure 3C ). Immunostaining for Ki-67 revealed increased numbers of Ki-67epositive GFP-NPCs throughout the spinal cord in FTY720-treated mice, consistent with increased proliferation (Figure 3, D and E) . These findings suggest a role in S1P receptor antagonism in controlling proliferation and/or migration of NPCs engrafted into the spinal cord. We have previously shown that CXCL12 is critical in controlling the positional migration of engrafted NPCs by signaling through CXCR4 expressed on the surface of NPCs. 9 Furthermore, Kimura et al 45 have reported that FTY720 treatment promotes migration of human CD34 \u00fe hematopoietic progenitor cells by enhancing CXCR4 function. Cultured NPCs were treated with increasing concentrations of FTY720P (10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, and 1 mmol/L), and the in vitro migration in response to 200 ng/mL recombinant mouse CXCL12 resulted in a dose-dependent migration response ( Figure 4A ). Flow analysis revealed that FTY720 treatment did not affect surface expression of CXCR4 at any concentration tested (Figure 4 , B and C). Therefore, administration of FTY720 enhances migration of NPCs potentially by enhancing CXCR4 function, consistent with earlier studies. 45 FTY720 Treatment of NPC-Transplanted Mice Does Not Affect NPC Differentiation or Demyelination FTY720 did not affect clinical disease in JHMV-infected mice, regardless if transplanted with GFP-NPCs or treated with vehicle (data not shown). We next examined if FTY720 treatment influenced the ability of engrafted NPCs to differentiate into oligodendroglia, because our previous studies have shown that most transplanted cells preferentially differentiate into these cells. 8, 9 By 14 days posttransplant, FTY720 did not affect lineage fate commitment of NPCs because similar frequencies of GST-pepositive cells (a marker for mature myelin-producing oligodendrocytes) were observed in FTY720 versus vehicle-treated mice ( Figure 5, A and B) . The severity of spinal cord demyelination in transplanted mice treated with FTY720 was examined by staining serial coronal sections rostral and caudal to the implantation site with luxol fast blue and quantifying the percentage of white matter damage. 41 \n\nThe American Journal of Pathologyajp.amjpathol.org FTY720 when compared with control animals ( Figure 5 , C and D). Electron microscopic analysis of spinal cords from experimental mice was performed to better assess whether FTY720 treatment of mice promoted remyelination. Determination of the g-ratio, the ratio of the inner axonal diameter/ the total outer fiber diameter, is an established structural index of remyelination, with lower ratios indicating more extensive remyelination. 42 Regions of spinal cord ventral and lateral white matter tracts of JHMV-infected mice, transplanted with GFP-NPCs and treated with FTY720 or vehicle, and JHMVinfected mice treated with vehicle or FTY720 alone were analyzed ( Figure 6A ). We first determined whether FTY720 treatment alone increased remyelination in JHMV-infected mice. Our findings indicate that, although there was an overall trend toward remyelination after FTY720 treatment compared with control mice, this did not reach significance (Figure 6 , B, C, and F). Increased remyelination was observed in JHMV-infected mice that were transplanted with GFP-NPCs compared with vehicle treatment alone (Figure 6 , B, D, and F). However, FTY720 did not result in a significant increase in remyelination in GFP-NPCetreated animals compared with transplanted animals treated with vehicle alone (Figure 6 , B, E, and F). Therefore, these findings argue that FTY720 treatment does not enhance remyelination in JHMV-infected mice regardless if transplanted with GFP-NPCs.\n\nWe have previously determined that FTY720 treatment of JHMV-infected mice during acute disease results in increased mortality and limited infiltration of T cells into the CNS, which correlated with impaired ability to control viral replication within the CNS. 41 We next examined whether FTY720 treatment affected T-cell infiltration into the CNS of mice either infected with JHMV or infected and transplanted with GFP-NPCs. Mice were infected intracranially with JHMV, and mice received daily i.p. injections of FTY720 beginning at day 13 p.i. Flow analysis of T-cell infiltration into the spinal cords of infected mice isolated at day 28 p.i. indicated no differences in CD4 \u00fe or CD8 \u00fe T cells within the spinal cords of mice treated with either FTY720 or vehicle alone (Figure 7 , A and B). Moreover, infiltration of virus-specific CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells was not affected after FTY720 treatment (Figure 7, A and B) . Transplantation of GFP-NPCs into JHMV-infected mice did not affect infiltration of total CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells nor virus-specific T cells into the spinal cord (Figure 7, C and D) , and this is consistent with our previously published studies. 46 Similarly, administration of FTY720 to infected mice transplanted with GFP-NPCs did not prevent total T-cell or virusspecific T-cell entry into the CNS (Figure 7, C and D) . In addition, FTY720 did not affect T-cell infiltration into the brains of mice infected with JHMV alone or transplanted with GFP-NPCs (data not shown). We confirmed the biological activity of FTY720 during chronic disease by examining levels of circulating T cells within the blood. FTY720 significantly (P < 0.05) diminished the frequency of both CD4 \u00fe ( Figure 8A ) and CD8 \u00fe ( Figure 8C ) T cells within the blood compared with control mice. In addition, by using S1P1 eGFP knock-in mice, we determined that surface expression of S1P1, measured by eGFP expression, was also decreased (P < 0.05) on circulating CD4 \u00fe ( Figure 8B ) and CD8 \u00fe T cells ( Figure 8D ) in FTY720-treated mice when compared with control animals. Therefore, FTY720 treatment of JHMV-infected mice results in diminished levels of circulating lymphocytes that correlates with decreased S1P1 expression, and this is consistent with our earlier findings. 41 These results indicate that FTY720 does not affect T-cell migration into the CNS during chronic disease in animals, regardless of whether transplanted with GFP-NPCs or vehicle alone.\n\nThe use of stem cells for treatment of human demyelinating diseases, such as MS, to induce tissue repair offers an attractive therapy for promoting remyelination and potentially sustained clinical recovery. 11,42,47e50 After spinal cord engraftment of mouse NPCs into JHMV-infected mice, NPCs preferentially migrate to sites of demyelination by responding to the chemokine CXCL12 via expression of the receptor CXCR4. 9 However, it is likely that other signaling cues are present within this inflammatory demyelinating environment that influence NPC migration. The S1P/S1P1 axis has been shown to be involved in NPC migration to sites of damage in a model of spinal cord injury highlighting the importance of S1P receptors in mediating positional migration of NPCs. 28 Treatment of mice with FTY720 \n\nThe American Journal of Pathologyajp.amjpathol.org augments CXCR4 signaling and potentiates migration of hematopoietic stem cells. 45 Moreover, FTY720 readily penetrates the CNS, 19, 24, 33, 51, 52 arguing that it can modulate the biology of transplanted NPCs by binding to S1P receptors. Indeed, Gonzalez-Cabrera et al 53 have shown that chronic FTY720 degrades and down modulates the receptor in the CNS. FTY720 has a 17:1 brain/plasma ratio and is accumulated in the brain, providing long-term steady-state levels that drive complete receptor occupancy and degradation. Therefore, we investigated the effects of FTY720 treatment in conjunction with NPC therapy in a viral model of MS.\n\nHerein, we show that FTY720 treatment of JHMVinfected mice transplanted with GFP-NPCs results in enhanced migration of transplanted cells when compared with transplanted animals treated with vehicle control (Figure 3 , A and C). FTY720 treatment did not alter positional migration of transplanted NPCs because these cells efficiently congregated within areas of demyelination ( Figure 3, A and B) . The in vivo migration data support our in vitro experimental results showing that FTY720 treatment of cultured NPCs increases migration after exposure to recombinant mouse CXCL12, and this was independent of elevated surface expression of CXCR4 on NPCs (Figure 4, A and B) . These findings argue that a mechanism underlying enhanced NPC migration could involve an effect on CXCR4 function and/or the downstream signaling cascade, such as calcium mobilization or cytoskeleton rearrangement.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that FTY720 activates the phosphorylation of CXCR4 through S1P3 activation, followed by downstream cascade activation of Src kinase and Janus-activating kinase 2 in progenitor cells, 54 and affects CXCR4-mediated migration in hematopoietic stem cells after exposure to CXCL12. 45 Future work focusing on defining the specific S1P receptor(s) involved in elevated CXCR4 function will be critical to better understand the molecular mechanisms governing how receptor agonists/antagonists influence NPC migration mediated by CXCR4.\n\nOur findings also indicated increased numbers of GFP-NPCs within demyelinated white matter tracts of GFP-NPCs in JHMV-infected mice treated with FTY720 when compared with transplanted mice treated with vehicle control, suggesting proliferation is increased in vivo. Collectively, these results argue that FTY720 treatment increased NPC migration and proliferation following engraftment.\n\nWe have recently shown that FTY720 treatment of JHMV-infected mice during acute disease results in increased mortality that is associated with impaired migration of virus-specific T cells into the CNS and elevated viral titers within the CNS. 41 Dampened neuroinflammation correlated with increased cellularity of draining cervical lymph nodes, consistent with previous reports indicating that S1P antagonism impairs lymphocyte egress from lymphatic tissue. 19, 20, 51, 52 More important, administration of FTY720 to JHMV-infected mice during acute disease was associated with diminished severity of demyelination. These findings highlight an important role for S1P signaling in host defense during acute viral-induced neurological disease, most likely by enhancing T cells to efficiently migrate from lymphatic tissue into the CNS. In marked contrast, the present study indicates that when FTY720 treatment is initiated at day 13 p.i. with JHMV, there is no effect on T-cell accumulation within the CNS, and the severity of demyelination is not affected. We believe these differences in outcomes with regard to neuroinflammation reflect the stage of disease at which point FTY720 is administered. As indicated above, FTY720 treatment during acute disease limited egress of virus-specific T cells from draining cervical lymph nodes, thereby reducing the severity of neuroinflammation and demyelination. By day 13 p.i., surviving down-regulates sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) on T cells. Frequencies of CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells in the blood day 7 posttransplant with GFP-NPCs into JHMV-infected S1P1 eGFP mice treated daily with FTY720 or control starting at day 13 postinfection. FTY720 significantly diminishes the frequency of both CD4 \u00fe (A) and CD8 \u00fe (C) T cells and S1P1 expression measured by GFP expression on CD4 \u00fe (B) and CD8 \u00fe (D) T cells. Data are presented as means AE SEM (AeD). n Z 2 or more experiments with a minimum n Z 4 per group (AeD). *P < 0.05.

Correspondingly, treatment with FTY720 would have limited-to-no effect on disease progression at this stage of disease because the bulk of virus-specific lymphocytes have already expanded and exited the draining cervical lymph nodes and subsequently infiltrated the CNS. In addition, these data also indicate that T cells do not rely on S1P signaling for T-cell migration to the CNS during chronic disease but rather use other inflammatory signaling cues (eg, chemokines) to gain access to the CNS of JHMV-infected mice. 2, 55 Although FTY720 treatment of cultured NPCs resulted in activation, increased proliferation, and enhanced migration in response to CXCL12, there was no effect on lineage fate commitment because similar frequencies of oligodendroglia, astrocytes, and neurons were observed compared with NPCs treated with control vehicle. Similar frequencies of GFP-positive oligodendroglia expressing GST-p were detected within spinal cords of GFP-NPCetransplanted mice treated with either FTY720 or vehicle control. Although there were increased numbers of GFP-NPCs within areas of demyelination in FTY720-treated mice, we did not observe any discernable increase in remyelination. Whether this is because of functional deficits in these cells is currently unknown and is the focus of ongoing studies.\n\nWe have previously shown that engrafted NPCs can remyelinate demyelinated axons, 11 and these findings would argue that FTY720 does not increase the remyelination potential of engrafted NPCs in our model of viralinduced demyelination. This is similar to previous studies that determined that FTY720 does not induce remyelination in either the cuprizone or lysophosphatidyl choline models of demyelination. 56 However, Miron et al 57 have demonstrated that FTY720 treatment resulted in increased remyelination in organotypic cerebral slices where demyelination was induced by lysolecithin. These findings support other studies demonstrating FTY720 treatment in augmenting neurogenesis and repair in models of CNS injury, possibly by activating endogenous NPCs and/or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. 58e62 We are currently examining whether FTY720 activates endogenous progenitor cells within the CNS of JHMV-infected mice. The conflicting reports on the effects of FTY720 on remyelination highlight differences in model systems used, emphasizing the potential importance of targeting specific receptors for promoting OPC maturation and myelin synthesis. For example, by using a lysophosphatidyl cholineeinduced model of demyelination, administration of S1P5 agonist has been reported to have a greater effect on remyelination compared with S1P1 agonists. 63 FTY720 treatment of MS patients with the relapsingremitting form of disease reduced the risk of disability progression; yet, it is not clear if this is because of an increase in remyelination. 64 The fact that we did not observe any increase in remyelination in JHMV-infected mice treated with FTY720 alone would argue additional studies in preclinical models of MS with more selective S1P receptor agonists or antagonists to better understand the effects on both endogenous glial cells and transplanted NPCs with regard to promoting remyelination."}
