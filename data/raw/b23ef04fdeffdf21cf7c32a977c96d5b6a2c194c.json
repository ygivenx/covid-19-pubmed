The 31 epidemic is still spreading, and the WHO has classified the global risk level of the disease as a \"pandemic.\" 32 Currently, the earliest known case symptoms appeared on December 1, 2019, and the first case sought treatment 33 on December 8. On December 26, 2019, Wuhan City Respiratory and Intensive care doctor Zhang Jixian first 34 discovered this pneumonia with unknown cause and suspected that it is an infectious disease. Subsequently, the 35 disease broke out in Wuhan City. On January 20, 2020, Chinese academic Zhong Nanshan publicly announced 36 that the novel coronavirus pneumonia \"definitely transmits between people.\" On January 23, 2020, the Wuhan 37 City Government announced the adoption of lockdown and quarantine measures in the infected areas, which 38 was the first case of lockdown in a major city (with a population of 11 million) in recent public health history.\n\nSince January 13, the disease continued to spread to Thailand, Japan, and South Korea. On January 30, three 40 countries outside China were verified as having interpersonal propagation, and the pandemic was thus 41 designated as an international public health emergency event by the WHO.\n\nAccording to reports on the epidemic, \"the propagation speed is faster, and the virus propagation power 43 has increased.\" Infected people can infect others with the virus while exhibiting no symptoms; and the latency 44 from infection to the presentation of symptoms is as long as 14 days. These characteristics also increase the 45 difficulty of controlling the epidemic. As the epidemic continues, there is also a problem of the global 46 undersupply of surgical masks. Currently, no vaccine and remedy for the novel coronavirus have been 47 discovered. WHO assistant director-general Bruce Aylward stated that Remdesivir is currently the only drug 48 .

The first section introduces the entire study. The second 135 section is a literature review. The following third section details this study's proposed deep neural network 136 algorithm. The fourth section presents and discusses the experiment results in detail. Finally, the fifth section 137 concludes the entire study and underscores the contribution of this study and the predicted trend of the COVID-138 19 epidemic.\n\n.

In 193 the neural unit model structure in Fig. 4 (a) , the internal structure of LSTM can be divided into the input gate, 194 forget gate, and output gate. The principle of the LSTM input gate is expressed in the following formulae.\n\n.

Equation (7) allows the LSTM to decide whether to forget the related information of the previous 204 cell, at a certain probability, in which is the weight matrix, and is the offset term.\n\n206\n\nThe output gate of LSTM decides which states are required to be maintained by the input \u210e \u22121 and 207 according to Equations (8) and (9) \n\nThe deep LSTM structure proposed in this study is illustrated in Fig. 4 is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint \n\nThe principle of the GRU reset gate is described in Equation (11).
