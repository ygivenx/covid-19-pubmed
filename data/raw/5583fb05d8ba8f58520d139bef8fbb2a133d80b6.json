Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) which is a chronic, progressive, immunologically-mediated coronaviral disease [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , is one of the most important viral infections in cats with worldwide occurrence and increasing frequency [7, 8] . A feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), which causes a mild intestinal disease but not FIP in kittens, has also been isolated [9] and considered to be the result of a recombination event between virulent FIP virus (FIPV) and avirulent FIPV [10] . Feline coronavirus (FIPV and FECV) isolates thus far are divided into at least two types according to the serologic cross-reaction with canine coronavirus (CCV) by virus neutralization test (VNT) [4] , and there may be at least 2 antigenic groups of FIPV by the monoclonal antibody (mAb) analysis [10]. Human coronavirus 229E, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, CCV, FIPV and FECV compose one antigenically related group in the family of coronaviruses [1, 9, 11, 12] . Cats inoculated with CCV [13] or TGEV [14, 15] elicit immune responses against not only homologous but also heterologous virus species in the group. However, the incidence of infection in general cat population in nature with these heterologous viruses is unknown. Because FIPV has proved difficult to isolate and propagate in vitro, heterologous serologic assays (VNT, indirect immunofluorescence assay; IFA, enzymelinked immunosorbent assay; ELISA, and passive hemagglutination test) by use of antigenically related TGEV and CCV have been widely applied for detection of anti-coronavirus antibody in cats [14, 16 23] . In recent years several feline coronavirus isolates cultivable in cell cultures have led to the development of homologous serologic assays [4, [24] [25] [26] [27] .\n\nThe purpose in the present report is to evaluate ELISA that uses CCV-infected cells as antigens for coronavirus serology in cats. Canine coronavirus grows very efficiently in feline cells and the use of such virus-infected cultured cells saves laborious and expensive virus purification.\n\nA canine coronavirus, designated 5821 strain, was obtained from Dr Masayuki Ajiki, Kyoto-Biken Lab., Kyoto. This strain was originally isolated from feces of a puppy died of enteritides manifesting diarrhea and vomiting in 1984, and had been previously passaged 8 times in primary dog kidney (DK/P) cells. The virus was further cultured twice in DK/P cells and once in Crandell feline kidney (CRFK:ATCC CCL-94) cells in this laboratory, and stored at -80'C as a stock virus. Infective titer of the stock virus was determined by the plaque assay described previously [23] .\n\nThe CRFK cells were used for the plaque assay, micro-neutralization test (MNT) and ELISA. They were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Eagle's MEM :Nissui Pharm. Co., Ltd, Japan) containing 10% NU-SERUM (NUS: Collaborative Res., Inc., U.S.A.), 10% tryptose phosphate broth (Difco Lab., U.S.A.) and antibiotics \n\nTwenty-three sera and 5 ascites were collected from cats clinicopathologically suspected as FIP. One serum, 3 ascites and 2 thoracic fluids, and 2 ascites which were from the pathologically confirmed spontaneous FIP cases and possessed specific IFA antibodies against the Yayoi strain of FIPV [28] as listed in Table 1 , were obtained from The Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, and The Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Iwate University, Iwate, respectively.\n\nTwo litters of conventional kittens, which were about 6-to 8-week old, clinically normal and seronegative, were used in the experiments. Each of 5 littermate kittens was orally administered with 4.5 x 10 6 plaque forming units (PFU) of the virus. Four kittens of another litter received 7.5 x 105 PFU orally and one intramuscular dose of the triple viral vaccine (Panagen FVR*C-P; Pitman-Moore, Inc., U.S.A.) simultaneously. Each of them had another vaccine booster injection 3 weeks later. The vaccine contained a mixture of inactivated feline panleukopenia virus, and attenuated feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus which were prepared in feline cell cultures. Blood samples were taken from all kittens at appropriate intervals for a 7-week period.\n\nNeutralizing antibody titer was determined by the method of MNT described elsewhere [23] . More than 1:4 of the titer was regarded as positive.\n\nThe CRFK cells (8 \u00d7 105/ml of cell density in the Eagle's MEM/10NUS) were mixed with an equal volume of the stock virus to be at 0.05 of multiplicity of infection and 100 pl of the mixture was dispensed into each well of a 96-well, flat bottomed, polystyrene plates (Corning Glass Works, U.S.A) as described previously [23] . After 48-h incubation in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2, the cells were fixed with methanol containing 0.3% H202 for 30 min. The wells were then saturated with 250/~1 of blocking buffer which consisted of 3% gelatin in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS). After 1 h at room temperature, the blocking buffer was removed from the wells, and to which 50/~1 amounts of the test sample serially diluted in PBS containing 1% gelatin and 0.05% Tween 20 (GT/PBS) was added. The plate was incubated at 37~'C for 1 h and was washed by emptying, filling with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS from a wash-bottle and leaving for 3 min. This process was repeated 3 times. Then 50/~1 of freshly diluted 1:400 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-cat IgG goat serum (Cooper Biomedical Inc., U.S.A.) in GT/PBS was added to each well and kept for 1 h at room temperature after which plates were washed. The result was read spectrophotometrically (405 nm) by an ELISA reader (MTP-02 type; CORONA Electric Co,, Ltd, Japan) 30 min after the addition of ABTS substrate (2,2,'-azino-di(3-ethyl benzylthiazoline sulfonic acid-6)-disodium salt; Polysciences, Inc., U.S.A.) to wells. The test sample was applied to the mock-infected, normal CRFK cells in parallel with the virus-infected cells by the same manner. Optical density (OD) values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen (the corrected OD value). The ELISA titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which the corrected OD value exceeded 0.05 as shown in Fig. 1 in which typical titration curves for positive and negative sera were drawn. The ELISA titer of more than 1 : 10 was regarded as positive.\n\nAll cats manifested no clinical signs throughout the experiments. Rapid rise in both MNT and ELISA antibody titers was detected in all cats administered with CCV on the 8th day as shown in Fig. 2 . Both antibody titers gradually rose until the 30th day and declined thereafter in parallel with each other. The geometric means of ELISA titers were about 4-10 times higher than those of MNT titers.\n\nAlthough ELISA titers of pre-administration sera were regarded to be less than 1:10 by the corrected OD value, all had low reactivities (1:20-1:50) to the mock-infected, normal CRFK cell antigen as shown in Fig. 3 . The reactivities against the normal CRFK cell antigens of the cats with no vaccination did not change so drastically as those of the cats administered with the parenteral vaccine. After the vaccination the sera became to be reactive with not only the CCV-infected cell antigen but also the mock-infected cell antigen to comparable degrees. However, the OD values of each dilution of serum against the infected cell antigen were so higher than those against the control cell antigen as to generate the specific values.\n\nRelationships between MNT and ELISA titers of 28 samples from the cats suspected as FIP were shown in Fig. 4 . Twenty-three of them (82.1%) were anti-CCV MNT antibody-positive with titers of 1:4 to 1:512,000 and anti-CCV ELISA antibody with titers of 1:10 to 1:256,000 were detected in all of them. The samples with high MNT titers (1:256 or more; n = 9) had proportionally high titers of ELISA antibody as well. The calculated correlation coefficient between both MNT and ELISA titers of them was found to be r =0.907. But significantly high ELISA antibody titers (1:2,560 or more) were detected in 12 out of the other 19 samples possessing low or negative MNT titers (1 : 64 or less). Table 1 shows MNT and ELISA antibody titers against CCV of the serum and I  I  I  I  I I  I  I  1  I  I  0  10  20  50  40  50 0  10  20  :50  40  50 Days after administration the body fluids of 8 FIP cases possessing specific IFA antibodies against FIPV. In these cases, the ELISA titers but not the MNT titers against CCV were correlative with the IFA titers against homologous FIPV. However, the ELISA titers were generally lower than the IFA titers.\n\nClinical diagnosis of FIP is generally performed by evaluation of results of physical and hematological examinations, serum electropholetic analysis, and anti-coronavirus antibody testing. Moreover, biopsy in the living animal or necropsy after death are considered to be the most definitive diagnosis of FIP. The serologic tests are, however, only an aid to diagnosis because anti-coronavirus antibody can be detected not only in FIP cats but also in cats with other diseases and even in healthy animals [8, 18, 19, 22, 28, 29] . The tests used routinely for detection of anti-coronavirus antibodies in felines are IFA or ELISA in which TGEV or CCV have been popularly used as the target antigen [17q9, 21] . The results in the present study indicate that the ELISA using CCV-infected cultured cells as antigens saves laborious purified viral antigen preparation, and it detects anti-coronavirus antibodies in cat sera more extensively than the MNT using CCV, and as efficiently as IFA using homologous FIPV. However, the ELISA titers were generally lower than those obtained by the IFA as shown in Table 1 . This may result from qualitical differences of the substrate antigens (i.e. heterologous or homologous coronaviruses for cat) applied in the tests as reported by others [27] .\n\nIn the histochemical serological assays such as ELISA and 1FA, non-specific binding (both ? globulin associated and non-? globulin associated) of serum samples to the antigen preparations is often an additional problem. It has been described that most but not all of false-positive reactions are attributable to recent vaccination [17, 27, 30, 31] . Some kinds of cell culture vaccines prepared for use in cats have been commonly utilized in Japan as well. Antibodies against vaccine ingredients other than desired viral antigens, especially serum components in a tissue culture-derived vaccine, may be elicited in cats after parenteral injection and they react with antigenically similar components presented in the antigen preparations of serologic tests. Therefore serum samples should be tested in parallel against negative antigen controls and results are adjusted accordingly as in kinetics-based ELISA described by Barlough et al. [17] . In the present study, presumably because whole cultured-cell antigens were used, all cat sera showed a variety of reactivities to the mock-infected, normal CRFK cell antigens as well, and it was indispensable for generating the coronavirus-specific activity that the OD values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen.\n\nSome in vivo subtle antigenic differences among FIPV, FECV and other heterologous coronaviruses doses have been described [4, [32] [33] [34] [35] . Although recently developed competitive ELISA using type-specific mAbs may prove useful in distinguishing cats which are infected with virulent FIPV from cats infected with avirulent feline coronaviruses [36] , none of the serologic assays routinely used has been specific enough to discern the virus to which a cat had been exposed [9, 26, 27] . The ELISA using CCV-infected cultured cells in the present report does not specifically determine the type of coronavirus exposure in cats, but the results indicate that it is routinely applicable as a very simple and easy serologic test for anti-coronavirus antibody detection in cats."}
