{"title": "Real-time isothermal detection of Abalone herpes-like virus and red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus using recombinase polymerase amplification", "body": "Abalone herpes-like virus (AbHV) is a major pathogen that affects the nervous system of abalones (Corbeil et al., 2012b) . The pathogen is highly virulent for Haliotis diversicolor, but does not have any apparent effects on other abalone species (Corbeil et al., 2012a) . Abalones can be infected at all life-stages and suffer a high mortality rate. Once symptoms occur, the entire pool of abalone can die within three days. Between 1999 and 2003 , the yields of cultured abalone in China were severely affected by an epidemic of continuous outbreaks of this fatal disease. In addition to AbHV, the pathogen viral nervous necrosis virus (VNNV) can cause severe disease in fish populations. The disease caused by VNNV is known as viral nervous necrosis (VNN) or viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER) (Doan et al., 2016; Grotmol et al., 2000; Toubanaki et al., 2015a) . It is a major cause of mortality in larvae and juveniles of farmed marine fish, occurring frequently in adult fish in recent years (Chi et al., 2005; Su et al., 2015; Toubanaki et al., 2015a,b) . With a high mortality rate (80-100%), the disease can rapidly wipe out a local fish population in a week. Data from fish populations in South Korea, Japan, and China reveal that RGNNV is causing a major epidemic in East and West Asia, with strains specific to each region (Gomez et al., 2008 (Gomez et al., , 2004 Ma et al., 2015) . Over the past decade, RGNNV infection has caused severe losses to seedling production in the large-scale culture of groupers in the coastal regions of China.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most common diagnostic method for detection of AbHV infection. The TaqMan \u00ae PCR assay developed by Corbeil et al. can detect 30 copies of recombinant plasmid DNA per reaction (Corbeil et al., 2010) . There are several methods for the detection of NNV, such as enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELLSA) (Arimoto et al., 1992; Huang et al., 2001; Nunez-Ortiz et al., 2016) , immuno-fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) (Nguyen et al., 1996) , in situ hybridization (Comps et al., 1996) , reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (Gomez et al., 2008; Grotmol et al., 2000; Nishizawa et al., 1995) , reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Dalla Valle et al., 2005; Hodneland et al., 2011; Kuo et al., 2011; Mazelet et al., 2011) , reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) (Mekata et al., 2014; Sung and Lu, 2009; Wang et al., 2011) , and molecular beacon . Although these methods have their own advantages, drawbacks such as complex and time-consuming procedures, lower sensitivity, and the requirement of well-trained personnel and precise equipment, severely hinder their application in the field and popularization among farmers.\n\nRecombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), developed by Piepenburg et al., can rapidly amplify nucleic acid at a constant temperature (Piepenburg et al., 2006) . The entire reaction is performed between 37 and 39\u00b0C for 20-40 min without the requirement of a heating and cooling system. Therefore, it may be more suitable for field detection than PCR. RPA has been widely used in the life sciences, such as for food testing and clinical diagnosis, as well as in other fields (Babu et al., 2017; Boyle et al., 2014; Hill-Cawthorne et al., 2014; Mekuria et al., 2014; Miles et al., 2015; Murinda et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016a,b) . Kersting et al. developed RPA chips that can simultaneously amplify and detect three pathogens, including Neisseriagonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Kersting et al., 2014a) . Using the chip, the assay can complete detection of these three pathogens, including control plasmids, within 20 min. Abd El Wahed et al. developed a portable RT-RPA device that can identify Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a recently emerged zoonotic virus, within 3-7 min with a detection limit of 10 RNA molecules, making it as sensitive as real-time RT-PCR (Abd El Wahed et al., 2013) . Kersting et al. combined the RPA TwistAmp \u00ae nfo probe and primers with a lateral flow dipstick to achieve high sensitivity and rapid detection of the 18S rRNA gene for the parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Kersting et al., 2014b) .\n\nIn the present study, a real-time quantitative RPA method for rapid detection of AbHV and RGNNV was developed. The sensitivity and specificity of detection were evaluated by comparison with detection by conventional PCR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use RPA technology to detect both viruses, and it lays the foundation for further development of field detection methods.\n\nH. diversicolor samples infected with AbHV were collected during 1999 and 2005 from the coast of South China Sea and stored at \u221270\u00b0C until use. In the 50 selected samples, 10 were collected from 2003 in Shenzhen, 10 were collected in 2005 from Shenzhen, 10 were collected in 2009 from Guangdong Luzhou island, 10 were collected from Guangdong Xuwen, and 10 were collected in 2009 from Guangdong Shanwei. Epinephelus akaara samples infected with RGNNV were purchased from the Hainan Wanning area, where mass mortality occurred due to viral infection. Samples of sick fish show significant symptoms of NNV infection, such as black body, spiraling, whirling, or being belly-up at rest. In order to facilitate the preservation and retention of the sample, the brain tissues of the fish were collected. All animal work have been conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute Academic Committee approved this research.\n\nDNA and RNA were extracted from the muscle tissue of H. diversicolor and the brain tissue of E. akaara, respectively. DNA extraction was completed using a TIANamp Marine Animals DNA kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). Grouper Tissue used the HiPure Universal RNA kit (Magen, Suzhou, China). cDNA synthesis was performed using a PrimeSript\u2122 RT reagent kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Specific protocols followed the instructions designated in each kit. The extracted nucleic acid concentrations were determined by using a NanoDrop ND-2000 ultramicro spectro-photometer. After division into portions of equal concentration, the samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nThe primers and probes (Table 1) were designed using Primer 5.0 software based on the gene sequence of AbHV ORF38 (GenBank accession number JX453331.1) and RGNNV RNA2 (GenBank accession number AY744705.01). Corbeil et al. (2010) had reported that the primer set ORF 38, also known as ORF 49 in OsHV, yielded the best results with regard to specificity and sensitivity and was, therefore, selected for further development of the diagnostic TaqMan assay. RNA2 of NNV encodes a capsid protein, which is a relatively conserved gene (Kuo et al., 2011) .\n\nTo evaluate the specificity of the AbHV-RPA and RGNNV-RPA systems, we included additional templates as controls: Penaeus vannamei genomic DNA infected with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) (provided by Dr. Guo Zhixun),Aeromonas hydrophilagenomic DNA (provided by Dr. Su Youlu), Trachinotus ovatus genomic DNA (provided by Mr. Xu Liwen), Babylonia areolata genomic DNA, Crassostrea gigasgenomic DNA, and microbes genomic DNA from 500 mL water of abalone ponds which filtered onto a 0.22 m filtrate. Unless designated, DNA for the above samples were extracted in our laboratory. RPA specificity was tested using a TwistAmp \u00ae Basic kit (TwistDx, UK). Each reaction Table 1 The primer and probe used in this study. China) . Each plasmid contains a virusspecific gene fragment (see below) inside the pMD 18-T vector.\n\nGene fragments for each virus are as follows:\n\nAbHV:5\u2032-TGAACAGGGGTAATTGTATAGCAACTGCGTACAGTAAAACG AAAACCATGGCACATGCCATTGAAAACATCCAAGCAAACACCCAAGGC AAGTTTGTTGTTCCTTTATGCAAACAGATTCTCAAAACGACTAAAGAA ACCACGGATCAGATTGAAAGCGGTAAGAAAGA -3\u2032.

DNA was amplified using TwistAmp \u00ae Exo kit (TwistDx, UK) with the Thermal Cycler Real Time System (Eppendorf, Germany). Each reaction contained 14.7 \u03bcL rehydration buffer 1.1 \u03bcL RF (10 \u03bcM), 1.1 \u03bcL RR (10 \u03bcM), 0.3 \u03bcL Probe (10 \u03bcM), 4.6 \u03bcL ddH 2 O, 2 \u03bcL DNA (50-500 ng), and 1.2 \u03bcL MgAC (280 mM) for a final volume of 25 \u03bcL. Reactions were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Three replicates were performed for each dilution.\n\nThe primers of AbHV and RGNNV for qPCR were designed as described by Corbeil et al. (Corbeil et al., 2010) and Kuo et al. (Kuo et al., 2011) . The specific sequences are shown in Table 1 . The total reaction volume for AbHV was 50 \u03bcL, including 2 \u03bcL each of primer (10 \u03bcM), 25 \u03bcL PCR DSMix (Dongsheng, Guangdong, China), 20 \u03bcL ddH 2 O, and 50-500 ng of DNA from H. diversicolor samples infected with AbHV. Reaction volumes were the same for RGNNV except that E. akaara genomic DNA infected with RGNNV was used as the template. PCR conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 60 s, with 30 cycles, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The amplified products were visualized using 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Target bands were gel extracted and purified using a Universal DNA Purification kit (TIANGEN, Beijing, China), and subsequently ligated into the pMD \u00ae 18-T Vector (TaKaRa, Beijing, China). Plasmids were transformed into TOP 10 competent cells (TIANGEN, Beijing, China) following the instructions indicated in the kit. Finally, plasmids were prepared by plasmidTIANprep Mini Plasmid Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China), before concentrations were Standard curve from 10-fold serial dilutions (10 7 -10 2 copies) of AbHV plasmids standard in three replicates measurements.

Plasmid stocks were stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nPlasmids were serially diluted, as described above in the sensitivity of qRPA detection methods section. The AbHV-qPCR assay was performed following Corbeil et al. using the Premix Ex Taq\u2122 kit (TAKARA, Dalian, China) (Corbeil et al., 2010) . Each reaction included 12.5 \u03bcL Premix Ex Taq, 0.5 \u03bcL of each primer (10 \u03bcM), 1 \u03bcL Taq Man \u00ae Probe (10 \u03bcM), 8.5 \u03bcL ddH 2 O, and 2 \u03bcL DNA template for a final reaction volume of 25 \u03bcL. Plasmid standards used ranged from 10 to 10 8 . Reaction conditions were 95\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 95\u00b0C for 5 s, and 60\u00b0C for 30 s, with 30 cycles.\n\nThe RGNNV-qPCR assays used a fluorescent dye with the SYBR \u00ae Premix Ex Taq\u2122II kit (Tli RNase H Plus) (Kuo et al., 2011) . Each reaction contained 12.5 \u03bcL SYBR \u00ae Premix Ex, 1 \u03bcL of each primer (10 \u03bcM), 8.5 \u03bcL ddH 2 O, 2 \u03bcL plasmid standards of RGNNV. The reaction conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 95\u00b0C for 5 s, and 60\u00b0C for 45 s, with 40 cycles.\n\nTo further verify the reliability of the AbHV-qRPA and RGNNV-qRPA detection methods, we selected 50 H. diversicolor and 40 E. akaara in this study. Each sample was quantitatively detected using both qRPA and qPCR, and the results of the two methods were compared.\n\nThe specificity of the detection reactions for AbHV and RGNNV was determined by checking the cross-reactivity of the assay with different DNA viruses, bacteria, or genomic DNA. A positive signal was only detected for the AbHV-infected (positive) and RGNNV-infected (positive) samples, indicating that RPA detection methods have a good specificity (Fig. 1) .\n\nHigh concentrations of the two viruses (10 7 -10 5 copies/\u03bcL) showed a strong amplification signal within 3-5 min (Figs. 2 and 3) . The minimum detection limit is 100 copies for both viruses. The AbHV-qRPA reaction was completed in 30 min, and the RGNNV-qRPA reaction in only 20 min. In order to verify the repeatability of the test batches, we performed three independent tests. Each test yielded similar results. There was a strong linear correlation between the logarithmic concentration and the fluorescence threshold time (Ct) at different concentrations (R 2 of AbHV and RGNNV were 0.90 and 0.8558, respectively; Figs. 2 B and 3 B).\n\nIn this study, TaqMan \u00ae PCR and SYBR-Green real-time PCR were used to detect AbHV and RGNNV, respectively. The detection limits for AbHV and RGNNV were 1000 and 100 copies per reaction, respectively ( Fig. 4A and B ). Fig. 4C shows a strong linear relationship of TaqMan \u00ae PCR detection of AbHV plasmid standards between the different concentration range (10 8 -10 3 copies per reaction) and the number of cycles (Ct) on the corresponding concentration range (R 2 = 0.99). The SYBR-Green technique used to detect RGNNV also shows a strong linear relationship between Ct and number of copies at values between 10 8 -10 2 copies per reaction (Fig. 4D) .\n\nIn all, 50 H. diversicolor and 40 E. akaara were used in this study to test the correlation between the qRPA and qPCR assays. The detection percentage of samples infected with AbHV for both methods were 96% and 93%, respectively. The detection percentage of RGNNV was 97% and 95%, respectively. Additionally, these data show that there is a strong correlation between qRPA and qPCR detection (R 2 > 0.8) (Fig. 5) .\n\nTaqMan \u00ae PCR is still the primary diagnostic method for detection of AbHV (Corbeil et al., 2010) . This method can detect 30 copies of recombinant plasmids in one reaction. Previous studies have used this method to test 1673 samples from different abalone populations in Victoria and Tasmanias, showing that the sensitivity and specificity are 96.7% and 99.4%, respectively (Corbeil et al., 2010) . However, the detection limit in present studies was 1000 copies, causing it to be below the level reported in the literature and also below the AbHV-qRPA assay presented here (100 copies). Furthermore, AbHV-qRPA has an advantage when considering the reaction time and temperature. The entire reaction takes place at 37\u00b0C, without the need for a complicated heating and cooling system, and results can be obtained within 20 min. This can be compared to the TaqMan \u00ae PCR method which typically takes 1 h. Therefore, the qRPA detection method presented here can greatly improve the screening efficiency of AbHV and enable timely preventive measures.\n\nRGNNV damages the health culture of grouper populations around longer historically, so there are more reported detection methods. Based on the presence or absence of nucleic acid amplification, they can be divided into two categories. For example, ELISA (Arimoto et al., 1992; Huang et al., 2001; Nunez-Ortiz et al., 2016) , in situ hybridization (Comps et al., 1996) , and molecular beacon belong to the detection category without nucleic acid amplification. The second category is based on nucleic acid amplification and includes RT-PCR (Gomez et al., 2004; Grotmol et al., 2000; Nishizawa et al., 1995) , RT-qPCR (Dalla Valle et al., 2005; Hodneland et al., 2011; Kuo et al., 2011; Mazelet et al., 2011) , and LAMP (Mekata et al., 2014; Sung and Lu, 2009; Wang et al., 2011) , among others. The RT-qPCR assay introduced by Kuo et al. can detect as few as 10 copies of the plasmid (Kuo et al., 2011) . The same method was attempted in this study, but we were only able to detect 100 copies of the plasmid as the same detection limit as the qRPA method. The RT-qPCR assay takes 40 min to complete, while qRPA yields results within 20 min. For high copy number plasmids, qRPA can obtain results within 10 min, causing it to have a large advantage over conventional PCR methods. Additionally, the detection rate of qRPA was slightly higher than that of qPCR with shorter time using both methods to analyze the same batch of grouper samples. LAMP is another isothermal amplification detection method. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP compared with single-step RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR was described by Sung and Lu (Sung and Lu, 2009) ; they found that the detection limit of RT-LAMP was approximately 1000-fold and 10-fold higher than that of one-step PCR and nested RT-PCR, respectively (Sung and Lu, 2009 ). However, LAMP is a qualitative or semiquantitative detection method that cannot be accurately quantified. On the contrary, qRPA can perform quantification in the sample, as evidenced by a good correlation between quantification methods (R 2 > 0.85). Fig. 4 .

Therefore, we tried to reduce the reaction volume in this study. However, the RPA buffer is so viscous that it is difficult to obtain an admixture of the reaction solution. This may explain why the qRPA repeatability is not as accurate as qPCR. Before preparing the RPA reaction solution, we first configured the upstream and downstream primers, probe, and buffer. Next, we thawed the freeze-dried powder (in TwistAmp kit), and then add MgAc to the fully mixed solution to initiate the reaction. This process is more cumbersome than PCR and LAMP, resulting in increased susceptibility to environmental contamination. Although RPA has the advantage of rapid reaction and low reaction temperature, it still requires more effort to reduce reagent costs and simplify reaction steps in order to play a better role in field detection. Twist Amp \u00ae DNA amplification kits and Twist Amp \u00ae exo Probe are very expensive; the cost of each reaction of 25 \u03bcL is approximately 25 Yuan. In contrast, the price of qPCR assays is comparatively lower than that of qRPA assays; each reaction costs approximately 5 Yuan. If SYBR@Green dye is used, the cost is reduced further.\n\nOverall, we present a method of AbHV-qRPA and RGNNV-qRPA that facilitates the simple, rapid, and specific detection of pathogens in samples from animal populations in aquaculture. Our method improves the detection efficiency of viral infection and will play a positive role in the widespread monitoring of diseases in aquaculture."}
