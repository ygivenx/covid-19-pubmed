{"title": "Periodic solutions and bifurcation in an SIS epidemic model with birth pulses", "body": "Infectious diseases have tremendous influence on human and animal population sizes. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affected China in 2003, myxomatosis caused enormous decreases in the rabbit population in Australia in the 1950s, the Black Death in Europe in the 14th century killed up to a quarter of the human population. Mathematical modelling is of considerable importance in epidemiology because it may provide understanding of the underlying mechanisms which influence the spread of disease and may suggest control strategies. In the case where the infectious lose immunity and become susceptible immediately after recovering, an SIS epidemic model is used to describe the dynamics of the population [1] . Recent years have also seen wide-scope potential applications of the SIS epidemic model in various scientific fields, such as that of complex networks [2] .\n\nThe study of the SIS epidemic model mainly concerns global asymptotic stability. For example, Rass [3] obtained asymptotic stability for a multi-type SIS model, and Iannelli et al. [4] considered an age-structured epidemic model of SIS type and analyzed the global dynamical behavior for the model when the population density converges uniformly to a steady state. Global analysis of discrete-time SI and SIS epidemic models was given in [5] . Further, the complex dynamical behavior of the SIS epidemic model is discussed by using bifurcation theory. For example, Zhang et al. [6] obtained the conditions of backward bifurcation and the existence of bistable endemic equilibria. Zhang et al. [7] investigated Hopf bifurcation in a delayed SIS epidemic model with stage structure by using the normal form theory and the center manifold argument.\n\nIn the above cited papers, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) were used to build an SIS epidemic model. Impulsive differential equations (IDEs) are suitable for the mathematical simulation of evolutionary processes in which the parameters undergo relatively long periods of smooth variation followed by a short-term rapid change in their values. The study of IDEs mainly concerns the properties of their solutions, such as the existence, uniqueness, stability, boundedness, and periodicity; see [8, 9] . Sufficient conditions for the local and global stability of the susceptible pest-eradication periodic solution are found by means of Floquet theory and comparison methods in [10] . Nieto and Regan [11] present a new approach via variational methods and critical point theory for obtaining the existence of solutions to impulsive problems. The dynamics of an impulsively controlled three-trophic food chain system with general nonlinear functional responses for the intermediate consumer and the top predator are analyzed using the Floquet theory and comparison techniques in [12] . IDEs are widely used in epidemiology. For example, an SIS epidemic model with a pulse vaccination was investigated in [13] and some results are obtained for the global stability of the disease-free periodic solution as well as the existence and stability of the endemic periodic solution are investigated analytically and numerically.\n\nIn most models of population dynamics, increases in population due to births are assumed to be time independent. However, many species give birth only during a single period of the year and Caughley [14] termed this growth pattern a birth pulse. Roberts and Kao [15] proposed a model for the dynamics of a fatal infectious disease and discussed the existence and stability of periodic solutions. Tang and Chen [16] obtained an exact periodic solution and the threshold conditions for its stability by using the stroboscopic map in a single-species model. In this paper, the birth pulse is used to build an SIS epidemic model.\n\nThe existence and bifurcation of periodic solutions for an epidemic model built from ODEs have been discussed by many authors; see [6, 7] for example. However, little is known about the bifurcation theory of an epidemic model built from IDEs. Periodic boundary value problems for non-Lipschitzian impulsive functional differential equations were considered in [17] . Using a projection method, the bifurcation of positive periodic solutions for an impulsively controlled pest management mode was discussed in [18] . The complex dynamics of a Holling type II prey-predator system with state feedback control was investigated in [19] . Zhou and Liu [13] discussed the existence of a disease-free periodic solution and an endemic periodic solution by using the explicit solution. Lakmeche et al. [20] transformed the problem of periodic solution into a fixed-point problem and obtained conditions for the stability of the trivial solution and the existence of a positive period-1 solution. Many authors (for example, see [21] ) discussed only the bifurcation of a non-trivial periodic solution of an epidemic model by using the results obtained in [20] . By using the explicit solution, the stroboscopic map is obtained and used to discuss the bifurcation of the periodic solution in [16] . However, the explicit solution is not easy to obtain in an epidemic model and the bifurcation of the endemic periodic solution is difficult to discuss. Some authors investigated the complex dynamics of epidemic models, such as period-doubling bifurcation, chaos and crisis etc., by means of numerical simulations; see [22] for example. Therefore, theoretically analyzing the bifurcation theory of the SIS model is a challenging task.\n\nIn this paper, an ordinary differential system is used to build an SIS epidemic model with a birth pulse and a varying population. To study this epidemic model, we construct discrete maps and present analytical results about the complex dynamical behavior. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, an SIS epidemic model with a birth pulse and a varying population is introduced. The conditions for the existence and stability of the periodic infection-free solution are derived in Section 3. In Section 4, the existence and stability of the positive periodic solution are discussed. Bifurcation analysis of the SIS epidemic model is given in detail in Section 5. The parameter value at which the epidemic periodic solution bifurcates from the infection-free periodic solution is calculated. The conditions of existence for flip bifurcation are derived by using the center manifold theorem and the bifurcation theorem. The numerical results are presented in Section 6, to verify the theoretical analysis, and the conclusion is presented in Section 7, finally.\n\nA classical SIS epidemic model was introduced by Kermack and McKendrick [1] . On the assumption that recovery from the nonfatal infective disease does not confer immunity, one particular case of this classical SIS epidemic model is\n\nwhere the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to time, S(t) is the susceptible component of the population, I(t) is the infected component of the population, \u00b5 represents a constant birth rate, \u03b2 is the average number of adequate contacts with susceptibles for an infective individual per unit time, \u03c3 is the natural death rate and \u03b4 is the rate at which infective individuals lose immunity and return to the susceptible class. The dynamics of system (1) is simple. There exists a unique positive equilibrium\n\nin (1) for \u03b2\u00b5 > \u03c3 (\u03c3 + \u03b4). Nucci and Leach [23] presented an explicit solution of (1) by means of the Painlev\u00e9 analysis and the Lie theory of transformation groups.\n\nIn system (1), \u00b5 represents a constant birth rate, which means that the population is born throughout the year. However, many species give birth only during a single period of the year and Caughley termed this growth pattern a birth pulse. In most cases, the birth pulse is assumed to be the linear birth pulse N = pN [24] , where N = S +I. Roberts and Kao [15] considered the birth pulse\n\nIn paper [16] , B(N) = b exp(N) \u2212 1 and B(N) = p q+N n \u2212 1. In this paper, the birth pulse is taken as\n\nis the maximum birth rate, d is the maximum death rate, r is a parameter reflecting the relative importance of density-dependent population regulation through births and deaths. If r = 0 all density dependence acts through the death rate, and if r = 1 all density dependence acts through the birth rate. The newborn population is assumed to be susceptible to disease, that is, S = (b\u2212c(S +I))(S +I) and I = 0. Now, on the basis of the impulsive differential equations, we develop system (1) by introducing periodic birth pulses and obtain the following epidemic model with birth pulses:\n\nwhere 0 < b < 1, c > 0, the meanings of parameters \u03b2, \u03c3 , and \u03b4 are the same as in model (1), n \u2208 N + , T is the time between two consecutive birth pulses, S(t) = S(t + ) \u2212 S(t), S(t + ) are the quantities of susceptible components of the population after the birth pulse and S(t\n\nFor more details about impulsive systems see [8, 9] .\n\nThe epidemic model (2) is considered in the region \u2126 = {(S, I)|S \u2265 0, I \u2265 0, S + I < b c exp(\u03c3 T )} in this paper. On the boundary line l 1 :\n\nThe trajectory originating from this initial point remains in region \u2126 for t \u2208 [0, T ). This trajectory reaches the point (S 1 ,\u012a 1 ) at time T , and next jumps to the point (S 1 , I 1 ) with the effect of the birth pulse, whereS 1 \n\nIn this section, infectious individuals are entirely absent from the population permanently, i.e.,\n\nSuppose the value of S(t) is S k for t = kT ; then the solution for the first equation of system (3) is\n\nfor the effect of the impulse. Thus we obtain the one-dimensional discrete map\n\nFor each fixed point of the map (4) there is an associated periodic solution of system (3), and vice versa. The fixed points of map (4) are\n\nIn the case of the fixed point S 01 ,\n\nIn the case of the fixed point S 02 ,\n\n, the fixed point S 02 is stable, that is the infection-free periodic solution\n\nof system (2) is stable.\n\nThere are three ways in which a fixed point P of a discrete map f : R n \u2192 R n may fail to be hyperbolic, that is, Df (P) has an eigenvalue +1, an eigenvalue \u22121 or a pair of complex eigenvalues \u03bb, \u03bb with |\u03bb| = 1 [25] . The bifurcation associated with the appearance of eigenvalue 1 is called a fold (or tangent) bifurcation. This bifurcation is also referred to as a limit point, saddle-node bifurcation, and turning point, among others. The bifurcation associated with the appearance of eigenvalue \u22121 is called a flip (or period-doubling) bifurcation.\n\nFrom the above, the trivial solution of system (2) is stable for T > 1 \u03c3 ln(1 + b) and the infection-free periodic solution (6) of system (2) is stable for 1 \u03c3 ln\n\n; then a bifurcation occurs at T = 1 \u03c3 ln(1 + b). Moreover, F (S 01 ) = 1 and F (S 02 ) = 1 for T = 1 \u03c3 ln(1 + b); hence this bifurcation is a fold bifurcation. Then the following result is obtained.\n\nProposition 3.1. A fold bifurcation occurs at T = 1 \u03c3 ln(1 + b) in system (2) . The trivial solution of system (2) is stable for\n\nIn this section, we discuss the existence and stability of the positive periodic solution (S(t), I(t)), where S(t) > 0 and I(t) > 0. To obtain the explicit solution of system (2) , let\n\nIt follows from (2) \n\nSet the initial point of system (8) \n\nFrom (9) and (10), we obtain the following discrete map:\n\nFor each fixed point of the map (11) there is an associated periodic solution of system (2), and vice versa. For the facts that N(t) = S(t) + I(t) and M(t) = 1 I(t) , the discussion of equilibrium (0, 0) of map (11) is meaningless; we omit it here. Now suppose that the positive fixed point of map (11) \n\nFor N 0 > 0 and M 0 > 0, the following conditions are needed:\n\nthat is,\n\nHence there exists a nonlinear periodic solution in system (8) under condition (14) . Now we discuss the stability of this positive periodic solution. The associated characteristic polynomial of the fixed point\n\nIt is easy to calculate that \u22121 < \u03bb 1 < 1 for 0\n\nand then 0 < \u03bb 2 < 1.\n\nThus, under condition (14) and\n\n\u22121 < \u03bb 1 < 1 and 0 < \u03bb 2 < 1, which means that the periodic solution of system (8) is stable. Thus the following proposition about the existence and stability of an epidemic periodic solution of system (2) is obtained. \n\nSystem (2) has a stable positive periodic solution.\n\nIn this subsection, we deal with the problem of the bifurcation of the positive periodic solution of system (2) near the infection-free periodic solution. In the following, b is viewed as a parameter. As shown in Section 3, the infection-free periodic solution of system (2) is\n\nIt follows from (7) and (11) that the positive periodic solution of system (2) is\n\nnT \u2264 t < (n + 1)T ,\n\nwhere M 0 is shown in (12) .\n\nLet N(t) = S(t) + I(t); system (2) \n\nwhich are satisfied with G 2 (N, 0) \u2261 0, \u03b8 2 (N, 0) \u2261 0, \u03b8 1 = 0 for N = 0 and \u03b8 2 = 0 for I = 0. Let \u03c8 be the flow associated with (18) ,\n\nfollowing notation is given in paper [17] :\n\nThe result concerning the bifurcation of the positive periodic solution is the following Lemma: For more details see Ref. [17] . The semi-trivial periodic solution and the positive periodic solutions are given in (16) and (17) ; then the bifurcation of the positive periodic solution does occur in our case. In what follows, we just calculate the value of the parameter b at which the bifurcation occurs. In our case,\n\nThen we get the following result. \n\nAs mentioned in Section 3, the bifurcation associated with the appearance of the eigenvalue \u22121 is called a flip (or perioddoubling) bifurcation. Hence (N 0 , M 0 , 3 exp(\u03c3 T ) \u2212 1) is a candidate for a flip bifurcation point. Viewing b as a parameter, we discuss flip bifurcation of system (2) by using the map (11) and the following lemma. \n\nThen there is a smooth curve of fixed points of f \u00b5 passing through (x 0 , \u00b5 0 ), the stability of which changes at (x 0 , \u00b5 0 ). There is also a smooth curve \u03b3 passing through (x 0 , \u00b5 0 ) such that \u03b3 \\ (x 0 , \u00b5 0 ) is a union of hyperbolic period-2 orbits.\n\nFor the proof of Lemma 5.2, refer to Ref. [25] . In (F 2 ) the sign of\u0101 determines the stability and the direction of bifurcation of the orbits of period 2. If\u0101 is positive, the orbits are stable; if\u0101 is negative they are unstable. (2) . For some > 0, system (2) has a stable 2T -periodic solution for b \u2208 (3 exp(\u03c3 T ) \u2212 1, 3 exp(\u03c3 T ) \u2212 1 + ).\n\nProof. It follows from Section 4 that one of the eigenvalues of the fixed point\n\nis a candidate for a flip bifurcation point. Map (11) may be rewritten as\n\nwhere\n\nThe map f \u00b5 : R \u2192 R in Lemma 5.2 is one-dimensional while the map (20) is two-dimensional in our case. The center manifold theorem is used here to obtain a one-dimensional map; hence, flip bifurcation is discussed. (12) that the fixed point of map (20) is\n\nLetting u = x \u2212 x 0 , v = y \u2212 y 0 andb = b \u2212 3 exp(\u03c3 T ) + 1, we transform the fixed point (x 0 , y 0 ) of map (20) to the origin; then the map (20) becomes\n\nOn using\n\nwhere\n\nIf we let\n\nand use the translation\n\nwhere\n\nNow the center manifold theorem is used to determine the nature of the bifurcation of the fixed point (x,\u1ef9) = (0, 0) at b = 0. There exists a center manifold for (26) which can be represented as follows:\n\nIn view of the form of f (x,\u1ef9,b), it is not necessary to calculate h x,b in our case, and the map restricted to the center manifold is given b\u0233\n\nThus \u2202f \u2202b \n\nSince\u0101 > 0 in (F 2 ), then the positive 2T -periodic solution is stable. This also means that for some > 0, system (2) has a positive stable 2T -periodic solution for b \u2208 (3 exp(\u03c3 T ) \u2212 1, 3 exp(\u03c3 T ) \u2212 1 + ). Thus we complete the proof of Proposition 5.2.\n\nNow consider the following example: Thus conditions (H 1 ) and (H 2 ) hold. From Proposition 4.1, system (29) has a stable positive periodic solution (see Fig. 2(a) ). It is seen from Fig. 2 (b) that the solution with the initial point (4, 0.96) of system (29) tends to this positive periodic solution with t increasing.\n\nNow set c = 0.5, T = 0.5. From (19) and (27), that is, period-adding bifurcation, occurs. A period-2 solution bifurcates from the epidemic periodic solution. It is seen from Fig. 3(a) that the numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical results and system (29) possesses rich dynamics including different kinds of bifurcation and periodic windows. Fig. 3(b) shows the period-3 window. The period-3 solution is stable for b \u2208 (3.448, 3.462) and another flip bifurcation occurs at b = 3.462.\n\nIt is seen from the bifurcation diagram Fig. 3 that there exist periodic solutions. Fig. 4 shows the 1T -periodic, 2T -periodic, and 3T -periodic solutions in system (29) with b = 2.45, b = 2.492, and b = 3.46, respectively. Both theoretical and experimental investigation have revealed that the three main routes to chaos are the route via torus bifurcation, the perioddoubling route, and intermittency. From Fig. 3(a) , we know that the route to chaos is period-doubling bifurcation in our case. Fig. 4(d) shows that chaos does exist in system (29) for b = 3.2.\n\nThe dynamics of an SIS epidemic model with birth pulses and a varying population was studied in this paper. It was seen that the dynamics of impulsive system (2) is very rich and interesting, although the corresponding system (1) without impulses is very simple. The existence and stability of the infection-free periodic solution (S(t), 0) and positive periodic It is shown that the trivial solution of the system is stable for T > 1 \u03c3 ln(1+b), the infection-free periodic solution is stable for 1 \u03c3 ln (1+b) 3 < T < 1 \u03c3 ln(1 + b), and the time period between two consecutive births T is important for the population S(t) + I(t). For avoiding extinction, T should be less than 1 \u03c3 ln(1 + b). A positive periodic solution (period 1) bifurcates from this infection-free periodic solution at b = b * (19) through a supercritical bifurcation; a period-2 solution bifurcates from this positive periodic solution (period 1) at b = 3 exp(\u03c3 T ) \u2212 1 through flip bifurcation (period-doubling bifurcations). The numerical results show that the chaotic solution is generated via a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations."}
