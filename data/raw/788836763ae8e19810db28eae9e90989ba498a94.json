{"title": "Perception of emergent epidemic of COVID-2019 / SARS CoV-2 on the Polish Internet", "body": "Although a large part of the Polish population has heard about coronaviruses for the first time a few weeks ago, in reality they face less dangerous coronaviruses causing simple cold all the time. Only the emergence of a novel strain from Wuhan gave the word \"Coronavirus\" a new meaning. Before disease introduction, less than a half of surveyed Poles believed that corona virus is the most important topic in the second half of February 2020 (IBRIS [1] ). The disease was not detected in Poland until 03.03.2020, but this topic was relatively important already before introduction and started to drive media and social life after the disease introduction. During opinion poll performed on 09.03.2020 and 10.03.2020, 63% of respondents reported, that this is a serious threat for Poland, 40% that this is a serious threat for their family and 73% that this is a serious threat for the Polish Economy ( [2] ). We observe several small peaks of interest on the Internet for Coronavirus in Poland, although the largest surge in interest occurs after the official confirmation of the virus introduction to Poland .\n\nRecently social media activities are being analyzed worldwide to better understand perception and spread of diseases. This helps in some cases to track the spread of diseases (Ginsberg et al. [3] , Lu et al. [4] , Joshi et al. [5] ) with a higher precision than other methods. The Internet is a good ground for propagation of views often contradicting the current state of medical knowledge [6] . Social media can serve as a valuable source of information as well as disinformation about the virus globally, fueling panic and creating so-called infodemic , at unprecedented speed and massively desrupting entire countries such as Italy (Guardian [7]).\n\nPropaganda and persuasion techniques are widely used on the Internet easily reaching certain target groups susceptible to conspiracy theories and effectively polarizing societies, possibly due to the interference by foreign intelligence [8] . Panic-related behaviors accompanying a virus outbreak [9] are influencing the epidemic spread Perra et al. [10] , Fenichel et al. [11] , Wang et al. [12] , with the Internet being the main mediating mechanism. This could lead to destructive collective behavior, such as e.g. xenophobia against people from affected countries. This is reflected on the Internet as symbolic violence and hate -quote from Twitter: \"Chinese should be banned from entering our country\".\n\nIn this work, by quantitative analysis of digital traces on the Internet (e.g. social media), we reconstruct the superficial sociological picture of the discourse around COVID-19 in the following key dimensions as the number and nature of social media events such as information queries and social network analysis.\n\nUp to our knowledge there were no previous studies quantitatively linking the Internet activities and risk All rights reserved.

We see a small peak around 25.01.20 (e.g. death of Liang Wudong) and around 29.01.20 (e.g. first case in Germany); 2. from the end of February till beginning of March (when the number of infections rapidly increased in Italy). We see a clear peak around 27.02.20 (e.g. fake news about possible introduction of the disease to Poland [21] ).\n\nAfter the first confirmed case in the country we can see a peak on that day (04.03.20) and substantial growth after important measures were implemented by Polish authorities (09-11.03).\n\nPeople are looking for information on further epidemiological topics related to infection and epidemics as well [ Fig. 2 ]. It should be noted that professional vocabulary such as \"hand hygiene\" practically does not appear in queries (below the \"noise threshold\" compared to other epidemiological terms [ Fig. 2] ). Issues related to hand hygiene have a peak in late February and beginning of March. Masks search had their peak of popularity at the end of February and the lack of increase in popularity in March (compared to other epidemiological dates) may be due to the success of information campaigns on their low effectiveness or simply due to the lack of the masks on the market.\n\nSearch activity for information on infection in Poland is still much lower than in countries with high mobility (Lai et al. [22] ) and already confirmed cases of infection . Such a peripheral location of Poland (among others) lead to the first confirmed case introduced by land rather than by air (Interdisciplinary [23] ).\n\nIn the corresponding semantic networks we recognize the most common co-occurring phrases in the search engine together with the word \"Coronavirus\" [Fig. 3 ]. Such a network contains information on how the predictor -the corona virus noun -relates to its arguments in a query phrase ( [24] ). All rights reserved.

The intensity of queries with the phrases \"quarantine\", \"protective mask\", \"hand washing\", \"hand disinfection\" ( \"kwarantanna\" \"maseczka ochronna\", \"mycie r\u0105k\", \"dezynfekcja r\u0105k\") in Polish Google (01/01-11/03/2020) generated using the Google Trend tool. Disease introduction marked with the blue vertical line Before virus introduction, we observed [ Fig. 3 ], that most often the questions are associated with a threat, e.g. if it is / will reach / to Poland / close to Poland; can one die / how it kills (czy jest / dotrze w / do Polski(ce) / blisko Polski; czy mo\u017cna umrze\u0107 / jak zabija).

No data is available before 10.02.2020, due to changes in the title of the articles together with the name of the virus and disease by WHO.\n\nWe choose EventRegistry (EventRegistry [29] ) as a traditional media search engine because it has a large range of online magazines representing various political sites. In addition, it gives priority to the digital versions of other broadcasting channels, including television, radio or newspapers. Between January 31 and March 11, 10755 (before 4603 and 6152 after introduction) representative articles were selected (the non-systematic sampling method was applied).\n\nIn the traditional media the weekly seasonality of the articles and 3 peaks of interest: at the end of January, the second half of February and the beginning of March can be cleary seen [ Fig. 5 ].\n\nTwitter in Poland has relatively low popularity (~3 million registered users or less than 8% of the population) and is mainly used by expats, journalists and politicians (Sotrender [30] ). However, Twitter provides an API for data acquisition available to general public almost for free. This allowed us to analyze not only content of tweets, but also their context (location, retweeting, commenting, etc.). A lot of interest in infection can be seen on Twitter in Polish (210182 tweets with #Koronawirus in about 50 days).\n\nThere is not so much attention on Twitter until late February 2020. There are peaks on 27.02.20 (fake All rights reserved.

[32] ) methods to the Twitter data, we build a network with vertices representing Twitter accounts and edges representing retweets (Jarynowski et al. [33] ).\n\nThe network revealed various connections (social impact, trust, friendship, etc.) between accounts being social actors and the characteristics of the actors (political affiliation, views, etc.). We choose to illustrate the situation before disease introduction, because there was no massive attention of the topic yet, so it was easier to demonstrate important features such as communities and influential actors. An unsupervised weighted Louvain algorithm (Blondel et al. [34] ) for community analysis was used for this purpose and the vertices were colored the same color if they belongs to the same community. Retweet network [ Fig. 7 ] shows how the discourse is divided into the ruling party (gray), opposition (orange) and the protestant religious and political group / \"Idz pod prad\" (light blue).\n\nIn addition, further discourse participants were identified [ Fig. 7 ]. The subject of \"Coronavirus\" in Poland has conflict-generating potential. As a consequence a dispute has emerged between the ruling party promoting information content and confirming the belief that the Polish state is well prepared to fight the virus (gray cluster), and the opposition negating its ability to fight the virus [ Fig. 7 ]. However, the most distinglish discourse is repesented in the cores of the net [ Fig. 7] and boundaries between communities are more blured than it was before confirmation of the first case in Poland ( [15] ). It could mean, that (at least in this weekly resolution) for average Twitter user, mechanisms of building community (for example to help neigbors and support healthworkers) are less politicly driven as it was before.\n\nFor example, Twitter accounts classified already as potentially belonging to the so-called trolls (which All rights reserved.

[36] ), promoted content in the buffer area (attacking both the ruling party and the mainstream opposition).\n\nWe also looked on the most frequent words after steaming excluding Stop words [Tab. I]. There are mainly words related to topics around health, but with and politicical context, due to the political and journalistic bias of Twitter. In comparition to situation before first confrimed case ( [15] ), there is less politics and there in no fear in such extend All rights reserved.

The most popular post in the Vlog category in January 2020 was a video material titled \"Wuhan market\" on SA Ward\u0119ga's profile (@sawardega), which was eventually marked as containing false information (Sotrender [38] ).\n\nThere are other social platforms not covered by this study such as Instagram (a popular platform among teenagers with affinity index>120 in this age category ([39])). The topic of Coronavius was not so popular at Polish Instagram until the disease introduction. The most popular hashtag after introduction of the virus \"odwolajcieszkolyxd\" and is related to school closures.\n\nFor a better topic coverage blogs (e.g. blog Media@jesion gathers hundreds thousands entries be day ( [40] ) and user comments in Internet media presents addition reach information source. E.g. articles from media such as wp.pl, onet.pl, interia.pl have billions entries monthly and their articles on Coronavirus reaches on average dozens of thousands entries with hundreds of comments ( [16] ).\n\nTo compare the interest on COVID-19 on different Internet platforms we visualized the available queries time series together and marked events important to the Polish public [ Fig. 9 ]. From the time series as well as Google queries semantics [ Fig. 3 ] and tags/topics in the news, we observe that geographal proximity of All rights reserved.

We see that traditional news agencies (well represented in Event Registries) as well as Google search could anticipate and form more distinct interest peaks than social media platforms. We detected the lags between different platforms for given topics (e.g news from event registry are ahead of comentatory media in fake news on possible introduction). The stronger lag is observed between EventRegitry (the most ahead of) and Twitter (the most delay). Moreover, Twitter (15% penetration rate among Polish Internet users) has significantly different time pattern than other analyzed platforms. In particular, it does not have China-related phase at all and it has at least 3-fold faster growth rate than other media in epidemic and mitigation phase.\n\nTo quantify the correlation in interest on different platforms we calculated Pearson correlations coefficients between the time sereis [ Fig. 10 ]. All measured intensities are positively correlated. Protective mask as a signal of fear/perception of risk is less correated with other variables more related to information needs. Protective mask and washing hands is much less correlated than protective mask and hand disinfection, which could mean, that people search for professianal solutions rather thans simple and practical ones.\n\nMoreover, high amounts of searching terms as antiviral mask (there is no such a medical term) is suggesting that people are searching colloquial meaning of items ( [15] ).

After the disease introduction to Poland, there is a peak on the introduction day and fast growth of interest in epidemic and mitigation phase [ Fig. 9 ]. Under conditions of a market-consumer society, private goals of individuals come into conflict with responsibility of the whole society or community. For example, economic consequence of supply and demand lead to price increases of medical devices ( [43] ).\n\nDue to the data availability, only by analyzing Twitter we have the full control over the methodology and research techniques. The most difficult is the access to Facebook data, despite the highest population penetration and the largest ranges, Facebook does not allow automated analysis (Facebook [44] ) for the public and we can only rely on manual work-intensive research of commercial companies (Sotrender [30, 38] ), whose research methodology may differ from scientific standards. However, there are attempts to use available Facebook Ads campaigns in context to \"Coroanavirus\" [45] , which is available.\n\nIn order to prepare and manage the crisis in an optimal way, a deeper perception analysis in the form of reliable quantitative and qualitative analysis is required. Especially, according to the results of empirical research (Taranowicz [46] ), society expects institutional activities and in the event of an epidemic, it is the \"state (...) that is responsible for the poor health of the population\". Perhaps one of the reasons the Chinese have been so successful in controlling the spread of the infection is that social media like Wechat (Wang et al. [47] , Zhang et al. [48] ), or Internet forums (Liu and Lu [49] ) were analyzed by algorithms (Lu et al. [50] , Paul and Dredze [51] , Salathe et al. [52] ) with a goal to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Combining the behavior changes detected via social media analysis with the detailed information on human mobility via e.g. mobile phone tracking (Schneider et al. [53] ), sophisticated computational models of infectious disease spread could be implemented (Belik et al. [54] , Vespignani [55] ) allowing to simulate various scenarios and assess possible human and economic losses. Furthermore, impact of public information campaigns could be measured by internal surveys of public opinion. In addition, Internet media analysis could fill gaps in socio-medical research on collective actions during an important public health disruption event such as infectious diseases.
