{"title": "Xing Q-S, Prolonged Viral Shedding in Feces of Pediatric Patients with Coronavirus Disease", "body": "On December 12, 2019, 27 pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 1 The etiological agent was identified as a novel pathogen and was later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the world health organization (WHO). 2, 3 The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) has wreaked havoc in China and spread rapidly to 188 countries and regions, constituting a global threat with the highest risk impact. 4, 5 Epidemiological evidence gained in China suggested that most individuals lack relevant immunity and are generally susceptible to the virus. The majority of published studies of COVID-19 focused on adult populations. [6] [7] [8] [9] While knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are still yet to be fully developed and a limited number of studies on pediatric patients are currently available. [10] [11] [12] As of February 23, 2020, a cumulative total of 60 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, of which three cases were children under 10 years of age. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the stool of these children [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] days after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory specimens. Whereas the majority of adult patients had negative results of nucleic acid testing in respiratory and fecal specimens synchronously. Prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces after showing negative in respiratory specimens may be an infectious source of COVID-19 in the community and a threat to public health if fitness for discharge is based on the current version of Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (\"with normal body temperature for more than 3 days\", \"with obvious features of absorption of inflammation shown in lung imaging\" and \"negative results of the nucleic acid tests of respiratory pathogens for consecutive two times [sampling interval at least 1 day]\"). 13 This study aimed to characterize the dynamic profiles of viral shedding in respiratory and fecal specimens in children with COVID-19.\n\nFrom January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, a total of 60 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. We recruited all three pediatric patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were reported by the local health authority. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the WHO interim guidance 14 . Patients were followed up on a regular basis after hospital discharge till March 10, 2020, the final date of follow-up.\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Commission of Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital (QFFLL-KY-2020-11) and written informed consent was obtained from patients' legal guardians prior to enrolment.\n\nPersonal, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes information were obtained with standardized data collection forms from electronic medical records. Additionally, we directly contacted patients' families to ascertain recent exposure history, epidemiological and symptom information. Data were entered into a computerized database and double-checked by two researchers independently.\n\nThroat swabs were obtained from patients on admission. Fecal specimens were first collected in two patients (case 1 and case 2) on day 4 after onset of the disease. While the stool sample from another patient (case 3) was obtained 9 days after hospital discharge. To monitor the dynamic changes of viral shedding, we obtained throat swabs from patients every day during hospitalization and every other day during follow-up after discharge. Fecal specimens were collected applying a similar rationale since the first day of sample collection (samples from case 3 were only collected during follow-up period). Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a commercial kit approved by the China Food and Drug Administration as described previously. 8 The PCR assay simultaneously amplified two target genes of SARS-CoV-2 included open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N). A cycle threshold (Ct) value no more than 40 with evident amplification curve was considered as a positive test, and a value of 40 indicated the virus was molecularly undetectable. Ct values were used to approximately reflect the viral load (inversely related to Ct value) in respiratory tract and digestive system, a method suggested in recent studies on a similar topic. 2,12\n\nThree pediatric patients were identified between January 17, 2020 and February 23, 2020. All the three pediatric cases had household contacts with adults whose symptoms developed Laboratory findings of these children on admission to hospital are shown in Table 2 We suspected whether this phenomenon also existed in the third pediatric patient (case 3,\n\n6-year-old female) who was admitted in another designated hospital in Qingdao.\n\nUnfortunately, by the time we reached the patient, this child had already been \"cured\" and discharged. Medical professionals of this hospital did not collect fecal specimens from the patient and they only performed RT-PCR testing for throat swabs plus CT according to days after viral RNA in respiratory specimens turning negative. Detailed information was not available as no fecal sample was examined during hospitalization.\n\nThe newly issued report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 summarized the evidence so far on SARS-CoV-2 and pointed out 2.4% of those infected were individuals below 18 years of age. 16 According to data released by the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 0.9% of COVID-19 patients were children under the age of 10 years. 17 Among the 60 patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 in Qingdao, three cases were children younger than 10 years of age.\n\nIn general, pediatric patients of COVID-19 had mild disease with good treatment response and a relatively short time to resolution. [10] [11] [12] Consistent with previous findings, the three infected children in our study only presented with fever and mild cough or with no obvious symptom but non-typical radiological abnormalities. From available data, children appeared to be slightly affected by SARS-CoV-2, a feature resembling that of SARS-CoV emerged 17 years ago. 18 However, the relatively low attack rate of COVID-19 in children could be explained by the stringent implementation of home confinement and prolonged school closure during the outbreak as required by the Chinese governments. Whether it is also the case during school year is hard to tell. One distinct feature of pediatric cases is that the majority of them are infected through household contact with adult patients. 10, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] As with all new diseases, many characteristics of COVID-19 still remain unknown. There is a paucity of data to support the notion that children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection or virus transmission is less effective among them. Viral RNA has been constantly detected in stool samples and anal swabs collected from confirmed cases of COVID-19. 6, 12, [24] [25] [26] [27] In one study, fecal specimens from 9 (53%) of 17 patients were positive for nucleic acid testing, although viral loads of the stool were less than those of respiratory samples. 26 after showing negative in nasopharyngeal swabs. 12 The researchers also found that viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract might be greater and last longer than that in the respiratory system, a finding also in line with our study. Xiao and colleagues demonstrated that about a quarter of COVID-19 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectable in feces after viral clearance in respiratory tract. 27 However, these researchers did not address whether persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was more common in certain age group than the others (patient's ages ranged from 10 months to 78 years in this study). Therefore, patients who are discharged on the basis of current guidelines depending on respiratory tract test might be a potential source of viral transmission and follow-up of recovered patients during convalescent phase is advisable.\n\nIn \n\nThe corresponding authors have full access to all data in this study and attest that all listed authors meet authorship criteria and that no others meeting the criteria have been omitted.
