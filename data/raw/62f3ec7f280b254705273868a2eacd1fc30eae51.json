{"title": "AIDS-Myelopathy A Neuropathological Study", "body": "Neurological complications of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) develop in. up to 50 % of AIDS-patients 14 . They cause considerable morbidity and mortality and may be the main presenting manifestation of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 28. HIV is related to diseases of the cerebrum, the spinal cord and the peripheral nerves 25 and seems to playa significant role in the pathogenesis of HI V-encephalopathy, the major morphological substrate of the AIDS-Dementia-Complex Neuropathological investigations were carried out on 166 HIV-positive patients with and without AIDS16. Eight patients (5 %) with AIDS-manifestations had a VM and are the basis of this report. Clinical data and results of the general autopsy are given in Table 1 . The postmortem interval ranged from 24 to 48 hours. All CNS-material was fixed in 10 % formalin for at least two weeks. The cerebrum was dissected in coronal, brain stem and spinal cord into horizontal slices. In only four cases was the whole spinal cord available for examination, in the other four cases only the upper cervical cord or medulla could be examined. After paraffin embedding the following stains or reactions were performed: hematoxylin eosin, Kluver-Barrera myelin stain, Nissl, PAS and Bodian silver stain. Selected slides were processed for immunohistochemistry by the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase complex (ABC) using diaminobenzidine as chromogen? The following monoclonal antibodies were employed: KP \n\nAll patients were male, the average age at death was 32 years (range 20 to 43). Three patients were homosexual and five were intravenous drug addicts. All but two patients had a full-blown AIDS-syndrome at the time they developed their first neurological symptoms. The average duration of clinical AIDS was two years (range 1 to 4), when defining the onset of clinical AIDS as the time of presentation with the first opportunistic infection or Kaposi sarcoma. In two patients (patients 6 and 8 in Table 1 ) AIDS-infection was diagnosed only when neurological symptoms developed. These comprised an organic psycho syndrome (apathy, somnolence and dementia). HIV-associated myelopathy was suspected in five cases because of symptoms like gait disturbance caused by AIDS-Myelopathy . 59 paraparesis, and neurogenic bladder. In the other three cases no spinal cord symptoms were present and the myelopathy was discovered only at autopsy (patients 2, 7 and 8 in Table 1 ). The spinal cord symptoms developed three to 18 months prior to death. Four patients had evidence of predominantly sensory neuropathy.\n\nThe general autopsy revealed infections and tumors typical for AIDS.\n\nThe macroscopic examination of the brain showed necrotic lesions in different lobes in cases 1 and 4 and -in a periventricular distribution-in cases 5 and 8 ( Table 2 ). The gross appearance of the spinal cord and dura was normal in all cases.\n\nMicroscopically in five cases a HIV-encephalopathy with a maximum of changes in the deep white matter was found. Vacuolation of the white matter tracts was a conspicuous feature and involved the capsula intern a in three cases (cases 2, 3 and 5 in Table 2 ). It was, however, always accompanied by macrophage infiltration with formation of multinucleated cells. Two cases presented with a metastatic aspergillus encephalitis and a CMVencephalitis ( Table 2) .\n\nThe myelopathy was characterized by a vacuolation of the spinal cord white matter. The vacuoles were associated with lipid laden macrophages, which excluded a mere Table 2 ). The changes were distributed throughout the spinal white matter in a multifocal and sometimes asymmetric fashion without restriction to anatomic tracts. The vacuoles were mostly found in the posterior and lateral columns where they showed confluence to the so-called \"Liickenfelder\" in some cases. The anterior and anterolateral fiber tracts were the least involved. No isolated degeneration of the posterior columns was found. The evaluation of the longitudinal distribution of changes is limited by incomplete tissue sampling. In all cases but one (case 6 in Table 2 ) midthoracic levels were especially severely affected; but also the neighbouring cervical or lumbar sections showed severe changes. The spinal roots were unremarkable; only in one case a modest focal demyelination of some lumbar posterior roots was seen.\n\nThe posterior root ganglia of only two cases could be investigated and were morphologically normal. The vacuolation involved also motoric and sensory tracts of the brain stem; in the medulla oblongata the pyramids showed marked involvement in five cases (Table 2) . A systematic degeneration of the distal parts of the fiber tracts, suggesting a dying back phenomenon, was lacking. The picture also differed from Wallerian degeneration because axonal spheroids were only seldom found at the level of the most severe degeneration and there was no clear craniocaudal gradient of degeneration. The vacuoles were of different origins. Most of them consisted of swollen myelinated fibers and were characterized by a thin myelinic rim. The majority of vacuoles were optically empty, others contained normal looking axons, which were located either at the center or at the periphery of the vacuole. Some vacuoles harboured lipid laden macrophages (Figs. 2b and 3a) . Axonal spheroids were only found in areas of severe vacuolation, which also displayed some activated astro-cytes. Some vacuoles were swollen macrophages or axons which were detected by the immunoreaction to CD 68 resp. neurofilament protein ( Fig. 3b and 4) . The macrophages behaved the same way as activated tissue macrophages and showed a positive reaction with a-1-antitrypsin, a-1-antichymotrypsin and lysozyme, whereas they did not react with MAC 387. The applied antibodies against HIV-core (p 17 and p 24) and envelope-proteins (gp 41) reacted with cytoplasmic epitopes in mononuclear and multinucleated cells in the cerebrum in three of five cases with HIV-encephalopathy, whereas multinucleated HIVcells of the other two cases did not react with these antibodies. Only case 2 ( Table 2) showed few HIVpositive cells in vacuolated regions of the spinal cord. This \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 patient had a severe HIV -encephalopathy which extended into the caudal brain stem. The most reliable HIV-marker in our hands was anti-p 24, whereas anti-p 17 was positive in only one case, anti-gp 41 was negative in all cases.\n\nNeuropathology has helped to define a HIV -specific disease -HIV-encephalitis or HIV-encephalopathywhich is associated with a productive HIV-1 infection; some critical aspects of its pathogenesis, however, remain puzzling. In contrast the relation of HIV-associated tissue \n\nVM is a fairly uniform morphological syndrome of the spinal cord, which was first described by Goldstick et al. 1 2 in 1984 The neuropathological picture in our eight patients is in accordance with literature reports. The predilection for the thoracic cord described by Petito et al. 32, however, was not so striking. Gracile tract degeneration recently described by Rance et al. 3 3 in AIDS-patients, which appears to be a sequel of sensory neuropathy and is therefore different from VM, was not seen in our series.\n\nAccording to Artigas et al. 2 the vacuoles can be divided into different types. The intra myelinic type, caused by splitting of the myelin lamellae 32 , was the most frequent type in our series. Without electron microscopy this type was difficult to differentiate from the periaxonal type, which is caused by widening of the periaxonal space. Artigas et al. 2 reported this type as the most frequent one, whereas vacuolation of macrophages and axons contributed only to a minor degree to the vacuolar degeneration.\n\nClinically the patients affected by VM complain of gait disturbance, leg weakness, bladder and bowel incontinence. The syndrome develops usually during the final stage of HIV -infection after the immunological disorder is well established, although a myelopathy as the first clinical manifestation of the infection has been described by Honig et al. 19 . On physical examination, spastic paraparesis, ataxia and minor sensory impairment are detected. Some degree of spasticity, bladder and bowel disturbances are also features of the AIDS-Dementia-Complex (ADC) , which develops frequently in AIDS-patients 8 . Therefore spinal symptoms of AIDS-patients are often attributed to cerebral lesions or general debilitation, which is normally AIDS-Myelopathy\u00b7 63 present in these patients; this was the case in three of our patients. A close clinicopathological correlation in some of our patients was not possible because of incomplete tissue sampling. The clinical differential diagnosis of VM can be difficult and has to consider all causes of a paraparesisparaplegia syndrome. In AIDS-patients opportunistic infections of the spinal cord must be excluded: myelitis due to herpes simplex, herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, treponema pallidum and toxoplasma gondii have been described in AIDS-patients. Also lymphomatous tumors or vascular necrosis of the cord are common causes of spinal cord syndromes in AIDS-patients I4 . Myelopathic syndromes in AIDS-patients rarely result from myelomalacia due to disseminated intravascular coagulation 1o .\n\nEtiology Other studies, however, found a dissociation of AIDSrelated myelopathy and HIV-infection of the spinal cord 13 ,24,38. The results of our study would support the latter accounts since we detected HIV-immunoreactive cells in only one case. However, a limited expression of HIV -1 not detectable with the currently available methods could playa role in the development of VM. Also not in accordance with a possible role of HIV are the reports that VM can be found without HIV-infection of the brain and has been seldom described in children with AIDS. Moreover, VM was reported in 12 immunocompromised non -AIDS-patients 22 .\n\nThat macrophages might be important in the pathogenesis of VM is suggested by the frequency with which they are found in the vacuolated areas. These cells are the main target of HIV-infection in CNS39 and produce in vitro large amounts of cytokines like IL-1, IL-6 and TNFa in response to infection which in turn can increase HIVexpression. TNFa and IL-1 are able to induce myelin damage and could therefore playa role in the pathogenesis of ADC and VM26. Whether HIV-positive macrophages are really pathogenetically relevant to vacuolation or are only unspecifically attracted to a spinal cord lesion brought about by unrelated mechanisms, is an open question.\n\nAlthough the histological picture of VM differs somewhat from classical Wallerian degeneration, supraspinal pathology may not be insignificant for the development of this syndrome. An association between VM in the lateral columns and the severity of brain lesions especially in the capsula interna has been reported 13 ,34. In five of our patients VM was associated with HIV-encephalopathy and partly severe involvement of the capsula interna. This might indicate Wallerian degeneration as a cofactor in the pathogenesis, although other morphological findings argue against this. As in the study of Grafe et al. 13 , vacuolation of the posterior column was not related to pathology in the spinal roots or ganglia.\n\nAnother pathogenesis is suggested by the clinical and morphological resemblance of VM and subacute combined degeneration (SCD) due to Vito B12 -or perhaps folic acid deficiency. Both deficiencies cause vacuolation of myelin; the most severe lesions occur in the posterior columns of the lower cervical and upper thoracic cord 31 ,36. Vacuolation and demyelination of the cerebral white matter, rarely seen in SCD, are held responsible for the dementia which develops in some of the vitamin deficient patients. Although most AIDS-patients are in a malnourished and often cachectic state, Vito B12 and folic acid levels, however, were normal in most reported cases 32 . In our patients Vito B12levels were not investigated. SCD has also been reported in patients with normal serum B 12 levels in Lupus erythematodes, with a familial defect in cobalamin metabolism and after prolonged exposure to nitrous oxide (for review see Petito et a1. 32 ). These disorders were not found in our patients, nor have they been reported in conjunction with AIDS. None of our patients was exposed to toxic agents known to produce spinal cord lesions like hexachlorophene, intrathecal gentamycin, isoniacid or clioquinoP2. Metabolic disorders known to produce spinal cord pathology -hepatic disease with portocaval shunt, nicotinic acid deficiency and severe nutritional deficiencies -were also not present 15 ,31,43. Moreover these states cause Wallerian degeneration or a dying back process but no vacuolar myelopathy. However, toxic or metabolic cofactors are probably relevant to the pathogenesis of VM and VL and could also relate to the reported regional variation in incidence of VM6.\n\nFinally infection with other viruses can produce similar tissue damage; HTL V -1 for instance, sharing considerable biological similarity and some genetic homology with HIV-1, most probably produces a chronic myelitis with minimal involvement of midbrain, cerebellum and cerebrum and in the spinal cord sometimes vacuolation of long tracts 37 . The severity of the inflammatory infiltrate correlates roughly with the duration of the disease process 20 ,29. "}
