{"title": "Public health round-up", "body": "A yellow fever vaccination campaign targeting nearly one billion people living in 27 African countries was launched last month.\n\nThe Eliminate yellow fever epidemics (EYE) strategy for the 27 countries was launched by Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), and Professor Isaac Folorunso Adewole, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Health and partners at a meeting in Abuja, Nigeria. \n\nThe acute viral haemorrhagic disease has emerged as a serious global public health threat following outbreaks in 2016 in densely populated cities in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo, that resulted in 400 deaths. \n\nThe response to the two outbreaks exhausted global vaccine supplies and diverted public health resources from other health priorities. \n\nDuring the 10\u201312 April EYE strategy launch meeting in Africa, representatives from 14 African countries, WHO, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, Gavi the Vaccine Alliance and other partners, developed a roadmap on how to roll-out the strategy at national level. \n\nThese efforts follow the endorsement of the strategy by African health ministers at the 67th WHO regional committee meeting in September 2017.\n\nThe objectives of the strategy include protecting at-risk populations through preventive mass vaccination campaigns and routine immunization programmes, preventing international spread, and containing outbreaks rapidly. \n\nDeveloping strong surveillance, with robust laboratory networks, is key to these efforts.\n\nThe EYE strategy supports 40 countries (27 in Africa and 13 in the Americas) considered to be at high risk of yellow fever outbreaks and involves more than 50 partners. \n\nbit.ly/2JCXN9O\n\nGirls and women who have been subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) rarely receive high quality health-care that meets their specific needs. This month WHO launched a new clinical handbook to help health-care workers provide such care.\n\nThe handbook, entitled Care of girls and women living with female genital mutilation, provides advice on how to care for and communicate with girls and women who have developed health complications due to FGM, as well as with their husbands, partners and relatives. \n\nThe handbook is designed to support a wide range of health-care providers, including obstetricians, gynaecologists, surgeons, general practitioners, midwives, nurses and mental health professionals. \n\nIt provides guidance on how health-care workers can provide quality health care to girls and women who have health problems due to FGM, including immediate and short-term urogynaecological and obstetric complications. \n\nAdvice and clinical information for health workers is included, so that they can help affected girls and women make informed decisions about whether to undergo deinfibulation, a surgical procedure that can reverse a form of FGM known as infibulation.\n\nOne section of the handbook provides advice on how to support women who have mental health and sexual health complications caused by FGM. \n\nMore than 200 million girls and women have undergone FGM in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, and the practice occurs in other countries as well.\n\nbit.ly/2EAD7eU \n\nWHO released consolidated guidelines on testing and treatment for tuberculosis infection, especially among groups who are particularly at risk, such as children and people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). \n\nIn Latent tuberculosis infection: updated and consolidated guidelines for programmatic management, WHO recommends action in three areas: identifying population groups that are at risk for latent tuberculosis infection, as well as, expanding testing and treatment options for these latent infections. \n\nWHO has also developed a mobile application to support programmatic management of latent tuberculosis infection. \n\nYou can access the mobile application here: bit.ly/2ICjy8k.\n\nThe number of new tuberculosis patients decreased at an average rate of 4.3% every year between 2007 and 2016 in the 53-country WHO European Region, according to a report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe.\n\nDespite this rapid decline, countries in the WHO Region are not on track to achieve the targets to end the tuberculosis epidemic. \n\nThe Stop TB strategy sets the target of a 90% reduction in new cases by 2035. The target of sustainable development goal 3 is a reduction of 80% of cases by 2030, as compared with the baseline year of 2015. \n\nLow detection rates and inadequate treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR\u2013TB) are the main drivers of the tuberculosis epidemic in Europe, the report said. \n\nData from the 2016 tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring report indicate that one in four people with MDR\u2013TB in the WHO European Region does not receive a diagnosis. \n\nDiagnosis of MDR\u2013TB patients increased from 33% in 2011 to 73% in 2016, but it remains to be seen whether the regional target of 85% will be achieved, as defined in the Tuberculosis action plan for the WHO European Region 2016\u20132020.\n\nTreating patients with drug resistant forms of tuberculosis is another challenge: the observed increase in treatment success from 46% in 2013 to 55% in 2016 is still insufficient for countries in the European Region to reach the 75% target for 2020 they committed to in the action plan.\n\nThe spread of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is an additional threat to ending tuberculosis in the WHO European Region. With the rapid rollout of drug-susceptibility testing and improved surveillance, countries in the WHO European Region detected 5000 XDR\u2013TB cases in 2016. On average only one in three patients with XDR\u2013TB is cured. \n\nbit.ly/2EtZzGl\n\nWHO released new interim guidance on the laboratory testing for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). \n\nThe latest guidance, entitled Laboratory testing for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus interim guidance, incorporates recent findings on the human viral infection and the immune response it elicits.\n\nThe new interim guidance \u2013 valid until December 2019 \u2013 covers indicators for testing, specimen collection and shipment, and laboratory biosafety measures for detecting MERS-CoV by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. The guidance also provides details on available serological assays for MERS-CoV, and reporting of laboratory results. \n\nbit.ly/2qjkMi7\n\nAbout 400 delegates from countries, United Nations agencies, nongovernmental organizations, academia, philanthropy and business gathered last month in Copenhagen to explore new ways to fund the response to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nParticipants at the WHO Global Dialogue looked at examples of best practices for the alignment of public and private efforts to fund NCDs prevention and response, without incurring conflicts of interest.\n\nAs part of a youth initiative, 20 young people from 16 countries worked together to generate innovative ideas and solutions to help close the financing gap for NCDs.\n\nThe 9\u201311 April meeting was part of an informal process leading up to the United Nations General Assembly Third High-Level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases in September 2018.\n\nNCDs are responsible for 40 million deaths globally every year. Tackling NCDs is a global priority, but there is insufficient investment to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal target 3.4 of reducing premature deaths from NCDs by one third by 2030. \n\nbit.ly/2v6syAX\n\nWHO called on the conflict parties in the Syrian Arab Republic to allow people to access health care, following reports of the suspected use of toxic chemicals in Douma city, East Ghouta.\n\nIn a statement issued last month, WHO expressed deep concern about reports of the use of chemical weapons. \n\nWHO and its partners in the health cluster are providing trauma care, medicines, supplies and personal protective equipment. The health cluster is the group of international medical and aid agencies that provide health care in emergencies. \n\nAccording to reports from WHO\u2019s health cluster partners, during the shelling of Douma on 7 April, an estimated 500 patients presented to health facilities exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals. \n\n\u201cWHO reminds parties to the conflict of their obligation to refrain from attacking medical facilities and personnel as per Security Council Resolution 2286 (2016),\u201d the statement said. \n\nbit.ly/2qmKu5g"}
