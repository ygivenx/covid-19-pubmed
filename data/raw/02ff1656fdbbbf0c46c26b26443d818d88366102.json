{"title": "UPLC-MS identification and anticomplement activity of the metabolites of Sophora tonkinensis flavonoids treated with human intestinal bacteria", "body": "The roots and rhizomes of Sophora tonkinensis, known as \"Shandougen\" in traditional Chinese medicine, have been recorded in Chinese Pharmacopoeia and widely used for the treatment of laryngopharyngeal inflammation and throat pain through oral administration [1, 2] . Flavonoids and alkaloids are the two kinds of major components of S. tonkinensis. Pharmacological studies reported that the flavonoids in S. tonkinensis possessed significant bioactivities, such as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-gastric ulcer, and inhibiting gastric acid secretion effects [3] [4] [5] [6] . The alkaloids of S. tonkinensis exhibited antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV), influenza virus A/Hanfang/359/95 (H 3 N 2 ) and coxsackie virus B 3 (CVB 3 ) [7, 8] .\n\nMost traditional Chinese medicines are given orally and the chemical compounds inevitably contact intestinal flora within the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, those components were metabolized by intestinal bacteria before absorbed from the digestive tract [9, 10] . Research on herbal components of metabolism with intestinal flora is greatly significant to understand their potential biological characteristics [11] .\n\nThe system of complement plays a dominant role in regulating host defense. However, the pathogenesis of some diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), may cause the complement system excessive activation and lead to systemic inflammation response [12, 13] . It's notable that, traditional Chinese medicine commonly had beneficial effects on infectious diseases by inhibiting inflammation and reducing fever, and the mechanism is probably related to inhibiting excessive activation of the complement system in vivo [14, 15] . Hence, the discovery and application of complement inhibitors should become a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of these infectious diseases.\n\nInterestingly, our previous study found that the total flavonoids of S. tonkinensis (TFST) were absence of complement inhibitory activity but showed obvious anticomplement activity after incubated with human intestinal bacteria. However, intestinal bacteria https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2020.113176 0731-7085/\u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. had no distinct influence on the weak anticomplement activity of the total alkaloids of S. tonkinensis. We speculated that TFST might be the key effective components that exhibit anticomplement activity in vivo after metabolized with intestinal bacteria.\n\nTo find out how the structures and activities of TFST were changed by human intestinal bacteria, TFST was extracted and incubated with human fecal microflora in this study. Components of TFST and their metabolites were recognized and compared via UPLC-ESI-LTQ/MS, as well as their anticomplement activities in vitro.\n\nThe dried roots of S. tonkinensis were purchased from Leiyunshang drug store (Shanghai), and authenticated by Prof. DaoFeng Chen at Fudan University. The voucher specimen (SDG-JX07) has been deposited at School of Pharmacy, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\n\nSheep blood cells were prepared in Alsevers' solution. Antisheep erythrocyte antibody was provided by Prof. Yunyi Zhang. Guinea pig serum was prepared by healthy guinea pigs and rabbit blood cells were prepared from the ear vein of New Zealand white rabbits (both purchased from Laboratory Animals Research Institute of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.). Normal human serum (NHS) was prepared from healthy male donors (at the age of 20-30 years old). Buffers: VBS 2+ , isotonic veronal buffered saline, containing 0.15 mmol/L Ca 2+ and 0.5 mmol/L Mg 2+ . EGTA-VBS 2+ , veronal buffer saline, containing 5 mmol/L Mg 2+ and 8 mmol/L ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid.\n\nReference substances (purity>98 %): ononin, formononetin, trifolirhizin, maackiain, rutin, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, quercetin, daidzein, genistein and sophorabioside were purchased from Meilun Biological Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). UPLC grade acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Ultrapure water was purified by the Milli-Q water purification system from Millipore (Boston, MA, USA). General anaerobic medium broth (GAM broth) was purchased from Meilun Biological Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). All other reagents and chemical compounds were of analytical grade.\n\nAnalyses of TFST and its metabolites were performed using a UPLC system (Dionex ultimate 3000) with a conditioned autosampler at 4 \u2022 C. The qualitative analysis and separation were performed on a C 18 column (4.6 \u00d7 250 mm, i.d., 5 m Thermo, Finnigan, San Jose, CA, USA). The temperature of the column was set at 25 \u2022 C using an UPLC system (Thermo, Finnigan, San Jose, CA, USA) The mobile phase consisted of 0.1 % formic acid add in ultra-pure water (A, v/v) and acetonitrile (B) using a gradient elution of 6-20 % B at 0\u221220 min, 20-90 % B at 20\u221280 min, and the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. The UV absorption was set at 310 nm and the injection volume was 5 L. The mass spectra were set in the range of m/z 110-1500. The electrospray ionization (ESI) source was acquired in negative ion mode with the ion spray voltage at 3.5 Kv; the temperature of the capillary was maintained at 350 \u2022 C. Nitrogen was used as sheath gas and auxiliary gas with a flow rate of 30 arbitrary units and 10 arbitrary units, respectively. The helium was used as the damping gas and collision gas [2] .\n\nDried roots of S. tonkinensis (50 g) were extracted three times using 80 % ethanol for 2 h by heating reflux method, after fil-trated, the filtrate was collected and evaporated in vacuum. The 80 % ethanol extract was mixed in water and purified with an AB-8 macroporous resin column, eluted successively with distilled water 3 times column volume and then use 80 % ethanol to wash 6-8 times column volume [16] . 80 % ethanol elution was collected and evaporated in vacuum to yield TFST (4.18 g).\n\nFresh fecal samples were obtained from 8 healthy human volunteers (four males, four females, 20-40 years of age, had neither gastrointestinal disease history nor use of antibiotics for at least six months before the experiment), and homogenized with 20 times volume of general anaerobic medium broth immediately [17] . After removing residue using gauze filter, the intestinal bacterial suspension was cultured in an anaerobic system (nitrogen 85 %, carbon dioxide 10 %, hydrogen 5%) at 37 \u2022 C. 20 mg TFST was added to 20 mL human intestinal bacterial suspension and the mixture was anaerobically incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 24 h. The incubated solution was respectively taken out and extracted with water saturated nbutanol three times. The extract was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C. The supernatant was evaporated in vacuum to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 1 mL MeOH and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 8 min at 4 \u2022 C. The supernatant was then analyzed by UPLC-ESI-LTQ/MS. The chemical constituent change in TFST was also analyzed at incubation time points of 0, 12 and 24 h.\n\nUsing the same method as above, 5 mg of each reference substance (sophorabioside, ononin, trifolirhizin, rutin, quercitrin and isoquercitrin) was added in 10 mL human intestinal bacterial suspension and incubated anaerobically for 24 h at 37 \u2022 C. After extracted by n-butanol and purified through centrifugation, the final methanol solution was also analyzed using UPLC-ESI-LTQ/MS.\n\nThe anticomplement activities through the classical pathway of sophorabioside, rutin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, ononin, trifolirhizin, daidzein, genistein, quercetin, formononetin, maackiain and heparin sodium (positive control) were evaluated according to Mayer's modified method [18] . Their anticomplement activities through the alternative pathway were measured according to Klerx's method [19] .\n\nTo evaluate the effect of sophorabioside, rutin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, ononin, trifolirhizin, daidzein, genistein, quercetin, formononetin, maackiain on NO secretion, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used as initiators in RAW264.7 cells. The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was maintained in DMEM (Gibco, NY, USA) containing 10 % (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and cultured in 96-well plates (1 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well), at 37 \u2022 C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 . LPS (10 ng/ml) and test samples were added to the corresponding wells and incubated for 24 h. The NO content in the culture media was measured according to the colorimetric method, using Griess reagent [16] . in the metabolites (Fig. 1B) was observed compared with TFST ( Fig. 1A) , but the peak height and peak area changed significantly.\n\nThe chromatographic peaks 2-7, 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 and 7 of TFST, were identified by comparing the retention times, molecular ion peaks and UV spectra with reference substances by UPLC-ESI-LTQ/MS in negative ionization mode. The data were summarized in Table 1 The fragmentation pathways were similar to those of compound 2, except for 16 Da (-OH) less than every fragment ion of compound 2. Besides, considering the molecular weight of compound 1 was just 308 DA (-glc-rha) more than that of 1 , we speculated that compound 1 and 2 have the same metabolic pathways. Thus, compound 1 was identified as daidzein-4 -glucoside-rhamnoside.\n\nCompounds 8-13 showed typical fragmentation patterns of isoprenylated flavonoids, which could be distinguished by the characteristic 1,3 Aion and 1,3 B ions according to the Retro Diels Alder (RDA) Cleavage (Fig. S1 ) and the characteristic fragments originated from the degradation of different isopentene groups in the MS/MS spectra (Fig. S2) . The results were summarized in Table 2 . Table 1 Retention time (RT), molecular ion peaks and peak area ratios of 7 flavonoid glycosides and 5 aglycones in TFST and its metabolites.\n\nCompound In total, eighteen compounds of TFST and its metabolites were identified (Fig. S3) , including seven flavonoid glycosides: daidzein-4 -glucoside-rhamnoside (1), sophorabioside (2), rutin (3), isoquercitrin (4), quercitrin (5), ononin (6) and trifolirhizin (7); five flavonoid aglycones: daidzein (1 ), genistein (2 ), quercetin (3 ), formononetin (4 ), maackiain (5 ) and six isoprenylated flavonoids: kurarinone (8), sophoradin (9), sophoradochromene (10), 2-(3-Hydroxy-2, 2-dimethyl-8-isopentenyl-6-chromanyl)-7hydroxy-8-isopentenyl-4-chromanone (11), sophoranone (12) and sophoranochromene (13) . The area ratio of these peaks in TFST and its metabolites (Table 1) indicated that the flavonoid glycosides were decreased, the flavonoid aglycones were increased by human intestinal bacteria, while the isoprenylated flavonoids were not changed (Fig. 1, Table 2 ).\n\nContent changes of the seven flavonoid glycosides and five flavonoid aglycones in TFST and its metabolites were determined semi quantitatively by peak area of each incubation time point (0, 12 and 24 h) to 0 h (100 %) (Table S1 ). Regression equations, correlation coefficients, precision and LOD of reference standards were also evaluated (Table S2 ). All the contents of daidzein-4 -glucosiderhamnoside (1), sophorabioside (2), rutin (3), isoquercitrin (4), quercitrin (5), ononin (6), trifolirhizin (7) declined as time went on, which were exactly opposite to the content changes of daidzein (1 ), genistein (2 ), quercetin (3 ), formononetin (6 ), maackiain (7 ) (Fig. 2) . Based on the content changes as well as the chemical structures of the twelve constituents of TFST, we inferred that seven flavone glycosides were converted to their aglycones accordingly by human intestinal bacteria.\n\nThe UPLC chromatograms of reference standards showed the metabolic results in Fig. S4 , which confirmed the transformation of the glycosides to their respective aglycones by intestinal bacteria. Based on the above results, the metabolic pathways of flavonoids with human intestinal bacteria were shown in Fig. 3 . It was noteworthy that rutin, isoquercitrin, and quercitrin were all metabolized to quercetin. And since there was no commercially available reference standard of daidzein-4 -glucoside-rhamnoside (1), it was hard to verify metabolite directly through the conversion reference product with human intestinal flora. According to chemical structure, fragmentation patterns and the metabolic result of sophorabioside, we speculated that daidzein-4 -glucosiderhamnoside was metabolized to daidzein by human intestinal bacteria. The results suggested that O-glycoside flavonoids of TFST were easily converted into their corresponding aglycones with intestinal flora.\n\nIn the transformation of S. tonkinensis flavonoids, there were seven components have changed. Among these components, rutin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, ononin, trifolirhizin were metabolized into quercetin, formononetin and maackiain, with the anticomplement activities were remarkable improved. Particularly, formononetin (CH 50 : 0.082 \u00b1 0.029 mg/mL, AP 50 : 0.217 \u00b1 0.068 mg/mL), the metabolite of ononin (CH 50 : 3.275 \u00b1 1.352 mg/mL, AP 50 : NE) showed significant activity comparable to the positive inhibitor. However, neither glycosides nor aglycones of the other isoflavones (sophorabioside, daidzein and Date are presented as mean \u00b1 SD, n = 3. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001, compared with the initial peak area of the compound.\n\nAnticomplement activities of 6 flavonoids and their metabolites. (means \u00b1 S.D., n = 3. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001, compared with corresponding flavonoid glycosides. genistein) showed anticomplement activity (Table 3) . Although rutin, isoquercitrin and quercitrin demonstrated anticomplement activities through the classical pathway or alternative pathway, their common metabolite quercetin (CH 50 : 0.178 \u00b1 0.102 mg/mL, AP 50 : 0.205 \u00b1 0.139 mg/mL) was quite more potent. Besides, the isoprenylated flavonoids were all inactive.\n\nIn vitro anti-inflammatory assays (Fig. S5) showed that compared with cell + LPS group, rutin, quercitrin, quercetin and formononetin treated cells exhibited significant decreased NO production (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the results were consistent with their anticomplement activities. Quercetin and formononetin showed better activities than their glycosides (rutin, isoquercitrin and ononin). Meanwhile, there was no statistical difference between quercitrin and quercetin. However, both maackiain and trifolirhizin, with very weak anticomplement activity, had no antiinflammatory activity.\n\nThe above results revealed that the metabolic activation of TFST by human intestinal flora was attributed to the content increasing of the more potent flavonol (quercetin) and isoflavone (formononetin) aglycones. This kind of transformation had also occurred in the intestinal bacteria metabolism of the inactive flavone glycosides of Scutellaria baicalensis roots to their anticomplement aglycones both in vitro and in vivo [27] . These aglycones, like quercetin and formononetin, might be the potential effective substances of S. tonkinensis to perform the inhibiting inflammation action in vivo.\n\nOur previous study showed that bacteroidetes, proteobacteria and firmicutes accounted for more than 90 % of human intestinal bacteria [27] . Ononin and quercitrin were further metabolized by specific human intestinal bacteria from these three groups, including Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus faecalis. The results showed that ononin could be transformed by all the four bacteria into formononetin (Fig. S6) . However, only Bacteroides could convert quercitrin to quercetin (Fig. S7) . The reason might be the different glycosidic bonds of the two compounds. The \u2424-glucoside in ononin is more common in nature than the \u2423-rhamnoside in quercitrin and thus could be metabolized more easily by most intestinal bacteria. On the other hand, the four bacteria had quite differnt efficinecies on metabolizing ononin, in which Enterococcus faecalis transformed almost all the compound into its aglycone. Besides, the roots of sophora flavescens Ait, another commonly used medicinal plant from Sophora, are found to contain similar chemical constituents as S. tonkinensis, including isoprenylated flavonoids and quinolizidine alkaloids. However, their clinical applications are completely different [28, 29] . S. tonkinensis is frequently used internally to treat acute throat infections while S. flavescens is mostly used externally for the treatment of skin diseases, such as eczema and dermatitis [30] . And their different flavonoid constituents could serve as the qualitative markers for identification of S. tonkinensis and S. flavescens. S. flavescens roots barely contain flavonoid glycosides but mainly contain isoprenylated flavonoids (Fig. S8) , which are inactive on the complement system and unable to be metabolized by intestinal bacteria. As expected, almost no change was detected when the flavonoids of S. flavescens were incubated with human intestinal bacteria, except trifolirhizin (1) metabolized to maackiain (1 ) (Fig. S9, Table S3 ). These results further explain the different effects and administration routes of S. flavescens and S. tonkinensis.\n\nOur current study showed that the presence of intestinal flora played a key role in metabolic activation of TFST after oral administration. The contents of flavonoid aglycones with potent anticomplement activity were enhanced significantly under the hydrolytic action of intestinal flora on the flavonoid glycosides. Among the eighteen flavonoids identified using UPLC-ESI-LTQ/MS method, isoflavone and flavonol aglycones (formononetin and quercetin) and three flavonol glycosides (rutin, isoquercitrin and quercitrin) were the major anticomplement constituents of TFST and should be taken as the quality markers of S. tonkinensis roots. The in vivo anti-inflammatory and anticomplement effects of formononetin, the most potent constitent and metabolite of TFST, will be investigated in the near future. \n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."}
