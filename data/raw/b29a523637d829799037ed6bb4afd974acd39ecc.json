Tissues and Cell s The conjunctiva and lacrimal gland are the primary ocular tissues that are considered part of the mucosal immune system . The conjunctiva is a mucous membran e consisting of an outer squamous epithelial cell laye r MUCOSAL VACCINE S Copyright 0 1996 by Academic Press, Inc .\n\nAll rights of reproduction in anv form reser v ed .\n\n(two to five cells thick) interspersed with goblet cells, a basement membrane, and the underlying connective tissue of the substantia propria (stroma) . Figure 1 diagrams the major features of the human conjunctiva . Bulbar conjunctiva overlies the sclera between the corneal limbus and the conjunctival fornix . Multipl e sebaceous glands within the deeper stroma contribute t o the corneal tear film and the lubrication of the conjunctiva (Fine and Yanoff, 1979) . Mast cells have bee n identified in the conjunctiva of humans, other primates , and several rodents (Allansmith et Fine an d Yanoff, 1979) . These are particularly prominent in trauma-induced and allergic conjunctivitis . There are no microfold (M) cells in the conjunctiva and the normal conjunctiva is relatively free of lymphocytes . However , similar to gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissu e (GALT), intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) have bee n identified in human and mouse conjunctiva (Dua et at . , 1994 ; J . A . Whittum-Hudson, unpublished observations) . Human conjunctival IEL are T cells and expres s the mucosal lymphocyte antigen HML-1 and CD8 (Du a et at ., 1994) . Another study found that the majority o f conjunctival T cells expressed o LP TCR (Soukiasian e t at ., 1992) . The murine equivalent IEL is CD3 + , CD8 + and TCR ,y8+ (J . A . Whittum-Hudson, unpublished observations) . Few T cells and essentially no B cells are found in the substantia propria of normal human, monkey, or mouse conjunctiva (Reacher et al ., 1991 ; Soukiasian et al ., 1992 ; Dua et at ., 1994 ; Whittum-Hudson et at ., 1995a) . The majority of the substantia propria T lymphocytes are CD8 + cells in man and monkey and li e subepithelially . In the lower fornix of human conjunctiva, clusters of unorganized (nonfollicular) lym - Sacks et al ., 1986 . ) phocytes may be found (Fine and Yanoff, 1979) . Some species such as rabbit and guinea pigs may exhibit tru e follicles in the lower fornices (Shimada and Silverstein , 1975 ; Chandler and Gillette, 1983 ; . These may develop due to persistent exposure to exogenous antigens, or reflect a nonspecific response to th e environment .\n\nLacrimal glands also play a major role in ocula r mucosal defense . In humans, lacrimal glands are foun d in the anterior, superolateral area of the orbit . Smaller accessory lacrimal glands (see Fig. 1 ) also may be foun d in the upper and lower conjunctiva . Ducts from the major lacrimal gland drain into the superotemporal conjunctival cul-de-sac, while ducts from accessory gland s drain directly through the epithelium of the conjunctiv a adjacent to their location . Lacrimal glands of other species are found in different areas both within and outsid e the orbit . Histological examination shows that th e glands are made up of acinar units which are interconnected by ductules and that these interconnected acina r units form the lobes of the gland . Each acinar unit consists of secretory acinar epithelial cells, which are surrounded by a basement membrane, and the glandula r ducts are lined with pseudostratified epithelium . Lymphatic channels also are present in the gland, an d these drain into the cervical and preauricular lymp h nodes . In addition to epithelial cells, a variety of othe r cell types such as plasma cells, B and T lymphocytes , macrophages, and dendritic cells have been identified i n the interstitial connective tissue between the acina r units and ducts . In human, rabbit, rat, and mouse lacrimal glands, IgA plasma cells predominate, although IgG and IgM plasma cells are present and, in human, Ig D and IgE plasma cells have been found (Franklin et al . , 1973 ; Shimada and Silverstein, 1975 ; Allansmith et al ., 1976 ; Brandtzaeg et al., 1979 ; Crago et al ., 1984 ; Damato et al., 1984 ; McGee and Franklin, 1984 ; Gudmundsson et al ., 1984 ; Brandtzaeg, 1985 ; Kett et al ., 1986 ; Wieczorek et al. , 1988 ; Ebersole et al ., 1988 ; Pappo et al ., 1988b ; Han n et al., 1988 ; Montgomery et al., 1989) . B cells bearin g various surface immunoglobulin isotypes also have bee n found in smaller numbers in humans and rodent s (McGee and Franklin, 1984 ; Pappo et al ., 1988b ; Wieczorek et al ., 1988 ; Montgomery et al ., 1989 Montgomery et al ., , 1990 Pepose et al ., 1990) . Both CD4 + and CD8 T cells als o have been identified in human and rat (Ebersole et al . , 1988 ; Gudmundsson et al., 1988 ; Wieczorek et al. , 1988 ; Pappo et al ., 1988b ; Pepose et al., 1990 ; Montgomery et al ., 1989 Montgomery et al ., , 1990 . Of the CD3 T cells isolated from rat lacrimal gland, 89% bear the aR and 7% expres s .y8 TCR (C . A . Skandera and P. C . Montgomery, unpublished observations) . Macrophages have been demonstrated in both human and rat (Wieczorek et al . , 1988 ; Pappo et al ., 1988a ; Montgomery et al., 1989 ; Pepose et al., 1990) and Langerhans-type dendritic cell s identified in human lacrimal gland (Wieczorek et al . , 1988 ; Pepose et al ., 1990) . These various cell types contribute a number of biologically active molecules whic h are important for defense at the ocular surface . Th e acinar epithelial cells produce lysozyme and lactoferri n which are naturally occurring tear components wit h bactericidal properties (Franklin et al ., 1973 ; Gillett e and Allansmith, 1980 ; Gillette et al ., 1981 ; McGill et al ., 1984) . In addition, the plasma cells are the mai n source of tear S-IgA antibodies (Sullivan and Allansmith, 1984 ; Peppard and Montgomery, 1987 ; Franklin, 1989 ; which are produced i n response to antigenic challenge and are major effecto r molecules in mucosal defense Childers et al ., 1989 ; McGhee and Mestecky, 1990) .\n\nAlthough it has been postulated that the conjunctiv a functions both as a mucosal inductive and effector sit e (Chandler and Gillette, 1983 ; Franklin and Remus , 1984 ; Franklin, 1989 ), the precise relationship of th e conjunctiva to the mucosal immune network require s further clarification . With respect t o inductive capabilities, the presence of lymphoid follicle s containing T and B cells in rabbit (Shimada and Silverstein, 1975 ; Franklin et al ., 1979 ; Franklin and Remus , 1984) and, in humans, the presence of Langerhan s cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (Sacks et al. , 1986) , as well as lymphatic channels (Srinivasan et al . , 1990) , support the potential to process and perhaps respond to antigen . Normal conjunctival epithelial cells d o not express MHC class II ; however, the presence of class II + Langerhans cells in the epithelium and dendri-tic cells in the stroma suggests that antigen presentatio n may occur in conjunctiva . Further support for the inductive function comes from studies showing that topical application of antigen to the conjunctiva is an effective means of eliciting tear IgA antibody response s (Montgomery et al ., 1984a,b ; Peppard et al ., 1988) . Recent investigations have suggested that nasal-associate d lymphoid tissue (NALT) may also function as an inductive site following ocular topical antigen applicatio n (Carr et al ., submitted ; see Section III .A) . With the exception of rabbit conjunctiva, which contains substantial numbers of IgA plasma cells and epithelial cells tha t synthesize secretory component (Franklin et al ., 1973 (Franklin et al ., , 1979 Liu et at., 1981) , the conjunctiva of most specie s does not display the typical features of a mucosal effector site . However, it should be noted that studies in a t least two species, rat and monkey, have documente d lymphocyte traffic from gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) to conjunctiva (Zhang et al ., 1983 ; Taylor et al., 1985) . These data indicate that the functional role of the conjunctiva in the mucosal networ k may vary significantly between species .\n\nAn abundance of evidence now indicates that th e lacrimal gland is a functional part of the mucosal im -mune network. As has been demonstrated for other mucosal effector tissues and described above (see Sectio n II .A), the lacrimal glands of many species contain a predominance of IgA + plasma cells . In addition, lacrimal acinar epithelial cells produce secretory component (Franklin et al .,1973 ; Sullivan et al., 1984b Sullivan et al., , 1990 Gudmundsson et al ., 1985 ; Hann et al ., 1991) , which functions as part of the polymeric immunoglobulin recepto r to mediate transport of IgA into external secretions (Solari and Kraehenbuhl, 1985) . Figure 2 diagrams the biosynthetic events within lacrimal gland that lead to th e production and transport of IgA into tears . Linkage o f the lacrimal gland to the mucosal network occurs vi a trafficking lymphocyte populations . While both B and T lymphocytes traffic to mucosal tissues including lacrimal gland, B cells have been studied more extensivel y than T cells . IgA bearing lymphocytes from GALT (e .g. , mesenteric lymph nodes) and glandular mucosal tissue s have been shown to seed lacrimal glands (Montgomery et al ., 1983 (Montgomery et al ., , 1985 in a manner similar to other effecto r sites in the mucosal immune system (Roux et al ., 1977 ; McDermott and Bienenstock, 1979 ; Weisz-Carringto n et al ., 1979) . Tear IgA antibodies with specificity for ora l microbes (Burns et at ., 1982 ;  Gregory and Allansmith , Franklin and Montgomery (1996 ) and published courtesy of Mosby.) 1986, 1987) as well as demonstrations that gastrointestinal immunization induced tear IgA antibodie s (Mestecky et al ., 1978 ; Montgomery et at., 1983 ; Gregory and Filler, 1987 ; Waldman and Bergmann, 1987 ) have provided further support for this linkage . Figure 3 shows the interrelationship of various compartments o f the mucosal network and summarizes events leading t o mucosal IgA induction following GALT immunization .\n\nThe mechanism accounting for the preferential localization or retention of specific lymphoid population s in ocular mucosal tissues is an issue of central importance in understanding the regulation of ocular mucosa l immunity . Lymphocyte-high endothelial venule (HEV ) interactions control lymphocyte trafficking into organized lymphoid tissue and lymph nodes (Butcher, 1986 ; Woodruff et al ., 1987 , Stoolman, 1989 Chin et at. , 1991b, Picker and Butcher, 1992 ; Shimizu et at ., 1992 ; Bevilacqua, 1993) as well as into organized mucosa l lymphoid tissues (Jalkanen et at ., 1989 ; Chin et at. , 1991a) . In general, these interactions involve lymphocyte homing receptors which interact with vascular addressins on HEVs and other specialized endothelial cells . Although little is known regarding the mechanisms involved in cell trafficking to conjunctival tissue , the parameters regulating lymphocyte localization within the lacrimal gland are beginning to be defined . Wit h respect to glandular structures, the control of lymphocyte traffic could occur on two levels : (1) at exit from the Montgomery et al . (1994) and published courtesy o f Plenum .) vasculature, or (2) within the stroma of the glandula r tissue . There are no HEVs in lacrimal gland and n o selective interactions with glandular endothelium hav e yet been demonstrated . Therefore, it appears that lymphocyte entry into lacrimal gland is random (McGe e and Franklin, 1984) . Current evidence suggests that lymphocyte populations are selectively retained based on interactions that occur within the lacrimal tissue microenvironment . Early studies indicated that B-cell retention, particularly those committed to IgA production , resulted from a direct interaction with T cells located i n lacrimal tissue (Franklin and Shepard, 1990) . Recently , an in vitro binding assay has been used to show tha t circulating lymphocyte populations preferentially adhere to lacrimal gland acinar epithelium (O ' Sullivan an d . Both B and T lymphocytes participate in this interaction with B cells binding in greate r numbers (O ' Sullivan et at., 1994a) . Studies with biochemical inhibitors and antibodies directed against various adhesion molecules initially suggested the involvement of L-selectin (O ' Sullivan et at ., 1994a,b) . Other data indicated that pretreatment of lymphocytes wit h certain cytokines (IL-4 and TGFP) reduced the capacity of those cells to interact with lacrimal gland but no t lymph node or Peyer ' s patches (Elfaki et at ., 1994) . These latter data provided the initial support for th e involvement of a receptor distinct from those mediatin g interactions with lymph node and Peyer ' s patch HEVs . The characterization of the lymphocyte receptor is stil l ongoing, but an 85-kDa factor has been identified whic h specifically inhibits lymphocyte interactions with lacrimal and salivary gland tissues (Montgomery and Liberati, 1995) . Current studies are focused on defining th e relationship of this molecule to other lymphocyte surface determinants and adhesion molecules, as well as o n the identification of the acinar epithelial cell ligand o r counter receptor . With respect to the ligand, recen t studies using cultured rat lacrimal gland acinar cell s suggest that this molecule is shed into the culture medium (O ' Sullivan et at ., 1995) and has led to the speculation that trafficking lymphocytes may also interact wit h secreted ligand accessing the interstitial glandular spaces . Although the ligand or counter receptor has no t yet been isolated, it appears to be a 20-or 21-kDa glycoprotein (R . Raja and P . C . Montgomery, unpublishe d observations) .\n\nRegulatory events leading to the induction and expression of ocular mucosal immune responses are not completely defined . However, it is clear that many factors governing immune responses at other mucosal site s (Kiyono et at ., 1992 ; Walker, 1994) have general appli-cability to mucosal immune responses at the ocular surface . The immunization route is of primary importanc e with local (e .g ., topical application to the eye) and remote site (e .g ., oral or gastrointestinal) routes generating tear IgA antibody responses . Combinations of route s and their sequence of administration can also affect antibody induction in tears . Not surprisingly for replicating microbes, tissue tropism and invasive properties influence the outcome of mucosal responses . When dealin g with nonreplicating immunogens, particulate antigen s are more effective at inducing ocular mucosal immun e responses than soluble antigens . Thus far, traditional mucosal adjuvants such as cholera toxin, delivered topically to the eye with antigen, do not appear to enhanc e ocular antibody responses . Helper T (Th) cells and T-cell products such a s cytokines appear to play key roles in regulating ocula r mucosal IgA responses, but the direct role of cytotoxic T (Tc) cells in ocular mucosal immunity is currently no t clear .\n\nAs noted above (see Section II .B), lymphocyte traffic from mucosal inductive to effector sites is a centra l feature of the ocular mucosal system . Antigen-presenting cells (e .g ., macrophages and dendritic cells) are als o required, but their participation in ocular mucosal responses has yet to be delineated . The neuroendocrin e system also plays a role in regulating ocular mucosa l responses affecting both secretory component synthesi s in vivo (Sullivan et al ., 1984a) and cultured lacrima l gland acinar cells as well as tear IgA production Sullivan, 1988 ) . Neuroendocrine regulation is reviewed i n detail elsewhere (Stanisz et al., 1989 ; Sullivan, 1990 . Although these as well as other factors yet to b e identified impact ocular mucosal immune responses , our focus will be on selected parameters relevant to th e development of ocular vaccination strategies . Therefore , the effects of immunization route, immune potentiator s and delivery vehicles on the induction of ocular mucosa l responses, in particular IgA antibody production, will b e examined in detail .\n\nIn humans, most investigations have focused on use o f the oral or gastrointestinal (GI) immunization route . Ingestion of heat-killed Streptococcus mutans elicited IgA antibodies in tears and saliva, but not serum antibodie s (Mestecky et al ., 1978) . In addition, a second oral immunization markedly increased tear and salivary IgA responses . Other studies using inactivated S . mutans have generally confirmed these initial observations (Gregory et al ., 1984 ; Gregory and Filler, 1987 ; Czerkinsky et al . , 1987) . Human tear IgA antibody responses have als o been noted following oral immunization with influenz a vaccine (Bergmann et al ., 1986 Waldman and Bergmann, 1987) as well as following intranasal immunization with live rhinovirus (Douglas et al., 1967 ; Knopf et al., 1970) .\n\nThe rat model has been employed to directly compare the effectiveness of antigen application to the conjunctiva (ocular topical, ot) and administration by the oral or gastrointestinal (GI) route using the nonreplicating particulate antigen, dinitrophenylated type III pneumococcus (DNP-Pn) . These studies have shown : (1 ) both the immunization route and the sequence of stimulation play a role in tear antibody expression (Montgomery et al ., 1984b) ; (2) long-term repeated ot stimulatio n leads to an eventual downregulation of tear IgA antibod y levels (Montgomery et al ., 1984a,b) ; (3) the ot rout e generally yields higher tear IgA antibody levels than G I immunization (Peppard et al., 1988) ; and (4) coadministration of antigen and cytokines by the ot route enhances tear IgA antibody levels (Pockley and Montgomery, 1991 ; see Section III .B) . The rat model also ha s been used to study the effect of immunization route o n the kinetics of serum and tear antibody responses to liv e Chlamydia trachomatis (Davidson et al ., 1993) . Thi s study compared the effectiveness of ot, GI, subconjunctival, and intraperitoneal immunization and showe d that ot application was the most effective route for eliciting IgA antibody response in tears . Interestingly, subconjunctival injection of chlamydia yielded a vigorou s serum IgG response and minimal tear IgA antibodies , which is consistent with responses to other antigen s delivered by this route (Cousins et al ., 1991) . The explanation for this latter finding is not clear, but subconjunctival delivery may bypass an essential ocular mucosal processing step during antigen uptake or allow liv e organisms to gain access to the circulation .\n\nAlthough the precise mechanism by which ot immunization elicits tear IgA antibody responses is no t known, it appears that the inductive process could involve at least two pathways : (1) antigen uptake, processing, and triggering of B cells in the conjunctival substantia propria or (2) antigen drainage via the nasolacrima l canal, uptake by NALT M cells, processing and triggering of resident B cells in NALT (Carr et al ., submitted) . The schematic details of these two pathways are show n in Fig . 4 . Not shown in this figure is the option fo r antigen drainage via the nasolacrimal canal to acces s GALT or other alternatives which may be applicable t o primates . In humans and monkeys, antigen may reac h the accessory lacrimal glands directly or gain access t o potential ductal associated lymphoid tissue as has bee n shown for minor salivary glands (Nair and Schroeder , 1986) . However, since it is not clear how antigen woul d be processed within the acinar units of the accessor y lacrimal glands and ductal-associated lymphoid tissu e has not been identified for these glandular structures , these latter alternatives appear unlikely .\n\nSeveral animal models have also been used to eval- uate tear antibody responses after immunization or infection at ocular surfaces with chlamydia and othe r pathogens . In guinea pigs, only ocular immunization with live Chlamydia psittaci (GPIC) induced tear Ig A (and in some cases IgG) antibodies (Murray et al ., 1973 ; Watson et al ., 1977 ; Rank and Whittum-Hudson , 1994) . Killed organisms administered via ocular topical (Murray et al ., 1973) or intraperitoneal routes (Malaty et al ., 1981) failed to induce tear antibodies . However , similar studies with human biovars of C . trachomatis i n owl monkeys suggested that inactivated chlamydia coul d indeed induce tear antibodies (MacDonald et al ., 1984) .\n\nIn the cynomolgus monkey model, ocular infection with the chlamydial organism induced vigorous IgA, IgG, an d IgM responses in both serum and tears (reviewed b y Taylor, 1990) . Only oral immunization with live L 2 biovar of chlamydia, but not ocular serotypes, successfull y induced mucosal and systemic immunity, which partially protected the host from subsequent infectiou s challenge (Taylor et al ., 1987b) .\n\nCynomolgus monkeys develop conjunctival disease similar to that observed in humans (Whittum-Hudson and Taylor, 1984 ) . An intense mononuclear infiltrate appears in infected conjunctiva (Whittum-Hudso n et al ., 1986a,b ; Whittum-Hudson and Taylor, 1989) and is composed of high frequencies of chlamydia-specific T and B lymphocytes (Pal et al ., 1992) . Supporting th e importance of regional draining cervical lymph nodes i n conjunctival responses to pathogens, essentially identical frequencies of antigen-specific cells were detected i n these lymph nodes and the conjunctivae after infection , and in \" ocular-immune \" animals which were topicall y challenged with the chlamydial hsp60 antigen (Pal e t al ., 1990b (Pal e t al ., , 1992 . Serologic responses to chlamydia l hsp60 and hsp70 are vigorous during chronic chlamydial infections in man and animals (Newhall e t al ., 1982 ; Pal et al ., 1990a) , although neither of these proteins delivered by the ot route immunized naive monkeys (Taylor et at., 1987b (Taylor et at., , 1990 . In contrast, ot boosting after systemic or oral immunization with purified o r recombinant chlamydial antigens induced vigorous tea r IgA and IgG and serum antibodies (Campos et al ., 1995 ; O ' Brien et al ., 1994) . It remains unclear whether th e initial dosage of some antigens is too small to induc e typical primary secretory immune responses when presented to the mucosal immune system by ot delivery, o r if an antigen must replicate and/or be invasive to adequately prime experimental animals . Nevertheless, ocular boosting with purified antigens or infectious ocula r challenge of systemically primed animals has demonstrated that anamnestic tear antibody responses occu r rapidly for chlamydia (Campos et al ., 1995) . Combine d oral and subcutaneous priming with a chlamydial fusio n protein of a major outer membrane protein (MOMP ) variable domain incorporated into liposomes also primed for mucosal immune responses .\n\nThe rabbit model has also been used to test ocula r immune responses to other organisms . Live herpes simplex virus type 1 administered by the ocular rout e elicited tear IgA, but no IgG or IgM antibodies (Wille y et al ., 1985) . In contrast, application to scarified corne a induced tear IgA, IgG, and IgM responses (Centifanto et at ., 1989) . Whether these differing results relate to viru s strain invasiveness or access to underlying dendriti c cells is unclear . Live Staphylococcus aureus administered ot elicited tear IgA and IgG antibodies as did a S . aureus subunit (peptidoglycan-ribitol teichoic acid) vaccine administered by the intradermal or subconjunctiva l routes with complete Freund 's adjuvant (Mondino et al . , 1987a (Mondino et al . , ,b, 1991 . However, given the severe inflammatory properties of Freund ' s adjuvant and the restriction s on its use, this latter approach is impractical as a vaccination strategy .\n\nImmune potentiators, or adjuvants, have been used t o enhance antibody responses in both humans and animal models . Although the mechanisms responsible for response enhancement vary and are often not well de -\n\nL D fined, adjuvants appear to function by one or a combination of mechanisms : (1) increasing the influx of inflammatory cells ;\n\n(2) promotion of antigen presentation ; and/or (3) enhancing antigen uptake . Consideration o f immune potentiators to enhance ocular mucosal responses requires selection of compounds which will no t promote ocular inflammation and pathology. The most widely studied mucosal adjuvant ha s been cholera toxin (Lycke and Holmgren, 1968) although its effects on ocular immunity are less defined . Enhancement of mucosal responses depends on th e binding of the cholera toxin B subunit to the G M 1 ganglioside displayed on the luminal surface of enterocyte s such as M cells as well as potential modulatory effect s of the toxin on the B, T, and antigen-presenting cell s (Dertzbaugh and Elson, 1990 ; Elson and Dertzbaugh , 1994) . Cholera toxin enhances antibody response s when coadministered with many antigens, whereas th e B subunit apparently requires conjugation to antigen t o function optimally. Oral immunization with cholera toxin induced the appearance of toxin-specific antibodyforming cells in rat conjunctiva (Zhang et al ., 1983) an d toxin-specific antibodies in tears of monkeys (Campos e t al ., 1995) . However, ot administration of cholera toxi n with the DNP-Pn antigen did not enhance tear IgA antibody responses in the rat model ), but the effects of oral or ocular administration of antigens conjugated to the B subunit on tea r IgA responses have not been fully investigated . Based on recent data suggesting that nasal associated lymphoid tissue can serve as an inductive site for tear IgA antibody responses (Carr et al ., submitted) and the ability of the B subunit to serve as an adjuvant when coupled to antigens administered by the intranasal route (Bessen an d Fischetti, 1990 ; Wu and Russell, 1993) , this immunization protocol requires rigorous testing . Two other mucosal adjuvants, avridine and muramyl tripeptide, administered topically by the ocular route with DNP-Pn , did not enhance tear IgA antibody responses (Peppard e t al., 1988) .\n\nCytokines also appear to exert important regulatory effects on mucosal IgA responses including those a t ocular sites . Interleukin (IL)-6 knock-out mice have greatly reduced numbers of IgA producing cells at mucosae and exhibit grossly deficient local antibody responses to mucosal challenge (Ramsay et al ., 1994) . I n addition, transforming growth factor-a (TGF[3), IL-5 , and IL-6 have been shown to enhance in vitro IgA responses in murine B-cell cultures . TGF/3 appears to increase IgA synthesis by inducing B cells to switch to Ig A production (Coffman et al., 1989 ; Ehrhardt et al . , 1992) , whereas IL-5 and IL-6 induce IgA + B cells to terminally differentiate into IgA producing plasma cell s (Coffman et al ., 1987 ; Beagley et al., 1988 Beagley et al., , 1989 Harriman et al ., 1988) . IL-5, IL-6, and TGF13 have bee n shown to specifically enhance IgA production in vitro in a rat lacrimal gland tissue fragment culture syste m (Pockley and Montgomery, 1990 ; Rafferty and Montgomery, 1993) . Further, IL-5 and IL-6 in combination with antigen have been shown to enhance specific tear IgA antibody responses in rats following ot administration without affecting serum IgG antibody levels (Pockley and Montgomery, 1991) . Recent studies indicate that these enhanced tear IgA antibody responses persist following restimulation with antigen in the absence o f IL-5 and IL-6 ( Montgomery et al ., 1994) . Although th e mechanism(s) underlying this in vivo cytokine-mediated enhancement is not yet known, it is clear that the regulatory roles and therapeutic potential of these and othe r cytokines to modulate ocular mucosal antibody responses require further investigation .\n\nAlthough the oral or GI immunization route triggers IgA antibody responses at both intestinal and distal mucosa l sites and represents a safe, convenient alternative for vaccine administration, it is often difficult to presen t intact antigen to GALT-inductive sites . Particulate antigens, including viable organisms, generally appear to b e the most effective immunogens, probably due to their ability to survive the pH extremes and enzymatic degradation that occur along the alimentary tract . Since man y potential vaccine candidates are microbial component s or subunits and are not viable organisms or particulat e immunogens, considerable effort has focused on the development of delivery systems . Such delivery system s include liposomes and biodegradable microparticles, a s well as recombinant bacterial and viral vectors . Strategies for vehicle development have included not only delivery of intact immunogens and genes that code fo r relevant antigens, but also systems that promote uptake by relevant cells (e .g ., M cells) at GALT inductive sites . Detailed information on antigen delivery systems can b e found in several recent reviews (Eldridge et al ., 1993 ; Michalek et al ., 1994 Michalek et al ., , 1995 . Although many of these delivery systems may be relevant to the induction o f mucosal antibody responses owing to their ability to induce vigorous responses at GALT effector sites, information is more limited on the potential to employ thes e vehicles to induce ocular mucosal immune responses . Based on recent observations indicating that microparticle-encapsulated antigens evoke ocular mucosal responses, discussion will be confined to this delivery vehicle .\n\nPoly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) microparticles ar e biodegradable under physiological conditions and represent an important candidate vehicle for delivery an d controlled release of vaccine components (O ' Hagan et al., 1991 ; . PLG has been used for suture material (Wise et al., 1979) and as a delivery syste m for drugs (Hutchinson and Furr, 1985) . PLG does not evoke a tissue response (Visscher et al ., 1987) and ha s been certified by the FDA for human use. Recently , PLG microparticles have been used for ocular drug delivery without provoking histological or electrophysiological changes to the eye (Moritera et al ., 1992) . In addition, PLG encapsulated antigens induce sustaine d systemic and secretory immune responses following ora l administration (Challacombe et al ., 1992 ; Maloy et al . , 1994) . Based on these data as well as observations tha t the cytokines IL-5 and IL-6 enhanced tear IgA antibod y responses following topical application to the eye (Pockley and Montgomery, 1991 ; see Section III .B), PLG microparticles appear to be an appropriate vehicle to deliver antigens and immune potentiators to ocular mucosa l inductive sites . Studies indicate that DNP-bovine serum albumin as well as IL-5 and IL-6 can be encapsulated in PLG microparticles without significant loss o f activity . In addition, of delivery of encapsulated antige n and cytokines evokes long-term mucosal antibody responses in tears and distal secretions as well as circulating antibodies in the rat model (Rafferty et al ., 1996) . Further, oral delivery of a poly(lactide) encapsulate d chlamydia candidate vaccine in mice induced antige n specific serologic responses and conferred partial protection against ocular challenge (Whittum-Hudson et al ., 1995b ; see Section IV .A) . While further studies ar e required to define the regulatory parameters and event s leading to these responses, microparticles clearly ar e promising candidate delivery vehicles to elicit ocula r mucosal immune responses .\n\nThe conjunctiva is the most commonly infected tissue o f the eye (Syed and Hyndiuk, 1992 ; Tabbara and Hyndiuk, 1995) . Infection may be limited to the conjunctiv a only or may be part of a lid or corneal infection . Mos t conjunctival infections are not vision-threatening, bu t most notable exceptions are Neisseria gonorrheae and herpes simplex virus . Conjunctivitis associated with tularemia (adults) (Knorr and Weber, 1994) and haemophilus infections (infants) (Syed and Hyndiuk, 1992 ) are potentially fatal because of systemic dissemination . The profile of pathogens isolated from normal and diseased human conjunctiva may vary depending upon geographic locale (Syed and Hyndiuk, 1992) . Similarly, some veterinary pathogens of the conjunctiva/lacrima l gland are geographically confined (Lepper et al., 1993 ; Rogers et al ., 1993) . Chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva may lead to scar formation and is termed chronic progressive conjunctival cicatrisation (Bernauer et al . , 1993) . Cicatricial diseases often progress to involve th e lacrimal and meibomian glands . The combination of altered tear film, scar contraction, and corneal trauma from trichiasis may lead to blindness . Although there are noninfectious etiologies for many cicatrical disorders including pemphigoid, chlamydial infections of th e conjunctiva are a classic example of the blinding sequelae of infection . As discussed above and elsewhere , there are physical and biochemical barriers to help prevent ocular infection . For extracellular ocula r bacterial infections, antibodies are a major componen t of protective immunization . Both antibody and cell-mediated immunity are believed to be important in protection against intracellular pathogens including viruses , chlamydia, and mycobacteria . Antibodies would block infection and clear free organisms, whereas CD8 \u00b1 cytotoxic T cells would clear infected cells and prevent ful l differentiation and spread from lysed host cells . There i s little in vivo evidence from ocular sites that cytotoxic T lymphocytes are important in clearance of infectiou s pathogens . However, CD4 T cells serve as antigen presenting cells for B-cell responses and both CD4 an d CD8 T cells produce cytokines that facilitate B-an d T-cell responses . Many bacteria, viruses, and parasite s are targets for vaccine development to prevent respiratory, genital tract, or other infections . If protective mucosal immunization is induced at one or more of thes e latter sites, it is probable that the ocular mucosal surfaces would also be protected .\n\nA variety of bacteria can infect ocular tissues . Table I lists some of the bacterial pathogens that are known t o cause conjunctivitis . Bacterial conjunctivitis is mos t commonly caused by S . aureus . Streptococcus sp . ar e common conjunctival pathogens, except for 13-hemolyti c streptococci (S . pyogenes), while other members of thi s group are part of the normal conjunctival flora. Thes e bacteria and Haemophilus influenzae are the most common agents causing dacryocystitis (lacrimal gland infection) . Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a rare ocula r pathogen, but can cause conjunctival scarring and associated problems . For the most part, bacterial infection s of the conjunctiva are self-limiting and nonvision threatening . Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an exception, and this organism is the leading cause of hyperacute conjunctivitis particularly in developing countries (Syed an d Hyndiuk, 1992) . N. meningitis conjunctivitis, whic h cannot be distinguished clinically from N . gonorrhoeae, also may be associated with systemic disease . H . influenzae conjunctivitis occurs in children as well as adults , and one could predict a decline in the incidence of thi s ocular disease now that the Hib vaccine is available . Anaerobic organisms compose another part of the normal flora of the conjunctival sac . As for other infectiou s pathogens, the incidence of conjunctival infections with abnormal anaerobic organisms is increased in patients Aaberg, 1989 ; Zaidman, 199 3 Knorr and Weber, 199 4 Wills et al ., 1987 ; Taylor et al., 1992 ; Heggie and Lass, 1994 ; Brunha m and Peeling, 1994 ; Dhingra and Mahajan, 199 1 King et al., 1988 ; Brook and Hulburd , 199 3 Linde et al ., 199 3 Young, 1983 ; Zundel et al ., 199 2 \"Selected primary articles and/or reviews of bacterial ocula r pathogens .\n\n\"May cause conjunctivitis, but usually is associated with corneal infections following abrasion or tissue injury (Hazlett et al ., 1976 ; Ramphal et al ., 1981) .\n\n'Guinea pig ocular challenge model is used to test for protective immunity induced by anti-Shigella vaccine, because corneal / conjunctival epithelium is similar to intestinal epithelium in susceptibility to invasion by Shigella .\n\n\"Infects conjunctival mucosa, but is more of a problem fo r abortion in ewes and goats ; however, vaccination via the conjunctiv a reduced spontaneous abortions compared to systemic immunization .\n\nwith AIDS (Dugel and Rao, 1993 ; Campos et al ., 1994) . Similarly, some cases of microsporidial conjunctiviti s have been reported in AIDS patients (Lacey et al ., 1992 ; Lowder, 1993 ; Weber et al ., 1993) .\n\nChlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellula r bacterium, has received a great deal of attention with respect to vaccine development . While chlamydia ha s gained notoriety in recent years as a major sexuall y transmitted pathogen, it is, in fact, the leading cause o f preventable blindness . Trachoma, resulting from chronic chlamydial infection of the conjunctiva, has bee n known since ancient times . Studies of patients in several endemic areas worldwide yielded valuable informatio n regarding the epidemiologic, microbiologic, and serologic characteristics of trachoma (Nichols et al ., 1973 ; Grayston et al ., 1985 ; Dawson et al ., 1989 ; Mabey et al . , 1992 ; Taylor et al ., 1992) . Two major animals model s have been used for immunologic studies of chlamydia l ocular infections : a guinea pig model which can be infected with C . psittaci causing guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis (GPIC), and subhuman primates, includin g owl monkeys and cynomolgus monkeys, which can b e infected with several biovars of C . trachomatis, the usual human ocular pathogen (Patton, 1990 ; Rank and Whittum-Hudson, 1994) . More recently, a mouse model of ocular infection was developed using a human ocula r biovar (Whittum-Hudson et al ., 1995a) ; this mode l should aid in immunologic studies which have not bee n possible with the other outbred species .\n\nVaccine development for this bacterium has bee n hampered by several key factors : (1) no protective antigen or epitope(s) has been conclusively identified fro m the plethora of immunogenic proteins ; (2) no chlamydial target antigens have been shown convincingly t o be expressed on the surface of infected host cells, and (3) chlamydia-induced disease sequelae are immunemediated, though only the 57-kDa chlamydial heatshock protein has been associated with immunopathogenic responses (Watkins et al ., 1986 ; Taylor et al . , 1987a ; Morrison et al ., 1989a,b) .\n\nVarious permutations of the chlamydial major outer membrane protein (MOMP) have been tested fo r immunogenicity and their ability to induce protectiv e immunity in experimental animals . Biochemically extracted native MOMP, recombinant MOMP, or its variable domains have been presented by systemic and mucosal routes . In some cases, protection was tested b y infectious challenge at the ocular mucosal surface o r other sites (genital tract, lung, etc .) . Table II lists som e of the chlamydial vaccine candidates tested experimentally over the past two decades . In most cases, whol e MOMP or subunits were highly immunogenic as measured primarily by serologic responses, but no significant in vivo protection against ocular infection was observed after direct immunization . Studies by several groups (Ward et al ., 1986 ; Mabey et al . , 1991 ; Stagg et al ., 1993 ; Murdin et al ., 1993 Murdin et al ., , 1995 Tuffrey, 1994) have identified important MOMP peptide epitopes to which immune responses have been induced . None of these have been tested in ocular infection models as yet, but several have been at leas t partially protective in chlamydial genital infection models (reviewed by Tuffrey, 1994) .\n\nOther chlamydial antigens such as the chlamydial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have been shown to be immunogenic but not protective in an ocular infection model (Taylor and Prendergast, 1987 ) . An additiona l chlamydial antigen, the exoglycolipid antigen (GLXA ) (Stuart and MacDonald, 1989) , is also expressed b y chlamydia and secreted from infected cell in vitro (Stuart et al ., 1991 Wyrick et al ., 1994) . Monoclonal anti-idiotypic (Id) antibodies to GLXA have bee n shown to immunize and protect mice against subsequent infectious ocular challenge with a human biovar of chlamydia . Oral immunization of BALB/c mice with poly(lactide) encapsulated anti-Id antibodies to GLXA was shown recently t o be even more protective than the soluble antibody sinc e 25-fold less antibody presented in microspheres induce d equivalent or better reduction in microbiologic disease . In both cases, mice developed serum antibodies to th e Holzberg et al ., 199 2 Syed and Hyndiuk, 199 2 Murphy et al ., 199 1 Syed and Hyndiuk, 1992 Pal et al., 199 4 Taylor et al ., 1987 b Grayston et al ., 1962 Nichols et al ., 1966 Nichols et al ., , 1969 Soldati et al ., 1971 ; Schachter, 198 5 Taylor et al ., 1987 a Taylor et al ., 198 8 Batteiger et al ., 1993 Campos et al ., 199 5 Campos et al ., 199 5 Wong et al ., 199 0 Taylor et al ., 198 9 Tuffrey, 1994 Allen and Stephens, 199 3 O ' Brien et al ., 1994 ; Whittum-Hudson et al ., 1995 a Hayes et al ., 199 1 Murdin et al., 1993 , 199 5 Taylor et al., 199 0 Taylor et al., 199 0 Rank et al ., 199 5 Whittum-Hudson and Taylor, 1994 Whittum-Hudso n et al ., 1995a,b GLXA and these antibodies were neutralizing for in vitro infectivity (Whittum-Hudson et al ., 1995b ; Whittum-Hudson et al ., submitted) . This type of vaccine approac h has potential value for chlamydial infections at othe r sites, and against other biovars since the GLXA antige n is genus-specific as opposed to being serovar-specific . It has been hypothesized by several investigator s that protective immunity against chlamydia will requir e induction of neutralizing antibody in tears and it is assumed that this will be S-IgA . IgA in tears from patient s with trachoma passively neutralized chlamydia and reduced disease in eyes of owl monkeys (Nichols et al . , 1973 ; Barenfanger and MacDonald, 1974) . This wa s consistent with observations in guinea pigs ocularly infected with C . psittaci (Orenstein et al ., 1973 ; Malaty et al., 1981) . The dilemma with the chlamydial pathogen i s that individuals who have had a previous ocular (or other site) infection with chlamydia are not significantl y protected against subsequent ocular infections . Thi s lack of protective immunity is seen despite evidence of vigorous antibody responses to many chlamydial anti -gens in tears and serum and in vitro lymphocyte proliferative responses to whole organism or purified antigen s (Newhall et al ., 1982 ; Ward et at., 1986 ; Whittum-Hudson and Taylor, 1989 ; Taylor, 1990) . Several clinical studies have shown a poor correlation of acquisition o f genital chlamydial infection with the presence of neutralizing serum antibodies ( Jones and Van der Poi , 1994) .\n\nCytotoxic T cells have not yet been associated directly with ocular protective immunity, nor with the immunopathogenesis of chlamydia ocular infection . It ha s been argued that the lack of exposure of chlamydial antigens on the surface of infected host cells would prevent them from serving as immunologic targets and ma y explain the failure to induce T-cell-mediated immunity . However, recent electron microscopic studies of huma n endometrial cells have shown that chlamydial MOMP , LPS, and the GLXA (Wyrick et al., 1994) all pass fro m the inclusion body through the cytoplasm to the cel l membrane . LPS are GLXA and both known to exit infected cells (Brade et al ., 1986 ; Stuart et al., 1991 ; Lukacova et at ., 1994) . In addition, recent studies demonstrated CD8 mediated cytotoxic killing by chlamydiaprimed T cells in vitro and some in vivo protection after experimental genital infection (Beatty and Stephens , 1994 ; Starnbach et at., 1994) . Thus, it is possible that chlamydial antigen presentation to CD8 + effector T cells may occur in the context of MHC class I . B . Viral and Parasitic Infection s Table III lists many of the viral and parasitic pathogen s known to infect ocular tissues . With respect to viruses , such infections frequently result in conjunctivitis i n both children and adults and these highly contagiou s infections (epidemic keratoconjunctivitis) resolve spontaneously over 2-3 weeks . The most common vira l pathogen of the conjunctiva is adenovirus . Several adenovirus types (3, 7, 8, 19 ) may be associated with conjunctivitis, though corneal involvement is often see n (hurrah, 1988) .\n\nOcular herpesvirus infections, though most ofte n affecting the cornea, may cause conjunctivitis durin g primary infection . However, conjunctivitis is rare durin g recurrent infections with herpes simplex virus (Holzber g et at ., 1992) . Herpes zoster ophthalmicus may develo p in patients with latent varicella-zoster virus infections , and the conjunctivia is one of several ocular sites mos t often affected (Liesegang, 1993) . Since at present ther e is no vaccine for herpesviruses, antiviral drugs remai n the therapeutic option . There is a large literature concerning anti-herpesvirus vaccine development strate - gies, and this information is detailed in several review s (Rouse and Lopez, 1984 ; Dix, 1987 ; Mader and Stulting, 1992 ; Stanberry, 1994) . In addition to the fact tha t herpesviruses are ubiquitous and that the majority o f individuals have been exposed previously, vaccine development strategies for ocular and extraocular herpes virus infections must deal with a number of questions : (1 ) Can recurrence of latent infections be ablated by vaccination or must primary infection be prevented? (2 ) Will herpesvirus-induced immunosuppression be overcome by appropriate immunization? (3) Will a combination subunit vaccine be required? and (4) Is systemic rather than mucosal immunization required? Table I V lists some recent herpes simplex virus vaccine candidates . A number of viral glycoproteins have been targeted for vaccines (e .g ., Burke et al ., 1994) , although there are some examples of better protection being conferred by vaccination with live organisms (Ghiasi et al . , 1995) . Studies which directly tested for protectio n against ocular herpes simplex virus infections have use d various viral constructs ranging from single or multipl e glycoprotein constructs and deletion mutants delivere d with or without adjuvant . Avirulent constructs hav e been tested in a variety of experimental models and clinical trials . While most immunizations have been via systemic routes (subcutaneous or intraperitoneal), a recen t study using the rabbit model of recurrent ocular herpe s infection showed that subconjunctival immunizatio n with recombinant gB and gD after establishment of latent infection reduced spontaneous recurrence s (Nesburn et at ., 1994) . Promising results have bee n Wickham et al., 199 4 Syed and Hyndiuk, 1992 ; Tabarra and Hyndiuk, 199 5 Huang et al ., 1994 Pepose, 1994 ; Holzberg et al., 1992 Pepose, 199 4 Holzberg et al., 1992 ; Syed an d Hyndiuk, 199 2 McDonnell et al ., 199 2 Syed and Hyndiuk, 199 2 Conway et al ., 199 1 Callanan et al ., 199 2 Taylor, 199 4 Gori and Scasso, 1994 Vaccin e Purified or synthetic glycoproteins gB, gC gB, gC gD-1, gD-2 gB-1, gD-1,-2 g D Baculovirus-expressed glycoprotein s gB, gI, gC, gE, gG, and/or g H gB-2, gD-2 Adenovirus-expressed glycoprotein s gB Vaccina virus-expressed glycoproteins References a Chan, 198 3 Roberts et al ., 198 5 Long et al., 198 4 Dix and Mills, 198 5 Ishizaka and Mishkin , 1991 ; Burke et al ., 1994 Ghiasi et al ., 199 5 Nesburn et al., 199 4 Gallichan et al ., 1993 Aurelian et al ., 1991 Rooney et al ., 1991 ; Banks et al., 1994 ; Flec k et al ., 199 4 Farrell et al., 199 4 Cantin et al ., 199 2 a Selected primary articles and/or reviews of nonbacterial ocular pathogens .\n\nb infects and replicates in cultured rat lacrimal gland acina r cells ; but its capacity to infect in vivo is not known .\n\nDeletion mutants (gH ) Anti-sense nucleic acid s 'Selected references ; see also Rouse and Lopez, 1984 ; Dix , 1987 ; Mader and Stulting, 1992 ; Stanberry, 1994 . shown in extraocular infection models by several groups . These have included strategies of mucosal vaccinatio n with recombinant adenovirus expressing herpes simple x virus gB (Gallichan et at ., 1993) , subcutaneous immunization with virus constructs missing an essential glycoprotein (e . g ., gH ; Farrell et al ., 1994) , and systemic delivery of synthetic peptides . Other approaches have included use of anti-sense nucleic acids (Cantin et al . , 1992) and use of other expression systems (e .g . , baculovirus and vaccinia) . Recent studies of cytokine responses associated with in vivo or in vitro anti-viral protection have implicated IL-6, IL-10, and TNFa in either recovery from or reduced herpes infection (Che n et Tumpey et al ., 1994 ; Babu et al ., 1995) . Further investigations are required to distinguish between T-cell-mediated immunopathologic effects (Newell et al ., 1989 ; Hendricks and Tumpey, 1990 ; Hendricks et al ., 1992) and the potential requiremen t for individual T-cell subsets in vaccine-induced immunity.\n\nSeveral common parasitic infections may caus e conjunctivitis . These include Mulluscum contagiosum , Onchocerca vulva, Verruca vulgaris, and Trypanosom a cruzi . In some cases, the conjunctival mucosa may b e the portal of entry (e .g ., T. cruzi) . The pathologic result s of trypanosomiasis include the oculoglandular or ophthalmoganglionar complex composed of lid edema , granulomatous conjunctivitis, follicles, and inflammation of the lacrimal gland . Parinaud ' s oculoglandular syndrome is rare, and may also be caused by additiona l viral or bacterial agents (e .g ., F . tularensis, M . tuberculosis) (Syed and Hynduik, 1992) .\n\nExperimental models of conjunctival and lacrima l gland infections have been used for many years both t o identify pathogenic and protective immune response s and, more recently, to evaluate vaccine candidates . Recent advances include new rat and rabbit models of adenovirus ocular infections, which should help in evaluation of immune-mediated responses to these pathogen s (Tsai et al., 1992 ; Gordon et al ., 1994) .\n\nIt is clear that events taking place both in conjunctiva l tissue and lacrimal gland are relevant to ocular mucosa l vaccination strategies . While the lacrimal gland functions as a primary effector site for mucosal IgA antibod y responses, the precise relationship of the conjunctiva t o the mucosal network requires further study. It appear s that the conjunctiva plays a role in the induction o f mucosal antibody responses as well as serving as an effector site for cell-mediated responses . A variety of factors are involved in the regulation of ocular mucosa l antibody responses and many options such as immunization routes, delivery vehicles, and immune potentia -tors have been investigated . Although the development of appropriate immunization strategies will depend o n the properties of each potential vaccine candidate a s well as the target ocular pathogen, the appropriate technology is now available to elicit mucosal antibody responses at the ocular surface . The current challenge is to identify and select the vaccine component(s) that ca n be used to elicit long-term protective responses to ocula r pathogens .\n\nStudies from our laboratories which are summarized i n this chapter were supported in part by NIH Grant s EY05133, EY04068, and EY03324, and by Edna Mc -Connell Clark Foundation Grants 10993, 11092, an d 13594 .
