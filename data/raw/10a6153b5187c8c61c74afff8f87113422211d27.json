{"title": "Inferring Timing of Infection Using Within-host SARS-CoV-2 Infection Dynamics Model: Are \"Imported Cases\" Truly Imported?", "body": "To avoid future outbreaks, governments implement various border control programs: 48 quarantine and isolation of confirmed and suspicious cases, and travel restriction to and from 49 countries with ongoing outbreaks. Additionally, effort focuses on identification and isolation of 50 suspicious cases. Suspicious cases that are confirmed, are followed by further investigation -51 through interviews, contact tracing, and genomic analysis -to infer whether they are imported 52 cases or secondary cases 3 . Secondary cases indicate possible local ongoing transmissions. Thus, 53 a shift in intervention programs to mitigating the burden of outbreak (e.g., school closure) is 54\n\nIdentification and differentiation of secondary transmission from imported cases is essential. 56\n\nTraditionally, this requires interview-based assessments, which are unreliable (e.g., recall bias 57 especially when individuals travel frequently). In this study, we propose to use viral load data 58 coupled with a model to differentiate secondary transmission from imported cases. Our flexible 59 method is applicable for any countries/communities at risk of future outbreaks. 60\n\nTo illustrate this, we analyzed cases reports from Singapore. In Singapore, the first case 61 was identified on 23 rd January 2020, and currently 345 cases have been confirmed positive using 62 reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test as of 19 March 2020 4 ( Figure 1A) . 63\n\nThe first 18 cases reported had travel history connecting them to Wuhan, China, thus considered evidence of ongoing local transmission, we leveraged viral load data collected 5 for multiple time enables us to infer time of infection (i.e., before or after arrival to Singapore). 69 70\n\nExpected day of infection establishment 72 Figure 1A depicts the weekly epidemic curve in Singapore from January 21 st to March 15 th 73 based on symptom onset and laboratory confirmation. Because the laboratory test is performed 74 after symptom onset, the epidemic curve based on laboratory confirmation follows the curve based 75 on symptom onset. For the first few weeks, the epidemic in Singapore was not in the phase of 76 exponential growth, which suggests secondary transmissions are limited and any long chains of 77 transmission did not succeed yet. The first 18 cases discussed here are in the first two weeks of 78 the epidemic. Here we assessed whether the 12 initial 'imported' cases were in fact imported or the result 90 of ongoing transmission in Singapore. We found that 6 of 12 cases were clearly infected before 91 arrival to Singapore, the other however have likely been infected after the arrival to Singapore. 92\n\nThis provides evidence of within-country transmission prior to the 19 th case being reported (3 Feb). 93 All rights reserved.

The advantage of using this method is 95 that computation is solely based on viral load data. Collecting viral load in early phase of outbreak 96 is ideal for the beginning of an outbreak. We suggest this method as a complementary test to the 97 basic clinical routine for the novel disease identification. Given that recall bias is an issue, our 98 method reliably assesses the timing of infection. This estimation will be further enhanced if 99 combined with the complementary information (e.g., travel and contact history and genetic 100 information) thus reducing uncertainty in our predictions. 101\n\nThere are limitations to our approach. Our approach requires viral load data over multiple 102 time points; therefore, we may not be able to estimate the timing of infection immediately after 103 symptom onset. Further, we need to note that both the boundaries and the day of infection 104 establishment estimated using our approach could be underestimated, because infection is 105\n\nestablished after exposure starts. 106\n\nFor countries and communities at risk of future COVID-19 outbreak, which include second 107 outbreaks after significant decreased transmission (i.e. China), we strongly recommend monitoring 108 the viral load in the early phase of outbreaks. As such, the method we used may be critical to help 109 shape a country's early response to an outbreak.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nWe obtained two datasets from two published papers 5,6 (we have not collected original data in this 114 study). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for the 18 cases reported in Singapore, for up to 30 115 days from symptom onset. Viral loads were measured by RT-PCR 5 . We excluded 5 cases who 116 received lopinavir-ritonavir and 1 case whose viral load was detected only twice. In total, we 117\n\nanalyzed the first 12 cases. In addition, to find \"infection establishment boundary\" (see Viral load 118 boundary for infection establishment) and achieve robust parameter estimation, we obtained 119 an additional dataset of viral loads measured in nasal swab collected from the 8 cases reported in 120 All rights reserved.

All 137 viral load data including Singapore and Zhuhai patients were simultaneously fitted using a 138 nonlinear mixed-effect modelling approach, which uses samples to estimate population 139 parameters while accounting for inter-individual variation (Table 1) . Further, sampled parameter 140 sets were used to predict the estimated day of SARS-CoV-2 infection establishment, that is, the 141 start of the exponential growth phase of viral loads 9 . The infection establishment time, inf , was 142 estimated by hindcasting, when the viral load reaches the boundary. The viral load boundary for 143\n\ninfection establishment was computed using the three secondary infection cases reported in 144\n\nZhuhai, whose start days of exposure to the primary cases are known 6 . We assumed that the start 145 day of exposure is equal to the day of infection establishment. If the estimated day of infection is 146\n\nAll rights reserved.
