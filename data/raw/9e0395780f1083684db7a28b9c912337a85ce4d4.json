{"title": "DISPOSABLE N95 MASKS PASS QUALITATIVE FIT-TEST BUT HAVE DECREASED FILTRATION EFFICIENCY AFTER COBALT-60 GAMMA IRRADIATION", "body": "An N95 mask, when fitted correctly, blocks 95% of 0.3 micron particles, and provides an important barrier against disease transmission as part of a healthcare provider's personal protective equipment (PPE). Unfortunately, a shortage of N95 masks globally amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [1] has forced healthcare providers in hard hit areas to use a single mask for hours or days at time-or simply go without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) [8, 9] .\n\nGiven the ease of access to N95 masks during normal times, much remains unknown about the efficacy of various sterilization mechanisms on disposable masks since there is little impetus to reuse these masks outside of major disaster and pandemic events. Several methods of sterilizing N95 masks between uses are currently being studied across the world. The advantages of these methods and concerns regarding their use are summarized in Table 1 . Vaporized hydrogen peroxide and EtO treatments in particular are described in detail by Viscusi et al (2009) [2] ; UV treatment procedures are described in Darnell & Taylor (2006) and Kumar et al (2015) [10] .\n\nBoth gamma and electron sources have been shown to accomplish viral inactivation in other arenas, such as food and mail sterilization. While the literature does not yet report on SARS-Cov2 itself, gamma ray radiation doses of between 5 and 10 kGy have been shown to achieve 4 log 10 reduction of most viruses, including other single stranded RNA viruses [4, 11] . In particular, a 2019 study SARS-CoV was reported to be inactivated by a dose of 10 kGy, although lower doses were not studied [3] ; and a 2015 study showed a 5 log 10 reduction of MERS-CoV [10] with 10 kGy. Electron beam sterilization generally requires higher dose for the same inactivat-.

This could reduce the biosafety logistics surrounding sterilization as compared to UV, ovens, and chemical techniques. With the increasing evidence in recent days for the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV2, there is likely a need for biosafety level 3 management of soiled masks. Individual masks could also be bagged and labeled separately within the container.\n\n60 Co sources are often used in radiation therapy, food sterilization, and in basic science. Many hospitals across the world have access to 60 Co sources as they are widely used for radiotherapy. However, 60 Co sources decline in dose over time (half life = 5.6 years), so older units may not be able to provide a sufficient dose for mass sterilization. There are other sources for generating high energy gamma rays besides 60 Co and our results on the operational survivability of the masks are applicable to any sterilization procedure with an equivalent dose and energy spectrum.\n\nIt should be emphasized that sterilization using gamma rays does not leave the masks radioactive. Specifically, the 1.17 and 1.33 MeV gamma rays emitted by 60 Co as it decays will not induce secondary activation within the mask. This is in contradistinction to proton or neutron sources that could conceivably cause this effect.\n\nA set of five each of 3M 8210 and 9105 \"duckbill\" masks were irradiated to doses of 10 kGy and 50 kGy using a Gammacell 220 Excel Irradiator at MIT. The chamber in the irradiator is approximately 6 inches in diameter and 8 inches tall. Since the most radio-opaque component in the masks is a thin aluminum nose piece, which is still essentially transparent to the \u223c1.3 MeV photons produced in 60 Co decay, the dose throughout the chamber should be fairly uniform.\n\nThe masks received either 10 kGy or 50 kGy of radiation emitted from the pencil rods in a circular pattern, at a dose rate of 2.2 kGy per hour. Dose variability was \u226410%, based on previous characterization of this source. Spacers were used to position the masks in the most uniform flux region -if the chamber were fully packed the dose variability would be closer to 15%, and approximately 100 masks could be fit in the chamber.\n\nThe OSHA-approved Gerson Qualitative Fit Test [7] QLFT 50 (saccharin apparatus) was utilized at Brigham and Women's Hospital to check whether the masks suffered degradation during irradiation. Three masks of each type were tested at each dose level; all tests were performed blind Then, the fit test was repeated for each mask, handed to the test subject who was facing away from the masks to help exclude detection bias from the results. Masks from the three dose categories were tested in a random order. One test had to be repeated due to improper donning of the mask. 3M 9105  3  3  3  3M 8210  3  3 3 + 1 a a One mask in this category was improperly donned by the subject.\n\nThe masks that were not used in the qualitative fit test were tested for their particulate filtering efficiency at MIT (masks used in the qualitative fit test were not brought to MIT in an attempt to adhere to social distancing guidelines).\n\nThe masks were inserted into a specialized air duct, and ambient particulate matter was flowed through the duct (through the filter), with a pressure differential of approximately 175 pascals at 0.4 m/s face velocity. 0.3, 0.5, and 1 \u00b5m particles were tested, and the filtering efficiency was measured using an optical particle counter (Aerotrak 9306, TSI Inc.).\n\n.

All masks, including the unirradiated controls, the 10 kGy, and the 50 kGy masks passed a qualitative fit test (no saccharin was detected by the subject), with the exception of one mask that had received 50 kGy that was donned improperly. For the one 50 kGy-irradiated 8210 mask that did result in saccharin taste sensation by the test subject, the cause was found to be poor donning of the mask (the subject reported cool air flowing in around his nose while breathing in during that particular test). This was the second mask tested in the series of 18, and this test failure was believed to be due to inexperience on the part of the test subject in correctly applying a tight fit to the mask. After more practice, an additional 50 kGy-irradiated 8210 mask was randomly inserted into the test matrix, and it along with all other masks resulted in no detection of the saccharin mist. The one anomalous test served to confirm that the test subject could strongly taste the saccharin mist if it entered the mask, either through the filter or around the mask periphery. The subject did notice that some irradiated masks had a slight unrecognizable odor-the Food and Drug Administration notes that gamma ray sterilization of foods can impart an odor as well [14] .\n\nParticular matter filtration data are shown in table 3. The irradiated masks performed much more poorly than the unirradiated controls, especially in the filtration of 0.3 \u00b5m particles.\n\nWhile disposable N95 masks remain functional as per an qualitative fit test after receiving both 10 kGy and 50 kGy doses of gamma radiation, the fact that their measured particular filtering efficiency declined so severely suggests against using ionizing radiation as a method of mask sterilization. The small particle filtration properties of a mask are provided by primarily electrostatic, rather than mechanical processes, so it is likely that the ionizing radiation is discharging the mask.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the masks continued to pass the qualitative fit test even after being irradiated is a significant finding, and suggests that the qualitative fit test alone cannot be used to assess the success or failure of an N95 sterilization procedure."}
