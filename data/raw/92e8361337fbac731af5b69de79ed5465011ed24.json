{"title": "Residues Involved in the Antigenic Sites of Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus S Glycoprotein", "body": "Within the Coronaviridae family, transmissible gastroenteritis virus forms an antigenic cluster with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) (Sgnchez et a/., 1990) . TGEV has three structural proteins: the spike protein (S), the nucleoprotein (N), and the membrane (M) protein (Spaan et a/., 1988 (Spaan et a/., , 1990 Enjuanes and Van der Zeijst, 1991) . The S protein forms the peplomers of the virus and consists of 1447 or 1449 amino acids, depending on the viral strain (Rasschaert and Laude, 1987; Jacobs et a/., 1987; Wesley, 1990; Britton et al., 1990) . Several biological activities have been associated with the S protein: (i) It is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies and is involved in protection (Garwes et a/., 1978; Jimenez et a/., 1986; Delmas et a/., 1986) ; (ii) it includes the receptor binding site and determines viral tropism (Holmes eta/., 1981; Collins et a/., 1982; Sut% eta/., 1990) ; (iii) it is involved in pathogenicity (Taguchi and Fleming, 1989) ; (iv) it may induce ' To whom correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed. cell fusion (Collins et al., 1982; Sturman et a/., 1985; DeGroot et al., 1989) ; and (v) it has hemagglutinating activity (Holmes et a/., 1989) .\n\nType-, group-, and interspecies-specific antigenic determinants have been described for the S glycoprotein of TGEV (SBnchez eta/., 1990) . In this protein, four antigenic sites (A, B, C, and D) have been defined by mutual competition of MAbs. Site A is antigenically dominant and has been divided into three antigenic subsites: Aa, Ab, and AC (Correa et a/., 1988) . Three of the antigenic sites overlap with sites described by others (Delmas et al., 1990; . We have focused on the analysis of the different antigenic sites because of their importance in determining the molecular basis of virulence and immunoprotection against TGE.\n\nPreviously, we have located these four sites within the 543 N-terminal amino acids of the S protein . Site D has been analyzed by epitope scanning (PEPSCAN) . In the present study we have: (i) isolated and characterized 21 TGEV mutants, each deficient in one of the antigenie sites; (ii) identified residues involved in each site by determining the nucleotide differences between the wild-type (wt) virus and mutant viruses; (iii) identified c RNA sequencing was performed on RNA from purified virions. d The antigenic subsites were defined as described by Correa et al. (1988 and 1990). sequences, by epitope scanning (Geysen et al., 1984) , that could represent antigenic sites A and C; and (iv) described the glycosylation dependence and surface exposure of the sites.\n\nTGEV was grown in swine testicle (ST) cells (McClurkin and Norman, 1966) . The strain PUR46-CC120-MAD of TGEV (Sgnchez et al., 1990 ) was used to select virus mutants. This strain was cloned five times in our laboratory. The procedure for TGEV neutralization has been described (Correa et al., 1988) . The neutralization index was defined as the log,,, of the ratio of the PFU after incubating the virus in presence of medium or the indicated MAb. The virus was purified as described (Correa et a/., 1988) or partially purified from supernatants of infected cultures. In the latter case, partially purified virus was collected when a CPE of 10 to 50% was observed, by clarification at 6 X 1 O3 rpm (Sorvall GS3 rotor) for 20 min followed by sedimenta-tion at 25 X 1 O3 rpm (Sorvall AH627 rotor) for 1.5 hr at 4\". Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 strain (kindly provided by K. Holmes) was grown on 3T3 cells and purified as described (Sgnchez et al., 1990) .\n\nThe characteristics of the MAbs have been previously described (Jimenez et al., 1986; Correa et al., 1988 Sgnchez et al., 1990; Suile et al., 1990 ).\n\nSelection of MAb resistant (mar) mutants mar mutants were selected by neutralizing MAbs as described (Jimenez et al., 1986; Correa et al., 1988) ( Table 1) . After selection, neutralization titers decreased from 4.8 to less than 0.5. With the non-neutralizing MAbs 1 B.H 11 and 1 D.G3, mar mutants were selected via a procedure similar to the one described by Marlin et al, (1985) . Briefly, 10' PFU of TGEV in 50 ~1 medium were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 50 ~1 of MAb supernatant, followed by the addition of 50 ~1 of a 1: 10 dilution of rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Cappel) in phosphate-buffered sa-MAb mar MUTANT\n\nFIG. 1. Neutralization of TGEV mar mutants by MAbs and amino acid changes responsible for the escape of mar mutants. White, hatched, and black squares represent neutralization index ~1, between 1 and 2, and >2, respectively. The amino acid substitutions in the white areas are indicated with the one-letter code.\n\nline (PBS). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and used to infect ST cells. After 2 hr of adsorption, unadsorbed virus was washed out and the cells were incubated at 37\". When CPE appeared, supernatant was collected. The whole procedure was repeated a total of five times, and virus was then plated for in situ immunoscreening (see below). Unstained plaques were selected, incubated in the presence of MAb and the second antibody as described above, and cloned three times.\n\nMutants that escaped binding of MAb 1 D.Bl2 were selected by incubating 10' PFU of TGEV in 0.1 ml of medium with 2 ~1 of ascitic fluid at 37\" for 2 hr. After addition of 50 ~1 of 20% Staphylococcus aureus coated with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins and incubation at 4' for 1 hr, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. A 50-~1 sample of S. aureus was added, and the cycle was repeated two more times. The supernatant was used to infect ST cells, which were incubated at 37\" overnight. One hundred microliters of the supernatant was collected and the whole procedure repeated four more times. Selected viruses were cloned three times and characterized by in situ immunoscreening (IMS) as previously described (Diez et a/., 1989) . Briefly, the plaques were recognized by a MAb in an immunotest. A nitrocellulose filter was ap-plied to the agar overlay of a TGEV assay to bind infectious virus from individual plaques and stored at -70\". On a second filter, which was placed directly on the cell monolayer, enough virus was bound to permit calorimetric visualization of plaques by an enzymelinked assay using MAbs. Infectious virus was recovered by soaking the plaque containing filter in PBS with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS).\n\nThe procedure for the RIA has been previously described (Correa eta/., 1988; Sanchez eta/., 1990) . Optimum amounts of antigen (between 0.2 and 1 .O gg of protein per well) were used in a RIA and in a competitive radioimmunoassay (cRIA).\n\nEpitope scanning PEPSCAN analysis was performed using all 1439 consecutive overlapping nonapeptides derived from the sequence of the S protein of TGEV (Jacobs et al., 1987; Rasschaer-t and Laude, 1987) . The peptides were synthesized on polyethylene rods and tested as described previously (Geysen et al., 1984; Posthumus eta/., 1990) . The first peptide consisted of amino acids 1 to 9, the second consisted of amino acids 2 to 10, the third consisted of amino acids 3 to 11, etc. The binding of a MAb to each peptide was tested in an enzymelinked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) and expressed as the optical absorbance at 405 nm. Ascitic fluid dilutions varied from 1: 1 O3 to 1:5 X 1 03. Binding was plotted vertically against the sequence position of the Nterminal amino acid of the peptide. Overlapping nonato dodecapeptides from the region consisting of the residues 533 to 553 and peptides in which each amino acid of the parent sequence 537-MKRSGYGQPIA-547 was consecutively replaced by all 19 other amino acids were synthesized and tested in the same way. The amino acid replacements were plotted in alphabetical order: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, and Y (Fig. 3B ).\n\nDNA and RNA sequencing DNA purified from the Bluescript-TGEV plasmids and RNA purified from virions were sequenced by oligodeoxynucleotide primer extension and dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedures @anger er al., 1977; Zimmern and Kaesberg, 1978) . For RNA sequencing primers complementary to the S-gene were used. Sequence data were assembled and analyzed using the computer programs of the Genetics Computer Group (University of Wisconsin). L FIG. 2. Binding of MAbs to TGEV derived mar mutants. MAb binding was determined by RIA, with binding to strain PUR46-CC120-MAD of TGEV as reference value (100). The mar mutants are named according to the MAb used in their selection. The specificity of the MAbs is named according to Correa et al. (1988) . White, hatched, and black squares represent relative binding between 0 to 19, 20 to 40, and 41 to 100, respectively. ND, not determined. MolV, Moloney leukemra virus. MHV. mouse hepatitis virus.\n\nof the surface exposure of the epitopes by cRlA\n\nThe accessibility of epitopes on the virus surface was determined by cRIA. It was assumed that higher surface exposure of one epitope would provide a higher inhibition of the binding of the MAb specific for this epitope to the solid phase bound virus. TGEV antigen was plated as described above. Hybridoma supernatants of the MAbs (50 PI), at a dilution giving 90% of maximum binding, were added to TGEV coated wells and incubated at 37\" for 30 min in the presence of twofold dilutions of competitor virus. To measure the binding of the MAbs to the solid-phase bound virus '261-labeled MAb (5 x lo4 cpm/well; 1 x lo6 cpm/pl; 1 x lo7 cpm/pg protein) was added to wells and incubated at 37\" for 1 hr. The radioactivity bound was determined as described for a RIA. A competition curve was generated for each virus sample. The relative exposure of an antigenic site was defined as the percentage of inhibition of binding of a MAb to virus coated wells by a fixed amount of virus in solution (5 pg per well) divided by 10. This value was extrapolated from each competition curve.\n\nThe S glycoprotein was purified by phase separation using Triton X-l 14 (Correa et al., 1988) . After dissolution the protein (1 pg/20 ~1) in 0.1 M sodium acetate, Correa ef al. (1988) .\n\nb The frequency of mar mutant isolation was defined as previously described (Jimenez et al., 1986 ). pH 7, 0.5010 sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.1 mM N-a-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), and 1 pg/ml pepstatin was deglycosylated by incubation overnight at 37\" with protein /V-glycosidase F (0.04 U/PI; Boehringer Mannheim). The reaction was stopped by freezing. The extent of the deglycosylation was studied by Western blot analysis (Correa et a/., 1988) after 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the presence of 0.1% SDS without 2-mercaptoethanol.\n\nN-glycosylation was prevented by infecting ST cells with TGEV at a m.o.i. of 10 PFU/cell, in the presence of 5 pg of tunicamycin/ml.\n\nAt the indicated times, the infected monolayers were scraped off with a rubber policeman and cells and supernatant were separated by low-speed centrifugation. The presence of S protein in these samples was determined by Western blot analysis after 0.1% SDS-PAGE in the absence of 5% 2-mer-captoethanol (unless otherwise indicated) using sitespecific MAbs .\n\nA collection of 1 1 single MAb resistant (mar) mutants and 2 double mar (h-tar) mutants has been isolated from the PUR46 strain of TGEV, using MAbs specific for three subsites (Aa, Ab, and AC) of TGEV S glycoprotein. The nucleotide sequence differences between these mutants and parental virus have been determined by: (i) sequencing the complete S gene cDNA of the PUR46 wt strain and the first 2000 nucleotides of the PUR46 dear 1 B.B5-1 B.Bl cDNA; (ii) direct RNA sequencing of nucleotides from position 1600 to 2000 of all mutants (Table 1) ; and (iii) direct RNA sequencing of the complete S gene of the mar 1 D.E7 mutant. The escape of mar mutants from neutralization by MAbs specific for subsites Aa, Ab, and AC was associated with amino acid changes in positions 538, 591, and 543, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ). Changes in amino acid 586 from Asp to Asn affected both subsites Aa and Ab. All escape mutants selected by MAb 1 B.B5 had an additional amino acid change at position 631.\n\nThe mar mutants were characterized by neutralization ( Fig. 1 ) and by binding of MAbs (Fig. 2 ). Mutants selected with site A-specific MAbs, only showed antigenie changes in site A. The mutants selected by the Aa-specific MAbs could be divided into three groups according to their binding pattern ( Fig. 2) : (i) mar 1 E.F9 and lG.A7; (ii)mar lG.A6, lE.H8, lD.B3, lB.Cl, and lC.Cl2; and (iii) mar 1 B.H6. The binding patterns correlated well with the amino acid substitutions (Fig.  1 ). In mar 1 B.H6, subsites Aa and Ab were affected. mar 1 B.B5 escaped neutralization by MAbs specific for subsite AC (1 B.B5, lA.FlO, and 6A.C3). However, the epitope of 6A.C3 is probably only partially affected since the binding of mar 1 B.B5 by MAb 6A.C3 was normal and MAb 6A.C3 neutralized the 1 B.B5 mutant at higher concentrations (not shown). In dear 1 B.B5-1 D.E7 mutant, introduction of changes in subsites Ab and AC also affected subsite Aa (Fig. 2) . In dear lB.B5-lB.Bl the accumulation of mutations in subsites Aa and AC caused a minor alteration in subsite Ab (Fig. 2) . The frequency of single mar mutant isolation in site A was generally between 10e5 to 10e6 (Table 2) . When a second mutation was accumulated in another antigenic subsite, the isolation frequency was generally about lo-fold lower than for the first mutation. When the two first mutations were localized in subsites Ac/Aa or Ab/Aa, it was not possible to select triple mar mutants with changes accumulated in the three antigenie subsites (Table 2 ). In contrast, the char 1 B.B5- on the binding by MAb lA.FlO, specific for subsite AC. Each parental residue in the sequence was consecutively 1 D.E7 mutant selected with MAbs specific for subsites AC and Ab behaved like a triple mar mutant in the neutralization assays performed with subsite Aa-specific MAbs (Table 2) . MAb lE.F9 neutralized mar 1 B.H6 mutant (Fig. 1) . Other site Aa-specific MAbs did not neutralize mar 1 B.H6 mutant, indicating that the epitope recognized by MAb lE.F9 was different to the other epitopes of subsite Aa.\n\nAs an alternative approach, epitope scanning technology was applied to study the amino acids involved in site A. Only MAb 1 A.FlO (subsite AC) showed a specific binding pattern with synthetic peptides (Fig. 3A) . Two nonapeptides, which included amino acid 543, were recognized by MAb lA.FlO. To improve the observed binding, analysis of the optimum peptide length was performed using nona-to dodecapeptides.\n\nMaximum binding was obtained with the undecapeptide 537-MKRSGYGQPIA-547 (results not shown). The essential amino acids in this peptide were determined by studying the recognition of peptides with consecutive replacement of each amino acid in the native sequence by MAb lA.FlO (Fig. 3B) . The essential residues for binding were the first G (position 541) Y (position 542) and the second G (position 543). The R (position 539) S (position 540) Q (position 544) and I (position 546) could be replaced by a few amino acids, indicating that they also contribute to subsite AC. MAbs 1 B.B5, 6A.C3, and 1 A.FlO recognized antigenic subsite AC. MAb 1 B.B5 and 6A.C3 did not bind to the peptides recognized by MAb 1 A.Fl 0 (data not shown), indicating that they are specific for another epitope(s).\n\nSite B-specific MAbs have not neutralized TGEV infectivity (Sun& et a/., 1990) . Two procedures were used to select mutants in this site. The first method was to select virus variants that did not bind MAb 1 D.Bl2. Three mutants that did not bind MAb 1 D.Bl2 were selected (MAb nonbinding (manb) mutants). Stocks of TGEV PUR46-CCl20-MAD were enriched in the manb lD.Bl2 variants by binding wt virions with the MAb 1 D.Bl2 and depleting the virus-antibody complexes with S. aureus coated with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins. The manb mutants were detected by an in situ immunoscreening procedure using nitrocellulose filter replicas of infected monolayers, on which plaques were developed (Diez et al., 1989) . Both PUR46 wt and PUR46 manb 1 D.Bl2 mutants showed plaques. Only plaques caused by PUR46 wt were stained by MAb lD.Bl2, while all plaques were positive with MAb 3B.B6 specific for the N protein (results not shown). This results confirmed that manb 1 D.Bl2 mutants were not recognized by the MAb used in their selection. The second method used was to select mar mutants by neutralizing virus-antibody complexes with a second antibody against mouse immunoglobulins. TGEV was neutralized by site A-specific MAbs, but not by the MAbs specific for sites B, C (not shown), and D (Table 3) . Infectious virus-antibody complexes, made by binding site B-and D-specific MAbs to TGEV, were neutralized up to 1 O'.4-and 1 O'.\"-fold, respectively, by adding rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Table 3) . Two escape mutants were isolated with MAb 1 B.Hl 1 (site B) by u srng this approach: marl B.Hl l-l and marl B.Hl l-2 (Table 4 ). In contrast, site C-specific MAbs did not bind to native virus (see below) and mediated no neutralization by second antibody.\n\nSite B was previously localized within the first 325 N-terminal residues of the S protein . The sequence differences between the first 1600 nucleotides of the S-gene of TGEV wt and manb 1 D.Bl2 or 1 B.Hl 1 escaping mutants were determined by direct RNA sequencing. The three manb and one mar mutant had in common a change in residue 97 from Trp to Leu or Gly (Table 4) . A second mutation in residue 76 of manbl D.B12-1 was not observed in the other two 1 D-B1 2 mutants and probably represented an accompanying mutation. In the second mutant selected with MAb 1 B.Hl 1 (marl B.Hl l-2) residue 144 (Ser) was replaced by Leu. This datum indicates that this amino acid is part of site B.\n\nThe four mutants with an amino acid substitution at position 97 were recognized neither by MAbs 1 D.Bl2 nor by MAb 1 B.Hl 1, while the marl B.Hl l-2 mutant, with a change in residue 144, was recognized by MAb 1 D.Bl2 but not by MAb 1 B.Hl 1 (Fig. 4) . This indicates that the two MAbs see different but overlapping epitopes. The binding of MAb 8F.B3, site B-specific, to the five site B-escaping mutants was not affected by the changes in residues 97 and 144, indicating a third epitope within site B.\n\nTo determine which amino acids compose site C, consecutive overlapping nonapeptides derived from the sequence of the spike protein of TGEV (Rasschaert and Laude, 1987; Jacobs et a/., 1987) were tested in the PEPSCAN, as described above. The same two sets replaced by all 20 amino acids and plotted in alphabetical order of the one-letter code. This resulted in 11 sets of 20 peptide analogues for the indicated sequence. The MAb binding (diluted 1: 1000) was measured as the absorbance at 405 nm by an ELISA and was plotted vertically. The capital letters below the horizontal axis indicate the parental residues substituted. Boldface lines indicate the peptides with the native sequence. The dots indicate the values showing significative differences with the background. ' Neutralization index, defined as the log,,, of the ratio of the PFU after incubating the virus in the presence of medium or the MAb.\n\nb The antigenic sites were defined by cRlA using MAbs (Correa et al., 1988) .\n\n' Undiluted supernatants (50 ~1) from hybridoma cultures were mixed with one volume of PBS containing 1 O5 PFU of TGEV (PUR46) and 2% FCS. The neutralization assay was performed as described under Materials and Methods.\n\nd Neutralization in the presence of a second antibody was performed by incubating the virus at 37\" for 15 min in presence of the MAb, adding 0.5 vol of a dilution of 1 :lO of rabbit antiserum specific for mouse immunoglobulins and incubating at 37\" for 15 min. of nonapeptides were recognized by MAbs 6A.A6 and 5B.Hl (Figs. 5A and 58). Each nested set had a common core sequence of 49-Pro-Asn-Ser-Asp-52 and 165-Ser-Asn-Ser-Glu-168, respectively (Fig. 5C ). Both sequences shared the motif Asn-Ser followed by an acidic residue (Asp or Glu). The binding of the two MAbs to nonapeptides located between positions 49 to 52 was much higher than to the peptides located between residues 165 and 168 (Figs. 5A and 58).\n\nIn competitive RIA at physiological pH and temperature, virus in solution inhibited the binding of site A specific MAbs to virus coated wells, but did not inhibit the binding of site C specific MAbs (Fig. 6) . This indicated that site C was not exposed on the surface of native TGEV. Site C becomes exposed when purified TGEV is bound to plastic plates, or after treatment with detergents, since in direct RIA, purified virus binds site C-specific MAbs (Correa eta/., 1988 (Correa eta/., , 1990 . Site C was also exposed when virions were partially denatured at pHs 11 to 13 (Fig. 6A) . This treatment had almost no effect on the relative antigenicity of site A, and caused a 30-fold decrease in virus infectivity (Fig. 6A ). Incubation of TGEV at temperatures ranging from 45 to 95\" increased the relative exposure of site C. In contrast, the binding of site A-specific MAbs decreased after incubating at 40\" and was 1 O-fold lower after heating the virus 5 min at 95\" (Fig. 6B ).\n\nSite D Two mar mutants were selected using site D-specific MAb 1 D.G3, by neutralizing the virus-antibody complex with a second antibody against mouse immunoglobulins (Table 3) . Direct sequencing of an RNA segment (from nucleotide 1000 to 1600) coding for the protein fragment where site D was previously located ' Nucleotide sequence differences were determined by direct RNA sequencing of genome segments on which antigenic sites were previously located .\n\nb All the mutants were derived from PUR46-CC120-MAD strain of TGEV (Sanchez era/., 1990) . ' The MAb nonbinding (manb) mutants were isolated as described in the text by depleting the parental virus stock from virions that bound MAb 1 D.Bl2. S. aureus coated with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins was used to remove the virus-MAb complex, (100). Escape mutants were named according to the MAb used in their selection. The manb mutants were selected by depleting the virions recognized by MAb 1 D.Bl2. The mar mutants were resistant to the neutralization of the virus-MAb complex by rabbit serum anti-mouse immunoglobulins. The specificity of the MAbs is named according to Correa et al. (1988) . White, hatched, and black squares represent relative bindings between: 0 to 19, 20 to 40, and 41 to 100, respectively. ND, not determined. MolV, Moloney leukemia virus. MHV, mouse hepatitis virus. (Correa eta/., 1990 ) revealed a nucleotide difference at position 1153 between the mutants mar 1 D.G3-1 and -2, and the wt virus. The nucleotide difference results in a Gly to Ser change at position 385 (Table 4) . Antigenie characterization of both mutants using a collection of MAbs showed (Fig. 4 ) that they were recognized by all MAbs tested, with the exception of the MAb used in the selection (1 D.G3). The other site D-specific MAb (8D.H8) recognized both mutants, indicating that MAb 8D.H8 is specific for an epitope distinct from the one recognized by MAb 1 D.G3.\n\nThe antigenicity of sites A, B, C, and D of the spike protein was tested after partial or complete deglycosylation of the S protein from mature TGEV with endoglycosidase H or protein N-glycosidase F, respectively, and after inhibiting the glycosylation during virus formation with tunicamycin. Endoglycosidase H partially removed carbohydrates on the S protein yielding a glycoprotein of about 170 kDa which was antigenic for MAbs specific for all sites (data not shown). Protein-Nglycosidase F removed carbohydrates from SDS-denatured S-protein down to undetectable levels, as determined by labeling the glycoprotein with [3H]glucosamine and autoradiography (results not shown). The deglycosylated S protein was the same size as the apoprotein as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7A) , and was recognized by MAbs specific for sites A, B, C, and D, although sites A and B were less reactive (Fig. 7A) .\n\nTo study the effect of intracellular glycosylation ST cells were infected with TGEV in the presence of tunicamycin. At a tunicamycin concentration of 5 pg/ml, the glycosylation of the S protein was inhibited completely (results not shown). S protein was not detected in the culture medium. S protein isolated from the intracellular pool formed aggregates, as indicated by its low mobility during SDS-PAGE even after boiling in the presence of 2.5% SDS and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol ( Fig. 7B and results not shown) . This S-protein was recognized by site C-MAbs an to a lesser extent by site D-specific MAbs. These data indicate that sites C and D are completely or partially independent of glycosylation, respectively. In contrast, MAbs specific for sites A and B did not recognize unglycosilated S protein (even when the electrophoresis was performed in the presence of 0.1% SDS and in the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol) indicating that these sites are fully dependent on glycosylation for proper folding.\n\nIn this study, the analysis of TGEV mutants selected by MAbs, and PEPSCAN, have contributed to an accurate localization of the antigenic sites A, B, C, and D of the S glycoprotein. Peptides representing antigenic determinants of sites A and C have been defined. In addition, antigenic sites have been characterized in terms of surface exposure and the relative importance of glycosylation.\n\nIn order to map residues associated to different antigenie sites, the segments of the S gene coding for the protein regions, where different antigenic sites were previously localized the complete S gene of parental virus and mar mutant 1 D.E7 has been sequenced.\n\nSite A Site A is located on the surface of TGEV and is dependent on intracellular glycosylation. With one exception all mutants mapping at site A had a single nucleotide difference with the parental virus. This change was most probably responsible for the virus escaping from MAb neutralization. In other viral systems, single nucleotide differences have also been found to be responsible for escape from neutralization (Vandepol et al., 1986; Taniguchi et al., 1988; Wiegers et al., 1990) . In the mar 1 B.B5 mutant, and in those variants derived from this virus, two nucleotide differences were detected which caused amino acid changes in residues 543 and 631 (Table 1) . The change at position 543 is probably responsible for the escape from MAb 1 B.B5, since MAb 1 A.FlO, which maps to the same antigenic subsite, binds peptides including amino acid 543 ( Fig.  3 and results not shown) . The change affecting residue 631 could be an accompanying mutation, although its contribution to the epitope lB.B5 cannot be discounted. Site A contains three subsites, Aa, Ab, and AC, which are sensitive to substitutions on the residues 538, 591, and 543, respectively. In addition, residue 586 affects both subsites Aa and Ab. These data show that site A is complex and that it is formed by residues located in distal segments of the S glycoprotein. This seems to be the most frequent situation in epitopes from other systems studied in detail (site B reported in this manuscript; DiMarchi et al., 1986; Parry et a/., 1989; Davies et al., 1988; Posthumus et al., 1990; Wiegers et al., 1990) . Although we have defined precise amino acids contributing to the different antigenic sites, the participation of other residues to the antigenicity of the subsites is not excluded.\n\nPeptide 537-MKRSGYGQPIA-547, recognized by MAb 1 A.FlO, could represent at least a portion of the antigenic subsite AC. This peptide may be of importance for diagnosis and protection, since epitope 1 A.FlO is located in subsite AC, which is conserved in coronaviruses of three species (Sanchez et al., 1990) .\n\nOur data on site A are in agreement with the data of Delmas et al. (1990) who found MAb-selected mutations at positions 549 and 586. A complete demarcation of the complex site A must await elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the spike protein.\n\nSite B is dependent on intracellular glycosylation and is complex and conformation-dependent. This site is TEMPERATURE, \"C FIG. 6. Effect of the pH and temperature on the relative surface exposure of antigenic sites A and C. Purified TGEV was incubated at different pH (at 4\") (A) or temperature (B). Dilutions of the virus were used to inhibit the binding of site A-(6A.C3) and C (GA.AG)-specific MAbs to TGEV-coated plates (0.25 rglwell) in a cRIA, as described previously (Correa et al., 1988) . A binding inhibition curve was obtained for each viral sample after different incubations. The percentage of binding inhibition by 5 pg of virus per well was divided by ten and taken as the relative exposure of the sites. After each treatment the residual infectivity was determined in a plaque assay on ST cells. formed by at least three epitopes. Two of these epitopes (lD.Bl2 and lB.Hll) are overlapping, since both include amino acid Trp at position 97 in their formation. Sequence analysis of mutants indicated that residues 97 and 144 (Table 4 ) are part of site B. Although site B is conformation dependent, MAbs specific for this site can bind TGEV S-glycoprotein by immunoblotting providing that the samples were not treated with 2-mercaptoethanol. Most probably, renaturation of S protein occurs during the blotting of the protein to nitrocellulose paper. Recently, we used a new approach to characterize conformation-dependent epitopes (Lenstra et al., 1991) . Using MAb lD.Bl2, we screened a bacterial pEX expression library of hybrid proteins that consist of P-galactosidase and random hexapeptides. Sequencing of antigenic clones revealed the sequence: -ANSRPRWMKL-(bold residues were expressed by the variable insert of the plasmid). This sequence mimics the epitope of MAb 1 D.Bl2 and may be considered a site B-mimotope (Geysen et al., 1984) . The three underlined residues are also found in the S protein sequence 102-&@HN&/T-96, suggesting that residues 97, 100, and 102 may be part of site B. These residues might have been displayed in a correct spatial conformation, which mimics the native site, by the contiguous residues present in the mimotope. The serine in position 144 also contributes to site B, since it is changed in the mar 1 B.Hl 1 mutant (Table 4 ). It is tempting to speculate that the serine present in the mimotope (-ANSRPRWMKL-) replaces the serine in position 144 of the parental virus. 8 . Summary of the amino acids contributing to the antigenic sites of the S glycoprotein of two clones of the PUR46 strain of TGEV, and of the properties of the antigenic sites. The diagram shows the position of the residues involved in the formation of the antigenic sites of two clones of the PUR46 virus with a common origen (Bohl, 1972) . The antigenic sites were defined by competitive binding assays with MAbs and named according to Correa et Delmas et al. (1990) ; and (d) Sanchez et al. (1990) . A site was defined as conserved (+) if at least part of it was present in most of the isolates. Sites with a minor presence or which were completely absent in certain isolates were referred as + or -. of the virus with 2.5% SDS and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol ( Fig. 7 ; Correa et a/., 1990); (ii) it is represented by synthetic nonapeptides derived from TGEV S-glycoprotein (Fig. 5) ; (iii) it is present in recombinant products expressed in bacteria, which do not reconstitute the native S protein (Correa eta/., 1990) ; and (iv) it is formed in the absence of glycosylation (Fig. 7) . Since nonapeptides with the sequence (-P-P-N-S-D-V-) are strongly bound by MAbs 5B.Hll and 6A.A6 under denaturing conditions, this peptide can be used as a reporter to control the expression of the spike protein gene or other heterologous genes. In addition, because binding and sequencing studies indicate that site C is not present in the respiratory variants of TGEV (Sanchez et a/., 1990); C. M. Sanchez and L. Enjuanes, unpublished results) , this peptide could be useful to discriminate serum from TGEV or PRCV infected animals.\n\naminoacid of site C, since it is the only residue conserved in the 12 peptides recognized by epitope scanning (Fig. 5 ) and in six mimotopes (Lenstra eta/., 1991) .\n\nSite C is not exposed on native virus, as determined by cRlA (Fig. 6 ). This agrees with: (i) the absence of this site on the surface of TGEV-infected cells, as determined by immunofluorescence or antibody-dependent complement-mediated cell lysis (Laviada et al., 1990) and (ii) the lack of detection of this site by immuneelectron microscopy with gold-labeled MAbs (C. Sun& M. V. Nermut, J. L. Carrascosa, and L. Enjuanes, unpublished results). In contrast, the antigenic sites A, B, and D were detected on the surface of infected cells and on whole virions.\n\nThe sequence of the linear site C deduced by PEP-\n\nThe glycine (G) residue at position 385 was found to SCAN (P-P/S-N-S-D/E-V/A) strongly resembles the sebe essential for the epitope of site D-specific MAb quence of the mimotopes P-P/S-N/H-S-D/E-A selected 1 D.G3 (Table 4 ). The other site D-specific MAb 8D.H8 by site C-specific MAbs from the random-sequence recognized both mutants selected by MAb 1 D.G3 ( 4). Epitope 8D.H8 has previously been localized within Serine (S) at position 5 1 is probably the most essential the residues 387 to 392 by PEPSCAN analysis (Post-humus et al., 1990) . Our data indicate that site D has at least two different epitopes. In the study reported by it has been shown that other site D-specific MAbs recognized peptides consisting of the residues 381 to 387 and 378 to 386. The location of the site D within the 378 to 392 region agrees with work reported by Delmas et a/. (1990) . They found substitutions of the residues 383 (Ser) and 384 (Tyr) with escape mutants selected by their MAbs specific for an antigenic site homologous to site D. Glycosylation does not appear to be essential for keeping antigenicity at this site when the S protein purified from ensambled virus was analyzed (Fig. 7) .\n\nAntigenic structure of TGEV Comparison of the residues involved in the antigenic sites of the S glycoprotein of two clones of the PUR46 strain of TGEV (Fig. 8) , one clone (PUR46-CC120-MA-DRID) studied by our group (Correa et al., 1988  this study) and another clone (PUR46-CC115-PARIS) studied by Delmas et al. (1990) have shown that sites A, B, and D are located within the same regions of the S protein. Site C was only identified by our group, probably because this site is not exposed in native virions.\n\nIn vitro tests, using swine testis cells, indicate that antigenic sites A and D are the major inducers of neutralizing antibodies. The residues that contribute to these sites have been conserved in enteric and respiratory strains of TGEV (PUR46-CC120-MADRID, PUR46-CC1 15-PARIS, PUR46-115~UTRECHT, MIL65, the British isolate FS772/70), and in feline infectious peritonitis virus (based on sequence data: Rasschaert er a/., 1987; Jacobs et a/., 1987; Wesley, 1990 , Britton et a/., 1990 F. Gebauer, C. M. Sgnchez, and L. Enjuanes, unpublished data) . This suggests that these residues must be important for the replication of viruses of the TGEV group (SBnchez eta/., 1990). However, they may not be relevant for the protection in viva against coronaviruses, since antigenic variation would generate the same or similar substitutions to those observed in our mutants. We are currently testing the potential use of the antigenic peptides for diagnosis and protection."}
