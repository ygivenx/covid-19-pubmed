{"title": "Supplemental Information Cellular 5\uf0a2-3\uf0a2 mRNA Exonuclease Xrn1 Controls Double-Stranded RNA Accumulation and Anti-Viral Responses", "body": "NHDFs in 6-well dishes were labeled for 30 min. in 1 ml per well of methionine and cysteine-free DMEM containing 77 \u00b5Ci of a [ 35 S]methionine-cysteine mixture (Amersham). Total cellular protein was subsequently solubilized in 250 \u00b5l sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 10% glycerol, 2.5% !-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE.\n\nLabeled proteins were visualized by exposing the fixed, dried gel to X-ray film.\n\nSamples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid to measure 35 S met/cys incorporation into protein. Acid insoluble radioactivity was collected onto glass microfiber filters, and counted in Cystoscint solution (Acros). Statistical significance was determined by paired Student's t-tests between samples using Microsoft Excel.\n\nRNA was extracted from cells using Trizol (Life Technologies) and DNase I (NEB) treated according to manufacturer's instructions. 500 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using qScript cDNA Supermix (Quanta Biosciences #95048) according to manufacturer instructions. PCR amplifications were performed using a BIO-RAD iQ iCycler. The following primer sets were used for qPCR analysis: 18s (fw: AGGAATTGACGGAAGGGCACCA rev: TTATCGGAATTAACCAGACAAATCG); K3L (fw: GTTATTCGTTGCCCAATGCG"}
