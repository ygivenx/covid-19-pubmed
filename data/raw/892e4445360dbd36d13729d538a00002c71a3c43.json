{"title": "Anatomical distribution of avian bornavirus in parrots, its occurrence in clinically healthy birds and ABV-antibody detection", "body": "Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) is a fatal dis-order of birds and a major threat to endangered parrot populations (Lublin et al., 2006; Doneley et al., 2007) , including one of the world's most endangered bird species, the Spix's macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii). It is characterized by dilatation of the proventriculus, diges-tive malfunction, and cachexia. Definitive diagnosis depends on histologic demonstration of lymphocytic infiltrates in the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves and myenteric ganglia (Lutz & Wilson, 1991; Vice, 1992; Gregory, 1995; Sullivan et al., 1997; Gregory et al., 1998; Berhane et al., 2001; Lierz, 2005; Lublin et al., 2006; Perpi\u00f1 an et al., 2007) . A viral aetiology of PDD has been presumed (Gough et al., 1996; Gregory et al., 1998) and several viruses were proposed, including adenovirus, coronavirus, herpesvirus, polyomavirus, eastern equine encephalitis virus and western equine encephalitis virus (Mannl et al., 1987; Sullivan et al., 1997; Vice, 1992; Gregory, 1995; Gregory et al., 1998; Grund et al., 2002; Gough et al., 2006; Lublin et al., 2006; Orosz & Dahlhausen, 2007) ; however, none was confirmed and most recently avian paramyxovirus 1 was ruled out (Deb et al., 2008) . A leading candidate only emerged when two independent research groups recently identified a novel avian bornavirus (ABV) in PDD-affected birds (Honkavuori et al., 2008; Kistler et al., 2008) . In one study of US parrots, 3/3 (100%) animals with PDD, and 0/4 (0%) without PDD, had ABV in brain, proventricu-lus and adrenal gland (Honkavuori et al., 2008) . In the other study, ABV was detected in 5/8 (62.5%) PDD birds from the US and 5/7 (71%) such birds from Israel, but not in non-diseased controls (5 and 14 birds, respec-tively) (Kistler et al., 2008) . Both studies showed less than 70% nucleotide conservation of the avian sequences to those of the mammalian Borna disease virus (BDV), and indicated that these viruses represent a novel species with multiple divergent genotypes, possibly forming a separate genus (Honkavuori et al., 2008; Kistler et al., 2008) . In a subsequent report, ABV was described in six parrots in Europe with clinical PDD symptoms, in which ABV was not restricted to cells of the nervous system and the presence of ABV in the faeces led the authors to propose a possible faecal-oral transmission route (Rinder et al., 2009 ). In the same study, seven birds with clinical signs of PDD were tested negative. Bornavirus infection has been previously proposed for an outbreak of neurologic disease in ostriches based on serologic data (Malkinson et al., 1993) . Bornavirus sequences have also been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in mallard (Anas plathyrhnchus) and jackdaw (Corvus monedula) droppings (Berg et al., 2001) ; however, in these instances viral sequences were closely related to those of mammalian BDV and distinct from the recently identified ABV. A reservoir for ABV, its geographic distribution, modes of transmission, and causative relationship to PDD remain to be determined.\n\nAnimals and samples. In a parrot collection from a private breeder in Germany, consisting of 61 birds, two male salmon-crested cockatoos (Cacatua moluccensis) were euthanized (Z178/08) or died with PDD-like symptoms (Z1/09) within a period of 2 months. Z178/08 demonstrated wasting symptoms and shedding of undigested seeds in faeces before it was euthanized. From this bird a crop biopsy free of lymphoplasma-cytic ganglioneuritis, taken 2 weeks prior to death, was also available for investigation. Z1/09, kept in the neighbouring cage of Z178/08, died of ulcerative enteritis but no evidence of nutritional compromise. Tissue samples, blood and cloacal swabs from both birds were collected for histological and molecular biological investigations (see Table 1 ). For molecular biological analysis, tissues were placed immediately after sampling into RNAlater (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and stored within 2 h after sampling at \u2212808C until processing.\n\nOther samples included cloacal swabs of the remaining 59 unaffected, clinically healthy birds in the same collection, and from 39 healthy birds in two different collections in the same geographic area of Germany that had not experienced any PDD cases in the past 6 years (control group). Swabs were processed within 3 h after sampling as described below. In several cases, serum samples were obtained and stored frozen at \u2212208C until investigated.\n\nLaser-capture microdissection. Samples of nerves, nerve ganglia, stroma and glandular structures of the proventriculus and adrenal gland of Z1/ 09 were isolated by laser-capture microdissection (LCM), using 8-mm-thick frozen sections mounted on glass slides covered with polyethylene naphthalate membrane (PALM Microlaser Technologies, Bernried, Germany) (Klopfleisch & Gruber, 2009 ). The size of the excised tissue sections ranged from 1.4 \u00d7 10 4 to 3.0 \u00d7 10 4 m 2 . The isolated tissue pieces were laser pressure catapulted into caps of 0.5-ml reaction tubes containing 40 ml lysis buffer (Nucleo Spin RNA XS; Macherey & Nagel, D\u00fc ren, Germany) and stored at \u2212808C.\n\nQuantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. RNA was extracted from tissue samples using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and from cloacal swabs dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen). Extraction of LCM samples was performed using the NucleoSpin kit (Macherey-Nagel). ABV-specific RNA was detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reac-tion (RT-qPCR) with primer-probe sets 1367 or 1034/1322 that match different ABV strains (Honkavuori et al., 2008) . Tissue samples from Z178/08 were investigated using both primer sets; for all other samples, primer set 1034/1322 was used. All PCRs were carried out with the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Threshold cycle (C t ) values > 36 were scored negative, as determined using serial cloned standard dilutions (Honkavuori et al., 2008) .\n\nSequence determination and analysis. Phylogenetic sequence analysis was performed using a 724-base-pair fragment spanning the C-terminal end of the N gene, and the N-terminal part of the P gene (GenBank accession numbers FJ770253, FJ932550, and FJ932551). Selected PCR products were size-fractionated on agarose gels, purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit; Qiagen), and directly dideoxy-sequenced in both directions with ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kits on ABI PRISM DNA Analyzers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA). Sequences were assembled and analysed using programs of the Wisconsin GCG Package (Accelrys, San Diego, California, USA). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using www.phy-logeny.fr (Dereeper et al., 2008) , applying T-coffee for alignment (Notredame et al., 2003) , Gblocks 0.91 b for curation (Castresana, 2000) , and PhyML 3.0 for phylogenetic reconstruction (Guindon & Gascuel, 2003) ; all with standard settings.\n\nWestern blot analysis. ABV proteins P (strain 1322, Genbank accession number FJ169441; 30 kDa, including tag and vector sequence) and N (strain 1367, Genbank accession number FJ169440; 49 kDa, including tag and vector sequence) were expressed in prokaryotic systems (pDest17 Gateway vector; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) and purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA-Agarose (Qiagen). In addition, P (24 kDa) and N (40 kDa) of mammalian BDV were analysed in comparison (Briese et al., 1995) . Protein concentrations were estimated by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA), and 100 ng each protein in Laemmli buffer were boiled for 5 min and size-fractionated by discontinuous 4 to 15% gradient sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Laemmli & Favre, 1973) . Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and blocked with 2% non-fat dry milk in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) overnight at room temperature (Towbin et al., 1979) . Membranes were incubated with bird sera (1:1000 in TTBS) for 1 h at room temperature; washed three times with TTBS, and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-bird immunoglobulin (1:2000 in TTBS; Bethyl Laboratories, Montgom-ery, Texas, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TTBS, the membranes were developed using the ECL western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, Illinois, USA) and scanned for chemiluminescence using a Storm 840 imager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, California, USA).\n\nClinically affected birds. Post-mortem tissue samples as well as plasma and a cloacal swab from each of two birds, Z178/08 and Z1/09, were collected and analysed by RT-qPCR. The euthanized Bird Z178/08 was ema-ciated and had an enlarged thin-walled proventriculus filled with feed. Histological examination revealed lym-phocytic infiltrates in the epicardial ganglia, the Purkinje fibres, ventriculus, proventriculus (indicating PDD), crop, ischiatic nerve and less pronounced in brain. No abnormalities were found in the adrenals, cloaca, or intestine. All tissues, including those where no histologic abnormalities were found, as well as the plasma and cloacal swab were positive for ABV RNA (Table 1) , suggesting a viraemia. A crop biopsy taken 2 weeks prior to death, which showed no histologic abnormality, was also positive (C t =24.7, primer set 1034/1322). Bird Z1/ 09 had an enlarged proventriculus filled with feed and adhesions consistent with slight peritonitis. Histopatho-logical examination revealed a lymphocytic encephalitis and adrenalitis. Nerve tissue from the heart, proventri-culus, intestine, crop, liver and spleen was not affected, demonstrating that the bird did not suffer from PDD. The intestine showed severe ulcerative enteritis in con-junction with acute purulent peritonitis as the cause of death. Viral burden was lower than in Z178/08 and measured in the two tissues with lymphocytic infiltrates, the cerebrum and adrenal gland, and also in the proventriculus, ventriculus and duodenum, but was absent in the crop, liver, pancreas, cloacal swab and blood (Table 1) .\n\nTwo sets of nerve ganglia tissue obtained by LCM from the proventriculus of Bird Z1/09 yielded a positive PCR signal (C t =35.24/34.93), whereas two sets each of stroma and glandular tissue were negative. LCM samples of the adrenal gland revealed a positive signal from two sets of nerve ganglia tissue (C t =33.94/31.93); six sam-ples of inter-renal and chromaffin portions with diffuse infiltrations by lymphocytes and plasma cells were negative.\n\nClinical healthy birds. Nineteen out of 59 parrots (32.2%) from the same aviary as the two dead birds had ABV-RNA in their cloacal swabs ( Table 2 ). The presence of ABV was not correlated with age, sex or cage location, including cases with positive and negative birds in the same cage. Positive birds were distributed across all age groups (juvenile to 20 years old). No ABV-positive cloacal swabs were detected in any of 39 birds from two PDD-free independent aviaries located in the same geographic area (Table 2) .\n\nPCR detection of ABV RNA in healthy contacts was corroborated by western blot analysis. A healthy Hispa-niolan Amazon (Amazona ventralis, Z14/09-13; C t =19.7; Table 2 ) and a healthy lesser sulphur crested cockatoo (Cacatua sulphurea parvula, Z14/09-05; C t =24.9; Table 2 ) both showed a similar antibody response when compared with PDD-affected Bird Z178/08 (Figure 1) . A strong reaction to ABV N with limited cross-reactivity to BDV N was noted; reaction to the P antigen appeared to be weaker and more variable.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis. Samples obtained from the crop, cerebellum, and proventriculus of Bird Z178/08 re-vealed no sequence variation (GenBank accession number FJ770253). The same was true for the sequence obtained from the brain and gizzard of Bird Z1/09 (GenBank accession number FJ932550). Comparison with four mammalian BDV isolates from horses in Germany and three ABV, for which sequence in the respective genome region is available, grouped strain Z178/08 and Z1/09 sequences (100% sequence identity) in the ABV clade and clearly separate from German horse BDV (Figure 2 ). Strains Z178/08 and Z1/09 from Germany were phylogenetically more similar to strain 1034/1322 from the USA, than were strains 1034/1322 and bil from the USA to one another. Almost identical sequences were also obtained from cloacal swabs of healthy PCR-positive contacts, Bird Z14/09-13 (100% identical to Z178/08 and Z1/09) and Z14/09-28 (97% identical to Z178/08 and Z1/09, GenBank accession number FJ932551; Figure 2 ).\n\nBorna disease, a neurological syndrome of ungulates due to infection with BDV, has been endemic in Germany for more than a century (Ludwig et al., 1988; Lipkin & Briese, 2007) . Although cross-species transfer between ungulate and bird has been achieved experimentally (Ludwig et al., 1988) , its occurrence in nature is unclear. Furthermore, Borna disease of ungulates is not recorded in the USA or Israel despite the presence of a novel Bornavirus in PDD-affected birds in both countries (Honkavuori et al., 2008; Kistler et al., 2008) . These observations together with the phylogenetic distance between ABV and mammalian BDV strains suggest that, if it occurs, cross-species infection appears to be an uncommon event.\n\nAlthough ABV represents a plausible aetiologic can-didate for PDD (Honkavuori et al., 2008; Kistler et al., 2008; Rinder et al., 2009) , much of its biology remains to be characterized. In the present study we confirmed the presence of ABV in two birds from the same collection in Germany. Whereas Bird Z178/08 had classical symp-toms, gross lesions and histological alterations of PDD, Bird Z1/09 did not have a clinical presentation consistent with PDD. Despite having a characteristic proventricular enlargement, Bird Z1/09 lacked typical lymphocytic infiltrates in nerve ganglia of the digestive tract. Similarly, whereas ABV-RNA was demonstrated in all organs and even in plasma of the PDD-affected Bird Z178/08, ABV RNA was restricted to nerve tissue in non-PDD Bird Z1/09, consistent with the pattern of BDV infection found in immunocompetent mammals (Ludwig et al., 1988; Briese et al., 1999) . However, it remains obscure why the lymphoplasmacytic ganglio-neuritis was not detectable in all organs positive for ABV in Bird Z178/08 and also missing in the proventriculus of Bird Z1/09 despite the fact that ABV was detected in the nerve ganglia of this organ. Rinder et al. (2009) also found ABV extension beyond neural tissues. It is conceivable that early infection or carrier status is characterized by confinement to nerve tissue and that wider distribution only occurs in the late stages of PDD. The presence in healthy birds of ABV RNA in cloacal swabs in association with ABV-specific serum antibodies, which was demonstrated in the present study for the first time, indicates either that ABV is not causally related to PDD or that disease is multifactorial. Differentiating these possibilities awaits formal testing of Koch's postulates. Although shedding of infectious virus remains to be demonstrated, this finding is consistent with a possible transmission mode by subclinical individuals, especially as birds of collections not facing PDD were tested ABV negative.\n\nTaken together our results support previous concerns regarding the reliability of histological examination of crop biopsies (Gregory et al., 1996; Berhane et al., 2001) as the recommended method for PDD screening (Sullivan et al., 1997) ; Bird Z178/08 tested negative by crop biopsy 2 weeks prior euthanasia due to clinical PDD. The applied RT-qPCR presents an adequate diagnostic addition, although an individual diagnosis based on cloacal swab alone may fail as indicated by Bird Z1/09; despite the presence of ABV in brain and adrenal gland, the cloacal swab tested negative. None-theless, a cloacal-oral route of transmission is plausible. Furthermore, the observation that ABV sequences can be detected in cloacal swabs by PCR offers the prospect for efficient non-invasive surveillance and diagnosis. Until larger data-sets become available, collection of biopsy and cloacal swab for histologic as well as RT-qPCR analyses is recommended for PDD/ABV diagnosis in psittacine birds. Furthermore, ABV-antibody detection by western blot analysis may prove useful in diagnosis as well as a screening tool, especially when screening flocks in conjunction with ABV-RNA detec-tion in cloacal swabs. Sera from PDD-affected Bird Z178/08, asymptomatic ABV PCR-positive Birds Z14/09-13 and Z14/09-05, and healthy PCR-negative Bird Z14/09-47, were evaluated by western blot analysis using recombinant ABV P and N, as well as BDV P and N (p23, p40), demonstrating a strong reaction to ABV N with limited cross-reactivity to BDV N.
