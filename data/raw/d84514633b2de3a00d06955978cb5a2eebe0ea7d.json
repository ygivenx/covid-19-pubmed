{"title": "Supplemental material", "body": ". While N-BAR generates membrane tubules, Amph-FL forms highly curved fission vesicles. GUV membrane composition: 79.5 mol% DOPC, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 15 mol% DOPS, and 0.5 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE. Membrane composition in TEM experiments: 80 mol% DOPC, 5 mol% Ptd-Ins(4,5)P 2 , and 15 mol% DOPS, extruded to 200 nm. SUP ER template membrane composition: 79 mol% DOPC, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 15 mol% DOPS, and 1 mol% Texas Red-DHPE. Membrane composition in tethered vesicle experiments: 76 mol% DOPC, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 15 mol% DOPS, 2 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE, and 2 mol% DP-EG10-biotin, extruded to 200 nm. (A) Representative spinning disc confocal micrographs of GUVs after exposure to 5 \u00b5M of either N-BAR (left) or Amph-FL (right). Top: Tubules are visible after less than 10 min of incubating GUVs with protein. Bottom: After more than 1 h, Amph-FL transformed GUVs into small membrane fragments (indicated by red arrowheads) diffusing rapidly in solution. See Video 5. (B) Two representative electron micrographs of tubules generated by 26 \u00b5M N-BAR. Dashed boxes indicate zoomed regions to the right of each image. Black arrows indicate tubules. Bars, including insets, 200 nm. (C) Histogram of tubule outer diameters generated by 26 \u00b5M N-BAR. Mean = 44 \u00b1 6 nm first SD; n = 323 tubules. (D) Two representative electron micrographs of fission vesicles generated by 5 \u00b5M Amph-FL. Dashed boxes indicate zoomed regions to the right of each image. Red arrowheads indicate fission vesicles. Bars, including insets, 200 nm. (E) SUP ER template membrane release experiment comparing Amph-FL and ENTH domain. Dots indicate individual trials and lines indicate the mean of n = 3 trials. (F) Top left: Vesicles after exposure to 300 nM of N-BAR, also shown in Fig. 2 B. Top middle: After detecting puncta using cmeAnalysis (marked with green circles), some large or asymmetric puncta (indicated by red arrows) are included, which may represent tubules. Top right: After applying an extra criterion that excludes puncta greater than 30 pixels in size, the large puncta are no longer included. Left histograms: Vesicle diameter distributions before applying pixel size criterion (same distributions shown in Fig. 2 , C-E). Right histograms: Vesicle diameter distributions after applying pixel size criterion. No substantial shifts in vesicle diameter distribution are apparent after excluding large puncta, suggesting that nondiffraction-limited objects are not substantially shifting the distributions. (G) Two representative spinning disc confocal micrographs of tethered vesicles before exposure to protein (left) and after exposure to 5 \u00b5M N-BAR (right). Tubules indicated by white arrows. Bars, 2 \u00b5m. Figure S2 . Membrane coverage measurements of N-BAR, Amph-FL, and Amph CTD \u0394SH3, and FCS of Amph CTD \u0394H3. Tethered vesicle composition for N-BAR and Amph-FL: 76 mol% DOPC, 15 mol% DOPS, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 2 mol% DP-EG10-biotin, and 2 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE. In experiments with Amph CTD \u0394SH3, DOPS and PtdIns(4,5)P 2 were replaced by 20 mol% DOGS-NTA-Ni. GUV membrane composition: 79.5 mol% DOPC, 20 mol% DOGS-NTA-Ni, and 0.5 mol% Texas Red-DHPE. (A) Images of 200-nm-extruded tethered vesicles (green, left column) and membrane-bound Amph-FL-Atto 594 (red, right column). Top row is 10 nM; bottom row is 25 nM. Images in each column have equal contrast to show that increasing protein concentration leads to increased membrane-bound protein intensity. Bars, 2 \u00b5m. (B) Raw protein intensity as a function of raw vesicle intensity for 10 and 25 nM Amph-FL. (C) The same data in B after processing (see Materials and methods), plotted as the number of membrane-bound proteins as a function of vesicle diameter. See Fig. 2 , G and H, for membrane coverage data collected using this approach. (D) Membrane binding experiments with the isolated disordered domains of amphiphysin (Amph CTD \u0394SH3) and epsin (epsin CTD). Neither disordered domain shows detectable binding to membranes containing PtdIns(4,5)P 2 and phosphatidylserine (PS) used in membrane fission studies. (E-G) Representative, normalized FCS traces of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 (E), AP180 CTD (F), and transferrin (G). Blue dots indicate data; black lines indicate fit (see Materials and methods). Average values of diffusion time, \u03c4 D , \u00b1 first SD are shown next to each trace, with n = 10, 5, and 3 FCS traces for Amph CTD \u0394SH3, AP180 CTD, and transferrin, respectively. The hydrodynamic radius, R H , of each protein is also shown next to each trace. R H of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 was computed by scaling from the known R H of AP180 CTD (Busch et al., 2015 ; see Materials and methods). Using this same approach yields an R H of transferrin that is similar to its expected value (Hall et al., 2002) . (H) Relative diffusion times of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 in buffer with 10, 150, and 1,000 mM NaCl, expressed as the proportion of the average diffusion time at 150 mM NaCl. The data indicate a transition from an extended to a more compact state with increasing ionic strength, as expected for charged disordered proteins (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . Diffusion times were corrected for changes in solution viscosity with varying NaCl concentration (Zhang and Han, 1996) . Red dots indicate data; black lines indicate mean. n = 5 FCS traces at each NaCl concentration. (I) GUV experiments with 6his peptide. The peptide bound to GUVs but did not drive membrane remodeling. GUV fluorescence from Texas Red-DHPE lipid; peptide fluorescence from Atto 488 label. (J) Images of 200-nm-extruded tethered vesicles (green, left column) and membrane-bound Amph CTD \u0394SH3-Atto 594 (red, right column). Top row is 1 \u00b5M; bottom row is 2 \u00b5M. Images in each column have equal contrast to show greater protein intensity with increasing concentration. Bars, 2 \u00b5m. (K) Raw protein intensity as a function of raw vesicle intensity for the 1 \u00b5M Amph CTD \u0394SH3 dataset. (L) The same 1 \u00b5M Amph CTD \u0394SH3 dataset after processing, plotted as the area occupied by membrane-bound proteins as a function of vesicle surface area. The slope of a linear fit to the data represents the average membrane coverage by proteins. See Number of tubes per cell as a function of protein expression level, quantified as the background-subtracted protein intensity in the cytosol 1 \u00b5m above the plasma membrane (see Materials and methods). The plot is similar to Fig. 4 C, which plots protein expression level on the x-axis as the protein intensity at the plasma membrane. Lines indicate linear regression with y-intercept set to 0. Shaded regions indicate 99% CI. Line color matches the respective marker color. (C) Relative binding of proteins to the plasma membrane, quantified as the ratio of the average protein intensity in the cytosol to the average protein intensity at the plasma membrane. Intensities were background-subtracted before calculating ratios. Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD show slightly higher ratios compared with N-BAR, suggesting that disordered domains may have hindered plasma membrane binding somewhat. Dots indicate individual cells; black lines indicate means. (D) Representative tubes in RPE cells overexpressing the indicated proteins tagged with mCherry. Images were acquired in TIRF at 37\u00b0C. Tubules are from cells with similar protein expression level, and all images are displayed with equal contrast settings. White arrows indicate tubes. N-BAR shows greater enrichment on the tube relative to the local background compared with Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD. Bars, 1 \u00b5m. (E) Protein intensity on membrane tubes in live cells, quantified as the ratio of the tube intensity to the local background intensity. Points indicate individual tubes, and black lines indicate means. Data were quantified from TIRF videos that were taken under identical imaging settings. n = 100, 50, and 91 tubes for N-BAR, Amph-FL, and N-BAR-NfM CTD, respectively. P values: unpaired, two-tailed Student's t tests. These data indicate the disordered domains of Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD did not promote fission of lipid tubules in live cells by enhancing protein binding to the membrane surface. Figure S5 . While F-BAR generates membrane tubules, FCHo1-FL forms highly curved fission vesicles. Membrane composition in TEM experiments: 80 mol% DOPC, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , and 15 mol% DOPS. Vesicle composition in E: 76 mol% DPPC, 15 mol% DPPS, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 2 mol% DP-EG10biotin, and 2 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE. For vesicles in F, DPPC and DPPS were replaced with DOPC and DOPS, respectively. All vesicles extruded to 200 nm. \n\nVideo 1. The amphiphysin N-BAR domain generates mobile lipid tubules from GUVs.

Live cell imaging reveals that N-BAR generates tubules with longer lifetime compared with Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD. Video shows tubules in live RPE cells expressing N-BAR (left), Amph-FL (middle), or N-BAR-NfM CTD (right), imaged by TIRF microscopy at 37\u00b0C.
