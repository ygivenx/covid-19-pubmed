{"title": "Antipsychotic behavioral phenotypes in the mouse Collaborative Cross recombinant inbred inter-crosses (RIX)", "body": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder that affects about 1% of the population worldwide and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and personal and societal costs (SAHA et al. 2007; WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION 2008; LAURSEN et al. 2012; CLOUTIER et al. 2016) . Onset typically occurs in adolescence or early adulthood with the emergence of a number of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior (AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. 2013) . Antipsychotic medications are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia, but as much as 75% of patients discontinue assigned treatments due to side effects and/or inefficacy over relatively short periods of time (LIEBERMAN et al. 2005) . Deciphering the pharmacogenetics of antipsychotics could eventually allow the development of predictive algorithms, such that physicians could predict which patients are prone to develop side effects or less likely to achieve a therapeutic response. Advances in this arena could lead to safer and more efficacious therapeutic interventions for the treatment of schizophrenia.\n\nHaloperidol is a high-potency, typical, first-generation antipsychotic whose use is associated with motoric adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including tardive dyskinesia (SOARES-WEISER AND FERNANDEZ 2007), involuntary orofacial movements, and extrapyramidal symptoms (i.e., dystonia and Parkinsonism) (MILLER et al. 2008) . There is substantial inter-individual variation in liability to these ADRs and direct and indirect evidence suggest a role for genetic variation (LERER et al. 2005; PATSOPOULOS et al. 2005; BAKKER et al. 2006) . There is significant heterogeneity in therapeutic response to antipsychotics (LIEBERMAN et al. 2005) , with roughly equal proportions of patients experiencing remission, partial response, and no benefit. Vacuous chewing movements (VCMs), which present in rodents as purposeless mouth openings in the vertical plane, are a valid rodent model for the human pharmacogenetic phenotype of tardive 4 Traditional recombinant inbred strains that are generated by crossing two parental inbred strains followed by 20 generations of inbreeding by brother-sister mating lack genetic diversity and are limited by the number of available strains (e.g. C57BL6/J, 129S1, BALB/c, etc.). In contrast, the Collaborative Cross (CC) (THREADGILL et al. 2002; CHURCHILL et al. 2004;  COLLABORATIVE CROSS CONSORTIUM 2012) is a panel of recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains, derived from eight founder laboratory strains, that was designed as an optimized murine model of heterogeneous human populations (CHURCHILL et al. 2004; AYLOR et al. 2011; THREADGILL et al. 2011; COLLABORATIVE CROSS CONSORTIUM 2012) . The CC captures the complexity of the mammalian genome, and is an important resource for mapping complex traits and system genetics efforts (AYLOR et al. 2011; KELADA et al. 2012; FERRIS et al. 2013; GRALINSKI et al. 2015; GRALINSKI et al. 2017; SHORTER et al. 2017; SRIVASTAVA et al. 2017) . The CC has also been a source of new models of human diseases (ROGALA et al. 2014; GRAHAM et al. 2016; MCMULLAN et al. 2018; ORGEL et al. 2019) . By mating different CC strains, we can generate recombinant inbred inter-crosses (CC-RIX) (ZOU et al. 2005; SCHOENROCK et al. 2018) . CC-RIX are outbred but their genomes are completely reproducible (by mating their parental CC strains) and thus are an intriguing model of the genetic diversity akin to that in human populations (ZOU et al. 2005; LIU et al. 2018) . The genetic diversity of CC-RIX enables the study of parent-oforigin effects and their phenotypic characterization has demonstrated that there are strong strain effects in some measures (CROWLEY et al. 2015; SCHOENROCK et al. 2018) . Using standard inbred lines, we previously demonstrated that we could effectively deliver haloperidol at human-like steady-state concentrations, that steady-state plasma haloperidol concentration is a trait with relatively high heritability, and that there were substantial RI strain differences in the vulnerability to VCMs (CROWLEY et al. 2012a; CROWLEY et al. 2012b; CROWLEY et al. 2014) .\n\nIn this study, we generated 840 mice and performed extensive phenotypic characterization of 777 mice representing 73 RIX lines chronically treated with haloperidol or placebo in order to gain insight into the genetic basis of ADRs. We performed a battery of behavioral tests, including open field activity, the inclined screen test, and video recordings of VCMs, in order to examine the strain and treatment effects of chronic haloperidol exposure.\n\nUsing linear mixed models we showed that RIX lines exhibited strong strain effects and strainby-treatment interactions, supporting the hypothesis of a significant differential contribution of their genetic background to haloperidol-induced ADRs. The fact that RIX lines displayed a range of responses to haloperidol-induced ADRs, with a distribution that is comparable to the susceptibility of haloperidol-ADRs in the human population, supports their use as a model for the study of pharmacogenomics and additional phenotypes. 7 comfortable position for the mouse. The collar partially immobilized the mice at the neck but still permitted head movement to allow for video recording of jaw movements by JVC Everio digital camcorders. Digital videotapes were made using the protocol developed by Tomiyama et al. (TOMIYAMA et al. 2001 ). The first 10 minutes of video were not analyzed in order to allow the mice to adjust to the collar and to relax. The last 15 minutes of the video were scored for orofacial movement. Videos were randomized and scored by a single-blinded rater to increase consistency and to reduce any deviation or bias between raters. The rater was trained by an expert and a set of standard training videos used in the studies by Crowley et al. (CROWLEY et al. 2012a; CROWLEY et al. 2012b) to align the rater with the correct identification of VCMs according to the scoring from those previous studies. Drift was monitored by re-scoring random videos throughout the course of the study.\n\nThe movements that were specifically analyzed and counted were tongue protrusions, jaw tremors, overt chewing movements, and subtle chewing movements. Individual events of each movement were counted. Subtle chewing movements were defined as instances of vertical jaw movement in which the inside cavity of the mouth could not be seen and the jaw was not open for a long period of time. Overt chewing movements occurred when a larger vertical movement was observed in which the cavity could be seen and the jaw was open for an extended length of time. The videos were scored using The Observer XT (Noldus Inc., Wageningen, Netherlands) observational data analysis program. Previous work by Crowley et al had shown that when 27 inbred strains were treated with chronic haloperidol, the behavioral domains that were measured loaded onto two factors, rather than being discrete constructs (CROWLEY et al. 2012a) . One factor loaded primarily on antipsychotic-induced changes in open field activity, while the other loaded primarily on haloperidol-induced orofacial movements. In this study, we have collapsed all four VCM measures into a single factor.\n\nTissue collection. Mice were sacrificed on day +32 relative to the start of drug treatment by cervical dislocation. We collected blood plasma from haloperidol-treated mice at this time using EDTA-treated tubes in order to measure haloperidol drug concentration. Blood was centrifuged to isolate plasma. Haloperidol assays were performed using mass spectrometry at the Analytical Psychopharmacology Laboratory located at the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research (Orangeburg, NY, USA).\n\nStatistical models. As shown in Table 1 , the phenotypes studied can be grouped into three classes depending on the nature of outcome ascertainment; correspondingly, three separate statistical models were employed. For the open field activity, EPS, and body mass phenotypes, outcomes were ascertained on two occasions (pre-and post-treatment) in both .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/761353 doi: bioRxiv preprint 8 arms. VCMs were measured on a single occasion (post-treatment) in both arms. Blood plasma phenotype was also only measured post-treatment, but naturally only applies to the haloperidol arm.\n\nFor the open field, EPS, and body weight phenotypes, the difference between pre-and post-treatment measurements were taken and log-transformed for body weight. The mixed model employed for these phenotypes was:\n\n= 0 + 1 * + 2 * + 3 * + 4 * * + \u2211 5 =1 + where refers to the vector of transformed responses, to the pre-treatment phenotype value, is a vector of treatment indicators, controls for sex, and controls for the interaction of sex and treatment. Each refers to a random effect vector associated with the th random effect. The \u2032 correspond to the batch, strain, strain-by-treatment, strain-by-sex, and strain-by-sex-by-treatment effects (henceforth referred to as effects 1-5, respectively). We assume that the 's are mutually independent and ~(0, 2 \u00d7 ). Further, the error term ~(0, 2 * \u00d7 ), independent of the random effects. Details on the construction of the associated random design matrices are included in File S1.\n\nA single VCM phenotype was derived by summing the number subtle and overt VCM, tongue movements, and tremors. For this phenotype, the following model was employed, with the term to control for the pre-treatment value excluded, as follows:\n\n= 0 + 2 * + 3 * + 4 * * + \u2211 5 =1 + .\n\nHaloperidol blood concentration was log-transformed, and the following model was employed. This model controls for three random effects: batch, strain, and sex (1, 2, and 4):\n\n= 0 + + 3 * + 1 1 + 2 2 + 4 4 + .\n\n(http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py?run=availableLines). Supplemental files are available at FigShare. Table S1 describes the CC strains used to generate the RIX lines that were part of the study. Figure S1 shows the mating scheme used to cross CC and generate RIX with maximum genetic diversity. Figure S2 shows haloperidol-induced changes in behavioral measures. Figure S3 shows the raw data for RIX mice treated with haloperidol or placebo, for the centroid time and stereotypy measures of OFA. Figure S4 shows RI strain-by-treatment and strain prediction intervals for stereotypy, centroid, and EPS. Figure S5 presents raw data and strain-by-treatment predictions for body weight of RIX mice treated with haloperidol or placebo. Figure S6 shows CC strain-level predictions for plasma haloperidol levels. Figure S7 compares the pre-treatment distributions of various behavioral measures between the CC-RIX, the CC diallel study (CROWLEY et al. 2014) , and a survey of 27 mouse strains (CROWLEY et al. 2012a; CROWLEY et al. 2012b) . File S1 includes the sample code.\n\nIn this study, we used RIX mice derived from the genetically diverse CC in order to understand the effects of haloperidol-induced ADRs, using a battery of behavioral tests as a means of doing a comprehensive phenotypical characterization. To maximize genetic diversity and test outbred mice with reproducible genomes, we generated RIX mice by crossing males and females from two different CC RI strains (Figure 1a) in a quasi-loop design ( Figure S1 ).\n\nThis quasi-loop design used all RI genomes available at the time, generating a mostly uniformly structured population, potentially expanding the analytical possibilities beyond simple additive models, and providing a systematic approach to detect regulatory variation including parent-oforigin effects. We performed a battery of behavioral tests in 840 mice from 73 RIX lines (derived from 62 CC strains) treated with haloperidol or placebo in order to monitor the development of ADRs. Figure 1c details the phenotyping pipeline for this study. Mice were entered into the phenotyping pipeline at 8 weeks of age and behavioral assays were carried out as detailed in Materials and Methods. Below, we provide both descriptive as well as model-based results for the behavioral phenotypes examined using the CC-RIX.\n\nI. CC-RIX mice exhibit reduced open field activity after chronic treatment with haloperidol .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/761353 doi: bioRxiv preprint 10 The raw data are visualized at the marginal (that is, not strain-specific) level in a series of density plots (Figures 2a-d) that illustrate the densities for each phenotype. Open field activity decreased from pre-to post-treatment for mice treated with placebo or haloperidol (Figure 2a-b) . This is visualized as a left-shift in the distribution curve, for all phenotypes except for stereotypy (Figure 2d) . This was expected for both cohorts, as mice are known to spend less time exploring the open field chamber when re-exposed, due to lack of novelty. For distance traveled (Figure 2a; Figure S2a ) and vertical activity (Figure 2b; Figure S2b) , the leftshift is far more pronounced for the haloperidol treated mice, suggesting a strong average treatment effect. The left-shift is more modest for time in centroid (Figure 2c; Figure S2c ), and not observed at all for stereotypy (Figure 2d; Figure S2d ). Note that this implies only that there is a lack of a marginal effect. For stereotypy, although the raw data do not suggest a treatment effect at the mean, treatment still affects individual RIX strains differently (see below).\n\nThe raw data from the inclined screen test (Figure 2e) , suggest an extreme effect of haloperidol. For pre-treatment and placebo-treated mice the series cluster around zero; these mice move almost immediately after being placed on the inclined screen. Conversely, the distribution for the haloperidol treated mice is bimodal, exhibiting an extremely fat right tail, enriched with a noticeable proportion of animals who are unable to move their four paws at all within the 60-second experiment.\n\nThe raw data for VCM are visualized in the distribution curves in Figure 2f . Haloperidoltreated RIX mice show increased susceptibility to the emergence of VCMs, as evidenced by the fattening of the right tail in the haloperidol series vis-\u00e0-vis the placebo series. Note a small but noticeable proportion of animals from both treatment paradigms do not experience any VCMs. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/761353 doi: bioRxiv preprint 11 medians. These differences in medians are visualized as the monotonically increasing series of red dots. Chronic haloperidol exposure had divergent effects across OFA measures. For distance traveled and vertical activity, more than half of the RIX lines display a reduction in these OFA measures after haloperidol exposure (Figure 3a-b) , while less than a quarter of RIX lines displayed changes in stereotypy (Figure S3a) , and centroid duration ( Figure S3b ) seemed unaffected in most lines. The raw data for EPS showed that the majority of RIX lines showed a delayed response in the inclined screen test after haloperidol treatment (Figure 3c) . Lastly, the raw data for the VCM measure showed that more than half of the RIX lines displayed higher incidence of VCMs after haloperidol treatment (Figure 3d ).\n\nThe main model results are in Table 2 , which includes results for all eight phenotypes assayed in our experiment. For ease of readability, some p-values were also not explicitly listed, but rather the level at which they were significant is simply indicated by asterisks and colorcoding. The first five rows of the table contain the fixed effect estimates with p-values in parentheses. These p-values were computed using the Kenward-Roger approximation to compute the denominator degrees of freedom. The next four rows contain the estimates for the variance components of interest (the batch effect has been excluded), with the p-values computed from the likelihood ratio tests (LRTs). The next four rows correspond to test statistics and p-values that involve multiple parameters; the numbers in the rows corresponding to fixed effects are F-statistics, and those in the rows corresponding to tests of random effects are likelihood ratio statistics.\n\nOne salient result is the strong marginal (fixed) effect of treatment, which is highly significant for most phenotypes. Confirming the results from the exploratory analyses above, it is not significant in centroid and stereotypy models, however, and only weakly significant in the model for body weight. Note, however, that the strain effect is highly significant for all models, including centroid and stereotypy. The random treatment effects are also significant for all phenotypes except body weight ( Figure S5 ).\n\nThe main model results included in Table 2 provide evidence of the existence of strain and strain-by-treatment interactions. However, determining which parental (RI) strains . CC-BY 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/761353 doi: bioRxiv preprint 12 contribute most is also of interest; i.e., we are interested in the levels of the random effects not just the estimates of the variance components. We used BLUPS for these strain level predictions. We plotted these in ascending order for all phenotypes (Figure 4) . The absolute height of each bar corresponds to the prediction interval. Due to the small number of samples per RIX, there is little power to differentiate between the RI effects: in comparing two strain predictions, their intervals tend to overlap, except when comparing strains at the extremes.\n\nUnder the assumption of the additive strain effects, these strain-level predictions can be used to predict which RIX lines will exhibit extreme phenotypes.\n\nWe can leverage information across phenotypes to find strains that have consistently extreme predictions, and use this information to actually inform future experiments by selecting strains that have the most extreme results. Here, we show that the strain predictions are correlated across phenotypes, as are strain-by-treatment interactions. To assess this correlation, we used the Pearson correlation coefficient and present the results in the correlograms in Figure 5 . The first panel applies to the strain predictions and the second to the strain-by-treatment interactions (note that the blood haloperidol concentration appears only in this second panel; although the relevant random effects were termed \"strain\" effects in the model for this phenotype, they were only predicted in haloperidol-treated mice). For the additive strain effects, there are two salient results. The distance, vertical and body weight phenotypes are correlated, with changes in horizontal distance correlating highly with changes in vertical beams broken. Further, those strains with the largest decreases in the phenotypes exhibited the smallest increases in weight, as expected. The other two open field phenotypes exhibit some correlation with VCM. Increased time spent in centroid is associated with fewer VCM, while increased stereotypy is associated with increased VCM. The correlation manifests in the strainby-treatment effect as well, with the effect of treatment on changes in distance, vertical, and centroid effects all being correlated. Further, the effect of treatment on the changes in distance and time spent in centroid are inversely proportional to the effect of treatment on body weight.\n\nOur study employed the genetically diverse CC-RIX mice to elucidate the genetic basis of antipsychotic ADRs. We performed a battery of behavioral tests in 840 mice from 73 RIX lines treated with haloperidol or placebo in order to monitor the development of ADRs. CC-RIX lines displayed a wide-ranging response to haloperidol treatment induced ADRs as captured in . CC-BY 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/761353 doi: bioRxiv preprint 13 pre-and post-drug behavioral measures. On average, treatment had a strong effect for every phenotype, with the exceptions of centroid and stereotypy. However, note that even for these phenotypes, there was significant between-strain variability. The majority of the CC-RIX lines exhibited reduced distance traveled and vertical activity upon haloperidol treatment, with about a third of the RIX lines exhibiting little change in these measures after exposure to haloperidol (Figure 3a-b) . Centroid time and stereotypy measures did not appear to be as sensitive to haloperidol induced response ( Figure S3) . The majority of RIX lines showed a delayed response in the inclined screen test (EPS) after haloperidol treatment (Figure 3c ) and more than half of the RIX lines displayed higher incidence of VCMs after haloperidol treatment (Figure 3d) . Interestingly, the prevalence of ADRs in the CC-RIX population is analogous to what has been observed in humans, where 20-43% of patients treated with antipsychotics can develop tardive dyskinesia (HALLIDAY et al. 2002; SOARES-WEISER AND FERNANDEZ 2007) We used linear mixed models to test for the existence of strain and treatment effects. Of note, all phenotype models that included a pre-treatment fixed effect demonstrated significant regression to the mean; subjects with higher pre-treatment scores experienced larger reductions in the phenotype. We observed highly significant strain effects for almost all behavioral measurements investigated (p<0.001). Further, we observed strong strain-by-treatment interactions for most phenotypes, with particularly strong effects (p<0.001) for change in distance traveled and change in vertical activity, as well as change in EPS. When viewing the BLUPs, it is important to keep in mind that given the small sample sizes for each parental strain, comparisons between the effects of individual pairs of parental strains are not necessarily significant, even when the overall effects are highly significant. To draw closer attention to the treatment effect BLUPs, we indicate strains that are at the extreme for those phenotypes with a substantial mean shift in Figure 3 and Figure S3 (in the direction consistent with this mean shift) in the rightmost columns of Table S1. We flag strains that are in the most extreme 10%, finding that 27 strains had extreme responses for at least one of these phenotypes, with eight of these being extreme for multiple phenotypes.\n\nDespite extensive efforts, we have a limited understanding of the heritability of motoric ADRs in humans (ZHANG AND MALHOTRA 2011; DRAGO et al. 2012; CROWLEY et al. 2014) . As shown in Table 2 , estimates of heritability for the phenotypes measured using the CC-RIX ranged from 0.21 (for change in body weight) to 0.4 (for both number of VCMs and change in distance traveled). Using a similar chronic haloperidol treatment paradigm in 27 genetically diverse inbred strains, we previously showed that haloperidol-induced ADRs (including VCMs and EPS) are highly heritable (~0.9), with strain being a major predictor of phenotypic variation .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/761353 doi: bioRxiv preprint 14 independently of haloperidol plasma levels (CROWLEY et al. 2012a) . The discrepancy between the heritability estimates found for VCMs between these studies is likely due to the genetic diversity present in the CC-RIX, when compared to the 27 inbred lines, and the lower heritability found in the CC-RIX (h 2~ 0.4), which is likely closer to the heritability of the analogous trait (TD) in humans.\n\nOne major goal of our study is to identify specific genes driving antipsychotic ADRs in the CC-RIX mice. For each open field phenotype, we attempted genetic mapping using R/qtl2. (BROMAN et al. 2019) We did this in two ways, first using pre-treatment phenotype as the dependent variable (controlling for sex) and also using change from baseline as the dependent variable (controlling for pre-treatment phenotype, sex, treatment, and the interaction thereof).\n\nWe did not detect any LOD peaks that exceeded the significance threshold established based on 1000 permutations. The inability to find significant associations is not unexpected, as these traits appear to be polygenic and we would likely need a much larger sample size to achieve enough power to map these. We have also explored the genetic architecture of these behavioral measures using a diallel cross of the eight genetically diverse founder strains of the CC, and shown that ~70% of the variance in EPS is explained by parent-of-origin and additive effects (CROWLEY et al. 2014) . We compared the pre-treatment distributions of the phenotypes for which comparable data were available in our data, this diallel cross, and the aforementioned survey of 27 mouse strains (see Figure S7 ). The distributions largely accord with our expectations; for the distance and vertical phenotypes, the right tails of the RIX distributions are thicker than those for the other samples, consistent with their expected hybrid vigor. The same pattern is observed for VCM. Conversely, the mice in the Strain Survey dataset are the heaviest, as they are enriched with NZO samples, which were specifically bred to express this phenotype.\n\nOur study supports the use of the CC-RIX mouse population for pharmacogenomics studies. We observed that 30% of CC-RIX mice exhibited a sensitivity to haloperidol exposure, evidenced by VCMs and EPS, closely matching the proportion of humans that develop TD after treatment with this antipsychotic. Given the significant impact that antipsychotic ADRs and subsequent discontinuation of treatment can have on patients, making headway in our understanding of the genetic basis for the susceptibility to antipsychotic ADRs could advance the development of safer and more effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of schizophrenia.\n\n.
