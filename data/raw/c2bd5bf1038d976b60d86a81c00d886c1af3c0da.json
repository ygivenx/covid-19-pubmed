{"title": "Surveillance for Coronaviruses in Bats, Lebanon and Egypt Laboratory Methods Screening", "body": "5X reaction buffer, 1 \u03bcL dNTPs, 1 \u03bcL enzyme mix, 1.5 \u03bcL (10 Pmole) forward primer, 1.5 \u03bcL (10 Pmole) reverse primer, 10 \u03bcL ddH2O, and 5 \u03bcL of sample RNA. The PCR cycler conditions for the amplification were 50\u00b0C for 30 min (reverse transcription) then 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 45 cycle of 94\u00b0C for 15 s (denaturation), 48\u00b0C for 30 s (annealing), 72\u00b0C for 40 s (extension), then 72\u00b0C for 10 min (final extension). The PCR product was then put through a second round PCR by using a new set of primers (forward primer 5-GGTTGG-GACTATCCTAAGTGTGA-3, reverse primer 5-CCATCATCAGATAG-AATCATCAT-3) which amplify a final PCR product of 440 bp. Using Phusion High Fidelity PCR Master Mix Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), a 25-\u03bcL reaction contained 12.5 \u03bcL of 2X phusion master mix, 1.5 \u03bcL (10 Pmole) forward primer, 1.5 \u03bcL (10 Pmole) reverse primer, 7.5 \u03bcL H2O, and 2 \u03bcL of PCR product. The PCR cycler conditions were 98\u00b0C for 2 min then 45 amplification cycles (98\u00b0C for 15 s, 48\u00b0C for 15 s, 72\u00b0C for 30 s), then 72\u00b0\u00b0C for 2 min. The final PCR amplicons were gel purified using the QIAquick gel purification kit (QIAGEN) and analyzed by sequencing (1) . The upE quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed as previously described (2) .\n\nThe second round forward and reverse primers were to sequence the purified DNA amplicons using a BigDyeR Terminator v3. GenBank accession nos.: KT220528-KT220562, KT368821, KT581588-KT581603. Serology A pseudo-particle neutralization assay was used to test bat serum against MERS-CoV as previously described (5) .\n\nEthics approval was obtained from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (Memphis, TN, USA) . Swabs and tissues were tested by RT-PCR, and positive samples were sequenced. "}
