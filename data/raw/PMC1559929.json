{"title": "Delivery Systems for the Direct Application of siRNAs to Induce\n       RNA Interference (RNAi) In Vivo", "body": "Altered expression levels of certain genes play a\npivotal role in several pathological conditions. For example, \nin many cancers the upregulation of\ncertain growth factors or growth factor receptors, or the\nderegulation of intracellular signal transduction pathways,\nrepresents key elements in the process of malignant transformation\nand progression of normal cells towards tumor cells leading to\nuncontrolled proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Since these\nprocesses may result in the direct, autocrine stimulation of the\ntumor cell itself as well as the paracrine stimulation of other\ncells, including the stimulation of tumor-angiogenesis, many novel\ntherapeutic strategies focus on the reversal of this effect, that\nis, the inhibition of these proteins or the downregulation of\ntheir expression. Likewise, several other diseases have been\nfirmly linked to the (over-)expression of endogenous wildtype or\nmutated genes. Taken together, in addition to strategies based on\nthe inhibition of target proteins, for example, by low molecular\nweight inhibitors or inhibitory antibodies, this opens an avenue\nto gene-targeting approaches aiming at decreased expression of the\nrespective gene.\n\nThe first method to be introduced for the specific inhibition of\ngene expression was the use of antisense oligonucleotides in the\nlate 1970s [1, \n2]. Upon their introduction into a cell,\nantisense ODNs are able to hybridize to their target RNA leading\nto the degradation of the RNA-DNA hybrid double strands through\nRNAase H, to the inhibition  of the translation of the target\nmRNA due to a steric or conformational obstacle for protein\ntranslation and/or to the inhibition of correct splicing. In the\nearly 1980s, the discovery of ribozymes, that is, catalytically\nactive RNAs which are able to sequence-specifically cleave a\ntarget mRNA, further expanded gene-targeting strategies\n[3\u20135]. Subsequently, both methods were extensively \nstudied and further developed with regard to the optimization of targeting\nefficacies and antisense-ODN/ribozyme delivery strategies in vitro and in vivo.\n\nMost recently, another naturally occurring biological strategy for\ngene silencing has been discovered and termed RNA interference\n(RNAi). Since RNAi represents a particularly powerful method for\nspecific gene silencing and is able to provide the relatively easy\nablation of the expression of any given target gene, it is now\ncommonly used as a tool in biological and biomedical research.\nThis includes the RNAi-mediated targeting in vitro and in vivo for\nfunctional studies of various genes whose expression is known to\nbe upregulated as well as the development of novel therapeutic\napproaches based on gene targeting.\n\nRNAi is an evolutionarily conserved, sequence-specific,\nposttranscriptional gene silencing phenomenon. It is triggered by\ndouble-stranded RNA molecules as described first in C elegans by\nFire et al [6] who then introduced the name RNA\ninterference. These findings also explained earlier observations\nin petunias which turned white rather than purple upon the\nintroduction of the \u201cpurple gene\u201d in form of dsRNA \n[7], and\non gene silencing by antisense oligonucleotides as well as by\nsense oligonucleotides in C elegans [8]. \nSubsequent studies demonstrated that RNAi, while described under different names\n(posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), cosuppression,\nquelling), is present in most eukaryotic organisms with the\nresponse to dsRNA, however, being more complicated in higher organisms.\n\nRNAi relies on a multistep intracellular pathway which can be\nroughly divided into two phases, that is, the initiation phase and\nthe effector phase. In the initiation phase, double-stranded RNA\nmolecules from endogenous or exogenous origin present in the cell\nare processed through the cleavage activity of a ribonuclease\nIII-type protein [9\u201312] into short  21\u201323 nucleotide\nfragments termed siRNAs. These effector siRNAs, which contain a\nsymmetric 2 nt overhang at the 3\u2032-end as well as a\n5\u2032-phosphate and a 3\u2032-hydroxy group, are then in the effector\nphase incorporated into a nuclease-containing multiprotein\ncomplex called RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) \n[13].\nSeveral structural and biochemical studies have shed light on the\nprocessing of double-stranded RNA and the formation of the RISC\ncomplex (see, eg, [14] for a recent review). Through\nunwinding of the siRNA duplex by an RNA helicase activity\n[15], this complex becomes activated \nwith the single-stranded siRNA guiding the RISC complex to its complementary target RNA.\nUpon the binding of the siRNA through hybridization to its target\nmRNA, the RISC complex catalyses the endonucleolytical cleavage of\nthe mRNA strand within the target site, which, due to the\ngeneration of unprotected RNA ends, results in the rapid\ndegradation of the mRNA molecule. With the RISC complex being\nrecovered for further binding and cleavage cycles, the whole\nprocess translates into a net reduction of the specific mRNA\nlevels and hence into the decreased expression of the\ncorresponding gene. For an overview of the RNAi pathway, see\nFigure 1.\n\nWhile from this mechanism it becomes obvious that siRNA molecules\ncomplementary to the target mRNA and thus being able to serve as a guide\nsequence for the RISC complex play a pivotal role in this process, they need\nnot be derived from long double-stranded precursor molecules. Rather,\nomitting the initiation phase, they can be delivered directly into the\ntarget cell (Figure 1, upper right arrow).\n\nSeveral studies have led to the development of guidelines for the\ngeneration of siRNAs which are optimal in terms of efficacy and\nspecificity [12, \n16]. This includes the initial definition of\nthe preferable length (19\u201325 bp) combined with a low G/C\ncontent in the range between 36% and 52% and the requirement\nof symmetric 2 nt overhangs at the 3\u2032-end \n[16\u201318].\nLater studies on synthetic siRNA molecules, however, revealed an\nup to 100-fold higher targeting efficacy in the case of even\nlonger duplexes (25\u201330 nucleotides) which act as a substrate for\nDicer and which therefore allow the direct incorporation of the\nnewly produced siRNAs into the RISC complex [19]. \nAs to be expected, intramolecular foldback structures which can result\nfrom internal repeats or palindrome sequences decrease the numbers\nof functional siRNA molecules with silencing capability \n[20].\nAdditional silencing-enhancing criteria include an A in position 3\nand a G at position 13 of the sense strand, the absence of a C or\nG at position 19 and, most importantly, a U in position 10 of the\nsense strand. Since nucleotides 10\u201311 represent the site of the\nRISC-mediated cleavage of the target mRNA, this indicates that\nRISC is comparable to most other endonucleases in preferentially\ncleaving 3\u2032 of U rather than any other nucleotide \n[20, 21].\nFurthermore, it was shown more generally that the thermodynamic\nflexibility of the positions 15\u201319 of the sense strand\ncorrelates with the silencing efficacy and that the presence of at\nleast one A/U base pair in this region improves siRNA-mediated\nsilencing efficacy due to a decreased internal stability of its\n3\u2032-end [20].\n\nStill, different siRNA sequences may display differing efficacies, which\nsuggest additional still unknown criteria for optimal siRNA selection and\nemphasize the influence of target mRNA accessibility. In fact, several\nstudies also correlate the siRNA efficacy with the mRNA secondary structure\n[18, 22\u201327].\n\nIn conclusion, apart from the selection criteria defined above, the\nindividual screening of different siRNAs for highly efficient and specific\nduplexes, or the pooling of multiple siRNAs, is the most effective\napproach to increase siRNA-mediated targeting efficacy.\n\nFor the design of effective siRNAs, several algorithms on publicly\naccessible web sites are available (see [28] \nfor review). To reduce the risk of nonspecific (\u201coff-target\u201d) \neffects of the siRNAs, a homology search of the targeting sequence against a gene database is\nnecessary and already incorporated in some of these web sites. Nevertheless,\nit has also been shown that siRNAs may cross-react with targets of limited\nsequence similarity when regions of partial sequence identity between the\ntarget mRNA and the siRNA exist. In fact, in some cases regions comprising\nof only 11\u201315 contiguous nucleotides of sequence identity were sufficient to\ninduce gene silencing [29]. The prediction of these\noff-target activities is difficult so far.\n\nAn additional mechanism that may lead to nonspecific effects in\nvivo relies on the interferon system [30\u201333]\nwhich is induced when double-stranded RNA molecules enter a cell activating\na multi-component signalling complex. This effect is particularly\ntrue for long dsRNA molecules and essentially prevents them from\nbeing used as inducers of RNA interference in mammalian systems.\nThe development of synthetic siRNAs [10, \n12, 33, \n34] largely\ncircumvents this problem since they seem to be too small. However,\nsome synthetic siRNAs do induce components of the interferon\nsystem which seems to be dependent on their sequence\n[31, 32, \n35]\nas well as, in the case of in vitro transcribed siRNAs, on the 5\u2032\ninitiating triphosphate [36]. Thus,\nstrategies to avoid as far as possible the unwanted interferon\nresponse upon application of siRNAs in vivo will include a design\nof siRNAs without known interferon-stimulating sequences, the use\nof the lowest possible siRNA dose to still achieve the desired\neffect and optimized siRNA delivery methods.\n\nBased on the known mechanisms of antisense technology, ribozyme-targeting \nor RNAi, small oligonucleotides or plasmid-based expression vectors can be used\nto specifically downregulate the expression of a given gene of interest or\nof pathological relevance in vitro. In principle, this also applies to the\nin vivo situation leading to novel, potentially relevant therapeutic approaches.\n\nFor the delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids, viral vectors have\nbeen used which have the advantage of high transfection efficacy\ndue to the inherent ability of viruses to transport genetic\nmaterial into cells. On the other hand, however, viral systems\nshow a limited loading capacity regarding that the genetic material are\nrather difficult to produce in a larger scale and, most\nimportantly, pose severe safety risks due to their oncogenic\npotential and their inflammatory and immunogenic effects which\nprevent them from repeated administration [37\u201340].\n\nIn the light of these problems, concerns, and limitations, nonviral systems\nhave emerged as a promising alternative for gene delivery. Main requirements\nare the protection of their nucleic acid \u201cload\u201d as well as their efficient\nuptake into the target cells with subsequent release of the DNA or RNA\nmolecules and, if necessary, their transfer into the nucleus. Several\nstrategies can be distinguished, mainly lipofection and polyfection relying\non cationic lipids or polymers, respectively (see, eg, \n[41\u201343]).\n\nThe efficient protection against enzymatic or nonenzymatic\ndegradation is particularly important for RNA molecules including\nsiRNAs. In fact, while the therapeutic potential of siRNAs for the\ntreatment of various diseases is in principle very promising,\nlimitations of transfer vectors may turn out to be rate-limiting\nin the development of RNAi-based therapeutic strategies. One\napproach to solve this problem is the use of DNA expression\nplasmids which encode palindromic hairpin loops with the desired\nsequence. Upon transcription and folding of the RNA, the\ndouble-stranded short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are recognized by\nDicer and cleaved into the desired siRNAs. Additionally, an in\nvitro method has been described recently which is based on the\nexpression of shRNAs in E coli and their delivery via bacterial\ninvasion [44]. While \nall these different DNA-based systems\noffer the advantage of siRNA expression with a longer duration and\na probably higher level of gene silencing, they still rely on\n(viral or nonviral) delivery of DNA molecules and again raise\nsafety issues in vivo. Hence, the direct delivery of siRNAs\nmolecules, derived from in vitro transcription or chemically\nsynthesized, offers advantages over DNA-based strategies and may\nbe preferable for in vivo therapeutic use.\n\nIn the last years, a large body of studies has been published\nwhich describe different strategies for the systemic or local\napplication of siRNAs in vivo. Tables 1\u20133\ngive an overview. The probably largest number of papers focuses\nthe use of unmodified siRNAs (Table 1) whose\nadministration is often performed IV by hydrodynamic transfection\n(high pressure tail vein injection). While this method is widely\nused and in some cases led to efficient target gene inhibition in\nthe liver and, to a lesser extent, in lung, spleen, pancreas, and\nkidney, it may suffer from certain technical and practical\nlimitations at least in a therapeutical setting since it relies on\nthe rapid IV injection of a comparably large volume (>= 1\n ml/mouse/injection, in theory equivalent to a \u223c 3 l\nIV bolus injection in man). Alternative strategies for the\napplication of naked siRNAs include various delivery routes which,\nhowever, often provide an only local administration or rely on an\nadministration at least close to the target tissue or target\norgan, thus restricting the number of target organs which may not\nbe relevant for certain diseases. It should also be noted that\nseveral studies described here and below use rather large amounts\nof siRNAs and that upon intravenous injection of siRNAs the liver\nis the primary site of siRNA uptake. As an alternative approach\nfor the application of siRNAs in vivo, their delivery by\nliposomes/cationic lipids has been described. For liposome-based\nsiRNA formulations, a wide variety of modes of application\nallowing local or systemic delivery has been used\n(Table 2). Finally, several other strategies for local\nor systemic siRNA administration have been explored, including\nchemical modifications of siRNA molecules, electropulsation,\npolyamine, or other basic complexes, atelocollagen, virosomes, and\ncertain protein preparations (Table 3).\n\nAn alternative approach relies on the complexation of unmodified siRNA\nmolecules with a cationic polymer, polyethylenimine (PEI).\n\nPolyethylenimines (PEIs)   are synthetic polymers available in\nbranched or linear forms (Figure 2, upper panels) and\nin a broad range of molecular weights from < 1000 Da to\n> 1000 kd. Commercial PEI preparations, although labelled\nwith a defined molecular weight, consist of PEI molecules with a\nbroad molecular weight distribution [45\u201347]. \nPEIs possess a high cationic charge density due to a protonable amino group in\nevery third position [48, \n49]. Since no quarternary amino\ngroups are present, the cationic charges are generated by\nprotonation of the amino groups and hence are dependent on the pH\nin the environment (eg, 20% at pH 7.4, see \n[50] for\nreview). Due to its ability to condense and compact the DNA into\ncomplexes, which form small colloidal particles allowing efficient\ncellular uptake through endocytosis, PEI has been introduced as a\npotent DNA transfection reagent in a variety of cell lines and in\nanimals for DNA delivery (for review, see [51, \n52] and\nreferences therein). In fact, in several studies PEI has been\nshown to be able to deliver large DNA molecules such as\n2.3 Mb yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) \n[53] as well\nas plasmids or small oligonucleotides [48, \n54\u201356] into\nmammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. The N/P ratio, which\nindicates the ratio of the nitrogen atoms of PEI to DNA phosphates\nin the complex and thus describes the amount of PEI used for\ncomplex formation independent of its molecular weight, influences\nthe efficiency of DNA delivery. A positive net charge of the\ncomplexes, resulting from high N/P ratios, inhibits due to\nelectrostatic repulsion their aggregation and improves their\nsolubility in aqueous solutions as well as their interaction with\nthe negatively charged extracellular matrix components and thus\ntheir cellular uptake [57]. Additionally, \nthe strong buffer capacity, described by the \u201cproton sponge \nhypothesis\u201d which\npostulates enhanced transgene delivery by cationic polymer-DNA\ncomplexes (polyplexes) containing H+ buffering polyamines due\nto enhanced endosomal Cl\u2212 \naccumulation and osmotic\nswelling/lysis [48], \nseems to be responsible for the fact\nthat PEI-based delivery does not require endosome disruptive\nagents for lysosomal escape. This tight condensation of the DNA\nmolecules as well as the buffering capacity of PEI in certain\ncellular compartments like endosomes and lysosomes also protects\nDNA from degradation [48, \n49, 58, \n59]. PEIs have been\nsuccessfully used for nonviral gene delivery in vitro and in vivo.\nWhile initial publications showed increased transfection\nefficacies when using high molecular weight PEIs \n[45], more\nrecent studies demonstrated the advantages of certain low\nmolecular weight PEIs [47, \n60, \n61]. The higher transfection\nefficacy of low molecular weight PEIs may be due to a more\nefficient uptake of the resulting PEI/DNA complexes, a better\nintracellular release of the DNA and/or lower in vitro\ncytotoxicity as compared to high molecular weight PEI\n[60\u201363]\n. In fact, a decrease in the molecular weight of\nthe PEI leads to an increase in complex size which may be\nfavourable at least for in vitro use [64, \n65]. On the other\nhand, other PEIs with very low molecular weight (< 2 kd)\ndisplay little or no transfection efficacy even at very high N/P\nratios which may be attributed to the fact that a decrease in the\nmolecular weight of PEI has been shown to translate into an\nincreasingly lower ability to form small complexes [63].\nTherefore, low molecular weight PEIs require higher N/P ratios\nfor optimal transfection efficacies as compared to higher\nmolecular weight PEIs since higher N/P ratios lead to an increase\nin compaction with reduced complex sizes and a reduced tendency of\nthe complexes to aggregate due to hydrophobic interactions\n[61, 63, \n64]. Nevertheless, while several parameters \nhave been extensively studied, some precise determinants for transfection\nefficacy remain to be elucidated (see [50, \n66] for review).\nAlso, the mechanism of the cytotoxic effects of PEI complexes is\nonly poorly understood. It may rely on the formation of large\naggregates in the range of up to 2 \u03bcm which, when formed on\nthe cell surface, impairs membrane functions finally leading to\ncell necrosis [60]. Clearly, \nthere is a trend towards low\nmolecular weight PEIs as rather nontoxic delivery reagents in\nvitro and in vivo, which combine high biocompatibility and reduced\nside-effects thus also allowing to employ larger PEI/DNA complex\namounts without significant cytotoxicity.\n\nMore recently, the use of polyethylenimines has been extended\ntowards the complexation and delivery of RNA molecules, especially\nsmall RNA molecules like 37 nt all-RNA ribozymes\n[67\u201369] \nand siRNAs [70] (Figure 2). While\nchemically unmodified RNA molecules are very instable and prone to\nrapid degradation, the PEI complexation has been shown to lead to\nan almost complete protection against enzymatic or\nnonenzymatic degradation. In fact, PEI-complexed siRNAs, which are\n[32P]-labeled for better detection, remain intact in vitro\nfor several hours even in the presence of RNase A or fetal calf\nserum at 37\u00b0C, while non-complexed siRNAs are rapidly\ndegraded (Figure 3(a)). This indicates that\nsiRNA molecules are efficiently condensed and thus fully covered\nand protected by PEI. Indeed, the analysis of PEI/siRNA complexes\nby atomic force microscopy showed the absence of free siRNAs or\nsiRNA molecule ends and thus confirms these findings regarding an\nefficient complexation (Grzelinski et al, submitted). However,\nwhile the complex stability seems to be sufficient for siRNA\nprotection with all PEIs tested (Werth et al, in press; Aigner et\nal, unpublished data), several of these complexes do not show any\ntargeting efficacy at all. In fact, only when using certain\npolyethylenimines, PEI/siRNA complexes are efficiently delivered\ninto target cells in vitro, where siRNAs are released and display\nbioactivity (Figures 1 and \n2). In general and\nas seen before for PEI/DNA complexes (see above), the transfection\nefficacy is dependent on the PEI used, also indicating that the\nsiRNA targeting efficiency mainly depends on the endocytotic\nuptake of the complex and/or its intracellular\ndecomposition rather than on the in vitro complex stability. Good\nresults were obtained with commercially available JetPEI [70]\nwhile the in vivo JetPEI from the same supplier showed only poor\nsiRNA delivery efficacies [71]. Likewise, a novel low\nmolecular weight PEI based on the fractionation of a commercially\navailable polyethylenimine demonstrates high siRNA protection and\ndelivery efficacies in vitro (Werth et al, in press). Under\ncertain conditions, the PEI/RNA (siRNA or ribozyme)\ncomplexes retain their physical stability and biological\nactivity also after lyophilization ([72] and Werth et al, in\npress). Although the PEI transfection is only transient, data from\nour lab show that PEI/siRNA effects are stable for at least 7 days\n(Urban-Klein and Aigner, unpublished results). Finally, another\nstudy has explored the use of siRNA nanoplexes comprising of PEI\nthat is PEGylated with an RGD peptide ligand attached at the\ndistal end of the PEI. Again, siRNA nanoplexes protect siRNAs\nagainst serum degradation and show in vitro activity [73].\n\nThe ultimate goal is the application of siRNAs in vivo which has\nbeen explored in some studies in different mouse models. Ge et al\nshowed that PEI-complexed siRNAs targeting conserved regions of\ninfluenza virus genes are able to prevent and treat influenza\nvirus infection in mice. Upon IV injection, PEI promoted the\ndelivery of siRNAs into the lungs where, either given before or\nafter virus infection, siRNA reduced influenza virus production in\nthe lungs [74].\n\nMost biological effects of the systemic application of\nPEI-complexed siRNAs, however, have been determined in different\nmouse tumor models and by targeting different proteins which have\nbeen shown previously to be tumor-relevant. This includes the\nepidermal growth factor receptor HER-2 (c-erbB-2/neu), the growth\nfactor pleiotrophin (PTN), and vascular endothelial growth factor\n(VEGF) and its receptor (VEGF R2), and the fibroblast growth\nfactor-binding protein FGF-BP.\n\nThe in vivo administration of PEI complexed, but not of naked\nsiRNAs, through IP or subcutaneous injection resulted in the detection of\nintact siRNAs even hours after injection\n(Figure 3(b)). Radiolabeled siRNA molecules were found\nin several organs including subcutaneous tumors, muscle liver,\nkidney and, to a smaller extent, lung and brain. It is important\nto note that the siRNAs were actually internalized by the tissues\nas indicated by the fact that blood was negative for siRNAs\n(Figure 3(b)).\n\nOverexpression of the HER-2 receptor has been observed in a wide variety of\nhuman cancers and cancer cell lines. Since HER-2 displays strong cell\ngrowth-stimulating and antiapoptotic effects especially through heterodimer\nformation with other members of the EGFR family, its overexpression has been\nestablished as a negative prognostic factor and linked to a more aggressive\nmalignant behaviour of tumors (eg, [75]). \nConsequently, HER-2 qualifies as an attractive target molecule for antitumoral treatment\nstrategies including anti-HER-2 antibodies, low molecular weight inhibitors,\nor HER-2-specific gene-targeting approaches. In fact, the relevance of HER-2\n(over-)expression in tumor growth has been established in several in vitro\nHER-2 targeting studies including the use of ribozymes\n[76, 78, \n79]\nor siRNAs [80, \n81]. It was\ndemonstrated that HER-2 reduction in vitro leads, among others, to the\ninhibition of cell proliferation and increased apoptosis.\n\nThe systemic treatment of athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous SKOV-3\novarian carcinoma tumor xenografts through IP injection of PEI-complexed\nHER-2-specific siRNAs led to marked antitumoral effects as seen by a\nsignificant reduction tumor growth (Figure 4) \n[70].\nPEI-complexed nonspecific siRNAs or HER-2-specific, naked siRNAs had no\neffects. This was paralleled by the detection of intact HER-2-specific\nsiRNAs in the tumors of the specific treatment group already 30 min after\nadministration and for at least 4 h, and by the downregulation of HER-2 on\nmRNA and protein levels [70].\n\nAnother receptor, VEGF R2, was targeted in a study employing self-assembling\nnanoparticles based on siRNAs complexed PEI which is PEGylated with an RGD\npeptide ligand attached at the distal end of PEG. While the PEGylation\nallows steric stabilization and reduces nonspecific interactions of the\ncomplexes, the RGD motif provided tumor selectivity due to their ability to\ntarget integrins expressed on activated endothelial cells in the tumor\nvasculature. Upon IV administration into mice bearing subcutaneous N2A\nneuroblastoma tumor xenografts, a selective tumor uptake and a VEGF R2\ndownregulation were observed, resulting in decreased tumor growth and tumor\nangiogenesis [73].\n\nThe receptor ligand, VEGF, is a mitogenic and angiogenic growth factor\nstimulating tumor growth and angiogenesis in several tumors including\nprostate carcinoma. Thus, it may represent attractive target molecule for\nRNAi-based gene-targeting strategies also bearing in mind the double\nantitumoral effect due to reduction of tumor cell proliferation as well as\ntumor angiogenesis. The subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection of\nVEGF-specific siRNAs complexed with a novel PEI obtained through\nfractionation of a commercially available PEI (Werth et al, in press)\nresulted in the reduction of tumor growth due to decreased VEGF expression\nlevels (H\u00f6bel and Aigner, unpublished results). The same was true for\nPEI/siRNA-mediated targeting of FGF-BP (Dai and Aigner, unpublished\nresults), which has been established previously as \u201crate-limiting\u201d for tumor\ngrowth and angiogenesis in several tumors ([82, \n83],  see [84] for review).\n\nFinally, PEI/siRNA-mediated targeting of pleiotrophin (PTN) exerted strong\nantitumoral effects. PTN is a secreted growth factor which shows mitogenic,\nchemotactic, angiogenic and transforming activity\n[85\u201393]\nand which is markedly upregulated in several human tumors including cancer\nof the breast, testis, prostate, pancreas, and lung as well as in melanomas,\nmeningiomas, neuroblastomas, and glioblastomas. The in vivo treatment of nude\nmice through systemic subcutaneous or IP application of PEI-complexed PTN siRNAs\nled to the delivery of intact siRNAs into subcutaneous tumor xenografts and a\nsignificant inhibition of tumor growth. Likewise, in a clinically more\nrelevant orthotopic mouse glioblastoma model with U87 cells growing\nintracranially, the injection of PEI-complexed PTN siRNAs into the CNS\nexerted antitumoral effects. This establishes, also in a complex and\nrelevant orthotopic tumor model, the potential of PEI/siRNA-mediated PTN\ngene targeting as a novel therapeutic option in GBM, and further extends the\nmodes of delivery of PEI/siRNA complexes intrathecal strategies as employed\nin the therapy of glioblastomas with antisense oligonucleotides.\n\nOnly a few years after their discovery, siRNAs are catching up with\nribozymes and antisense oligonucleotides as efficient tools for\ngene targeting in vitro and, more recently, also in vivo. This includes the\nexploration of their potential as therapeutics which will lead to the\ndevelopment of siRNA-based therapeutic strategies. Their ultimate success,\nhowever, will strongly depend on the development of powerful and feasible\nsiRNA delivery strategies which need to address several issues including the\nstability/stabilization of siRNA molecules while preserving their efficacy\nand maintaining their gene-silencing activity, an efficient delivery into\nthe target organ(s) as well as a sufficiently long siRNA half life in the\norganism and particularly in the target organ. Thus, siRNA delivery\nstrategies must provide siRNA protection and transfection efficacy, the\nabsence of toxic and nonspecific effects, they must be efficacious also\nwhen using small amounts of siRNAs and must be applicable in various\ntreatment regimens and in various diseases even when this requires to\novercome biological barriers after their administration to reach their\ntarget tissue or target organ. The research done on DNA-based gene delivery,\nribozyme-targeting, and antisense technology will facilitate this process\nsince it already provides a basis of established technologies. This is also\ntrue for the complexation of siRNAs with polyethylenimine, which may\nrepresent a promising avenue for siRNA applications in vivo. This may\neventually lead to novel therapeutic strategies."}
