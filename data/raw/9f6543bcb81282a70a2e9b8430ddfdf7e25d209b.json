{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Arguments in favor of remdesivir for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections Arguments in favor of remdesivir for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections", "body": "Since the end of 2019, the increasing number cases of pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, then other cities and provinces in China and many countries [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [8] , a new human pathogen, was identified as the cause of Wuhan pneumonia. The disease spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection, so called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , was known to be diverse in severity, ranging from asymptomatic carriage, mild respiratory tract infection to severe or fatal pneumonia. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted within the family, in the community, among cruise passengers, and in hospitals, and has become a public health emergency of international concern, declared by WHO on January 30, 2020. As on February 28 of 2020, the laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 56 countries and territories with more than 83,382 cases reported globally; more than 78,832 of these cases were reported from China (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).\n\nIn the view of virologists, human and zoonotic coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. Currently, there are four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus. Before the current epidemic of COVID-19, there were six recognized human respiratory coronaviruses: HCoV-229E (Alphacoronavirus), HCoV-OC43 (Betacoronavirus), HCoV-NL63 (Alphacoronavirus), and HKU1 (Betacoronavirus), which often cause mild respiratory tract infection; in contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can lead to severe or even fatal lower respiratory tract disease [9] . The seventh human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, which also contains SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.\n\nSo far, no drugs, monoclonal antibodies, or vaccines have been approved to treat human infections due to coronaviruses. Several pre-existing and potential drug candidates, including chloroquine and remdesivir, have been considered [10] [11] [12] . The discovery and marketing of 4 new compounds often require months to years. However, in the face of global spread of COVID-19, effective interventions for severe cases of COVID-19 are urgently needed.\n\nThough little is known about SARS-CoV-2, several insights may be gained from its more well-known family member, SARS-CoV [11] . Here, we review the literature on an existing but not approved antiviral agent, remdesivir, which exhibits promising in vitro antiviral activity and preliminary clinical experiences in the treatment of COVID-19. \n\nAlthough SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share only 82% RNA sequence identify, their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) share 96% sequence identify [11] . Therefore, the drugs targeting viral RdRp proteins of SARS-CoV are likely to be effective for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nFor the RdRp target in the genus Betacornavirus, there are several potential drugs or compounds, including favipiravir, ribavirin, penciclovir, galidesivir, remdesivir, 6'-fluorinatedaristeromycin analogs, and acyclovir fleximer analogs [12] . Remdesivir (GS-5734), the phosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine C-nucleoside [13] , has a structure similar to tenofovir alafenamide, which is a nucleotide analog of adenosine 5-monophosphate with antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus. It was developed by Gilead Science Inc. and has not been licensed or approved anywhere for now.\n\nMoreover, GS-441524 has been recommended for the treatment of cats with feline infectious peritonitis, which is uncommon but fatal, and caused by a feline coronavirus [14] .\n\nThe chemical formula of remdesivir with a molecular mass of 602.6 is C 27 H 35 N 6 O 8 P. In several human cell lines, remdesivir can be effectively metabolized to active nucleoside triphosphate [15] . An in vitro study has demonstrated that nucleoside triphosphate works as an incorporation competitor with adenosine triphosphate, confuses viral RdRp, acts as a delayed RNA-chain terminator against Ebola virus [15, 16] , evades proofreading by viral exoribonuclease, and causes a decrease in viral RNA production [17] . Recently, the antiviral activity of remdesivir was exhibited at the stage after virus entry into Vero E6 cells, supporting its antiviral mechanism as a nucleotide analog [18]. 6 In 2016, GS-5734 or remdesivir was reported to be active against Ebola virus in multiple human cell types, including primary macrophages and human endothelial cells, with low half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) values of 0.06 to 0.14 \u03bcM [15] . In addition, remdesivir was reported to exhibit antiviral activity in vitro against Marburg virus [15] , Paramyxoviridae (such as parainfluenza type 3 virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Measles and Mumps virus), and Pneumoviridae (such as respiratory syncytial virus) [19] .\n\nIn primary human airway epithelial cell culture, a biological relevant in vitro model of pulmonary infection, remdesivir was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV (half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC 50 : 0.069 \u03bcM) and MERS-CoV (IC 50 : 0.074 \u03bcM) replication [20] .\n\nAdditionally, remdesivir was effective against many human and zoonotic coronaviruses, Even before approval and clinical use, the concern of antiviral resistance in remdesivir has been studied. Using MHV as the tested CoV, two of three lineages of wild-type MHV in the presence of increased concentrations of GS-441524 were lost after 17 and 20 repeated passages, and only one lineage after 23 passages selected a low-level resistant mutant, conferring a 5.6-fold increase in EC 50 [17] . Two amino acid substitutions (F467L and V553L)\n\nwere noted in non-structural protein (nsp) 12, the RdRp of MHV, and also resulted in a 6-fold increase of EC 50 in SARS-CoV. However, the remdesivir-resistant MHV with F476L and Early clinical experience of remdesivir therapy in a female nurse from Scotland with Ebola meningoencephalitis, which was supported by the detection of Ebola virus RNA in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, its first use for Ebola virus infection in humans, was reported in 2016 [22] . She was successfully treated with high-dose corticosteroids and 14 days' remdesivir therapy (once-daily infusion of 150 mg over 2 hours for 2 days, and then daily 225 9 mg for another 12 days). No serious clinical or biochemical events occurred except a transient rise of serum amylase level.\n\nIn a recent published, randomized and controlled clinical trial of four experimental therapeutics for Ebola virus disease, a total of 175 patients ever received remdesivir [23] .\n\nAlthough remdesivir therapy was not favored due to the high mortality rate of 53% (93/175), no detailed clinical or biochemical side effects associated with remdesivir therapy was ever described; the safety profile of remdesivir was not challenged. One patient on remdesivir therapy developed hypotension and cardiac arrest after the discontinuation of the loading dose; however, the authors explained that such an adverse event cannot be excluded to be related to underlying Ebola virus disease, a potentially fatal infectious disease. 10 \n\nThe first case of COVID-19 in Washington, the United States was compassionately treated with intravenous remdesivir for the progression of pneumonia on day 7 of hospitalization [24] .\n\nInterestingly, the patient's condition improved and no obvious adverse effect was observed.
