{"title": "2\u2032-5\u2032oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (2-5 OAS1) polymorphism is associated with prostate cancer", "body": "2\u2032-5\u2032 Oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (2) (3) (4) (5) is an extensively characterized enzyme induced by interferons (IFN) that is required for an effective anti-viral response 1, 2 . 2-5 OAS1, in the presence of double stranded RNA structures, such as viral genomes or single stranded RNA transcripts that possesses significant double stranded character, converts ATP to a series of 2\u2032 -5\u2032 -oligoadenylates (2-5A) 2 . One of the primary function of 2-5A is to promote dimerization of latent ribonuclease (RNaseL) to form catalytically active RNaseL 3, 4 . Activated OAS1-RNaseL system promotes apoptosis 5 , attenuates proliferation 6 , degrades viral and cellular RNA and inhibits protein synthesis 1, 7 . OAS has also been to shown to affect cellular events independent of RNaseL, such as antiviral activity 8, 9 , and cell growth and differentiation 10 . Evidence also demonstrates pro-apoptotic activity of OAS1 isoform 9-2(p48) (in vitro interaction with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) 11, 12 .\n\nEpidemiological studies, linkage analysis, association based studies and positional cloning/ candidate gene approach have led to the identification of RNaseL as candidate hereditary prostate cancer gene [13] [14] [15] . Experimental studies have also shown that an active RNaseL not only degrades viral genome but is also anti-proliferative and promotes senescence and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, thus acting as a true tumor suppressor [16] [17] [18] . However, follow up studies by several groups have not identified significant number of RNaseL germline variants among families with hereditary prostate cancer 15, 19, 20 . Moreover, significant associations between RNaseL mutations/ polymorphism and sporadic prostate cancer have not been observed 19 . These observations led us to believe that alternate mechanisms and pathways leading to the activation/ expression of RNaseL could be involved in the prostate cells. One of these mechanism/ pathways may possibly be at the level of OAS1, a rate limiting enzyme in RNaseL activation. Thus a defect in OAS1 can possibly attenuate RNaseL function, but can also alter cell growth and apoptosis in an RNaseL independent manner.\n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms are known to modulate OAS1 function at multiple levels including expression, alternative splicing and enzyme activity. A total of about 46 (UCSC genome database) to 57 (NCBI dbSNP database) polymorphic markers are known to exist in the OAS1 gene. Two of these functional non-synonymous polymorphic markers (rs1131454 and rs2660) are well studied and demonstrate association with various diseases such as susceptibility to hepatitis C virus 21, 22 , influenza A virus 23 , flavivirus 24 , West Nile virus 25 , respiratory epithelial cell syncytial virus 26 , ocular herpes simplex virus type 1 and SARS 27 . OAS1 polymorphism also increases susceptibility to multiple sclerosis 28, 29 and type I diabetes 30, 31 . Interestingly, an A/G single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2660, A>G) near the exon 7 splice-acceptor site of the OAS1 gene is known to alter the 2-5OAS1 enzyme activity. OAS1 enzyme activity is highest in individuals with GG genotype, intermediate in those with AG genotype and lowest in the AA genotype 32 .\n\nCollectively, these observations led us to investigate the hypothesis that functional polymorphism, specifically at rs2660 and rs1131454 in 2-5OAS1 could be associated with prostate cancer. Our results demonstrate that rs2660 but not rs1131454 polymorphism is associated with prostate cancer and that a specific rs2660 genotype may confer decreased susceptibility to prostate cancer.\n\nProstate cancer cell lines LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 were purchased and cultured as per the instructions from ATCC.\n\nThe genotyping protocol and use of human samples in the study were approved by IRB at Clark Atlanta University. Genotyping was performed on a total of >300 samples. Cancers and controls constituted approximately 50% each of the total sample set (Table I) .\n\nRetrospectively collected Buffy coat samples were obtained from Bio-specimen Shared Resource, KU Cancer Center, University of Kansas Medical Centre and Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN, Southern Division) following appropriate protocol review and approval. The purified genomic DNA samples were obtained commercially from BioServe Inc. (Beltsville, MD). All samples were stored at \u221280 until analysis. De-identified comprehensive clinical information regarding age, ethnicity and stage was available for all samples. Ethnicity of the samples was as reported by the vendor and no specific admixture analysis was performed. However, family history of prostate cancer, PSA level and Gleason score was not available for all samples hence were not included in final statistical analysis.\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated (and stored at \u221280C) from cultured cells or buffy coat using AquaPure total genomic DNA isolation kit (Bio-Rad). On an average approximately 30ug of DNA was routinely isolated from 300ul of buffy coat. Total RNA from cultured cells was isolated using the Trizol (Invitrogen) method. The final RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, air dried and resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated H2O at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and stored at \u221280C until analysis.\n\nOne ug of total RNA was reverse transcribed using MMLV-RT (Promega) in total volume of 20ul as per manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using the following gene specific primers: (NM_001032409) Forward: 5\u2032-TGA CGG TCT ATG CTT GGG AG and Reverse: 5\u2032-CAA GAT GCA CTG GCA TTC AG, in a 25ul reaction using GoTaq Colorless master mix (12.5ul, Promega), 400pm each of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 primers and 2ul of the reverse transcribed RNA.\n\nGenomic PCR was carried out in a 25ul PCR reaction that consisted of 12.5ul GoTaq Colorless Master Mix (Promega), 30ng genomic DNA and 400pm of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 primer each. The PCR was carried out for 35 cycles with annealing temperatures of 62C and 52C for rs2660 and rs1131454 respectively. The following primers were used (Ref. \n\nTotal protein from cultured prostate cancer cells was extracted using M-per (Pierce) containing appropriate protease inhibitors (Complete mini, Roche). The total protein concentration was determined by Bradford's method. Twenty microgram of total protein was separated by 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, CA). Western blot analysis was performed using protein specific antibody for OAS1 (goat anti-human, sc-49833, Santa Cruz) and Actin (rabbit anti-human, Santa Cruz, CA) as primary antibodies and detected with donkey anti-goat (sc-2020)-HRP and anti-rabbit IgG -HRP conjugate, Upstate, CA) respectively. HRP was detected by ECL (Pierce, IL) and blots visualized using the Fuji Film LAS-3000 Imager.\n\nThe rs2660 and rs1131454 polymorphism was detected by sequencing the PCR amplicon spanning the above stated SNPs using the primer pairs indicated above. An aliquot of the respective PCR reaction was first analyzed on 1.5%agarose gel to confirm specificity and quality of the reaction in terms of band size and absence of any background PCR product. Once confirmed, the remaining PCR product was cleaned using ExoSAP-IT (USB) before sequencing on the AB sequencer (DNA sequencing Lab, Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA). The sequencing was performed using 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 primers in case of rs1131454 and by nested primers within the rs2660 PCR product. The sequences were scanned using ABI sequence scanner and the SNPs were manually detected. The amplicons showing low quality reads were re-sequenced. The single nucleotide polymorphisms were also detected by SNPdetctor 33 to ensure that the SNPs were due to heterozygous allelic variations and not due to sequencing artifacts. The sequences aligned with NCBI a reference sequence (NM_001032409) in CLUSTAL W was also used to validate respective sequence reads.\n\nThe sample size required to achieve statistically significant associations were calculated using the power calculator for case control genetic association studies (PGA) 34 . The parameters used in sample size calculations were as follows: power of 0.95 (95%), \u03b1 of 0.05, prostate cancer disease prevalence of 250/ 100,000 men (actual for all races, white and black is 156.9, 150.4 and 234.6 per 100,000 men respectively as per SEER). The rs2660 AA genotype disease frequency of 50% was chosen as disease allele frequency. Based on these variables the PGA estimated a sample size of <100 cases (actual sample size would have been lower with exact prostate cancer disease prevalence numbers). Based on these calculations we selected our sample size of approximately \u00d71.5 times than that estimated by PGA.\n\nEach of the polymorphisms was tested for association with prostate cancer. Odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the genotype in association with prostate cancer using logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age. Relationship between genotype distribution with subjects stratified with race and age were also analyzed using the above model. NCSS version 2007, version 07.1.19 and SigmaStat v3.5 was used for statistical analysis. The sample size calculations and power were calculated using the \"Power for Genetic Association Analyses\" (PGA) package in Matlab (available on the National Cancer Institute website) 34 . After stratifying the data by age group and race, the regular logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence Interval (CI) using the control group as a reference 35 . Logistic regression models were also used to assess the interaction between age and genotypes in the case group and detect differential rs2660 effects at different age intervals. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nThe OAS1 gene gives rise to three alternatively spliced proteins (isoforms 1, 2 and 3), primarily at the C-terminal end with varying molecular weights as shown in Fig. 1A . The rs1131454 SNP in exon C (3 rd exon) is present in all three OAS1 isoforms. The rs2660 SNP is however present in only OAS1 isoforms 1 and 3. In OAS1 isoform 1, rs2660 is in the 3\u2032UTR whereas in OAS1 isoform 3 it is present towards the C-term end of the protein. Both rs1131454 (in all OAS1 isoforms) and rs2660 (in OAS1 isoform 3) are non-synonymous and results in G\u2192S and G\u2192R amino acid change respectively as outlined in Fig. 1A .\n\nIn order to establish a rationale for investigating the association between OAS1 polymorphism and prostate cancer we first investigated the expression of OAS1 in established prostate cancer cell lines. OAS1 expression was observed at both the transcript and protein level in DU145 and PC3 cells ( Fig. 1C and D) . In LNCaP cells we occasionally observed the OAS1 transcript but the protein was not detected by western blot (Fig. 1C and  D) . The inconsistency at the transcript level could be due to alternative splicing that might result in premature termination of the peptide in LNCaP cells ( Fig. 1C and D) .\n\nThe genotype of the cell lines for SNPs in this study were as follows: rs2660: AG for all three cell lines; rs 113154: LNCAP-GG, DU145-AG and PC3 -AA; rs34137742: CC for all three cell lines.\n\nA retrospective case-control study on 304 samples was performed for the analysis for OAS1 rs2660 and rs1131454 polymorphisms. The unrelated clinically defined cancer (N=164) and control samples (N=140) were roughly 50% each of the total sample population. The mean age of cancer samples was 63.7\u00b10.746 and normal samples was 60.2\u00b11.3 and were age matched (P=0.273). The sample population was a mixture of Caucasian and African Americans ( Table I) .\n\nThe frequencies of both rs2660 and rs1131454 (previously rs3741981) genotypes in our normal sample set were consistent with those reported for other control populations 22 . The rs2660 allele frequency conformed to Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in Caucasian population (Chi square=3.546, P=0.17). Due to the lack of GG genotype (minor allele in rs2660), a marked deviation from HW equilibrium in the African American subjects was observed. The frequency distribution of rs2660 and rs1131454 in our complete (all samples) and stratified sample set is listed in Tables II and III respectively.\n\nrs2660-The combined cancer and control group revealed that AA was a major (67.5%) whereas GG was a minor (7.9%) genotype (Table II) . The AA genotype was overrepresented in cancers (76% vs. 57% in control, a ratio of 3:2) whereas the AG genotype distribution was essentially similar in cancer (22.4%) and normal groups (27.1%) (Table II) . Contrary to the AA genotype distribution, the GG genotype was over-represented in the normal group (15.7%) as compared to cancers (1.2%, Table II ). Sample stratification demonstrated that rs2660 genotype distribution was associated with race: the AA genotype was over-represented in African American group (87.4% vs. 49% Caucasian), whereas AG (13% vs. 36% in Caucasian) and GG (0% vs. 15% in Caucasian) genotypes were overrepresented in Caucasian group. The genotype distribution suggested that G allele is significantly under-represented in African Americans (6.5%) whereas the A allele was over represented in African Americans (93.5%).\n\nComprehensive statistical analysis revealed that subjects in the combined sample, with AA genotype were 2.4 times more likely to develop prostate cancer than those with other genotypes (OR=2.4, P=0.0004, Table II ). The logistic regression analysis also suggested a 61% increased risk of prostate cancer with AA genotype than with other genotypes (Fig.  2A) . This result was consistent with both African American (OR=3.0, P=0.042, Table II) and Caucasian groups (OR=2.473, P=0.0073, Table II) suggesting that irrespective of race, the genotype AA is more strongly associated with prostate cancer. Conversely, GG genotype reduced the incidence of prostate cancer by 15 fold (1/0.06, OR=0.06, P<0.0001, Table II ) as compared to AG and GG genotypes. Converting this OR into probability terms suggested that the presence of GG genotype reduced the incidence of prostate cancer by 92% (using other genotypes as base and for the same age group). The AG genotype was found not to be a risk factor when analyzed in context of all samples (OR=0.775, P=0.3533) and within Caucasian population (OR=1.17, P=0.7422).\n\nThe statistical analysis also examined the effect of age on incidence of prostate cancer. Data stratification by age demonstrated that over 50 years of age, the incidence of prostate cancer was 1.22 fold higher than the previous decade-but the likelihood number jumped to 3.60 by decade with AA genotype. Therefore, with increasing age, the AA genotype significantly increased the prostate cancer incidence as compared to effect of age alone on prostate cancer (Fig. 2B ). rs1131454 and rs34137742-No significant association between rs1131454 (A>G) was observed with prostate cancer (Table III) . The rs34137742 genotype was observed while analyzing the sequence from rs1131454 genotyping (C>T, 209bp upstream of rs1131454 in intron, Table IV ). Statistical analysis failed to demonstrate any significant association of rs34137742 with prostate cancer either (Table IV) . Both rs1131454 and rs34137742 did however confirm to HW equilibrium and no ethnic disparity was observed in their genotype distribution.\n\nIn this study, we report for the first time an association between OAS1 polymorphism and prostate cancer. As an important part of the total constitutive activity of OAS enzymes, OAS1 activity is a rate limiting enzyme in determining RNaseL anti-viral and tumor suppressor activities 36 . Recent studies demonstrate that OAS1 can also promote apoptosis and act as an antiviral agent independent of RNaseL via paracrine mechanisms 9 . Thus OAS1 is emerging as a multifunction protein that is not only involved in innate immune response but also as a potent tumor suppressor.\n\nFor this study we selected two functional OAS1 polymorphic markers (rs2660 and rs1131454) that are associated with a disease/ viral infection. In general the rs2660 AA genotype promotes disease susceptibility whereas GG genotype confers protection (SARS-CoV infection 37 , multiple sclerosis(MS) 28, 29 ), possibly because AA, AG and GG genotype results in the lowest, intermediate and highest OAS1 enzyme activity respectively 32 . Consistent with these observations, the genotype AA appears to be a risk factor for prostate cancer (61% increased risk) whereas higher activity genotype GG protects against prostate cancer (92% lower risk). The A allele is also a significant risk factor with age in prostate cancer: in our logistic regression model age was a risk factor for prostate cancer, as expected. However AA genotype further increased the odds of prostate cancer incidence.\n\nThe absence of rs2660 homozygous GG genotype in the African American population is essentially consistent with population wide genotype distribution reported in NCBI dbSNP database: Analysis of NCBI dbSNP database revealed that GG genotype is absent in African American and Sub-Saharan African population: the GG genotype is absent in ss24415263 African America samples (AFD_AFR_panel, n=46) and in ss38908277 Sub-Saharan African samples (HapMap-YRI, n=120) . The frequency of the G allele in ss38908277 African American set is only 0.09% (AoD_African_American, n=90) as compared to the frequency of 9.7% (exclusively from AG genotype) in our normal African American sample set (Table II) . Thus at least three independent studies performed on three different platforms (PERLEGEN: ss24415263 and ABI XPLORE: ss38908277 and our sequencing based analysis) on two diverse populations demonstrate the lack of GG genotype in subjects with African ethnicity (Sub-Saharan and African American). These results suggest that OAS1 polymorphism and perhaps spliced variants could be genetically determined in African Americans. Surprisingly, the GG genotype was observed in the Caucasian sample set and its frequency was heavily biased in favor of normal Caucasians (28.2% in normal vs. 2.4% in Cancer, OR = 16.11, p<0.0001). In contrast the AA genotype associated with prostate cancer, is high in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. For the sake of brevity we may propose that the higher incidence of prostate cancer in African Americans could be due to the lack of GG genotype, however a larger cohort and specific biological endpoint measurements such as the effect of this genotype on expression, enzyme activity, apoptosis, proliferation and other yet unknown biological activities are needed to support this statement.\n\nThe rs2660 genotype is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs10774671 32 . The G and A alleles in rs10774671 govern splicing to the last OAS1 exon (Exon 7) that harbors rs2660. The GG genotype (in rs10774671) retains the splice site resulting in high enzyme activity whereas AA genotype disrupts the splice site leading to low enzyme activity 32 . Due to altered splicing, the three genotypes reportedly generate different OAS1 isoforms: p46 (GG), p46 and p48 (AG) and p48 (AA) 38 . The p46 and p48 isoforms have identical exons 1-6 but divergent exon 7. As expected, two transcripts corresponding to p46 (~500bp) and p48 (~400bp) isoforms were observed in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines which harbor AG genotype (rs2660) using primer pairs spanning exon 3-7. Surprisingly, LNCaP cells that also have the heterozygous AG genotype did not express any of the OAS1 spliced variants suggesting a splicing event 5\u2032 from exon 3 or between exon 3 and 7. In addition to rs2660, the rs10774671 is also in linkage disequilibrium with rs1051042 and rs3177979 (all on exon 7) 32 . It will be interesting to investigate if the proposed LD exists between this block in prostate cancer cells and in our sample set.\n\nThe rs1131454 (previously rs3741981), in the evolutionary conserved exon 3 is also nonsynonymous (G\u2192A allele results in G\u2192S amino acid change) and is close to the dsRNA binding domain of all OAS1 isoforms. This polymorphism was suggested to be functional in a genetic study of type 1 diabetes possibly due to congenital rubella virus infection 39 . In our data set no statistically significant association was observed between rs1131454 genotype racial distribution and prostate cancer.\n\nCollectively, the association studies and data stratification presented in this study suggests that rs2660 is specifically associated with prostate cancer with significant racial disparity and age. Prostate cancer is caused by multiple genes possibly interacting in complex biological pathways and influenced by environmental factors. The OAS1-RNaseL pathway fits this general hypothesis: irrespective of RNaseL mutations/ expression, low or lack of OAS1 activity, will attenuate RNaseL action and subsequently host innate immune response and tumor suppression. Thus, polymorphism in OAS1 such as rs2660 that alters its activity 32 can not only modulate the effects of higher-risk susceptibility genes (RNaseL) responsible for hereditary prostate cancer but could also promote sporadic prostate cancer independently.\n\nIn this study we investigated the association of the functional polymorphism (rs2660) in OAS1 with prostate cancer. Our results suggest that rs2660 AA genotype is significantly associated with prostate cancer whereas GG genotype protects against prostate cancer.\n\nFunding Support: NIH/ NCMHD P20MD002285-01. Support for core facilities and shared/additional resources were funded in part by NIH/NCRR/RCMI G12RR03062\n\nStructure, polymorphisms and expression of OAS1. Panel A: The structure of OAS1 gene showing isoforms 1 (p46/ E18), 2 (p42/E16) and 3 (p48/ 9-2). Exons are designated A through E. The last exon in isoforms 1 (p46/ E18) and 3 (p48/ 9-2) is not labeled. The nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism rs1131454 (nucleotide: G>A, protein: G>S) appears in all isoforms. Single nucleotide polymorphism rs2660 (G>A) is located in the last exon in isoform 3 (p48/ 9-2) resulting in G>R amino acid and in the 3\u2032UTR in isoform 1 (p46/ E18). Single nucleotide polymorphism rs34137742 (C>T) is in the intron between exons B and C. Panel B: A typical RFLP used for confirming rs1131454 SNP with Tau1 restriction digest of the amplified genomic PCR fragment using primer pairs indicated in materials and methods. Panel C: Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on mRNA isolated from LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells using primer pairs indicated in materials and methods. These primers were designed to differentially amplify OAS1 isoforms 1(p46) and 3 (p48) resulting in approximately 500 and 400bp bands respectively. Panel D: OAS1 protein expression in prostate cancer cell lines with Western Blot analysis. Whole cell lysates were used for Western Blot analysis using antibody against OAS1 and \u03b2-actin as loading control. The PCR and western blot shown here are representative of at least 3 experiments. Panel A: The probability of a particular genotype and prostate cancer calculated from a logistic regression model (P(case| genotype). Each of the genotype was used as a dependent variable in calculating its association with prostate cancer in a logistic regression model. The graph shows the probability from this model expressed as percentage. Based on this model the AA genotype increases the risk of prostate cancer by 61% compared to other genotypes. Genotype AG is neutral to the risk of prostate cancer; it neither increases nor decreases the risk of prostate cancer and genotype GG decreases the risk of prostate cancer by 92%. Panel B: Effect of age and rs2660 genotype AA on prostate cancer. Prostate cancer incidence increases with age as shown by increase in odds ratio (OR-only age effect). Genotype AA has an additive effect on prostate cancer incidence (OR-age + AA effect). \n\nAssociation of OAS1 rs34137742 SNP with prostate cancer.
