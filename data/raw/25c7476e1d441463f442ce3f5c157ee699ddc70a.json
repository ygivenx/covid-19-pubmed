{"title": "Lectin-like Intestinal Defensin Inhibits 2019-nCoV Spike binding to ACE2", "body": "Coronavirus owns enveloped positive-stranded RNA encoding the spike (S) protein, envelope protein, membrane protein, and nucleoprotein. S protein is composed of 1160-1400 amino acids and presents as a trimer before membrane fusion 6 . Many S proteins can be divided into S1 and S2 subunits after degradation by protease 7 . The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and devotes to the initial viral attachment via recognizing a variety of host cell receptors, including aminopeptidase N (APN), angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), and sugar 8, 9, 10 . Since the sequence of 2019-nCoV S protein is 76.47% homology to that of SARS-CoV 11 , ACE2, which is identified as the crucial target for SARS-CoV, was also considered the host receptor of 2019-nCoV 12 . In fact, it was reported that host cells expressed ACE2, instead of APN and DPP4, were sensitive to 2019-nCoV 13, 14 . In vitro binding assay demonstrated that ACE2 enabled a potent interaction with 2019-nCoV S protein with an affinity of 14.7 nM 15 , which is 10-to 20-fold higher than that of ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S protein.\n\nauthor/funder.

As known, human intestinal epithelium encompasses approximately 200 m 2 of surface area 18 . Therefore, human intestine is conceivably susceptible to 2019-nCoV.\n\nHowever, the occurrence of intestinal symptoms is lower than that of respiratory symptoms as a whole. In 38 patients infected by 2019-nCoV, only one diarrhea case was found 19 . Recent meta-analysis supported that digestive symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were relatively rare compared with fever and cough 20 . These data indicate that intestinal epithelium is actually not so easy to be infected by 2019-nCoV as expected. The underlying reason is desirable to be explored.\n\nIt is well known that intestinal epithelium directly interacts with the external environment and encounters trillions of microorganisms including various viruses. To cope with the microbial threat, intestinal cells have evolved to produce a plenty of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to strengthen the mucosal barrier 21 . Defensin is a group of small (2-5 KD) and amphiphilic AMPs. Human defensins (HDs) are divided into two subgroups, \u03b1 and \u03b2, based on the amino acid sequence homology and disulfide connectivity. Paneth cells, the major secretory cells located in the crypts of small intestine, specifically secrete two kinds of \u03b1 defensins (HD5 and HD6) 22 . As reported, HD5 is the most abundant \u03b1 defensin in intestine 23 .\n\nDue to a lectin-like ability, HD5 can effectively bind lipids and glycosylated proteins 24,25 .\n\nBecause 2019-nCoV spike and ACE2 are both glycosylated proteins, there is a high possibility for HD5 to interact with 2019-nCoV spike or ACE2 or both of them and thereby disturb viral entry into host cells.\n\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that HD5 displayed a strong ability to prevent 2019-nCoV S1 to bind to intestinal epithelial cells by blocking the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ACE2. Our findings unmasked the innate defense function of intestinal HD5 against 2019-nCoV, which may benefit the on-going development of preventive and therapeutic drugs.\n\nIntestinal defensins are concentrated in the mucus layer after being secreted by Paneth cells and can contact with ACE2 receptor that locates on the brush border of the enterocytes 16, 21, 26 . author/funder.

The affinity of HD5 binding to recombinant human ACE2 immobilized on AR2G biosensors was 39.3 nM ( Figure 1A ), whereas no association signal was observed for HD6 ( Figure 1B) . The binding affinity of HD5 was much higher than that of a hexapeptide inhibitor, 438 YKYRYL 443 , derived from the RBD of SARS-CoV spike protein (46 \u03bcM) 27 . We previously discovered that HD5 is reduced to linear peptide, HD5 RED , under the catalysis of thioredoxin system in vivo 28, 29 . Interestingly, BLI revealed that similar to HD6, HD5 RED failed to bind ACE2 ( Figure 1C ). The structure-dependent interaction of HD5 with ACE2 is consistent with that cysteine replacement impairs the bactericidal and immunoregulatory efficiencies of HD5 30,31 , which expands the known roles of disulfide pairings in keeping the conformation of defensins.\n\nThe interaction between 2019-nCoV S1 and ACE2 was measured as well. The purified S1 expressed by human HEK293 cells intensively bound ACE2 with an affinity of 2.68 nM ( Figure 1D ). This assay conforms to the fact that virus forwardly contact ACE2 located on the cell surface and may avoid the steric hindrance of a receptor binding to its ligand. We reversely loaded S1 and measured the recruitment of ACE2. As shown in Figure S1 , the binding thickness was low, whereas the affinity (3.8 nM) was comparable to that of S1 binding to ACE2. Also, we noticed that the S1-ACE2 affinity was higher than those of S-ACE2 and RBD-ACE2 interactions 15, 32 . The discrepancy may be attributed to different proteins employed in different experiments.\n\nHD5 is constitutively expressed in vivo and acts as a peptide \"ranger\" regulating the intestinal microbiota 33 . The storage volume of HD5 in Paneth cells has been estimated 90-450 mg/cm 2 of ileal surface area 22 . In ileal fluid, HD5 content is quantified to 6-30 \u00b5g/mL 34 . Such a large dose of HD5 in intestine provides a possibility that it may capture ACE2 before 2019-nCoV lands to enterocytes, although the affinity of S1-ACE2 interaction is higher than that of HD5 binding to ACE2. To evaluate the effect of HD5 coating on ACE2 interacting with S1, a blocking experiment was conducted by monitoring the bindings of S1 to ACE2 covered with different doses of HD5. As shown in Figure 1E , HD5 lowered the thickness of S1 binding to ACE2, indicative of a protective role of this peptide on viral adhesion. As HD5 is lectin-like peptide with multivalent binding ability 24 , we asked if HD5 could bind and block author/funder. All rights reserved.

The affinity of HD5 binding to S1 was 82.8 nM (Figure 2A ), as revealed by BLI.\n\nNevertheless, HD5 had less of an effect on ACE2-S1 interaction ( Figure 2B) , possibly due to a binding site distant from the RBD. Recent studies have discovered some antibodies and peptides with high affinities binding to the spike 32, 35 . These candidates are placed hopes on suppressing 2019-nCoV. Of note, our findings imply that the binding affinity alone is insufficient to predict the therapeutic potential of drugs.\n\nX-ray crystal diffraction has resolved the detailed structure of 2019-nCoV RBD bound with ACE2 at 2.45 \u00c5 resolution, in which 20 residues of N-terminal ACE2 constitute the LBD 36 .\n\nFor deeper insights into the ACE2 blocking of HD5, we carried out a molecular dynamic simulation, in which HD5 was docked onto the LBD of ACE2. After 20 ns of simulation, the complex conformation kept stable with residue fluctuations smaller than 0.11 nm in five trajectories relative to the starting coordinates ( Figure S2A ). HD5 formed many potent H-bonds with ACE2, which average number is 5-6 and the max number is 12 in an average To validate the inhibitive effect of HD5 on 2019-nCoV S1 binding to ACE2, we further conducted a cell experiment, in which human intestinal epithelium Caco-2 cells were exposed to 8 \u00b5g/mL of 2019-nCoV S1. Confocal microscopy observed that S1 largely adhered to the cell surface in the absence of HD5 (Figure 4 , Figure S3 ). Nevertheless, when cells were author/funder. All rights reserved.

The content of S1 binding to the cells preincuabted with HD5 was 3.4-fold lower than that binding to the cells without treatment ( Figure 5B) . Notably, the protection of HD5 was in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5C ). As shown in Figure 5D , HD5 could significantly decrease S1 binding to epithelial cells at concentrations as low as 10 \u00b5g/mL, which is within the range of HD5 concentration in intestine 22 . The protective effect of HD5 was also observed for human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells abundant in ACE2 ( Figure   S4 ) 16, 17 . However, S1 pretreated with HD5 was still efficient to contact Caco-2, as revealed by either immunoblotting or immunofluorescence. These data are in line with the results shown in Figure 1E and 2B, demonstrating that HD5 inhibits 2019-nCoV S1 adhering to host cells possibly by blocking ACE2 but not S1.

BLI-based blocking assay was conducted by monitoring the binding thickness of S1-ACE2 interaction with the interference of HD5. S1 and ACE2 were loaded on HIS1K and AR2G biosensors, respectively, at a concentration of 15 \u03bcg/mL. The immobilized ACE2 was incubated with 200 and 50 nM HD5 for 300 s at 30 o C. After a 300 s of disassociation, the signals of 400 nM S1 binding to ACE2 were recorded for another 300 s. Otherwise, the immobilized S1 was covered with 100 nM HD5 for 300 s. The bindings of 100 nM ACE2 to S1 were recorded for 300 s after peptide disassociation. 44 ) and the LBD of ACE2 (PDB: 6ACG 45 ) was performed on ZDOCK server 46 . The Gromacs 2020 software package 47 , AMBER99SB-ILDN force field, and TIP3P water model were applied for the simulation with a time step of 2 fs. Firstly, 1000-step minimization was carried out. Then, for fully relaxation, four 1-ns pre-equilibration simulation with restrained coordinates of the atoms belonging to the heavy atoms, main chain, backbone, and C-\u03b1, respectively, were performed step by step. Finally, each of five production simulation with isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble at 1 atm and 298 K was performed for 20 ns. The binding free energy was author/funder. All rights reserved.

The binding free energy was calculated using 500 snapshots sampled every 10 ps from total 5 ns trajectory. Western blot. Caco-2 cells were seeded into a 6-well plate at a density of 1\u00d710 6 cells/well. Cells preincubated with different concentrations of HD5 (10, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/mL) at 37 o C for 15 min were exposed to 20 \u03bcg/mL of 2019-nCoV S1 containing His-tag at 4 o C for 1 h. After three times of wash with PBS, cells were collected and processed with RIPA lysis and extraction buffer (89900, Thermo Fisher Scientific). S1 content was measured by determining the band thickness as we previously described 50 . A primary anti-His-tag mouse monoclonal antibody (AF5060, Beyotime, 1:1000) and a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (A0216, Beyotime, 1:2000) were employed to detect S1. \u03b2-actin determined by a mouse monoclonal antibody (AA128, Beyotime, 1:1000) was used as a reference.\n\nvia the internet at https://www.biorxiv.org/. author/funder.
