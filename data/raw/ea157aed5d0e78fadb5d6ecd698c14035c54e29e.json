{"title": "Multifaceted roles for lipids in viral infection", "body": "The importance of cellular lipids in viral infection has long been appreciated, particularly in regards to membrane fusion during the entry process and virion envelopment during particle maturation. More recently, our view of the roles of lipids in viral infection has greatly expanded. We now recognize that lipids organize the subcellular localization of key events in the viral life cycle. Viruses encode proteins that co-opt lipid signaling and synthesis machinery to remodel the host cell in order to establish protected sites of replication and generate excess lipids for envelopment. Furthermore, there are numerous mechanisms for how viruses modulate host cell lipid metabolism to promote efficient viral replication.\n\nThe focus of this review will be on recent publications that describe viral modulation of lipid metabolism, lipid composition, or lipid signaling to facilitate increased viral entry, replication or assembly/secretion. Due to space limitations, it is impossible to have an exhaustive discussion of this topic and thus, we will concentrate on specific examples to demonstrate concepts. An emerging theme is that uncovering new viral-lipid interactions not only enhances our understanding of the virus-host interaction, it expands antiviral therapeutic approaches to include drugs that target lipid metabolism.\n\nCellular lipid membranes are the first barrier to viral infection of the host cell and an important initial point of interaction for viruses. In some cases, viruses can exploit lipids to use them as viral receptors (Figure 1a ). For non-enveloped viruses, the viral capsid can interact directly with specific components of host cell membranes, usually glycosphingolipids, as receptors to initiate infection (reviewed in [1] ). Polyomaviruses, for example, bind glycosphingolipids upon association with a host cell and the specific bound ganglioside will determine the internalization pathway used [2, 3] . Alternatively, lipid trafficking receptors can function as indirect viral receptors (Figure 1b) . Members of the Flaviviridae, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and bovine viral diarrheal virus (BVDV), have been shown to require functional low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) for viral entry [4, 5] . Although there are additional high-affinity receptors known to be required for HCV entry, the requirement for an early, low-affinity, LDL-R interaction is likely a reflection of virion association with apolipoproteins which serves to bring the virus in proximity to other entry cofactors (reviewed in [6] ) (Figure 1b) . Similarly, the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) is an HCV receptor that is known to interact with the highdensity lipoprotein HDL [7] . Although the viral glycoproteins directly interact with SR-BI, there is evidence that HDL/HCV/SR-B1 interactions can also influence the infectivity of HCV (reviewed in [8] ).\n\nMany viral processes require specific lipid compositions in distinct compartments for appropriate membrane composition and dynamics. Lipid microenvironments influence the entry of some viruses, frequently by influencing the clustering of receptors in cholesterolrich subdomains (Figure 1c ). Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) fails to enter host cells that have been depleted for cholesterol via treatment with \u03b2-cyclodextran [9] , implicating a lipid as a required cofactor for HIV-1 entry. Further mechanistic work showed that cholesterol is essential to bring the viral receptors into proximity and initiate the entry complex formation [10] . Cellular lipid microdomains are similarly required for murine coronavirus entry [11] and pseudorabies virus entry [12] . In addition, some viruses require cholesterol in the viral envelope for efficient viral entry. This has been reported for influenza A virus [13] and human herpes virus 6 [11] , however, the exact role for viral envelope cholesterol remains unclear.\n\nEndocytic events frequently require lipid signaling. Many viruses rely on phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase signaling for their appropriate internalization (reviewed in [14] ). Following internalization, virions can be sorted into appropriate endosomal compartments from which they eventually fuse out. Specific lipids can influence the compartment of virion uncoating (Figure 1d ). Recent work on dengue virus (DENV) has shown that virus fusion with late endosomes is specifically induced by the presence of a late endosome-specific lipid species bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate [15] . Interestingly, low pH alone is ineffective in stimulating viral fusion in the absence of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate. Similarly, alphaviruses require cholesterol and sphingolipids for optimal viral endosomal fusion, [reviewed in 16] . Thus, specific lipid species appear to influence the ability of viruses to initiate infection at multiple stages of the viral entry process.\n\nViruses that replicate in the cytosol have a shared requirement for reorganizing cellular membranes to establish sites of replication. While the morphology of these structures may be different, they are thought to serve three major purposes: (i) provide a physical scaffold on which the viral replicase can assemble, (ii) increase the local concentration of the viral and cellular cofactors required for replication, and (iii) provide a protected environment that limits recognition of viral protein and nucleic acid by the innate immune system. Positivestranded RNA viruses can form replication complexes from different cytosolic membrane sources including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, endosomes and/or lysosomes, and mitochondria; and their mechanism of formation likely differs [reviewed in 17, 18] . The importance of the source of membrane is unclear. At least in the case of Flock House virus (FHV), replication is not perturbed by targeting replication complex formation to an abnormal sub-cellular location [19] . Advances in electron tomography have allowed the first appreciation of the three-dimensional structure of viral replication factories [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . For these viruses, the replication membranes are contiguous with either the ER or mitochondria.\n\nThey are severely remodeled, producing enclosed pockets or invaginations for the viruses to replicate inside, with a neck to release the RNA, frequently into an associated virion assembly compartment. Other viruses, such as HCV and the picornaviruses, appear to have a different structure involving the potential clustering of heterogeneous vesicles (reviewed in [17, 18] ).\n\nResearch into the mechanism of membrane remodeling has advanced at a slower pace. Initially, the question of how membranes were reorganized was addressed by identifying the viral requirements for the formation of these membrane structures. Individual viral proteins were overexpressed in cells, which were then examined by electron microscopy to identify membrane structures that resemble those found in infected cells. This approach has identified HCV NS4B [26, 27] , flavivirus NS4A [28, 29] and enterovirus non-structural protein 2BC, possibly along with the 3A protein [30] [31] [32] [33] as being capable of inducing membrane alterations. The exact mechanism by which these viral proteins alter membrane organization however, is generally unclear. Further complexities have been revealed by work on brome mosaic virus (BMV), which has shown that not only the viral proteins but their interactions and relative expression levels can lead to different membrane morphologies [34] .\n\nWhile viral proteins clearly contribute to the formation of these membrane structures, there is an increasing appreciation for the roles of cellular cofactors. Specifically, much work has been done on cellular cofactors that have functions in host lipid-membrane metabolism. Both enteroviruses and HCV appear to co-opt lipid signaling to influence the formation of these structures (Figure 2a) . It has been shown by several groups that host genes involved in phosphatidylinositol (PI) signaling influence HCV and enterovirus replication [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . These reports have lead to a model wherein the modulation of these lipid signaling molecules directs cellular membrane trafficking to coalesce with viral proteins to generate replication complex (RC) formation [41] . HCV infection or NS5A expression stimulates cellular PI4P production by the PI4-kinase III-alpha [42] . This activity is required for the formation of appropriate membrane RCs. Enteroviruses require the related PI4-kinase IIIbeta. Further, the enteroviral RNA polymerase 3D pol physically binds PI4P, which could influence both its association with cellular membranes and its ability to synthesize RNA ( Figure 2a ) [40] .\n\nHost cofactors can facilitate the formation of viral RCs either by structurally supporting membrane curvature or by generating components of the RCs. BMV engages reticulon homology domain proteins, which function to physically induce membrane curvature, and are required for RC formation (Figure 2b ) [43] . In addition to reticulon interactions, BMV requires membrane lipid processing events to facilitate the formation of fully functional RCs [44, 45] . The host gene OLE1, which introduces a double bond into an unsaturated fatty acid tail, is required for viral replication by altering the membrane fluidity and plasticity of membranes for viral replication complexes (Figure 2d ).\n\nViruses not only require certain lipid compositions for RC formation, but they can also stimulate de novo lipid synthesis (Figure 2c,d) . In West Nile virus (WNV) infection, the cholesterol synthesizing enzyme 3-hydroxy-methyglutaryl-CoA reductase as well as cellular cholesterol are redistributed to viral RCs during replication [46] . The related DENV also depends on cholesterol biosynthesis [47] . In addition to the importance of cholesterol, DENV NS3 recruits the cellular enzyme fatty acid synthase to sites of viral replication and stimulates its activity to synthesize fatty acids [48] . A major theme of these studies is that simply inducing membrane curvature is likely insufficient to create the functional replication complexes seen in viral replication. There are additional requirements for altering both the total membrane content and specific lipid composition that impact membrane fluidity. A second emerging theme is that the formation of these structures might not simply be the function of one viral protein. Although HCV NS4B expression drives membrane remodeling, NS5A modulation of PI4-kinase activity clearly influences the process [42] . Similarly, DENV NS3 modulation of fatty acid synthesis likely influences the ability of NS4A to drive formation of RC structures.\n\nWhile it is intuitive that lipids can play physical roles in virally-induced membrane rearrangements, their utility is not limited to that arena. Lipid post-translational modifications of viral proteins and cellular cofactors are important for productive infection. The roles of post-translational lipid modifications with some viral examples is reviewed in [49] . Using HCV as an example, it has been shown that the viral protein NS4B is palmitoylated in an overexpression system [50] and this palmitoylation is required for viral replicase formation. Additionally, palmitoylation of the HCV core protein is required for viral particle formation [51] . Geranylageranylation of the host cofactor FBL2 is also required for HCV replication [52] . This gave hope that drugs targeting cholesterol synthesis such as statins could be useful for treating HCV infection. Although successful in inhibiting HCV replication in vitro, this approach only modestly improves sustained viral response in patients [53] .\n\nAn emerging topic in virology is the reprogramming of cellular metabolism to facilitate viral replication. Metabolomic analysis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection showed that metabolites involved in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis as well as transcripts for genes involved in these processes were markedly increased [54, 55] . There were also specific lipid metabolism changes; in particular, there was an increase in the flux of metabolites channeled into fatty acid biosynthesis pathway [56] . The authors further showed that inhibiting fatty acid biosynthesis inhibited CMV infection and thus identified a possible antiviral target. James Alwine and colleagues discuss the metabolic changes in CMV infection in much greater detail in another review in this themed issue [57] . Another herpesvirus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus, provokes similar changes in cellular metabolism that resemble the Warburg effect, which is an increase in aerobic glycolysis and a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation, as part of its latent infection [58] .\n\nMicroarray analyses of HCV infected cells showed that there are significant changes in the expression of genes involved in biosynthesis, degradation, and transport of intracellular lipids [59] . Interestingly, proteomic analysis of infected cells revealed that many of the key regulators of lipid metabolism reprogramming were found to be post-transcriptionally regulated [60] . For example, the proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation have increased abundance in HCV infected cells but show no differential regulation in microarray studies. Complementary lipidomic analysis of HCV infected cells also revealed that there were changes in select lipid species (e.g. phospholipids and sphingomyelins), which are predicted to play roles in viral replication as well as assembly and secretion events [60] . The authors of this study propose a model in which the infected cell is reprogrammed to maintain homeostasis and cell viability by modulating cellular metabolism to deal with the elevated energy demands during viral replication (Figure 3 ).\n\nThe mechanism by which HCV modulates lipid metabolism is partially understood. It has been shown that HCV infection or NS4B protein expression leads to the activation of transcription factors that stimulate the transcription of genes involved in sterol biosynthesis [61, 62] . These studies taken together indicate that alterations in lipid metabolism can occur via transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms and likely reflect complex regulation of lipid metabolism during HCV infection.\n\nLipids presumably can be mobilized for oxidation via canonical lipase pathways. Additionally, it was recently shown that DENV infection induces a form of autophagy that specifically targets lipid droplet stores. This results in the depletion of cellular triglycerides and the release of fatty acids, which are then transported to the mitochondria where they undergo \u03b2-oxidation to generate ATP [63] (Figure 3 ). In essence, DENV signals the infected cell to react to perceived starvation conditions, triggering a depletion of energy stores to stimulate robust viral replication. Thus, it appears that diverse viruses have evolved distinct mechanisms to modulate the metabolic state of the cell in order to facilitate viral replication.\n\nIn addition to being a source of energy, lipid droplets can function as sites of viral assembly. Lipid droplets are well characterized as the sites of HCV assembly [64] and have also been proposed to be involved in DENV assembly [65] . HCV core localizes to lipid droplets that are in proximity to ER-associated viral structural proteins. A current model is that HCV replication occurs at the membranous web discussed earlier and then nascent RNA is transported to lipid droplets by the viral replicase proteins NS3 and NS5A. Assembly of viral RNA into capsids is thought to occur at lipid droplets and require the viral NS2 and p7 proteins [66] . It is thought that assembly at lipid droplets might influence lipid-associated secretion of HCV (discussed later). Interestingly, HCV core protein expression enhances the accumulation of lipid droplets in the peri-nuclear region. This phenomenon appears to be genotype specific and linked to assembly efficiency [67] . One possible mechanism for core and lipid droplet association is an interaction of HCV core with DGAT-1, which promotes lipid droplet formation [68] .\n\nFor viruses that bud at the plasma membrane, lipids play a central role in organizing this event. HIV budding occurs at the plasma membrane at specific lipid microdomains rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids called lipid rafts [69] . These lipid rafts are actively modulated by HIV, which increases cholesterol synthesis in infected cells and traffics it to lipid rafts [70] (Figure 4a ). Lipid signaling also helps organize HIV budding sites by recruiting the major HIV structural protein, Gag. The localization of Gag to lipid rafts at the plasma membrane is dependent on the interactions of the Gag protein with the lipid signaling molecule PI-(4,5)-bisphosphate, which is enriched at the plasma membrane [71] [72] [73] . The lipid interaction with Gag is thought to ensure the appropriate subcellular localization of the viral structural protein for virion assembly and budding. Similarly, the trafficking of influenza viral glycoproteins to the plasma membrane and subsequent budding depends on the interaction of viral components with lipid microdomains [74] .\n\nIn addition to forming a scaffold or organizing center for viral assembly, lipids can be actively synthesized to provide membranes for viral envelopment. The enhanced fatty acid biosynthesis that occurs during CMV infection discussed earlier is thought to contribute to virion budding by increasing available membranes [56] . It is also important to note that any kind of membrane modulations that influence viral replication (such as those described earlier for DENV) could also play additional roles in virion envelopment, since these compartments are frequently spatially linked.\n\nA final step in the budding of enveloped viruses is membrane scission to release progeny virions. There are two major characterized pathways, those that are ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport)-dependent and those that are ESCRT-independent, whereby viral proteins can induce the membrane curvature required for release of the virus (Figure 4a) . HIV secretion is a well-characterized example of an ESCRT-dependent pathway. HIV encodes proteins which contain 'L' or 'late' domains [reviewed in 75] which interact with ESCRT machinery leading to release of the virus [reviewed in 76]. The ESCRT pathway normally functions to generate endosomal vesiculation, which leads to the formation of multi-vesicular bodies. It appears that this cellular machinery performs a similar function to facilitate the budding of HIV. This has been characterized as the canonical budding pathway for late-domain containing viruses.\n\nIn contrast, influenza A virus does not appear to require host machinery for membrane scission; instead, a viral protein performs the same function. It was recently shown that the influenza protein M2 localizes to the 'neck' of budding virions and is necessary and sufficient for budding in the absence of ESCRT machinery (Figure 4b ) [77] . This requires an amphipathic helix of M2 that induces membrane curvature, which is thought to result in membrane scission. A number of other viruses have been characterized to use late domains for viral budding (reviewed in [78] ). It will be interesting to see whether those viruses without obvious late domains use a mechanism similar to influenza A.\n\nLipids and lipid trafficking can also play roles in virus secretion and influence the infectivity of released virions. The best characterized model for lipid-associated egress is HCV, which appears to use the VLDL secretion machinery to facilitate its exit from cells (reviewed in [79] ). HCV virions display a broad density range, with the low density lipid associated fractions being the most highly infectious [80] . Recently, the lipidomic profile of HCV virions was determined, which closely resembles that of low and very-low density lipoproteins [81] . HCV that was isolated from infected patients contained components of the VLDL machinery, including apolipoproteins (Apo) B and E [82] . Further, knockdown of ApoB and ApoE decreased the amount of intracellular as well as secreted infectious virus indicating that apolipoproteins play a role in both secretion and infectivity [83, 84] . Thus, the lipids required for HCV secretion also influence the characteristics of the mature virion that allow for enhanced entry of the virus.\n\nIt was recently written that the 1990s was the decade of DNA, the 2000s the decade of RNA, and the 2010s could be that of the lipid [85] . We feel that this could not be truer for the field of virology. Research interests are frequently shaped by the availability of tools, and we have an increasingly potent arsenal to study the manipulation of lipids by viral infection. As always, the challenge will be to apply this technology to unmask the underlying mechanisms of virus-host interaction. An appealing outgrowth of this research is the concept of broadspectrum anti-viral therapeutics that target lipid metabolism. As an example, many viruses require active fatty acid biosynthesis. Existing FDA-approved drugs target this pathway and could be adapted to serve as broad spectrum antiviral therapeutics. Since these drugs target host proteins, they could prove less susceptible to the development of viral drug resistance.\n\nMuch work remains to be done to better appreciate viral-lipid interactions. Many of the studies have relied heavily on drug or RNA interference inhibition of a lipid metabolic process to determine whether or not it is required during viral infection. However, only rarely have the essential lipid or lipid species been identified. Additionally, even in cases where we can identify distinct lipid species that are modified during viral infection, the proposed mechanism for how they contribute to viral replication is often left to speculation. Questions remain as to why specific lipid species are required, in addition to their physical orientation and biochemical function within these complexes. Finally, most of the studies described here have focused on the virus-cell interaction. Much remains to be determined how alterations in cellular metabolism influence the host response to viral infection on an organismal level, from hormone production to immune responses. With increased research in this area, our understanding of how and why lipids are manipulated in the host cell continues to expand. This not only increases our basic understanding of virology and cell biology, but could also have practical implications for novel antiviral agents.\n\n(a) Lipids as direct viral receptors. The viral protein coat of non-enveloped viruses, such as polyomaviruses, can associate with lipids on the cell surface [1] . In many cases these lipids display a carbohydrate moiety (brown) that directly interacts with the viral protein coat (yellow). This interaction leads to internalization of the virus and the initiation of infection. (b) Lipid receptors as indirect viral receptors. Viruses (yellow) such as HCV and BVDV, which associate with LDL in the blood, can be brought into proximity of a target cells via the association between LDL and its receptor (LDL-R) [4, 5] . Subsequently, interaction with high-affinity cell surface viral receptors (orange) facilitates infection. (c) Lipids as entry cofactors. Lipids can modulate the ability of a virus to enter the cell post-receptor interactions. Many viruses (yellow) such as influenza, HIV, and Ebola virus enter cells at lipid microdomains (orange) or require lipid microdomains for some step of viral entry (reviewed in [86] ). (d) Lipids as viral fusion cofactors. Some viruses (yellow), such as DENV utilize specific lipids (green) in order to stimulate viral envelope fusion with the target membranes [15] . (a) Phosphoinositide signaling. Phosphoinositides (PIs) are negatively charged lipids with a specific head-group that can be phosphorylated at different positions to generate PIphosphates (PIPs). PIPs can direct cellular signaling in a pro-viral manner or directly bind viral proteins during HCV and enterovirus infection [40, 42] . (b) Membrane curvature. There are several ways in which viruses can induce membrane curvature. First, the virus can cause the accumulation of cone shaped lipids (such as lysophosphatidylcholine, LPC) in one leaflet of the membrane bilayer, which can lead to membrane bending (top). Second, the virus can encode a membrane-associated protein that induces membrane curvature (e.g. HCV NS4B and flavivirus NS4A, middle) [26, 28] . Third, the virus can utilize host membrane proteins that induce membrane curvature, such as reticulons (RTNs, bottom) [43] , which have been shown to be required for BMV membrane re-arrangements. It is important to note that these are not mutually exclusive and a virus could use several strategies to accomplish membrane bending. (c) Membrane expansion. WNV and DENV actively recruit lipid biosynthetic machinery to generate lipids at sites of replication [46, 48] . This helps form the replication complexes. Further, membrane expansion might be important in generating lipids for the viral envelope. (d) Membrane dynamics. Viruses, such as DENV or WNV which recruit lipid biosynthetic machinery to RCs can modulate membrane fluidity and plasticity of replication complex membranes by de-saturating lipid tails or leading to the accumulation of cholesterol as has been seen during BMV infection (a) Lipids in HIV assembly and release. HIV assembly and release requires specific lipids at multiple stages. Initially, the structural protein Gag is recruited to pre-budding sites by its association with the lipid phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) [72] . In addition, the membrane composition of these sites is specific, containing high amounts of sphingolipids and cholesterol [69] . As the virus begins to bud, there is significant membrane curvature that needs to be induced and then resolved, a process known as membrane scission. In the case of HIV, membrane scission is accomplished by co-opting cellular machinery known as the ESCRT machinery. The ESCRT complex facilitates membrane scission and the release of the virus [76] . (b) Lipids in influenza virus assembly and release. Influenza A similarly associates with specific lipid microdomains during the budding process, however, the mechanism of membrane scission is significantly different. Instead of utilizing the ESCRT complex, the virus genome encodes the M2 protein, which serves an analogous function to the ESCRT complex and facilitates viral budding without the requirement for host machinery [77] ."}
