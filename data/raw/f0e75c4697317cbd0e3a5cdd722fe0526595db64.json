The most common symptom at the illness onset was fever (82.6%), followed by dry non-ARDS patients (3.6%). The mortality rate in ARDS patients (49.1%) was also 1 9 6\n\nsignificantly higher than that in non-ARDS patients (8.9%). 0.06 ng/mL). Significant increased levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum fibrinogen, D- As shown in Figure 1 , the dynamic trajectory in nine laboratory parameters were 2 1 4 tracked on Day 1, 3, 7 and 14, respectively.

According to the severity of ARDS, we further analyzed the clinical features, concomitantly with the severity of ARDS (all P values <0.001). The levels of lactate, ARDS (all log-rank tests P >0.05).

The medical management of ARDS has advanced remarkably during the past decades to increased mortality in the front-line epidemic area during the early outbreak period. The epidemic spread knows no borders. We are deeply concerned about the current future, a multi-center and follow-up study with a larger cohort is eagerly warranted.
