{"title": "Integrative Bioinformatics Analysis Provides Insight into the Molecular Mechanisms of 2019-nCoV", "body": "In early December 2019, several cases of pneumonia with unknown causes were reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China (1) . Later, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV was identified based on sequencing of the patient respiratory tract samples. As of February 1, 2020, more than 10,000 confirmed patients and more than 15,000 suspected cases were reported in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. Analyzing of the genome of 2019-nCoV showed that this new virus shared around 80~90% sequence identity to SARS-CoV (2) . Both bioinformatics modeling and in vitro experiments indicated that 2019-nCoV was more likely to use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor (3, 4) . ACE2 is previously known as the receptor for SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 (5, 6) . Considering the sequence of 2019-nCoV is similar to the SRAS-CoV and they are reported to share the same molecular as the entry point, analyses of ACE2 expression and distribution in lung and related biological processes may help us understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV. Recent advances in bioinformatics enable researchers to reveal the underlying mechanisms of various diseases. In this study, we used bioinformatics approaches to identify the ACE2 expression features in lung and mine associated regulating networks. These results may help us understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV.\n\nAmong the 2019-nCoV infected patients, there are many patients with underlying diseases, such as chronic respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is important to evaluate whether patients with underlying diseases are more susceptible to coronavirus infection than healthy population. Firstly, we analyzed the expression of ACE2 in lung in the different populations. The expression level of ACE2 was not significantly altered between healthy populations and patients with chronic respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and asthma ( Figure 1A , 1B, and 1C, p-value > 0.05). It indicated that 2019-nCoV .

Thus, there may be no significant difference in the susceptibility of 2019-nCov infection between healthy population and patients with chronic respiratory diseases.\n\nSecondly, we found that the level of ACE2 expression was markedly upregulated in long-term smokers ( Figure 1D , p-value < 0.05). However, the p-value between baseline and post-acute smoke exposure (ASE) group (24 hours after smoking 3 cigarettes) was 0.073 ( Figure 1E ). It was assumed that the long-term smoking could elevate the expression of ACE2 and thus, increase the susceptibility to 2019-nCoV infection.\n\nThirdly, we analyzed the expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells after being infected with SARS-CoV. The result suggested that 24 hours after SARS-CoV infection, the expression of ACE2 dramatically increased compared to 12 hours. After 48 hours, the expression of ACE2 remained at a high level. This indicated that ACE2 not only played a critical role in viral susceptibility but also may be involved in post-infection regulation.\n\nTo investigate the virus-related potential biological processes associated with ACE2, we extracted the expression profiles of 15 healthy non-smokers from dataset GSE89809 and divided them into two groups: high and low-expression level of ACE2.\n\nWe performed GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) and found that the expression of ACE2 was mainly associated with innate and acquired immune responses, regulation of B cell mediated immunity, cytokine and IL-1\uff0cIL-10\uff0cIL-6\uff0cIL-8 secretion ( .

The biological process scores were obtained using GSVA (Gene Set Variation Analysis) and the pearson correlation between process scores and ACE2 expression was calculated. Similarly, while ACE2 increased after infection, production of cytokines, IL-1, IL-10 and IL-6 also increased, and the regulation of B cell activation was triggered to response. After 48 hours, virus activities such as viral entry into the host cell, virus life cycle, and viral transcription were enhanced. Besides, the T-cell cytokine secretion was increased, and T-cell activation was promoted ( Figure 2B ). Then, we used ssGSEA (Single Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) to quantify the immune infiltrates in healthy people epithelial cells and cells after infection. We found that in normal samples, the immune cells were not activated so that the correlation between infiltration and ACE2 expression was not significant ( Figure 2C ). However, in the SARS-CoV infected cells, the ACE2 was significantly correlated with neutrophils, NK cells, Th17 cells, Th2 cells, Th1 cells, DC ( Figure   2D ).\n\nConsidering higher expression of ACE2 was involved in mediating inflammatory responses, immune activities, and viral replication in both healthy individuals and infected cells, we further explored protein-protein regulation network in viral activity-related proteins and cytokine secretion, respectively. We extracted the viral activity-associated and cytokine secretion-associated proteins from the Gene ontology (GO) biological process gmt file. Construction of the Protein-protein interaction (PPI) showed that these proteins were tightly interactive among each other and we here exhibited the most significant PPI. In terms of viral activity, we found that \"viral gene expression\" proteins such as RPS3, RPS8 and PRS25 were the most important genes in the PPI network. In addition, VCP, LARP1, UBA52, PRKN, EIF3A and EIF3L\n\nwere also important in the network ( Figure 3A ). In terms of the cytokine secretion associated proteins, we found that proteins such as SRC, FN1, MAPK3, LYN, MBP, NLRC4, NLRP1 and PRKCD were Hub proteins in the regulating network of .

ACE2 is also related to adaptive immune responses (8) . In this current study, the GSEA analysis showed that the high expression of ACE2 was related to innate immune response, acquired immune response, B cell regulatory immunity and cytokine secretion, and enhanced the inflammatory response induced by IL-1, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8 cytokines. We speculated that the immune system dysfunction involved in the high expression of .

It was found that RPS3 played a key role in viral replication, and SRC non-receptor protein kinase was the hub gene in inflammatory response. It has been shown that RPS3 plays an important role in cell mitosis by interacting with \u03b1tubulin. When cells are infected with HIV-1, HIV-1 Tat protein can interact with RPS3 to disturb its localization on the spindle, and ultimately inhibit cell proliferation (10) .\n\nMoreover, the function of RPS3 depends on its own nuclear translocation, which is regulated by protein kinase like SRC (11) . We speculated that the increased expression of ACE2 affected RPS3 and SRC, which were the two hub genes involved in viral replication and inflammatory response.\n\nIn conclusion, 2019-nCoV infection is a serious public health problem, endangers human health seriously. Due to the strong human to human infectivity, it needs to be further studied. Our current study found that there was no significant difference in Note all results are based on data mining, thus, further experiments are needed.\n\nSix independent studies (GSE37758, GSE73395, GSE89809, GSE63127, GSE97010, and GSE14700), covering healthy volunteers, COPD patients, asthma patients, smoking individuals were collected from GEO data repository (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The samples consist of lung tissues, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial epithelial cells, small airway epithelial cells, and SARS infected cells.\n\n.
