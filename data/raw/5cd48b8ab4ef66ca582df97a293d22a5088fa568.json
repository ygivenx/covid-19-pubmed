In this study, a cryo-EM structure of 112 SADS-CoV S glycoprotein at 3.55 \u00c5 resolution is determined.\n\nCorrespondingly in the present investigation of SADS-CoV, we portrayed the 114 general structure of the S protein and the organization of its structural (Fig. 1A) . The size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) result showed that the 138 protein sample is a trimer in the solution and the purity of more than 95% 139 examined in SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. S1A, S1B) . The protein displayed high 140 homogeneity in cryo-EM screening and was then diluted to 0.63 mg ml -1 for 141 the data collection. Cryo-EM micrograph movies were collected on a Gatan 142 K2 direct electron detector mounted on an FEI Titan Krios electron 143 microscope (Fig. S2) . Following reference-free 2D classification of the S 144 protein, we determined a three-dimensional (3D) structure of the SADS-CoV 145 S trimer at 3.55 \u00c5 resolution judged by the gold-standard Fourier shell 146 correlation (FSC) criterion of 0.143 (Fig. 1B, 1C and Table 1 ). The resolved 147 atomic structure of prefusion SADS-CoV S ectodomain covers almost all of 148 the key structural elements, as shown in Fig. 1A except residues 81-101 of 149 NTD and residues 999-1068 of HR-C (Fig. 1D, Fig. S3 ).

The S 153 trimer shows a dome-like shape, with three S1 heads forming a crown-like 154 structure and sitting on top of a trimeric S2 stalk (Fig. 1D, 1E , and Movie S1). 155 The trimer spike has a length of 143.2 \u00c5 from S1 to S2 and a width of 111.3 \u00c5 156 and 61.4 \u00c5 at S1 and S2, respectively (Fig. 1E) . Three S1-CTDs are located 157 at the top center of the S trimer arranged as a small triangle, whereas three 158 S1-NTDs are located on the lower and outer side of S1-CTDs arranged as a 159 big triangle. This architecture, i.e., CTD sandwiched by its own NTD and the 160 adjacent NTD, comes into being one side of the big triangle (Fig. 1F) . The 161 cleavage site of S1 and S2 subunits locates between residues 544 (Val) and 162 545 (Arg). The central helicase N (CH-N) and C (CH-C) of S2 from each 163 subunit form a six-helix bundle in the core of S trimer. Heptad repeats N (HR-164 N) contains four helices connected by three loops locked between the S1 and 165 S2 subunit at the outside of the S2 stalk, while part of the HR-C is missed in 166 the structure (Fig. 1G) . Each monomeric subunit of S1 contains two major 167 domains, S1-NTD and S1-CTD which are used to bind attachment sialic acid 168 receptors or protein receptors and play a vital role in the CoV entry, and two 169 subdomains, SD1 and SD2 whose function are not very clear ( Fig. 1H-1I , 170 Movie S1). \n\n(H-I).

This kind of conformation represents an inactive state (Fig. 2H) . The 223 CTDs in our structure keep a \"lying down\" state, and the receptor-binding 224 moieties are partially concealed. It needs to \"stand up\" on the spike trimer and 225 release the steric clash for efficient receptor binding. The linker between 226 CTDs and S1 subdomains workes as a hinge to facilitate the conformation 227 change of CTDs from \"lying down\" to \"stand up\", furthermore, transit the 228 receptor-binding inactive state to active state (Fig. 2F) . 229 It is noteworthy that stronger interactions in the SADS-CoV S trimer may 230 become obstacle conformational change and dissociation of S1-CTD in the 231 prefusion process (Fig. S5) . Moreover, to probe the intrinsic mobility of the (Fig. S6) indicated that all the three CTDs/RBDs were stabilized 238 in a \"lying down\" state similar to the structure observed in this study, i.e. the 239 distance differences calculated from simulations and crystal structure were 240 less than 5 \u00c5. Although we did not find apparent expending of the CTDs/RBDs 241 from a \"lying down\" state to a \"stand up\" state during the simulations, it did not 242 .

Because such a 243 large conformational transition may happen over long time scales (ms to s), 244 far beyond the simulations performed here. Taken together, these simulation 245 results may explain the homogeneity of SADS-CoV S observed in our 3D 246 classification and that the different S1-CTD conformations are invisible in our 247 results (Fig. 1B) . 248 For the NTDs, the core structure consists of two six-stranded antiparallel 249 \u03b2 -sheet layers stacked together, which takes the same galectin fold as human 250 galectins and the NTDs from the other genera. Besides the core structure, 251 NTD of SADS-CoV S1 also has a loop (residues 133-150) formed as a partial CoV which has a reinforced ceiling-like structure ( Fig. 2I-M) . Based on the 255 structural similarity between the NTDs from four different CoVs genera, the 256 sugar-binding site in SADS-CoV S1-NTD might also be located in the pocket 257 formed between the core structure and the partial ceiling (Fig. 2I) . Compared 258 with other CoVs, the structure of the subdomain under the core domain of 259 SADS-CoV S1-NTD has the same situation as the partial ceiling-like structure 260 ( Fig. 2I-M) . The previous study gave the idea that NTDs from the four genera The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.976258 doi: bioRxiv preprint the structural evolution of SADS-CoV S1-NTD is more likely to located 265 between the other \u03b1 -CoVs, \u03b4 -CoVs, and \u03b3 -CoVs. 266 For the CTDs, despite there are dramatic sequential differences between 267 SADS-CoV S1-CTD and other CTDs, all of them share similar structural 268 topology (Fig. 2N-R) . Unlike the other CTDs of (Fig. 2N-R) . of CTDs as its receptor binding motif (RBM). As a result, we propose that 275 SADS-CoV also uses these loops on the CTD as its RBM (Fig. 2N-P) .

Hence, we propose that the SADS-CoV S1-CTD located 288 between the other \u03b1 -, \u03b4 -CoVs, and \u03b2 -CoVs CTDs on the evolutionary 289 spectrum (Fig. 2N-R) .

Taken together, these results 339 are consistent with that of the sequence alignment. Fig. 3B-3D ) and the CTDs of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV 353 and SADS-CoV (Fig. 3E) . Surprisingly, although SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV 354 and SADS-CoV CTD do not share significant sequence homology and belong 355 to a different family of CoVs (Fig. 3A) , they share roughly identical 356 organization and core folding (Fig. 3E) . Notably, SADS-CoV uses the variant On the one hand, the SADS-CoV S has a classical compact structure as 383 other \u03b1 -CoVs, which uses the intra-subunit packing mode ( Fig. 2A-2B) . As a 384 result, this kind of architecture can maximally reduce the surface area of the S 385 protein to the immune system. Moreover, all of the NTDs and CTDs in a \"lay 386 down\" station (closed conformation) can further reduce immune pressure 387 (Fig. 2F) . Nevertheless, the NTDs and CTDs still have the chance to expose 388 for receptor binding. Furthermore, they can also be selected as single-or two- They are mainly located on the surface of S1 rather than on S2 like HCoV-401 NL63 (Fig. 4A) . In contrast to that, HCoV-NL63 S evades host immune 402 surveillance mainly by glycan shielding its S2 epitopes, SADS-CoV spike 403 appears to evade host immune surveillance mainly by glycan shielding its S1 linked glycosylation sites are located on the CTD (Fig. 4A-4B) .

In the native state, only interactions between S1-CTD and S1-671 NTD of neighbor monomer are visible in SARS-CoV S (dotted circle in panel 672 A). S1-CTD is dissociated from S1-trimer when binding ACE2 in the prefusion 673 state. While in SADS-CoV spike, three interaction regions are visible in the 674 native state (dotted circles in panel B), including S1-CTD and S1-NTD of 675 neighbor monomer, internal S1-CTD and S1-NTD, S1-CTD trimer.
