Like other immunophilins, CypA has a high binding affinity to the immunosuppressor cyclosporin A (CsA), and CsA inhibits peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of CypA. 3, 4 CypA is widely distributed in various tissues, and expressed in highest concentration in the brain. 5 This makes it important in the maturation and folding of neuron-specific proteins in vivo, even though the details of its functional mechanisms are largely unknown. It is reported that CsA can regulate the level of CypA in both undifferentiated and cAMP-induced differentiated murine neuroblastoma (NB) cells in culture. 6 When treated with CsA, the NB cell can partially differentiate into neurons, which implicates a role for CypA in neuronal differentiation. 6 Therefore, CypA ligands might hold great potential for the treatment of nerve injuries and neurological disease.\n\nCsA is a natural fungal cyclic undecapeptide metabolite and has been used as an immunosuppressant drug for the prevention of organ rejection after transplant operations. 7 The CsA-induced immunosuppression has been tentatively explained and related to CypA. It is believed that the immunosuppressive action is exercised by the ternary complexes, namely the CsA/CypA complex inhibits the calcineurin (CN) activity, which plays a key role in the signal transduction pathway towards the T-cell activation. Inhibition of CN might prevent dephosphorylation of the cytosolic component of the transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT), and prevent its movement into the nucleus where it is critical for the production of immunosignalling cytokines, including interleukin 2, thus leading to the suppression of T-cell activation. [8] [9] [10] [11] CypA is also required for the infectious activity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] The gag of HIV is a polyprotein and cleaved by proteases into several functional proteins: matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), and small peptides. 18, 19 The HIV CA protein is essential for the assembly and infectivity of HIV virions. 16, 18, 20, 21 CypA binds directly to the CA domain of gag, with a CA-CypA stoichiometry of approximately 10:1 per virion. 13, 14, 22, 23 Formation of the CA-CypA complex is competitively inhibited by molecules that bind to the active site of CypA, including CsA and its nonimmunosuppressive analogue SDZ NIM 811. 12, 24 This complex formation can also be inhibited by a series of mutations at the N-terminus of CA. Reagents and mutations that inhibit the CA/CypA interaction in vitro also block CypA packaging and HIV-1 replication in culture, demonstrating that this interaction is essential for viral infectivity. [13] [14] [15] 25 Recently, we found that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV binds to human CypA with high affinity, and the equilibrium dissociation (K D ) is 100-2700 times higher than the binding affinity of HIV-1 CA to CypA. 26 Sequence alignment and molecular modeling revealed that SARS-CoV N loop Trp302-Pro310 fits into the active site groove of CypA through hydrogen bonding, cation-p and -CH\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1p hydrogen bonding interactions. This observed SARS-CoV N/CypA interaction might provide a new hint for the understanding of a possible SARS-CoV infection pathway against human cell, and further supply a feasible approach for anti-SARS agent screening.\n\nTaken together, CypA is involved in many diseases and virus invasion, drug discovery efforts have focused on the development of CypA inhibitors for pharmaceutical research. In the current work, we reported a novel quinoxaline derivative, 2,3-di(furan-2-yl)-6-(3-N,Ndiethylcarbamoyl-piperidino)carbonylamino quinoxa-line (DC838, 3), which was confirmed to be a potent human CypA inhibitor, and in vivo assay results showed its high inhibition activity against mouse spleen cell proliferation. To further elucidate DC838 binding to CypA at the atomic level, molecular docking simulation on CypA/DC838 binding was also well performed. Both the experimental and computational results should provide useful information in the discovery of immunosuppressor targeting CypA, and the discovered active compound DC838 might be used as a possible lead compound for further research.\n\nGenerally, compound DC838 was prepared according to the synthetic strategy outlined in Scheme 1. 6-Amino-2,3-di(furan-2-yl)quinoxaline (1) was obtained according to the literature method. 27 Reaction of (1) with triphosgene under nitrogen at room temperature in the presence of triethylamine afforded 2,3-di(furan-2-yl)-6-isocyanatoquinoxaline 28 (2) . The target compound (3, DC838) was synthesized by the reaction of N,N-diethylnipecotamide 29 with (2). The structure was confirmed with IR, 1 H NMR and MS spectral analyses.\n\nTo address the kinetic data of compound DC838 binding to CypA, the SPR technology based Biacore 3000 instrument was used. Immobilization of CypA on the Biacore biosensor chip resulted in a resonance signal of 5370 resonance units (RUs). As shown in Figure 1 , the biosensor RUs of DC838 were concentration-dependent, suggesting that DC838 can bind to CypA in vitro. The 1:1 Langmuir binding model was thus used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ), the association (k on ) and dissociation (k off ) rate constants by Eqs. 1 and 2.\n\nwhereR represents the response unit, C is the concentration of the analyte, and\n\nThe obtained results were evaluated by v 2 , the statistical value in Biacore. All the kinetic parameters are listed in Table 1 . The SPR results showed that compound DC838 exhibited strong binding affinity against CypA with K D value of 7.09 lM. This K D value is found to be in good agreement with the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K 0 D ) from the intrinsic fluorescence titration analysis and IC 50 values in the cyclophilin PPIase activity inhibition determination, further suggesting that SPR assay is a powerful and useful method for screening CypA inhibitors.\n\nAs stated in the published results, 30,31 the trytophan residue (Trp121) around the CypA binding site could be used as an intrinsic probe for studying the interaction between CypA and its ligand. Therefore, we investigated the binding affinity of compound DC838 against CypA by using the published intrinsic fluorescence titration technique. 31 During the assay, a 1:1 stoichiometry of CypA/compound binding was performed according to the published result for CypA/CsA interaction. 32, 33 The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K 0 D ) for CypA/DC838 binding was thus calculated according to the literature method. 31 It is assumed that 50% occupancy of CypA is set at a fractional fluorescence change of 0.5 (FC 0.5 ), then at this point the concentration of the bound ligand equals to the bound protein, the half of the total concentration of protein. Accordingly, K 0 D is equal to the total ligand concentration at FC 0.5 minus the concentration of the bound protein. 31 Figure 2 shows the typical tryptophan fluorescence quenching of CypA induced by the titration of DC838 with an increasing concentration. Since compound DC838 itself does not show any intrinsic fluorescence absorption, its possible effect on the experiments could be neglected. Obviously, the evaluated K 0 D value at 3.78 lM is compatible to the K D value by Biacore 3000. Moreover, as indicated in Figure 2 and Table 2 , the fact that DC838 can perturb CsA binding to CypA during the competition assay by shifting the K 0 D to 10.05 lM for CypA binding to CsA implicates that both DC838 and CsA bind to CypA in the same binding pocket. This is in agreement with the molecular docking analysis result of this work, as will be discussed blow.\n\nSince CypA belongs to the family of peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase), the classic spectrophotometric method 34 could be used to determine the PPIase inhibition activity of the tested compound against CypA. During the assay, the rate constants for the cis-trans interconversion were evaluated by fitting the data to the integrated first-order rate equation through nonlinear least-square analysis. 34, 35 CsA was tested as a positive control for assay assessment, in which the IC 50 of CsA against CypA was figured out as 61.4 nM (Fig. 3) , which is in agreement with the previous result. The inhibition result for the compound DC838 against CypA PPIase activity in a series of concentrations was demonstrated in Figure 3 , the IC 50 value was thus determined as 0.41 lM, which is comparable with the Biacore and fluorescence titration analytical results (Tables 1  and 2 ). These results thereby further imply the reliability of these three detection approaches.\n\nTo test the immunosuppressive effects of DC838, the anti-proliferation activity on the mouse spleen cells of this compound has been determined. During the assay, CsA was used as a control for evaluation of DC838 inhibition activity. As demonstrated in Figure 4 , the inhibition of the proliferation of spleen cells results with the increase of the compound concentration, and the IC 50 values of CsA and DC838 were found to be 1.03 lM and 4.32 lM, respectively.\n\nTo investigate the possible compound toxicity for CsA and DC838 against the spleen cell, the effects on the cell caused by the treatment for 72 h with CsA or DC838 at 100 lM and 10 lM were assayed (0.106 and 0.113 in OD 540 at 100 lM to 10 lM of CsA against 0.173 for medium, P < 0.01; 0.136 in OD 540 at 100 lM of DC838 against 0.173 for medium, P < 0.05). It is noticed that the treatments with CsA both at 100 lM and 10 lM and DC838 at only 100 lM show significant influences on the viability of the naive spleen cells, while at 10 lM DC838 shows no apparent influence on the cell viability (data not shown). These results thereby imply that the cytotoxicity of DC838 is probably less than that of CsA, and DC838 might be used as a possible lead compound for further immunosuppressive agent discovery.\n\nTo gain further insight into the CypA/DC838 interaction model at the atomic level, the docking simulation on CypA/DC838 binding was carried out using human CypA crystal structure (PDB entry 1NMK) as the model. The binding pocket of CypA was fairly big and shallow, composed of residues Arg55, Phe60, Met61, Gln63, Gly72, Ala101, Asn102, Ala103, Gln111, Phe113, Trp121, Leu122 and His126. The molecular docking results indicate that DC838 binds into the active site groove of CypA similar to CsA. 33 Different from the case of the full occupation by CsA, DC838 took only partly the binding pocket and might swing in the pocket. The DC838 binding model to CypA was shown in Figure 5 . \n\nIn this work, we report one small molecule quinoxaline derivative DC838 as a novel CypA inhibitor. In vivo assays indicated that this compound inhibits mouse spleen cell proliferation induced by concanavalin A. By using SPR and fluorescence titration techniques, kinetic analyses of CypA/DC838 interactions were quantitatively performed. The measured IC 50 value for DC838 is in good agreement with the SPR and fluorescence titration results, which suggests that they are powerful approaches for identifying CypA inhibitor. Molecular docking results elucidated the specific binding of DC838 to CypA at the atomic level. The current work should provide useful information in the discovery of immunosuppressor targeting CypA, and DC838 might be used as a lead compound for further research.\n\nAll the reactions were carried out using oven-dried round-bottomed flasks under an atmosphere of nitrogen unless otherwise noted, and the mixture was stirred magnetically. Dichloromethane was distilled from CaH 2 , and triethylamine was distilled from sodium.\n\nIR spectra in KBr disk were obtained on a NicoletMagna IR750; only peaks with wavenumbers greater than 1200 cm \u00c01 are reported. 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (400 MHz) were recorded in CDCl 3 solution on a Bruker AMX-400 instrument.\n\nThe preparation of DC838 is depicted in Scheme 1. 6-Amino-2,3-di(furan-2-yl)quinoxaline (1) was obtained as described in the literature. 27 Reaction of 6-amino-2,3-di(furan-2-yl)quinoxaline with triphosgene under nitrogen at room temperature in dichloromethane in the present of triethylamine afforded 2,3-di(furan-2-yl)-6-isocyanatoquinoxaline 28 (2) . N,N-Diethylnipecotamide 29 was added into the reaction mixture to afford the target compound (3), which was purified by flash chromatography (silica gel, ethyl acetate). \n\nAll cloning techniques including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction, ligation, Escherichai coli transformation, and plasmid DNA preparation were carried out according to the standard methods. 37 The Histagged CypA protein was expressed and purified from the plasmid pQE30-CypA according to the published procedure. 26 \n\nThe interaction between compound DC838 and CypA were performed using the dual flow cell Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All the experiments were carried out using HBS-EP (10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N 0 -2-ethanesulfonic acid [HEPES], 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA and 0.005% surfactant P20 at pH 7.4) as a running buffer at a constant flow rate of 30 lL/min at 25\u00b0C. The protein was immobilized directly and covalently on the hydrophilic carboxymethylated dextran matrix of the CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore) by using the standard primary amine coupling reaction. The protein to be bound to the sensor chip was diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) to a concentration of 17 lM. The concentrations of the compounds dissolved in the running buffer varied from 1.7 to 10 lM. All the data analyses were carried out using BIAevaluation software, and the sensorgrams were processed by automatic correction for nonspecific bulk refractive index effects. The kinetic analyses of the ligand binding to the protein were performed based on the 1:1 Langmuir binding fit model according to the procedures described in the software manual.\n\nFluorescence measurements were performed on a Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a thermal controller. The change in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence when the compound bound to the protein (CypA) was monitored using a procedure similar to that described in the literature. 3, 31 The experiments were carried out at 25\u00b0C in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl (pH 8.0) with the protein concentration set at 6 lM and the compound concentrations varied from 0 to 90 lM. The compounds were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as a stock solution of 10 mM. The excitation wavelength was set at 278 nm, the emission range was from 300 nm to 400 nm, and the slit was set at 5 nm. Fluorescence readings were taken at the wavelength of maximum emission, generally 336-346 nm. The resulting fluorescence change conversion as a fraction of maximal change, was plotted versus the total concentration of ligands.\n\nCypA PPIase activity was measured at 4\u00b0C by using the standard chymotrypsin-coupled assay. 34 The assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and CypA (500 nM stock solution) were pre-cooled to 4\u00b0C, to which then were added 15 lL of 3 mg/mL chymotrypsin in 1 mM HCl. The reaction was initiated by adding 12 lL of 3.8 mM peptide substrate (Suc-Ala-Ala-cis-Pro-Phe-pNA) in LiCl/THF solution with rapid inversion. After a delay from the onset of mixing (usually 6 s), the absorbance of p-nitroaniline was followed at 390 nM until the reaction was complete (1 min). The final concentration of LiCl in the assay was 9.6 mM; THF was present at a concentration of 2% (v/v). Absorbance readings were collected every 0.1 s by a U-2010 spectrophotometer. The progress curves were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares fit.\n\nThe inhibition assays of compounds were performed in the same manner as mentioned above. A 0.6 lL aliquot of the compounds in DMSO was added to the CypA solution in the assay buffer. After pre-incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, the assay was started by the addition of chymotrypsin and the substrate. To calculate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ), percent of remaining PPIase activity was plotted against the common logarithm of the compound concentration, and the data were fitted using the sigmoidal fitting model by the Origin7.0 software.\n\nFemale ICR strains of mice, 6-8 weeks old and 20 \u00b1 2 g, were purchased from the Experimental Animal House of China Pharmaceutical University (Nanjing, China) and were maintained in plastic cages with free access to pellet food and water (12 h light/dark cycle, 21 \u00b1 2\u00b0C). This study complied with the current ethical regulations on animal research in Nanjing University and the mice used were treated humanely.\n\nThe spleen was aseptically taken from mice, crushed gently and separated into single cells by squeezing in 5 mL D-Hank's solution (GIBCO BRL). The cells obtained were passed through eight-layers of gauze and centrifuged at 1000 rev/min for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Pellets were added into 10 mL of sterile 0.17 M Tris-(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane containing 0.75% NH 4 Cl (pH 7.5) followed by centrifugation to remove erythrocytes. After washing twice with RPMI 1640 containing 100 U/mL of penicillin, 100 U/mL of streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (RPMI 1640 medium), they were re-suspended in the RPMI 1640 medium and used for cell culture.\n\nSpleen cells were cultured in 96-well flat-bottomed microplates (Falcon) at a density of 5 \u00b7 10 5 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium (0.2 mL) and stimulated with 5 lg/mL of ConA for 72 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 -air in the presence or absence (control group) of various concentrations of compounds. Then the cell growth was evaluated with modified MTT assay. 38 Briefly, 20 lL of 5 mg/mL MTT in RPMI 1640 were added for a further 4 h incubation. After removing the supernatant, 200 lL of DMSO were added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The plate was shaken for 10 min, and then read on an ELISA reader (Sunrise Remote/Touch Screen; TECAN, Austria) at 540 nm. All assays were run in triplicate and the effect of compounds on the proliferation of mouse spleen cells induced by Con A was calculated by Eq. 3:\n\nInhibitory rate \u00f0%\u00de \u00bc \u00f0control \u00f0OD 540 \u00de \u00c0 compounds \u00f0OD 540 \u00de\u00de=control \u00f0OD 540 \u00de \u00f03\u00de\n\nData were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD (significance of differences between groups). Statistical analysis was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Student's two-tailed t-test for the evaluation of the difference between two groups and Dunnett's t-test between control group and multiple dose groups. One-way analysis of variance revealed a significant effect at P < 0.05.\n\nThe crystal structure of CypA in complex with sanglifehrin macrolide (SFM) (PDB entry 1NMK) 39 recovered from Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/ pdb) was used as a target for molecular modeling and docking. The three dimensional (3D) structure of the compound DC838 was constructed from scratch by Sybyl 6.8, 40 and optimized to energy convergence with the Tripos force field and MMFF94 charges. In the present study, the DOCK4.0 program 41 was employed for the primary molecular docking. Residues of CypA around SFM at a radius of 6.5 \u00c5 were isolated for constructing the grids of the docking calculation. The resulting substructure included all residues of the binding pocket. During the docking calculation, Kollman-all-atom charges 42 were assigned to the protein, and Gasteiger-Marsili partial charges 43 were assigned to the small molecule. The surface structure of the binding pocket was constructed by using the MOLCAD module of Sybyl 6.8.\n\nThe DOCK suite of programs is designed to find possible orientations of a ligand in a 'receptor' site. 41 The orientation of a ligand is evaluated with a shape-scoring function and/or a function approximating the ligand/ receptor binding energy. The shape-scoring function is an empirical function resembling the van der Waals' attractive energy. The ligand/receptor binding energy is taken to be approximately the sum of the van der Waals' and electrostatic interaction energies. After the initial orientation and scoring evaluation, a grid-based rigid body minimization was carried out for the ligand to locate the nearest local energy minimum within the receptor binding site. The position and conformation of each docked molecule were optimized using the single anchor search and torsion minimization method of DOCK 4.0. Thirty conformations per ligand building a cycle and 50 maximum anchor orientations were used in the anchorfirst docking algorithm. All docked configurations were energy minimized using 100 maximum iterations and one minimization cycle."}
