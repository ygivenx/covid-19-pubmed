{"title": "Analysis of synonymous codon usage in enterovirus 71", "body": "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a member of the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family, which is the major cause of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) in children. EV71 is a small, non-enveloped virus with a positive-stranded RNA genome size of about 7.4 kb. The virus has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA containing a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein that, following viral protease mediated co-and post-translational processing, gives rise to 4 capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) and 7 nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D) [26] . Studies on the phylogenetic relationship of EV71 have divided the viruses into genotypes A, B and C [2] , which has been further divided into subtypes, designated A, B1-5, and C1-4 based on sequencing the region encoding the VP1 major capsid protein [16, 20] . Synonymous codons are not used randomly [14, 15] . Mutational pressure and translational selection were thought to be the main factors that account for codon usage variation among genes in some human RNA virus [12, 13, 29] . Studies the extent and causes of biases in codon usage is essential to the understanding of viral evolution, particularly the interplay between viruses and the immune response [4, 17] . Recently, recombination was found to play a more important role than positive selection in the formation of genetic diversity in EV71 virus. Positive selection was only detected at site 145 of VP1, but most amino acid sites of nonstructural proteins were under negative selection [5] . Previous studies of EV71 have mainly been limited to phylogenic analysis, and few synonymous codon usage analyses have been applied. In order to better understand the characteristics of the EV71 genome and to reveal more information about the viral genome, we have analyzed the codon usage and dinucleotide composition. In this report, we sought to address the issues concerning codon usage in EV71 virus.\n\nA total of 42 publicly available complete human EV71 RNAs isolated from China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Viet Nam, America and Norway were download from GeneBank and sequence Spearman's rank correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis were performed to determine the role of different factors in shaping the codon usage biases in the various EV71 viruses. All statistical analyses, as well as cluster analysis, were carried out using the statistical analysis software SPSS Version 15.0. To investigate synonymous codon usage variation among EV71 viruses, COA was implemented for all 42 EV71 ORFs selected for this study. Figure 1 depicts the position of each ORF on the plane defined by the first, second and third principal axes generated by COA on RSCU values of ORFs. The first principal axis accounts for 26.98 % of the total variation. The next three axes account for 21.57, 13.02, and 8.05 % of the variation, respectively. This observation indicates that although the first major axis explains a substantial amount of variation in trends in codon usage, the second major axis also has an appreciable impact on total variation in synonymous codon usage. If not specifically mentioned, the values of the first two axes of this COA were used for correlation and regression analysis hereafter.\n\nMutational pressure and translational selection were thought to be the main factors that account for codon usage variation among genes in some human RNA virus [12, 13, 29] . Therefore, we compared the G?C content at the first and second codon positions (GC12s) with that at the synonymous third position (GC3s) to investigate which factor in EV71 can explain their codon usage. It was found that GC12s and GC3s are significantly correlated (r = 0.393, P \\ 0.01). This suggests that they are most likely the result of mutational pressure, as natural selection would be expected to act differently on different codon positions. The plot of ENC and GC3S is another effective way to explore codon usage variation among genes [23] . In order to further find whether codon usage variation among EV71 virus is determined by mutational bias, ENC values of each virus gene were plotted against its corresponding GC3s. Genes, whose codon choice is constrained only by a G?C mutational bias, will lie on or just below the curve of the predicted values. All of the spots lie below the expected curve as shown in Fig. 2 . In addition, a significantly positive correlation between GC3s and ENC (r = -0.048, P \\ 0.001) values was observed. The results indicated that the codon usage bias in these 42 EV71 genomes is greatly influenced by the G?C mutation bias.\n\nMultivariate statistical analysis can be used to explore the relationships between variables and samples. The major trend in codon usage variation among ORFs can be investigated using correspondence analysis (COA). In order to minimize the effects of amino acid composition on codon usage, each ORF is represented as a 59-dimensional vector; each dimension corresponds to the RSCU value of one sense codon (excluding AUG, UGG, and stop codons). Major trends within this dataset can be determined using measures of relative inertia and genes ordered according to their positions along the axis of major inertia. We analyzed the correlation between the first or second axis values in COA and GC12s or GC3s values of each strain. The first axis value in COA of each selected genome, which contains most of the variation in synonymous codon usage bias between these genomes, is closely correlated with the GC composition at the first, second, and third codon position ( Table 3 ). The second axis in the COA of each gene is also closely correlated with the GC12s. This analysis indicated that most of the codon usage bias among different ORFs is directly related to the nucleotide composition. Therefore, the compositional constraint is the main determinant of the variation in synonymous codon usage among different EV71 ORFs. These results were similar with previously study described by Liu et al. that the interaction between mutation pressure from virus and natural selection from host exists in the processes of evolution of EV71 [13] . However, other factors, such as hydrophobicity and aromaticity, whether influence the codon usage variation among the genomes of EV71 need to be elucidated. The GC index was used to calculate the overall GC content in the ORF, while the index GC3s was used to calculate the fraction of GC nucleotides at the synonymous third codon position (excluding Met, Trp, and the termination codons). At the amino acid level, the general average hydrophobicity score (GRAVY) and the frequency of aromatic amino acids (Aromaticity) in the putative gene product were also analyzed. All the indices mentioned were calculated using the analysis program CodonW, version 1.4 [9] . As showed in Fig. 2 , the majority of the actual ENC values are slightly lower than the expected ones, which indicated that other factors may also influence the codon usage in EV71 viruses. To test whether selection pressure contributes to the codon usage variation among EV71 viruses, we performed a correlation analysis to evaluate whether GRAVY and Aromaticity values were related to first two axes of COA and ENC values (Table 3 ). Our results showed that GRAVY was correlated with both axis 1 and axis 2, while Aromaticity was correlated with ENC and axis 2, indicating that the degree of hydrophobicity and the frequency of aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp) were also associated with the codon usage variation.\n\nIn our study, the synonymous codon usage biases in 42 EV71 genomes were analyzed. We found that both EV71 genes had low codon usage bias, and mutational pressure rather selection pressure is the main factor determining the codon usage biases. Moreover, aromaticity and hydrophobicity could be partially accounting for the codon usage variation."}
