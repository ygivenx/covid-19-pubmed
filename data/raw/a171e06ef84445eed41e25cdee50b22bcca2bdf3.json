{"title": "Scrutinizing the SARS-CoV-2 protein information for the designing an effective vaccine encompassing both the T-cell and B-cell epitopes", "body": "should robustly activate both the humoral and the cell-mediated immunity to establish strong protection against the pathogen [10] . The antibody generation by B-cell activation as well as acute viral clearance by T-cells along with virus-specific memory generation by CD8+ Tcells are equally important to develop immunity against the coronavirus [11] . In case of respiratory virus like coronaviruses, the mucosal immunity plays an essential role and therefore route of administration of the vaccine is also important in the context of vaccine development. Vaccines designed against previously reported SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV majorly focuses on the Spike protein of virus which consists of S1 and S2 subunits bearing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus and cell fusion machinery respectively.\n\nMutations in the spike protein have also been reported to be responsible for the change in host cell tropism [12] . The S protein is considered most antigenic and thereby can evoke immune responses and generate neutralizing antibodies that can block the virus attachment to the host cells [13] . Other viral proteins which were explored for vaccine development include N protein, E protein and the NSP16 proteins [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Almost all the platforms for vaccine development for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been investigated including the lifeattenuated ones, recombinant viruses, sub-unit protein vaccines, DNA vaccines, Viral vectorbased vaccines, nanoparticle-based vaccines, etc. which may form the base for the vaccine designing against the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 [10, 19] . Here we have designed a multiepitope-based vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 using next generation vaccinology approach where the recently available genome and proteome of the SARS-CoV-2 were maneuvered and a potential vaccine candidate was conceived. Similar strategy was employed previously for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] as well as certain findings are reported for the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 [26] [27] [28] . While immunoinformatics techniques was utilized by groups to predict the B-cell and cytotoxic T-cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein, N protein [27] [28] [29] , others have utilized the information to design epitope-based vaccine based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein [26] . Along with the structural proteins, utilizing the non-structural and accessory proteins for the vaccine development can aid in better development of an efficacious vaccine for long term by neutralizing the mutation rate of this RNA virus. In this study, we explored the whole proteome of SARS-CoV-2 to scrutinize the highly conserved antigenic epitopes for the construction of a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can effectively elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19. The constructed vaccine product has high population coverage and along with adaptive immunity, can as well lead to initiation of innate immune response further enhancing the generation of memory immunity.\n\nWith the continuous transmission of the virus across borders and increasing health burden on the global scale, SARS-CoV-2 demands an urgent immunization therapy. As depicted by Shan Lu, the Community Acquired Coronavirus Infection (CACI) caused by this virus can shatter the socio-economic condition worldwide and the development of vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 should be encouraged to manage the present situation as well as it can serve as a prototype for other coronaviruses [30, 31] . Thereby, our analysis provides a platform for the development of a protective vaccine candidate that can be tested in-vitro and in-vivo and may lead to faster development of an efficient vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nThe complete proteome of latest reported novel Wuhan strain of SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was downloaded from the Nucleotide database available at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The database was also thoroughly searched for the genomes of other available human infecting strains of Coronavirus till date and was downloaded for further analysis.\n\nFor the antigenic analysis of the proteome of the COVID-19 strain, VaxiJen v2.0 server available at http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html [32] .\n\nFor antigenicity prediction of the Proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with higher accuracy, Virus model available at the VaxiJen server with a threshold of 0.4 was utilized.\n\nProteins with a VaxiJen score \u2265 0.4 were taken for epitope prediction analysis.\n\nMHC class I and II alleles were selected on the basis of their occurrence worldwide.\n\nWe focused specially on the countries which are severely affected by the deadly DRB1_1101, DRB1_1201, DRB1_1302, DRB1_1501, HLA-DPA10103-DPB10101,   HLA-DPA10201-DPB10201,  HLA-DPA10301-DPB10301,  HLA-DQA10101-DQB10201, HLA-DQA10301-DQB10301, HLA-DQA10401-DQB10401, HLA-DQA10501-DQB10501,  HLA-DQA10102-DQB10202,  HLA-DQA10402-DQB10402 covering 99.71 % world population were used for the epitope screening.\n\nVarious online servers were explored for the accurate prediction of Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes. Firstly, the antigenic proteins were analyzed by using [37] . Only the epitopes with VaxiJen score \u2265 0.4 and predicted to be non-toxic and non-allergens, were taken for further screening. The best HLA-non-allergenic epitope pair with the highest VaxiJen score was taken for constructing the multi-epitope vaccine. [39] and for the allergenicity, the AllerTop v.\n\n2.0 was used (https://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/method.html) [40] .\n\nThereafter, the non-allergenic strong binders with a positive immunogenicity score were checked for their toxic nature by utilizing the ToxinPred server (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/toxinpred/motif_scan.php).\n\nThe presence of selected best epitopes in all the reported human infecting SARScoronavirus strain were checked by using Epitope Conservancy Analysis tool of IEDB (http://tools.iedb.org/conservancy/) [41] . Only the epitopes having 100% conservation were used for multi-epitope vaccine construction.\n\nThe MHC class I ad class II molecules were downloaded from RCSB PDB database (https://www.rcsb.org/). Those that were not available were in PDB database were retrieved from pHLA database (https://www.phla3d.com.br/) [42] . The structures of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins were constructed using I-TASSER (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) [43] and HTL and CTL epitopes were mapped and their structures were retrieved using PyMol tool. For the molecular interaction analysis of the predicted best HLA-epitope pairs for both MHC class I and class II alleles, ClusPro protein-protein docking tool (https://cluspro.org/login.php) [44] was utilized.\n\nABCpred tool based on artificial neural network was explored for B-cell epitope prediction (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/abcpred/index.html) [45] . For higher accuracy, the threshold for the prediction was kept 0.90. The predicted epitopes were checked for their antigenicity using VaxiJen server, allergenicity by using AlgPred and toxicity by ToxinPred server.\n\nFor constructing a multi-epitope vaccine construct, the selected best HTL, CTL and B-cell epitopes were joined by using GPGPG, AAG and KK linkers respectively. For the better immunogenic response, four adjuvants namely, \u03b2-defensin, universal memory T cell helper peptide (TpD), PADRE sequence and a M cell ligand were added by using EAAAK linker into the vaccine construct.\n\nThe antigenicity of the vaccine construct, VaxiJen server was exploited. For the allergenicity analysis of the vaccine construct, three different tools namely AlgPred, AllerTop and AllergenFP v.1.0 (http://ddg-pharmfac.net/AllergenFP/index.html) [46] were utilized.\n\nTo check the population coverage of the vaccine construct, Population coverage tool available at IEDB (http://tools.iedb.org/population/) [47] server was utilized. The HLA class I and class II alleles in the final construct were entered in the tool and the population coverage of the alleles were calculated for the top 26 countries that are severely affected by the SARS-COV-2 virus. The analysis was performed for HLA I and HLA II separately as well as in combination.\n\nExpasy's ProtParam (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) [48] was explored for the physiochemical properties evaluation of the vaccine construct. ProtParam evaluates the peptide sequence and provides the molecular weight, theoretical pI, extinction coefficient, estimated half-life, instability index, and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY). Solubility of the construct was calculated using SolPro tool available at SCRATCH protein predictor server (http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/) [49] .\n\nSecondary structure of the multi-epitope vaccine construct was predicted using SOPMA(https://npsaprabi.ibcp.fr/cgibin/npsa_automat.pl?page=/NPSA/npsa_sopma.html) [50] and PSI-PRED (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/) server [51] . For the tertiary structure prediction of the vaccine construct Robetta server (http://robetta.bakerlab.org/) based on ab initio and homology modelling was utilized [52] . The predicted structure was refined by using 3D Refine (http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/3Drefine/) [53] and further . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The required structure files (.psf) were generated by psfgen using Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) tool v.1.9.3 by utlizing CHARMM force fields for proteins. Initially, a 10,000 steps energy minimization was performed followed by subsequent heating the system from 0 K to 310 K. Thereafter, a 20 ns standard molecular dynamics was performed and trajectory DCD file generated was used to evaluate RMSD. The change in kinetic, potential and total energy was evaluated for these 20 ns simulation using VMD.\n\nTo check the interaction of the multi-epitope vaccine construct with two immunoreceptors, TLR-3 and TLR-8, ClusPro docking server was used and the resultant best complexes were then simulated for 20 ns in a water sphere using NAMD.\n\nEscherichia coli K12 satrain, the construct was first converted to cDNA using Reverse translate tool available at Expasy server. The resultant DNA was further optimized for enhanced protein expression by using JCAT server [55] . Finally, the cDNA construct was inserted into the pET28a (+) vector using HindIII and BamHI restriction sites.\n\n. CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Structural proteins include Spike glycoprotein, Envelope protein, membrane protein and nucleocapsid protein.\n\nThe Fasta sequences of all these proteins were retrieved from NCBI and used for epitope screening ( Table 1 ). All the sequences were analyzed for their antigenic nature by using VaxiJen server which is based upon auto cross covariance (ACC) transformation. VaxiJen classifies the proteins into antigens and non-antigens solely based on the physiochemical properties and is sequence alignment independent. The ACC score threshold for the virus model is kept 0.4 that increases the prediction accuracy. All the SARS-CoV-2 proteins except NSP16 (2'-O-ribose methyltransferase) resulted in the ACC score higher than 0.4 depicting the antigenic nature of the viral proteome (Table 1 ). All the antigenic proteins were further screened for the presence of HTL, CTL and B-cell epitopes by using various tools and databases ( Figure 1 ). HTLs act as the central mediators of immune response and coordinates with B lymphocytes, T C cells and macrophages via signaling through interleukins and cytokines synthesis. HTLs recognize the epitopes presented on MHCII biding cleft. Herein, NetMHCPanII server was utilized for predicting 15 mer HTL epitopes having high binding affinity to the selected 20 MHC II alleles. Only the strong binders for the respective HLA alleles were selected with a percentile rank of \u22641. The selected epitopes were further analyzed using another MHC II prediction tool available at IEDB server and filtered on the basis of percentile rank. The resultant epitopes were checked for their antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity. Finally, the best HLA-epitope pairs with the highest antigenicity and were non-allergen and non-toxic were used for multi-epitope vaccine construct. On analysis, we received, 2 best HLA-epitope pairs each for Helicase and RdRp. Three best HLA-epitope pairs were obtained for non-structural protein 2 (NSP2) and Spike glycoprotein (S) and one pair each for membrane glycoprotein (M), ORF3a and ORF8 proteins. In summary, non-toxic, non-allergenic epitopes with high binding affinity and antigenicity were obtained for 15 MHC class II alleles and their respective epitopes were used for multi-epitope vaccine construct. Best binding epitopes for the remaining 5 MHC II alleles were either nonantigenic, or were allergens and thus were excluded (Supplementary Table S1 ).\n\nCTLs eliminate foreign particles thereby helping in pathogen clearance and are required for maintaining the cellular integrity. MHC class I molecules represent the epitopes to the CTLs which after activation perform cytotoxic activities. Here, we used NetMHCpan v.4 for the mining of CTL epitopes that have high binding affinity with the 14 class I molecules. The strong binders obtained from NetMHCpan server were then analyzed for their immunogenicity by using class I Immunogenicity tool. Depending upon the amino acid composition, properties and their position in the epitope, class I immunogenicity tool predicts the immunogenicity of a MHC class Iepitope complex. Higher the score depicts higher immunogenicity and vice-versa. Here, all the epitopes with positive score were taken and analyzed for antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity. Finally, the epitopes with highest antigenicity, non-allergen and non-toxic were selected for the vaccine construction. Upon The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009209 doi: bioRxiv preprint analysis, 3 HLA-epitope pairs were obtained for ORF3a protein, 2 pairs for membrane protein, nucleo-capsid protein, and spike glycoprotein each while one HLA-epitope pair each for NSP2, NSP4, Envelope protein, and ORF8 (Supplementary Table S2 ). Overlapping sequences were merged into one or both MHC class I and class II binding epitopes Apart from cellular mediated immunity, the humoral immune response mediates pathogen clearance in the antibody dependent manner. Hence the proteome of SARC-CoV-2 was further scanned for linear B-cell epitopes by using ABCPred server. For higher selectivity and sensitivity, the threshold of ABCPred was kept 0.9. The predicted epitopes were checked for their antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity and the best epitopes were taken for further consideration. On the basis of above criteria, we received one B-cell epitope each for Nucleocapsid, Guanine-N7 methyltransferase (ExoN), ORF3a, ORF7a, and Surface glycoprotein (Supplementary Table S3 ). The locations of the selected epitopes in the respective protein structures are represented by Figure 2 . Overall, the antigenic 13 HTL and 12 CTL epitopes having highest affinity for the respective HLA alleles and 5 B-cell epitopes that are non-allergenic, non-toxic and can generate a potential immune response were selected for incorporation into the multi-epitope vaccine construct.\n\nThe presence of conserved epitopes in a vaccine can lead to an effective immunization against all the strains of the pathogen. Thus, the selected HTL, CTL and BCL epitopes were analyzed for their conservancy among the various human infecting strains of coronavirus.\n\nInterestingly, all the selected epitopes were 100 % conserved throughout the coronavirus family and this can lead to a robust vaccine development.\n\nMHC class I and class II alleles have a specific binding groove where the peptide binds and are presented on the cell surface for immune system activation. The protein structures of SAR-CoV-2 were modelled using I-Tasser (Supplementary Figure S1) . To check the molecular interaction of our selected CTL and HTL epitopes with their respective HLA alleles, we performed protein-protein docking using ClusPro. HLA alleles were taken as receptors and epitopes as ligands. ClusPro performs the interaction analysis by first generating billions of conformers eventually leading to rigid target based molecular docking.\n\nThe resultant docked complexes are then clustered based on RMSD and lowest energy finally Figure 3C ).\n\nAn ideal vaccine should harbor conserved epitopes, have multi-valency and can elicit both cellular and humoral mediated immune response in the host. A subunit vaccine contains minimal elements that are antigenic and required for the stimulation of prolonged protective or therapeutic immune response. In the recent times, various reports have shown the construction of multi subunit vaccine by utilizing highly antigenic HTL, CTL and BCL epitopes. Herein, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate by combining 13 HTL, 12 CTL and 4 BCL epitopes that were highly conserved, antigenic, non-toxic and non-allergens ( Figure 4 ).\n\nIn the recent times, various small peptides are been explored that acts as an adjuvant and can potentiate the multi-epitope vaccine mediated immune response by activating humoral immunity. Taking this into consideration, apart from the conserved epitopes, four adjuvants were also added so as to boost the protective immune response against SARS-CoV- \n\nAnalysis of the physiochemical properties of a multi-subunit vaccine helps in analyzing the optimal immune response of the vaccine and its stability inside the host. ProtParam was utilized for accessing the molecular weight, pI, stability and grand average of hydropathy (GRAVY) constant of the SARS-CoV-2 multi-epitope vaccine construct. Molecular weight .

Instability index of 31.93 (<40) depicted the stable nature of the vaccine construct while the estimated half-life in mammalian reticulocytes was observed to be >30 hours. GRAVY constant of 0.213 depicted the hydrophilicity of the vaccine construct and was predicted to be soluble with a probability of `70 % as predicted by SolPro (Table 2) . Antigenicity is a preliminary requisite of a successful vaccine candidate. A vaccine construct must possess both immunogenicity and antigenicity to elicit the humoral and cell-mediated immune response.\n\nUpon analyzing the vaccine construct sequence in VaxiJen server, the constructed vaccine was found to be antigenic in nature with an overall prediction score of 0.6199. The score signifies the antigenic potential of the vaccine construct that may have the potential to evoke the immune response inside the host. On allergenicity analysis, all the three tools AlgPred, AllergenFP and AllerTop supported the non-allergenic nature of the vaccine construct while toxicity analysis revealed the non-toxic behavior of the construct ( Table 2 ). In summary, the constructed epitope was observed to be stable, soluble, antigenic, non-allergenic and nontoxic.\n\nSecondary and tertiary structure helps in the functional annotation of the multi-epitope vaccines. It also helps in analyzing the interaction of this vaccine construct with the immunological receptors like TLRs. Secondary structure of the protein was analyzed by using SOPMA and PSIPRED server that revealed the presence of ~40 % alpha helix, ~20 % \u03b2-sheet, ~30 % coils and ~6 % \u03b2 turns in the vaccine construct ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S3 ). Tertiary structure of the vaccine was predicted by threading based homology modelling using Robetta server ( Figure 6A ). Ramachandran plot analysis of the modelled structure revealed the presence of 95.5 % residues in the most favoured regions and 4.5 % in the additionally allowed regions ( Figure 6B ). Quality factor was analyzed by using ERRAT2 server and was obtained to be 90.47 depicting a good modelled structure ( Figure 6C ). To further refine the modelled structure, 3D refine and GalaxyRefine were utilized that leads to 97.4 % residues in the most favoured region and 2.6 % residues in the additionally allowed region. The quality factor of the refined structure was observed to be 94.29% depicting the improvement of the modelled structure ( Figure 6D-F) .

Unnecessary or false geometry of the protein structures are repaid by performing energy minimization resulting in a more stable stoichiometry. Before energy minimization, the potential energy was observed to be -447451.2005 Kcal/mol. After 10,000 steps the protein was minimized with a potential energy of -676040.4692 kcal/mol ( Figure 7A) . The system was subsequently heated from 0 K to 310 K and then 10 ns molecular dynamic simulation was performed. The temperature remained constant throughout the simulation process ( Figure 7B ). The DCD trajectory file was analysed for analysing the movement of the atoms during the simulation course and RMSD was calculated. Upon analysing the RMSD of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine construct, it was observed that, the system gained equilibrium at ~4 ns and then remained constant till 10 ns depicting the stability of the vaccine construct ( Figure 7C ). Furthermore, upon analysing the change in kinetic, potential and total energy of the system, it was observed that after a quick initial change in all the three, they remained constant throughout the simulation further strengthening the stability of the vaccine construct ( Figure 7D-F) . Furthermore, the bond energy, VdW energy, dihedral and improper dihedral energy analysis revealed no change throughout the 10 ns dynamics simulation. Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) analysis revealed the rigidness of the atoms in vaccine construct with a slight mobility observed at ~ 120 and 501 residues (Supplementary Figure S4) . Thus, simulation analysis revealed the stability of the vaccine construct in the real environment. The refined vaccine construct structure was therefore used for interaction analysis with immunological receptor TLR3.\n\nProteinprotein docking of immune receptor TLR3 and the constructed vaccine was carried out using ClusPro server. In total 30 TLR3-vaccine construct complexes were generated. The The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009209 doi: bioRxiv preprint standard molecular dynamics simulation studies using NAMD suite. The 10,000 steps energy minimization of the complex lead to the generation of a minimized energy complex with energy of -756791.5601 Kcal/mol ( Figure 8C ). After subsequent heating the system from 0 K to 310 K, the temperature was kept constant throughout ( Figure 8D) . Energy plots depicted no major changes throughout the simulation ( Figure 8E -G and Supplementary Figure S5 ). RMSF analysis of the complex showed a mobility region at ~740 th residue and ~1100 residue of the TLR3-vaccine complex ( Figure 8H ). On trajectory analysis, the RMSD plot was constructed that revealed the major deviations during the initial 1.5 ns, thereafter the system remained constant till 10 ns.\n\nFor the insertion of the vaccine construct into a plasmid vector, the 602 amino acid long protein sequence was reverse translated to cDNA of 1806 nucleotide length. The expression system of the expression host varies with each other and the cDNA needs to be adapted as per the host codon usage. For the optimal expression of the vaccine product in Escherichia coli K12 host, the resultant cDNA was codon optimized according using JCAT server. Also, during optimization, rho-independent transcription terminator and prokaryotic ribosomal binding sites were avoided in middle of the cDNA sequence so as to generate an optimal and complete protein expression. Further, for inserting the construct in the cloning vector, the cleavage sites of BamHI and HindIII were also avoided. The CAI value (codon adaptation index) of the cDNA before adaptation was observed to be 0.5379 and a GC content of 59.52 % ( Figure 9A ). After adaptation, the CAI score of the improved sequence was increased to 0.946 with 52.54 % GC content ( Figure 9B and Supplementary data S1). The enhanced CAI score depicts the presence of most abundant codons in Escherichia coli K12. The adapted cDNA sequence was used for In silico cloning purpose.\n\nEscherichia coli K12 strain was selected as a host for cloning purpose as the expression and purification of multi-epitope vaccines are easier in this bacterium. pET28a(+) expression vector was cleaved using BamHI and HindIII restriction enzyme and the cDNA was inserted near the ribosome binding site using Snapgene. 6X histidine tag was added at the 3' end for the isolation and purification of the vaccine construct ( Figure 9C ).\n\n.

The SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious virus with a high mortality rate especially in immunocompromised and elderly persons. Vaccines are the utmost need of the time to succumb the rising infections due to COVID-19 and represent the best way to combat infectious diseases in the community. Conventional vaccine development methods are time-consuming, laborious and expensive and in this regard, the in-silico immuno-informatics approach have proved to a boon [59] . Moreover, the availability of large number of efficient tools to predict the immuno-determinants, and large database of information facilitate and accelerate this whole process of vaccine designing [60] . Multiepitope vaccines are designed by using the most antigenic conserved part of the pathogen's proteins that makes them more effective and can help in combating the high mutation rate in RNA viruses. These epitope-based vaccines have added advantages of being safe, stable, highly specific, cost-curtailing, easy to produce in bulk, and provides option to manipulate the epitopes for designing of a better vaccine candidate [61] . This method of vaccine development has proved to be promising enough for different microbial diseases including both bacterial and viral [25, [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] .\n\nHerein, we applied reverse vaccinology approach for designing of a multi-epitope Secondary structure prediction revealed the predominance of alpha helix while the tertiary structure obtained from threading provides the spatial arrangement of amino-acid in space. The obtained modelled structure was further refined that increased its overall quality.\n\nTo check the interaction of the vaccine construct with the immune receptors, protein-protein docking was performed. Various immune receptors like Toll-like receptors (TLRs) act as sensor proteins that help in recognizing and differentiating self and non-self molecules and cells. They help in recognizing molecular patterns on the surface of foreign particles like viruses, bacteria and fungi and elicit immune response against these infectious agents. TLR3 acts as a nucleic acid sensor and helps in recognizing RNA and DNA viruses inside the human body and establishes a protective role against this infectious agents [68] . In SARS-CoV infection, TLR3 signaling contributes to the innate immune response against the viral infection [69] . Thus agonist of TLR3, \u03b2-defensin that also acts as an adjuvant was added to the vaccine construct. Also, the molecular interaction analysis of the vaccine construct with the TLR3 resulted into a stable complex formation that was energetically favorable. RSMD analysis of the vaccine construct and the vaccine construct-TLR3 complex depicted the stable nature of both the systems in the real environment.\n\nFinally, codon optimization was performed for the maximal expression of multiepitope vaccine product in Escherichia coli K12. Overall, herein, an integrated next generation vaccinology approach was used to design a potential antigenic multi-epitope subunit vaccine which may combat the COVID-19 with high specificity and efficacy.
