There is much enthusiasm about its potential to be a new, powerful therapeutic Despite intensive studies, mechanisms of ASO action on tool to specifically inhibit gene expression. [14] RNAi is a part of the mRNA are still incompletely understood. Current concepts suginnate antiviral defense in lower eukaryotes. It is induced by gest that the major mechanism of action of phosphorothioate ASO double-stranded (ds)RNA that is processed to 21-23 nucleotide is activation of endonuclease RNAse H when ASO binds to siRNA (figure 3).

ASO binding to mRNA can also prevent siRNA.

The targeted molecule must be important in disease pathogenesis and, as ASO can be extremely potent, it is essential to ensure both lung and disease specificity/ selectivity of the target to avoid potential adverse effects.\n\nOnce a clinically relevant target protein has been selected, specificity of the ASO is a critical issue; it must inhibit expression of the target gene, but not other genes with similar sequences, i.e. the targeted mRNA sequence should not have homology to other genes. In design of ASO, the genome should be carefully checked properties of DNA. [29, 30] These properties can provide an additionfor possible hybridization of the ASO to sequences in non-targeted al therapeutic effect, for example, in cancer. However, systemic genes.

This exposure suppressed antigen-induced airway inflammation during the following 48 hours. [47] These examples demonstrate that the effective ASO dose and duration of its effect depend on the target characteristics, in addition to the importance of an efficient delivery system. Quantity and half-life of both target mRNA and encoded protein are critical determinants of ASO pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in in vivo applications.\n\nAdverse effects of ASO therapy (table I) can result from hybridization of ASO to nonspecific sequences in mRNA, rather than the targeted sequence. Assessing expression of the targeted gene at both mRNA and protein levels following ASO treatment is important to confirm the specificity of the ASO effect.\n\nUpon DNA-RNA duplex formation, the endonuclease RNAse H is recruited to degrade the RNA in the duplex.
