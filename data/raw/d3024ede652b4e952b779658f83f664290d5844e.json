{"title": "Disease burden of the most commonly detected respiratory viruses in hospitalized patients calculated using the disability adjusted life year (DALY) model", "body": "Infection of the respiratory tract is the most common type of acute infection globally in both adults and children. In Europe, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the eighth leading cause of disease. 1 In recent years, discovery of several novel viruses associated with high morbidity respiratory outcomes (including human metapneumovirus (HMPV), 2 human coronaviruses (HCoVs) NL63 3 and HKU1 4 and human rhinovirus species C (HRV-C) 5 ) has markedly increased the repertoire of agents associated with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI). This presents significant challenges for microbiology diagnostics.\n\nAttempts to prevent respiratory virus infections are usually limited to vulnerable high risk groups such as the immunocompromised or the elderly, and include measures such as vaccination, cohorting to reduce exposure risk and prophylaxis. Vaccination to protect from infection with these principal agents of respiratory disease is only widely available for influenzas A and B. In respiratory seasons where HRSV is severely epidemic, HRSV positive patients may be cohorted in attempt to reduce transmission of the virus to other patients. Near patient testing (NPT) for HRSV infection is recommended for infants requiring hospital admission with acute bronchiolitis to facilitate timely cohorting. 6 Only one study has previously attempted to quantify disease burden attributable to respiratory viruses. 7 Respiratory tract infections in community based adults over the age of 60 were prospectively diagnosed, and disease burden associated with a panel of respiratory viruses was quantified using the method of the US Institute of Medicine to prioritise new vaccine development strategies for diseases of importance in the United States.\n\nThe importance of clinical outcomes of infections with recently discovered and lower prevalence viruses have not been systematically quantified. The Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) model was endorsed by the World Health Organization in 1996 as a methodology for prioritizing interventions in the health sector based on their potential to reduce burden of disease. DALYs combine time lost due to morbidity and mortality to attribute a single numerical value as a measure of the associated burden caused by a disease outcome. This model has been employed to quantify the disease burden of the most commonly detected patients in an age stratified hospitalized patient cohort to provide an indication of where resources might be most effectively used for diagnostics, patient management and treatment.\n\nSamples. Between 1 July 2006 and 30 June 2009, results of routine diagnostic screen tests of samples collected from hospitalized patients were available for adenovirus (AdV), influenza A (seasonal) influenza B, parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (PIV-1 to -3) and HRSV. Additionally, virus testing results were available for a subset of samples for HMPV, 8 human rhinoviruses species A, B and C together (456 samples) 9 and coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 10 from previous studies. For the purpose of this study, additional screening for rhinoviruses was undertaken on 579 samples collected between September 2008 and February 2009 using the previously described PCR protocol 9 for pan-rhinovirus detection. Ethical approval for this work was granted by the Lothian Regional Ethics Committee (08/S11/02/2). All samples in the respiratory archive were subject to anonymisation and so the institutional review board specifically waived the need for patient consent. Retained patient information included age, sex, place of sample collection (e.g., accident and emergency, specified hospital ward) and clinical information recorded on referral forms.\n\nSamples testing positive for more than one of the viruses included in the study were considered separately as mixed infections and excluded from subsequent analyses. Due to the differences in sampling strategy from different patient populations, it was appropriate to undertake analyses in an age-stratified way and to consider immunocompromised patients separately.\n\nClinical data. The DALY model quantifies morbidity associated with different clinical outcomes by assigning disability weights on a scale between 0 and 1, whereby 0 is no morbidity and 1 is death. Clinical data relating to some samples could be assigned to more than one category, and so categories were treated in a hierarchical fashion with precedent given in the order: URTI and LRTI only were identified as the only outcomes for which a causal association between infection and presentation could be assumed and so only these categories were analysed using the DALY model. Where clinical data indicated no LRTI/URTI, associated samples were excluded from disease burden calculations (including samples for which no clinical data was available). Samples collected from 'chronic' patients were excluded. These included a very small proportion of all samples and current understanding of disease exacerbation precludes estimations of the proportion of these patients who would have respiratory presentations, how severe these would be and how significantly an infecting virus might contribute to these.\n\nLiterature review identified death and infection as a cause of asthma as significant outcomes of respiratory virus infection (refer to S3; supplementary material). The rates of these outcomes due to infection with each respiratory virus were estimated from the literature (Tables S1-S3; supplementary material) and incorporated into the model.\n\nA consequence of the hierarchical categorization of clinical data was that for immunocompromised patients no information about respiratory presentations was available. There are two approaches to estimating the rate of URTI and LRTI in immunocompromised patients. The first is from the literature. The second is using the rates observed in otherwise healthy hospitalized individuals in Edinburgh. The latter approach has been chosen: the Edinburgh archive may not reflect other sampled populations in terms of the criteria for sample testing, the viruses present and clinical definitions.\n\nThe rates of death, LRTI and URTI due to respiratory virus infection were not estimated in immunocompromised patients in whom a respiratory virus infection was not identified due to the paucity of published studies of this patient group.\n\nDisability weighting. The Global Burden of Disease study 12-14 (the 'gold standard' of studies quantifying disease burden using DALYs) weight assigned to LRTI is 0.279. In the study population, LRTI was assumed to be the cause of hospitalization, and so a higher disability weight was deemed appropriate. The range in disability weights considered to reflect the possible implications of hospitalization due to LRTI fell between 0.279 and 0.4. A weight of 0.4 was considered appropriate for an individual admitted to an intensive therapy unit (ITU). The disability weight attributed to LRTI was assigned on a virus-dependent basis in the range of 0.279-0.4 proportional to the rate of ITU admission on diagnosis of LRTI. For example, 29.4% of patients with LRTI testing singly positive for AdV were admitted to ITU, and so a disability weight of ((0.294 \u00d7 (0.4 \u2212 0.279)) + 0.279=) 0.315 (3 s.f.) was assigned.\n\nURTI was not assumed to be the cause of hospitalization, but was assumed to be caused by the infecting respiratory virus. The Global Burden of Disease study disability weight of 0 was deemed inappropriate as a clinician had felt the presentations warranted documentation and so the value for pharyngitis of 0.07 was applied. 14 Disability weights for LRTI calculated in otherwise healthy patients were applied to the immunocompromised population.\n\nITU admission of an immunocompromised patient could not be assumed to be due to respiratory infection and so this method was preferred to a distinct disability weight calculation in this group.\n\nFor infection as a cause of asthma, the Global Burden of Disease study disability weight of 0.043 was applied.\n\nOther model parameters. The duration of disability associated with URTI and LRTI was estimated from the literature on a virus specific basis (Tables S1-S3; supplementary material).\n\nUsing the assumptions described by Murray, 14 application of the same social and life expectancy parameters to immunocompromised individuals as otherwise healthy individuals was considered the most ethically viable approach for the purpose of this study (Dr. Claudia Stein, pers. Comm.).\n\nThe DALY model regards life expectancy as the maximum achievable length of life. Sex specific mean life expectancies in Scotland between 2006 and 2009 as described by the Office for National Statistics were used. DALYs were calculated in an age stratified manner with immunocompromised patients considered separately.\n\nCalculation of disease burden. Estimates of the burden of disease associated with each respiratory virus were calculated using the DALY formula 15 :\n\nwhere D is the disability weight; C and \u2424 are parameters of the age weighting function (parameters of age weighting function used were as for the World Bank study 12, 14 ) ; a is the age at disease onset (mid-range values for each age band were applied); L is the duration of disability, which in case fatalities is the time between age of onset and life expectancy; and r is the social discount rate. The social discount rate using in the Global Burden of Disease study of 0.03 was applied. 12, 14 Absolute DALY measures were standardized to a common metric (DALYs per 1000 population) by dividing the total number of DALYs calculated by the proportion of samples with clinical data available for each virus in the study. This procedure enabled a fair comparison between viruses where the number of samples taken and the number of samples with clinical data available varied. The study population of hospitalized individuals does not reflect the population of Scotland, and quantification of community based disease burden associated with respiratory viruses was outside the scope of this study.\n\nQuantification of the disease burden associated with each respiratory virus required calculations of sampling frequencies, breakdown of clinical data, and determination of ITU admission rates. The number of samples tested and the frequency of samples testing singly positive for each virus are summarized (Table 1) . Between 1035 (rhinoviruses) and 12,883 (HRSV and influenza A) samples were tested for each virus. Detection frequencies ranged between 0.33% (PIV-2) and 18.1% (rhinoviruses). The rates of admission to ITUs (Table 1 ) associated with each virus are given, and fell in the range 8.5% (rhinoviruses) and 20.0% (AdV). The rates that respiratory virus infections were associated with LRTI, URTI, no respiratory outcome and immunocompromised patients are indicated (Fig. 1) . HRSV was more frequently associated with LRTI than other respiratory viruses, whereas PIV-3 was frequently associated with upper respiratory presentations in comparison with other viruses. The proportion of virus positive samples collected from immunocompromised patients was highest for rhinoviruses and lowest for HRSV.\n\nBurden of disease of the most commonly detected respiratory viruses are described (Table 2 ). In children under 5 years of age, HRSV was clearly the leading cause of disease, attributable with nearly 70 DALYs per 1000 hospitalized population. Adenoviruses and rhinoviruses were also significant pathogens in this age group. The parainfluenza viruses caused less disease, with PIV-1 and PIV-2 associated with the least disease of those viruses analysed.\n\nIn older children between 5 and 16 years old, HRSV was again the leading cause of disease. Different sampling strategies between age categories complicates direct comparison of different age groups, but a much lower score in this age group compared with the younger children implies less disease in older children. Rhinoviruses and adenoviruses again scored highly compared with other viruses in this age group, and parainfluenza viruses maintained a minimal role in disease.\n\nIn adults between 16 and 64 years of age, influenza A was the leading cause of disease, although the score of 2.2 DALYs per 1000 population is low in comparison with the leading causes of disease in other age groups. In this age group HMPV, HRVs and PIV-1 were not associated with any respiratory disease in the hospitalized population.\n\nInfluenza A retained its status as leading viral cause of disease in older adults, with a much higher DALY score of 107.9. Influenza B and HRSV also scored highly. While we fully acknowledge the difficulties in comparing disease burden between age groups (see above), it is interesting that the score for HRSV in this age group of 41.0 is higher than that observed in under 5 s of 67.7.\n\nIn immunocompromised subjects, HRSV and rhinoviruses scored similarly at the top of the table. Adenoviruses, influenza A, PIV-3 and HMPV had comparable DALY scores in immunocompromised patients. Adenoviruses are more frequently associated with disease outcomes outside the respiratory umbrella and so caution is required with interpretation of this finding. Coronaviruses caused least disease in the immunocompromised patients.\n\nBetween age groups, the burden of disease caused by different respiratory viruses was remarkably variable (Fig. 2) . Most striking was the increasing importance of influenza viruses A and B with age, occurring inversely with the decreasing disease burden of adenoviruses. Parainfluenza-and corona-viruses were of maximal impact in the intermediate age brackets encompassing 6-64 year olds, which is largely attributable to the lack of disease caused by other viruses in these patient groups. HRSV was a substantial cause of disease regardless of age. HMPV and HRVs caused more disease in the under 16 s than in adults.\n\nThe ratio of disease burden attributable to virus infections compared to that of respiratory disease with non-viral or unidentified causes diminished with increasing age (Table 2) , likely reflecting the increasing incidence bacterial infections in older age groups. A secondary contributor to this may be reduced disease burden of respiratory virus infections with increasing age.\n\nDisease burden profiles were compared between males and females (Fig. 3) . While greater scores for disease burden were usually observed in males than females for each virus, the proportion of disease attributable to each virus was not different between males and females.\n\nIn the hospitalized population, HRSV was the leading cause of disease across children and immunocompromised patients and was a significant cause of disease in adults. The closely related HMPV caused disease in all hospitalized age cohorts (although this was less than HRSV) consistent with previous reports of its association with severe disease and mortality in older individuals. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Rhinoviruses were a significant cause of respiratory illness, particularly in young children (Fig. 2) . There are three known species of rhinoviruses (HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C), comprising well over a hundred types [21] [22] [23] [24] ; around a quarter to a third of all rhinovirus detections in the Edinburgh study population are of species C. 25 There is increasing evidence to suggest that HRV-C types are of similar clinical relevance as rhinoviruses assigned to other species. 5, 26, 27 The finding that rhinoviruses are a leading cause of acute viral respiratory illness in immunocompromised patients presents them as important opportunistic pathogens. These data together highlight the importance of including rhinoviruses in diagnostic screening protocols.\n\nInfluenza was the leading viral cause of disease in all hospitalized patients over the age of 16 years. The increasing morbidity of influenza resembles infection outcomes of other human viruses, such as measles, varicella zoster virus and Epstein Barr virus which show greater disease severity in adults compared to children.\n\nNo differences in the proportion of disease burden attributable to the most commonly detected viruses were found between males and females (Fig. 3) . In infant males, a relatively smaller airway size compared with females of the same age increases likelihood of blockages and so exacerbated respiratory disease. 28 Age stratified serologic study has demonstrated seroconversion rates approaching 100% for all ubiquitous respiratory viruses studied, 2,29-34 when Fig. 3 . Relative disease burden caused by the most commonly detected respiratory viruses in males compared with females. AdV, adenovirus; Flu, influenza; PIV, parainfluenza virus; HRSV, human respiratory syncytial virus; HCoVs, human coronaviruses; HRV, human rhinovirus. physiological differences of the lungs between males and females are still apparent. The greater disease severity observed in young males compared with their female peers during HRSV infection 35 may therefore be more widely applicable to other respiratory virus infections.\n\nThe differences between community based and hospital based causes of disease burden are apparent by comparison of this data with the Nicholson study, 7 which determined the following virus rankings in descending order of importance in community based adults over 60 years of age:\n\n1. Rhinoviruses (study predated the discovery of rhinovirus species C) 2. Causes of unknown aetiology 3. Coronaviruses (study prior to discovery of HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63) 4. Influenza viruses A and B 5. HRSV\n\nThe study did not quantify the disease burden of PIV-3 or HMPV, which were the fifth and sixth greatest causes of disease in adults over 65 years of age, ahead of coronaviruses. This study predated the discovery of HMPV, two of the four coronaviruses and rhinovirus species C. Nicholson found rhinoviruses were associated with greater disease burden that coronaviruses in the community, in keeping with observations in the hospitalized population. Influenzas A and B were far more significant in hospitalized than community based adults.\n\nThe DALY model is dynamic -changing prevalence, susceptible population and clinical presentations can be captured by and incorporated into the model to determine the worst causes of disease in real time. Though not investigated here, it is likely that DALY scores will fluctuate between seasons and year on year. The value of this method in allowing rapid determination of the clinical significance of recently discovered (or newly emerged) viruses is evident.\n\nWith the development of large-throughput screening techniques and improving clinical data management, there is increasing potential for future studies of this kind to identify the greatest causes of disease to inform diagnostic and therapeutic decision making. This study provides a framework for prospective analyses which capture clinical data for 100% of patients and follow up to determine disease duration and case fatality rates for both viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. Only when such data is available can DALY scores be applied directly to clinical decision making. It is our hope that this is the direction clinical management will drive in the future. \n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest with the design, execution or reporting of the study.\n\nEthical approval for this work was granted by the Lothian Regional Ethics Committee (08/S11/02/2).
