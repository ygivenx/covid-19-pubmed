Moreover, the production of IFN-\u03b3 by CD4 + T cells 3 7 2\n\nbut not CD8 + T cells or NK cells tended to be lower in severe cases than moderate cases.\n\nThese data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes,\n\nparticularly CD4 + T cells, resulting in diminished number as well as their IFN-\u03b3 production,\n\nwhich might be correlated with disease severity of COVID-19.\n\nCD4 + T cells play a pivotal role in regulating immune responses, orchestrating the deletion 3 7 7\n\nand amplification of immune cells, especially CD8 + T cells. CD4 + T cells facilitate 3 7 8\n\nvirus-specific antibody production via the T-dependent activation of B cells 11 . However, CD8 + 3 7 9\n\nT cells exert their effects mainly through two mechanisms, cytolytic activities against target 3 8 0 cells or cytokines secretion, including IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 as well as many chemokines 12 .\n\nThe production of IFN-\u03b3 is essential for the resistance against infection of various pathogens 3 8 2 such as virus, bacteria, and parasite 13 .
