{"title": "Platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b1 receptor is the cellular receptor for human cytomegalovirus gHgLgO trimer", "body": "These findings help explain the broad tropism of HCMV and indicate that PDGFR\u03b1 and the viral gO subunit could be targeted by novel anti-viral therapies.\n\nHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread pathogen that establishes lifelong latency in healthy individuals 10 and can cause severe disease in immunodeficient individuals and in the fetus, being the leading viral cause of congenital birth defects 11 . VR1814 is a clinical HCMV isolate that can infect both fibroblasts and epithelial cells and expresses both the gHgLgO trimer and the gHgLpUL128L pentamer [2] [3] [4] [5] . In contrast, AD169 is a laboratory adapted virus that infects fibroblasts, but not epithelial cells 3, 12, 13 and expresses the trimer, but not the pentamer due to a point mutation in UL131 ORF 2, 4 . Antibodies that bind to the shared gH glycoprotein neutralize infection of both fibroblasts and epithelial cells 14 , while antibodies to the pUL128 gene products are extremely potent in neutralizing infection of epithelial, endothelial and myeloid cells, but fail to neutralize infection of fibroblast 14, 15 . While it is well established that trimer and pentamer determine the tropism of the virus 16 , the cellular receptors involved remain a matter of debate 1 .\n\nTo identify the mechanisms that underline the cellular tropism of different HCMV strains, we investigated the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) upon exposure of epithelial cells or fibroblasts (MRC-9) to VR1814 or AD169 viruses ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Consistent with a previous report 7 , the pentamer-deficient AD169 virus led to the phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2 in fibroblasts, while it failed to activate RTK in epithelial cells (Fig. 1a) , a finding that is consistent with the inability of AD169 to infect this cell type 4, 12 . Interestingly, the clinical isolate VR1814 led to the phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2 and ErbB1 in fibroblasts, while in epithelial cells induced phosphorylation of ErbB1, ErbB2 and, to a lower extent, of PDGFR\u03b2 (Fig. 1a) . These findings are consistent with the expression of ErbB1 on both cell types and PDGFR\u03b1 on fibroblasts only ( Supplementary Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Fig. 3) . Thus, the PDGFR\u03b1 pathway is triggered only in fibroblasts by both pentamer-deficient and pentamer-sufficient viruses, while the ErbB pathway is triggered only by the pentamer-sufficient VR1814 virus in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. These data are inconsistent with a previous report that suggested that gB, which is expressed by both viruses, is a ligand for ErbB 6 , but rather suggest that the pentamer might be the trigger of the ErbB pathway.\n\nTo study the molecular interactions that lead to the triggering of the PDGFR and ErbB pathways, we produced recombinant trimer and pentamer 15 and used them in immunoprecipitation experiments. The trimer immunoprecipitation performed on cell surface biotinylated fibroblasts showed a clear band above 150 KDa (Fig. 1b) , which was identified as PDGFR\u03b1 by mass spectrometry analysis (Supplementary Table 1 ). In contrast, no specific band was obtained using pentamer on cell surface biotinylated fibroblasts, while multiple bands were obtained using pentamer on epithelial cells (Fig. 1b and Supplementary  Table 2 ). Recombinant trimer and pentamer were also used for pull-down experiments followed by western blot analysis. Pull-downs confirmed a specific interaction between trimer and PDGFR\u03b1 from fibroblasts, but not from epithelial cells (Fig. 1c) . These findings indicate that the HCMV trimer can bind to PDGFR\u03b1, which is selectively expressed on fibroblasts but not on epithelial cells, thus explaining the limited tropism of the pentamer-deficient AD169 virus 17 . In contrast, immunoprecipitation experiments failed to demonstrate a direct high affinity interaction between the pentamer and ErbB receptors, leaving the possibility that this interaction may have low affinity or requires additional molecules.\n\nTo further investigate the role of the ErbB and PDGFR pathways in the infection process, we used a genetic approach based on down-regulation and knockout of specific receptors ( Supplementary Fig. 4a,b) . Down-regulation of ErbB1 and ErbB2 by shRNA reduced infection of epithelial cells and fibroblasts by the pentamer-sufficient VR1814 virus, while it did not affect infection of fibroblasts by the pentamer-deficient AD169 virus (Fig. 1d) . In contrast, downregulation of PDGFR\u03b1 inhibited by 80% the infection of fibroblasts by AD169, but did not affect their infection by VR1814. To further validate these data we used a gene knockout approach in the haploid cell line HAP-1, which expresses PDGFR\u03b1 and ErbB2, as well as low levels of ErbB3 ( Supplementary Fig. 2c ). CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of ErbB2 and ErbB3, but not PDGFR\u03b1, strongly reduced infection of HAP-1 cells by VR1814 virus (Fig. 1e) . Reciprocally, knockout of PDGFR\u03b1, but not ErbB2 or ErbB3, completely inhibited infection by AD169. Of note, knockout of integrin \u03b21, which was shown to play a role as co-receptor in HCMV entry 18, 19 , did not affect infection by AD169 or VR1814 viruses (Fig. 1e) , a finding which suggests that multiple integrins may play a role as co-receptors in HCMV entry 18, 19 .\n\nConsistent results were obtained using a lentiviral-mediated over-expression approach ( Fig.  1f and Supplementary Fig. 4c,d) . ErbB2 over-expression in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts led to a 2-3 fold higher infection by VR1814, while over-expression of PDGFR\u03b1 in epithelial cells rendered the cells permissive to infection by the pentamer-deficient AD169 virus and increased infection by VR1814 virus by 2 fold (Fig. 1f) . Collectively, the above results indicate that pentamer-sufficient VR1814 virus, can trigger PDGFR and ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases pathways onto fibroblasts, while the pentamer-deficient AD169 virus relies only on PDGFR\u03b1\n\nTo address viral entry mechanisms into fibroblasts, we measured the capacity of antibodies and soluble ligands to inhibit infection. Fibroblast infection by the AD169 virus was inhibited by all ligands that interfere with the trimer-PDGFR\u03b1 interaction, namely soluble PDGFR\u03b1, soluble gHgLgO trimer, anti-PDGFR\u03b1, anti-gH and anti-gO monoclonal antibodies ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5a -d). Infection of fibroblasts by the VR1814 virus was inhibited by an anti-gH antibody that targets both trimer and pentamer 14,20 and a monoclonal anti-gO antibody ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 5a-d) . Furthermore, while infection of fibroblasts by VR1814 was not affected by soluble trimer or pentamer when used alone, the combination of soluble trimer and pentamer was strongly inhibitory (Fig.  2c) . Similarly, fibroblasts infection by VR1814 was potently inhibited by a combination of anti-pUL128 antibody and either soluble PDGFR\u03b1 or anti-gO antibody ( Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 5a-c) .\n\nSimilar experiments using antibodies and soluble ligands were performed to address the mechanisms of viral entry into epithelial cells. Infection by VR1814 was strongly inhibited by anti-pUL128 antibody and to a lower extent, by anti-gH antibody or soluble pentamer, as previously reported 14, 15, 21 (Fig. 2e) . Remarkably, a monoclonal anti-gO was also able to reduce ARPE-19 infection (Fig. 2e) . This surprising result suggests that the trimer might have a dual function of viral ligand and activator of gB fusogenic activity, as recently proposed 22, 23 . Since we did not find evidence for binding of pentamer to ErbB receptors, we tested the inhibitory capacity of ErbB ligands, which down-regulate the cognate receptors ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Interestingly, infection of epithelial cells was inhibited by preincubation of the cells with HB-EGF (which binds to ErbB1 and ErbB4), EGF (which binds to ErbB1) or Nrg-1 (which binds to ErbB4 on ARPE-19 cells) (Fig. 2f) . These results support the notion that entry into epithelial cells relies on ErbB receptors.\n\nTo investigate the molecular interactions involved in the HCMV target cell tropism, we probed trimer and pentamer with PDGFR\u03b1 and ErbB1 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and biolayer interferometry (BLI). A high affinity interaction between trimer and PDGFR\u03b1 was detected using both SPR and BLI, with a KD value of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22129 M (Fig. 3a,c) . The trimer/PDGFR\u03b1 complex was still accessible to two neutralizing antibodies specific for gH (Fig. 3d) . Interestingly, soluble gHgL dimer did not bind to PDGFR\u03b1 (Fig. 3d) , indicating that the gO component of the trimer is essential for binding. Similar SPR experiments performed with soluble pentamer and ErbB1-4 receptors or PDGFR\u03b1 did not reveal any interactions ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ).\n\nTo further investigate the interaction between the gHgLgO trimer and PDGFR\u03b1, we studied complex formation in solution using size-exclusion chromatography and visualized the complexes by electron microscopy. Addition of PDGFR\u03b1 to soluble trimer shifted the chromatography peak to a lower retention time, indicating formation of a complex (Fig.  4a,b) . Addition of a Fab fragment of the anti-gH antibody 13H11 to the purified complex further decrease the complex's retention time (Fig. 4c) . SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the purified trimer-PDGFR\u03b1 and 13H11-trimer-PDGFR\u03b1 complexes contained all indicated components (Fig. 4d ). The images of the complexes formed were visualized by negative staining and transmission electron microscopy with 2D averaging (Fig. 4e -h and Supplementary Fig. 8 ). The gHgLgO trimer alone presented a boot shaped structure, wherein gHgL formed the elongated structure and gO the angled extension (Fig. 4e, h) , similar to what was recently reported 26 . Interestingly, and in agreement with the BLI results, the image of gHgLgO trimer-PDGFR\u03b1 complex revealed that only the gO subunit interacts with PDGFR\u03b1, it appeared that three Ig-like domains of the PDGFR\u03b1 were visible in the 2D-averaged density, resembling the mode of interaction between platelet-derived growth factor and its receptor ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). However, not all domains of PDGFR\u03b1 were well-defined due to its flexibility 27 (Fig. 4f ). This result was further confirmed by the observation that 13H11 Fab bound to a site of gH away from the gO interacting face and, therefore, did not interfere with binding of gO to PDGFR\u03b1 ( Fig. 3c and Fig. 4g ). Consequently, we conclude that the neutralizing activity of 13H11 is not due to the inhibition of trimer-PDGFR\u03b1 interaction but may be dependent on its ability to interfere with the capacity of the complex to trigger gB and consequently viral fusion 20 .\n\nThis study demonstrates that HCMV infection of fibroblasts relies on the direct interaction of the gHgLgO trimer with PDGFR\u03b1 and identifies gO as the essential component for this interaction. In contrast, we could not find evidence of a direct interaction between the gHgLpUL128L pentamer and the ErbB receptors. However, using wild-type pentamer-deficient virus and cellular knockdown, we reported that the ErbB pathway activation might be involved in pentamer-dependent tropism. It is therefore tempting to suggest that HCMV pentamer induces ErbB activation, which induces macropinocytosis, as this endocytic mechanism was already proposed to mediate HCMV entry in epithelial cell 9, 24 .\n\nThe broad distribution of the PDGFR\u03b1 and ErbB receptors is consistent with the ability of HCMV to infect different cell types, ranging from epithelial, endothelial, myeloid, hematopoietic precursors, neuronal, astrocytes and glial cells expressing either PDGFR\u03b1 and/or the ErbB receptors 25 . The role of PDGFR\u03b1 as a HCMV receptor was recently challenged by Vanarsdall and colleagues 9 showing that PDGF-AA and anti-PDGFR\u03b1 antibodies did not block infection of fibroblasts by a HCMV clinical isolate. These results are in agreement with our finding. Pentamer-sufficient virus might alter the nature of the entry pathway by inducing viral endocytosis.\n\nTwo previous studies, suggested that gB binds to ErbB1 or PDGFR\u03b1 6, 7 . However, this model is inconsistent with the differential tropism of wild type and pentamer-deficient viruses, since both viruses express gB. In addition, the recent experiment showing that gB expressed on target cells can promote the fusion of gB-deficient trimer-expressing virus might suggest that gB lacks a cellular receptor 26 . It is therefore tempting to suggest that the interaction of gB with PDGFR\u03b1 and ErbB1 might be mediated by pentamer and trimer, which might have the dual function of cellular receptor binding and of triggering the fusogenic activity of gB as proposed recently for the trimer 22, 23 and similarly to what described for gD in HSV-1 27 .\n\nImportantly, we also identified an anti-gO monoclonal antibody isolated from a HCMV seropositive donor. Surprisingly, this antibody neutralized HCMV VR1814 with the same potency on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, indicating that gHgLgO trimeric complex is necessary for viral entry on all cell types. This finding is consistent with recent studies reporting gHgLgO as the only promoter of gB fusion 22, 23 . Nonetheless, gB-mediated fusion occurs at the plasma membrane in fibroblast 28 , while viral fusion happens in the endosome of epithelial, endothelial and myeloid cells 9,29,30 that do not express PDGFR\u03b1. It will be interesting to determine the mechanism of trimer-induced endosomal fusion in absence of PDGFR\u03b1.\n\nIn conclusion, here we demonstrated that the HCMV trimer cellular receptor is PDGFR\u03b1. We also showed that HCMV can use PDGFR and ErbB receptor for entry into fibroblast involving pentamer and trimer ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ). The identification of multiple pathways may explain the broad HCMV tropism and assists in the development of anti-viral agents and vaccines effectively controlling viral infection and dissemination.\n\nARPE-19 retinal pigmented epithelium cell line (ATCC CRL-2302) was cultured in D-MEM/F-12 (Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. MRC-9 fibroblast cell line (ATCC CCL-212) was cultured in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin. HAP-1 cells, parental line and HAP-1 CRISPR knockouts, were obtained from Horizon Genomics GmbH and cultured in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) in the presence of 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. All cell lines were confirmed to be free of Mycoplasma. HCMV clinical isolate VR1814 and laboratory-adapted strain AD169 were kindly provided by Virologia e Microbiologia, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy. HCMV VR1814 and AD169 were propagated on HUVEC cells and fibroblasts respectively. ARPE-19, MRC-9 and HAP-1 cells are not listed according to ICLAC 3/10/2014. ARPE-19, MRC-9 and HAP-1 cells 31 were authenticated by analysis of Short tandem repeat (STR) loci at ATCC (ARPE-19, MRC-9) and Horizon Genomics GmbH (HAP-1).\n\nARPE-19 and MRC-9 cells were grown to confluency in 10 cm culture dishes (Nunc, Thermo Scientific). Before biotinylation cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 2 ml of 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin in PBS per plate for 15 minutes (Thermo Scientific). Reactions were quenched by addition of 10% FBS for 10 minutes on ice. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 1 ml/per plate of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% n-Dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside, 50 mM Tris pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1X Complete protease inhibitor from Roche). Centrifuged cell lysates were incubated with 30 \u03bcg of trimer or pentamer (pre-complexed with 30 \u03bcg of 13H11 antibody) for 3 hours with continuous shaking. Protein A beads were subsequently added to the cell lysates for 90 minutes. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and one time with PBS, then boiled in reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Detection was performed with streptavidin-HRP conjugate (Upsala) in 1% BSA for 1 hour at RT. For pull down experiment MRC-9 or ARPE-19 cell lysates were incubated with 30 \u03bcg of trimer or pentamer for 3 hours with continuous shaking. StrepTactin sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were subsequently added to the cell lysates for 90 minutes. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and one time with PBS, then boiled in reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Detection was performed with rabbit polyclonal anti-PDGFR-\u03b1 antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) in 1% BSA for 2 hours at RT. Uncropped images of western blot are shown in Supplementary Fig. 11 .\n\nWe performed an ELISA to ensure that the particles used for the experiment were similar in term of gH derived glycoprotein content (trimer and pentamer). AD169 and VR1814 particles were coated on 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Nunc), blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and incubated with titrated antibodies (13H11), followed by APconjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody (Southern Biotech, catalogue no. 2040-04). Plates were then washed, substrate (p-NPP, Sigma) was added and plates were read at 405 nm.\n\nFor cell surface staining, adherent cells (ARPE-19, MRC-9 and HAP1) were gently detached with a cell scraper and washed twice with PBS + 2% FBS, incubated with PDGFR\u03b1-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences, clone \u03b1R1 and Sino biological, clone 5A10H9), mouse monoclonal anti-ErbB1 (Sigma, clone 225), mouse monoclonal anti-ErbB2, anti-ErbB3, anti-ErbB4 (R&D systems, Clone 191924, Clone 66223, Clone 182818) or mouse IgG1 anti-CMV pp72 (clone 6E1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse IgG2a H1P73, mouse IgG2b (MA5-14447; Invitrogen) at 2 \u03bcg/ml for 30 minutes on ice for isotype control. After two washes, cells were incubated with the following secondary antibodies: goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) AlexaFluor 594 conjugated (Invitrogen) at 2 \u03bcg/ml for 30 minutes on ice, washed twice and acquired with a FACSFortessa (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. For intracellular staining, 293Expi cells were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then stained with the anti-gO antibodies or 13H11 mab (as isotype control) at 2 \u03bcg/ml for 30 minutes on ice, washed and incubated with goat anti-Human IgG (H+L) AlexaFluor 594 conjugated (Invitrogen) at 2 \u03bcg/ml for 30 minutes on ice, washed twice and acquired with a FACSFortessa flow cytometer. Analysis was performed with FlowJo software.\n\nHuman ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB4 and PDGFR\u03b1 were ordered from GenEZ\u2122 ORF database (Genscript). Lentiviral vectors were generated by cloning ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB4 and PDGFR\u03b1 in pCDH-EF1-MCS (System Biosciences). Lentiviral particles were generated by PEI transfection of HEK293FT (Invitrogen) with pCDH, pMD2.G (addgene), psPAX (addgene) and purified on a sucrose cushion. ARPE-19 and MRC-9 were transduced at 60% confluency and expression was accessed after two days. Down regulations of ErbB1, ErbB2 and PDGFR\u03b1 were done by lentiviral transduction of cells using 4 unique 29mer shRNA constructs in pGFP-C-shLenti and 29-mer scrambled shRNA cassette in pGFP-C-shLenti Vector (Origene) using manufacturer's instructions. Best constructs were selected by puromycin selection and effective down regulation of the target gene without decrease in cell viability. Sequence of the shRNAs used are listed thereafter. \n\nHuman phospho-RTK array was performed with a kit (R&D systems, catalogue number ARY-001B). ARPE-19 and MRC-9 were grown in T75 plate (4 million cells total) and infected with the different virus strains for 10 minutes with a MOI of 1. Both viruses were purified by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient and dialyzed against PBS with a membrane cut off 100 kDa to remove proteins and small molecules that could co-sedimented with the viruses. Both viruses were considered similar for the overall content of gH derived glycoprotein and gO content. Glycoprotein O content for AD169 and VR1814 viruses was analyzed by western blot (Supplementary Fig. 5c ). Glycoprotein H quantity was analyzed by both mass spectrometry (Supplementary Table 3 , PRIDE repository dataset identifier PXD003810) and ELISA (Supplementary Fig. 5d ).\n\nMemory B cells were isolated from cryopreserved PBMCs using CD22 microbeads or anti-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) after staining of PBMCs with CD22-FITC, and were immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and CpG in multiple wells as described previously 32 . Supernatants of immortalized memory B cells collected after 2 weeks were screened for their ability to bind gO or neutralize HCMV virus (AD169) infections in high-throughput FACS and micro-neutralization assays, respectively. Positive EBV-B cell cultures were expanded in complete RPMI medium. The antibodies were affinity purified by protein A chromatography (GE Healthcare).\n\ngHgLgO, gHgLgO-PDGFR and 13H11-gHgLgO-PDGFR complexes were diluted to about 0.01 mg/ml, adsorbed to freshly glow-discharged carbon-film grids for 15 s, washed with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl, and stained with 0.7% uranyl formate, pH 5. Images were collected semi-automatically with SerialEM 33 on an FEI Tecnai T20 operating at 200 kV and equipped with a 2,000 \u00d7 2,000 Eagle CCD camera at a pixel size of 0.22 nm/px. Particles were picked automatically and manually using e2boxer from the EMAN2 software package 34 . Initial reference-free 2D class averages were obtained in EMAN2. Further 2D classification was performed using reference-free alignment and correspondence analysis in SPIDER 35 . Numbers of particles used for 2D was analysis: 10,356 (gHgLgO); 43,000 (gHgLgO-PDGFR) and 12,947 (13H11-gHgLgO-PDGFR).\n\nTo obtain the 3D map of gHgLgO, the dataset containing 10,356 particles was subjected to iterative stable alignment and clustering (ISAC) 36 in SPARX 37 . The ISAC classes were then used to generate an initial 3D map in EMAN2, which was used as the initial model for threedimensional reconstruction and refinement using reference projections in SPIDER 38 . The resolution of the final map was 19.3 \u00c5 when a Fourier shell correlation (FSC) threshold of 0.5 was used. The map was visualized in UCSF Chimera 39 . The reconstruction data have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (Accession Code: EMD-3391).\n\nExtracellular domain of PDGFR\u03b1 with C-terminal encoding eight Histidine and a twin strep tags was produced in HEK 293 GnTI \u2212/\u2212 cells via transient transfection. Cell supernatant was batch-incubated with 5 ml complete His-Tag Purification Resin (Roche) at room temperature for 30 minutes with continuous inversion mixing. 6 mM imidazole was added to reduce nonspecific binding. The resin was packed into a column and sequentially washed with 3 column volume of buffers containing 6 mM and 15 mM imidazole in 400 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris/Cl \u2212 pH7.5. The protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. Expression and purification of the soluble pentamer was previously described by our group 15 . Soluble trimer complex was generated using a single polycistronic vector encoding three genes (gH, gL, and gO). The gH subunit lacking the transmembrane domain and modified at the C-terminus by addition of a TEV cleavage site, six histidine and a twin strep tags was separated from gL by a self-cleaving 2A peptide. The gHgL and gO subunits were cloned, respectively, in pEE6.4 and pEE12.4 vectors (Lonza Biologics). Stable cell line secreting the HCMV trimer, was generated by nucleofection of CHO-K1 SV line (GS-System, Lonza). For protein expression, CHO cells were seeded at 1\u00d710 6 /ml in ProCho5 (Lonza); after 10 days, supernatants were harvested and loaded on IMAC column eluted with imidazole and further purified by affinity column StrepTactin II (Qiagen). Histidine and twin strep tags were removed by treatment with the TEV protease. Protease and uncleaved proteins were removed by negative chromatography. Finally, proteins were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 from GE Healthcare). Soluble dimer was generated by transient transfection of gH2AgL in pEE6.4 vectors (Lonza Biologics). Dimer protein purification was performed as described above.\n\nRecombinant EGF, HB-EGF, Nrg-1, extracellular domain of PDGFR\u03b1-Fc conjugated, extracellular domain of ErbB1-Fc conjugated, extracellular domain of ErbB2-Fc conjugated, extracellular domain of ErbB3-Fc conjugated, extracellular domain of ErbB4-Fc conjugated were obtained from R&D systems.\n\nFor RT-PCR, 100 cells per reaction were used. Reverse transcription was performed with the SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen) and random hexamer. The following, PCR was performed with specific primer listed below using the Q5 polymerase (NEB). \n\nFort\u00e9Bio Octet Red384 instrument was used to measure binding of gHgLgO trimer to immobilized PDGFR\u03b1-Fc receptor. PDGFR\u03b1-Fc receptor at 10 nM was loaded during 8 minutes on Protein G tips and Biosensor tips were then equilibrated for 2 minutes prior to measuring association for 8 minutes and dissociation for 10 minutes of the gHgLgO trimer. Protein G sensors loaded with PDGFR\u03b1-Fc complexes were blocked and saturated for 20 minutes in a solution containing an unspecific human IgG1 at 60 nM prior to be dipped in a new well containing the gHgLgO trimer at 10 nM to form the complex. In a following step, the sensors were dipped into anti-gH neutralizing antibodies (13H11 and 11B12 at 14 nM) or anti-pUL128 antibody (15D8 at 14 nM) as control. Assays were performed with agitation set to 1,000 rpm in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.002% Tween-20. Data analysis and curve fitting were carried out using Octet software, version 8.0.\n\nThe experiments were carried out at 25\u00b0C on a ProteON XPR-36 instrument (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in a PBS buffer (Gibco, Invitrogen), 0.05% Tween-20. The indicated proteins were immobilized on a GLM sensor chip surface through amine coupling at 1000 response units (RU) and a blank surface with no protein was created under identical coupling conditions for use as a reference. Analyte proteins (gHgL dimer, gHgLgO trimer and gHgLpUL128L pentamer) were injected at a flow rate of 100 \u03bcl/min, at concentrations of 100, 75, 50, 25 and 12.5 nM in different sensor channels. The data were processed using Proteon software and double referenced by subtraction of the blank surface and buffer only injection before local fitting of the data. Curve fitting were locally fitted, to perform KD calculation.\n\nConfluent layers of ARPE-19, MRC-9 or HAP1 cells in 96-well flat-bottom plates were infected with a fixed amount of virus. MOI of infection (0.5) was chosen to give 500 to 1000 infected cells per microscopic field. 48 hours post-infection the cells were fixed with 5% acetic acid in methanol for 7 minutes on ice, washed four times with PBS and then stained with 0.5 \u03bcg/ml of mouse anti-pp72 antibody for 2 hours on ice. After four PBS washes, cells were incubated with 1 \u03bcg/ml of a goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) AlexaFluor 594 conjugated (Invitrogen). After four PBS washes, cells were counterstained with DAPI, images were acquired on BD Pathway bioimaging system and percentage of the infected cells was automatically calculated by BD AttoVision software. The number of infected cells was plotted as histograms and dose response curves were generated by plotting the relative infected cells against the ligand or antibodies dilutions.\n\nNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Data were analyzed with Prism 6 (GraphPad Software) using the two-tailed non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for two groups' comparison, or Kruskall-Wallis test (and Dunn's posttest) when three or more groups were compared.\n\nThe reagents described in the manuscript can be obtained through a MTA.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\n(a-d) MRC-9 cells were exposed to VR1814 or AD169 viruses that had been pre-incubated with different concentrations of antibodies or soluble ligands, alone or in different combinations: neutralizing antibodies specific for gH (13H11) or UL128/130/131 (7I13) or gO (CVB234); blocking antibody to PDGFR\u03b1 (\u03b1R1), soluble trimer, soluble pentamer or soluble PDGFR\u03b1.
