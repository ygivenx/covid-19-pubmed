On the other hand, changes in miRNA expression can also lead to increases in antiviral effector activities resulting in decreased virus replication. This review focuses on recent advances in on our understanding of RNA viruses and how they have evolved to use host miRNAs to evade antiviral immune responses, thus leading to enhanced virus replication and pathogenesis. of the pathobiological features of a virus infection within a specific host (e.g., unexplained restriction in particular tissues) and using disease relevant cell lines that express a miRNA of interest might also lead to the identification of cell-specific miRNAs that contribute to viral pathogenesis.\n\nWhile miRNA:RNA viral genome interactions are governed by many of the same mechanisms governing miRNA:mRNA interactions, investigation of their role in viral pathogenesis should take into account cell-specificity, the role of non-canonical miRNA target sites, the potential for mild alteration of virus activities at the cellular level leading to large effects in the host, and the potential for miRNA inhibition to alter cell-cell signaling in the complex environment of an infected animal. These ideas are explored in greater detail below.\n\nEvidence is accumulating that host miRNAs can bind to a broad range of RNA viruses directly regulating their pathogenesis (Table 1) . A positive-strand RNA virus genome mimics cellular mRNAs allowing for direct binding of the miRNA to the viral RNA and potentially, the regulation is analogous to that of host mRNAs. Two outcomes of these interactions have thus far been identified where virus replication is directly altered: 1) inhibition of translation of the virus genome preventing virus replication [11] and 2) stabilization of the virus RNA thereby enhancing replication (Key Figure, Figure 1 ) [10, 24] . Both of these mechanisms reveal a novel method for regulating RNA virus replication within specific cells and/or tissues. In addition to expression of the virus receptor on the cell surface, miRNA-mediated virus repression may be another mechanism for determining cell permissiveness to infection. Another commonality of these two mechanisms is that both lead to a fitness advantage for the virus at the level of the infected host, either directly by increasing replication --as with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) [10, 24] --or indirectly, by suppressing innate immune responses and leading to increased overall host-level replication --as in the case of eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) [11] . Considering the ability of RNA viruses to rapidly alter their genomes in the face of selective pressure [25] , it may be that productive miRNA:RNA virus interactions are only maintained when a significant replicative advantage is conferred to the virus. Below, the outcomes of direct binding of miRNA to RNA virus genomes are discussed in detail.\n\nAlphaviruses-EEEV, an alphavirus, causes the most acutely virulent mosquito-borne virus disease in the United States with a >30% mortality rate in humans, and long-term neurological sequelae in surviving individuals [26] . In humans, EEEV infection is characterized by a limited disease prodrome prior to manifestation of encephalitis due to the inability of EEEV to replicate in hematopoietic cells and to elicit a strong innate immune response [11, 27] . EEEV is a positive-sense RNA virus that encodes three canonical and one non-canonical miRNA binding sites in the 3' NTR that are specific for the hematopoietic cell-specific miRNA, miR-142-3p [11] . miR-142-3p expression has been shown to prevent translation of the incoming EEEV virus genome and prevent virus replication in both human and murine macrophages as well as dendritic cells [11] . This inhibition of myeloid cell replication prevented IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction in vivo, directly contributing to the extreme virulence of EEEV that is seen in mice, and presumably in humans [11] . Mutation of the miR-142-3p binding sites in the EEEV genome has been shown to allow virus translation and replication in both human and murine myeloid cells which was shown to lead to systemic IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production and virus attenuation in mice. Presumably, strong selective pressure has maintained these miR-142-3p binding sites, since 17 out of 23 North American EEEV strains isolated from nature have the exact same sequence and location within the 3' NTR [11] .\n\nRetroviruses-Retroviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with two different points in the virus lifecycle where miRNAs can bind to virus RNA: the genomic RNA, and the RNA transcribed from integrated DNA. For example, primate foamy retrovirus type 1 (PFV-1) encodes a binding site for miR-32 in the 3' NTR of multiple protein transcripts, that can inhibit PFV-1 replication. To evade miR-32 repression, PFV-1 encodes a transactivator protein, Tas, that non-specifically suppresses the miRNA processing pathway and potentially inhibits the production of miRNAs that might limit virus replication, including miR-32 in infected mammalian cells [28] . Human T-cell leukemia virus, type I (HTLV-1) translation is inhibited in resting human T cells by miR-28-3p. Indeed, a single nucleotide variant in the miR-28-3p target sequence of the Japanese ATK-1 strain has been shown to confer miR-28-3p translational repression resistance, increasing both virus replication as well as transmission between individuals, occurrences not normally seen in other HTLV-1 strains [29] . miRNA can also help contribute to retrovirus latency within T cells by preventing translation of the virus RNA and suppressing virus replication. For example, during human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection of CD4 + T cells in vitro, expression of miR-28-5p, miR-150, miR-223, and miR-382 has been found to mediate translational repression of HIV-1 RNA [30] . Another miRNA, miR-29a, functions through a different mechanism to restrict virus replication during HIV-1 infection by binding to the 3' NTR, leading to its increased association with the RISC complex and P bodies, and thus preventing virus translation [31] .\n\nPicornaviruses-A similar inhibition of virus translation and replication occurs following upregulation of miR-296-5p by the positive-sense picornavirus family member, enterovirus 71 (EV71). miR-296-5p negatively regulates virus replication in a human neuronal cell line due to the presence of two miR-295-5p binding sites in the coding regions of viral proteins VP1 and VP3 [13] . Natural variants of EV71 bear mutations in the miR-296-5p binding sites, rendering this virus insensitive to miR-296-5p restriction [13] . EV71 also contains a binding site for miR-23b; however, miR-23b is naturally downregulated during EV71 virus infection of monkey epithelial cells, thus preventing miR-23b binding to the virus genome and inhibiting virus replication [32] .\n\nOrthomyxoviruses-miRNAs can also bind to negative-strand RNA viruses after transcription of the negative-strand RNA genome into the positive-sense RNA intermediate needed for virus replication. For instance, miR-323, miR-491, miR-485, miR-654, and miR-3145 have been shown to bind to the coding region of the influenza PB1 gene segment Trobaugh leading to RNA degradation in infected human and canine epithelial cell lines in vitro [12, 33, 34] . Similar degradation of viral RNA was found when the miRNA let-7c, bound to the 3' NTR of the influenza matrix protein in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells [35] .\n\nOther potential miRNA binding sites in the influenza RNA genome have been computationally predicted; however, they have yet to be experimentally validated [36, 37] . Even though a miRNA may restrict influenza virus replication in cell culture, it may not be constitutively expressed in infected cells in vivo and, therefore, may not necessarily affect virus pathogenesis in vivo [33] .\n\nOther Viruses-Finally, interactions between miRNAs and RNA viruses also occur with non-human viruses. In chickens, infectious bursal disease virus replication is inhibited by miR-21 due to miR-21 binding sites in the coding region of the VP1 protein [38] . In pigs, naturally minimally permissive cells can express multiple miRNAs that inhibit replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [39, 40] . Treatment with a miR-181 mimic limits PRRSV replication in vivo leading to extended infected pig survival times, thus demonstrating the therapeutic potential of this miRNA during an RNA virus infection [39] . While these studies suggest wide-spread negative regulation of RNA virus replication by host cell miRNAs, the capacity for RNA viruses to mutate rapidly to eliminate miRNA binding [9, 41, 42] indicates that direct antiviral activities of miRNAs may be limited to particular cells, or to a subset of viral quasispecies present at any given time within the host. Therefore, any antiviral effects at the cellular level should be considered in the context of the overall effect on tissue-specific virus inhibition upon viral quasispecies fitness in the intact host, and also on transmission between hosts.\n\nA non-canonical interaction between miRNAs and RNA viruses has been identified that leads to increased stability of the viral RNA. The most studied interaction of this type was first identified in 2005 and occurs between liver-specific miR-122, and HCV. Rather than binding to the 3'NTR, miR-122 bound to the 5' NTR of HCV [10] preventing 5' host exonuclease activity and RNA degradation in the infected human hepatocarcinoma derived cell line, Huh-7 [24] . Moreover, removal of miR-122 from Huh-7 cells could reduce HCV replication [10] . As such, miR-122 is currently an active target for antiviral therapeutics in the treatment of chronic HCV infection [10, 43] . Recently, miRNAs were also found to increase RNA stability through interactions with the 3' NTR; miR-17 and let-7c both bound to the 3' NTR of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) genome, increasing virus translation and RNA stability, rather than translational repression [23] . Interestingly, let-7 sites are present within a number of RNA viruses including alphaviruses [23] . The ability of two diverse members of the Flaviviridae family, HCV and BVDV, to utilize host miRNAs to help stabilize virus RNA through two different sites within the virus genome suggests that this interaction might have evolved independently. It will be interesting to determine whether other virus families use miRNAs in a similar manner to help stabilize viral RNA. \n\nRecognition of viral infection by pattern-recognition receptors initiates the innate immune response signaling cascade leading to transcription factor activation and changes in the cell transcriptome, including changes in miRNA expression (Key Figure, Figure 1 ) [44] . It has been proposed that a critical role for miRNAs during a viral infection is to modulate cytokine responses, either by augmenting productive responses or by suppressing potentially damaging responses [45] . Specific miRNA expression patterns have been associated with pathogenic versus attenuated influenza virus [46] and hantavirus (Hantaan) [47] infections.\n\nViruses may also alter global miRNA activity by binding and sequestering free miRNA. For example, miR-122 binding to HCV has been shown to sequester and reduce free miR-122 inside Huh-7 cells leading to changes in expression of the cellular proteins that are normally repressed by miR-122 [48] . Even though both miR-17 and let-7c can bind the BVDV genome, only miR-17 sequestration has been reported to lead to changes in the host transcriptome, demonstrating that not all miRNA:RNA interactions lead to similar results [23] . Such changes in the host transcriptome due to sequestration may positively or negatively affect virus replication and pathogenesis and may vary depending on the cell and tissue expression of each miRNA. Finally, RNA viruses can encode proteins that modulate the miRNA or RNAi pathway, especially in invertebrates (Box 2). Moreover, as discussed below, RNA virus infection can lead to many changes in miRNA expression (Table 2) influencing viral replication as well as host immune responses.\n\nIn addition to tissue-specific changes in miRNA expression taking place during viral infections (Box 3), other important changes in miRNA-mediated protein expression can occur. For instance, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 is a key cytokine induced by viral infection that leads to the downstream upregulation of antiviral ISGs. Viruses have evolved multiple mechanisms to evade the IFN system to establish a productive infection. Typically, during an infection, viral proteins either inhibit pattern recognition receptor recognition or downstream signaling cascades to prevent ISG induction [49] . However, a role for virus-mediated regulation of the IFN signaling cascade through changes in host miRNA levels has recently been proposed. For example, EV71 [50] , dengue virus (DENV) [51] , and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [52] induction of miR-146a in infected cells has been shown to negatively regulate the IFN signaling protein, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 6 (TRAF6), thus preventing the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. In addition, downregulation of miR-432 by JEV infection has been reported to increase expression of the negative regulator of cytokine signaling, suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5) in infected human microglial cells, thereby dampening the antiviral response [53] . Induction of miR-29c, miR-451, and miR-485 in influenza-infected cells has also been found to limit cytokine and chemokine responses through inhibition of different antiviral proteins (Table 2) , and to prevent overactive IFN and inflammatory responses [34, 54, 55] . HCV infection can upregulate miR-758 [56] , miR-130a [57] , and miR-373 [58] , thus inhibiting different components of IFN signaling to decrease IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production ( Table 2) . Another example is avian leukosis virus subgroup J infection, which in chicken spleens, was shown to lead to miR-23b expression, and downregulation of both interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) levels and innate immune induction [59] . It is likely that future work will identify more miRNAs that are involved in downregulating the innate immune response during RNA virus infections.\n\nFrom another angle, virus infection may also increase the levels of miRNAs leading to the upregulation of antiviral molecules that are detrimental to virus replication. For example, while miR-130a can downregulate interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) protein levels after HCV infection to increase virus replication [57] , miR-130a induction can also lead to antiviral ISG expression, increased IFN production, and reduced virus replication in Huh-7.5.1 hepatocarcinoma cells [60] . These results demonstrate that the same miRNA can have pleotropic effects during virus infection which may be due to two different mechanisms: direct targeting of a cellular protein (IFITM1) [57] or targeting of an unknown master regulator that controls the expression of many ISGs [60] . Interestingly, upregulation of miR-130a following HCV infection can also downregulate the expression of miR-122, providing a second mechanism to limit HCV replication [60] . Following DENV infection of a human monocyte cell line, miR-30e* induction has been shown to suppress virus replication by downregulating NFKB Inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA; I\u03baB\u03b1) leading to continual nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activation and upregulation of ISGs and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production [61] . Finally, rather than modulating ISG levels, miR-532-5p upregulation during West Nile virus (WNV) infection has been shown to lead to downregulation of SEC14 and spectrin domain containing 1 (SESTD1) and TGF-beta activated kinase 1/MAP3K7 binding protein 3 (TAB3), two proteins required for virus replication in infected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells [62] .\n\nWith some viruses, virus-encoded proteins can inhibit the upregulation of miRNAs that are triggered after virus infection to suppress the innate immune response. For example, the borna disease virus phosphoprotein was shown to inhibit the expression of a known regulator of innate immune responses, miR-155, limiting the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 during infection in human oligodendroglioma cells [63] . Also, the coronavirus OC43 nucleocapsid protein has been found to bind the NF-\u03baB negative regulator, miR-9, in HEK293T cells, allowing for continual NF-\u03baB translation; however, the role of this activity during coronavirus infection remains unclear [64] . The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) NS1 and NS2 proteins can antagonize let-7i and miR-30b induction through the inhibition of innate immune signaling proteins in human bronchial epithelial cells [65] . EV71 3C protein can block the upregulation of miR-526a by degrading IRF7, and preventing an enhancement of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signaling [66] . Finally, viral protein expression can also lead to the upregulation of miRNAs, as in the case of the RSV G protein, which can increase let-7f expression, negatively regulating IFN production and delaying virus clearance in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells [67] . Potentially, virus protein-mediated changes in miRNA expression may occur through an indirect mechanism governed by virus inhibition of the innate immune response rather than a direct interaction between the virus protein and the transcription factors that regulate miRNA expression, but further experimentation would be required to elucidate this point. \n\nAs described above, miRNA sequestration and/or alteration of expression levels by RNA viruses can lead to cellular transcriptome changes that promote favorable conditions for virus replication. For example, influenza virus infection has been shown to downregulate miR-24 in A549 cells, leading to increased furin protease levels and thus, increased cleavage of the influenza hemagglutinin protein, leading to increased number of infectious influenza particles [68] . Also in A549 cells, influenza virus downregulation of miR-548an was shown to lead to increased NS1-binding protein levels and increase RNA stability by decreasing cellular apoptosis [69] . In another study, EV71 infection increased miR-141 levels in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells, leading to the downregulation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E protein, thus contributing to the switch from cap-dependent translation of cellular mRNAs to cap-independent translation of viral RNAs [70] . Furthermore, miR-146a-5p upregulation after HCV infection of human hepatocytes and in liver tissues from HCVinfected patients has been shown to promote the assembly of virus particles and egress from an infected cell increasing HCV infection through an unknown mechanism [71] . In another example, RSV infection of human bronchial epithelial cells resulted in the downregulation of miR-221 levels, preventing infected cell apoptosis and leading to increased virus replication [72] . Finally, transfection of miRNAs into cells prior to virus infection has led to the identification of novel proteins involved in virus replication, such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (C1/C2) (hnRNP C) or leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) with poliovirus [73] , or influenza infections, respectively [74] . The use of miRNA expression screens to identify novel cellular proteins involved in RNA virus replication will be more common in the future. However, confirmation of the role of these miRNAs in vivo will be needed to determine their specific functional contribution to viral replication and pathogenesis.\n\nRNA viruses can mutate rapidly due to the lack of proofreading activity in the RNA polymerase [75] . Therefore, positive selection, or at least the absence of negative selection, is likely to be required to maintain the miRNA binding sites within the virus genome. For example, EEEV replication in a non-miR-142-3p expressing mammalian cell line resulted in a 238 nucleotide deletion in the 3' NTR encompassing all of the miR-142-3p binding sites [41] . Similarly, artificially inserted miRNA binding sites in the 3' NTR of DENV [42] and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) [14] were deleted in vivo during infection of mice.\n\nThese results demonstrate that miRNA binding sites in the 3' NTR without a positive influence on virus replication can be rapidly deleted in vivo. Therefore, it is unclear how sites that negatively impact replication might be retained in virus populations. With EEEV, replication in the mosquito vector appears to provide positive selection for retention of miR-142-3p binding sites as deletion of the sites decreased virus replication in mosquito cell cultures and greatly suppressed acquisition by mosquito vectors [11] . By contrast, site removal has no impact on replication in mammalian cells that do not express the miRNA. Mosquitoes do not express miR-142-3p [76] suggesting that another unknown mechanism underlies the requirement for these sites for efficient replication. The presence of miRNA binding sites within many different RNA viruses may suggest a positive selective pressure for retention of these sites within the genome occurring at the cellular or organismal levels, or during virus transmission between hosts, particularly in instances where replication is inhibited at the single cell level. Consequently, miRNA repression of virus replication may exert powerful effects on the composition of RNA virus quasispecies during different phases of virus residency within a host. One potential selective pressure to maintain miRNA-binding sites may result from the tempering of virus replication in certain cells or tissues that enable efficient virus dissemination without severe detrimental effects to the host. However, it is clear that more research is needed to fully understand how the replication-inhibiting miR-142-3p binding sites in EEEV, or specific sites in other viruses can be maintained throughout the virus replication/transmission cycle.\n\nmiRNAs regulate many processes within cells including RNA virus infections. Direct binding of miRNAs to virus genomes that lead to an antiviral effect may be rare due to the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, unless there is a strong selective pressure to maintain the miRNA binding sites within the virus genome. It may be more common that RNA viruses manipulate the levels of particular miRNAs within the cell to establish a proviral environment that enhances virus replication and dissemination within and between hosts. In addition, changes in miRNA levels after virus infection are clearly an important component of the host response to infection, sculpting both the initiation and resolution phases of the antiviral response.\n\nOver the past few years, there has been a large expansion in the number of studies identifying miRNAs as modulating factors during RNA virus infections. Future work (see Outstanding Questions Box, Box 4) will help to define the role of miRNAs during these processes. However, knowledge regarding the role of miRNAs has already been applied to the development of antiviral therapeutics [43] and gene therapy vectors (reviewed in [77] ). In fact, the development of a miRNA therapeutic for Ebola virus was used during the recent outbreak in Africa. However testing was ultimately suspended, as the drug did not demonstrate a significant role in patient recovery [78] . Also, insertion of tissue-specific miRNA binding sites have been used as an effective mechanism to prevent virus replication in particular tissues as an attenuation mechanism for vaccines, helping to limit adverse events [79] . Furthermore, recent evidence suggests the presence of viral-derived small RNAs during infection of both mammalian and arthropod cells [80, 81] . While controversial, their presence and function during animal infections will need to be further examined. Viral interactions with the miRNA system can affect cellular miRNA and transcriptome levels as well as virus replication within a cell expressing a miRNA; these may indirectly modulate cytokine expression and tissue responses throughout an infected host. Consequently, future approaches tackling these questions are likely to emerge from this exciting area of investigation.\n\nBorna Disease Virus non-segmented negative strand RNA virus that can establish persistent infection in human neuronal cells.\n\na member of the Pestivirus genus that is an important pathogen of livestock due to its ability to affect reproduction.\n\nCoronavirus enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus that can infect humans and other animals and cause the common cold and pneumonia in the elderly.

Within the cell nucleus, pri-miRNA is digested enzymatically by the Drosha protein into the pre-miRNA containing a hairpin structure which is exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (Key Figure, Figure 1 ) [83] . Subsequently, the Dicer protein cleaves the terminal loop structure of the hairpin, leaving a small 21-23 nucleotide miRNA duplex. The argonaute protein then associates with one strand of the miRNA duplex to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), mediating translational repression or mRNA destabilization [84, 85] . Each strand in the miRNA duplex can function as a miRNA and be loaded into the RISC complex; however, the strand that is more thermodynamically unstable at the 5' end is incorporated preferentially [86] . For a more detailed review on miRNA processing see [82] .\n\nA seed sequence located at nucleotide positions 2-8 of the 5' end of the miRNA binds complimentary sequences within the 3' non-translated region (NTR) of either a host mRNA or the genome of an invading RNA virus [87] . A single miRNA can possess binding specificity for many different target mRNAs based on the cell type and the pattern of mRNA expression [88] . A perfect match between the miRNA and the entire mRNA target sequences leads to RNA cleavage, albeit rarely in mammals [87] . More commonly, an exact seed match, a canonical miRNA binding site --without complete complementarity in the remainder of the target mRNA--results in translation inhibition and, eventually, RNA destabilization and degradation [84, 85] . Recently, non-canonical binding sites have also been described that have imperfect seed sequence complementarity. As an example, non-canonical miRNA binding sites are thought to comprise up to 40% of the total miR-155 miRNA binding sites in host mRNAs [89] . However, even though non-canonical binding sites may mediate miRNA binding to the mRNA, these sites may not fully suppress mRNA translation [90] . If miRNAs can functionally inhibit RNA viruses through non-canonical interactions, the number of potential miRNA:RNA virus interactions would dramatically increase. Mutational analysis of known miRNA binding sites into non-canonical target sequences will be required to determine whether or not such non-canonical interactions can mediate productive miRNA:RNA virus interactions. \n\nRNA viruses can also encode proteins that inhibit the miRNA processing pathway. These proteins lead to changes in host miRNA and protein levels that modulate innate immune and other cell stress responses, thus causing more rapid and extensive viral replication during acute infections, decreased virus clearance and enhanced immunopathology. Although miRNAs do not appear to have a host-protective direct antiviral role against RNA virus infection in vertebrates [2, 3] , some animal virus proteins have the capacity to suppress the miRNA pathway. The Ebola virus VP35 [91] and VP30 proteins [92] and the HCV core protein [93] interact with Dicer or Dicer-interacting proteins to prevent final processing into miRNAs. The HIV-1 Tat [94] , and influenza NS1 proteins [95] have also been proposed to suppress the RNAi pathway through inhibition of Dicer and binding to double stranded RNA, respectively; however, other reports have failed to support this hypothesis [96, 97] .\n\nIn invertebrates, many viruses encode proteins that inhibit the RNAi machinery at multiple steps, all leading to suppression of the antiviral RNAi pathway and increased virus replication. These steps include preventing the processing of RNAs into siRNAs by Dicer proteins, inhibiting the function of argonaute proteins, and inhibiting the final formation of the RISC complex (reviewed in [98] ). Evidently, further studies will be required to determine the exact role of RNAi-suppressing virus proteins in animal virus pathogenesis. \n\nTissue-specific changes in miRNA expression can also contribute to virus-induced pathology in mice. For instance, JEV and WNV infection of the central nervous system [99] [100] [101] [102] and influenza virus infection of the lung [103, 104] can lead to changes in multiple miRNAs implicated in the regulation of proinflammatory responses. Upregulation of miR-19b and miR-1 by Coxsackie B 3 virus infection was found to downregulate the expression of gap junction proteins --required for cell-to-cell contactin human and mouse cardiomyocytes, leading to the development of viral myocarditis [105, 106] . Another study documented that induction of miR-146a and downregulation of miR-370 following EV71 infection and miR-6124 expression after WNV infection, led to increased cellular apoptosis and cell death through the regulation of apoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins [107, 108] . Obviously, changes in miRNA levels associated with virus infection can contribute to pathological and/or protective responses. However, as with antiviral activities, the role of these effects in the replication and disease process should be considered carefully with respect to the effects on single cells or tissues, the overall pathogenesis of the virus in a given host, as well as host-host transmission mechanisms. \n\nThe Clinician's Corner Box miRNAs play a role in many different processes within a cell by regulating the production of cellular proteins. miRNA regulation of the innate immune response modulates the production of antiviral molecules, by enhancing their response during the initiation of innate immunity, but also by downregulating this response in order to prevent aberrant physiological responses and/or immunopathology in a host.\n\nCell-specific miRNA expression directly contributes to the pathogenesis of medically important viruses by either promoting avoidance of the innate immune response (e.g., eastern equine encephalitis virus) or, by stabilizing the virus genome and enhancing virus replication (e.g., Hepatitis C virus).\n\nOther miRNAs can be regulated via virus infection to establish a pro-or antiviral environment. miRNA expression patterns can be used to identify a virus infection and help to determine whether a virus strain is pathogenic or attenuated.\n\nIn the future, miRNAs might be used as antiviral therapeutics to prevent certain viral infections. Furthermore, the incorporation of tissue-specific miRNAs into viral vaccine and gene therapy vectors might enhance specific targeting of viral proteins and/or hopefully limit adverse reactions from infection. \n\nSome RNA viruses possess miRNA binding sites in a range of locations within the virus genome, including the 5' and 3' non-translated regions.\n\nHost cell miRNAs can bind to RNA virus genomes enhancing genome stability, repressing translation of the virus genome or altering free miRNA levels within the cell. miRNAs contribute to virus pathogenesis by promoting evasion of the host antiviral immune response, enhancing virus replication or, potentially, altering miRNA-mediated host gene regulation.\n\nRNA virus infection can lead to widespread changes in the host transcriptome by modulating cell-specific miRNA levels. miRNAs are transcribed in the nucleus by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) into a pri-miRNA that is cleaved by Drosha resulting in the pre-miRNA. The pre-miRNA is exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm and is enzymatically cleaved by Dicer into the miRNA duplex. One strand of the miRNA duplex is recognized by the argonaute proteins to form the RISC complex. Direct Interaction: After infection, the RNA virus genome is released into the cytoplasm where the miRNA-loaded RISC binds via the miRNA seed sequence to complimentary nucleotides in the viral 5' NTR, 3' NTR, or coding regions. miRNA binding to the 5' NTR leads to RNA stability and increased virus replication. miRNA binding to the 3' NTR can lead to inhibition of viral translation or increased RNA stability and viral translation. Indirect interaction: Viral RNA is recognized by pattern-recognition receptors, toll-like receptors TLR3, TLR7, as well as RIG-I or MDA5, leading to the induction of the IFN signaling cascade and upregulation of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and other ISGs that inhibit virus replication. Virus infection and IFN and ISG induction can also lead to changes in miRNA Trobaugh Primate Foamy virus-1 miR-32 \u2193 virus translation [28] Human T-cell leukemia virus-1 miR-28-3p \u2193 virus translation in T cells, transmission between humans [29] Human immunodeficiency Virus miR-28-5p, miR-150, miR-223, miR-382\n\n\u2193 virus translation \u2191 latency in T cells [30] miR-29a \u2191 association wiith RISC and P bodies \u2193 virus replication [31] Influenza miR-323, miR-491, miR-485, miR-654, miR-3145 \u2193 PB1 RNA levels [12, 33, 34] let-7c \u2193 Matrix protein [35] Enterovirus 71 miR-296-5p \u2193 Virus replication, VP1 and VP3 protein levels [13] miR-23b \u2193 virus translation and replication [32] Infectious bursal disease virus miR-21 \u2193 VP1 protein levels [38] Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus "}
