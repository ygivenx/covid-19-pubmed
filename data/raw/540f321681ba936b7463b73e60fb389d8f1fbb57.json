{"title": "A Simple Mathematical Model for Estimating the Inflection Points of COVID-19 Outbreaks", "body": "In spite of the obviously extreme importance and extensive research efforts, predicting the inflection points, formally known as the tipping points or turning points in much of the existing literature, turned out to be notoriously difficult. The enormous complexity associated with tipping points and critical transitions make accurate predictive modeling nearly impossible.\n\nExisting theories suggest that early warning signals (EWS) may be developed based on the phenomenon that recovery rates from small disturbances should tend to zero when approaching a tipping point (Scheffer et al. 2009 , and some laboratory experiments and field survey have demonstrated the so-called \"critical slow down\" (CSD) phenomenon (e.g., Veraart et al. 2012 .\n\nIn theory, it has been suggested that even without fully mechanistic understanding of the underlying critical transitions, it is still possible to infer generic features or early warning signals (EWS) of approaching a tipping point from time series or spatial pattern data. Theory proposes that at bifurcation points (i.e., tipping points), the stability of an equilibrium changes and the dominant real eigenvalue becomes zero. Consequently, the recovery rate from disturbance should go zero when approaching such bifurcation, or the return time (measure of resilience) should be infinity (Veraart et al. 2012) . In practice, the recovery rate from disturbance may be an indicator of the distance to a tipping point, and its manifestation, the CSD offer important early EWS for approaching a tipping point.\n\nInvestigating the inflection points of infectious disease outbreaks including the ongoing coronaviruses pandemic falls under the domain of tipping points and critical transitions (Veraart et al. 2012 , Scheffer et al. 2009 . However, in a pre-experiment analysis of the existing datasets of COVID-19 infections, we failed to detect any tipping points (inflection points). We conjecture that the failure may have to do with the insufficiently long duration of data collections. We then also tried some simple epidemiological modeling approaches such as simple logistic model (e.g., Ma et al. 2009 ) but still failed to achieve satisfactory results.\n\nInspired by the exponential-like growth of infections leading to peaks, which seems to be a hallmark of many infectious disease outbreaks including COVID-19 and SARS (Rivers et al. 2019 , Li et al. 2020 , Thompson 2020 , Ma 2020 , we try the PLEC (power law with exponential cutoff) model for detecting the inflection points in the time series data of COVID-19. The PLEC model (function) starts with power function increase (near exponential growth usually) and it has an exponential decay term that acts as taper-off parameter to eventually overwhelm the power law behavior at very large value of independent variable. The PLEC model was previously used to describe the classic species-area relationship (SAR) in biogeography (Plotkin et al. 2000 , Ulrich & Buszko 2003 , and later used for extending the classic SAR and STR (species-time relationship) to general diversity-area relationship (DAR) and diversity-time relationship (DTR) (Ma 2018a (Ma , 2018b (Ma , 2019 . Furthermore, Ma (2018a Ma ( , 2018b Ma ( , 2019 derived the formula to estimate the maximal accrual diversity (MAD) in space (area), time, and/or spatiotemporal settings, which may also be used to estimate potential diversity (also known as \"dark\" diversity).\n\nThe potential or dark diversity refers to the biodiversity that take into accounts the contribution of species that are absent locally but potentially present in regional species pool. This situation of potential species migration from regional (metacommunity) to local community is not unlike the COVID-19 infections via dispersal (migration) such as travelers of virus-infected individuals.\n\nWe postulate that the PLEC model can be useful for modeling the infection-time relationship (ITR)-the relationship between the cumulative number of infections and time points (e.g., day 1, 2,\u2026\u2026,N). If the PLEC model successfully fits to the ITR datasets, we further postulate that the maximal accrual diversity or potential diversity and corresponding time point may be translated into an approach for estimating the maximal infection number (I max ) of an outbreak and the corresponding time point (when I max is reached) as estimate of inflection time point (T max ).\n\nTogether the pair of {I max , T max } is defined as the inflection point of a disease outbreak in this study. We further devised schemes to test the performance of the PLEC model in predicting (estimating) the inflection points of COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nA hallmark of coronaviruses outbreaks seems to be exponential or near exponential growth of infections, and the peak time and amplitude or the outbreak inflection points of the virus are of obvious importance both theoretically and practically. We address this problem with a trial-anderror strategy. We first conjectured that simple logistic growth model could be a possible solution since its asymptotic limit (K) might be used to approximate the inflection points (Ma et al. 2009 ). We also tried sophisticated mathematical approaches for detecting tipping points . However, the applications of both logistic growth model and tipping point approaches failed to generate satisfactory results. All rights reserved.

The PLEC model is of the following form:\n\n(1)\n\nThe model was initially used by Plotkin et al (2000) and Ulrich & Buszko (2003) for modeling the classic species-area relationship (SAR). Ma (2018a Ma ( , 2018b Ma ( , 2019 introduced it for more general diversity-area relationship (DAR), diversity-time relationship (DTR) and diversity-timearea (DTAR) relationship. Another extension to the model was the derivation of two parameters by Ma (2018a Ma ( , 2018b Ma ( , 2019 : the maximal accrual diversity and corresponding time or space points. The maximal accrual diversity can be used to estimate the so-termed potential diversity (also known as \"dark\" diversity), which takes into accounts of the species that are absent locally (in local communities) but present regionally (in metacommunities) (Ma 2019 , Li & Ma 2019 ).\n\nIn the present report, we use the PLEC (power law with exponential cutoff) model ( = 0\n\n(2) which leads to:\n\nTheoretically, eqns.\n\n(3) & (4) can be utilized to estimate the maximal infection number (I max ) and\n\ncorresponding inflection time point (T max ) at which I max occurs.\n\nParameter d is of particular interests: exp(dT) in eqn.\n\n(1) is the exponential decay term that acts as taper-off parameter to eventually overwhelm the power law behavior (exponential or near exponential growth) at very large value of T. For eqn.\n\n(1) to achieve maximum of realistic biomedical meaning (T max >0) or (w>0 & d<0) are necessary conditions. All rights reserved.

When d=0, the PLEC defaults to classic power-law model,\n\nor its log-transformed linear model:\n\n\u20ac ln(I) = ln(c) + w ln(T), (6) in which w is the slope of the log-linear model or the derivative of I(T), i.e., the change (growth) rate of infections over time, and c is the initial infection number. Since the taper-off effects of parameter d is usually rather weak before the infection peaks, it is reasonable to consider w as an approximation of the infection growth rate, and c as an approximation of the initial infection number.\n\nA simple method to statistically fit the PLEC model [eqn.\n\n(1)] is to transform it into a log-linear equation as follows:\n\n\u20ac ln(I) = ln(c) + w ln(T) + dT\n\nFor eqn. (7) indirectly. We used nonlinear optimization method, specifically the R function \"nlsLM\" from R package \"minpack.lm\" (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/minpack.lm/versions/1.2-1/topics/nlsLM) (Bates & Watts 1988) . Since only T max >0 (negative time is meaningless to count infections) is a necessary condition for the PLEC model to be biometrically sound, we add a constraint d<0 for the non-linear fitting of PLEC model.\n\nIt is particularly worthy of noticing that the dependent variable (I) of PLEC, almost unavoidably, declines after the inflection point (maximum) due to the taper-off parameter (d). Nevertheless, this should not be an issue in the case of this study, since our purpose is to detect the inflection point (T max ) as well as the corresponding maximum (I max ). In other words, the declining piece of PLEC curve after the inflection point is \"irrelevant\" for our purpose. Of course, this also implies that our model is only applicable to unimodal (single peak) outbreak.\n\nAll rights reserved.

In addition, we collected the datasets of 17 cities of Hubei province of China. The infection data between Jan 19 th and Feb 29 th were collected for building the predictive PLEC model, and the infection data at two time points (March 6 th and 12 th ) as the test data points to evaluate the performance of the PLEC model in determining the inflection points.\n\nThe public websites used to get the data include: https://news.qq.com/zt2020/page/feiyan.htm#/ and https://news.ifeng.com/c/special/7tPlDSzDgVk.\n\nWe test the performance of the proposed PLEC model with two schemes. First, we evaluate the \"congruency\" of T max (inflection time point) with the reality by comparing the actually observed infection number at the date of T max with the estimated I max . To determine the congruence, we calculate an interval [I max \u2212I max x0.05; I max +I max x0.05] for each PLEC model. If the actually observed infection numbers falls within the interval, the estimation of T max is considered as valid.\n\nIt is noted that this is not a classic confidence interval, which requires the calculation of standard deviation of samples and cannot be obtained in the case of COVID-19 infections. Instead, this \"homegrown\" interval we computed is simply a range of I max with 5% fluctuation, which we believe is a reasonable scheme for estimating the validity of the T max estimations.\n\nSecond, to evaluate the validity of I max estimations, we used the observed infection number on the day of T max , March 6 th and March 12 th , respectively, as reference values to evaluate the performance of the PLEC model, using the following formula to calculate the error rate:\n\nAlternatively, the precision P(%) of the PLEC model is simply computed as the complement of E(%), i.e., P(%)=1-E(%).\n\nWe fitted the PLEC model with the nonlinear optimization method (i.e., the R-function 'nlsLM' introduced in the previous \"The Model\" section) to each of the 17 cities in Hubei province, each of the 34 provinces of China, as well as the whole China and worldwide infections datasets. The results were displayed in Table 1 (the PLEC model-fitting results) and Table 2 (test of the model performance). Since the model mostly failed to make meaningful predictions of the infections outside China, we postpone the worldwide results to the \"Discussion\" section and here we focus on the results fitted to the datasets in China.\n\nAll rights reserved.

These p-values measure the significance levels for estimating these parameters: a p-value<0.05 indicating that the goodness-of-fitting to the model is statistically satisfactory from the perspective of the particular parameter. R 2 (R-squared) is of limited reference value for non-linear fitting problem, but it also confirmed the goodness-offitting as illustrated by the p-values for individual parameters. Obviously, the most important items in Table 1 are the I max and corresponding T max , the maximal infection number (eqn. 3) and the corresponding inflection time point (eqn. 4), respectively. Table 1 shows that PLEC fitted to virtually all datasets satisfactorily in terms of the p-values except for a few negligible parameter cases (p-value>0.05 in 4 out of 52). It should be noted that the 4 parameter cases that failed to pass significance tests only means that the parameter values may have too high standard error (variability) and the failure does not necessarily mean that the model structure failed. Therefore, the model could still be used for estimating T max and I max , as long as the tests with actual observations are satisfactory, as explained below. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 In summary, the test results suggest that the proposed PLEC model successfully estimated the inflection points in terms of both {T max & I max }, i.e., the inflection time points and maximal infection numbers, in more than 80% tested cases (ranged between 82%-100%). Note that the date range we used to build PLEC models was between January 19 and February 29 th , rather than the full date range available, and the datasets of the remaining dates were used for evaluating the performance of PLEC models. \n\nIn this section, by analyzing the failures of PLEC case by case, we try to uncover the model's limitations. We first examine the failure exposed in previous Tables 1 & 2.\n\nIn Tables 1 & 2, the PLEC model for Shandong province performed badly with error rates about 11% was apparently due to the sudden discovery of approximately 200 cases in a local prison on a single day (Feb 20), which was approximately 1/5 of the total number in the province. The model for Gansu province also performed badly with error rates of 36%, apparently due to 33 inputs from the overseas between March 4 th and 8 th , approximately 1/3 of the total number in the province. These individual cases suggest that the PLEC modeling can be sensitive to certain disruptive increases, in particular, to the increases that occupy disproportionally large proportion of the total numbers. This may be considered as the first limitation of the PLEC model. On the positive side, excluding the inaccuracies from these disruptive increases as well as the individual cases of Taiwan and Tibet, the PLEC model actually performed exceptionally well, reaching success rates mostly exceeding 95%.\n\nWe also fitted the PLEC model to the infection datasets of at least 14 countries (top 14 in terms of the infection numbers until March 15 th ) as well as the worldwide total infection number, and total worldwide infection number excluding China. Overall, in a majority of the cases, the PLEC All rights reserved.

From those failures, we conjecture that the failures are most likely due to the reality that in most of those countries (regions), the infections are still in the exponential growth stages. This, of course, suggests another possible limitation of the PLEC model, namely, the PLEC model may require a sufficiently long period of data points to successfully reveal the inflection points. Like all mathematical models, PLEC model is no silver bullet. Without seeing a sign of inflection point, it may not be possible for the PLEC model to reveal its existence.\n\nStill a third limitation of the PLEC model is that it may only detect a single inflection point for a dataset. In other words, it is only applicable for detecting the inflection point for unimodal curve, as explained in the material and methods section. In the case of coronaviruses, this may not be an issue given that the SARS outbreak was also unimodal. In case of multiple-peak recurrence or seasonal outbreaks, it should be possible to divide multi-modal curve into multiple unimodal curves. Therefore, this limitation should be much less serious than it appears.\n\nGiven the above-discussed limitations of the PLEC model, we also applied the tipping point detection technique based on Fisher information for determining the inflection points, but failed to detecting any inflection (tipping) points in the datasets of COVID-19 infections. As shown in Table S1 Finally, we would like to mention one potentially very important point regarding the prediction of inflection points, but is beyond the scope of this study, that is, the potentially critical influences of public-health intervention/prevention measures on the occurrences of inflection points. Such a study may only be possible after the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic is over in our opinion. All rights reserved.
