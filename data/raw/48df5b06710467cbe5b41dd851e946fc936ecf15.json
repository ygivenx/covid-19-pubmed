Here we have shown that the expression level of IFITM3 88 is important in determining the control of influenza virus infection. We find an 89 expression pattern for IFITM3 that varies based on cell type, tissue locality, 90 differentiation state and cell naivety, all of which highlights cells that may be at 91 the highest risk of influenza infection. 92\n\nInfluenza virus infection is highly contagious, spreading quickly among 95 individuals in a community, posing one of the greatest infectious threats to 96 modern society. Despite high infection rates, mortality rates remain lower 97 than 1% during non-pandemic years showing that the host immune system 98 can effectively clear viral infection in most cases (WHO figures) . But the very 99 young and very old are vulnerable and at higher risk of hospitalisation and 100 mortality. Studies into host factors that may be important in restriction of this 101 highly pathogenic virus led to the discovery of the interferon (IFN) induced 102 trans-membrane protein 3 (IFITM3) ten years ago. 103\n\nexpression level dependent manner (1) and was integral for the overall 105 clearance of infection in a murine setting (2). The fact that most, if not all, 106 individuals who come into contact with IAV become actively infected suggests 107 that basal expression of IFITM3 in hosts is not sufficient to control IAV in the 108 early stages of an infection. Bringing into question whether this anti-viral host 109 response is an innate factor or induced to help at later stages of an infection. Recently, it has been demonstrated that IFITM3 expression, along with 118 several other IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), is high in stem cells potentially as a 119 protection mechanism against viral infection, with expression then lost with 120 differentiation (4). Online databases of IFITM3 RNA expression show large 121 variability in expression in different organs. The protein atlas database 122 suggests that protein levels of IFITM3 are also variable across cell types, 123 however it is likely that these results came from studies using antibodies that 124\n\nwere cross-reactive with IFITM2 making it impossible to draw firm conclusions 125\n\nIn addition to restriction of IAV, IFITM3 has been shown to restrict an 127 additional sixteen mostly enveloped RNA viruses including human 128 immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), Ebola and Dengue virus (1, 7-10). The 129 tropism of these IFITM3-restricted viruses is highly varied; IAV predominantly 130 epithelial cells of the respiratory system (11), HIV-1 predominantly infects 131 CD4 + T cells (12, 13) and Dengue virus can infect skin epithelial and 132\n\nLangerhans cells (14, 15) .\n\nDifferences in basal IFITM3 expression may 133 contribute to the tropism exhibited by these viruses and others restricted by 134\n\nWe have generated an N-terminal antibody specific to IFITM3 (16) \n\nThe knockout of IFITM3_F01 was generated by a single T base insertion in 174 the first exon using CRISPR/Cas9 in the Kolf2_C1 human iPSC line (a clonal 175 derivative of kolf2 (HipSci)).

On day 5, EBs were used for generation of myeloid 199 precursor cells by plating into 6-well tissue culture treated plates (Corning) To test for reproducibility between CyTOF runs, the same donor was 243 included in each run. 100 mL of heparinized blood was drawn from a healthy 244 control donor, PBMCs were isolated and aliquots were frozen (90% fetal 245 bovine serum+10% dimethyl sulfoxide) and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. 246\n\nWith every CyTOF run 1 vial was thawed for staining and acquisition. 247\n\nDonor cells were re-suspended at 1\u00d710 7 cells/mL and stained with 5 248 mmol/L Cisplatin (Fluidigm; live/dead) and surface antibody cocktail. Cells 249 were permeabilised with Maxpar nuclear antigen staining buffer and stained 250 with intracellular markers and the metal-conjugated secondary to BST2-PE. 251\n\nAn un-permeabilised control without secondary antibody was treated with cell 252 staining buffer and stained with intracellular antibodies. Cells were stained 253 with 125 nM Ir-Intercalator (Fluidigm) according to Fluidigm protocols and 254 fixed with 1.6% formaldehyde. Cells were counted on a BD Accuri C6. Before 255 acquisition on CyTOF Helios cytometer (Fluidigm), cells were re-suspended at 256 2\u00d710 6 cells/mL in 0.1\u00d7EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (Fluidigm).

Cells were 296 plated into 24 well dishes for 24 hours. The level of IFITM3 expression and 297 GFP + percentage of cells was determined for each condition. Data was 298 analysed by linear correlation on GraphPad Prism. 299 300 Results 301\n\nUsing our IFITM3-specific antibody, we investigated the basal expression of 303 IFITM3 on the cell lines HEK293, A549 and the induced pluripotent stem cell 304 (iPSC) line Kolf2. These cell lines were selected as we have CRISPR-edited 305 IFITM3 -/versions of these cells, allowing us to be confident that the level of 306 IFITM3 expression observed is accurate (Figure 1a) . 307\n\nBasal expression of IFITM3 was shown to vary across the three cell 308 lines with no detectable expression in A549 cells and higher expression in 309 iPSC than HEK293 cells (Figure 1b) . Following differentiation of iPSC into 310 macrophages, IFITM3 basal expression was reduced compared to iPSC. 311\n\nThis suggests that IFITM3 expression levels can be altered due to the 312 differentiation state of the cell or cell type. 313 314\n\nTo investigate whether differences in IFITM3 basal expression were present 316 in primary cells from blood and mucosal tissue, we isolated peripheral blood 317 mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy adult volunteers and surgical lung 318 tissue samples isolated from lung cancer patients and measured basal 319 IFITM3 expression on key immune cell subsets. The lung tissue was taken 320 from a para-tumour samples and deemed to show no signs of inflammation by 321 a pathologist. 322\n\nTo determine whether cell origin affects IFITM3 basal expression, cell 323 subsets were grouped according to their lineage (Figure 1c) . For adult blood 324 there was significantly higher basal IFITM3 expression in myeloid cells 325 compared to lymphoid cells (p=0.0235). This higher expression in myeloid 326 cells compared to lymphoid was replicated in lung tissue samples (p<0.0001). 327\n\nThe basal expression of IFITM3 in lung epithelial cells was shown to be highly 328 variable between patients, but still showed significantly higher expression than 329 that of lymphocytes (p=0.0438), and a comparable average expression level 330 to that of myeloid cells. 331\n\nAnalysis of individual immune cell subsets showed that CD16 + 332 monocytes have a considerably higher level of IFITM3 expression than other 333 cell types in adult blood (Figure 1d ). In lung tissue this level was reduced in 334 the CD16 + monocytes to a level that was comparable to CD14 + monocytes 335 and similar to dendritic cell (DC) populations (pDC were not detected in lung 336 samples) (Figure 1d ). CD14 + monocytes had higher expression of IFITM3 in 337 the lung than blood. Natural Killer (NK) cells showed a slightly increased level 338 of IFITM3 expression in the lung compared to that seen in adult blood. This 339\n\nsuggests that there are tissue-specific changes in IFITM3 expression. As previously suggested (4), IFITM3 expression in haematopoietic stem cells 352 (HSC) and progenitors was significantly higher than expression in 353 lymphocytes (p=0.0491) (Figure 1e) . However, no differences were seen in 354 expression levels when comparing myeloid and progenitor cell groups, 355\n\nsuggesting that the IFITM3 expression pattern is more complicated than 356 previously thought. The expression pattern on most immune cell subsets was 357 comparable between adult and cord blood samples, with the highest 358 expression by CD16 + monocytes (Figure 1e) . In general, IFITM3 expression 359 was higher in cord blood samples than comparable populations in adult blood 360 samples suggesting that na\u00efve cells may have higher expression of IFITM3. 361 .

This suggests that while differentiation 364 state is a determinate of basal IFITM3 expression it is not a linear correlation. 365 366\n\nAs an ISG, it is possible that the pattern of IFITM3 expression seen above is 368 standard for all ISGs. To investigate this, we measured expression levels of 369 STAT1 and BST2 in the same samples as above. STAT1 and BST2, in the 370 same way as IFITM3, were previously reported to be expressed highly in stem 371 cells with expression lost following differentiation (4). STAT1 is a transcription 372 factor (20) and thus acted as an intracellular control against IFITM3. BST2, or 373 tetherin, tethers viruses (including IAV) to the cell surface to prevent viral 374 release and increase restriction of enveloped viruses (21). 375\n\nThe expression pattern of both STAT1 and BST2 differed considerably 376 compared to IFITM3 expression, with the highest expression of both STAT1 377 and BST2 in adult blood seen in the pDC population (Figure 3a) . 378\n\nAdditionally, STAT1 was expressed at the lowest level in CD16 + monocytes.

IFITM3 399 expression was measured prior to infection (Figure 4a) However, IFITM3 is not the only anti-viral mechanism induced by IFN 411 stimulation. We therefore investigated the infection rates of IFN-stimulated 412 HEK293-IFITM3 -/cells. As expected, the infection rate was substantially 413 higher in IFITM3 -/cells with no IFN stimulation, but following type I IFN 414 stimulation the infection rate was attenuated to levels comparable to or lower 415 than those seen in un-stimulated HEK293-WT but not as low as in IFN-treated 416 HEK293-WT cells (Figure 4b) . This data suggests that IFITM3 contributed to 417 type I IFN mediated control in cells where IFITM3 was substantially 418 upregulated upon IFN stimulation. 419 420 To investigate the association between IFITM3 expression levels and 421 infection rates, we re-introduced IFITM3 into HEK293-IFITM3 -/cells using 422 plasmid transfection at different concentrations prior to infection with S-FLU 423 PR8:H1N1 (Figure 4c) . As the percentage of IFITM3+ cells increased, the 424 level of GFP+ (i.e. cells with replicating virus) was reduced. In fact, when we 425 looked at the correlation between IFITM3+ and GFP+ cells we saw a 426 significant inverse correlation between these levels (R 2 =0.4730, p=0.0046) 427 .

As shown above, type I IFN 434\n\ninduced the highest expression of IFITM3. In HEK293 cells, IFN-l induced a 435 modest increase in IFITM3 but IFN-g had a minimal effect even at very high 436 concentrations. While in A549 cells IFN-l and IFN-g induced similar levels of 437 IFITM3, but this was still attenuated compared to IFN-a and IFN-b. Induction 438 in both cell types starts to plateau at concentrations of IFN >1000 U/ml. 439\n\nPrevious reports have shown that IFITM3 can be induced by type II IFN 440\n\n(2), but we have seen minimal induction of IFITM3. To confirm that our 441 recombinant IFN-g was functional we measured PDL1 expression in our A549 442 cells following stimulation and saw a marked increase in expression (data not 443 shown), suggesting that the lack of induction of IFITM3 is not due to 444 dysfunctional IFN-g stimulation. 445\n\nTo confirm this pattern of IFITM3 induction in our primary cells, we 446 stimulated human adult blood cells with Type I, II and III IFN for 48 hours prior 447 to measurement of IFITM3 expression by mass cytometry. Initially, we looked 448 at the level of IFITM3 induction in the total PBMC population and found that, (Figure 5d) . 456\n\nSuggesting that IFN stimulation cannot increase lymphoid cell expression to a 457 similar level as that seen in myeloid cells. 458\n\nSeparating this into individual cell types and comparing the fold change 459 in IFITM3 expression as compared to unstimulated samples, we found that 460 .

NK and B 462 cells also increased expression of IFITM3 modestly following type I IFN 463\n\nstimulation. CD16 + monocytes show a very small increase in expression 464\n\nfollowing IFN stimulation suggesting that their basal expression is near 465 maximum. Minimal induction of IFITM3 was seen in T cells following type I 466\n\nAs seen in the cell lines, only moderate increases in IFITM3 expression 468 were observed in the CD14 + monocyte and CD1c + DC populations following 469 type II IFN stimulation (IFN-\u03b3) (Figure 5e ). Type III IFN (IFN-\u03bb3), was found 470 to induce IFITM3 expression considerably in pDC cells only as no other 471 immune cell is known to express the receptor for this IFN. It has previously 472 been reported that pDC can secrete IFN-\u03bb and respond to the cytokine in an 473 autocrine manner to increase anti-viral responses (22). Here we show that 474\n\nType I IFN but minimal induction is seen following IFN-g stimulation. 476\n\nAdditionally, T cells do not increase IFITM3 expression following any IFN 477 stimulation. 478 479\n\nLow basal expression of IFITM3 may make some immune cells more at risk of 481 viral infection than others. From the lung samples above we showed that 482 lung-resident macrophages and epithelial cells have low basal expression of 483 IFITM3 that may make them more susceptible to IAV infection in the early 484 stages of infection. Rapid induction of higher IFITM3 expression following 485 infection is likely to be required for complete viral control. 486\n\nTo investigate the time required for IFITM3 induction following IFN 487 stimulation, we measured IFITM3 expression across 72 hours following IFN 488 stimulation (Figure 6) . In both HEK293 (Figure 6a ) and A549 (Figure 6b We found large variability in the basal expression of IFITM3 on different 507 cell types, with higher expression consistently on myeloid cells compared to 508 lymphoid. Minimal variability in this pattern is apparent with strong clustering 509 between expression levels in multiple donors, suggesting that the pattern 510 seen here is robust and reproducible. This combined with the data from the 511 iPSC cells naturally and following differentiation into macrophages, strongly 512 suggests that the cell type and lineage alters basal IFITM3 levels. 513\n\nIn general, IFITM3 expression in lung tissue samples was higher than 514 the corresponding populations in adult blood which would suggest that there 515 may be some evidence of inflammation in these para-tumour samples. 516\n\nHowever, the reduction in expression of the CD16 + monocytes in lung tissue 517 compared to blood suggests that this cannot be the case as this population 518 would either remain high or be increased. This suggests that the tissue 519 locality of the cells can also influence basal IFITM3 expression levels. 520\n\nThe expression pattern of IFITM3 on the cord blood cells and 521 progenitor populations suggest that differentiation state influences IFITM3 522 expression. However, this is not a linear correlation with some mature 523 populations expressing the same level as HSC or progenitor populations. 524\n\nAdditionally, we saw higher expression of IFITM3 on cells isolated from cord 525 blood compared to adult blood, especially in the myeloid compartment. This 526\n\nsuggests that more na\u00efve cells may have higher basal levels of IFITM3 and 527 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

This is in contrast to reports that CD8+ T 528 cells in mice can retain IFITM3 expression following influenza infection (3). 529\n\nThis could be important for the clearance of viral infection as it shows that 530 prior infection does not increase the efficacy of IFITM3 viral restriction during 531 subsequent infections. 532\n\nWe consistently saw very low basal expression of IFITM3 on 533 lymphocytes, in particular T cells, which could not be increased by stimulation 534\n\nwith IFNs. This implies that IFITM3 may not play a major role in restricting 535 virus replication in T cells. This is supported by data showing that CD8 T cell 536 depletion has no effect on weight loss or viral load following IAV infection of 537\n\nWT or Ifitm3 -/mice (unpublished observations by Prof. Ian Humphreys). 538\n\nAlternatively, it may be that other mechanisms can induce IFITM3 expression 539 in T cells, such as T cell activation through CD3/CD28 (23). Low IFITM3 540 expression in T cells could potentially explain why CD4 T cells become 541 chronically infected by HIV-1 despite evidence that IFITM3 can restrict HIV-1 542 (9, 24). Additionally, our data may explain why depletion of IFITM3 in CD4 T 543 cells had no effect on HIV-1 infection rates in previous experiments (1). 544\n\nWe found that IFITM3 is preferentially induced by type I IFN. Here we 545\n\nshow that type III IFN can also induce high IFITM3 expression in certain cell 546 types, although to a lesser extent than after type I IFN treatment. We were 547 unable to show that IFITM3 expression can be significantly induced by type II 548 IFN and only saw modest increases in expression following stimulation. 549\n\nPrevious studies into IFITM3 induction that contradict this data were 550 performed in a murine setting suggesting that there could be species-specific 551 differences in type II-IFN induction of IFITM3 (2). 552\n\nThe requirement for high IFITM3 expression for stronger viral 553 resistance in influenza infection was previously known (1) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.20.885590 doi: bioRxiv preprint cannot induce IFITM3 after IFN stimulation and are the target cells of HIV-1 562 infection, which is generally a chronic infection. 563\n\nAnother important factor is the time it takes for IFITM3 to be induced 564 following IFN stimulation. We found that in cell lines it takes around 36 hours 565 to reach maximal IFITM3 expression, a relatively slow rate for an ISG which 566 are usually induced rapidly within 12 hours. This is in agreement with a paper 567 recently published showing that ISGs can be grouped into four groups, those 568 that are induced within 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours or take 24 hours. IFITM3 569 was within the 24 hour group, at which point the experiment was stopped (25). 570\n\nThis delay in IFITM3 expression following IFN induction further increases the 571 risk of infection in cells with low IFITM3 basal expression, even if they can 572 then induce IFITM3 following IFN stimulation. This suggests that, in some 573 cases, IFITM3 is not a first line of defence against viral infection. 574\n\nOther than viral restriction, IFITM3 has additional roles in cytokine 575 production. It has been shown to restrict cytokine production in murine 576 cytomegalovirus infection to prevent overt pathology caused by infection (26). 577\n\nIn this setting, IFITM3 was most apparent in reducing IL-6 release from 578 myeloid cells. The data shown here supports the strong effect of IFITM3 in 579 myeloid cells and will help to continue the studies into the role of IFITM3 in 580 this setting. 581\n\nTaken together, the data presented here shows that the IFITM3 582 expression pattern is influenced by cell type, location, differentiation state and 583 naivety with high variability possible. However, what is clear is that basal 584 IFITM3 expression is higher on myeloid than lymphoid cells and induction 585 mostly occurs in these cells following IFN stimulation, although this induction 586 can take up to 24 hours for marked increase in expression. The data here will 587 provide important information for the study of IFITM3 viral restriction in several 588 infection settings as well as aiding in research of the role of IFITM3 in cancer 589 and cytokine production.
