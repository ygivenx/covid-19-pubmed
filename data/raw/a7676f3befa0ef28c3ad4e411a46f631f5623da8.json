As part of these social distancing policies, the Chinese Government encouraged people to stay at home; discouraged mass gatherings; cancelled or postponed large public events; and closed schools, universities, government offices, libraries, museums, and factories. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Only limited segments of urban public transport systems remained operational and all crossprovince bus routes were taken out of service. As a result of these policies and public information and education campaigns, Chinese citizens started to take measures to protect themselves against COVID19, such as staying at home as far as possible, limiting social contacts, and wearing protective masks when they needed to move in public.\n\nSocial distancing has been effective in past disease epidemics, curbing humantohuman transmission and reducing morbidity and mortality. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] A single social distancing policy can cut epidemic spread, but usually multiple such policies-including more restrictive mea sures such as isolation and quarantine-are implemented in combination to boost effectiveness. For example, during the 1918-19 influenza pandemic, the New York City Department of Health enforced several social distancing policies at the same time, including staggered business hours, compulsory isolation, and quarantine, which likely led to New York City suffering the lowest death rate from influenza on the eastern seaboard of the USA. 17 During the current outbreak of COVID19, government officials and researchers were concerned that the mass movement of people at the end of the Lunar New Year holiday on Jan 31, 2020, would exacerbate the spread of COVID19 across China. Moreover, individuals typically return from their Lunar New Year holiday after only 1 week, which is shorter than the longest suspected incubation period of the disease. 18 Many of the 5 million people who left Wuhan before the travel ban was put into place 3 could still have been latently infected when their holiday ended. This situation, together with the resumed travel activities, would make it difficult to contain the outbreak.\n\nFacing these concerns, the Chinese Government ex tended the Lunar New Year holiday. The holiday end date was changed to March 10 for Hubei province 19 and Feb 9 for many other provinces, so that the duration of the holiday would be sufficiently long to fully cover the suspected incubation period of COVID19. [20] [21] [22] In addition, people diagnosed with COVID19 were isolated in hospitals. In Wuhan, where the largest number of infected people live, those with mild and asymptomatic infection were also quarantined in socalled shelter or \"Fang Cang\" hospitals, which are public spaces such as stadiums and conference centres that have been repurposed for medical care. Finally, the Chinese Government encouraged and supported grassroots activities for routine screening, contact tracing, and early detection and medical care of COVID19 patients, and it promoted hand washing, surface disinfection, and the use of protective masks through social marketing and media. As a result of the extended holiday and the additional measures, many people with asymptomatic infection from Hubei province who had travelled to other provinces remained in their homes until they developed symptoms, at which point they received treatment. It is this homebased quarantine of people who had been to the epicentre of the epidemic and travelled to other locations in China that is likely to have been especially helpful in curbing the spread of the virus to the wider community.\n\nThere are several lessons that can be drawn from China's extension of the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nFirst, countries facing potential spread of COVID19, or a similar outbreak in the future, should consider outbreak control \"holidays\" or closure periods-ie, periods of recommended or mandatory closure of nonessential workplaces and public insti tutions-as a firstline social distancing measure to slow the rate of transmission. Second, governments should tailor the design of such outbreakcontrol closure periods to the specific epidemic characteristics of the novel disease, such as the incubation period and transmission routes. Third, a central goal of an outbreakcontrol closure period is to prevent people with asymptomatic infections from spreading the disease. As such, governments should use the closure period for information and education campaigns, community screening, active contact tracing, and isolation and quarantine to maximise impact. Such a combination approach is also supported by studies of responses to previous outbreaks, which showed that reductions in the cumulative attack rate were more pronounced when social distancing policies were combined with other epidemic control measures to block transmission. 23 As for COVID19 in China, this combination of an outbreakcontrol closure period for social distancing and a range of accompanying epidemic control measures seems to have prevented new infections, especially in provinces other than Hubei, where new infections have been declining for more than 2 weeks. 1 As fearsome and consequential as the COVID19 outbreak has been, China's vigorous, multifaceted response is likely to have prevented a far worse situation. Future empirical research will establish the full impact of the social distancing and epidemic control policies during the extended Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. As travel and work slowly resume in China, the country should consider at least partial continuation of these policies to ensure that the COVID19 outbreak is sustainably controlled.\n\nWe declare no competing interests. Three Lancet Series on early childhood development in 2007, 1,2 2011, 3,4 and 2017 5-7 brought together a century of developmental science. These Series increased our understanding of how human development unfolds, why early childhood development is so important for health and wellbeing across the life course and into the next generation, and how the health sector can step up and lead efforts to give the youngest children everywhere a better chance to reach their individual potential. Nurturing care from parents and familiesand supported by their communities, state services, national policies, and international conventionsprovides the optimal environment for early childhood development. Throughout our lives, health and well being are strongly determined by relationships, among the most important of which are those into which we are born.\n\nThe promotion and protection of young children's development by strengthening caregiver-child relation ships have a long, although intermittent, history in WHO. The third session of the UN in 1948 proposed a study of the needs of children after the widespread social dislocation caused by World War 2. WHO convened four meetings of the world's leading scholars in human and social behaviour, who concluded that parentchild relationships were the driving force of human development and provided fundamental protection for children, even during the devastation of war. Their recommendations, and those of others, were that young children should not be separated from their parents, and Guidance for the health sector to partner with parents and families for early childhood development"}
