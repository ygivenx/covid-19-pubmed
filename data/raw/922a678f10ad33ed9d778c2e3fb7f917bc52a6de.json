{"title": "HEALTHCARE-ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS IN THE NURSERY Special Issues for", "body": "Neonates, especially premature neonates who require intensive medical care, are among the patients at highest risk for nosocomial or health care-associated infections (HAIs). Although the rate of HAIs varies with the specific patient population and institution, some series have reported that more than 20% of critically ill neonates who survive more than 48 hours acquire a nosocomial infection [1] [2] [3] . Neonatal HAIs are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and excessive direct health care costs [3] . Prevention of these infections should be a major priority in all neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and nurseries. The most important risk factors for HAIs in neonates, gestational age and birth weight, cannot be modified. Close attention to clinical practice and the patient care environment is mandatory to minimize the risk of infections. This chapter reviews the epidemiology, microbiology, pathogenesis, and prevention of neonatal HAIs.\n\nThe innate and adaptive arms of the neonatal immune system are functionally less mature than that of older infants, children, and adults (see Chapter 4) . Compared with term infants, preterm infants have less developed specific components of the innate immune system, particularly factors that maintain physiologic barriers. Immature and easily damaged skin is a major factor in the relative immunocompromised state of preterm infants. Iatrogenic breeches in skin integrity, such as those caused by percutaneous medical devices and surgical wounds, also constitute a significant risk.\n\nAlthough the cellular precursors of the human immune system are present around the beginning of the second trimester, T cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and the complement pathways are functionally impaired at this time. Neonatal neutrophils show decreased chemotaxis, diminished adherence to the endothelium, and impaired phagocytosis (see Chapter 4) [4, 5] ; neonatal complement levels and opsonic capacity also are reduced, particularly in premature neonates. In addition, immature T-cell function results in diminished production of cytokines, T-cell killing of virally infected cells, and B-cell differentiation and maturation.\n\nPassively acquired maternal IgG is the sole source of neonatal IgG. Because transplacental transfer of maternal IgG occurs primarily in the third trimester, the serum IgG levels of many preterm neonates are very low. Soon after birth, maternal IgG levels begin to decline, and neonatal production of antigen-specific immunoglobulins begins. Serum IgG concentrations reach about 60% of adult levels by 1 year of age in term neonates [6] . Given the incomplete transfer of maternal IgG and an impaired ability to produce antigen-specific immunoglobulins, premature infants typically have significantly lower levels of serum IgG than their term counterparts, a difference that can persist throughout the 1st year of life. Developmental issues of other organ systems can also affect the risk of HAIs. The immature gastrointestinal tract, characterized by reduced acidification of gastric contents and the fragile integrity of the intestinal epithelium, provides another potential portal of entry for pathogens.\n\nColonization resistance, the incomplete passive protection associated with colonization of skin and mucous membranes with \"normal flora,\" also provides protection from invasive infections caused by pathogenic or commensal bacteria. The in utero environment is sterile; however, colonization begins within the first few days of life. The acquisition of normal colonizing flora is disrupted in hospitalized newborns for various reasons, including the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the hospital environment and on the hands of health care workers, the frequent use of antimicrobial agents, and exposure to invasive procedures. As a result, the microflora of infants in the NICU can be markedly different from healthy term infants [7, 8] . Multidrug-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter species colonize the skin and the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of a high proportion of NICU neonates by the 2nd week of hospitalization [9] [10] [11] [12] . In addition, hospitalized neonates can become colonized with Candida and other yeasts [13] [14] [15] [16] .\n\nThe incidence of HAIs varies markedly by birth weight, gestational age, underlying conditions, and exposure to medical devices [17] . Reported rates of specific infections in similar patient populations differ dramatically by institution. In the past, much of this variation likely arose from differences in patient populations and clinical practices. The patient safety movement has resulted in marked reductions in the rates of many specific HAIs in numerous NICU settings, however. The risk of HAIs previously reported is likely greater than that currently experienced by many neonatal patients.\n\nIn 1999, a nationwide multicenter surveillance study, the Pediatric Prevention Network (PPN) Point Prevalence Survey, was undertaken to determine the point prevalence of and to define risk factors associated with nosocomial infections in NICU patients [18] . This study included 827 infants from 29 NICUs. Of the 827 infants, 94 (11.4%) had an active nosocomial infection on the day of the survey. Bacteremia accounted for 53% of infections. Lower respiratory tract infections; ear, nose, or throat infections; and urinary tract infections accounted for 13%, 9%, and 9% (Table 35-1) .\n\nIn contrast to the NICU setting, the frequency of nosocomial infection in well-infant nurseries has been estimated to be 0.3% to 1.7% [19] [20] [21] . Generally, non-life-threatening infections such as conjunctivitis account for most infections in the well-infant population. The remainder of this chapter focuses almost entirely on nosocomial infections in NICUs.\n\nDifferentiating maternally acquired and hospital-acquired infections can be difficult. Surveillance definitions typically describe nosocomial infections as infections that arise 2 or more days after initial admission to a nursery or NICU. No precise time point or definition perfectly discriminates infections that clinically were likely attributable to vertical transmission from infections transmitted within the NICU. Approximately 90% of hospitalized neonates with an infection presumed to be of maternal origin had onset of symptoms within 48 hours of birth. Maternally acquired bloodstream infections were more likely to be caused by group B streptococci, other streptococci, and Escherichia coli and were rarely caused by CoNS [22] .\n\nNonmaternal routes of transmission generally can be divided into three categories: contact (from either direct or indirect contact from an infected person or a contaminated source), droplet (from large respiratory droplets that fall out of the air at a maximum distance of 3 feet), and airborne (from droplet nuclei, which can remain suspended in air for long periods and as a result travel longer distances). Specific microorganisms can be spread by more than one mechanism; in most instances, a single mode of spread predominates, however. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a system of precautions to prevent the spread of HAIs that is based on these modes of transmission [23] .\n\nMost neonatal HAIs are caused by the infant's own flora. The \"abnormal flora\" of the neonate residing in the NICU is determined at least in part, however, by the NICU environment and the hands of health care workers. Contact transmission of bacteria, viruses, and fungi on the hands of health care workers is arguably the most important, yet seemingly preventable mechanism by which potentially pathogenic organisms are spread. Poor compliance with hand hygiene has been repeatedly shown as a cause of outbreaks and transmission of resistant microorganisms [24] [25] [26] [27] . With use of molecular techniques, even organisms typically considered to originate solely from normal flora (e.g., CoNS) have been shown to have clonal spread in the hospital setting, suggesting contact transmission by means of the hands of health care workers [28, 29] . Transmission via contaminated inanimate objects also occurs and has been described as a potential mechanism of spread of pathogens in multiple NICU outbreaks [27, 30, 31] . Implicated items have included linens, medical devices, soap dispensers, and breast pumps. These observations highlight the need for careful attention to disinfecting items shared among infants.\n\nSpread of infection through large respiratory droplets is an important mode of transmission for pertussis and certain respiratory viruses. The early identification and appropriate use of precautions for suspected cases are particularly important for nurseries that admit infants from the community. In addition, an ill adult, either a health care worker or a parent, can be the source of these infections in the NICU. Measles, varicella, and pulmonary tuberculosis are usually spread via the airborne route by means of droplet nuclei, but are not typical risks in a nursery or NICU.\n\nOther sources of HAIs include contaminated infusions, medications, and feeding powders or solutions, which can be either intrinsically or extrinsically contaminated and have been reported as the source of outbreaks caused by a variety of different pathogens. It is important when possible to mix infusions in a controlled environment (usually the pharmacy), to avoid multiuse sources of medication, and to use bottled or sterilized feeding solutions when breast milk is unavailable.\n\nAs discussed earlier, infants in NICUs have intrinsic factors that predispose them to infection, such as an immature immune system and compromised skin or mucous membranes. In addition, multiple extrinsic factors play important roles in the development of infection, such as presence of indwelling catheters; performance of invasive procedures; and administration of certain medications, such as steroids and antimicrobial agents.\n\nAlthough the relationship between birth weight and HAIs is likely confounded by multiple other unmeasured factors, such as immune system immaturity, birth weight remains one of the strongest risk factors for HAIs. Data from the CDC show an inverse association between birth weight and the risk of developing either bloodstream infections or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), even after adjusting for central venous catheter (CVC) and ventilator use [22] . Similarly, in the PPN Point Prevalence Survey, infants weighing 1500 g or less at birth were 2.69 (95% confidence interval 1.75 to 4.14; P < .001) times more likely to have an infection than infants weighing more than 1500 g [18] .\n\nSeverity of illness scores have been developed to derive risk-adjusted rates of morbidity and mortality in NICU patients. Stratification by birth weight is the most common strategy used to risk-adjust NICU infection data. Other scores used by some institutions include the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP) [32] and the Clinical Risk Index for Babies (CRIB) [33] . Risk adjustment using these scores can provide more accurate predictions of neonatal mortality and nosocomial infections, although they are not universally used, even within narrow birth weight strata.\n\nThe presence of indwelling intravascular or transmucosal medical devices has been identified repeatedly as one of the greatest risk factors for HAIs in neonates. Importantly, these associations persist after adjustment for birth weight [18] . The epidemiology of HAIs related to medical devices is discussed in more detail later.\n\nNumerous medications and other therapeutic agents crucial to the survival of infants in the NICU increase risk of infection. The widespread use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents has been associated with increased colonization with resistant organisms in many settings, including NICUs [8, 17] . In addition to increasing colonization, use of antimicrobial agents increases the risk of invasive infection with resistant bacteria [34] and with fungal pathogens [35] . Other medications can also be associated with the development of HAIs. Infants who receive corticosteroids after delivery are at approximately 1.3 to 1.6 times higher risk for nosocomial bacteremia in the subsequent 2 to 6 weeks than infants who do not receive this intervention [36, 37] . In addition, colonization and infection with bacterial and fungal pathogens have been shown to increase with the use of H 2 blockers [13, 38] .\n\nParenteral alimentation and intravenous fat emulsion have been shown in some studies to increase risk of bloodstream infection in premature infants even after adjustment for other covariables, such as birth weight and CVC use; the pathogenesis of this possible association remains unclear [39, 40] . Investigators have suggested that fat emulsions could have a direct effect on the immune system [41] . Alternatively, as with any intravenous fluids, parenteral alimentation has the potential for intrinsic and extrinsic contamination, and fat emulsion especially may serve as a growth medium for certain bacteria and fungi. Finally, total parenteral alimentation and intravenous administration of fats likely delay the normal development of gastrointestinal mucosa because of lack of enteral feeding, encouraging translocation of pathogens across the gastrointestinal mucosa. Other risk factors related to infection include poor hand hygiene and environmental issues, such as understaffing and overcrowding [42] [43] [44] .\n\nThe microbiology of neonatal HAIs is diverse (Table 35 -2). Detailed discussions of the microbiology of sepsis and meningitis and of specific organisms can be found in other chapters.\n\nSince the early 1980s, CoNS have been the most common cause of HAIs in the NICU [43] . National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) and PPN surveillance data estimate that 32% of total pathogens and 48% to 51% of bloodstream infections are caused by these organisms [18, 22] . Although an infrequent cause of fatal infection, bacteremia caused by CoNS has been associated with prolonged NICU stay and increased hospital charges, even after adjustment for birth weight and severity of illness on admission [45] . A 10-year, prospective, multicenter Australian study found that 57% of all lateonset infections during the study period were due to CoNS. Molecular techniques suggest that infections caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis can result from clonal dissemination and that there is often concordance between the strains infecting infants and strains carried on the hands of health care workers [28, 46, 47] . In one study, four clones accounted for 43 of 81 study strains (53%) [28] . This finding suggests that a significant proportion of CoNS infections may be preventable by strict adherence to infection control practices. The fact that a hand hygiene campaign was associated with increased hand hygiene compliance and a lower rate of CoNSpositive cultures further supports this contention [48] .\n\nEnterococcus accounts for approximately 10% of all neonatal HAIs, 6% to 15% of bloodstream infections, 0% to 5% of cases of pneumonia, 17% of urinary tract infections, and 9% of surgical site infections [18, 22] . Sepsis and meningitis are common manifestations of enterococcal infection during NICU outbreaks [48] [49] [50] .\n\nThe presence of a nonumbilical CVC, prolonged presence of a CVC, and bowel resection all have been identified as independent risk factors for enterococcal infections in NICU patients [50] . Because Enterococcus colonizes the gastrointestinal tract and can survive for long periods on inanimate surfaces, the patient's environment may become contaminated and, along with the infant, serve as a reservoir for ongoing spread of the organism.\n\nHistorically, before the recognized importance of hand hygiene and the availability of antimicrobial agents, group A streptococci were a major cause of puerperal sepsis and fatal neonatal sepsis. Although less common now, group A streptococci remain a cause of outbreaks in nurseries and NICUs [51] [52] [53] [54] . Group A streptococci-associated clinical manifestations include severe sepsis and soft tissue infections. Molecular techniques have enhanced the ability to define outbreaks, and use of these techniques has suggested that transmission can occur between mother and infant, between health care worker and infant, and between infants-probably indirectly on the hands of health care workers [52, 53] . In one recurring outbreak, inadequate laundry practices seemed to be a contributing factor [55] .\n\nData from the CDC have shown that group B streptococci infections account for less than 2% of nonmaternally acquired nosocomial bloodstream and pneumonia infections [22] . Numerous studies from the 1970s and 1980s showed nosocomial colonization of infants born to women negative for group B streptococci [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . These studies suggested a rate of transmission to infants born to seronegative mothers of 12% to 27% [57, 58] . A case-control study evaluating risk factors for late-onset infection caused by group B streptococci showed that premature birth was a strong predictor [61] . In that study, 50% of the infants with late-onset infection caused by group B streptococci were born at less than 37 weeks of gestation (compared with 15% of controls), and only 38% of the mothers of these infants were colonized with group B streptococci, suggesting possible nosocomial transmission of group B streptococci during the NICU stay.\n\nOrganisms from the Enterobacteriaceae family have long been recognized as an important cause of HAIs, including sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and soft tissue infections; morbidity and mortality rates frequently are high [62] . Enterobacter species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, and Serratia marcescens are the members of Enterobacteriaceae most commonly encountered in the NICU. Many outbreaks owing to gram-negative bacteria have been reported. Underlying causes of these outbreaks include contaminated equipment [63] [64] [65] [66] , formula or breast milk [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] , and intravenous fluids [72] [73] [74] ; understaffing; overcrowding; and poor hand hygiene practices [75] [76] [77] [78] .\n\nThe origins of these organisms are often unclear, although many authors hypothesize that at least some episodes of gram-negative bacteremia are a consequence of intestinal translocation. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that enteric feedings have been associated with a reduced risk of gram-negative infections [79] . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that can persist in relatively harsh environments, frequently has been associated with HAIs and outbreaks in NICUs. Nosocomial P. aeruginosa infections vary in their clinical presentation, but the most common manifestations are respiratory; ear, nose, or throat; and bloodstream infections [18] . P. aeruginosa infections, particularly bloodstream infections, have been associated with a very high mortality rate [80] . Risk factors for infection include feeding intolerance, prolonged parenteral alimentation, and long-term intravenous antimicrobial therapy [80] . Outbreaks owing to P. aeruginosa have been linked to contaminated hand lotion [81] , respiratory therapy solution [82] , a water bath used to thaw fresh frozen plasma [83] , a blood gas analyzer [84] , and bathing equipment [85] . Health care workers and their contaminated hands also have been linked with Pseudomonas infections in the NICU. In a study of a New York outbreak, recovery of Pseudomonas species from the hands of health care workers was associated with older age and history of use of artificial nails [86] . This and other studies suggest that the risk of transmission of Pseudomonas to patients is higher among health care workers with onychomycosis or who wear long artificial or long natural nails [86, 87] . As a result of these and other findings, the CDC revised its 2002 hand hygiene recommendations to include a recommendation against the presence of health care workers with artificial fingernails in intensive care units [88] .\n\nStaphylococcus aureus has frequently been identified as a cause of nosocomial infection and outbreaks in wellinfant nurseries and NICUs. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has become a serious nosocomial pathogen, and outbreaks have been reported in many areas of hospitals, including nurseries [89] [90] [91] . With the emergence of community strains of MRSA, nosocomial transmission of MRSA with the molecular phenotype of either community-associated or hospital-associated strains has been shown [92, 93] . In addition to the usual manifestations of neonatal nosocomial infection, S. aureus HAIs (caused by methicillin-sensitive strains or MRSA strains) can manifest as skin infections [94] , bone and joint infections [95] , parotitis [96] , staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome [97, 98] , toxic shock syndrome [89] , and disseminated sepsis.\n\nDirect contact is the presumed mechanism of most instances of S. aureus transmission. Several distinct reservoirs of MRSA have been identified and associated with MRSA outbreaks, including parents, visitors, and health care workers [90, 97, 99, 100] . Understaffing and overcrowding have been associated with S. aureus outbreaks in NICUs [90, 101] . The potential for airborne transmission has been suggested by \"cloud babies,\" described by Eichenwald and colleagues [102] , in which the respiratory secretions or desquamated skin from a colonized infant carry S. aureus over relatively long distances. \"Cloud\" health care workers also have been described; in such cases, the point source of an outbreak was determined to be a colonized health care worker with a viral respiratory infection [94, 103] . Parents can also transmit MRSA to their newborn infants on passage through a colonized birth canal or postpartum handling [104, 105] .\n\nThe emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is a concern in all hospital settings, and several VRE outbreaks have been reported in NICUs [106, 107] . In neonates, VRE seem to cause clinical syndromes indistinguishable from syndromes caused by susceptible enterococci [50] . Vancomycin use, which is especially prevalent in the NICU, has increased markedly and has probably contributed to the growing prevalence of resistant gram-positive organisms in neonatal patients [108] . More recent observations suggest that clinical infections caused by VRE may signal the presence of a larger reservoir of VRE among asymptomatic colonized infants, and some authors have suggested that active surveillance may be required to interrupt ongoing transmission [109, 110] .\n\nOver the past decade, the array and prevalence of resistant gram-negative organisms have rapidly expanded. Extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) are plasmidmediated resistance factors produced by members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. ESBLs inactivate thirdgeneration cephalosporins and aztreonam. K. pneumoniae and E. coli are the organisms most commonly recognized as ESBL-producing organisms, but other ESBL-producing gram-negative bacilli are being increasingly identified. NICU outbreaks caused by other ESBL-producing organisms have been identified; transfer of ESBLcarrying plasmids to other Enterobacteriaceae organisms has been shown in several NICU outbreaks [111, 112] . Two mechanisms of acquisition of resistant gramnegative organisms have been shown through molecular epidemiologic investigations: patient-to-patient transfer (presumably via contaminated health care worker hands or medical equipment) and de novo emergence as a consequence of antibiotic exposure [113, 114] .\n\nCandida species are the third most common pathogen identified in patients with late-onset sepsis and are associated with morbidity and mortality rates similar to those observed with sepsis from gram-negative bacteria [115] . More recent reports have also linked neonatal candidiasis to increased neurodevelopmental impairment in infancy [116] and retinopathy of prematurity [117] and have quantified the cost of an episode of candidemia in the NICU to be $28,000 to $39,000 [118, 119] .\n\nFridkin and colleagues [120] reported on data from the NNIS network, including 128 NICUs covering 130,523 patients over a 10-year period ending in 2004. Of 1997 cases of candidemia in these patients, 57.9% were Candida albicans, 33.7% were Candida parapsilosis, 3.8% were Candida tropicalis, 2% were Candida glabrata, and 0.2% were Candida krusei. Over time, there was an overall decrease in candidemia in neonates weighing less than 1000 g, but no change in the distribution of Candida species. The combined mortality rate for neonates with candidemia was 13%, which did not significantly differ among infecting species. There was variability, however, with respect to the incidence of candidemia in different NICUs, ranging from 2.4% to 20.4%.\n\nA retrospective cohort study of neonatal candidiasis using the 2003 Kids Inpatient Database reported the incidence of candidiasis at 15 per 10,000 NICU admissions [119] . Two thirds of the cases occurred in neonates with a birth weight of less than 1000 g. Of these patients, neonates with extremely low birth weight were twice as likely to die as propensity-matched neonates with extremely low birth weight without candidiasis. The overall mortality attributable to candidiasis in neonates with extremely low birth weight was 11.9%.\n\nMany risk factors have been associated with neonatal candidemia. Colonization likely precedes infection, and this can occur either vertically (via the maternal genitourinary tract) or horizontally (nosocomial spread). The relative roles of gastrointestinal tract colonization and enteric translocation versus skin surface colonization and catheter-related infection are unclear and not mutually exclusive [121] . A prospective study, including 35 infected neonates, suggested that risk factors for candidemia included gestational age 32 weeks or younger, Apgar score less than 5, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, intralipid use, parenteral nutrition, CVCs, H 2 blockers, intubation, and length of stay more than 7 days [35] . Various other studies have largely confirmed or expanded on these results, including two more recent reports. A prospective, multicenter study by Benjamin and coworkers [116] analyzed data from 320 infants with extremely low birth weight and invasive candidiasis and found birth weight less than 750 g, male gender, delayed enteral feeding, and cephalosporin use all to be associated with disease. Cotten and associates [122] reported on 3702 infants with extremely low birth weight in 12 NICUs, linking candidiasis with third-generation cephalosporin use.\n\nFluconazole prophylaxis at dosage at 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/ kg twice weekly reduces rates of candidemia in premature neonates in NICUs that have a high incidence of candidemia [123, 124] . Because there are limited safety data on the prolonged use of fluconazole in neonates, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends routine fluconazole prophylaxis only for premature infants and infants with the extremely low birth weights in nurseries that have a high incidence of invasive candidiasis [125] .\n\nMalassezia species, which are lipophilic yeasts, frequently colonize NICU patients. In one French study, 30 of 54 preterm neonates (56%) became colonized with Malassezia furfur [126] . Malassezia pachydermatis, a zoonotic organism present on the skin and in the ear canals of healthy dogs and cats, also has been associated with nosocomial outbreaks in NICUs [126, 127] . In one report, the outbreak seemed to be linked to colonization of health care workers' pet dogs [126] .\n\nInvasive mold infections are a rare cause of nosocomial infection in neonates, but when they occur, they are associated with a high mortality rate. Aspergillus infections may manifest as pulmonary, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, or disseminated disease. A cutaneous presentation, with or without subsequent dissemination, seems to be the most common presentation for hospitalized premature infants without underlying immunodeficiency [128, 129] . Often, skin maceration is the presumed portal of entry. In a series of four patients who died of disseminated Aspergillus infection that started cutaneously, a contaminated device used to collect urine from the male infants was implicated [129] . Similarly, contaminated wooden tongue depressors, used as splints for intravenous and arterial cannulation sites, were associated with cutaneous infection owing to Rhizopus microsporus in four premature infants [130] . In addition to preterm birth, use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, steroid therapy, and hyperglycemia are thought to be risk factors for mold infection.\n\nEven zoophilic dermatophytes have been described as a source of nosocomial infection in neonates. In one report, five neonatal cases in one unit were traced to an infected nurse and her cat [131] . Prolonged therapy for the nurse and her cat was necessary to clear their infections.\n\nNosocomial viral infections can be a significant problem for neonates [132] . Introduction of common viral pathogens into the NICU can be associated with (1) admission of infants from the community, (2) health care workers who work while ill or infectious, and (3) visitors.\n\nAlthough many pathogens can cause nosocomial gastroenteritis, rotavirus is responsible for 95% or more of viral infections in high-risk nurseries, including the NICU [22, 133] . The clinical picture of rotavirus infections in newborns can vary markedly; there are many reports of asymptomatic rotavirus infection in nurseries [134] . In addition, rotavirus can be manifested as frequent and watery stools in term infants and as abdominal distention and bloody, mucoid stools in preterm neonates [133, 135] . A high titer of virus is excreted in stool of infected persons, and the organism is viable on hands and in the environment for relatively prolonged periods [136, 137] .\n\nAttention to hand hygiene and disinfection of potential fomites are crucial in preventing spread of infection. Rotavirus outbreaks in NICUs have been associated with poor hand hygiene, ill health care workers, and ill visitors [137] . Rotaviruses [138] and other enteric viruses, including norovirus [139] , astrovirus [140] , and toroviruses [141] , have been associated with necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\nRespiratory viruses, including influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus, have been reported to cause nosocomial infections in NICU patients [142] [143] [144] [145] . Associated clinical findings include rhinorrhea, tachypnea, retractions, nasal flaring, rales, and wheezing, but illness can also be manifested as apnea, sepsis-like illness, and gastrointestinal symptoms [137, [145] [146] [147] . Identified risk factors for acquisition vary from study to study, but have included low birth weight, low gestational age, twin pregnancy, mechanical ventilation, and high CRIB score [143] [144] [145] [146] . Contact and droplet transmission are the most common modes of spread of infection-highlighting the importance of scrupulous hand hygiene and adherence to transmission-based precautions.\n\nNumerous nursery and NICU outbreaks of enteroviral infection have been reported [148] [149] [150] . In a neonate with enteroviral infection, clinical manifestations can range from mild gastroenteritis to a severe and fulminant sepsis-like syndrome or meningitis and encephalitis. The latter presentation can be associated with a high mortality rate [149] . Several outbreak investigations have shown the introduction of enterovirus into a nursery via vertical transmission to an index case, with subsequent horizontal spread [149, 151] . Enteroviruses are typically shed in the stool of infected neonates for long periods, providing a reservoir of organisms that can be transmitted when breaches of infection control practices occur.\n\nCongenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can be asymptomatic or fulminant. Postnatally acquired CMV infections almost always follow a benign course in healthy term infants. Postnatal CMV infection in premature infants can be severe, however, and associated with hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, or pneumonitis [152] [153] [154] . The incidence of postnatal CMV infections in preterm infants has decreased significantly with the routine use of CMV-seronegative blood products. At present, most postnatal CMV infections are acquired through breast milk [155] . Approximately one third of infants who are breastfed by mothers with CMV detected in breast milk can develop infection [156] . In one study, approximately 50% of these infants had clinical features of infection, and 12% presented with a sepsis-like syndrome. At present, no proven, highly effective method is available for removing CMV from breast milk without destroying its beneficial components. Some data suggest, however, that freezing breast milk before use may decrease the CMV titer, limiting subsequent transmission [157] . Person-toperson transmission within the NICU has also been documented [158, 159] , but the extent to which this occurs is controversial [160] . More detailed information on the clinical features and management of CMV is presented in Chapter 23.\n\nMost neonates with herpes simplex virus (HSV) acquire the infection from their mother, although nursery transmission of HSV infection has been described [161] [162] [163] . Although the precise mechanism of transmission remains unclear in some cases, contact transmission has been commonly implicated. Presumed patient-to-patient transmission apparently via the hands of health care workers has been described [163] . Additionally, HSV can frequently be recovered from the hands of parents and health care worker with herpes labialis [164] . Strict attention to hand hygiene is critical to prevent nursery spread of HSV. Health care workers with herpetic whitlow are typically restricted from patient contact until the lesion is healed. An in-depth discussion of the clinical features and management of HSV is provided in Chapter 26.\n\nWith the adoption of varicella vaccine and health care worker screening for varicella immunity, nosocomial transmission of varicella-zoster virus has become rare [165] . Infants at greatest risk are premature infants born at less than 28 weeks of gestation who did not receive transplacental maternal antibodies. Transmission is most likely to occur from an adult with early, unrecognized symptoms of varicella because the virus is excreted in respiratory secretions 24 to 48 hours before onset of the characteristic rash. Management of neonates exposed to and infected with varicella-zoster virus is discussed in Chapter 22.\n\nHepatitis A NICU outbreaks of hepatitis A have been reported and have typically been recognized after diagnosis of a symptomatic adult [166] [167] [168] . Transmission has been documented via blood transfusion from a donor with acute infection [168] . In addition, indirect patient-to-patient transmission through fomites or health care worker hands can occur when there are subclinical cases (as is typical in neonatal hepatitis A infection) and lapses in the adherence to standard precautions. Neonatal hepatitis is discussed in depth in Chapter 25.\n\nBloodstream infections account for a large proportion of all HAIs in NICU patients [18] , and most are related to the use of an intravascular catheter [169] . Peripheral intravenous catheters are the most frequently used devices for neonatal patients. When a longer duration of access is necessary, nontunneled CVCs such as umbilical catheters or peripherally inserted central catheters are commonly used [170] .\n\nThe CDC has tracked rates of HAIs for many years, originally in the NNIS system and more recently in the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Using standardized definitions, NHSN reported rates of HAIs among 127 participating level III NICUs. Data from 2006-2007 that were published by NHSN revealed that the mean rate of central catheter-associated bloodstream infections ranged from 3.7 per 1000 catheter days for infants with birth weights less than 750 g to 2 per 1000 catheter days for infants with birth weights greater than 2500 g. Rates of umbilical catheter-associated bloodstream infections were 4.7 per 1000 catheter days for infants with birth weights less than 750 g and 1 per 1000 catheter days for infants with birth weights greater than 2500 g (Table 35 -3) [171] .\n\nThe origins of invasive organisms in neonates with catheter-associated bloodstream infections are often debated. Molecular analysis has show that most CoNS isolated from neonates with catheter-associated bloodstream infections are concordant with isolates recovered from lumens of catheter hubs, suggesting that many of these episodes of infection may be a consequence of intraluminal contamination, potentially associated with inadequate disinfection before catheter access [172] . Contamination of the catheter exit site has also been identified as a mechanism of infection in pediatric and adult patients. Finally, infusion of contaminated fluids, medications, or blood products can also give rise to catheterassociated bloodstream infections.\n\nSeveral advisory groups, including the CDC, the Vermont-Oxford Collaborative, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, have published detailed recommendations of strategies to reduce the incidence of catheter-associated bloodstream infections that strike a balance between patient safety and cost-effectiveness [169, 173, 174] . A compendium of strategies to prevent specific HAIs has been endorsed by the Society of Healthcare Epidemiologists of America and the Infectious Diseases Society of America and includes detailed information on strategies to prevent catheterassociated bloodstream infections (Table 35 -4) [174] .\n\nA key strategy to minimize the risk of catheter-associated bloodstream infections is the prompt removal of indwelling catheters when no longer medically necessary. Practices such as early enteral feeding and rapid conversion to oral medications whenever possible can shorten the length of time a patient requires a catheter. Finally, participation in quality improvement activities focused on improved hand hygiene and better adherence to best practices for catheter placement and maintenance has been shown to reduce the rate of catheter-associated bloodstream infections in NICUs [175] .\n\nEvidence-based guidelines for the prevention catheterassociated bloodstream infections in all patient populations recommend to avoid catheter placement in the groin because of a higher risk of infection [169] . More recent data in neonatal patients have shown, however, that catheter placement in the lower extremity is not associated with an increased risk of infection in neonates [176] . Umbilical veins and arteries are available for CVC insertion only in neonates. The umbilicus provides a site that can be cannulated easily, allowing for collection of blood specimens and hemodynamic measurements, but soon after birth, the umbilicus becomes heavily colonized with skin flora and other microorganisms. Nonetheless, rates of catheter colonization and catheter-associated bloodstream infections attributable to umbilical catheters are similar to rates associated with other types of CVC. Colonization rates for umbilical artery catheters are estimated to be 40% to 55%; the estimated rate for umbilical artery catheter-related bloodstream infection is 5% [169] . Colonization rates are 22% to 59% for umbilical vein catheters; rates for umbilical vein catheter-related bloodstream infections are 3% to 8% [169] . Careful skin antisepsis before insertion of an intravascular catheter is crucial to prevention of intravascular device-related bacteremia. The CDC recommends chlorhexidine-based preparations because these products have been found to be superior to povidone-iodine in reducing the risk of catheter colonization (a recognized surrogate marker of catheter-associated bloodstream infections). Although not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in infants younger than 2 months of age, some NICUs have reported the off-label use of this product [177] .\n\nAntiseptic solutions \"locked\" into a catheter lumen have been investigated as a strategy to prevent or treat catheter-associated bloodstream infections in adult patients; only a few studies have been performed in patients younger than 1 year of age. In a study performed in a community level III nursery, high-risk infants (infants with very low birth weight and others with critical illnesses) were randomly assigned to have a newly placed peripherally inserted central catheter \"locked\" several times a day with either a vancomycin-heparin solution or a heparin-only solution. The investigators noted a significant reduction in the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (relative risk 0.13; 95% confidence intervals 0.01 to 0.57) [178] . A single-center randomized clinical trial of fusidic acid-heparin solutions infused and held within a catheter lumen was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of catheterassociated bloodstream infections (6.6 versus 24.9 per 1000 catheter days; P < .01; relative risk 0.28; 95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.60). The high rate of catheterassociated bloodstream infections in the control group of infants suggests that this intervention might not be beneficial in settings that have already achieved low infection rates [179] . Because many NICUs achieve substantial reductions in the rates of catheter-associated bloodstream infections through application of other evidence-based practices, the role of antiseptic lock solutions needs further investigation.\n\nIn 2008, a Cochrane review examined whether prophylactic systemic antibiotics prevented neonatal infection or death. Through systematic review of the published literature, the investigators found only three small studies that evaluated this question. Although the authors observed that use of prophylactic systemic antibiotics was associated with a decreased risk of bloodstream infections, they concluded that this practice could not be recommended because there was no significant difference in overall mortality, and there were significant safety concerns related to the possible selection of resistant organisms [180] .\n\nOther strategies that are commonly used by clinicians caring for adult patients are not commonly used to prevent catheter-associated bloodstream infections in NICU patients. Although antiseptic-impregnated catheters are recommended for adult patients [169] , these catheters are not available in sizes small enough for neonates. In addition, although the CDC recommends changing the insertion site of peripheral intravenous catheters at least every 72 to 96 hours in adults, data suggest that leaving peripheral intravenous catheters in place in pediatric patients does not increase the risk of complications [181] . The 2002 CDC guidelines recommend that peripheral intravenous catheters be left in place in children until therapy is completed, unless complications occur [169] .\n\nHealth care-associated pneumonia is the second most common HAI in NICU patients; most of these cases are VAP. Neonatal VAP has been associated with increased direct costs and prolonged length of hospitalization [182] . Gram-negative organisms are the most commonly recovered pathogens from tracheal specimens of patients with VAP [182] .\n\nThe pathogenesis of VAP is most commonly attributed to one of three different mechanisms: aspiration of secretions, colonization of the aerodigestive tract, or use of contaminated equipment [183] . Specific risk factors for VAP are associated with these basic pathogenic mechanisms and include host characteristics (prematurity, low birth weight, sedation, or use of paralytic agents), exposure to medical devices (endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, orogastric or nasogastric tube placement), and factors that increase bacterial colonization of the aerodigestive tract (broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, antacids, or H 2 blockers) [182, [184] [185] [186] .\n\nFew studies have been performed to assess the effectiveness of VAP prevention strategies in pediatric patients; most commonly used strategies to prevent VAP in NICU patients are based on studies performed in adults. In 2008, infectious disease experts and hospital epidemiologists published a broad review entitled, \"Strategies to Prevent Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia in Acute Care Hospitals.\" This document should serve as a guideline for NICUs working to reduce the rate of VAP in their patients; Table 35 -5 provides a summary of these recommendations [183] . The core recommendations are designed to interrupt the three most common mechanisms by which VAP typically develops. An obvious, but key, component of VAP prevention is to minimize the use of invasive mechanical ventilation. This can be accomplished by the use of weaning protocols, daily sedation vacations to assess readiness to wean, and increased use of noninvasive ventilation [187, 188] .\n\nPractices designed to minimize aspiration of pathogenic organisms include performing regular oral care (even in the absence of teeth), patient positioning in a semirecumbent angle, avoiding gastric overdistention, and avoiding unplanned extubations. A single-center study showed delayed onset of tracheal colonization in intubated infants who were positioned on their side; however, no studies have shown a clear reduction in neonatal VAP associated with strict adherence to this practice [189] . Appropriate placement of enteral feeding tubes should be verified before their use [190, 191] . To prevent regurgitation and potential aspiration of stomach contents by a sedated patient, overdistention of the stomach should be avoided by regular monitoring of the patient's intestinal motility, serial measurement of residual gastric volume or abdominal girth, reducing the use of narcotics and anticholinergic agents, and adjusting the rate and volume of enteral feedings [190, 191] . Oral decontamination, with the intent of decreasing oropharyngeal colonization, has been studied in adults and seems to reduce the incidence of VAP [192, 193] . Many NICUs have already adopted regular oral care as a component of their VAP prevention activities.\n\nFinally, avoidance of H 2 blocking agents and proton pump inhibitors in patients without a high risk of stress gastritis may reduce the risk of VAP by minimizing the density of bacterial colonization of the stomach [194] . Two small studies performed in pediatric patients failed to show a significant benefit; however, the authors stressed that additional studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings [195, 196] . Further studies are needed to define the most important VAP prevention strategies for young infants and to determine the relative contribution of each of these strategies in neonates.\n\nCareful attention to the appropriate disinfection and reprocessing of reusable components of respiratory care equipment is also important [197] . In addition, circuits should be monitored for the accumulation of condensate and drained periodically, with care taken to avoid allowing the condensate, a potential reservoir for pathogens, to drain toward the patient [191] . Other basic infection control measures, such as hand hygiene and standard precautions, can also reduce the risk of VAP and other types of nosocomial pneumonia and are generally recommended for all ventilated patients [183] .\n\nNosocomial urinary tract infections are commonly identified as the most common cause of HAIs in adults [198] ; however, data from NHSN and single-center studies suggest that the incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infections among hospitalized neonates is significantly lower than observed in adults [171, 199] . Gram-negative organisms, yeast, and enterococci are the most frequently reported pathogens [199] . Risk factors that have been specifically identified in young children include prolonged catheterization and young age [199, 200] . Although few studies have prospectively evaluated strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections in neonates, implementation of the strategies outlined in the document \"Strategies to Prevent Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections\" is recommended [198] .\n\nPremature infants are at significant risk of intraventricular hemorrhage and may require temporary or permanent diversion of cerebrospinal fluid to manage obstructive hydrocephalus. Placement of cerebrospinal fluid shunts is associated with a significant risk of postoperative infections, either ventriculitis or more superficial surgical site infections. Premature births, prior shunt placement, breeches in aseptic technique during shunt placement, and use of a neuroendoscope have been identified as risk factors for shunt infections [201, 202] . Use of antimicrobial-impregnated suture material and shunt catheters are currently being evaluated as possible strategies to reduce the risk of these infections [203] [204] [205] .\n\nAn effective infection control program that focuses on reducing risk on a prospective basis can decrease the incidence of HAIs [206, 207] . The principal function of such a program is to protect the infant and the health care worker from risk of HAI in a manner that is cost-effective. Activities crucial to achieving and maintaining this goal include collection and management of critical data relating to surveillance for nosocomial infection and direct intervention to interrupt the transmission of infectious diseases [19] .\n\nSurveillance is an essential component of infection prevention programs. The definitions provided by the CDC have been widely adopted and provide specific definitions and data collection for the NICU population [208] [209] [210] . These definitions do not distinguish, however, late-onset infections caused by transplacentally acquired organisms (e.g., group B streptococcus infections) from more typical nosocomial infections [210] . Distinction between maternal and hospital sources of infection is important, although difficult at times, because control measures designed to prevent acquisition from hospital sources would be ineffective in preventing perinatal acquisition of pathogens [211] . Surveillance for infections in healthy newborns also is challenging because of the typically short length of stay. Infections can develop after discharge, and these are more difficult for infection control practitioners to capture. Methods for postdischarge surveillance have been developed, but because most neonatal infections that occur after discharge are noninvasive [212] , such surveillance has not been widely implemented owing to concerns about the cost-effectiveness of these labor-intensive processes.\n\nSurveillance data must be analyzed and presented in a way that facilitates interpretation, comparison directed internally and with comparable external benchmarks, and dissemination within the organization. Quality improvement tools (e.g., control and run charts) can be useful for these purposes. Statistical tools should be used to determine the significance of findings, although statistical significance should always be balanced with the evaluation of clinical significance [213] . External benchmarking through interhospital comparison is a valuable tool for improving quality of care [214, 215] , but should be performed only when surveillance methodologies (e.g., case definitions, case finding, data collection methods, intensity of surveillance) [213] can reasonably be assumed to be consistent between facilities.\n\nInfection data must be shared with personnel who can effect change and implement infection control interventions. Written reports summarizing the data and appropriate control charts should be provided to the facility's infection control committee, unit leaders, and members of the hospital administration on an ongoing basis. The interval between reports is determined by the needs of the institution. In addition to formal written reports, face-to-face reports are appropriate in the event of identification of a serious problem or an outbreak. Infection control practitioners can serve as consultants to assist NICU or neonatology service leaders in addressing infection rate increases or outbreak management.\n\nMore recently, controversy has emerged over the use of active surveillance cultures to identify infants colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms. Although many adult ICUs have begun to screen all patients routinely on admission for carriage of various multidrug-resistant organisms, this practice has not yet been consistently adopted by NICUs. Factors such as the perceived low rate of carriage of resistant organisms by infants have undoubtedly led some neonatologists to question the need for universal screening on NICU admission. Data have shown, however, that a significant reservoir of resistant organisms can exist in hospitalized neonates. After two patients developed clinical infections owing to VRE, surveillance cultures revealed that more than 15% of other patients in the same unit had unsuspected VRE colonization [109, 110] .\n\nSome units have adopted regularly scheduled point prevalence surveys as an alternative strategy to universal surveillance. Point prevalence surveys are most useful in units with a known low prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms and can be used for early detection of increasing rates of carriage of multidrug-resistant organisms. Some NICUs have used active surveillance for carriage of multidrug-resistant organisms to guide programs that have led to the successful eradication of MRSA [216] .\n\nThe most widely accepted guideline for preventing the transmission of infections in hospitals was developed by the CDC [217] . Updated in 2007, the guideline recommends using two tiers of precautions. The first and most important, standard precautions, was designed for the management of all hospitalized patients regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infection status. The second, transmission-based precautions, is intended for patients documented or suspected to be infected or colonized with highly transmissible or epidemiologically important pathogens for which additional precautions to interrupt transmission are needed.\n\nStandard precautions are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from recognized and unrecognized sources and are to be followed for the care of all patients, including neonates. They apply to blood; all body fluids, secretions, and excretions except sweat; nonintact skin; and mucous membranes. Components of standard precautions include hand hygiene and wearing gloves, gowns, and masks and other forms of eye protection.\n\nHand hygiene plays a key role for caregivers in the reduction of nosocomial infection for patients [26, 218] and in prevention of HAIs. Hand hygiene should be performed before and after all patient contacts; before donning sterile gloves to perform an invasive procedure; after contact with blood, body fluids or excretions, mucous membranes, nonintact skin, and wound dressings; in moving from a contaminated body site to a clean body site during patient care (i.e., from changing a diaper to performing mouth care); after contact with inanimate objects in the immediate vicinity of the patient; after removing gloves; and before eating and after using the restroom [88] . When hands are visibly soiled or contaminated with proteinaceous materials, blood, or body fluids and after using the restroom, hands should be washed with soap and water.\n\nWhen hands are not visibly soiled, alcohol-based hand rubs, foams, or gels are an important tool for hand hygiene. Compared with washing with soap and water, use of the alcohol-based products is at least as effective against a variety of pathogens and requires less time, and these agents are less damaging to skin. The CDC \"Guideline for Hand Hygiene in the Health Care Setting\" calls for use of alcohol hand rubs, foams, or gels as the primary method to clean hands except when hands are visibly soiled [88] . Specific activities that have been independently associated with increased density of pathogens on health care worker hands include skin contact, respiratory care, and diaper changes. Additionally, investigators have shown that the use of gloves during these activities does not fully protect health care workers' hands from bacterial contamination [219] . Programs that have been successful in improving hand hygiene and decreasing nosocomial infection have used multidisciplinary teams to develop interventions focusing on use of the alcohol rubs in the setting of institutional commitment and support for the initiative [26, 220, 221] .\n\nHealth care workers should wash hands and forearms to the elbows on arrival in the nursery. A 3-minute scrub has been suggested [67] , but consensus on optimal duration of initial hand hygiene is lacking. At a minimum, the initial wash should be long enough to ensure thorough washing and rinsing of all parts of the hands and forearms. Routine hand washing throughout care delivery should consist of wetting the hands, applying product, rubbing all surfaces of the hands and fingers vigorously for at least 15 seconds, rinsing, and patting dry with disposable towels [88] . Wearing hand jewelry has been associated with increased microbial load on hands; whether this results in increased transmission of pathogens is unknown. Many experts recommend, however, that hand and wrist jewelry not be worn in the nursery [222, 223] . In addition, the CDC guideline states that staff who have direct contact with infants in NICUs should not wear artificial fingernails or nail extenders [88] . Only natural nails kept less than \u00bc inch long should be allowed; at least one outbreak in an NICU was associated with a health care worker who wore artificial nails [224] .\n\nClean, nonsterile gloves are to be worn whenever contact with blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and contaminated items is anticipated. The health care worker should change gloves when moving from dirty to clean tasks performed on the same patient, such as after changing a diaper and before suctioning a patient, and whenever they become soiled. Because hands can become contaminated during removal of gloves, and because gloves may have tiny, unnoticeable defects, wearing gloves is not a substitute for hand hygiene. Hand hygiene must be performed immediately after glove removal [23] .\n\nPersonnel in nurseries including the NICU historically have worn cover gowns for all routine patient contact. The practice has not been found to reduce infection or colonization in neonates and is unnecessary [225, 226] . Instead, CDC guidelines recommend nonsterile, fluidresistant gowns to be worn as barrier protection when soiling of clothing is anticipated and in performing procedures likely to result in splashing or spraying of body substances [23] . Possible examples of such procedures in the NICU are placing an arterial line and irrigating a wound. The Perinatal Guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that a long-sleeved gown be worn over clothing when a neonate is held outside the bassinette by nursery personnel [67] .\n\nNonsterile masks, face shields, goggles, and other eye protectors are worn in various combinations to provide barrier protection and should be used during procedures and patient care activities that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of body substances and fluids [23] .\n\nStandard precautions also require that reusable patient care equipment be cleaned and appropriately reprocessed between patients; that soiled linen be handled carefully to prevent contamination of skin, clothing, or the environment; that sharps (i.e., needles, scalpels) be handled carefully to prevent exposure to blood-borne pathogens; and that mouthpieces and other resuscitation devices be used rather than mouth-to-mouth methods of resuscitation [23] .\n\nIn addition to standard precautions, which must be used for every patient, the CDC recommends transmissionbased precautions when the patient is known or suspected to be infected or colonized with epidemiologically important or highly transmissible organisms. Always used in addition to standard precautions, transmission-based precautions comprise three categories: contact precautions, droplet precautions, and airborne precautions.\n\nContact precautions involve the use of barriers to prevent transmission of organisms by direct or indirect contact with the patient or contaminated objects in the patient's immediate environment [23] . Sources of indirect contact transmission in nurseries include monitor leads, thermometers, isolettes, breast pumps [227] , toys, and contaminated hands [208] .\n\nIdeally, a patient requiring contact precautions should be placed in a private room. Many nurseries have few if any isolation rooms, however. Cohorting of patients infected with the same microorganism can be a safe and effective alternative [23] . The American Academy of Pediatrics states that infected neonates requiring contact precautions can be safely cared for without an isolation room if staffing is adequate to allow appropriate hand hygiene, a 4-to 6-foot-wide space can be provided between care stations, adequate hand hygiene facilities are available, and staff members are well trained regarding infection transmission modes [67] .\n\nHealth care workers should wear clean, nonsterile gloves when entering the room or space of a patient requiring contact precautions and should wear a cover gown when their clothing will have contact with the infant, environmental surfaces, or items in the infant's area. A cover gown also should be worn when the infant has excretions or secretions that are not well contained, such as diarrhea or wound drainage, which may escape the diaper or dressing. Infant care equipment should be dedicated to the patient if possible so that it is not shared with others [23] . Examples of conditions in the neonate that require contact precautions include neonatal mucocutaneous HSV infection, respiratory syncytial virus infection, varicella (also see airborne precautions), and infection or colonization with a resistant organism such as MRSA.\n\nDroplet precautions are intended to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents in large-particle droplets from an infected person. Such transmission usually occurs when the infected person generates droplets during coughing, sneezing, or talking or during procedures such as suctioning. These relatively large droplets travel only short distances and do not remain suspended in the air and can be deposited on the conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, or mouth of persons working within 3 feet of the infected patient [23] . Patients requiring droplet precautions should be placed in private rooms (see earlier discussion of isolation rooms in nurseries in the section on contact precautions), and staff should wear masks when working within 3 feet of the patient [23] . Examples of conditions in the neonate that necessitate droplet precautions are pertussis and invasive Neisseria meningitidis infection.\n\nAirborne precautions are designed to reduce the risk of airborne transmission of infectious agents [23] . Because of their small size, airborne droplet nuclei and dust particles containing infectious agents or spores can be widely spread on air currents or through ventilation systems and inhaled by or deposited on susceptible hosts. Special air-handling systems and ventilation are required to prevent transmission. Patients requiring airborne precautions should be placed in private rooms in negative air-pressure ventilation with 6 to 12 air changes per hour. Air should be externally exhausted or subjected to high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration if it is recirculated [208] .\n\nExamples of conditions in neonates for which airborne precautions are required are varicella-zoster virus infections and measles. Susceptible health care workers should not enter the rooms of patients with these viral infections. If assignment cannot be avoided, susceptible staff members should wear masks to deliver care. If immunity has been documented, staff members need not wear masks [208] . Airborne precautions also are required for active pulmonary tuberculosis, and although neonates are rarely contagious, the CDC recommends isolating patients while they are being evaluated [228] . A more important consideration is the need to isolate the family of a suspected tuberculosis patient until an evaluation for pulmonary tuberculosis has been completed because the source of infection frequently is a member of the child's family [229, 230] .\n\nHealth care workers caring for neonates have the potential to transmit or to acquire infections while providing care to infant patients. Health care workers are at high risk of acquiring respiratory syncytial virus when caring for infected children and can subsequently spread infection to other patients [231] [232] [233] . Generally, health care workers with respiratory, cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or gastrointestinal infections should not deliver direct patient care to neonates [234] . In addition, nonimmune staff members exposed to highly communicable diseases, such as varicella and measles, should not work during the contagious portion of the incubation period [235] . In contrast, staff members with HSV infection rarely have been implicated in transmission of HSV to infants and do not need to be routinely excluded from direct patient care. Lesions should be covered, and health care workers should be instructed not to touch their lesions and to practice excellent hand hygiene.\n\nAcquisition of CMV often is a concern of pregnant health care workers because of the potential effect on the fetus. The prevalence of asymptomatic CMV secretion is approximately 1% among infants in most nurseries [208] . Because the risk of acquiring CMV infection is the same for health care workers compared with the general population, pregnant caregivers can safely provide care to neonates who are shedding CMV.\n\nNurse-to-patient ratios have been inversely correlated with the rates of nosocomial infections and mortality [42, 236, 237] . Although optimal staffing ratios have not been established for NICUs and vary according to characteristics of individual units and patients, one study showed that the incidence of clustered S. aureus infections was 16 times higher after periods when the infant-to-nurse ratio exceeded 7:1. Decreased compliance with hand hygiene during a period of understaffing has been associated with increased rates of nosocomial infection [75] .\n\nFamily-centered care has emerged as a guiding principle of pediatric health care. In the NICU, health care workers often encourage parents to become involved in the nonmedical aspects of their infant's care. Principles of familycentered care also include liberal NICU visitation for relatives, siblings, and family friends and the involvement of parents in the development of nursery policies and programs that promote parenting skills [238] . The benefits of family-centered care can be undermined by an increased risk of infection for the neonatal patient. Mothers can transmit infections to neonates postpartum, although separation of mother and newborn rarely is indicated. To ensure the risk of postpartum transmission is minimal, all mothers should wash their hands before handing their infants. For mothers with postpartum fever, care should be taken to ensure that the infant does not come into contact with contaminated dressings, linen, clothing, or pads [234] .\n\nMothers with other infections can also safely visit their infants. Mothers with active herpes labialis should not kiss or nuzzle their infants until lesions have cleared; lesions should be covered, and a surgical mask may be worn until the lesions are crusted and dry. The importance of hand hygiene should be emphasized. Mothers with viral respiratory infections should be educated about how to interrupt transmission of these pathogens. Strategies such as covering a cough, prompt disposal of used tissues, and scrupulous hand hygiene should be taught before visiting. In addition, masks can be worn to reduce the risk of droplet transmission [234, 235] .\n\nAs previously mentioned, a few infections do require brief separations of mother and infant. Women with untreated active pulmonary tuberculosis should be separated from their infants until they no longer are contagious. Mothers with group A streptococcal infections, especially if a draining wound is present, also should be isolated from their infants until they are no longer contagious.\n\nNumerous studies support the value of human milk for infants (see Chapter 5) . Breast milk provides optimal nutritional content for infants, and breast-fed infants experience fewer episodes of infection and sepsis during the 1st year of life [15, 239] . There are, however, several infectious contraindications to breast-feeding; mothers who have active untreated tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (except in countries where the risk of not breast-feeding outweighs the potential risk of HIV transmission [see Chapters 5 and 21]), breast abscesses (as opposed to simple mastitis that is being treated with antimicrobial therapy), or HSV lesions around the nipples should not breast-feed. In contrast, mothers who are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen may safely breast-feed their infants because ingestion of infected milk has not been shown to increase the risk of transmission to an infant who has received hepatitis B virus immunoglobulin and vaccine immediately after birth [240] .\n\nTransmission of CMV has been observed in preterm infants who receive breast milk of CMV-seropositive mothers, presumably owing to the infant's low titers of anti-CMV antibody. Decisions regarding breast-feeding should weigh the benefits of human milk and the risk of CMV transmission. Freezing breast milk has been shown to decrease viral titers, but does not eliminate CMV; pasteurization of human milk can inactivate CMV (see Chapter 5) . Either method may be considered in attempts to decrease risk of transmission for breast-feeding NICU neonates [241] .\n\nNeonates in the NICU frequently are incapable of breast-feeding because of maternal separation, unstable respiratory status, and immaturity of the sucking reflex. For these reasons, mothers of such infants must use a breast pump to collect milk for administration through a feeding tube. Pumping, collection, and storage of breast milk create opportunities for contamination of the milk and for cross-infection if equipment is shared among mothers. Several studies have shown contamination of breast pumps, contamination of expressed milk that had been frozen and thawed, and higher levels of stool colonization with aerobic bacteria in infants fed precollected breast milk [15, 179, 242, 243] . Mothers who are able to pump or express their breast milk should be taught optimal collection, storage, and administration techniques. Cleaning and disinfection of breast pumps should be included in educational material provided to nursing mothers. In addition, mothers should be instructed to perform hand hygiene and cleanse nipples with cotton and plain water before expressing milk in sterile containers [211, 241] .\n\nExpressed breast milk can be refrigerated for 48 hours and can be safely frozen (\u00c020 C AE 2 C [\u00c04 F AE 3.6 F]) for 6 months [211] . Vessels containing frozen breast milk can be thawed quickly under warm running water (avoiding contamination with tap water) or gradually in a refrigerator. Exposure to high temperatures, as may be experienced in a microwave, can destroy valuable components of the milk. Thawed breast milk can be stored in the refrigerator for 24 hours before it must be discarded. To avoid proliferation of microorganisms, milk administered through a feeding tube by continuous infusion should hang no longer than 4 to 6 hours before replacement of the milk, container, and tubing [234] .\n\nThe principles of family-centered care encourage liberal visitation policies in the well-infant nursery (or roomingin scenario) and in the NICU. Parents, including fathers, should be allowed unlimited visitation to their newborns, and siblings should be allowed liberal visitation. Expanding the number of visitors to neonates may increase the risk of disease exposure, however, if education and screening for symptoms of infection are not implemented. Written policies should be in place to guide sibling visits, and parents should be encouraged to share the responsibility of protecting their newborn from contagious illnesses.\n\nAdult visitors to neonates, including parents, have been implicated in outbreaks of infections including P. aeruginosa infection, pertussis, and Salmonella infection [236, 244, 245] .\n\nThe principles for sibling visitation should be applied to adult visitors as well. Visitors should be screened for symptoms of contagious illness, should be instructed to perform hand hygiene before entering the NICU and before and after touching the neonate, and should interact only with the family member they came to the hospital to visit. Families of neonates who have lengthy NICU stays may come to know each other well and serve as sources of emotional support to one another. Nevertheless, they should be educated about the potential of transmitting microorganisms and infections between families if standard precautions and physical separation are not maintained, even though they may be sharing an inpatient space.\n\nBathing the newborn is standard practice in nurseries, but very little standardization in frequency or cleansing product exists. If not performed carefully, bathing can be detrimental to the infant, resulting in hypothermia, increased crying with resulting increases in oxygen consumption, respiratory distress, and instability of vital signs [177] . Although the initial bath or cleansing should be delayed until the neonate's temperature has been stable for several hours, removing blood and drying the skin immediately after delivery may remove potentially infectious microorganisms such as hepatitis B virus, HSV, and HIV, minimizing risk to the neonate from maternal infection [234] . When the newborn requires an intramuscular injection in the delivery room, infection sites should be cleansed with alcohol to prevent transmission of organisms that may be present in maternal blood and body fluids [170] . For routine bathing in the first few weeks of life, plain warm water should be used. This is especially important for preterm infants and full-term infants with barrier compromise such as abrasions or dermatitis. If a soap is necessary for heavily soiled areas, a mild pH-neutral product without additives should be used, and duration of soaping should be restricted to less than 5 minutes no more than three times per week [177] .\n\nFew randomized studies comparing cord care regimens and infection rates have been performed, and consensus has not been reached on best practice regarding care of the umbilical cord stump. A review published in 2003 described care regimens used for more than 2 decades, including combinations of triple dye, chlorhexidine, 70% alcohol, bacitracin, hexachlorophene, povidone-iodine, and \"dry care\" (soap and water cleansing of soiled periumbilical skin), and found variable impact on colonization of the stump [246] . The study authors suggested that dry cord care alone may be insufficient and that chlorhexidine seemed to be a favorable antiseptic choice for cord care because of its activity against gram-positive and gramnegative bacteria. They went on to stress, however, that large, well-designed studies were required before firm conclusions could be drawn. The current Perinatal Guidelines do not recommend a specific regimen, but warn that use of alcohol alone is not an effective method of preventing umbilical cord colonization and omphalitis [241] . The Perinatal Guidelines further recommend that diapers be folded away from and below the stump and that emollients not be applied to the stump [177] ."}
