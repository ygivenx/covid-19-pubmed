{"title": "Full Title: A systematic review of MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) 2 seroprevalence and viral RNA prevalence in dromedary camels: implications for animal vaccination", "body": "Since the first human case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection 53 was detected in 2012 (1), a substantial evidence base has built up showing dromedary camels to be the 54 zoonotic source of this virus (2) . MERS-CoV circulates extensively in dromedary populations causing 55 no impactful disease. Human infection, however, is associated with a measured case fatality ratio of 56 around 35% (3). Following spillover events, human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is 57 relatively inefficient and limited to close, unprotected contact environments such as hospitals (4, 5) .\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of viral sequences isolated from dromedaries and humans indicates that 59 hundreds of camel-to-human spillover events are likely to have occurred since 2012 (6). Taken 60 together, recurring dromedary-to-human transmission is driving ongoing human infection.\n\nThe key role of dromedaries in human MERS-CoV infection has led decision-makers to consider 62 dromedary vaccination as part of MERS-CoV prevention interventions (2) . Dromedary-targeted 63 vaccine candidates in the development pipeline are showing promising results and include an 64 orthopox-virus based vaccine capable of greatly reducing viral shedding in dromedary challenge 78 is infectious, detection of viral RNA through RT-PCR can be used as a proxy for the prevalence and 79 distribution of infectious dromedaries (8-10).\n\nBy conducting a qualitative synthesis of the study findings, considering reported heterogeneities, and 81 summarising the results of longitudinal studies of infection and immunity, we aim to assess the extent 82 of current understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology in dromedaries, implications for control, and 83 gaps to be addressed going forward. We note that a similar systematic review of the literature up until\n\nMay 2018 was unknowingly carried out in parallel to our own (11), with no discussion between the 85 two groups. Here, we confirm and update the results of the parallel review, discussing our results in The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/574103 doi: bioRxiv preprint g. study also tested different site-types but measured RNA in serum sample rather than nasal swab so this was not included 139 h. range is across weeks rather than regions 140 i. both (66) and (65) report RNA prevalence from the same study 141 j. unclear whether study found negative camels -it only mentions that 6 camels were tested, found positive and viral genomes were isolated 142 \u2022neutralisation test limited to a subset of samples or only used to detect presence of high titres 143 ** No positivity cut-off titre given but all samples had incredibly high titres, and were able to neutralise at dilution >1:1280 Although MERS-CoV seroprevalence is consistently high across West, North, East Africa 180 and the Middle East at the country level, some studies measured considerable within-country 181 variation in seroprevalence, particularly in Africa (ranges given in Table 1 ). In Kenya all 182 three studies that presented sub-nationally disaggregated results showed seroprevalence to 183 vary greatly by province. Tunisia, Morocco and Mali also showed considerable regional 184 seroprevalence variation. Less regional variation in seroprevalence was observed within Several studies found imported animals to have significantly higher seroprevalence than their 188 locally bred counterparts (22, 25, 29, 30) . Dromedaries sampled at markets, abattoirs and 189 quarantine sites had higher seroprevalence than those in farms, villages and research facilities 190 (22, 29, 30, 39) . In some cases, dromedary origin varied with the type of site sampled 191 suggesting confounding.\n\nIn a study conducted across Burkina Faso, Morocco and Ethiopia, dromedaries used for milk 193 and meat had higher seroprevalence than those used for transport (23). In most of the studies 194 that stratified by sex, little difference was seen, but in Kenya females had statistically 195 significantly higher seroprevalence than males (93% vs. 81% in one study (42), and 74% vs. (44)) whereas males had significantly higher seroprevalence in Egypt and in 197 KSA (72% and 84% in males vs. 66% in females) (29, 70).\n\nLarge and medium herd-size was a significant risk factor for seropositivity across Burkina The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/574103 doi: bioRxiv preprint were positive for MERS-CoV RNA ranged from 7-45 days across published studies, with 259 most positive animals becoming negative within 2 weeks (62, 65, 67, 69) . All available 260 studies followed animals that were found to be MERS-CoV RNA positive at the first instance 261 of sampling and the duration of shedding prior to sampling is unknown. Further to this, 262 intermittent RNA shedding, and evidence of potential rapid reinfection/coinfection has been 263 observed (65, 67).\n\nThree studies have found dromedaries to be shedding MERS-CoV RNA despite having high 266 antibody titres months or weeks prior to detectable infection. Both older animals whose 267 antibodies reflect past exposure (29, 76, 79) , and young calves whose high antibody titres 268 were maternally-acquired immediately post-partum, became infected (79).\n\nOne study directly observed recurring infection amongst a herd of dromedaries in Egypt.\n\nFour animals were shedding 1-3 months prior to a herd-wide epidemic in which they were The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/574103 doi: bioRxiv preprint 310 Age-dependent seroprevalence patterns suggest that the higher prevalence of viral shedding 311 in juveniles compared with adults is likely due to immunological naivety. The age-312 distribution of reported infections synthesised here, suggests that contact with juveniles may 313 pose greater risks of human transmission than adults, making them potential targets for 314 vaccination. However, frequency of human contact with dromedaries may also be animal- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/574103 doi: bioRxiv preprint 362 seropositivity, sample-site type and sample population characteristics.
