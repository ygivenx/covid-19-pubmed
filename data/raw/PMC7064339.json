{"title": "Accelerated viral dynamics in bat cell lines, with implications for zoonotic emergence", "body": "Bats have received much attention in recent years for their role as reservoir hosts for emerging viral zoonoses, including rabies and related lyssaviruses, Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and SARS coronavirus (Calisher et al., 2006; Wang and Anderson, 2019). In most non-Chiropteran mammals, henipaviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses induce substantial morbidity and mortality, display short durations of infection, and elicit robust, long-term immunity in hosts surviving infection (Nicholls et al., 2003; Hooper et al., 2001; Mahanty and Bray, 2004). Bats, by contrast, demonstrate no obvious disease symptoms upon infection with pathogens that are highly virulent in non-volant mammals (Schountz et al., 2017) but may, instead, support viruses as long-term persistent infections, rather than transient, immunizing pathologies (Plowright et al., 2016).\n\nRecent research advances are beginning to shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which bats avoid pathology from these otherwise virulent pathogens (Brook and Dobson, 2015). Bats leverage a suite of species-specific mechanisms to limit viral load, which include host receptor sequence incompatibilities for some bat-virus combinations (Ng et al., 2015; Takadate et al., 2020) and constitutive expression of the antiviral cytokine, IFN-\u03b1, for others (Zhou et al., 2016). Typically, the presence of viral RNA or DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells will induce secretion of type I interferon proteins (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), which promote expression and translation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in neighboring cells and render them effectively antiviral (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006). In some bat cells, the transcriptomic blueprints for this IFN response are expressed constitutively, even in the absence of stimulation by viral RNA or DNA (Zhou et al., 2016). In non-flying mammals, constitutive IFN expression would likely elicit widespread inflammation and concomitant immunopathology upon viral infection, but bats support unique adaptations to combat inflammation (Zhang et al., 2013; Ahn et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2018; Pavlovich et al., 2018) that may have evolved to mitigate metabolic damage induced during flight (Kacprzyk et al., 2017). The extent to which constitutive IFN-\u03b1 expression signifies constitutive antiviral defense in the form of functional IFN-\u03b1 protein remains unresolved. In bat cells constitutively expressing IFN-\u03b1, some protein-stimulated, downstream ISGs appear to be also constitutively expressed, but additional ISG induction is nonetheless possible following viral challenge and stimulation of IFN-\u03b2 (Zhou et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018). Despite recent advances in molecular understanding of bat viral tolerance, the consequences of this unique bat immunity on within-host virus dynamics\u2014and its implications for understanding zoonotic emergence\u2014have yet to be elucidated.\n\nThe field of \u2018virus dynamics\u2019 was first developed to describe the mechanistic underpinnings of long-term patterns of steady-state viral load exhibited by patients in chronic phase infections with HIV, who appeared to produce and clear virus at equivalent rates (Nowak and May, 2000; Ho et al., 1995). Models of simple target cell depletion, in which viral load is dictated by a bottom-up resource supply of infection-susceptible host cells, were first developed for HIV (Perelson, 2002) but have since been applied to other chronic infections, including hepatitis-C virus (Neumann et al., 1998), hepatitis-B virus (Nowak et al., 1996) and cytomegalovirus (Emery et al., 1999). Recent work has adopted similar techniques to model the within-host dynamics of acute infections, such as influenza A and measles, inspiring debate over the extent to which explicit modeling of top-down immune control can improve inference beyond the basic resource limitation assumptions of the target cell model (Baccam et al., 2006; Pawelek et al., 2012; Saenz et al., 2010; Morris et al., 2018).\n\nTo investigate the impact of unique bat immune processes on in vitro viral kinetics, we first undertook a series of virus infection experiments on bat cell lines expressing divergent interferon phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model elucidating the dynamics of within-host viral spread. We evaluated our theoretical model analytically independent of the data, then fit the model to data recovered from in vitro experimental trials in order to estimate rates of within-host virus transmission and cellular progression to antiviral status under diverse assumptions of absent, induced, and constitutive immunity. Finally, we confirmed our findings in spatially-explicit stochastic simulations of fitted time series from our mean field model. We hypothesized that top-down immune processes would overrule classical resource-limitation in bat cell lines described as constitutively antiviral in the literature, offering a testable prediction for models fit to empirical data. We further predicted that the most robust antiviral responses would be associated with the most rapid within-host virus propagation rates but also protect cells against virus-induced mortality to support the longest enduring infections in tissue culture.\n\nWe first explored the influence of innate immune phenotype on within-host viral propagation in a series of infection experiments in cell culture. We conducted plaque assays on six-well plate monolayers of three immortalized mammalian kidney cell lines: [1] Vero (African green monkey) cells, which are IFN-defective and thus limited in antiviral capacity (Desmyter et al., 1968); [2] RoNi/7.1 (Rousettus aegyptiacus) cells which demonstrate idiosyncratic induced interferon responses upon viral challenge (Kuzmin et al., 2017; Arnold et al., 2018; Biesold et al., 2011; Pavlovich et al., 2018); and [3] PaKiT01 (Pteropus alecto) cells which constitutively express IFN-\u03b1 (Zhou et al., 2016; Crameri et al., 2009). To intensify cell line-specific differences in constitutive immunity, we carried out infectivity assays with GFP-tagged, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis Indiana viruses: rVSV-G, rVSV-EBOV, and rVSV-MARV, which have been previously described (Miller et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2010). Two of these viruses, rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV, are recombinants for which cell entry is mediated by the glycoprotein of the bat-evolved filoviruses, Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV), thus allowing us to modulate the extent of structural, as well as immunological, antiviral defense at play in each infection. Previous work in this lab has demonstrated incompatibilities in the NPC1 filovirus receptor which render PaKiT01 cells refractory to infection with rVSV-MARV (Ng and Chandrab, 2018, Unpublished results), making them structurally antiviral, over and above their constitutive expression of IFN-\u03b1. All three cell lines were challenged with all three viruses at two multiplicities of infection (MOI): 0.001 and 0.0001. Between 18 and 39 trials were run at each cell-virus-MOI combination, excepting rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells at MOI = 0.001, for which only eight trials were run (see Materials and methods; Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133, Supplementary file 1).\n\nBecause plaque assays restrict viral transmission neighbor-to-neighbor in two-dimensional cellular space (Howat et al., 2006), we were able to track the spread of GFP-expressing virus-infected cells across tissue monolayers via inverted fluorescence microscopy. For each infection trial, we monitored and re-imaged plates for up to 200 hr of observations or until total monolayer destruction, processed resulting images, and generated a time series of the proportion of infectious-cell occupied plate space across the duration of each trial (see Materials and methods). We used generalized additive models to infer the time course of all cell culture replicates and construct the multi-trial dataset to which we eventually fit our mechanistic transmission model for each cell line-virus-specific combination (Figure 1; Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20135).\n\nAll three recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSV-G, rVSV-EBOV, and rVSV-MARV) infected Vero, RoNi/7.1, and PaKiT01 tissue cultures at both focal MOIs. Post-invasion, virus spread rapidly across most cell monolayers, resulting in virus-induced epidemic extinction. Epidemics were less severe in bat cell cultures, especially when infected with the recombinant filoviruses, rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV. Monolayer destruction was avoided in the case of rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells: in the former, persistent viral infection was maintained throughout the 200 hr duration of each experiment, while, in the latter, infection was eliminated early in the time series, preserving a large proportion of live, uninfectious cells across the duration of the experiment. We assumed this pattern to be the result of immune-mediated epidemic extinction (Figure 1). Patterns from MOI = 0.001 were largely recapitulated at MOI = 0.0001, though at somewhat reduced total proportions (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5).\n\nWe next developed a within-host model to fit to these data to elucidate the effects of induced and constitutive immunity on the dynamics of viral spread in host tissue (Figure 1). The compartmental within-host system mimicked our two-dimensional cell culture monolayer, with cells occupying five distinct infection states: susceptible (S), antiviral (A), exposed (E), infectious (I), and dead (D). We modeled exposed cells as infected but not yet infectious, capturing the \u2018eclipse phase\u2019 of viral integration into a host cell which precedes viral replication. Antiviral cells were immune to viral infection, in accordance with the 'antiviral state' induced from interferon stimulation of ISGs in tissues adjacent to infection (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006). Because we aimed to translate available data into modeled processes, we did not explicitly model interferon dynamics but instead scaled the rate of cell progression from susceptible to antiviral (\u03c1) by the proportion of exposed cells (globally) in the system. In systems permitting constitutive immunity, a second rate of cellular acquisition of antiviral status (\u03b5) additionally scaled with the global proportion of susceptible cells in the model. Compared with virus, IFN particles are small and highly diffusive, justifying this global signaling assumption at the limited spatial extent of a six-well plate and maintaining consistency with previous modeling approximations of IFN signaling in plaque assay (Howat et al., 2006).\n\nTo best represent our empirical monolayer system, we expressed our state variables as proportions (PS, PA, PE, PI, and PD), under assumptions of frequency-dependent transmission in a well-mixed population (Keeling and Rohani, 2008), though note that the inclusion of PD (representing the proportion of dead space in the modeled tissue) had the functional effect of varying transmission with infectious cell density. This resulted in the following system of ordinary differential equations:(1)dPSdt=bPD(PS+ PA)\u2212\u03b2PSPI\u2212\u03bcPS\u2212\u03c1PEPS\u2212 \u03b5PS+cPA(2)dPAdt=\u03c1PEPS+ \u03b5PS\u2212cPA\u2212\u03bcPA(3)dPEdt=\u03b2PSPI-\u03c3PE-\u03bcPE(4)dPIdt=\u03c3PE-\u03b1PI-\u03bcPI(5)dPDdt=\u03bc(PS+PE+ PI+ PA)+\u03b1PI\u2212bPD(PS+ PA)\n\nWe defined 'induced immunity' as complete, modeling all cells as susceptible to viral invasion at disease-free equilibrium, with defenses induced subsequent to viral exposure through the term \u03c1. By contrast, we allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the parameter range of \u03b5 > 0, defining a 'constitutive' system as one containing any antiviral cells at disease-free equilibrium. In fitting this model to tissue culture data, we independently estimated both \u03c1 and \u03b5, as well as the cell-to-cell transmission rate, \u03b2, for each cell-virus combination. Since the extent to which constitutively-expressed IFN-\u03b1 is constitutively translated into functional protein is not yet known for bat hosts (Zhou et al., 2016), this approach permitted our tissue culture data to drive modeling inference: even in PaKiT01 cell lines known to constitutively express IFN-\u03b1, the true constitutive extent of the system (i.e. the quantity of antiviral cells present at disease-free equilibrium) was allowed to vary through estimation of \u03b5. For the purposes of model-fitting, we fixed the value of c, the return rate of antiviral cells to susceptible status, at 0. The small spatial scale and short time course (max 200 hours) of our experiments likely prohibited any return of antiviral cells to susceptible status in our empirical system; nonetheless, we retained the term c in analytical evaluations of our model because regression from antiviral to susceptible status is possible over long time periods in vitro and at the scale of a complete organism (Radke et al., 1974; Rasmussen and Farley, 1975; Samuel and Knutson, 1982).\n\nBefore fitting to empirical time series, we undertook bifurcation analysis of our theoretical model and generated testable hypotheses on the basis of model outcomes. From our within-host model system (Equation 1-5), we derived the following expression for R0, the pathogen basic reproduction number (Supplementary file 2):(6)R0=\u03b2\u03c3(b-\u03bc)(c+\u03bc)b\u03c3+\u03bc\u03b1+\u03bcc+\u03bc+\u03b5\n\nPathogens can invade a host tissue culture when R0>1. Rapid rates of constitutive antiviral acquisition (\u03b5) will drive R0<1: tissue cultures with highly constitutive antiviral immunity will be therefore resistant to virus invasion from the outset. Since, by definition, induced immunity is stimulated following initial virus invasion, the rate of induced antiviral acquisition (\u03c1) is not incorporated into the equation for R0; while induced immune processes can control virus after initial invasion, they cannot prevent it from occurring to begin with. In cases of fully induced or absent immunity (\u03b5=0), the R0 equation thus reduces to a form typical of the classic SEIR model:(7)R0=\u03b2\u03c3b-\u03bcb\u03b1+\u03bc\u03c3+\u03bc\n\nAt equilibrium, the theoretical, mean field model demonstrates one of three infection states: endemic equilibrium, stable limit cycles, or no infection (Figure 2). Respectively, these states approximate the persistent infection, virus-induced epidemic extinction, and immune-mediated epidemic extinction phenotypes previously witnessed in tissue culture experiments (Figure 1). Theoretically, endemic equilibrium is maintained when new infections are generated at the same rate at which infections are lost, while limit cycles represent parameter space under which infectious and susceptible populations are locked in predictable oscillations. Endemic equilibria resulting from cellular regeneration (i.e. births) have been described in vivo for HIV (Coffin, 1995) and in vitro for herpesvirus plaque assays (Howat et al., 2006), but, because they so closely approach zero, true limit cycles likely only occur theoretically, instead yielding stochastic extinctions in empirical time series.\n\nBifurcation analysis of our mean field model revealed that regions of no infection (pathogen extinction) were bounded at lower threshold (Branch point) values for \u03b2, below which the pathogen was unable to invade. We found no upper threshold to invasion for \u03b2 under any circumstances (i.e. \u03b2 high enough to drive pathogen-induced extinction), but high \u03b2 values resulted in Hopf bifurcations, which delineate regions of parameter space characterized by limit cycles. Since limit cycles so closely approach zero, high \u03b2s recovered in this range would likely produce virus-induced epidemic extinctions under experimental conditions. Under more robust representations of immunity, with higher values for either or both induced (\u03c1) and constitutive (\u03b5) rates of antiviral acquisition, Hopf bifurcations occurred at increasingly higher values for \u03b2, meaning that persistent infections could establish at higher viral transmission rates (Figure 2). Consistent with our derivation for R0, we found that the Branch point threshold for viral invasion was independent of changes to the induced immune parameter (\u03c1) but saturated at high values of \u03b5 that characterize highly constitutive immunity (Figure 3).\n\nWe next fit our theoretical model by least squares to each cell line-virus combination, under absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions of immunity. In general, best fit models recapitulated expected outcomes based on the immune phenotype of the cell line in question, as described in the general literature (Table 1; Supplementary file 4). The absent immune model offered the most accurate approximation of IFN-deficient Vero cell time series, the induced immune model best recovered the RoNi/7.1 cell trials, and, in most cases, the constitutive immune model most closely recaptured infection dynamics across constitutively IFN-\u03b1-expressing PaKiT01 cell lines (Figure 1, Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 4\u20135, Supplementary file 4). Ironically, the induced immune model offered a slightly better fit than the constitutive to rVSV-MARV infections on the PaKiT01 cell line (the one cell line-virus combination for which we know a constitutively antiviral cell-receptor incompatibility to be at play). Because constitutive immune assumptions can prohibit pathogen invasion (R0<1), model fits to this time series under constitutive assumptions were handicapped by overestimations of \u03b5, which prohibited pathogen invasion. Only by incorporating an exceedingly rapid rate of induced antiviral acquisition could the model guarantee that initial infection would be permitted and then rapidly controlled.\n\nIn fitting our theoretical model to in vitro data, we estimated the within-host virus transmission rate (\u03b2) and the rate(s) of cellular acquisition to antiviral status (\u03c1 or \u03c1 + \u03b5) (Table 1; Supplementary file 4). Under absent immune assumptions, \u03c1 and \u03b5 were fixed at 0 while \u03b2 was estimated; under induced immune assumptions, \u03b5 was fixed at 0 while \u03c1 and \u03b2 were estimated; and under constitutive immune assumptions, all three parameters (\u03c1, \u03b5, and \u03b2) were simultaneously estimated for each cell-virus combination. Best fit parameter estimates for MOI=0.001 data are visualized in conjunction with \u03b2 \u2013 \u03c1 and \u03b2 \u2013 \u03b5 bifurcations in Figure 4; all general patterns were recapitulated at lower values for \u03b2 on MOI=0.0001 trials (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1).\n\nAs anticipated, the immune absent model (a simple target cell model) offered the best fit to IFN-deficient Vero cell infections (Figure 4; Table 1; Supplementary file 4). Among Vero cell trials, infections with rVSV-G produced the highest \u03b2 estimates, followed by infections with rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV. Best fit parameter estimates on Vero cell lines localized in the region of parameter space corresponding to theoretical limit cycles, consistent with observed virus-induced epidemic extinctions in stochastic tissue cultures.\n\nIn contrast to Vero cells, the induced immunity model offered the best fit to all RoNi/7.1 data, consistent with reported patterns in the literature and our own validation by qPCR (Table 1; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6; Arnold et al., 2018; Kuzmin et al., 2017; Biesold et al., 2011; Pavlovich et al., 2018). As in Vero cell trials, we estimated highest \u03b2 values for rVSV-G infections on RoNi/7.1 cell lines but here recovered higher \u03b2 estimates for rVSV-MARV than for rVSV-EBOV. This reversal was balanced by a higher estimated rate of acquisition to antiviral status (\u03c1) for rVSV-EBOV versus rVSV-MARV. In general, we observed that more rapid rates of antiviral acquisition (either induced, \u03c1, constitutive, \u03b5, or both) correlated with higher transmission rates (\u03b2). When offset by \u03c1, \u03b2 values estimated for RoNi/7.1 infections maintained the same amplitude as those estimated for immune-absent Vero cell lines but caused gentler epidemics and reduced cellular mortality (Figure 1). RoNi/7.1 parameter estimates localized in the region corresponding to endemic equilibrium for the deterministic, theoretical model (Figure 4), yielding less acute epidemics which nonetheless went extinct in stochastic experiments.\n\nFinally, rVSV-G and rVSV-EBOV trials on PaKiT01 cells were best fit by models assuming constitutive immunity, while rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 were matched equivalently by models assuming either induced or constitutive immunity\u2014with induced models favored over constitutive in AIC comparisons because one fewer parameter was estimated (Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 4\u20135; Supplementary file 4). For all virus infections, PaKiT01 cell lines yielded \u03b2 estimates a full order of magnitude higher than Vero or RoNi/7.1 cells, with each \u03b2 balanced by an immune response (either \u03c1, or \u03c1 combined with \u03b5) also an order of magnitude higher than that recovered for the other cell lines (Figure 4; Table 1). As in RoNi/7.1 cells, PaKiT01 parameter fits localized in the region corresponding to endemic equilibrium for the deterministic theoretical model. Because constitutive immune processes can actually prohibit initial pathogen invasion, constitutive immune fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cell lines consistently localized at or below the Branch point threshold for virus invasion (R0=1). During model fitting for optimization of \u03b5, any parameter tests of \u03b5 values producing R0<1 resulted in no infection and, consequently, produced an exceedingly poor fit to infectious time series data. In all model fits assuming constitutive immunity, across all cell lines, parameter estimates for \u03c1 and \u03b5 traded off, with one parameter optimized at values approximating zero, such that the immune response was modeled as almost entirely induced or entirely constitutive (Table 1; Supplementary file 4). For RoNi/7.1 cells, even when constitutive immunity was allowed, the immune response was estimated as almost entirely induced, while for rVSV-G and rVSV-EBOV fits on PaKiT01 cells, the immune response optimized as almost entirely constitutive. For rVSV-MARV on PaKiT01 cells, however, estimation of \u03c1 was high under all assumptions, such that any additional antiviral contributions from \u03b5 prohibited virus from invading at all. The induced immune model thus produced a more parsimonious recapitulation of these data because virus invasion was always permitted, then rapidly controlled.\n\nIn order to compare the relative contributions of each cell line\u2019s disparate immune processes to epidemic dynamics, we next used our mean field parameter estimates to calculate the initial \u2018antiviral rate\u2019\u2014the initial accumulation rate of antiviral cells upon virus invasion for each cell-virus-MOI combination\u2014based on the following equation:(8)AntiviralRate=\u03c1PEPs\u2212\u03f5Pswhere PE was calculated from the initial infectious dose (MOI) of each infection experiment and PS was estimated at disease-free equilibrium:(9)PE=1-e-MOI(10)PS=(b-\u03bc)(c+\u03bc)b(c+\u03bc+\u03b5)\n\nBecause \u03c1 and \u03b5 both contribute to this initial antiviral rate, induced and constitutive immune assumptions are capable of yielding equally rapid rates, depending on parameter fits. Indeed, under fully induced immune assumptions, the induced antiviral acquisition rate (\u03c1) estimated for rVSV-MARV infection on PaKiT01 cells was so high that the initial antiviral rate exceeded even that estimated under constitutive assumptions for this cell-virus combination (Supplementary file 4). In reality, we know that NPC1 receptor incompatibilities make PaKiT01 cell lines constitutively refractory to rVSV-MARV infection (Ng and Chandrab, 2018, Unpublished results) and that PaKiT01 cells also constitutively express the antiviral cytokine, IFN-\u03b1. Model fitting results suggest that this constitutive expression of IFN-\u03b1 may act more as a rapidly inducible immune response following virus invasion than as a constitutive secretion of functional IFN-\u03b1 protein. Nonetheless, as hypothesized, PaKiT01 cell lines were by far the most antiviral of any in our study\u2014with initial antiviral rates estimated several orders of magnitude higher than any others in our study, under either induced or constitutive assumptions (Table 1; Supplementary file 4). RoNi/7.1 cells displayed the second-most-pronounced signature of immunity, followed by Vero cells, for which the initial antiviral rate was essentially zero even under forced assumptions of induced or constitutive immunity (Table 1; Supplementary file 4).\n\nUsing fitted parameters for \u03b2 and \u03b5, we additionally calculated R0, the basic reproduction number for the virus, for each cell line-virus-MOI combination (Table 1; Supplementary file 4). We found that R0 was essentially unchanged across differing immune assumptions for RoNi/7.1 and Vero cells, for which the initial antiviral rate was low. In the case of PaKiT01 cells, a high initial antiviral rate under either induced or constitutive immunity resulted in a correspondingly high estimation of \u03b2 (and, consequently, R0) which still produced the same epidemic curve that resulted from the much lower estimates for \u03b2 and R0 paired with absent immunity. These findings suggest that antiviral immune responses protect host tissues against virus-induced cell mortality and may facilitate the establishment of more rapid within-host transmission rates.\n\nTotal monolayer destruction occurred in all cell-virus combinations excepting rVSV-EBOV infections on RoNi/7.1 cells and rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells. Monolayer destruction corresponded to susceptible cell depletion and epidemic turnover where R-effective (the product of R0 and the proportion susceptible) was reduced below one (Figure 5). For rVSV-EBOV infections on RoNi/7.1, induced antiviral cells safeguarded remnant live cells, which birthed new susceptible cells late in the time series. In rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells, this antiviral protection halted the epidemic (Figure 5; R-effective <1) before susceptibles fully declined. In the case of rVSV-EBOV on PaKiT01, the birth of new susceptibles from remnant live cells protected by antiviral status maintained late-stage transmission to facilitate long-term epidemic persistence. Importantly, under fixed parameter values for the infection incubation rate (\u03c3) and infection-induced mortality rate (\u03b1), models were unable to reproduce the longer-term infectious time series captured in data from rVSV-EBOV infections on PaKiT01 cell lines without incorporation of cell births, an assumption adopted in previous modeling representations of IFN-mediated viral dynamics in tissue culture (Howat et al., 2006). In our experiments, we observed that cellular reproduction took place as plaque assays achieved confluency.\n\nFinally, because the protective effect of antiviral cells is more clearly observable spatially, we confirmed our results by simulating fitted time series in a spatially-explicit, stochastic reconstruction of our mean field model. In spatial simulations, rates of antiviral acquisition were fixed at fitted values for \u03c1 and \u03b5 derived from mean field estimates, while transmission rates (\u03b2) were fixed at values ten times greater than those estimated under mean field conditions, accounting for the intensification of parameter thresholds permitting pathogen invasion in local spatial interactions (see Materials and methods; Videos 1\u20133; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3; Supplementary file 5; Webb et al., 2007). In immune capable time series, spatial antiviral cells acted as \u2018refugia\u2019 which protected live cells from infection as each initial epidemic wave \u2018washed\u2019 across a cell monolayer. Eventual birth of new susceptibles from these living refugia allowed for sustained epidemic transmission in cases where some infectious cells persisted at later timepoints in simulation (Videos 1\u20133; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3).\n\nBats are reservoirs for several important emerging zoonoses but appear not to experience disease from otherwise virulent viral pathogens. Though the molecular biological literature has made great progress in elucidating the mechanisms by which bats tolerate viral infections (Zhou et al., 2016; Ahn et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2018; Pavlovich et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2013), the impact of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics within-host has not been well-elucidated. We used an innovative combination of in vitro experimentation and within-host modeling to explore the impact of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics. Critically, we found that bat cell lines demonstrated a signature of enhanced interferon-mediated immune response, of either constitutive or induced form, which allowed for establishment of rapid within-host, cell-to-cell virus transmission rates (\u03b2). These results were supported by both data-independent bifurcation analysis of our mean field theoretical model, as well as fitting of this model to viral infection time series established in bat cell culture. Additionally, we demonstrated that the antiviral state induced by the interferon pathway protects live cells from mortality in tissue culture, resulting in in vitro epidemics of extended duration that enhance the probability of establishing a long-term persistent infection. Our findings suggest that viruses evolved in bat reservoirs possessing enhanced IFN capabilities could achieve more rapid within-host transmission rates without causing pathology to their hosts. Such rapidly-reproducing viruses would likely generate extreme virulence upon spillover to hosts lacking similar immune capacities to bats.\n\nTo achieve these results, we first developed a novel, within-host, theoretical model elucidating the effects of unique bat immunity, then undertook bifurcation analysis of the model\u2019s equilibrium properties under immune absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions. We considered a cell line to be constitutively immune if possessing any number of antiviral cells at disease-free equilibrium but allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the parameter range for \u03b5, the constitutive rate of antiviral acquisition. In deriving the equation for \u03b5, the basic reproduction number, which defines threshold conditions for virus invasion of a tissue (R0>1), we demonstrated how the invasion threshold is elevated at high values of constitutive antiviral acquisition, \u03b5. Constitutive immune processes can thus prohibit pathogen invasion, while induced responses, by definition, can only control infections post-hoc. Once thresholds for pathogen invasion have been met, assumptions of constitutive immunity will limit the cellular mortality (virulence) incurred at high transmission rates. Regardless of mechanism (induced or constitutive), interferon-stimulated antiviral cells appear to play a key role in maintaining longer term or persistent infections by safeguarding susceptible cells from rapid infection and concomitant cell death.\n\nFitting of our model to in vitro data supported expected immune phenotypes for different bat cell lines as described in the literature. Simple target cell models that ignore the effects of immunity best recapitulated infectious time series derived from IFN-deficient Vero cells, while models assuming induced immune processes most accurately reproduced trials derived from RoNi/7.1 (Rousettus aegyptiacus) cells, which possess a standard virus-induced IFN-response. In most cases, models assuming constitutive immune processes best recreated virus epidemics produced on PaKiT01 (Pteropus alecto) cells, which are known to constitutively express the antiviral cytokine, IFN-\u03b1 (Zhou et al., 2016). Model support for induced immune assumptions in fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells suggests that the constitutive IFN-\u03b1 expression characteristic of P. alecto cells may represent more of a constitutive immune priming process than a perpetual, functional, antiviral defense. Results from mean field model fitting were additionally confirmed in spatially explicit stochastic simulations of each time series.\n\nAs previously demonstrated in within-host models for HIV (Coffin, 1995; Perelson et al., 1996; Nowak et al., 1995; Bonhoeffer et al., 1997; Ho et al., 1995), assumptions of simple target-cell depletion can often provide satisfactory approximations of viral dynamics, especially those reproduced in simple in vitro systems. Critically, our model fitting emphasizes the need for incorporation of top-down effects of immune control in order to accurately reproduce infectious time series derived from bat cell tissue cultures, especially those resulting from the robustly antiviral PaKiT01 P. alecto cell line. These findings indicate that enhanced IFN-mediated immune pathways in bat reservoirs may promote elevated within-host virus replication rates prior to cross-species emergence. We nonetheless acknowledge the limitations imposed by in vitro experiments in tissue culture, especially involving recombinant viruses and immortalized cell lines. Future work should extend these cell culture studies to include measurements of multiple state variables (i.e. antiviral cells) to enhance epidemiological inference.\n\nThe continued recurrence of Ebola epidemics across central Africa highlights the importance of understanding bats\u2019 roles as reservoirs for virulent zoonotic disease. The past decade has born witness to emerging consensus regarding the unique pathways by which bats resist and tolerate highly virulent infections (Brook and Dobson, 2015; Xie et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2013; Ahn et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2016; Ng et al., 2015; Pavlovich et al., 2018). Nonetheless, an understanding of the mechanisms by which bats support endemic pathogens at the population level, or promote the evolution of virulent pathogens at the individual level, remains elusive. Endemic maintenance of infection is a defining characteristic of a pathogen reservoir (Haydon et al., 2002), and bats appear to merit such a title, supporting long-term persistence of highly transmissible viral infections in isolated island populations well below expected critical community sizes (Peel et al., 2012). Researchers debate the relative influence of population-level and within-host mechanisms which might explain these trends (Plowright et al., 2016), but increasingly, field data are difficult to reconcile without acknowledgement of a role for persistent infections (Peel et al., 2018; Brook et al., 2019). We present general methods to study cross-scale viral dynamics, which suggest that within-host persistence is supported by robust antiviral responses characteristic of bat immune processes. Viruses which evolve rapid replication rates under these robust antiviral defenses may pose the greatest hazard for cross-species pathogen emergence into spillover hosts with immune systems that differ from those unique to bats.\n\nAll experiments were carried out on three immortalized mammalian kidney cell lines: Vero (African green monkey), RoNi/7.1 (Rousettus aegyptiacus) (K\u00fchl et al., 2011; Biesold et al., 2011) and PaKiT01 (Pteropus alecto) (Crameri et al., 2009). The species identifications of all bat cell lines was confirmed morphologically and genetically in the publications in which they were originally described (K\u00fchl et al., 2011; Biesold et al., 2011; Crameri et al., 2009). \ufeffVero cells were obtained from ATCC.\n\nMonolayers of each cell line were grown to 90% confluency (~9\u00d7105 cells) in 6-well plates. Cells were maintained in a humidified 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini Bio Products, West Sacramento, CA), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies). Cells were tested monthly for mycoplasma contamination while experiments were taking place; all cells assayed negative for contamination at every testing.\n\nPrevious work has demonstrated that all cell lines used are capable of mounting a type I IFN response upon viral challenge, with the exception of Vero cells, which possess an IFN-\u03b2 deficiency (Desmyter et al., 1968; Rhim et al., 1969; Emeny and Morgan, 1979). RoNi/7.1 cells have been shown to mount idiosyncratic induced IFN defenses upon viral infection (Pavlovich et al., 2018; Kuzmin et al., 2017; Arnold et al., 2018; K\u00fchl et al., 2011; Biesold et al., 2011), while PaKiT01 cells are known to constitutively express the antiviral cytokine, IFN-\u03b1 (Zhou et al., 2016). This work is the first documentation of IFN signaling induced upon challenge with the particular recombinant VSVs outlined below. We verified known antiviral immune phenotypes via qPCR. Results were consistent with the literature, indicating a less pronounced role for interferon defense against viral infection in RoNi/7.1 versus PaKiT01 cells.\n\nReplication-capable recombinant vesicular stomatitis Indiana viruses, expressing filovirus glycoproteins in place of wild type G (rVSV-G, rVSV-EBOV, and rVSV-MARV) have been previously described (Wong et al., 2010; Miller et al., 2012). Viruses were selected to represent a broad range of anticipated antiviral responses from host cells, based on a range of past evolutionary histories between the virus glycoprotein mediating cell entry and the host cell\u2019s entry receptor. These interactions ranged from the total absence of evolutionary history in the case of rVSV-G infections on all cell lines to a known receptor-level cell entry incompatibility in the case of rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cell lines.\n\nTo measure infectivities of rVSVs on each of the cell lines outlined above, so as to calculate the correct viral dose for each MOI, NH4Cl (20 mM) was added to infected cell cultures at 1\u20132 hr post-infection to block viral spread, and individual eGFP-positive cells were manually counted at 12\u201314 hr post-infection.\n\nPreviously published work indicates that immortalized kidney cell lines of Rousettus aegyptiacus (RoNi/7.1) and Pteropus alecto (PaKiT01) exhibit different innate antiviral immune phenotypes through, respectively, induced (Biesold et al., 2011; Pavlovich et al., 2018; K\u00fchl et al., 2011; Arnold et al., 2018) and constitutive (Zhou et al., 2016) expression of type I interferon genes. We verified these published phenotypes on our own cell lines infected with rVSV-G, rVSV-EBOV, and rVSV-MARV via qPCR of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 genes across a longitudinal time series of infection.\n\nSpecifically, we carried out multiple time series of infection of each cell line with each of the viruses described above, under mock infection conditions and at MOIs of 0.0001 and 0.001\u2014with the exception of rVSV-MARV on PaKiT01 cell lines, for which infection was only performed at MOI = 0.0001 due to limited viral stocks and the extremely low infectivity of this virus on this cell line (thus requiring high viral loads for initial infection). All experiments were run in duplicate on 6-well plates, such that a typical plate for any of the three viruses had two control (mock) wells, two MOI = 0.0001 wells and two MOI = 0.001 wells, excepting PaKiT01 plates, which had two control and four MOI = 0.0001 wells at a given time. We justify this PaKiT01 exemption through the expectation that IFN-\u03b1 expression is constitutive for these cells, and by the assumption that any expression exhibited at the lower MOI should also be present at the higher MOI.\n\nFor these gene expression time series, four 6-well plates for each cell line\u2013virus combination were incubated with virus for one hour at 37 \u00b0C. Following incubation, virus was aspirated off, and cell monolayers were washed in PBS, then covered with an agar plaque assay overlay to mimic conditions under which infection trials were run. Plates were then harvested sequentially at timepoints of roughly 5, 10, 15, and 20 hr post-infection (exact timing varied as multiple trials were running simultaneously). Upon harvest of each plate, agar overlay was removed, and virus was lysed and RNA extracted from cells using the Zymo Quick RNA Mini Prep kit, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and including the step for cellular DNA digestion. Post-extraction, RNA quality was verified via nanodrop, and RNA was converted to cDNA using the Invitrogen Superscript III cDNA synthesis kit, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA was then stored at 4 \u00b0C and as a frozen stock at \u221220 \u00b0C to await qPCR.\n\nWe undertook qPCR of cDNA to assess expression of the type I interferon genes, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, and the housekeeping gene, \u03b2-Actin, using primers previously reported in the literature (Supplementary file 6). For qPCR, 2 \u00b5l of each cDNA sample was incubated with 7 \u00b5l of deionized water, 1 \u00b5l of 5 UM forward/reverse primer mix and 10 \u00b5l of iTaq Universal SYBR Green, then cycled on a QuantStudio3 Real-Time PCR machine under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C (5 s), annealing at 58 \u00b0C (15 s), and extension at 72 \u00b0C (10 s).\n\nWe report simple \u03b4-Ct values for each run, with raw Ct of the target gene of interest (IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2) subtracted from raw Ct of the \u03b2-Actin housekeeping gene in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6. Calculation of fold change upon viral infection in comparison to mock using the \u03b4-\u03b4-Ct method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) was inappropriate in this case, as we wished to demonstrate constitutive expression of IFN-\u03b1 in PaKiT01 cells, whereby data from mock cells was identical to that produced from infected cells.\n\nAfter being grown to ~90% confluency, cells were incubated with pelleted rVSVs expressing eGFP (rVSV-G, rVSV-EBOV, rVSV-MARV). Cell lines were challenged with both a low (0.0001) and high (0.001) multiplicity of infection (MOI) for each virus. In a cell monolayer infected at a given MOI (m), the proportion of cells (P), infected by k viral particles can be described by the Poisson distribution: R0, such that the number of initially infected cells in an experiment equals: R0>1. We assumed that a ~90% confluent culture at each trial\u2019s origin was comprised of ~9x105 cells and conducted all experiments at MOIs of 0.0001 and 0.001, meaning that we began each trial by introducing virus to, respectively, ~81 or 810 cells, representing the state variable \u2018E\u2019 in our theoretical model. Low MOIs were selected to best approximate the dynamics of mean field infection and limit artifacts of spatial structuring, such as premature epidemic extinction when growing plaques collide with plate walls in cell culture.\n\nSix-well plates were prepared with each infection in duplicate or triplicate, such that a control well (no virus) and 2\u20133 wells each at MOI 0.001 and 0.0001 were incubated simultaneously on the same plate. In total, we ran between 18 and 39 trials at each cell-virus-MOI combination, excepting r-VSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells at MOI = 0.001, for which we ran only eight trials due to the low infectivity of this virus on this cell line, which required high viral loads for initial infection. Cells were incubated with virus for one hour at 37 \u00b0C. Following incubation, virus was aspirated off, and cell monolayers were washed in PBS, then covered with a molten viscous overlay (50% 2X MEM/L-glutamine; 5% FBS; 3% HEPES; 42% agarose), cooled for 20 min, and re-incubated in their original humidified 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 environment.\n\nAfter application of the overlay, plates were monitored periodically using an inverted fluorescence microscope until the first signs of GFP expression were witnessed (~6\u20139.5 hr post-infection, depending on the cell line and virus under investigation). From that time forward, a square subset of the center of each well (comprised of either 64- or 36-subframes and corresponding to roughly 60% and 40% of the entire well space) was imaged periodically, using a CellInsight CX5 High Content Screening (HCS) Platform with a 4X air objective (ThermoFisher, Inc, Waltham, MA). Microscope settings were held standard across all trials, with exposure time fixed at 0.0006 s for each image. One color channel was imaged, such that images produced show GFP-expressing cells in white and non-GFP-expressing cells in black (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1).\n\nWells were photographed in rotation, as frequently as possible, from the onset of GFP expression until the time that the majority of cells in the well were surmised to be dead, GFP expression could no longer be detected, or early termination was desired to permit Hoechst staining.\n\nIn the case of PaKiT01 cells infected with rVSV-EBOV, where an apparently persistent infection established, the assay was terminated after 200+ hours (8+ days) of continuous observation. Upon termination of all trials, cells were fixed in formaldehyde (4% for 15 min), incubated with Hoechst stain (0.0005% for 15 min) (ThermoFisher, Inc, Waltham, MA), then imaged at 4X on the CellInsight CX5 High Content Screening (HCS) Platform. The machine was allowed to find optimal focus for each Hoechst stain image. One color channel was permitted such that images produced showed live nuclei in white and dead cells in black.\n\nHoechst stain colors cellular DNA, and viral infection is thought to interfere with the clarity of the stain (Dembowski and DeLuca, 2015). As such, infection termination, cell fixation, and Hoechst staining enables generation of a rough time series of uninfectious live cells (i.e. susceptible + antiviral cells) to complement the images which produced time series of proportions infectious. Due to uncertainty over the exact epidemic state of Hoechst-stained cells (i.e. exposed but not yet infectious cells may still stain), we elected to fit our models only to the infectious time series derived from GFP-expressing images and used Hoechst stain images as a post hoc visual check on our fit only (Figure 5; Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1\u20132).\n\nImages recovered from the time series above were processed into binary (\u2018infectious\u2019 vs. \u2018non-infectious\u2019 or, for Hoechst-stained images, \u2018live\u2019 vs. \u2018dead\u2019) form using the EBImage package (Pau et al., 2010) in R version 3.6 for MacIntosh, after methods further detailed in Supplementary file 7. Binary images were then further processed into time series of infectious or, for Hoechst-stained images, live cells using a series of cell counting scripts. Because of logistical constraints (i.e. many plates of simultaneously running infection trials and only one available imaging microscope), the time course of imaging across the duration of each trial was quite variable. As such, we fitted a series of statistical models to our processed image data to reconstruct reliable values of the infectious proportion of each well per hour for each distinct trial in all cell line\u2013virus-MOI combinations (Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2\u20133), as well as for declining live cell counts from control well data derived from the Hoestch time series (Supplementary file 1; Supplementary file 7; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7). All original and processed images, image processing and counting code, and resulting time series data are freely available for download at the following FigShare repository: DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.8312807.\n\nTo derive the expression for R0, the basic pathogen reproductive number in vitro, we used Next Generation Matrix (NGM) techniques (Diekmann et al., 1990; Heffernan et al., 2005), employing Wolfram Mathematica (version 11.2) as an analytical tool. R0 describes the number of new infections generated by an existing infection in a completely susceptible host population; a pathogen will invade a population when R0>1 (Supplementary file 2). We then analyzed stability properties of the system, exploring dynamics across a range of parameter spaces, using MatCont (version 2.2) (Dhooge et al., 2008) for Matlab (version R2018a) (Supplementary file 3).\n\nThe birth rate, b, and natural mortality rate, \u03bc, balance to yield a population-level growth rate, such that it is impossible to estimate both b and \u03bc simultaneously from total population size data alone. As such, we fixed b at. 025 and estimated \u03bc by fitting an infection-absent version of our mean field model to the susceptible time series derived via Hoechst staining of control wells for each of the three cell lines (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7). This yielded a natural mortality rate, \u03bc, corresponding to a lifespan of approximately 121, 191, and 84 hours, respectively, for Vero, RoNi/7.1, and PaKiT01 cell lines (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7). We then fixed the virus incubation rate, \u03c3, as the inverse of the shortest observed duration of time from initial infection to the observation of the first infectious cells via fluorescent microscope for all nine cell line \u2013 virus combinations (ranging 6 to 9.5 hours). We fixed \u03b1, the infection-induced mortality rate, at 1/6, an accepted standard for general viral kinetics (Howat et al., 2006), and held c, the rate of antiviral cell regression to susceptible status, at 0 for the timespan (<200 hours) of the experimental cell line infection trials.\n\nWe estimated cell line\u2013virus-MOI-specific values for \u03b2, \u03c1, and \u03b5 by fitting the deterministic output of infectious proportions in our mean field model to the full suite of statistical outputs of all trials for each infected cell culture time series (Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2\u20133). Fitting was performed by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the deterministic model output and cell line\u2013virus-MOI-specific infectious proportion of the data at each timestep. We optimized parameters for MOI = 0.001 and 0.0001 simultaneously to leverage statistical power across the two datasets, estimating a different transmission rate, \u03b2, for trials run at each infectious dose but, where applicable, estimating the same rates of \u03c1 and \u03b5 across the two time series. We used the differential equation solver lsoda() in the R package deSolve (Soetaert et al., 2010) to obtain numerical solutions for the mean field model and carried out minimization using the \u2018Nelder-Mead\u2019 algorithm of the optim() function in base R. All model fits were conducted using consistent starting guesses for the parameters, \u03b2 (\u03b2 = 3), and where applicable, \u03c1 (\u03c1 = 0.001) and \u03b5 (\u03b5 = 0.001). In the case of failed fits or indefinite hessians, we generated a series of random guesses around the starting conditions and continued estimation until successful fits were achieved.\n\nAll eighteen cell line\u2013virus-MOI combinations of data were fit by an immune absent (\u03b5 = \u03c1 = 0) version of the theoretical model and, subsequently, an induced immunity (\u03b5 = 0; \u03c1 >0) and constitutive immunity (\u03b5 >0; \u03c1 >0) version of the model. Finally, we compared fits across each cell line\u2013virus-MOI combination via AIC. In calculating AIC, the number of fitted parameters in each model (k) varied across the immune phenotypes, with one parameter (\u03b2) estimated for absent immune assumptions, two (\u03b2 and \u03c1) for induced immune assumptions, and three (\u03b2, \u03c1, and \u03b5) for constitutive immune assumptions. The sample size (n) corresponded to the number of discrete time steps across all empirical infectious trials to which the model was fitted for each cell-line virus combination. All fitting and model comparison scripts are freely available for download at the following FigShare repository: DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.8312807.\n\nFinally, we verified all mean field fits in a spatial context, in order to more thoroughly elucidate the role of antiviral cells in each time series. We constructed our spatial model in C++ implemented in R using the packages Rcpp and RcppArmadillo (Eddelbuettel and Francois, 2011; Eddelbuettel and Sanderson, 2017). Following Nagai and Honda (2001) and Howat et al. (2006), we modeled this system on a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, using a ten-minute epidemic timestep for cell state transitions. At the initialization of each simulation, we randomly assigned a duration of natural lifespan, incubation period, infectivity period, and time from antiviral to susceptible status to all cells in a theoretical monolayer. Parameter durations were drawn from a normal distribution centered at the inverse of the respective fixed rates of \u03bc, \u03c3, \u03b1, and c, as reported with our mean field model. Transitions involving the induced (\u03c1) and constitutive (\u03b5) rates of antiviral acquisition were governed probabilistically and adjusted dynamically at each timestep based on the global environment. As such, we fixed these parameters at the same values estimated in the mean field model, and multiplied both \u03c1 and \u03b5 by the global proportion of, respectively, exposed and susceptible cells at a given timestep.\n\nIn contrast to antiviral acquisition rates, transitions involving the birth rate (b) and the transmission rate (\u03b2) occurred probabilistically based on each cell\u2019s local environment. The birth rate, b, was multiplied by the proportion of susceptible cells within a six-neighbor circumference of a focal dead cell, while \u03b2 was multiplied by the proportion of infectious cells within a thirty-six neighbor vicinity of a focal susceptible cell, thus allowing viral transmission to extend beyond the immediate nearest-neighbor boundaries of an infectious cell. To compensate for higher thresholds to cellular persistence and virus invasion which occur under local spatial conditions (Webb et al., 2007), we increased the birth rate, b, and the cell-to-cell transmission rate, \u03b2, respectively, to six and ten times the values used in the mean field model (Supplementary file 4). We derived these increases based on the assumption that births took place exclusively based on pairwise nearest-neighbor interactions (the six immediately adjacent cells to a focal dead cell), while viral transmission was locally concentrated but included a small (7.5%) global contribution, representing the thirty-six cell surrounding vicinity of a focal susceptible. We justify these increases and derive their origins further in Supplementary file 5.\n\nWe simulated ten stochastic spatial time series for all cell-virus combinations under all three immune assumptions at a population size of 10,000 cells and compared model output with data in Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3. Spatial model code is available for public access at the following FigShare repository: DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.8312807."}
