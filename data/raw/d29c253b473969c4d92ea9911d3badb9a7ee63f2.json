{"title": "A nematode-specific gene underlies bleomycin-response variation in Caenorhabditis elegans 1 2", "body": "individual patients vary in their responses to bleomycin. The identification of genetic differences 48 that underlie this response variation could improve treatment outcomes by tailoring bleomycin 49 dosages to each patient. We used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genetic 50 determinants of bleomycin-response differences by performing linkage mapping on 51 recombinants derived from a cross between the laboratory strain (N2) and a wild strain 52 (CB4856). This approach identified a small genomic region on chromosome V that underlies 53 bleomycin-response variation. Using near-isogenic lines and strains with CRISPR-Cas9 54 mediated deletions and allele replacements, we discovered that a novel nematode-specific gene 55 (scb-1) is required for bleomycin resistance. Although the mechanism by which this gene causes 56 variation in bleomycin responses is unknown, we suggest that a rare variant present in the 57 CB4856 strain might cause differences in the potential stress-response function of scb-1 between 58 the N2 and CB4856 strains, thereby leading to differences in bleomycin resistance. 59 .

We used near-isogenic lines (NILs) 106 to validate the largest effect QTL on chromosome V. Our results from the NIL assays suggested 107 that epistatic loci underlie bleomycin responses, but a two-factor genome scan was unable to 108 detect significant genetic interactions. Next, we created and tested CRISPR-Cas9 mediated 109 deletion alleles to investigate all six candidate genes in the QTL region. We identified a 110 nematode-specific gene, H19N07.3, that underlies this QTL. Although this gene does not contain 111 a protein-coding variant between the N2 and CB4856 strains, its gene expression varies across 112 the RIAIL panel. Interestingly, a genome-wide association (GWA) approach identifies different 113 QTL than the linkage mapping approach, suggesting that both common and rare variants underlie 114 bleomycin response variation. Given the genetic complexity underlying the bleomycin response 115 phenotype, this study highlights the power of the C. elegans model system to identify elusive 116 causal genes. 117 118 MATERIALS AND METHODS 119 120 Strains: Animals were grown at 20\u00ba on 6 cm plates of modified nematode growth medium 121 (NGMA), which contained 1% agar and 0.7% agarose, spotted with OP50 bacteria (Ghosh et al. 122 2012). The two parental strains used in this study were N2 and CB4856. N2 is the canonical 123 laboratory strain of C. elegans that has been extensively studied (Brenner 1974) . CB4856 is a 124 well studied Hawaiian wild isolate that is genetically divergent from N2 and has a characterized 125 genome (Wicks et al. 2001; Swan et al. 2002 ; Thompson et al. 2015) .

Because bleomycin exposure can affect animal 150 proliferation (brood size), animal growth (length), and animal development (optical density), the 151 fitness parameters we measured with the BIOSORT included brood size (n), animal length (time 152 of flight, TOF), and optical density (extinction time, EXT). 153 154 Bleomycin-response trait measurements and processing: Phenotypic measurements collected 155 by the BIOSORT were processed using the R package easysorter (Shimko and Andersen 2014) . 156\n\nUsing this package, read_data imported measurements from the BIOSORT and 157 remove_contamination was used to remove contaminated wells from analysis. The sumplate 158 function then calculated normalized measurements (norm.n --brood size normalized to number 159 of animals sorted, norm.EXT --EXT normalized by TOF measurements) and summary statistics 160 (mean, median, 10 th, 25 th , 75 th , 90 th percentile, interquartile range, covariance, and variance) of 161 each trait for the population of animals. A total of 26 HTA traits were measured. When strains 162 were phenotyped across multiple days, the regress(assay=TRUE) function was used to fit a 163 linear model with the phenotype as the dependent variable and assay as the independent variable 164 (phenotype ~ assay) to account for variation among assay days. Next, the prune_outliers() 165 function removed phenotypic values that were beyond two standard deviations of the mean 166 (unless at least 5% of the strains were outside this range in the case of RIAIL assays were called). The genotypic data and residual phenotypic data (after control-condition 207 regression) were merged into a cross object using the merge_pheno function with set = 2 to 208 include strains with a reduced allele-frequency skew on chromosome I. The fsearch function was 209 used to calculate logarithm of odds (LOD) scores for each marker and each trait as The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We used the scantwo function in the R qtl package to perform this analysis. 243\n\nEach pairwise combination of loci was tested for correlations with trait variation in the RIAILs. 244\n\nThe summary of each scantwo output includes the maximum interactive LOD score for each pair 245 of chromosomes. To determine a threshold for significant interactions, we performed 1000 246 permutations of the scantwo analysis and selected the 95 th percentile from these permutations. 247\n\nFor the bleomycin-response variation scantwo, the significant interaction threshold was a LOD 248 score of 4.08. The significant interaction threshold for the scb-1 expression variation scantwo 249 was 4.05. The bleomycin-response variation scantwo summary is available as File S8, and the 250 scantwo summary for scb-1 expression variation is available as File S17. 251 252 Identification of genes with non-synonymous variants: The get_db function within the cegwas 253 R package was used to query WormBase build WS245 for genes in the QTL confidence interval 254 (V:11,042,745-11,189,364). Our initial linkage mappings used the 1,454 marker set (Rockman 255 and Kruglyak 2009) and had a QTL confidence interval larger than the interval found using the 256 whole-genome marker set (described above). Because this confidence interval was larger and 257 more conservative, we kept it for subsequent testing of candidate genes. This expanded interval 258 contained an additional 20 kb on either side of the whole-genome marker set confidence interval 259 (File S9). The snpeff function within the cegwas R package was used to identify variants within 260 the region of interest (File S11 . We performed linkage mapping as described above on these expression data and 315 identified significant peaks for 3,298 probes (File S13). For the H19N07.3 probe 316 (A_12_P104350), the full annotated-LOD data frame is provided (File S14). 317 318 Hemizygosity high-throughput assay: Hemizygosity assays were used to test the effect of zero 319 (two deletion alleles), one (one deletion allele and one wild-type allele), or two (two wild-type 320 alleles) functional copies of a gene product on bleomycin responses. If the phenotype is affected 321 by gene function, one would expect to see bleomycin responses scale with the number of 322 functional alleles of the gene present in each strain. For each heterozygous/hemizygous 323 genotype, 30 hermaphrodites and 60 males were placed onto each of four 6 cm plates and 324 allowed to mate for 48 hours. The same process was completed for homozygous strains to 325 remove biases introduced by the presence of male progeny in the assay. Mated hermaphrodites 326 were transferred to a clean 6 cm plate and allowed to lay embryos for eight hours. After the egg 327 lay period, adults were manually removed from egg lay plates, and embryos were washed into 15 328 mL conicals using M9 and a combination of pasteur pipette rinsing and scraping with plastic 329 inoculation loops. Embryos were rinsed and centrifuged four times with M9 before being 330 resuspended in K medium and 50 \u00b5M kanamycin. Embryos hatched and arrested in the L1 larval 331 stage in conicals overnight at 20\u00ba with shaking. The next morning, 50 L1 larvae were sorted into 332 .

Therefore, exposure to bleomycin can affect the development of C. 429 elegans larvae as well as germ-cell production of adult animals. We used a high-throughput 430 assay (HTA) to measure the effects of bleomycin on development and brood size (Figure S1 , 431 Materials and Methods). To determine the concentration of bleomycin that would maximize 432 among-strain while minimizing within-strain phenotypic variation, we used the HTA to perform 433 a dose-response assay. We assessed bleomycin responses for four divergent strains (N2, 434 CB4856, JU258, and DL238) across each of 26 HTA traits (File S1, Figure S2 ). Lee et al. 2017). We used these RIAILs to identify genetic variants that contribute to differential 449 bleomycin responses between the N2 and CB4856 strains. Using our HTA, we measured each of 450 the 26 fitness parameters for 249 RIAILs (Materials and Methods, File S3). Correlations 451 between each pairwise combination of the 26 HTA measurements revealed several clusters of 452 highly correlated traits ( Figure S3) . Therefore, the summary statistics measured by the 453 BIOSORT should not be considered independent traits for linkage mapping. We selected median 454 optical density (median.EXT) for future analyses, which is related to both animal length and 455 optical extinction, because this trait was highly correlated with many of the 26 HTA traits and 456 was highly heritable (H 2 = 0.73, File S2). 457 458\n\nWe performed linkage mapping on the residual median optical density measurements in 460 bleomycin ( Figure S4, Figure S5 , File S4, Materials and Methods) and identified four 461 significant quantitative trait loci (QTL, Figure 1A) . The QTL on the center of chromosome V 462 was highly significant (explained 43.58% of the total variation and 55.60% of the genetic 463 variation) with a LOD score of 32.57, and it was detected for 25 of the 26 HTA traits (Figure S5,  464 File S4). The QTL 95% confidence interval was approximately 147 kb. Strains with the N2 465 allele at the peak marker had a lower median optical density in bleomycin and were interpreted 466 to be more sensitive than those RIAILs with the CB4856 allele ( Figure 1B) .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/565218 doi: bioRxiv preprint 22 of 48 CB4856 strain and a region of chromosome V from the opposite parental genotype. We used the 471 HTA to test these strains in response to bleomycin (File S3). The NIL with the N2 genotype 472 across this QTL introgressed into the CB4856 background (ECA230) was statistically more 473 sensitive to bleomycin than CB4856 (Figure S6, File S7, p = 1.3e-14, Tukey HSD) . This 474 phenotype indicated that the N2 genotype within the introgressed region (which includes the 475 QTL confidence interval) confers sensitivity to bleomycin. However, the reciprocal NIL with the 476 CB4856 locus introgressed into the N2 background (ECA232) had a bleomycin-response 477 phenotype that was not significantly different from the N2 strain ( Figure S6 , File S7, p = 0.053, 478\n\nTukey HSD), suggesting that interacting loci could underlie bleomycin responses in a 479 background-dependent manner. We performed a two-factor genome scan to map potential 480 epistatic loci but did not identify a significant interaction between the QTL on chromosome V 481 and other loci (Figure S7, File S8) . However, the failure to detect significant interacting QTL 482 could be because we have too few recombinant strains or because too few replicates of each 483 RIAIL were phenotyped. Alternatively, more than two loci might underlie the transgressive 484 phenotype of ECA230 and a two-factor genome scan might not be able to capture this 485 complexity. 486 487 Nonetheless, because ECA230 recapitulated the expected QTL phenotype, we generated two 488 NILs (ECA411 and ECA528) that narrowed this introgressed region to more precisely locate the 489 causal variant (File S5, File S6 ). In addition, the N2 region on the left of chromosome V was 490 removed from both NIL strains to ensure that this region of introgression did not underlie the 491 phenotypic difference between ECA230 and CB4856. The genotypes of ECA411 and ECA528 492 differ in a small region of chromosome V that includes the QTL confidence interval (Figure 2 , 493 . CC-BY 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/565218 doi: bioRxiv preprint File S5, File S6). Both of these strains were more sensitive to bleomycin than the background 494 parental strain, CB4856. This result could suggest that the introgressed region shared between 495 these strains, which does not include the QTL, conferred some bleomycin-response variation 496 between the N2 and CB4856 strains (Figure 2) . Alternatively, the hypersensitivity of these NILs 497 could suggest the presence of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities between the N2 and CB4856 498 genotypes (Snoek et al. 2014 ) that might affect stress responses of the NILs. However, ECA528 499 was much more sensitive to bleomycin than ECA411 (Figure 2, File S7) . Because ECA528 has 500 the N2 genotype across the QTL region and ECA411 has the CB4856 genotype, these results 501 suggest that the QTL genotype strongly affects bleomycin sensitivity (Figure 2 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/565218 doi: bioRxiv preprint cnc-10, contain predicted non-synonymous variants between the N2 and CB4856 strains ( Figure  517 3A, File S10, File S11). These variants could cause differential bleomycin sensitivity between 518 the N2 and CB4856 strains. 519 520 To test these genes in bleomycin-response variation, we systematically deleted each of the 521 candidate genes in both the N2 and CB4856 backgrounds. We used CRISPR-Cas9 mediated 522 genome editing to generate two independent deletion alleles of each gene in each genetic 523 background to reduce the possibility that off-target mutations could cause phenotypic differences 524 (Materials and Methods, Supplemental Information). We tested the bleomycin response of each 525 deletion allele in comparison to the N2 and CB4856 parental strains ( Figure 3B, File S3) . The 526 deletion alleles of C45B11.8, C45B11.6, srg-42, and cnc-10 each had a bleomycin response 527 similar to the respective parent genetic background, which suggested that the functions of each 528 of these genes did not affect bleomycin responses ( Figure 3B, File S7 , p > 0.05, Tukey HSD). 529\n\nBy contrast, the jmjd-5 deletion alleles in the N2 and the CB4856 backgrounds were each more 530 resistant to bleomycin than their respective parental strains ( Figure 3B, File S7 , ECA1047 vs. 531 CB4856 p = 3.8e-10, ECA1048 vs. CB4856 p = 0.026, ECA1051 vs. N2 p = 7.4e-4, ECA1052 532 vs. N2 p = 2.9e-6, Tukey HSD). However, we also noted that these strains were more sensitive in 533 the control condition than other deletion strains ( Figure S8, File S1, File S7) . Therefore, the 534 relative increased bleomycin resistance observed in the jmjd-5 deletion strains could be caused 535 by their increased sensitivity in the control condition. 536\n\nWe tested if the non-synonymous variant in jmjd-5 between the N2 and CB4856 strains caused 538 bleomycin-response differences. At residue 338 of JMJD-5, the N2 strain has a proline, whereas 539 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/565218 doi: bioRxiv preprint 25 of 48 the CB4856 strain has a serine (S338P, Figure S9A ). We used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate 540 reciprocal allele replacements of the jmjd-5 single-nucleotide polymorphism that encodes the 541 putative amino-acid change in the N2 background jmjd-5(N2 to CB4856) and in the CB4856 542 background jmjd-5(CB4856 to N2) (Materials and Methods, Supplemental Information). We 543 created two independent allele replacements in each genetic background and measured each 544 strain for bleomycin-response differences as compared to the parental strains ( Figure S9B, File  545   S3 ). Although the allele-replacement strains with the CB4856 allele in the N2 genetic 546 background jmjd-5(N2 to CB4856) were significantly different from the N2 parental strain, these 547 strains were more sensitive to bleomycin than N2 ( Figure S9B , File S7, ECA576 vs. N2 p = 548 0.006, ECA577 vs. N2 p = 1.6e-6, Tukey HSD). This increased sensitivity was unexpected, 549 because the CB4856 allele at the jmjd-5 locus should confer resistance. However, the NIL with 550 the CB4856 genotype across the QTL was not different from the N2 parental strain (ECA232 in 551 Figure S6 , File S7), suggesting that the QTL might only confer increased sensitivity when the 552 N2 allele is in the CB4856 background. Therefore, it remained unclear whether an allele 553 replacement of jmjd-5 in the N2 parental background could confer resistance. Neither of the two 554 strains with the N2 allele in the CB4856 background, jmjd-5(CB4856 to N2), conferred a 555 significantly more sensitive phenotype than the CB4856 parental strain (Figure S9B, File S7) . 556\n\nGiven that the QTL explained 43.58% of phenotypic variation among the RIAILs, the causal 557 variant should have a clear impact on bleomycin response. Additionally, the NILs with the N2 558 allele at the QTL introgressed into the CB4856 background displayed a significant increase in 559 bleomycin sensitivity compared to the parental CB4856 strain (Figure S6, File S7) . Taken 560 together, the phenotypes of the reciprocal allele-replacement strains showed that the amino-acid 561 change in JMJD-5 likely does not underlie bleomycin-response variation between the N2 and 562 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/565218 doi: bioRxiv preprint 26 of 48 CB4856 strains, although deletion of this gene did cause resistance to bleomycin regardless of 563 the genetic background. We performed a reciprocal hemizygosity assay to test if natural variation 564 in jmjd-5 function affected bleomycin responses ( Figure S10, Figure S11 , Figure S12 ). The 565 results of this assay supported the previously identified increase in bleomycin resistance of 566 homozygous jmjd-5 deletions in both parental backgrounds ( Figure S11, File S7 , p < 0.05, 567\n\nTukey HSD), which again might be caused by an increased sensitivity in the control condition 568 ( Figure S12) . However, the increases in bleomycin resistance between each jmjd-5 deletion 569 strain and the strain with the same genetic background were similar, and the reciprocal 570 hemizygous strains show equivalent bleomycin responses ( Figure S11 ). Taken together, these 571 results suggest that natural variation in jmjd-5 function does not underlie this QTL. 572\n\nThe nematode-specific gene H19N07.3 impacts bleomycin variation 574\n\nBecause none of the genes with a non-synonymous variant between the N2 and CB4856 strains 575 explained the QTL, we explored other ways in which natural variation could impact bleomycin 576 responses. We used the 13,001 SNPs to perform linkage mapping on the gene expression data of 577 the RIAILs and identified 4,326 expression QTL (eQTL) across the genome (Rockman et al. 578 2010, File S12, File S13, Materials and Methods). Of the 118 genes in the 187 kb surrounding 579 the bleomycin-response QTL, expression for 50 genes were measured in the previous microarray 580 study. We identified a significant eQTL for eight of these 50 genes, four of which mapped to 581 chromosome V (File S13). eQTL for two of those four genes, H19N07.3 and cnc-10, mapped to 582 the center of chromosome V and overlapped with the bleomycin-response QTL. Because cnc-10 583 did not underlie bleomycin response variation (Figure 3B) (Figure 4A and B, File S14) . The length 586 of animals and expression of scb-1 was correlated in the RIAIL strains ( Figure 4C , File S15, 587 r 2 = 0.61, p < 9.5e-13 Spearman's correlation). Although this gene does not have a non-588 synonymous variant between the N2 and CB4856 strains, natural variation in gene expression 589 could impact bleomycin responses. 1.4e-14, ECA1132 vs. N2, p = 6.9e-5, ECA1135 vs. N2, p = 0.006, Tukey HSD). These results 597 suggest that H19N07.3 function is required for resistance to bleomycin. Therefore, we renamed 598 this gene scb-1 for sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic bleomycin. Unlike with the jmjd-5 599 deletion strains, the scb-1 deletion strains had no significant differences in the control condition 600 (File S7). Therefore, the bleomycin sensitivity of the scb-1 deletion strains were not caused by 601 control-condition phenotypes. 602 603 Because an scb-1 non-synonymous variant has not been identified between the N2 and CB4856 604 strains, changes to protein function likely do not cause bleomycin response differences. RIAILs 605 with the CB4856 allele at the QTL peak marker have increased expression of scb-1 and 606 increased bleomycin resistance compared to RIAILs with the N2 allele (Figure 1, Figure 4) . 607\n\nTherefore, scb-1 expression differences might cause the bleomycin-response variation between 608 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/565218 doi: bioRxiv preprint the parental strains. We performed RNA-seq of the N2 and CB4856 strains to assess scb-1 609 expression differences between the parental strains and did not identify a significant increase in 610 expression in the CB4856 strain ( Figure S13 , File S16, p = 0.20, Wald test; p = 0.17, likelihood 611 ratio test). This result could be caused by the low sample size (n = 3) in the RNA-seq 612 experiment, or the RIAIL strains could have a novel variant that arose during strain construction 613 that causes scb-1 expression variation. Alternatively, the expression difference observed in the 614 RIAIL strains could be attributed to epistatic loci. We performed a two-factor genome scan to 615 identify epistatic loci that underlie scb-1 expression variation in the RIAILs and identified two 616 significant interactions: one between loci on chromosomes IV and X and another between loci on 617 chromosomes II and V ( Figure S14 , File S17). This result might suggest that epistatic loci 618 underlie scb-1 expression variation in the RIAILs and could explain why scb-1 expression is not 619 variable in the parental strains. 620\n\nTo test the role of natural variation in scb-1 function, we performed a reciprocal hemizygosity 622 test in control and bleomycin conditions (Figure 6, File S3) . These results matched the increase 623 in sensitivity of homozygous deletions in both parental backgrounds observed previously. The 624 hemizygous strain with the CB4856 allele of scb-1 had a bleomycin phenotype similar to the 625 heterozygous strain, whereas the hemizygous strain with the N2 allele of scb-1 was more 626 sensitive to bleomycin than the heterozygous strain. Taken together, these results suggest that 627 natural variation in scb-1 function underlies the bleomycin-response difference between the N2 628 and CB4856 strains. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/565218 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nThe scb-1 natural variant that underlies the bleomycin-response differences remains unknown. 632\n\nBecause this gene does not have a predicted non-synonymous variant between the N2 and 633 CB4856 strains, scb-1 gene expression might underlie bleomycin response differences. Potential 634 candidate variants that could cause this expression difference include one variant two kilobases 635 upstream of the gene and one variant in the third intron of scb-1. However, gene expression can 636 be regulated by distant loci, so the identification of the specific variant is difficult. To understand 637 whether natural variation of scb-1 underlies bleomycin-response differences in other strains, we 638 compared the bleomycin-response linkage mapping to a genome-wide association mapping 639 (GWA). We used the HTA to measure median optical density in bleomycin for 83 divergent wild 640 isolates and performed GWA mapping (Figure 7 , File S18, File S19). Six QTL were identified 641 from the GWA, but none of these QTL regions overlapped the QTL from linkage mapping 642 (Figure 7, File S19) . Therefore, the CB4856 strain might have a rare variant that underlies its 643 increase in bleomycin resistance compared to the N2 strain. 644\n\nWe identified all single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertion/deletions (indels), and 646 structural variants (SVs) present in these 83 strains for which the CB4856 strain contains the 647 alternate allele compared to the N2 reference strain. We found 105 variants within the QTL 648 confidence interval (79 SNVs, 26 indels, 0 SVs) for which the CB4856 strain contains the 649 alternate allele (Figure S15, File S20) . We then identified SNVs and indels with a minor-allele 650 frequency less than 5% within the 83 strains, because these low-frequency variants are likely to 651 have insufficient power to map by GWA. Seventy-two of the 105 variants in the region were 652 identified as rare variants that might underlie the bleomycin-response difference between the N2 653 and CB4856 strains (Figure S15, File S20) . Twenty-eight of these rare variants were not unique 654 .
