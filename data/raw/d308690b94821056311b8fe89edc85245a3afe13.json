{"title": "23 Response to SARS as a prototype for bioterrorism: Lessons in a Regional Hospital in Hong Kong", "body": "Following the boom of the post-war years in the latter half of the twentieth century, the only large-scale infectious disease outbreaks were the influenza pandemics of 1957 and 1968 [1] . Apart from the aged and those with co-morbidities, in whom high morbidity and mortality was recorded, most patients had mild manifestations. With the advent of potent antimicrobial agents, the possible threat of widespread and lethal infections was generally considered minimal, and the world was ill-prepared for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak caused by the novel SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in early 2003. SARS wreaked havoc in 29 countries and infected 8422 patients within a short span of a few months [2] . By virtue of its novelty, infectious potential, associated mortality and in particular the lack of proven therapy, SARS-CoV has all the characteristics of a biological agent of choice in bioterrorism. Response to the SARS outbreak can thus serve as a prototype for combating against acts of bioterrorism. We describe our response to this SARS outbreak in the setting of a Hong Kong acute care hospital.\n\nOn February 11, 2003 , the Chinese Ministry of Health reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) 305 cases of an acute respiratory syndrome of unknown etiology, occurring in Southern China between November 16, 2002 and February 9, 2003 [3] . On the same day, the Hong Kong Hospital Authority Head Office (HAHO), which operates 40 public hospitals and delivers over 92% of inpatient services in the territory, convened an Expert Panel on Severe Community-acquired Pneumonia (SCAP) in response to rumors about this infectious condition adjacent to the territory. It aimed to investigate the possibility of a similar situation in Hong Kong, to formulate guidelines for the prevention of its spread, and to require the reporting of all patients presenting with features of SCAP. The Chief of Service (COS) of the Department of Medicine of our institution, Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital (PYNEH), which employs over 3500 staff to operate 1829 beds (1219 general beds and 610 psychiatric beds) to serve a population of 750,000 on Hong Kong Island, was appointed to the Panel.\n\nAll SCAP patients admitted to the general and medical intensive care units (ICU and MICU) in our institution were reviewed in accordance with this direction. It transpired that etiological diagnosis could be identified in a single patient, a 55-year old Hong Kong gentleman who had made frequent business travels to Shenzhen in the Guangdong Province of Southern China. Admitted on January 22, 2003 to an acute medical ward with respiratory distress and bilateral pneumonia, he was intubated a few hours later in the MICU, but died after 12 days from intractable acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to unresolving pneumonia. None of the healthcare workers (HCW) contacting this patient in the general ward and MICU had fallen ill during his stay. His stored sera, checked in May 2003 retrospectively, confirmed SARS-CoV infection, but this case did not provide us with any clues about an impending infectious disease outbreak, nor were there unusual increases in the number of SCAP in Hong Kong throughout the 2003 winter season. At that time, the possible candidate organisms for the pneumonia outbreak in China were thought to be the usual organisms of atypical pneumonia or the avian influenza (H5N1) virus [4] . A new emerging organism did not rank high as etiological agent, and bioterrorism attack with an existing or a genetically engineered virus had not come to mind. The Panel reminded all frontline HCW to take droplet precautions on contacting pneumonia patients. By February 20, 2003 , the Chinese authorities had reported to WHO that Chlamydia pneumoniae was the likely organism responsible for the recent outbreak of pneumonia [3] .\n\nAnother 44-year-old Hong Kong businessman was admitted to an acute medical ward (ward A5) of PYNEH on March 2, 2003 for fever, cough, and sputum for one week. He had also traveled to Guangdong, Southern China on February [22] [23] 2003 . The White cell count was not elevated, lymphocyte was 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and HIV serology was negative. Chest radiograph (CXR) showed bilateral basal pneumonic infiltrates. He was treated as for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and was placed in an open 8-bed cubicle (42 m 2 area) in the ward, with positive pressure ventilation at five air changes per hour (ACH). Because of a report about a fatal case of avian influenza from another hospital in a returnee from China at about the same time [5] , for the benefit of doubt our patient was transferred to an isolation room (13 m 2 , 8 ACH) on Day 2. After his nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) proved negative for influenza A and adenovirus on Day 3, he was moved back to the open cubicle. He then developed diarrhea and CXR continued to deteriorate despite standard antibiotics according to CAP treatment guideline [6] . On Day 6 (March 7, 13 days from symptom onset), he desaturated and was transferred to an isolation room in MICU for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) through a facial mask. On Day 8 (Day 15 from symptom onset), he was intubated because of increasing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Two intubating physicians wore protective garments against contamination by HIV (surgical mask, full-face shield, gown, and gloves), while nurses stood on the side of the bed and wore surgical masks, gown and gloves but not face shields. On Day 14 (March 15, 2003) , the World Health Organization (WHO) published the case definition of suspected SARS at the WHO website, which in retrospect matched the presentation of this patient. He died on Day 15 from intractable acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Subsequent serology against the SARS-CoV was strongly positive. None of the HCW in MICU contracted SARS.\n\nThirty-two HCW in ward A5 had been exposed to this patient from March 2 to March 7, 2003. On March 9, a nurse from the same ward was admitted with pneumonia and was placed in an isolation room in A5 ward. By March 12, four other HCW from the same ward had requested sick leave due to upper respiratory tract illnesses. As an infectious condition was suspected, all were called back for medical review, blood tests, and CXR. Healthy HCW of the same ward were similarly screened. All CAP patients admitted in the preceding month were reviewed. The patient described above was identified to be the index case and the nurse admitted was his case nurse.\n\nIn response to an urgent consultation by the COS of the department, the Chair of Clinical Microbiology of the University of Hong Kong who had managed the contacts of the first local SARS patient (a visiting nephrologist from Guangzhou in Guangdong Province), gave his expert opinion on March 13, 2003 . He advised on prescribing levofloxacin to all symptomatic HCW with atypical CAP, and intravenous ribavirin and corticosteroid (to which another HCW contacting the nephrologist had responded) to the only admitted HCW, who by then was in ARF. He concurred with our plan to cohort all pneumonia and suspected cases in one ward and recommended improvement in environmental ventilation. The Hong Kong Department of Health and HAHO were informed of the situation in PYNEH on the same day.\n\nOn March 14, all HCW on sick leave plus two others were admitted with progressive atypical pneumonia, including his case medical officer, a nurse, and four supporting staff. Four household contacts of three of the affected HCW, a patient and a visitor of another patient in the same cubicle were admitted over the next two days with the same problem. Three more nurses, including one investigating the outbreak, developed similar illnesses after March 17 and were admitted on March 23-24. These likely represented secondary infections by the first affected HCW before institution of strict droplet and contact precautions [7] . All 16 cases could be traced to this index case, had positive SARS serology subsequently and survived without intubation.\n\nThe PYNEH outbreak coincided with a major outbreak in another local hospital, in which 138 HCW contracted SARS from a young pneumonic patient (who had visited \"Hotel M\") nursed in a general medical ward [8] . It later transpired that the origin of that outbreak was the same nephrologist from Guangzhou who had stayed in this hotel in Hong Kong [9] . The nephrologist and his brother-in-law received treatment and died earlier in another hospital where a smaller nosocomial outbreak had also occurred. The outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong had thus started independently in three hospitals and spread to the community two weeks later.\n\nOur emergency room (ER) doctors performed first-line screening and admitting suspected SARS patients according to the prevailing WHO case definitions [10] , with advice from pulmonary physicians where indicated. Learning from the experience in Singapore, the ER could effectively screen, treat, and safely discharge the majority of patients using screening questionnaires and a set of admission criteria [11] . The total number of patients screened at ER and admitted as in-patients was 505, including 459 adults and 46 children ( \n\nA total of 90 confirmed SARS cases were eventually treated in our hospital. The first patient was admitted on March 9, and the last was diagnosed on April 28, 2003. By June 13, all SARS patients were discharged from PYNEH. and the number of confirmed SARS patients in cohort wards each day (peaking at 60 on April 15) during the outbreak. Our strategies to deal with this sudden surge of patients harboring an unknown and highly infectious disease are described.\n\nHAHO has established Infection Control Officers (ICO) in each hospital to head the Infection Control Team (ICT), formulate and enforce the implementation of infection control policies in line with prevailing standards. Guidelines for control against droplet infections have been wellestablished in Hong Kong hospitals before the occurrence of SARS, in particular for infections which were specified or suspected by ICT to be highly infectious. In general, patients with respiratory tract infections were routinely nursed in general medical wards together with those with other medical problems.\n\nOn receiving the information about the outbreak in ward A5, ICT immediately advised droplet and contact precautions to be implemented. On March 14, 2003 , A5 ward became the only pneumonia cohort ward in the hospital, with each of the cubicle and isolation room clearly defined for the screening of new cases with respiratory infection or cohorting of atypical pneumonia cases. With further influx of suspected cases, ward B5 (another medical ward) was designated to be a female cohort ward, with A5 accepting male patients only. Eventually, a total of seven wards were designated for cohorting: five medical wards (two for screening, two for confirmed SARS, and one for convalescent SARS patients to complete the standard course of treatment [12] ); as well as one pediatric ward and one SARS ICU.\n\nHCW in ward A5 initially wore surgical masks only, but as soon as the high infectivity of SARS was recognized, protective gowns, gloves, and N95 respirators were worn during patient care. Hand hygiene was emphasized and safety in the handling of clinical specimens reinforced. The ICT set up different levels of PPE requirements for different clinical areas according to risk stratification (Table 23 .1). These rules were enforced until the end of the outbreak. In the early stages, demand on PPE was very high. For peace of mind, some staff further added on their own versions of PPE. To enforce strict infection control policies and to ensure staff safety, HAHO appointed relevant experts to review all PPE with ICT from all hospitals, and only those found to be suitable for the purpose were allowed. Among those rejected were the \"barrier man suit\" designed against chemical contamination, and the \"Stryker T4 protective system\" used in operation rooms (OR). A personal air purified particulate respirator (PAPR) system (Airmate \u00ae ) was used after mid-April during highrisk aerosol generating procedures such as intubation and resuscitation. Consumption and supply of PPE and other essential equipment were closely monitored by administrative services. Two \"PPE Complaint Coordinators,\" a doctor and an administrative staff, were appointed to receive staff feedback. \n\nAll equipments were cleaned with diluted sodium hypochlorite solution after use in SARS patients. Use of nebulized treatment in all patients was prohibited in light of a report of nosocomial transmission of SARS in another Hong Kong hospital [8] . As many SARS patients had presented with diarrhea, there was a high possibility of oro-fecal spread through contaminated fomites [13] . Additional housekeeping personnel were employed for environmental disinfection with special attention to shared toilet facilities in the wards. In full protective gear, they performed immediate disinfection of the toilet with sodium hypochlorite after its every use by SARS patients. Since SARS could survive for prolonged periods in the environment [14] , we submit that this measure had contributed significantly to reduction of nosocomial spread of SARS.\n\nThe facilities management team (FMT) worked closely with PCCT and ICT to re-design ward facilities in accordance with infection control requirements. Ward areas were segregated into \"clean\" or non-infectious from \"dirty\" or infectious/potentially infectious areas. Separate routings were designed for entry and exit, with dedicated gowning and de-gowning areas, respectively. To reduce unnecessary entry of non-HCW into cohort wards, buffer areas were delineated near the entrances for the delivery of food and other items. Ventilation of staff changing rooms and toilets were upgraded, with the addition of simple showering facilities in every cohort ward in case gross contamination occurred. Nursing care was streamlined to minimize patient contact. CXR were taken with portable machines stationed in the cohort wards. X-ray film cassettes were disinfected between cases. Medical records were prohibited in patient areas, and documentation could only be made after removal of potentially infectious PPE and donning of new and clean PPE. Documents from cohort wards were sent by email and fascimile, and hard copies were avoided. Hospital wards and operation rooms (OR) in PYNEH had been designed to operate at positive pressure with respect to the surrounding to prevent the ingress of contaminants. Temperature and humidity were closely controlled via a standard heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. Apart from the OR, a significant proportion of well-mixed room air was re-circulated after filtering and conditioning. As the predominant mode of SARS spread was assumed to be through infectious droplets, the existing HVAC design could not meet infection control requirements. With no clear guidelines for HVAC design for SARS wards and OR, input from ICT and the clinicians were critical toward the modification of engineering and environmental controls. The consensus among all concerned parties in mid-March 2003 was to adopt the isolation room requirements for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) [15] . Immediate ventilation improvement works were thus designed and implemented in the SARS wards to provide sufficient air change for dilution and removal of contaminants; to create negative pressure and achieve directional airflow from the clean to the infected areas; and to incorporate local source control to extract contaminants via the shortest possible path and within the shortest time. In retrospect, we strongly believe that this decision had been pivotal to our success in combating SARS and minimizing its nosocomial spread, since air-borne transmission of this disease had been raised by Hong Kong [16] and Canadian [14] researchers to be a real possibility.\n\nIn response to the demands of subsequent clinical situations, FMT utilized the same principles to create a negative-pressure OR with unidirectional flow for a SARS patients requiring laparotomy, and temporarily converted the positive-pressure cardiac catheterization laboratory on two occasions for diagnostic and interventional procedures in SARS patients [17, 18] .\n\nAll ventilation improvement works were executed in phases. In Phase 1, frequency of air change was immediately increased on March 13, 2003 from the usual 5 ACH to 6 ACH in all medical wards, and to 7-8 ACH in the SARS cohort ward. Window-type exhaust fans (Figure 23. 3) with sound-absorbing hoods were installed, and folding doors were added to segregate the nurse station from patient cubicles. Unidirectional airflow was thus achieved from the corridors outside the SARS ward, through the clean nurse station to patient areas and finally to the window exhaust. Returned air dampers in the HVAC system were closed to achieve 100% fresh air intake. In Phase 2, fan cowls were added to discharge outlets of exhaust fans to reduce fluctuation in performance caused by strong winds (Figure 23 .4). In Phase 3, windowtype exhaust fans were replaced by heavy-duty ducted exhaust fans with non-return air dampers to achieve 12 ACH. High efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters were installed at exhaust outlets. Exhaust air ducts were next installed at low level ( Figure 23 .5) in Phase 4 to create unidirectional airflow from high level supply diffusers through the breathing zone of HCW before passing on to infected patients and then to the low-level exhaust. Air grilles with double deflection supply were adopted to control airflow patterns and directions and minimize air turbulence and mixing. Additional HEPA filters were installed at return air grilles to allow air re-circulation in wards with lower infection risks. In the last phase (Phase 5), local source control with adjustable and removable exhaust hoods were installed at both sides of hospital beds (Figure 23.6) . Standby exhaust fans were also installed to automatically take over the function of duty fans in case the latter failed.\n\nThe department's Duty Committee devised a staff redeployment plan in case the outbreak should become extended in time and scale. Pregnant HCW were re-deployed to non-SARS wards. Annual and study leaves were cancelled. With further assistance from the FMT, staff quarters and overnight rooms were offered to HCW of cohort wards should they wish to avoid infecting their families. Doctors, nurses, and supporting staff of other departments were deployed to work in non-SARS medical wards. These were still serving 75% of the usual number of patients since PYNEH was designated by HAHO to support another hospital which had been overwhelmed by the sudden influx of SARS patients from its community (the \"Amoy Garden cohort\") [19] . All non-emergency investigations, procedures and operations in the hospital were stopped. Specialist outpatient clinics, geriatrics day hospital and clinical admission services were reduced. Inter-departmental consultations were stopped unless the conditions were urgent.\n\nBoth formal and informal channels for staff communication were actively utilized. The COS held meetings with the department 2-3 times a week to transmit important information from HAHO and hospital management, to keep staff upto-date on the clinical aspects of SARS, progress of outbreak, changing infection control requirements, and clinical and radiographic information toward early identification of this disease. Staff feedback on suggestions and concerns were encouraged and reflected to hospital management where appropriate. The COS frequently appealed to the staff's professionalism and duty of care to patients while assuring them that the risk they were taking for the good of their patients and society were well recognized by the hospital and the department, and all that was possible would be done to protect them and their families [20] . It was later found that anxiety levels were high among front-line HCW in our hospital as in other parts of the world [21] . We have thus learned that, should similar outbreaks ever return, experts must be recruited to the response team to attend to the mental well-being of HCW and supporting staff as well as their family members. Towards this end, integration of mental health care into public health preparedness for infectious outbreaks has been proposed [22] .\n\nThe department also maintained close contact with HAHO and other hospitals to exchange views about this disease. Training programs and meetings were organized for department staff on infection control and clinical management of SARS, psychosocial care of patients, and communication skills with patients/relatives at times of stress. Meticulous real-time or retrospective documentation was kept at every stage, which facilitated subsequent review for research, reporting, accountability and medico-legal purposes.\n\nFive members of the Pulmonary and Critical Care team (PCCT, of which the COS was head) took up supervisory roles in SARS wards and SARS ICU throughout the outbreak, assisted later by a geriatrician-cum-pulmonologist. Rotating senior and junior physicians from other medical subspecialties took up front-line roles in the SARS wards. At least two members of the PCCT conducted rounds in each cohort ward twice daily, and the Team discussed patient management together every day to expedite learning and accumulation of experience. A multi-disciplinary team comprising PCCT, ICT, FMT, and administrators was convened and met regularly to plan and monitor different aspects of outbreak response in the light of continuously updated clinical knowledge. Psychiatrists were recruited to manage SARS patients when they developed anxiety and depression and to provide training to staff caring for them.\n\nTo keep HCW abreast about the rapidly changing scenario, PCCT developed information sheets containing clinical features, investigation methods, treatment, and prognostic factors, which were frequently updated and distributed to SARS and medical wards. This exercise required PCCT to integrate knowledge gained from various channels in a timely manner, and contributed toward the formulation of a standardized treatment protocol for SARS at an early stage [12] . Our satisfactory treatment outcomes were duly published [23] and efficacy of the protocol was subsequently supported by similar outcomes reported from Taiwan [24] .\n\nEncouraged by our observation that noninvasive ventilation (NIV) did not cause SARS transmission when applied in an isolation room with 8 ACH to the index case, we continued to use this ventilatory mode in the early stages of SARSrelated ARF. At the same time and unbeknown to us, NIV was totally banned in all other Hong Kong hospitals for fear of nosocomial transmission of SARS. Satisfactory patient outcome was achieved in most of our patients with ARF, however, and no SARS transmission had occurred in over 100 exposed HCW [25] . The efficacy of NIV with avoidance of intubation could be related to two equally beneficial effects: it reduced prevented secondary infection as patients were not intubated, and reduced the chance of SARS transmission to HCW during intubation [26] . The safety of NIV use in our hospital and the possibility that air-borne transmission of SARS could have been possible [14, 16] lent full support to the establishment of negative pressure and unidirectional environmental ventilation within a few days of the outbreak [42] . We submit that the (still current) recommendations from Canada [27] and the United Kingdom [28] to avoid the use of NIV had not taken into account the utility of improved environmental ventilation in markedly reducing the chance of SARS transmission to HCW.\n\nDuring resuscitation, we added viral and bacterial filters to ventilator tubings and the bag-valve apparatus, and draped a plastic bag opened on two sides above the face mask to direct expired air to below the patient's face to avoid direct its inhalation by HCW (Figure 23 .7) [29] . The department continued a close liaison with the Microbiology Department of the University of Hong Kong, whose team successfully isolated and grew the SARS-CoV [19] , and benefited from fruitful advice while also contributing valuable specimens for research.\n\nUnified command was achieved through an Outbreak Management Team (OMT) headed by the Hospital Chief Executive (HCE), with members comprising General Managers and COS, to oversee all matters related to the outbreak. Daily meetings of HCE in HAHO made major policy decisions to manage the outbreak, followed by OMT meeting in the hospital to ensure swift communication of important corporate messages among all parties involved. Meeting minutes were sent by electronic means to ward managers, department managers and unit heads and posted in the hospital intranet. In addition, weekly summaries of developments were sent to update all Hospital Governing Board members.\n\nVisitors to the cohort wards were prohibited, but patients were allowed to freely use their mobile phones for communications with families and responding to enquiries from epidemiologists. Videophones were later installed for visitors in the Patient Resource Center. Visitors were only allowed into the cohort wards under exceptional circumstances, during which their contact information was recorded and the Department of Health notified for medical surveillance. Visitors to acute general wards were similarly prohibited, since rapid diagnosis of SARS was not feasible until very late in the outbreak, and atypical presentation [30] could occur especially in the elderly [31, 32] . Visitors were only allowed into the two non-acute wards in which patients had negligible likelihood of SARS. With additional security installed at a single point of entry for the public, surveillance with temperature-taking and completion of designated questionnaires were enforced to facilitate contact tracing. Further security was installed at the entrance to all wards to prevent inadvertent entry of the public from other hospital entrances. Volunteer services and clinical training attachments for medical, nursing and allied health students were suspended.\n\nIn the last week of March 2003, the ICT was assigned by OMT to conduct daily rounds of cohort wards to collect epidemiological and clinical data. All suspected cases fulfilling the case definition were entered into a registry and followed-up daily by the ICT until discharge. Individual registries from 13 acute hospitals were later integrated by HAHO to become an online e-SARS registry, which was later enhanced by the information system of the Hong Kong Police Force designed for criminal tracking and analysis. The resulting linking of clinical information, a smart tracking system and the epidemiological database under the Department of Health served to effectively identify the chain of human transmission of SARS in a timely manner. Because of its efficiency in contact tracing, the e-SARS system had contributed significantly to containment of the outbreak. It was later awarded the Stockholm Challenge Award in 2004 as an innovation in information system which had significant benefit to society [33].\n\nVisitors and patients were prohibited from entering the canteen. Signs were put up at the entrance to remind staff not to wear PPE other than a fresh and clean mask, and to clean hands with the alcohol hand sprays provided before food consumption. Close face-to-face interactions were discouraged. All users had to sit facing the same direction, even when having meals together. The number of seats was reduced to increase space between users. Senior staff of the canteen acted as patrol officers to enforce these rules, while members of ICET performed regular spot-checks for non-compliance during peak hours.\n\nOn March 15, 2003 , the first staff forum was jointly held by the COS in Medicine and ICO, a clinical microbiologist and COS in Clinical Pathology. As the outbreak continued, further staff forums were held by the HCE to concentrate on updating staff knowledge about the outbreak, with repeated emphases on the importance of good infection control practices. Many training sessions on this subject were held for HCW, clerical and administrative staff, including lectures and demonstrations on proper gowning and de-gowning of PPE, and safe and effective NPA collection. Training was reinforced by video-viewing at department or workplace level, and display of posters and pamphlets in the most frequented areas of the hospital. Non-hospital personnel recruited by contracted-out services were equally trained by their supervisors. Record of training in the form of signed attendance lists was kept and monitored by the Human Resources Department.\n\nPYNEH set up a \"SARS homepage\" in the hospital intranet to provide quick and easy reference to all infection control news and guidelines, changes to inpatient services, operation procedures, supporting services, and specialist outpatient services and human resources issues. Staff feedback on all matters related to the SARS outbreak were collected through focus group meetings, designated contact persons (\"staff ambassadors\") assigned by the Human Resource Department and nursing sections, staff hotlines and suggestion boxes. A designated workplace controller was appointed for every workplace unit to brief staff on a daily basis, or three times a day if shift duty was involved, on issues including hospital updates; reinforcement of infection control measures; a daily bulletin \"The SARS Battling Update\"; as well as staff sentiment. An administrative staff was designated to handle enquiries from the media and the community.\n\nThe PYNEH Administrative Team played a coordinating role to ensure smooth implementation of the response plan. The wide scope of administrative services including general and patient support services; food services management; facilities management; procurement and materials management, is intricately linked to all clinical activities. Material and human resources were prioritized for SARS management. Non-medical wards were converted to medical wards as the latter were turned into cohort wards, with appropriate staff deployments. Resources were appropriately redeployed to purchase PPE, improve environmental ventilation, and employ additional support staff for infection control and security purposes.\n\nThe ICT's guidelines for standard PPE provision at three levels of clinical areas based on risk assessment were disseminated to all staff involved in patient-related services, including catering, materials transportation, housekeeping, cleansing, security, pest control, repair and maintenance, and medical services. According to a subsequent audit, availability of these guidelines had allayed anxiety and concern of supporting staff, who before had uniformly expressed significantly uncertainty and stress when working in patient care environment. Frequent training sessions on infection control and changes in workflow were held for the supervisors of support staff, who in turn trained and monitored their staff's compliance. As a result, none of the 235 supporting non-HCW staff with SARS patient contact had acquired the disease.\n\nPrior to SARS, PPE materials in excess of demand were not stockpiled. By mid-late March 2003, there was a sudden global surge in demand. In-coordination in procurement among local hospitals led to competition for supply. This issue was solved within a week with the introduction of central procurement at HAHO level. PPE procurement and distribution by the supply chain in PYNEH was tightly coupled to ICT guidelines for PPE use in different risk areas. Intensive communications at daily OMT meetings helped foster trust between HCW and procurement staff regarding the guarantee of adequacy of PPE supply. As a result, none of our HCW complained through the media to voice their concern about perceived inadequacy of PPE supply as those in some other hospitals did.\n\nThe central role of FMT and engineering personnel in ventilation improvements to meet the stringent demands of the outbreak has been described. On review, long-standing partnership of the same FMT since the inception of the hospital in 1993, together with a shared culture of trust and cooperation toward patient-centered care, had enabled the achievement of the highest environmental quality at the earliest possible time, enabling treatment perceived to be dangerous by other hospitals (namely NIV) to be carried out for the benefit of patients [25] and in turn protecting staff from exposure to high-risk procedures (namely intubation).\n\nIn Hong Kong, cohorting of SARS patients was instituted in 13 acute hospitals. Similar to Singapore [34] , limiting the care of SARS patients to a single designated hospital had been tried locally in late March, but very soon the capacity was so overwhelmed that all acute hospitals had to receive SARS patients. By late March 2003, a \"SARS\" homepage was established by HAHO in the e-Knowledge Gateway (eKG) of the HA intranet to continuously update all staff on scientific knowledge about this disease.\n\nTo further enhance compliance to infection control policies, HAHO directed the establishment of the Infection Control Enforcement Team (ICET) in every hospital. The objectives were: to convey updated infection control policies on SARS from HAHO to frontline staff; to coordinate operational logistics between hospital administration and frontline departments; to appoint departmental and workplace controllers to enforce and monitor infection control activities at all levels (including staff canteen and relaxation areas); to audit compliance to infection control practices in the workplace; and to report non-compliance to the respective department heads and HCE.\n\nIn PYNEH, the chairperson of ICET was elected from among senior non-medical clinicians and this chairperson should report to both HAHO ICET and HCE. Members consisted of senior medical, nursing, administrative staff as well as the ICT. Each wore conspicuous arm-bands for identification and was given the authority to immediately warn or counsel staff on issues related to infection control. The ICET were effective in enhancing compliance to infection control practices among hospital staff, and played an important role towards reduction in the nosocomial transmission of SARS.\n\nWith two additional HCW who developed breakthrough infection due to non-compliance to infection control measures, a total of 13 HCW among 1300 exposed employees in PYNEH had contracted and recovered from SARS. Four infected HCW transferred from other hospitals also had full recovery. Of the 90 patients confirmed to be suffering from SARS by laboratory criteria [35] , 21 (24%) required ICU care and four died. These included the index case and two deaths from concomitant cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction and stroke), resulting in the lowest case fatality rate of 3.4% [23] for SARS patients in Hong Kong [8, 13, 36] . This figure also compared favorably to mortality figures worldwide [37, 38] . Apart from the index case, all deaths occurred in patients above the age of 65 years with significant comorbidities [23] . A twice-weekly SARS followup clinic was set up in a SARS convalescent ward from April 15 onward, followed by a Post-SARS Clinic under the direction of HAHO. Hong Kong was finally removed from the list of areas with local SARS transmission on June 23, 2003.\n\nIn the aftermath of SARS, the Government of Hong Kong has strengthened our healthcare system to withstand further disease outbreak [39] and potential bioterrorism. Point-to-point communication with Mainland China on outbreak notification was established, together with an electronic web-based platform to report clusters of febrile HCW or patients in hospitals. Facilities in HA hospitals were upgraded to include 530 isolation wards with 1280 isolation beds, and five such wards with 120 isolation beds had been converted in PYNEH. Resources were allocated for training and research in infection control and epidemiology; development of contingency plans; and establishment of a Center for Health Protection (CHP). Conduction of drills based on different clinical scenario further augmented our preparedness against future outbreaks.\n\nAfter overcoming the onslaught of SARS, the Hong Kong community has become aware that emerging infections may and can occur at any time. This is further reinforced by the recent avian influenza outbreaks which keep reminding us of this looming threat. In addition, hospitals have to evaluate their levels of preparedness against bioterrorism, which can simulate infectious disease outbreaks. Priority areas for improvement suggested have included community involvement; staff education; improved information technology; disease surveillance; and additional equipment and staff [40] . The experience of our hospital in the SARS outbreak may serve as a prototype for such response in a hospital setting. Under these circumstances, the healthcare system and the community as a whole must join force to combat the common enemy. Multi-dimensional and flexible response plans require strong leadership and clear directions to be effective, but must also take into account human frailties in times of great stress, when every resource is stretched to its utmost limit."}
