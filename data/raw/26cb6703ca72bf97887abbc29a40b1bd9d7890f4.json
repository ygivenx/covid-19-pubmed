{"title": "Hotspots of aberrant enhancer activity in fibrolamellar carcinoma reveal molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis and intrinsic drug resistance", "body": "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare type of liver cancer that predominantly affects adolescents and young adults with no prior history of liver disease (Craig et al., 1980; Torbenson, 2012) . Currently, surgical resection is the only effective treatment for FLC, however most patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, making surgical cures difficult (Stipa et al., 2006) . While some patients have been successfully treated with chemotherapy and molecular therapies, there is no standard treatment regimen for FLC patients (Torbenson, 2012) . Furthermore, FLC is often drug resistant and frequently recurs following initial treatment (Maniaci et al., 2009) , underscoring the need to develop effective therapies for this cancer. FLC is genetically characterized by a ~400 kb heterozygous deletion on chromosome 19 that leads to the formation of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion (Honeyman et al., 2014) . This fusion occurs in at least 80% of patients (Cornella et al., 2014; Honeyman et al., 2014) , is specific to FLC (Dinh et al., 2017; Graham et al., 2015; Kastenhuber et al., 2017) , and is sufficient to drive liver tumor formation in mice (Engelholm et al., 2017; Kastenhuber et al., 2017) . Multiple groups have performed genome-scale analyses to identify dysregulated genes (Cornella et al., 2014; Dinh et al., 2017; Griffith et al., 2016; Malouf et al., 2014; Simon et al., 2015; Sorenson et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2014) , long non-coding RNAs (Dinh et al., 2017) , and microRNAs (Dinh et al., 2019; Farber et al., 2018) in FLC. Yet, little is known about the causative transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that lead to aberrant gene expression and FLC tumor formation.\n\nPrecise spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression is essential to many biological processes. One class of cis-regulatory elements that plays a major role in transcriptional regulation of gene expression is enhancers. Enhancers are classically defined as stretches of non-coding DNA that promote transcription of target gene(s) irrespective of genomic context, orientation, and, to a substantial extent, distance as well (Blackwood and Kadonaga, 1998) . Enhancers are often cell-type specific, allowing precise spatiotemporal control of gene transcription in different cell types within an organism (Heintzman et al., 2009; Nord et al., 2013) . Recent work suggests that there are at least tens of thousands of active enhancers in any given cell type (Dunham et al., 2012) . Active enhancers serve as binding sites for transcription factors, transcriptional coactivators, and RNA polymerase and are thought to interact with their cognate promoters through three-dimensional looping, explaining their ability to act over long distances (Long et al., 2016) .\n\nRecent studies have shown that active enhancers are transcribed to produce enhancer RNAs (eRNAs; Kim et al., 2010; De Santa et al., 2010) . Genome-wide identification of enhancers by detection of eRNAs has recently become possible by coupling nascent transcription (run-on) assays with high throughput sequencing (e.g., global run-on [GRO-seq] and precision run-on sequencing [PRO-seq] ). GRO-seq (Core et al., 2008) and PRO-seq (Kwak et al., 2013) require isolation of cellular nuclei making the application of these methods to primary tissue extraordinarily difficult. To overcome this limitation, chromatin run-on sequencing (ChRO-seq), was developed to extend the technique and permit analysis of primary fresh or frozen tissue (Chu et al., 2018) . Additionally, the advent of a sister technique called length extension ChRO-seq (leChRO-seq) permits investigation of samples with degraded RNA (Chu et al., 2018) . These technical advances finally enable the study of nascent transcription at enhancer, promoter, and gene loci in fresh or archived primary human tumor tissues. ChRO-seq was recently successfully used to identify distinct transcriptional programs in different subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme (Chu et al., 2018) .\n\nHere, we perform ChRO-seq in primary FLC and matched nonmalignant liver (NML) samples. As FLC is a rare adolescent cancer, we\n\nIn order to identify TREs that are more actively transcribed in FLC relative to NML, we quantified ChRO-seq reads within each TRE across all samples and used the DESeq2 algorithm (Love et al., 2014) to perform differential transcription analysis ( Fig. 2A) . This approach led to the identification of 6824 TREs that are significantly more actively transcribed in FLC (Fig. 2B ,C; FDR < 0.05, log2(fold change) > 0). We refer to these as FLC-specific TREs. We also identified 1317 NMLspecific TREs. Most FLC-and NML-specific TREs are located in intronic, intergenic, and TSS regions and do not show major differences in TRE length (Fig S2A,B) .\n\nTranscription factor motif enrichment analysis of conditionspecific TREs using HOMER (Heinz et al., 2010) revealed significant enrichment in FLC-specific TREs for motifs of FOSL2/JUN (AP-1) and CREB (Fig. 2D) , both of which are activated by MAPK signaling. Similar analysis of NML-specific TREs showed enrichment for HNF4A motifs (Table S3) . Additionally, analysis of the promoters of genes nearest to FLC-specific TREs using the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT, McLean et al., 2010) revealed the most significant enrichment for motifs of CREB family members ATF2, CREB1, and ATF3, as well as JUN (Fig. 2E ). Separate examination of FLC-specific promoters (proximal TREs) and enhancers (distal TREs) revealed promoter enrichment of E2F6, MYB, and FOSL1 (Fig. 2F , Table S3 ) and enhancer enrichment of FOSL2/JUN and CREB (Fig. 2G ). We found that 2129 (38.2%) FLC-specific enhancers contain FOSL2/JUN motifs and 1090 (19.6%) contain CREB motifs. FLC- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 specific TREs that did not contain FOSL2/JUN or CREB motifs were enriched in HES2 and SOX1 motifs (Table S3 ). Our results suggest that FLC is characterized by an aberrant map of regulatory elements that is strongly associated with transcription factors from the CREB, AP-1 families, E2F, and MYB families.\n\nIn order to determine which genes are regulated by FLC-specific TREs, we first defined a genomic window around each TSS. As most promoterenhancer interactions occur within a few hundred kilobases (Javierre et al., 2016) , we defined a 100 kb window upstream and downstream of each gene's TSS. Next, we quantified the number of FLC-specific enhancers within each window (Fig. 3A) . As anticipated, we observed that genes with more FLC-specific enhancers in their windows are more highly transcribed in FLC than NML compared to genes with fewer FLCspecific enhancers in their windows (Fig. 3B) . However, it is important to note that only some of the enhancers within a gene's window are likely to regulate that gene. We address this point more quantitatively later in the manuscript. We next ranked genes actively transcribed in FLC (ChRO-seq: TPM \u00b3 25) according to the number of FLC-specific enhancers in their windows. The top ranked gene from this analysis is SLC16A14 (Fig. 3C , Table S4 ). We also observed that CA12 and LINC00473, two genes that are overexpressed in FLC (Dinh et al., 2017) , have very high densities of FLC-specific enhancers. Since we had discovered that motifs of both FOSL2/JUN and CREB are enriched in FLC-specific TREs (Fig. 2D) , we next focused on target genes of these transcription factors in FLC. Specifically, we ranked genes by the density of FLC-specific enhancers that contain one or more FOSL2/JUN or CREB motifs. On the basis of these criteria, SLC16A14 has the highest density of FLC-specific enhancers containing FOSL2/JUN motifs (Fig. 3D ). CA12 is also highly ranked in this version of the analysis. TNRC6C and LINC00473 have the highest and second highest density of FLC-specific enhancers containing CREB motifs, respectively (Fig. 3E) .\n\nNext, we found that genes with at least one nearby FLCspecific enhancer containing either a FOSL2/JUN or CREB motif are over-represented in the MAPK signaling pathway (KEGG 2016, p=0 .032, Fisher's exact test) and significantly enriched for MAPK1 (ERK2) targets and interacting proteins (PPI Hub Proteins, p=5.4 \u00b4 10 -6 , Fisher's exact test). We then ranked genes according to the density of FLC-specific enhancers containing both FOSL2/JUN and CREB motifs Tables showing  results of transcription factor motif enrichment in FLC-specific TREs compared to non-FLC-specific TREs (D), FLC-specific promoters compared to non-FLCspecific promoters (F), and FLC-specific enhancers compared to non-FLCspecific enhancers (G). Full results are shown in Table S3 . (E) GREAT analysis of predicted promoter motifs in genes associated with FLC-specific TREs. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.18.911297 doi: bioRxiv preprint (Fig. 3F) , and observed that genes with at least one nearby FLC-specific enhancer containing both FOSL2/JUN and CREB motifs are enriched for MAPK1 and MAPK3 (ERK1) targets and interacting proteins (Fig. 3G ). Taken together, these results suggest that the regulation of genes such as CA12, SLC16A14, and LINC00473 by FLC-specific enhancers may be mediated through FOSL2/JUN and CREB and that these transcription factors may contribute to and/or result from dysregulated MAPK signaling.\n\nOur gene window analyses (Fig. 3) identified genes that may be regulated by FLC-specific enhancers. However, nearby genes may have the same TREs within their windows. In order to more confidently link individual FLC-specific enhancers with putative gene targets, we correlated enhancer activity to gene transcription levels across all FLC tumors, as described previously (Corces et al., 2018) . ChRO-seq allows us to quantify both enhancer activity and gene transcription from a single experimental dataset, thereby avoiding confounding variables that can arise when using multiple different assays. Correlations between transcriptional activity of enhancers and genes within 100 kb of each other were compared to a null distribution of inter-chromosomal enhancer-gene pairs to calculate p-values (Fig. 4A ,B). Windows larger and smaller than 100 kb had reduced power to detect statistically significant gene-enhancer correlations (Fig. S3A ). Using an FDR < 0.1, we linked 1697 FLC-specific enhancers to putative target genes ( Fig.  4B ,C). As expected, we observed that the frequency of predicted geneenhancer links decreases with increasing distance between them (Fig.  4D ). We found that most enhancers are linked to only one or two genes (mean = 1.33, Fig. 4E ) and most genes are linked to only one or two enhancers (mean = 1.78, Fig. 4F ). The top 5% of genes (in terms of enhancer connectivity) are each linked to at least 4 enhancers (Fig. 4G , Table S5 ). The top 5% includes FAM19A5, LINC00473, VCAN, SLC16A14 (Fig. 4H ) and CA12 (Fig. 4I) , which are putatively linked to 20, 9, 9, 9, Fig. S4 ; Table S6 ). Interestingly, while CA12 is not highly transcribed in NML, there is a substantial amount of ChRO-seq signal at the promoter (Fig. 4I) , indicative of polymerase pausing. This is unlike what we observe at the SLC16A14 locus (Fig. 4H) , where there is no ChRO-seq signal in NML even at the TSS. This observation suggests that transcriptional pausing may be another mechanism that regulates CA12 expression. Therefore, CA12 may be poised for expression, whereas the SLC16A14 locus is completely inactive in NML and dramatically rewired for activation in FLC.\n\nSuper enhancers are non-coding regions exhibiting unusually high transcriptional activity Lov\u00e9n et al., 2013; Pott and Lieb, 2015; Whyte et al., 2013) and are important regulators of cell identity Whyte et al., 2013) and key cancer genes Lov\u00e9n et al., 2013) . We used an algorithm analogous to ones previously used to define super enhancers from chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) data (Lov\u00e9n et al., 2013; Whyte et al., 2013) to identify clusters of enhancers that have remarkably high transcriptional activity in FLC, but not in NML (Fig. 5A , see Materials and Methods). Using FLC-specific enhancers as input, we identified 141 dense clusters with especially high FLC-specific transcriptional activity (Fig. 5B ). Because these loci consist of only FLCspecific enhancers instead of all enhancers present in FLC, we refer to them as \"FLC-specific enhancer hotspots\" rather than FLC super enhancers.\n\nAs super enhancers have been shown to regulate key cancer drivers (Lov\u00e9n et al., 2013) , we linked each FLC-specific enhancer hotspot to the closest gene that is both robustly transcribed (ChRO-seq: TPM \u00b3 25) and significantly increased in transcription (ChRO-seq: FDR < 0.05, log2fold change \u00b3 1) in FLC compared to NML. Several of these genes have been consistently linked to FLC, including CA12, SLC16A14, LINC00473, OAT, TMEM163, and TNRC6C. Others, such as FAM19A5, have not previously been reported as dysregulated in FLC and represent novel candidate oncogenes. Enrichment analysis of genes linked to FLCspecific enhancer hotspots revealed significant over-representation in the Computationally predicted gene-enhancer links, FLC-specific TREs, CREB motifs within FLCspecific TREs (blue), and FOSL2/JUN motifs within FLC-specific TREs (green) are shown below the gene diagram. FLC-specific TREs containing CREB motifs are shown in blue, those containing FOSL2/JUN motifs in green, those containing both CREB and FOSL2/JUN motifs in purple, and all others in black. Transcriptional signal from the plus and minus strand are shown in red and grey, respectively. FLC and NML show similar levels of paused polymerase for CA12 (peak at TSS), but FLC has significantly more gene body transcription.

Correlation analysis using the ARCHS4 database (Lachmann et al., 2018) demonstrated that these genes are also strongly linked to JUN expression (Fig. 5E ). This finding is consistent with our previous analysis that JUN may be critical for the transcriptional regulation of these genes.\n\nTo determine the uniqueness of the FLC-specific enhancer hotspots, we compared them to previously identified super enhancers in SEdb (Jiang et al., 2019) . This database contains 325,607 super enhancers from more than 540 human samples across over 240 cell and tissue types, including 14 from normal human liver, primary hepatocytes, and multiple cell lines including HepG2 and Huh7. We found that 10 FLC-specific enhancer hotspots are not present in any sample in SEdb. Notably, this includes those linked to SLC16A14 and FAM19A5 (Fig. 5F ,G; Table S5 ), indicating that the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of these genes may be unique in FLC. FLC-specific enhancer hotspots associated with LINC00473 and CA12 showed minimal intersection with super enhancers in SEdb (Fig. 5G) , overlapping 12 and 37 super enhancers, respectively. Additionally, 72 FLC-specific enhancer hotspots, including those associated with LINC00473 and CA12, did not overlap with super enhancers from any of the 14 liver-derived samples, which include healthy liver and hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.\n\nTo further investigate the uniqueness of the 10 FLC-specific enhancer hotspots not present in SEdb, we cross-referenced these enhancer hotspots to individual enhancers identified by the ENCODE, FANTOM5, and NIH Roadmap Epigenomics consortia (see Materials and Methods). Only one FLC-specific enhancer hotspot (located near MRC1) did not overlap any individual enhancers recorded in the three databases mentioned above, suggesting this enhancer hotspot is truly unique to FLC (Fig. 5H ). We also recalculated the signal for the same 10 FLC-specific super enhancers including only those individual enhancers that do not overlap with any enhancers from the three databases. Only the revised stitched enhancers close to MRC1 and SLC16A14 exhibited enough transcriptional activity (ChRO-seq signal) to still meet the threshold set in our original analysis for an enhancer hotspot. These results suggest that there is a substantial amount of enhancer activity that is potentially completely unique to FLC at the MRC1 and SLC16A14 loci.\n\nThe genes significantly correlated with FLC-specific enhancers and those significantly associated with FLC-specific enhancer hotspots represent those genes that likely drive key oncogenic attributes of FLC cells. To further refine this list and identify high-confidence candidates, we integrated our ChRO-seq results with RNA-seq data from 23 FLC samples (Table S1 , S6), ten of which also underwent ChRO-seq analysis. We first selected genes that were identified as both significantly correlated with FLC-specific enhancers ( Fig. 4G ) and linked to FLCspecific enhancer hotspots (Fig. 5B ). These genes were then filtered to identify genes that are both highly transcribed (ChRO-seq: TPM \u00b3 25, fold change \u00b3 5, FDR < 0.2) and expressed (RNA-seq: normalized counts \u00b3 100, fold change \u00b3 5, FDR < 0.2) in FLC relative to NML. Integration of both ChRO-seq and RNA-seq data ensures that the transcriptional changes of these genes are maintained at the steady state RNA level. The final list harbored 16 genes (Fig. 6A , Table S6 ). We noticed that over half of these genes have been previously implicated in drug resistance (CA12, COL4A1, HSPA1B, IRF4, KIF26B, LINC00473, SLC16A14, TESC, and VCAN) and 10 of them are connected to elevated MAPK/ERK activity (BACE2, CA12, COL4A1, FAM19A5, HSPA1B, IRF4, KIF26B, LINC00473, TESC, and VCAN; Table S6 ).\n\nWe selected eight of these genes (CA12, FAM19A5, HSPA1B, LINC00473, OAT, SLC16A14, TESC, and VCAN) for further investigation. We chose SLC16A14 and LINC00473 because they have high densities of FLC-specific enhancers with FOSL2/JUN (Fig. 3D ) and CREB motifs (Fig. 3E ), respectively; FAM19A5 because it has the greatest number of significantly correlated enhancers (Fig. 4G) ; TESC and VCAN because they have previously been strongly implicated in drug resistance Li et al., 2017; Man et al., 2014) , a salient feature of FLC (Maniaci et al., 2009; Torbenson, 2012) ; CA12 and OAT The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.18.911297 doi: bioRxiv preprint because we have previously identified them as candidate markers of FLC (Dinh et al., 2017) and because CA12 is a prominent mediator of drug resistance in other cancer types (Boyd et al., 2017; Doyen et al., 2013; Kopecka et al., 2016; Yoo et al., 2010) ; and HSPA1B because it encodes a member of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family, which has been shown to interact with the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion found in FLC . We also selected one gene that only appears in the FLC-specific enhancer hotspot analysis (RPS6KA2) and another from the gene-enhancer correlation (FZD10) analysis for further investigation (Fig. 6A) .\n\nWe compared the expression of these genes in FLC to other cancer types within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and found that SLC16A14 is more highly expressed in FLC than any other cancer type (Fig. S5) . FAM19A5, LINC00473, CA12, TESC, and VCAN are also highly expressed in FLC, in addition to several other cancer types within TCGA (Fig. S5) . We also compared SLC16A14 expression in FLC compared to normal tissues within the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database and found substantially higher levels of SLC16A14 in FLC than any other normal tissue (Fig. S5H) .\n\nSLC16A14, CA12, LINC00473, RPS6KA2, and VCAN are responsive to DNAJB1-PRKACA While the genes we selected are over-transcribed (Fig. 6B ) and overexpressed ( Fig. 6C ) in FLC relative to NML, it is unclear whether this dysregulation is directly caused by the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion. To determine whether the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion is sufficient to perturb these genes of interest, we took advantage of two murine models of FLC. In the first model, a transposon expressing human DNAJB1-PRKACA is introduced into the livers of C57BL/6 mice by hydrodynamic tail vein injection, forming FLC-like liver tumors (Kastenhuber et al., 2017) . We examined the expression of our genes of interest in the resulting liver tumors compared to livers from mice injected with an empty vector control. Car12 (the mouse homolog of human CA12) and Slc16a14 displayed significantly higher expression of samples expressing DNAJB1-PRKACA compared to control (Fig. 6D ). The second model is the AML12 cell line that has undergone CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, resulting in a heterozygous deletion analogous to the endogenous event in humans, leading to the formation of the Dnajb1-Prkaca fusion (Dinh et al., 2019; Turnham et al., 2019) . When we examined the expression of the genes of interest in AML12 cells expressing Dnajb1-Prkaca, we found that Car12 and Slc16a14, as well as Rps6ka2 and Vcan, are significantly elevated compared to wild-type (WT) controls (Fig. 6E) .\n\nAs LINC00473 is a primate-specific lncRNA (Reitmair et al., 2012) , we used an alternative non-murine model to study its regulation. Specifically, we stably over-expressed the fusion in the HepG2 human hepatoma cell line using a lentiviral system. DNAJB1-PRKACA expression dramatically increased LINC00473 expression compared to an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) control (Fig. 6F) . WT PRKACA also increased LINC00473 expression. However, the magnitude of LINC00473 induction was significantly larger with the fusion compared to WT PRKACA, indicating that something other than canonical PKA activity (possibly the DNAJB1 domain) is relevant for robust induction of LINC00473. Importantly, stable expression of a kinase-dead mutant of DNAJB1-PRKACA (K128H) did not increase LINC00473 expression (Fig. 6F) , indicating that the kinase activity of the fusion is necessary for induction of expression. To determine if LINC00473 might be responsive to PKA fusions in other contexts, we examined a cholangiocarcinoma dataset (Nakamura et al., 2015) that characterized tumors with fusions involving PRKACA or PRKACB with ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit beta 1 (ATP1B1). Interestingly, the exons of PRKACA retained in the ATP1B1-PRKACA fusion are the same as in DNAJB1-PRKACA. Using RNA-seq data generated for this dataset, we examined the relationship between PKA fusions and the expression of LINC00473. Tumors with PKA fusions demonstrated significantly higher expression of LINC00473 than tumors without PKA fusions (Fig.  6G) , indicating that LINC00473 is responsive to PKA activity in alternative fusion events. Our results suggest that DNAJB1-PRKACA is sufficient to perturb the expression of CA12, SLC16A14, VCAN, RPS6KA2, and LINC00473 in the specific disease models we used and that this regulation is dependent upon (at least for LINC00473) the kinase activity of DNAJB1-PRKACA. Top genes associated with FLCspecific enhancer hotspots (n=47) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.18.911297 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nOur results thus far suggest that MAPK signaling regulates FLC pathogenesis (Fig. 3G, 5C,D) . To confirm that MAPK signaling is overactive in FLC, we measured the levels of phosphorylated MEK and ERK in WT and Dnajb1-Prkaca-expressing AML12 cells (Fig. 7A,B) . As expected, we observed dramatically increased phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK in cells expressing the fusion compared to WT cells. Treatment of AML12 cells expressing Dnajb1-Prkaca with the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib resulted in a dose-responsive decrease in cell viability (Fig. 7C-F) . Both SLC16A14 and CA12 (Car12), which we identified as prominent FLC-enhancer-hotspot associated genes, have been implicated in drug resistance in other cancers (Doyen et al., 2013; Januchowski et al., 2014; Kopecka et al., 2016) , and CA12 has been reported previously as a mediator of the effects of the MAPK pathway (Hsieh et al., 2010) . Knockdown of Slc16a14 by siRNA dramatically reduced viability of AML12 cells expressing Dnajb1-Prkaca, and also increased the potency of cobimetinib (Fig. 7C,D) . Knockdown of Car12 did not have much of an effect on its own, but in combination with cobimetinib did significantly reduce cell viability compared to cobimetinib alone (Fig. 7E,F, Fig. S6A ).\n\nWe next tested whether inhibition of MAPK signaling reduces viability of human FLC tumor cells. First, we derived a primary human FLC cell line from a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model by optimizing previously described protocols (Dinh et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2017, see Materials and Methods) . Treatment with cobimetinib reduced ERK phosphorylation as expected (Fig. 7G) , and significantly decreased FLC cell viability (Fig. 7H ), but only at higher doses of the drug. This effect was confirmed across three distinct derivations of the FLC cell line (Fig. 7H, Fig. S6B ), each of which was positive for DNAJB1-PRKACA expression. Our results suggest that FLC cells are susceptible to MAPK inhibition, however the doses needed for a cytotoxic effect indicate an intrinsic level of drug resistance in these cells.\n\nWe hypothesized that inhibition of CA12 in FLC cells may mitigate the intrinsic drug resistance because of the results in the AML12 cells expressing Dnajb1-Prkaca (Fig. 7E) and because an effective CA12 inhibitor, SLC-0111, is currently in clinical trials as combination therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer. We found that pharmacological suppression of CA12 with SLC-0111 in FLC cells significantly enhances the potency of cobimetinib at the 500 nM dose (Fig. 7H, Fig. S6B ). Again, this effect was confirmed across three distinct derivations of the FLC cell line. We quantified the interaction between cobimetinib and SLC-0111 using the combination index (CI). SLC-0111 and cobimetinib combination treatment resulted in a synergistic response (CI = 0.00686 (0.5 \u00b5M cobimetinib + 100 \u00b5M SLC-0111) and 0.000791 (0.5 \u00b5M cobimetinib + 200 \u00b5M SLC-0111) in FLC2, where CI < 1 indicates synergy). To determine whether CA12 interacts with the MAPK signaling pathway, we inhibited either MEK or CA12. Cobimetinib treatment resulted in decreased ERK phosphorylation as expected, but had no effect on CA12 expression (Fig. 7G) . However, treatment with SLC-0111 reduced phosphorylated MEK and ERK levels (Fig. 7J) , suggesting that CA12 may function, at least in part, upstream of the MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that the MAPK signaling pathway is dysregulated in FLC and inhibition of this pathway in combination with pharmacological suppression of CA12 or inhibition of SLC16A14 represent exciting candidate molecular therapeutic approaches.\n\nFibrolamellar carcinoma is a devastating cancer affecting young adults with limited treatment options. Thus, there remains a great need to identify potential therapeutic targets. Here we have analyzed primary FLC tumors and matched NML samples to map the unique enhancer landscape of FLC. One of the goals of this study was to discover master regulators of dysregulated gene expression and signaling in FLC. We took advantage of the new technique (le)ChRO-seq (Chu et al., 2018) , which allowed us to perform run-on sequencing on frozen primary tumors. A notable advantage of (le)ChRO-seq is that it allows quantification of both enhancer activity and gene transcription from a single experiment, thereby avoiding possible confounders associated with using multiple different assays.\n\nOur finding that FLC-specific TREs are enriched in motifs of FOSL2/JUN and CREB is noteworthy for several reasons. First, CREB is a well-validated substrate of wild-type PKA (Shaywitz and Greenberg, 1999) and has previously been shown to be hyperphosphorylated in FLC compared to adjacent liver (Xu et al., 2014) . Second, CREB The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.18.911297 doi: bioRxiv preprint transcriptionally activates LINC00473 (Chen et al., 2016 (Chen et al., , 2018 Reitmair et al., 2012) and represses miR-375 (Keller et al., 2012) , the latter of which is a candidate tumor suppressor in FLC (Dinh et al., 2019) . Third, CREB and AP-1, a heterodimer consisting of FOS and JUN subunits, have been shown to regulate each other (Ma et al., 2014; Sanyal et al., 2002) . Finally, CREB and AP-1 are both activated by the MAPK signaling pathway (Ginty et al., 1994; Karin, 1995; Wu et al., 2001; Xing et al., 1996) , which is dysregulated in FLC .\n\nOur analysis reveals that transcription at distal TREs (i.e. enhancers) stratify FLC from NML samples better than transcription at proximal TREs or gene bodies, similar to previous reports (Corces et al., 2016 (Corces et al., , 2018 . These findings are consistent with other studies (Franco et al., 2018; Van Groningen et al., 2017; Ooi et al., 2016) that have shown enhancer activity is more sensitive than gene expression for sample classification (e.g., tumor-normal, tumor subtypes, cell types). Unlike other methods to identify enhancers, such as assay for transposaseaccessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) or chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) for enhancer-associated histone modifications or proteins, ChRO-seq identifies active regulatory elements as well as actively transcribed genes. This advantage allowed us to correlate enhancer and gene transcription within the same assay, as well as to provide a more direct output of enhancer function (transcription) than steady state RNA levels, which reflect cumulative effects of transcriptional, co-transcriptional, and post-transcriptional regulatory processes.\n\nTo identify putative targets of FLC-specific enhancers, we employed computational approaches based on enhancer density and signal correlation. We identified 141 FLC-specific enhancer hotspots, defined as dense clusters of enhancers with especially high transcriptional activity (similar to the concept of super enhancers). Comparing these loci with previously characterized super enhancers in SEdb, we found that 10 FLC-specific enhancer hotspots are completely unique and do not overlap with any known super enhancer. Furthermore, 72 of the enhancer hotspots do not overlap with super enhancers from any previously assayed liver tissue or liver-derived cells. As super enhancers have been shown to regulate cell identity and oncogenes Lov\u00e9n et al., 2013) , our findings suggest that these FLC-specific enhancer hotspots may regulate genes important in the formation, progression, and/or maintenance of this cancer. Super enhancers are regulated by the bromodomain protein BRD4 (Lov\u00e9n et al., 2013) , and BRD4 inhibitors such as JQ1 (Filippakopoulos et al., 2010) have been shown to disrupt super enhancer function (Gryder et al., 2017; Lov\u00e9n et al., 2013; Mack et al., 2018; Peeters et al., 2015) . Pharmacological disruption of the FLC-specific enhancer hotspots we have described here may represent an alternative therapeutic approach for FLC.\n\nWe have computationally identified gene-enhancer interactions in this study. However, future experiments will be important to confirm these interactions experimentally and carefully dissect the 3-D regulatory interactions in FLC. For example, methods based on chromosome conformation capture, such as Hi-C, can identify and confirm global chromosomal interactions, while methods based on luciferase assays, such as self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) or other massively parallel reporter assays, can validate the regulatory activity of identified enhancers. More refined dissection of individual or subsets of enhancers using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing will confirm functional gene-enhancer links and identify the specific nucleotides within enhancers that are essential for such regulation. Furthermore, our ChRO-seq experiments were conducted with primary tumors, which contain a heterogenous mixture of cells. Our results therefore represent the aggregate results across all cell types present. Going forward, single cell experiments will be necessary to dissect the role of transcriptional regulatory networks in tumor, immune, parenchymal, and other cell types within primary tumors.\n\nIntegrative analyses of ChRO-seq and RNA-seq data identified 16 high-confidence candidate oncogenes in FLC. Some of these genes, including LINC00473 and CA12 have been characterized in other cancers previously. LINC00473 is known to be overexpressed in FLC (Dinh et al., 2017) and other cancers (Chen et al., 2016 (Chen et al., , 2018 Shi et al., 2017) , and promotes chemotherapeutic resistance in colon cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Han et al., 2018) . CA12 has been linked to drug resistance in multiple cancer types (Boyd et al., 2017; Doyen et al., 2013; Kopecka et al., 2016) and we have previously demonstrated that it is overexpressed in FLC (Dinh et al., 2017) . Other genes, including SLC16A14 and FAM19A5, are relatively understudied and merit deeper investigation.\n\nHarnessing well-characterized inhibitors of some of these genes may represent a potentially expedient avenue for new FLC therapeutics. One notable example is an inhibitor of CA12, SLC-0111, currently in clinical trials for metastatic pancreatic cancer (see below). Most of the genes we identified here are not currently targeted by drugs or inhibitors; nonetheless, alternative strategies exist to target cells uniquely expressing these genes. Drugs conjugated to antibodies or aptamers that can bind to cell surface proteins that are specific to cells of interest, such as SLC16A14 in FLC cells, represent an emerging strategy for targeting tumor cells. Examination of SLC16A14 expression in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database demonstrated substantially higher expression in FLC tumors than any other normal tissue, indicating that it may be a useful molecular beacon for such approaches. For non-cell surface proteins, this method can be modified by engineering T-cells that recognize the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presenting specific peptides from the protein of interest. Leveraging the knowledge gained in this study to develop new targeted therapeutic approaches remains an important goal.\n\nOur analyses show that a large proportion of the genes that are associated with FLC-specific enhancers function in drug resistance, including LINC00473 (Han et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) , VCAN (Li et al., 2017) , and CA12 (Boyd et al., 2017; Doyen et al., 2013; Kopecka et al., 2016; Yoo et al., 2010) . This suggests that high expression of these genes may be responsible for the strong drug resistance phenotype observed in FLC. Thus, a viable therapeutic strategy to combat drug resistance may be to combine inhibitors of drug resistance genes with presently available therapeutics. For example, ongoing clinical trials for metastatic pancreatic cancer are focused on combining SLC-0111, a CA12 inhibitor, with the standard therapeutic gemcitabine (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03450018).\n\nIn addition, we have demonstrated that CA12, SLC16A14, VCAN, and RPSK6A2 are responsive to DNAJB1-PRKACA in at least one of two different genetically engineered murine models of FLC. However, we did not notice a significant induction of expression for several of the other FLC enhancer-hotspot associated genes that we tested, even though they are over-expressed in primary FLC tumors. There are several possible explanations for this observation. First, the murine models we used might have species-specific differences in gene regulation compared to human. Second, these genes might not be directly downstream of DNAJB1-PRKACA, but induced due to another process during tumor initiation or progression. For example, certain genes may be induced during or in response to the development of tumor fibrosis within FLC tumors. Although this is a distinctive feature of primary human FLCs, current mouse models lack this characteristic, providing a possible explanation for the observed differences. While this is indicative of a critical need for better model systems, our results using two murine models suggest that at least CA12, SLC16A14, VCAN, and RPS6KA2 are responsive to DNAJB1-PRKACA. Alternative models may be necessary . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi. org/10.1101 org/10. /2020 to study the remaining genes. For example, since LINC00473 is a primate-specific lncRNA, we used the HepG2 cell line stably expressing DNAJB1-PRKACA to demonstrate LINC00473 is responsive to the fusion.\n\nFinally, we demonstrated that the MAPK signaling pathway is dysregulated in FLC. While the cell line we have derived and used here is, to our knowledge, the only published FLC cell line, it is not without its limitations. As the FLC cells are derived from a PDX model and can be co-cultured with irradiated mouse fibroblasts, we observe a murine component in each derived cell line (see Materials and Methods). However, experiments across multiple cell line derivations with varying degrees of murine component produced similar results (Fig. 7H,I, Fig.  S6B ,C). These observations underscore the need for additional models of FLC, including new cell lines. The cell lines described here are all derived from the only published FLC PDX model (Oikawa et al., 2015) , therefore derivations from additional PDX models will be important as they become available. In each cell line derivation, inhibition of the MAPK pathway significantly reduced cell viability, but most effectively in the micromolar range, suggesting these cells exhibit intrinsic drug resistance similar to what has been reported in patients. Combination treatment of MEK inhibitor with the CA12 inhibitor SLC-0111 resulted in enhanced potency compared to MEK inhibitor alone indicating that CA12 inhibition in combination with additional therapeutics might be a viable treatment strategy for FLC. Importantly, inhibitors targeting multiple members of the MAPK cascade are in clinical use for the treatment of other cancers and SLC-0111 is currently in clinical trials for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Repurposing these therapeutics for FLC patients may provide more effective treatments than the limited options currently available. Although we have demonstrated that inhibition of CA12 enhances the potency of MEK inhibitors, inhibition of other FLC enhancer hotspot-associated genes that are potentially involved in drug resistance, such as SLC16A14, TESC, or VCAN, may provide additional therapeutic benefit. Indeed, knockdown of Slc16a14 in AML12 cells expressing Dnajb1-Prkaca both enhances the potency of cobimetinib and demonstrates substantial cytotoxic activity alone.\n\nIn sum, we have used ChRO-seq to map the transcriptional and enhancer landscape of FLC. The genome-scale information provided by ChRO-seq allowed us to identify candidate master transcriptional regulators of FLC and novel candidate FLC oncogenes, demonstrating the power of such genomic approaches. Follow-up functional studies in AML12 cells expressing Dnajb1-Prkaca and a newly derived human FLC cell culture revealed new candidate therapeutic strategies for FLC.\n\nFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Praveen Sethupathy (pr46@cornell.edu).\n\nInformed consent was obtained from all human subjects. Samples were collected according to Institutional Review Board protocols 1802007780, 1811008421 (Cornell University) and/or 33970/1 (Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation) and provided by the Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation. Importantly, some samples come from the same patient (Table S2 ).\n\nSamples from C57BL/6N mice were obtained for a previous study (Dinh et al., 2019) and remaining samples were used for this study. Briefly, female 6-10 week old C57BL/6N mice were subjected to hydrodynamic tail-vein injection with sterile 0.9% NaCl and 20 \u00b5g transposon and CMB-SB13 transposase (1:5 molar ratio). The transposon plasmid expressed human DNAJB1-PRKACA or an empty control. 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC, 0.1%) diet was administered after tail-vein injection.\n\nHepG2 expressing DNAJB1-PRKACA and EGFP have been previously described (Dinh et al., 2019) . HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) containing 1 g/L glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The DNAJB1-PRKACA K128H kinase-dead mutant was cloned using the QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) using the following primers (5'-CCTTCTGTTTGTCGAGGATATGCATGGCATAGTGGTTCCCG-3' and 5'-CGGGAACCACTATGCCATGCATATCCTCGACAAACAGAAGG-3'). PCR products were cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subcloned into the pLV-EF1a-IRES-Puro vector (Addgene plasmid #85132, gift from Tobias Meyer). For lentivirus production, HEK293/T17 cells were transfected with DNAJB1-PRKACA K128H plasmid along with psPAX2 (Addgene plasmid #12260, gift from Didier Trono) and pMD2.G (Addgene plasmid #12259, gift from Didier Trono) to produce lentiviral particles, which were concentrated using Lentiviral-X Concentration (Takara Bio USA, Mountain View, CA) per manufacturer's protocol. HepG2 cells were transduced with varying concentrations of lentivirus for 24 hours and selected with 2 \u00b5g/mL puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 4 days. Selectable cells treated with the lowest concentration of virus were used for further passaging and experiments to obtain a majority of cells with 1 viral integration.\n\nWT AML12 cells and AML12 cells expressing the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion have been previously described (Dinh et al., 2019; . They were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.04 \u00b5g/mL dexamethasone, 0.1% gentamicin, 1 \u00b5g/mL recombinant human insulin, 0.55 \u00b5g/mL human transferrin, and 0.5 ng/mL sodium selenite. FLC cells were previously described (Dinh et al., 2019) . Lines 3 and 18 were grown in complete F medium according to a previously published protocol (Liu et al., 2017) . Line 2 was grown similarly to lines 3 and 18 with three minor modifications. First, F media was conditioned by irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts for 3 days prior to use. FLC cells were cultured in conditioned F media without irradiated fibroblasts. Second, R-spondin conditioned media was added to complete F media to 10% volume. R-spondin conditioned media was produced by culturing HEK293T cells expressing murine Rspo1 (gift from Alexander Nikitin lab) in conditioning media (DMEM supplemented with 1% GlutaMAX, 1% HEPES, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) for 10 days. The supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter prior to use. Third, the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 was used a final concentration of 20 \u00b5M, increased from the original concentration of 10 \u00b5M (Liu et al., 2017) . We detected the presence of murine cells in all three derived cell lines by RT-qPCR. All cell lines were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.\n\nChRO-seq was performed as previously described (Chu et al., 2018; Mahat et al., 2016) with minor modifications. Length extension ChRO-seq (leChRO-seq) was performed identically to ChRO-seq except where indicated. Chromatin was isolated from pulverized frozen tissue in 1 mL 1X NUN buffer (20 mM HEPES, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.3 M NaCl, 1M urea, 1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 50 units/mL SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, AM2694), 1X Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 11873580001)). For leChRO-seq, 50 units/mL RNase Cocktail Enzyme Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM2286) was substituted for SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor. Samples were vortexed for 1 minute, an additional 500 \u00b5L of 1x NUN buffer was added to each sample, and the samples were vortexed for an additional minute. Samples were incubated in an Eppendorf Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 12\u00b0C and shaking at 2000 rpm for 30 minutes before centrifugation at 12,500 x g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Each sample was washed with 1 mL 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) supplemented with 40 units/mL SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor (80 units/mL for leChRO-seq) and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C. This wash step was repeated twice and samples were stored in 50 \u00b5L of chromatin storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 40 units/mL SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor). Samples were loaded into a Bioruptor (Diagenode, Denville, NJ) and sonicated on the high power setting for a cycle time of 10 minutes, consisting of 10 cycles of 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off. Sonication was repeated as necessary to solubilize the chromatin and samples were stored at -80\u00b0C.\n\nFollowing chromatin isolation, 50 \u00b5L of chromatin was mixed with 50 uL 2X run-on reaction mix ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 Inhibitor, 1% sarkosyl). The run-on reaction was performed at 37\u00b0C for 5 minutes at 700 rpm and stopped by adding 500 \u00b5L Trizol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10296-010) to the reaction. RNA samples were precipitated and resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water, heat treated at 65\u00b0C for 40 seconds, and digested on ice with 0.2N NaOH for 4 minutes. Base hydrolysis by NaOH was excluded from leChRO-seq protocols. Nascent RNA was purified with streptavidin beads (New England Biolabs (NEB), Ipswich, MA, S1421S) as previously described (Chu et al., 2018; Mahat et al., 2016) . RNA was purified from beads using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596-026) and 3' adaptor ligation was performed with T4 RNA Ligase 1 (NEB, M0204S). Streptavidin bead binding was performed again following by 5' decapping with RNA 5' pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH, NEB M0356S). The 5' end of the RNA molecule was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK, NEB M0201S) and 5' adaptor ligation was performed with T4 RNA Ligase 1. The 5' adaptor contained a 6-nucleotide unique molecular identifier (UMI) to allow for bioinformatic detection and elimination of PCR duplicates. Streptavidin bead binding was performed again followed by reverse transcription using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 18090010). cDNA was amplified by PCR using the Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB, M0491S) to generate (le)ChRO-seq libraries. Libraries were sequenced (5' single end) at the Biotechnology Research Center at Cornell University on the NextSeq500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Primer sequences used for (le)ChRO-seq library preparation are provided in Table S8 . \n\nSmall RNA sequencing was performed as previously described (Dinh et al., 2019) . Briefly, reads were trimmed using Cutadapt and mapped to the genome using Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) . Perfectly aligned reads represented miRNA loci and then imperfectly mapped reads (derived from isomiRs) were re-aligned to these loci using SHRiMP (Rumble et al., 2009) . Aligned reads were quantified and normalized using reads per million mapped to miRNAs. Data are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): accession number GSE114974.\n\nRead quality was assessed using FastQC. Adapters were trimmed from the 3' ends of reads using cutadapt 1.16 (Martin, 2013) with a maximum 10% error rate, minimum 2 bp overlap, and minimum 20 quality score. Each read contained a 6 bp UMI enabling PCR deduplication by collapsing UMIs followed by UMI trimming using PRINSEQ lite 0.20.2 (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011) . Processed reads with a minimum length of 15 bp were mapped to the hg38 genome modified with the addition of a single copy of the human Pol I ribosomal RNA complete repeating unit (GenBank U13369.1) with BWA 0.7.13 (Li and Durbin, 2010) using the BWA-backtrack algorithm. Each read was represented by a single base at the 5' end of the read, corresponding to the 5' end of the nascent RNA. Data was converted to bigwig format using bedtools 2.27.1 (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) and UCSC bedGraphToBigWig v4 (Kent et al., 2010) for visualization and identification of TREs. Bigwig files from identical conditions were merged and normalized to a total signal of 1x10 6 prior to visualization.\n\nTo identify TREs across all samples, bigwig files of the same strand from all samples (FLC and NML) were merged. This merged dataset was used to call TREs. TREs from all samples were identified with dREG (Danko et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019) using the peak calling algorithm. Read counts were quantified within each TRE locus using the R package bigwig (https://github.com/andrelmartins/bigWig). Total read counts on the sense and antisense strands within each TRE across all samples were then imported into DESeq2 1.22.2 (Love et al., 2014) . Analysis of TRE counts from ChRO-seq revealed they followed a negative binomial distribution similar to RNA-seq counts. Therefore, differential transcription analysis of TREs was performed with DESeq2 to identify TREs that were significantly differentially transcribed in FLC or NML.\n\nGene definitions were obtained from GENCODE v25 annotations. To avoid counting reads from the paused polymerase peak, ChRO-seq signal was quantified on the sense strand from 500 bp downstream of the gene start until the annotated end of the gene. Genes were eliminated from the analysis if they were shorter than 1000 bp and if they were not protein coding, pseudogene, lincRNA, antisense, or miRNA genes. Like TRE counts, gene body counts from ChRO-seq followed a negative binomial distribution. Therefore, differential transcription analysis of genes was performed using DESeq2.\n\nTRE annotation was performed using the annotatePeaks.pl function from HOMER (Heinz et al., 2010) based on GENCODE v25 annotations. Transcription factor motif enrichment analysis was performed using the findMotifsGenome.pl function from HOMER using \"given\" as the size parameter. The input (and background) peaks run were FLC-specific TREs (all TREs that were not identified as FLCspecific as background), NML-specific TREs (all TREs not identified as NMLspecific), FLC-specific TREs without FOSL2/JUN or CREB motifs (all TREs not identified as FLC-specific), FLC-specific promoters (all promoters not identified as FLC-specific), and FLC-specific enhancers (all enhancers not identified as FLC-specific). CpG island annotations were downloaded from the UCSC Table  Browser. Hierarchical clustering was performed following DESeq2 normalization of read counts quantified from each TRE or gene body as described above. Clustering was performed in a pairwise manner using a correlation-based distance metric (1 -Spearman's rho) using Ward's minimum variance method. Proximal (-1000 to +100 bp from TSS) and distal TREs (the remaining TREs) were classified based on GENCODE v25 transcript annotations. Principal components analysis was performed following Variance Stabilizing Transformation from DESeq2.\n\nTRE functional enrichment analysis was performed using GREAT (McLean et al., 2010) . Briefly, TREs were converted from hg38 into hg19 coordinates using the UCSC liftOver tool. GREAT was run using default parameters (whole genome background, basal plus extension association rule). Gene ontology analyses, including KEGG 2016, ARCHS4, and PPI hub enrichment, were performed using Enrichr (Chen et al., 2013) . Windows for enhancer density and gene-enhancer correlations were defined using gene coordinates based on GENCODE v25 annotations.\n\nFLC-specific enhancer hotspots were identified using a method analogous to those previously described for super enhancers (Lov\u00e9n et al., 2013; Whyte et al., 2013) . First, distal TREs (TREs not overlapping -1000 to +100 bp from any TSS based on GENCODE v25 transcript annotations) were stitched together using a stitching distance of 12.5 kb. Read counts normalized by DESeq2 within each distal TRE were quantified in all samples, averaged for each TRE, and summed for each stitched enhancer. Stitched enhancers were ranked based on cumulative signal and a threshold for super enhancer identification was determined by drawing a line tangent to the signal curve. Stitched enhancers with more signal than the point identified by the tangent line were classified as FLC-specific enhancer hotspots.\n\nCoordinates of known super enhancers were downloaded from SEdb (Jiang et al., 2019;  http://www.licpathway.net/sedb/). ENCODE enhancer coordinates were downloaded from Search Candidate cis-Regulatory Elements by ENCODE (SCREEN, https://screen.wenglab.org/). FANTOM5 enhancer coordinates were downloaded from FANTOM5 (http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/). NIH Roadmap Epigenomics enhancer coordinates were downloaded from Reg2Map: HoneyBadger (https://personal.broadinstitute.org/meuleman/reg2map/HoneyBadger_release/). FANTOM5 data was downloaded in hg38 coordinates. SEdb, ENCODE, and NIH Roadmap data were available and downloaded in hg19 coordinates and converted to hg38 coordinates using the UCSC liftOver tool.\n\nTranscriptional signal was quantified from enhancers and gene bodies as described above. Gene body and enhancer counts were normalized separately using DESeq2 and the Pearson correlation coefficients between the log2(normalized counts + 1) for genes and enhancers were calculated. To determine the statistical significance of the calculated correlation coefficients, we constructed a null distribution that consisted of correlation coefficients from genes and enhancers on different chromosomes. For gene-enhancer pairs within 100 kb of each other, we calculated the empirical p-value based on the null distribution and adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR) procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) .\n\n.

Reads were mapped to the hg38 genome with STAR 2.4.2a (Dobin et al., 2012) . Transcripts were quantified with Salmon 0.8.2 (Patro et al., 2017) using GENCODE v25 transcript annotations. Normalization was performed using DESeq2. TCGA RNA-seq data were downloaded using TCGA-assembler 2 (Wei et al., 2018) as normalized counts. TCGA RNA-seq data for lncRNAs was downloaded from TANRIC (Li et al., 2015) as normalized counts. Cholangiocarcinoma RNA-seq data (Nakamura et al., 2015) was downloaded from the European Genome-Phenome Archive (accession number EGAS00001000950). GTEx Release V7 data was downloaded from the GTEx Portal as gene read counts and normalized with RNA-seq data from primary FLCs using DESeq2. Principal components analysis was performed using the most variable 1000 genes following variance stabilizing transformation (DESeq2).\n\nRead quality was assessed using FastQC. Reads were trimmed, mapped, and quantified to the hg19 genome using miRquant 2.0, our previously described smRNA-seq analysis pipeline (Kanke et al., 2016) . Briefly, reads were trimmed using Cutadapt and reads were mapped to the genome using Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) . Perfectly aligned reads represented miRNA loci and imperfectly mapped reads (from isomiRs) were re-aligned to these loci using SHRiMP (Rumble et al., 2009 ). Aligned reads were quantified and normalized using reads per million mapped to miRNAs (RPMMM).\n\nTotal RNA was isolated using the Total RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek) per manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gene expression was quantified with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time System (Bio-Rad). RNA expression levels were normalized to RPS9. The TaqMan assays used are provided in Table S8 .\n\nProtein lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 (Sigma), 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% \u03b2mercaptoethanol, and 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol. Protein concentration was measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 25 \u00b5g of lysate per lane under denaturing conditions in NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or homemade 12% Bis-Tris gels and transferred to PVDF membranes using a standard wet transfer protocol. Membranes were blocked with 5% dry nonfat milk in TBST and were probed with antibodies. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) was used for detection.\n\nAML12 cells were reverse transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, transfection mixes were assembled in wells by adding 1 pmol of the appropriate siRNA and 0.3 \u00b5L RNAiMAX (96-well plates) or 5 pmol siRNA and 1.5 \u00b5L RNAiMAX (6-well plates) according to manufacturer's protocols. OptiMEM was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. 1,500 cells (96well plates) or 5,000 cells (6-well plates) were plated on top of transfection mixes. Cells were incubated for 24 hours prior to further treatment.\n\nFor AML12 cells seeded in 96-well plates, a series of \u00bd-log unit dilutions of cobimetinib (10 mM stock in DMSO) were made in DMSO at 1000X final desired concentrations. From these stocks, 1:200 dilutions were made in fresh AML12 media. 30 \u00b5l of these starting dilutions was added to appropriate wells using a multi-channel pipettor. This results in a further 1:5 dilution and a final 1:1000 dilution with a final volume of 150 \u00b5l per well. Outer plate wells were filled with media and a no-cells/no-treatment set of wells was included for background. Cell plates were grown for a further 4-5 days. FLC cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3200 cells/well in a volume of 100 \u00b5l per well for CellTiter-Glo (Promega, Madison, WI) assays. The following day, 2X concentrations of drug or DMSO were prepared. 50 \u00b5l of media was removed from each well and 50 \u00b5l of 2X drug or vehicle (final concentration 1X) was added to each well. Cells were incubated for 48 hours before assessing cell viability.\n\nCell viability was assessed by CellTiter-Glo or crystal violet staining. For CellTiter-Glo, 96-well plates were removed from incubator and placed at room temperature for 30 minutes to equilibrate. Room temperature CellTiter-Glo reagent was added and cells were shaken for 2 minutes. Plates were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Luminescence was measured using a POLARStar Omega plate reader (BMG LabTech, Ortenberg, Germany; Em Filter -empty; Gain = 3600, orbital averaging ON, diameter = 5, cycles = 6) or a Synergy 2 Microplate Reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT; area scan; integration time = 0.50 seconds). For crystal violet staining, AML12 cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes. Two water washes were performed and cells were stained with 0.25% crystal violet in 10% methanol for 20 minutes. Finally, three water washes were performed and plates were allowed to dry at room temperature for at least 24 hours. Images were captured with a custom digital photography set-up on a Canon 5D, MkI with a Sigma 150-600 mm lens. To quantify crystal violet staining, dye was dissolved in 10% acetic acid (300 \u00b5l per well). An aliquot was removed to a clear 96-well plate and A590 absorbance was measured using a POLARStar Omega plate reader (BMG LabTech). Signal was kept in the linear range by 1:2 -1:4 dilution with 10% acetic acid where necessary.\n\nRelative quantification values (RQVs) were calculated by normalizing the effect of drug treatment against DMSO controls following CellTiterGlo cell viability experiments. RQVs were generated from 4-12 replicates and were entered as effect values at appropriate drug dosages in single and combination drug treatments in CompuSyn Software using non-constant ratio design parameters. Individual Combination Index values are reported for each dose combination.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R (3.5.0). Statistical significance was primarily determined by two-sided Welch's t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests as indicated in the figure legends. All alternative statistical tests that were used are noted in the text or figure legends. Statistical comparisons between dose response curves were performed using the R package drc (3.0-1) by fitting log-logistic models (with the LL.4 function) to the data. Two models were fit to the data (one with and one without siRNA) and were compared using a F-test (with the anova function) to determine statistical significance. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant unless otherwise noted. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.\n\nSelina Ruzi for assistance in drawing Figure 1A .
