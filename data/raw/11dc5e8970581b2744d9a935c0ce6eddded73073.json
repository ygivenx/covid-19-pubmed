{"title": "", "body": "\u2022 Labored breathing \u2022 Reduced appetite \u2022 Lethargy \u2022 Recent purchase from a pet store PHYSICAL EXAM FINDINGS \u2022 Red staining around the eyes and nostrils, and occasionally the forepaws (from wiping the nares) \u2022 Usually clinical signs are associated with nutritional deficiencies, chronic physiologic stress (e.g., disease), chronic light exposure, or dacryoadenitis.\n\n\u2022 Any disease or condition that results in chronic stress will result in chromodacryorrhea. \u2022 Harderian glands of rodents with \"red tears\" exhibit a variety of histological autofluorescence patterns. In addition, their secretions are also affected by protoporphyrin binding to lipids, affecting fluorescence. \uf099 Inflammation of the harderian gland (i.e., dacroadenitis) causes an increase in secretions. The most common cause is infection with SDAV, a coronavirus of rats. \uf099 The tears are secreted via activation of the parasympathetic nervous system via muscarinic receptors. Anticholinergic drugs have been shown to block secretions. \uf099 Harderian glands' secretions predominantly contain lipids that act as pheromones. The presence of porphyrins in Harderian gland secretions is more the exception than the rule when describing these secretions in rodents. Generally, porphyrins give color to secretions.\n\n\u2022 Wood's lamp examination reveals bright orange-red fluorescence; allows differentiation from dried blood \u2022 Further diagnostics will dependent on the clinical signs and suspected primary underlying disease, such as respiratory tract disease (see Respiratory Tract Disease, Acute, and Respiratory Tract Disease, Chronic).\n\nMany clients will present in distress because their pet is \"bleeding from the eyes.\" They will be relieved to know that their pet is not actually bleeding but will need to understand that this clinical sign can be an indicator of a greater underlying disease that warrants investigation.\n\nChromodacryorrhea is not an actual disease in most cases but an indicator for an underlying problem or stress. \n\nRespiratory Tract Disease, Acute Respiratory Tract Disease, Chronic Histologically, most are mammary fibroadenomas, although adenocarcinomas are also seen.\n\nRats have 12 mammary glands along the mammary chain, which extends from the cervical region to the tail base. Mammary tumors can arise in any of these locations.\n\n\u2022 Older animals are most frequently affected (>1 year of age). \u2022 Females are at higher risk than males; an incidence of 2% to 16% has been reported experimentally in male rats. GENETICS AND BREED PREDISPOSI-TION In inbred rat strains susceptible to mammary tumors expression levels of several prolactin-regulated genes are significantly elevated (e.g., messenger RNA's encoding prolactin and its cell surface receptor are amplified) indicating the presence of increased prolactin signaling in the mammary glands of mammary tumor susceptible rat strains.\n\n\u2022 Sex: females at higher risk than males \u2022 Age: higher risk at greater than 2 years of age \u2022 Nutrition: increased incidence with high-fat diets, reduced incidence with food restriction \n\nto that of rats on the seventh day postpartum. Because of this, rats with prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors are at increased risk of mammary tumor development. \u2022 In aging rats, prolactin secretion is increased and is reflected in the high blood prolactin level in both sexes. This change is due to a reduction of hypothalamic dopamine activity. The escape from hypothalamic inhibitory control leads to lactotroph hyperplasia and a high incidence of prolactin cell adenomas in old rats. \u2022 Gene expression of spontaneous fibroadenomas and adenocarcinomas compared to a normal rat mammary gland in the same developmental state has shown that fibroadenomas do not progress to adenocarcinoma. \u2022 Adenocarcinomas arise de-novo (i.e., without prior adenoma stage) and represent fewer than 10% of mammary tumors in pet rats. \u2022 Fibroadenomas can reach 8-10 cm in diameter and do metastasize.\n\n\u2022 Dermal/subcutaneous abscess (e.g., from bite wounds, foreign body penetration) \u2022 Neoplasia (e.g., lymphoma) \u2022 Mastitis\n\n\u2022 Fine-needle aspirate: caution during interpretation because large mammary tumors may be necrotic and can be difficult to differentiate from an abscess on cytology \u2022 Blood work: complete blood count and serum biochemistry screening as a preoperative workup \u2022 Thoracic radiographs/CT: preoperative workup if underlying respiratory disease is suspected\n\n\u2022 Stabilization of the patient if septic or has suffered blood loss \u2022 Complete surgical removal of the tumor (mastectomy) and prevention of recurrence\n\n\u2022 If necessary, stabilization of the patient if mammary tumor is infected/sepsis is present, or if blood loss has ensued from ulceration of the mass.\n\n\u2022 Complete surgical removal of the tumor and any ulcerated/infected skin or tissue is the treatment of choice. \uf099 Because tumors may be quite large, closure of dead space is important to prevent seroma formation. \uf099 Some masses are difficult to remove if they are in close association with the vulva. \u2022 Concurrent ovariectomy is recommended if patient is stable.\n\nBecause recurrence of mammary tumors at different locations can frequently occur, repeated surgical removal might be necessary.\n\nRats are notorious for mutilation of surgical sites, so appropriate pain medication with monitoring is compulsory. Use of an E-collar is necessary in some cases to prevent mutilation.\n\nTumors are likely to recur in other mammary glands in both male and female rats, especially if ovariectomy is not performed at the same time. Constant monitoring and palpation of the mammary glands are important.\n\n\u2022 In general, survival following mastectomy is good. \u2022 Quality of life is improved post mastectomy; however, controversy continues over whether tumor removal actually prolongs survival time. \u2022 Death can occur with sepsis or blood loss if the mammary mass is not surgically removed and becomes ulcerated or infected.\n\n\u2022 To date, the only proven treatment and prevention of mammary tumor development consists of surgical removal of the tumor and ovariectomy. Other treatments have been discussed but have not proven to be effective in preventing recurrence of spontaneous tumors or in decreasing their size once present. \u2022 Cabergoline is a prolactin inhibitor that suppresses pituitary prolactin secretion and can be given orally. It has been successfully used in the palliative treatment of a pituitary adenoma in a rat at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg PO q 72 h, and thus may be helpful in rats that have mammary tumor development secondary to prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors and in those unable to undergo ovariectomy.\n\n\u2022 Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists \uf099 Deslorelin implants (4.7 mg) have been used experimentally to suppress estrus in rats for 1 year and may be useful in rats that cannot be ovariectomized. \uf099 Leuprolide acetate has been experimentally shown to suppress the ability of the pituitary-gonadal system to secrete gonadotropin and testosterone for over 5 weeks; similar to deslorelin because it may be useful in rats that cannot undergo ovariectomy \u2022 Melatonin induces apoptosis of rat prolactin-secreting tumors. Experimentally, SC melatonin administration in experimentally induced tumor-bearing rats significantly increased survival time and reduced prolactin levels but did not change the mammary tumor growth rate. \u2022 Tamoxifen: antiestrogen used in the treatment of human breast cancer. This agent would be useful only in mammary adenocarcinomas that are estrogen receptor positive. This drug is NOT recommended, given the low incidence of adenocarcinoma in rats and the fact that it has been shown to induce hepatic cancer and proliferation of the rat uterus.\n\nHistopathologic examination of removed tumors should be performed because spontaneous mammary adenocarcinoma has a 5%-10% incidence. Individual genetic variability and environmental factors such as nutrition and maternal effects in utero and during lactation most likely affect quantitative trait loci (QTL) that control susceptibility to mammary adenocarcinoma. However, the individual genetic traits and QTL that influence gene function have not yet been elucidated.\n\n\u2022 Ovariectomy of female rats by 90 days of age \u2022 Treatment of prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors\n\n\u2022 All clients who own female rats should be educated about the importance of ovariectomy before 90 days of age. \u2022 Additionally, clients should be educated on the importance of early detection and removal of tumors before they become too large to be safely removed surgically.\n\nKidney or renal disease is a general term that describes any damage that reduces the functioning of the kidney.\n\n\u2022 Kidney disease: renal disease, kidney disease, kidney failure, chronic renal failure, nephropathy, suppurative pyelonephritis, suppurative nephritis\n\n\u2022 Chronic progressive nephrosis in rats: progressive renal disease in rats, progressive glomerulonephrosis, old rat nephropathy, glomerulosclerosis \u2022 Nephrocalcinosis: renal tubular mineralization\n\nLarge mammary fibroadenoma on a female rat. Note the close proximity to the left hind leg which impeded normal ambulation. lesions are more severe in rats over 12 months of age. \u2022 Nephrocalcinosis is more common in females and can be found in animals as young as 7 weeks of age. Blood estrogen levels may play a role in that the disease can be prevented by ovariectomy and is induced in castrated male and female rats by estrogen administration. GENETICS AND BREED PREDISPOSI-TION A significantly higher prevalence of chronic progressive nephrosis is seen in the Sprague-Dawley strain of rat. Osborne-Mendel and Buffalo strains are relatively insusceptible. Elevated prolactin levels are suspected of contributing to more severe disease. \n\n\u2022 With any diagnosis of renal insufficiency or failure, prognosis varies with severity of clinical pathologic findings, duration of disease, and severity of primary renal failure. If secondary to infection or obstructive disease, prognosis is determined by duration of the disease process and success in treatment-medical or surgical-of the underlying condition of secondary renal insufficiency. \u2022 Depending on initial diagnosis, disease severity, and response to therapy, quality of life issues and euthanasia should be discussed with the owner in terms of any patient with renal disease. \n\n\u2022 Many different terms are used to describe renal function and its deterioration. \uf099 Azotemia refers to increased concentrations of urea nitrogen and creatinine and other nonproteinaceous nitrogenous waste products in the blood. Renal azotemia denotes azotemia caused by renal parenchymal changes. \uf099 Uremia is the presence of all urine constituents in the blood. Usually a toxic condition, it may occur secondary to renal failure or postrenal disorders, including urethral blockage. \uf099 Renal reserve may be thought of as the percentage of \"extra\" nephrons-those not necessary to maintain normal renal function. Although it probably varies from animal to animal, this value is greater than 50% in most mammals. \uf099 Renal insufficiency begins when the renal reserve is lost. Animals with renal insufficiency outwardly appear normal, but have a reduced capacity to compensate for stresses such as infection or dehydration and have lost urine concentrating ability. \uf099 Renal failure is a state of decreased renal function that allows persistent abnormalities (azotemia and inability to concentrate urine) to exist; it refers to a level of organ function rather than a specific disease entity. Acute renal failure generally refers to cases of sudden decline of glomerular filtration rate resulting in an accumulation of nitrogenous waste products and inability to maintain normal fluid balance. Chronic renal failure generally refers to an insidious onset with slow progression (usually months to years) of azotemia and inadequately concentrated urine. \u2022 It is important to realize that most of the renal diseases discussed can manifest as varying stages of compromise in renal reserve, renal insufficiency, or renal failure. If or when the disease process progresses depends on variables such as the specific disease in question, environmental factors, and the individual animal itself.\n\n\u2022 NTP-2000 open formula is one diet available in laboratory medicine that is low in protein (14.0%) and has a Ca:P ratio approximating 1.3 : 1; it has been found to decrease the incidence of nephrocalcinosis in rats. \u2022 Another laboratory rat diet, AIN-93G, has a lower phosphorus content (0.3%) and a higher Ca:P ratio and has been shown to lower the incidence of nephrocalcinosis.\n\nhave an effect on hypertension associated with hydronephrosis in rats.\n\nHydronephrosis as a result of partial ureteral blockage led to increased blood pressure, which worsened significantly on a high-salt diet versus a low-salt diet. \u2022 High levels of dietary soy isoflavones induced nephrocalcinosis formation, depending on the strain of laboratory rat.\n\nChronic renal failure requires continuous treatment and monitoring. Unless a specific underlying cause is diagnosed and treated successfully, treatment in many cases will be lifelong. \n\nOral doxycycline should not be given with any dairy products or other products containing calcium because this will decrease its bioavailability.\n\n\u2022 Patients with severe disease should be hospitalized until they are able to go home on oral medications. \u2022 Patients should be closely monitored for signs of chronic respiratory disease.\n\nLittle is known about the prognosis of pure acute bacterial pneumonia because co-infection with other respiratory pathogens is common, as are subclinical infections.\n\nBecause both of these bacteria can be present without causing clinical disease, preventive measures are focused on decreasing stress, avoiding immune suppressive drugs, and maintaining appropriate diet/husbandry to avoid conversion to clinical disease.\n\nAll clients owning rats should understand the frequency of respiratory disease in rats and the importance of proper housing (good ventilation, avoidance of crowding, avoidance of dusty bedding such as wood shavings) and close observation for any signs of respiratory disease, so that treatment can be administered as soon as possible. \n\nOral doxycycline should not be given with any dairy or other products containing calcium because this will decrease its bioavailability.\n\n\u2022 Respiratory rate and effort \u2022 Body weight/condition \u2022 Appetite\n\nBecause many factors contribute to rat respiratory issues, the disease cannot be eliminated, but clinical signs may be ameliorated with antibiotics and supportive care.\n\n\u2022 Use of corticosteroids as antiinflammatory agents has been recommended to decrease the inflammation. Most (experimental) studies in rats have found steroids do not affect signs, function, and indices of inflammation. There is also significant concern that corticosteroid efficacy will be accompanied by consequential impairment of the rat's immune defenses leading to fatal pulmonary abscessation and/or pneumonia. \u2022 Use of bronchodilators (both oral and inhaled) has been recommended because these agents are helpful in humans with chronic bronchitis. Specific studies with bronchodilators have not been performed in rats with chronic respiratory disease, but they may be helpful. \u2022 Nebulized hypertonic saline solution (7%) has been used successfully in humans with cystic fibrosis as a mucolytic agent. It breaks down the mucous biofilm and gives relief for ~8 hours. \u2022 Concurrent nebulization with bronchodialators and/or antibiotics has been recommended to directly deliver medications. Specific studies using these nebulizations have not been performed in rats with chronic respiratory disease but may be helpful.\n\nThis disease complex (M. pulmonis) is thought to be ubiquitous in pet rats; thus prevention of infection is nearly impossible. Preventing contributing factors such as proper ventilation, bedding, and diet and decreasing stress can be helpful.\n\nAll clients who own rats should be educated about the ubiquitous nature of M. pulmonis and the importance of ventilation, low cage ammonia levels, avoidance of dusty bedding such as wood shavings, and appropriate nutrition in decreasing the potential severity of chronic respiratory disease in rats. \u2022 Ringtail \uf099 Occurs in young rats (7-19 days) and is characterized by dry skin and formation of annular constrictions, which might progress to swelling, and tissue necrosis. Autoamputation might occur. \uf099 Low environmental relative humidity (less than 20%-40%) appears to be the cause; it is more often seen in rats housed in hanging cages and is rarely seen in pet rats.
