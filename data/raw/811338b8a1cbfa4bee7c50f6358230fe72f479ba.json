{"title": "Impact of self-imposed prevention measures and short-term government intervention on mitigating and delaying a COVID-19 epidemic", "body": "Introduction self-imposed prevention measures on reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are currently missing but are of 88 crucial importance in the attempt to stop its spread. Moreover, if a COVID-19 epidemic cannot be prevented, it 89 is important to know how to effectively diminish and postpone the epidemic peak to give healthcare professionals 90 more time to prepare and react effectively to an increasing health care burden. For affected areas like Europe, 91 where the outbreak runs concurrently with the influenza season, the importance to identify such interventions is 92 profound.\n\nUsing a transmission model we evaluated the impact of self-imposed measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and 95 social distancing) due to awareness about COVID-19 and of a short-term government-imposed social distancing 96 intervention on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses since the 97 first case. We provide a comparative analysis of these interventions and assess the range of intervention efficacies 98 for which a large COVID-19 outbreak can be prevented. However, severely symptomatic patients in isolation may be removed from the population due to disease-associated 116 mortality. Individuals with severe symptoms (I S ) are diagnosed and kept in isolation (I D ) at rate \u03bd until they recover (R S ) at rate \u03b3 S or die at rate \u03b7. In the extended model with disease awareness, the population is stratified not only by the disease status but also by mask-wearing and self-imposed social distancing that can lower their susceptibility, infectivity and/or contact rate.\n\nIndividuals who know their disease status (I D and R S ) do not adapt any such measures since they know that they 128 cannot contract the disease again. Hence, they are excluded from the awareness transition process and we assume 129 that their behaviour in the contact process is identical to disease-unaware individuals. B). We assume that awareness fades and individuals return to the unaware state at a constant rate. The latter 134 means that they no longer use self-imposed measures. For simplicity, we assume that awareness acquisition and 135 fading rates are the same for individuals of type S, E, I M , and R M . However, the rate of awareness acquisition 136 6 .

Infectious individuals with severe symptoms who are disease-aware (I a S ) get diagnosed and are kept in isolation (I a D ) at rate \u03bd a , recover at rate \u03b3 a S and die from disease at rate \u03b7 a . (B) shows awareness dynamics. Infectious individuals with severe symptoms (I S ) acquire disease awareness (I a S ) at rate \u03bb aware proportional to the rate of awareness spread and to the current number of diagnosed individuals (I D and I a D ) in the population. As awareness fades, these individuals return to the unaware state at rate \u00b5 S . The acquisition rate of awareness (k\u03bb aware ) and the rate of awareness fading (\u00b5) are the same for individuals of type S, E, I M , and R M , where k is the reduction in susceptibility to the awareness acquisition compared to I S individuals. Table 1 provides the description and values of all parameters. 140 We considered short-term government intervention aimed at fostering social distancing in the population and a 141 suite of measures self-imposed by disease-aware individuals, i.e., mask-wearing, hand washing, and self-imposed 142 social distancing. \n\n\u03b7 = \u03b3 S f /(1 \u2212 f )\n\nRate of awareness spread (slow, fast and range) \u03b4 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , 1 (10 \u22126 -1) per year Assumed \u2021 Relative susceptibility to awareness acquisition for S, E, I M , and R M k 50% (0-100%) Assumed \u2021 Duration of awareness for S a , E a , I a M , and R a M 1/\u00b5 30 (7-365) days Assumed \u2021 Duration of awareness for I a S 1/\u00b5 S 60 (7-365) days Longer than 1/\u00b5 \u2021 Delay from onset of infectiousness to diagnosis for I a S 1/\u03bd a 3 (1-5) days\n\nShorter than 1/\u03bd \u2021 Delay from diagnosis to recovery of diagnosed aware (I a D ) 1/\u03b3 a S 12 days Shorter than 1/\u03b3 S Case fatality rate of aware diagnosed Since infectious individuals may transmit the virus to others without direct physical contact, we assume that hand-151 washing only reduces one's susceptibility. The efficacy of handwashing is described by the reduction in susceptibility 152 (i.e., probability of transmission per single contact) of susceptible disease-aware individuals (S a ) which ranges from 153 0% (zero efficacy) to 100% (full efficacy).\n\nSelf-imposed social distancing 155 Disease-aware individuals may also practice social distancing, i.e., maintaining distance to others and avoid congre-156 gate settings. As a consequence, this measure leads to a change in mixing patterns in the population. The efficacy of social distancing of disease-aware individuals is described by the reduction in their contact rate which is varied 158 from 0% (no social distancing or zero efficacy) to 100% (full self-isolation or full efficacy).\n\nShort-term government-imposed social distancing 160 Governments may decide to promote social distancing policies through interventions such as school and workplace 161 closures or by issuing a ban on large gatherings. These policies will cause a community-wide contact rate reduction, 162 regardless of the awareness status. Here, we assume that the government intervention is initiated if the number of 163 diagnosed individuals exceeds a certain threshold (10-1000 persons) and terminates after a fixed period of time (1-3 164 months). As such, the intervention is implemented early into the epidemic. The efficacy of government-imposed 165 social distancing is described by the reduction of the average contact rate in the population which ranges from 0% 166 (no distancing) to 100% (complete quarantine of the population). and of all individuals (government-imposed social distancing). We refer to these quantities as the efficacy of a 175 prevention measure and vary it from 0% (zero efficacy) to 100% (full efficacy) ( Table 1 ). The main analyses were 176 performed for two values of the rate of awareness spread that corresponded to scenarios of slow and fast spread 177 of awareness in the population (Table 1) . For these scenarios, the proportion of the aware population at the peak 178 of the epidemic was 40% and 90%, respectively. In the main analyses, government-imposed social distancing was 179 initiated when 10 individuals got diagnosed and was lifted after 3 months.\n\nEstimates of epidemiological parameters were obtained from most recent literature ( The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, writing of 188 the manuscript, or the decision to submit for publication.

Figure 4 shows the impact of all considered self-imposed measures as well as of the government-imposed social 217 distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and the time to the peak for slow rate of awareness spread. 218\n\nIn this scenario, the model predicts progressively larger reductions in the peak number of diagnoses and in the 219 attack rate as the efficacy of the self-imposed measures increases. In the limit of 100% efficacy, the reduction in the 220 peak number of diagnoses is 23% to 30% (Figure 4 A) and the attack rate decreases from 16% to 12-13% ( Figure 221 11 .

Figure 4 . Impact of prevention measures on the epidemic for a slow rate of awareness spread. (A), (B) and (C) show the relative reduction in the peak number of diagnoses, the attack rate (proportion of the population that recovered or died after severe infection) and the time until the peak number of diagnoses. The efficacy of prevention measures was varied between 0% and 100%. In the context of this study, the efficacy of social distancing denotes the reduction in the contact rate. The efficacy of handwashing and mask-wearing are given by the reduction in susceptibility and infectivity, respectively. The simulations were started with one case. Government-imposed social distancing was initiated after 10 diagnoses and lifted after 3 months. For parameter values, see Table 1. 12 .

Since the proportion of aware individuals who change 223 their behavior is too small to make a significant impact on transmission, self-imposed measures can only mitigate 224 but not prevent an epidemic. When awareness spreads at a slow rate, a 3-month government intervention has a 225 contrasting impact. The time to the peak number of diagnoses is longer for more stringent contact rate reductions. 226\n\nFor example, at 100% efficacy (full quarantine) the government can postpone the peak by almost 7 months but 227 its magnitude and attack rate are unaffected. Similar predictions are expected, as long as government-imposed 228 social distancing starts early (e.g, after tens to hundreds cases) and is lifted few weeks to few months later 229 13 .

For parameter values, see Table 1 .\n\nFor many countries around the world, the focus of public health officers in the context of COVID-19 epidemic has 256 shifted from containment to mitigation and delay. Our study provides new insights for designing effective outbreak 257 control strategies. We show that hand-washing, mask-wearing, and social distancing adopted by disease-aware 258 individuals are all viable strategies for delaying the epidemic peak, flattening the epidemic curve and reducing the 259 attack rate. We show that the rate at which disease awareness spreads has a strong impact on how self-imposed CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034827 doi: medRxiv preprint measures, a large epidemic can be prevented when the efficacy exceeds 50%. Moreover, the effect of combinations 264 of self-imposed measures is additive. In practical terms, it means that SARS-CoV-2 will not cause a large outbreak 265 in a country where 90% of the population adopt handwashing and social distancing that are 25% efficacious (i.e., 266 reduce susceptibility and contact rate by 25%, respectively).\n\nAlthough the effects of self-imposed measures on mitigating and delaying the epidemic are similar (see Figure 4 269 and Figure 5) , not all explored efficacy values may be achieved for each measure. For instance, handwashing with 270 soap or using alcohol-based sanitizers may remove the virus completely leading to 100% efficacy. 19 For surgical 271 masks, their filtration efficiency has a wide range (0%-84%) and thus their actual efficacy is difficult to quantify. 21\n\nFor this reason, the promotion of handwashing might become preferable. Thus, for a fair comparison between 273 measures, realistic efficacy values of a specific measure should be taken into consideration.\n\nWe contrasted self-imposed measures stimulated by disease awareness with mandated social distancing. Our anal-276 yses show that short-term government-imposed social distancing that is implemented early into the epidemic, can 277 delay the epidemic peak but does not affect its magnitude nor the attack rate. For example, a 3-month government 278 intervention imposing community-wide contact rate reduction that starts after tens to hundreds diagnoses in the 279 country can postpone the peak by about 7 months. If this intervention is combined with a self-imposed measure, 280 then the delay can be even longer (up to 10 months for handwashing with 30% efficacy). Such an intervention is 281 highly desirable, when a vaccine is being developed or when healthcare systems require more time to treat cases or 282 increase capacity.\n\nSince for many countries the COVID-19 epidemic is still in its early stages, government-imposed social distancing 285 was modeled as a short-term intervention initiated when the number of diagnosed individuals was relatively low. 286\n\nOur sensitivity analyses showed that government intervention introduced later into the epidemic and imposed for 287 the authors also showed that the optimal strategy is highly dependent on the desired outcome. A detailed analysis 292 of government interventions with different timings and durations that also takes into account the economic and 293 societal consequences, and the cost of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is a subject for future work.\n\nOur study provides the first comparative analysis of a suite of self-imposed measures and of short-term government-296 imposed social distancing as strategies for mitigating and delaying a COVID-19 epidemic. In our analyses, we 297 15 . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Our model has several limitations. It does not account for stochasticity, demographics, heterogeneities in contact 305 patterns, spatial effects, inhomogeneous mixing and imperfect isolation. Our conclusions can, therefore, be 306 drawn on a qualitative level. Detailed models will have to be developed to design and tailor effective strategies 307 in particular settings. To take into account the uncertainty in SARS-CoV-19 epidemiological parameters, we 308 performed sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the model predictions. As more data become available, 309 our model can be easily updated. In addition, our study assumes that individuals become disease-aware with a 310 rate of awareness acquisition proportional to the number of currently diagnosed individuals. Other forms for the 311 awareness acquisition rate that incorporate, e.g., the saturation of awareness, may be more realistic and would be 312 interesting to explore in future studies.
