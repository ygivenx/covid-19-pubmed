{"title": "Natural killer cells act as rheostats modulating anti-viral T cells", "body": "One day before infection, male C57BL/6 were selectively depleted of NK cells through a single i.p. injection of 25 \u00b5g anti-NK1.1 mAb (PK136) or a control rat IgG2a (both from Bio-X-Cell), as previously described21 (Supplementary Fig. 1). In some cases, mice were also depleted of CD4 T cells by i.p. injection of 100 \u00b5g anti-CD4 (GK1.5) at days \u22121 and +3 of infection. Mice were then infected i.v. with 5\u00d7104 (low dose), 2\u00d7105 (medium dose), or 2\u00d7106 (high dose) PFU of the clone 13 variant of LCMV. Virus was titrated by plaque assay on Vero cells. In some experiments, mice were inoculated i.p. with 1.5\u00d7107 PFU of PV, 8\u00d7105 PFU of MHV strain A59, 1\u00d7106 PFU of VV strain Western Reserve, 1\u00d7106 PFU of Smith strain MCMV, or 200 \u00b5g of pI:C (Invivogen).\n\nThe number of LCMV-specific T cells was measured by H-2Db-NP396\u2013404 tetramer staining or by intracellular cytokine staining after 5 hour ex vivo stimulation with 1 \u00b5M viral peptide in the presence of brefeldin A. T cell cytolytic activity was measured in vivo as described previously21.\n\nAn unconventional in vivo cytotoxicity assay was previously established to determine NK cell killing of lymphocyte populations 21. Donor mice were depleted of NK cells and then infected i.v. or i.p. with different viruses. At day 4 p.i., single cell splenocyte suspensions were prepared from these mice, labeled with 2 \u00b5M CFSE, and transferred (2\u00d7107) into various strains of NK cell-depleted or control recipient mice which were either uninfected or had been infected with virus 1 to 5 days previously. Spleens of recipient mice were harvested 5 hours after transfer and assessed for survival of donor T cells.\n\nC57BL/6, Thy1.1+, TCR\u03b4\u2212/\u2212, TCR\u03b2\u2212/\u2212, lpr, Prf1\u2212/\u2212, and \u00b5MT\u2212/\u2212 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. Ly5.1+ mice were from Taconic Farms. NKG2D\u2212/\u2212 and CD1d\u2212/\u2212 mice on a C57BL/6 background were obtained from B. Poli\u010730 and M. Exley31, respectively. Congenic (Ly5.1+) TCR transgenic P1432 mice and TNF\u2212/\u2212 mice on a C57BL/6 background were bred at UMMS. Male mice at 6\u201316 weeks of age were routinely used in experiments. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, and experiments were performed in compliance with institutional guidelines as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of UMMS.\n\nThe clone 13 variant of LCMV was propagated in baby hamster kidney BHK21 cells9 and titrated by plaque assay on Vero cells. Mice were infected i.v. with 5\u00d7104 (low dose), 2\u00d7105 (medium dose), or 2\u00d7106 (high dose) PFU of LCMV. Selective depletion of NK cells was achieved through a single i.p. injection of 25 \u00b5g anti-NK1.1 mAb (PK136) or a control rat IgG2a produced by Bio-X-Cell, as previously described21 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Alternatively, mice received a carefully titrated dose of 10 \u00b5L of anti-asialo GM1 antibody (Wako Biochemicals) diluted in 200 \u00b5L PBS i.p. one day prior to virus infection. Anti-NKG2D mAb (CX5) was a gift of L. Lanier, and 200 \u00b5g was injected i.p. at the time of infection. Mice were depleted of T cells by i.p. injection of either 100 \u00b5g anti-CD4 (GK1.5) or 50 \u00b5g anti-CD8 (2.43) produced by Bio-X-Cell at day \u22121 and day +3 of infection. In some experiments, mice were inoculated i.p. with 1.5\u00d7107 PFU of PV, 8\u00d7105 PFU of MHV strain A59, 1\u00d7106 PFU of VV strain Western Reserve, 1\u00d7106 PFU of Smith strain MCMV, or 200 \u00b5g of polyI:C (Invivogen).\n\nT-cell epitopes encoded by LCMV include NP396\u2013404 (FQPQNGQFI), GP33\u201341 (KAVYNFATC), and GP61\u201380 (GLKGPDIYKGVYQFKSVEFD) 33\u201335. Peptides were purchased from 21st Century Biochemicals and purified by reverse phase-HPLC to 90% purity. H-2Db-NP396\u2013404 tetramers were prepared as described36. CD1d-PBS57-allophycocyanin tetramers provided by NIAID Tetramer Facility were a generous gift of L. Berg.\n\nFluorescently labeled antibodies and reagents were purchased from BD Biosciences, eBioscience, BioLegend, and R&D Biosystems. Flow cytometric analyses of cells were performed on a LSR II cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with FACSDiva software and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).\n\nSpleens from donor mice were mechanically disrupted, and erythrocytes were lysed using a 0.84% NH4Cl solution in order to generate single-cell leukocyte suspensions. Cells were labeled for 15 min at 37\u00b0C with the 2 \u00b5M fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (CFDA-SE, Molecular probes), washed, and transferred i.v. (3\u00d7107 cell) to recipient mice.\n\nT cell cytolytic activity was measured in vivo as described previously21. Briefly, single-cell suspensions were prepared from spleens of uninfected mice, and separate fractions of cells were then loaded with LCMV peptides (1 \u00b5M) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C before labeling with CFSE (2.5, 1, or 0.4 \u00b5M, Molecular Probes) for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C. After washing, these populations were combined at equal ratios and transferred i.v. into either na\u00efve or infected recipients. Survival of each transferred population in the spleens of recipient mice was assessed 16 hours after transfer. Specific lysis was calculated as follows: 100-([% LCMV target population in infected experimental/ % unlabeled population in infected experimental) \u00f7 (% LCMV target population in na\u00efve control / % unlabeled population in na\u00efve control)] \u00d7 100).\n\nAn unconventional in vivo cytotoxicity assay was previously established to determine NK cell killing of lymphocyte populations in vivo21. WT or lpr donor mice were depleted of NK cells and then infected with VV, MCMV, MHV, PV, or a medium dose of LCMV clone 13. At day 4 p.i., single cell splenocyte suspensions were prepared from these mice, labeled with CFSE, and then transferred (2\u00d7107) into experimental recipient mice on day 3 of medium dose LCMV infection, unless otherwise noted. Recipients included WT, Prf1\u2212/\u2212, TNF\u2212/\u2212, or NKG2D\u2212/\u2212 mice that were administered anti-NK1.1 or isotype control antibodies one day prior to inoculation with PV, MHC, polyI:C, or various doses of LCMV clone 13. Some recipient mice were uninfected and served as controls. Spleens of recipient mice were harvested 5 hours after transfer and assessed for survival of donor T cells.\n\nStimulator cells were prepared by isolation of single-cell suspensions from the spleens of uninfected as well as isotype-treated or anti-NK1.1-treated mice infected 3 days previously with a medium dose of LCMV i.v. Following irradiation, stimulator cells (5\u00d7104) were plated at a 1:10 ratio with CFSE-labeled Ly5.1+ LCMV-specific P14 CD8 T cells (5\u00d7105) in T cell stimulation medium (RPMI supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin sulfate, 2 mM l-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% heat-inactivated (56\u00b0C, 30 min) FBS), which was refreshed every two days. P14 cells were enumerated and analyzed for dilution of CFSE as a measure of proliferation every 24 hours after initiation of co-culture.\n\nSingle-cell leukocyte suspensions from spleens, inguinal lymph nodes, lung and liver were prepared as described previously21 and were plated at 2\u00d7106 cells per well in 96 well plates. Cells were stimulated for 5 hours at 37\u00b0C with either 1 \u00b5M viral peptide or 2.5 \u00b5g/mL anti-CD3 mAb in the presence of brefeldin A and 0.2 U/mL rhIL-2. Stimulated cells were then pre-incubated with a 1:200 dilution of Fc Block (2.4G2) in FACS buffer (HBBS, 2% FCS, 0.1% NaN3) and stained for 20 min at 4\u00b0C with various combinations of fluorescently tagged mAbs. After washing, cells were permeabilized using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution and then stained in BD Permwash using mAbs specific for various cytokines. AnnexinV staining was performed in azide-free FACS buffer directly ex vivo according to manufacture\u2019s instructions (BD Biosciences).\n\nResults are routinely displayed as mean \u00b1 s.e.m, with statistical differences between experimental groups determined using a two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test, where a p value of < 0.05 was deemed significant. Statistical differences in survival were determined by log rank (Mantel-Cox) analysis. Graphs were produced and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism."}
