{"title": "Freshwater monitoring by nanopore sequencing", "body": "The global assurance of safe drinking water and basic sanitation has been recognised as a United Nations Millennium Development Goal 1 , particularly in light of the pressures of rising urbanisation, agricultural intensification and climate change 2,3 . These trends enforce an increasing demand for freshwater monitoring frameworks that combine cost effectiveness, fast technology deployability and data transparency 4, 5 .\n\nEnvironmental metagenomics, the tracing of organisms present in a substrate through high-throughput DNA sequencing, yields informative measures of relative taxonomic species occurrence and functional diversity [6] [7] [8] .\n\nMicrobial metagenomics studies overcome enrichment biases common to traditional culturing approaches 6 ; however, they usually depend on expensive and stationary equipment, highly specialised operational training and substantial time lags between sample preparation, raw data generation and access.\n\nIn recent years, these challenges have been revisited with the prospect of 'portable' DNA analysis. The main driver of this is the portable, smartphone-sized MinION device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), which enables real-time DNA sequencing using nanopores 9 . Nanopore read lengths can be comparably long (currently up to ~2*10 6 bases 10 ), which is enabled by continuous electrical sensing of sequential nucleotides along single DNA strands. In connection with a laptop or cloud access for the translation of raw voltage signal into nucleotides (basecalling), nanopore sequencing can be used to rapidly monitor long DNA sequences in remote locations. Although there are still common concerns about the technology's base-level accuracy, mobile MinION setups have already proven powerful for real-time tracing of bacterial and viral pathogen outbreaks [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .\n\nHere we report a simple, low-cost workflow to assess microbial freshwater communities with nanopore DNA sequencing. Our benchmark involves the design and optimisation of essential experimental steps for multiplexed MinION usage in the context of local environments, together with an evaluation of computational methods for the bacterial classification of nanopore sequencing reads from metagenomic libraries. To showcase the resolution of sequencing-based aquatic monitoring in a spatiotemporal setting, we combine DNA analyses with physicochemical measurements of surface water samples collected at nine locations within a confined ~12 kilometre reach of the River Cam passing through the city of Cambridge (UK) in April, June and August 2018. Spirosomaceae (17.7 %), and NS11-12 marine group (12.5 %), followed by Arcobacteraceae (4.8 %), Sphingomonadaceae (2.9 %) and Rhodobacteraceae (2.5 %) (Figure 2d ). Members of these families are commonly associated with freshwater environments; for example, Burkholderiaceae reads mostly originate from aquatic genera such as Limnohabitans, Rhodoferax or Aquabacterium, which further validates the suitability of this environmental nanopore sequencing workflow.\n\nHierarchical clustering additionally showed that two biological replicates collected at the same location and time point (April samples 9.1 and 9.2), grouped with high concordance; this indicates that moderate spatiotemporal trends are discernible within a highly localised context. Besides the dominant core microbiome, microbial profiles showed a marked arrangement of time dependence, with water samples from April grouping more distantly to those from June and August (Figure 2c ). Principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure 3a , Supplementary Figure   4 ) revealed that the strongest differential abundances along the chronological axis of variation (PC3) derived from the higher abundance of Carnobacteriaceae and Saprospiraceae in April (Figure 3b ). These families are known for their occurrence in waters with lower temperature 23 or high organic biomass availability 24, 25 , respectively.\n\nWhile a seasonal difference in bacterial composition can be expected due to increasing water temperatures in the summer months, additional changes may have also been caused by alterations in river hydrochemistry and flow rate (Supplementary Figures 5 and 6, Supplementary Table 1c ). To assess this effect in detail, we measured the pH and a range of major and trace cations in all river water samples using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), as well as major anions using ion chromatography (Supplementary \n\nIn line with these physicochemical trends, we next determined the spatiotemporal enrichment of potentially functionally important bacterial taxa through nanopore sequencing. We retrieved 55 potentially pathogenic bacterial genera through careful integration of species known to affect human health 28, 29 , and also 13 wastewaterassociated 30 bacterial genera. Of these, 21 potentially pathogenic and eight wastewater-associated genera were detected across all of the river samples ( Figure 3c ; Materials and Methods). Many of these signals were stronger downstream of urban river sections, within the mooring zone for recreational and residential barges (location 7) and in the vicinity of sewage outflow from a nearby wastewater treatment plant (location 8). The most prolific candidate pathogen genus observed across all locations was Arcobacter, which features multiple species implicated in acute gastrointestinal infections 31 .\n\nIn general, much of the taxonomic variation across all samples was caused by the isolate of April We also found varying relative abundances of the Leptospira genus, which was recently described to be enriched in wastewater effluents in Germany 33 (Figure 3c ). This taxonomic group contains several potentially pathogenic species capable of causing life-threatening leptospirosis through waterborne infections 34 . Yet, the genus also features close-related saprophytic and 'intermediate' taxa 35 . To resolve its complex phylogeny in the River Cam surface, we aligned Leptospiraceae reads from all samples together with various reference sequences assigned to pre-classified pathogenic, saprophytic and other environmental Leptospira species 35 correspondingly inflated divergence between reads, we could pinpoint spatial clusters and a distinctly higher similarity between our Leptospiraceae amplicons and saprophytic rather than pathogenic Leptospira species.\n\nThese findings were subsequently validated by targeted, Leptospira species-specific qPCR (Materials and Methods), confirming that the current nanopore sequencing quality is sufficiently high to yield indicative results for bacterial monitoring workflows at the bacterial species level.\n\nUsing a low-cost, easily adaptable and scalable framework, we provide the first detailed nanopore sequencing atlas of bacterial microbiota along a river reach. Beyond the core microbiome of an exemplary fluvial ecosystem, our results suggest that it is possible to robustly assess time changes in accessory bacterial composition in the .

We observed differences in terms of taxonomic quantifications, read misclassification rates and consensus agreements between the 13 tested computational methods. In this benchmark, using the SILVA 132 reference database, one of the most balanced performances was achieved with Minimap2 alignments. As nanopore sequencing quality continues to increase through refined pore chemistries, basecalling algorithms and consensus sequencing workflows [36] [37] [38] , future bacterial taxonomic classifications are likely to improve as well.\n\nWe show that nanopore amplicon sequencing data can resolve the core microbiome of a freshwater body, as well as its temporal and spatial fluctuations. Asides common freshwater bacteria, we find that the differential abundances of Carnobacteriaceae and Saprospiraceae most strongly contribute to seasonal loadings in the Cam River. As Carnobacteriaceae have been associated with cold environments 23 , and we found these to be more abundant in colder April samples (mean 11.3 \u00b0C, vs. 15.8 \u00b0C in June and 19.1 \u00b0C in August), this might further establish the impact of water temperature on the variation of bacterial composition. Saprospiraceae are frequently observed in wastewater treatment systems 30, 32 , where they likely play a role in heterotrophic polymeric degradation 24, 25 . The majority of our Saprospiraceae reads (~67.33 %) could indeed be assigned to sewage effluent (outlier sample April-8, Figure 3a ), which suggests that this particular sample augments the observed time pattern.\n\nMost routine freshwater surveillance frameworks focus on semi-quantitative diagnostics of only a limited number of target taxa, such as pathogenic Salmonella, Legionella and faecal coliforms 39 . While common culture-based, immunological or PCR-based approaches can assist stakeholders with limited assessments of local water quality 40,41 , we show that portable nanopore metagenomics offers the promise of more comprehensive microbial pathogen examinations at similar expense. Our analyses highlight that the combination of full-length 16S rRNA gene amplification and nanopore sequencing can complement hydrochemical controls in pinpointing potentially contaminated sites, some of which had been previously highlighted for their pathogen diversity and abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes 42, 43 . Nanopore sequencing allowed for the reliable distinction of closely related pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial species of the common Salomella, Legionella, Pseudomonas and Leptospira, and future bioinformatics efforts might focus on the automatisation of such assessments across more diverse genera of interest.\n\nA number of experimental intricacies should be addressed towards future nanopore freshwater sequencing studies, mostly by scrutinising water DNA extraction yields, PCR biases and molar imbalances in barcode multiplexing ( Figure 2a, Supplementary Figure 8 ). Yet, our results show that it would be theoretically feasible to obtain meaningful river microbiota from >100 barcoded samples on a single nanopore flow cell, thereby enabling water monitoring projects involving large collections at a sub-\u00a320 cost per sample (Supplementary Table 3 ). Barcoded shotgun nanopore sequencing protocols may pose a viable alternative strategy to bypass pitfalls often observed in amplicon-based workflows, namely taxon-specific primer biases 17 Although it is to be expected that short-read metagenomics technology continues to provide valuable environmental insights, as shown through recent cataloguing efforts for world's ocean 54 and soil 55 microbiomes, these traditional platforms are cumbersome for monitoring remote environments or low-resource settings. The MinION technology is considerably less challenging to transport, operate and maintain, and our results show that spatiotemporal nanopore sequencing could be readily adapted for multiplexed bacterial pathogen tracing in epidemic contexts. We reason that the low investment costs (Supplementary Table 3 ), the convenience of MinION handling and data analysis will allow for such endeavours to become increasingly accessible to citizens and public health organisations around the world, ultimately democratising the opportunities and benefits of DNA sequencing.

Measurements were taken at three time points, in two-month intervals between April and August 2018 (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1a ). To warrant river base flow conditions and minimise rain-derived biases, a minimum dry weather time span of 48h was maintained prior to sampling 57 . One litre of surface water was collected in autoclaved DURAN bottles (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and cooled to 4 \u00b0C within three hours. Two bottles of water were collected consecutively for each time point, serving as biological replicates of location 9 (samples 9.1 and 9.2).\n\nWe assessed various chemical, geological and physical properties of the River Cam (Supplementary Figures 5   and 6, Supplementary Tables 1b and 1c) .\n\nIn situ water temperature was measured immediately after sampling. To this end, we linked a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor to a portable custom-built, grid mounted Arduino nano v3.

However, the high Clconcentrations of the samples in this study were not fully bracketed by the calibration curve and we therefore assigned a more conservative uncertainty of 10 % to Cl concentrations.\n\nHigh calcium and magnesium concentrations were recorded across all samples, in line with hard groundwater and natural weathering of the Cretaceous limestone bedrock underlying the river catchment (Supplementary Figure   5 ). There are no known evaporite salt deposits in the river catchment, and therefore the high dissolved Na + , K + and Clconcentrations in the Cam are likely derived from anthropogenic inputs 26 (Supplementary Figure 5) . We We integrated sensor data sets on mean daily air temperature, sunshine hours and total rainfall from a public, Cambridge-based weather station (Supplementary Figure 6a-c; Supplementary Table 1c) . Similarly, mean gauged daily Cam water discharge [m 3 s -1 ] was retrieved through publicly available records from three upstream gauging stations connected to the UK National River Flow Archive (https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/), together with historic measurements from 1968 onwards (Supplementary Figure 6d) .

Additionally, 400 mL deionised (DI) water was also filtered. We then performed DNA extractions with a modified DNeasy PowerWater protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Briefly, filters were cut into small slices with sterile scissors and transferred to 2 mL Eppendorf tubes containing lysis beads. Homogenization buffer PW1 was added, and the tubes subjected to ten minutes of vigorous shaking at 30 Hz in a TissueLyser II machine (Qiagen). After subsequent DNA binding and washing steps in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol, elution was done in 50 \u00b5L EB. We used Qubit dsDNA HS Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to determine water DNA isolate concentrations (Supplementary Table 2a ).\n\nDNA extracts from each sampling batch and DI water control were separately amplified with V1-V9 full-length Figure 1b-c) , which was previously assessed using nanopore shotgun metagenomics 49 . We used common primer binding sequences 17 27f and 1492r, both coupled to unique 24 bp barcodes and a nanopore motor protein tether sequence (Supplementary Table 4 ). Fulllength 16S PCRs were performed with the following conditions: Table S2b ). We used KAPA Pure Beads (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) to concentrate full-length 16S products in 21 \u00b5L DI water. Multiplexed nanopore ligation sequencing libraries were then made by following the SQK-LSK109 protocol (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK).\n\nR9.4 MinION flow cells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) were loaded with 75 \u00b5l of ligation library. The MinION instrument was run for approximately 48 hours, until no further sequencing reads were collected. Fast5 files were basecalled using Guppy (version 3.15) and output DNA sequence reads with Q>7 were saved in fastq files.\n\nVarious output metrics per library and barcode are summarised in Supplementary Table 2c .\n\nIn collaboration with Public Health England, raw Cam River water DNA isolates from each location and time point were subjected to the UK reference service for leptospiral testing. This is based on quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of 16S rDNA and LipL32, implemented as a TaqMan assay for the detection and differentiation of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Leptospira spp. from human serum. Briefly, the assay consists of a twocomponent PCR; the first component is a duplex assay that targets the gene encoding the outer membrane lipoprotein LipL32, which is reported to be strongly associated with the pathogenic phenotype. The second reaction is a triplex assay targeting a well conserved region within the 16S rRNA gene (rrn) in Leptospira spp. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.06.936302 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nData processing and read classification was developed using the Snakemake workflow management system 58 and is available on Github -together with all necessary downstream analysis scripts to reproduce the results of this manuscript (https://github.com/d-j-k/puntseq). De-multiplexed and processed reads, separated by month and location, are available through the European Nucleotide Archive (PRJEB34900). \n\nWe used nanopore sequencing data from our mock community and freshwater amplicons for benchmarking the classification tools. We therefore subsampled (a) 10,000 reads from each of the three mock community sequencing replicates (section 1.4), and (b) 10,000 reads from an aquatic sample (April-8; three random draws served as replicates). We then used the above 13 classification tools to classify these reads against the same database, SILVA v.132 19 (Supplementary Figure 1 ). \n\nFor the aquatic sample, the number of unclassified reads were counted prior to monitoring the performance of each classification tool in comparison with a consensus classification, which we defined as majority vote across classifications from all computational workflows. We observed stable results across all three draws of 10,000 reads from the same dataset (data not shown), indicating a robust representation of the performance of each classifier.\n\nMinimap2 performed second best at classifying the mock community (lowest RMSE), while also delivering freshwater bacterial profiles in line with the majority vote of other classification tools (Supplementary Figure 1d- e), in addition to providing rapid speed (data not shown). Yet, the application of this software to our entire dataset caused insufficient memory errors (at ~150 Gb RAM with kmer length 12), likely due to major sequence redundancies within the SILVA v.132 reference fasta file. Hence, to run each of our full samples within a reasonable memory limit of 50 Gb, it was necessary to reduce the number of threads to 1, raise the kmer size ('k') to 15 and set the minibatch size ('-K') to 25M (i.e., the number of query bases that are processed at any time), prolonging the runtime of several samples to ~three days.\n\nAfter applying Minimap2 to the processed reads as explained above (section 2.2.4), we processed the resulting SAM files by firstly excluding all header rows starting with the '@' sign and then transforming the sets of read IDs, SILVA IDs, and alignment scores to TSV files of unique read-bacteria assignments either on the bacterial genus or family level. All reads that could not be assigned to the genus or family level were discarded, respectively.\n\nIn the case of read assignment to multiple taxa with the same alignment score, we determined the lowest taxonomic level in which these multiple taxa would be included. If this level was above the genus or family level, respectively, we discarded the read.\n\nAcross three independent sequencing replicates of the same linear bacterial community standard (section 2.2.1),\n\nwe found that the fraction of reads assigned to unexpected genus level taxa resides at ~1 % when using the Minimap2 classifier and the SILVA 132 database.\n\nRaw quantified DNA, PCR amplicons and sequencing read counts were considerably less abundant in DI water negative controls, as compared to actual freshwater specimens (Supplementary Table 2a Table 5 ).\n\nSample-specific rarefaction curves were generated by successive subsampling of sequencing reads classified by Figure 3 , section 2.4.1). Although we mainly present a single example rarefied dataset for our final downstream analyses, we repeated each analysis, including PCAs, hierarchical clustering and Mantel tests, based on additional rarefied datasets to assess the stability of the analyses.\n\nWe performed Mantel tests (using scikit-bio version 0.5.1) to compare rarefied datasets with the full dataset. We \n\nAll classification assessment steps and summary statistics were performed in R or python (https://github.com/dj-k/puntseq). We used the python package 'scikit-bio' for the calculation of the Simpson index and the Shannon's diversity as well as equitability index.\n\nRarefied read count data was subjected to log10(x+1) and Z-transformations. For the final PCA, negative and mock control samples were initially removed. Mock community samples were then aligned to the eigenspace determined by the water samples and added to plots displaying the main principal components (PCs explaining >10 % variance, respectively). For each of these relevant PCs, we further highlighted the 10 most important features (i.e., taxa with the largest weights) and their contributions to the PCs in barplots, and added the standard error across the three additional rarefied datasets.\n\n.

Additionally, we integrated known genera from a large wastewater reference collection 30 (Supplementary Table 6b ).\n\nTo identify if DNA reads assigned to Leptospiraceae were more similar to sequence reads of previously identified pathogenic, intermediate or environmental Leptospira species, we built a neighbour-joining tree of Leptospiraceae reads classified in our samples data, together with sequences from reference databases (Figure 3d ; species names and NCBI accession numbers in clockwise rotation around the tree in Supplementary Table 7a ). We matched the orientation of our reads, and then aligned them with 68 Leptospira reference sequences and the Leptonema illini reference sequence (DSM 21528 strain 3055) as outgroup. We then built a neighbour-joining tree using Muscle v.3.8.31 70 (excluding three reads in the \"Other Environmental\" clade that had extreme branch lengths >0.2). The reference sequences were annotated as pathogenic and saprophytic clades P1, P2, S1, S2 as recently described 35 .\n\nAdditional published river water Leptospira that did not fall within these clades were included as \"Other Environmental\" 71 . Similarly, we constructed phylogenies for the Legionella, Salmonella and Pseudomonas genus, using established full-length 16S reference species sequences from NCBI (Supplementary Table 7b-d).\n\nThis study was designed to enable freshwater microbiome monitoring in budget-constrained research environments. Although we had access to basic infrastructure such as pipettes, a PCR and TissueLyser II machine, as well a high-performance laptop, we wish to highlight that the total sequencing consumable costs were held below \u00a34,000. Here, individual costs ranged at ~\u00a375 per sample. With the current MinION flow cell price of \u00a3720, we estimate that per-sample costs could be further reduced to as low as ~\u00a315 when barcoding and pooling ~\u00a3100 samples in the same sequencing run (for details, see Supplementary Table 3 ).
