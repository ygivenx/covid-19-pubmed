Initial cryo-EM characterization of the SARS-CoV-1 spike revealed that the RBDs 28 adopted at least two distinct conformations. In the \"up\" conformation, the RBDs could be 29 observed jutting out away from the rest of S, such that they could easily engage ACE2 without 30 causing any steric clashes. In the \"down\" conformation, the RBDs were tightly packed against 31 the top of the S2 subunit, preventing binding by ACE2 (Gui et al., 2017) . Subsequent 32 experiments have corroborated this phenomenon and similar dynamics have been observed in 33 MERS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S and in alphacoronavirus S proteins (Jones et al., 2019; 34 Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Walls, 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 35 2017) . Due to the relatively low abundance of particles that can be observed by cryo-EM with 36 three RBDs in the up conformation, it is thought that this conformation may correspond to an 37 energetically unstable state (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017) . These observations 38 led to the hypothesis that the CoV RBDs may be acting as molecular ratchets, wherein a 39 receptor-binding event would trap the RBD in the less stable up conformation, leading to gradual 40 destabilization until S is finally triggered to initiate membrane fusion. Recent experiments 41 characterizing RBD-directed anti-SARS-CoV-1 antibodies that trap the SARS-CoV-1 RBD in 42 the up conformation and lead to destabilization of the prefusion spike have lent support to this 43 hypothesis (Walls et al., 2019) . 44\n\nreported and their mechanisms of neutralization can be attributed to the occlusion of the 46 receptor-binding site and to trapping the RBD in the unstable up conformation, effectively acting 47 as a receptor mimic that triggers a premature transition from the prefusion-to-postfusion 48 conformation (Hwang et al., 2006; Walls et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015) . 49\n\nHeavy chain-only antibodies (HCAbs), present in camelids, contain a single variable domain 50 (VHH) instead of two variable domains (VH and VL) that make up the equivalent antigen-51 binding fragment (Fab) of conventional IgG antibodies (Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993) . This 52 single variable domain, in the absence of an effector domain, is referred to as a single-domain 53 antibody, VHH or Nanobody\u00ae and typically can acquire affinities and specificities for antigens 54 comparable to conventional antibodies. VHHs can easily be constructed into multivalent formats 55\n\nand are known to have enhanced thermal stability and chemostability compared to most 56 antibodies (De Vlieger et al., 2018; Dumoulin et al., 2002; Govaert et al., 2012; Laursen et al., 57 2018; van der Linden et al., 1999) . Their advantageous biophysical properties have led to the 58 evaluation of several VHHs as therapeutics against common respiratory pathogens, such as 59 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Detalle et al., 2016; Rossey et al., 2017) . The use of VHHs as 60 biologics in the context of a respiratory infection is a particularly attractive application, since the 61 highly stable VHHs can be nebulized and administered via an inhaler directly to the site of 62 infection (Respaud et al., 2015) . Moreover, due to their stability after prolonged storage, VHHs 63 could be stockpiled as therapeutic treatment options in case of an epidemic. Although 64 therapeutics against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are sorely needed, the feasibility of using 65\n\nVHHs for this purpose has not yet been adequately explored. Several MERS-CoV S-directed 66\n\nTo map the epitopes targeted by the neutralizing VHHs, we tested binding to recombinant 114 MERS-CoV S1, RBD, NTD and SARS-CoV-1 RBD and NTD by ELISA (Figure 1A and S. 115 Figure 3 ).The MERS-CoV S-specific VHHs strongly bound to MERS-CoV S1 and RBD in a 116 concentration-dependent manner, and no binding to the MERS-CoV NTD was observed. 117\n\nSimilarly, strong binding of SARS VHH-72 to the SARS-CoV-1 RBD protein but not the SARS-118\n\nCoV-1 NTD protein was observed. Again, no binding of SARS VHH-44 to either the SARS-119\n\nCoV-1 RBD or NTD protein was detected. These data demonstrate that the neutralizing VHHs 120 SARS VHH-72 and MERS VHH-55 target the RBDs. Based on the specificity and potent 121 neutralizing capacity of SARS VHH-72 and MERS VHH-55, we measured the affinities of these 122\n\nVHHs by immobilizing recombinantly expressed VHH to an SPR sensorchip and determined the 123 binding kinetics for their respective RBDs. We found that both of these VHHs bound to their 124 targets with high affinity. SARS VHH-72 bound to its target with an affinity of 1.2 nM and 125 MERS VHH-55 bound to its target with an affinity of 79.2 pM, in part due to a very slow off-126 rate constant (kd = 8.2 x10 -5 s -1 ) ( Figure 1B) . 127\n\nTo investigate the molecular determinants that mediate potent neutralization and high-affinity 129 binding by MERS VHH-55, we solved the crystal structure of MERS VHH-55 bound to the 130 between the RBD and VHH, with the three CDRs forming extensive binding contacts with the 136 RBD, burying 716 \u00c5 2 of surface area by pinching the RBD between the CDR2 and CDR3. The 137 CDR3 of MERS VHH-55 is looped over the DPP4-binding interface, occluding DPP4 from 138 productively engaging the MERS-CoV RBD (Figure 2A-B) . 139\n\nThere are numerous contacts between the CDRs of MERS VHH-55 and the MERS-CoV 140 RBD, and the majority of these are confined to CDRs 2 and 3 ( Figure 2C-D) . The sole 141 interaction from the MERS VHH-55 CDR1 comes from Asp35 forming a salt bridge with 142\n\nArg542 from the RBD. CDR2 forms hydrogen bonds using Ser53 and Asp61 to engage RBD 143 residues Asp539 and Gln544. Furthermore, Asn58 from the CDR2 also engages Arg542 from the 144 RBD. Trp99 from the MERS VHH-55 CDR3 forms a salt bridge with Glu513 via the nitrogen 145 from its pyrrole ring. Finally, Glu95 from the MERS VHH-55 CDR3 also forms a salt bridge 146 with Arg542 from the MERS-CoV RBD, suggesting that Arg542 plays a critical role in MERS 147 VHH-55 binding since it is productively engaged by residues from all three CDRs. This arginine 148 has also been implicated in binding to the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4, and has previously been 149 identified as one of the twelve highly conserved amino acids that is crucial for high-affinity 150 receptor engagement (S. Figure 4A ) (Wang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014) . 151\n\nIn addition to forming a salt bridge with Glu513 from the MERS-CoV RBD, Trp99 of the 152 MERS VHH-55 CDR3 is positioned near a hydrophobic patch formed by Phe506 (S. Figure  153   4B ). This amino acid exhibits natural sequence variation in several MERS-CoV strains, such that 154 a Leu is occasionally observed at this position. To evaluate the extent to which this substitution 155 may impact MERS VHH-55 binding, we generated a F506L substitution and measured binding 156 by SPR (S. Figure 4C) . Surprisingly, this substitution resulted in a ~200-fold reduction in 55 to MERS-CoV RBD F506L remains high, with a KD = 16.5 nM. Other than the variability 159 that is observed at position 506 of the MERS-CoV RBD, the rest of the MERS VHH-55 epitope 160 is highly conserved across the 863 strains that are curated in the MERS-CoV Virus Variation 161 database (S. Figure 4A ). This high degree of epitope conservation suggests that VHH-55 would 162 broadly recognize MERS-CoV strains. 163\n\nWe also sought to discover the molecular determinants of binding between SARS VHH-164 72 and the SARS-CoV-1 RBD by determining the crystal structure of this complex. Crystals 165 grew in space group P3121 and diffracted X-rays to a resolution of 2.2 \u00c5. We obtained a 166 molecular replacement solution and refined the structure to an Rwork/Rfree of 20.3%/23.6% 167 through iterative building and refinement ( Table 2 ). Our structure reveals that CDRs 2 and 3 168 contribute to the majority of the 834 \u00c5 2 of buried surface area at the binding interface ( Figure  169 3A). This interface does not, however, overlap with the ACE2 binding interface. Rather, ACE2 170 would clash with the CDR-distal framework of SARS VHH-72 ( Figure 3B ). This clash would 171 only be enhanced by the presence of an N-linked glycan at Asn322 of ACE2, which is already 172 located within the VHH framework when the receptor-bound RBD is aligned to the VHH-bound 173 RBD ( Figure 3C) . 174 SARS VHH-72 binds to the SARS-CoV-1 RBD by forming an extensive hydrogen-bond 175 network via its CDRs 2 and 3 (Figure3D-E). Ser56 from the CDR2 simultaneously forms 176 hydrogen bonds with the peptide backbone of three residues from the SARS-CoV-1 RBD: 177\n\nLeu355, Tyr356 and Ser358. The peptide backbone of Ser358 also forms a hydrogen bond with 178 the backbone of neighboring Thr57 from the CDR2. A salt bridge formed between CDR2 residue 179 Asp61 and RBD residue Arg426 tethers the C-terminal end of the CDR2 to the RBD. The N-180 terminus of the CDR3 forms a short \u03b2-strand that pairs with a \u03b2-strand from the SARS-CoV-1 181 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

This interaction is mediated by 182 backbone hydrogen bonds from CDR3 residues Gly98, Val100 and Val100a to RBD residues 183 Cys366 and Phe364. Glu100c from the CDR3 forms hydrogen bonds with the sidechain 184 hydroxyls from both Ser362 and Tyr494 from the SARS-CoV-1 RBD. The neighboring CDR3 185 residue also engages in a sidechain-specific interaction by forming a salt bridge between the 186 pyrrole nitrogen of Trp100d and the hydroxyl group from RBD residue Thr363. Asp101 is 187 involved in the most C-terminal interaction from the CDR3 by forming a salt bridge with RBD 188 residue Lys365. The extensive interactions formed between CDRs 2 and 3 of SARS VHH-72 189 and the SARS-CoV-1 RBD explain the high-affinity binding that we observed between these 190 molecules. 191\n\nAnalysis of 10 available SARS-CoV-1 strain sequences revealed a high degree of conservation 193 in the residues that make up the SARS VHH-72 epitope, prompting us to explore the breadth of 194 SARS VHH-72 binding (S. Figure 5A ). WIV1-CoV is a betacoronavirus found in bats that is 195 closely related to SARS-CoV-1 and also utilizes ACE2 as a host-cell receptor (Ge et al., 2013) . 196 Due to the relatively high degree of sequence conservation between SARS-CoV and WIV1- CoV, 197 we expressed the WIV1-CoV RBD and measured binding to SARS VHH-72 by SPR (S. Figure  198 5B). SARS VHH-72 also exhibits high-affinity binding to the WIV1-CoV RBD (7.4 nM), 199 demonstrating that it is cross-reactive between these two closely related coronaviruses (S. Figure  200 \n\nBased on the high degree of structural homology that has been reported between SARS-202\n\nCoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 S (Walls, 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) , we also tested SARS VHH-72 203 for cross-reactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 by SPR (Figure 4) . The binding affinity 204 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

This diminished binding 205 affinity, compared to the binding of SARS VHH-72 to SARS-CoV-1 RBD, can primarily be 206 attributed to an increase in the dissociation rate constant of this interaction ( Figure 4A) . The 207 only variant residue on the SARS-CoV-1 RBD that makes direct contact with SARS VHH-72 is 208\n\nArg426, which is Asn439 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Figure 3C) . 209\n\nAs stated previously, the RBDs of MERS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 S undergo 211 dynamic conformational rearrangements that alternately mask and present their receptor-binding 212 interfaces and potential neutralizing epitopes to host molecules.

Based on the binding angles of MERS VHH-55 229 and SARS VHH-72, we can conclude that these molecules would likely disrupt the RBD 230 dynamics in the context of a full-length S protein by trapping the up conformation. Because this 231 up conformation is unstable and leads to S protein triggering, it is possible that this 232 conformational trapping may at least partially contribute to the neutralization mechanisms of 233 these VHHs. 234\n\nBased on our structural analysis, we hypothesized that another mechanism by which both 235 MERS VHH-55 and SARS VHH-72 neutralize their respective viral targets is by blocking the 236 interaction between the RBDs and their host-cell receptors. To test this hypothesis, we performed 237 a BLI-based assay in which the SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV RBDs were 238 immobilized to biosensor tips, dipped into VHHs and then dipped into wells containing the 239 recombinant, soluble host cell receptors. We found that when tips coated in the MERS-CoV 240 RBD were dipped into MERS VHH55 before being dipped into DPP4, there was no increase in 241 response that could be attributed to receptor binding. When tips coated with the MERS-CoV 242 RBD were dipped into SARS VHH-72 and then DPP4, a robust response signal was observed, as 243 expected. Similar results were observed when the analogous experiments were performed using 244 the SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, SARS VHH-72 and ACE2 ( Figure 5D ). These results 245 support our structural analysis that both MERS VHH-55 and SARS VHH-72 are capable of 246 neutralizing their respective viral targets by directly preventing host-cell receptor binding. 247\n\nDespite the relatively high-affinity binding that was observed by SPR between SARS VHH-72 249 and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, this binding could not be detected by ELISA nor was SARS VHH-250 .

In an 252 attempt to overcome this rapid dissociation, we engineered two bivalent variants of SARS VHH-253 72. These included a tail-to-head fusion of two SARS VHH-72 molecules connected by a 254 Fc to immobilized SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 further confirmed that bivalency was able to 265 compensate for the high off-rate constant of the monomer ( Figure 7A ). Furthermore, cross-266 neutralizing VHH-72-Fc construct reached expression levels of ~300 mg/L in ExpiCHO cells 267 ( Figure 7B ). Using VHH-72-Fc purified from ExpiCHO cells and a SARS-CoV-2 S 268 pseudotyped VSV with a luciferase reporter, we evaluated the neutralization capacity of VHH-269 72-Fc and found that it was able to neutralize pseudovirus with an IC50 of approximately 0.2 270 \u00b5g/mL ( Figure 7C) . 271 .

These VHHs bind to the spike RBDs with high affinity and are capable of neutralizing S 275 pseudotyped viruses in vitro. To our knowledge, the isolation and characterization of SARS-276\n\nCoV-1 S-directed VHHs have not been described before. Several MERS-CoV S-specific VHHs Figure 7A ). The epitope of SARS VHH-72 does 287 not significantly overlap with the epitopes of any previously described antibodies other than that 288 of the recently described CR3022, which is also capable of binding to the RBDs of both SARS-289\n\nCoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S (Hwang et al., 2006; Pak et al., 2009; Prabakaran et al., 2006; Walls 290 et al., 2019; Yuan M, 2020) Figure 7B ). However, unlike SARS VHH-72, CR3022 does not 291 prevent the binding of ACE2 and it lacks neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Tian et al., 292 2020; Yuan M, 2020) .

We show that by engineering a bivalent VHH-72-Fc construct, we 296 are able to compensate for the relatively high off-rate constant of the monovalent SARS VHH-297 72. This bivalent molecule expresses well in transiently transfected ExpiCHO cells (~300 mg/L) 298 and is capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S pseudoviruses in vitro. 299\n\nDue to the inherent thermostability and chemostability of VHHs, they have been 300 Animal Experiments of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (permit No. 13-601-1). Blood was collected 351 5 days after the last immunization for the preparation of lymphocytes. Total RNA from the 352 peripheral blood lymphocytes was extracted and used as template for the first strand cDNA 353 synthesis with oligo dT primer. Using this cDNA, the VHH encoding sequences were amplified 354 by PCR and cloned between the PstI and NotI sites of the phagemid vector pMECS. In the pMECS 355 vector, the VHH encoding sequence is followed by a linker, HA and His6 tag 356 (AAAYPYDVPDYGSHHHHHH). Electro-competent E.coli TG1 cells were transformed with the 357 recombinant pMECS vector resulting in a VHH library of about 3 x 10 8 independent transformants. 358\n\nThe resulting TG1 library stock was then infected with VCS M13 helper phages to obtain a library 359 of VHH-presenting phages.

A) The MERS-CoV spike (PDB ID: 5W9H) is shown as a molecular surface, with each monomer colored either white, gray or tan. The tan and white monomers are bound by MERS VHH-55, shown as blue ribbons. The clash between MERS VHH-55 bound to the white monomer and the neighboring tan RBD is highlighted by the red ellipse. B) The SARS-CoV-1 spike (PDB ID: 5X58) is shown as a molecular surface, with each protomer colored either white, gray or pink. Every monomer is bound by a copy of SARS VHH-72, shown as dark blue ribbons. The clashes between copies of SARS VHH-72 and the two neighboring spike monomers are highlighted by the red circle. C) The SARS-CoV-2 spike (PDB ID: 6VXX) is shown as a molecular surface, with each protomer colored either white, gray or green.
