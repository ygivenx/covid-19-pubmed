{"title": "Final 2013 Reports of Nationally Notifiable Infectious Diseases", "body": "Table 2 listed on pages 703\u201315 summarizes finalized data, as of June 30, 2014, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) for 2013. These data will be published in more detail next year in the Summary of Notifiable Diseases \u2014 United States, 2013 (1). Because no cases were reported in the United States during 2013, the following diseases do not appear in these early release tables: anthrax; diphtheria; eastern equine encephalitis, nonneuroinvasive disease; poliovirus infection, nonparalytic; severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV); smallpox; St. Louis encephalitis, nonneuroinvasive disease; western equine encephalitis, neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive disease; yellow fever; and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Data on chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infection (past or present) are not included because they are undergoing data quality review. Data for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnoses do not appear because CDC is transitioning to a new system for processing national HIV surveillance data, and will be published in the Summary of Notifiable Diseases \u2014 United States, 2013.\n\nPolicies for reporting NNDSS data to CDC can vary by disease or reporting jurisdiction depending on case status classification (i.e., confirmed, probable, or suspected). The publication criteria used for the 2013 finalized tables are listed in the \u201cPrint Criteria\u201d column of the NNDSS event code list, available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/nndss_event_code_list_2013_revised.pdf. In addition, only cases from reporting jurisdictions where the nationally notifiable disease is reportable are published. The NNDSS website is updated annually to include the latest national surveillance case definitions approved by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists for classifying and enumerating cases of nationally notifiable infectious diseases.\n\nPopulation estimates are from the National Center for Health Statistics postcensal estimates of the resident population of the United States for July 1, 2010\u2013July 1, 2012, by year, county, single year of age (0 to \u226585 years), bridged-race (white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander), Hispanic ethnicity (not Hispanic or Latino, Hispanic or Latino), and sex (vintage 2012), prepared under a collaborative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau. Population estimates for states are available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm#vintage2012. Population estimates for territories are 2012 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau (2)."}
