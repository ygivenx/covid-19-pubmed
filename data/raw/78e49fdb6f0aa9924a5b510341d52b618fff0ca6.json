{"title": "A Multiscale and Comparative Model for Receptor Binding of 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the Implication of its Life Cycle in Host Cells", "body": "The coronavirus disease 2019 has emerged at the end of year 2019 2 from Wuhan, a city in China, as a new infectious disease [1, 2] . It has been found that the replicated RNA genome and synthesized viral proteins are finally assembled together into 10 new viruses, before they escape and attack other cells [7, 8] . As a result, the infections of 11 2019-nCoV normally come with the similar symptoms as SARS, including fever, 12 respiratory difficulty and pneumonia [9, 10] . Different from SARS, however, the new 13 COVID-19 seems to have longer incubation period and thus is more contagious [11] . The 14 disease has caused more than 70,000 confirmed cases with at least 1000 death globally, 15 according to the data from the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 16 th 2020. 16 Therefore, the development of vaccine or therapeutic treatment for this ongoing public 17 health crisis is highly demanding [12, 13] . 18 Almost all the coronaviruses recognize their host cells through spike (S) proteins 19 [14, 15] . S-protein is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of viral envelop as homo-20 trimers [16] . Each S-protein further consists of two subunits. The S1 subunit includes a 21 region called receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is used to target receptors in host 22 cells, while the S2 subunit regulates the membrane fusion between virus and host cells 23 [17] . These roles of S protein suggest that it could be a key target for vaccine and 24 therapeutics developed to neutralize virus infection by blocking their invasion [18] . 25 Moreover, it has been confirmed in a recent report that the new virus 2019-nCoV uses the 26 same cell entry receptor ACE2 as SARS coronavirus [19] . The atomic structures of 27 complex between human ACE2 and the RBD regions from S-protein of SARS-CoV have 28 been obtained by x-ray crystallography [17] . It was also shown that the sequence of S-29 protein from SARS-CoV shares more than 70% identity with the S-protein from 2019-30 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the new coronavirus uses the 1 similar binding interface with ACE2 as SARS to enter host cells of human. The obvious [20-26]. Therefore, here we developed a multiscale computational strategy to compare 10 the process of recognition between the SARS-CoV and host cells with the interactions 11 between the new coronavirus and host cells. A mesoscale model is used to simulate the 12 process in which the coronaviruses are captured by ACE2 receptors on cell surface. We 13 further constructed a structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and RBD of 14 2019-nCoV S-protein, so that the rate of their association can be estimated by a coarse-15 grained Monte-Carlo simulation and further compared with the binding of S-protein from 16 SARS-CoV. Our simulation indicates that association of the new virus to the receptor is 17 slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. 18 We integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a simple 19 mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay 20 with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that the slower association 21 between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining 22 a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our computational study 23 therefore explains, from the molecular level, why the new COVID-19 disease is by far 24 more contagious than SARS. In summary, this multiscale model serves as a useful 25 addition to current understanding for the spread of coronaviruses and related infectious 26 agents.\n\nA rigid-body (RB) based model is first constructed to simulate the kinetic process 29 about how viruses are captured by the cell surface receptors on plasma membrane.

The area of the square is 1 \u00b5m 2 , while the 2 height of the simulation box is 500 nm. A number of ACE2 receptors (200) are initially 3 placed on the membrane surface (pink in Figure 1a ). They are represented by rigid 4 bodies of cylinders and their binding sites are located on top of the cylinders (red dots in 5 Figure 1a ). The height of each cylinder is 10nm and its radius is 5nm. On the other hand, 6 space above the plasma membrane represents the extracellular region. A number of 7 coronaviruses are located in this area (golden in Figure 1a) . Each virus is simplified as a 8 spherical rigid body with a given radius (40nm). Trimeric S-proteins are uniformly 9 distributed on the spherical surface of each virus (green dots in Figure 1a ). Each S-10 protein can interact with an ACE2 receptor on plasma membrane. After any S-protein on 11 one virus forms an encounter complex with a receptor, we assume that the host cell is 12 captured by the virus. The dissociation between the virus and the receptor is not 13 considered in the system, because we also assume that, after the association between S-14 protein and ACE2, the virus can enter the cell through membrane fusion. Following the 15 initial random configuration, the diffusion of receptors and viruses, as well as their 16 association, were simulated by a diffusion-reaction algorithm until the system reached 17 equilibrium. The detail process of the simulation is specified in the Methods. 18 Before the rigid-body simulation, in order to provide a more realistic estimation 19 on the binding between ACE2 and different coronaviruses, we specifically compared the 20 S-protein from 2019-nCoV with the S-protein from SARS. We applied our previously 21 developed residue-based kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) method to simulate the associate 22 processes of these two systems. In detail, the atomic coordinates of the complex between The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 the distance between their binding interfaces is fallen within a given cutoff value d c of 20 1 \u00c5. At the end of each trajectory, receptor and viral protein either form an encounter 2 complex through their binding interface observed in the complex structure, or diffuse 3 away from each other. Based on the simulation results collected from all the 500 4 trajectories, we counted how many times an encounter complex can be formed by the end 5 of the simulation time, which gives the probability of association. As a result, the 6 comparison of calculated probabilities of association for both systems is plotted in Figure   7 2a. 8 The figure shows that probability of association between ACE2 and the S-protein 9 from 2019-nCoV is remarkably lower than the probability of association between ACE2 10 and the S-protein from SARS. Specifically, among the 500 simulation trajectories of which is quantitatively consistent with our simulation results. 23 We then fed the information derived from the structure-based simulations into the 24 rigid-body model. Two specific simulation systems were compared. A relatively fast rate 25 of association between receptors and S-proteins on viral surfaces was adopted in the first 26 system to represent the binding process of SARS, while a relatively slow rate of 27 association between receptors and S-proteins on viral surfaces was adopted in the second 28 system to represent the binding process of 2019-nCoV. All the other parameters such as 29 diffusion constants and concentrations in both systems remain the same. As a result, the 30 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Without surprise, the figure shows that although almost all 2 viruses were attached to the cell surfaces by the end of both simulations, the kinetic 3 process in the SARS system is much faster than the 2019-nCoV system, which is resulted 4 from the difference in the association rate between receptors and their corresponding S-5 proteins. This leads into the fact that during the early stage of simulations, more SARS 6 viruses attach to host cells than 2019-nCoV. For instance, when the simulations in both 7 systems reached the first 10 5 nanoseconds, there have already been more than 40 SARS 8 viruses attached to the cell surfaces. In contrast, there were less than 20 viruses attached 9 to the cell surfaces within the same amount of time in the 2019-nCoV system.\n\nConsidering that the function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than 11 thermodynamic, control [28, 29] , we suggest that this time-dependent behavior is 12 biologically more relevant. In reality, not all the viruses have the opportunity to find their 13 target receptors on host cells. Many of them will be recognized and removed by our 14 innate immune system. Therefore, the capability of how fast a specific type of 15 coronavirus can target its receptors is especially critical to the process of its invasion, as 16 well as the follow-up stages in its life cycle.\n\nIn order to further explore the impacts of our rigid-body simulation results on the cells. On the other side, in order to avoid viral spread, our innate immune system triggers 29 inflammatory signaling pathways in the infected cells [30] . For instance, the viral RNAs The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.958272 doi: bioRxiv preprint receptors initiates the signaling cascade by interacting with the mitochondrial antiviral-1 signaling (MAVS) protein [32] . The aggregation of MAVS on the surface of 2 mitochondria will trigger the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway that turns on gene expression of 3 specific cytokines [S] to stimulate the inflammatory responses [33, 34] . The inflammation 4 of host organism leads to the apoptosis of infected cells and the removal of virus by 5 recruited immune cells such as microphages. In summary, the change of concentration for 6 each variable in above system can be described by following set of ordinary differential 7 equations (ODE).\n\n15\n\nEquation (1) and k a represent rates of viral protein translation, assembly and releasing.

The 4 rigid-body simulation suggests that SARS-CoV binds to receptor ACE2 faster than 19-5 nCoV, given the same amount of time. Therefore, we applied the mathematical model to 6 two comparative systems. A relatively fast viral binding rate k b was adopted in the first 7 system to represent the binding process of SARS, while a relatively slow rate was 8 adopted in the second to represent the binding process of 2019-nCoV.

The 3 figure suggests that the dynamics of the system can be divided into three stages (a). We 4 further applied the model to two comparative systems. A relatively fast viral binding rate 5 k b was adopted in the first system to represent the binding process of SARS, while a 6 relatively slow rate was adopted in the second to represent the binding process of 2019-7 nCoV. As shown in (b), we found that the first stage in the simulation of 2019-nCoV (red 8 curve) is longer than the simulation of SARS (black curve), while the level of free virus 9 at the end of the first period in 2019-nCoV is relatively higher than the corresponding 10 level of free virus in SARS.
