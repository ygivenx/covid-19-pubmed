{"title": "Characterization of Murine Coronavirus Neutralization Epitopes with Phage-Displayed Peptides", "body": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses of the Coronaviridae family (Holmes and Lai, 1996) . Among the identified viral structural proteins, the surface (S) glycoprotein forms spike projections from the surface of the virion and is involved in binding to cellular receptors and in membrane fusion (Collins et al., 1982; Sturman et al., 1985; Williams et al., 1991) . It is also the target of humoral and cellular immune responses (Collins et al., 1982; Stohlman et al., 1995; Williamson and Stohlman, 1990) . Moreover, various reports have emphasized the protective capacity of anti-S glycoprotein antibodies (Buchmeier et al., 1984; Nakanaga et al., 1986) . A proteolytic cleavage site divides the S glycoprotein into two subunits, the N-terminal S1 and the C-terminal S2 (Spaan et al., 1988; Sturman et al., 1985) . It is believed that S1 forms the bulbous part of the spike and S2 the stalk portion (De Groot et al., 1987) . It has also been shown that the N-terminal region of the S1 subunit is involved in binding to the cellular receptor (Kubo et al., 1994) . Murine coronaviruses, also called mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV), induce various respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological infections in rodents. The neurotropic strains A59 and JHM lead to infections of the central nervous system that result in an acute lethal encephalitis (Cheever et al., 1949; Weiner, 1973) . Mice who survive the acute infection develop a chronic demyelinating disease resembling human multiple sclerosis (Siddell et al., 1983) .\n\nWe have used a panel of specific mAbs to characterize the molecular determinants of the S glycoprotein that are involved in the induction of a protective immune response against MHV-A59-induced lethal encephalitis. MAbs 7-10A, 5B19, and 5B170 were selected for the present study since they neutralize virus infectivity in vitro and passively protect BALB/c mice against lethal infection in vivo (Buchmeier et al., 1984; Daniel and Talbot, 1990 ). MAb 7-10A was predicted to recognize a discontinuous epitope on the S1 subunit since it did not bind to the denatured S glycoprotein in Western immunoblots (Daniel and Talbot, 1990 ) and did bind to purified, native S1 subunit (P. J. Talbot and K. V. Holmes, unpublished data) . In contrast, mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 recognize linear epitopes within an immunodominant region of the S2 subunit (Daniel et al., 1993) ; critical binding residues have been identified for mAb 5B19 (Luytjes et al., 1989) . A previous study using papain-and pepsin-derived fragments or recombinant single chain Fv molecules derived from mAb 7-10A showed that the Fc portion of this antibody is not required for neutralization of MHV-A59 in vitro and in vivo (Lamarre and Talbot, 1995; Lamarre et al., 1997) ; this mAb can also induce protective anti-idiotypic antibodies (Yu et al., 1996) .\n\nPhage-displayed peptide libraries offer an attractive approach for the identification of discontinuous (Chen et al., 1996; Hoess et al., 1994) and linear peptide ligands for mAbs (Cwirla et al., 1990; Felici et al., 1991; Hoess et al., 1994; Scott and Smith, 1990; Stephen and Lane, 1992) and for studying the immunogenic properties of the selected sequences (de la Cruz et al., 1988; Demangel et al., 1996; Minenkova et al., 1993; Prezzi et al., 1996) . We now report on the characterization of epitopes recognized by protective anti-coronavirus antibodies and the direct use of a selected phage to evaluate protective immune responses in mice. Partial protection correlated with the production of specific antiviral antibodies.\n\nSelection and characterization of phage-displayed peptides by mAbs 7-10A, 5B19, and 5B170\n\nThe mAbs 7-10A, 5B19, and 5B170 were used to screen, side by side, different conformationally constrained and unconstrained phage libraries. As indicated in Table 1 , phage pools having the highest yields and ELISA signals were selected for further study. From these, phage clones were isolated and sequenced in the nucleotide region encoding the displayed peptides (Table 2). As illustrated in Table 1 , the highest yields in rounds 3 and 4 of panning for all three mAbs were from libraries displaying one or two fixed cysteine residues, (405-490 nm) and the ELISA data showed further restriction of the tightest binding phage to a single library for each mAb. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of the selected phage allowed the identification of consensus sequences for peptides recognized by the antiviral mAbs 5B19 and 5B170, which recognize continuous epitopes ( Table 2 ). The critical binding sequence for each of these two mAbs was very similar since phage selected by both mAbs cross-reacted: phage selected by mAb 5B170 were recognized strongly by mAb 5B19 and vice versa, albeit at a lower level, whereas no phage reacted with the isotypic control mAb (Fig. 1) . For mAb 7-10A, which recognizes a discontinuous epitope (Daniel and Talbot, 1990) , consensus amino acid sequences were more difficult to identify; this is typical of antibodies against discontinuous epitopes (e.g., see Felici et al., 1993; Luzzago et al., 1993) . Figure 2 illustrates the amino acid identities between selected phage-displayed peptides and murine coronavirus S glycoprotein sequences. In contrast with other studies (Balass et al., 1993; Felici et al., 1993; , amino acid identity was obtained for phage 12.9, selected by mAb 7-10A, and a linear region of the S glycoprotein of several coronavirus strains. The 7-10A FIG. 1. ELISA for determining cross-reactive phage recognition by mAbs 5B19 and 5B170. Microtiter plates were coated with 1 g/ml of the indicated mAbs, and binding of varying amounts of mAb 5B19-and 5B170-selected phage was determined using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-M13 conjugate. Open symbols represent phage selected by mAb 5B19 (except \u1b80, control vector phage f88.4), and filled symbols represent phage selected by mAb 5B170. mAb recognizes a discontinuous epitope on S1, as shown by binding studies on isolated S glycoprotein subunits (P. J. Talbot and K. V. Holmes, unpublished data) . Clone 12.9 contains two cysteines and bears similarities to residues 153-161 of the S glycoprotein of MHV. This clone represents the first sequence information obtained on the epitope recognized by mAb 7-10A.\n\nFor mAb 5B170, Fig. 2 shows that three different phage clones had amino acid identity with sequences of the S glycoprotein of MHV. Sequences within and including the C(V/I)GSXC consensus of clones 7.2 and 8.3 show a match of 6 amino acids within residues 850-857 of MHV-A59 , 902-909 of MHV-4 (Schmidt et al., 1987) and MHV-JHM (cl-2) (Taguchi et al., 1992) , and 761-768 of MHV-JHM (Grosse and Siddell, 1993) . Moreover, the matching sequence of clone 8.3 represents an almost exact match with the residues mentioned above since the Ile to Val amino acid change is conservative. Finally, the matching sequence observed for clone 9.1 shares almost complete identity with residues 890-897 of MHV-Y (Kunita et al., 1995) ; it also shares 6 amino acids with the same residues described above. This is the first detailed information reported on the epitope recognized by mAb 5B170, which was only known to bind to an immunodominant region on the S2 subunit of the S glycoprotein (Daniel et al., 1993) . This epitope appears to be conserved among several strains of MHV.\n\nWe used mAb 5B19 as a positive control for our experiments since synthetic peptide scanning (PEPSCAN) was previously used to characterize the epitope recognized by this mAb (Luytjes et al., 1989) . The peptide sequence that it selected bears the C(V/I)GSXC consensus identified by mAb 5B170, confirming our results. This result is consistent with previous epitope mapping by ELISA (Daniel et al., 1993) showing that mAbs 5B170 and 5B19 compete with each other for binding to virus. The sequences of the binding regions for both antibodies are identical in MHV-JHM and A59, suggesting that the epitopes recognized by mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 are conserved on the S2 subunit of MHV. To exclude the possibility that these two mAbs are the same or a closely related antibody, the V H regions of both antibodies were sequenced. Table 3 illustrates the very different amino acid sequences of complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of mAbs used in this study.\n\nTo evaluate the importance of disulfide bridging in binding to mAbs, an ELISA test was performed in the presence or absence of the reducing agent DTT. The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that disulfide bridging within the phage-displayed peptides was more important for recognition by mAb 7-10A than for mAbs 5B19 and 5B170, since the binding of mAb 7-10A with peptides was more affected by DTT. As a control, immobilized virus was also treated with DTT; the binding of mAb 7-10A to virus was not affected (Fig. 3B) . However, the binding of mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 with the virus was unexpectedly more affected when the virus was treated with DTT. The results suggest that the two cysteines observed in the peptides recognized by mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 may directly interact with the mAb binding site or that disulfide constraints are important but not absolutely required for binding. The alignment analysis shown in Fig. 2C , in which two cysteines form a portion of the epitope, is supported by the fact that several of the clones selected by mAb 5B170 came from the X8CX8 library, in which only one Cys residue is fixed. The second, C-terminal Cys residue in the sequence was selected by mAb from a fully randomized residue.\n\nIt was previously shown that the epitope recognized by mAb 5B19 is able to protect BALB/c mice when used as an immunogen (Daniel et al., 1993; Koolen et al., 1990) . Having identified peptides that are recognized by three in vitro neutralizing and in vivo protective mAbs, we examined whether these peptides, displayed on the phage surface, could be used directly as immunogens for the induction of neutralizing and protective antibodies in mice. Selected phage showing relatively strong ELISA signals were injected into both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice; it has been shown that C57BL/10 mice respond better than BALB/c mice for induction of specific antipeptide antibodies, using the phage itself as a carrier molecule (de la Cruz et al., 1988) . Four ip injections were given, followed by viral challenge 10 days after the last injection. The survival of mice was then evaluated. As shown in Fig. 4 , of all the different phage selected by the three mAbs, only the mAb 5B170-selected clone 9.1 induced a statistically significant protective immune response against a lethal coronavirus infection. Three of six C57BL/6 mice were protected, whereas no BALB/c mice immunized with the same phage 9.1 survived the viral challenge. Mice immunized with control vector phage or other selected phage died between days 4 and 9 after the viral challenge, a normal outcome of acute viral encephalitis. The observed survival of one of six C57BL/6 mice immunized with clone 12.4 selected by mAb 7-10A was not statistically significant.\n\nTo evaluate the possible humoral immune mechanisms underlying the observed, statistically significant protection of C57BL/6 mice by the mAb 5B170-selected clone 9.1, postimmunization plasma samples were tested by ELISA for the detection of antiviral antibodies. Antiviral antibodies were specifically induced in protected C57BL/6 mice (Table 4) ; this was statistically significant with a P value of 0.01 from the Mann-Whitney test (comparing means at a 1/500 plasma dilution). No statistically significant levels of specific antiviral antibodies were detected in mice immunized with other selected phage or the control phage vector, suggesting a strong correlation between the presence of specific antiviral antibodies and protection.\n\nTo confirm the specificity of the antiviral antibodies induced by clone 9.1 to the displayed peptide, two complementary experimental approaches were used. First, Western blotting was performed with a bacterially expressed immunodominant S2 subunit region that includes the mAb 5B19 and 5B170 epitopes. As shown in with clone 9.1 strongly and specifically recognized the immunodominant S2 subunit region, as did mAb 5B170 used for panning. Even BALB/c mice, which were not protected against the viral infection, had raised specific antibodies to the immunodominant S2 subunit region, although the response appeared weaker (fainter bands). The immunoglobulin isotypic control and preimmune plasma, as well as plasma from mice immunized with other phage, did not recognize the immunodominant region, confirming the specificity of antiviral antibodies to the phage-displayed peptides.\n\nSecond, a more quantitative and precise assay was used: synthetic peptide ELISA. We initially used synthetic peptide hexamers corresponding to consensus sequences observed on phages that reacted more strongly with virus-specific mAbs ( Table 2) : CIGSQC (phage clones 9. 1, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, and 9 .9 selected with mAb 5B170 and phage clones 33.2, 33.4, 33.5, 33.6, and 33.9 selected with mAb 5B19) and CIGSYC (phage clones 7.2, 7.4, 7.6, 7.7, and 7.8 selected with mAb 5B170). All peptides were tested with plasma of immunized mice and the corresponding mAbs in both linear and conformationally con- FIG. 4 . Survival of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice immunized with phage-displayed mAb-selected peptides. Groups of six mice were immunized ip with different selected phage and then challenged intracerebrally with 10 LD 50 of MHV-A59. Phage clones selected by mAb 7-10A: 10.3 (s), 11.1 (F), 11.5 (OE), 12.4 (}), 12.9 (). Clones selected by mAb 5B19: 33.2 (s). Clones selected by mAb 5B170: 9.1 (s), 7.2 (F), 8.3 (), 8.1 (}). Control vector phage, f88.4 (OE). Protection of C57BL/6 mice by clone 9.1 was statistically significant and is representative of two separate experiments. strained cyclic forms. However, using various amounts of peptides and different buffers, we could barely demonstrate reactivity with mAbs and did not observe reactions with plasma of immunized mice (data not shown). We concluded that the peptides were too short for binding to the plastic of the microtiter plates and instead used the 13-mer peptide A that we had previously identified and used in ELISA (Spaan et al., 1988) . This peptide bears a CIGSTC sequence that is very similar to both consensus sequences described above and is flanked on either side by three amino acids from the viral S protein sequence. As shown in Fig. 6 , only mice immunized with phage clone 9.1 reacted specifically with peptide A and C57BL/6 mice produced higher titers of peptide-specific antibodies than BALB/c mice. Interestingly, reactivities were seen only with the linear peptide, suggesting that disulfide bridging is not involved in antibody binding, thereby adding strength to data obtained with DTT ( Fig. 3) .\n\nTo evaluate possible mechanisms of protection mediated by specific antiviral antibodies, we evaluated the in vitro virus neutralization activity. As shown in Table 4 , no in vitro neutralization activity was detected at dilutions of plasma samples that could be tested, down to a dilution FIG. 5 . Western blot analysis of virus-specific antibody in the plasma of mice immunized with selected phage-displayed peptides.

The molecular mass of 49.7 kDa represents the immunodominant region expressed in Escherichia coli.\n\nFIG. 6. ELISA analysis of peptide A-specific antibody in the plasma of mice immunized with selected phage-displayed peptides. Microtiter plates were coated with 5 g/ml peptide A and incubated with serial threefold dilutions of plasma from C57BL/6 (left) or BALB/c (right) mice immunized with phage 9.1, 7.2, or 33.2 or control phage vector f88. of 1/50. Moreover, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytolysis (ADCC) and antibody-dependent complementmediated cytolysis (ADCMC) activities were also evaluated, but such activities were not detected either (down to a dilution 1/50 for ADCC and 1/10 for ADCMC; data not shown). Positive control mAbs were used in all the in vitro assays (except for the ADCC assay because, to our knowledge, no positive mAb is available in the coronavirus system). For unknown reasons and despite numerous attempts in our laboratory, ADCC activities could not be demonstrated for various anti-MHV mAbs (data not shown).\n\nIn summary, we have used three in vitro neutralizing and in vivo protective anti-MHV mAbs to select phagedisplayed peptides, which allowed further characterization of immunologically relevant epitopes on the S glycoprotein of MHV-A59. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate in vivo induction with a phage-displayed peptide of specific antiviral antibodies that were associated with a partial but significant protection.\n\nIn this study, we used a panel of constrained and unconstrained phage-displayed peptide libraries to define binding motifs for and map the epitopes recognized by three murine coronavirus-specific mAbs. MAb 7-10A was thought to bind a discontinuous epitope (Daniel and Talbot, 1990) on the S1 subunit of the S glycoprotein of murine coronavirus (P. J. Talbot and K. V. Holmes, unpublished data); whereas mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 were known to bind linear epitopes on the S2 subunit of the S glycoprotein (Daniel et al., 1993) . Previous studies have shown that peptides can mimic linear, discontinuous, and even nonproteinaceous epitopes (Harris et al., 1997; Oldenburg et al., 1992; Scott et al., 1992; Zhong et al., 1994) . All three mAbs selected binding phage from libraries encoding one or two fixed cysteine residues, but not from the unconstrained peptide libraries. Many of the sequences of the mAb-selected phage bore similarity with linear regions on the S glycoprotein of several murine coronaviruses. Immunization studies with a number of the tightest binding phage revealed that one clone, whose displayed peptide was a linear-epitope mimic, was able to induce protective immunity in a significant proportion of mice.\n\nFor discontinuous epitopes, only limited identity is usually found between the sequence of a peptide mimic and that of the corresponding epitope on the protein antigen Luzzago et al., 1993) . Despite the lack of an obvious consensus sequence among the clones selected with mAb 7-10A (Table 2) , clone 12.9, which reacted relatively strongly in ELISA, shares five to six homologous amino acids with a linear region between amino acids 153 and 161 of the S1 subunit of the S glycoprotein (Fig. 2) . This N-terminal, globular domain is involved in the binding of virus to cells (Kubo et al., 1994) ; however, for several reasons, the epitope recognized by mAb 7-10A is probably not directly involved in binding to the cellular receptor. First, we have previously shown that mAb 7-10A only weakly inhibits virus binding to the cell, whereas it strongly neutralizes viral infectivity after the virus binds to the cell (Y. Salvas, S. Lemieux, and P. J. Talbot, unpublished data). In contrast, mAb 5B19, whose epitope is located on the C-terminal, stalk-like S2 subunit, is far more potent than mAb 7-10A in inhibiting viral binding to cells (Y. Salvas, S. Lemieux, and P. J. Talbot, unpublished data). Second, clone 12.9 did not inhibit the attachment of MHV-A59 to DBT cells (data not shown), suggesting that the displayed peptide did not bind to the cellular receptor. Third, in a recent study (Saeki et al., 1997) , it was shown that amino acid residues 62-65 on S1 are involved in binding to the cellular receptor; the mAb 7-10A epitope mimic displayed by clone 12.9 (Fig. 2) does not localize within this region.\n\nDespite the potential for conformational mimicry, mice immunized with clone 12.9 phage (as well as other phage selected by mAb 7-10A) did not survive a lethal dose of coronavirus (Fig. 4) . Presumably, the peptides selected by this mAb did not mimic the complete discontinuous epitope sufficiently and/or did not bind strongly enough to elicit detectable cross-reactivity with the viral antigen. The binding of mAb 7-10A to several clones that did not bear the same peptide sequence as clone 12.9 indicates that further studies using, for example, synthetic peptides bearing amino acid replacements in the sequence of the clone 12.9 peptide are needed to pinpoint the exact nature of this epitope. Such studies will be important given the apparent importance of this epitope in the virus life cycle. Indeed, we have been unable to select viable mAb 7-10A-resistant virus variants (P. J. Talbot, unpublished data) and mAb 7-10A very efficiently protects against acute viral infection (Daniel and Talbot, 1990) , without apparent involvement of the Fc portion (Lamarre and Talbot, 1995; Lamarre et al., 1997) .\n\nPhage selected by mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 showed consensus sequences that share homology with the S2 subunit of the S glycoprotein. The C(I/V)GSXC motif selected by mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 from different phage libraries highlights the importance of these residues to antibody binding. Most phage selected by both mAbs bear two Cys residues separated by four amino acids. Peptides with this Cys pattern were even selected from libraries in which only one Cys was fixed (i.e., the X8CX8 library), suggesting the importance of the positions of the two Cys in binding mAb. Yet, binding to these peptides was only mildly affected by reducing conditions (Fig. 3) , indicating that disulfide-bridge formation is not an absolute requirement for binding and that the Cys residues may be interacting directly with the antibody binding site. This was confirmed by demonstrating that only linear peptide A reacted with antibody.\n\nPrevious studies suggest that mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 recognize identical or overlapping linear epitopes located within the immunodominant region of the S2 subunit (Daniel et al., 1993; Luytjes et al., 1989) . Our data are consistent with these observations, since phage selected by both mAbs bear consensus sequences that are similar to a portion of the epitope characterized by Luytjes et al. (1989) . Moreover, phage selected by either mAb were recognized by both mAbs, albeit with weaker binding for mAb 5B170 (Fig. 1) . This confirms that both mAbs recognize similar epitopes and that 5B19 has a stronger affinity than 5B170 for peptides selected by either antibody (Fig. 1) . The sequences of CDRs H1, H2, and H3 for the two mAbs bore little similarity and the mAbs derive from different V H families (Table 3) . Since the heavy-chain CDRs are likely to be involved in antigen binding (Ward et al., 1989) , our results strongly suggest that these mAbs bind similar or identical epitopes on the S2 subunit by different mechanisms.\n\nTight-binding phage selected by mAbs 7-10A, 5B19, and 5B170 were used as antigens to immunize BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Of all the phage tested, only clone 9.1, selected by mAb 5B170, induced a statistically significant protective immune response in C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 4) , which correlated with the production of statistically significant levels of antiviral antibodies (Table 4 ), confirming that the S glycoprotein epitope mimicked by the phageborne peptide is immunogenic in mice. Surprisingly, biological activities by which antibodies could mediate protection of C57BL/6 mice, such as neutralization, ADCC, and ADCMC, were not detected. However, the presence of antibodies specific to the immunodominant region of the S2 subunit and to the relevant 13-mer peptide A correlated with the protection observed (Figs. 5 and 6, respectively). These results suggest the important role of the specific humoral immune response in clone 9.1-induced protection.\n\nInterestingly, unprotected BALB/c mice immunized with clone 9.1 produced antiviral antibodies that reacted specifically with the immunodominant region of the S2 subunit in Western blots (Fig. 5) and with peptide A in ELISA (Fig. 6) ; however, as suggested by the intensities of the blotting signals (Fig. 5 ) and the optical densities observed in ELISA (Fig. 6) , the concentration of antibodies was probably too low to protect these animals from a lethal coronavirus infection. Indeed, a recent report suggests that a minimal antibody concentration in serum is necessary for in vivo protection against vesicular stomatitis virus infection and that protection is independent of antibody subclass, avidity, and in vitro neutralizing activity (Bachmann et al., 1997) . Furthermore, we have previously shown that BALB/c mice were protected against MHV infection by immunization with synthetic peptide A, which includes the epitope found by Luytjes et al. (1989) , when coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. In this case, the protected mice also developed virus-specific antibodies that did not neutralize the virus in vitro (Daniel et al., 1994) .\n\nPhage from clone 9.1 induced protective immunity, whereas the phage from other clones bearing the C(I/ V)GSXC consensus sequence did not (Fig. 4) , even though their ELISA signals were similar (Table 2) . This apparent discrepancy may be explained by differences between clones in the sequences flanking the consensus sequence. These flanking residues could alter the conformation of the presented peptide (Vijayakrishnan et al., 1997) and, in only some cases, allow it to select virus cross-reactive B cell clones. Thus, by allowing the mAbs to select binding peptides from random-peptide libraries, we were able to identify flanking regions that could not have been anticipated a priori. This emphasizes the major contribution that random-peptide libraries can make in identifying immunogenic epitopes.\n\nOur use of the phage vector f88.4 (Bonnycastle et al., 1996) was in part based on the work of Greenwood et al. (1991) , who showed that peptides expressed on the pVIII major coat protein are more immunogenic than those expressed on the pIII minor coat protein; presumably, this is due to the higher copy number of the displayed peptide. Moreover, it has also been shown that peptides displayed on phage induce a stronger immune response than a peptide coupled to another carrier molecule (de la Cruz et al., 1988; Lenstra et al., 1992; Meola et al., 1995) . However, other studies have demonstrated that phagedisplayed peptides selected by mAbs are not necessarily immunogenic. For example, a study by Felici et al. (1993) reported that phage clones selected for their ability to bind a mAb against the Bordetella pertussis toxin failed to elicit a specific immune response against the toxin, whereas similar work by the same group on the human hepatitis B virus surface antigen (Meola et al., 1995) resulted in cross-reactive antibody production. Thus, the ability of an antibody-selected peptide mimic to elicit antibodies that will recognize a target antigen depends on a number of variables, including (i) its ability to mimic the structure of the epitope, (ii) its ability to bind specifically to the selecting antibody, and (iii) the structure and biological properties of the selecting antibody. Also, direct immunization of the selected peptide displayed by a phage could be optimized by combining T helper and B epitopes.\n\nThe genetics of the mouse could also play a role in vaccination; various studies have shown both successful vaccination in different strains of mice (Lenstra et al., 1992; Motti et al., 1994; Willis et al., 1993) and unsuccessful vaccination (Demangel et al., 1996) . In our work, successful immunization with peptides displayed on phage depended on the strain of mice used, which is consistent with the work reported by de la Cruz et al. (1988) . Moreover, Meola et al. (1995) reported no significant differences between the two strains of mice used, although C57BL mice tended to respond better, as we have also shown.\n\nTo our knowledge, this study shows for the first time an evaluation of a protective immune response produced by direct immunization with a phage-displayed peptide that was specifically selected by a pathogen-specific mAb. Several studies have reported mAb-selected peptides that can induce antibodies that, in turn, recognize the mAb's cognate antigen; these experimental systems, however, were not appropriate to evaluate protection (Folgori et al., 1994; Motti et al., 1994; Willis et al., 1993) . Recently, Bastien et al. (1997) reported the induction of a protective immune response by immunizing BALB/c mice with a recombinant phage expressing a protective epitope of human respiratory syncytial virus that had been previously identified with synthetic peptides. Also, other authors have reported the induction of protection by immunization with synthetic peptides that are homologous to the peptides borne by the selected phage (Chargelegue et al., 1998; Steward et al., 1995; Stoute et al., 1995) . Our study represents an example of the successful use of phage-displayed peptide libraries for epitope characterization and emphasizes for the first time the possibility of a direct evaluation of protective immune responses induced by the selected peptide displayed by a phage carrier.\n\nFour-to five-week-old MHV-seronegative BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River (St-Constant, Qu\u00e9 bec).\n\nThe A59 strain of MHV was initially obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD), plaque-purified twice, and passaged four times at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 on DBT astrocytoma cells (Kumanishi, 1967) as described previously (Daniel and Talbot, 1987) . The DBT cells were a gift from Dr. Michael J. Buchmeier (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). N-11 immortalized mouse microglial cells (Lutz et al., 1994) were provided by Drs. Yves Lombard and Jacques Borg (Universit\u00e9 Louis Pasteur de Strasbourg, Illkirch). Persistently infected N-11 cells were obtained by infecting the cells with MHV-A59 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.9. After a 60-min incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% (v/v) CO 2 , the cells were washed twice with 10 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, then 10 ml of RPMI medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS was added. The infected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% (v/v) CO 2 for 2 days before being passaged. Cells were tested for production of infectious virus at each passage by plaque assay as described previously (Daniel and Talbot, 1987) . Virus production levels varied between 3 \u03eb 10 4 and 2 \u03eb 10 7 PFU/ml.\n\nWe have previously reported the production and characterization of a mouse hybridoma secreting the neutralizing mAb 7-10A, which is specific for a discontinuous epitope on the S glycoprotein of MHV-A59 (Daniel and Talbot, 1990) . The mAbs 5B170 and 5B19, which are specific for continuous epitopes on the S glycoprotein (Collins et al., 1982; Daniel et al., 1993; Luytjes et al., 1989) of MHV-JHM (conserved in MHV-A59), were a kind gift from Dr. Michael J. Buchmeier (The Scripps Research Institute). A mAb against murine ICAM-1 (YN1/1.7.4, CRL 1818; ATCC) was used in some tests: it was a kind gift from Dr. Yves St-Pierre (INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier). An isotype control mAb for ELISA was specific for antic-myc (CRL 1729; ATCC). All these antibodies were purified by standard protein A-Sepharose chromatography (Manil et al., 1986) .\n\nIsolation of total cellular RNA from hybridoma cells, RT-PCR, and nucleotide sequencing were performed as described previously (Lamarre et al., 1997) . Briefly, total cellular RNA from 5B19 and 5B170 hybridomas was isolated by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation, and 2.5 g of total RNA was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Pharmacia Canada, Inc., Baie-d'Urf\u00e9 , Qu\u00e9 bec) using the MOCG12FOR primer (Lamarre et al., 1997) . Then, PCR amplification of the V H cDNA was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (BIO/CAN Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario) with the VH1FOR and VH1BACK primers (Lamarre et al., 1997) . The PCR products were then cloned into the pCRII TA cloning vector (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleotide sequencing was performed on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method, using T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia) and [\u2423-35 S]dATP (ICN Pharmaceuticals Canada Ltd., Montr\u00e9 al, Qu\u00e9 bec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed with GeneWorks 2.5.1 software (Oxford Molecular, Oxford), BLAST analysis (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/), and DNAPLOT analysis (http://www.genetik.uni-koeln.de/dnaplot).\n\nThe 12 phage-displayed peptide libraries used in this study were X 6 , X 15 , X 8 CX 8 , X 15 CX, XCX 15 , XCX 4 CX (LX4), XCX 6 CX (LX6), XCX 10 CX (LX10), X 5 CX 3 CX 5 (Cys3), X 5 CX 4 CX 5 (Cys4), X 5 CX 5 CX 4 (Cys5), and X 4 CX 6 CX 4 (Cys6), where X represents a randomized amino acid and C represents a fixed cysteine residue. The Cys3-6 libraries were kindly provided by Dr. G. P. Smith (University of Missouri at Columbia); the remaining libraries were constructed as described (Bonnycastle et al., 1996) . Peptides are expressed at the N-terminus of the major coat protein (pVIII) of the phage vector f88.4 (Zhong et al., 1994) .\n\nScreening of the peptide libraries with antibodies is described in detail elsewhere (Bonnycastle et al., 1996) . Briefly, microtiter wells were coated with streptavidin and then biotinylated mAb. Phage libraries (10 11 particles/ library) were added to each of 11 wells, with f88.4 phage being used in a 12th well as control. Phage were allowed to bind for 4 h at 4\u00b0C, then the plates were washed using an automated plate washer. Bound phage were eluted in acid, and the eluates were neutralized and used to infect K91 Escherichia coli cells. The cells were grown in microtiter wells in LB medium containing tetracycline. The phage produced were used in subsequent rounds of panning, or infected clones were chosen at random from selected phage pools, and used for ELISA and DNA sequencing.\n\nNucleic acid sequencing protocols are described in detail elsewhere (Bonnycastle et al., 1996; Smith and Scott, 1993) . Briefly, the DNA from \u03f310 11 PEG-purified virions was released by treatment in 180 mM NaOH containing sequencing primer. The solutions were neutralized, and dideoxynucleotide sequencing was performed using Sequenase and 5\u0408[\u2423-35 S]dATP. Labeled reactions were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions.\n\nNinety-six-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (ICN) were coated with 1 g/well of caprylic acid-purified, rabbit anti-phage antibody (Bonnycastle et al., 1996) or with MHV-A59-infected DBT cell lysate (60 ng/well in PBS, pH 7.4) and incubated for 16 h at room temperature. The plates were blocked with TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) containing 2% (w/v) BSA for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and then washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T). Approximately 10 10 phage particles, purified by precipitation with PEG and NaCl (Bonnycastle et al., 1996) , were added in 50-l aliquots to wells containing immobilized anti-phage antibody and incubated for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. The plates were then washed six times with TBS-T. Fifty microliters of 15 mM DTT (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added to some wells and incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. These wells were then washed once with 75 l of 50 M DTT. One hundred microliters of 60 nM mAb in TBS-T containing 50 M DTT was then added and incubated for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. For non-DTT-treated wells, TBS-T was used instead. Plates were washed six times with TBS-T, then 100 l peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse Fc antibody (ICN) diluted 1/2000 in TBS-T was added and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. The plates were washed six times with TBS-T, and specific mAb binding was revealed by the addition of 100 l of 2.2 mM O-phenylenediamine and 3 mM hydrogen peroxide. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 l of 1 N HCl, and the absorbance was read at 492 nm using an SLT EAR 400 AT plate reader (SLT-Labinstruments, Austria).\n\nNinety-six-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (ICN) were coated with 0.1 g/well of purified 5B170 and 5B19 mAb, as well as an irrelevant anti-c-myc mAb used as an isotypic control. The plates were incubated for 16 h at room temperature. Then, the plates were blocked with 150 l of ELISA blocking solution [PBS, pH 7.4, containing 10% (v/v) FCS and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20] for 2 h at room temperature. Serial, fivefold dilutions of PEG/NaCl-precipitated phage (10 mg/ml) diluted 1/10 were added to the wells and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. Wells were washed five times with PBS-T [PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20], and 100 l peroxidaselabeled anti-M13 conjugate (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Baie d'Urf\u00e9 , Qu\u00e9 bec) diluted 1/5000 in ELISA blocking solution was added. Plates were incubated for 90 min at room temperature and washed five times with PBS-T; the remaining steps were performed as described above.\n\nPhage were purified by two consecutive PEG/NaCl precipitation steps and quantitated, assuming 1 mg/ml \u03ed 1 OD 260 (Harris et al., 1997) . Groups of six BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice were immunized four times, at 14-day intervals, by ip injection of 1 mg of phage emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant [1:1 (v/v); VWR/Canlab Inc., Ville Mont-Royal, Qu\u00e9 bec] for the first injection and in incomplete Freund's adjuvant for the three subsequent booster doses. Seven days after the last injection, blood samples were drawn from the retro-orbital plexus. An intracerebral viral challenge was given 3 days later with 10 LD 50 (Lenstra et al., 1992) of MHV-A59, a dose that corresponds to 5 \u03eb 10 5 PFU for BALB/c mice and 6 \u03eb 10 4 PFU for C57BL/6 mice. This dose reproducibly yielded 100% mortality by 5 days after infection (Talbot et al., 1988; Yu et al., 1996) . The statistical significance of survival of mice was examined with Cox's proportional hazards model (Armitage and Berry, 1987) .\n\nSerial dilutions of mouse plasma were incubated in tubes with approximately 80 PFU of MHV-A59 for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. The mixtures were transferred in duplicate onto 12-well plates (ICN) containing confluent monolayers of DBT cells. After a 60-min incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% (v/v) CO 2 , the virus-antibody mixtures were removed and the cells were overlaid with 1.5% (w/v) Bacto-Agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) in Earle's minimal essential media/Hanks' M199, 1:1 (v/v) (Canadian Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Ontario), supplemented with 5% (v/v) FCS and 50 g/ml gentamicin (Canadian Life Technologies, Inc.). The plates were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% (v/v) CO 2 . The cells were then fixed with 25% (v/v) formalin and stained with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet. Plaques were counted visually and viral neutralizing titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution of plasma that neutralized 50% of viral input. A known virus-neutralizing mAb (5B170) was used as positive control.\n\nTen micrograms of the previously described immunodominant region of the S2 subunit of the MHV S glycoprotein expressed in E. coli (Daniel et al., 1993) was electrophoresed on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in SDS buffer (Laemmli, 1970) and transferred to a 0.45-m nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Life Science, Inc., Oakville, Ontario). Following transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with PBS-T for 30 min at room temperature and cut into strips. Strips were incubated for 90 min at room temperature with 1.5 ml of mouse plasma diluted 1/500 in PBS-T and then washed five times with PBS-T. The strips were then incubated for 90 min at room temperature with 1.5 ml horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (H\u03e9L) (Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) diluted 1/500 in PBS-T. The strips were washed five times with PBS-T, and specific antibody binding was revealed with 0.5 mg/ml 4-chloro-1-naphtol (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario) and 0.01% (w/v) H 2 O 2 . The reaction was stopped after 30 min by washing in deionized water.\n\nPeptide synthesis, purification, and use in ELISA Peptides corresponding to consensus sequences observed on some phage (CIGSQC and CIGSYC), as well as peptide A, with the sequence SPLLGCIGSTCAE (Daniel et al., 1994) were prepared in both linear and cyclic forms, as follows. The various peptides were synthesized with a homemade manual multireactor solidphage synthesizer according to protocols described previously Forget et al., 1990) . A benzhydrylamine resin was used as solid support. The following side chain-protected Boc-amino acids were used in the synthesis: 4-methylbenzyl cysteine, benzylglutamic acid, benzyl ether serine, and 2-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl tyrosine. Boc-amino acid couplings were performed in dimethylformamide with BOP reagent (Fournier et al., 1988) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine Le-Nguyen et al., 1987) . Every coupling was monitored with the use of the ninhydrin test. Peptide-resins were cleaved from the solid support with liquid hydrofluoric acid (10 ml/g) in the presence of m-cresol (1 ml/g) and dimethyl sulfide (1 ml/g) as scavengers. Crude peptides were purified through preparative reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the material was eluted with a linear gradient of trifluoroacetic acid/H 2 O (0.06%) and acetonitrile. The fractions corresponding to the purified peptide were pooled and lyophilized. To cyclize the peptides, they were dissolved in degassed aqueous acetic acid (80%), and a solution of iodine (50 Eq) in methanol was added dropwise. The reaction was monitored with the use of analytical HPLC and it was stopped by the addition of ascorbic acid until complete discoloration. Most of the acetic acid was evaporated and the remaining solution was diluted with water. The solution was injected onto a preparative HPLC column, and the peptide was purified as described above. Each preparation was characterized through analytical HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry. For determination of peptide-specific antibodies by ELISA, synthetic peptides were used as described previously (Daniel et al., 1994) , except that the optimal amount used was determined to be 5 g/ml.\n\nApproximately 1.5 \u03eb 10 7 N-11 cells persistently infected with MHV-A59, as described above, were labeled with 600 Ci of sodium chromate (Na 2 51 CrO 4 ; ICN Pharmaceuticals Canada Ltd.) in flat-bottomed microwells for 18 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% (v/v) CO 2 . Labeled target cells were then washed four times with Hanks' balanced sodium salts (Canadian Life Technologies) and detached by adding 0.4 mM EDTA (Anachemia, Montr\u00e9 al, Qu\u00e9 bec) for 5 min. Flat-bottomed microtiter wells were seeded with 10 4 target cells per well and the cells were allowed to bind to the plastic for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. The medium was aspirated and mouse plasma was serially diluted in RPMI medium containing 10% (v/v) FCS and added in triplicate to the target cells, in a final volume of 100 l per well. After 1-h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the antibodies were aspirated and 100 l/well of rabbit complement (Pel-Freez, Rogers, Arkansas), diluted 1/15 in RPMI medium containing 10% (v/v) FCS, was added and allowed to react for 45 min at 37\u00b0C and 5% (v/v) CO 2 . For determination of spontaneous and maximum release, medium or 5% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added to the wells, followed by 100 l/well of RPMI medium without FCS. The cells were then centrifuged at 200 g for 8 min, and 150 l of supernatant was collected from each well and counted for radioactivity in a Beckman Gamma 7000 counter [Beckman Instruments (Canada) Inc., Mississauga, Ontario]. A mAb against murine ICAM-1 was used as a positive control.\n\nResults are expressed as percentage specific release:\n\n100 \u03eb \u0351cpm experimental \u03ea cpm spontaneous\u0352 \u0351cpm maximum \u03ea cpm spontaneous\u0352 ."}
