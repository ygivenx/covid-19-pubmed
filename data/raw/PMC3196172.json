{"title": "Surgical Transplantation of Mouse Neural Stem Cells into the Spinal Cords of Mice Infected with Neurotropic Mouse Hepatitis Virus", "body": "Desired results will be identifiable by the lack of efflux of the cell suspension during the injection and by the intact appearance of the spinal cord following the procedure. To this end, it is vital to have bright and direct lighting on the mouse\u2019s spine during the laminectomy and during the injection. Optimal lighting is facilitated by fiber optic lighting (Figure 2A).\n\nFigure 1- Laminectomy. (A) Once vertebra T9 is solidly held with the Graefe forceps, (B, C) score the spine with scalpel between T10 and T11 to facilitate entry of the micro scissors. (D) Carefully slide the micro scissors through the space between T10 and T11(arrows and inset, E) and cut the pedicles on each side (dashes, E) to free the dorsal lamina. (F) Flip the lamina up rostrally and cut it off.\n\nFigure 2. Injection of NSCs. (A) The general setup of the micromanipulator with the hemostat holding the mouse attached to the left arm and the Hamilton syringe on the right arm at a 70 angle. (B) The hemostat hold the spinalis dorsi muscle connecting the spines of T8 and T9. (C) The needle is lowered through the midline and into the gray matter on the opposite hemisphere, proximal to the central canal.\n\nFigure 3. Sutures and wound closure. (A) Sutures are applied to the superficial fascia on both sides of the incision. (B) The incision is closed with 2-3 staples as needed (one staple shown on a wound needing 3).\n\nA well-executed transplant will hinge primarily on the careful laminectomy and injection of the cells. The primary pitfall to avoid during a laminectomy is the damaging of the spinal cord. This can occur during the procedure itself or by damage caused by sharp bone fragments left behind following the procedure. To avoid these, ensure that the points of the curved micro scissors are always facing away from the cord and carefully examine the laminectomized spine to ensure that all bone fragments are cleared and that the remaining vertebral structure does not have overtly protruding or jagged edges. \n\nAs previously mentioned, the detection of efflux will be possible if the light is shining brightly and directly onto the exposed spinal cord during the injection. Efflux is most likely to happen with 30 gauge needles (versus 33 gauge) and if the injection is done too rapidly. Though this protocol has given us good results, others have reported longer waiting periods (up to 5 minutes) before retracting the needle following injection 8,9. Also, smaller gauge needles are preferable, but we have observed that some cells are too easily lysed when passed through 33 gauge needles.\n\nTo maximize efficiency, a transplant team manning the four different stations (mouse prep, laminectomy, injection, and sutures) is desirable. Furthermore, the timing for each procedure should be optimized to minimize the time the cells are waiting on ice. For example, we transplant our mice in groups of four (the number of doses in each load of the syringe), the person injecting the cells starts loading the syringe after the third mouse has been laminectomized and the person preparing the mice should anesthetize the following group after the second mouse of the previous group has been laminectomized. In this manner, we can transplant cells (or control media) into 40 mice in about 3 hrs even though each mouse will take approximately 30-40 min. \n\nCell replacement therapies for the treatment of some CNS disorders are currently in clinical trials 10. There is no substitute for in vivo models of NSC transplantation and our protocol for the engraftment of NSCs into the spinal cords of mice with viral induced demyelination facilitates the use of an important model of MS and can also be easily adapted to other models. \n\nNo conflicts of interest declared."}
