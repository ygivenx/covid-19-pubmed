{"title": "Exposures among MERS Case-Patients, Saudi Arabia,\nJanuary\u2013February 2016", "body": "To the Editor: Risk factors for primary acquisition of Middle East\nrespiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV) include recent direct contact with\ndromedary camels (1), but\nsecondary transmission, associated with healthcare settings (2\u20134) or household contact (5), accounts for most reported cases. Because persons\nwith MERS often do not report any of these risk factors, we investigated MERS cases in\nSaudi Arabia during an apparent period of limited hospital transmission. Through\ntelephone interviews of case-patients and information from routine investigations, we\naimed to characterize exposures and to explore additional factors potentially important\nin disease transmission. We also genetically sequenced MERS-CoV from respiratory\nspecimens to identify circulating strains.\n\nFor confirmed MERS cases (6)\nreported in Saudi Arabia during January\u2013February 2016, we assessed exposures\nduring the 2 weeks before illness onset (exposure period), including direct (1) and indirect camel contact;\nindirect contact was defined as 1) having visited settings where camels were kept but\nwithout having direct contact or 2) exposure to friends or household members who\nthemselves had direct camel exposure (1). We assessed whether case-patients had worked at,\nvisited, or been admitted to a healthcare setting or had contact with a person known to\nhave MERS during the case-patient\u2019s exposure period. We also asked about recent\ntravel and if any household members were healthcare personnel. For persons too ill to\nparticipate or deceased, we interviewed relatives or close friends.\n\nWe classified as secondary any case identified through routine case-contact tracing and\ntesting. We considered persons whose cases were identified through routine testing of\noccupational contacts of MERS-CoV\u2013positive camels to have had direct camel\ncontact. For the remaining cases, we used interview responses to characterize\nexposures.\n\nAll MERS cases reported during January\u2013February 2016 were confirmed in Saudi\nArabia by testing of respiratory specimens with real-time reverse transcription PCR\nassays targeting the MERS-CoV upstream envelope protein gene and the open reading frame\n(ORF) 1a gene (7,8). Available specimens (or RNA\nextracts) were shipped to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta,\nGA, USA) for full genome sequencing. Methods for sequencing and phylogenetic analysis\nhave been described previously (9).\n\nDuring January\u2013February 2016, a total of 27 MERS case-patients were reported by\npublic health officials from 6 of the 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia (Technical Appendix 1). Case-patients were\nevaluated at 20 different hospitals, 3 of which reported >1 case during the\ninvestigation period. Among the 27 case-patients, 4 (15%) were identified through\nroutine contact tracing and testing as having secondary cases. Two case-patients (7%)\nwere identified as occupational contacts of MERS-CoV\u2013positive camels. Of the\nremaining 21 case-patients, 17 (81%) were interviewed during March 13\u201316, 2016;\nthree were unavailable for interview, and 1 provided incomplete data. Ten (59%) of the\n17 interviews were completed by proxy.\n\nAmong the 17 case-patients interviewed, 5 (29%) reported direct camel contact (1 of these\nalso reported visiting a healthcare facility), and 4 (24%) reported indirect camel\ncontact (2 of these also reported visiting a healthcare facility) during the exposure\nperiod (Technical Appendix 1). Three\ncase-patients reported having close acquaintances who regularly interacted with camels\nbut reported they had not seen these acquaintances during the exposure period. One\ncase-patient was the spouse of a healthcare worker employed in a facility with a\nreported MERS patient during the putative exposure period; the spouse was found to be\nMERS-CoV\u2013negative by real-time reverse transcription PCR of a respiratory\nspecimen. The 4 remaining cases could not be further characterized.\n\nViruses from 13 of the 27 case-patients were sequenced, and all belonged to the MERS-CoV\nrecombinant subclade NRC-2015 (9), first detected in humans in January 2015; these 13\ncase-patients were from the Riyadh and Makkah regions (Technical Appendix 1). Full genome sequences were obtained from the\nspecimens of 11 case-patients (Technical Appendix\n2. Continued and predominant circulation of NRC-2015 supports increased\nepidemiologic fitness compared with other clades, as postulated previously (9).\n\nA novel nucleotide substitution was identified in the MERS-CoV sequence from 1\ncase-patient (Technical Appendix 1) at\nposition 337 located in the stop codon of ORF8b (TAA [Stop] >CAA\n[Gln] = Stop113Q), predicted to yield a 143aa protein versus the 112aa\nwild-type. ORF8b is an internal ORF overlapped by the nucleocapsid protein gene (10); the corresponding\nsubstitution in the nucleocapsid protein gene predicts a conserved amino acid change\n(V178A). The virologic and clinical significance of these findings is unknown.\n\nSince the emergence of MERS-CoV in 2012, virus acquisition has been associated with\ndirect exposure to camels (1) and\nwith person-to-person transmission in households and healthcare settings (2\u20135); other sources of infection are less clear.\nAmong the patients in our study whose cases were successfully characterized (23/27), 4\nhad contact with other known case-patients, and 7 reported direct camel contact. Among\nthe remaining 12 case-patients without these risk factors, 7 were identified as having\nat least some exposure to persons with direct camel contact. Our findings suggest that\ncommunity and household exposure to persons with direct camel contact might play a role\nin MERS-CoV acquisition. Further investigation is needed to determine any specific roles\nof these interactions in MERS-CoV transmission."}
