{"title": "Nonproliferative and Proliferative Lesions of the Ratand Mouse Special Sense\nOrgans(Ocular [eye and glands], Olfactory and Otic)", "body": "The INHAND Project (International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria for\nLesions in Rats and Mice, www.toxpath.org/inhand.asp) is a joint\ninitiative between the Societies of Toxicologic Pathology from Europe (ESTP), Great Britain\n(BSTP), Japan (JSTP) and North America (STP) to develop an internationally accepted\nnomenclature for nonproliferative and proliferative lesions in laboratory animals. The\npurpose of this publication is to provide a standardized nomenclature for classifying\nproliferative and nonproliferative lesions observed in the special sense organs (ocular,\notic, and olfactory) of laboratory rodents. The standardized nomenclature presented in this\ndocument is also available electronically at the goRENI website (www.goreni.org).\n\nThis document covers the ocular, olfactory, and otic systems. The ocular system is\nsubdivided into the eye, and the glands of the eye. The diagnostic criteria used for terms\nin this publication are generally those that can be seen with standard hematoxylin and\neosin-stained (H&E) paraffin sections. Preferred terms for nonproliferative and\nproliferative lesions are presented for each tissue. Spontaneous and aging lesions, as\nappropriate, as well as lesions induced by exposure to test materials, are included.\nAlthough some diagnoses have synonyms provided, these terms may not be appropriate as\nhistologic diagnoses in toxicity studies (i.e., coloboma and synechia). The nomenclature\nrecommended here is generally descriptive rather than diagnostic.\n\nThe eye and optic nerve are included on the core list of tissues recommended by the\nSociety of Toxicologic Pathology for histologic examination in nonclinical repeat-dose\ntoxicity and carcinogenicity studies.\n\nThe perfect eye section for a routine rodent toxicity study is a superior-inferior\nsagittal section, passing through the optic nerve head, with proper orientation and free\nof artifacts. Cornea should be free of clefts or folds, and corneal endothelial cells\nshould not be vacuolated. Shattering or vacuolation of the lens should be avoided, and the\nlens should be correctly oriented in the globe, with the epithelium facing the cornea.\nArtifactual retinal separation or vacuolation is a common problem, and evaluation of\nphotoreceptors demands sections no greater than 5 \u00b5m in thickness. Specialized ocular\nstudies may require a different sectioning protocol, depending on the route of\nadministration (systemic, topical intravitreal, sub-Tenon), the nature of the test article\n(aqueous solution, viscous depot, slow-release capsule, stem cells, subretinal device), or\nas a result of unusual ophthalmoscopic findings. Pathologists should be involved in\ndetermining the best protocol for a particular study.\n\nThe genesis of a good ocular section begins at necropsy. Rough handling of the eye at\nenucleation can induce retinal separation and optic nerve artifacts. The optic nerve\nshould be transected at the level of the orbit to maximize the available nerve tissue.\nExtraocular tissues, including glands, should be trimmed off the globe prior to fixation\nto optimize the fixation of the retina and avoid separation; this also allows better\nvisualization of the landmarks for subsequent trimming. Incision of the globe prior to\nfixation will compromise the architecture of the retina due to the reduced pressure inside\nthe globe. Similarly, injection of fixative into the globe is not recommended, and is not\nnecessary for rodent eyes. If orientation is critical, consider using tissue marking fluid\nor a suture to identify landmarks or the 12 o\u2019clock position at time of collection, as\nlandmarks are more difficult to see in a fixed globe. Left and right eyes should be\nclearly differentiated to allow correlation with clinical findings.\n\nA variety of fixatives may be used. Perfusion fixation frequently results in artifactual\nspaces in the retina, and immersion fixation is probably a better option for rodent eyes.\nEnsure that the eye is immersed in a sufficiently large volume of fixative (at least 10x\nthe volume of the eye) as rapidly as possible to prevent autolytic change in the retina.\nSubmersion in 10% formalin is frequently used in toxicology studies, but retinal\npreservation is often compromised.\n\nDavidson\u2019s solution gives better retinal fixation than 10% formalin, but prolonged\nexposure will result in artifacts associated with hardening of the lens, and clefting and\npseudoedematous changes in the cornea. Rodent eyes should remain in Davidson\u2019s solution\nfor 24 hours (no more than 48 hours). For best results, eyes should be transferred\ndirectly to ethanol on the tissue processor; consider washing and transferring to ethanol\nif a short delay (up to 10 days) is anticipated, but longer term archival of eyes warrants\ntransfer to 10% formalin. Davidson\u2019s fixation is associated with artifactual vacuolation\nin the optic nerve due to the ethanol content, and thus a small section should be\ncollected for fixation in 10% formalin for cross-section examination. Davidson\u2019s fixation\nis compatible with immunohistochemistry techniques for many antigens, and morphology is\nsuperior to that obtained with formalin fixation, but it is not suitable for electron\nmicroscopy evaluation.\n\nFixation with solutions containing glutaraldehyde (e.g. Karnovsky\u2019s solution) is suitable\nif electron microscopy is planned (Ramos et\nal. 2011). To improve results, submerge the globe in the fixative for 2 hours to\nallow initial firming of the globe and then cut a small window in one side of the globe\nbefore continuing submersion for another 2 days. This fixative tends to cause distortion\nof the globe due to osmolality effects, but generally gives good corneal, lens and retinal\nmorphology. Possible artifacts include fissuring of the lens, clefting of the cornea, and\nvacuolation of photoreceptors.\n\nTrimming of globes requires a very sharp blade, and should be performed with a single\ncut; a sawing action will result in retinal separation. Mouse eyes, or juvenile rat eyes,\nare best processed intact, but it is helpful to mark the globe with indelible tissue dye\nto allow orientation at embedding. Adult rat eyes may be oriented by making an off-center\nlongitudinal cut, perpendicular to the long posterior ciliary artery, to remove a small\n(1\u20132 mm) calotte from one side of the globe, and then placing the eye, cut surface down,\nin the cassette.\n\nIf a calotte was removed prior to processing, it may be necessary to create a small\nwindow in the other side of the globe when embedding to prevent the entrapment of air\nbubbles. Care should also be taken to ensure that the lens is pushed firmly to the base of\nthe cassette at embedding. Better results may be achieved by using a low-melting point\nparaffin with added polymers.\n\nSectioning artifacts may be associated with excessive time on the water bath, or with a\nwater bath that is too hot. Adhesion may be improved by using slides that have a positive\ncharge, slides coated with poly-L-lysine, or by adding gelatin to the water bath. Lenses\nmay need to be softened by applying gauze soaked in acetic acid or liquid phenol to the\nsurface of the block for some minutes prior to sectioning.\n\nThe eyelids consist of skeletal muscle and connective tissue stroma (tarsal plate)\ncovered by haired skin on the external surface and conjunctiva on the bulbar surface. On\nthe eyelid margin are specialized hairs (eyelashes) and associated sebaceous glands\n(glands of Zeis). Additionally, Meibomian glands, specialized sebaceous glands that\ncontribute lipid components to the tear film, have secretion pores along the inner\nmargin of the eyelid. The comparative histology of the Meibomian gland has been\ndescribed in detail (Jester et al.\n1981). The third eyelid is located in the nasal aspect of the palpebral fissure\nand consists of fibrous stroma supported by hyaline cartilage covered by conjunctiva\n(Yoshitomi and Boorman\n1990). The palpebral conjunctiva covers the eyelids and the bulbar conjunctiva\ncovers the sclera of the eye. The conjunctiva consists of a simple cuboidal epithelium\nwith goblet cells overlying vascularized connective tissue stroma. Evaluation of the\neyelid and conjunctiva macroscopically and microscopically are important components of\nocular irritation/toxicity studies for topical agents.\n\nThe tough fibrous tunic of the eye is composed of a posterior, opaque sclera and an\nanterior, transparent cornea. The cornea provides structural integrity for the\nanterior portion of the eye, serves as a primary light transmission and refractive\nmedium, and acts as a barrier to infection. The cornea is spherical, and in most\nanimal species, the vertical dimension is shorter than the horizontal. Transparency is\nattributable to salient features that include avascularity, lack of epithelial\npigmentation, molecular arrangement of the stroma, and the presence of crystalline\nproteins in the epithelium and stromal keratocytes with properties that reduce light\nscatter.\n\nThe circumferential boundary between the cornea and sclera is known as the limbus.\nThe limbus contains populations of fibroblasts, monocytes and Langerhans cells, and a\nreservoir of stem cells that replenish the corneal epithelium during cell turnover, or\nfollowing injury. The stroma of the limbus is loose and contains a highly vascularized\nepiscleral arterial circle that originates from the superficial branch of the anterior\nciliary artery (Ramos, Attar et al.\n2017). The metabolic needs of the peripheral cornea are met by arterioles\nfrom this source, which form an arcade, and by diffusion of nutrients from the aqueous\nhumor. Capillaries may extend as far anteriorly as Bowman\u2019s membrane (see below)\nbefore looping back, or less commonly, terminate abruptly within the peripheral\nstroma. The avascularity of the cornea is maintained through the activity of cytokines\nthat inhibit angiogenesis such as endostatin and thrombospondins 1 and 2, VEGFR 1 and\n3 inhibitors, and tissue inhibitors of metaloproteinases, which have been identified\nin the cornea and are believed to prevent the encroachment of vessels beyond the\nlimbus (Cursiefen et al.\n2006).\n\nAs with most other species, the rodent cornea is composed of 5 layers (anterior to\nposterior): non-keratinized squamous epithelium, epithelial basement membrane, corneal\nstroma, Descemet\u2019s membrane, and endothelium. The rodent cornea is thicker in the\ncentral portion, and thinner in the periphery (Henriksson et al. 2009). Conflicting data\nregarding corneal measurements reported in the literature has resulted from use of\ndiffering techniques (in-vivo versus histological methods) and the\nrodent strain used to capture the data. Measurement of central cornea thickness (CCT)\nusing optical low coherence reflectometer of the mouse (Balb/c) and rat (Wistar) were\napproximately 106 and 159 \u00b5m, respectively (Schulz et al. 2003). However, by histology, CCT for\nthe mouse has been reported to range from ~122\u2013160 \u00b5m (Henriksson et al. 2009; Rodriguez-Ramos Fernandez and\nDubielzig 2013), and ~250 \u00b5m for the hooded rat (Massof and Chang 1972).\n\nThe corneal epithelium functions to prevent fluid loss and provide protection. In\nrodents, the corneal epithelium makes up approximately 30% (in contrast to other\nspecies, including humans, where the epithelium is approximately 10%) of the total\ncorneal thickness (Henriksson et\nal. 2009). The epithelium is arranged in three distinct layers: superficial\nlayer of flattened non-keratinized squamous cells; middle layer of polyhedral wing\ncells; and basal cells. The epithelium of the rodent cornea undergoes post-natal\ndevelopment and cell differentiation, with 1-2 cell layers present at birth, to 4-5\ncell layers at eyelid opening, to 6-7 layers in the adult (Chung et al. 1992), although some sources put the\nupper limits at the central cornea closer to thirteen layers (Henriksson et al. 2009). Epithelial cells appear\nto derive from the basal cells of the entire cornea during early development (Chung et al. 1992; Zieske 2004). Following maturation stem\ncells are localized to the limbus similar to other species and are the source of\nepithelial cell replenishment during cell turnover, which is continuous, or\nrecruitment following corneal injury. The integrity and function of the cornea are\ndependent on the division of epithelial stem cells, and the amplification and\ncentripetal migration of the daughter cells into the cornea to populate the basal\nepithelium (Secker and Daniels\n2009). As the cells differentiate they move horizontally towards the surface,\nbecoming first, polyhedral suprabasal wing cells, and second, flat squamous cells at\nthe surface, where they eventually (induced by blinking) desquamate into the tear\nfilm. The superficial squamous cells have microvilli that function to increase the\ncell surface and promote tear adherence (Secker and Daniels 2009).\n\nThe basal cells are anchored to a thin basal lamina, or basement membrane, by\nhemidesmosomes (Smith, Sundberg, and\nJohn 2002a; Smith, Sundberg,\nand John 2002b). Bowman\u2019s layer, an acellular, tightly interwoven meshwork of\ncollagen fibers located subjacent to the basal lamina, does occur in rodents, but is\nrudimentary, and although discernable with electron microscopy, is not so using light\nmicroscopy. An amorphous membrane containing fine nerve plexi immediately adjacent to\nthe basal epithelium has been reported using confocal microscopy (Kowalczuk et al. 2013).\nUnmyelinated nerve fibers occur throughout the cornea stoma of the rat (Henriksson et al. 2009).\n\nTransparency of the cornea is primarily dependent on the arrangement of the stroma,\nan extracellular matrix of collagen fibrils (predominantly types I and V). The stromal\nmatrix contains sulfated glycosaminoglycans that have a primary role in defining the\nhydrophilicity properties of the cornea as well as maintaining the spatial\norganization of the collagen fibrils - these are arranged into orthogonal lamellae\nwhich have the effect of minimizing light scatter and creating transparency (Quantock and Young 2008). The\nsource of the stromal extracellular matrix (ECM) is derived from the keratocytes\nresiding between the fibrils; these are modified fibroblasts with numerous\ninterconnecting lamellapodia arranged parallel to the collagen bundles in a manner\nthat similarly facilitates light transmission (Hassell and Birk 2010). Keratocytes contain\ncrystalline proteins that have properties that also reduce light scattering (Quantock and Young 2008).\nDuring embryonic development, ECM is produced at a higher rate in the central portion\nof the corneal stroma relative to the periphery, contributing to the curvature of the\ncornea. The curvature is maintained by an annulus of collagen fibers that\ncircumferentially align the limbus. The refracting power of the cornea is dependent on\nthe curvature of the radius of the exterior surface, which is shaped to focus an image\non the visual axis.\n\nThe posterior aspect of the stroma is bordered by Descemet\u2019s membrane, a specialized\nbasal lamina that is secreted by the corneal endothelium. Descemet\u2019s membrane is\ncomprised of a highly ordered hexagonal array of collagen (type IV, VIII, XVIII),\nlaminin, and fibronectin (Smith,\nSundberg, and John 2002a; Jun et\nal. 2006). The anterior side adjacent to the stroma is present at birth;\nhowever, the endothelial cells continue to secrete the lamina throughout life such\nthat the membrane becomes thicker with age. Descemet\u2019s membrane gradually terminates\njust anterior to the trabecular meshwork, although in some mice strains there is a\nfocal thickening that is suggestive of Schwalbe\u2019s line (Smith, Sundberg, and John 2002a; Smith, Sundberg, and John 2002b).\nThe endothelial cells (posterior epithelium) form a monolayer layer of cells that line\nthe posterior aspect of the cornea. Cornea endothelial cells have incomplete tight\njunctions between cells that are permissive for movement of nutrients and other\nmolecules from the aqueous humor into the avascular stroma. Optical clarity is\nachieved through active transport of fluid and ions out of the cornea to maintain a\nrelatively dehydrated state (stromal deturgescence) through pumps and pinocytotic\nvesicles, and collectively, the system is referred to as a pump-leak mechanism (Bourne 2003). Proliferation of the cornea\nendothelial cells continues until the time of eyelid opening, whereupon they become\nquiescent (Zieske 2004). In the rat and\nrabbit, it has been demonstrated that there is a reserve of endothelial cells in the\nperipheral cornea/limbus that are capable of replenishing the cornea endothelium\npost-injury (Bredow et al. 2014;\nChoi et al. 2015).\n\nThe highly vascularized ocular tissues are collectively referred to as the uvea. The\nposterior uvea consists of the choroid, and the anterior uvea, the iris and ciliary\nbody. The choroid and ciliary body attach to the internal surface of the sclera, while\nthe iris arises from the anterior portion of the ciliary body. The iris extends\ncentrally to form a circumferential diaphragm in front of the lens and modulates light\npenetrance by contraction of myoepithelial cells (sympathetic innervation) and smooth\nmuscle fibers (parasympathetic innervation) that permit dilation, and constriction,\nrespectively. Anterior ocular immune deviation (\u201cprivilege\u201d) is established though the\nblood-ocular barrier (BOB), which consists of the blood-aqueous barrier and\nblood-retinal barrier. The blood-aqueous barrier consists of tight junctions between\nnonpigmented epithelium in the ciliary processes, the endothelial cells of the iris\nvasculature, and the inner wall endothelium of the angular aqueous plexus in\nnon-primate mammals (akin to Schlemm\u2019s canal in primates) (Coca-Prados 2014). The blood-retinal barrier is\ncomposed of non-fenestrated capillaries of the retinal circulation (inner\nblood-retinal barrier) and tight-junctions between retinal (pigmented) epithelial\ncells (outer blood-retinal barrier) preventing passage of large molecules from the\nchoriocapillaris into the retina.\n\nThe iris originates from the anterior portion of the ciliary body. It separates the\nanterior from the posterior ocular chamber, allowing for communication via the pupil.\nThe iris is divided into the anterior border layer, the stroma and sphincter inner\nlayer, and the posterior pigmented epithelial layers which are continuous with the\nepithelium of the ciliary body (Ramos,\nAttar et al. 2017; Samuelson\n2007). The anterior border is formed by a discontinuous band of fibroblasts\nand melanocytes. The stroma is loosely arranged and composed of collagen fibrils,\nfibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and a network of nerve fibers and blood vessels. The\nsmooth muscles of the iris control pupil diameter. The sphincter muscle is composed of\nbundles of smooth muscle that encircle the pupil and is under parasympathetic\ninnervation associated with constriction of the pupil. The dilator muscle is composed\nof myoepithelial cells that extend radially from the iris sphincter muscle to the iris\nperiphery in the posterior iris stroma in a spoke-like arrangement; it is under\nsympathetic innervation associated with pupil dilation. Pupil size and shape vary\nbetween species and state of contraction. The pupil is generally round in the rodent.\nThe major arterial circle of the iris is furnished by anastomoses of the anterior\nciliary arteries and the long posterior arteries (Riordan-Eva 2011). Stromal blood vessels are\nrelatively thick, and allow for constant blood flow regardless of pupil constriction\nor dilation (Barskey 2006). Resident\nmacrophages and dendritic cells grant immune privilege to ocular tissues of the\nanterior segment by modulating inflammatory reactions and establishing a deviated\nimmune response (anterior chamber-associated immune deviation; ACAID), rather than\nstimulating a T-cell response that elicits delayed hypersensitivity or\ncompliment-fixing antibodies. Deviated T-cell responses, the blood-aqueous-barrier,\nand immunosuppressive factors present in the aqueous collectively promote a\nmicroenvironment that spares the visual axis by minimizing inflammation in the\nanterior chamber that would otherwise cause potential damage to delicate ocular\nstructures (Streilein 2003; Taylor 2009; Taylor and Kaplan 2010). The color of the iris\nis attributed to type and density of melanin pigment, degree of vascularization, and\nbackscatter of incident light from stromal collagen fibers. The latter accounts for\nthe bluish pink iris color of albino rodent species (Wilkerson et al. 1996). Pigmentation of the iris\nhas a protective role to the retina by limiting light transmission through the\npupil.\n\nThe ciliary body forms the middle component of the vascular layer of the eye (uvea),\nand is located between the choroid and the iris. It is composed of smooth muscle,\nstroma, blood vessels, and epithelium. The external surface consists of the inner and\nouter leaves of the ciliary muscle, creating a cleft in which the cilioscleral sinus\nresides. Ciliary processes extend from the inner surface and are covered by two layers\nof epithelium that are in apposition: an outer layer of low, cuboidal pigmented\nepithelium (non-pigmented in albino species) that is adjacent to the stroma and\ncontinuous with the RPE; and an inner layer of non-pigmented columnar epithelium that\nis continuous with the retina. The ciliary processes are the site of aqueous humor\nproduction, derived from the epithelium and vasculature of the ciliary body. Aqueous\nhumor is secreted into the posterior ocular chamber and circulates through the pupil\ninto the anterior ocular chamber. Aqueous humor exits the eye through the iridocorneal\nangle (ICA) at the anterior base of the iris.\n\nThe epithelium of the ciliary processes also secretes hyaluronic acid, the main\nconstituent of the vitreous (Teixeira and Dubielzig 2013a;Teixeira and Dubielzig 2013b). The ciliary\nbody and ciliary processes surround the coronal equator of the lens and provide a base\non which ciliary (lenticular) zonules are attached. The relative tone of smooth muscle\nwithin the ciliary body controls the visual accommodation of the lens, and visual\nacuity is reflected in the relative amount of smooth muscle present in the ciliary\nbody. Thus rodents, which have scant ciliary smooth muscle, have poor visual\nacuity.\n\nThe iridocorneal angle (ICA) is formed by the base of the iris and the\ncorneal-scleral tunic and has a critical role in maintenance of intraocular pressure\n(IOP), functioning as the outflow apparatus for aqueous humor. The ICA is located at\nthe periphery of the anterior chamber (limbus), extending into the anterior ciliary\nbody to form a recess called the cilioscleral sinus (known as the Spaces of Fontana in\nprimates). Broad, pectinate ligaments (iris processes or pillars) span the sinus,\nextending from the corneoscleral junction to the root of the iris. The trabecular\nmeshwork (TM) is located within the sinus, posterior to the pectinate ligaments and is\ncomposed of crisscrossing cords or sheets of collagen and elastin that appear to be\nanterior tendinous extensions of ciliary body musculature. The TM surface is covered\nby a unique population of endothelial-like trabecular cells that are continuous with\nthe endothelium of the cornea and the downstream collecting duct (Samuelson 2007).\n\nThe TM is subdivided into three layers (in order of aqueous flow): uveoscleral, or\nuveal meshwork (USM); corneoscleral meshwork (CSM); and juxtacanalicular, or\ncribriform meshwork (JCM). The corresponding intratrabecular spaces become\nprogressively smaller, resulting in increased aqueous outflow resistance as aqueous\nflows through the TM, and out the JCM. Aqueous humor exits the JCM and flows into\ncollecting ducts (Schlemm\u2019s canal; rodents are similar to humans) (Lei et al. 2011; Morrison et al. 1995), through interscleral\nchannels, exiting the eye though episcleral and conjunctival veins. Aqueous physiology\nis similar across species, but dynamics may vary due to anatomical differences.\n\nStructural differences in the ICA, ciliary body, and processes across mammalian\nspecies are related to ocular size, and the role and limitations of visual (lens)\naccommodation. Laboratory rodents are nocturnal mammals with relatively large eyes,\nand have a small ciliary body with scant smooth muscle and thus they have limited lens\naccommodation. The inner leaf of the ciliary body (also called the base-plate) is\nfibrous, and extends from the root of the iris to the ora ciliaris retina. The outer\nleaf, composed of smooth muscle, presses against the sclera and extends from the\ncorneoscleral junction to the ora ciliaris retina. The sinus contains 1-2 rows of\nshort, fine pectinate ligaments, and 2-3 layers of trabeculae, which are aligned\nparallel to the angle of the sinus. The ciliary processes are prominent and more\nnumerous in rodents, a characteristic of animals with larger anterior chambers\ncompared to other species. The blood supply to the ciliary body is derived from the\ntwo long posterior ciliary arteries (Riordan-Eva 2011). Capillaries within the ciliary body are concentrically\norganized. In rodents, they are less developed relative to other species that have\nmore robust aqueous humor production (Ramos, Attar et al. 2017).\n\nThe choroid is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue that resides between\nthe sclera and retina. The choroid originates from the short posterior arteries (Riordan-Eva 2011). The choroid\nsupplies the metabolic needs of the retina, primarily through the choriocapillaris, an\nextensive interconnected capillary network posterior to Bruch\u2019s membrane. Bruch\u2019s\nmembrane is a five-layered structure composed of a middle layer of elastin, bounded by\na layer of collagen on either side that is juxtaposed between the basement membranes\nof the RPE and the choriocapillaris. Bruch\u2019s membrane selectively filters the passage\nof macromolecules between the retina and choriocapillaris. The capillaries have a\nfenestrated endothelium through which macromolecules leak into the extracellular space\nof the choroid. The external choroid is comprised predominantly of a venous plexus.\nMid-sized anastomosing vessels and melanocytes (pigmented macrophages) reside within a\npigmented reticular connective tissue mesh located between the venous plexus and the\nchoriocapillaris; this tissue has a role in absorption of excess radiation (Ramos, Attar et al. 2017).\n\nThe vertebrate lens is a crystalline, polarized spherical structure located in the\nposterior chamber immediately anterior to the vitreous. The lens is suspended\nposterior to the iris by the ciliary zonule, a circumferential suspensory ligament\ncomposed of an elaborate system of fibers. In the rodent, these fibers adhere to the\nlens capsule, connecting the lens to the ciliary body (Shi et al. 2013a). The lens shares a role with the\ncornea for light refraction and visual acuity. The ciliary zonule transmits forces\nresulting from contraction or relaxation of the muscles within the ciliary body that\nallow for visual accommodation depending on the distance of the object. The rodent\nlens is round (rather than biconvex as occurs in primates, dogs, and rabbits) and\noccupies approximately 75% of the ocular space (Ramos, Attar et al. 2017). The ciliary body is\nrudimentary in rodents, allowing for limited contraction and lens accommodation.\n\nThe lens is composed of two populations of cells. Lens epithelial cells form a\nmonolayer sheath on the anterior surface, and secrete an extracellular protein matrix\nforming a capsule that surrounds the cellular elements. Posterior lens fibers are\nelongated, transparent, fully differentiated cells that derive from progenitor\nepithelial cells. Cell proliferation is restricted to progenitor epithelial cells\nlocated in the germinative layer above the lens equator (nuclear bow). Under the\ninfluence of fibroblast growth factors, progeny cells migrate, or shift posterior to\nthe equator, where they differentiate into fiber cells. As the cells differentiate,\nthey undergo bi-directional elongation and produce massive quantities of crystalline\nproteins that are arranged in complex matrices along thin filaments that compose the\ncytoskeleton of the fiber cell (Zampighi et al. 2011). Crytallines have a critical role in maintaining lens\ntransparency and refractive properties. Injury to the lens may result in the formation\nof insoluble aggregates of crystallines, producing opacities (correlating to\nophthalmically observable cataracts) that obstruct light transmission and obscure\nvision. As elongation progresses, the fibers become convex, and the apical tips\nmigrate towards the anterior pole. The lens increases in size and weight as more\nfibers are successively incorporated into layers to form the lens mass. Older fibers\n(primary fibers) form the embryonic nucleus of the lens while the newer (secondary)\nfibers form the outer layers. Lens fibers subsequently undergo organelle degradation\nincluding nuclear loss (Dawes et al.\n2014; Song et al.\n2014).\n\nThe vitreous is a translucent gel-like extracellular matrix that occupies the\nposterior compartment of the eye. More than 95% of the vitreous gel weight is water,\nwhile the remaining balance is comprised of the structural components of collagen and\nproteoglycans (primarily hyaluronan, HA) (Crafoord et al. 2014). There are species and\nage-related differences in the relative composition of the structural components.\nExcept for collagen and proteoglycans, the composition of the vitreous is similar to\naqueous humor, and similarly is produced by the ciliary processes (Teixeira and Dubielzig\n2013a), although other ocular cells (hyalocytes, M\u00fcller cells, cells of the\nhyaloid vessels) have been ascribed a role (Kingston et. al., 2014). Most of the soluble\nprotein present in the vitreous is derived from plasma, and albumin and\nimmunoglobulins represent ~80% of the protein content of the vitreous (Bishop 2014). Studies utilizing fixation\nand dye injection demonstrate similarity in vitreous structure between human,\nnon-human primate, and rabbit, and likely other species (Los 2008; Worst\nand Los 1992). Therefore, a generalized presentation of the vitreous is\nprovided and pertains to all species.\n\nVitreous collagen is arranged in fibrils with a central core of types V/XI,\nsurrounded by type II (the predominant collagen present), all overlaid by type IX\n(Bishop 2014). Chondroitin sulfate\nchains of type IX collagen form bridges that interconnect adjacent fibrils to form\nsheaths, while simultaneously aid in the prevention of aggregation. Arrays of\nhydrophilic hyaluronan and other proteoglycans (chondroitin sulfate) are interspersed\nbetween the collagen fibrils, and appear to stabilize the fibril scaffold and control\nvolume of the vitreous gel (Crafoord\net al. 2014; Sebag 1989). The\ncollagen fibers of the vitreous are continuous with the footplates of the M\u00fcller\ncells, which are thought to be a primary source of vitreous collagen (Kingston et. al., 2014).The\ncollagen content is highest where the vitreous is a gel, and the relative proportion\nof gel to liquid vitreous varies among species.\n\nImportant functions for the vitreous include:\n\n\nProviding an optically clear medium through which light may pass essentially\nunaltered. The maintenance of the spatial configuration between fibrils by the\nremaining macromolecules imparts this critical function.Maintaining the shape of the vitreous chamber and posterior cavity, and overall\nshape of the ocular globe.Maintaining the normal positions of the lens and the retina.\n\n\nDifferential distribution of collagen and proteoglycans results in two basic zones\n(cortical and medullary) with variable densities within the vitreous. The cortical\nvitreous occupies the periphery of the vitreous and encases the core (medullary\nvitreous). The cortical vitreous is relatively more condensed and fibrillar compared\nto the medullary vitreous, and has the appearance of a smooth clear membrane due to\nthe lamellar distribution of collagen fibrils and associated highly polymerized\nproteoglycans (primarily chondroitin sulfate). Although the cortical vitreous\nrepresents only 2% of the total vitreous volume, it is the metabolic center of the\nvitreous body, because it contains the hyalocytes (detailed below), which make up 90%\nof the cell population in the cortical vitreous; fibrocytes and glial cells make up\nthe remaining 10%. The vitreous cortex extends anteriorly from the vitreous base to\nform the anterior vitreous cortex and posteriorly to form the posterior vitreous\ncortex. The vitreous body interfaces with a number of ocular structures through the\nvitreous cortex. The anterior vitreous cortex forms the posterior limits of the\nposterior chamber and functions in the physiologic communication between the vitreous\ncavity and the aqueous humor. The anterior surface of the vitreous body extends\nanterior and medially from the pars plana at the ora ciliaris to contact the lens\nposterior to the lens equator. Thus, the anterior vitreous cortex is in contact with\nthe ciliary processes and the lens zonules, as well as the posterior lens capsule. The\nvitreous attaches to the lens capsule in a ring-like manner, forming the ligament of\nWieger (Sebag 1992). Posterior to the\nora ciliaris, bundles of vitreous fibrils attach to the internal limiting laminae\n(ILL) (Balazs et al. 1964).\nCords of vitreous collagen insert into gaps between the neuroglia. The cortical\nvitreous is most firmly attached to the ILL in the area of the optic disc, the macula\n(in primates), and to retinal blood vessels. Retinal pathology such as\nneovascularization or vascular malformations occurs in the areas of vitreous\nattachment to the retina. Separation of the vitreous may transmit traction to these\nattachments, leading to vitreous hemorrhage or retinal tears. Persistent vitreous\ntraction on retinal tears is an important factor in the development of a retinal\ndetachment.\n\nThe bulk of the vitreous is formed by the core, or medullary vitreous. It is\nessentially a cell-free mixture of collagens and hyaluronic acid (HA) existing either\nin a gel or a liquid state depending on the age, refraction, and condition of the eye.\nThe exclusion of other cells and large particles from the vitreous is important for\nmaintaining transparency. Within the medullary vitreous, the collagen fibrils\ngenerally course in an anterior posterior direction. Anteriorly, these fibrils blend\nwith those of the basal vitreous and posteriorly they insert into the vitreous\ncortex.\n\nThe vitreous has, as a whole, been shown to be variable in its consistency at\ndifferent ages due to differences in the proportions of gel to liquid vitreous that\noccur. It is generally accepted that vitreous collagen turnover is slow and perhaps\nnonexistent, and that the vitreous body liquefies with age. Aging and liquification is\nassociated with loss of type IX collagen and chondroitin sulfate chains (Bishop 2014). However in many animals,\nincluding rodents, the vitreous remains in a predominantly gel state throughout life\n(Denlinger and Balaz\n2014). Average vitreous volumes are as follows, in decreasing order: human,\n4.5 mL; dog, 2.9 mL; cynomolgus macaque, 2.2 mL; rabbit, 1.6 mL, rat 0.03 mL (30 \u03bcL);\nmouse 0.01 mL (10 \u03bcL) (Ramos, Attar et\nal. 2017; Atsumi et al.\n2013; Remtulla and\nHallett 1985; Sha and Kwong\n2006). In the adult eye, the vitreous volume is relatively fixed and\npermanent.\n\nUnder normal physiological conditions, a small number of hyalocytes reside in the\ncortical vitreous, mainly in the posterior aspect abutting the inner surface of the\nretina (Halfter et al. 2014).\nHyalocytes are phagocytic cells that vary from oval to spindle or stellate shape,\npossess lysosomes, mitochondria, ribosomes, and micro-pinocytotic vesicles, and have\nnumerous microvilli on their surface. Current literature suggests that hyalocytes play\na crucial role in the formation and contraction of proliferative membranes (vitreous\nfibroplasia; vitreous membranes) in response to growth factors overexpressed in\ndiseased eyes such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and proliferative\nvitreoretinopathy (PVR) (Kita et al.\n2014).\n\nHyalocytes express cell surface antigens characteristic of monocyte/macrophage\nleukocyte lineage including CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), CD64 (Fc receptor I),\nCD11a (leukocyte-function antigen-1), and histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II\nantigens (Kita et al. 2014).\n\nHyalocytes also express F4/80, a marker common to tissue macrophages. Anterior\ncavity-associated immune deviation (ACAID) has been attributed to F4/80 antigen\npresenting cells residing in the iris and ciliary body (Masli and Vega 2011). Experimental evidence\nsuggests that hyalocytes have a similar role in the vitreous, conferring immune\ndeviation and modulating inflammation that occurs with delayed hypersensitivity to\nantigens (Kita et al. 2014; Sakamoto and Ishibashi\n2011). In non-inflamed eyes, this has been coined vitreous cavity-associated\nimmune deviation (VCAID). Immune privilege has been shown to be lost in mice with\ninflamed eyes, and in knockout mice deficient in natural killer T cells, a critical\ncomponent of immune deviation (Sonoda\net al. 2005).\n\nThe photoreceptors are divided into cones and rods. The nuclei of the\nphotoreceptors reside in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) with their dendrites facing\nthe RPE, forming the photoreceptor inner segment (PIS) and outer segments (POS). The\ninner segments contain large numbers of mitochondria and golgi complexes, while the\nouter segments is composed of stacked membranous discs containing the photosensitive\npigments used in the visual cycle (rhodopsin in rods, and opsins in cones). The\nouter segments are ensheathed by the RPE apical processes, which facilitates\nphagocytosis by RPE as discs are shed continuously.\n\nAlthough rods predominate in all species, the respective numbers of cones and rods\nand the spatial arrangement within the retina have considerable species\nvariation.\n\nMost animals have a region in the retina with a higher concentration of cones for\nincreased visual acuity that is often, but not always, located at the temporal\nhorizontal retinal. The region of cone concentration is usually referred to as the\narea centralis or visual streak, depending on its shape. In\nhuman, non-human primates and in some birds, the cone- enriched area is near the\ncenter of the retina and called the macula from its pigmented appearance. At its\ncenter is the fovea, a cone-dominated avascular region of maximal visual acuity. The\nrodent does not have a specialized region for visual acuity and has a much lower\nproportion of cones in its retina (Zeiss\n2010). Diurnal rodents have a relatively high concentration of cones\n(30\u201340%), but cones are sparse in nocturnal rodents (Bobu et al. 2008; Sa\u00efdi et al. 2011). Rodents may have blue,\nblue/green, or green/red hybrid cones with some variable regional distribution in\ndifferent species (Peichl 2005). Some\nmice have a preponderance of blue cones in the ventral retina, but no specialized\nareas such as a macula, fovea, area centralis, or visual streak is present.\n\nThe external limiting membrane is a dense junctional zone between M\u00fcller cells and\nphotoreceptors. M\u00fcller cells are the primary support glial cell of the retina with\nprocesses that extend between the external and internal limiting membranes.\n\nThe perikaryon and nucleus of the photoreceptor cell reside in the outer nuclear\nlayer. The nuclei of rod cells are distributed throughout the layer, while nuclei of\nthe cones form a row immediately inner to the external limiting membrane. Axons\nradiate inward to form synapses in the outer plexiform layer with the dendrites of\nsecond order neurons.\n\nThe outer plexiform layer contains the synapses between the axon terminals of the\nphotoreceptor cells and bipolar cell dendrites, which may have synaptic\nrelationships with multiple receptors. Bipolar cells transfer visual signals to\nganglion cells through synapses formed in the inner plexiform layer, while\nhorizontal cells form connections between groups of rods and cones through lateral\nsynapses.\n\nThe nuclei of second order neurons (bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine\ncells, and interplexiform cells) and M\u00fcller cells (retinal glial cells) reside in\nthe inner nuclear layer (W\u00e4ssle\nand Boycott 1991; Masland\n2001; Boycott and\nW\u00e4ssle 1999). Bipolar cells have two processes that separately extend\ninward and outward connecting to ganglion cells and photoreceptors. Bipolar cells\nreceive synaptic input from either rods (rod bipolars) or cones (cone bipolars) and\ntransmit signals to ganglion cells. Horizontal cells are less frequent and often lie\nin the outer part of INL. These GABAergic inhibitory interneurons help integrate and\nregulate the input from multiple photoreceptor cells, optimizing vision under both\nbright and dim light conditions. Amacrine cells are numerous and often lie in the\ninner aspect of the INL. These are also inhibitory interneurons that interact with\nbipolar cells and ganglion cells to regulate neuronal impulses allowing one area of\nthe retina to influence the activity of another. M\u00fcller cells are specialized glial\ncells that provide structural and functional support to the retina. These cells also\nmaintain the stability of the retinal extracellular environment through the uptake\nof neurotransmitters, removal of cellular debris, and storage of glycogen for\nenergy. Their nuclei are located in the INL and their long processes stretch\nradially across the thickness of the retina contacting the outer and inner limiting\nmembranes. M\u00fcller cells have a close spatial relationship to pericytes of the\nretinal blood vessels and contribute to the maintenance of the blood-retinal\nbarrier. Cells in the INL can be quantified and identified by special stains (Jeon et al. 1998).\n\nSynapses between bipolar cell, amacrine, and interplexiform cells integrate and\nrefine the signals from the photoreceptors in the inner plexiform layer (Protti et al. 2005). Axons from\nthese cells in turn synapse with dendrites from the ganglion cells.\n\nGanglion cell nuclei and perikarya reside near the inner surface of the retina\nforming the ganglion cell layer. Ganglion cells are third order neurons that receive\nintegrated visual signal from second order neurons. Axons from the ganglion cells\nform the optic nerve. Astrocytes and displaced amacrine cells may also be present in\nthe ganglion cell layer.\n\nAxons from the ganglion cells reside in the nerve fiber layer at the inner surface\nof the retina to converge at the optic disk, collectively exiting the eye as the\noptic nerve. The vision impulse traverses the optic nerve to reach the brain. Fibers\nare interspersed with astrocytes and other retinal glial cells.\n\nThe internal limiting membrane is a basement membrane secreted by the terminal\nfootplates of the M\u00fcller cells. It separates the bases of the M\u00fcller cells (and\nretina) from the adherent vitreous body.\n\nThe thickness of the sensory retina decreases towards the periphery. Examples of\nthe thickness of the various layers in the central retina of a rat are as follows:\n28-30 \u00b5m (POS), 14-15 \u00b5m (PIS), 52 \u00b5m (ONL), 12 \u00b5m (OPL) and 28-29 \u00b5m (INL) (Hebel and Stromberg\n1976).\n\nThe optic nerve (cranial nerve II) begins at the optic disc (optic papilla, optic\nnerve head) and courses from the posterior aspect of the globe to the brain. The optic\nnerve is composed primarily of the axons from ganglion cells (GC), which extend from\nthe inner retina, traversing posteriorly and centripetally within the inner nerve\nfiber layer to converge into bundles at the optic disc forming the nerve. The central\narea of the optic disc is depressed (meniscus of Kuhnt), and is supported by a\nthickening of the retinal inner limiting membrane. Ganglion cell axons and axon\nbundles are surrounded by astrocytes at the surface of the optic disc. As the nerve\npasses through the scleral canal it crosses an open meshwork of collagenous beams or\nplates continuous with the sclera (termed the lamina cribrosa). This connective tissue\nmeshwork also contains elastin and lends support for the nerve tissue. The lamina\ncribosa is composed of sparse connective tissue in both rats and mice, and is less\ndistinct compared to other laboratory species (Greaves 2000; Rubin\n1974). In most species including rodents, the axons are myelinated distal to\nthe lamina cribrosa, so that on funduscopy, the optic disc is poorly demarcated from\nthe surrounding tissue, and thus does not have a white appearance. In pigmented rats\nthe optic disc may appear gray. Myelination is provided by the cell processes of\noligodendroglia, which form sheaths around the ganglion cell axons. Myelin in the\noptic nerve stains positive with Luxol fast blue stain (LFB).\n\nThe bulbar portion of the optic nerve (orbital optic nerve) crosses the space between\nthe globe and the optic foramen (retrobulbar optic nerve), continuing to the optic\ncanal to become the intracranial optic nerve between the optic foramen and the optic\nchiasm. The optic nerve between the globe and the optic chiasm of the rat is long\n(11.7-12.3 mm) with most (three-quarters) of the length contained within the\nintraorbital space (Hebel and\nStromberg 1976). The optic nerve is an extension of the brain and is\nsurrounded by dura, arachnoid, and pia maters, the later of which intimately surrounds\nand sends septae into the nerve. The optic nerve normally contains a small population\nof microglia, the phagocytes of the nervous system. The blood source of the optic\nnerve is derived from the internal ophthalmic artery, which lies inferior to the optic\nnerve. In rodents, the ophthalmic artery trifurcates posterior to the globe into the\ncentral retinal artery, and nasal and temporal posterior ciliary arteries, which\nsupply the optic disc in addition to the retina and anterior uvea (Morrison et al. 1999). Four to\neight arterioles and venules, equidistant from each other, extend and branch\ndichotomously from the center of the disc (Rubin 1974).\n\nThere are two vascular systems that supply the rodent retina, similar to human and\nmany other species. The rodent retinal vasculature has a holangiotic pattern (fully\nvascularized). The ophthalmic artery enters the eye through the optic nerve and\ndivides into several branches that service the entire retina. Retinal vessels form a\nmultilayered network between the OPL and IPL to nourish the cells of the inner layers\nof the retina. The choroid blood system posterior to the retina supplies the outer\nretina (particularly the photoreceptors) through diffusion. Venous outflow from the\neye is primarily via the vortex veins and the central retinal vein.\n\nRetinal vascular structure in rodents is of interest, as it is used as a model for\nstudying angiogenesis and microvascular pathology (Stahl et al. 2010). Microvascular lesions and\nangiogenesis can be visualized in living animals by using different imaging tools\n(Ruggeri et al. 2007). The\nretinal vasculature in rodents can also be isolated from the retina for analysis of\ncapillary lesions (Agardh et al.\n1997).\n\nThe retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a monolayer of non-sensory cuboidal cells\nthat exteriorly line the retina. The RPE and retina originate from different portions\nof the optic vesicle during embryonic development and are attached by an extracellular\nmatrix specialized to enable interaction between the RPE and POS. Retinal disease or\ntoxicological insult may result in loss of adhesion between the retina and RPE,\nresulting in retinal detachment and formation of a subretinal space (Mecklenburg and Schraermeyer\n2007). Pathological retinal detachment must be differentiated from artifact\ndetachment, which is readily induced during processing of ocular tissues. RPE has\ncritical roles in the support and viability of the photoreceptors with functions that\ninclude absorption of stray light, adhesion of the sensory retina to the choroid,\nsecretion of growth factors, maintenance of the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM),\nphotoreceptor membrane turnover, and retinoid metabolism (Bok 1993; Marmor\n1998). The apical membrane of RPE cells have numerous, long microvilli that\ninterdigitate with the outer segments of the photoreceptors, allowing for efficient\nturnover of discs as they are shed from the photoreceptors. The accumulation of\ninclusion bodies (see lysosomal accumulations, below) containing photoreceptor outer\nsegment membranes can be observed in aging RPE and are associated with RPE\ndegeneration that can lead to blindness (Marmor 1998). The basal membrane of the RPE has large infoldings and an\nassociation with Bruch\u2019s membrane. Tight junctions between RPE form an important\ncomponent of the blood retinal barrier (BRB) necessary for the maintenance of immune\ndeviation in the posterior segment of the eye. They also prevent leakage of blood\nconstituents from the choriocapillaris, and create osmotic pressure that assists in\ndrawing fluid out of the retina through cellular mechanisms. Transcellular movement of\nglucose, retinol, amino acids and other nutrients into the retina, and that of\nmetabolic wastes out, is regulated by receptors, ion channels and exchangers, and\ncytoplasmic organelles. These have a polar distribution in RPE, and the regulated\nmovement of ions through the cell and IPM creates ionic gradients that maintain\nphotoreceptor excitability and permits electrical transmission of light stimulus\n(Hughs 1998).\n\nRPE have a critical role in the visual cycle of vitamin A, the generation of\n11-cis-retinaldehyde, and subsequent formation of pigments essential for vision. RPE\nacquire vitamin A from the blood (choriocapillaris) via membrane receptors, from\nphotoreceptors following light bleaching and subsequent release, or from shed\nphotoreceptors. Subsequent processing through multiple enzymatic pathways converts\nvitamin A to analogues for storage and/or use in visual function (Palczewski 2014). Aging and\nphoto-oxidative stress can disrupt these pathways and lead to visual impairment and\nretinal degeneration.\n\nIn most mammalian species, RPE contain melanosomes, elliptical-shaped granules of\nmelanin pigment found in the apical and mid-portion cytoplasm of the cell. Melanin\nenhances object discrimination in bright light conditions by absorbing scattered\nlight. In rodents, melanosomes tend to be rounder and fewer in number commensurate\nwith the low-light conditions of their visual needs. Albino species have melanosomes,\nbut lack melanin granules. Melanin tends to diminish and fuse with lipofuscin in RPE\nwith aging. Some pharmacological agents, particularly substances with cationic\nproperties (Boulton 1988) bind to\nmelanin and induce pigmentary changes that may be observed on fundic examination.\nMelanin binding can unintentionally result in drug sequestration, prolonged drug\nexposure to sensitive ocular tissues, enhance free-radical injury, and can cause\nretinal toxicity through impaired RPE function. Age-related changes in melanin\ncontent, lipofuscin accumulation, and the formation of conjugates (melanolipofuscin)\nimpairs light absorption, enhances oxidative stress, and results in RPE\ndegeneration.\n\nRPE produce growth factors and cytokines that contribute to retinal homeostasis and\nan anti-inflammatory environment that can conversely have adverse roles in ocular\ndisease. Cellular transdifferentiation, migration, and proliferation of RPE are\nassociated with the production of sub-retinal fibroplasia (membranes) observed in\nmacular degeneration, and may have a role in fibroplasia at the retinal surface\n(retinal or epiretinal fibroplasia) (Kita\net al. 2014; Mehta et al.\n2014; Zhao et al.\n2013).\n\nThe posterior compartment of the eye is ensheathed in a tough, outer spherical tunic\ncomposed of bundles of fibro-elastic connective tissue arranged concentrically to the\nocular surface. The sclera begins at the limbus, transitioning from regular corneal\nlamellae to irregular scleral lamellae that branch and interweave. The sclera merges\nwith the surrounding dura mater posteriorly and is penetrated by the optic nerve at\nthe posterior margins of the globe. The sclera has roles in protecting the eye from\ninjury, maintaining ocular shape and IOP during movement of the eye, and in aiding\nvisual acuity while reducing back-scatter from light. The sclera is covered by a\nfibroelastic membrane, the Tenon capsule, which forms a sleeve around the attachment\nof the ocular muscles to the sclera. The Tenon capsule fuses with the conjunctiva\nposterior to the limbus, and extends posterior to fuse with connective tissue\nsurrounding the optic nerve. The sub-Tenon space is a site that can be potentially\nexploited in some species for drug administration. The rat does have a Tenon, however\nin the mouse it is poorly defined.\n\nThe sclera has a rich nerve supply but lacks a specific vascular bed, which renders\nthe eye vulnerable to particularly painful or prolonged inflammation. Systemic\nconnective tissue disease often has a scleral component. Inflammation occurring within\nthe sclera may culminate in necrosis because of the sluggish removal of inflammatory\ndebris and slow cell turnover (Ramos,\nAttar et al. 2017).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone.\n\nCell origin varies with tissue type (see individual section).

It may be difficult to differentiate apoptosis\nfrom single cell necrosis in ocular tissues without special stains.

Fibroblastic membranes resemble the fibrotic process that occurs in\nwound healing.Membranes can form under the retina, on the surface of the retina, and\nwithin the vitreous or aqueous humor.When mature, contraction can place tension on attached structures,\nresulting in possible retinal detachments, optic nerve prolapse, lens\ndisplacement, and iridal-cornea adhesion or iridal-limbal adhesion\n(synechia).\n\n\nVaries with tissue type (see individual section).

Fibroplasia is induced by a change in cytokine mileau that favors\ncellular- transdifferentiation and may occur spontaneously as an aging or\ndegenerative disease process, as a sequel to an inflammatory process, or following\ntissue injury as a reparative process. TGF\u03b2 has been implicated in the\npathogenesis of fibroplasia in ocular tissues (Masli and Vega 2011) where it tends to be\nprogressive. Cell populations identified in fibroblastic membranes include corneal\nendothelial cells, spindle cells that are associated with zonule fibers that\nattach to the lens, hyalocytes, retinal glial cells, M\u00fcller cells, and RPE (Joshi, Agrawal et al. 2013).\nFibroblasts may also have a role.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone.\n\nRecruited fibroblasts in response to tissue injury, or endogenous ocular cells\nthat have undergone cellular transformation and assumed a fibroblastic\nphenotype.\n\n\nLinear arrays of fibroblastic cell types and mature collagen.Often associated with tissue injury and subsequent wound healing similar to\nthat observed in systemic reactions.\n\n\nFibroplasia\n\nSee above.\n\nFibrosis should be reserved for findings that include mature collagen.

This is associated with loss of immune deviation (\u201cimmune privilege\u201d),\nand a conversion from the ocular homeostasis immune suppressive environment to one\nthat is pro-inflammatory. Intraocular proteins, normally sequestered from the\nimmune system (preventing establishment of tolerance to self-antigens), may come\nunder immune surveillance and generate a delayed hypersensitivity response,\nresulting in additional ocular injury.

Choroidal\nneovascularization involves the expansion of choroidal vessels into the retina and\nis observed in spontaneous disease of humans with macular degeneration, and in\nsome animal models.

It is driven by a number of local\ncytokine and metalloproteinases influences that are upregulated by diseases that\nresult in anoxia or inflammation within ocular tissues that do not have their own\nblood supply. New blood vessels have poorly formed or inadequate tight junctions\nand thus leak plasma and proteins into the tissue, severely compromising vision.\nNeovascularization can potentially be reversed by removing the inciting cause, and\nthrough treatment with VEGF antagonists, which have proven to be efficacious in\nclinical use.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone.\n\n\nLeukocyte infiltrates without other indications of inflammation (see\ngeneral terminology, above).\n\n\nInflammation\n\n\nLeukocyte infiltrates with features of inflammation (see general\nterminology, above).\n\n\nInfiltrates are not uncommon at the eyelid dermal or conjunctival margins.\nInfiltrates may also be associated with adnexa in the dermis.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nBlepharitis; blepharoconjunctivitis.\n\n\nLeukocyte infiltrates associated with other indications of inflammation\n(see general definition above).\n\n\nInfiltrate, inflammatory cell\n\n\nLeukocyte infiltrates without other features of inflammation.\n\n\nInflammation is macroscopically characterized by excessive sebum or keratin\ndebris adherent to the eyelid margin and eyelashes.

For information on inflammation of the dermis and stroma of\nthe eyelid, the reader is referred to the manuscript on Soft Tissue (see\nIntroduction, Greaves et al.\n2013).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nAcinar and/or ductal epithelial cells.\n\n\nIrregularly shaped tubules or acini with dilated or reduced lumina.Lined by cuboidal or flattened epithelium.Loss of normal vacuolated cytoplasmic appearance.Interstitial fibrosis may be present.The lumina of the tubules may be filled with desquamated cells and\naccumulated sebaceous material.\n\n\nAtrophy of the Meibomian gland has been reported with deficiency/inhibition of\nenzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis (Miyazaki et al. 2001).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nAcini and/or ducts and interstitial tissue.\n\n\nFoci of a single inflammatory cell population or a mixture of different\ncell types without other features of inflammation.\n\n\nMinimal to mild infiltrates of neutrophils and lymphocytes are normally present\nin the meibomian gland (Yoshitomi and Boorman 1990).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nAcini and/or ducts and associated interstitial tissue.\n\n\nFocal or multifocal areas of single or mixed inflammatory cellular\ntypes.Interstitial edema and/or vascular congestion with other indications of\ninflammation (see general terminology above).May be associated with squamous metaplasia of acinar/ductal epithelium or\ninterstitial fibrosis in chronic conditions.Granulomatous or pyogranulomatous inflammation can be observed.\n\n\nInfiltrate, inflammatory cell, Meibomian gland:\n\n\nFoci of single or mixed inflammatory cell types without other features of\ninflammation.\n\n\nModifiers are recommended in relation to the predominant inflammatory cellular\ntype (neutrophilic, eosinophilic, lymphocytic, plasmacytic or histiocytic) or\nmixture of different cellular types (mixed). Viral infections tend to result in\nmultilobular inflammation and may have inclusions present.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nForeign body inflammation; stye; chalazion.\n\nAlveoli/ ducts; often spontaneous and/or age-related.\n\n\nGranulomatous reaction composed of epithelioid macrophages, multinucleated\ngiant cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells.Foreign body may be present (lipid secretions, released secondary to\nblocked ducts).\n\n\nGranulomatous inflammatory reactions of the eyelid margin secondary to released\nlipid secretions of sebaceous glands of Zeis or Meibomian glands are clinically\nreferred to as stye and chalazion, respectively.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nDecreased number of epithelial cells, or decreased cell layers (cornea).\nAttenuation is a specific change observed on spectral microscopy for the corneal\nendothelium (see below) and should not be used in place of atrophy for the cornea\nepithelium.\n\nCorneal or conjunctival epithelial cell; may be drug-induced or incidental.\n\n\nDecreased number of cells, and/or cell layers.May be associated with secondary changes, such as edema.\n\n\nEpithelium, regeneration:\n\n\nReparative phase following erosion/ulceration (flattened cells covering\nulcerated/eroded area); enlarged epithelial cells with mitotic figures are\npresent.\n\n\nArtifact:\n\n\nAssociated with removal of epithelium or endothelium during tissue\nprocessing.\n\n\nInhibition of mitosis (such as by chemotherapeutic agents) causes an inability of\nbasal cells or limbal stem cells to proliferate, leading to decreased numbers of\nepithelial cells/layers. The epithelial cells remaining may appear enlarged and/or\ndisorganized in compensation for fewer cells present. Atrophy does not occur in\nthe endothelium of the cornea, which consists of a single layer.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone.\n\nCornea endothelial cells, in regions where cell loss has occurred.\n\n\nIndividual endothelial cells flatten and spread out to cover spatial\ndefects created by endothelial cell loss. This change may not be appreciated\non light microscopy, and is best visualized using spectral microscopy.On cross section, cells are flattened in profile, and appear smaller on\nhistological examination.Endothelial cell layer may have evidence of cell drop-out.\n\n\nDecreased numbers of endothelial cells.\n\nCell loss without compensatory attenuation; cornea homeostasis is compromised and\nthus there is associated corneal edema in regions of spatial defects. Inflammation\nmay occur secondarily.\n\nWhen endothelial cells are lost due to trauma, disease, or other reasons, the\nadjacent cells spread out in an attempt to cover the resulting defect and maintain\ncornea homeostasis. Attenuation is commonly observed on the peripheral margins of\nthe cornea, although it may be difficult to appreciate on histological examination\nof cross sections. Attenuation and generalized loss of corneal endothelial cells\nare best observed on clinical examination using spectral microscopy. Attenuation\nis seen in rats administered the phototoxic agent, 8-methoxypsoralen, followed by\nexposure to UV radiation.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nCorneal epithelial cells, organized to form a small cystic structure.\n\n\nCystic space that is lined by well-differentiated epithelial cells within\nthe cornea.Epithelial cells may be keratinized.Cyst may contain fluid.Leukocyte infitrates or inflammation may be present.\n\n\nNeoplastic lesions (see Papilloma, squamous cell and Carcinoma, squamous\ncell).\n\nPathogenesis has not been determined \u2013 may either be congenital or the result of\ntrauma, followed by disorganized healing (Geiss and Yoshitomi 1999).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nInjury or functional failure of either the endothelium or epithelium of the\ncornea; barriers may be intact, or a spatial defect may be evident.\n\n\nPaleness of the stroma on H&E staining, and irregular expansion of the\ncollagen fibers.Separation of epithelium or endothelium from the basal lamina.Clear spaces or vacuoles within epithelial cells, or clefts between\nepithelial cells (fluid-filled, but may not be evident following tissue\nprocessing).Edema appears as corneal opacification macroscopically.\n\n\nArtifact splitting of collagen fibers:\n\n\nVarying degrees of hydration of the sectioned tissues can result in\nvariable appearance on the slide, leading to incorrect diagnosis of edema in\nsome instances.\n\n\nEdema often occurs from a functional failure of the corneal endothelium\nhomeostasis mechanisms, resulting in altered stromal fluid and electrolyte\nbalance. Fluid may accumulate in both the stroma (altering the arrangement of the\ncollagen bundles) and in the epithelium. Edema may occur with trauma,\ndevelopmental abnormalities, or degenerative age changes. Similar to other\nspecies, rodents lose endothelial cells with age, which may result in osmotic\ndecompensation. Regardless of cause, corneal edema occurs due to insufficient\nendothelial pumping mechanisms.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nCorneal/conjunctival epithelium. Associated with trauma, reduced tear production\nresulting in dry eyes, topical or gas/vapor caustic agents, and corneal\nmineralization. Unregulated, energy independent, passive cell death with leakage\nof cytoplasm into surrounding tissue and subsequent inflammatory reaction.\n\n\nIncomplete loss (erosion) or focal deficit (ulcer) of the surface\nepithelium.Histologically, the outer epithelial layer is eroded. Abrasions may be\nassociated with inflammatory infiltrates and necrosis.Chronic conditions may be associated with corneal neovascularization.Fluorescein positive when examined in-vivo.\n\n\nInflammation (Keratitis):\n\n\nInflammation of the corneal epithelium and stroma without loss of the\nepithelium. Inflammation may facilitate artifact epithelial separation from\nthe stroma during processing.\n\n\nartifact:\n\n\nProcessing artifacts, such as separation of the cornea epithelium from the\nstroma, are common in the eye. A diagnosis of ulcer should be associated\nwith expectant concurrent findings in the stroma and/or epithelium (e.g.\ninflammation, edema).\n\n\nMineralization (Corneal dystrophy):\n\n\nDystrophy is the clinical term for accumulation of abnormal material in the\ncornea; mineral is most often seen in the rodent. Corneal mineralization may\nbe associated with inflammation, edema and neovascularization.\nMineralization is most often observed in aged rats.\n\n\nAbrasions may be incidental in rodents, often related to caging conditions or\nenvironmental irritants. Topical acid or alkali burns, gases/vapors, dust or other\nforeign particles contacting the eye, and desiccation are all possible causes or\nerosion/ulceration. Erosion and necrosis of conjunctival epithelium may be\nassociated with ocular irritants (Maurer et al. 1998; Maurer and Parker 1996).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nRetrocorneal membrane.\n\nStromal keratocytes or corneal endothelial cells that have undergone cellular\ntransdifferentiation (metaplasia) assuming a fibroblast phenotype. Fibroplasia\noccurs as a reparative process following injury to the cornea endothelium, and\nfrom the failure of adjacent endothelial cells to adequately cover subsequent\nspatial defects.\n\n\nLocalized layers of elongated to spindle-shaped cells overlying the inner\nsurface of the cornea.May be associated with adjacent focal changes to the stroma, such as edema\nor inflammation.\n\n\nCorneal endothelial cells do not regenerate in most species. Corneal fibroplasia\nis more likely to occur when there is loss of enough cells to the point that the\nendothelium cannot respond adequately to cover a defect.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nCorneal scar.\n\nActivated keratocytes.\n\n\nArea within the corneal stroma that microscopically appears as dense\ncollagenous stroma.Fibrosis may correspond macroscopically to corneal opacity.\n\n\nKeratocytes are activated following corneal injury and may proliferate to fill in\nwound gaps. Activated keratocytes contain smooth muscle actin and may\nphenotypically behave similar to myofibroblasts. In these cases high levels of\ncollagen are produced that lack the organized latticelike structure that is\ntypical of the translucent cornea, instead forming an opaque extracellular matrix\n(ECM) within the defect. Transparency can be restored through cell turn-over, and\nreplacement with fibroblasts that are capable of producing ECM that contains\nsulfated glycosaminoglycans (Hassell and Birk 2010).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nIncreased thickness, Descemet\u2019s membrane.\n\nSpontaneous accumulation of collagen within Descemet\u2019s membrane adjacent to the\ncorneal endothelium.\n\nFuch\u2019s Dystrophy (reported in humans):\n\n\nFocal thickenings of Descemet\u2019s membranes associated with endothelial cell\nloss.\n\n\nBaned collagen fibers:\n\n\nSecreted by corneal endothelial cells as a sequela to injury or a disease\nprocess. Banded collagen can be differentiated from unbanded collagen using\nelectron microscopy.\n\n\nHypertrophy of Descemet\u2019s membrane is occasionally observed in aging mice (Jun, Chakravarti et al. 2006).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\n\nFoci of a single inflammatory cell type or a mixture of different cell\ntypes without other features of inflammation.\n\n\nInflammation\n\n\nInfiltrates of leukocytes associated with inflammatory features such as\nedema, hemorrhage and necrosis.\n\n\nInfiltrates of lymphocytes, sometimes with lymphoid follicle formation, are\nnormally present in the conjunctiva (Yoshitomi and Boorman 1990). Infiltrates\nmay be seen at the periperhal margins but are not normally observed within the\ncornea.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nKeratitis (corneal inflammation); Conjunctivitis (conjunctival inflammation).\n\nInflammatory response due to a variety of possible causes, including injury,\ninfection (SDAV, Staphylococcus, others), photosensitization, or necrosis. Type of\nleukocyte response varies with inciting cause.\n\n\nInflammatory cellular infiltrate with associated edema, congestion,\nhemorrhage and/or necrosis.May be associated with neovascularization, degenerative or hyperplastic\nalterations of the epithelium, fibrosis, or mineralization.\n\n\nInfiltrate, inflammatory cell, conjunctiva:\n\n\nFoci of a single population or mixed inflammatory cell types without other\nfeatures of inflammation.\n\n\nModifiers are recommended in relation to the predominant inflammatory cellular\ntype (neutrophilic, eosinophilic, lymphocytic, plasmacytic or histiocytic) or\nmixture of different cellular types (mixed). Ocular irritation is a common\nclinical feature (Maurer et al.\n1998) and while inflammation may originate in either the conjunctiva or\ncornea, it generally extends to both areas. Inflammation of the conjunctiva or\ncornea is associated with submucosal or stromal edema respectively, and may result\nin erosion/ ulceration, and subsequent regeneration of the epithelium.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nCornification; dyskeratosis.\n\nSuperficial keratocytes that become cornified with chronic injury.\n\n\nFocal regions of the cornea that contain superficial layers of keratin.\n\n\nKeratocytes become progressively flattened as they migrate towards the corneal\nsurface for removal. Chronic injury is associated with the production of keratin.\nDefective tear production and vitamin A deficiency are reported causes of corneal\nkeratinization.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nCorneal dystrophy; calcific band keratopathies; dystrophic calcification.\n\nMineralization of the cornea generally occurs secondary to focal injury, but can\nalso occur with metastatic mineralization. Mineralization can develop due to\nincomplete eyelid closure, and subsequent chronic irritation of the cornea.\nMineral formation has also been associated with high ammonia levels due to\nurease-positive bacteria in the bedding. Subepithelial mineralization has been\nreported in numerous mouse strains (Swiss, BALB/C, C2H, DBA/2, C57BL/6) and rats\n(Sprague-Dawley, F344, Wistar).\n\n\nMineralization occurs in the subepithelial region or in the anterior stroma\nand has a basophilic, extracellular granular to globular appearance on\nH&E similar to mineralization elsewhere. Mineralization may be confirmed\nwith von Kossa stain, if present in sufficient quantity.May be associated with epithelial necrosis, foreign body reaction and\nscarring.\n\n\nSequestrum\n\n\nFocal region of divitalized stromal or epithelial tissue surrounded by\nvital tissue. Sequestrum has been reported in several species, but the\noccurrence in rodents is uncertain.\n\n\nMineralization appears as punctate opacities in the cornea grossly.\nMineralization may be related to changes in the corneal microenvironment causing\ncalcium to precipitate. When present in rodents, careful histologic examination of\nall major organs should be conducted to see if there is evidence of systemic\nmineralization. Most instances of mineralization in rodents do not fit the true\ndefinition of corneal dystrophy, described as spontaneous, non-inflammatory,\nbilateral changes with no associated systemic disease. Mouse strains with true\ncorneal dystrophies include C57BL/10ChPr, Rhino and OEL (Van Winkle 1991).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNew blood vessels, cornea.\n\nNeovascularization generally occurs secondary to corneal damage and is often\nassociated with inflammatory mediators. Blood vessels originate from\nextension/proliferation of endothelial cells from the limbal vessels into the\nperipheral margins of the corneal stroma and extend centrally into the normally\navascular cornea.\n\n\nBlood vessels within normally avascular corneal stroma.May be associated with corneal stromal edema and inflammation as well as\nconjunctival congestion.\n\n\nCorneal nerves:\n\n\nSpecial stains or IHC to differentiate corneal nerves from non-perfused\nblood vessels may be necessary.\n\n\nNeovascularization may occur spontaneously in older animals; the finding has been\nreported in nude (Fox1nu) and hairless\n(hr) mice (Smith, Sundberg, and John 2002b; Smith, Hawes et al. 1996b). Vessels may persist\nas nonperfused ghost vessels visible on ophthalmic exam as linear opacities.\nNeovascularization can be related to deficiencies of tryptophan, riboflavin,\nVitamin A and zinc. In some species, corneal vessels may extend normally beyond\nthe limbus, and may/may not be perfused.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nExtracellular granular or amorphous material deposited within the stroma or\nepithelium of the cornea or conjunctiva. Increased pigmentation also occurs from\nan increase in number of melanocytes within the tissue, or an increase in\nintracellular pigment within the resident epithelial cells.\n\n\nVariably sized, shaped and colored aggregates of material, either\ncytoplasmic or extracellular.\n\n\nMineralization\n\nSee above.\n\nPigment may be endogenous (e.g. melanin), occur from hemorrhage (hemosiderin,\nhemoglobin), or derive from exogenous sources (e.g.foreign body). Increased\npigmentation associated with an increase in melanin granules can occur with\nchronic irritation or trauma. Melanin granules can be found intracellular within\nintraepithelial melanocytes (which may increase in number following injury) or\ncorneal epithelial cells (thought to acquire melanin from melanocytes), or as\nextracellular deposits (McCracken and Klintworth 1976). Extracellular deposits of brown-colored\nmetabolic intermediates in the cornea epithelium or stroma occurred with\nadministration of chlorpromazine and other phenothiazine deritives, and pigment\nchanges have been reported with exposure to gold, mercury and analine dyes (Hogan and Zimmerman 1962).\nPotential vision effects vary with severity and location; pigmentation within the\nperilimbal region has no impact to vision, and pigmentation in the central cornea\nmay go unnoticed to the patient if minimal. Pigmentation resolves over time with\nremoval of the stimulus and when intracellular, with cell turnover.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nLipidosis; phospholipidosis.\n\nLysosomal accumulation of lipid or other substances (including\nglycosaminoglycans, mucopolysaccharides and others) within the cytoplasm of\nepithelial cells, endothelial cells, or keratocytes. These are generally removed\nduring tissue processing, resulting in the appearance of clear vacuolated spaces\non light microscopy.\n\n\nClear cytoplasmic vacuoles following tissue processing.Phospholipidosis causes lipid-like vacuoles in corneal epithelial cells and\nkeratocytes; bluish granules may be observed on H&E staining.\n\n\n\nSemi-thin sections followed by Toluidine Blue staining: irregular\ncytoplasmic inclusions are seen with phospholipidosis.Electron microscopy: typical lamellar and crystalline inclusions of\nphospholipidosis.\n\n\nArtifact vacuolation\n\nVacuolation resulting from edema (see above; Figure 2)\n\nVacuolation may be drug-induced. Some cationic amphiphilic drugs can cause\nphospholipidosis of the corneal epithelium and/or corneal endothelium. Tilorone\ncan cause phospholipidosis and mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) in rats. Lysosomal\nstorage diseases result in the abnormal accumulation of substances, most often\nglycosaminoglycans, within cells. MPS VII, caused by a deficiency in\nBglucuronidase, is an autosomal recessive mutation reported to occur in homozygous\nmice (gusmps/gusmps) (Smith, Sundberg, and John 2002b). Lysosomal\naccumulation may result in corneal opacities that are grossly visible on\nophthalmic examination.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nPectinate ligament dysplasia; mesodermal dysgenesis, goniodysgenesis.\n\nMalformation occurs from a failure in development of the spaces forming the\ntrabecular meshwork.\n\nSecondary alterations of the drainage angle:\n\n\nDue to iridal-trabecular adhesion, trabecular collapse, trabecular\nfibrosis, or proliferation of the cells that line the trabecular\nmeshwork.\n\n\nMalformation of the filtration angle significantly impacts aqueous fluid outflow,\nand can result in glaucoma. Abnormalities of the aqueous plexus and the trabecular\nmeshwork occur in Foxc1 and Foxc2 mutant mice (Smith, Sundberg, and John 2002b).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nCompaction of trabecular beams; collapse, trabecular meshwork.\n\nDisplacement, compression or collapse of the trabecular beams, reducing or\nobliterating the spaces between the beams.\n\n\nReduced space between the trabeculae, compaction of trabecular beams, and\npartial or complete obliteration of aqueous plexus.The presence of cells and/or material within the drainage angle/trabecular\nmeshwork.Enlargement and/or distortion of the eye if aqueous flow is sufficiently\nimpaired.\n\n\nMalformation, filtration angle\n\n\nMalformations are best observed on ophthalmoscopy.\n\n\nA narrow filtration angle is associated with increased resistance in aqueous\nhumour outflow and IOP, clinically causing glaucoma. Glaucoma is more commonly\nobserved spontaneously in larger species, but can be induced experimentally in\nrodents. The trabecular meshwork is scant in rodents and spontaneous collapse\napparently is rare. However, iridal-cornea adhesion can block the outflow of\naqueous humor to a degree that the filtration angle collapses on itself. Following\nlaser photocoagulation, the iris may scar to the angle over the meshwork\n(iridal-trabecular adhesion), and hyphema of the anterior chamber or atrophy of\nthe ciliary body may occur (Levkovitch-Verbin, Quigley et al.\n2002). Collapse of the trabecular meshwork may be experimentally induced\nin animal glaucoma models (i.e. laser photocoagulation) (Ueda, Sawaguchi et al. 1998, Levkovitch-Verbin, Quigley et al.\n2002). Substances such as cells (red blood cells and leukocytes), free\npigment, melanocytes or macrophages containing pigment, or test material that has\nbeen administered into the aqueous or vitreous humour may become lodged within the\nmeshwork and impede aqueous flow.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nInflammation, anterior segment; uveitis\n\nRecruitment of leukocytes originating from the systemic circulation.\n\n\nThe presence of leukocytes of single or mixed cell type in the anterior\nchamber.Generally associated with increased protein in the aqueous appearing as\neosinophilic fluid.Severe inflammation may appear as flocculent fluid and/or contain beads or\nstrands of fibrin.\n\n\nNone\n\nLeukocytes are not found in the anterior chamber without inflammation in some\nother part of the eye, e.g. the cornea, uvea, or vitreous. However on occasion it\nmay be possible to observe residual inflammatory cells following an inflammatory\ninsult that have yet to be cleared from the anterior chamber, or that have\nmigrated from the posterior to the anterior chamber.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nIncreased protein\n\nVascular compromise within the uveal tissues of the anterior segment.\n\n\nGenerally associated with increased protein in the aqueous appearing as\neosinophilic fluid.Lack of other inflammatory features.Aqueous may contain beads or strands of fibrin.\n\n\nNone\n\nThe aqueous normally has a low protein content and increases are generally\nassociated with an inflammatory process within the uveal tissues of the anterior\nsegment (ciliary body, iris). However, on occasion an increase in protein may be\nobserved in the eye without other indications of inflammation (drug\nadministration, needle insertion). Increased protein is diagnosed as \u2018flare\u2019 on\nophthalmoscopy.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nIridocorneal fibroplasia or strands; iridal-corneal adhesion. Adhesions may be\ncongenital or acquired.\n\nAdhesions between the anterior edge of the iris and the endothelium of the cornea\n(anterior synechia) or the posterior edge of the iris and the anterior surface of\nthe lens (posterior synechia).\n\n\nAdherence of the iris to the cornea or lens (on ophthalmoscopy observed as\nanterior and posterior synechia, respectively). Anterior adhesions to the\ncornea can potentially block the outflow of the aqueous humor through the\nfiltration angle causing increased intraocular pressure and glaucoma (Ramos, Attar, et al.\n2017).Peripheral anterior synechia refers to a condition in which the iris\nadheres to the angle. Failure of aqueous drainage may result from peripheral\nanterior adhesions in conditions such as uveitis (Williams 2007).Pigment on the anterior lens capsule suggests prior occurrence of posterior\nadhesions.Adhesions may cause opacities in either the cornea or lens (Foster 1958).\n\n\nArtifact\n\n\nArtifacts associated with tissue processing can result in displacement of\nthe iris; pigment on the anterior lens capsule or corneal endothelium may\nalso occur as an artifact of processing.\n\n\nAdhesions can be detected on examination through topical instillation of a\nmydriatic agent; distortion of the pupil occurs upon pupil dilation. Acquired\nadhesions are most often observed as a sequela to anterior uveitis, but may also\noccur with trauma, or can be experimentally induced by laser photocoagulation\n(Ueda, Sawaguchi et al.\n1998). Spontaneous adhesions are observed in SD rats (Taradach and Greaves 1984), but are rare\nin the mouse. Adhesions in older mice are usually a sequela of inflammation in the\nanterior segment. Posterior adhesions in mice are often associated with cataracts\n(Geiss and Yoshitomi\n1999). The etiology of congenital adhesions is not well understood.\nSynechia is a clinical ophthalmic term, and should not be used as a histological\ndiagnosis.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nReduced size, ciliary body\n\nMyofibrils of the ciliary body; dysgenesis associated with defects in Fibrillin-2\n(Fbn2) gene.\n\n\nDecreased size of ciliary body \u2013 often segmental.Associated with a decreased number of folds on EM examination.\n\n\nAtrophy, Ciliary Body\n\nDegeneration, Ciliary Body\n\n\nIn either atrophy or degeneration, a loss of tissue mass occurs secondary\nto traumatic or inflammatory injury, or to another disease process.\n\n\nReported in Fbn2 -/- mice (Shi, Tu\net al. 2013b). Hypoplasia of the ciliary body is associated with\nanatomical defects in the iris.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nColoboma (iris, or posterior); dyscoria.\n\nFailure of closure in the optic fissure can cause malformations resulting in\nsmall holes, spatial defects, or other irregularities to the iris.\n\n\nThe rodent iris contains scant stroma and has a narrow-curved profile on\ncross section. Malformations can appear as irregular expansions of the\nstroma, or as blunting or folding at the inner margin. Spatial defects may\nbe recognized as irregularities in either the posterior or anterior surface\non histopathology; differentiation from tissue processing artifact is\nfacilitated by advanced knowledge of clinical findings.Posterior or choroidal coloboma is a spatial defect of the choroidal blood\nvessels near the optic nerve, and may occur simultaneously with iris\nmalformation in congenital cases. In these occurrences, the regional sensory\nretina and RPE are not developed, and the retina vasculature is\ndistorted.\n\n\nAbnormalities in pupil shape:\n\n\nAssociated with inflammation of the anterior uvea.\n\n\nIridal malformations in young rodents (especially mice) appear as an abnormality\nin pupil shape (spatial defect in the iris), and is clinically diagnosed as\npupillary dyscoria (Rubin and Daly\n1982). Careful sectioning is important to capture spatial defects\nhistologically. Coloboma is a clinical term, and should not be used as a\nhistological diagnosis. Localized developmental errors may lead to spatial\ndefects/holes in other specific ocular structures such as the choroid and optic\nnerve. They can occur in association with microphthalmia (Geiss and Yoshitomi 1999; Williams 2002).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nPersistent pupillary strands; iridal fetal membrane.\n\nVessels and mesenchyme of the pupillary membrane.\n\n\nCollagenous or membranous strand of tissues found in the anterior or\nposterior chamber, or spanning across the pupillary opening (Heywood 1973).Strands of tissue may appear on cross section as free-floating, or can be\ntethered at one or more places to the iris, lens, or cornea.\n\n\nPersistent embryonic lens vasculature:\n\n\nA more likely diagnosis if associated with the presence of blood in the\nanterior segment.\n\n\niridal fibroplasia\n\nPersistent pupillary membranes are remnant vascular strands of the developing\niris that fail to undergo postnatal atrophy; they are best diagnosed on\nophthalmoscopy. Membranes may be free-floating, bridge the iris, or extend from\nthe iris to the lens or cornea where they are associated with focal opacity of the\nlens, or corneal opacity, respectively (Taradach, Regnier et al. 1981). They may be\nobserved in Sprague-Dawley rats, Crj:CD (SD) rats, and in mice, and individuals\nwith this finding should be excluded from ocular studies. Persistent pupillary\nmembranes may block the filtration angle, impair aqueous drainage, and cause\npupil-block glaucoma (Young et al.\n1974; Williams\n2007).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nDegeneration, iris\n\nIris stroma.\n\n\nDecreased size of iris associated with reduction in stroma and blood\nvessels.Iris may appear irregular in size or shape circumferentially on cross\nsection.Irregular contours may suggest the presence of spatial defects within the\nstroma.Enlarged posterior epithelial cells containing prominent pigment\ngranules.Pupillary sphincter and ciliary processes appear hypertrophic.\n\n\nIris atrophy is best diagnosed on ophthalmic examination and can readily be\nrecognized due to distortions of the pupil size and shape and poor response to\nmiotics. As the iris atrophies, small holes in the stroma appear initially,\nfollowed by coalescence, and the stroma appears increasingly disorganized as\nmesodermal tissue and blood vessels regress. Iris atrophy occurs in the (C57L X\nA/He) F1 mouse (Geiss and\nYoshitomi 1999), and may occur in association with glaucoma in aging\nDBA/2J mice (Smith, Sundberg, and\nJohn 2002b).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nDegeneration, ciliary body\n\nCiliary body myofibrils.\n\n\nDecreased size and/or decreased numbers of myofibrils within the ciliary\nbody.Fragmentation of myofibrils and detachment of the sarcoplasma may be\nobserved on electron microscopy.\n\n\nAtrophy of the ciliary body muscle has been described in aged Wistar rats (Eiben and Liebich 1989) and\nmay occur in other rodents. Atrophy of the ciliary muscle may result in\ndistortions of the iris, and pupil size and shape.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nMicrovasculature of the iris.\n\n\nDilated vessels with the presence of erythrocytes (congestion as a\nhistological diagnosis should be avoided due to the common occurrence of\npostmortem pooling of blood within the microvasculature).\n\n\nVascular dilation:\n\n\nAssociated with inflammation.\n\n\nArtifact of postmortem blood pooling\n\nIridal blood circulation is best assessed on clinical examination using\nophthalmoscopy. Dilation of iridal vessels, with or without the presence of\nerythrocytes, can occur irrespective of physiological status of the eye at time of\neuthanasia. Iritis is a clinical term associated with vascular congestion observed\non ophthalmoscopy irrespective of the presence of inflammation, and should not be\nused as a histological diagnosis.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nLeukocytes that have entered the eye via the uveal vessels of the ciliary body\nand iris.\n\n\nInfiltrates of leukocytes in the ciliary body or processes, and iris stroma\nand/or epithelium.Inflammatory features are not present.\n\n\nMononuclear cells, including lymphocyte aggregates, are found spontaneously in\nuveal tissues.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nLeukocytes that have entered the eye via the uveal vessels of the ciliary body\nand iris. Cell lineage varies with inciting cause.\n\n\nInfiltrates of leukocytes in the ciliary body or processed, and iris stroma\nand/or epithelium.Inflammatory features such as edema and expansion of the stroma,\nhemorrhage, and/or necrosis are present.Vascular involvement is usually evident with inflammation (activated\nendothelia, damage to vascular walls, perivascular infiltrates).\n\n\nInflammation is the preferred diagnostic term used with appropriate modifiers as\nto cell type when features of inflammation are present. Inflammation of the iris\nor ciliary body may be associated with aqueous leukocytes and protein, which\nappear as irregular regions of eosinophilic, amorphous fluid in the anterior\ncompartment of the eye. Leakage of protein into the aqueous is diagnosed as\n\u2018flare\u2019 on ophthalmic examination. Inflammation of the iris indicates a breach in\nthe blood-ocular barrier, and a possible loss of immune deviation. Uveitis is a\nclinical term and should not be used as a histological diagnosis.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nDiscoloration, iris; alteration in iris color\n\nChange in the number of melanocytes within the stroma, or the quantity of pigment\ngranules within the melanocytes. Only relevant in pigmented species or\nstrains.\n\n\nIncreased numbers or size of melanocytes in the iris stroma.If decreased pigmentation, decreased number of melanocytes or decreased\namount of pigment within melanocytes.\n\n\nSequel to hemorrhage (hemosiderin).\n\nPigment changes can occur following administration of compounds (for example\nurethane in neonatal hooded rats; Roe,\nMillican et al. 1963). Decreased pigmentation may be associated with\ninflammation, edema, and aging. Pigment changes can also be congenital (Schafer and Render 2013b).\nIncreased pigment deposition occurs in DBA/2J mice homozygous for iris pigment\ndispersion or iris stromal atrophy (Smith, Sundberg, and John 2002b). Increased pigment and/or a change in\npigment may also occur with topical application of prostanoid compounds such as\nlatanoprost.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nLysosomal storage disease, varies with cause (e.g., phospholipidosis).\n\nEpithelium of the iris or ciliary body processes. Metabolic defect leading to\naccumulation of molecules within the epithelial cells of iris, ciliary body\nprocesses, or ciliary muscle.\n\n\nVacuolated spaces within the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells of the iris\nor ciliary processes, or within the ciliary muscle.\n\n\nCystine crystal accumulation has been reported in the ciliary body stroma and\nprocess epithelium of CTNS -/- mice, an animal model for cystinosis lysosomal\nstorage disease (Kalatzis,\nSerratrice et al. 2007).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nLens fiber swelling; lens fiber fragmentation; Morgagnian globule; bladder cells;\nliquefaction; cleft formation; cataract.\n\nDegeneration results from biochemical changes that alter the homeostasis of the\nlens, denature the proteins of the lens, and/or disrupt the integrity of the lens\nfiber. The initial biochemical change is often acidification, whereupon fibers\nlose fluid, shrink, and fluid collects in clefts between fibers. With other\npathogeneses, such as with osmotic changes, the fibers will instead swell and\nbecome globular (\u2018Morgagnian globules\u2019). Degeneration is a diagnostic term that\nencompasses many of the specific terms listed below.\n\n\nClefts - spaces form between lens fibers, which have a rounded profile,\nwith accumulation of fluid with variable amounts of protein. Lens fibers may\nfragment if the lesion progresses.Fragmentation \u2013 swollen, membrane-bound fragments; rounded globules\n(Morgagnian globules).Liquefaction \u2013 collection of proteinaceous fluid within the lens cortex as\nsmall pockets or larger areas, in place of lens fibers.In severe cases, may be associated with dystrophic mineralization.\n\n\nArtifact:\n\n\nIt is important to recognize artifact lens fiber fragmentation due to\nfixation, which is often angular, and may result in cleft formation (this is\nmost notable in nonhuman primate eyes fixed with modified Davidson\u2019s fluid).\nCareful comparison to concurrent controls is necessary.\n\n\nAutolysis\n\nVacuolation\n\n\nSee below\n\n\n\u2018Degeneration\u2019 may be used as an aggregate diagnostic term to include many of the\nnonspecific changes observed in the lens fibers, while more specific changes are\nbest described as comments. In advanced disease the cortical fibers are completely\nliquefied and lost, and the nucleus of the lens is free floating in the lens\ncapsule. Cataract is a clinical diagnostic term used to describe opacities\nvisualized on ophthalmic examination, and should not be used as a histological\ndiagnosis.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nLens luxation; lens displacement.\n\nRupture of zonular fibers (suspensory ligament of the lens) that suspend the lens\nbehind the iris. Primary occurrence may be related to hereditary zonulary\nweakness. Spontaneous occurrence may be secondary to trauma, glaucoma,\ninflammation, and neoplasia.\n\n\nOn histology, the lens is displaced either into the anterior chamber\n(anterior luxation) or posterior compartment (posterior luxation).Chronic dislocation may be associated with secondary changes, such as\ninflammation, vitreal fibroplasia, and iridal-lens adhesions.\n\n\nArtifact:\n\n\nAssociated with processing, particularly trimming.\n\n\nPosterior luxation may be associated with secondary trauma to the retina and\ncataract formation. Anterior luxation may be associated with adhesions between the\nanterior lens and posterior iris (synechia) or with the corneal endothelium.\nFibroblastic transdifferentiation (metaplasia) of the anterior lens epithelial\ncells may occur as a sequela (Tanaka, Inagaki et al. 1995). Due to the frequent occurrence of artifact\ndisplacement of the lens during tissue processing, this diagnosis should be made\nwith caution.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nMetaplasia, fibrous, or cellular-transdifferentiation, lens epithelium.\n\nInjury to the lens and subsequent cellular transdifferentiation (metaplasia) of\nthe anterior lenticular epithelium.\n\n\nSpindloid cells and an eosinophilic collagenous matrix in place of the lens\nepithelium and subjacent lens fibers.Linear arrays of collagen.\n\n\nHyperplasia, Lens epithelium\n\n\nSee below. (Figures 18, 56)\n\n\nFibrosis\n\n\nIf mature collagen is present.\n\n\nFollowing injury, the anterior lens epithelium assumes a myofibroblast-like\nphenotype that produces type I and type III collagen and glycosaminoglycans,\nforming fibrous tissue. Fibroplasia often occurs in association with hyperplasia\nof the anterior lenticular epithelium. A new lens capsule may be secreted over the\nfibrotic region following maturation.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nIncreased size, lens capsule.\n\nAnterior lenticular epithelium.\n\n\nIncreased thickness of lens capsule.May be uniform (age-related) or focal (possible response to injury).\n\n\nThe anterior lenticular epithelium continues to produce lens capsule material for\nthe life of the animal, i.e., the anterior lens capsule will continue to thicken\nwith age in the animal, while the posterior lens capsule does not.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nIncreased size, lens epithelium.\n\nInjury to the anterior lenticular epithelium.\n\n\nEnlarged or swollen cell profile.Often associated with adjacent swollen, pale lens fiber.\n\n\n\nVacuolation, associated with inclusions.\n\n\nSwollen lens fibers are most commonly seen in the area of the nuclear bow,\nparticularly in association with damage caused by exposure to phototoxicants and\nUVA light. Bright eosinophilic spherical globules of denatured proteins\n(Morgagnian globules), may be present.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nIncreased size/swelling of lens fiber; degeneration of lens fiber; \u2018bladder\ncells\u2019.\n\nFluid intake by lens fibers most often occurs due to hyperosmotic conditions.\n\n\nSwelling of lens fiber can vary from scattered individual fiber profiles\nthat are increased in size, to numerous, enlarged fusiform cells with foamy\ncytoplasm (\u2018bladder cells\u2019).Variable eosinophilic staining.\n\n\nDegeneration\n\n\nSee above\n\n\nIncreased glucose or other simple sugars, among other agents, can promote fluid\nintake resulting in swollen fibers. Swollen lens fibers may not produce opacities\nidentifiable on ophthalmic examination, and may potentially be reversible. Simple\nsugars passively diffuse into the lens fibers, but once inside, they are actively\nreduced by aldose reductase (AR), which has high activity in the lens fibers.\nGlucose is converted to sorbitol, which does not readily diffuse out of the lens\nfiber. Significant accumulation of sorbitol within the fiber creates a\nhyperosmotic environment that results in passive diffusion of fluid into the\nfiber. Swelling may be irreversible with agents that are not metabolized by the\nlens fiber. Degeneration results (see above) if the change progresses and there is\ndenaturation and coagulation of crystalline proteins, or if breaks occur in the\nfiber membrane.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nPhacoclastic uveitis.\n\nLeukocyte infiltrates (neutrophilic and/or granulomatous) within the lens.\n\n\nAccumulation of neutrophils and/or macrophages into and around the\nlens.Lens fibers associated with the inflammatory cells are often liquefied or\nfragmented.\n\n\nLeukocyte infitrates into the lens are generally not innocuous, and thus\ninvariably imply the presence of inflammation. Infectious processes are common\ncauses. Injury to the lens can result in inflammation but more often results in\nproliferation of the anterior lens capsule. Phacoclastic uveitis is a clinical\nterm associated with rupture of the lens and inflammation.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nCalcification; dystrophic mineralization/calcification.\n\nInjury to, or degeneration of, lens fibers resulting in mineral deposition, or\ncalcification of the damaged tissue.\n\n\nLens fibers have intensely basophilic granules or crystalline material.\n\n\nMineral deposition or calcification is not an uncommon sequela to degenerative\nchanges of the lens, particularly those that result in devitalization of the\ntissue.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nAnterior lenticular epithelium toxicant or inflammatory injury.\n\n\nSee features of single cell necrosis described above.Focal, multifocal, or diffuse loss of anterior lenticular epithelium may\noccur.\n\n\nAntineoplastics and radiomimetics can cause necrosis (or apoptosis) of the\nanterior lenticular epithelium.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nPosterior lens capsule.\n\n\nExtruded lens fibers (into the vitreous) from the posterior aspect of the\nlens.Spatial defect or break in posterior lens capsule evident on\nhistopathology.Free ends of the lens fibers tend to coil away from the site of the\nbreak.Adjacent lens fibers tend to have degenerative features.\n\n\nArtifact\n\nSpontaneous rupture of the lens capsule can occur in rodents as early as 10 weeks\nof age and is usually in the posterior portion of the lens since it is thinner\nthan the anterior lens capsule (Tanaka, Inagaki et al. 1996). Rupture may also occur in association with\ncataracts or trauma. Rupture of the capsule can be associated with a significant\ninflammatory response in the vitreous and lens.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nPhospholipidosis.\n\nVacuolation of lens epithelium or fibers is associated with cytoplasmic\ninclusions that generally represent lysomal accumulation of molecules.\n\n\nFoamy vacuolation of the cytoplasm of the anterior lens epithelium.Vacuoles are non-staining or contain lightly amphiphilic material.\n\n\nHypertrophy, Lens epithelium or Hypertrophy, Lens fiberlens Fiber\nliquification\n\nDefinitive diagnosis may require electron microscopy to demonstrate the presence\nof electron-dense lamellar inclusions within lysosomes. Several drugs are known to\ncause phospholipidosis resulting in lysomal accumulation of both the drug and\ncationic amphiphilic molecules in either the lens epithelium or lens fibers.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nDevelopment anomaly; absent vitreous\n\nAgenesis of the vitreous is associated with other ocular development disorders\nthat result in microphthalmia.\n\n\nThe eye is markedly smaller then normal (microphthalmia).Internal structures are malformed, rudimentary, or absent.\n\n\nDevelopment of the vitreous is closely associated with that of the lens, retina,\nand retinal vasculature and thus development abnormalties in any one structure are\nreflected in the other structures, including the vitreous (Kingston et. al., 2014). Mutations in Pax6,\nMitf, Cat4 and other genes have been implicated in the occurance in mice (Smith et al., 1994; Smith, John, and Nishina 2002;\nCollinson et al, 2000).\nWhile failure of the development of the vitreous has been reported in mice in\nassociation with microphthalmia (Smith, Roderick, Sundberg 1994), it is also possible that development of\nthe primary vitreous may begin, but not be completed. Other potential causes\ninclude infectious diseases and toxicities. Experimental exposure to alcohol is a\nmodel for fetal alcohol syndrome in which microphthalmia occurs.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nPersistent primary vitreous.\n\nEmbryonic hyaloid vessels that fail to completely involute and regress.\n\n\nGenerally, only small remnants (1-5 arteries) or a single vessel with\nmultiple branches extending from the optic disc into the vitreous cavity are\nobserved.Vessels may extend from the optic disc through the vitreous to contact the\nposterior pole of the lens.Hyaloid vessels that extend along the inner surface of the sensory retina\nfrom the optic disc to the lens have also been reported (Heywood 1973).Hemorrhage in the vitreous may be an associated finding in rats.\n\n\nPersistence of a portion of the embryonic hyaloid vessels is a congenital finding\nreported in rats (Hebel and\nStromberg 1976, Taradach, Regnier et al. 1981, Taradach and Greaves 1984, Rubin 1986, Kuno, Usui et al. 1991, Shibuya, Satou et al. 1999, Williams 2002). Hyaloid vasculature\ngradually undergoes involution, especially during the first 6 weeks; the incidence\nis less than 1% by the end of one year (Heywood 1973). Mice have a similar hyaloid system as rats do that\ngenerally regresses by 30 days (Smith, John, and Nishina 2002). Intravitreal hemorrhage does not appear\nto be as common in mice as it is in rats (Rubin 1986).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nPHPV; persistent fetal vasculature (PFV).\n\nDevelopment anomaly that occurs from failure of the embryological vitreous and\nhyaloid vasculature (used in formation of the fetal eye) to regress.\n\n\nExcess mesenchymal tissue; often associated with persistent hyaloid\nvessels.Generally fibrous tissue, but may be cartilaginous tissue.Blood vessels and mesenchymal tissue extend from the optic disc to the\nposterior capsule of the lens near the posterior pole where it blends into\nthe embryonic vessel, the posterior tunic vasculosa lentis (hyperplastic\ntunica vasculosa lentis).\n\n\nMutations are a common cause of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous in mice\n(Smith, John, and Nishina\n2002).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nVitreal membranes; fibrovascular tissue proliferation.\n\nMultiple cell origins have been implicated in the formation of vitreal membranes\nincluding hyalocytes, spindle cells associated with zonule fibrils, M\u00fcller cells,\nglial cells, and RPE. Current thinking is that these cells transdifferentiate and\nacquire phenotypic characteristics of fibroblasts or myofibroblasts with\ncontractile proteins.\n\n\nLinear strands of cells with a fibroplastic phenotype located anywhere\nwithin the vitreous.Linear arrays of fibrillary collagenous tissue strands, often multilayered,\nthat resemble a mat of fibrous connective tissue.Fibroplastic strands of tissue frequently tether to fixed structures such\nas the lens, retina, and optic disc.Vitreal fibroplasia is often associated with chronic inflammation,\nhypertrophic hyalocytes, and pigmented hyalocytes.\n\n\nFibrosis:\n\n\nMature collagen of relatively low cellularity is present; fibrosis is more\nlikely to be observed in end-stage lesions.\n\n\nCell transdifferentiation, proliferation, and migration are thought to occur in\nthe eye in a similar manner to fibrotic reactions that occur systemically.\nCytokines, in particular TGB\u03b2, have been ascribed a primary role in the process.\nFibroblastic membranes tend to tether to fixed ocular tissues, such as the lens,\nretina, and optic nerve disc. Because they contain contractile proteins, tension\nis transferred to these structures, and can result in lens luxation, retinal\ndetachments, and optic nerve prolapse. Vitreal membranes appear as vitreal\nopacities on ophthalmic examination. In rats, vitreous fibroplasia occurs with or\nwithout vessels, and may be accompanied by hemorrhage, pigmentladen macrophages\nand inflammatory cells (Taradach and Greaves 1984). Fibrovascularization, or organization of the\nvitreous body, has also been reported in F344 rats with advanced retinal\ndegeneration (Yoshitomi and\nBoorman 1990), and likely represents a similar pathogenesis. Vitreal\nfibroplasia tends to be a dynamic and progressive process. The presence of mature\ncollagen may warrant a diagnosis of fibrosis.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nIntraocular blood vessels.\n\n\nPresence of erythrocytes, ranging from a population of scattered cells to\nlarge aggregates, accompanied by serum.\n\n\nErythrocytes, Extravasation\n\n\nBreakdown of tight junctions between endothelial cells of retinal blood\nvessels.\n\n\nA common source of spontaneous hemorrhage in young animals is a patent vascular\nhyaloid. Erythrocytes may be derived from patent hyaloid vessels for 3 weeks or\nmore following birth (Hebel\nand Stromberg 1976). Small numbers of erythrocytes and small clots that\nvary in size eventually resolve, generally without sequelae (Rubin, 1986).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nHemorrhage from any cause may result in red blood cell engulfment and processing\nby hyalocytes (resident macrophages) or recruited macrophages (similar to that\nobserved systemically). Patent hyaloid vessels are a potential source of RBCs.\n\n\nHyalocytes and macrophages containing brown pigmented granules are\nobserved, primarily in the cortical vitreous, wherever hyalocytes\nconcentrate (i.e. adjacent to posterior retina and optic disc).\n\n\nBecause of the slow turnover of fluid and cellular components of the vitreous,\ncells containing hemosiderin may persist in the vitreous for prolonged periods of\ntime following the occurrence of hemorrhage.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nHyalitis (if limited to increased numbers of hyalocytes) and infiltration,\ninflammatory cell, if additional leukocytes are present.\n\n\nVaries with cell lineage and inciting cause.Increased numbers of hyalocytes.Leukocytes recruited from the systemic circulation; can be observed near\nthe retinal surface as part of the immune surveillance process of the\neye.\n\n\nAs resident macrophages, hyalocytes are responsible for clearing debris from the\nvitreous, and are responsive to perturbations within the eye, especially the\nvitreous. Increased numbers and increased variability in appearance is associated\nwith intravitreal injections in the absence of other inflammatory cell types\nsuggesting that changes in hyalocytes can be sensitive indicator of subtle changes\nin the eye. Due to the slow turnover rate of the vitreous, hyalocytes and other\ninflammatory cells tend to have a prolonged presence in the vitreous, lasting well\nbeyond that of the inciting cause.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nVitritis.\n\nVaries with cell lineage and inciting cause.\n\n\n Leukocytes derived from the systemic circulation.Leukocytes are most often observed on histopathology at or near the retinal\nsurface, posterior to the lens, or near the optic disc, but can also be\nobserved throughout the vitreous.Recruited leukocytes typically result from secondary spread of inflammation\nfrom other structures of the globe (Taradach and Greaves 1984).Granulomatous inflammation may result in cellular aggregates within the\nvitreous that appear as opacities on ophthalmic examination.\n\n\nOcular inflammation can occur from a number of inciting causes, including\ninfectious and immune-mediated diseases, metabolic disorders, toxicities, and\ntrauma. Inflammation in the vitreous implies a breach of the BOB, and loss of\nimmune deviation. Cytokine changes to the intraocular environment that are\nassociated with inflammatory conditions can induce transdifferentiation of ocular\ncells and result in fibroplasia (vitreous or retinal/epiretinal fibroplasia).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nOsseous metaplasia; cartilaginous metaplasia; cellular transdifferentiation.\n\nTransdifferentiation of a cell population to bone or cartlilage.\n\n\nPresence of bone or cartilage matrix in the vitreous body (Taradach and Greaves\n1984).\n\n\nMineralization\n\n\nSee below.\n\n\nMechanism of intraocular bone or cartilage formation is poorly understood, but\nmay be seen with ocular trauma, or possibly conditions that result in anoxia and\ndegeneration of the vitreous. Cellular transdifferentiation requires the\nelaboration of appropriate cytokines that favor bone or cartilage production. Both\nmineralization and bone or cartilage metaplasia result in vitreal opacities on\nophthalmic examination.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nMetastatic mineralization or calcification; dystrophic calcification.\n\nVitreous matrix, or cells within the vitreous. Deposition of calcium salts within\nthe vitreous.\n\n\nIrregular deposits of mineral; may be located anywhere within the\nvitreous.May be accompanied by degenerative features in adjacent ocular structures\n(dystrophic calcification).\n\n\nVitreous metaplasia, Bone or Cartilage\n\n\nSee above.\n\n\nMineral deposition in the vitreous is similar to that which occurs systemically\nfrom two different processes: a) systemic metabolic disorder of calcium regulation\nresulting in deposition of calcium salts in otherwise normal tissue (metastatic\ncalcification or mineralization), and b) deposition of calcium in tissue as a\ndegenerative process or secondary to trauma (dystrophic calcification). Conditions\nthat favor a dystrophic process include the presence of divitalized cells, and/or\nconditions that result in anoxia and degeneration of the vitreous.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nRetinal dysplasia; linear retinopathy; retinochoroidal degeneration; retinal\ndystrophy; retinal anomaly.\n\nNon-specific response to diverse stimuli that affect retinal cell differentiation\nduring development.\n\n\nFocal to multifocal rosette-like and tubular structures expanding and\ndistorting the inner and outer nuclear layers.Rarely lesions can diffusely affect the retina.Rosette-like and tubular structures can present variable morphology with a\ncombination of the following features:One to multiple layers of cells with nuclear profiles similar to neurons of\nthe inner and outer nuclear layers.Nuclei polarized away from the center or \u201clumen\u201d of the rosette.Eosinophilic linear structures resembling photoreceptors inner segments\nand/or ciliated cells from primitive neuroepithelial origin may be observed\nin the inner layer of the rosette.Presence of a basement membrane-like structure near the center of the\nrosette resembling the external limiting membrane of the retina.RPE-like cells or macrophages may be in the center of the rosette.\n\n\nRetinal folds\n\n\nSee below.\n\n\nArtifact of processing:\n\n\nDifferential-rate fixation of the vitreous and retina can lead to vitreous\nshrinkage and retinal traction, creating artifact rosettes.\n\n\nRetinal rosettes are a focal or multifocal disorganization of the sensory retina\ndue to faulty development. In the rat rosettes appear as unilateral linear\nelevations of the retina on ophthalmic examination (Hubert, Gillet et al. 1994) and can be induced\nby the administration of cytosine arabinose, cycasin, N-methyl-N-nitrosurea and\ntrimethyltin (Schafer and\nRender 2013a). Retinal rosettes (and folds, see below) may not have all\nlayers of the retina intact, often show loss of the outer nuclear layer, and may\nhave direct abutment of the retina onto the choroid or even the sclera (Schafer and Render\n2013a).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nIncidental, spontaneous, or associated with traction from fibroblastic membranes\nat the retinal surface and subretinal hemorrhage.\n\n\nFocal inward projections of the retina with possible separation of the\nphotoreceptor from the retinal pigmented epithelium.Less severe lesions affect only the outer retinal layers and present as\nmicro-retinal detachment, with subretinal accumulation of phagocytic cells\nand do not affect the retinal surface contour.More severe folds affect all retinal layers, and can exhibit with\nsubretinal hemorrhage and debris from the photoreceptor outer segments.\n\n\nArtifact retinal fold:\n\n\u2022 Related to 70% ethanol fixation, and/or relative time differences in tissue\nfixation. True retinal folds are differentiated from artifact by an association\nwith preretinal traction membranes, sub-retinal deposits, hemorrhage, or\naggregates of RPE cells (Render,\nSchafer et al. 2013).\n\nSpontaneous retinal folds have been reported in mice and rats (Sprague-Dawley and\nWistar) (Hubert, Gillet et al.\n1994). Folds found in Sheffield-Wistar rats may be congenital and\nassociated with microphthalmia (Poulsom and Hayes 1988). Artifactual retinal folds (Lange\u2019s folds) have\nbeen described in the peripheral retina of young animals, and is associated with\ntissue fixation with 70% ethanol (Gartner and Henkind 1981). When retinal\nfolds are sectioned in a tangential histologic plane they might resemble\nrosettes.\n\nDecreased cell layers; retina; decreased thickness, retina.\n\nDegenerative process of the retina resulting in cell loss and collapse of the\nretinal layers; atrophy may be specific to the ganglion cell layer and/or inner\nnuclear layer, or outer retinal layer due to the susceptibility and sensitivity of\nthe cell populations in those areas to the inciting cause, or to both (global).\nGlobal atrophy can also be an end-stage lesion associated with secondary\ndegeneration of retinal cells that progresses from one cell layer to the next.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nAtrophy of the inner retina (inner nuclear, inner plexiform and ganglion cell\nlayers) may be secondary to increased intraocular pressure, compressive lesions of\nthe optic nerve, or direct toxicity resulting in degeneration of retinal cells and\neventual cell loss.\n\n\nDecreased numbers of ganglion cells.Thinning of the nerve fiber and inner plexiform layers.Loss of nuclei in the inner nuclear layer.\n\n\nThe most common causes of loss of ganglion cells and their axon fibers in the\nnerve fiber layer are 1) an increase intraocular pressure resulting in\ndegeneration of these cells, and subsequent atrophy of the optic nerve and\nsecondary atrophy of the inner nuclear layer, and 2) compressive lesions on the\nextraocular portion of the optic nerve leading to axonal degeneration and\nsubsequent ganglion cell death. The retinal ganglion cells are target of several\nknown retinal toxicants (e.g. carbon disulfide, doxorubicin, glutamate and\nlidocaine). A few toxicants, like ethylcholine mustard aziridinium ion (AF64A),\npreferentially target the cells in the inner nuclear layer (Ramos, Reilly et al. 2011).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nConditions resulting in atrophy of the outer retinal layers (outer plexiform and\nphotoreceptor layers) include hereditary or direct photoreceptor injury, and/or\nRPE toxicity. Atrophy may be incidental following choroidal circular disturbance\n(Tanaka, Inagaki et al.\n1993).\n\n\nDecreased numbers of nuclei in the outer nuclear layer, resulting in\ndecreased thickness of the retina.Decreased thickness or collapse of the outer plexiform layer with fusion of\nthe inner and outer nuclear layers.Loss of inner and outer segments of the photoreceptors.Displacement of photoreceptor nuclei to the inner and outer segment\nlayers.Hypertrophy of RPE cells, and possible migration of RPE cells and\nmacrophages into the sensory retina.\n\n\nOuter retinal atrophy or degeneration is a broad term that indicates loss of\nphotoreceptors from a variety of causes that include hereditary, aging, toxicity,\nphototoxicity, nutritional deficiencies, retinal detachment, and inflammation.\nPhotoreceptors have high metabolic demands, and thus are susceptible to toxins\nthat interfere with energy metabolism, e.g. nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase\n(NAMPT) inhibitors (Zabka, Singh et\nal. 2015). Genetic forms of atrophy occur in several strains of mice,\nincluding several mutant and transgenic mouse strains and rats. Ocular screening\nshould be conducted prior to study inclusion and animals exhibiting atrophy\nremoved, or equally distributed amongst dose groups. Photoreceptor degeneration\nmay occur with remarkable sparing of the inner retinal layers and RPE. Outer\nretinal atrophy in rodents is characteristic of senile retinal degeneration, which\nhas a tendency to begin at the peripheral retina (Hockwin, Green et al. 1992). Light-induced\nretinal atrophy/degeneration (usually RPE cells are not affected) occurs in albino\nrodents and is caused by prolonged exposure to light or exposure to high intensity\nlight. These lighting conditions may occur if animals are kept in cages on the top\nof racks close to the room light source (De Vera Mudry, Kronenberg et al. 2013).\nIn contrast, focal atrophy of outer retinal segments following choroidal circular\ndisturbance is always associated with loss of regional RPE cells (Tanaka, Inagaki et al.\n1993).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nScar; Glial scar; Diffuse gliosis.\n\nInvolvement of all cell layers; end stage retinal lesion regardless of the\ninitial cause.\n\n\nDecreased numbers of cells in all layers and associated collapse of the\nplexiform layers.Complete collapse of retinal architecture.Replacement of the retinal tissue by a fibrous layer with glial cells and\noccasional neurons.\n\n\nRetinal degeneration may occur as a spontaneous (hereditary, aging, exposure to\nlight, nutrient deficiency, inflammatory or trauma) or iatrogenic (e.g. laser\ntreatment, subretinal injection) finding and therefore must be differentiated from\ntreatment-related toxic effects (Schafer and Render 2013a).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nOuter retina; associated with trauma, intravitreal injections, chorioretinal\ninflammation, vitreal degeneration and traction resulting from fibroplasia at the\nretinal surface (retinal/epiretinal fibroplasia).\n\n\nSeparation of the photoreceptor outer segment from the retinal pigmented\nepithelium.Subretinal accumulation of fluid, macrophages, red blood cells and cellular\ndebris.Secondary hypertrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE\ntombstones).Degeneration/atrophy of the photoreceptor outer segments.\n\n\nArtifact retinal detachment\n\nArtifact retinal detachment can be differentiated from true retinal detachment by\nthe lack of subretinal deposits and absence of hypertrophy of the RPE cells.\nHypertrophy of the RPE needs to be distinguished from RPE \u201ctenting\u201d, an artifact\nthat result from traumatic shearing of the retina during tissue trimming. In\ncontrast to RPE hypertrophy, \u201ctented\u201d RPE cells have angular apices with fragments\nof photoreceptor outer segments still attached to the surface. Spontaneous retinal\ndetachment is uncommon in laboratory animals, but may occur rarely in B6C3F1 mice\nand Sprague-Dawley rats (Kuno, Usui\net al. 1991).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nPhotoreceptor displaced nuclei (PDN); subretinal photoreceptor cells;\ncolloquially known as \u201ctorpedo\u201d cells.\n\nPhotoreceptors of the outer nuclear layer; age-related degenerative process of\nthe photoreceptors.\n\n\nPhotoreceptor cell located external to the retinal outer limiting\nmembrane.Cell with scant or no cytoplasm.Nuclei morphology very similar to photoreceptor nuclei in the outer nuclear\nlayer; may also be pyknotic.\n\n\nMonocytes, (or macrophages):\n\n\nLarger cells with cytoplasm; may contain melanin or hemosiderin pigment,\nand may be associated with inflammation (Lai 1980).\n\n\nDetached retinal pigment epithelial cells:\n\n\nLarger cells with cytoplasm; may contain melanin pigment or other\ninclusions, and may be associated with detachment of the sensory retina\n(Lai 1980).\n\n\nArtifact\n\n\nDisplacement of photoreceptor nuclei during microtomy.\n\n\nDisplaced photoreceptor nuclei (PDN) occur in humans and laboratory animals\nincluding rats and mice. Both nonpyknotic and pyknotic nuclei may be found in\ncontrol eyes (Lai 1980; Lai, Masuda et al. 1982), but also\nin areas of retinal degeneration or inflammation, or both (Saunders and Rubin 1975b; Geiss and Yoshitomi 1999).\nDisplaced nuclei were observed in all strains of rats with a frequency of\napproximately 50% in normal retinas; they were observed more frequently in very\nyoung developing retinas and in aged retinas (Lai 1980).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nEpiretinal membrane; vitreal traction band\n\nMultiple cell origins have been implicated in fibroplasia at the retinal surface,\nincluding, hyalocytes, fibroblasts, astrocytes, glial cells, and M\u00fcller cells.\nCell transdifferntiation occurs as a sequela to disruptions of the vitreous body\nor internal limiting membrane, retinal or vitreal inflammation, neovascular\nretinal disease or intraocular surgery.\n\n\nA fibrocellular layer carpeting the inner (vitreal) surface of the\nretina.Cellular components may be multiple: fibrocytes, glial cells and retinal\npigment epithelial cells.Inflammatory cells can be present when associated with ocular or retinal\ninflammation.Small vascular profiles can be present when associated with retinal\nvascular proliferations (neovascularization).\n\n\n\nHistochemical stains for collagen (e.g. Masson\u2019s trichrome or Picrosirius\nred) can be useful to highlight the membranes.Immunohistochemistry for cell specific proteins can demonstrate the\ndifferent origins of cells present in the membranes. GFAP can be useful to\nhighlight the presence of glial cell component.\n\n\nPre-retinal arteriolar loop\n\nFibrosis (Figure 28)\n\n\nReplacement of the retina with fibrous connective tissue; usually observed\nas a reparative process following tissue injury and necrosis.\n\n\n\u2018Epiretinal membrane\u2019 is a clinical term for fibroplasia found at, or on the\nretinal surface. Idiopathic epiretinal membranes (iERM) are characterized by the\ngrowth of fibrocellular tissue on the internal limiting membrane (ILM). iERM can\nrange from subtle cellophane-like films without visual consequences to markedly\ncontractile membranes that can cause metamorphopsia and decreased visual acuity.\nThe complete pathogenesis of iERM is unknown, but many theories have been\nproposed. The most widely accepted theory is that iERM is a consequence of surface\nbreaks in the ILM of the retina and forms within the cortical vitreous, which\nserves as the structural component and provides a medium upon which glial cells\nand hyalocytes can proliferate. Impaired vision can result from retinal traction\nand detachment, or impediment of light transmission.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nGliosis.\n\nGlial cells; proliferation or migration of glial cells may occur in response to\ninjury or insult, or be incidental.\n\n\nLocalized to the retina around the optic nerve head in incidental lesions.\nMay occur elsewhere associated with retinal injury.Expanded nerve fiber layer containing cells with elongated nuclei,\nfibrillar eosinophilic cytoplasm and indistinct membranes.\n\n\nThe cells are immunohistochemically positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein\n(GFAP).\n\nRetinal gliosis is seen in rats as a focal lesion localized in the peripapillary\nretina (Adams, Auerbach et al.\n2011). For diffuse retinal gliosis, refer to Atrophy/degeneration,\nGlobal.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nMost often lymphoid, but may be myeloid. The pathogenesis is uncertain, but\npresumably a self-limiting response designed for immune surveillance and minor\ntissue repair activities. Lymphocyte infiltrates are often observed with\nimmunological responses to delivery of foreign antigens (monoclonal antibodies) to\nthe intraocular space.\n\n\nFoci of lymphocytes and rare plasma cells surrounding retinal capillaries\nwithin the perivascular space, without other features of inflammation.\n\n\nInflammation:\n\n\nInflammatory cellular infiltrate associated with edema, congestion,\nhemorrhage, necrosis and increased numbers of glial cells (gliosis) of the\nretinal tissue.\n\n\nThe term \u201cinfiltrate\u201d is recommended followed by the predominant cell type\n(neutrophilic, eosinophilic, lymphocytic, plasmacytic or histiocytic) or mixture\nof different cell types (mixed). The most predominantly and frequently observed\ninflammatory cell infiltrate in the retina is lymphocytic. Small focal to\nmultifocal lymphocytic infiltrates are thought to be incidental background\nfindings.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nRetinitis.\n\nInflammation can occur in any cell layer. Inflammation may occur from\nimmune-mediated etiologies, infectious agents, trauma, be drug-induced, or\nexperimentally induced.\n\n\nInflammatory cellular infiltrate associated with edema, congestion,\nhemorrhage and necrosis.Evolves to retinal degeneration and glial cell proliferation (gliosis).Can be associated with inflammation of the choroid, focal retinal\ndetachment, and loss of photoreceptors.\n\n\nInfiltrate, inflammatory cell\n\nSpontaneous retinal inflammation is rare in the mouse and rat, but can be seen\nunilaterally secondary to trauma. Retinal inflammation usually occurs secondary to\ninflammation of the choroid and results in retinal degeneration (Schafer and Render 2013a).\nVirally induced retinitis and immune-mediated retinitis are well-known disease\nmodels in mice (Geiss and\nYoshitomi 1999).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nCalcification.\n\nCan occur in any cell layer. Mineralization in the retina is presumed to be\nassociated with a primary vascular wall lesion or be secondary to dystrophic\nevents in necrotic areas (see Mineralization, Vitreous, above).\n\n\nVariably sized, often irregular, purple/blue foci in H&E- stained\nretinal sections.Vascular walls are usually involved.Laminated appearance (alternating dark and light zones) is typical.\n\n\nVon Kossa stain for calcium may be useful in paraffin sections, though the\nchelation chemistry (silver nitrate) is not specific for calcium salts; Alizarin\nred S may also be used. Nonacidic fixatives such as neutral buffered 10% formalin\nor alcohol are best for tissues containing calcium deposits (Bancroft and Gamble 2002).\n\nDeposits, subretina (drusen; associated with RPE).\n\nBone metaplasia\n\nMineralization can be an incidental lesion.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nHypertrophy, myelin.\n\nGanglion cells; developmental anomaly that is generally incidental.\n\n\nPresence of myelinated axons in the nerve fiber layer at the central\n(peri-papillary) retina.Myelinated axons form small clusters at the retinal surface, and can cause\nfocal thickening of the retina.\n\n\nLFB will stain myelin blue to green and may be useful for diagnosis.\n\nMyelinated retinal nerve fibers have been seen more frequently in pigmented rats\nand had been described in Long- Evans and BW rats (Rubin 1986; Hubert, Gillet et al. 1994). It is suggested to\nrepresent a developmental rather than a congenital anomaly (Rubin 1986).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nHomogenizing cell change; ischemic cell change; metabolic arrest change; oncotic\nnecrosis; colloquially known as \u201cred dead\u201d neurons.\n\nGanglion cell bodies, secondary retinal neurons or photoreceptor cells; recent\ncell death, typically affecting multiple retinal neurons.\n\n\nShrunken, often angular ganglion cells with hypereosinophilic cytoplasm in\nH&E-stained paraffin sections.Nuclear consolidation, sometimes with shrinkage (early stages).Karyorrhexis or karyolysis (later stages).May see swollen cells, cytoplasmic vacuoles, or cytoplasmic blebs.Necrosis: focal, multifocal or focally extensive regions of the retina\ncontaining necrotic cells and cell debris.\n\n\nNecrotic neurons are specifically labeled by:\n\n\nFluorescent stains (e.g., Fluoro-Jade B or Fluoro- Jade C) (Schmued, Stowers et al.\n2005) performed on 5- to 10-\u00b5m-thick (i.e., routine)\nperfusion-fixed, paraffin embedded sections. Affected cells appear bright\ngreen against a dark field. (Note: erythrocytes that remain in blood vessels\nof immersion-fixed specimens will autofluoresce, which may make detection of\nnecrotic neurons more difficult.).Cupric\u2013silver stains (Switzer\n2000) in 30- to 40- mm-thick frozen sections of unfixed tissue.\nAffected cells are black against a pale-yellow background.Electron microscopy: condensed, swollen or ruptured mitochondria; swollen\nor ruptured lysosomes; disruption of cell membranes.\n\n\nDark neuron artifact:\n\n\nEvident as spiky basophilic neurons due to shrinkage of both nucleus and\ncytoplasm with contracture of the neuronal cell body; often associated with\na prominent, tortuous, basophilic apical dendrite.\n\n\nNeuronal necrosis is a common end-stage cellular response to irreversible injury.\nIt may be induced by many causes, but the most common are metabolic dysfunction,\nischemia, or toxicant exposure (chemicals, drugs, or metals). The intracellular\nbiochemical alterations that ultimately lead to neuron destruction can be\ntriggered by many different mechanisms, but neuronal necrosis in the retina refers\nto the pathway by which disruption of cellular energy systems results in fluid\naccumulation within organelles (microvacuolation) and eventually the entire soma\n(swelling, or oncosis) rather than the apoptotic cascade. (McMartin, O\u2019Donoghue et al. 1997). Necrosis is\ngenerally associated with inflammation, but can occasionally precede inflammation\nsuch as occurs with a vascular injury (e.g. coagulative necrosis), chronic\nhypoxia, or cytotoxic cell death.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nLipofuscinosis.\n\nLipofuscin represents residual bodies derived from autophagosomal lysosomes and\nis composed of polymers of lipid and phospholipid complexed with protein.\nLipofuscin accumulates with age in retinal neurons, and is associated with free\nradical damage.\n\n\nPresence of brown pigment granules in neuronal cytoplasm, most evident in\nganglion cells, generally of medium-to-large-sized cells.The color of pigment granules varies from faint yellow to dark brown; some\nare eosinophilic (ceroid).\n\n\n\nLipofuscin granules may be detected using several special stains: pink\nusing PAS, pale red to red by Oil Red O, dark blue to purple by LFB, and\npale blue to blue by Schmorl\u2019s technique for melanin; they are also acid\nfast by Ziehl-Neelsen.Lapham\u2019s method (Lapham,\nJohnstone et al. 1964) is highly specific for neural\nlipofuscin.Autofluorescence can be identified in H&E or unstained slides using a\nfluorescent microscope.\n\n\nLipofuscin should not form part of the diagnostic term in the absence of a\nconfirmatory stain, although it may be mentioned in discussion. Lipofuscin\naccumulation results from age-related reductions in the efficiency with which\nneural cells eliminate degradation by-products (Kreutzberg, Blakemore, and Graeber 1997).\nLipofuscin arises in the cell bodies of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes\nby lipid peroxidation in cell membranes. Lipofuscin seems to accumulate without\ndeleterious effects to the retinal neural cells.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nRetinal neurons and M\u00fcller cells. Vacuolation occurs from either a degenerative\nor toxic process leading to retention of fluid or metabolic byproducts inside a\nsubcellular compartment, and expansion of intraneuronal cytoplasm or\nmembrane-bound organelles.\n\n\nCytoplasmic vacuolation (usually clear or pale eosinophilic) of ganglion\ncells, photoreceptors segments or M\u00fcller cells.\n\n\nNeuronal vacuoles in some storage diseases or in induced phospholipidosis may be\nconfirmed by electron microscopy or by using special stains (e.g., Luxol fast blue\n[LFB], periodic acid-Schiff [PAS], or Sudan black) to detect a specific\nbiochemical component within vacuoles.\n\nVacuolation of retinal neuropil (extracellular edema)\n\nVacuolation artifact due to postmortem autolysis:\n\n\nImproper collection, handling, or fixation of the globe at the time of\nnecropsy; or prolonged immersion (e.g., over the weekend) in ethanol baths\nduring tissue dehydration. Artifactual vacuolation should not be recorded in\nthe pathology findings data set.\n\n\nHexachlorophene causes vacuolation and degeneration of photoreceptor outer\nsegments, and chloroquine causes vacuolation in neurons and M\u00fcller cells.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nRetinal edema, retinoschisis.\n\nInvolvement of any retinal layer, often multiple.

Depending on size and distribution, either no clinical signs\nor extension into the subretinal space leading to retinal detachment and\nblindness.\n\n\nDistribution of hemorrhage is usually focal to multifocal but can be\nextensive when caused by traumatic events.Retinal hemorrhage often happens in close proximity to the capillaries.Chronic lesions may be associated with hemosiderosis.\n\n\nSpecial stains for iron accumulation (e.g. Prussian blue and Perl\u2019s iron stain)\ncan be used to identify hemosiderin in old sites of hemorrhage.\n\nRetinal infarcts\n\nRetinal hemorrhages can occur in a variety of primary clotting disorders,\nthrombocytopenia of any cause, retinal hypertension, inflammatory retinal\nconditions, ocular trauma, or from compression to the animal during handling.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nChoroidal neovascularization (CNV).\n\nNew vessel growth from pre-existing vasculature, secondary to an ischemic\nprocess, and/or release of proangiogenic factors (i.e. VEGF).\n\n\nGrowth of new blood vessels that originate from the choroid through a break\nin Bruch\u2019s membrane into the space below the retinal pigment epithelium\n(sub-RPE) or into the subretinal space (between the photoreceptors and\nRPE).Newly formed blood vessels may infiltrate the retina.Subretinal, retinal, and vitreal hemorrhages can occur.Retinal detachment associated with subretinal hemorrhage.\n\n\nChoroidal and retinal vascular changes are evaluated clinically by vascular\nangiography; microscopically, via immunohistochemistry or in situ-hybridization\nfor angiogenic and endothelial cell markers (e.g., vascular endothelial growth\nfactor); by microscopic examination of retinal whole mounts, and by transmission\nelectron microscopy.\n\nRetinal neovascularization:\n\n\nRetinal neovascularization is differentiated from CNV by vascular profiles\nthat extend from the IPL and INL into the outer retinal layers, or from the\nIPL and ganglion cell layers into the inner limiting membrane, or by\nvascular tufts that project into the vitreous. Neovascular profiles can also\ncontact the RPE cells and colonize the subretinal space similar to CNV. The\nmain differential diagnostic feature is the presence of an intact Bruch\u2019s\nmembrane in retinal neovascularization, suggesting retinal origin of the\nvessels. Transmission electron microscopy might be necessary to confirm the\nstatus of Bruch\u2019s membrane.\n\n\nNeovascularization is spontaneous in the mutant mouse strain JR5558, which\nexhibits early, reproducible and spontaneous bilateral CNV, accompanied by\nsubsequent retinal anastomosis. In this model, chorioretinal parainflammation is\npresent prior to frank CNV, and is associated with upregulation of VEGF,\nhyperpermeability of the choriocapillaris, and neuroglial cell loss/dysfunction\n(Nagai, Izumi-Nagai et al.\n2011). CNV may also be induced experimentally, e.g. via laser\nphotocoagulation.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNew blood vessels, retina\n\n\nIntra-retinal neovascularizationRetinal vascularization proliferation\n\n\nSecondary to ischemic retinal process, intravitreal release of pro-angiogenic\nfactors (i.e. VEGF), and chronic retinal degeneration.\n\n\nPresence of vascular profiles extending from the IPL and INL into the outer\nretinal layers.Presence of vascular profiles extending from the IPL and ganglion cell\nlayers into the inner limiting membrane and projecting vascular tufts into\nthe vitreous.Neovascular profiles can contact the RPE cells and colonize the subretinal\nspace.Subretinal, retinal and vitreal hemorrhages can occur.Subretinal hemorrhage can cause retinal detachment.\n\n\nRetinal vascular changes are evaluated clinically by vascular angiography and\nmicroscopically by trypsin digestion of retinal whole mounts, immunohistochemistry\nfor endothelial cell markers (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor) and\ntransmission electron microscopy.\n\nChoroidal neovascularization:\n\n\nVessels extending from the choroid can breach Bruch\u2019s membrane and\ninfiltrate the retina. The main differential diagnostic feature is the\npresence of an intact Bruch\u2019s membrane, suggesting retinal origin of the\nvessels. TEM might be necessary to confirm the status of Bruch\u2019s\nmembrane.\n\n\nRetinal neovascular proliferation can be a feature of endstage retinal\ndegeneration. Retinal neovascularization has been described as a feature of\nchronic light induced retinopathy in albino rats (Albert, Neekhra et al. 2010). Vitreal or\nsubretinal hemorrhage due to retinal neovascularization can also lead to\nsubretinal or retinal surface fibroplasia, forming membranes.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nOptic atrophy; optic neuropathy (ischemic).\n\nGanglion cell axon; common response to many types of injuries including primary\naxonal injury, ganglion cell loss, optic neuritis, or hypoxia/ischemia.\n\n\nMarked loss of axons with relative increase in the prominence of the\nremaining pial trabeculae (thin bands of collagen arising from the pia mater\nthat surround the axons).Glial proliferation (see gliosis).Decrease of optic nerve diameter can be observed in cross sections.Posterior bowing of the optic nerve head and lamina cribrosa (cupping of\nthe optic nerve) can be present if atrophy is associated with chronically\nincreased intraocular pressure.\n\n\nMasson\u2019s trichrome stain can be used to highlight the collagenous tissue of the\npial trabeculae. Luxol fast blue stains myelin blue, and can be used to\ndemonstrate myelin loss in demyelinating injuries.\n\nFibrosis of the optic nerve\n\nSpecies differences in the structure of the lamina cribrosa are important when\ninterpreting the extent of atrophy near the site where the optic nerve passes\nthrough the sclera. Mice have a less robust lamina cribrosa when compared to rats\nso the accentuation of the collagenous tissue in optic nerve atrophy is less\nevident (Smith, John, and Nishina\n2002). Because optic nerve atrophy is a chronic, irreversible response,\nit is important to determine the progenitor lesions in toxicological studies\n(Ramos, Reilly et al.\n2011).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nAxonopathy; dying-back axonopathy; nerve fiber degeneration; Wallerian-type\ndegeneration.\n\nAxonal degeneration occurs in several circumstances in the optic nerve. Loss of\nganglion cells, and consequently their axons, secondary to glaucoma is likely the\nmost common cause (Teixeira and Dubielzig 2013a). Lesions in the orbital or intracranial\nportions of the optic nerve can cause Wallerian degeneration with consequent axon\nloss and ganglion cell death. Causes for these lesions include trauma leading to\noptic nerve crush, severance, or avulsion, and compression caused by tumors,\nperiosteal proliferation at the optic foramen (where the nerve enters the\ncalvarium), or granulomatous inflammation (Smith, John, and Nishina 2002).\n\n\nMultiple, swollen eosinophilic axons (spheroids) with unaffected myelin\nsheaths in the early stage (McMartin, O\u2019Donoghue et al. 1997).Axonal fragmentation with the formation of digestion chambers containing\nphagocytic macrophages (gitter cells) and central axonal fragments are\ncharacteristics of the late state lesion.Lesion progresses to optic nerve atrophy (see above).\n\n\nDetailed evaluation of optic nerve axonal degeneration and axonal loss can be\nobtained by transmission electron microscopy of optic nerve cross sections (Reynaud, Cull et al. 2012).\nFaster methods use plastic- or resin-embedded, p-phenylenediamine (PPD) or\nToluidine blue-stained optic nerve cross sections, light microscopy and\ncomputational image analysis to quantify axon loss (Ebneter, Casson et al. 2012).\n\nOptic neuritis\n\nAtrophy\n\nAxonal degeneration associated with ageing has been reported in Sprague-Dawley\nrats and DBA/2J and AKXD- 28/Ty mice (Anderson, Smith et al. 2001; Cavallotti, Cavallotti et al.\n2001).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nMyelinolysis; myelinopathy.\n\nOligodendroglial cell processes.

The most predominantly and frequently observed\ninflammatory cell infiltrate in the optic nerve is lymphocytic. Small, focal to\nmultifocal aggregates of lymphocyte infiltrates are thought to be incidental\nbackground findings.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nOptic neuritis; optic nerve neuritis.\n\nLeukocytes of any lineage associated with an inflammatory response.\n\n\nLeukocyte infiltration within the optic nerve or optic disc with other\nfeatures of inflammation.Inflammatory features such as edema, congestion, hemorrhage, necrosis and\nincreased numbers of glial cells (gliosis) are also present.\n\n\nInfiltrate, inflammatory cell:\n\n\nSee above.\n\n\nInflammation is the preferred diagnostic term when inflammatory features are\npresent, with the appropriate modifiers used to identify the predominant cell\ntype. Immune-mediated inflammation that is predominantly lymphocytic may be\nobserved in the optic nerve and nerve head following the ocular administration of\nbiologics that are recognized as foreign proteins by the immune system. Optic\nneuritis is a clinical term designating a swollen optic nerve disc from any cause\nwhen viewed on ophthalmoscopy and should not be used as a histological\ndiagnosis.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nMyelin splitting; axon swelling; myelin edema; Wallerian degeneration.\n\nSeparation of myelin sheaths surrounding axons, or cytoplasmic swelling of glial\ncells.\n\n\nClear spaces within the optic nerve.Irregular enlargement of axons observed in longitudinal sections.\n\n\nMyelin defects may be demonstrated using Luxol blue staining.\n\nFixation artifact\n\nDemyelination\n\nDegenerative changes in myelin can occur spontaneously with aging or result from\ntrauma, toxicity, or inflammatory conditions.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nDecreased numbers of RPE cells; RPE cell loss.\n\nRPE cell loss often occurs as a generalized aging process that leads to cell\ndegeneration and eventual cell death.\n\n\nRegions that exhibit reduced RPE cell count, or areas of Bruch\u2019s membrane\nthat may be devoid of overlying RPE.Remaining cells may be attenuated, spreading laterally to compensate for\nany spatial defects in an attempt to maintain the blood-retinal barrier\n(BRB) and homeostasis.Remaining RPE tend to have features of degeneration (cell enlargement and\nirregular pigmentation).\n\n\nChronic atrophy of RPE is associated with degeneration and atrophy of the\nadjacent retina. Because the BRB has been breached, there may be associated\nsubretinal edema and inflammation, or subretinal fibroplasia (formation of\nsubretinal membranes).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nDrusen; drusen-like deposits\n\nImpaired function of the RPE associated with the metabolism of photoreceptor\nouter segments.\n\n\nExtracellular deposits of irregular, amorphous material located between RPE\nand Bruch\u2019s membrane (Pow and\nDiaz 2008).Often associated with enlarged and/or degenerating RPE containing numerous,\nprominent pigmented granules.May be associated with loss of RPE polarity, RPE and retinal detachment,\nand/or subretinal or retinal edema.\n\n\nRPE degeneration or necrosis\n\nDrusen are extracellular deposits composed primarily of apolipoproteins derived\nfrom RPE metabolism of the outer segments of photoreceptors, and from members of\nthe compliment system (particularly factor H) derived from plasma (Hageman, Luthert et al. 2001).\nDrusen contain zinc, which is thought to have a role in the precipitation and\nactivation of the complement system (Lengyel, Flinn et al. 2007). These amorphous\ndeposits may accumulate due to impaired transport of the debris through Bruch\u2019s\nmembrane into the choroidal circulation. Drusen is a clinical diagnosis that\ncharacterizes these findings, and should be avoided as a histological diagnosis.\nDrusen are associated with age-related macular degeneration, and thus are rarely\nobserved in species other than primates. However, \u2018hard\u2019 drusen (concentric,\nnodular mass, with well-defined borders; may be mineralized) do occur infrequently\nin some species other than humans.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nSubretinal membranes; subretinal fibrosis; fibrous metaplasia; RPE migration.\n\nMigration, proliferation, and transdifferentiation of RPE in response to injury,\nand increased production of resident growth factors and cytokines such as TGF\u03b2.\nIndividual RPE cells become fusiform, reminiscent of fibroblasts or\nmyofibroblasts, proliferate, and migrate.\n\n\nLinear arrays of fibroblastic-like cells arranged in a membranous mat\nbetween the retina and Bruch\u2019s membrane.Cellular component may be derived from multiple lineages: fibroblasts,\nhyalocytes, glial cells, M\u00fcller cells, and RPE.Inflammatory cells are present when there is associated inflammation.Small vascular profiles can be present spontaneously, or induced\n(neovascularization) as in laser models.Contraction of membranes can cause buckling of the adjacent retina, and\nresult in retinal detachments.\n\n\n\nHistochemical stains for collagen (e.g. Masson\u2019s trichome or Picrosirius\nred) can be useful to highlight membranes.Immunohistochemistry for GFAP or RPE65 can be used to demonstrate the\npresence of glial cells and RPE, respectively in the membranes.\n\n\nChoroidal Neovascularization\n\n\nSee retinal neovascularization, below.\n\n\n\u201cSubretinal membranes\u201d is a clinical term for fibroplasia occurring in the\nsubretinal space, and in humans they tend to be associated with neovascularization\nin age-related macular degeneration (AMD). They are rare in non-primate species,\nbut can be experimentally induced using lasers. Membranes may be secondary to\nsubretinal hemorrhage, retinal or choroidal inflammation, neovascular retinal or\nchoroidal disease, or intraocular surgery. Osseous metaplasia (RPE metaplasia to\nan osseous phenotype) is a variation and is not well understood (Toyran, Lin et al. 2005).\nSubretinal membranes can be the cause of retinal detachment or develop secondary\nto retinal detachment, especially in cases of subretinal hemorrhage. More\nextensive subretinal fibroplasia that infiltrates and partially replaces the\nretina (retinal fibrosis) is usually secondary to traumatic inuury, such as\nscleral rupture.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nEnlarged RPE; increased size, RPE.\n\nRPE enlargement occurs with cellular disease, toxicity, or aging processes due to\nincrease in size and number of organelles, enlargement of smooth endoplasmic\nreticulum (increased activity), or accumulation of lipofuscin. Occasional random\ncells may be enlarged without apparent reason.\n\n\nRPE cells are larger than typical on light microscopy and may have unusual\npigmentation.Melanin may be reduced or irregularly distributed within the cell, or may\nfuse with lipofuscin to form conjugates with different pigmentation that\nappears granular.On electron microscopy, enlargement of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and\nincreased numbers of lysosomes or lipofuscin granules may be observed.\n\n\nHypertrophy is often associated with detachment of the retina or photoreceptor\ndeath, and may progress to RPE detachment, transdifferentiation, and migration.\nDruginduced hypertrophy often presents as uniformly enlarged RPE that are closely\napposed to the retina. In some cases, such as with some \u03b2-secretase inhibitors,\nhypertrophied RPE will autofluoresce (Fielden et al 2015).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nRPE degeneration; vacuolation; lysosomes; lipofuscin or lipofuscinosis; retinal\nlipidosis (Ivanina, Zueva et al.\n1983); myeloid bodies (Per\u00e4salo, Rechardt et al. 1974); residual bodies (DAmico et al. 1984).\n\nRPE impaired degradation of shed photoreceptor outer segments is associated with\naging processes, but may also occur with enzyme deficiency of some genetic\ndiseases, or with toxicity, such as chloroquine (Ivanina, Zueva et al. 1983) or cationic\namphiphilic compounds (DAmico et\nal. 1984).\n\n\nRPE cells are generally enlarged on light microscopy, and have increased\nnumbers of pigmented granules.RPE may have loss of polarity, and be detached from Bruch\u2019s membrane.Abnormal organelles containing concentric membranous whorls can be found in\nthe RPE cytoplasm on electron microscopy (Gregory, Rutty et al. 1970; Matsumura, Yamakawa et al.\n1986; Gaafar,\nAbdel-Khalek et al. 1995); membranes may have lamellated\n(fingerprint-like) appearance reminiscent of the outer segments of\nphotoreceptors, and are osmophilic due to the phospholipid content of the\nmembranes (Per\u00e4salo,\nRechardt, and Palkama 1974). \n\n\nLysosomes:\n\n\nLysosomes containing lipofuscin appear auto-fluorescent on fundic\nexamination, and should be differentiated from drusen (sub-RPE, or Bruch\u2019s\nmembrane deposits) that also contain lipofuscin or other autofluorescent\npigments.\n\n\nVacuolation may also be associated with abnormal accumulation of lipofuscin or\nother pigments that are metabolic by-products of RPE processing of shed\nphotoreceptor outer segments. Lipofuscin, and lipofuscin conjugates (i.e.\nmelanolipofuscin) often accumulate in the base of the RPE cytoplasm as granules.\nThese are best observed on fundic examination, and appear as autofluorescent\nparticles. Lipofuscin may not survive routine tissue processing and thus may not\nbe observed on brightfield light microscopy unless associated with other\norganelles or proteins. Instead, clear vacuoles generally remain, representing the\npresence of cellular accumulations. Lipofuscin accumulates spontaneously with age,\ndue to impaired ability to properly remove the granules from the cell, and may\nalso occur with toxicities (Brown\n1974; Hughes and\nCoogan 1974; Fox and Chu\n1988; Butler, Ford, and\nNewberne 1987). Occasionally, cytoplasmic crystals may be observed (Caine et al. 1975).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone.\n\nRPE cell death can be induced by any number of causes.\n\nRPE are subject to light-induced oxidative injury, in addition to chronic\noxidative stress related to their metabolic role in photoreceptor maintenance.\n\n\nLoss of cell morphology; granular cell debris in absence of RPE, extending\ninto the subretinal space.Pyknotic or absent nuclei.Retinal detachment; subretinal edema may occur in locations of necrosis,\ndue to loss of blood-retinal barrier.\n\n\nRPE degeneration and necrosis can occur spontaneously associated with the\naccumulation of lipofuscin, vitamin A dimers, and other by-products of the visual\ncycle that promote free-radical injury. RPE impairment is thought to have a\ncritical role in age-related degeneration of the retina. The RPE contribution to\nthe blood-retinal barrier and transport mechanisms between the vasculature and\nretina render them vulnerable to toxicities from systemically administered\ncompounds (iodates, L-Ornithine hydrochloride, naphthalene). Free-radical damage\ncan be enhanced through melanin binding, such as occurs with heavy metals and\namines. In addition, RPE degeneration and subsequent necrosis can occur secondary\nto photoreceptor injury.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nHypopigmentation; depigmentation; pigmentary incontinence.\n\nReduced pigmentation (reduced numbers of pigment granules) within RPE. Only\nrelevant in pigmented species or strains.\n\n\nThe number of melanin granules within individual RPE is reduced; RPE are\nnot uniformly affected, but more commonly involve regional or focal\nchanges.Melanosomes may assume uncharacteristic shape or size.Cytoplasmic distribution of melanin granules may be altered.\n\n\nLoss of RPE melanin occurs spontaneously as an age-related change. It may also be\nassociated with some toxicities that result in melanin binding, including some\nmetals and amines (Boulton 1988).\nMelanin may also be taken up by lysosomes and/or fuse with lipofuscin, resulting\nin apparent diffusion of pigment. Photobleaching of melanosomes also results in\ndiminished pigmentation, although the granules are still present.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nHyperpigmentation; increased numbers of pigment granules.\n\nMelanin gradually decreases as an age-related change. However, lipofuscin\naccumulates with age, and can fuse with melanin, resulting in the presence of\nincreased numbers of brown, pigmented granules. Lipofuscin is derived from the\nmetabolism of the outer segments shed from photoreceptors (see above), and\nconsists of lipids and fluorescent compounds that impart a yellow-brown\nauto-fluorescence characteristic to the granules.\n\n\nIncreased numbers of intracytoplasmic granules that are light brown on\nlight microscopy.Pigment may be autofluorescent if lipofuscin remains following\nprocessing.Cytoplasmic granules may be increased in size and exhibit abnormal\ndistribution throughout the cell.\n\n\nLipofuscin is best visualized on fundic imaging, as it is frequently lost during\ntissue processing.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nDedifferentiation; detachment/disorganization/degeneration, RPE.\n\nIn response to cell injury or degeneration (see above), RPE cells lose\nattachments to adjacent cells and to Bruch\u2019s membrane.\n\n\nRPE cells are individualized or form aggregates that are separated from\nBruch\u2019s membrane, residing in the sub-retinal space.RPE cells assume a round to polygonal shape; apical microvilli and basal\ninfoldings are lacking.On electron microscopy, there may be decreased phagosomes observed, but\nmore often, if associated with degeneration, there are numerous lysosomes\ncontaining membranes, lipofuscin or melanolipofuscin granules, and decreased\nor irregular shaped melanosomes.Retinal detachment is associated, and eventual retinal atrophy occurs.\n\n\nLoss of polarity is associated with loss of integrity of the BRB and retinal\nhomeostasis. Thus, there may be subretinal fluid, retinal edema, and in chronic\ncases, retinal degeneration and/or atrophy. Loss of polarity is associated with\ncell migration, however, as this is a primary degenerative process, cellular\ntransdifferentiation does not occur, and subretinal fibroplasia is not a\nsequela.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nStaphyloma.\n\nDecrease in the amount of scleral connective tissue resulting in sclera thinning;\ncan occur secondary to globe enlargement (inflammation or glaucoma) resulting in\nstretching of the sclera.\n\n\nThe sclera is focally or diffusely thinned.Connective tissue may have a sclerotic appearance.\n\n\nAtrophy of the sclera usually occurs secondary to other changes such as\nenlargement of the eye due to glaucoma or tumor formation, or as a sequela to\ninflammation. Atrophy can also occur as a degenerative age-related change.\nStaphyloma is a clinical term, and consists of a break in the sclera with prolapse\nof intraocular tissues.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nGenerally limited to lymphocytes.\n\n\nLoose or scattered infiltrates within the sclera wall, generally oriented\nin perivascular spaces.\n\n\nOccasionally mononuclear cell infiltrates may be observed in the connective\ntissue surrounding the globe, and extending into the sclera.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nScleritis; scleral inflammation.\n\nDepending on the inciting cause, inflammation may be composed of mixed\ninflammatory cells with neutrophils predominating, mononuclear to histiocytic\ncells, or granulomatous.\n\n\nInfiltrates of inflammatory cells are oriented in the perivascular spaces\nof vessels that penetrate the sclera.Edema, congestion, necrosis and cell debris are associated findings.\n\n\nScleral inflammation does not occur independently, but occurs with inflammation\nin neighboring areas of the eye. The only known exception is that of toxicity\nassociated with exposure to bisphosphonates which produces scleritis in human\npatients after intravenous administration. Scleritis may also occur as a\nmanifestation of systemic connective tissue disease (French and Margo 2008). Due to a lack of a\nprimary blood supply, inflammation is slow to resolve and may culminate in\nnecrosis.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nOsseous metaplasia; cartilaginous metaplasia, transdifferentiation.\n\nSpontaneous formation of bone or cartilage in the sclera.\n\n\nFocal or multifocal plaques of immature woven bone or foci of cartilage\noccurring within the sclera.\n\n\nOsteoma; Chondroma;\n\nMineralization (see Figure 26)\n\nOsseous metaplasia is a common alteration in aging F344 rats, although\ncartilaginous metaplasia is rarely observed (Yoshitomi and Boorman 1990). Bone or\ncartilage formation can also occur secondary to trauma.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nChoriostomatous tissue (normal tissue in abnormal location), presumably arising\nfrom an ectodermal anlage.\n\n\nGrossly, lesion appears as an elevated white plaque with numerous fine\nhairs.Lesions contain components of skin such as hair follicles, sebaceous glands\nand fibrous connective tissue beneath a stratified squamous epithelium which\ncovers the lesion.\n\n\nEpithelial cyst:\n\n\nLined by stratified squamous epithelium with an innermost layer of\nkeratinizing cells; dermal appendages are not observed in the wall.\n\n\nOcular dermoid is a rare lesion of the cornea and/or conjunctiva of the rat. This\nlesion is not considered to be a neoplasm.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nEndothelialization, associated with production of Descemet\u2019s membrane.\n\nAbnormal proliferation and migration of corneal endothelial cells over the\ntrabecular meshwork and iris. Compensatory endothelial cell hypertrophy can be\nobserved with endothelial cell loss in attempts to cover spatial defects,\nparticularly in species where hyperplasia is not known to occur.\n\n\nSpindle-shaped cells covering the iridocorneal drainage angle and/or anterior\nsurface of the iris.Associated with production of thickened Descemet\u2019s membrane-like\nmaterial.Enlarged cells, often observed on the peripheral margins of the\nendothelium.\n\n\nIn rodents, the corneal endothelium has regenerative capacity throughout life,\nusually in response to injury. Endothelial cell hypertrophy associated with\nage-related cellular loss is observed in many species, including mouse and rat.\nEndothelialization is reported to occur in DBA/2J and AKXD-28/Ty mice (Smith, Sundberg, and John\n2002a).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nEpithelial cells of the cornea, conjunctiva (bulbar and palpebral), or lacrimal\nduct.\n\n\nIncreased cell layers of squamous epithelium with exophytic and/or endophytic\n(rete-peg-like) growth pattern.Often associated with epithelial hyperkeratosis.Underlying stroma often infiltrated by inflammatory cells (especially in case\nof reactive hyperplasia).\n\n\nPapilloma, squamous cell:\n\n\nCharacterized by exophytic growth and composed of fronds of squamous\nepithelium covering a fibrovascular core. Epithelium is retained by a basement\nmembrane.\n\n\nCarcinoma, squamous cell:\n\n\nMalignant neoplasm exhibiting invasion of the underlying stroma, cellular\natypia and dysplasia, as well as dyskeratosis, formation of epithelial keratin\n\u2018pearls\u2019 and mitotic activity.\n\n\nSpontaneous corneal and/or conjunctival epithelial hyperplasias are rare lesions.\nReactive hyperplasia is more common, resulting from many causes, including topically\napplied chemical and physical irritants; systemically administered toxins; reduced\ntear production; bacterial, viral, or fungal infections; nutritional deficiencies;\nheritable defects; and exophthalmos due to space-occupying orbital masses. In these\ncases, stromal inflammation, neovascularization, and/or fibrosis are often\nconcurrently present.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nMigration, TM cell; activation, TM cell.\n\nUniversal response of TM cells regardless of the injury or irritating stimuli, e.g.\nlaser photocoagulation, phagocytic particle insult, or noxious agents. TM cell\nactivation has been associated with a heightened metabolic state needed for the\nphagocytosis of debris entering the meshwork (Ramos, Attar et al. 2017).\n\n\nIncreased numbers of trabecular shaped cells in the filtration angle and\noverlying the TM.TM cells may be linearly arrayed in multiple, irregular layers overlying the\ntrabeculae.\n\n\nMononuclear cell infiltrate:\n\n\u2022 Mononuclear leukocytes can be found within the filtration angle.\n\nTM response to injury is limited. If adequate scaffolding remains following minimal\ndamage (transient elevation in intraocular pressure, mild laser beam application),\nTM cell migration and proliferation, and reorganization of the trabeculae are\npossible. Activated TM cells may form distinct spindle shapes expressing \u03b1-SMA,\nsynthesize new basement membrane and other collagens, and become phagocytotic (Rohen and van der Zypen\n1968; L\u00fctjen-Drecoll\n1972; Grierson, Unger et\nal. 2000).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nOcular melanosis.\n\nNeuroectodermal origin, from uveal melanocytes.\n\n\nAggregates of polygonal melanocytes filled with pigment.Minimal or no cellular atypia.Minimal displacement of normal structures.\n\n\nMelanocyte hyperplasia has been reported in the rat (Ackermann et al. 1998).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nAnterior lenticular epithelium.\n\n\nProliferation of the epithelium (normally a single layer) to form focal or\nmultifocal nodules or aggregates of epithelial cells under the anterior lens\ncapsule.Possible migration and proliferation of the epithelium under the posterior\nportion of the lens capsule.\n\n\nFibroplasia, lens epithelium\n\n\nSee above. (Figure 19)\n\n\nInjury to the lens may result in epithelial cell proliferation and/or\ntransformation to myofibroblasts.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nRPE proliferation.\n\nHyperplasia occurs as focal populations of RPE that proliferate in response to lost\nor damaged cells or inflammation (Machemer and Laqua 1975).\n\n\nRPE hyperplasia is often observed as focal proliferations of jumbled cell\nlayers that undermine the adjacent retina.Involved cells generally lack polarity and may be loosely attached to\nadjacent cells or to Bruch\u2019s membrane.On electron microscopy, hyperplastic RPE cells generally have large vesicular\nnuclei, scant cytoplasmic organelles, few melanosomes, and reduced numbers of\napical microvilli (Lee and\nValentine 1991).\n\n\nRPE hyperplasia may lead to degeneration of the adjacent retina due to impaired\ncapacity to support the metabolic needs of the retina, and subsequent loss of\nhomeostasis. Proliferation of RPE can also be associated with retinal detachment\n(McMartin et al.\n1992).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nEpithelial cells of the cornea, conjunctiva (bulbar and palpebral), or the\nlacrimal duct.\n\n\nExophytic growth with development of multiple branched fronds composed of a\nlining of variably keratinized squamous epithelium and a variably developed\nvascular connective tissue core.Cells are retained by a basement membrane without invasion into the\nunderlying tissues.No cellular dysplasia observed. No or only slight mitotic activity.\n\n\nCarcinoma, squamous cell:\n\n\nMalignant neoplasm exhibiting invasion of the underlying stroma, cellular\natypia and dysplasia as well as dyskeratosis, formation of epithelial\nkeratin \u2018pearls\u2019 and mitotic activity.\n\n\nSquamous cell papillomas are rare neoplasms of the cornea and conjunctiva, but\nhave been induced in rats by exposure to vapors of certain carcinogens. A variant\nof this neoplasm, an inverted mucoepidermoid papilloma, has been reported in a\nF344/N rat, exhibiting a downward growth pattern of proliferating superficial\nconjunctival epithelium with prominent squamous metaplasia (Yoshitomi and Boorman 1994).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nEpithelial cells of the cornea, conjunctiva (bulbar and palpebral), or the\nlacrimal duct.\n\n\nMass composed of cords and nests of neoplastic squamous cells with variable\namounts of keratinization.Neoplastic cells are large, have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, and round\nto oval vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli.Neoplastic cells penetrate the basement membrane, invade the underlying\ncorneal stroma and adjacent tissues, and form areas of dyskeratosis and\nkeratin \u2018pearls\u2019.Features of malignancy include lack of differentiation, numerous mitogenic\nfigures, loss of intercellular bridges and metastasis.\n\n\nPapilloma, squamous cell:\n\n\nCharacterized by exophytic growth and composed of fronds of squamous\nepithelium covering a fibrovascular core. Epithelium is retained by a\nbasement membrane.\n\n\nIn contrast to domestic animals (cattle, horses, cats), squamous cell carcinoma\nis a rare neoplasm in the rat.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNone\n\nSmooth muscle cells of either the iris dilatator or sphincter muscles\n(neuroectodermal) or from ciliary muscle or muscles of the uveal arterioles\n(mesodermal).\n\n\nThe neoplasm is composed of closely packed interlacing bundles and whorls\n(sometimes around blood vessels) of spindle-shaped cells with eosinophilic\ngranular cytoplasm and elongated to oval nuclei.Myofibrils are demonstrated by phosphotungstic/acid hematoxylin stain\n(PTAH) (Owen and Duprat\n1991).\n\n\nMelanoma, uveal, malignant:\n\n\nDifferentiation by light microscopic features may be difficult as both\nneoplasms are composed of spindle-shaped cells with formation of\nperivascular whorls. Leiomyoma react positive to desmin on\nimmunohistochemistry, and may be differentiated from melanoma cells, which\nare negative. Ultrastructurally, leiomyoma cells have cytoplasmic\nmyofibrils, focal cytoplasmic densities and surface-connected vesicles,\nwhereas melanoma cells contain stage II melanosomes.\n\n\nSchwannoma, intraocular, malignant:\n\nLeiomyomas are frequent tumors of the soft tissue, however, few uveal leiomyomas\nhave been reported. Diagnosis should be confirmed by immunohistochemistry and/or\nelectron microscopy.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nMelanoma, amelanotic; Melanoma, intraocular, malignant.\n\nNeuroectodermal from uveal melanocytes.\n\n\nGenerally unilateral lesion of the anterior uvea, but may also be located\nin the choroid; uveal melanomas may invade the cornea, conjunctiva, sclera,\nretina and orbit.Neoplasms can be composed of spindle-shaped (most common type), epithelioid\nor mixed cells.Spindle-shaped cells arranged in bundles and whorls with perivascular\norientation, indistinct cell borders, scant to moderate cytoplasm, fusiform\nnuclei and indistinct nucleoli.Epithelioid cells have ill-defined cell borders, pale-staining cytoplasm,\nand large oval nuclei with or without nucleoli; large epithelioid cells\n(rare) have large bizarre nuclei with nucleoli.Melanin granules are present in the cytoplasm in varying numbers.Necrotic areas may be present.Mitotic figures may be numerous in some neoplasms; argyrophilic fibers are\npresent along with a few cells containing yellow-brown pigment.\n\n\n(none described in mice).\n\nLeiomyoma, uveal:\n\n\nAlso composed of spindle-shaped cells with perivascular orientation. Can be\ndifferentiated immunohistochemically: leiomyomas are positive for desmin and\nnegative for S-100 protein; melanoma shows opposite immunoreactivity.\n\n\nSchwannoma, intraocular, malignant:\n\n\nComposed of S-100 positive spindle-shaped cells. Differentiation\nelectromicroscopically by demonstration of pericytoplasmic basal lamina,\nattenuated long cellular processes, and desmosomes.\n\n\nSpontaneous melanomas in rodents are apparently extremely rare. There are no\nreports of benign melanomas in albino or pigmented mice and rats; malignant\namelanotic melanomas in albino mice; spontaneous epithelioid anterior uveal\nmelanomas; or uveal melanomas in pigmented strains of rats. However, there are\nseveral chemicals known to induce intraocular melanomas in laboratory animals\n(Ernst et al. 1991).\nExtraocular metastasis of uveal melanomas is rare. In humans, uveal melanomas are\nthe most common primary intraocular tumors in adults (Everitt and Shadduck 1991).\n\nIn rats the diagnosis of uveal melanomas is aided by immunohistochemical\ndemonstration of a positive reaction in the neoplastic cells for S-100 protein and\nvimentin intermediate filaments and a negative reaction for cytokeratin, desmin\nand glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP). Ellipsoid premelanosomes (stage II\nmelanosomes) could be demonstrated in electron micrographs of cells of a rat with\namelanotic uveal melanoma. Since the main differential diagnosis is malignant\nschwannoma, which can be positive for S-100 protein as well, electron microscopy\nappears to be the best diagnostic method for differentiating these two neoplasms.\nSchwannomas, especially the \u201cmelanotic variant\u201d may contain melanosomes;\nconvoluted, moderately thin cytoplasmic processes lined by a continuous basal\nlamina are diagnostic for schwannomas.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNeurilemmoma, malignant; neurinoma, malignant.\n\nSchwann cells of intraocular ciliary nerves.\n\n\nFound in the iris and can involve the ciliary body, and fill the anterior\nchamber. Local invasion may occur into the cornea. Schwannomas can also be\nfound in the optic nerve.Plump spindle-shaped cells with abundant eosinophilic vacuolated cytoplasm;\ncells are arranged in parallel rows and form palisades around vessels.Nuclei are normochromatic oval to short elongate, varying slightly in size.\nSome cells have a small eosinophilic nucleolus.Mitotic figures may be numerous; may contain multiple areas of\nnecrosis.\n\n\nMelanoma, uveal, malignant:\n\n\nThe spindle shaped cells of the malignant schwannoma are arranged in a\nperivascular fascicular pattern, whereas the spindle cells of the uveal\nmelanoma are arranged in a perivascular whorl pattern. In electron\nmicrographs melanoma cells contain cytoplasmic stage II premelanosomes.\n\n\nLeiomyoma, uveal:\n\n\nUveal leiomyoma should have a positive immunoreactivity for desmin and a\nnegative immunoreactivity for S-100 protein (Chandra and Frith 1993). In electron\nmicrographs, cells of uveal leiomyoma have cytoplasmic myofibrosils, focal\ncytoplasmic densities, and surface-connected vesicles.\n\n\nSchwannoma occur frequently in the nervous system of rats and mice. However, they\nare considered rare spontaneous neoplasms of the globes of rats. Intraocular\nschwannoma show positive immunoreactivity for S-100 protein.\nElectromicroscopically, the cells have long thin cellular processes with\ndesmosomes, and a pericytoplasmic partial to complete basal lamina.\n\nPathogenesis/Cell of origin: Dependent on primary neoplasm.\n\nDifferential diagnosis: Dependent on primary neoplasm.\n\nComments: Malignant lymphoma originating in the spleen, lymph nodes\nand/or thymus has been seen in B6C3F1 mice. Lymphomas are found primarily in the\nchoroid, and can be associated with retinal detachment. Harderian gland carcinomas may\nalso invade the globe, as can fibrosarcoma induced by the injection of\n20-methylcholanthrene into the orbit. Secondary hemangiosarcoma has also been reported\n(Geiss and Yoshitomi\n1999).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nStromal cells of the meninges.\n\nMeningiomas that have been reported in rats have exhibited features of malignant\nmeningiomas, as described below.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nMeningeal sarcoma.\n\nStromal cells of the meninges.\n\nMeningiomas of the optic nerve of rats have exhibited characteristics of the\nmalignant form, including local invasion and a high mitotic rate (but without\nmetastasis). They have an epithelioid pattern (meningothelial type), which is rare\nin the cranial cavity. The epithelioid pattern is characterized by pleomorphic\nspindle cells with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, arranged in a whorling pattern,\noften with perivascular orientation and resembling Hassall\u2019s corpuscles of the\nthymus. Mineralization may be present, but no typical psammoma bodies are\nobserved. Giant cells may be present, some occasionally containing intranuclear\ncytoplasmic herniations appearing as vacuoles. Foci of necrosis with cholesterol\nclefts have been seen. Meningiomas of the optic nerve may or may not be S100\npositive, and their ultrastructure features consist of interdigitating cellular\nprocesses and desmosomes (Yoshitomi and Boorman 1990; (Yoshitomi, Everitt, and Boorman 1991).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNeurilemmoma; neurinoma.\n\nSchwann cells (myelinating cells of peripheral nerves) considered to be of\nneuroectodermal origin but capable of facultative differentiation to express\nmesenchymal properties.\n\nThe reported schwannoma in a rat exhibited malignant characteristics, as\ndescribed below.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNeurilemmoma, malignant; neurinoma, malignant.\n\nSchwann cells (myelinating cells of peripheral nerves), considered to be of\nneuroectodermal origin but capable of facultative differentiation to express\nmesenchymal properties.\n\nAn orbital malignant Schwannoma of an F344/N NTP rat described was believed to be\nof optic nerve origin since it was centered on, although obliterated, the optic\nnerve. Grossly the tumor was cystic. Antoni Type B features were more common than\nType A, with well-defined, anaplastic small cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic\nratio, variably-shaped nuclei, and frequent mitoses. There were areas of necrosis,\nthrombosis and hemorrhage. The cells were S100 negative. Short cell processes, and\nan incomplete to nearly complete basal lamina investing frequent cells were\nobserved on electron microscopy (Yoshitomi and Boorman 1991b).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nMinimally aggressive neoplasm.\n\nAstrocytoma, benign; astrocytoma, low grade; glioma, astrocytic, benign.\n\nResident astrocytes.\n\nGliomas of the optic nerve of two rats were characterized by large masses within\nthe bony orbit just posterior to the globe. Histologically, the tumors consisted\nof numerous, fairly well-differentiated astrocytes with poorly defined borders,\nelongated nuclei, common mitotic figures, focal cystic degeneration of tumor cells\nand loosely fibrillar cytoplasm. There was local invasion of adjacent orbital\nmuscles and glandular structures, but no evidence of tumor infiltration into the\nbrain (Fitzgerald et al.\n1974). Gliomas of the optic nerve may be caused by injection of nickel\ncompounds (Yoshitomi and\nBoorman 1990).\n\nThe Harderian gland is a large horseshoe-shaped gland located deep within the orbit of\nrodents and many other terrestrial vertebrates (Payne 1994). A small superior arm is connected to a large inferior arm by a\nnarrow band medial to the optic nerve. The color of the gland varies from pink to dark\ngrey depending upon the abundance and characteristics of melanocytes in the capsule and\ninterlobar septa (Markert and\nSilvers 1956). In addition, in rodents the gland is speckled with a pigment\nidentified as a porphyrin that fluoresces under ultraviolet light, which is secreted by\nthe gland, and the amount is said to vary with strain, sex, and age (Figge and Davidheiser 1957).\nThe tubuloalveolar gland is covered by a delicate connective tissue capsule bound\nloosely to the orbital fascia. Strands from the capsule divide the gland into lobes and\nlobules. The epithelial cells are pyramidal, their height depending upon the secretory\nphase. A round nucleus containing two or three nucleoli is located near the base, and\nthe cytoplasm, packed with lipid droplets, appears finely vacuolated or foamy.\nMyoepithelial cells are present between the epithelial cells and the prominent basement\nmembrane (Chiquoine 1958). The primary\nglandular secretion are lipids (wax esters), secreted by exocytosis (merocrine-type\nexcretion) and yellow-brown porphyrin pigment, which is not visualized within the\ncytoplasm but in the acinar and ductal lumina. The ducts are lined by cuboidal\nepithelium. Alveolar, lobular, and lobar ducts join to form a single excretory duct,\nwhich opens at the base of the nictitating membrane.\n\nThere are two pairs of lacrimal glands, the extraorbital (also called exorbital)\nlocated subcutaneously, ventral and anterior to the ear (rostral to the parotid gland)\nand the intraorbital (also called infraorbital) located superficially to the Harderian\ngland at the outer canthus of the eyelids. The extraorbital gland of the rat is bean\nshaped (12 \u00d7 9 mm) and flat (2 mm thick), whereas the intraorbital gland has an\napproximate triangular form (major axis of 7.5 mm and 1 mm thickness) (Hebel and Stromberg 1986). In\nthe mouse, the extraorbital gland is approximately 3 mm in diameter and the intraorbital\ngland can be hardly visualized without magnification (Botts et al. 1999). The excretory ducts of both glands\nfuse to form a common duct at the temporal angle of the palpebral fissure which opens\ninto the conjunctival sac dorsally. Both lacrimal glands are tubuloacinar and\nhistologically identical. Each is enclosed in a connective tissue capsule and divided by\nconnective tissue septa into lobes and lobules. The serous secretory cells are pyramidal\nwith granular basophilic cytoplasm that stains intensely near the round, basally-located\nnuclei, and stains much less intensely between the nuclei and the narrow acinar lumen.\nMyoepithelial cells are found between the epithelium and the basement membrane. The\nintralobular ducts are lined by cuboidal cells whereas the excretory ducts are lined by\nstratified columnar epithelium (Krinke et\nal. 1994; 1996).\nHistologically, a gender dimorphism of the lacrimal glands can be observed after sexual\nmaturity in rats, which increases with age and is characterized by scattered enlarged\nacinar epithelial cells containing enlarged nuclei (karyomegaly) in the male. In female\nrats, the lacrimal gland maintains the normal histological structure with aging, in\nmales the lacrimal gland becomes pleomorphic (see Karyomegaly and Harderian gland\nalteration).\n\nThe paired nasolacrimal ducts are the major component of a draining system that carries\nthe lacrimal secretions from the eyes to the nasal cavity. Due to this anatomical and\nfunctional relation with the eye and glands of the eye, it is considered to be part of\nthe lacrimal apparatus. The draining system begins with the lacrimal ducts at two puncta\nlacrimalia in each eye, oval openings located close to the edge of the eyelids lateral\nto the nasal angle of the palpebral fissure. The lacrimal ducts fuse nasally to form the\nnasolacrimal duct. In the rat, the paired nasolacrimal ducts are about 22 mm long, 0.5\nby 0.2 mm wide in the initial portion and about 0.8 by 0.6 mm in its middle portion.\nEach nasolacrimal duct as a membranous tube runs along the outer aspect of the lacrimal\nbone, passes through the infraorbital fissure, and enters the osseous nasolacrimal\ncanal, which crosses the alveolus of the incisor tooth ventrally. Within the region of\nthe nasal cavity it runs in a channel formed by a ventral lamella of the\nmaxilloturbinate and the os incisivum. At the rostral end of the maxilloturbinate it\npasses to the lateral wall of the nasal cartilage and about 2 mm caudal to the nostril\nopens ventromedially into the nasal vestibule (Hebel and Stromberg 1986). Since the\nnasolacrimal duct is visualized when examining the nasal cavity at different section\nlevels, this duct has been referred to as part of the upper respiratory system, or as an\naccessory structure of the nasal cavity. Depending on the section level of the nasal\ncavity examined, the nasolacrimal duct can be found dorsolateral to the maxillary sinus\nat level III (section through the second palatine crest including the first upper molars\nin the rat); laterally to the root of the incisor tooth at the level II (section at the\nincisive papilla in rat and mice) or ventromedial to the root of the incisor teeth at\nlevel I (section at the posterior part of the upper incisor teeth in rat and mice)\n(Monticello et al. 1990;\nBoorman et al. 1990; Uraih and Maronpot 1990; Kittel et al. 2004).The epithelium of\nthe ducts in the mouse varies from slightly keratinized squamous or low cuboidal in\nlevels I and II of the nasal cavity, to non-ciliated pseudostratified cuboidal or\ncolumnar epithelium in level III (Herbert and Leininger 1999). According to other authors, stratified squamous\nepithelium is found at the origin and termination of the nasolacrimal duct. The rest of\nthe duct is lined by pseudostratified non-ciliated columnar epithelium (Uraih and Maronpot 1990).\nFurthermore, the nasolacrimal duct epithelium has been described as a transitional\nepithelium (Stewart et al. 1979).\nDetailed descriptions of the mentioned epithelial types are missing. At level III of the\nnasal cavity, subepithelial lymphoid cell infiltrates appear to be associated to the\ninitial part of the nasolacrimal duct (Monticello et al. 1990).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nAcinar and/or ductal epithelial cells.\n\n\nShrinkage of single, non-contiguous epithelial cells with condensed\nhypereosinophilic cytoplasm.\n\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nAcinar and/or ductal epithelial cells.\n\n\nCells are swollen and exhibit cytoplasmic eosinophilia affecting groups of\nepithelial cells or acini (focal, multifocal, diffuse) or individual cells\n(necrosis, single cell).Associated with inflammation.Cellular exfoliation/debris.Squamous metaplasia and fibrosis may be seen.Hemorrhage may be present when necrosis is associated with retro-orbital\nbleeding procedure.\n\n\nNone.\n\nNecrosis is a predominant feature in Rat coronavirus/Sialodacryoadenitis Virus\ninfection.

The most frequent type of inflammatory\ncell infiltrate observed in the Harderian gland in rat and mouse is lymphocytic\n(lymphoid aggregates) and occurs spontaneously. In mice, the incidence of\nlymphocytic infiltrates increase with age and is more common 150S RAMOS ET AL. in\nmale than in female B6C3F1 mice (Botts et al. 1999). Lymphocytic inflammatory cell infiltrates occur\nspontaneously with advancing age and may or may not be associated with\nHarderization of the lacrimal gland. It remains unclear whether these lymphocytic\ninfiltrates involve an autoimmune mechanism (Krinke et al. 1996). In the nasolacrimal duct,\nlymphocytic infiltrates (lymphoid aggregates) predominate (Monticello et al. 1990).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nDacryoadenitis.\n\nAcini and/or ducts and interstitial tissue.\n\n\nFoci or more extended areas of single or mixed inflammatory cellular\ntypes.Interstitial edema and/or congestion.May be associated with squamous metaplasia of acinar/ductal epithelium or\ninterstitial fibrosis.Salivary glands may be involved, in addition to the Harderian and lacrimal\nglands.Porphyrin accretions are associated with granulomatous inflammation in the\nHarderian gland.Inflammation resulting from blood sampling is accompanied by hemorrhage and\nis localized to the puncture site.Inflammation due to viral inflammation tends to be extensive\n(multilobular).\n\n\nInfiltrate, inflammatory cell:\n\n\u2022 Foci of single or mixed inflammatory cell types without other features of\ninflammation.\n\nModifiers are recommended in relation to the predominant inflammatory cellular\ntype (neutrophilic, eosinophilic, lymphocytic, plasmacytic or histiocytic) or\nmixture of different cellular types (mixed). Although uncommon in modern\nlaboratory animal facilities, inflammation caused by Rat\ncoronavirus/Sialodacryoadenitis Virus (SDAV) is multilobular, with\ndegeneration/necrosis as a prominent feature, accompanied by neutrophilic\ninflammation in early phases. In the late inflammatory phases, lymphocytes and\nmacrophages as well as tubuloacinar squamous metaplasia are the most predominant\nfeatures (Percy et al. 1989).\nChromodacryorrhea (red tears) may be present due to hypersecretion of porphyrin in\ncases of inflammation in the Harderian gland caused by the SDAV, however no\nporphyrin accretions are observed in the acini. Xenobiotic induced inflammation\nmay be lymphocytic or mixed (lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages). In severe\ncases epithelial hyperplasia and interstitial fibrosis has been noted (Reuber 1976). Chronic dacryoadenitis\nwith degenerative epithelial changes and increased porphyrin secretion are\nreported to occur in the Harderian gland after long term treatment with an\ninotropic phosphodiesterase inhibitor in rats (Westwood et al. 1991).\n\nSDAV also causes inflammation of the nasolacrimal ducts (Bihun and Percy 1995). Inflammation of the\nnasal cavity is reported to occur with chemical induced inflammation of the ducts\n(National Toxicology Program 2010; Schoevers et al. 1994; Wagner et al. 2009). Drug-related inflammation\nneeds to be differentiated from degeneration, necrosis and inflammation that is\nreported in the nasolacrimal duct of aged mice (Herbert and Leininger 1999).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nGranulomatous dacryoadenitis, foreign body inflammation, porphyrin granuloma (the\nlatter occurs in the Harderian gland; also called atrophy and sclerosis of the\nHarderian gland in the rat).\n\nAcini and/or ducts and interstitial tissue.\n\n\nGranulomatous reaction composed of epithelioid macrophages, multinucleated\ngiant cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells.May be associated with a foreign body.In the case of porphyrin granuloma, granulomatous reaction associated with\nporphyrin accretions (in the lumen of atrophic acini and/or porphyrin\npartially engulfed by macrophages).\n\n\nPorphyrin granuloma of the Harderian gland is an agerelated spontaneous change\nassociated with increased porphyrin secretion and acinar atrophy, which precedes\ngranuloma formation. Abundant deposition of connective tissue fibers may replace\nthe injured acini. Macroscopically, this finding is characterized by the presence\nof multifocal dark discolorations on the surface of the gland, representing the\nporphyrin accretions. It appears to be more common in aging rats (from one to\nthree years) than mice. A female sex predilection has been suggested, however, it\nis questionable whether female rats are more susceptible to porphyrin granulomas\nthan males (Krinke 1991). Rarely,\nretro-orbital granulomatous inflammation may be associated with hair shafts in rat\nand mouse, introduced into the glandular tissues by scratching or by retro-orbital\npuncture, either which can be associated with fungal hyphae. A granulomatous type\nof inflammation of the nasolacrimal duct is shown in the \u201cRespiratory System\u201d\nINHAND (Renne et al.\n2009).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nAcini\n\n\nNormal acini may contain an increased amount of porphyrin (a yellow-brown\nsubstance with a fluid appearance). Alternatively, porphrin may appear as\nsolid, laminated brown masses within atrophic acini.\n\n\nGranulomatous inflammation\n\n\nPorphyrin accretions are accompanied by a granulomatous reaction\n(epithelioid macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes and plasma\ncells).\n\n\nAs a spontaneous change, it is frequently observed in aging rats and mice.\nIncreased porphyrin is also mentioned in inflammation of the Harderian gland\ncaused by phosphodiesterease inhibitors (Westwood et al. 1991).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nCytomegaly; Nuclear pleomorphism; Polyploidy.\n\nAcinar epithelial cells of the lacrimal gland.\n\n\nAcinar epithelial cells with variation in nuclear size and shape (the\nnuclei may be two to four times the normal size and may be accompanied by\nincrease in cellular size).Increased nuclear basophilia.Intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions (pseudoinclusions) can be\nobserved.\n\n\nKaryomegaly is characteristic of the male rat and mouse lacrimal gland. Increased\nnuclear size represents polyploidy, whereas the nuclear inclusions represent\ncytoplasmic invaginations. Karyomegaly is androgen-dependent and is therefore\nobserved in males after sexual maturity (sexual dimorphism) and becomes more\nprominent with increasing age (Krinke et al. 1994; Krinke et al. 1996; Paulini and Mohr 1975). Karyomegaly may be induced by cytomegalovirus\n(MCMV) infection.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nHarderization; Ectopic Harderian gland in the lacrimal gland\n\n\nFoci of acini with histological characteristics of Harderian gland\n(composed of cuboidal to columnar cells with finely vacuolated cytoplasm and\ndistinct alveolar lumen).\n\n\nIn rats, Harderian gland alteration can be observed in the extraorbital lacrimal\ngland of male and female rats at three months of age, but increases at six months\nof age in males only. This process appears to be androgen-dependent but also\ninfluenced by the absence of estrogen receptors on lacrimal gland acinar\nepithelial cells in male rats after six months of age (Ferrara et al. 2004). Conversely in mice,\nfemales are more frequently affected than males (Krinke et al. 1996). It remains unclear whether\nthis change reflects a metaplastic or a degenerative change. It appears that the\nHarderian gland cells develop from undifferentiated basal cells of the lacrimal\ngland acini and intercalated and excretory ducts (Sashima et al. 1989).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nAcinar epithelium of the Harderian gland.\n\n\nCellular proliferation confined to solitary or multiple foci.There is no evidence of compression of adjacent parenchyma.Architecture of the gland is maintained.Alveolar pattern is retained, but there is an increased number of cells\nlining the acini.Epithelium is one layer thick.Epithelium may project into the acinar lumen.Foci of hyperplasia have an alveolar pattern and an increased number of\ncells lining the acini. Hyperplastic cells may be larger and tinctorially\n(basophilic) distinct.\n\n\nAdenoma:\n\n\nAdenoma is an expansively enlarging lesion that causes obvious compression\nand distortion of the architecture of the adjacent gland. Cellular atypia is\ngenerally noted.\n\n\nHyperplasia of the Harderian gland occurs in association with adenitis and\natrophy of the gland and squamous metaplasia of ducts. This lesion may be a\nregenerative response to damage to the gland caused by virus-induced\nsialodacryoadenitis, trauma of orbital bleeding, and other causes. Hyperplasia of\nthe Harderian gland may occur in the absence of adenitis. Primary hyperplasia may\nbe a preneoplastic change.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nEpithelial acinar cells of lacrimal gland.\n\n\nFocal non-compressive proliferation of acinar cells is associated with\ndegenerative and inflammatory lesions of the lacrimal gland.Squamous cell hyperplasia is observed in the lacrimal duct associated with\ninflammation.\n\n\nAdenoma:\n\n\u2022 Adenoma causes compression and displacement of adjacent non-neoplastic gland,\nand has distorted arrangement of lobules and acini.\n\nHyperplasia of lacrimal glands in the absence of degenerative and inflammatory\nlesions is exceedingly rare in the rat and has not been reported in the mouse.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nEpithelial lining of the NLD (slight to non-keratinized stratified squamous\nepithelium, pseudostratified cuboidal or columnar epithelium or transitional\nepithelium).\n\n\nEpithelial hyperplasia may be mural, involving a variable expanse of the\nlining epithelium, or be exophytic (polypoid).\n\n\nReactive hyperplasia:\n\n\nSigns of inflammation (periductal, intraepithelial and luminal inflammatory\ncells with accompanying proteinaceous fluid and cellular debris in ductal\nlumen) in addition to the epithelial hyperplasia.\n\n\nEpithelial hyperplasia of the NLD was described in aged mice (158 and 142-week\nold males) (Leininger et al.\n1996).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nAcinar epithelium of the Harderian gland.\n\n\nAdenomas are usually well demarcated, rarely encapsulated and cause\ncompression of the surrounding gland.Architecture of the gland is not maintained within the tumor.Piling of cells may be present and clusters of epithelial cells may project\ninto the acinar lumina on the surface of the lining cells.The cytoplasm may/may not retain its normal foamy appearance.Neoplastic cells are enlarged, the nuclei are fairly uniform, and rarely\nhave mitotic activity (except for acinar type in the mouse).\n\n\nIn the mouse, the following growth patterns can be distinguished: (Krinke et al. 2001)\n\nPapillary:\n\n\nMultiple branching papillary projections with a fibrovascular stroma.Epithelium is one or occasionally more layers thick but still attached to\nthe basal lamina.\n\n\nCystic:\n\n\nMultiple distended cystic spaces are lined by epithelium.Papillary projections may be present, but are not prominent.Mostly large tumors have a prominent capsule.\n\n\nCystic-papillary:\n\n\nComposed of both papillary and cystic areas.Cystic areas appear empty except for cellular debris and remnants of\npapillary projections.The epithelial lining may be flattened.\n\n\nAcinar:\n\n\nGrowth pattern resembles acinar glandular architecture despite the marked\nproliferation of the epithelial cells.Encapsulation and compression may be absent.Papillary projections are not prominent.Cells with single large cytoplasmic vacuoles may be present.Cytoplasm may be eosinophilic and homogeneous without foamy appearance.Nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is increased in comparison to the other\ntypes.Cells are more pleomorphic and mitotic figures are more numerous than in\nthe other types.\n\n\nHyperplasia, acinar:\n\n\nIn hyperplasia, the architecture of glandular acini is retained without\ncompression of the adjacent gland, whereas in the adenoma the acinar\narchitecture is distorted and compression involves the adjacent gland.\n\n\nAdenocarcinoma:\n\n\nAdenocarcinoma, well differentiated, is distinguished from adenoma by local\ninvasion and cellular atypia; less differentiated adenocarcinoma has a solid\ngrowth pattern, cellular pleomorphism, and metastases.\n\n\nSpontaneous neoplasms of the Harderian glands are of rare occurrence in rats of\nvarious strains, but have been induced by administration of urethane during the\nneonatal period (Elwell and\nBoorman 1990). Adenomas of the Harderian gland are common in some mouse\nstrains. In contrast to rats, spontaneous Harderian gland adenomas are frequently\nobserved in old albino and pigmented mice. The incidence varies with strain and\nsignificant sex differences have been described. The incidence of spontaneous\nadenomas given in the literature varies from 0.5 to 14.9% (Krinke et al. 2001).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nAcinar epithelium of the Harderian gland.\n\n\nWell differentiated adenocarcinoma is composed of cuboidal to columnar\nepithelial cells arranged as tubular and acinar structures with solid areas\nof cells in some neoplasms.Poorly differentiated carcinoma is composed of solid sheets of pleomorphic\nepithelial cells with few tubular and acinar structures.Anaplastic carcinoma is composed of solid sheets of pleomorphic epithelial\ncells without tubular and acinar structures and with numerous mitotic\nfigures (Senoh et al.\n2014).Invasion of the orbital/periorbital tissues may occur along with foci of\nnecrosis and fibrosis. Adenocarcinomas are frequently associated with\nexophthalmos. Metastasis to regional lymph nodes and lung has been reported\n(Carlton and Render\n1991).\n\n\nAdenoma:\n\n\nWell differentiated adenocarcinoma is separated from adenoma by\nhistological evidence of local invasion. In addition, the lack of\nhistological and cellular differentiation distinguishes the poorly\ndifferentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas from adenoma.\n\n\nSpontaneous adenocarcinomas are rarely described in rats, but adenocarcinomas\nhave been produced by experimental exposure to 2-acetylaminofluorene. In mice,\nadenocarcinomas also occur less frequently than adenomas.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nEpithelial acinar cells of lacrimal gland.\n\n\nExpansive growth causes compression and distortion of adjacent\nnon-neoplastic glandular parenchyma.Lobular mass is composed of tubular and acinar structures lined by uniform\ncuboidal cells with uniform, generally round nuclei.\n\n\nAdenocarcinoma:\n\n\nMalignant neoplasms have features such as cellular atypia, local invasion,\ndistant metastasis, and mitotic activity. Lobular and acinar arrangements\nmay be absent and the neoplasm is composed of solid areas and clusters of\ncells.\n\n\nSpontaneous neoplasms of the lacrimal glands are rarely reported in rats,\nalthough these glands are not routinely examined. Described adenomas have been\nacinar in type, and ductular adenomas have not been reported.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nAcinar epithelial cells of lacrimal gland.\n\n\nExpansive mass that causes compression and distortion of adjacent\nnon-neoplastic gland.Invasion of adjacent tissues.Lobular pattern is obscured and cellular atypia and pleomorphism of varying\nseverity are observed.Irregular acinar structures are lined by stratified epithelium and much of\nthe neoplasm may be replaced by solid collections of epithelial cells with\nround to ovoid, variably-sized nuclei.\n\n\nAdenoma:\n\n\nThe benign neoplasm lacks the cellular atypia and pleomorphism, evidence of\nlocal invasion, and poorly developed lobular and acinar patterns of the\nmalignant neoplasm.\n\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the lacrimal glands are exceedingly rare in the rat and\nmouse (Mohr 1994).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nEpithelial lining of the NLD (slight to non-keratinized stratified squamous\nepithelium, pseudostratified cuboidal or columnar epithelium).\n\n\nExophytic mass of uniform, regularly arranged squamous cells resting on a\nstalk of vascularized connective tissue.Keratinization may be absent depending on the type of proliferating cell\n(transitional papilloma).Intact basement membrane.\n\n\nPolypoid hyperplasia:\n\n\nNo vascularized stalk of connective tissue.\n\n\nCarcinoma, squamous cell:\n\n\nCellular atypia.Destruction of basement membrane.Invasive growth.\n\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nEpithelial lining of the NLD (slight to non-keratinized stratified squamous\nepithelium, pseudostratified cuboidal or columnar epithelium).\n\n\nIrregular cellular and nuclear size and shape (depending on the grade of\ndifferentiation).Invasion beyond the basement membrane.Frequently concurrent with proliferating mass in the nasal cavity and\nsurrounding tissues.\n\n\nPapilloma, squamous cell:\n\n\nNo cellular atypia.No invasion beyond basement membrane and into surrounding tissues.\n\nIt is difficult to determine the site of origin of spontaneous squamous cell\ncarcinoma in the nasal cavity. Nasal masses frequently affect secondary paranasal\nstructures such as the incisor tooth or nasolacrimal duct. However, spontaneous\ncarcinomas of the nasal cavity may arise from the nasolacrimal duct and invade\nadjacent areas (palate, maxillary bone, tooth and nasal cavity) (Maronpot 1990; Schoevers EJ et al. 1994).\n\nStandardized nomenclature of nonproliferative and proliferative lesions of the olfactory\nepithelium is common to the different chemosensory structures in the nasal passages\n(listed below). Each of these structures is described separately in this manuscript, and\nthere is, therefore, some redundancy of the responses in the different structures.\nMoreover, the main olfactory epithelium has been described previously under the\nproliferative and nonproliferative lesions of rat and mouse respiratory tract (Renne et al. 2009); wherever applicable,\nthis section uses identical nomenclature.The chemosensory/olfactory system is represented\nby a number of structures/organs in the nasal passages (Storan and Key 2006; Ma 2007; Rivi\u00e8re et\nal. 2009; Silvotti et al.\n2011; Barrios et al.\n2014),\n\n\nMain olfactory epithelium (MOE),Vomeronasal organ (VNO)/Jacobson\u2019s Organ,Septal organ of Masera (SOM)/olfactory septal organ/organ of Rodolfo-Masera/septal\nolfactory organ andGrueneberg ganglion (GG).\n\n\nTogether these structures function in the special sense of smell or olfaction. All\nstructures connect with areas in the brain via the main (MOE, SOM, GG) or accessory (VNO)\nolfactory bulb (Jia and Halpern\n2003; Restrepo et al.\n2004) (Figure 80) via the olfactory nerve (Fuss et al.\n2005). MOE is a target of toxicity for several substances, both via air exposure\nand oral uptake (Harkema 1991; Haschek-Hock and Witschi\n2004; Renne et al. 2009; Nyska et al. 2005; Woutersen et al. 2010). Reports on xenobiotic-induced\nhistopathology of the other chemosensory structures are less common (VNO) to very rare\n(SOM) to absent (GG).\n\nOther neural structures in the nasal passages are\n\n\nsingle receptors/solitary chemosensory cells/\u2018brush\u2019 cells andfree intraepithelial trigeminal nerve branches.\n\n\nThese other neural structures are considered to monitor the inhaled air for flow rate,\nnociception and thermoperception (Finger et\nal. 2003; Gulbransen et al.\n2008; Tizzano et al.\n2011). They connect with the brain via the trigeminal nerve (Figure 80), and stimulation by inhalation of irritating substances\nmay lead to protective reflexes like sneezing. The components are part of the nasal\nepithelium; one in approximately 100 respiratory epithelial cells, brush cells and free\nnerve endings are present in the squamous, respiratory and olfactory epithelium (Finger et al. 1990; Spit et al. 1993; Katahashi et al. 1997). Consequently, nasal\nepithelial toxicants can affect them. However, reports on toxicity to these structures are\npractically non-existent, and also because they cannot easily be recognized in\nconventionally-stained sections. Therefore, they are not further addressed here.\n\nThere is a close connection of nasal neural structures and the brain. Therefore, the\nolfactory and trigeminal pathways can act as transport of inhaled substances to the brain,\nand circumvent the blood-brain barrier. In addition, part of the cerebrospinal fluid\ndrains onto the olfactory nasal mucosa (Brinker et al. 1997). The nose-brain connection should be kept in mind when\nevaluating histopathology of the nasal neural structures.\n\nThe location of lesions is related to the deposition of inhaled or ingested substances\nand site-specific susceptibility in relation to tissue factors like metabolism, species\nand sex (Kai et al. 2006). An apparent\nlack of effects on SOM and GG may also be due to sampling of nasal tissue and selection of\nlevels for microscopic examination.\n\nThe MOE covers 50% of the epithelium lining the rat nasal cavity; in the mouse 47% of\nthe nasal epithelium is olfactory (Harkema and Morgan 1996). The MOE covers a small portion of the dorsocranial\nmeatus and contiguous upper one-third of the nasal septum and the majority of the\nethmoid turbinates in the posterior nasal cavity. The main olfactory epithelium houses\nbasal (stem) cells, intermediate neuronal precursors, mature sensory neurons and\nsustentacular/supporting cells. Epithelial degeneration, necrosis and regeneration of\nthe epithelium are often present together, when the tissue is repeatedly exposed to\ntoxic chemicals, resulting in a disorganized morphologic picture (Renne et al. 2009; Hardisty et al. 1999). MOE, olfactory nerve and\nolfactory bulb have a high regenerative capacity after injury. MOE regenerates from\nbasal cells, Bowman\u2019s glands (epithelial or in the submucosa) and duct cells regenerate\nfrom progenitor cells within the ducts, whereas sustentacular cells can arise from both\ncell sources (Huard et al. 1998).\nHowever, a certain specificity of odorant perception may not always be restored unless a\nsubstantial number of fibers of the same type are spared (Schwob 2002).\n\nThe VNO is a bilateral tubular structure located ventrally, within the bone and\ncartilage at the base of the septum and opening to the nasal cavity. The lumina are\nlined laterally by respiratory epithelium and medially by neuronal epithelium (Figure 81). Like other olfactory epithelium it houses basal, neurosensory and sustentacular\ncells. At present, VNO is the only olfactory organ known to connect with the accessory\nolfactory bulb (Storan and Key\n2006). A low number of neutrophils appear to be normal constituents of the\nnon-sensory, respiratory epithelium (Getchell and Kulkarni 1995; D\u00f8ving and Trotier 1998). The\nneuronal epithelium is organized into different zones: the marginal zones at the\ntransition/border with the respiratory epithelium; the intermediate zones and the\ncentral zone (Brann and Firestein\n2010). Vomeronasal glands are found apically of the tubules, within the\ncartilage that surrounds the VNO (Adams\n1992). Its main function is perception of pheromones. VNO is already\nwell-developed at birth (Oikawa et al.\n2001), but increases in size postnatally. The overall volume, neuroepithelial\nvolume, and number of bipolar neurons are larger in males compared to females (Guillam\u00f3n and Segovia 1997).\nMitosis in the adult occurs particularly at the marginal zones of the neural epithelium\n(Weiler 2005; De La Rosa-Prieto et al. 2009; Mart\u00ednez-Marcos et al. 2000).\nNeural turnover in the mouse in the VNO epithelium may occur especially through\nmigration (Halpern and\nMart\u00ednez-Marcos 2003); cells at the edges were found to migrate horizontally\nvery slowly (less than 10% of the distance from the edge to the center of the epithelium\nper month). Distribution of apoptotic cells indicate that a number of cells in mitosis\ndie before becoming functional neurons. Regeneration of new neurons is preserved even in\naged rodents (De La\nRosa-Prieto et al. 2010).\n\nThe SOM is a bilateral, small island of olfactory cells, surrounded by respiratory\nciliated epithelium. The islands are located at the ventral base of the nasal septum,\nposterior to the opening of the nasopalatine duct. SOM is present at birth, increases in\nsize postnatally till sexual maturity, and declines thereafter, but is still present in\naged rats (Breipohl et al. 1989;\nWeiler and Farbman 2003;\nAdams 1992). Like other olfactory\nepithelium it houses basal, neurosensory and sustentacular cells. The SOM is located\nrostral to the MOE and may serve as a rostral sensor in advance of MOE perception,\ntriggering deeper inhalation (Marshall and Maruniak 1986). Alternatively, SOM olfactory perception may be\nlimited to certain chemical signatures dictated by the limited connection to specific\nregions within the olfactory bulb. SOM projects mainly to the posterior, ventromedial\npart of the main olfactory bulb (Ma et al.\n2003). Both options are supported by molecular analysis of the receptors\npresent in SOM (Tian and Ma 2004;\nSu et al. 2009). The sensory neurons\nin the septal organ and in the MOE share signaling pathways and show similar odorant\nresponses, but some receptors are present in SOM in very high densities. The SOM can\nserve as an airflow sensor in addition to its chemosensory roles (Ma 2010).\n\nThe GG is a bilateral group of ganglion cells and their associated overlying squamous\nepithelium, located in the dorsal meatus of the vestibulum of the nasal passages (mouse:\nGr\u00fcneberg 1973; Fleischer et al. 2006; Roppolo et al. 2006; mouse and rat:\nBrechb\u00fchl et al. 2014).\nGanglion cells are present at birth. GG of neonatal mice most likely has a dual\nfunction, namely perception of alarm pheromones (and a few odorous compounds like\ndimethylpyrazine) and temperatures (Liu et\nal. 2009; Mamasuew et al.\n2008 and 2011; Schmid et al.\n2010; Fleischer and Breer\n2010). The function of GG appears to decline with age (Fleischer et al. 2006).\n\nThe olfactory bulb is part of the brain and receives sensory input via the olfactory\nnerve (which contains axons from olfactory receptor neurons of the olfactory\nepithelium), and transmits chemosensory information from the nose to the brain. It is\ngenerally assumed that the bulb functions as a filter of chemosensory information (Soucy et al. 2009). The olfactory bulb\nis reported to also receive inputs from such brain areas as the amygdala, neocortex,\nhippocampus, locus coeruleus, and substantia nigra (Kang et al. 2009).\n\nThe olfactory bulb consists of the main olfactory bulb and the accessory olfactory\nbulb, both of which have similar histologic structure. The main olfactory bulb is\norganized into a glomerular layer, external plexiform layer, mitral cell layer, internal\nplexiform layer and a granule cell layer (Gutman et al. 2013). The glomerular layer receives direct input from the\nolfactory nerve, and their axons terminate in spherical structures known as glomeruli,\nwhere they connect in the external plexiform layer with the apical dendrites of mitral\ncells. The basal dendrites (internal plexiform layer) of the mitral cells transport the\nsignals further to the olfactory cortex. Mitral cells are connected to interneurons\nknown as granule cells, which are probably involved in inhibition processes. The\naccessory olfactory bulb, a region located dorsal-posterior to the main olfactory bulb,\nappears to operate independently from the main olfactory bulb (Yokosuka 2012). It receives input from the vomeronasal\norgan and connects mainly to the amygdala and hypothalamus (Mucignat-Caretta 2010).\n\n (Figures 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85)\n\nNone.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nAtrophy, olfactory epithelium; atrophy, Bowman\u2019s gland.\n\nOlfactory epithelium including sustentacular cells; degenerative change.\n\n\nThinning of the affected mucosa.Cells are reduced in height (cuboidal to flattened).The nuclei appear close together due to reduced cytoplasm.Often accompanied by loss of axon bundles in subjacent lamina propria.Underlying turbinate bone may also be atrophied (Renne et al. 2009).\n\n\nMetaplasia (see Metaplasia, respiratory, MOE and Metaplasia, squamous cell,\nMOE):\n\n\nChange in epithelial cell types present, usually with mixture of cell types\nin areas of transition.\n\n\nDegeneration, MOE:\n\n\nLoss of cilia and cellular organization but no decrease in thickness of\nepithelial layer.\n\n\nArtifacts:\n\n\nPostmortem autolysis: Uniform dissolution of entire tissue section with no\nchange in organization or depth of cell layers.Tangential section through epithelium: Microscopic evidence of tangential\ncut in other tissue structures.\n\n\nAtrophy is commonly observed as a sequel to degeneration of olfactory epithelium.\nAtrophy of olfactory epithelium secondary to degeneration of sensory or\nsustentacular cells has been observed following inhalation of a variety of\nchemicals (Buckley et al.\n1985; Hardisty et al.\n1999; Monticello et\nal. 1990; Leininger et\nal. 1996).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nDegeneration, olfactory epithelium; degeneration, Bowman\u2019s gland.\n\nOlfactory epithelium.\n\n(Renne et al. 2009, see\nDegeneration).\n\n\nLoss of cilia.Epithelial vacuolization/bleb formation.Increased intercellular spaces.Loss of organization of the cell layers.Dilatation (ectasia) of Bowman\u2019s glands (subepithelial) with accumulation\nof secretory material.\n\n\nPostmortem autolysis:\n\n\nUniform dissolution of entire tissue section with no change in organization\nor depth of cell layers.\n\n\nMetaplasia (see Metaplasia, respiratory, MOE and Metaplasia, squamous cell,\nMOE):\n\n\nChange in epithelial cell types present, usually with mixture of cell types\nin areas of transition.\n\n\nDegenerative changes in olfactory epithelium have been reported as sequelae to\ntoxic agent exposure (Harkema\n1990; Monticello et al.\n1990; Morgan and\nHaarkema 1996; Maronpot\n1990 and as a consequence of aging (St Clair and Morgan 1992).

Chemicals that injure the olfactory epithelium\nthat first require metabolism to a toxic intermediate usually induce lesions\nthroughout the olfactory epithelium (Gaskell 1990) and may also induce necrosis in adjacent Bowman\u2019s glands\n(Jensen and Sleight\n1987). A frequent sequela to loss of sensory cells (either through aging\nor toxic injury) is atrophy of nerve bundles within the lamina propria.\nConversely, apoptosis of olfactory epithelium can occur with surgical transection\nof axons or by treatment with antimicrotubule drugs (Levin et al. 1999; Kai et al. 2006).

The spontaneous lesion tends to affect one side more than\nthe other and is associated with slightly dilated Bowman\u2019s glands, possibly\ncontaining neutrophils and/or eosinophilic granular debris. However, induced\nlesions may also be restricted to or be more pronounced unilaterally, because of\ndifferences in air flow between the two passages. There is no evidence that\nrespiratory epithelial metaplasia is preneoplastic. The normal extension of\nolfactory epithelium into the anterior region of the dorsal meatus may vary with\nage and can be possibly strain dependent. Precise anatomic localization and\ncomparison with controls are necessary to ensure proper diagnosis of the\nepithelium involved.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nProliferative non-neoplastic lesion.\n\nMetaplasia, squamous cell, olfactory epithelium; metaplasia, squamous cell,\nBowman\u2019s gland.\n\nMetaplasia of cells of olfactory epithelium and/or cells of submucosal glands in\nthe lamina propria.\n\n\nCharacterized by replacement of olfactory or ductal cells of Bowman\u2019s\nglands by squamous epithelium.Where the squamous epithelium is stratified, epithelial cells and their\nnuclei are increasingly flattened superficially.Compact or large epithelial cells with complete loss of cilia.Sometimes slight nuclear polymorphism and cellular atypia.Surface cells might contain only keratohyaline granules, or they might be\nexcessively keratinized.Often desquamation of surface cells.\n\n\nPapilloma, squamous cell:\n\n\nA papillary projection above the surface of the epithelium or extension\ninto the lumen of the ducts of the submucosal glands.

Cells are one or possibly two layers thick,\nwith increased basophilia; slight karyomegaly, but there is no horizontal\nlayering (stratification) of flattened cells as in squamous metaplasia.\n\n\nSquamous metaplasia sometimes occurs in association with chronic inflammation or\nfollowing the process of regeneration. Squamous metaplasia with a normal\nmaturation pattern may be reversible under some experimental circumstances (e.g.,\ndepending on nature of inhaled irritant and duration of exposure) but in other\nsituations may eventually give rise to squamous cell papilloma or squamous cell\ncarcinoma.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nProliferative non-neoplastic lesion.\n\nProliferation of precursors of sensory epithelial cells of the vomeronasal\norgan.\n\n\nIncreased thickness of the epithelium resulting from an increase in the\nnumber of sustentacular, sensory precursor, and/or basal cells.\n\n\nRegeneration, VNO:\n\n\nChanged nucleus to cytoplasm ration, increased basophilia, but no increase\nin the number of cells.\n\n\nCarcinoma, neuroepithelial, VNO:\n\n\nRosette formation and invasive growth or anaplasia or destructive\ngrowth.\n\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nProliferative non-neoplastic lesion.\n\nOlfactory epithelium.\n\n\nCharacterized by replacement of olfactory epithelium by squamous\nepithelium.Layers of stratified epithelial cells, with flattening of the superficial\ncells.Surface area may be excessively keratinized.Covers small area at the location of the VNO.\n\n\nCarcinoma, squamous cell:\n\n\nCharacterized by destruction of the basement membrane.\n\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nProliferative neoplastic lesion.\n\nMalignant transformation of olfactory epithelium (sustentacular cells, basal\ncells, immature sensory cells, and possibly ductal cells of Bowman\u2019s glands).\n\n(Dungworth et al. 1992;\nDungworth et al. 2001;\nRenne et al. 2009, see\nCarcinoma, neuroepithelial).\n\n\nArises from the olfactory epithelium.Frequently there is compartmentalization of sheets of neoplastic cells into\nlobules by fibrovascular septa.Small round or columnar cells with poorly defined, pale-staining\ncytoplasm.Round to oval, basally located nuclei that do not display marked\natypia.Distinct, sharply defined nuclear chromatin.True (Flexner-Wintersteiner) rosettes (tumor cells surround an open central\nlumen bounded by distinct cell membranes, mimicking glandular structures) or\npseudo (Homer-Wright) rosettes (tumor cells arranged in a circle around a\nsmall central lumen, which is filled with amorphous or tangled fibrillary\nmaterial) may be present. Frequency and morphology of rosette structures are\nhighly variable.Plexiform intercellular fibrils.Areas of anaplastic cells may be present.\n\n\nAdenocarcinoma:\n\n\nAbsence of rosettes or plexiform intercellular fibrils. A useful\ndistinguishing feature between true rosettes sometimes present in\nneuroepithelial carcinomas and the acinar spaces in adenocarcinomas is that\nin neuroepithelial carcinomas, the nuclei of cells forming the rosettes\nblend peripherally with the uniform population forming the rest of the\ntumor.\n\n\nNeuroepithelial carcinoma often invades the ethmoid bone and olfactory\nbulb/brain. Whether tumors arising from olfactory epithelium are more\nappropriately classified under the term neuroepithelial carcinoma or olfactory\nneuroblastoma cannot be resolved on the basis of current information, and they are\nconsidered synonyms in this manuscript. The general term neuroepithelial carcinoma\nis used here because it allows for origin of neoplasms from sensory or\nsustentacular cells, whereas olfactory neuroblastoma implies origin only from\nneurogenic components. There is clearly a need to develop procedures to\ndistinguish neuroepithelial tumors of neurogenic origin (neuroblastoma,\nesthesioneuroblastoma), from those of nonneurogenic cell types, especially\nsustentacular cells and their precursors. When neither rosettes (true or pseudo)\nnor plexiform intercellular fibrils are demonstrable, a diagnosis of\nadenocarcinoma is preferable. Ultrastructural analysis of a neuroepithelial\ncarcinoma should reveal some clear characteristics of olfactory epithelium such as\nolfactory vesicles, cilia, and microtubules. The histogenic relationship of\nBowman\u2019s glands to the other components of the nasal epithelium has not been\nclearly defined, but their origin is most likely not neurogenic. Therefore,\ncarcinomas originating from Bowman\u2019s glands should be classified with\nadenocarcinomas. Most cases of neuroepithelial carcinoma are negative for\nimmunohistochemical reactions with antibodies against intermediate filaments.\n\nVOM or SOM could be the site of origin of neuroepithelial carcinomas however it\ncould be difficult to allocate their origin to these miniature sites. For cases\nwhere the main olfactory epithelium is still intact this question should be\nraised.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nThe ear is the sensory organ of hearing and balance. The ear can be divided into three\nsegments, the external, middle, and inner ear. The middle and inner ear are only\ninfrequently assessed either grossly or microscopically in preclinical toxicity and\ncarcinogenicity studies with rodents used for safety assessment. However, the external ear\nis easily assessed during macroscopic examination, and is often sampled in carcinogenicity\nstudies when grossly identified masses are examined. The lesions of the external ear are\nlargely those of the skin and are reported with the integumentary system.\n\nThis INHAND document serves as a framework that can be used for the harmonization of\ndiagnostic criteria of otic lesions in laboratory rats and mice. These recommendations for\ndiagnostic criteria and preferred terminology should not be considered mandatory; proper\ndiagnoses are ultimately based on the discretion of the toxicologic study pathologist.\n\nThis document is organized to provide introductory material that reviews comparative\ninterspecies differences in anatomy and otic function, followed by a listing of middle and\ninner ear lesions in a standardized format. The otic lesion descriptions include\ndifferential diagnoses to aid in distinguishing primary diagnoses from similar appearing\nlesions. It should be noted that the preferred diagnostic terminology for some lesions in\nthis document might represent departures from traditional nomenclature schemes found in\nstandard textbooks. Furthermore, illustrative photomicrographs for a given diagnostic\nentity may occasionally depict additional tissue changes as this reflects actual\nsituations observed in evaluation of toxicity studies. In addition, for the complex\nstructures of the middle and inner ear, diagnostic terms should include anatomic locators\nwhenever possible (e.g., tympanic membrane, ossicles, round window niche, etc.).\n\nIn laboratory animal species, the ear can be divided into three compartments. The\nexternal ear includes the pinna and external ear canal. The tympanic membrane (\u201cear drum\u201d)\nis the barrier between the external ear canal and the middle ear. The middle ear consists\nof the tympanic cavity largely formed by the tympanic bulla and contains the three\nossicles, the incus, malleus, and stapes. The inner ear is comprised of the cochlea\n(engaged in hearing) and the vestibular apparatus (for balance). The vestibular apparatus\nincludes the bony and membranous labyrinths of the semicircular canals, the utricle, and\nthe saccule. The utricle and saccule are the otolith organs.\n\nThe acoustic meatus is the ear canal. The pinna makes up the external acoustic meatus. It\nis the outermost portion of the ear and is lined on the external surface by haired skin,\nand, on the internal surface, by sparsely haired to hairless skin. The pinna in some\nspecies such as rabbits or pigs has readily observable large veins, which are often used\nfor blood collection or even drug or test article administration. It has a supporting\ncartilage, which helps to maintain its shape. The internal acoustic meatus is the portion\nof the ear canal lined by the bony collar of the temporal bone. The ear canal in most\nspecies has an obtuse-angle turn external to this bony collar. The tympanic membrane is\nthe innermost margin of the ear canal. The pinna is easily assessed macroscopically at\nnecropsy, and the tympanic membrane also can be assessed reliably at necropsy with an\notoscope. The pinna and ear canal funnel sound waves to the tympanic membrane.\n\nThe middle and inner ear are not readily evaluated macroscopically, and therefore\ngenerally are not examined at necropsy in routine toxicology studies. The tympanic cavity\nis an air-filled space that extends into a ventral osseous expansion, the tympanic bulla,\nand contains the auditory ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes). The malleus (\u201chammer\u201d) is\nembedded broadly in the tympanic membrane and articulates with the incus (\u201canvil\u201d). The\nmalleus has muscular attachments to the wall of the tympanic wall. The incus articulates\nin turn with the stapes (\u201cstirrup\u201d); the footplate of the stapes lies in the oval window.\nSound waves that cause vibration of the tympanic membrane are transmitted to the oval\nwindow by the bridging middle ear ossicles. This mechanical apparatus amplifies the\ntransmitted vibrations, possibly providing an increase in magnitude of as much as 20-fold.\nTension on the muscular attachments to the malleus can be lessened by feedback innervation\nin response to high ambient noise levels, thereby dampening this amplification as a\nprotective mechanism. With a bit of patience and dissection, the ossicles can be evaluated\ngrossly, and their articulations and movement tested at necropsy. The auditory\n(pharyngotympanic or Eustachian) tube originates at the rostral (anterior) wall of the\ntympanic cavity and extends to the nasopharynx. It allows for drainage of fluid and\nnormalization of pressure across the tympanic membrane.\n\nThe cochlea lies on and is embedded in the petrous portion of the temporal bone which is\non the medial wall of the tympanic cavity. It is more prominent and projects into the\ntympanic cavity to a greater degree in chinchillas and guinea pigs than in rats or dogs,\nand is almost entirely contained within the temporal bone in primates. It appears as a\nspiral or \u201cbeehive\u201d in chinchillas and guinea pigs. The otic capsule is the bony external\nframe of the cochlea and is part of the temporal bone. The cochlea has the stapes\nfootplate embedded in the oval window, and the round window is readily visible as an\nadjacent, membrane-lined structure. The semicircular canals, utricle, and saccule are all\ncontained within temporal bone and so are not readily visible during gross\nexamination.\n\nThe pinna has a cutaneous lining on both the external and internal surfaces. In either\ncase, the dermis is thin. The auricular cartilage of the pinna is comprised of a\nfibrocartilaginous core. The lining of the ear canal changes as microscopic examination\nprogresses from the external areas toward the tympanic membrane. For example, in the\nrabbit, the more external areas have a thin epidermis and dermis with a paucity of hair\nfollicles. In the external ear canal just outside of the bony collar (i.e., at about the\nlevel of the obtuse-angle turn), the ear canal retains the thin epidermis but has a\ncircumferential zone containing sebaceous glands (ceruminous glands) but lacking hair\nfollicles. Within the internal acoustic meatus, defined by the presence of the bony\ncollar, the dermis is very thin to nonexistent with the epidermis almost lying upon the\ntemporal bone. However, a dermis of sorts is still present, and it can be expanded greatly\nwhen injured by congestion, hemorrhage, edema, and/or inflammation. The dermis and\nepidermis of the internal auditory meatus lack any adnexal structures. The epidermis\ncontinues seamlessly as the external squamous epithelial lining of the tympanic\nmembrane.\n\nRodents do not have multiple small ceruminous glands, which are simple sebaceous glands\nas observed in the rabbit, but instead have a relatively large compound sebaceous gland,\nthe Zymbal\u2019s or auditory sebaceous gland. This latter gland is located rostral and ventral\nto the ear, medial to the temporal bone. Like the ceruminous glands, it secretes sebaceous\nmaterial (\u201cear wax\u201d), which often also is referred to as cerumin.\n\nThe tympanic membrane is lined externally and internally by a thin, simple squamous\nepithelium. The stroma of the tympanic membrane has areas that are thin, fibrous and\ntightly stretched (typically found centrally) as well as areas closer to the periphery\nwhich are fleshy and highly vascularized. When conducting a histologic evaluation of the\ntympanic membrane in cross-section, these distinct areas should be recognized as normal.\nThe air-filled tympanic bulla is lined by a mucous membrane with epithelium varying from\ntall columnar with goblet cells to a thin squamous epithelium. The tall columnar regions\ntend to be in ventral areas and adjacent to the auditory tube. These epithelial cells line\nall surfaces, including the surfaces of the auditory ossicles. The auditory tube is lined\nby a columnar ciliated respiratory epithelium with goblet cells. The auditory tube is\nsupported by either bone, in segments extending from the tympanic cavity, to a\ncartilaginous collar as it nears the nasopharynx. In some species, there are bony \u201cstruts\u201d\nwithin the tympanic bulla that partially subdivide it. These are more prominent in\nchinchillas, which have large tympanic bullae, than in rats or dogs.\n\nThe inner ear (cochlea and vestibular apparatus) is composed of an osseous labyrinth, a\npart of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, which contains perilymph that surrounds\nthe membranous labyrinth. The stapes footplate rests within the oval window with\ncartilaginous surfaces forming a seal (oval window ligament). Movement of the oval window\ncauses movement of perilymph. The round window membrane is the \u201crelief valve\u201d that allows\nthe fluid waves to be propagated. Perilymph is exterior to the membranous labyrinth and\nmovement of perilymph causes movement of structures of the membranous labyrinth and the\nendolymph within the membranous labyrinth.\n\nThe inner ear begins with the vestibule which has further openings into the cochlea as\nwell as vestibular structures (the semicircular canals, utricle and saccule). The various\nelements of the vestibulocochlear apparatus of the inner ear serve three distinct sensory\nfunctions: the organ of Corti within the cochlea is integral to the sense of hearing, the\nsemicircular canals detect rotational motion via changes in fluid inertia, and the utricle\nand saccule detect linear motion via the effect of gravity on the otoliths embedded in an\notolithic membrane overlying sensory hair cells. The membranous labyrinth is contained\nwithin the encasing bony labyrinth.\n\nThe cochlea is a spiral-shaped structure that has 2.5 to 3.5 turns, depending on the\nmammalian species. Humans and rats have 2.5 turns, while chinchillas and guinea pigs have\n3.5 turns. The 3.5 turns are often referred to as apical, middle, and basal turns, while\nthe most basal part, the \u201chook\u201d, extends away from the spiral and into the vestibule and\ntoward the round window. The cochlear or otic capsule is part of the osseous labyrinth of\nthe inner ear. It is the hard external supporting structure of the cochlea and is part of\nthe temporal bone. The membranous labyrinth also continues within the inner ear as the\ncochlear duct and other cellular constituents.\n\nWhen histologically examined, the cochlea is normally sectioned in a mid-modiolar plane.\nThis is a longitudinal orientation containing the central supporting bony structures\n(modiolus) and cochlear nerve. When viewing the cochlea in cross-section in this\nmid-modiolar plane, there are three fluid-filled spaces in each turn: the scala tympani,\nscala vestibuli, and scala media (also known as the cochlear duct). The scala tympani and\nscala vestibuli are continuous, meeting at the most apical turn of the spiral at the\nhelicotrema. They both contain perilymph, which is similar to serum and cerebrospinal\nfluid in composition in that it is high in sodium (Na+) and low in potassium\n(K+). The scala media is located between the scala tympani and scala\nvestibuli and is separated from them apically by the Reissner\u2019s membrane and basally by\nthe organ of Corti and its cellular constituents. The scala media contains endolymph,\nwhich is high in K+ and low in Na+. The chemical potential\n(endocochlear potential), formed by the differential electrolyte concentrations between\nthe continuous canals of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani and the separate scala\nmedia, is essential for the function of the hair cells.\n\nWithin the scala media, on the basal membrane, lies the organ of Corti. This structure\nconsists of the inner and outer sensory hair cells and the associated supporting cells and\nmatrix. The inner hair cells normally occur as a single row running the length of the\nspiral of the scala media on the medial side. The outer hair cells occur as three rows\nlocated more laterally on the basilar membrane. Hair cells have arrays of stereocilia on\ntheir apical surfaces.\n\nThe inner hair cell is the true otic sensory cell. Deflection of the inner hair cell\u2019s\nstereocilia by sound-induced fluid waves traveling in the endolymph opens transduction ion\nchannels in the apical cell surface that allow influx of K+ ions into the cell\nfrom the endolymph and activates voltage-sensitive calcium (Ca++) channels and\nCa++-activated K+ channels in the lateral and basal membranes, in\nturn causing release of neurotransmitters at the base of the inner hair cell. The nerve\nfibers which synapse with the inner hair cell are bipolar neurons of the cochlear\n(auditory) nerve. The soma of each neuron is located in the spiral ganglion.\n\nThe outer hair cells also have arrays of stereocilia on their apical surfaces. Deflection\nof these stereocilia also causes ion channel opening and closing. The opening of ion\nchannels in these cells results in rapid changes in length and stiffening of the outer\nhair cell via the cytoskeleton and a prestin motor. These changes in the outer hair cells\namplify the extent of transduction at the inner hair cells. Inner and outer hair cells are\nterminally differentiated in mammals and thus do not proliferate and are not\nregenerated.\n\nWithin the scala media on the lateral wall is the stria vascularis and the spiral\nligament. The stria vascularis consists of three layers of cells, marginal cells,\nintermediate cells, and basal cells. The marginal cells have apical tight junctions,\nadherens junctions, and desmosomes, and are atypical for epithelial cells in that they\nlack a basement membrane. The marginal cells have membrane ion pumps and channels; in\nparticular, they pump Na+ out of the endolymph via\nNa+/K+-ATPases. Intermediate cells contain melanin, are derived from\nthe neural crest, and are sometimes referred to as melanocytes. Basal cells are adjacent\nto the more laterally located spiral ligament. These flat cells form a continuous layer.\nThey also have a dense network of junctional complexes, but lack\nNa+/K+-ATPases. Embedded within the stria vascularis is a\nprominent capillary bed. The stria vascularis is an important component of the\nblood-labyrinth barrier. The spiral ligament is a fibrous cushion located between the\nstria vascularis and the bony otic capsule. This ligament is primarily composed of\nconnective tissue, especially extracellular matrix and cells of mesodermal origin. The\nbasilar membrane is anchored laterally by the spiral ligament, and this anchoring may not\nbe passive in that the ligament contains tension fibroblasts. These cells have contractile\nproteins and may either generate or regulate the tension of the basilar membrane.\n\nThe dorsal (superior) aspect of the scala media is bounded by the Reissner\u2019s membrane,\nwhich completes the triangular borders of the scala media.\n\nSpecific sound frequencies are detected in particular portions of the organ of Corti. The\nbasal turns detect high frequency sounds, while the apical turns detect low frequency\nsounds.\n\nThe spiral ganglion is embedded within the modiolus and extends centrally as the cochlear\nnerve, which is a branch of the cranial nerve VIII. Each afferent nerve fiber synapses\nwith only one inner hair cell. However, each inner hair cell will synapse with multiple\nafferent nerve fibers. Also passing through the cochlear nerves are unmyelinated or poorly\nmyelinated efferent nerve fibers from the central auditory centers that synapse at inner\nand outer hair cells. Auditory pathways in the brain that may be of interest when\ninvestigating apparent deficits in hearing are the auditory nucleus and 8th\ncranial nerve roots in the brainstem as well as the caudal (inferior) colliculi and the\nmedial geniculate nuclei in the midbrain.\n\nThe saccule and utricle (otolith organs) of the vestibular apparatus are located within\nthe vestibule of the inner ear. These sac-like membranes are important for sensing\nlocation rather than appreciating sound. The saccule and utricle each have a placode of\ntissue located on one wall, referred to as the macula or otolith membrane. This macula is\nlined by hair cells and other supporting epithelial cells. Hair cells are innervated by\nfibers of the vestibular nerve (a branch of cranial nerve VIII), the neurons of which are\nlocated in the vestibular ganglion with projections to the vestibular nuclei and\ncerebellum. The surface of the macula has an adherent viscous gel in which the hair cells\nare embedded. Microliths (otoliths) are also entrapped within this gel. Being denser than\nthe surrounding gel and fluid, the microliths respond to gravity causing the stereocilia\non the hair cells to deflect and allows for sensation of vertical (saccule) or horizontal\n(utricle) motion.\n\nThe semicircular canals of the vestibular apparatus are membrane-lined bony canals. The\nmembranes have a single crista ampullaris in each canal that protrudes into the lumen.\nThese cristae ampullaris are mounds of loose connective tissue with overlying hair cells\nand supporting cells. The semicircular canals are roughly oriented in three distinct\nplanes representing unique X, Y, and Z axes, which allows for rotational sensation in all\ndirections. Nerve fibers of the vestibular nerve extend up through the loose connective\ntissue to synapse with the basal cytoplasm of the hair cells. The cupola is the gel-like\nmaterial on the luminal surface of the cristae in which the stereocilia of the hair cells\nare embedded. As the head is turned, inertia of the fluid within the semicircular canals\ncauses the stereocilia of the hair cells to flex, thereby allowing the detection of\nmotion.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nRupture, typmpanic membrane.\n\nPerforation of the tympanic membrane may be traumatic from a penetrating\nforeign object or may follow necrosis of the tympanic membrane.\n\n\nThe tympanic membrane is discontinuous, which must be differentiated\nfrom artifact of sectioning or histologic processing.If a true perforation, depending on chronicity, there may be\nhemorrhage, inflammation, hyperplasia of tympanic membrane epithelium,\nhemosiderin deposition, or fibrosis.\n\n\nArtifact of sectioning or histologic processing\n\nPerforation of the tympanic membrane may be due to multiple causes. Often it\nis due to trauma or inflammation or both. Some locally administered test\narticles may inhibit healing such that transtympanic injections may be slow to\nheal or fail to heal.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nThere are several causes of inflammatory conditions affecting chondrocytes of\nthe pinna (see comments below).\n\n\nGranulomatous inflammation is centered on cartilage of the pinna.Cartilage may have regenerative hyperplasia.Bone formation within the cartilage may occur.\n\n\n\nChondroma; OsteomaOtitis externa\n\n\nAuricular cartilage inflammation is both a naturally occurring and inducible\ncondition. Spontaneous auricular cartilage inflammation occurs in various rat\nstrains, including Sprague-Dawley and fawn-hooded rats. Induction of auricular\ncartilage inflammation may be achieved by intradermal injection of type II\ncollagen, suggesting that it is an autoimmune disease (Chiu 1991; Kitagaki et al. 2003).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nThere are several causes of inflammatory conditions affecting the epithelium\nof the epidermis or adnexa (see comments below).\n\n\nInflammation is centered on the epithelium or adnexa of the external\near canal as part of an irritant process in response to locally\nadministered test articles.\n\n\nInflammation, auricular cartilage\n\nMany of the changes of the external ear canal (spontaneous or test article\ninduced) are similar to that of the skin.

Mineralization may be\nconfirmed with von Kossa stain.May be associated with epithelial necrosis, foreign body reaction and\nscarring.\n\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nEpithelium lining the tympanic bulla.\n\n\nCells are necrotic and slough into the lumen with exposure of the\nunderlying propria.Secondary changes like inflammation, hyperplasia, fibroplasia, etc. may\nbe present.\n\n\nNone.\n\nAn irritant in the tympanic bulla may produce necrosis of the epithelium.\nSince it is normally a single layer thick, it may be considered an ulcer\n(Schafer and Bolon\n2013).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nOsteonecrosis.\n\nOsteocytes of the tympanic bulla.\n\n\nNuclei in the lacuna of the bones of the tympanic bulla are absent.\n\n\nNone.\n\nSevere irritants instilled into the external ear canal or into the middle ear\ncan produce necrosis of the bone.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nCoagulative necrosis.\n\nAll layers of the tympanic membrane.\n\nNone.\n\nSevere irritants instilled into the external ear canal or into the middle ear\ncan produce necrosis of the tympanic membrane. Necrosis is often accompanied\nby inflammation.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nLeukocytes recruited from the systemic circulation. The pathogenesis is\nuncertain, but presumably a self-limiting response designed for immune\nsurveillance and minor tissue repair activities.\n\n\nFoci of single inflammatory cell type or a mixture of different cell\ntypes without other features of inflammation.Infiltrates may be neutrophil, macrophage, foamy macrophage,\nmononuclear cell, or mixed cell populations.\n\n\nInflammation:\n\n\nInflammatory cellular infiltrate with possible edema, congestion,\nhemorrhage, and/or necrosis.\n\n\n\u2018Infiltrate\u2019 is the preferred term, followed by the predominant cell type\n(neutrophilic, eosinophilic, lymphocytic, plasmacytic, histiocytic, or foamy\nmacrophages) or mixture of different cell types (mixed). Infiltrates resolve\nwithout residual damage to the otic tissues. Foamy macrophages in small\nnumbers may be observed as a spontaneous background change in the tympanic\nbulla lumen, but will be increased in number and more prominent with\ntranstympanically injected drug and/or vehicle.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nOtitis media.\n\nThe inflammation affects the mucosa lining the tympanic bulla. Neutrophils,\nlymphocytes, and/or macrophages infiltrate into tissues or spaces in response\nto an irritant or infectious process.\n\n\nThe propria of the mucosa of the tympanic bulla is expanded by edema\nand/or infiltrating inflammatory cells.Migration of inflammatory cells into the bulla lumen may occur.\n\n\nNone.\n\nMay have necrosis of associated tissues. Inflammation of the middle ear may\nbe induced by instillation of irritating substances, but also occur\nspontaneously (Verdaguer et\nal. 2006). Inflammation in the middle ear is often due to a breach or\ncompromise in the natural barriers of the middle ear, although spontaneous\ninfections are relatively frequent. The specific location within the middle\near should be designated with anatomic locators whenever possible (e.g.,\ntympanic membrane, ossicles, round window niche, etc.).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nOtitis media, catarrhal; mucous hyperplasia/metaplasia.\n\nMucus production by the epithelium lining the tympanic bulla.\n\n\nAccumulation of relatively cell-free fluid and mucous material is\npresent in the tympanic bulla space.\n\n\nEdema\n\nInflammation, middle ear\n\nCatarrhal inflammation is usually accompanied by metaplasia of the epithelium\nof the tympanic bulla to include numerous goblet cells. Low numbers of\nexfoliated epithelial cells may be part of the alteration (Schafer and Bolon\n2013).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nEpithelial hyperplasia, tympanic bulla mucosa.\n\nEpithelium lining the tympanic bulla.\n\n\nThe epithelium lining the tympanic bulla has a stratified squamous\nmorphology.The epithelium may or may not be keratinizing.\n\n\nNone.\n\nThe epithelium lining the tympanic bulla is a simple squamous epithelium in\nmost areas with simple cuboidal to simple columnar epithelium in the most\ndependent areas (ventral). The epithelium can undergo squamous metaplasia as\nan adaptive, protective change in response to an irritant or infectious\nprocess and may be associated with inflammation.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nEpithelium lining the tympanic bulla.\n\n\nThe epithelium lining the tympanic bulla consists of tall cuboidal to\ncolumnar cells.May include numerous goblet cells.\n\n\nNone.\n\nThe epithelium lining the tympanic bulla is normally a simple squamous\nepithelium in most areas with simple cuboidal to simple columnar epithelium in\nthe most dependent areas (ventral). Alterations may be induced by a mild\nirritant in the inner ear, e.g. slightly acidic solutions. The epithelium can\nundergo cuboidal or columnar metaplasia as an adaptive, protective change in\nresponse to an irritant or infectious process and may be associated with\ninflammation. The most ventral aspect of the tympanic bulla will often have\ncuboidal to columnar epithelium normally.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nProliferation of fibroblasts and deposition of loose connective tissue in the\npropria of the mucosa of the tympanic bulla.\n\n\nThe tympanic bulla propria is expanded by loose connective tissue with\nminimal collagen production.\n\n\nEdema\n\nFibrosis is usually accompanied by inflammation and represents a protective\nmechanism.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nProliferation of fibroblasts and deposition of loose connective tissue in the\npropria of the mucosa of the tympanic bulla in combination with edema,\nvascular proliferation, and sometimes new bone formation. The mucosa of the\ntypamic bulla may be expanded by pseudoglands.\n\n\nThe tympanic bulla propria is expanded by loose connective tissue with\nminimal collagen production, edema, and vascular proliferation.\n\n\nEdema, Fibrosis\n\nGranulation tissue is usually accompanied by inflammation and represents a\nprotective mechanism, often in reaction to a chronic irritant in the middle\near.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nReaction of mucosa to foreign material in the tympanic bulla.\n\n\nInfiltrates consist of epithelioid macrophages, multinucleated giant\ncells and lymphocytes.May have abundant necrotic cells and debris and neutrophils.May fill large portions of the tympanic bulla.\n\n\nInflammation, middle ear\n\nCholesteatoma\n\nOften occurs as a response to foreign body gaining entry via a ruptured\ntympanic membrane or as a reaction against materials administered via a\ncannula. Inert material may result in accumulation of foamy macrophages.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nUlceration or necrosis of the mucosa may expose the underlying propria and\nresult in bleeding into the lumen. Rupture of the tympanic membrane may\ndisrupt the vessels of the membrane and produce hemorrhage as well. Severe\nirritants may produce hemorrhage of the propria of the tympanic bulla.\n\n\nBlood is present in the tympanic bulla space or in the propria of the\ntympanic bulla.Secondary changes of pigment deposition, fibroplasia etc. may be\npresent.\n\n\nNone.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nLeakage of fluid into the propria.\n\n\nThe propria of the middle ear is expanded by pale staining fluid.\n\n\nHemorrhage\n\nEdema is usually accompanied by epithelial and inflammatory changes. It may\noccur with administration of saline alone.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nEpithelium lining the tympanic bulla.\n\n\nThe epithelium forms cystic structures.Cysts contain nonstaining fluid or mucoid material and cell debris.Cysts most likely occur in the ventral aspects of the tympanic\nbulla.\n\n\nCholesteatoma\n\nNone.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nThe tympanic membrane squamous epithelium forms an expansive mass. It may be\nthe result of a trauma.\n\n\nA squamous cyst is present in the tympanic bulla.May contain cholesterol clefts from the degenerating cell membranes or\nprevious hemorrhage.May be associated with granulomatous inflammation.\n\n\nTympanic membrane Cyst\n\nCholesteatomas occur on the medial side of the tympanic membrane. They may be\npedunculated or occur as a polyplike structure, and may progressively enlarge\nwith time. Cholesteatomas can be induced by irritants or surgical ligation of\nthe external ear canal (Hottendorf\n1991; McGinn et al.\n1982, Steinbach and Gr\u00fcninger 1980).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nTympanic bulla or middle ear ossicles.\n\nOsteopenia.\n\nOsteoclasts.\n\n\nThe tympanic bulla or middle ear ossicles have scalloping of margins\nand thinning of the bone.\n\n\nNone.\n\nThe atrophy of the bone may be the consequence of an inflammatory process\nthat encapsulates the ossicles as a reaction to a nonspecific irritant.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nHyperostosis; Osteosclerosis.\n\nOsteoblasts.\n\n\nThe tympanic bulla is thickened, often with a prominent \u201cwatermark\u201d\ndelineating the newly deposited woven bone.In some instances, there may be sharp spicules of new bone formation\nthat extends into exudates in the tympanic bulla.\n\n\nNone.\n\nThe new bone formation is usually the consequence of an irritant that induces\na chronic-active inflammatory process that results in persistent exudate in\nthe tympanic bulla.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nCrista ampullaris.\n\nDecreased number, hair cell\n\nHair cells of crista ampullaris.\n\n\nThe surface epithelium is disorganized and may show vacuolation.Pyknotic debris may be visible within the epithelium.\n\n\nHair cell necrosis\n\nOften there is evidence of both degeneration and necrosis present in the\nepithelium of the crista ampullaris. Alterations may be induced by macrolide\nantibiotics and other intoxicants (Ibrahim et al. 2014; Schafer & Bolon 2013).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nCochlea or cristae ampullaris.\n\nInjury to the outer or inner hair cells of the organ of Corti or cristae\nampullaris.\n\n\nHair cells are absent and replaced by large, non-descript, swollen\ncells.In more chronic instances, these large cells will shrink and form a low\ncuboidal layer lining the scala media where the inner and outer hair\ncells should be in the organ of Corti.\n\n\nHair cell necrosis\n\nDegeneration, hair cells (cochlea or crista ampullaris)\n\nHair cell necrosis, depending on the insult, may occur fairly rapidly in the\ncourse of a toxicology study such that the process of hair cell necrosis is\nnot observed, only the end result (hair cell loss is no longer active).\nBecause the hair cell necrosis appears to be an apoptotic process, there is\ngenerally not residual inflammation present unless the test article applied to\nthe middle/inner ear was a severe irritant producing generalized inflammation\nand necrosis of the tissues of the cochlea. (Schafer & Bolon 2013).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nCochlea or cristae ampullaris.\n\nInjury to the outer or inner hair cells of the organ of Corti or the hair\ncells at the apex of the crista ampullaris.\n\n\nCells are shrunken with eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic,\nkaryorrhectic, or karyolytic nuclei (consistent with apoptosis).\n\n\nHair cell loss\n\nHair cell necrosis due to specific ototoxicants (in contrast to non-specific\nirritants) tends to be apoptotic necrosis. Macrolide antibiotics such as\ngentamicin will produce this change (Schafer & Bolon 2013).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nOval window footplates.\n\nChondronecrosis.\n\nChondrocytes.\n\n\nNuclei in the lacuna of the cartilage of the footplates of the stapes\nand the corresponding rim of the oval window are absent.\n\n\nNone.\n\nSevere irritants instilled into the middle ear can produce necrosis of the\ncartilage of the stapes and round window.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nVestibular organ hair cells/epithelium or entire organ.\n\n\nWith specific ototoxicants, there may be shrunken, eosinophilic\nepithelial cells with pyknotic, karyorrhectic, karyolytic nuclei.With nonspecific irritants, there may be coagulative necrosis of all\ncells of the vestibular organ.\n\n\nDegeneration of vestibular organ\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nNeuronal cell bodies of spiral or vestibular ganglion.\n\n\nThe neurons of the ganglia are shrunken and with hypereosinophilic\ncytoplasm.\n\n\nDark neuron artifact\n\nWith sufficient time, a dying back process due to loss of hair cells of the\norgan of Corti, the crista ampullaris, or the vestibular organ will result in\nloss of connections and loss of neurons. Due to the normal variability of\ndensity of ganglion cells in the spiral ganglion, it is difficult to diagnose\nloss of ganglion cells without observation of active necrosis. Further details\ncan be found in proliferative and nonproliferative lesions of the rat and\nmouse central and peripheral nervous system (Kaufmann et al. 2012, see\nIntroduction).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nVestibular nerve, cochlear nerve, or vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII).\n\n\nEarly stage lesions include axonal swelling and eosinophilia.Late stage lesions include axonal fragmentation and formation of\ndigestion chambers within the nerve.\n\n\nNone.\n\nWith sufficient time, a dying back process due to loss of hair cells of the\norgan of Corti, the crista ampullaris, or the vestibular organ will result in\nloss of connections and loss of neurons and subsequent loss of axons that\nextend to the brain. Further details can be found in proliferative and\nnonproliferative lesions of the rat and mouse central and peripheral nervous\nsystem (Kaufmann et al.\n2012, see Introduction).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nFibrocytes of the spiral limbus, fibrocytes of the spiral ligament,\nepithelial cells of the stria vascularis.\n\n\nThe cell density is decreased when compared to concurrent controls.\n\n\nNecrosis, neuronal\n\nLoss of cellularity of the spiral limbus will often follow hair cell loss,\npresumably by a feedback mechanism, although of currently unknown mechanism.\nThe loss of cells of the spiral ligament may be a specific toxicity or may be\na consequence of injury to the overlying stria vascularis. The stria\nvascularis may be injured by various toxicants and have loss of cells of the\ninner, intermediate, or outer layers (Schafer and Bolon 2013).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nGanglion cells, spiral ganglion.\n\n\nThe cell density is decreased when compared to concurrent controls.\n\n\nNecrosis, neuronal\n\nLoss of cellularity of the spiral ganglion should be made with extreme\ncaution. The spiral ganglion has wide variability in cellular density from the\napex to the base. This variability makes identification of cell loss difficult\nin the absence of other markers of change (ganglion cell necrosis or axonal\ndegeneration of the cochlear nerve. Careful comparison of the same areas of\nthe spiral ganglion between controls and treated animals need to be done to\nmake this diagnosis (Schafer and Bolon 2013).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nHair cell or supporting cell injury in the organ of Corti.\n\n\nHair cells or supporting cells are vacuolated.Loss of hair cells with replacement by supporting cells may have\npallor, hydropic change, or vacuolation of the supporting cells.\n\n\nHair cell necrosis\n\nHair cell loss\n\nDegeneration, hair cells\n\nHistologic processing will often produce an artifactual vacuolation of the\nsupporting cells of the organ of Corti, including cells of Hensen, cells of\nBoettcher, and others that must be distinguished from a toxic insult (Schafer and Bolon\n2013).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nEpithelial cells of the stria vascularis.\n\n\nSwelling and vacuolation is present in individual cells of the stria\nvascularis.\n\n\nNone.\n\nInjury to the stria vascularis, which is critical in maintaining an\nelectropotential across the inner ear, will often manifest by swelling. This\nmay be intracellular (hydropic change) or extracellular (edema) (Schafer and Bolon\n2013).\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nOtitis interna.\n\nInfiltrates of inflammatory cells are present in various spaces of the inner\near. This may be accompanied by readily apparent proteinaceous exudates, or the\nexudate may be the sole change.\n\n\nInflammatory cells (often neutrophils, but may include macrophages, giant\ncells, and lymphocytes) accumulate in the fluid spaces of the scala\nvestibuli, scala tympani, and/or scala media or within the soft tissues\nlining the cochlea (spiral ligament, stria vascularis, etc).\n\n\nSerous exudation\n\nSuppurative inflammation\n\nPyogranulomatous inflammation\n\nGranulomatous inflammation\n\nInfiltrates of inflammatory cells are usually a reflection of injury by a\nnonspecific irritant. The inflammation can secondarily injure important\nstructural components of the inner ear such as the hair cells and stria\nvascularis. The inflammation could potentially be due to infectious agents,\nwhich need to be distinguished from an injury by a toxic insult.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nRound window, scala vestibuli, scala media, and/or scala tympani.\n\nFibroblasts of the membranes.\n\nNone.\n\nThe fibrosis of these membranes is usually due to nonspecific irritants; this\nchange would be anticipated to deaden vibrations.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nVestibular organ.\n\nOtolith epithelium.\n\n\nOtoliths contained within the gel lining the surface of the vestibular\norgan are misaligned, disrupted, or absent.\n\n\nNone.\n\nThe loss of otoliths is likely an effect on the underlying epithelium that\nmaintains the gel matrix.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nRound window membrane, scala vestibuli, scala media, and or scala tympani.\n\nInjury to the lining epithelium of the various tissues.\n\n\nLoose expansion of the mucosa of the spaces adjacent to the otic capsule\nor modiolus is present.\n\n\nFibrosis\n\nWith an irritant, the submembranous spaces adjacent to the bone are expanded by\nfluid, likely as a consequence of injury to the lining epithelium.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nHemorrhage likely arises from the stria vascularis, if in the scala media, and\nfrom the mucosa lining the wall, if in the scala tympani and/or scala\nvestibuli.\n\n\nBlood is present within the scala vestibuli, scala tympani, and/or scala\nmedia.\n\n\nArtifactual spillage of blood during sectioning or trimming.\n\nMouse; Rat.\n\nHyperostosis; Osteoscerosis.\n\nOsteoblasts.\n\n\nThe cochlea has increased bone formation of the internal surfaces.\n\n\nNone.\n\nNew bone formation is usually the consequence of a chronic irritant or severe\ntoxicity to the inner ear.\n\nThere are no proliferative lesions that are unique to the external ear. Terms for\nthe integument lining the external ear are described in the publication of\nproliferative and nonproliferative lesions of the rat and mouse integument (see\nIntroduction, Mecklenburg et al.\n2013).\n\nTerms for Zymbal\u2019s glands are described in the publication of Proliferative and\nNonproliferative Lesions of the Rat and Mouse Mammary, Zymbal\u2019s, Preputial, and\nClitoral Glands (see Introduction, Rudmann et al. 2012).\n\nProliferative lesions of the middle ear are largely a response to irritants or\nassociated with inflammation and are described in the preceding sections on\nnonproliferative lesions. Neoplastic lesions of the middle ear are not described in\nthe literature for rodents, and any neoplastic changes observed there would be\nanticipated to resemble those described for soft tissues (see Introduction, Greaves et al. 2013) or bone and\nare described in those respective publications.\n\nProliferative lesions of the inner ear are not described in the literature for\nrodents. However, tumors that might be anticipated to occur would likely arise from\nthe neural or soft tissues and would be consistent with those described in those\nrespective publications (see Introduction, Kaufmann et al. 2012; see Introduction, Greaves et al. 2013)."}
