{"title": "9-O-Acetylation of sialic acids is catalysed by CASD1 via a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate", "body": "Human CASD1 encodes a multimembrane spanning protein of 797 amino acids. For residues 83\u2013290, homology modelling predicted a GDSL/SGNH-like \u03b1/\u03b2-fold that forms the scaffold for a catalytic triad composed of S94, D270 and H273, with S94 as part of a conserved GDS sequence motif (Fig. 1a). The acronyms of the family name GDSL/SGNH reflect the presence of four invariant residues, namely S in a GDS(L) motif, G located after strand S2, N placed in a GxND motif after strand S3 and H found in a DxxH motif N-terminal to the last helix38. However, the N-terminal domain of CASD1 differs from the canonical GDSL/SGNH fold by lacking the conserved residues G and N, and is therefore grouped into pfam family PF13839 (GDSL/SGNH-like acyl-esterase family found in Pmr5 and Cas1p)39.\n\nTo analyse the subcellular localization and topology of CASD1, a full-length variant, containing an N-terminal V5 and a C-terminal Myc epitope, was expressed in the murine fibroblast cell line LM-TK\u2212. The orientation of the epitope tags was determined by selective membrane permeabilization and immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 1b,c). Under conditions that allowed antibody access to all cellular compartments (0.2% Triton X-100), both tags were detectable and showed co-localization with the Golgi marker \u03b1-mannosidase II (\u03b1-Man II). Selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane with low concentrations of digitonin (5 \u03bcg ml\u22121) allowed visualization of the N-terminal V5-tag, but not the C-terminal Myc-tag, demonstrating cytosolic and luminal orientation of N- and C-terminus, respectively. The integrity of the Golgi membrane was demonstrated by parallel staining with an antibody specific for the luminal domain of \u03b1-Man II40. Staining was observed exclusively in Triton X-100, but not in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Identical results were obtained on staining with an antibody against the SGNH-like domain of CASD1 (pAb 500), demonstrating that this domain faces the Golgi lumen (Fig. 1c). On the basis of these results and on our predictions for the CASD1 transmembrane domains (Supplementary Fig. 1), we propose a topology model encompassing a luminal catalytic domain flanked by one N-terminal and 12 C-terminal transmembrane domains (Fig. 1a).\n\nTo analyse the enzymatic activity of CASD1 in vitro, we generated a construct that allowed the expression of a soluble secreted form of CASD1 (termed sCASD1), which encompassed the SGNH-like luminal domain and a C-terminal Myc-His6-tag (Fig. 2a\u2013c). This form was produced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells, either as wild-type variant (sCASD1-wt) or as active site serine mutant (sCASD1-S94A). Affinity purified proteins were then used as an enzyme source for in vitro assays. First, we analysed whether sCASD1 possesses esterase activity, since the GDSL/SGNH fold is usually found among hydrolytic enzymes38, including the sialate 9-O-acetylesterase of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and the sialate 9-O-acetylesterase domains of the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins of influenza C and bovine coronavirus (BCoV)414243. However, under conditions that displayed high O-acetyltransferase activity for BCoV-HE, no activity was observed for sCASD1-wt, neither towards the synthetic acetylesterase substrate para-nitrophenylacetate (pNP-acetate; Fig. 2d) nor towards natural O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates (not shown). Thus, while the N-terminal luminal domain of CASD1 displays the characteristic fold of an esterase39, it does not appear to function as such. We therefore tested whether sCASD1 might catalyse the reverse reaction and act as a SOAT. Indeed, in the presence of [3H]acetyl-CoA, sCASD1-wt showed acetyltransferase activity, resulting in the formation of radiolabelled protein, even in the absence of acceptor substrates (Fig. 2e). No radioactive incorporation was seen in parallel experiments with the mutant sCASD1-S94A, demonstrating that the observed acetyl transfer was enzyme catalysed. SOAT activity of sCASD1 towards its own N-glycans was improbable. Although sCASD1 is N-glycosylated (Fig. 2c), glycoproteins that are produced in Sf9 cells typically bear pauci mannosidic N-glycans lacking penultimate galactose and terminal Sia residues44. Consequently, we asked whether sCASD1 can catalyse the formation of a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate that could be trapped in the absence of acceptor substrate. Therefore, purified sCASD1 was incubated in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA, digested with trypsin and analysed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). After incubation of sCASD1-wt with acetyl-CoA, the peptide containing the active site residue S94 (87-HIAFIGDSR-95) occurred as a mixed population of unmodified and modified peptide with a mass shift of 42 Da (shift by m/z=21 for the doubly charged ion), consistent with the formation of an acetyl adduct (Fig. 2f; note that the sequence of the peptides was confirmed by tandem MS/MS; see Supplementary Fig. 2). Analysis of the peak areas in the extracted ion chromatograms revealed that about 19% of the peptide population was acetylated (Supplementary Fig. 3). In parallel experiments with sCASD1-S94A, only the respective unmodified peptide (87-HIAFIGDAR-95) was found (Fig. 2f; Supplementary Figs 2 and 3), indicating that the hydroxyl group of S94 serves as attachment site for the acetyl group.\n\nTo test SOAT activity, purified sCASD1 was incubated with acetyl-CoA and Sia-containing acceptor substrates. After the reaction, Sia was released by acidic hydrolysis to allow derivatization with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxy-benzene (DMB) at the free reducing end. The obtained fluorescent Sia derivatives were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Fig. 3a-e). SOAT activity was clearly detected towards CMP-Neu5Ac (as indicated by an additional peak in the HPLC profile, which eluted at the same retention time as DMB-derivatized 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac (Neu5,9Ac2) of the reference panel; see Fig. 3a,c). The additional peak was not detected in samples obtained from parallel reactions without enzyme (Fig. 3b) or from reactions with sCASD1-S94A (Fig. 3d). Compared with free Neu5Ac or sialoglycoconjugates, CMP-Neu5Ac was by far the best acceptor substrate (Fig. 3e). The identity of the product peak obtained with CMP-Neu5Ac was confirmed by LC-ESI-MS/MS, which showed the expected parent ion mass of DMB-labelled mono-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and a fragmentation pattern characteristic for DMB-Neu5,9Ac2 (ref. 45; Fig. 3f,g). Together, these data demonstrate that the isolated SGNH-like domain of CASD1 displays SOAT activity in vitro and transfers acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to CMP-Neu5Ac, resulting in the formation of CMP-Neu5,9Ac2.\n\nTo study the enzymatic function of CASD1 in a cellular context, we first screened for a mammalian cell line that lacks O-acetylated sialoglycans. As a detection tool, we made use of the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of BCoV. BCoV uses 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans as host cell receptors and the HE contains both a lectin domain and a receptor-destroying sialate 9-O-acetylesterase domain4246. Inactivation of the esterase activity by S40A mutation (HE0) and fusion to the Fc part of human IgG gave rise to a soluble virolectin (BCoV-HE0-Fc) that selectively recognizes 9-O-acetylated Sias42, as confirmed by glycan array screening47. Immunofluorescence analysis with BCoV-HE0-Fc revealed that several mammalian cell lines express 9-O-acetylated sialoglycotopes exclusively in the Golgi apparatus (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the underlying carrier structures were N- and O-glycans, since blocking O-glycosylation sufficiently abrogated 9-O-acetylation only in cells that additionally lacked complex and hybrid N-glycans (Supplementary Fig. 5).\n\nImportantly, all cell lines that were positive for 9-O-acetylation were also positive for CASD1 transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 4b). In fact, we found only a single cell line, the murine fibroblast cell line LM-TK\u2212, that was devoid of both (Supplementary Fig. 4). Transfection of this naturally occurring O-Ac-negative cell line with CASD1 complementary DNA (cDNA), but not empty vector, led to the formation of Golgi-resident 9-O-acetylated sialoglycotopes as shown by virolectin staining (Fig. 4a). De-O-acetylation, by either alkali treatment or the sialate 9-O-acetylesterase activity of BCoV-HE, completely abolished the virolectin signals and was used as specificity control (Fig. 4a). After stable expression of wild-type CASD1, 9-O-acetylated sialoglycotopes were detected in all cells and co-localized with the Golgi marker \u03b1-Man II and Golgi-localized V5-tagged CASD1 (Fig. 4b). Introduction of the S94A exchange into full-length CASD1 (CASD1-S94A) resulted in a loss of function. Although the mutant protein was expressed and localized to the Golgi, virolectin staining was seen only in <1% of the cells (Fig. 4c). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that CASD1 mediates sialate 9-O-acetylation in LM-TK\u2212 cells and that this function is impaired by alanine exchange of S94.\n\nTo confirm that CASD1 plays a crucial role in the formation of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans, we generated a CASD1 knockout in the near-haploid human cell line HAP1 using the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated 9) system48. The obtained knockout cell line (HAP1\u0394CASD1) harbours a 16-bp frame shift mutation in exon 3 of CASD1, allowing only the production of a truncated polypeptide that already lacks S94, the most N-terminally located residue of the catalytic triad (Fig. 5a-c). Whereas parental HAP1 cells expressed 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans in the Golgi apparatus, 9-O-acetylation was completely lost in HAP1\u0394CASD1 cells (Fig. 5d). This was further confirmed by DMB-HPLC analysis revealing the presence of DMB-derivatized Neu5,9Ac2 in parental but not in HAP1\u0394CASD1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6). Transfection with CASD1 cDNA, but not empty vector, resulted in successful complementation of the loss-of-function defect and restored 9-O-acetylation of Golgi-localized sialoglycotopes (Fig. 5e). Of note, a genetic knockout carried out in parallel in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells showed the same outcome (Supplementary Fig. 7) and thus provided independent evidence for the essential role of CASD1 in Sia 9-O-acetylation.\n\nOn the basis of HAP1 and HAP1\u0394CASD1 cells, we next explored the role of CASD1 in the 9-O-acetylation of gangliosides such as GD3. To do so, we made use of a set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that distinguish between GD3 (CD60a) and 9-O-acetylated GD3 (CD60b). HAP1 cells lack GD3 but can generate the disialo ganglioside after expression of the sialyltransferase ST8Sia I (Fig. 6a; mAb R24). ST8Sia I converts GM3 to GD3 by adding an \u03b12,8-linked Sia residue, which in turn can carry an O-acetyl group in C9 position (Fig. 6c)49. In HAP1 wild-type cells, expression of ST8Sia I resulted in the formation of both CD60a and CD60b antigens, as shown by additional staining with mAb UM4D4 (Fig. 6a). As described for other anti-CD60b antibodies, UM4D4 recognizes 9-O-acetylated GD3 and similar gangliosides possessing a terminal 9-O-acetylated disialo group such as 9-O-acetylated disialo neolactotetraosylceramide and 9-O-acetylated disialo neolactohexaosylceramide (see Supplementary Fig. 8c for details on ganglioside structures)50. However, binding of mAb UM4D4 strictly relies on the O-acetylation of the carbohydrate epitope and no cross-reactivity towards the unmodified epitope is seen (see refs 50, 51 and Supplementary Fig. 8b). Newly synthesized CD60a and CD60b epitopes were both detected at the cell surface, as demonstrated by respective signals on non-permeabilized cells. In HAP1\u0394CASD1 cells, expression of ST8Sia I alone led to the formation of GD3 (Fig. 6b; mAb R24) but not 9-O-Ac-GD3 or other 9-O-acetylated gangliosides of the neolacto series (Fig. 6b; mAb UM4D4). Ganglioside modification was only detected after co-expression of ST8Sia I with CASD1, demonstrating that CASD1 is crucial for the formation of 9-O-acetylated CD60b epitopes (Fig. 6b; middle images). Again, alanine exchange of the active site residue S94 drastically impaired CASD1 function (Fig. 6b; right images).\n\nThe critical role of CASD1 for the formation of 9-O-acetylated CD60b epitopes was further confirmed in HEK293T wt and HEK293T\u0394CASD1 cells by immunofluorescence and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, whereas no indication for the presence of 7-O-acetylated disialo gangliosides was found (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b).\n\nHere we define CASD1 as the key factor for Sia 9-O-acetylation, the most common Sia modification in humans. Pivotal to our study was the observation that mammalian cell lines frequently express 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans in the Golgi apparatus, even if 9-O-acetylation of cell surface glycans is non-detectable. This phenomenon, described only by one previous study37, highlights that 9-O-acetylation is much more common than anticipated from cell surface staining. The finding that Golgi-confined 9-O-acetylated Sias were attached to N- and O-glycans suggests Golgi-resident glycoproteins as underlying carriers and interestingly, 9-O-acetylated Sia was recently found on the N-glycans of a human sialyltransferase52.\n\nAs shown for HAP1 and HEK293T cells, CASD1 is essential and sufficient for Golgi-confined 9-O-acetylation. However, 9-O-acetylation of cell surface molecules such as GD3 and similar disialo gangliosides required the additional expression of ST8Sia I. This indicates that parental HAP1 cells lack detectable cell surface 9-O-acetylation, because cell surface sialoglycotopes amenable to 9-O-acetylation are either absent or present in very low quantities. Regulation of cell surface 9-O-acetylation by the action of specific sialyltransferases is consistent with data from CHO cells, showing that cell surface 9-O-acetylation could be induced by ST8Sia I or ST6Gal I, two sialyltransferases that are normally not expressed in CHO cells53.\n\nOur in vitro data establish that sCASD1, a soluble CASD1 variant encompassing only the SGNH-like domain, transfers acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to CMP-Neu5Ac, the donor substrate of all sialyltransferases. Although the situation may be more complex in vivo, this result suggests that CASD1 may not directly 9-O-acetylate sialoglycoconjugates, but instead provides 9-O-acetylated CMP-Neu5Ac (CMP-Neu5,9Ac2) for sialyltransferases. In this scenario, the sialyltransferases would play a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates that carry 9-O-acetylated Sia. In support of this, CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 was detected in bovine submandibular glands54 and biochemical data obtained with human colon mucosa showed a Golgi-associated SOAT activity that utilized CMP-Neu5Ac as acceptor and a sialyltransferase activity that transferred 9-O-acetylated Sia from CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 to endogenous and exogenous acceptors3355. Moreover, the use of CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 has been shown for several sialyltransferases and is exploited for chemo-enzymatic synthesis of 9-O-acetylated sialosides56. In vivo, the efficient and selective usage of CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 may rely on a physical interaction between CASD1 and specific sialyltransferases.\n\nAlthough our data demonstrates that CASD1 mediates 9-O-acetylation, we cannot rule out the possibility that the enzyme initially transfers the acetyl group to the C7 position of Sia followed by migration to position C9 in a non-enzymatic step. Even under physiological conditions, O-acetyl groups at the Sia side chain can spontaneously migrate from C7 and C8 to an unsubstituted hydroxyl group at position C9, where the O-acetyl group is more stable5758. Moreover, 7-O-Ac-specific SOAT activity has been detected in several tissues315960 and studies on microsomal fractions from bovine submandibular glands provided evidence for an enzyme that accelerates the migration of O-acetyl groups from C7 to C9 in vivo59. In line with previous studies on 7-O-Ac-specific SOAT activity, Arming et al.35 observed a role of CASD1 in 7-O-acetylation but not in 9-O-acetylation of GD3 as shown by FACS analysis with anti-CD60c and anti-CD60b mAbs35. The stability of O-acetyl groups at C7 might thus be cell-type-specific and could explain the discrepancy with our data.\n\nBy identification of a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate that involves the active site residue S94, we provide first insight into the catalytic mechanism of CASD1. Transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to a serine placed in a Ser\u2013His\u2013Asp catalytic triad is reminiscent of what we found for the polysialic acid-specific O-acetyltransferase OatC of Neisseria meningitidis61 and suggests a ping\u2013pong mechanism as described for other members of the SGNH-hydrolase family6263. Consistently, we propose a mechanism in which the catalytic triad of CASD1 forms a charge relay network to activate S94, allowing nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl carbon of the acetyl donor. This leads to the transfer of the acetyl group to S94, followed by transfer to CMP-Neu5Ac during the second half reaction. Alanine exchange of S94 in sCASD1 prevented the formation of the acetyl-enzyme intermediate and resulted in a complete loss of SOAT activity in vitro.\n\nThe soluble sCASD1 variant used for in vitro experiments encompassed only the SGNH-like domain, whereas in vivo, this domain is fused to a C-terminal multi-TM domain. Detection of residual virolectin staining in cells expressing full-length CASD1-S94A may indicate that the C-terminal part contributes to CASD1 activity in vivo. First indication for this scenario is given by a bioinformatics analysis of the cryptococcal Cas1 protein (Cas1p)39. This study highlighted that the multi-TM domain found in Cas1p and its animal orthologue CASD1 shares homology with bacterial multi-TM O-acetyltransferases that are involved in the modification of cell surface or periplasmic biopolymers such as polysaccharides and peptidoglycan39. Of note, several of the bacterial multi-TM proteins work in concert with an SGNH-like O-acetyltransferase, with the latter being expressed either as separate protein or fused to the multi-TM part as in CASD1 (refs 62, 64, 65).\n\nIn conclusion, we characterized human CASD1 as key enzyme for Sia 9-O-acetylation and provided first insight into the catalytic mechanism. This opens new experimental avenues for the development of effective therapeutic strategies targeting CASD1 to regulate pathological changes in the 9-O-acetylation status and to combat drug-resistant cancer cells in ALL, whose survival crucially depend on 9-O-acetylation23.\n\nThe three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of CASD1 was modelled using the Phyre2 protein fold recognition server66. On the basis of the structure of the isoamyl acetate-hydrolysing esterase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PDB accession code 3mil), which was identified as top rank template, residues 83-290 of human CASD1 were modelled with 99.3% confidence.\n\nTo generate a construct encoding full-length CASD1 with an N-terminal V5 and a C-terminal Myc epitope (V5-CASD1-Myc), the coding region of human CASD1 (accession no. NM_022900) was amplified by PCR using the primers 5\u2032-GCTCGGGATCCGCGGCTCTGGCCTACAACCTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCTCGCTCGAGATGTTTTGATTTATCTTGAATGGATG-3\u2032 containing BamHI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined), respectively, and the resulting PCR product was ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Sequences encoding the epitope tags were inserted by adapter ligation. For the V5 epitope, the pre-hybridized oligonucleotide pair 5\u2032-AGCTTCGAATGGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCCTCTCCTCGGTCTCGATTCTACGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GATCCCGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAGAGGGTTAGGGATAGGCTTACCCATTCGA-3\u2032 was ligated into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pcDNA3. For the Myc epitope, the pre-hybridized oligonucleotide pair 5\u2032-TCGAGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGAATTAAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTAGATTAATTCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCC-3\u2032 was ligated into the XhoI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3, resulting in the plasmid pcDNA3-V5-CASD1(wt)-Myc.\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pcDNA3-V5-CASD1(wt)-Myc as template. To introduce the amino-acid exchange S94A, the mutagenesis primers 5\u2032-GCATTTATTGGAGATGCCAGAATTCGTCAATTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAATTGACGAATTCTGGCATCTCCAATAAATGC-3\u2032 were used, resulting in the plasmid pcDNA-V5-CASD1(S94A)-Myc.\n\nFor expression of the human sialyltransferase ST8Sia I, a full-length construct encoding an N-terminal V5 epitope was generated by amplification of the coding region of human ST8SIA1 (I.M.A.G.E. clone IRCMp5012B0613D, ImaGenes) using the primers 5\u2032-GCTAAGCTTCGAATGGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCCTCTCCTCGGTCTCGATTCTACGGGTACCAGCCCCTGCGGGCGGGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCTGCGGCCGCCTAGGAAGTGGGCTGGAGTG-3\u2032 containing the sequence encoding the V5 epitope (bold), HindIII and NotI restriction sites (underlined). The resulting PCR fragment was ligated into the HindIII and NotI sites of the expression vector pcDNA3.1-zeo (Invitrogen).\n\nTo generate constructs encoding a soluble Fc-chimera of BCoV-HE, DNA encoding the ectodomain (residues 1-388) of BCoV-HE (accession no. AAL57307) was generated by gene synthesis (Eurofins MWG Operon) and subsequent amplification by PCR using the primers 5\u2032-GACTGCTAGCATGTTTTTGCTTCCTAGATTTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GACTGGATCCACTTACCTGTATCATACACACAAATAGGTAC-3\u2032 containing NheI and BamHI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The obtained PCR product was ligated into the NheI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1-zeo, upstream of the sequence encoding the Fc part of human IgG1. A corresponding plasmid that encodes BCoV-HE0-Fc harbouring an inactive esterase domain due to the amino-acid exchange S40A was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the mutagenesis primers 5\u2032-GGAGATTGGTTTTTATTTGGTGACGCCCGTTCAGATTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAATCTGAACGGGCGTCACCAAATAAAAACCAATCTCC-3\u2032. The identity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing.\n\nThe murine fibroblast cell line LM-TK\u2212 (ATCC CCL1.3), the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line TE671, HEK293T cells and CHO wild type (CHO-K1), CHO lec1, and CHO 6B2 cells were maintained in DMEM/Ham's F-12 1:1 (Biochrom) supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Madin Darby canine kidney I cells (MDCK I) were cultured in DMEM (containing 450 mg l\u22121 glucose; Biochrom) supplemented with 10% FCS at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Additional information on the used cell lines are given in the legends to Supplementary Figs 4 and 5. The near-haploid human cell line HAP1 was purchased from Haplogen Genomics (Austria) and maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Gibco) supplemented with 5% FCS at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Hybridoma cells producing mAb R24 (ATCC HB-8445) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) adjusted to contain 4.5 g l\u22121 glucose, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10% FCS. All cell lines were routinely screened for mycoplasma contamination using the PlasmoTest detection kit (InvivoGen).\n\nInhibition of mucin-type O-glycosylation was achieved by cultivating CHO wild-type and CHO lec1 cells for 3 weeks in medium supplemented with 2 mM benzyl-N-acetyl-\u03b1-galactosaminide (benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc; Calbiochem).\n\nTransfection of LM-TK\u2212 and CHO cells was performed with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were grown in six-well plates (70-80% confluency), washed twice with PBS and transfected with 1 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA and 6 \u03bcl Lipofectamine in 1 ml of OptiMEM (Gibco). After 7 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 the transfection was stopped by adding 1 ml of culture medium supplemented with 10% FCS. For HAP1 and HEK293T cells, the protocol was varied by using 2 \u03bcl TurboFectin 8.0 (OriGene Technologies) or 2 \u03bcl polyethylenimine \u2018Max' (Polyscience) instead of Lipofectamine. For the selection of stable transfectants, 750 \u03bcg ml\u22121 G418 (Calbiochem) or 750 \u03bcg ml\u22121 zeocin (Life Technologies) were added 72 h after start of the transfection. Colonies were picked and cloned by limiting dilution.\n\nCASD1 knockout cells were generated by Haplogen Genomics (Austria) based on the near-haploid human cell line HAP1 and CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing48. In brief, HAP1 cells were edited using the Streptococcus pyogenes nuclease Cas9, together with a guide RNA containing a gene-specific sequence targeting exon 3 of CASD1 (5\u2032-ATGCAATATGTTTATCTACA-3\u2032). CASD1 knockout HEK293T cells were generated by CRISPR/CAS-mediated genome editing essentially as described by Zheng et al.67 with two guide RNAs targeting residues \u221233 to \u221214 and 38 to 57 of CASD1 exon 1 (5\u2032-GTCCGCCGCGCACTGTTGTCA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GTCAACCACTACTTCAGCGTG-3\u2032, respectively). Single cell clones of HAP1 and HEK293T cells were isolated by limiting dilution and genotyped by PCR and DNA sequencing using the primers 5\u2032-GGAGTGGTAAGTTAAACAAACCTGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTTTTCAGCTCCTACTCAATCTGGA-3\u2032 (for HAP1 cells) and 5\u2032-GCTATTAAGGCAGGAGGCTAAAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AACCACCAGCCATTGTCCTTTG-3\u2032 (for HEK293T cells).\n\nRNA was prepared from mammalian cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated from 1 \u03bcg of RNA using Revert Aid premium reverse transcriptase (Fermentas) and random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Gene-specific cDNA was amplified using the following primer pairs: 5\u2032-GTTTGGCAACCTCACAGTTGTATGATG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AGTTTCTCTGCTCGATTCAG-3\u2032 (CASD1), and 5\u2032-CACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GTCAGGTCCCGGCCAGCCAG-3\u2032 (\u00df-ACTIN). PCR products were separated on a 2.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. To confirm the presence of a 16-bp microdeletion in CASD1 transcripts of HAP1\u0394CASD1 cells, CASD1-specific cDNA was amplified using the primer pair 5\u2032-CGCCTCCCGCCGCTACCGAGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAATTGACGAATTCTGGAATCTC-3, which allows the amplification of a 184- and 168-bp PCR product from wild-type and mutated CASD1, respectively. The obtained PCR products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide.\n\nBCoV-HE0-Fc and BCoV-HE-Fc were produced by transient expression in HEK293T cells and purified from the tissue culture supernatant as described42. As an alternative source of recombinant proteins, CHO cells stably transfected with plasmids encoding BCoV-HE-Fc or BCoV-HE0-Fc were cultivated in DMEM/Ham's F-12 1:1 (Biochrom) containing 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 5% low IgG FCS (Gibco). Tissue culture supernatants from transfected HEK293T cells and conditioned medium of the CHO cells were collected and adsorbed to Protein A Sepharose (GE Healthcare). After washing with 20 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, bound protein was eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl pH 2.8 and neutralized by 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5. After addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 150 mM, purified Fc chimeras were stored at -80 \u00b0C.\n\nPlasmids enabling the secreted expression of sCASD1 in insect cells were based on a modified pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) carrying sequence stretches encoding an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide (HBM) and a C-terminal Myc-His6-tag. The sequence encoding residues 39\u2013304 of human CASD1 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5\u2032-GCTCGGAGCTCCGCCTCCCGCCGCTACCGAGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCTCGTCTAGATTGACAACAGGACCCATCTACAGG-3\u2032, containing SacI and XbaI restriction sites (underlined), and either pcDNA-V5-CASD1(wt)-Myc or pcDNA-V5-CASD1(S94A)-Myc as template. The resulting PCR products were ligated into the restriction sites of the modified pFastBac1 vector, resulting in the plasmids pFastBac1-HBM-sCASD1(wt)-Myc-His6 and pFastBac1-HBM-sCASD1(S94A)-Myc-His6.\n\nSpodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (Gibco) were grown at 27 \u00b0C in shaking cultures at 80 r.p.m. in protein-free Insect-Xpress medium (Lonza) and maintained at a density of 0.5 \u00d7 106 to 6 \u00d7 106 viable cells per ml. Transient expression of sCASD1-wt and sCASD1-S94A was performed on infection with recombinant baculovirus particles generated by the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) and the pFastBac1-based plasmids described above. Conditioned medium was collected 96 h after infection, concentrated 10-fold by tangential flow ultrafiltration (Ultrasette, cutoff of 10 kDa, Pall Corporation), diafiltered against 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 containing 100 mM NaCl and passed over a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). After washing with 20 column volumes of 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5 containing 100 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol, bound protein was eluted by an imidazole gradient. The imidazole was subsequently removed by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM MES pH 6.8 containing 100 mM NaCl.\n\nTo remove N-glycans, 2 \u03bcg of sCASD1-wt were incubated with two units of PNGaseF (Alexis Biochemicals) in a total volume of 30 \u03bcl of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA. Digests were performed at 37 \u00b0C for the indicated time points.\n\nProteins were separated by SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and proteins were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Roth) or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare) for western blot analysis. Myc-tagged proteins were detected using mAb 9E10 (5 \u03bcg ml\u22121, Roche), followed by goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (1:20,000; Jackson Immunoresearch) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection.\n\nCells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and washed with PBS. Membrane permeabilization was performed with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane by low concentrations of digitonin was performed as described68. Antibodies and virolectin were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and staining was performed for 1 h at room temperature (RT) using the following concentrations: BCoV-HE0-Fc (2.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121), anti-Myc mAb 9E10 (15 \u03bcg ml\u22121; Roche cat. 11667149001), anti-V5 mAb (1 \u03bcg ml\u22121; Acris cat. SM1691PS), rabbit anti-CASD1 pAb 500 (1:300; rabbit serum obtained from immunizations with sCASD1-wt carried out at Aldevron, Freiburg), anti-9-O-Ac-GD3 mAb UM4D4 (1 \u03bcg ml\u22121; Santa Cruz cat. Sc-32269), anti-GD3 mAb R24 (2.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121; purified from cell culture supernatant of hybridoma cells by Protein A affinity chromatography), anti-\u03b1-Man II pAb (1:10,000; kindly provided by Kelley Moremen), anti-Giantin pAb (1:1,000; Covance cat. PRB-114C) and human IgG Fc fragments (75 \u03bcg ml\u22121; Jackson Immunoresearch). After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with one of the following secondary antibodies used in a 1:500 dilution: sheep anti-mouse IgG Cy3-conjugate (Sigma Aldrich cat. C 2181); sheep anti-rabbit IgG Cy3-conjugate (Sigma Aldrich cat. C2306); donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488-conjugate (Molecular Probes cat. A21206); donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488-conjugate (Molecular Probes cat. A 21202); donkey anti-human IgG DyLight500-conjugate (Thermo Scientific cat. SA5-10127); goat anti-mouse IgM Alexa Fluor 568-conjugate (Invitrogen cat. A 21043); or rabbit anti-mouse IgG3 DyLight549-conjugate (Rockland cat. 610-442-043). After washes with PBS, cells were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector) and analysed under a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope equipped with ApoTome module, AxioCam MRm digital camera and Axio Vision software (Zeiss).\n\nTo de-O-acetylate sialoglycoconjugates before the analysis with virolectin, fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with either 0.1 M NaOH or 45 \u03bcg ml\u22121 BCoV-HE-Fc in 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. De-O-acetylation of bovine submandibular gland mucin (BSM; Sigma Aldrich) used for in vitro assays was performed overnight in 0.1 M triethylamine at 37 \u00b0C followed by lyophilisation and resuspension in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.5.\n\nEsterase activity was measured in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl containing 15 pmol protein (BCoV-HE-Fc, sCASD1-wt or BSA), 1 mM pNP-acetate (Sigma Aldrich), 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.5 and 50 mM KCl. Samples were incubated for 30 min at RT and the absorbance of released pNP was measured at 405 nm.\n\nFor radioactive incorporation assays, 5 \u03bcg of purified protein (sCASD1-wt or sCASD1-S94A) was incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C in a total volume of 50 \u03bcl containing 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.5, 50 mM KCl and 2.5 \u03bcM [3H]acetyl-CoA (0.37 kBq \u03bcl\u22121, American Radiolabeled Chemicals). To stabilize the acetyl-enzyme intermediate, reaction mixtures were kept at -20 \u00b0C for at least 18 h. After thawing at RT, an aliquot of 10 \u03bcl was spotted on Whatman grade 3MM chromatography paper and free radioactivity was removed by descending paper chromatography using 300 mM ammonium acetate pH 7.5/70% ethanol as mobile phase. Radioactivity incorporated into protein remained at the origin and was quantified by scintillation counting.\n\nPurified sCASD1-wt or sCASD1-S94A (5 \u03bcg) was incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C with or without 2.5 \u03bcM acetyl-CoA (Sigma Aldrich) in 50 \u03bcl containing 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.5 and 50 mM KCl. After storage at -20 \u00b0C for at least 18 h to stabilize the acetyl-enzyme intermediate, the reaction mixture was separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and the protein band was excised, digested with trypsin and analysed by LC-ESI-MS.\n\nOn separation by SDS\u2013PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue (Roth), protein bands were excised from gels and subjected to tryptic digest. Briefly, the gel pieces were dehydrated with acetonitrile and rehydrated with 100 mM NH4HCO3 containing 10 mM dithiothreitol (Roth). Subsequently, gel pieces were treated with 100 mM NH4HCO3 containing 100 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma). After a second dehydration step with acetonitrile and rehydration with 100 mM NH4HCO3 buffer followed by dehydration with acetonitrile, the dried gel pieces were rehydrated with 20 ng \u03bcl\u22121 trypsin (Promega) in 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Peptides were extracted with 75% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid and dried in a vacuum centrifuge.\n\nEnzyme assays were performed for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C in 20 \u03bcl containing 50 mM MES pH 6.5, 10 mM MnCl2, 1 mM acetyl-CoA with or without 5 \u03bcg sCASD1-wt or sCASD1-S94A. As acceptor substrates, the following compounds were tested: CMP-Neu5Ac (600 \u03bcM; Nacalai Tesque); Neu5Ac (600 \u03bcM; Nacalai Tesque); a mixture of \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-linked sialyllactose (600 \u03bcM; Sigma Aldrich); GD3 (600 \u03bcM; Calbiochem); fetuin (7 \u03bcg; Sigma Aldrich); and de-O-acetylated BSM (7 \u03bcg). After the enzyme reaction, Sias were released by acidic hydrolysis. To reduce O-acetyl group loss and migration during this step, we followed the protocol of Mawhinney and Chance69 using 2 M propionic acid for 1 h at 80 \u00b0C. Liberated Sias were subsequently derivatized with DMB according to Hara et al.70. Briefly, Sias were labelled for 2.5 h at 50 \u00b0C using 8 mM DMB (Dojindo) in 1.5 M propionic acid containing 0.8 M \u00df-mercaptoethanol and 14.2 mM sodium hydrosulfite. Fluorescently labelled Sias were separated using the Shimadzu Prominence CBM-20A UFLC system equipped with a XSelect CSH C18 reversed-phase HPLC column (Waters, 4.6 \u00d7 250 mm, 5.0-\u03bcm particle size). Isocratic elution was performed with acetonitrile/methanol/H2O (9:7:84, v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min\u22121 and fluorescence was monitored with a fluorescence detector (RF-10A XL, Shimadzu) at 372 nm for excitation and 456 nm for emission. For the assignment of individual peaks, the DMB-labelled Glyko sialic acid reference panel (Prozyme) was used.\n\nFor each cell type, HAP1 wt and HAP1\u0394CASD1, 2 \u00d7 107 cells were incubated in 100 \u03bcl PBS containing 15 mU sialidase isolated from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (EY Laboratories, Inc.) for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C to remove cell surface Sia. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in 100 \u03bcl of PBS in a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) at 5,000 r.p.m. for 3 \u00d7 5 s. The microsomal fraction was obtained by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000g and removal of the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was washed with PBS followed by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000g, resuspended in 100 \u03bcl of 2 M propionic acid and incubated for 1 h at 80 \u00b0C to release bound Sia. After centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000g, the supernatant was lyophilized, derivatized with DMB and analysed by HPLC as described.\n\nMS analysis of peptides and DMB-labelled sugars was performed on a nanoACQUITY UPLC system (Waters) equipped with an analytical column (Waters, BEH130C18, 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 mm, 1.7-\u03bcm particle size) coupled online with an ESI Q-TOF (Q-TOF Ultima, Waters). DMB-labelled sugars dissolved in acetonitrile/methanol/H2O (9:7:84, v/v) and peptides dissolved in 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid were separated by reverse-phase chromatography using acetonitrile as eluent. MS spectra were recorded in positive reflection mode and analytes were automatically subjected to fragmentation (MS/MS). Spectra were analysed using MassLynx V4.1 software (Waters). MS/MS protein spectra were automatically analysed using the program ProteinLynx Global Server (Version 2.1, Waters).\n\nGangliosides were extracted as described19. Briefly, 2 \u00d7 107 cells were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), lysed for 15 min by sonication and centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 r.p.m. Water was added to the supernatant to obtain a final ratio of chloroform/methanol/H20 of 4:8:5 (v/v/v). After vortexing and centrifugation for 5 min at 4,800 r.p.m., the upper phase was recovered. The obtained ganglioside fraction was desalted on a Chromabond C18 cartridge (Macherey-Nagel) and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen gas. Gangliosides were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), spotted on high-performance TLC plates (Nano-DURASIL-20, 10 \u00d7 10 cm, Macherey-Nagel) and chromatographed for 30 min in chloroform/methanol/H2O (120:70:17, v/v/v) containing 0.02% CaCl2 (ref. 5). Plates were treated with 0.5% polyisobutyl methacrylate (Sigma Aldrich) in hexane and dried. After incubation in PBS followed by blocking with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT, immunostaining with enhanced chemiluminescence detection was performed using the following antibodies: Anti-CD60b mAb UM4D4 (5 \u03bcg ml\u22121; Santa Cruz cat. Sc-32269); anti-CD60c mAb U5 (40 \u03bcg ml\u22121; kindly provided by Reinhard Schwartz-Albiez); anti-CD60a mAb R24 (10 \u03bcg ml\u22121; purified from cell culture supernatant of hybridoma cells by Protein A affinity chromatography); goat anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate (1:5,000; Southern Biotech cat. 1010-05); or goat anti-mouse IgM HRP conjugate (1:5,000; Southern Biotech cat. 1021-05). To induce migration of O-acetyl groups from the C7 to the C9 position of Sia, TLC plates were treated with 0.1 M glycine/NaOH pH 9.7 for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C (ref. 5) before blocking with 1% BSA in PBS. 7-O- and 9-O-acetylated GD3 used as standards were purified from bovine buttermilk by Bernhard Kniep25 and have been generously provided by Reinhard Schwartz-Albiez.\n\nHow to cite this article: Baumann, A-M.T. et al. 9-O-Acetylation of sialic acids is catalysed by CASD1 via a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate.
