{"title": "Reverse Transcription Cross-Priming Amplification\u2013Nucleic Acid Test Strip for Rapid Detection of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus", "body": "The optimization of amplification involved primer combinations with a high sensitivity and no false positive. A set of primers suitable for CPA detection of PEDV were designated by CPR-2, DF5B1, DF5F-12, F3-1, and B3-1 (Table 1). DF5F-12 and DF5B1 were labeled with FAM and biotin, respectively. Primer combination, CPR-2, DF5B1, DF5F-12, F3-1, and B3-1 gave a high sensitivity with no false positive (Fig. 1a up). Gel electrophoresis results below the strip graph confirmed the CPA reaction corresponding to the results on the strip (Fig. 1a down).\n\nOptimization of CPA assay included concentration optimizations of external primers, probe and cross primer. Using concentrations ranging from 0.1 \u03bcL to 0.6 \u03bcL, the optimal concentrations of external primers were determined to be 0.1 \u03bcL of 20 \u03bcM F3-1 and 0.2 \u03bcL of 20 \u03bcM B3-1 (Fig. 1b).\n\nProbes were optimized by testing concentrations (from 0.2 \u03bcL to 0.8 \u03bcL) of one probe against a fixed concentration of another probe. The optimal concentrations were 0.3 \u03bcL and 0.6\u03bcL for 20 \u03bcM DF5F-12 and 20 \u03bcM DF5B1, respectively (Fig. 1c).\n\nThe optimal concentration of the cross primer was 0.4 \u03bcL of 20 \u03bcM CPR-2 after testing with concentrations ranging from 0.1 \u03bcL to 1 \u03bcL. (Fig. 1d). Other reagents for the assay including MgSO4, betaine, deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), and Bst DNA polymerase were also optimized. The final volumes of dNTP (10 mM), MgSO4 (50 mM), betaine (5 M), and Bst DNA polymerase (10 U/\u03bcL) were 0.8, 0.4, 6, and 1 \u03bcL, respectively (Fig. 1e\u2013h). A reaction temperature of 63 \u00b0C was selected for the CPA assays, similar to previous report8. The reaction time was extended by 15 and 30 min on the basis of the optimum experimental conditions to determine the relationship between reaction time and sensitivity. Our results indicated that, when CPA reactions were incubated for 90 min, favorable results were obtained without nonspecific amplification (Fig. 1k). The sensitivity of CPA was higher than that under 60 min (Fig. 1i) and 75 min (Fig. 1j). In addition, amplification results from the optimized CPA assay correlated 100% with those based on gel electrophoresis.\n\nFinally, the total volume for the CAP amplification was 20 \u03bcL. The optimal concentration of each reagent was as follows: CPR-2, 0.4 \u03bcM; F3-1, 0.1 \u03bcM; B3-1(20 \u03bcM), 0.2 \u03bcM; DF5F(20 \u03bcM), 0.3 \u03bcM; DF5B(20 \u03bcM), 0.6 \u03bcM; MgSO4, 2 mM; betaine (5 M), 1.5 M; dNTP(10 mM), 0.8 \u03bcL; and 1 \u00d7 Bst DNA polymerase buffer and Bst DNA polymerase (10 U/\u03bcL), 1 \u03bcL. The assay was able to detect plasmid containing PEDV target at 10\u22124 dilution after 60 min amplification and at 10\u22126 dilution after 90 min. No false positive was detected after 120 min incubation.\n\nAn assay combining RT and CPA was optimized to detect PEDV RNA from clinical specimens. AMV (BioFlux, China), Gsp Fast polymerase (Ustar, China), and RNA secure (Thermo Fisher, USA) in the RT CPA system were optimized. The optimal content of each component in the RT CPA system was as follows: CPR-2 (20 \u03bcM), 0.4 \u03bcM; F3-1 (20 \u03bcM), 0.1 \u03bcM; B3-1 (20 \u03bcM), 0.2 \u03bcM;DF5F (20 \u03bcM), 0.3 \u03bcM; DF5B(20 \u03bcM), 0.6 \u03bcM; MgSO4(50 mM),2 mM; betaine (5 M), 1.5 M; dNTP(10 mM), 0.08 \u03bcM; Gsp Fast polymerase (10 U/\u03bcL), 0.2 U/\u03bcL; RNA secure, 1 \u03bcL; and AMV (5 U/\u03bcL), 0.05 U/\u03bcL, 1 \u00d7 Gsp Fast polymerase buffer, 2 \u03bcL. The total volume was 20 \u03bcL.\n\nTen times dilution series of plasmid was tested using CPA-NATS to determine its sensitivity. At the same time, reverse transcription PCR(RT-PCR) was used to confirm the CPA-NATS results. The results showed that 10\u22126 diluted plasmid could be detected consistently by CPA-NATS. However, results with 10\u22127 diluted plasmid were inconsistent (Fig. 2a). Thus, 10\u22126 was considered the detection limit of CPA-NATS, which had a similar sensitivity compared to that of RT-PCR (Fig. 2c).\n\nThe specificity of the RT CPA-NATS method for detecting PEDV was evaluated by testing other common pathogenic viruses of swine, including porcine circovirus virus (PCV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), and porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV). Data showed 100% specificity against these viruses (Fig. 2b,d), comparable to RT-PCR.\n\nA total of 41 fecal samples from swine suspected of PEDV infections collected in Chengdu, Harbin, and Jinan were tested for further evaluation and validation of the RT CPA-NATS in the detection of PEDV. Ten samples (No. 5, 13, 21, 22, 23, 32, 35, 36, 37, and 38) were detected positive by RT CPA-NATS (Fig. 3a). By contrast, only seven samples (No. 21, 22, 23, 29, 35, 37, and 38) were detected positive by RT-PCR (Fig. 3b\u2013d). The test results of the clinical specimens by RT CPA-NATS and RT-PCR were also summarized in Table 2. The number of PEDV-positive samples detected by RT CPA-NATS was 2 of 20 in Chengdu, 3 of 11 in Harbin, and 5 of 10 in Jinan (Table 3). However, two samples (one from Chengdu and one from Jinan) were detected positive by RT CPA-NATS but negative by RT-PCR. Another sample from Harbin was detected positive by RT-PCR but negative by RT CPA-NATS.\n\nAdditionally, the system was validated by technicians with limited laboratory trainings on a pig farm. Six fecal swab specimens from sick piglets showing disease symptoms Suspected infected by PEDV were collected and tested for PEDV. Two of the six specimens (2# and 3#) were tested positive (Fig. 4a), which was in agreement with the results of RT-PCR (Fig. 4b).\n\nThe methods were carried out in accordance with Animal Epidemic Prevention Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Animal experiments in this study were approved by the animal care and use committee of the Institute of Special Economic Animal and Plant Sciences and the animal welfare committee of the Jilin Province, China.\n\nAs one-step diagnostic system, RT CPA-NATS was capable of detecting PEDV in clinical specimens and displayed 100% specificity against several related porcine viruses. The CPA-NATS system based on an isothermal DNA amplification technology and does not require any sophisticated equipment. It has already been applied to clinical diagnosis of human infectious diseases such as tuberculosis8, where a double crossing CPA was used to amplify DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The present study employing the CPA-NATS technology was a single crossing CPA assay7, which is slightly different from a double crossing CPA. We successfully adopted the technology and optimize all reaction conditions to meet our objective in developing diagnostic system that combines reverse transcription and CPA for detecting RNA virus.\n\nSeveral methods for the detection and diagnosis of PEDV have been described. Recently, a real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method was reported to be easy to operate and simple to read results, and did not require sophisticated instruments910. However, RT-LAMP detects pathogens using reaction-turbidity as an indicator, which is sometimes difficult to determine without an instrument. The test strip result of CPA-NATS offers direct visualization by eyes, and is much easier to be interpreted. A variety of PCR methods have been developed to detect PEDV, such as a nanoparticle-assisted PCR assay11, duplex real-time RT-PCR12, and multiplex TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR13, which can detect and differentiate the variant and virulent strains of PEDV currently reported to be circulating in the US. The above mentioned molecular biology methods all need expensive instruments, which limits their clinical applications particularly in field laboratories or on farm.\n\nThe RT CPA-NATS system developed in the present study was capable of detecting PEDV in clinical specimens and distinguishing PEDV from other common viral pathogens causing pig diseases, namely, PCV, TGEV, CSFV, PRV, and PRRSV. It has a good specificity for detection of PEDV with the RT CPA-NATS methods. That is same as previous developed RT-PCR, real time RT-PCR or RT-LAMP101213. By the contrast of RT CPA-NATS and RT-PCR, we found that RT CPA-NATS had a little better effect on detecting PEDV than RT-PCR and meanwhile it had a convenient and cheaper test procedure. In the previous research, ELISA and RT-PCR14, RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR15, RT-LAMP and real time RT-PCR16 were all compared with in virus detection. Different methods detecting the different viruses may show variable effect. Here, we have showed the comparison of RT CPA-NATS with RT-PCR on detecting PEDV. However, the system was incapable of discriminating variants and virulent strains of PEDV. Nevertheless, it offers an excellent tool for initial screening of clinical specimens for PEDV, and should make valuable contributions to the rapid identification of PEDV in order to prevent and control this devastating disease in swine.\n\nIn conclusion, our data showed that the RT CPA-NATS system developed for the detection of PEDV has significant advantages. The system was optimized and was comparable to RT-PCR that is the current recommended molecular method. Greater specificity and sensitivity, easy operation protocol and simple equipment make the RT CPA-NATS system ideal for the rapid detection of PEDV in clinical diagnosis.\n\nLarge fragment Bst DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Beijing, China) was used in amplification reaction. According to the mechanism of CPA, the presence of a cross primer is essential7. The two pairs of outer primers, three upstream probes, four downstream probes, and three cross primers were designed for screening the best primer combinations. The primers that target the N gene of PEDV were designed based on a new PEDV sequence (KC189944.1, NT 26716\u201326873). The optimum primers and probes (Table 1) selected to develop CPA-NATS of PEDV were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). The probes were labeled with FAM or biotin.\n\nA constructed plasmid T-PEDV-N was used in developing CPA-NATS as positive template. Total RNA of PEDV was extracted with the E.A.N.A.\u2122 Viral RNA Kit (OMIGA, Norcross, GA) as template to conduct RT-PCR to amplify the PEDV N gene fragment. The primers N-F/R were used to amplify PEDV N gene fragment (sequences were listed in Table 1). The amplicon was cloned into pMD18-T vector(Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) by TA cloning at site 425 and called T-PEDV-N. The concentration of T-PEDV-N was 241.5 \u03bcg/mL, with approximately 5.39 \u00d7 1013 copies/mL.\n\nWe conducted a probe hybridization reaction experiment and determined the selected primers that exhibited no reaction during probe hybridization. Subsequently, the CPA tests were conducted with different primer combinations. The initial test system was as follows: CPR(20 \u03bcM), 0.8 \u03bcL; F3(20 \u03bcM), 0.2 \u03bcL; B3(20 \u03bcM), 0.2 \u03bcL; DF5F(20 \u03bcM), 0.3 \u03bcL; DF5B(20 \u03bcM), 0.3 \u03bcL; Thermo Pol buffer (10\u00d7), 2 \u03bcL; MgSO4(100 mM), 0.4 \u03bcL; betaine (5 M), 2 \u03bcL; dNTP(10 mM), 0.8 \u03bcL; Bst DNA polymerase (10 U/\u03bcL), 1 \u03bcL; and template, 4 \u03bcL; sterile deionized water was added to achieved 20 \u03bcL. The products of CPA were diluted with1\u00d7saline sodium citrate buffer and dropped onto the sample pad of the test strips (Ustar Biotech, Hangzhou, China). The test strips were observed after 1 min. Positive PEDV is denoted by two red lines, with the top line for quality control and the bottom line for test. Only the control line is negative. Otherwise, only the test line is invalid.\n\nWe further evaluated the specificity of the CPA method for the detection of PEDV by testing other viruses, such as PCV, TGEV, PRV, and PRRSV, which cause similar symptoms in pigs. The genome (RNA or DNA) was extracted with the E.A.N.A.\u2122 Viral RNA Kit (OMIGA, Norcross, GA) or E.A.N.A.\u2122 Viral DNA Kit (OMIGA, Norcross, GA). The viruses were detected by the reverse transcription CPA-NATS (RT CPA-NATS) system.\n\nIn order to detect the PEDV RNA from clinical specimens, a system including RT and CPA was optimized. AMV reverse transcriptase(BioFlux, Hangzhou, China) was used due to its tolerance to high temperature even at 65 \u00b0C. Bst DNA polymerase was changed to Gsp Fast polymerase (Ustar Biotech, Hangzhou, China) to adapt to RNA detection. The optimization condition of all components, except for AMV, Gsp Fast polymerase, and RNA secure, was retained. AMV, Gsp Fast polymerase, and RNA secure in the RT CPA-NATS system were optimized.\n\nWe collected 41 viscera samples from pigs apparently infected with PEDV from 3 regions (Chengdu, Harbin, and Jinan) of China to evaluate the PEDV RT CPA-NATS method. Samples 1\u201320 were obtained from Chengdu, 21\u201331 from Harbin, and 32\u201341 from Jinan. We tested the 41 specimens using the constructed PEDV RT CPA-NATS method. In the same manner, RT-PCR tests with outer primers pair of CPA were conducted on these specimens to confirm CPA.\n\nNonprofessional personnel in a livestock farm conducted the RT CPA-NATS to detect PEDV in the samples to verify the clinical use effect of the RT CPA-NATS method. The same samples were tested using their developed RT-PCR method with the detection primers D-800-F/R, which match M and N gene of PEDV, respectively (Table 1). The product length was 800 bp.\n\nHow to cite this article: Wang, F.-X. et al.
