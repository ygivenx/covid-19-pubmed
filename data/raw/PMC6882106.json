{"title": "Applying a Linear Amplification Strategy to Recombinase\nPolymerase Amplification for Uniform DNA Library Amplification", "body": "Recombinase polymerase\namplification (RPA) was first reported in\n2006 and has rapidly become an alternative method to polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) for various applications.1 Typically, RPA requires a recombinase, single-stranded DNA-binding\nprotein and a polymerase1 to amplify nucleic\nacids. The mechanism of RPA is similar to that of PCR. First, the\nrecombinase and primer form a complex and attach to the target site.\nThen, the polymerase recognizes the primer and extends through the\ntemplate DNA. During extension, single-stranded DNA-binding proteins\nattach to the opposite strand to stabilize the RPA reaction intermediate.\n\nRPA has two advantages over PCR\u2014reaction temperature and\nreaction time. RPA usually proceeds between 37 and 42 \u00b0C under\nisothermal conditions, which is advantageous for instrument-free field\ndiagnosis and prevention of heat-induced DNA mutations. The reaction\ntime for RPA is typically 152 or 20\u201340\nmin based on the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, which is shorter\nthan most PCR reactions. Because of these advantages, RPA is used\nfor detection and diagnosis of specific bacteria2\u22124 and viruses.5\u22128 Moreover, RPA can be conducted on solid-phase materials,9\u221211 including lateral flow dipstick,10,12\u221214 which permits the technique to be used in point-of-care tests.\n\nStudies have examined replacing existing PCR-based molecular biology\ntechniques with RPA-based techniques. For example, allele-specific\nRPA is performed for genotyping SNPs using 19-base pair (bp) to 21\nbp primers designed in silico.15 Blocked\nRPA uses wild-type binding blocked oligo and mutation-specific amplification,16 and miRPA detection is performed by amplifying\ntwo ligated probes using the target miRNA as a splint oligo.17 In addition, digital droplet RPA reduces the\nreaction time to 30 min by replacing the amplification method from\nPCR to RPA.18 Another example is multiplex\nRPA, which detects multiple pathogens simultaneously using multiple\nprimer pairs.19,20\n\nWith the development of\nnext-generation sequencing (NGS) technology,\nthe importance of error-free and unbiased DNA library amplification\nis becoming increasingly important. To achieve a reduced error rate\nand unbiased amplification, the researchers proposed several different\nmethods. For example, researchers compared the fidelity of DNA polymerase21 and used high-fidelity DNA polymerase to reduce\nthe error which was generated during DNA amplification. Other researchers\nused molecular DNA barcode to remove the DNA duplicate22 and amplification bias.23,24 However, most of the methods used PCR as a DNA amplification method,\nwhich has a chance to induce heat-related damages such as deamination\nof cytosine to uracil.25\n\nWe hypothesized\nthat replacing PCR with RPA can reduce these heat-related\ndamages. Thus, in this study, we applied RPA to amplify the DNA library\nand designed several experiments to properly implement it. We amplified\nsheared DNA and an oligonucleotide DNA library using RPA and identified\nthe appropriate RPA method for each DNA library. Through this study,\nwe show that RPA is suitable for NGS sample amplification, further\nbroadening the potential applications of the RPA method.\n\nTo evaluate amplification\nby RPA, we prepared sheared DNA libraries\nusing genomic DNA from human NA12878 or E. coli EcNR2.26 DNA was sheared into two different\nsizes, each averaging between 180 bp and 300 bp (Figure S1), which we termed human small, human large, E. coli small, and E. coli large library, respectively. Sheared DNA libraries were treated\nwith several enzymes for end repair, dA-tailing, adaptor ligation,\nand uracil cleavage, as described in the Materials\nand Methods (\u201cNGS sample preparation\u201d). After\nuracil cleavage, the sequencing adaptor had flanking sequences longer\nthan 30 bp. Besides, the RPA reaction has a suggested primer length\nof \u226530 bp. Thus, we hypothesized that RPA could be employed\ndirectly for the index attachment step instead of PCR.\n\nTo confirm\nour hypothesis, we conducted index attachment steps with PCR and two-primer\nRPA (n = 3) with the small and large E. coli and human DNA libraries, which were treated\nthrough serial NGS sample preparation steps. Although RPA products\nwere smaller than PCR products (Figure S2), the samples were successfully sequenced with the Illumina NextSeq\nplatform (Tables S1, S2). Sequencing data\nwere analyzed using AdapterRemoval,27 Burrows\u2013Wheeler\nalignment (BWA),28 Samtools,29 and in-house python codes. The most abundant\nfragment size of RPA-amplified E. coli small and large libraries were 59 bp and 50 bp, respectively, which\nwere smaller than their corresponding PCR products of 92 bp and 147\nbp. The human small and large libraries showed similar trends as the E. coli libraries (Figure S3). Moreover, the RPA amplicons of the human and E.\ncoli large DNA libraries showed similar size distributions\nas those of their small-sized library amplicons.\n\nThe genome\nsequence of EcNR2 is already known; therefore, we were\nable to calculate the uniformity values  of every EcNR2 genome base. Using these\nuniformity values, we calculated the percentage of bases in the uniform\nrange (the uniformity values in a range of 0.5\u20131.5) to compare\nthe uniformity difference between samples. Thus, if the percentage\nwas higher, the sample was amplified more uniformly. Using the above\ncalculation, we calculated the percentage of uniform range of small\nand large DNA libraries which showed 76.6 and 84.0% of bases in the\nuniform range, respectively. By contrast, the RPA amplicons from small\nand large DNA libraries showed 56.3 and 49.2%, respectively (Figure S5). We assumed that the size shift might\nbe due to faster amplification of small-sized DNA by RPA versus PCR.\nThus, the difference in the size-dependent amplification rate caused\nbiased amplification with reduced uniformity.\n\nTo solve the size shift and lower uniformity\nproblem, we examined single-primer linear RPA as a potential solution\nto the size shift problem of DNA libraries amplified with two-primer\nRPA. We hypothesized that a single primer would prevent reamplification\nof the RPA amplicon by the opposite primer, blocking acceleration\nof small-sized DNA amplification. Moreover, because of the strand\ndisplacement activity of RPA, large DNA should be amplified simultaneously\nin multiple strands. Taken together, to improve the size shift and\nuniformity, we adopted a single-primer linear amplification strategy.30 To test our hypothesis, we amplified E. coli small (n = 3) and large\n(n = 3) libraries using single-primer linear RPA,\nwhich we refer to as linear RPA (Figure 1). After adaptor ligation and USER treatment\nof E. coli libraries, 20 min of linear\nRPA was performed with the P7 index primer (Table S3). A short cycle of PCR was performed with the P5 index and\nP7 end primers to attach the P5 index for NGS. We confirmed the size\ndistribution of products by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to performing\nNGS and found broader size distributions (Figure S4) than that obtained with two-primer RPA (Figure S2). Amplified libraries were sequenced with the Illumina\nNextSeq platform and analyzed as above. From the analysis result,\nthe size distribution and uniformity of linear RPA products were improved\ncompared with products from two-primer RPA (Figure 2). The average size distributions of the\ntriplet experiment with the small and large libraries were 56 bp and\n45 bp, respectively, by RPA and 90 bp and 109 bp, respectively, by\nlinear RPA (Figure 2a). Also, the average percentages of bases in the uniform range (uniformity\nvalue between 0.5 and 1.5) about the triplet experiment was improved\nfrom 56.3 and 49.2% by two-primer RPA to 73.6 and 75.7% by linear\nRPA for the small and large DNA libraries, respectively (Figures 2b and S5).\n\nNext, we analyzed the\nsubstitution error of linear RPA products.\nWe calculated the error rate and substitution type and then compared\nthe substitution error rate with those obtained with KAPA HiFi HotStart\nReady Mix31 and NGS.32 From the result, no significant substitution error rate\ndifferences were noted among PCR and RPA samples (Figure 2c). The substitution error\nratio of samples was similar to the NGS error ratio but not the amplification\nerror ratio. Thus, linear RPA improved the library amplification with\nrespect to size distribution and uniformity without significant substitution\nerror rate change.\n\nLinear RPA was used to overcome the bias which\noccurs when amplifying\nthe size-variable DNA library with two primers by RPA. We wanted to\ninvestigate whether the uniformity is low when amplifying the same-sized\nDNA library by RPA. To test this, we designed and synthesized a microarray\noligonucleotide library (oligo library) with 150 bp long sequences\n(Supporting Information 1). The terminal\n20 bp and 30 bp at both ends were designed to contain common flanking\nsequences as primer binding sites for PCR and RPA, respectively (Figure\nS6, Supporting Information 1). One thousand\ninsert sequences with 90 bp were extracted from the genomic DNA sequence\nof Synechocystis sp PCC 6803. We conducted\nRPA and PCR for 20 min and 25 cycles, respectively, with 20 ng oligo\nlibrary in each reaction as a template (n = 3). Agarose\ngel electrophoresis showed the correct amplicon size with both methods\n(Figure S7). After NGS sample preparation\nwith eight cycles of index attachment PCR, the samples were sequenced\nusing the Illumina NextSeq platform. Sequencing data for both the\nPCR and RPA oligo library amplicons were analyzed using BWA, Samtools,\nand in-house python codes. We assessed the uniformity of the PCR and\nRPA amplicons by calculating the uniformity value (sequencing depth\nof the single oligo/average depth of all 1000 oligos) of each oligo\nin the library. All replicate experiments are visualized on a dot\nplot showing the uniformity values (Figure 3a). Results indicated that 77.0% of oligos\nwere in the uniform range (uniformity value 0.5\u20131.5) after\nPCR amplification, and 63.2% of oligos were in the uniform range by\nRPA.\n\nThe uniformity value can also represent the order\nof amplification\nfor each of the content in the library. Values for PCR and RPA replicates\nwere arranged in descending order based on the rank of PCR and RPA\nreplicate 1 to produce dot plots (Figure 3b). We calculated the correlation coefficient\nof the uniformity values for the PCR and RPA replicates (Figure 3c). Interestingly,\nthe uniformity value of each of oligo content showed a different ranking\norder for PCR and RPA amplicons. We did not identify the reason for\nthe difference in amplification preferences but believe it may be\ndue to the differences in polymerases used for PCR and RPA. Taken\ntogether, the data show that RPA uniformly amplifies DNA libraries\nof the same size and has different amplification preferences than\nPCR.\n\nIn this study, we introduced a novel DNA\nlibrary amplification\nmethod based on RPA. At first, we hypothesized that RPA can be a replacement\nof PCR for DNA library amplification. However, during the experiment,\nan accelerated small-sized DNA amplification by two-primer RPA reaction\ncaused lower uniformity compared to PCR. To solve this problem, we\nadapted a linear amplification strategy. We hypothesized that the\nsingle-primer linear RPA would result in unbiased, single-stranded\nDNA amplicons by the strand displacement activity of RPA. As a result,\nwe were able to obtain the more uniform products compared to two-primer\nRPA products. Nevertheless, the size distribution was not superior\ncompared to PCR products. We believe that further optimization is\nnecessary for linear RPA to be competitive over PCR.\n\nWe also\nexamined the uniformity of RPA when amplifying the same-sized\noligonucleotide library. We designed and synthesized a 150 bp oligo\nDNA library from the genome sequence of Synechocystis sp PCC 6803. The RPA product was slightly lower than the PCR amplicons\nbut showed similar uniformity. It was noted that during the analysis,\ndifferent amplification preferences were found between the PCR and\nRPA amplified oligo library sequencing data. The correlation coefficient\nof PCR\u2013PCR or RPA\u2013RPA replicates was close to 1, but\nthe correlation coefficient of PCR\u2013RPA showed 0.6 (Figure 3b,c). We were unable\nto elucidate the reason for these different preferences, but acknowledge\nthat differences in RPA versus PCR polymerases may contribute.\n\nAs described above, one of the reasons why we used RPA is to reduce\nthe heat deamination of DNA during PCR. To prove it, we analyzed the\nsubstitution error rate of our samples. However, the substitution\nerror ratio showed a similar trend as that of the NGS substitution\nerror rate ratio. Thus, we were not able to find any evidence that\nheat-induced C to T deamination was reduced by RPA. We assumed that\nthe deamination error rate might be lower than the sequencing error\nrate in our study.\n\nTaken together, we show that single-primer\nlinear RPA can be one\nof the alternative methods to PCR for DNA library amplification. Still\nfurther optimization is needed, and we believe that the linear RPA\ncan be used for simultaneous amplification and barcoding with a single\noligo, resulting in shorter reaction times and milder reaction conditions\nthan PCR. Thus, we envision that our study will extend the scope of\nRPA in the field of genomics.\n\nAll primers were purchased from Integrated\nDNA Technologies (USA) or Macrogen (Korea) (Table S3). We used KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (Kapa Biosystems,\nUSA) for PCR experiments. The 50 \u03bcL PCR reaction consisted of\n25 \u03bcL of 2\u00d7 KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix, 2.4 \u03bcL\nof 10 \u03bcM forward primer, 2.4 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM reverse\nprimer, and template DNA or ddH2O (negative control). The\namplicon was purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen,\nGermany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\nTwo-primer RPA was conducted at 37 \u00b0C\nwith the TwistAmp Basic kit (TwistDx Limited, UK) following the manufacturer\u2019s\nprotocol. Briefly, 25 \u03bcL of 2\u00d7 Reaction Buffer, 3.68 \u03bcL\nof 25 mM dNTP mix, 5 \u03bcL of 10\u00d7 Basic E-mix, 2.4 \u03bcL\nof 10 \u03bcM P5 primer, 2.4 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM P7 primer, and\n44.5 \u03bcL of ddH2O were included. Samples were vortexed\nand spun down, and 2.5 \u03bcL of 20\u00d7 Core Reaction Mix was\nadded to the reaction mixture. The solution was mixed vigorously,\ncentrifuged, and transferred to a new dry tube. Next, 2.5 \u03bcL\nof 200 mM MgOAc and 0.5 \u03bcL of template DNA were added separately\nto the cap. Finally, the contents were centrifuged to start the 20\nmin reaction and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. Amplified DNA was purified\nwith the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following\nthe manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\nFor all single-primer linear\nRPA reactions, everything was the same until the DNA purification\nstep, except replacing 2.4 \u03bcL of P5 primer with 2.4 \u03bcL\nof ddH2O. After purification, linearly amplified RPA products\nwere subjected to eight cycles of PCR with P5 primer and end sequence\nof P7 primer (Table S3).\n\nAll NGS samples were prepared\nusing the 5\u00d7 ER/A-tailing Enzyme Mix (Enzymatics, USA) and WGS\nligase (Enzymatics, USA) without deviating from the manufacturer\u2019s\nprotocol. DNA was first mixed with the ER/A-tailing enzyme mix and\nincubated at 20 \u00b0C for 30 min and 65 \u00b0C for 30 min. Sequencing\nadaptor (10 \u03bcL) from NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (NEB,\nUSA) and WGS ligase were added to the A-tailed product. After ligation\nfor 30 min at 23 \u00b0C, 3 \u03bcL of USER enzyme mix (New England\nBioLabs, USA) was directly mixed into the ligation tube and incubated\nfor 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. The USER cleaved product was then purified\nusing Agencourt AMPure XP beads with a 1.2\u00d7 excess volume of\nUSER cleaved product (Beckman-Coulter, USA). The products were amplified\nwith either PCR or RPA using the index primer pairs provided in the\nNEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina kit. The product was purified\nusing AMPure XP beads with a 1.2\u00d7 excess volume of AMPure XP\nbeads and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq platform.\n\nWe used the AdapterRemoval,27 BWA,28 SAMtools,29 and in-house python scripts to analyze read\ncounts, sequencing depths, and uniformities of each library.\n\nIn this study, we used five different\nDNA libraries. Four were generated by random shearing of human NA12878\nand E. coli EcNR226 genomic DNA. Human NA12878 genomic DNA was purchased from\nthe Coriell Institute (USA). E. coli EcNR2 strain was incubated in Luria\u2013Bertani media (BD Biosciences,\nUSA) at 30 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator. After harvesting EcNR2\ncells by centrifugation, we precipitated the genomic DNA using the\nGeneAll Exgene Cell SV Kit (GeneAll, Korea) according to the manufacturer\u2019s\nprotocol. Both genomic DNAs were sheared into 180 bp and 300 bp fragments\nusing a M220 focused ultrasonicator (Covaris, USA). The size of sheared\nDNA was measured by agarose gel electrophoresis and an Agilent 4200\nTapeStation system (Agilent, USA).\n\nThe microarray oligonucleotide\nlibrary was designed to have a thousand\nunique 150 bp sequences and synthesized with the DNA microarray synthesizer\n(CustomArray, USA). Each sequence possessed a 30 bp flanking sequence\nat both sides, which is complementary to the RPA primer. The terminal\n20 bp at each end sequence possessed a Tm value near 60 \u00b0C, enabling their use as a primer pair for PCR."}
