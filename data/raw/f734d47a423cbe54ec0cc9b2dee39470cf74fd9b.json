{"title": "Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Knowledge and Perceptions: A Survey of Healthcare Workers", "body": "Coronavirus (CoV) infections are emerging respiratory viruses and are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] . CoV is a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted via animal-to-human and human-to-human interaction [2] . Multiple epidemic outbreaks occurred during 2002 (SARS), with ~800 deaths, and 2012 (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: MERS-CoV), with 860 deaths [2, 3] .\n\nApproximately eight years after the MERS-CoV epidemic, the current outbreak of novel coronavirus in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, has emerged as a global outbreak and significant public health issue [4] . On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) [5] . Astonishingly, in the first week of March, a devastating number of new cases were reported globally, and COVID-19 emerged as a pandemic. As of 12 March 2020, more than 125,000 confirmed cases across 118 countries and more than 4600 deaths had been reported [6] .\n\nCOVID-19 is spread by human-to-human transmission through droplet, feco-oral, and direct contact and has an incubation period of 2-14 days [6] . To date, no antiviral treatment or vaccine has been explicitly recommended for COVID-19. Therefore, applying preventive measures to control COVID-19 infection is the most critical intervention. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are the primary sector in contact with patients and are an important source of exposure to infected cases in healthcare settings; thus, HCWs are expected to be at high risk of infection. By the end of January, the WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had published recommendations for the prevention and control of COVID-19 for HCWs [8, 9] . The WHO also initiated several online training sessions and materials on COVID-19 in various languages to strengthen preventive strategies, including raising awareness and training HCWs in preparedness activities [10] .

In this regard, the COVID-19 epidemic offers a unique opportunity to investigate the level of knowledge and perceptions of HCWs during this global health crisis. In addition, we aim to explore the role of different information sources in shaping HCWs' knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 during this peak period.\n\nA prospective Web-based cross-sectional study was conducted using a survey instrument to obtain responses from HCWs globally during the first week of March 2020.\n\nA 23-item survey instrument was developed using WHO course materials on emerging respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 [14] . The survey covered the domains of HCW characteristics, awareness, information sources, knowledge and perceptions related to COVID-19. The developed draft survey instrument was distributed to ten randomly selected faculty members to assess its readability and validity before pretesting among 20 randomly selected HCWs for clarity, relevance, and acceptability. Refinements were made as required to facilitate better comprehension and to organize the questions before the final survey was distributed to the study population.\n\nThe survey instrument comprised 23 closed-ended questions and took approximately 3 minutes to complete. The 23-item questionnaire was divided into three parts, including participant characteristics (3 items), awareness of COVID-19 (2 items), source of information author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033381 doi: medRxiv preprint 1]. Sufficient time was given to participants to read, comprehend, and answer all the questions.\n\nConfidentiality of the study participants' information was maintained throughout the study by making the participants' information anonymous and asking the participants to provide honest answers. Eligible HCWs' participation in this survey was voluntary and was not compensated. Informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to participation.\n\nThe study was performed following the Helsinki Declaration as revised in 2013. The study was conducted following the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys \n\nThe obtained data were coded, validated, and analyzed using SPSS version 24 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive analysis was applied to calculate the frequencies and proportions. The chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nA total of 529 HCWs participated, 453 of whom completed the study questionnaire (85.6% response rate), including 234 (51.6%) men and 219 (48.3%) women; most of the participants were below 44 years of age (82.4%). The majority of participants were doctors (n=137, 30.2%) or medical students (n=134, 29.6%) and were from Asia (68%). Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants. Almost all participants agreed that they had heard about COVID-19 (97.8%), but only 44.1% of them had the opportunity to attend lectures/discussions about COVID-19.\n\n.

Approximately 30% of the participants reported that they used news media (TV/video, magazines, newspapers, and radio) and social media (Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat) to obtain information about COVID-19.\n\nMoreover, nearly 40% of the participants sometimes discussed COVID-19-related topics with family and friends. Table 2 shows the knowledge about COVID-19 among HCWs. We identified significant knowledge gaps between doctors and other HCWs. For instance, approximately two-thirds of doctors and half of allied health workers thought that the origin of COVID-19 was bats (65.7% vs. 55.7%, p<0.05). A high majority of the HCWs (85.6%) agreed that maintaining hand hygiene, covering the nose and mouth while coughing, and avoiding sick patients could help to prevent COVID-19 transmission. A majority of the doctors agreed that COVID-19 could lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death (84%, p<0.05) and that supportive care is the only treatment option that is currently available (83.2%, p<0.05). However, the participants' knowledge about questions related to the mode of transmission and incubation period of COVID-19 was poor (p<0.05).\n\nOver 78% of the HCWs exhibited a positive perception of COVID-19. A high majority of the HCWs knew that sick patients should share their recent travel history (92.7%), that flu vaccination is not sufficient to prevent COVID-19 (90.7%), and that COVID-19 is not fatal (88.5%). In addition, 87% felt that washing hands with soap and water could help to prevent .

Moreover, a significant proportion of the doctors perceived eating well-cooked/handled meat to be safe (83.2%) (p<0.05).\n\nMedical students were found to have the perception that flu vaccination is not sufficient to prevent COVID-19 transmission (88%, p<0.05). A large number of allied health workers incorrectly believed that it is not safe to eat well-processed meat during the COVID-19 outbreak (25.3%, p<0.05), that COVID-19 is fatal (21.5%), that there is a delay in symptoms (19.8%), and that flu vaccination is sufficient (19.8%; p<0.05) compared with other participants in the respective groups. However, a finding of considerable concern is that 60% of HCWs used social media as a source of information. Currently, the vast diversity of information available through the Internet, including unverified malicious information, can spread quickly and can misguide HCWs. In particular, health authorities and scientists have warned that widespread misinformation about COVID-19 is a serious concern causing xenophobia worldwide [4, [16] [17] [18] [19] . In this regard, HCWs should carefully evaluate COVID-19-related information and should use scientific and authentic content as information sources.\n\nThe findings of this study suggest significant knowledge gaps between the amount of information available about COVID-19 and the depth of knowledge among HCWs, particularly about the mode of transmission and incubation period of COVID-19.\n\nAdditionally, many allied health workers had inaccurate knowledge that COVID-19 can be treated with antivirals and that there is a vaccine available. This is unfortunate because the surge of COVID-19 is globally devastating, and a large number of resources are provided by healthcare authorities to educate HCWs and improve their knowledge about COVID-19. Therefore, our findings were disappointing. Greater encouragement from health authorities is needed to assimilate COVID-19-related knowledge among HCWs, including doctors.\n\n.

However, discrepancies were identified in the perceptions of different categories of HCWs. For instance, only half (52%) of the HCWs aged 45-65 years believed that the symptoms of COVID-19 appeared as early as 2 to 14 days (p<0.05), and more than a quarter of the medical students thought that eating meat during the outbreak was unsafe.\n\nApproximately 20% of allied health workers believed that the flu vaccine is sufficient for COVID-19 prevention. Finally, a vast majority of HCWs strongly agreed that maintaining hygiene activities, reporting recent travel history when individuals are sick, and cleaning the equipment used in wet markets are strongly recommended.\n\nWe used WHO training material for the detection, prevention, response, and control of COVID-19 to develop a validated questionnaire. The developed questionnaire was pilot\n\ntested, and open-ended questions were limited to reduce information bias.\n\nHowever, this study has some limitations that should be considered. This is a cross-sectional study conducted online among HCWs during alarming cases reported globally in the first week of March 2020. In addition, the data presented in this study are self-reported and partly dependent on the participants' honesty and recall ability; thus, they may be subject to recall bias. Finally, due to the four-week closure of higher educational institutions in the UAE during the COVID-19 outbreak [16], the institutional review board was not approached.\n\nDespite these limitations, our findings provide valuable information about the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs during a peak period of COVID-19.\n\nWe identified a significant gap in the source of information, poor knowledge levels, and discrepancies in perceptions of COVID-19 among our study participants.
