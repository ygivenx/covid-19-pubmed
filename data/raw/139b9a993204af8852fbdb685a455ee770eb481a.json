{"title": "Favipiravir versus Arbidol for COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial", "body": "Beginning from Dec. 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, followed has spread rapidly throughout China. As of Mar. 14, 600mg/time from the second day to the end of the experiment, twice a day). The control group (arbidol) was treated with routine therapy + arbidol (200 mg each time, 3 times a day, from the first day to the end of the trial). The course of treatment in both groups was 7-10 days. If necessary, the treatment time could be extended to 10 days according to the judgment of researchers. Except arbidol and famiravir, some other drugs were used for conventional therapy and symptomatic treatment to improve adverse reactions. The details of drugs use were listed in Supplementary   Table S1 .\n\nThe primary outcome was the clinical recovery rate at 7 days or the end of treatment.\n\nResults were stratified for moderate patients with COVID-19, severe patients with COVID-19, COVID-19 patients with hypertension and/or diabetes. Clinical recovery was defined as continuous (>72 hours) recovery of body temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and cough relief after treatment. It needs to meet several conditions: axillary temperature\u226436.6\u00b0C; respiratory frequency\u226424 times/min; Oxygen saturation\u226598% without oxygen inhalation; mild or no cough. The armpit temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation without oxygen, oxygen therapy and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) were recorded in daily follow-up. Repeated measurements were made at least twice in each follow-up. The measurements were taken after 15 minutes rest at room temperature (23\u00b12\u00b0C).\n\nSecondary outcomes included the time from randomization to fever reduction (patients with fever at the time of enrollment), the time from randomization to cough All rights reserved.

Table 2) .\n\nComparison of duration of fever, cough relief time and auxiliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rate Table 3 displayed duration of fever, cough relief time and auxiliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rate between the favipiravir and arbidol groups.\n\nFor 98 moderate patients in the favipiravir group, 57 had a fever and 60 had a cough;\n\nfor 111 moderate patients in the arbidol group, 65 had a fever and 64 had a cough. For moderate patients, the time of fever reduction and cough relief in the favipiravir group was significantly shorter than that in the arbidol group (P<0.0001).\n\nFor 42 patients with hypertension and/or diabetes in the favipiravir group, 28 had a fever and 25 had a cough; of 35 patients with hypertension and/or diabetes in the All rights reserved.

For patients with hypertension and/or diabetes, the time of fever reduction and cough relief in the favipiravir group was also significantly shorter than that in the arbidol group (P<0.0001). \n\nDuring this trial, we detected some antiviral-associated adverse effects. 37 adverse effects cases in the favipiravir group and 28 cases in the arbidol group were observed.
