{"title": "The development of vaccines against SARS corona virus in mice and SCID-PBL/hu mice", "body": "The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new type of corona virus, SARS corona virus (SARS CoV) [1] [2] [3] . SARS has infected more than 8400 patients in about 7 months in over 30 countries and caused more than 800 deaths. The deadly epidemic has had significant impacts on many health, social, economic and political aspects. SARS is assumed to resurge in the near future. However, no SARS vaccine is currently available for clinical use. Therefore, we have developed novel vaccine 0264 candidates against SARS CoV using cDNA constructs encoding the structural antigens; S, M, E, or N protein. In immunized mice, neutralizing antibodies against the virus and T cell immunity against virus-infected-cells were studied, since these immunities play important roles in protection against many virus infections. In particular, CD8 + CTL plays an important role in T cell immunity dependent protection against virus infections and the eradication of murine and human cancers [4, 5] . In the present study, a type II alveolar epithelial cell clone, T7, was used for analyzing precise mechanism of CTL against SARS CoV membrane antigens, as the SARS-CoV infects alveolar epithelial cell in the lungs [6] . Furthermore, the SCID-PBL/hu model, which is capable of analyzing in vivo human immune response, was also used because it is a more relevant translational model for human cases [4] .\n\nThree kinds of SARS CoV strains: HKU39849(1), TW-1 and FFM-1(2) and their cDNAs were used. S, M, N or E cDNA was transferred into pcDNA 3.1(+) vector and pcDNA 3.1(+)/vs-His Topo (QIAGEN K K, Tokyo, Japan). These genes were expressed in eukaryotic cells and Escherichia coli. pcDNA 3.1(+) vector, 50 g each, containing SARS S, M, N, or E DNA was injected i.m. (M.tibia anterior) into C57BL/6 mice (female, 8 weeks CLEA Japan Inc, Japan) and BALB/c mice (female, 8 weeks) three times, at an interval of 7 days. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV in the serum from the mice immunized with SARS S, M, N or -E DNA vaccines were assayed by use of Vero-E6 cell. CTL activity against SARS CoV was studied using human type II alveolar epithelial cells, T7, expressing SARS antigens [6] . PBL from healthy human volunteers were administered i.p. into IL-2 receptor \u2425-chain disrupted NOD SCID mice [IL-2R(\u2212/\u2212) NOD-SCID], and SCID-PBL/hu mice were constructed [4] . SARS DNA vaccines at 50 g were injected i.m. into the SCID-PBL/hu mice. CTL activity of human CD8-positive lymphocytes in the spleen from SCID-PBL/hu was assessed using IFN-\u2425 production and 51Cr-release assay [4, 5] .\n\nSpleen cells from C57BL/6 mice immunized with SARS-S, -M, -N or -E DNA vaccine were cultured with syngeneic T7 lung cells transfected with S, M, N or E cDNA. pcDNA 3.1(+) SARS (N) DNA vaccine induced significantly CTL activity (IFN-\u2425 production) against N cDNA transfected T7 cells (Fig. 1A) . Similarly, SARS M DNA vaccine induced SARS antigen M-specific CTL against T7 cells transfected with SARS M DNA (data not shown). \n\nThe proliferation of splenic T cells stimulated by coculture either with T7 cells transfected with M DNA or SARS M peptide (TW1 M102-116) was strongly augmented by M DNA vaccine (data not shown). SARS N DNA vaccine also induced proliferation of splenic T cells in the presence of recombinant N protein as well as N DNA-transfected T7 cells (Fig. 1B) . Thus, both SARS N DNA vaccine and \n\nThe M DNA vaccine enhanced the CTL activity and proliferation in the presence of M peptide in SCID-PBL/hu mice (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, the SARS N DNA vaccine induced CTL activity (IFN-\u2425 production by recombinant N protein or N protein pulsed-autologous B blast cells) and proliferation of spleen cells in SCID-PBL/hu mice (Fig. 3) . From these results, it was demonstrated that SARS M DNA vaccine and N DNA vaccine induced human CTL and human T cell proliferative responses.\n\nWe have demonstrated that SARS (M) DNA and (N) DNA vaccines induce virus-specific immune responses (CTL and T cell proliferation) in the mouse systems using type II lung alveolar T cell lines in clone target models [6] . These DNA vaccines induced SARS-CoV-specific CTL and T cell proliferation in vivo human immune systems using SCID-PBL/hu. Gao et al. developed adenovirus based a SARS DNA vaccine encoding S1 polypeptide was capable of inducing neutralizing antibody, while another SARS DNA vaccine encoding N protein generated IFN-\u2425 producing T cells in rhesus monkeys [7] . SARS S DNA vaccine which elicits effective neutralizing antibody responses that generate protective immunity in a mouse model [8] . However its immunogenicity in humans has yet to be established. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the efficacy of SARS DNA vaccine in a SCID-PBL/hu mice, which is a highly relevant translational model for demonstrating human immune responsiveness. Recently, SARS DNA vaccines capable of inducing human neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV have been established by our SCID-PBL/hu model. It has been demonstrated that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for the SARS CoV [9] . A transgenic mouse with human ACE-2 may be useful as an animal model of SARS. Furthermore, ACE-2 transgenic SCID mice should be useful as a human model for pre-clinical trial for SARS vaccines, since ACE-transgenic SCID-PBL/hu model could analyze the human immune responses against SARS infection in vivo. The effect of combination immunization with such SARS vaccines and neutralizing antibody dependent DNA vaccine is now being studied. These DNA vaccines should provide a useful tool for development of protective vaccines."}
