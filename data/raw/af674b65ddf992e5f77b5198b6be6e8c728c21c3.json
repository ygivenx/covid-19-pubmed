Then the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (125 mL acid digestion vessel no. 4748, Parr, France) and heated at 250 \uf0b0C for 5 h. The resulting product was cooled to room temperature and dialyzed against Milli-Q water using a cellulose ester dialysis membrane for 24 h (Biotech CE N\u00b0131093, pore size 500-1000 Da) in order to remove unreacted small molecules. The yield was about 40 % and the stock solution was stored at 4 \uf0b0C.\n\nCQDs-5 particles were prepared according to the protocol described recently by us. 2 Phenylboronic acid (200 mg) was dissolved in water (20 mL) and the pH was adjusted to 9.0 by adding NaOH (1 M). The solution was degassed with nitrogen gas during 1 h in order to remove dissolved oxygen and heated in a Teflon-lined autoclave chamber (125 mLacid digestion vessel N\u00b04748, Parr, France) for 8 h at 160 \u00b0C. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was dialyzed against water for 24 h with water being changed every 6 h (SpectraPor 1, pore size: 1000 Da). The formed functional CQDs-5 (200 \u00b5L) were dried and then weighed with a Sartorius microbalance (TG 209 F3 Tarsus\u00ae, Netzsch) to estimate the exact mass.\n\nParticles were lyophilized and stored at 4 \u00b0C until use.\n\nCQDs-6 particles were prepared according to the protocol recently described by us. 2 In short, 4-aminophenylboronic acid (200 mg) was dissolved in Milli-Q water (20 mL) and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 9.0 by adding NaOH (1 M). The solution was degassed with nitrogen gas during 1 h in order to remove dissolved oxygen and heated in a Teflon-lined autoclave chamber (125 mLacid digestion vessel N\u00b04748, Parr, France) for 8 h at 160 \u00b0C.\n\nAfter cooling to room temperature, the solution was centrifuged at 10.000 rpm during 30 min to remove large precipitates and dialyzed against water for 24 h with water being changed every 6 h (SpectraPor 1, pore size: 1000 Da). The formed functional CQDs-6 (200 \u00b5L) were dried and then weighed with a Sartorius microbalance (TG 209 F3 Tarsus\u00ae, Netzsch) to estimate the exact mass.\n\nAniline hydrochloride (200 mg) was dissolved in degassed Milli-Q water (20 mL) and the pH was adjusted to 9 with aqueous 1M NaOH. The solution was further degassed with N2 for 30 min and transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave chamber (125 mL; acid digestion vessel n\u00b04748, Parr, France), which was heated at 160 \u00b0C for 8 h. After cooling down the autoclave to room temperature, the raw medium was dialyzed against Milli-Q water for 24 h (water renewed every 6 h; SpectraPor1 RC membrane; cut-off: 1 kDa).\n\nFluorescence spectroscopy of the raw medium showed mainly aniline fluorescence, together with a slight shoulder that could indicate the presence of CQDs. Nevertheless, after dialysis, only aniline fluorescence remains.\n\nIn a second attempt, aniline hydrochloride (100 mg) was dissolved in ethanol (40 mL) and the solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave chamber (125 mL; acid digestion vessel n\u00b04748, Parr, France), which was heated at 180 \u00b0C for 12 h. 3 After cooling down the autoclave to room temperature, the raw dark orange medium was evaporated under vacuum and redispersed in water (15 mL) for purification by dialysis (turbid dispersion). Dialysis against Milli-Q water for a few hours (SpectraPor1 RC membrane; cut-off: 1 kDa) did not help to obtain a clear dispersion.The aqueous fraction remains almost colorless, whereas the organic fraction is dark orange. The organic fraction was evaporated under vacuum and purified by silica gel chromatography (eluent: CH2Cl2/MeOH 94/6 \uf022 91/9) as described in the reference above.\n\nNanoparticles are poorly dispersible in water with an estimated yield below 1%.\n\nFourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a ThermoScientific FTIR instrument (Nicolet 8700) in the 650 -4000 cm -1 range at a spectral resolution of 6 cm -1 . 1 mg of dried sample was mixed with 200 mg of KBr powder in an agar mortar. The mixture was pressed into a pellet under 7 tons of load for 2-4 min, and the spectrum was recorded immediately. A total of 64 accumulative scans were collected. The signal from a pure KBr pellet was subtracted as a background.\n\nX-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using ESCALAB 220 XL spectrometer from Vacuum Generators featuring a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 X-ray source (1486.6 eV) and a spherical energy analyzer operated in the CAE (constant analyzer energy) mode (CAE = 100 eV for survey spectra and CAE = 40 eV for high-resolution spectra), using S-4 the electromagnetic lens mode. The angle between the incident X-rays and the analyzer is 58\u00b0 and the detection angle of the photoelectrons is 30\u00b0.\n\nRaman Spectroscopy measurements were performed on a LabRam HR Micro-Raman system (Horiba Jobin Yvon) using a 473-nm laser diode as excitation source. Visible light is focused by a 100\u00d7 objective. The scattered light is collected by the same objective in backscattering configuration, dispersed by a 1800 mm focal length monochromator and detected by a CCD camera. "}
