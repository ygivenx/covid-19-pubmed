{"title": "Identification of the relative timing of infectiousness 1 and symptom onset for outbreak control 2", "body": "The timing of infectiousness relative to symptom onset has been identified as a key factor in 21 ability to control an outbreak (11). The explanation is intuitive: If symptoms appear before 22 infectiousness, then contact tracing and isolation strategies will be effective, whereas for post-23 infectiousness symptom presentation, broader, non-symptom based strategies must be adopted.\n\nEpidemic model 90 We demonstrate using an example system of a novel infectious disease, spreading in a popu-91 lation structured into households. We assume that the population is large and mixing between 92 households is random, such that after a household is initially infected, the remaining transmis-93 sion within the household is independent of transmission outside the household (5, 27). There-94 fore, transmission dynamics within households can be modelled independently (4). Given this 95 novel etiological agent, we wish to determine if symptom onset occurs at the time of infection, 96 infectiousness, or recovery (i.e., these are the three candidate models we wish to discriminate). 97 The model behaviours are otherwise assumed identical. To be emphatic, the underlying disease 98 dynamics is identical in all three models, each differing only in when observations are made, 99 corresponding to different timings of symptom onset (Figure 1a) . 100 101 We model the epidemic dynamics in households as a continuous-time Markov chain ( Figure   102 1a) (15). Individuals transition from susceptible (S) to exposed (E), then to infectious (I), and 103 finally to recovered (R), with rates as described in Table 1. 104 Table 1 : Events, transitions and rates within a household.\n\nTransition Rate Infection (S, I) \u2192 (S \u2212 1, E + 1) \u03b2SI/(N \u2212 1) Infectiousness (E, I) \u2192 (E \u2212 1, I + 1) \u03c3E Recovery (I, R) \u2192 (I \u2212 1, R + 1) \u03b3I\n\nWe assign a distribution to each parameter (Supplemental Figure S1 ), based on physical 105 quantities to reflect the assumed prior knowledge of the etiological agent:\n\n\u2022 1 \u03c3 \u223c Gamma(6, 1/2), representing a mean exposed duration of 3 days (mode at approxi- -Sample a set of parameters \u03b8 = (R 0 , \u03c3, \u03b3) from the (prior) distributions.\n\n-Simulate N h households given these parameters.\n\n-Repeat this process N s times.

That is, we count the propor-148 tion of households that, on day d, observed an incidence of i, and then use the resultant (design Conducting a First Few Hundred-style study can be extremely labour intensive. Consequently, 155 we wish to assess the potential for model discrimination when sampling is only performed on a 156 subset of days, rather than every day. If we choose to only sample on D < 14 days, within the 157 first 14 days following the first symptomatic case in each household, we must necessarily also 158 choose the optimal days on which to sample. We choose those days that produce the highest The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/571547 doi: bioRxiv preprint Rather than evaluating the full set of possible designs, or applying an optimisation algorithm, 165 we propose a heuristic for efficiently finding high-quality designs of a given size. This heuristic 166 is to perform random forest model selection on the largest possible design, extract the random 167 forest feature importance Figure 1b) , and use this random forest feature importance to rank 168 design points. Specifically, days are ranked on their maximum feature importance; the sum of 169 the importance of features from a day was also tested, but had inferior performance. A design 170 of size d uses the highest-ranked d design points. The random forest feature importance metric 171 we use is the mean decrease in Gini impurity (24) of a feature across the trees in the random 172 forest (this metric is easily extracted from the python scikit-learn random forest algorithm (23)).\n\nRandom forest-based Bayesian model discrimination was able to accurately discriminate rela- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/571547 doi: bioRxiv preprint known epidemic parameters produced substantial increases in accuracy (Supplemental Figure   195 S3).\n\nThe key design points (i.e., sampling days) for optimal designs were consistently the first 197 day (Figure 2b) , followed by other days early in the outbreak (i.e., days 2-4), and the final 198 sampling day (day 14). Days 6-13 typically had little impact on model discrimination accuracy 199 (i.e., optimal Accuracy consistently levelled off as design size increased beyond 5; Figure 1d , 200 Supplemental Figure S3 ), and the optimal combination of these days varied due to stochasticity 201 in both training and test data. This is consistent with the feature importance used to develop 202 the heuristic (Figure 1b) , i.e., those days that were consistently optimal were those with highest 203 feature importance. It is remarkable that it is possible to discriminate models so accurately, given that they share 220 identical epidemic dynamics, and only differ in observation. The non-parametric nature of the 221 random forest is able to use small but clear differences between models (e.g., Figure 2c ) to 222 extract sufficient information to discriminate them. Combining the raw household data to form 223 summary statistics is critical to this: if the raw household data is used rather than the summary Figure 1 : (a) Model schematic describing: transitions between states within each household continuous-time Markov chain; the three observation models being discriminated between; and, the way that these household-level data are observed.
