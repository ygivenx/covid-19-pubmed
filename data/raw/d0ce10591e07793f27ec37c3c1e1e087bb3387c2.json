{"title": "", "body": "Recent outbreaks of respiratory tract infectious diseases have brought greater attention to the need for respiratory protection for healthcare workers. [1] [2] [3] When there is a high probability of airborne transmission of an infectious agent, sound scientific principles support the use of P2 respirators to attempt to prevent transmission. 4 The current Australian National Health and Medical Council (NHRMC) guidelines recommend that 'in order for a P2 respirator to offer the maximum desired protection it is essential that the wearer is properly fitted and trained in its safe use'. 4 The terms 'properly fitted' and 'trained' are further expanded upon in the NHMRC guidelines that describe two procedures: a 'fit check' and a 'fit test'. 'Fit check' is the term used to describe the process by which healthcare workers self check the fit of their respirator to ensure the respirator is sealed over the bridge of the nose and mouth and that there are no gaps between the respirator and the face. 4 'Fit test' is the term used to describe a procedure identifying which size and style of P2 respirator is suitable for an individual and ensuring that it is worn correctly.\n\nThere are two methods used to undertake fit testing: qualitative and quantitative. Quantitative fit testing methods are considered the gold standard method and measure leakage into the respirator. 5 Methods for quantitative fit testing are described in AS/NZS 1715 : 2009 and require the use of specialised equipment by a trained operator. The qualitative fit testing procedure is most commonly used in healthcare settings and is a pass/fail test to assess respirator fit, based on an individual's response to a test agent. Qualitative fit testings require the purchase and use of fit testing solutions and associated equipment. Although fast and simple to do, qualitative fit tests have the limitation of being influenced by the wearer. If used in high volume, the solutions used in qualitative fit testing are expensive and may not be readily available, as was our experience in Tasmania during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The aim of this study is to determine, when undertaking qualitative fit testing, if there is any difference in performance between a commercially available fit testing solution, a fit testing solution made locally and a placebo.\n\nThis was a single-site, blinded crossover study conducted in Tasmania, Australia.\n\nThe study took place within the Population Health Department of the Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS) in Hobart, Australia, from January 2010 to September 2011.\n\nEligible participants were adult volunteers aged 18 or over who worked for the Tasmanian DHHS. Information regarding the study was advertised in various locations with the DHHS and participants subsequently nominated themselves. Patients with a known reaction to any products contained in the fit testing solutions were excluded from the study. Persons who had eaten, drunk any fluids or smoked 30 min before participating in the trial were excluded until 30 min had passed.\n\nThree different fit testing solutions, a commercial product, a homemade product and a placebo (water) were decanted into identical-appearing bottles by an infectious diseases pharmacist at the Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmania. All solutions appeared identical. All other researchers involved in this study were blinded to the contents of each bottle by the pharmacist.\n\nHomemade product The homemade solution was developed by using artificial sweetener containing saccharine which was dissolved in sterile water. This product was made to the same concentration as the commercially available product. More specifically, to make the homemade solution, 830 mg of sodium saccharine was dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water. To make a threshold solution, another 100 mL of distilled water was added to 1 mL of the fit testing solution. A 'threshold' solution is a diluted fit testing solution.\n\nThe commercially available fit testing solution contained 45% sodium saccharin and 95% water, whilst the threshold fit test solution contained <1.0% sodium saccharin and 99% water.\n\nThe placebo was sterile water.\n\nThe fit testing procedure was performed in a accordance with the manufacturer's instructions for the commercial products, the Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services and the United States Occupation Health and Safety Administration. 6, 7 To begin the intervention, a fit testing solution was chosen randomly by the researcher from the three available groups of solutions (i.e. commercial, homemade or placebo). A threshold test was then performed on the participant who was also blinded to the solution used. A threshold test determines the participants' ability to taste a weak solution of the challenge agent. 8 This procedure involved spraying the threshold solution into a hood worn by the participant until the solution could be tasted or until 30 sprays were administered. Participants were asked if they could taste anything throughout the procedure. The threshold number (number of sprays) was recorded. If the participant could taste the solution, they were deemed to have passed the threshold test. If the participant could not taste the solution, they were deemed to have failed.\n\nFor those participants who passed the threshold testing stage a P2 (N95) respirator was donned by the participant and a fit check and fit test was performed. The fit test used the full strength solution to verify that the wearer could achieve an acceptable facial fit with the respirator. The testing at this stage involved another three steps:\n\n(1) The researcher chose a fit testing solution at random (2) The fit testing procedure was performed (Table 1) (3) A record was made of whether the person tasted (failed) or did not taste (passed) the test Once the fit testing procedure was completed and 15 min was allowed to elapse (or until the participant could not taste Implications * There is a potential to make fit testing solutions locally, with efficacy equal to that of commercial products. * A practical option for making a fit testing solution is provided, in the event that a commercial product is unavailable. * The usefulness of qualitative fit testing is questionable.\n\nthe solution), another threshold and fit testing procedure was performed on the same person, using a solution from one of the remaining two solution groups. Threshold and fit testing was performed using these solutions as described earlier. Once this was completed, the process was repeated for the remaining solution group. The test concluded when each participant had had a threshold and fit testing procedure conducted using solutions from all three groups (homemade, commercial, placebo). Fig. 1 summarises this process. Three different researchers over the study period conducted the fit testing, however a documented procedure was used to limit practice variation.\n\nThe rainbow passage referred to in Table 1 is as follows:\n\n'When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colours. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.' 7\n\nFor each fit test and solution used, a record was made as to whether the participant tasted the solution (failed) or did not taste the solution (passed). Once the testing of a participant was complete, the fit testing equipment and hood were cleaned with warm water and neutral detergent.\n\nA data collection sheet was developed to record outcomes from each participant and solution. This information was subsequently entered into a database (SPSS Version 20.0, IBM Corporation, New York, USA). Data collected were gender, fit testing solution code, threshold level and pass/fail, pass/fail of the fit testing procedure, and type of respirator used. Once the data was entered into SPSS, the solutions used in the study were unblinded by the pharmacist.\n\nVerbal consent from each participant was obtained before the commencement of the study and an information sheet was provided. Ethics approval for this study was granted by the Tasmanian Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number H0010996) and the provision of verbal consent deemed appropriate. The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol described and approved by the ethics committee.\n\nThere were 48 people in this study. Thirty-seven (77%) of participants were female. All participants used a Kimberley Clark P2 (N95) respirator. At the threshold testing stage, four participants (8.3%) did not taste any solution. They did not proceed onto the next stage of fit testing.\n\nOf the remaining participants, at the threshold testing stage, eight (16.7%) people could taste the placebo, 43 (89.6%) could taste the commercial solution, and 44 (91.7%) could taste the homemade solution. All persons who could taste the commercial solution could taste the homemade solution.\n\nOf all who passed the threshold testing stage and who were subsequently fit tested, 40 (91%) passed the fit test. Of the four persons who failed the fit test, three could taste both the homemade and commercial solution. One person could taste the commercial product but passed using the homemade product. \n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of the solutions used in qualitative fit testing. There are two main points of interest from this study, which could lead to further debate and discussion. First, 17% of participants could taste the placebo. Second, the commercial product and the homemade product performed almost identically at both the threshold and fit testing stages of this procedure. The first point of interest relates to the broader issue of the efficacy of qualitative fit testing and it is not the purpose of this paper to explore this. This issue, coupled with decisions around which respirator to use in a given situation are debated elsewhere. [9] [10] [11] [12] Findings from this study suggest that it is possible to make a homemade fit testing solution simply by using readily available artificial sweeteners. Such a finding needs to be replicated in larger size studies, using different research designs and different masks. Nonetheless, this study tests a novel process of using homemade fit testing solutions. Furthermore, should another pandemic occur and fit testing solutions become unavailable when qualitative fit testing is required, we provide an alternative that appears to be comparable to a commercially available product.\n\nThis study has several implications for practice and policy. We provide a practical option for making a fit testing solution, should a commercial product be unavailable or deemed too expensive. With respect to policy, our study casts considerable doubt over the usefulness of qualitative fit testing in general, given the significant percentage of participants who claimed to taste the placebo.\n\nThe study only examined one type of P2 (N95) respirator. It is possible that participants would have had a different result if they wore a different respirator. Furthermore, there were three different persons who conducted the fit tests and we could not control for potential operator variation.\n\nThe findings of our study suggest that fit testing solutions could be made locally and be equally effective as commercial products. A homemade fit testing solution can be made by dissolving 830 mg of sodium saccharine into 100 mL of distilled water.\n\nOne of the authors has an editorial affiliation with Healthcare Infection.
