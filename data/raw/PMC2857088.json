{"title": "Self-assembly of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Membrane\nProtein*", "body": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause common respiratory\nand enteric diseases in humans and domesticated animals (1). They are serologically classified as two groups of mammalian coronaviruses\nplus one group consisting of an avian infectious bronchitis virus and a turkey coronavirus\n(1, 2). The\ngenome structure and encoded proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\n(SARS-CoV)3 are similar but not identical\nto members of the three classified groups, therefore a new classification has been\nestablished for SARS-CoV (3\u20136). Coronavirus genome\nsize ranges from 27 to 32 kb, the largest among known RNA viruses. The gene order is\n5\u2032-pol-S-E-M-N-3, which encodes viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and four\nstructural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M, formerly referred to as E1), and\nnucleocapsid (N) (1, 3).\n\nCoronavirus replication occurs entirely in host cell cytoplasm, with four structural\nproteins translated from different viral RNA transcripts (3). Translated on free polysomes, the highly basic N (\u223c50\u201360 kDa)\ninteracts with newly synthesized viral genomic RNA to form helical nucleocapsids (7). The M membrane glycoprotein is translated on\nmembrane-bound polysomes, inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and transported to\nthe Golgi complex (8, 9). M interacts with nucleocapsids on cell membranes, most likely at the ER or\nGolgi complex (10\u201314). S and E are\nalso translated on membrane-bound polysomes, inserted into ER, and transported to the Golgi\ncomplex. This complex is where E and M proteins interact and trigger virion budding, with\nnucleocapsids enclosed (7, 15). S is incorporated into virions via interactions with M. Virions\naccumulate in large, smooth walled vesicles that eventually fuse with the plasma membrane,\nthus releasing virions into extracellular spaces (3).\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that M and E expression is sufficient for virus-like\nparticle (VLP) formation (16\u201318), implying that S and\nN are not essential for coronavirus particle assembly. M is the most abundant coronavirus\nstructural protein, with an expression level in host cells \u223c100-fold greater than\nthat of E (18). Except for M proteins in the\ntransmissible gastroenteritis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus, both of which\nare capable of reaching the plasma membrane (19\u201321), the\nM proteins of other coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV M) localize exclusively at the\nER/Golgi area, where virus assembly and budding takes place (22\u201324). Nevertheless, it is well established that M plays a key role in directing\nvirus assembly and determining viral budding sites (25, 26). Similar to other coronavirus M\nproteins, SARS-CoV M spans the lipid bilayer three times (7). According to recent studies, deletion mutations involving the SARS-CoV M\ntransmembrane domain can affect M subcellular localization (27) and disrupt VLP assembly (28). Although\nefficient SARS-CoV VLP production requires the combined expression of M, N, and E (29), M plus N (28,\n30) or M plus E (31, 32) have been identified as minimum\nrequirements for VLP formation. SARS-CoV M has been detected in medium when expressed alone\n(32), but the released M molecules have not been\ncharacterized in detail, and the molecular basis of M secretions has not been elucidated.\nFurthermore, M plasma membrane localization remains equivocal. The transmissible\ngastroenteritis virus M protein has been described as capable of reaching the plasma\nmembrane (19, 20) and of intracellular localization (33).\nResults from one study failed to indicate plasma membrane labeling of SARS-CoV M (34), but results from another study indicate that\nSARS-CoV M is detectable on cell surfaces as well as in Golgi compartments (35).\n\nHere we demonstrate that SARS-CoV M, either tagged or untagged with an EGFP or DsRed\nfluorescent protein, is detectable on the plasma membranes of a variety of cells. Results\nfrom genetic analyses suggest that the presence of all three transmembrane domains is\nnecessary for M plasma membrane localization. Although SARS-CoV M self-assembly involves\nboth amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions along the M sequence, amino-terminal 50 residues\ncontaining the first transmembrane domain are sufficient for conferring M self-association,\nmembrane affinity, and Golgi retention. These findings for SARS-CoV M plasma membrane\nlocalization and secretion in medium indicate an undefined trafficking pathway in\ncoronavirus assembly and budding.\n\nMammalian expression vectors encoding SARS-CoV M and N were provided by G. J. Nabel\n(28). A pair of upstream and downstream\nprimers was used to amplify M-coding fragments via PCR-based overlap extension\nmutagenesis (36). Two primers were used to\nintroduce a FLAG epitope tag to the M carboxyl terminus, with the SARS-CoV M\nexpression vector serving as a template: the\n5\u2032-GTCTGAGCAGTACTCGTTGCTG-3\u2032 forward primer (referred to as the N\nprimer) and the\n5\u2032-ATCGGATCCTCACTTGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCTGCACCAGCAGGGCGATGTT-3\u2032 reverse\nprimer (containing a flanking BamHI restriction site and FLAG tag-coding nucleotides).\nPurified PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRV and ligated into the SARS-CoV M\nexpression vector. When constructing a series of M-DsRed fusion expression vectors,\nthe N primer served as the forward primer, using the M sequence as a template. Primers\nused to make the designated constructs were M-DsRed,\n5\u2032-GCGGATCCTGCACCAGCAGGGCGATG-3\u2032; M50-DsRed,\n5\u2032-CGGGATCCAGCTTGATGATGTACAG-3\u2032; M75-DsRed,\n5\u2032-CGGGATCCACCCAGTTGATCCTGTACAC-3\u2032; and M100-DsRed,\n5\u2032-CGGGATCCCTGAAGCTGGCCACGAAGTA-3\u2032. For M101-DsRed and M160-DsRed\ncloning, the forward primers were\n5\u2032-CTCTGTCGACCATGCTGTTCGCCAGGACCAGG-3\u2032 and\n5\u2032-CTCTGTCGACCATGATCAAGGACCTGCCCAAGGAG-3\u2032 and the reverse primer\n5\u2032-GCGGATCCTGCACCAGCAGGGCGATG-3\u2032. Amplicons containing SARS-CoV M\ncoding sequences were digested with BamHI and SalI and fused to the amino terminus of\npDsRed-Monomer-N1 (Clontech). To construct M-EGFP we used the N primer (forward) and\n5\u2032-GCGGATCCCCTGCACCAGCAGGGCGATG-3\u2032 (reverse). Amplified fragments were\ndigested and ligated into pEGFP-N2 (Clontech).\n\nBoth pDsRed-Monomer-Golgi and pECFP-Golgi (Clontech) encode a fluorescent marker\ncapable of labeling the trans-medial region of the Golgi apparatus. To construct\n\u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) fusions, we replaced the\nfluorescent DsRed sequence in each of the M-DsRed fusion constructs\nwith a \u03b2-gal coding sequence derived from an HIV-Gag-\u03b2-gal fusion\nexpression vector (37), yielding\nM-\u03b2gal, M13-\u03b2gal, M50-\u03b2gal, M75-\u03b2gal,\nM100-\u03b2gal, M101-\u03b2gal, and M160-\u03b2gal. Mutations were confirmed\nby restriction enzyme digestion or DNA sequencing. GST-N (formerly named as GST-CoN)\nhas the SARS-CoV N coding sequence fused to the carboxyl terminus of GST (38). HIVgpt, a replication-defective HIV-1\nexpression vector, has been described elsewhere (39).\n\n293T, HeLa, or Vero-E6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium\nsupplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Amersham Biosciences). Confluent cells were\ntrypsinized and split 1:10 onto 10-cm dishes 24 h prior to transfection. For each\nconstruct, cells were transfected with 20 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA using the calcium\nphosphate precipitation method; 50 \u03bcm chloroquine was added to\nenhance transfection efficiency. Unless otherwise indicated, 10 \u03bcg of each\nplasmid was used for cotransfection. Culture supernatant and cells were harvested for\nprotein analysis 2\u20133 days post-transfection. For HeLa or Vero-E6 cell\ntransfection, plasmid DNA was mixed with GenCarrier (Epoch Biolabs) at a ratio of 1\n\u03bcg to 1 \u03bcl; the transfection procedure was performed according to the\nmanufacturer's protocols.\n\nAt 48\u201372 h post-transfection, supernatant from transfected cells was\ncollected, filtered, and centrifuged through 2 ml of 20% sucrose in TSE (10\nmm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA plus 0.1\nmm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 \u00b0C for 40 min at 274,000\n\u00d7 g. Pellets were suspended in IPB (20 mm Tris-HCl\n(pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium\ndeoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% sodium azide) plus 0.1 mm\nphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS), collected in IPB plus 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and\nmicrocentrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min at 13,700 \u00d7 g to\nremove unbroken cells and debris. Supernatant and cell samples were mixed, with equal\nvolumes of 2\u00d7 sample buffer (12.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 20%\nglycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue) and 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min\nor (for the M-containing samples) incubated at 45 \u00b0C for 10 min. Samples were\nresolved by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto\nnitrocellulose membranes. Membrane-bound M, M-FLAG, or M-\u03b2gal and HA-M\nproteins were immunodetected using a SARS-CoV M rabbit antiserum (Rockland),\nanti-FLAG, anti-HA (Sigma), or anti-\u03b2-galactosidase (Promega) monoclonal\nantibody at a dilution of 1:1000. For SARS-CoV N detection, a mouse monoclonal\nantibody (38) was used at a dilution of 1:5000.\nThe secondary antibody was a sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit horseradish\nperoxidase-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen), both at 1:5000 dilution.\n\nConfluent 293T, HeLa, or Vero-E6 cells were split 1:80 onto coverslips or LabTek\nChambered Coverglass (Nunc) 24 h before transfection. Between 4 and 48 h\npost-transfection, cells were either fixed or directly observed under an inverted\nlaser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200M). For indirect\nimmunofluorescence microscopy, cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized at room\ntemperature for 10 min in PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100 following fixation at 4\n\u00b0C for 20 min with 3.7% formaldehyde. Samples were incubated with the primary\nantibody for 1 h and with the secondary antibody for 30 min. Following each\nincubation, samples were subjected to three washes (5\u201310 min each) with\nDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/calf serum. Primary antibody concentrations were\nanti-SARS-CoV M or anti-\u03b2-galactosidase at a dilution of 1:500. A goat\nanti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated antibody at a 1:100 dilution\nserved as the secondary antibody (Cappel, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Aurora, OH). After a\nfinal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/calf serum wash, the coverslips were washed\nthree times with PBS and mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS for viewing. Images were\nanalyzed, and photographs taken using the inverted laser Zeiss Axiovert 200M\nmicroscope.\n\nSupernatants from transfected 293T cells were collected, filtered, and centrifuged\nthrough 2 ml of 20% sucrose cushions as described above. Viral pellets were suspended\nin PBS buffer and laid on top of a pre-made 10\u201340% iodixanol (OptiPrep)\ngradient consisting of 1.25-ml layers of 10, 20, 30, and 40% iodixanol solution\nprepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Axis-Shield, Norway). Gradients\nwere centrifuged in an SW50.1 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 \u00b0C;\n500-\u03bcl fractions were collected from top to bottom, and densities were\nmeasured for each. Proteins in each fraction were precipitated with 10%\ntrichloroacetic acid and subjected to Western immunoblotting.\n\nAt 48 h post-transfection, 293T cells were rinsed twice, pelletted in PBS, and\nresuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA)\ncontaining 10% sucrose and complete protease inhibitor mixture. Cell suspensions were\nsubjected to sonication followed by low speed centrifugation. Post-nuclear supernatant\n(200 \u03bcl) was mixed with 1.3 ml of 85.5% sucrose in TE buffer, placed at the\nbottom of a centrifuge tube, and covered with a layer of 7 ml of 65% sucrose mixed\nwith 3 ml of 10% sucrose in TE buffer. Gradients were centrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7\ng for 16\u201318 h at 4 \u00b0C. Ten top-to-bottom fractions\nwere collected from each tube. Proteins in each fraction were precipitated with\nice-cold 10% TCA, rinsed once with acetone, and analyzed by Western immunoblot.\n\n293T cells transfected with FLAG-tagged M expression vector were collected in lysis\nbuffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1%\nTriton X-100) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)\nand microcentrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min at 13,700 \u00d7 g\n(14,000 rpm) to remove unbroken cells and debris. Aliquots of post-nuclear supernatant\nwere mixed with equal amounts of 2\u00d7 sample buffer and held for Western blot\nanalysis. Lysis buffer was added to the remaining post-nuclear supernatant samples to\nfinal volumes of 500 \u03bcl, and each sample was mixed with 20 \u03bcl of\nanti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma). GST pulldown protocols were as previously described\n(40). Briefly, 500 \u03bcl of post-nuclear\nsupernatant containing complete protease inhibitor mixture was mixed with 30\n\u03bcl of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). All reactions took place at 4\n\u00b0C overnight on a rocking mixer. Immunoprecipitate-associated resin or\nbead-bound complexes were pelleted, washed tree times with lysis buffer, two times\nwith PBS, eluted with 1\u00d7 sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-10% PAGE as\ndescribed above.\n\nVirus-containing supernatant was centrifuged through 20% sucrose cushions.\nConcentrated viral samples were placed onto carbon-coated, UV-treated 200-mesh copper\ngrids for 2 min. Sample-containing grids were rinsed for 15 s in water, dried with\nfilter paper, and stained for 1 min in filtered 1.3% uranyl acetate. Excess staining\nsolution was removed by applying filter paper to the edge of each grid. Grids were\nallowed to dry before viewing with a JOEL JEM-2000 EXII TEM. Images were collected at\n30,000\u00d7 and 60,000\u00d7.\n\nTotal cholesterol in isolated membrane flotation fractions were quantified by\nfluorometric assay using a cholesterol/cholesterol ester quantification kit\n(BioVision). Briefly, samples were diluted in cholesterol reaction buffer (50\n\u03bcl/well) and mixed with the provided reaction mixture. Fluorescence was\nmeasured with a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) following\nincubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Cholesterol concentrations based on the generated\nstandard curve were calculated according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1 S.D. Differences between experimental (mutant)\nand control (wt) groups were assessed using Student's t-tests.\nSignificance was defined as p < 0.05.\n\nTo test its assembly and release capability, SARS-CoV M, tagged or untagged with a\nFLAG epitope, was expressed alone or together with SARS-CoV N in 293T cells. Harvested\nculture supernatants were pelleted through 20% sucrose cushion and subjected to\nWestern blot analysis. Consistent with the previous results (28, 40), both M and N were\nreadily detected in the medium of cotransfected cells (Fig. 1, lane 5). Notably, substantial amounts of M and\nM-FLAG were present in the medium samples without coexpressed N (lanes\n2 and 3), suggesting that the SARS-CoV M is capable of\nrelease from cells in the absence of other viral components. However, M-FLAG was\napparently incapable of efficient association with N, seeing that N was barely\ndetectable in medium (Fig. 1, lane\n6). This may be due to the disruption of M-N interaction by FLAG tagged\ncarboxyl-terminally. This explanation is compatible with studies demonstrating M\ncarboxyl-terminal region involvement in M-N interaction in SARS-CoV (28, 41),\nmouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (14), and\ntransmissible gastroenteritis virus (26). To\ntest whether released M proteins were membrane-enveloped, we treated concentrated\nsupernatants from M-expressing cells with protease in the presence or absence of\nnonionic detergent. Our results indicate that extracellular M became undetectable\nfollowing treatment with protease and Triton X-100 (data not shown), suggesting that\nreleased M proteins were enveloped in lipid bilayers.\n\nFor further confirmation of the presence of extracellular M and/or N proteins in\npelleted particles, we prepared and studied supernatant samples using a TEM. Spherical\nparticles (\u223c100 nm diameter) were observed in both M- and M plus\nN-cotransfected supernatant samples, but not in mock-transfected samples (Fig. 2A). An iodixanol density\ngradient fractionation analysis was performed to gather additional evidence of\ndifferent densities between particles formed by M or by M plus N. As shown in Fig. 2 (B\u2013D), M-formed\nparticles had densities of \u223c1.13 g/ml, slightly lower than for VLPs formed by\nM plus N (1.14 g/ml). Similar results were observed in three independent experiments,\nsuggesting that, although M alone is sufficient for particle formation, the\nincorporation of N into M vesicles facilitates the formation of tightly packed\nVLPs.\n\nBecause M protein contains a single N-glycosylation site at the\nfourth amino acid residue Asn (35), we tested\nwhether glycosylation is required for M release. Cells were transfected with a\nglycosylation-defective M expression vector in which Asn-4 was replaced by Gln. We\nalso tried to determine whether SARS-CoV VLP assembly and release involves a\ncholesterol-enriched lipid raft-like membrane domain by treating transfectants with\nthe cholesterol-depletion chemical M\u03b2CD. Our results indicate that released\nlevels of M, either expressed alone or coexpressed with N, were not significantly\naffected by blocking glycosylation (data not shown). Surprisingly, quantities of\nreleased M increased markedly following M\u03b2CD treatment (Fig. 3A). However, virus production by HIV-1, whose\nassembly and budding is lipid raft-dependent, was noticeably reduced by M\u03b2CD\n(Fig. 3B, lane\n8), a finding that is consistent with a previous report (42). Similar results were observed across several\nindependent experiments. Increased quantities of released M as a result of cytolysis\nwere minimal (if any), because no gross cytotoxicity was observed. Furthermore, in the\nabsence of M coexpression, N was undetectable in medium following M\u03b2CD\ntreatment (data not shown), supporting the proposition that increased M release is not\na result of cytolysis. Because M particles released from M\u03b2CD-treated cells\nmay be assembled differently than M particles from control cells, we therefore\nperformed additional experiments to determine whether M released from\nM\u03b2CD-treated cells are assembled in particulate form similar to M from control\ncells. We centrifuged M-containing supernatants from M\u03b2CD-treated or untreated\ncells through a 20% sucrose cushion. Aliquots of the resuspended pellets were studied\nusing a TEM. Remaining resuspensions were centrifuged with M-FLAG particles\n(concentrated from the supernatants of M-FLAG-expressing cells and serving as a\ncontrol for sampling bias from gradient to gradient) through the same iodixanol\ngradient. Our results indicate that the majority of M from either M\u03b2CD-treated\nor untreated cells co-sedimented with M-FLAG at the same fraction (fraction\n4), with a buoyant density between 1.12 and 1.13 g/ml (Fig. 3C). Similar results were observed in repeat\nindependent experiments.\n\nOur TEM observations indicate that M particles released from M\u03b2CD-treated\ncells retain membrane integrity and exhibit spherical morphology that is barely\ndistinguishable from the M particles released from untreated cells (data not shown).\nThis is in agreement with previous reports indicating that M\u03b2CD treatment does\nnot significantly affect virion morphology (43,\n44). However, we cannot rule out the\npossibility that a failure to detect membrane-damaged M particles may be due to\nparticle instability. It is likely that the fragility of M particles (lacking other\nviral components such as genomic RNA or the viral structural proteins S, E, and N) may\nhave caused them to break up following their release from M\u03b2CD-treated cells,\nmaking membrane-defective M particles (if any) barely detectable in pellets. Overall,\nour results suggest that M recovered from M\u03b2CD-treated cells are assembled in\nthe same manner as M from control cells and that lipid rafts are not required for M\nself-assembly and release. Further studies are required to determine the underlying\nmolecular basis of the M\u03b2CD enhancement effect on M release.\n\nBased on previous studies suggesting that M protein in coronaviruses also possesses\nan RNA-binding property (45, 46), we looked at whether the presence of RNA is\nrequired for SARS-CoV M-M and/or M-N interaction. M or N was coexpressed with M-FLAG\nor GST-N, the latter with GST tagged at the N amino terminus. M or N association with\nM-FLAG or GST-N was assessed by coimmunoprecipitation or a GST pulldown assay in the\npresence or absence of RNase. We previously reported that (a) N is\ncapable of undergoing self-association, and (b) its association with\nhuman APOBEC3G (hA3G) is RNA-dependent (38,\n40). GST-N association with hA3G served as a\ncontrol. We observed that equivalent amounts of M were coprecipitated with M-FLAG\n(Fig. 3D, lane\n15) under an RNase treatment condition of either significantly reduced\nlevels of co-pulled-down N (Fig.\n3D, lane 13), or the elimination or\nnear-elimination of co-pulled-down hA3G (Fig.\n3E, lane 5). The RNase treatment did not\nsignificantly impact M association with GST-N (Fig.\n3, D and E). GST by itself was not capable\nof pulling down M, N, or hA3G (data not shown). To further confirm that RNA is not\nessential for M-N interaction, we performed an additional coimmunoprecipitation\nexperiment using an M expression vector carrying an amino-terminal HA tag (HA-M). The\nresult indicates that N was still capable of associating with M when treated with\nRNase (Fig. 3F, lane\n12). In contrast, RNase treatment abrogates N association with hA3G\n(lane 11), which is consistent with the GST pulldown assay results\n(Fig. 3E). Together, these\nfindings suggest that the presence of RNA is not necessary for M-M or M-N interaction,\nbut it does stimulate efficient N-N interaction.\n\nTo map domains involved in M protein secretion, we engineered a set of\nM-\u03b2-galactosidase (MGB) fusion constructs containing full-length M\n(M-\u03b2gal) or various amino- or carboxyl-terminal M coding sequences (Fig. 4C), and tested the ability of\neach MGB construct to associate with M. We found that M-\u03b2gal is also capable\nof release into medium, although less efficiently than M (data not shown). Equilibrium\ncentrifugation analysis indicates that the majority of M-\u03b2gal was sedimented\nat fraction 6 with an iodixanol density of 1.15 g/ml, higher than\nthat of M particles in the same gradient (Fig.\n4A). M and M-\u03b2gal coexpression resulted in peaking M\nand M-\u03b2gal release at the same fraction and with a density similar to that of\nM-\u03b2gal (Fig. 4B),\nsuggesting efficient interaction between the two molecules. The higher density of\nM-\u03b2gal particles compared with M particles may be explained, at least in part,\nby their higher molecular weight. Another possible explanation is that the fused\n\u03b2-gal protein induced a global conformational change, resulting in\nM-\u03b2gal molecules packed in a more compact manner. Although this chimeric\nparticle assembly system might provide a convenient assay with which to determine\nrequired M sequence boundaries for M-M interaction, MGB signals were often barely\ndetectable following iodixanol density gradient fractionation. We therefore used a\ncoimmunoprecipitation experiment to map the domain involved in M self-association. M\nimmunoprecipitation demonstrated interaction with MGB molecules retaining the M\ntransmembrane domains (Fig. 4D,\nlanes 14 and 16\u201318). Similar results were\nobserved when the precleared lysates of individually expressed M-FLAG and MGB were\nmixed prior to immunoprecipitation (data not shown). These data suggest that efficient\nM multimerization is largely dependent on the triple transmembrane-domain region.\nSpecifically, amino-terminal 50 residues encompassing the first transmembrane domain\nwere found to be sufficient for effective M-M interaction.\n\nNext, we performed membrane flotation experiments to determine whether deleted M\nsequences exert any effect on MGB membrane binding and if any correlation exists\nbetween the multimerization defect and reduced membrane-binding capacity. According to\nour results, \u223c70% of the total cellular M or M-\u03b2gal were\nmembrane-associated (Fig. 5); M50-, M75-, and\nM100-\u03b2gal exhibited membrane-binding capacities comparable to or higher than\nthat of M-\u03b2gal. Although M100-\u03b2gal and M50-\u03b2gal are present in\nhigher percentages compared with M-\u03b2gal and M, the differences are not\nstatistically significant. In contrast, <10% of total M13- or\nM160-\u03b2gal were membrane-bound. M101-\u03b2gal was moderately defective in\nmembrane binding (i.e. <50% of total cellular\nM101-\u03b2gal was membrane-associated). To confirm the presence of lipid membrane,\nwe quantified cholesterol (a major membrane lipid component) in each isolated\nfraction. The majority of cholesterol was found in the 10\u201365% sucrose\ninterface (Fig. 5B),\ncorresponding to the peak fraction (fraction 3) of both M and\ncaveolin-1, a known raft-associated membrane protein (47). These results suggest that the amino-terminal 50 residues bearing the\nfirst transmembrane domain are sufficient for conferring efficient membrane binding\nand indicate a strong correlation between MGB multimerization efficiency and membrane\nbinding capacity. Additionally, we observed a correlation between MGB release\nefficiency and membrane-binding capacity; in other words, MGB fusion proteins\nconsidered defective in membrane binding (M13-, M101-, and M160-\u03b2gal) are\ninefficiently released (data not shown).\n\nTo examine whether a correlation exists between M fusion protein subcellular\nlocalization and the above-described membrane flotation results, DsRed fusions\ncontaining full-length M, M13, M50, M70, M100, M101, or M160 sequences were\nconstructed, expressed in living cells, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. We first\nexamined the subcellular distribution of untagged M and found that it was primarily\nlocalized in the plasma membrane and perinuclear areas (Fig. 6A). M-DsRed or M-EGFP transfectants (fixed or\nunfixed) showed fluorescent staining patterns indistinguishable from those of M\ntransfectants (Fig. 6,\nC\u2013F and L). At 4 h post-transfection,\nM-EGFP was mostly found in the perinuclear area and colocalized with the DsRed-Golgi\nmarker (Fig. 6, G\u2013I).\nPeripheral punctate fluorescence became more pronounced 24 h post-transfection.\nSimilar results were also observed in Vero-E6 (Fig.\n6J) and 293T cells (data not shown). Combined, these data\nsuggest that SARS-CoV M is capable of targeting the plasma membrane, and that tagged\nEFGP or DsRed has little (if any) impact on M subcellular localization.\n\nWe then analyzed domains involved in M localization. Cells expressing fusions\ncontaining M transmembrane domains (M50-DsRed, M75-DsRed, and M100-DsRed) or the\ncarboxyl-terminal half of M (M101-DsRed) expressed enriched fluorescence around their\nnuclei (Fig. 6, N\u2013Q). In\ncontrast, cells expressing M13-DsRed or M160-DsRed showed diffuse intracellular\nfluorescent staining patterns (Fig. 6, M and\nR). Results from experiments involving coexpression with a Golgi\nlabeling marker (pECFP-Golgi) reveal that perinuclear M50-, M75-, M100-, and\nM101-DsRed localize primarily in the Golgi area (data not shown). These data indicate\na correlation between the M sequence involved in membrane binding and Golgi\nlocalization and suggest that amino-terminal 50 residues are sufficient for M membrane\nbinding and Golgi retention. Surprisingly, M100-DsRed transfectants expressed enriched\nfluorescence in both peripheral and perinuclear areas (Fig. 6P), a staining pattern similar but not identical to\nthat of M-DsRed. This implies that retention of the three transmembrane domains is\nessential for SARS-CoV M plasma membrane localization.\n\nAlthough the coimmunoprecipitation experiment results suggest that amino-terminal\ntransmembrane regions dictate M self-association, the possibility that the\ncarboxyl-terminal region may also be involved in M-M interaction cannot be overlooked.\nTo gain insight into M domains involved in self-association, M-EGFP was individually\ncoexpressed with M-, M13-, M50-, M75-, M100-, M101-, or M160-DsRed, and resulting\nfluorescence distributions were analyzed by confocal microscopy. We reasoned that\nM-EGFP might dominantly affect DsRed subcellular distribution patterns; although we\ncould not exclude the possibility of DsRed fusion localization signals confounding\nassay results. As expected, colocalization between M-DsRed and M-EGFP was readily\nobserved in the perinuclear and plasma membrane areas (Fig. 7, A\u2013C). Whereas M50-, M75-, and M100-DsRed\nfusions largely colocalized with M-EGFP, their subcellular distributions were not\nsignificantly affected by the coexpressed M-EGFP (Fig.\n7, G\u2013O, versus\nFig. 6, N\u2013P). Little\n(although visible) peripheral punctate spot fluorescence was observed in M50- and\nM75-DsRed cotransfectants. In contrast, M101-DsRed (localized exclusively around cell\nnuclei when expressed alone) localized with coexpressed M-EGFP to plasma membrane\nbesides the perinuclear area (Fig. 6Q\nversus\nFig. 7, P\u2013R). Although\nthe M160-DsRed transfectants expressed a diffuse intracellular fluorescence pattern,\nsignificant peripheral punctate fluorescence was only observed in cells cotransfected\nwith M-EGFP (Fig. 6R versus\nFig. 7, S\u2013U). These data\nsuggest that M-EGFP can influence the distribution pattern of M101-DsREd and\nM160-DsRed, presumably through an interaction involving the M carboxyl-terminal\nregion. These findings support the proposal that SARS-CoV M amino- and\ncarboxyl-terminal regions are both involved in M self-association.\n\nWe performed membrane flotation centrifugation experiments to corroborate the\ninvolvement of the carboxyl-terminal region in M-M interactions, with M-FLAG\ncoexpressed with either M101- or M160-\u03b2gal. Because M101- and\nM160-\u03b2gal are moderately to severely defective in membrane binding, we\nreasoned that M coexpression would increase fusion protein membrane-associated\nquantities if they are capable of associating with M. We found that M coexpression\nresulted in increased quantities of membrane-bound M101-\u03b2gal, but at a\nstatistically insignificant level. Membrane-associated M160-\u03b2gal quantities\nincreased dramatically following M coexpression, \u223c8-fold compared with\nM160-\u03b2gal expression alone (Figs.\n8versus 5). However, HA-M160 (a membrane-binding-competent M\nmutant with a deleted carboxyl-terminal sequence downstream of codon 160), failed to\nsignificantly increase membrane-associated quantities of M160-\u03b2gal. These\nfindings suggest that, even though the M carboxyl-terminal region is involved in M-M\ninteractions, such interactions are insufficiently robust to enable M101- or\nM160-\u03b2gal coprecipitation with M-FLAG.\n\nFindings from previous immunofluorescence studies show that SARS-CoV M primarily localizes\nin the perinuclear area (27, 34). Here we demonstrated that SARS-CoV M localizes in both the plasma\nmembrane and perinuclear areas of 293T, HeLa, and Vero cells. Nal et al.\ndemonstrated that SARS-CoV M-EGFP vesicles traffic out of Golgi compartments in living\nBHK-21 cells, with no plasma membrane labeling detected (34). They proposed that M may retrograde when transported from Golgi to ER, and/or\nM may be efficiently endocytosed or recycled upon reaching the plasma membrane, resulting in\nfailure to visualize M plasma membrane localization. Accordingly, the SARS-CoV M plasma\nmembrane localization that we observed may be dependent on cell type.\n\nPlasma membrane labeling for M100-DsRed but not for either M50- or M75-DsRed fusions (Fig. 6) implies that SARS-CoV M may contain a plasma\nmembrane-targeting signal involving the third transmembrane domain. Cells expressing a\nglycosylation-defective M (N4Q) exhibited an immunofluorescence staining pattern\nindistinguishable from that of wt transfectants (data not shown), suggesting that\nglycosylation is not required for M plasma membrane targeting. Glycosylation is also\ndispensable for M self-association and release, as N4Q mutant quantities detected in the\nmedium were near the level displayed by wt M (data not shown). This agrees with a previous\nreport that the glycosylation of coronavirus M is not essential for MHV VLP assembly (25). Furthermore, the negative effect of the\ncholesterol-depletion agent M\u03b2CD on the release of M-associated particles was\nvirtually zero (Fig. 3A). This finding\nis compatible with reports that lipid rafts are required for virus entry but not for virus\nrelease in MHV (48) and SARS-CoV (49). Although the presence of RNA is necessary for\nefficient N-N interaction, we found that M-M or M-N interaction does not require RNA (Fig. 3). RNA-independent SARS-CoV M-N interaction is\nsimilar to MHV M-N interaction (13). Despite being\ncapable of multimerization, SARS-CoV N was barely detectable in medium pellets when M plus N\nVLPs were pretreated with 0.5% Triton X-100 (data not shown), suggesting that the formation\nof high order N multimers depends on membrane association through N-M interaction. The\ncombination of M plus N, or of M plus M-\u03b2gal, resulted in the formation of more\ndense particles compared with those formed by M alone (Figs.\n2 and 4). This suggests that SARS-CoV M is not\na major determinant of virus particle density.\n\nThe possibility that M-containing particles bud directly from plasma membrane cannot be\nexcluded given the capability of M to localize to plasma membrane. One research team has\nsuggested that the coronavirus M protein is responsible for the induction of \u03b1\ninterferon synthesis in leukocytes (50). SARS-CoV M\nhas been shown to be capable of inducing apoptosis in mammalian (51) and insect cells (52).\nAccording to a more recent study, SARS-CoV M is capable of inhibiting type I interferon\nexpression by preventing the formation of a TRAF3-TANK-TBK1/IKK (epsilon) complex (53). Because SARS-CoV M is capable of a physical\nassociation with TRAF3 (which can trigger signal transduction following binding to specific\nplasma membrane receptors (54)), SARS-CoV M\nlocalization to plasma membrane may affect TRF3-mediated signal pathways. It is unknown\nwhether SARS-CoV M released from cells or localized at plasma membrane is biologically\nrelevant to the immune reaction or pathogenesis associated with SARS-CoV (55, 56).\n\nAs shown in Fig. 5, SARS-CoV M amino-terminal 50\nresidues bearing the first transmembrane domain (M50-) are sufficient for conferring the\nability of fused \u03b2-gal to efficiently associate with cell membrane and release. In\naddition, an effective association was noted between M50-\u03b2gal and M-FLAG (Fig. 4D), and intracellular M50-DsRed\nprimarily colocalized with a Golgi marker (data not shown). These data suggest that the\nsecond and third transmembrane domains are dispensable for SARS-CoV M Golgi retention,\nmembrane binding, and self-association. In the case of infectious bronchitis virus, the\nfirst transmembrane domain is both necessary and sufficient for M localization in the Golgi\nregion (8, 57\u201359). However, all three transmembrane domains are required for MHV M localization\nto the Golgi compartment (60, 61).\n\nOur observation that M101- and M160-DsRed (both lacking the three transmembrane domains)\ncolocalize with M-EGFP on plasma membrane (Fig. 7,\nP\u2013U), combined with evidence indicating that full-length rather\nthan truncated M (HA-M160) coexpression triggers a significant increase in membrane-bound\nM160-\u03b2gal quantities (Figs. 8\nversus 5), strongly suggest the involvement of the SARS-CoV M\ncarboxyl-terminal region in M-M interaction. This finding differs from those in previous MHV\nM-M interaction studies demonstrating that the removal of all three transmembrane domains\neliminates M-M interaction ability (62).\nSurprisingly, neither M50- nor M75-DsRed effectively colocalized with M-EGFP on plasma\nmembrane (Fig. 7), despite carrying the efficient M-M\ninteraction domain (Fig. 4D). One\npossible explanation is that the Golgi retention signal contained within M amino-terminal 50\ncodons becomes the dominant trafficking determinant once the third transmembrane domain is\nremoved. However, both M101- and M160-\u03b2gal are incapable of coprecipitation with M\n(Fig. 4D), implying a membrane\nassociation requirement for efficient M-M interaction.\n\nIn summary, our data suggest that SARS-CoV M contains a plasma membrane localization signal\ninvolving the third transmembrane domain. Glycosylation is not required for M plasma\nmembrane localization, self-assembly, and release. Although the presence of RNA is necessary\nfor N-N interaction, the same is not true for M-M or M-N interaction. Although M\nself-association and Golgi localization may involve multiple M sequence regions,\namino-terminal 50 codons bearing the first transmembrane domain are apparently sufficient\nfor Golgi retention, efficient membrane binding, and SARS-CoV M protein multimerization."}
