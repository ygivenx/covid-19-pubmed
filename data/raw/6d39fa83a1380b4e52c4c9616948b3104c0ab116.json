{"title": "CD46 is a potent co-stimulatory receptor for expansion of human IFN-\u03b3- producing CD8 + T cells", "body": "T-cell activation and differentiation are controlled by a combination of graded T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and co-stimulation, which together induce the gene expression involved in differentiation and effector functions. A model for the dynamical regulation between the TCR signal, the induced transcription factors, and the CD8 + T-cell function, suggests that inducible T-cell kinases are a rheostat for the gene expression [1] .\n\nHowever, an important contributing factor for the induced gene expression is the signals delivered by contributing co-stimulatory receptors. Apart from CD28 and CD2, the majority of known co-stimulatory receptors for CD8 + T-cell proliferation are within the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (HVEM, CD27, 4-1BB, CD134, DR3, GITR, CD30), although also CD244 (2B4) and CD226 has been reported to co-stimulate CD8 + T cell growth. For those co-stimulatory receptors that are expressed and have been examined on both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells, similar functional consequences have been reported (reviewed in [2] ).\n\nIn humans, CD46 is a co-stimulatory molecule for CD4 + T cells. Originally identified as a complement receptor [3] , CD46 was later discovered to have important roles within the adaptive immune system. CD46 co-stimulation of CD4 + cells appears crucial to IFN-\u03b3 production and induction of T-helper cells type 1 (Th1 cells) [4] [5] [6] and furthermore in conjunction with IL-2 induces a shift in cytokine secretion towards IL-10-producing Th1 cells [4, 7, 8] .\n\nA subset of effector CD8 + T cells secretes both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 and is thought to be involved in controlling tissue inflammation during infection. This subset has previously been identified in a mouse model for acute influenza virus [9] , and in the brain of coronavirus-infected mice [10] . In humans, a regulatory CD8 + T cell subset generated in vitro from CD8 + CD28 \u2212 but not from CD8 + CD28 + T cells was able to inhibit T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity by secretion of IL-10 [11] . Using tetramer-sorted antigen-specific CD8 + T cells from controls and solid organ transplanted patients, controls had relatively few IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10-producing, double-positive cells, whereas EBV antigen-specific CD8 + T cells from solid organ transplanted patients produced equal levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 [12] . Although CD46 was reported to slightly increase proliferation of CD8 + T-cells as well as expression of surface markers involved in T-cell activation, it did not induce a significant increase in IFN-\u03b3 production [13] . Thus, whether CD46 exerts a costimulatory function in CD8 + T cells lacking CD28 remains to be fully elucidated.\n\nWe compared the ability of human CD4 + and CD8 + T cells to proliferate and to secrete IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 upon stimulation with antibodies to TCR/CD3 and CD46. Interestingly, we observed that CD46 was a potent co-stimulatory receptor for expansion of CD8 + T-cells that secreted IFN-\u03b3, but in contrast to CD4 + T cells, CD46 did not induce an IL-10 regulatory phenotype in CD8 + T cells. This demonstrates that CD46 is a co-stimulatory receptor in CD8 + T cells, and to our knowledge provides the first example of a co-stimulatory receptor with a major qualitatively different response in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells.\n\nBlood samples from 9 Caucasian donors were collected at the Blood Bank of the Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, and provided anonymously for analysis according to the guidelines from the Danish Society for Clinical Immunology and the Ethical Committee on the use of donor samples for research purposes. All donors provided informed consent as to the use of their blood samples for scientific purposes.\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from buffy coats from healthy donors (The Blood Bank, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark) using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare Bioscience). The PBMCs were cryopreserved in 90% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, respectively were isolated from PBMCs by negative selection using EasySep Human CD4 + or CD8 + T Cell Isolation Kits (Stemcell). Approximately 2.5-3 \u00d7 10 5 isolated T cells/well were stimulated in a 48-well plate pre-coated with 2 \u03bcg/ml \u03b1CD3 (OKT-3, eBioscience), 1 \u03bcg/ml \u03b1CD28 (CD28.2, eBioscience) or 1 \u03bcg/ml \u03b1CD46 (M177, Thermo Scientific) and cultured in RPMI (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES (Gibco), 2 mM glutaMAX (Gibco), 2.5 nM sodium pyruvate and 20U/ml recombinant human IL-2 (Roche).\n\nPBMCs were stained with \u03b1CD3-FITC (UCHT1, BD Bioscience), \u03b1CD4-Brilliant Violet 421 (RPA-T4, BD Bioscience), \u03b1CD8-PC5 (B9.11, Beckmann Coulter), \u03b1CD46-PE (MEM-258, Sigma-Aldrich), IgG1-PE isotype control (BD Bioscience), and LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain Kit (Life Technologies) in the volumes indicated by the manufacturers. CD46 expression was determined on respectively CD4 + CD8 \u2212 and CD4-CD8 + cell populations following gating on first live cells and then CD3 + cells. Isolated and in vitro activated CD8 + and CD4 + T cells were stained with \u03b1CD46-PE (MEM-258) and LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain Kit and the expression of CD46 was determined on the live cells. The isotype control antibody was used to visualize the background PE fluorescence signal. Data were acquired on a NovoCyte flow cytometer (ACEA Bioscience Inc.) and processed in FlowJo (Tree Star). The detailed gating strategy for all flow cytometry experiments is presented as supplemental figurers (Fig. 1S-4S ). Fluorescent data was displayed using bi-exponential visualization according to best practice [14] .\n\nSupernatants were collected from the stimulated cells and stored at \u221220\u00b0C for up to 2 weeks. The amount of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 in the supernatants was assessed by sandwich ELISA using the Human IL-10 or IFN-\u03b3 DuoSet ELISA kits (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer's instructions. Each sample was performed in duplicate and data were analyzed in VersaMax with a 4-parameter fit for the standard curve.\n\nRNA was extracted from the cells using the Nucleo Spin RNA Kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to manufacturer's instructions. 12 \u03bcl RNA was converted into cDNA using the QuantiTect RT kit (Qiagen) and the final cDNA was diluted 1:10 in RNase-free water. The relative expression of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA was assessed by real-time PCR using Brilliant II SYBRgreen (Agilent Technology) and normalized to the housekeeping gene PPIB. For the real-time PCR was used 300 nM of the following primers: PPIB: fw 5'-TGTGGTGTTTGGCAAAGT-3', rev 5'-TGGAATGTGAGGGGAGTG-3', IFN-\u03b3: fw 5'-GAATTGGAAAGAGGAGA GTG-3', rev 5'-TGTATTGCTTTGCGTTGG-3', and IL-10: fw 5'-GTCTGA GATGATCCAGTTT-3', rev 5'-CCTTTCTCTTGGAGCTTATT-3'.\n\nThe relative units for the gene of interest were calculated using the 2 -\u0394Ct method.\n\nFor analysis of proliferation the cells were incubated with 5 nM CFSE (Invitrogen) for 5 min prior to stimulation. The cells were harvested and stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain Kit enabling gating on live cells possible, and analyzed with flow cytometry.\n\nThe frequency of IL-10-and IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells after stimulation with plate-bound antibodies was analyzed with the IL-10 (PE) and IFN\u03b3 (APC) Secretion Assay Detection Kit (MACS miltenyi) according to manufacturer's instructions. To exclude dead cells from analysis, the cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain Kit and the cells were analyzed with flow cytometry.\n\nThe data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test or with p < 0.05 considered as significant.\n\n3.1. CD46 co-stimulation induces cytokine secretion in CD8 + T cells CD46 is expressed on the surface of all nucleated human cells [15, 16] . Using flow cytometry analysis of isolated PBMCs from healthy blood donors, we determined a similar expression level of CD46 on the surface of CD8 + and CD4 + T cells with moderate interpersonal variance (Fig. 1A) . Activation of CD46 on CD4 + T cells has previously been demonstrated to cause a rapid down-modulation of CD46 from the cell surface [8, 17] . We therefore examined whether stimulation of isolated CD8 + T cells in vitro with \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD46 resulted in a similar downmodulation of CD46 from the cell surface. This demonstrated that 2 h of activation caused a rapid down-modulation of CD46 from the surface of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1B) .\n\nTo investigate whether CD46 co-stimulation further supported differentiation into effector CD8 + T cells, we analyzed the cytokine production in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells respectively, following in vitro activation using plate-bound \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD28 or \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD46. Upon activation both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells secreted IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10, which accumulated in the supernatant as measured by ELISA. As expected, we were able to confirm a significant increase in the level of IL-10 in supernatants from CD46-co-stimulated CD4 + T cells ( Fig. 2A) . Although CD46 co-stimulation also induced the secretion of IL-10 in CD8 + T cells, the average level in the supernatant was less than 3% of that seen for CD4 + T cells (Fig. 2B) . This is in accordance with an observation by Kemper et al. that CD46 was unable to induce IL-10 production in several distinct immune cell subsets, including CD8 + T cells [7] . In contrast, CD46 co-stimulation induced higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 in CD8 + T cells when compared with CD4 + T cells. These data suggest that costimulation of CD46 together with CD3 increases the amount of secreted IFN-\u03b3 from both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell cultures, whereas it induces IL-10 secretion mainly from CD4 + T cells. The CD46-induced IFN-\u03b3 production in CD8 + T cells was dependent on IL-2, since no or little IFN-\u03b3 levels could be detected in the absence of exogenous IL-2 (Fig. 2C ). This suggests a cross talk between CD46 and IL-2R signaling, as has also been suggested for CD4 + T cells [4] .\n\nNext, we addressed whether CD46 co-stimulation resulted in increased transcription from the IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 genes. CD46 co-stimulation induced similar or less IFN-\u03b3 mRNA in CD8 + T cells measured by real-time PCR (Fig. 2D) indicating that the increased secretion of IFN-\u03b3 was not caused by increased production of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA. Furthermore, CD46 co-stimulation had no detectable effect on the transcription of IL-10 mRNA in CD8 + T cells as opposed to CD4 + T cells (Fig. 2D) .\n\nThe serine-threonine kinase SPAK, which interacts with CD46 to mediate IL-10 induction, is ubiquitously present. Nevertheless, it has been reported that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are unable to switch into IL-10 production following CD46 stimulation presumably due to expression of an alternative isoform of CD46 [4] . CD46 is alternatively spliced and expressed in predominantly four isoforms. Notably, these isoforms express one of two possible intracytoplasmic tails, known as CYT-1 and CYT-2, which are thought to transmit different signals within the CD4 + T cell. CYT-1 isoforms may promote CD4 + T-cell activation, whereas CYT-2 isoforms may be involved in the contraction of the response [4, 6, 8] . We have previously characterized CD46 isoform expression on subsets of immune cells including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and demonstrated interindividual differences, but intraindividual similarities [18] . Thus, based on their total CD46 expression (Fig. 1A) and isoform expression pattern, it is not predicted that CD46 co-stimulation should differ between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Thus, the lack of a CD46-promoted IL-10 switch in CD8 + T cells is unlikely to be caused by expression of an alternative CD46 isoform but may be caused by other inherent differences in the induction of the IL-10 promoter between the two subsets of T cells.\n\nCD46 co-stimulation has previously been demonstrated to induce proliferation of CD4 + T cells [7, 19] , however its ability to induce proliferation in CD8 + T cells is less clear. One study reported a modest increase in thymidine uptake of CD8 + T cells [13] , which was not specified as being statistically significant. We therefore investigated whether CFSE labeled CD8 + T cells proliferated to co-stimulation by CD46 using flow cytometry. In accordance with previous observations, CD4 + T cells proliferated upon CD46 co-stimulation. Importantly, we found that CD46 co-stimulation of CD8 + T cells induced a similar proliferation of CD8 + T cells (Fig. 3A and B) . This further suggests that CD46 indeed may function as a co-stimulatory molecule for CD8 + T cells.\n\nTo establish whether the CD46-induced IFN-\u03b3 in the supernatants from CD8 + T cells primarily originated from induction of IFN-\u03b3 secretion or from expansion of cells producing IFN-\u03b3, the frequencies of IFN\u03b3and IL-10-producing cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a cytokine secretion assay (Fig. 4A and B) . Activation of CD8 + T cells increased the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells, and the frequency was further elevated upon CD46 co-stimulation. Whereas CD46 co-stimulation of CD4 + T cells in the presence of IL-2 induced a shift to IFN- \u03b3 + IL-10 + double positive cells and IL-10 + single positive cells over 3 days of culture, CD8 + T cells increased the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 + cells but did not show a shift towards production of IL-10 even in the presence of exogenous IL-2. This suggests a different function of CD46 costimulation in CD8 + and CD4 + T cells, respectively, where CD46 costimulation of CD8 + T cells promotes expansion and consequently a strong IFN-\u03b3 response. In contrast, CD46 co-stimulation of CD4 + T cells promotes an IFN-\u03b3 response and a subsequent shift towards a strong IL-10 response that may act as an intrinsic self-regulating mechanism.\n\nOur findings that CD46 co-stimulation promotes proliferation and strongly induce IFN-\u03b3 production of CD8 + T cells is contrary to previous results demonstrating no induction in IFN-\u03b3 secretion in CD8 + T cells upon CD46 co-stimulation, despite a modest increase in thymidine uptake and upregulation of surface markers associated with T-cell activation [13] . This discrepancy may arise from different experimental conditions including differences in the concentration of antibodies used 0 Fig. 2 . CD46 co-stimulation induces cytokine secretion from CD8 + T cells. (A) ELISA measurements of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 in supernatants from CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell cultures. Human CD8 + and CD4 + T cells were isolated and stimulated with either \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD28 or \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD46 for different time-periods as indicated. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD of 8 or 9 donors. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. All ELISA experiments were performed in technical duplicates. (B) Comparisons on a similar scale of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 in supernatants from CD8 + and CD4 + T cells induced by \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD46 co-activation (data from panel (B)). (C) Dependency of IL-2 for release of IFN-\u03b3 from CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell cultures. Human CD8 + and CD4 + T cells were isolated and stimulated with either \u03b1CD3 or \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD46 for 72 h in presence or absence of 20U/ml IL-2. Data represents mean + SD of three independent experiments. (D) The relative transcription level of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 mRNA assessed by real-time PCR using SYBRgreen and normalized to the housekeeping gene PPIB. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD of 4 donors. Real-time PCR was performed in technical triplicates.\n\nfor in vitro activation of T cells and the use of distinct CD46 antibody clones. Whereas Kickler et al. used the antibody clone MCI20.6, which binds to an epitope in SCR1, we used M177, which binds to and epitope in SCR2. Blocking studies on adenovirus binding to CD46 demonstrated that M177 and some SCR1 binding antibodies block viral binding very efficiently, but MCI20.6 had relatively poor blocking abilities [20] . It is plausible that M177 and MCI20.6 have different binding affinities for CD46 and thus may induce signaling from CD46 with different potency.\n\nT cells producing IFN-\u03b3 are highly efficient in clearing infections but also have the potential to cause severe immune pathology and therefore needs to be tightly controlled. In CD4 + T cells, CD46 co-stimulation resulted in a switch from dominance of IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells at early time-points of activation to dominance of IL-10 secreting cells at later time-points of activation indicating an intrinsic regulation of the CD4 + T cell effector response, which is in accordance with previous observations from Cardone et al. [4] and Ni Choileain et al. [8] .\n\nExpansion of IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8 + T cells may have a positive feedback mechanism, since IFN-\u03b3 is important for generating CD8 + T cell memory at least in mice [21, 22] . In addition, IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice have impaired contraction of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells [23, 24] . Thus, CD46 may in CD8 + T cells serve to induce an efficient antigenspecific T-cell response and favor generation of memory cells. The quite substantial induction of IFN-\u03b3 in CD8 + T cells by CD46 may also serve as a later negative feedback regulation of the immune response given the significance of this cytokine for the contraction phase of the antigen-specific response.\n\nAn increased frequency of virus-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 + T cells compared to CD4 + T cells have previously been observed in mice infected with various viruses [25, 26] . This might result from a greater proliferative capacity of CD8 + T cells, different susceptibility to apoptosis or different regulatory mechanism mediated by CTLA-4 [27] . However, we speculate that it might also result from differences in intrinsic regulatory mechanisms such as a lack of the switch into an inhibitory IL-10 production following the initial effector cytokine production phase.\n\nIn this study, we have demonstrated that CD46 exerts separate functions in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, since it promotes the differentiation of an IL-10-producing regulatory subset in Th1 cells, whereas it predominantly expands the IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8 + T cells. The apparent lack of differentiation of the CD8 + T cells may have important applications. For adoptive transfer of cellular immunotherapy, it is desirable to uncouple T-cell expansion from its differentiation [28] . We suggest that anti-CD46 should be further explored as a means to expand CD8 + T cells for such therapy. 3 . CD46 co-stimulation promotes proliferation of CD8 + T cells.
