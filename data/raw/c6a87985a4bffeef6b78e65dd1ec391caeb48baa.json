{"title": "Selective Recognition of a DNA G-Quadruplex by an Engineered Antibody \u2020", "body": "226,000 are unique in sequence (7) . This has raised the challenge of elucidating whether Gquadruplexes are associated with biological function. There are now a number of hypotheses linking G-quadruplex motifs with function that include the association between telomeric Gquadruplexes and telomere maintenance (8) , and the association between G-quadruplexes in the promoters of protein coding genes and transcription (9) . There are also numerous natural G-quadruplex-binding proteins that have been identified (10) (11) (12) , further suggesting a biological function of G-quadruplexes.\n\nIt has been a major goal to address the selective molecular recognition of intramolecular DNA G-quadruplexes. While the G-tetrads of G-quadruplexes are the core structural feature, the loops and grooves may provide the molecular basis for selective recognition. Gquadruplex-binding small molecules that interact primarily via the external G-tetrads have been designed (13) , of which some have shown good discrimination between G-quadruplex and duplex DNA (14) (15) (16) . Recently, there have been some examples of small molecules that show some discrimination (up to 10-fold) between G-quadruplexes (17) (18) (19) (20) . Another strategy has been to select or engineer proteins that recognize particular G-quadruplexes. Indeed, zinc finger proteins have been engineered that recognize intramolecular Gquadruplex structures with very high selectivity as compared to duplex DNA (21, 22) . Antibodies have been generated that recognize the Stylonychia intermolecular Gquadruplex, of which one was found to strongly discriminate a parallel G-quadruplex from an antiparallel G-quadruplex (23) .\n\nHerein we report on a single-chain variable fragment (scFv 1 ) antibody selected by phage display and competitive selection that binds to a human parallel intramolecular DNA Gquadruplex with high affinity. The antibody strongly discriminates between two parallel intramolecular G-quadruplexes, each found in the promoter of the c-kit protooncogene.\n\nThe DNA oligonucleotide samples d(biotin-[AG 3 \n\nPhage produced from the Tomlinson J library were used to pan against the biotinylated c-kit2 G-quadruplex coated onto a streptavidin immunotube. The panning protocol used was essentially as described in the MRC protocol (http://www.geneservice.co.uk/products/ proteomic/datasheets/tomlinsonIJ.pdf), but Tris-HCl containing 100 mM KCl instead of PBS was used to maintain the G-quadruplex conformation. Briefly, the streptavidin immunotubes were coated with 2 mL of biotinylated G-quadruplex DNA solution overnight, followed by blocking and a washing step. 10 13 phages were applied to bind, unbound phages were washed away, and the bound phages were eluted using trypsin. E. coli TG1 were infected with the eluted phage for amplification. Where competitor DNA was used, the phages were allowed to equilibrate with the competitor DNA for 1 h at room temperature before being allowed to bind to the c-kit2 G-quadruplex on the immunotube. Details of each pan are given in Table 1 . Immunotubes were coated with two concentrations of c-kit2 Gquadruplex in the final pan, 20 nM (test 1) and 500 nM (test 2).\n\nExpression of soluble scFvs and ELISA were conducted as mentioned in the MRC protocol (http://www.geneservice.co.uk/products/proteomic/datasheets/tomlinsonIJ.pdf). Briefly, individual colonies of HB2151 infected with the eluted phage were grown in 96 well microtiter plates till OD 600 nm was approximately 0.9 and then were induced with IPTG. Soluble scFvs were expressed at 30 \u00b0C overnight and transferred onto another microtiter plate coated with the target DNA G-quadruplex to carry out single well ELISA. The standard ELISA protocol was followed, but 50 mM Tris-HCl containing 100 mM KCl instead of PBS was used to maintain the G-quadruplex conformation. Protein A-HRP was used to detect the scFvs bound to the G-quadruplex. Approximately 400 colonies (~200 from test 1 and ~200 from test 2) from the final pan eluate were screened by single well ELISA for c-kit2 G-quadruplex binding. The wells that produced the highest signal intensity in the single well ELISA were selected for further analysis. This included a total of 8 clones from tests 1 and 2.\n\nPhagemid DNA Sequencing pIT2 phagemid vectors containing the insert for scFv were sequenced using LMB3 (5\u2032-CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG AC-3\u2032) sequencing primer.\n\nSurface plasmon resonance measurements were performed on a BIAcore 3000 biosensor system (Biacore Inc.) using a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (SA). Biotinylated c-kit1, biotinylated c-kit2, and biotinylated duplex DNA were annealed in running buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM KCl, and immobilized (450 RU) in flow cells. DNA binding experiments were carried out by using the same running buffer but containing calf thymus DNA (15 \u03bcg/ml), at a flow rate of 20 \u03bcL min \u22121 by using the KINJECT command for 4 min followed by a dissociation phase of 3 min. The sensor chip was regenerated by injecting a 1 M KCl solution for 1 min followed by running buffer for 1 min. Dissociation constants were determined with the global fitting method by using the binding model with mass transfer (Biaevaluation 3.0.2).\n\nCircular dichroism spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. The wavelength was varied from 220 to 320 nm at a rate of 50 nm/min. Measurements were made at 20 \u00b0C using a quartz cell with a path length of 1 cm. Each spectrum reported is an average of 5 scans. The samples were prepared to a final oligonucleotide concentration of 1 \u03bcM in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 100 mM KCl. For each experiment, a CD spectrum of the buffer was recorded and subtracted from the spectrum obtained for the DNA-containing solution.\n\nWe previously identified two intramolecular G-quadruplex-forming sequences in the promoter of the proto-oncogene c-kit (c-kit1 and c-kit2) ( Figure 1A ) (24, 25) . The c-kit gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that has importance in cell signaling and the control of cell proliferation. Elevated levels of c-kit expression have been reported in most gastrointestinal cancers (26) , hence making it a prime anticancer target. The G-quadruplexforming sequences c-kit1 and c-kit2 are located between \u221289 and \u2212160 bp upstream of the transcription start site, and the two sequences are separated by 29 bp. The G-quadruplex structure formed by c-kit1 has been solved by high resolution 1 H NMR spectroscopy and shown to form a parallel G-quadruplex of unusual structure in which a G that appears to be in a loop region is in fact part of a G-tetrad (Figure 1 ) (27) . 1 H NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopic studies on c-kit2 have suggested that the majority of the population folds into a parallel conformation ( Figure 2 ) (24) . We set out to explore whether the folded parallel topologies of c-kit1 and c-kit2 could be differentially recognized by an antibody.\n\nThe antibody was selected using phage display (28) of the Tomlinson J library (29) that comprises ~1.4 \u00d7 10 8 human scFv variants. The antibody library has been constructed (29) by randomizing a total of 18 positions in the complementarity determining regions (CDR) 2 and 3 of heavy and light chains (NNK encodes all amino acids including the TAG stop codon). The randomized amino acid positions are H50, H52, H52a, H53, H55, H56, H58, H95, H96, H97, and H98 of CDR heavy chain (CDRH), and L50, L53, L91, L92, L93, L94, and L96 of CDR light chain (CDRL). Recent publications report that the library has produced scFvs that bind to a variety of targets including bovine complex I (30), Microcystin LR (31), SARS coronovirus (32), and fibrin (33) . We are not aware of any reports of its use in nucleic acid recognition. The phage-displayed antibodies were selected using immobilized c-kit2 intramolecular DNA G-quadruplex in the presence of competitor DNA in the mobile phase to impose negative selection. The competitor regime comprised varying levels of guanine-rich double strand DNA (duplex DNA), a library of random single strand DNA (ssDNA), and the folded c-kit1 intramolecular G-quadruplex (see the Materials and Methods section for details). We screened the eluate of the fourth and final pan for scFvs that bind to c-kit2 by ELISA assay. Of these, we then evaluated eight clones for discrimination between c-kit1 and c-kit2 G-quadruplexes (Table 2) .\n\nUsing an ELISA binding assay (21), hf2 was found to bind the DNA G-quadruplex formed by the c-kit2 sequence with a K d of 1.6 \u00b1 0.4 nM, whereas the K d of hf2 for G-rich 22 bp duplex DNA was 4.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM ( Figure 1B ), indicating that hf2 had approximately 3000fold lower affinity for the duplex than for c-kit2. The ELISA-based K d of hf2 for the Gquadruplex formed by the c-kit1 sequence was 486 \u00b1 80 nM. Thus, hf2 had ~300-fold weaker affinity for the c-kit1 intramolecular G-quadruplex as compared to the c-kit2 Gquadruplex ( Figure 1B) . It is the highest discrimination that has been reported between two intramolecular genomic DNA G-quadruplexes. We confirmed the interaction between hf2 and the various DNA targets by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments using the global fitting method (22) (Figure 1C ). Its k on was 6.84 \u00d7 10 6 M \u22121 s \u22121 , and k off was 0.0566 s \u22121 . Thus, the measured K d for this interaction using kinetics is 8 nM, a slightly higher value than that obtained by ELISA. We were unable to detect specific binding of hf2 to c-kit1 or duplex DNA at concentrations up to 400 nM. The SPR measurements were consistent with the high specificity of hf2 observed by ELISA.\n\nThe c-kit2 sequence is unique in the human genome, suggestive of the potential for distinct structural features that could be exploited for molecular recognition. As yet, a structure for the c-kit2 G-quadruplex has not been solved. However, on the basis of 1-D NMR and CD spectroscopic studies c-kit2 appears to form a mixture of parallel and antiparallel structures, where the parallel structure is the dominant G-quadruplex form (24) . The c-kit1 sequence is also unique in the human genome, and NMR spectroscopic studies have suggested a single folded conformation. The NMR structure of c-kit1 (27) confirms an overall parallel conformation with a distinct folding topology (34) . While the G-tetrad cores of the c-kit1 and c-kit2 G-quadruplexes share similar features, it is the topology and sequence of the loops that are likely to provide the distinguishing features of c-kit2 and of c-kit1 for differential molecular recognition by hf2.\n\nTo further understand the nature of scFv and c-kit G-quadruplex interaction, we analyzed the amino acid sequences of hf2 and seven other scFvs (hf3-hf9) that recognize c-kit2 Gquadruplex. The seven other scFvs had ELISA K d values ranging from 21 nM to 185 nM for c-kit2 and ELISA K d values ranging from 136 nM to 636 nM for c-kit1. Thus, their ability to discriminate between c-kit1 and c-kit2 ranged from 2-fold to 23-fold ( Table 2) .\n\nAlignment of the primary amino acid sequences of hf2-hf9 made it evident that certain randomized positions in both CDRH and CDRL favored particular amino acids ( Table 2) . Position L50 of CDRL2 had arginine in 7 out of 8 clones. Position L53 (CDRL2) also showed strong bias for basic residues in 5 of the clones. Amino acid conservation in the CDRL3 is less pronounced but shows an enrichment of arginine in the region between L91 and L94 and some preference for proline at position L96. Within the heavy chain (CDRH), the majority of the scFvs had arginine at position H52a of CDR2 and basic residues at positions between H96 and H98 of CDR3. Previous reports of double strand DNA binding antibodies isolated from phage display libraries or patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) autoimmune disease, when compared with normal antibody population, showed an enrichment of arginine, asparagine, and lysine amino acids in their CDRs that can participate in charge interactions or hydrogen bond with DNA phosphates or bases (35) (36) (37) . While the G-quadruplex binding antibodies we analyzed did not show a general enrichment of asparagines and lysine, they do show an enrichment of arginine in CDRs of both heavy and light chains. The CDRH3 is considered the most important hypervariable loop for antigen-antibody interactions (38) . Several other studies found clustering of arginine residues, particularly in the CDRH3 for double strand DNA-binding antibodies isolated from SLE patients or mouse models (37, 39, 40) . Similarly, most of the clones analyzed for c-kit2 G-quadruplex binding also showed clustering of arginine in the CDRH3 suggesting a similarity in the type of interaction between the residues of CDRH3 and the two types of DNA structures. It is noteworthy that the clone hf2, which discriminated best between the two G-quadruplexes, is an exception to this conservation since it completely lacks basic amino acids in its CDRH3.\n\nWe were interested to determine whether hf2 could discriminate between the c-kit2 Gquadruplex, for which it was selected, and various randomly chosen human intramolecular G-quadruplexes, which were not employed in the negative selection regime. To address this, we chose two examples of well-characterized G-quadruplexes. One was bcl2Mid (also called bcl2MidG4Pu23-G15T/G16T), a mixed-type G-quadruplex (41) , and MYC22-G14T/ G23T, a parallel G-quadruplex (42) ( Figure 1A) . The solution structures of both Gquadruplexes have been solved by high resolution NMR spectroscopy. ELISA binding studies showed that hf2 bound bcl2Mid with a K d of 21 \u00b1 2 nM and to MYC22-G14T/G23T with a K d of 26 \u00b1 3 nM, affinities approximately 15-fold weaker than the hf2-c-kit2 interaction ( Figure 1B) . Although the discrimination for bcl2Mid and MYC22-G14T/G23T over c-kit2 is not as large as that observed between c-kit1 and c-kit2, hf2 clearly maintains the strongest affinity to its intended target over randomly selected G-quadruplexes. This supports that achieving specificity for a particular intramolecular G-quadruplex by a protein is feasible. The observation also suggests that the nature of the sequences employed in the negative selection regime is important for the profile of selectivity.\n\nTo address whether hf2 affected c-kit2 structure upon binding, we carried out a circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic study. CD spectroscopy can provide valuable insights into the folding and strand orientation of G-quadruplexes. Parallel and antiparallel strand orientations give characteristic CD spectra (43) (44) (45) (46) . The CD spectrum of c-kit2 shows a predominant parallel signature with a positive CD signal at 263 nm and a negative signal at 240 nm ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2 shows the CD spectra of c-kit2 (1 \u03bcM) obtained in Tris-HCl buffer containing 100 mM KCl in the presence and absence of the hf2 antibody (1 \u03bcM) under conditions where the DNA is fully complexed by the antibody (K d of 1.6 \u00b1 0.4 nM). The data show that hf2 does not alter the form of the c-kit2 CD spectrum, which supports that the hf2-c-kit2 complex still comprises a parallel folded G-quadruplex. When the experiment was repeated, but without the presence of stabilizing KCl (47) , the inclusion of hf2 did not induce further formation of G-quadruplex as judged by the CD spectrum (Supporting Information). This suggests that hf2 recognizes and binds to a prefolded Gquadruplex and that it does not promote G-quadruplex formation.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the single chain antibody hf2 is the first reported example of a molecule that shows large discrimination (>100-fold) between 2-folded intramolecular DNA G-quadruplexes formed from human genomic sequences. While G-quadruplexes share structural features and commonly exhibit structural polymorphism, it has been suggested that the loops offer the potential for discrimination at the molecular level. We hypothesize that loop recognition forms the basis of discriminating c-kit2 from c-kit1 by hf2. This proofof-concept suggests that specificity of G-quadruplex recognition is certainly achievable. Highly specific antibodies that recognize a particular G-quadruplex sequence and structure provide a potential means to demonstrate the existence of such structures in cells. An example of this is the use of an antibody to reveal the existence of G-quadruplex DNA in the telomeres of Stylonychia (23) . We now intend to explore whether the antibodies we have described in this article are sufficiently selective to detect the presence of a quadruplex in the promoter of c-kit.
