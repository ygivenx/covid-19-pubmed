{"title": "B cell homeostasis and follicle confines are governed by fibroblastic reticular cells HHS Public Access Author manuscript", "body": "activation 1, 2 . These specialized environments are inhabited by different subsets of mesenchymal stromal cells, which are commonly viewed as serving scaffolding function for T and B lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Current dogma holds that fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) within the paracortical region coordinate T cell responses whereas follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) within the cortex support B cell responses. However, a precise understanding of how the stromal network of lymphoid organs controls adaptive immunity has been beyond our reach due to limitations in the technology for targeting each of the mesenchymal cell populations.\n\nThe T cell paracortical region of the lymph node is delineated by FRCs, the most abundant population of non-hematopoietic or stromal cells in this organ. Typified by expression of the glycoprotein podoplanin (PDPN), and molecules such as CD140\u03b1 and CD140\u03b2, FRCs construct an elaborate conduit network that allows small molecules to rapidly flow from upstream tissues deep into the parenchyma of lymph nodes [3] [4] [5] . Expression of CCL19 and CCL21 by FRCs, in addition to other adhesion molecules, facilitates chemokine receptor CCR7-dependent homing of naive T cells and provides essential guidance cues to dendritic cells that migrate from non-lymphoid tissues into the lymph node paracortex [6] [7] [8] . Additionally, interleukin 7 (IL-7) production by FRCs is thought to be essential for preservation of the peripheral T cell pool under homeostatic conditions 9 . More recently, FRCs have also been found to control the extent of proliferation of newly activated T cells through regulated release of nitric oxide [10] [11] [12] .\n\nThe two stromal cell populations commonly characterized within the lymph node cortex include FDCs and marginal reticular cells (MRCs). FDCs are characterized by localization within B cell follicles, expression of the complement receptors CR1 and CR2 (CD21 and CD35) and the follicular dendritic cell marker 1 (FDCM1), and the ability to display opsonized antigens to B cells. Expression of B cell trophic factors, namely the chemokine CXCL13 and the pro-survival factor BAFF (also known as BlyS, TALL-1, TNFSF13B, TNFSF20), is often attributed to FDCs, implicating these cells in shepherding B cells to follicles, supporting B cell survival and coordinating the germinal center reaction [13] [14] [15] [16] . Previous work employing a system to ablate FDCs provided definitive evidence that, while this stromal subset is critical for germinal center responses, it plays only a minor role in B cell homeostasis within resting lymph nodes 17 . Likewise, loss of FDCs was not mirrored by a decrease in Tnfsf13b, hereafter referred to as Baff, transcript abundance, pointing to the presence of an alternative source. These observations have led some investigators to postulate that MRCs, which reside in close juxtaposition to the subcapsular sinus (SCS) of lymph nodes 18 , serve these functions, but data supporting this hypothesis are not yet available. Thus, the cell population supporting B cell homeostasis within primary follicles has remained enigmatic.\n\nWe have developed and experimentally validated an inducible mouse model (Ccl19-Cre x Rosa26-diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) mice) for conditional ablation of FRCs in vivo. In these mice, administration of diphtheria toxin (DTxn) caused a rapid and extensive depletion of FRCs, while sparing other stromal cell populations. Our data demonstrate that FRC ablation led to marked alterations in T cell homeostasis and compartmentalization, with profound consequences in the activation, expansion and effector function of viral antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Unexpectedly, loss of FRCs also led to significantly reduced B cell viability and altered follicular organization, followed by marked impairment in humoral immunity to T-dependent and T-independent viral antigens. Mechanistically, we determined that a subset of FRCs residing within lymphoid follicles establishes a favorable niche for B lymphocytes via production of BAFF.\n\nCollectively, these results demonstrate that FRCs are required for the generation of virusspecific T cell responses within lymphoid organs. Additionally, our study broadens the current paradigm of FRCs solely supporting T cell immunity, and highlights an essential role for FRCs in directly controlling B cell homeostasis, distribution and activation.\n\nManipulation of FRCs in vivo has thus far been limited by a lack of specific genetic models targeting this population of stromal cells. A transgenic Cre mouse line that permits targeting of FRCs, in which expression of Cre recombinase is directed by the Ccl19 promoter 19 , was only recently generated. By crossing the transgenic Ccl19-Cre line to Rosa26-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) mice, we have generated Ccl19-Cre x Rosa26-EYFP reporter mice, in which EYFP expression is achieved following Cre-mediated excision of a loxP-flanked transcriptional \"stop\" sequence ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). Confocal laser scanning microscopy of lymph nodes from Ccl19-Cre x Rosa26-EYFP mice revealed expression of the transgene in the T cell zone, thereby supporting efficient excision of floxed loci in the expected location (Fig. 1a,b) . Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated EYFP expression in FRCs, identified as non-hematopoietic cells expressing the glycoprotein podoplanin (PDPN) and negative for the endothelial marker CD31 and the cell adhesion molecule MadCAM-1 (CD45 \u2212 PDPN + CD31 \u2212 MadCAM \u2212 ) ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig.  1b) . EYFP expression was not detected in other lymph node stromal cells including lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs, CD45 \u2212 PDPN + CD31 + ), blood endothelial cells (BECs, CD45 \u2212 PDPN \u2212 CD31 + ) or integrin \u03b1 7 -expressing pericytes (IAPs, CD45-PDPN \u2212 CD31 \u2212 ) (Fig. 1c) , thereby confirming specificity of the Ccl19 promoter. Despite the recent reports suggesting a close developmental relationship between FRCs and MRCs 20 (CD45 \u2212 PDPN + CD31 \u2212 MadCAM + ), MRCs did not appear to be targeted with Ccl19-directed recombinase, as demonstrated by the absence of EYFP expression in MadCAM-1 + cells lining the subcapsular sinus by flow cytometry and confocal microscopic analysis (Fig. 1c e).\n\nTo generate a mouse model that enables selective depletion of FRCs, mice harboring the gene encoding DTR downstream of a floxed transcriptional stop element in the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 locus 21 were crossed to Ccl19-Cre mice ( Supplementary Fig. 1c ). In these mice, cells with an active Ccl19 promoter (FRCs) express the simian DTR, and are selectively vulnerable to toxin-induced apoptosis when exposed to DTxn. A single injection of DTxn into these mice was sufficient to achieve rapid and extensive ablation of FRCs from lymph nodes. FRCs were lost as early as 24 h following DTxn administration (Fig. 2a-c) and deletion was specific, as we did not detect changes in cellularity of other lymph node stromal populations, including LECs, BECs and IAPs (Fig. 2d) . Consistent with FRCs being the predominant source of the chemokine CCL19 (refs. 8, 9 ) , its expression in lymph nodes was abrogated after FRC ablation, whereas expression of genes shared with other cells, such as Ccl21 (ref. 8 ), was only partially reduced (Fig. 2e,f) . As such, we were able to detect MadCAM-1 + RANK-L + cells along the lymph node subcapsular sinus of FRC-ablated mice ( Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 1d) , confirming a lack of Ccl19 promoter activity in MRCs. In line with this finding, Rank-l transcript encoded by Tnfsf11, which is shared by MRCs and FRCs 8, 18 , was only partially reduced in total lymph node mRNA preparation after FRC ablation ( Supplementary Fig. 1e) , despite complete abrogation of Ccl19 (Fig. 2e) .\n\nDespite FRCs comprising a minute cellular compartment (~0.5% of total lymph node cells) 22 , their ablation resulted in marked alterations in lymph nodes, with significant reductions in organ size, weight and cellularity (Fig. 3a,b and data not shown). However, these effects were not symptomatic of a global collapse of lymph node architecture, as FRC ablation perturbed neither the integrity nor the permeability of the conduit network (Fig. 3c) . DTxn administration was not associated with systemic toxicity, and it did not lead to weight loss or extra-nodal pathology (Supplementary Fig. 2a and data not shown). Furthermore, we did not observe accumulation of either neutrophils (CD11b + Gr1 high ) or monocytes (CD11b + Gr1 \u2212/lo ), or increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, ruling out extraneous inflammation secondary to FRC ablation ( Supplementary Fig. 2b ,c). Collectively, these data suggest that the Ccl19-Cre mouse system allows for specific ablation of FRCs in vivo.\n\nConfocal laser scanning microscopy of DTxn-treated mice confirmed disappearance of FRCs from the T cell zone parenchyma, and revealed aberrant localization of T lymphocytes within cortical regions (Fig. 4a) . Notably, we also observed a global reduction of T cell numbers in lymph nodes ( Fig. 4b) with both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells equally affected by loss of FRCs ( Supplementary Fig. 3a,b) . Moreover, expression of the T cell survival factor Il-7 was also reduced in lymph nodes from FRC-ablated mice, suggesting that diminished T cell viability may compound the reduction in T cell numbers (Fig. 4c) . To assess the impact of FRC ablation in adaptive T cell responses, Ccl19-Cre x iDTR mice were immunized with a replication-incompetent influenza A virus expressing the OT-II ovalbumin peptide, and the generation of antigen-specific T effector cells was monitored ( Supplementary Fig. 3c,d) . Loss of FRCs resulted in diminished priming of antigen-specific T cells (Fig. 4d ,e), as well as reduced activation and proliferation ( Fig. 4f-h) . Furthermore, deterioration of anti-viral T cell responses was observed in a coronavirus-based vector system 23 , in which we monitored the generation and effector function of exogenously transferred TCR transgenic CD8 + T cells specific for the viral spike protein prior to immunization 24 (Supplementary Fig. 3e) . Strikingly, generation of the virus-specific T cell response was also profoundly disrupted, with reduced numbers of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells and defective interferon-\u03b3 production in FRC-ablated mice (Fig. 4i,j) . Altogether, our data demonstrate a critical role for FRCs in T cell homeostasis, positioning and activation.\n\nUnexpectedly, we also observed a substantial reduction in lymph node B cells following DTxn administration (Fig. 5a,b) . Structural alterations in the lymph node cortex were also observed, with reduced follicle size (Fig. 5c ) and a loss of follicle boundaries (Fig. 5d) . Ultimately, this resulted in an unfurling of the B cell zone with mixing of B and T lymphocytes throughout the cortex (Fig. 5d) . Notably, no Ccl19 promoter activity or intrinsic toxicity of DTxn in B lymphocytes was detected, suggesting a physiologic relationship between B cell homeostasis and the presence of FRCs ( Supplementary Fig.  3f ,g).\n\nTo determine the functional consequences of the aberrant follicular architecture and decreased B cell numbers, we assessed the ability of FRC-ablated mice to mount a humoral response to influenza A virus. Immunization with UV-inactivated influenza virus resulted in a disorganized accumulation of B cells in the ensuing germinal center response (Fig. 5e) , as well as a significant reduction in influenza-specific IgM (T-independent 25 ) and IgG2b (Tdependent) antibody production (Fig. 5f ).\n\nThe detrimental effect of FRC ablation on B cells was not restricted to lymph nodes. In splenic white pulp, where the Ccl19 promoter is active in both FRCs and CD31 \u2212 PDPN \u2212 (DN) cells ( 19 and Supplementary Fig. 4a ), DTxn administration efficiently targeted EYFP + stroma ( Supplementary Fig. 4b ,c), with a significant decrease in FRCs and DN cells ( Supplementary Fig. 4d ,e). FRC ablation had no effect on splenic weight or cellularity ( Supplementary Fig. 4f ,g) but markedly altered white pulp architecture ( Supplementary Fig.  4h) . B cell numbers were also reduced in the spleen (Supplementary Fig. 4i ), although to a lesser extent than in lymph nodes ( Supplementary Fig. 4j) . Functionally, the effects observed in the spleen impinged on marginal zone humoral responses, with a significant decrease in IgM production upon TNP-ficoll immunization ( Supplementary Fig. 4k ). As Ccl19 promoter activity was also reported in Peyer's patches ( 19 and Supplementary Fig.  5a ), we investigated the fate of Peyer's patches following FRC ablation. Systemic DTxn administration evoked less severe effects in Peyer's patches, with milder reductions in FRC and B cell numbers ( Supplementary Fig. 5b,c) . Similarly, no major anatomical alterations were observed, with the exception of a paucity of T cell clusters in interfollicular regions ( Supplementary Fig. 5d ). Together, these observations pointed to an unanticipated regulation of B cell homeostasis by FRCs, and suggest that damage to the FRC network has deleterious consequences on the cellular circuitries that underpin humoral responses.\n\nGiven the reported role for FRCs in regulating immune cell trafficking 6, 7, 9, 26 , we hypothesized that the decrease in B cell numbers after FRC ablation could stem from impaired lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes. To test this hypothesis, congenic CFSElabeled B cells were adoptively transferred into DTxn-treated Ccl19-Cre x iDTR mice, and enumerated within lymph nodes 90 min and 24 h later by flow cytometry. Donor B cell numbers were markedly reduced in lymph nodes of FRC-ablated mice at both time points ( Supplementary Fig. 6a) . B cell homing to lymph nodes depends on CCL19 and CXCL12 (ref. 27 ), and Cxcl12 expression in FRCs has been previously documented 8 . Indeed, Cxcl12 expression was significantly reduced in FRC-ablated mice ( Supplementary Fig. 6b) , and FRCs were sufficient to evoke B cell chemotaxis in vitro ( Supplementary Fig. 6c ), suggesting that FRCs recruit B cells, possibly via CXCL12 and CCL19. Importantly, blockade of lymphocyte ingress (via treatment with a CD62L blocking antibody) was not sufficient to significantly perturb B cell numbers in the first 24 h after treatment ( Supplementary Fig. 6d ), in contrast to the rapid B cell loss observed in FRC-ablated mice ( Fig. 5a,b) . Additionally, preventing lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes with a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor antagonist, FTY720, did not completely restore B cell numbers following FRC ablation ( Supplementary Fig. 6e ). Altogether, these data suggest that while B cell entry requires an intact FRC network, impaired B cell trafficking can only account for part of the reduction in B cell numbers following FRC ablation. This consideration prompted us to investigate the possibility that FRCs may regulate additional aspects of B cell homeostasis. Consistent with this hypothesis, B cell loss in FRC-ablated mice coincided with a significant increase in propidium iodide-positive B cells (Fig. 6a,b) implicating FRCs in promoting B cell survival.\n\nMost efforts to characterize FRCs have thus far focused on their roles in supporting T cell homeostasis, migration and activation. However, a discrete population of FRCs is also found in and around follicles (B cell zone FRCs, Fig. 6c ), and we reasoned that such a locale could position FRCs to directly interact with and influence B cells. This observation, together with the decreased B cell survival observed in FRC-ablated mice, led us to hypothesize that FRCs may provide critical survival factors for naive B cells. In this context, BAFF plays a critical role in survival of mature B cells 28, 29 . The key source of BAFF in secondary lymphoid organs was previously identified as a radiation resistant cell 30 , with FDCs often considered the sole BAFF-producing stromal cell 31 . Thus, we reasoned that the phenotypes observed in FRC-ablated mice may be secondary to a reduction in FDCs. To test if FDCs were directly targeted in our system, we ascertained whether the Ccl19 promoter was active in FDCs in situ by fluorescence imaging in Ccl19-Cre x Rosa26-EYFP mice. As depicted by FDCM1 and CXCL13 staining, EYFP was absent in the majority of FDCs in steady state lymph nodes (Fig. 6d) . Less EYFP staining was detected in a small number of FDCM1 + processes (Fig. 6d) , possibly due to the tight interconnections that exist between FRCs and FDCs in follicles 4, 32 . Additionally, to assess the status of FDCs in FRC-ablated mice, we performed quantitative microscopic analysis of lymph nodes at different time points after DTxn administration. Our data demonstrated that FDCs are present 24 h after DTxn administration ( Fig. 6e and quantified in Fig. 6f ), despite profound loss of FRCs (Fig. 2c) . Furthermore, FDCs remained functionally competent at this time point, as demonstrated by their ability to correctly display exogenous immune complexes ( Supplementary Fig. 7a ). Prolonged DTxn exposure led to a progressive reduction in FDC volume, as depicted by a decrease in FDCM1 integrated intensity (Fig. 6e ,f) and decreased CD35 staining as well (data not shown). Notably, contraction of the FDC network appeared to be transient and was followed by reappearance of FDCM1 + cells 3 days after FRC ablation (Fig. 6e,f) . Furthermore, direct comparison of FRC and FDC ablation revealed that loss of FRCs rapidly abrogated Baff expression in vivo while depletion of FDCs did not (Fig. 6g ). Together these results point to a previously unrecognized regulatory role for FRCs in maintaining BAFF amounts and B cell viability. Accordingly, the large decrease in B cell numbers was only observed in FRCablated mice but not in FDC-ablated animals (Fig. 6h) . Notably, FRC ablation perturbed Baff expression without perturbing expression of the closely related factor April encoded by Tnfsf13 (Fig. 6i,j) . Moreover, impaired Baff mRNA expression in FRC-ablated mice was mirrored by a similar abrogation in BAFF protein abundance, as assessed by confocal microscopic analysis of lymph node sections (Fig. 6k) . Interestingly, concentrations of BAFF protein in serum were unperturbed in FRC-ablated mice ( Supplementary Fig. 7b ), indicating that FRC loss influences local BAFF production rather than perturbing a systemic reservoir. Furthermore, by injecting carefully titrated DTxn in the footpad, we were able to achieve anatomically restricted FRC ablation, and consequently B cell loss, only in the draining popliteal lymph nodes, without disrupting distal lymph nodes ( Supplementary Fig.  7c,d) . Thus, the functional consequences of FRC depletion on B cell homeostasis are primarily mediated by a local effect in the organ where the ablation occurs.\n\nThe data shown so far suggest that FRCs may directly promote B cell survival by serving as a non-redundant source of BAFF, in agreement with previous studies demonstrating Baff mRNA expression in highly purified FRCs 8 . Confocal microscopic in situ analysis of B cell zone FRCs revealed that these cells are indeed capable of producing BAFF protein (Fig. 7a ). In line with this finding, BAFF production was also observed by flow cytometry in a discrete fraction of freshly isolated FRCs (Fig. 7b) . Notably, BAFF was rapidly cleaved from the cell surface in a protease-dependent manner, similar to other molecules belonging to the TNF superfamily ( Supplementary Fig. 7e) . Importantly, BAFF + cells were characterized by expression of several FRC canonical genes encoding PDPN, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), CD44, Cadherin-11, CD140\u03b1 and CD140\u03b2, VCAM, and fibroblastactivation protein (FAP) (Fig. 7c) , supporting that these cells are nearly identical to FRCs. Thus, our data suggest that FRCs positioned in follicular regions contribute to B cell homeostasis by providing the pro-survival factor BAFF. To directly test the aforementioned hypothesis, we cultured B cells in the presence or absence of FRCs and measured B cell viability using propidium iodide staining by flow cytometry. Remarkably, B cells exhibited significantly enhanced viability when cultured in the presence of FRCs compared with B cells cultured alone (Fig. 7d) . The elevated number of propidium iodide-negative B220 + cells in cultures with FRCs could not be accounted for by proliferation (Supplementary Fig.  7f ). To ascertain whether the survival advantage conferred by FRCs was due to a soluble factor, B cells were cultured with stromal cells in separate compartments of a transwell chamber or with FRC-conditioned medium. In both conditions, B cells exhibited enhanced viability indicating the presence of a soluble pro-survival factor derived from FRCs (Fig.  7e ). Next we sought to determine whether the pro-survival factor contributed by FRCs was BAFF. To this end, FRC-conditioned medium was pre-incubated with a BAFF-specific blocking antibody prior to addition to B cells. Strikingly, the enhancement of B cell survival was largely abrogated following BAFF neutralization (Fig. 7f) . In sum, our data describe a subset of FRCs delineating the borders of B cell follicles in lymph nodes (B cell zone FRCs) that nurture B cells through the production of BAFF (Supplementary Fig. 8 ).\n\nThe absence of genetic tools for targeting FRCs has curbed systematic in vivo assessment of their precise function in lymphoid organs. Recent generation of Ccl19-Cre mice provided a solution to this technological limitation 19 . In particular, cell type-specific expression of DTR allowed us to test the functional outcomes of disrupting the FRC network in physiological settings. FRC ablation caused a severe reduction in T cell numbers in resting lymph nodes, and marked impairment in antigen-specific T cell responses. Unexpectedly, FRC ablation was not immediately accompanied by a collapse of the structured conduit system, suggesting that lymph node infrastructure can persist and function for longer periods following damage to stromal cells. Rather, the absence of the cellular source of the reticular network (i.e. FRCs) impinged on T cell dynamics and function. Thus, our study demonstrates that FRCs are essential for optimal T cell immunity but not short-term maintenance of the conduit system.\n\nUsing this genetic approach we made the unexpected observation that FRCs support B cell homeostasis and the generation of humoral responses. While most lymph node FRCs reside within the T cell-rich paracortex, some localize in the vicinity of follicular conduits near the subcapsular sinus 4,32 . Our identification of Ccl19-Cre + cells in B cell follicles (B cell zone FRCs) confirmed that FRCs span both the inner and outer regions of the lymph node 33 . Unexpectedly, we found that B cell zone FRCs constitute a non-redundant source of BAFF. The source of BAFF in secondary lymphoid organs was previously identified as a radioresistant cell 30 , oft attributed to FDCs. This concept was confounded however by reports that abrogation of LT\u03b2R signaling, critical for FDC development and maintenance, did not affect BAFF expression or B cell numbers [34] [35] [36] [37] . Further, a Cd21-Cre conditional ablation system provided evidence that FDCs are dispensable for BAFF expression and naive B cell survival 17 . Although it cannot be excluded that FDCs contribute to BAFF production and their ablation induces a compensatory up-regulation by other cells, these data pointed to an alternate source of BAFF in resting lymph nodes. Based on our data, we propose that B cell zone FRCs represent this source of BAFF and thereby directly support B cell homeostasis. Disrupted follicular organization in FRC-ablated mice may also contribute to decreased B cell survival, as FRCs in intact lymphoid organs would coordinate migration of naive B cells from high endothelial venules to BAFF-rich follicles. Furthermore, while FRC ablation does not appear to impede lymph transit to and within lymph nodes, it may affect the ability of migratory dendritic cells to deliver tissue-derived antigens to T and B cells, thus contributing to the diminished antibody production observed in Ccl19-Cre x iDTR mice. Collectively, our findings indicate that alterations in lymph node stromal composition can have catastrophic consequences on immunological competency, with decreased lymphocyte viability and disorganized spatial organization of T and B cell responses.\n\nHaving demonstrated a central role for FRCs in B cell homeostasis and humoral immunity, our findings highlight the pleiotropic nature of FRCs and suggest functional heterogeneity within this cellular compartment, raising the intriguing concept of distinct FRC subsets within defined lymph node regions. In this context, stromal cells are thought to arise from a primordial mesenchyme in the lymph node anlagen, which initially develops into lymphoid tissue organizer (LTo) cells 38 \n\nFDCs and continuously supply additional stromal subsets 18 . If indeed FRCs arise from MRCs in adult lymph nodes, then the Ccl19 promoter must be silenced in MRCs. Furthermore, our studies indicated that most FDCs were devoid of promoter activity, and should thus be refractory to DTxn-induced apoptosis. A few cell processes from FDCM1 + cells displayed weak positivity for EYFP. However, given the tight association between FRCs and FDCs in follicles 4,32 , it remains difficult to discern between bona fide promoter activity in these FDCs, or proximity to EYFP + FRCs in follicular regions. In this regard, we observed functionally competent FDCs early after DTxn administration, when profound loss of FRCs has already occurred, suggesting that FDCs are not directly targeted in this system. Consequently, reduction of FDCM1 staining at later time points, likely mediated by a contraction or de-differentiation of the FDC network, may arise from a yet unrecognized crosstalk between FRCs and FDCs. Our finding that contraction of the FDC network was transient and rapidly followed by a regeneration phase is of particular interest. One potential explanation is that damage to the FDC network, secondary to FRC loss, may induce MRCs to generate new FDCM1 + cells 39 .\n\nAs complexity of the cellular constituents of lymph node stroma continues to grow, our understanding of their developmental origins and functional interactions remains incompletely understood. Our results demonstrate heterogeneity within the FRC network and indicate functional specialization of T cell zone FRCs versus B cell zone FRCs. BAFF + FRCs in follicles share common signatures with canonical FRCs, suggesting that there is some relationship between them. However, they differ in their localization, and BAFFproducing cells are not found in T cell areas. As mesenchymal cells are typically highly flexible in nature depending on the surrounding environment, it is possible that BAFF production by B cell zone FRCs is maintained by microanatomic cues. Several functions associated with T cell immunity have been assigned to FRCs [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] 9, 19, 26, 40 , yet the requirement for these cells in humoral responses has not been addressed. Our finding that B and T cell homeostasis is governed by a common stromal cell expands our understanding of the stromal network and underscores its central role in immunity.\n\nStromal cells have long been recognized as key structural components of secondary lymphoid organs 41 . More recently, we have come to understand how stromal cells interact with hematopoietic cell populations and influence adaptive immunity 42, 43 . A number of pathogens have been reported to affect the stromal network in lymphoid organs of humans, non-human primates, and rodents, and such alterations can be deleterious to host defense and vaccine responsiveness 1, 44 . Here, we uncovered the existence of a mesenchymal cell population with FRC characteristics that supports follicle identity and B cell survival through localized production of BAFF. We anticipate that these findings may inform new approaches to boost natural and vaccine-induced humoral immunity and protect against potentially devastating infections.\n\nCcl19-Cre mice were previously described 19 . Rosa26-EYFP (stock number 006148), Rosa26-DTR (iDTR, stock number 007900) Cd21-Cre (stock number 006368) and OT-II (stock number 004194) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. TCR-S transgenic mice were recently described 24 . Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with institutional and National Institute of Health guidelines and used at 5-7 weeks of age. Experiments were conducted without blinding using sex and age matched mice for all in vivo experiments. For multiple time-point experiments, mice were randomly assigned to each group. Animal studies were approved by the Research Animal Care committee of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\n\nThe following antibodies were used: \u03b1CD45 (30-F11), \u03b1CD31 (390), \u03b1PDPN (8.1.1 \n\nCcl19-Cre mice were bred to Rosa26-iDTR to generate Ccl19-Cre x iDTR animals. DTR + Cre + mice that express DTR in Ccl19 + cells and DTR + Cre \u2212 control mice were injected i.p. with 8 ng/g DTxn and sacrificed at 12, 24, 48 or 72 h as indicated in figure legends. Ablation efficiency was assessed by flow cytometry at various time points with 80-90% reduction in FRCs (CD45 \u2212 PDPN + CD31 \u2212 ) commonly seen by 72 h.\n\nDTR + Cre + mice that express DTR in Ccl19 + cells and DTR + Cre \u2212 control mice were injected in the footpad with 0.5 ng/g DTxn and sacrificed 72 h later. Local ablation was assessed by comparing FRC ablation in draining (popliteal) and non-draining lymph nodes.\n\nCd21-Cre mice were bred to Rosa26-iDTR to generate Cd21-Cre x iDTR animals. For FDC ablation experiments, 6 week-old, male recipients were irradiated and adoptively transferred with bone marrow from WT C57BL/6 mice. 6 weeks after reconstitution, mice were injected i.p. with 8 ng/g DTxn and sacrificed 24 h later.\n\nInfluenza propagation and isolation was carried out as previously described 25 . 3 days after DTxn administration, mice were adoptively transferred with 5 \u00d7 10 6 CFSE-labeled, purified OT-II transgenic CD4 + T cells by tail vein. 24 h later, mice received 20 \u03bcl virus suspension (1 \u00d7 10 6 p.f.u.) S.C. into the footpad. Mice were sacrificed 24 h later and flow cytometric analysis was performed on popliteal lymph nodes. Activation and CFSE dilution were determined 60 h after T cell transfer. For the coronavirus experiments, DTxn injection was performed 72 h before adoptive T cell transfer 23 . A total of 2 \u00d7 10 6 TCR-S transgenic CD8 + T cells were transferred by intravenous injection and, 12 h after transfer, the mice were subcutaneously injected with 3 \u00d7 10 6 of non-replicating coronaviral particles in both flanks 23 . A second injection of non-replicating coronaviral particles was performed 12 h following the first one. Lymph nodes were analyzed 72 h after the first viral particle injection.\n\n2 days after DTxn administration, mice received 20 \u03bcl influenza virus suspension (1 \u00d7 10 6 p.f.u.) subcutaneously into the footpad. 14 days later, popliteal draining lymph nodes were collected, cryopreserved and imaged to determine formation of germinal centers. Additionally, serum was collected to determine the presence of influenza-specific antibodies. ELISA analysis of serum was carried out through immobilization of UV-PR8 on a high binding plate, addition of collected serum, and probing for specific binding of IgM or IgG2b (Sigma) using standard alkaline phosphatase development. For TNP-Ficoll immunization experiments, mice were injected with DTxn and, 2 days later, with TNP-ficoll i.p. (250 \u03bcg/mouse). IgM antibody titers were determined at day 8 in the blood.\n\nFor CD62L blockade, mice received one single dose of MEL-14 CD62L antibody i.p. (200 \u03bcg/mouse, BioXcell). To prevent cell egress, mice were injected with 1 mg/kg FTY720 (Fingolimod, R&D) i.p. and, 4 h later, with DTxn. Mice received an additional dose of FTY720 at 48 h and were sacrificed for analysis at 72 h.\n\nSerum was collected from mice 3 days after DTxn administration and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until processing. Soluble BAFF was measured in the serum samples at a 1:2 dilution using a modified cytometric bead array. BD CBA Functional Beads (BD Biosciences) were activated and coated with immunopure streptavidin (Thermo Scientific) per manufacturer's instructions. For array development, a commercial anti-BAFF ELISA kit (R&D systems, catalog #DY2106-05) was used in an inverted manner. Biotinylated detection antibody was incubated with 30 \u03bcl of streptavidin-conjugated bead slurry at 3 \u03bcg/ml and subsequently washed three times with PBS containing 3% FBS. Following overnight blocking, serum samples were incubated with anti-BAFF beads in Multiscreen plates (Millipore) for 2 h. Beads were then washed three times with 3% FBS in PBS. ELISA capture antibody was used to detect BAFF bound to beads at a concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml. Following 1 h incubation, beads were washed, followed by incubation with goat anti-rat Alexa 546 antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with 3% FBS in PBS followed by an additional four washes in PBS alone. Fluorescence was detected on a BD FACSAriaIIIu, and data were analyzed using FlowJo software.\n\nFor flow cytometric analysis or cell culture of lymph node stromal cells, skin-draining lymph nodes from individual mice were dissected and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in RPMI containing 0.1 mg/ml Dnase I (Invitrogen), 0.2 mg/ml Collagenase P (Roche) and 0.8 mg/ml Dispase (Roche) for 50-60 min 22 . Cells were collected in PBS containing 2% FBS and 5 mM EDTA every 15-20 min, replacing the digestion medium with new one. Digestion of spleens was performed similarly, and red blood cells were lysed with ACK buffer before analysis by flow cytometry. Peyer's patches were collected and washed in 2 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT in PBS to remove the epithelium before enzymatic digestion.\n\nSingle cell suspensions from pooled skin-draining lymph nodes were enriched for MadCAM-1 \u2212 cells using a biotinylated MadCAM-1-specific antibody and anti-biotin microbeads (Miltenyi). Cells were counted and plated at a density of 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/cm 2 in \u03b1MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% glutamine. Nonadherent cells were removed after 24 h. After 5 days, primary cultures (FRCs and LECs primarily) were harvested and MACS-purified for CD45 \u2212 CD31 \u2212 cells (FRCs).\n\nFRCs were purified from primary lymph node cultures (see above) and seeded at a concentration of 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml in complete \u03b1MEM medium. Freshly purified lymph node B cells (B220 negative selection kit, Miltenyi) were overlaid on top of the FRC layer, at a ratio of 1 FRC : 5 B cells. In some experiments, FRCs were grown on the bottom of a transwell system chamber and B cells were added to the top of the insert. Alternatively, B cells were cultured in FRC-conditioned medium (supernatant from purified FRCs collected 5 days after seeding).\n\nLymph nodes were enzymatically digested and single cell suspensions were stained in flow cytometry buffer. FRCs were identified as negative for staining with propidium iodide and CD45 \u2212 CD31 \u2212 PDPN + MadCAM \u2212 . A BAFF monoclonal antibody or isotype control (both from R&D, BAFF clone 121808) were used. For protease inhibition, cells were treated with Batimastat (25 \u03bcM in DMSO, abcam) and Decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-Chloromethylketone (25 \u03bcM in DMSO, Bachem).\n\nIsolated tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldhehyde (PFA) for 2-4 h, and placed in 30% sucrose until saturation. Tissue was embedded in OCT medium (Optimal Cutting Temperature), frozen, and cut into 10-20 \u03bcm sections. Sections were immunostained, and imaged using a Leica SP5X laser-scanning confocal microscope. All of the images with EYFP signal were counterstained with a chicken GFP-specific antibody (Life Technologies), followed by FITC-conjugated anti-chicken antibody.\n\nPE-IC uptake by FDCs was assessed by standard confocal microscopy. 18 h following FRC ablation, mice were passively immunized with 100 \u03bcg rabbit PE monoclonal antibody, followed 6 h later by S.C. footpad injection of 1 \u03bcg PE. Popliteal draining lymph nodes were fixed in 4% PFA, cryopreserved, sectioned, and imaged as described above.\n\nMice were injected i.v. with 3 \u03bcg CD35 (clone 8C12) antibody conjugated to alexa-568 6-18 h prior to lymph node harvest. Conduit staining was achieved through s.c. injection of FITC-saturated PBS solution (10 \u03bcl) into the footpad 4-6 h prior to popliteal lymph node harvest.\n\nPopliteal lymph nodes from DTxn-treated mice were isolated and fixed in 4% PFA. Lymph nodes were equilibrated in 30% sucrose and serially sectioned. 4 sections from each individual lymph node were taken at 100 \u03bcm increments through the lymph node, and stained for confocal microscopic analysis. Resulting images were analyzed using CellProfiler to identify individual B cell follicles within each section. Fluorescence data was assessed for each follicle, and then integrated such that each lymph node data point represents at least 3 combined sections.\n\nTwo-tailed, unpaired student's t-tests were performed, assuming equal sample variance, using GraphPad Prism. Differences were considered to be statistically significant when P < 0.05. For graphs, data are shown as mean +/\u2212 SD, unless otherwise indicated. Sample size was not specifically predetermined, but the number of mice used was consistent with prior experience with similar experiments.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. .
