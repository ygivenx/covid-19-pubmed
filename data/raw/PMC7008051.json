{"title": "Chest Computed Tomography Abnormalities and Their Relationship to the Clinical Manifestation of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in a Genetically Confirmed Outbreak", "body": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is well known as a virus causing lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants and immunocompromised adults (1-3). Bronchopneumonia patterns are common findings of RSV-induced LRTI (RSV-LRTI); however, RSV-LRTI often shows variable findings on chest imaging (4-11). Although some factors, such as the virulence of RSV and host immune status, might affect the chest computed tomography (CT) findings of RSV-LRTI (12, 13), the detailed mechanisms remain unknown.\n\nFrom this perspective, an RSV outbreak due to genetically identical RSV is an ideal setting for investigating the chest images of RSV-LRTI. Thus far, however, there has only been one report showing the chest images of RSV-LRTI in the outbreak setting (11). In addition, reports investigating the correlation between the clinical manifestations and abnormal findings on chest CT remain rare (14).\n\nIn 2014, a genetically identical RSV outbreak occurred in the hemato-oncology ward of the University of the Ryukyus Hospital (15), and a subset of RSV-infected patients underwent both chest X-ray and CT during the outbreak. We herein report our analysis of the radiological findings and the clinical manifestations in the outbreak.\n\nDuring the 2014 outbreak, RSV infection was diagnosed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using respiratory specimens, and genetic proximity was confirmed by a phylogenetical analysis (15). Eight RSV-infected patients underwent both chest X-ray and CT during the outbreak. The clinical information and chest X-ray findings were retrospectively reviewed from patient medical records within one week of the chest CT scan.\n\nThe medical records and radiological images of the collected cases were retrospectively reviewed, with identifying information removed. This study was reviewed and approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of University of the Ryukyus.\n\nThe patients' background characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, and findings from chest imaging are shown in Table. Seven cases (88%) received various immunosuppressive treatment, and none had airway diseases, such as bronchial asthma. Five cases (63%) had newly appearing abnormal findings on chest CT; however, no abnormal findings were detected by chest X-ray in 3 of those 5 patients (60%). Most cases had upper respiratory symptoms, including rhinitis and sore throat. However, lower respiratory symptoms, such as wheeze, sputum, and hypoxemia, were only seen in patients with newly appearing findings on chest CT. Bacterial culture for respiratory specimens was performed in six cases, and bacteria were detected in three cases; however, no patient was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia or treated with targeted antibiotics against these detected bacteria. In addition, no cases received antiviral therapy against RSV.\n\nChest CT findings for the five patients are shown in Figs. 1-5. The most common finding among these patients was bronchial wall thickenings; seen in 4 of 5 patients (80%). In terms of the findings in the parenchymal lesion, the patterns and distributions were varied and inconsistent. Two cases showed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) along the bronchi; however, the distribution differed, as one was a localized GGO and the other a multilobar GGO. One case showed ground-glass nodules with a tree-in-bud pattern. The remaining case showed diffuse GGOs with centrilobular septal thickening, also known as the \u201ccrazy-paving\u201d pattern. Three cases underwent two or more CT scans during the course of their disease, and the abnormal findings on chest CT disappeared (Fig. 1, 2, 5).\n\nChest CT showed variable findings for RSV infection, even during an outbreak setting. In most cases, chest X-ray failed to detect abnormalities. In RSV-infected hematological malignancy patients receiving anticancer chemotherapy, lower respiratory symptoms may predict the existence of CT abnormalities due to RSV-LRTI.\n\nThe authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI)."}
