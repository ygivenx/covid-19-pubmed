By press time, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a huge Hence, there is an urgent requirement for easy-to-use, more rapid and simpler 81 detection techniques for diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\nLoop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which is the most popular 83 .

In addition, the electrophoresis is a Here, a 'one-step' and 'one-tube' RT-LAMP coupled with nanoparticles-based 112 biosensor (NBS) assay (RT-LAMP-NBS) was developed for diagnosis of COVID-19 113 .

Two target sequences, including F1ab and nucleoprotein gene (np), 114 were simultaneously amplified in an isothermal reaction, and detected in a test step. 115 We will expound the basic COVID-19 RT-LAMP principle, optimize the reaction 116 parameters (e.g., amplification temperature), and demonstrate its feasibility. product also severed as the template for next amplification by LF* (forward loop 130 primer), which was modified at the 5' end with hapten (Step 5). As a result, a 131 double-labeled detectable product (LF*/LB* product) was formed, and one end of the 132 LF*/LB* product was labeled with hapten, and the other end with biotin (Step 6, 7). 133 One hapten is assigned to one primer set, which provide the possibility for multiplex 134 LAMP detection.

These results indicated that F1ab-and np-LAMP primer sets were available for 174 establish the COVID-19 RT-LAMP NBS assay for rapid and reliable detection of 175 SARS-CoV-2. The parameter of optimal temperature for COVID-19 RT-LAMP 176 technique also was tested, and reaction temperature of 63\u00b0C was used for performing 177 the COVID-19 RT-LAMP amplification (Figure S2 and S3) . The COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS was able to detect down 12 copies (each of 181 F1ab-plasmid and np-plasmid) (Figure 4) . Two target genes were detected and 182 identified in a one-tube reaction ( Figure 4A) . The COVID-19 RT-LAMP results 183 using NBS were in consistent with turbidity and VDR detection (Figure 4B and 4C) , 184 while traditional monitoring techniques (VDR and turbidity) could not facilitate 185 multiplex analysis. Furthermore, the sensitivity of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay 186 was in conformity with F1ab-and np-RT-LAMP assay (Figure 4, S4 and S5) . 187 The optimal duration time of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay at the isothermal 188 stage also was determined, and the template level at the detection limit appeared three indicating no cross-reaction with non-SARS-CoV-2 templates (Table S2) .\n\n.
