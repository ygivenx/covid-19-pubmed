{"title": "Molecular epidemiology of bovine noroviruses in South Korea", "body": "Caliciviruses are nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses with positive-sense genomes of 7.4-8.3 kb (Green et al., 2000) . Based on the genomic organization and genetic analysis (Green et al., 2000) , the family Caliciviridae is divided into at least four genera: Vesivirus, Lagovirus, Norovirus (NoV), and Sapovirus (SaV) with a new proposed genus, NB-like (Oliver et al., 2006; Smiley et al., 2002) . The NoV genome is organized into three open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the nonstructural proteins (ORF1), www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 124 (2007) [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] the major capsid protein (ORF2) and the minor capsid protein (ORF3) (Jiang et al., 1993; Lambden et al., 1993) . Based on the genetic divergence in the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and capsid genes, the NoVs have been tentatively assigned to five genogroups (G) with multiple genotypes (Zheng et al., 2006) . The strains of three genogroups, GI, GII, and GIV, are found in humans , and GIII and GV strains are found in cows and mice (Zheng et al., 2006) .\n\nEnteric caliciviruses, morphologically indistinguishable from the human NoVs, were first reported in association with calf diarrhea in the United Kingdom in 1978 and in Germany in 1980 (Almeida et al., 1978; G\u00fcnther et al., 1984; Woode and Bridger, 1978) . In recent years, genomic data has been obtained from the two viruses, Bo/Jena/80/DE and Bo/New-bury2/76/UK, and these strains were assigned into the prototype bovine NoVs (BNoVs) of genotype 1 (GIII-1) and genotype-2 (GIII-2) within GIII, respectively. Further isolates of the genotype 1 or genotype 2 BNoVs have been identified in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and United States (Liu et al., 1999; Oliver et al., 2003 Oliver et al., , 2004 Smiley et al., 2003; van der Poel et al., 2003; Wise et al., 2004) , which have confirmed the existence of the two distinct genotypes.\n\nAlthough there are reports of the widespread occurrence of divergent human NoV strains, there are only a few reports of the prevalence and genetic diversity of BNoVs from England (Oliver et al., 2003; Woode and Bridger, 1978) , Germany (Liu et al., 1999 ), The Netherlands (van der Poel et al., 2000 and the USA (Smiley et al., 2003; Wise et al., 2004) . The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and genetic diversity of BNoVs in diarrheic calves in South Korea.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2005, a total of 645 fecal specimens obtained from diarrheic calves in 629 bovine beef herds were collected in South Korea during the spring (407 samples/406 herds), summer (107 samples/98 herds), autumn (73 samples/69 herds) and winter (58 samples/56 herds). The ages of the calves tested ranged from 2 to 90 days. The fecal samples were examined for common bacterial enteric pathogens including Salmonella spp., Clostridium spp., Campylobacter spp. using specific agar media, and any suspect colonies were identified using biochemical tests. The shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli was detected using a PCR assay, as described elsewhere (Asakura et al., 1998) . For the viral assays, fecal suspensions of each sample were prepared immediately by diluting the feces 1:10 in 0.01 M phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. The suspensions were then vortexed for 30 s, centrifuged (1200 \u00c2 g for 20 min), and the supernatants were collected and stored at \u00c080 8C for further testing.\n\nThe RNA was extracted from a 200 ml starting volume of the centrifuged 10% fecal suspensions using the Trizol-LS (Gibco-BRL, Life Tech, Grand Island, USA) procedure. The total RNA recovered was suspended in 50 ml of RNase free water and stored at \u00c080 8C until needed.\n\nThe BNoV, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), groups A, B and C bovine rotaviruses (BRVA-C), bovine enteric Nebraska-like calicivirus (BEC-NBV), bovine torovirus (BToV) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) were detected using standard one-step RT-PCR with different specific primer sets (Table 1) using the RNA extracted from the fecal samples, as described previously (Cho et al., 2001; Park et al., 2006) . The mixture for RT-PCR was incubated at 42 8C for 60 min, preheated at 94 8C for 5 min, subjected to 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 8C, 1 min at the required temperature for each primer pair (Table 1) , 2 min at 72 8C and a final 7 min incubation at 72 8C. Nested PCR assays with the primer pairs specific to BNoV, BCoV, BRV A, BToV and BEC-NBV were performed in order to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR as described previously (Cho et al., 2001; Park et al., 2006) . The mixture for nested PCR was preheated at 94 8C for 5 min, subjected to 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 8C, 1 min at the required temperature for each primer pair (Table 1) , 2 min at 72 8C and a final 7 min incubation at 72 8C. As a negative control, the RNA was extracted from the normal feces of a colostrums-deprived calf that had been inoculated with 50 ml sterile PBS. The amplification products were analyzed using 1.5% or 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by irradiating the ethidium bromide stained samples with UV.\n\nThe nested PCR products for a portion of the RdRp gene (326 bp) were selected from different test reactions and sequenced to verify the reaction specificity as well as to obtain the genomic data for phylogenetic analysis. The nested PCR products were purified using a GenClean II kit (BIO 101, Inc., LaJolla, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was carried out using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI system 3700, Applied Biosystem Inc., Foster City, USA).\n\nThe nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of the partial BNoV RdRp region were compared with those of other known caliciviruses using the DNA Basic module (DNAsis MAX, Table 1 RT-PCR and nested PCR primers for the detection of the bovine norovirus (BNoV), bovine enteric Nebraska-like calicivirus (BEC-NBV), bovine groups A, B and C rotaviruses (BRVA-C), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine torovirus (BToV) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in the fecal specimens from the diarrheic calves Alameda, USA) ( Table 2 ). Phylogenetic analysis based on the nt and aa alignments were constructed using the neighbor-joining method and the unweighted-pair group method with the average linkages of Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA, Version 3.1) with a pairwise distance (Kumar et al., 2004) . A sequence similarity search was carried out for the bovine calicivirus the RdRp protein using the LALIGN Query program of the GENESTREAM network server at Institut de G\u00e9n\u00e9tque Humaine, Montpellier, FRANCE (http://www.eng.uiowa.edu/ $tscheetz/sequence-analysis/examples/LALIGN/ lalign-guess.html).\n\nEighteen (2.8%) out of 645 fecal samples (18/629 herds; 2.9%) tested positive using a 1-step RT-PCR assay, targeting a 532 bp fragment of the RdRp region of the BNoV. Nested PCR, targeting a 326 bp fragment of the RdRp region of the BNoV, detected 60 (9.3%) positive fecal samples from 60 herds (9.4%).\n\nOf the 60 BNoV-positive fecal specimens from 60 calf herds with diarrhea, 22 fecal samples (3.4%) from 22 herds (3.5%) tested positive for the BNoV alone, while the 38 fecal samples (5.9%) from the other 38 herds (5.9%) also tested positive for other enteric pathogens (Table 3) . Of the concurrent infections of the BNoV with the other enteric pathogens, BRV A was the most common [15 fecal samples (2.2%) from 15 herds (2.3%)]. Interestingly, one diarrheic fecal sample tested positive for four enteric pathogens including BNoV, BEC-NBV, BRV A and BVDV. In addition, 397 fecal specimens from 395 herds that tested negative for BNoV also tested positive for other enteric pathogens (Table 3) . No enteric pathogens were detected in 189 fecal samples from 175 herds.\n\nThe genetic diversity of the BNoVs and their genetic similarity to the other genogroup strains were (Fig. 1) . Among the 11 Korean BNoVs, 10 Korean BNoVs clustered together on a separate branch within GIII-2, whereas the Bo/MA156/KOR, which belongs to GIII-2, clustered with the Bo/Dumfries/UK strain (Fig. 1) . Among the BNoVs examined, the Korean Bo/MA88/ Fig. 1 . The phylogenetic trees of the partial nucleotide (A) and amino acid (B) sequences of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase of caliciviruses were constructed using the neighbor-joining method of Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (Kumar et al., 2004) . Table 3 gives the name and GenBank accession numbers of each virus.\n\nKOR strain had the highest nt (86.8%) and aa (99.1%) identity with the GIII-1 prototype, the Bo/Jena/DE strain, but shared 75.2-78.2% nt and 85.2-90.7% aa identity with the GIII-2 BNoVs. The remaining 11\n\nKorean BNoVs shared a higher nt (88.0-90.5%) and aa (93.5-99.1%) identity with the GIII-2 prototype, Bo/Newbery2/UK strain, than those from the GIII-1 prototype, Bo/Jena/DE strain, sharing a 73.6-79.1% nt \n\nBased on a comparison of the aa and nt sequences of the partial RdRp region, the 12 BNoV strains that was detected in diarrheic fecal samples from calves in South Korea were classified as Norovirus GIII/1 (Bo/ Jena/DE strain-like, 1 strain) and GIII/2 (Bo/New-bury2/UK strain-like, 11 strains). These results highlight the existence of the two distinct genotypes within the group and confirming the genotype 2 as the main genotype (Oliver et al., 2003; Smiley et al., 2003; van der Poel et al., 2000 van der Poel et al., , 2003 Wise et al., 2004) . The phylogenetic data for the nt and aa sequences of the partial RdRp region also support the findings (Oliver et al., 2003; Smiley et al., 2003; van der Poel et al., 2000 van der Poel et al., , 2003 Wise et al., 2004) that the Korean BNoVs were classified as Norovirus GIII with the main genotype being GIII/2. These results, along with other reports (Oliver et al., 2003; Smiley et al., 2003; van der Poel et al., 2000 van der Poel et al., , 2003 Wise et al., 2004) , suggest GIII/2 to be the dominant genotype of BNoVs.\n\nThe aa identity within the GIII/2 BNoVs ranged from 93.5% to 99.1% (88.0-90.5% nt identity), in which genetic divergence was observed not only in the Korean BNoVs but also between the Korean BNoVs and BNoVs reported in the other countries, which indicates the genetic variability in the BNoVs belonging to GIII/2. This aa identity is similar to findings reported by Oliver et al. (2003) and Wise et al. (2004) who showed that the aa identity within the GIII BNoVs in England and USA shared a 92-100% and 91.2-100% homology with the other known strain in the partial RdRp region. Like the other RNA viruses, the NoVs show broad genomic sequence diversity between the circulating strains, which is partly due to the poor template fidelity of their RNA polymerases (Zheng et al., 2006) . Therefore, it is expected that more genetic clusters will be identigied within GIII in the future when more sequence data of the BNoVs circulating in cattle becomes available.\n\nThe fecal prevalence of BNoV infections in diarrheic calves have been reported to be 8.0% in England (Oliver et al., 2003) , 31.1% in The Netherlands, and 72.0% in the Ohio, USA (Smiley et al., 2003) . Based on the nested PCR assay, the BNoVs were detected in 9.3% of the fecal samples examined in this study. This suggests that BNoV infection are endemic in diarrheic calves in South Korea in a similar manner to the prevalence of BNoV infections in England (Oliver et al., 2003) .\n\nAlthough it was reported that BNoVs induce diarrhea in experimental calves (Bridger et al., 1984) , the pathogenicity and mechanisms of BNoVs infections are largely obscure. Therefore, other bovine enteric pathogens might play a role in the clinical and pathological presentation of this disease because many other enteric viruses have been found to be associated with diarrhea in cattle and cause lesions of villous atrophy (BRVs, BCoVs, BToVs, BEC-NBV, etc.). In this study, 5.9% of the diarrheic fecal samples testing positive to the BNoVs also tested positive to other pathogens including the BEC-NBV, BRVs A, B and C, BCoV, BToV, BVDVand shiga-toxin-producing E. coli. This suggests that a number of enteric pathogens, either singly or in combination, can influence the clinical course of BNoV infections (Almeida et al., 1978; Reynolds et al., 1986; Woode and Bridger, 1978) .\n\nIn summary, this study identified the existence of two distinct genotypes of BNoVs within the GIII, and confirmed the GIII/2 BNoVs to be the principal genotype, which is analogous to the previously reported BNoV genogroup and genotypes. In addition, these BNoVs cause endemic infections in diarrheic calves in South Korea."}
