{"title": "Treatment with hyperimmune equine immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin fragments completely protects rodents from Ebola virus infection", "body": "The horses were immunized with eVLP produced from the infection of Sf9 cells with rBV-VP40-GP. The filamentous eVLP were observed under an electron microscope (Supplementary Figure 1) and confirmed to be morphologically similar to EBOV. Immunoblotting of rBV-VP40-GP infected Sf9 cell lysates demonstrated that the eVLP contained EBOV GP and VP40 (Supplementary Figure 2). Three horses were immunized intramuscularly (IM) with 7 injections of eVLP over 11 weeks and the hyperimmune sera were collected from each animal at specified timepoints (Fig. 1A) to determine the serum titers by neutralization assay against a recombinant HIV-1 virus pseudotyped with EBOV GP. A pseudotyped-virus was used for these studies to confirm the in vitro efficacy of the antisera preparations under Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) conditions, before subsequent studies in the BSL-4 laboratory. Neutralizing serum titers were detectable after the 5th immunization at week 6, and increased until the 7th immunization at week 11 (Fig. 1B). The serum neutralizing antibody titers of two horses were 1:40,960 after seven immunizations, and was 1:20,480 for the third animal. The equine antisera (purified by ammonium sulphate-based precipitation) was then digested with pepsin at a concentration of 5\u201310 U/ml for 45 to 90 min and purified to generate F(ab\u2032)2 fragments. The purity of the antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 preparations, as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by thin layer chromatography, was determined to be 95% and 83%, respectively (Fig. 2). Approximately 2000 mL of purified antisera could be obtained from each horse during each collection, with the stock concentration between 20\u201325 mg/mL. Up to 3\u20135 collections can be performed on each horse, therefore each hyperimmunized horse yields between 120 to 250 g of purified antisera.\n\nThe equine antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 products were first characterized against a laboratory generated EBOV-eGFP for their potential to neutralize EBOV. Equine antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 were found to possess levels of similar neutralizing activity, with the half effective maximal concentration (EC50) of the products to be 1.07 \u03bcg/mL and 2.12 \u03bcg/mL, respectively (Fig. 3). Moreover, the neutralization activities of both the equine antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 were complete at a concentration of 12.5 \u03bcg/mL, indicating that the two products were indistinguishable from each other in terms of neutralization at high concentrations. EBOV-specific IgG in the equine antisera preparations were also determined by ELISA. Serial 2-fold dilutions of stock antisera with a concentration of 18\u201320 mg/mL were assayed in triplicate over three independent experiments, and the titer was determined to be between 10,240 and 20,480 endpoint dilutions.\n\nThe half-life of the F(ab\u2032)2 and equine antisera were first assessed in guinea pigs, and found to be 8\u201312 hours and 3\u20134 days, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). The protective efficacy of equine antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 were assessed over three experiments in BALB/c mice. The first experiment was to compare the efficacy of antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 treatments side-by-side. Groups of 8 mice were given intraperitoneal (IP) injections of F(ab\u2032)2 at 200 \u03bcg per dose, twice daily for 3 days (b.i.d. \u00d7 3d), starting at either 1 or 2 days post-infection (dpi) with a uniformly lethal dose of MA-EBOV. For comparison, groups of 8 mice were administered an IP injection of equine IgG at 200 \u03bcg per dose (q.d. \u00d7 1d), at either 1 or 2 dpi. Control mice were given an equal volume of PBS in place of the treatment (q.d. \u00d7 1d) at 1 dpi. PBS was used instead of non-specific immunoglobulin or F(ab\u2032)2, because previous studies involving passive transfer of non-specific antisera in mice and NHPs did not result in protection1415, and thus survival due to the non-specific effects of serum proteins is considered unlikely. Control mice lost approximately 23% of its body weight over the course of the experiment and none survived, with a mean time to death (MTD) of 6.4 \u00b1 0.5 dpi. Five of eight mice given F(ab\u2032)2 starting at 1 dpi survived (p-value < 0.0001, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 18.7% and a MTD of 8.3 \u00b1 0.6 dpi; however, none of the mice given F(ab\u2032)2 starting at 2 dpi survived the challenge (p-value = 0.9777, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 19.0% and a MTD of 5.8 \u00b1 1.8 dpi (Fig. 4A,B). Five of eight mice given antisera at 1 dpi survived (p-value < 0.0001, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 14.6% and a MTD of 8.3 \u00b1 0.6 dpi (Fig. 4C). Three of eight mice given antisera at 2 dpi survived (p-value = 0.0446, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 12.3% and a MTD of 6.6 \u00b1 0.6 dpi (Fig. 4D). Comparing groups with equal treatment times, there was no statistical difference between F(ab\u2032)2 at 1 or 2 dpi (p-value 1.0000 and 0.0613, respectively). However, given that multiple administrations of F(ab\u2032)2 were required to achieve similar protection levels demonstrated by a single injection of antisera, the results suggest that equine antisera is a superior product to F(ab\u2032)2 in terms of efficacy, possibly due to a longer in vivo half-life of equine antiseras.\n\nSince F(ab\u2032)2 appear to be promising early in MA-EBOV infection, the dosage of this treatment was increased for a second experiment. Groups of 9\u201310 mice were given IP injections of F(ab\u2032)2 at 1 or 2 mg per dose, twice daily for 3 days (b.i.d. \u00d7 3d), starting at either 30 minutes or 1 dpi with MA-EBOV. Control mice were treated with PBS (q.d. \u00d7 1d) at 1 dpi. Control mice lost approximately 17.3% of its body weight over the course of the experiment and none survived, with a MTD of 6.3 \u00b1 1.0 dpi. Partial survival was observed when treatment began 30 minutes after challenge. Four of nine mice in the 1 mg group survived (p-value < 0.0001, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 6.8% and a MTD of 11.6 \u00b1 1.5 dpi, whereas four of ten mice in the 2 mg group survived (p-value < 0.0001, compared with PBS group), with an average weight loss of 6.2% and an MTD of 12.5 \u00b1 1.4 dpi (Fig. 5A,B). In contrast, all mice survived if treatment was initiated at 1 dpi, with negligible weight loss (less than 5%) observed in both the 1 and 2 mg groups (p-value < 0.0001, compared with PBS group), indicating that protection was complete. These results indicate that F(ab\u2032)2 can contribute to protection from MA-EBOV, but only within a certain timeframe after challenge.\n\nThe efficacy of equine antisera at higher doses was then investigated in a third experiment. Groups of 10 mice were given IP injections of antisera at 2 mg per dose (q.d. \u00d7 1d), at 30 minutes, 1 or 2 dpi with MA-EBOV. Control mice were treated with PBS (q.d. \u00d7 1d) at 1 dpi. Control mice lost approximately 17.3% of its body weight over the course of the experiment and none survived, with a MTD of 6.3 \u00b1 1.0 dpi. All mice treated with antisera at 30 minutes and at 1 dpi survived with negligible weight loss (p-value < 0.0001, compared with PBS group). Nine of ten mice treated with antisera at 2 dpi also survived the challenge (p-value < 0.0001, compared with PBS group), with the lone non-survivor dying at 7 dpi and the average peak weight loss determined to be 7.9% within this treatment group (Fig. 6A,B). These results again indicate that equine antisera, compared to F(ab\u2032)2 is able to offer a greater contribution to protection from MA-EBOV in the mouse model due to the need for fewer administrations to achieve a similar level of protection.\n\nGuinea pigs were then used to confirm the protective effects from antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 in a higher phylogenic species for EBOV challenge, since these animals better mimic hallmarks of human EBOV infections, such as coagulation abnormalities16. Groups of 6 animals were given a single IP injection of antisera (q.d. \u00d7 1d) starting at 1 or 2 dpi with GA-EBOV, or twice-daily IP injections of F(ab\u2032)2 for three days (b.i.d. \u00d7 3d), starting at 1 or 2 dpi. Each injection dose contained 20 mg antisera or F(ab\u2032)2. A group of five control animals were given a single injection of PBS at 1 dpi. Control guinea pigs lost approximately 17.9% of its body weight over the course of the experiment and none survived, with a MTD of 8.2 \u00b1 0.6 dpi. All guinea pigs that were given antisera at 1 or 2 dpi survived (p-values = 0.0011 for both groups, compared with PBS group), with no clinical signs of disease or significant weight loss (Fig. 7A,B). In addition, animals that were given F(ab\u2032)2 starting at 1 or 2 dpi survived GA-EBOV challenge (p-values = 0.0011 for both groups, compared with PBS group) without signs of disease or significant weight loss (Fig. 7A,B). The disparity between the efficacy of F(ab\u2032)2 between mice and guinea pigs may be attributed to a much higher dosage of F(ab\u2032)2 administered per weight: each F(ab\u2032)2 dose for guinea pigs was 100\u00d7 higher than those given to mice, but the guinea pigs used in this experiment were only 10\u201320 times bigger than the mice by weight.\n\nThe lack of BSL-4 laboratories globally, trained personnel as well as the rigors of working under high biocontainment conditions have severely hampered basic research with EBOV, leading to a dearth of vaccines and therapeutics for use in humans. These weaknesses were exposed with the 2014\u201315 EBOV crises, and highlight the value and need for basic and translational science that occurs prior to an impending threat. In an effort to save lives, several experimental candidate treatments that had been tested for efficacy in mice or NHPs, in addition to approved or nearly-approved drugs developed against unrelated pathogens, were expedited for use in humans under compassionate circumstances, with varying degrees of success17. Of these, antibody-based treatments appear to hold the most promise in the clinic and thus should be further investigated for use in humans.\n\nPassive immunotherapy against EBOV had been tried in the past. Towards the end of the 1995 EBOV outbreak in Kikwit, Za\u00efre (presently Democratic Republic of the Congo), the passive transfer of whole blood from EBOV survivors to patients resulted in the survival of seven out of eight recipients18. However, safety concerns with blood transfusions, such as the spreading of blood-borne diseases, allergic reactions and concerns of inefficacy19 mean that this approach is controversial and will likely not be used unless a better alternative was unavailable. In the 1990s, Russian investigators had prepared hyperimmunized antisera from horses vaccinated with inactivated EBOV, which were shown to be effective when administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg to baboons, with 100% survival (2 survivors out of 2) when given 2 hours before challenge, and 67% (2 survivors out of 3) when given immediately after challenge20, although baboons are known to be more resistant to EBOV infection compared to other NHP species21. The survival benefits of the equine antisera were limited to a delay in the onset of viremia clinical symptoms when tested in cynomolgus macaques immediately after challenge, at a dose of 60 mg for an animal weighing between 5\u20136 kg22. Comparing to successful passive immunotherapy studies with purified IgG from NHPs (80 mg/kg), as well as ZMapp and MIL-77 (50 mg/kg), the dosage for the cynomolgus macaque experiment was likely too low at the time. Use of equine antisera as an emergency post-exposure treatment against EBOV has been approved in Russia, and several investigators that had been accidentally exposed to the virus have been administered this treatment, although it is not clear if they had actually been infected23.\n\nThe results of this study show that both equine antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 preparations, which can be rapidly produced in large quantities at a lower cost compared to mAbs, are effective in the post-exposure treatment of MA-EBOV challenged mice and GA-EBOV infected guinea pigs. F(ab\u2032)2 was developed in this study due to past documented issues with antisera administrations, in which equine botulinum toxin and anti-snake venom antisera was shown to produce serum sickness at high doses24. However, mice that were given a single dose of antisera demonstrated more complete protection over a greater period of time compared to multiple injections of F(ab\u2032)2. This suggests that F(ab\u2032)2 has a shorter half-life compared to IgG (which has been confirmed in this study), and/or that virus neutralization plays a partial role in survival from EBOV. The observation that administering F(ab\u2032)2 at 1 dpi is more efficacious than when the same treatment was given at 30 minutes post-exposure (Fig. 5A) was also observed in past studies with therapeutic EBOV GP-specific monoclonal antibodies2526, and suggests that virus neutralization may play a bigger role in protection at a later timepoint after EBOV challenge. With regards to neutralization, past reports have shown that while elevated antisera levels in NHPs vaccinated against EBOV correlated with survival, levels of specific neutralizing antibodies did not27. It is a possible explanation as to why mAb KZ52, which was originally selected for its ability to neutralize EBOV28, failed to protect NHPs when given at a dose of 50 mg/kg starting 1 day before challenge29, and suggests that in the future, the screening of potentially efficacious antibodies against EBOV should not be based solely on the ability of the antibody to neutralize virus.\n\nFc-dependent antibody functions, which include antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and neonatal Fragment crystallizable receptor (FcR)-mediated cross-presentation, likely play a role in protection. For instance, studies in mice against Yellow Fever virus and West Nile virus infections have shown that the protective mechanisms of monoclonal antibodies are dependent on FcR3031. Furthermore, complement component C1q has been previously shown in Influenza virus and West Nile virus infections to directly enhance the neutralizing activities of antibodies3233. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, but determining their relative importance of each proposed mechanism to efficacy and survival will yield further insight into the specific mechanisms in which antibodies help protect against EBOV disease. Furthermore, the findings of this study justify the testing of equine IgG in a higher phylogenic species for EBOV, such as NHPs, and may result in the development of a safe and economical method for the production of an effective EBOV therapeutic.\n\nMice and guinea pig experiments were performed at the BSL-4 laboratory in the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, Canada. All rodent experiments have been approved by the Animal Care Committee (ACC) at the Canadian Science Center for Human and Animal Health (CSCHAH), in accordance with the guidelines outlined by the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC). Horse studies were conducted with prior approval from the Animal Welfare and Ethics committee of the Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (permit number SCXK-2012-017), according to Horse Quarantine and Immunization Protocols for Equine Serum Production.\n\nBALB/c mice and Hartley guinea pigs were purchased from a commercial supplier (Charles River). The animals were kept in sterile, autoclaved cages and provided sterilized food and water ad libitum. Animals were also provided red, plastic shelters inside the cages as an added source of stimulation. Horses were purchased from a commercial supplier (Red Hill Military horse farm) and provided food and water ad libitum.\n\nThe sequences of EBOV GP and VP40, with lengths of 2,031 and 981 bp, respectively, were derived from GenBank (Zaire ebolavirus strain Zaire 1995, complete genome; GenBank accession No. AY354458). The GP and VP40 genes were cloned into the pUC-57 vector, named pUC-GP and pUC-VP40, and then inserted into pFastBac Dual vector (Life technologies) under the polyhedrin promoter and p10 promoter respectively, resulting in plasmid pFastBac Dual-VP40-GP. The purified plasmid was transformed into DH10\u2122Bac E. coli (Life technologies) for transposition into a bacmid. A Cellfection\u00ae II Reagent (Life technologies) was used according to manufacturer instructions to generate recombinant baculoviruses co-expressing Ebola VP40 and GP (rBV-VP40-GP).\n\nTo produce eVLP, Sf9 cells were infected with rBV-VP40-GP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, and incubated at 27 \u00b0C for 4 days. Culture supernatants were harvested and centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7 g for 30 min to remove cells, and then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 30,000 \u00d7 g for 60 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellets were re-suspended in PBS and purified through a 10\u201330\u201350% discontinuous sucrose gradient at 25,000 \u00d7 g for 90 min at 4 \u00b0C. The eVLP band obtained between 30% and 50% density range was collected, washed, and re-suspended in PBS34.\n\nFor immunoblotting, eVLP and control sample (cell culture supernatant) were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Whatman, Kent, UK) and then probed with mouse anti-EBOV GP polyclonal antibody (Prokaryotic expression GP protein immunized mice) or mouse anti-EBOV VP40 monoclonal antibody (ab1918, abcam) at a dilution of 1:200 overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The sample was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:4000 (Millipore, Boston, MA, USA) for 60 min at 37 \u00b0C. The PVDF membrane was colored with a chemiluminescence solution (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA).\n\nFor electron microscopy, eVLP were applied onto a carbon-coated formvar grid, which was immediately stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid and then observed by a transmission electron microscope.\n\nHorses (n = 3) were vaccinated intramuscularly (subcutaneous multi-point injection) with either 3 or 5 mg of eVLPs emulsified in Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant/Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant at weeks 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 (7 times). Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein at 1 week prior to the first immunization and 1 week after each immunization, and the sera were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further analysis.\n\nThe equine antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 were produced at Changchun Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd., using the large-scale, Current Good Manufacturing Practice compatible equine antiserum manufacturing platform. Equine antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 preparations were characterized according to guidelines set forth by Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2010 edition), including appearance, color, visible foreign matter, pH value, F(ab\u2032)2 and immunoglobulin content, and sterility. For equine antisera, the blood was taken from the jugular vein of immunized horses, and the sera were separated 2 h later. The horse sera were diluted 8-fold with PBS, centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min, and supernatants were subjected to filtration through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter. The antisera were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation35, followed by salt column, and then stored in 0.9% NaCl solution. For F(ab\u2032)2: horse sera were diluted 3-fold and the pH was adjusted to 3.2 using 1 M HCl, and then the antisera were subjected to shock digestion at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min with pepsin, and 0.4 M NaOH was added to terminate digestion. The digestion products were subjected to salt column purification, followed by Protein A column. The flow-through fluid was harvested and subjected to ultrafiltration to remove the pepsin and small molecular proteins, and the F(ab\u2032)2 was stored in 0.9% NaCl solution.\n\nThe purified equine antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 samples were mixed with non-reducing (without \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) protein sample buffer, heated at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% gel, staining for 3 h and destaining for 2 h); and then the target fractions in the gel were examined by thin layer chromatography scanner (CS-9301, Shimadzu), (transmission, zigzag scan, dual wavelength, swing width: 8 mm, delta Y: 0.1 mm) to determine the purity of equine antisera and F(ab\u2032)2.\n\nEBOV GP expressed by E. coli BL-21 was diluted with 0.1 M bicarbonate buffer pH 9.6 to a final concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL, and coated on 96-well ELISA plates overnight at 4 oC (100 \u03bcL/well). After blocking with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) buffer (Bio-Rad, California, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h, the plates were incubated with 100 \u03bcL of serial 2-fold dilutions of stock equine antisera in triplicate at 37 \u00b0C for 1.5 h. After washing, 100 \u03bcL of HRP-conjugated goat anti-horse IgG (ComWin Biotech Co., Ltd. Beijing, China) diluted 1:20000 in PBS-0.5% Tween was added to the wells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 50 min. After washing, 100 \u03bcL of substrate 3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Sigma) was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcL of 0.5 M H2SO4, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. A dilution was considered positive if the absorbance reading was at least twice that of the negative control (PBS) at the same dilution. The IgG endpoint titer was calculated as the highest dilution still showing a positive result. The assay was performed independently three times.\n\nGroup of 4 guinea pigs were administered an IP injection of 1 mL purified equine antisera (neutralization titer 1:20480) or F(ab\u2032)2 (neutralization titer 1:20480). Blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 h post-injection, and sera were used for determination of neutralization titer against a recombinant HIV-1 virus pseudotyped with EBOV GP. The time range post-infection in which the titer decreases by 50% is considered the half-life. Each sample was performed in triplicate.\n\nBALB/c mice, 4\u20136 week old, female and weighing between 15\u201319 g, were randomly assigned into groups of 8\u201310 mice. All animals were challenged intraperitoneally (IP) with a dose of 1000 \u00d7 LD50 mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV, USAMRIID/BALB/c-lab/COD/1976/Mayinga-MA-p3) in 200 \u03bcL DMEM. The treatment was given IP (q.d. \u00d7 1d) at 1 or 2 days post-infection (dpi) with 0.2 mg equine anti-EBOV antisera per mouse, or in a subsequent experiment, given IP at 30 minutes, 1 or 2 dpi with 2 mg equine anti-EBOV antisera per mouse. The control group was given the same volume of PBS as mock treatment. All animals were monitored for signs of disease, survival and weight change for 16 days, and survival was monitored for 12 additional days. Female strain Hartley guinea pigs, 4\u20136 week old and weighing between 200 and 300 g, were randomly assigned into groups of 6 animals. All animals were challenged IP with 1000 \u00d7 LD50 guinea pig-adapted EBOV (GA-EBOV, VECTOR/C.porcellus-lab/COD/1976/Mayinga-GPA-p7) in 1 mL DMEM. The treatment was given IP (q.d. \u00d7 1d) at 1 or 2 dpi with 20 mg equine anti-EBOV IgG per animal. A control group of 5 guinea pigs were given the same volume of PBS as mock treatment. All animals were monitored for signs of disease, survival and weight change for 15 days, and survival was monitored for 13 additional days.\n\nBALB/c mice, 4\u20136 week old, female and weighing between 15\u201319 g, were randomly assigned into groups of 8\u201310 mice. All mice were challenged IP with a dose of 1000 \u00d7 LD50 MA-EBOV in 200 \u03bcL DMEM. The treatment was given IP at 1 or 2 dpi with 200 \u03bcg F(ab\u2032)2 per mouse, or in a subsequent experiment, given IP at 30 minutes, 1 or 2 dpi with either 1 mg or 2 mg of F(ab\u2032)2 per mouse. The treatment was given via IP twice a day for 3 days (b.i.d. \u00d7 3d). The control group was given the same volume of PBS as a mock treatment. All animals were monitored for signs of disease, survival and weight change for 16 days, and survival was monitored for 12 additional days. Female strain Hartley guinea pigs, 4\u20136 week old, were randomly assigned into groups of 6 animals. All animals were challenged IP with 1000 \u00d7 LD50 guinea pig-adapted EBOV in 1 mL DMEM. The treatment was given IP at 1 or 2 dpi with 20 mg F(ab\u2032)2 per animal. The treatment was given via IP twice a day for 3 days (b.i.d. \u00d7 3d). A control group of 5 guinea pigs were given the same volume of PBS as mock treatment. All animals were monitored for signs of disease, survival and weight change for 15 days, and survival was monitored for 13 additional days.\n\nTiters of equine antisera and F(ab\u2032)2 from horses was tested in an neutralization assay in Huh-7 cells against recombinant HIV-1 virus pseudotyped with EBOV GP. The method for generating pseudotyped viruses was described in a previous publication36. Briefly, pseudotyped virus containing supernatants were incubated either with serially diluted horse sera at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, before addition to pre-plated target cells in 96-well culture plates (density of 104 cells/well). Cells were re-fed fresh medium 4 h after addition, and followed by lysing cells at 48 h using cell lysis buffer (Promega) and transferring the lysates into 96-well luminometer plates. Luciferase substrate (Promega) was added to the plates, and the relative luciferase activity was determined. The inhibition of pseudotyped was presented as % inhibition. The highest serum dilution giving over 50% reduction of luciferase activity was regarded as the neutralizing antibody titer.\n\nSerial two-fold dilutions of F(ab\u2032)2 or antisera (between 12.5 to 0.097656 \u03bcg/mL) were incubated with 100 plaque forming units (PFU) of EBOV expressing eGFP (EBOV-eGFP, NML/H.sapiens-lab/COD/1976/Mayinga-eGFP-p3) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, transferred to Vero E6 cells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, and then replaced with DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. Control wells contained PBS instead of F(ab\u2032)2 or antisera, and all samples were repeated in triplicate. The plates were fixed with 10% phosphate buffered formalin at 72 h after infection, and scored for the intensity of eGFP using the BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader. The results were expressed as a percentage of the fluorescence reading with the control (which is set at 100%), and fitted to a 4-parameter logistic curve (Graphpad).\n\nThe p-values for rodent studies were determined using the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Calculated values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All in vivo studies were performed once.\n\nHow to cite this article: Zheng, X. et al.
