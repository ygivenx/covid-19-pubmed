{"title": "QUANTIFYING TREATMENT EFFECTS OF HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE AND AZITHROMYCIN FOR COVID-19: A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF AN OPEN LABEL NON-RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL A PREPRINT", "body": "Evidence-based public health programming is essential for global pandemic planning, and optimization of resources. However, unadjusted analyses may provide distorted estimates, or not full utilize scarce clinical data, especially in with consideration of intention-to-treat analyses, where all persons enrolled are analysed [3, 4] . Finally, effect size estimates allow for the magnitude of potential clinical impact to considered in policy adoption, as statistical significance may not be biologically important [5] .\n\nQuantifying Treatment Effects of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for COVID-19: a secondary analysis of an open label non-randomized clinical trial A PREPRINT\n\nAll analyses was performed using Stata 16.1 (College Station, TX, USA). Standard 95% confidence interval were used; model parsimony was assessed using Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC/BIC). All models were adjusted for age and sex. Assessing the predictive power of logistic models used Tjur's R2. [6] .\n\nData were obtained from [2] , and the Supplemental Table 1 was digitized using Tabula software, with subsequent hand-validation. Data for the six patients who were lost-to-follow-up (LTF) were manually entered into a database.\n\nThe primary outcome as reported by the authors \"The primary endpoint was virological clearance at day-6 postinclusion.\" An optimal analysis for this endpoints in a binary regression which avoids many of the potential biases in logistic models when outcomes are common [7] .\n\nThe stated \"Secondary endpoint was virological clearance overtime during the study period....\" and standard Cox survival time models and Royston-Parmar flexible parameteric models [8] were used to capture the time-to-first negative PCR (with a Ct threshold of >=35). The incorporation of the censored patients was as per standard methods.\n\nThe sequence of confirmed viremia via PCR is shown in (Fig. 1) , and the LFT patients are at the bottom of the figure. The primary outcome was assessed using binary regressions to provide relative risks for clearance of viremia between the study arms. The main effect of interest (that of all combined HCQ-treated patients versus control), shows a marginally significant risk ratio of 3.84 (95 % CI 1.02 -14.42, p= 0.047). Analysis of the separate HCQ and HCQ+AZ outcome was not possible due to quasi-separation of the model. To assess the secondary outcome, Kaplan-Meier and Cox models were use initially to compare the time-to-event with adjustment for covariates. Due severe proportional hazard violations in the HCQ-AZ group, flexible parametric models were used to estimate effects.\n\n3 .

The rapid increase in confirmed infections within the last few days suggests that the pandemic is accelerating, and there are major opportunity costs associated with all choices [11] ; and rapid science will be critical for progress [12] .\n\n4 .
