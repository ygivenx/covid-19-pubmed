{"title": "Induction of GADD34 Is Necessary for dsRNA-Dependent Interferon-\u03b2 Production and Participates in the Control of Chikungunya Virus Infection", "body": "During their replication in host cells, RNA and DNA viruses generate RNA intermediates, which elicit antiviral responses mostly through type-I interferon (IFN) production [1], [2]. Several families of proteins are known to sense double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), including endocytic Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) [3], the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) [4] and the interferon-inducible 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylates and endoribonuclease L system (OAS/2-5A/RNase L) [5]. Viral dsRNA and the synthetic dsRNA analog polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C) are also detected by different cytosolic DExD/H box RNA helicases such as the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), DDX1, DDX21, and DHX36, which, once activated, trigger indirectly the phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of transcription factors such as IRF-3 and IRF-7, resulting predominantly in abundant type-I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines production by the infected cells [1], [6], [7].\n\nAlphaviruses such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are small enveloped viruses with a message-sense RNA genome, which are known to be strong inducers of type-I IFN in vivo\n[8], [9], a key response for the host to control the infection [10], [11], [12]. In vitro, however, response to RNA viruses is heterogeneous, since Sindbis virus (SINV), do not elicit detectable IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production in infected of murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) [13]. The specific points of blockage of type-I IFN production during infection are still not well delineated, but SINV and other alphaviruses could antagonize IFN production by shut-off of host macromolecular synthesis in infected cells [14], [15], [16]. Recently, human fibroblasts infection by CHIKV was shown to trigger abundant IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA transcription, while preventing mRNA translation and secretion of these antiviral cytokines [13], [15]. Contrasting with these reports, other groups using different CHIKV strains have observed abundant type-I IFNs release in the culture supernatants of CHIKV-infected human monocytes [17], human lung cells (MRC-5), human foreskin fibroblasts and MEFs [10]. Type-I IFN stimulation of non-hematopoietic cells has also been shown to be essential to clear infection upon CHIKV inoculation in mouse, but CHIKV was found to be a poor inducer of IFN secretion by human plasmacyto\u00efd dendritic cells [10]. Thus, great disparities regarding alphavirus-triggered IFN responses exist between viral strains and the nature of host cells or animal models.\n\nOnce bound to their receptor on the cell surface (IFNAR), type-I IFNs activate the Janus tyrosine kinase pathway, which induces the expression of a wide spectrum of cellular genes including Pkr\n[18]. These different genes participate in the cellular defense against the viral infection. PKR is a serine\u2013threonine kinase that binds dsRNA in its N-terminal regulatory region and induces phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2\u03b1) on serine 51 [19], [20], leading to protein synthesis shut-off and apoptosis. PKR has been also been shown to participate in several important signaling cascades, including the p38 and JNK pathways [21], as well as type-I IFN production [22], [23]. Inhibition of translation, IFN responses and triggering of apoptosis combine to make PKR a powerful antiviral molecule, and many viruses have evolved strategies to antagonize it [24], [25]. Interestingly, several positive RNA-strand viruses (eg. Togaviridae or Picornaviridae) have been shown to activate PKR, resulting in phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and host translation arrest [26], while viral mRNA could initiate translation in an eIF2-independent manner by means of a dedicated RNA structure, that stalls the scanning 40S ribosome on the initiation codon [25].\n\nDespite the existence of these viral PKR-evading strategies, the importance of PKR for type-I IFN production has been strongly debated over the years and even considered dispensable since the discovery of the innate immunity function of the DExD/H box RNA helicases [27], [28]. However, several PKR-deficient cell types have reduced type-I IFN production in response to poly I:C [23], [29], [30], while PKR was demonstrated to be required for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production in response to a subset of RNA viruses including Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, West Nile (WNV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV), but not influenza, Newcastle disease, nor Sendai virus [31], [32], [33], [34]. These studies raise therefore the possibility that some but not all viruses induce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in a PKR-dependent and cell specific manner. Infection of PKR or RNAse L deficient mice demonstrated that these enzymes were not absolutely necessary for type I IFN-mediated protection from alphaviruses such as SFV or WNV, but still contributed to levels of serum IFN and clearance of infectious virus from the central nervous system [25], [35]. Similarly, deficient mice for both PKR and RNAse L showed no increase in morbidity following SINV infection, although, like during WNV infection, increased viral loads in draining lymph nodes were observed [35], [36]. These observations support a non-redundant and cell specific role for these enzymes in the amplification of type-I IFN responses to viral infection more than in their initiation [31], [32], [35]. Nevertheless, the exacerbated phenotypes observed upon alphavirus infection of mice deficient for type-I IFN receptor (IFNAR), underlines the limits of the individual contributions of PKR and RNAse L to the anti-viral resistance of adult animals [10], [35], [36].\n\nIn addition to dsRNA detection, different stress signals trigger eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, thus attenuating mRNA translation and activating gene expression programs known globally as the integrated stress response (ISR) [37]. To date, four kinases have been identified to mediate eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation: PKR, PERK (protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase) [38], GCN2 (general control non-derepressible-2) [39], [40] and HRI (heme-regulated inhibitor) [41], [42]. ER stress\u2013mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is carried out by PERK, which is activated by an excess of unfolded proteins accumulating in the ER lumen [38]. Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1, attenuating protein synthesis and triggering the translation of specific molecules such as the transcription factor ATF4, which is necessary to mount part of a particular ISR, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) [43], [44]. Interestingly DNA viruses, such as HSV, that use the ER as a part of its replication cycle, have been reported to interfere with the ER stress response through different mechanisms, such as the dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by the viral phosphatase 1 activator, ICP34.5 [45], [46].\n\nWe show here, using SUnSET, a non-radioactive method to monitor protein synthesis [47], that independently of any active viral replication, cytosolic poly I:C detection in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) promotes a PKR-dependent mRNA translation arrest and an ISR-like response. During the course of this response, ATF4 and its downstream target, the phosphatase-1 (PP1) cofactor, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34, also known as MyD116 and Ppp1r15a) [48], are strongly up-regulated. Importantly, although the translation of most mRNAs is strongly inhibited by poly I:C, that of IFN-\u00df and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is considerably increased under these conditions. We further demonstrate that PKR-dependent expression of GADD34 is critically required for the normal translation of IFN-\u00df and IL-6 mRNAs. We prove the relevance of these observations for antiviral responses using CHIKV as a model: we show that GADD34-deficient MEFs are unable to produce IFN-\u00df during infection and become permissive to CHIKV. We further show that CHIKV induces 100% lethality in 12-day-old GADD34-deficient mice, whereas WT controls do not succumb to infection. Our observations demonstrate that induction of GADD34 is part of the anti-viral response and imply the existence of distinct and segregated groups of mRNA, which require GADD34 for their efficient translation upon dsRNA-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation.\n\nWe monitored protein synthesis in MEFs and NIH-3T3 cells after poly I:C stimulation, using puromycin labeling followed by immunodetection with the anti-puromycin mAb 12D10 [47]. Poly I:C delivery to MEFs and NIH-3T3, rapidly and durably inhibited protein synthesis, concomitant with increased eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (P-eIF2\u03b1) (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). In MEFs, a strong eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was observed after 4 h of poly I:C treatment, followed by a steady dephosphorylation at later times (Fig. 1A). Protein synthesis arrest was confirmed in individual cells by concomitant imaging of poly I:C delivery, mRNA translation and P-eIF2\u03b1 (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B), and with a wide range of dsRNA concentrations (Fig. S1C). Poly I:C-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and subsequent translation arrest were not observed in PKR-deficient MEFs (Fig. 1C and 1D), while eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation induced by the UPR-inducing drug thapsigargin (th) (an inhibitor of SERCA ATPases) or arsenite (as) was unchanged in PKR\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 1C). PKR is therefore necessary to induce protein synthesis inhibition in response to cytosolic poly I:C.\n\nWhen levels of IFN-\u00df were quantified in culture supernatants and compared to total protein synthesis intensity, we found that most of the cytokine production occurred after 4 to 8 h of pIC delivery (Fig. 1E, WT, and S1D), a time at which mRNA translation was already considerably decreased (Fig. 1A and S1E). We measured the amount of cytokine produced in NIH-3T3 cells at a time (7 h) at which translation was already strongly inhibited (Fig. 1G and 1F). To prove that IFN-\u03b2 production truly occurred during this poly I:C-induced translation arrest, cells exposed for 7 h to poly I:C were washed and old culture supernatants replaced with fresh media for 1 h (with or without CHX), prior translation monitoring (Fig. 1F, right) and IFN-\u00df dosage (Fig. 1G, right). We observed that close to 30% of the total IFN-\u00df produced over 8 h of poly I:C stimulation is achieved during this 1 h period, despite a close to undetectable protein synthesis in the dsRNA-treated cells (Fig. 1F). The neo synthetic nature of this IFN was further demonstrated by the absence of the cytokine in CHX-treated cell supernatants. IFN-\u03b2 production in response to poly I:C is therefore likely to be specifically regulated and occurs to a large extent independently of the globally repressed translational context. As previously observed in MEFs, IFN-\u00df production in response to poly I:C was independent of PKR (Fig. 1E) [31]. This suggests that although its production occurs during cap-mediated translation inhibition, it does not directly depend on a specialized open reading frame organization, as described for the translation of the mRNAs coding for the UPR transcription factor ATF4 or the SV 26S mRNA upon eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [26], [49]. This hypothesis is also supported by the ability of MEFs expressing the non-phosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1 Ser51 to Ala mutant (eIF2\u03b1 A/A), to produce normal levels of IFN-\u00df in response to poly I:C (Fig. 1E), while global translation was not inhibited by poly I:C in these cells (Fig. S2).\n\nWe went on to investigate the molecular mechanisms promoting this paradoxical IFN-\u00df synthesis in an otherwise translationally repressed environment. Induction of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation by PERK during ER stress promotes rapid ATF4 synthesis and nuclear translocation, followed by the transcription of many downstream target genes important for the UPR [50]. Similarly, in presence of PKR, nuclear ATF4 levels were found to be up-regulated in MEFs responding to cytosolic poly I:C, albeit less importantly than upon a bona fide UPR induced by thapsigargin (Fig. 2A).\n\nOne of the key molecules involved in the control of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is the protein phosphatase 1 co-factor GADD34, which relieves translation repression during ER stress by promoting eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation [50], [51],[52]. GADD34 is a direct downstream transcription target of ATF4 [53]. Expression of GADD34 was quantified by qPCR and immunoblot in WT and PKR\u2212/\u2212 MEFs (Fig. 2B). In WT cells GADD34 mRNA expression was clearly up-regulated (20 fold) in response to poly I:C, while GADD34 protein induction was equivalent in poly I:C- and thapsigargin-treated cells. GADD34 mRNA transcription and translation were not observed in PKR\u2212/\u2212 cells responding to poly I:C, but occurred normally upon thapsigargin treatment, paragoning eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, right).\n\nWe next investigated the importance of ATF4 for GADD34 transcription by monitoring the levels of GADD34 mRNA in ATF4-deficient cells. ATF4\u2212/\u2212 MEFs displayed higher basal levels of GADD34 mRNA than WT cells. However, in absence of ATF4, MEFs were unable to efficiently induce GADD34 mRNA transcription in response to any of the stimuli tested (Fig. S3). GADD34 mRNA expression was induced only 2 fold in ATF4\u2212/\u2212 MEFs exposed to poly I:C, suggesting that its transcription is mostly dependent on ATF4 in this context. We further investigated P-eIF2\u03b1 requirement for GADD34 expression and found that eIF2\u03b1 A/A expressing MEFs were incapable of up-regulating GADD34 in response to poly I:C (Fig. 2C). Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by PKR in response to cytosolic poly I:C induces therefore a specific integrated stress response (ISR), that allows ATF4 translation, its nuclear translocation and subsequent GADD34 mRNA transcription.\n\nWe next evaluated the relevance of GADD34 induction, by treating WT and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C fibroblasts with poly I:C or with drugs known to induce ER stress, such as thapsigargin and the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin [52]. As expected, in WT cells eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was rapidly increased in response to all ISR-inducing stimuli and decreased concomitantly with the expression of GADD34 over time (Fig. 3A and S4) [52]. Consequently eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was greatly increased in GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs in all the conditions tested (Fig. 3A and S4A).\n\nIn thapsigargin-treated cells, protein synthesis was reduced in the first hour of treatment and rapidly recovered (Fig. 3B) [54]. Poly I:C, however, nearly completely inhibited translation despite active eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation. This was particularly obvious when poly I:C was co-administrated together with thapsigargin. Indeed, poly I:C dominated the response by preventing the translation recovery normally observed after few hours of drug treatment (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, in absence of functional GADD34, although eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation induction by poly I:C was augmented dramatically, no further decrease in protein synthesis was observed upon treatment of GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C cells with the dsRNA mimic (Fig. 3A and 3C). The functionality of GADD34 in translation restoration was, however, fully demonstrated, when the same cells were treated with thapsigargin, and protein synthesis was completely inhibited by this treatment [52] (Fig. 3C). Thus, cytosolic dsRNA delivery induces a type of protein synthesis inhibition, which requires eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation for its initiation, but conversely cannot be reverted by GADD34 induction and subsequent GADD34-dependent eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation.\n\nThe potential contribution of the OAS/2-5A/RNAse L system to this P-eIF2\u03b1-independent inhibitory process was evaluated by investigating RNA integrity in MEFs exposed to poly I:C. We used capillary electrophoresis to establish precise RNA integrity numbers (RIN) computed from different electrophoretic traces (pre-, 5S-, fast-, inter-, precursor-, post-region, 18S, 28S, marker) and quantify the degradation level of mRNA and rRNA potentially resulting from the activation of this well characterized anti-viral pathway. No major RNA degradation could be observed upon poly I:C delivery (Fig. S5), suggesting that global RNA degradation does not contribute extensively to the long term translation inhibition observed upon poly I:C delivery in our experimental system.\n\nWe have observed that GADD34 expression counterbalances PKR activation by promoting eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, however it has little impact on reversing the global translation inhibition initiated by poly I:C. We next monitored the production of specific proteins and cytokines in WT and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs (Fig. 4). Cystatin C, a cysteine protease inhibitor was chosen as a model protein, since its secretion ensures a relative short intracellular residency time so that its intracellular levels directly reflect its synthesis rate [55]. This is confirmed by the N-glycosylated- and total Cystatin C accumulation in cells treated with brefeldin A (Fig. 4A, left panel). Cystatin C levels were found to follow a similar trend to that observed with total translation, being strongly reduced upon poly I:C exposure and not profoundly influenced by GADD34 inactivation (Fig. 4A, right panel). Thapsigargin treatment induced a brief drop in cystatin C levels, prior to some levels of GADD34-dependent recovery. 6 hours of tunicamycin treatment affected more cystatin C accumulation than anticipated (Fig. 4A, right panel), probably due to interference with the N-glycosylation and associated folding of this di-sulfide bridge containing protein [55], thereby promoting its degradation by endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) [56].\n\nWe next turned towards PKR, which displayed a pattern of expression completely different from cystatin C (Fig. 4B). As expected from its IFN-inducible transcription, levels of PKR were increased in poly I:C-treated MEFs (Fig. 4B), despite the strong global translation inhibition observed in these cells (Fig. 3). GADD34 inactivation appeared to influence the accumulation of PKR, since the cytoplasmic dsRNA sensor levels were not up-regulated and even decreased in poly I:C-treated GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs (Fig. 4B). Control treatment with tunicamycin and thapsigargin did not alter significantly PKR levels (Fig. 4B), suggesting that ER stress did not influence the kinase expression. The absence of PKR up-regulation in the poly I:C-treated GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs led us to investigate the capacity of these cells to produce anti-viral and inflammatory cytokines, which normally drive PKR expression through an autocrine loop. We ruled out any interference from the UPR in triggering IFN-\u00df production in our experimental system, since, as anticipated from PKR expression, tunicamycin and thapsigargin treatments were not sufficient to promote cytokine production in MEFs (Fig. S6) [43], [44].\n\nWe therefore investigated IFN-\u00df and IL-6 production in response to dsRNA in WT, GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C and CReP\u2212/\u2212 MEFs. CReP\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were used as a control, since CReP (Ppp1r15b) is a non-inducible co-factor of PP1 and displays some functional redundancy with GADD34 [57]. Although basal levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation were higher in CReP\u2212/\u2212, PKR expression and translation inhibition upon poly I:C delivery were equivalent in WT and CReP\u2212/\u2212 MEFs (Fig. S7A and S7B). Quantification of IFN-\u00df and IL-6 levels in culture supernatants indicated that, although abundant and comparable amounts of these cytokines were secreted by WT and CReP\u2212/\u2212 cells, they were both absent in poly I:C-treated GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFS (Fig. 4C and S7C).\n\nQuantitative PCR analysis revealed that, IFN-\u00df, IL-6 and PKR transcripts were potently induced in poly I:C treated GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs (Fig. 4D), thus excluding any major transcriptional alterations in these cells, as confirmed by the normal levels of cystatin C mRNA, which remained constant in all conditions studied. Moreover, using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we could not detect intracellular IFN-\u03b2 in poly I:C-stimulated GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs, in contrast to WT cells, which abundantly expressed the cytokine, despite the global translation arrest (Fig. S8). Thus, we could attribute the deficit in cytokine secretion of the GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs to a profound inability of these cells to synthesize cytokines, rather than to a defect in transcription or general protein secretion.\n\nGADD34 induction by poly I:C is therefore absolutely necessary to maintain the synthesis of specific cytokines and probably several other proteins in an otherwise translationally repressed context. Importantly, GADD34 exerts its rescuing activity only on a selected group of mRNAs including those coding for IFN-\u00df and IL-6, but not on all ER-translocated proteins, since cystatin C synthesis was strongly inhibited by poly I:C in all conditions tested.\n\nInterestingly, in GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs, PKR mRNA strongly accumulated in response to poly I:C (Fig. 4D), despite the absence of detectable IFN-\u00df production and PKR protein increase (Fig. 4B). This continuous accumulation of PKR mRNA in response to poly I:C suggests the existence of alternative molecular mechanisms, capable of promoting PKR mRNA transcription and stabilization independently of autocrine IFN-\u03b2 detection. Nevertheless in these conditions PKR expression, like IFN-\u03b2, was found to be dependent on the presence of GADD34 for its synthesis (Fig. 4B).\n\nRecent results indicate that PKR participates to the production of IFN-\u03b1/\u00df proteins in response to a subset of RNA viruses including encephalomyocarditis, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, and Semliki Forest virus [31]. Even though IFN-\u03b1/\u00df mRNA induction is normal in PKR-deficient cells, a high proportion of mRNA transcripts lack their poly(A) tail [31]. As GADD34 induction by poly I:C was completely PKR-dependent, we wondered whether the phenotypes observed in PKR\u2212/\u2212cells and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs could be related. Oligo-dT purified mRNA extracted from cells exposed to poly I:C were therefore analyzed by qPCR. PolyA+ mRNAs coding for IFN-\u00df and IL-6 were equivalently purified and amplified from WT and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs (Fig. S9). This confirms that albeit the phenotypes of PKR\u2212/\u2212 and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C cells might be linked, mRNA instability is not the primary cause of the cytokine production defect observed in GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C. Taken together these observations suggest the existence of a specific mRNAs pool, encompassing cardinal immune effectors such as IFN-\u00df, IL-6, and PKR, which are specifically translated in response to dsRNA sensing and increased levels of P-eIF2\u03b1. This mRNAs pool requires GADD34 for their translation during the global protein synthesis shut-down triggered by dsRNA detection.\n\nWe verified that GADD34 inactivation, and no other deficiency, was truly responsible for the loss of cytokine production by complementing GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs with GADD34 cDNA prior poly I:C delivery. IFN-\u00df secretion was partially restored in transfected GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C cells while eIF2\u03b1 was efficiently dephosphorylated in both WT and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C transfected MEFs (Fig. 4E). To further demonstrate that the phosphatase activity of GADD34 controls cytokine production upon dsRNA detection, we treated WT MEFs with guanabenz, a small molecule, which selectively impairs GADD34-dependent eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation [58]. Upon treatment with this compound, a dose dependent inhibition of IFN-\u00df secretion was observed in poly I:C-treated MEFs, confirming the importance of GADD34 in this process (Fig. S10).\n\nFibroblasts of both human and mouse origin constitute a major target cell of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) during the acute phase of infection [59]. In adult mice with a totally abrogated type-I IFN signaling, CHIKV-associated disease is particularly severe and correlates with higher viral loads. Importantly, mice with one copy of the IFN-\u03b1/\u00df receptor (IFNAR) gene develop a mild disease, strengthening the implication of type-I IFN signaling in the control of CHIKV replication [59]. Recently, human fibroblasts infection by CHIKV was shown to induce IFN-\u03b1/\u00df mRNA transcription, while preventing mRNA translation and secretion of these antiviral cytokines. CHIKV was found to trigger eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation through PKR activation, however this response is not required for the block of host protein synthesis [15].\n\nWe tested the importance of PKR during CHIKV infection by infecting WT and PKR\u2212/\u2212 MEFs with CHIKV-GFP, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and 50. Productive infection was estimated by GFP expression (Fig. 5A, left panel), while culture supernatants were monitored for the presence of IFN-\u03b2 (5A, right panel). PKR was found to be necessary to control CHIKV infection in vitro, since at least 60% of PKR\u2013inactivated cells were infected after 24 of viral exposure, compared to only 15% in the control fibroblasts population. WT MEFs produced efficiently IFN-\u03b2, while the hypersensitivity to infection of the PKR\u2212/\u2212 MEFs was correlated to a reduced type-I IFN production capacity after infection. Thus, during CHIKV infection, PKR is required for normal IFN production by MEFs. We also monitored protein synthesis in infected WT and PKR\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts using puromycin labeling followed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig. 5B). CHIKV-GFP positive PKR\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were found to incorporate efficiently puromycin, while in their infected WT counterpart protein synthesis was efficiently inhibited. Thus CHIKV, in this experimental model, induces a PKR-dependent protein synthesis inhibition and is therefore particularly relevant to further confirm our observations on the role of GADD34 in controlling type-I IFN production during response to viral RNAs.\n\nGADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs were exposed to CHIKV-GFP (MOI of 10 or 50) for 24 and 48 h. Productive infection was estimated by GFP expression and virus titration (Fig. 6A), and culture supernatants monitored for the presence of type-I IFN (Fig. 6B, left). Only minimal CHIKV infection (15%) could be observed at maximum MOI in WT MEFs (Fig. 6A, left), while robust IFN- \u03b2 amounts were already produced at the lowest MOI (Fig. 6B). Contrasting with WT cells and regardless of the MOI used, a higher level of viral replication was observed in GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs (Fig. 6A). The GADD34-inactivated cells were clearly more sensitive to CHIKV, displaying a 50% infection rate after 24 h of infection (MOI 50) and a log more of virus titer in culture supernatants (Fig. 6A, right). Correlated with their susceptibility to CHIKV infection, IFN-\u03b2 production was nearly undetectable in GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs (Fig. 6B). Such observation confirms the incapacity of GADD34-deficient cells to produce cytokines in response to cytosolic dsRNA, a deficiency likely to facilitate viral replication. This interpretation is further supported by the abrogation of viral replication in both WT and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs briefly treated with IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 6C). Thus, GADD34 inactivation does not favor viral replication per se, but is critical for type-I IFN production. Interestingly infection levels were found to be higher in PKR\u2212/\u2212 than in GADD34 \u0394C/\u0394C MEFs, although this difference could be attributed to clonal MEFs variation, it more likely suggests that PKR-dependent translation arrest could be key in preventing early viral replication in this system. In addition, the relatively lower permissivity of GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs to infection at high MOI could indicate the existence of GADD34-dependent defense mechanisms, which could be independent from IFN production and eIF2-\u03b1 dephosphorylation. To strengthen and generalize these observations, we treated a different strain of WT MEFs with guanabenz and examined the consequences for CHIKV infection. Biochemically, GADD34 expression was induced upon CHIKV infection, and guanabenz treatment resulted in a clear increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, demonstrating the importance of GADD34 in limiting this process during infection (Fig. 6D, right). As observed with GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C cells, pharmacological and RNAi inhibition of GADD34 was found to increase significantly the sensitivity of MEFs to infection, while reducing their IFN-\u03b2 production (Fig. 6D and S10). Thus, induction of GADD34 and its phosphatase activity during CHIKV infection, in vitro, participates to normal type-I IFN production and control of viral dissemination.\n\nSeveral components of the innate immune response have been shown to impact on the resistance of adult mice and to restrict efficiently CHIKV infection and its consequences in vivo\n[10]. We decided to investigate the importance of GADD34 upon intradermal injections of CHIKV to WT (FVB) and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C mice. Neither strain of adult mice was affected by intradermal injections of CHIKV, with little statistically significant differences in the virus titers found in the different organs. Thus, GADD34 deficiency does not annihilate all the sources of type-I IFN in the infected adult animals, a situation exemplified by the capacity of GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C bone-marrow derived dendritic cells to produce reduced, but measurable IFN-\u03b2 in response to poly I:C [60]. This also infers that the light impact of GADD34 inactivation on mouse development [61] does not render these animals more sensitive to CHIKV infection.\n\nAs in Humans, CHIKV pathogenicity is strongly age-dependent in mice, and in less than 12 day-old mouse neonates, CHIKV induces a severe disease accompanied with a high mortality rate [59]. GADD34 function was therefore evaluated in this more sensitive context by injecting intradermally CHIKV to FVB (WT) and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C neonatal mice. As previously observed for C57/BL6 mice [59], when CHIKV was inoculated to FVB neonates, a rate of 50% of mortality was observed 3 days after the infection of 9-day-old mice, while 12-day-old pups were found essentially resistant to the virus lethal effect (Fig. 7A). Strongly contrasting with these results, all CHIKV infected GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C neonates died within 3\u20135 days post inoculation whatever their age (Fig. 7A). When infection was monitored 5 days post-inoculation of 12-day-old mice at, GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C pups displayed considerably more elevated CHIKV titers (10\u2013100 folds) in most organs tested, including liver, muscle, spleen and joints, the later being primarily targeted by the virus (Fig. 7B, left). As expected, and in full agreement with the in vitro data, infected GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C tissues showed a considerably reduced IFN-\u00df production (40\u201350%) compared to control tissues (Figure 7B, right), while serum levels were reduced by 20% (not shown). Although Infectious virus was poorly detected in the heart of WT animals, elevated titers of virus were observed in the heart of GADD34-deficient pups, matching the limited production of IFN in this organ. We further investigated the possible pathological consequences of cardiac tissue infection by carrying-out comparative histopathology. Hearts of infected GADD34-deficient animals displayed severe cardiomyocytes necrosis with inflammatory infiltrates by monocytes/macrophages and very important calcium deposition (Fig. 8), all being indicative signs of grave necrotic myocarditis. As a consequence, the left ventricles were strongly dilated, being probably the cause of acute cardiac failures and of the important death rate observed in GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C infected pups. Histology of infected FVB mice hearts was, however, normal with only few inflammatory cells (mainly lymphocytes) observed in the close vicinity of capillaries.\n\nGADD34 expression is therefore necessary to allow normal type-I interferon production during viral infection and to promote the survival of young infected animals. We could circumvent the age-related acquisition of viral resistance in GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C mice to 17 days, since mice inoculated at that age survived CHIKV inoculation. In these animals, 3 days post-infection, enhanced viral replication was observed in the spleen and muscles, matching the relatively low level of type-IFN production in these tissues (Figure 7C). Functional GADD34 is therefore required to mount a normal innate response against the virus, but in older mice type-I IFN production by non-infected innate cells is probably capable to gradually overcome GADD34-deficiency and limit viral proliferation in vital organs, such as the heart.\n\nTranslation inhibition occurs in response to stress, when other cellular activities have to be reassigned or suspended momentarily. We demonstrate here that the activation of PKR by cytosolic dsRNA results in a stress response, leading to ATF4 and GADD34 induction. GADD34 expression has been observed during the infection of cells by different types of viruses [62] or intracellular bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes\n[63]. Our observations demonstrate that GADD34 expression is a direct consequence of PKR activation and dsRNA sensing. Interestingly, although GADD34 induction by poly I:C promotes eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, this is not sufficient to prevent global protein synthesis arrest. The uncoupling of efficient eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation from global translation recovery in response to cytosolic poly I:C implies therefore the existence of additional mechanisms inhibiting global translation. The 2-5A/RNAse L pathway does not seem to be sufficiently active in our experimental setting to explain this prolonged protein synthesis inhibition. The cleavage or the inactivation of other translation factors could work in concert with eIF2\u03b1 to block or affect the efficiency of other individual steps of mRNA translation [64]. For instance, the phosphorylation of translation elongation factor 2 (eEF-2) is also controlled by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Thus, Thr56 phosphorylation of eEF-2, which is known to inhibit its translational function by reducing its affinity for ribosomes, could contribute directly to the protein synthesis inhibition induced by PKR activation [65]. Independently of general protein synthesis inhibition, eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation is necessary for the production of specific proteins upon dsRNA-induced translation inhibition. As demonstrated for ATF4, translation of a given mRNA during stress could rely on the structure and organization of its coding sequence, as well as the presence of multiple alternative initiation codons [49]. Surprisingly, functional GADD34 expression was found necessary for the translation of IL-6, IFN-\u03b2, and PKR. This observation points to the existence of a distinct group of mRNAs efficiently translated upon dsRNA detection and dependent on GADD34 activity.\n\nGADD34 is extremely short lived and has been shown to accumulate on the ER, when over-expressed [51]. GADD34 could mediate its activity at the ER level and influence differently eIF2\u03b1 sub-cellular distribution according to the type, localization, and level of activity displayed by the different eIF2\u03b1 kinases. The strong eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation mediated by PKR in response to poly I:C or viral infection and leading to the initiation of translation inhibition, could be circumvented through GADD34 activity solely at the ER level, thereby allowing local cytokine production in absence of other functional protein synthesis. This selectivity for translation of several specific mRNAs among other ER-secreted molecules suggests further that GADD34 dependent mRNAs might display specific features allowing their efficient identification by GADD34 and associated molecules, as well as allowing their translation in presence of minimal levels of active guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B.\n\nGADD34 and PKR are necessary to produce anti-viral cytokines during CHIKV infection, and probably other types of infection. PKR, ATF4 and GADD34 should therefore be considered as an essential module of the innate anti-viral response machinery. The importance of PKR in anti-viral type-I IFN responses has been the object of contradictory reports [30], [31], [66], [67]. Our observations, however, suggest that PKR function should be re-evaluated by integrating the impact of viral detection on cellular translation. In eIF2A/A and PKR\u2212/\u2212 cells, cytokine transcription is induced normally following poly I:C detection by DExD/H box RNA helicases, while as expected in these cells, no eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and subsequent host translation inhibition are observed. This lack of translation arrest in the absence of potent eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation allows for normal cytokine production during dsRNA detection, with no requirement for an operational GADD34 feedback loop. The importance of PKR and GADD34 for IFN-\u03b2 and other cytokines production could therefore be directly linked to the efficiency of the cellular translation inhibition induced by RNA viruses, as exemplified here with CHIKV, which in MEFs strongly activates PKR and subsequent protein synthesis inhibition.\n\nGADD34\u0394C/\u0394C neonates are extremely sensitive to CHIKV infection and display signs of acute myocarditis and ventricles dilatation probably causing recurrent cardiac failures. CHIKV cardiac tropism is not normally observed in WT mouse and inability of heart tissues to produce sufficient type-I IFN in GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C could allow abnormally high viral replication, myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Interestingly many cases of myopericarditis induced by CHIKV and leading to dilated cardiomyopathies in infected patients have been reported since the 1970s after the different western Indian Ocean islands and Indian subcontinent disease outbreaks [68], [69]. These particular symptoms and complications might therefore be the consequences of great variation in the tissue-specific type-I IFN levels induced in CHIKV-infected patients, who might display particular polymorphisms in their innate viral sensing pathways increasing their peculiar susceptibility to viral dissemination in the heart.\n\nImportantly, our data reveal a link between pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and the UPR through the activation of the eIF2-\u03b1/ATF4 branch [70]. Similarly, several laboratories have reported that TLR stimulation activates the XBP-1 branch of the UPR and that XBP-1 production was needed to promote a sustained production of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6 [71], [72]. Here, we identify GADD34 as a novel functional link between ISR and PAMPs detection in MEFs, required for the production of cytokines including type-I IFN. It will now be important to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting GADD34 to reduce cytokines overproduction during inflammatory conditions.\n\nThis study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals the French Ministry of Agriculture and of the European Union.
