{"title": "SARS-coronavirus protein 6 conformations required to impede protein import into the nucleus", "body": "The coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, plus-strand RNA viruses that are widespread in nature, infecting birds as well as land, sea and flying mammals, causing humans gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases of varying severity. The \u223c30 kb CoV RNA genomes are all distinguished by conserved gene organizations. The CoVs encode well-described proteins required for virus entry, replication and assembly, and also encode more enigmatic small proteins of unknown function that are specific to one of the three CoV antigenic groups (Stadler et al., 2003) . Reverse genetic engineering methods have been used to ablate one or more of these smaller group-specific genes, and in general, these engineered manipulations have had little effect on in vitro CoV viabilities (Yount et al., 2005) . These fundamental observations make it clear that CoVs encode \"accessory\" proteins that are unnecessary for virus amplification in cell culture but are presumably operating in more complex in vivo environments to maintain these viruses in nature. Experiments to discern CoV accessory protein structure and function may contribute generally to CoV virulence and zoonotic potential, and their genetically engineered modification may be required to construct useful CoV vectors and attenuated CoV vaccines.\n\nSARS-CoV is the prototypic human pathogenic CoV. SARS-CoV is also the most complex known CoV with respect to accessory proteins, with eight accessory genes interspersed between those encoding virion structural components (Hussain et al., 2005; Rota et al., 2003; Snijder et al., 2003) . These accessory genes are present in SARS-CoVs isolated from bats, civet cats, raccoon dogs, and humans, suggesting important accessory functions in a variety of host environments Wang et al., 2005) . There is clear evidence that these accessory genes are expressed (Chen et al., 2007; Keng et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2006; Nelson et al., 2005; Pewe et al., 2005; Schaecher et al., 2007a,b; Tan et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2006 Yuan et al., , 2005 but their functions remain somewhat obscure. Currently there are a range of suggested and indicated activities for accessory proteins, including viral structural elements, ion channels, cell death inducers and interferon antagonists (Chen et al., 2007; Frieman et al., 2007; Hussain et al., 2008; Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2006; Schaecher et al., 2007a,b; Tan et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2005) .\n\nOf all the CoV accessory proteins currently under investigation, the SARS-CoV protein 6 is arguably the best understood with respect to its structure and function. This intriguing 63 amino acid peptide is amphipathic in its amino-terminal \u223c44 residues and very polar in the \u223c20 residues comprising its C-terminus. Protein 6 is found entirely on cytoplasmic membranes (Geng et al., 2005) , localizing on ER and Golgi organelles. Its membrane topology is N-endo C-endo, with a membrane-embedded stretch that is likely \u223c6 nm of alpha-helical structure Zhou et al., 2010) . With respect to function, protein 6 is a virulence factor, converting a sub-lethal infection of heterologous murine coronavirus into a lethal infection and conferring growth advantages to murine coronavirus and also to SARS-CoV in infected host mice and cultured cells Zhao et al., 2009) . The way that protein 6 supports these CoV infections may be twofold. The N-terminal lipophilic portion, presumably by remodeling 0168-1702/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2010.08.017 intracellular membrane architectures, supports more robust CoV RNA replication (Pewe et al., 2005; Tangudu et al., 2007) . The Cterminal polar portion, by interfering with protein import into the nucleus, detains transport of signaling proteins needed for innate immune responses . The way that protein 6 interacts with nuclear import factors appears to be similar to that of a classical NLS-containing protein, however, motifs and domains involved in the communication between protein 6 and nuclear import machineries are not fully characterized.\n\nA classical NLS is (1) necessary for nuclear import, (2) sufficient to target an unrelated protein to the nucleus, (3) able to interact with its putative import receptor.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the C-terminus of SARS-CoV accessory protein 6 binds to karyopherin-\u24232 (KPNA2) , and KPNA2 binds to karyopherin-\u2424 (KPNB1) (Gorlich et al., 1995) . These protein complexes are restricted to cytoplasmic membranes via the hydrophobic N-terminus of protein 6, which limits capacities of KPNA2 and KPNB1 to escort proteins from the cytoplasm to nuclei (Moroianu et al., 1995) . KPNA2 typically binds and directs the transport of proteins containing the \"classical\" nuclear localization signal (cNLS) (Moroianu et al., 1995) , which is lacking in protein 6. Protein 6 does, however, contain a cluster of four basic residues at its C-terminus, which weakly resembles a bipartite NLS (Kalderon et al., 1984) . To assess whether this putative NLS is necessary for p6 to impede protein import into nuclei, we replaced basic residues (RKKK) to alanine by PCR based mutagenesis (Fig. 1 ). If these basic residues are part of a KPNA2-interacting NLS motif, then their replacement with alanines would eliminate p6-mediated interference with nuclear protein import. Co-expression of mutant p6 RKKK-ala with a cNLS bearing reporter (3XGFP-NLS) revealed that the mutant protein lacking basic residues was as potent as native p6 in blocking nuclear import of the cNLS reporter ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). These data indicate that the potential bipartite NLS located at protein C-terminus does not play a role in preventing nuclear import. Interaction between protein 6 and import factors may therefore depend on protein conformation or may be mediated by an unknown NLS-containing adaptor protein.\n\nA conformation-dependent NLS on protein 6 might demand that the entire C-terminus be presented to components of the nuclear import machinery. To identify the minimal required C-terminal residues comprising this putative NLS, chimeric protein constructs were prepared. Each construct contained an N-terminal hydrophobic region (amino acid residues 1-30) derived from Hepatitis C Virus Non-Structural protein 5A (HCV NS5A) and C-terminal segments of variable length (amino acid residues 45-63, 35-63 or 24-63) derived from protein 6. Both the HCV NS5A and the protein 6 N-termini are ER membrane-associated (Brass et al., 2002) but bear no primary sequence similarities. This makes it likely that the chimeric proteins occupy subcellular positions that are similar to those of native protein 6, but at the same time, permit the Fig. 1 . Mutagenic analysis of the potential NLS on protein 6. Protein 6 contains an N-terminal amphipathic region and a C-terminal signal rich region containing a cluster of four basic residues (bold italics). To determine the role of C-terminal basic residues in nuclear import, the indicated R-K-KK were substituted to alanine by overlapping PCR. 293 cells were co-transfected with indicated plasmids (left column) and at 24 h post-transfection, intracellular distributions of GFP-NLS reporters were determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy. evaluation of nuclear import independently from other proposed functions associated with the N-terminal amphipathic region of p6 .\n\nTo determine the effect of chimeric NS5A-p6 proteins on nuclear import of cNLS bearing reporter, NS5A-p6 proteins (NS5A-p6 24-63 , NS5A-p6 35-63 and NS5A-p6 45-63 ) were individually expressed in concert with the cNLS-GFP reporter. Intracellular localization of the reporter protein was then determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. The NS5A-p6, all C-terminally tagged with HA epitopes, were also visualized by western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy.\n\nAs expected, intracellular localization of NS5A-p6 fusion proteins was similar to native protein 6, colocalizing both with Golgi and ER markers ( Fig. 2A) . Nuclear accumulation of reporter protein was greatly reduced in cells transfected with the NS5A-p6 24-63 construct, but not in the NS5A-p6 35-63 and NS5A-p6 45-63 -expressing cells (Fig. 2B and Table 1 ). Protein 6-mediated nuclear import inhibition depends on a threshold p6 accumulation, which is necessary for the partial or complete titration of cytoplasmic importin-\u2424. Western blot analyses revealed an abundant and comparable level of expression of all three of the chimeric p6 proteins in transfected cells (Fig. 2B, bottom panel) , indicating that the observed differences in nuclear import impedance were not simply due to differences in protein accumulation. These results thus suggested that the region of protein 6 that is sufficient to impede nuclear import extends beyond the known required residues 52-63 Hussain et al., 2008) .\n\nPreviously published reports have implicated the C-terminal residues 52-63 in p6 interaction with karyopherin-\u24232 and nuclear import inhibition. Our results further extended these findings and revealed that residues 52-63 are part of the larger functional 24-63 domain that is necessary for nuclear import obstruction. The sequence analysis and mutational studies indicated that protein 6 does not contain a classical sequential NLS and that p6 interactions with nuclear import machinery are most likely conformationdependent. A conformation-dependent NLS might demand that the entire C-terminus be presented to components of the nuclear import machinery and might also be extremely sensitive to inactivation by any of a number of substitution or deletion mutations.\n\nTo determine whether the p6 C-terminal sequences can target an unrelated cytosolic protein to the nucleus, a set of 3XGFP constructs were appended with p6 residues 24-63, 35-63 and 45-63. The 84 kDa 3XGFP protein exceeds the passive diffusion limit of the nuclear pore complex and remains in the cytoplasm unless appended with a NLS, which we presumed, might be supplied by p6. 293 cells were transiently transfected with 3XGFP-p6 plasmids and expressed proteins were visualized by western blotting and by fluorescent microscopy. All proteins were expressed as full-length chimeric proteins of expected sizes and no truncated or degraded isoforms were detectable by western blot with anti-HA (Fig. 3A , middle panel) or anti-GFP (Fig. 3A, bottom panel) antibodies. The putative p6 NLS was inert in the context of these 3XGFP. Similar to the parental 3XGFP, and distinctively unlike the control 3XGFP-SV40 NLS construct, all three 3XGFP-p6 fusion proteins localized in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (Fig. 3A, top panel) . Thus the collective findings are that p6 24-63 could impede nuclear import, but could not itself operate as an NLS to direct a GFP reporter protein into the nucleus.\n\nWe extended these investigations by asking whether the import-impeding properties of protein 6 might be transferable to a membrane protein that localizes outside of the ER, presumably far from nuclear pore complexes. To this end, a panel of constructs was made in which p6 C-termini were appended to the N-terminal residues of murine coronavirus E, a well-known intermediate compartment/Golgi protein (Corse and Machamer, 2000) . 293 cells were co-transfected with E(1-53) -p6 constructs in concert with the 3XGFP-NLS reporter, and localization of transiently expressed proteins were determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Contrary to NS5A-p6 proteins, E-p6 proteins did not interfere with the nuclear accumulation of a cNLS-containing reporter protein (Fig. 3B) . The lack of interference by E-p6 constructs could be due to a number of factors. The N-terminal hydrophobic region or E-p6 is structurally different from the N-terminal amphipathic region of wild type p6 or NS5A-p6. The intracellular localization of NS5A, protein 6 and E proteins are believed to be dictated by the N-terminal hydrophobic regions of each protein. Tethering the C-terminal tail of p6 to the E protein N-terminal hydrophobic region could potentially alter both subcellular location and conformation, which could have affected its interaction with nuclear import factors. We have attempted to distinguish among these two possibilities but we were not successful in targeting identical p6 C-termini to different organelles and thus the importance of subcellular location remains unknown.\n\nNotably, the E-p6 24-63 and E-p6 35-63 proteins did not accumulate as robustly as did E-p6 45-63 . Indeed the p6 24-45 region is destabilizing, such that chimeras containing this peptide region are detectable by immunofluorescence assay (Fig. 3B ) but less so by western blot (data not shown). We do not envision these differences being due to differential expression, as all three fusion proteins were transcribed and translated using the same plasmid vectors. It is therefore possible that particular N-terminal sequences are necessary to embed the proteins into the appropriate intracellular membrane environments and provide protection from proteolysis. This suggests yet another role for the amphipathic \u2423-helix in the stability of protein 6, besides its role in proper folding of the C-terminal tail and acceleration of coronavirus infection.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested a critical role for the aminoterminal half of protein 6 in accelerating coronavirus infection. Most of these studies were performed using mutant protein 6, either lacking a part of the N-terminal amphipathic alphahelical motif or having individual residue substitutions in the alpha-helical region. Replacement of the p6 amphipathic alphahelical motif with one from NS5A did not compromise nuclear import impedance, and therefore prompted us to investigate the importance of this replacement in the separate virus accelerating function. The NS5A-p6 24-63 and full-length protein 6 have identical carboxy-termini and structurally similar amino-termini of different amino acid compositions. Both proteins are potent nuclear import inhibitors, an activity assigned to the carboxy-terminus in previous studies and further elaborated in this report. To determine if chimeric NS5A-p6 24-63 protein could also affect coronavirus infection, 293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing either full-length p6 or NS5A-p6 24-63 , then infected one day later with MHV (strain rJ.2.2; moi 0.2). After an 18 h infection cycle, viral products were identified in cell lysates and in culture media by western blotting and by plaque assay. Contrary to the nuclear import assay, where protein 6 and chimeric protein NS5A-p6 24-63 efficiently interfered with nuclear import, only p6 was capable of accelerating MHV infection (Fig. 4) . We also have infected cells harboring E-p6 (24-63, 35-63 and 45-63) ; none of these chimeric proteins had any effects on MHV infection progression or viral titers (data not shown). Previously, we and others demonstrated that full-length p6 or p6 lacking its C-terminal tail enhanced coronavirus infection and these new findings provide additional evidence for the sequence-specific amphipathic \u2423-helix requirement.\n\nOur data suggest that the C-terminus of protein 6 can impede nuclear import only in the context of structurally similar N-terminal amphipathic alpha-helical domains. These findings support our hypothesis of a conformation-dependent NLS. Many viral and cellular proteins utilize conformation-dependent nuclear localization signals to shuttle in and out of the nucleus. Bovine Herpesvirus 1 Tegument Protein VP22 accumulates in the nucleus of infected cells but does not contain a classical sequential NLS. A relatively long 103 amino acid sequence is required for nuclear localization . The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein UL84 (pUL84) utilizes the importin-\u2423/\u2424 pathway but does not contain a classical importin-\u2423 binding motif, rather a large domain of \u223c282 residues is necessary for nuclear localization (Lischka et al., 2003) . Several cellular nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling proteins also lack well defined nuclear localization or nuclear export signals. The tumour suppressor PTEN lacks obvious canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences or nuclear export sequences (NES) that could account for its targeting (Gil et al., 2007) . The latent transcription factor STAT1 which is activated in response to IFN-\u2425 and translocated into the nucleus does not contain a classical NLS as defined by the basic amino acid cluster. Rather, interaction with nuclear import machinery is unconventional, dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation and homodimerization (Sekimoto et al., 1997) . Thus a conformation-dependent motif facilitating cytoplasmic -nuclear protein transport is often apparent. An interesting feature of the SARS-coronavirus protein 6 is that it presents such a motif to impede general nuclear import."}
