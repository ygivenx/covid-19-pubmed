Based on limited sampling of potential reservoir 37 species, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be most similar to bat coronaviruses at the 38 genomic level, potentially indicating that bats are its natural reservoir [7] [8] .\n\nFollowing the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, genomic analyses have played a key role in the 41 public health response by informing the design of appropriate molecular diagnostics and 42 corroborating epidemiological efforts to trace contacts [8] [9] [10] . Taken together, publicly 43 available sequence data suggest a recently occurring, point-source outbreak, as described 44 in online sources [10] [11] [12] . Aspects of the response make the assumption that the genetics of 45 SARS-CoV-2, including mechanisms of gene expression and molecular evolutionary rates, 46 are comparable with previously characterised coronaviruses [11] [12] . It remains highly 47 relevant to validate these assumptions experimentally with SARS-CoV-2-specific data, with 48 the potential to reveal further insights into the biology of this emergent pathogen. To address 49 this, we describe (i) the architecture of the coronaviral subgenome-length mRNAs, and (ii) 50 phylogenetic approaches able to provide robust estimates of coronaviral evolutionary rates 51 and timescales at this early stage of the outbreak.\n\nCharacterised coronaviral species produce a nested set of polyadenylated subgenome-54 length mRNA transcripts through a mechanism termed discontinuous extension of minus 55 strands that yields mRNA transcripts of different length. The discontinuous transcription 56 mechanism repositions the 5\u2032 leader sequence upstream of consecutive viral open-reading 57 frames (ORF) where each translation start site becomes located at the primary position for 58 ribosome scanning (Figure 1a ). Subgenome-length mRNAs have a common 5\u2032 leader 59 sequence, near-identical to that located in the 5\u2032-UTR of the viral genome, with the genome-60 length RNAs also having an mRNA function [13] [14] \n\nTo define the architecture of the coronaviral subgenome-length mRNAs, a recently 67 established direct RNA sequencing approach was used, based on a highly parallel array of 68 nanopores [16] . In brief, nucleic acids were prepared from culture material with high levels of 69 SARS-CoV-2 growth, and sequenced with use of poly(T) adaptors and an R9.4 flowcell on a 70 author/funder.
