{"title": "Genomics of Emerging Infectious Disease: A PLoS Collection", "body": "Today, the Public Library of Science publishes a collection of essays, perspectives, and reviews about how genomics, with all its associated tools and techniques, can provide insights into our understanding of emerging infectious disease (http://ploscollections.org/emerginginfectiousdisease/) [1]\u2013[13]. This collection, focused on human disease, is particularly timely as pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza (commonly referred to as swine flu) spreads around the globe, and government officials, the public, journalists, bloggers, and tweeters strive to find out more. People want to know if this flu poses more of a threat than other seasonal flu strains, how fast it's spreading (and where), and what can be done to contain it. As this collection illustrates, the increasing speed at which complete genome sequences and other genome-scale data can be generated for individual isolates and strains of a pathogen provides tremendous opportunities to identify the molecular changes in these disease agents that will enable us to track their spread and evolution through time (e.g., [3],[7],[8]) and generate the vaccines and drugs necessary to combat them (e.g., [5]\u2013[7]). The collection also shines a spotlight on specific pathogens, some familiar and widespread, such as the influenza A virus (e.g., [9]); some \u201creemerging,\u201d such as the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex that causes tuberculosis [10]; and some identified only recently, as with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (which causes peptic ulcers and gastric cancer [11]).\n\nThere is no simple definition of an emerging disease, but it can be loosely described as a disease that is novel in some way\u2014for example, one that displays a change in geographic location, genetics, or function. Emerging infectious diseases are caused by a wide range of organisms, but they are perhaps best typified by zoonotic viral diseases that cross from animal to human hosts and can have a devastating impact on human health, causing a high disease burden and mortality [8]. These zoonotic diseases include monkeypox, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), in addition to influenza A and the lentiviruses that cause AIDS. The apparently increased transmission of pathogens from animals to humans over the recent decades has been attributed to the unintended consequences of globalization as well as environmental factors and changes in agricultural practices [8]. Generally, the burden of these diseases is most strongly felt by those in developing countries. Brindley et al. [12] point to the debilitating effects of the most common human infectious agent in such areas\u2014helminths (parasitic worms)\u2014and the role that genomics plays in advancing our understanding of molecular and medical helminthology. Compounding the problem of emerging infectious diseases in developing countries is the reality that researchers in developing countries have often been unable to participate fully in genomics research, because of their technological isolation and limited resources. As Harris et al. emphasize [13], \u201ccollaborations\u2014starting with capacity building in genomics research\u2014need to be fostered so that countries that are currently excluded from the genomics revolution find an entry point for participation.\u201d\n\nThis collection is a collaborative effort that combines financial support from Google.org (which has also sponsored research on emerging infectious disease through its Predict and Prevent initiative [14]) with PLoS's editorial independence and rigor. Gupta et al. [1] provide Google.org's perspective and vision for how systematic application of genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics to infectious diseases could predict and prevent the next pandemic. To realize this vision, they urge the community to unite under an \u201cInfectious Disease Genomics Project,\u201d analogous to the Human Genome Project. This is, as the authors admit, a potentially \u201cgrandiose\u201d and difficult proposition. Some researchers might justifiably argue that much is already being achieved\u2014as demonstrated by this collection\u2014and that the vision is na\u00efve. However, as every article in the collection also points out, tremendous challenges remain if the potential of genomics in this field is to be realized.\n\nOne problem is that, despite the fact that sequencing is now the method of choice for characterizing new disease agents, and new substantially faster and cheaper sequencing methods are continually being produced, we still lack the range of computational tools necessary to analyze these sequences in sufficient detail [4]. It is possible to sequence the entire assemblage of viruses in a particular tissue type or host species [3] and to obtain complete or nearly complete genome sequences for large samples of bacteria [7]. Yet we remain in the early, albeit essential, stages of pathogen discovery (Box 1). These sequences can be interpreted fully only when integrated with relevant environmental, epidemiological, and clinical data (e.g., [3],[4],[8]). And, despite the increased sequencing, really comprehensive genome data are still only available for a few key pathogens, which further limits our understanding. For example, a full quantitative understanding of the processes that shape the epidemiology and evolution\u2014the phylodynamics\u2014of RNA viruses is currently possible only for HIV and influenza A virus [3].\n\nIn this collection, you will find not only the views of leading researchers from several different disciplines, and a provocative vision from a funding agency, but also the contributions of six different PLoS journals (PLoS Biology, PLoS Medicine, PLoS Computational Biology, PLoS Genetics, PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, and PLoS Pathogens). The PLoS open-access model of publishing makes possible such a large multidisciplinary cross-journal collection, in which all articles are simultaneously available online for unrestricted reuse, regardless of venue (see also the podcast that accompanies the collection; http://ploscollections.org/podcast/emerginginfectiousdisease.mp3).\n\nOur aim is that this collection will add to other \u201copen science\u201d activities that have helped provide insights into infectious disease more quickly than would have been thought feasible only a few years ago. This accelerated availability of research findings is exemplified by the recent response to the flu pandemic. Consider, for example, data access. Traditionally, scientists have released data after publishing a study. Fortunately, in part due to experience from genome sequencing projects, prepublication flu sequence data have been released in a relatively unrestricted manner to the community [15]. This has in turn enabled anyone\u2014not just those who collected the data\u2014to carry out analyses while the epidemic is occurring (when in principle there is still time to save lives) rather than being forced to provide a posthumous account of the spread of infection. Such a response highlights both the importance of early data access and the removal of restrictions in the use of data (e.g., in many past cases data might be released but use of the data in presentations and publications would be limited).\n\nThe value of open access to sequence data is helping to put pressure both on private organizations to release their sequence data [16],[17] and on all agencies to release other information (e.g., metadata about strains) more rapidly. This pressure is not being brought to bear only on flu data\u2014in this collection Van Voorhis et al. [5] call on pharmaceutical companies to deposit the structural coordinates of drug targets from all globally important infectious disease organisms in public databases.\n\nOf course, data about any infectious disease are not very useful unless placed in the scientific context of past studies (i.e., publications) specifically about the disease or about methods to analyze such data. It is also important to have access to information about other diseases and other organisms that might impact its spread or evolution. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of open science in response to flu has been the move toward pre-journal publication release of findings. Many flu researchers took the available data, analyzed it, and posted results on blogs [18],[19], wikis [20], and other sites. Although some view this \u201cnon peer-reviewed\u201d release as unseemly, it is clear that it has helped accelerate the science in the study of pandemic H1N1 2009 and led to some important journal papers [17]. Indeed, such advances helped provide one of the stimuli for PLoS's most recent initiative, PLoS Currents: Influenza, a Google \u201cKnol,\u201d for the rapid communication of research results and ideas about flu vetted by expert moderators [21].\n\nThis is not to say there are no possible risks or drawbacks from more openness. For example, some governments may avoid releasing data because of fears about discrimination (as was seen in many aspects of the flu in Mexico). Others worry that complete openness might foster the spread of misinformation. However, as Fricke et al. argue in their article on the relationship between genomics and biopreparedness [2], open source genomic resources are actually of immense benefit to those in charge of our public health and biosecurity.\n\nIt is clear that \u201cfor all stages of combating emerging infections, from the early identification of the pathogen to the development and design of vaccines, application of sophisticated genomics tools is fundamental to success\u201d [8]. It is equally clear that open science and open access to publications and data will be key to that success. Whatever one's position has been on the various open science initiatives, there is no doubt that the \u201cesoteric\u201d label on some open science initiatives has largely been eliminated by the emergence of H1N1 flu epidemic.\n\nThe faster, cheaper, and more openly we can distribute the discoveries of science, the better for scientific progress and public health. As this collection emphasizes, managing the threat of novel, re-emerging, and longstanding infectious diseases is challenging enough even without barriers to scientific research. We encourage you to make the most of this collection by sharing, rating, and annotating the articles using our online commenting tools. Better yet, join the discussion by providing your own vision to prevent the emergence and spread of the next rogue pathogen."}
