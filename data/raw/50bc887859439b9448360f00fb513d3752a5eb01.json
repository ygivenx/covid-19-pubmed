{"title": "Adipogenesis in ducks interfered by small interfering ribonucleic acids of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 gene", "body": "Adipose tissue, a major energy reservoir in animals, is associated with nutrient intake and endocrine signaling. It stores excess energy in the form of triglycerides (TG) and releases the stored TG as free fatty acids and glycerol when necessary (Mandrup and Lane, 1997; Anghel et al., 2007) . This is true in food animals as well. Modern selective breeding has been successful in improving both egg and meat production in recent years, and the target of intensive selection in modern commercial meat lines is to increase growth rate and muscle mass (Huang et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007; Brun et al., 2008) . However, excessive fat deposition has also accompanied these selective progresses. Excessive fat in ducks has been one of the major problems for modern duck meat production. It not only reduces carcass yield and the efficiency of feed but also leads to difficulties in processing. Unfortunately, it is likely that breeding techniques will not be able to reduce fat deposition while improving meat production because of the adverse correlation between these traits (Baeza et al., 2002) . Furthermore, little is known regarding lipid metabolism in ducks. It is therefore imperative to study adipogenesis and the genes that regulate the deposition and release of lipids in ducks to discover an approach to decrease excessive fat deposition and maintain the fast growth of ducklings.\n\nIn mammals, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), an important regulator in fat metabolism, participates in adipocyte differentiation and maintenance, including the promotion of lipid storage (Rosen and Spiegelman, 2001) . Previous research indicates that the expression of PPAR\u03b3 increases during adipocyte differentiation and induces the accumulation of oil droplets in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, whereas the knockout of PPAR\u03b3 impairs adipocyte differentiation (Rosen et al., 1999) . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 acts as a nuclear receptor and transactivates multiple target genes involved in lipid metabolic pathways, such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) (Nakachi et al., 2008) . Meanwhile, the high affinity of PPAR\u03b3 to thiazolidinediones, insulin-sensitive drugs, suggests that PPAR\u03b3 is also involved in the insulin signaling pathway in mammals (Miles et al., 2003) . However, there is little evidence to prove that PPAR\u03b3 plays a role in modulating fat deposition in ducks, but this will be clarified in the present study.\n\nRibonucleic acid interference is a sequence-specific mechanism to knock down the expression of target genes. This technique has been successfully used both in vivo and in vitro (Singh and Hajeri, 2009) . For instance, specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza viruses have been shown to efficiently inhibit viral replication in nonhuman primates and mice (Li et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2007) . Further, siRNA targeting of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 to inhibit ocular neovascularization in mice has also been successful (Shen et al., 2006) . In the present study, 3 PPAR\u03b3 siRNA expression plasmids were constructed and used to determine if siRNA that target PPAR\u03b3 can modulate PPAR\u03b3 expression and fat accumulation in ducks.\n\nThe complete coding sequence of duck PPAR\u03b3 (EF546801) was derived from the GenBank database. Three target sites at position 168, 271, and 273 in the coding region (Table 1) were selected according to the siRNA program of the Sfold Web-based Criteria (Ding et al., 2004) , and the 3 selected sequences were submitted to a BLAST search against the chicken and duck genomes to ensure their specificity. To obtain short hairpin RNA, a typical oligonucleotide that has 5 bases containing a restriction site at its 5\u2032 end, 19 bases of sense strand, 7 to 9 bases of hairpin loop, 19 bases of antisense strand, 6 bases of terminator, and 6 bases corresponding to a unique restriction site (resulting in a total length of 65 bases) and 2 complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized. These were annealed and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ-ZsGreen Vector (BD Biosciences, Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The recombinant plasmids were designated as pS-P167, pS-P271, and pS-P273, respectively. A plasmid (pS-negative) encoding a hairpin siRNA comprising a nonsense sequence that has not been found in the mouse, human, or duck genomes was used as the negative control.\n\nRabbit anti-PPAR\u03b3 polyclonal antibodies, \u03b2-actin monoclonal antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG (L+H)horseradish peroxidase antibodies, and rabbit antimouse IgG (L+H)-horseradish peroxidase antibodies were purchased from Boster Biological Technology Ltd. (Wuhan, China).\n\nHealthy 7-d-old Cherry Valley ducklings were raised in floor pens. A commercial diet and water were provided ad libitum throughout the experiment.\n\nA total of 80 Cherry Valley ducklings (aged 15 d) were divided randomly into 5 groups (16 in each group), of which three were testing groups, one was the negative control group, and one was the blank group. The siRNA expression plasmids pS-P167, pS-P271, and pS-P273 were injected (100 \u00b5g) intravenously within 5 s into each duck in the test groups, the pS-negative plasmid (same dosage) was injected into each duck of the negative control group, and an equivalent volume of PBS was injected into the blank group. Eight ducks from each group were killed at age 21 and 35 d, respectively. Blood, abdominal fat, muscle, and liver samples were collected, and the abdominal fat and liver were weighed. Serum samples were separated from blood and stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nTriglycerides in the serum were measured with a human testing kit (Nanjing Jiancheng, Nanjing, China; Yang et al., 2008) using a serum biochemical autoanalyzer. The TG levels in the muscles of all ducks were measured using a Buchi B-811 device (Buchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland) according to the protocols of the manufacturer.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from the abdominal fat, purified using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA; Zou et al., 2009) , and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using AMV reverse transcriptase (Takara, Beijing, China). Real-time PCR was carried out using Light-Cycler FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SybrGreen I (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) to monitor the reaction amplification on a 7500 real-time thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Peroxisome pro- liferator-activated receptor \u03b3, LPL, and FABP4 were studied, and the primers used are listed in Table 2 . Gene expression levels were normalized using \u03b2-actin amplified from the same sample, and the expression values are reported as the fold change.\n\nTissue explants were homogenized in 10 mL of lysis buffer (1% SDS in PBS containing protease inhibitors) and placed on ice for 2 h with vortexing every 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 20,627 \u00d7 g for 30 min. The top fat layer was discarded, and the middle clear layer of solubilized proteins was collected. After protein quantification via the Bradford method, Western blots were performed. Briefly, 60 \u00b5g of total protein from the tissue lysates was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 1% BSA in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20 for 1 h and then incubated with a rabbit anti-PPAR\u03b3 antibody and a monoclonal antibody against \u03b2-actin as a control. The membranes were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA).\n\nThe SAS Application Package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for statistical analysis. Data for multiple comparisons were analyzed using ANOVA, followed by Duncan's multiple range test. The level of significance in the current study was P < 0.05.\n\nThere is a HindIII site at position 2456 in the pSI-REN-RetroQ-ZsGreen plasmid, and we inserted a Hin-dIII site in the hairpin fragment of the siRNA. Thus, the production of 2 fragments (2,400 and 4,000 bp, respectively) from recombinant plasmids digested with HindIII revealed that the siRNA were correctly inserted. This cloning was further confirmed by sequencing the recombinant plasmids; no mutations were found in the 3 designed hairpin fragments (Figure 1 ).\n\nDownregulation of PPAR\u03b3 due to the different siR-NA is shown in Figure 2 . It was demonstrated that the expression of PPAR\u03b3 mRNA could be significantly inhibited by the 3 specific siRNA expression plasmids (P < 0.05) but not by pS-negative (P > 0.05). The silencing efficiencies of pS-P167, pS-P271, pS-P273, and pSnegative, compared with the blank control, were 52.26, 30.4, 67.58, and 3%, respectively. To further confirm the alterations of protein expression after treatment with siRNA plasmids, Western blot analysis was carried out to investigate PPAR\u03b3 protein levels ( Figure 3) . The results show that the PPAR\u03b3 protein was significantly inhibited by pS-P167 and pS-P273 but only moderately inhibited by pS-P271. No significant difference in the expression of \u03b2-actin was observed among the different groups, and the expression of PPAR\u03b3 was not changed in the negative control group. These data agree with the mRNA expression changes shown by reverse tran- scription-PCR analysis and suggested that the inhibitory effects occurred at the translational level.\n\nThere was a significant decrease of LPL and FABP4 mRNA in abdominal fat when the expression of PPAR\u03b3 was downregulated by pS-P167, pS-P271, and pS-P273, respectively (but not by pS-negative), compared with normal individuals (blank, Figure 2 ). It was discovered that pS-P167 and pS-P273 were more effective at decreasing the expression of FABP4 and LPL than pS-P271, and this mirrors the results of the PPAR\u03b3 protein levels under these treatments.\n\nThe weights of the abdominal fat and liver from the experimental ducks are summarized in Figure 4A and B. There were no obvious differences in the liver weights between the 3 experimental groups and the control groups at either 21 or 35 d ( Figure 4B ). However, significant (P < 0.05) differences in the weight of abdominal fat between the siRNA groups (pS-P167 and pS-P273) and the control groups (pS-negative and blank) at 21 and 35 d were recorded ( Figure 4A ). The weight of the abdominal fat was greatly decreased in the 2 siRNA groups. The abdominal fat weight of the pS-P271 siRNA group was also decreased relative to the control groups, but this difference was not statistically significant.\n\nThe TG levels in serum and muscle from the siRNA groups were lower than in the control groups at both 21 and 35 d. However, none of these differences were statistically significant compared with the controls ( Figure  5A and B).\n\nThe function(s) of PPAR\u03b3 in white adipose tissue has been studied by several groups, and their results have demonstrated that PPAR\u03b3 is an essential transcription factor during the process of adipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation in mammals (Barak et al., 1999; Desvergne and Wahli, 1999; Kubota et al., 1999; Michalik et al., 2002) . It is also known that a moderate reduction of PPAR\u03b3 activity in PPAR+/\u2212 mice decreases the TG content of white adipose tissue (Matsui et al., 2004) . Further, Wang et al. indicated that the suppression of PPAR\u03b3 led to the inhibition of chicken preadipocyte proliferation . At present, there are 2 mRNA sequences of duck PPAR\u03b3 in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database and both sequences encode the PPAR\u03b3 1. The Western blot analysis of duck PPAR\u03b3 only displays 1 band (Figure 3) . Therefore, we are not sure if there is PPAR\u03b3 2 in ducks. The 3 siRNA of PPAR\u03b3 interfered against both duck PPAR\u03b3 1 and 2 if PPAR\u03b3 2 exists. Most of the sequences of PPAR\u03b3 1 and 2 are identical, except the PPAR\u03b3 2 encodes 11 more amino acids in the N-terminal sequence.\n\nIn China, the Cherry Valley duck markets at 35 d after hatching and it is divided into 2 periods [i.e., brooding period (0 to 21d) and finishing period (22 d to marketing)]. It is thought that the ducks deposit fat during the finishing period (start at 21st day), so the diet is changed into a kind of feed with higher metabolic energy at the 21st day to meet the requirement for fat deposition. Because it is reported that the PPAR\u03b3 was expressed at a relatively low level except in fat tissues, we only measured the expression of PPAR\u03b3 in fat tissue. In the current study, we found that after PPAR\u03b3 gene expression is decreased by siRNA in vivo, the weight of abdominal fat is significantly decreased in siRNA-treated ducks compared with the negative control group at ages 21 and 35 d (P < 0.05). This in- dicates that suppression of PPAR\u03b3 reduces abdominal fat deposition in ducks.\n\nPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3, a nuclear receptor, binds to the promoter regions of LPL and FABP4 via PPAR response elements and eventually promotes TG synthesis in mammals (Nakachi et al., 2008) . Lipoprotein lipase, which is secreted by adipocytes, triggers the release of fatty acids from lipoprotein-bound TG in the extracellular space (Wu et al., 2008) . Fatty acid-binding protein 4 is involved in shuttling fatty acids to cellular compartments, modulating intracellular lipid metabolism, and regulating gene expression (Mohlig et al., 2007) . In the current study, the expression of the LPL and FABP4 genes was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) when PPAR\u03b3 protein levels were also decreased. This indicates that LPL and FABP4 may also be the downstream target genes that are regulated by PPAR\u03b3 in duck adipose tissue. We speculate that the downregulation of PPAR\u03b3 decreases the abdominal fat deposition in ducks by directly decreasing the expression of LPL and FABP4 mRNA.\n\nIn birds, lipogenesis largely occurs in the liver, but storage occurs in extrahepatic tissues, mainly in s.c. tissues and muscles. Hepatic lipids are synthesized into very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are secreted into the blood, leading to lipid uptake and storage in adipose and other tissues (O'Hea and Leveille, 1969) . Plasma TG are the major components of VLDL in Tsaiya ducks, and increases in the plasma VLDL level can reflect increased liver assembly and secretion of VLDL (Lien et al., 2005; Andre et al., 2007) . A low content of LPL protein causes a decreased TG degradation rate in laying chickens than in the growing chickens (Griffin et al., 1990 ). In the present study on ducks, the TG levels did not obviously decrease in serum at 21 or 35 d of age after the expression of PPAR\u03b3 mRNA was downregulated. This indicates that downregulating PPAR\u03b3 decreased the liver lipogenesis rate and also decreased the rate of VLDL-TG degradation by LPL protein by decreasing the expression of LPL mRNA. Thus, the combination of decreased TG secreted into blood and decreased storage in tissues could maintain the content of VLDL-TG in serum.\n\nTriglycerides are transported into tissues via fatty acid transporters, such as CD36, which is regulated by PPAR\u03b3. The PPAR+/\u2212 mice show markedly reduced CD36 expression in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, and therefore, these tissues show reduced TG uptake and reduced TG content in PPAR+/\u2212 mice (Matsui et al., 2004) . In the present study, as the expression of PPAR\u03b3 mRNA was downregulated, the TG levels did not obviously decrease in duck muscle tissue at 21 or 35 d of age. According to previous studies on broilers, the genetic correlation between abdominal fat weight and i.m. fat percentage is not very close, and changes in the size of adipose tissue are not accompanied by i.m. fat changes (Zerehdaran et al., 2004) . In poultry, the i.m. fat content is low (Chartrin et al., 2006) , and this may explain why the variation in muscle TG did not reach significantly different levels in ducks in our study.\n\nThe efficiency of gene silencing, which is associated with the local mRNA structure at the targeted site, varies significantly according to the different gene positions targeted by siRNA (Luo and Chang, 2004) . As we know, off-target is major factor that can confound the expected results. There are far more than 3 siRNA designed when we search siRNA using sFold software (Ding et al., 2004) . Off-target effects will be minimized when as few siRNA as possible are needed to knock down their targets, so we chose three of the best of them. These 3 sequences barely have sequence homology with other genes when compared with chicken and duck genomes. Our results show that the PPAR\u03b3 pS-P167 and pS-P273 siRNA can effectively suppress the expression of PPAR\u03b3. The reason for the lower efficiency of the pS-P271 siRNA may be due to positional effects.\n\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to report that the duck PPAR\u03b3 gene can regulate adipogenesis. Our results indicate that suppression of the duck PPAR\u03b3 gene reduces abdominal fat deposition and also regulates the expression of LPL and FABP4 mRNA. Thus, the duck PPAR\u03b3 gene is a key transcription factor affecting fat deposition in ducks.\n\nThe current research was financially supported by the Project for Critical Technology during the Eleventh 5-Year Plan in the Hubei Province (2006AA202A04), the Key Project for Industrialization during the Eleventh 5-Year Plan in Wuhan (20062001017), and the Na-tional Project for the Support of Science and Technology (2008BADB2B08)."}
