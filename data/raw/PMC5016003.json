{"title": "Negative pressure of the environmental air in the cleaning area of the\nmaterials and sterilization center: a systematic review", "body": "Aerosols are generated and released by humans in various activities, such as breathing,\ntalking, coughing and sneezing; Bathing with contaminated water; aerosolization of\nsewage waste in toilets or drainage system for outdoor environments; cleaning and\nrinsing surfaces indoors; spraying in agriculture\n1\n. Aerosols are defined as smaller particles or equal to 5\u03bcm, that may or may not\ncontain an infectious agent and, due to their size, can remain suspended in the\natmosphere for hours, slowly being transported over long distances and achieve adjacent\nareas\n2\n.\n\nAerosols containing an infectious agent that remain in the environment can be inhaled by\nsusceptible individuals, even if there is no close contact with the disposing source, or\ncontaminated surfaces\n3\n. The main diseases transmitted by aerosols are tuberculosis, measles and chicken\npox. However, there are reports of aerosolization of other microorganisms such as fungi,\nClostridium difficile and Staphilococcus aureus\n\n4\n\n-\n\n5\n.\n\nThe droplets that are larger than 5\u03bcm, remain suspended for a few seconds and quickly\nlay on the floor or other surfaces due to gravity. Its liquid portion can evaporate,\ndepending on the environmental conditions, resulting in aerosols. There are slight\nvariations of the nomenclature and definition of sizes, however the Brazilian National\nHealth Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) uses the definition that aerosols are smaller than\n5\u03bcm, which was adopted for this study\n2\n\n-\n\n3\n. \n\nVentilation systems and air conditioning in various establishments promote comfort, and\nare useful in the prevention and treatment of diseases transmitted via aerosols. The use\nof these systems in health services (HS) requires special attention. The basic\ndifferences stem from the need to restrict the dispersion of air within an environment\nto adjacent areas; the specific requirements for ventilation and filtration aiming to\ndilute and eliminate contamination; the different requirements of temperature and\nhumidity for each area; and sophistication that is demanded for the project\n6\n.\n\nAmong hospital sectors that require air pressure control, temperature and humidity we\nhighlight the Central Service Department (CSD). The CSD is responsible for medical\ndevice (MD) from one use to another, it must contain a reception and cleaning room; a\npreparation and sterilization room; a chemical disinfection room (where applicable); a\nmonitoring area of the sterilization process and a storage and distribution of sterile\nmaterials room\n7\n. \n\nThe RDC Resolution 15, of March 15, 2012 from ANVISA, disposes on the good practice\nrequirements for the processing of MD and other measures. According to this resolution,\nthe CSD class II (which processes complex materials) and processing companies must\nmaintain a negative differential air pressure between the cleaning area and adjacent\nareas\n7\n. The areas adjacent to the reception and cleaning room consist mainly of the\npreparation and sterilization room of MD and circulation areas of other\nprofessionals.\n\nDifferential ambient air pressure means that there is a difference in measuring the\nrelative air pressure between two areas. This parameter works to provide a positive or\nnegative pressure within a particular area in order to prevent air from migrating from\none to the other. If a room has a negative air pressure it means that the air supply is\nless than the exhaustion\n6\n.\n\nWith the growing concern for the safety of patients and health professionals, there is a\nneed for implementation of best practices that should be based on proven scientific\nevidence. Thus, the objective of this systematic literature review was to analyze the\nscientific evidence for the formation of aerosols during the MD cleaning activities in\nCSD and the impact of negative air pressure, or to the safety of the material to be\nsterilized, and for health professionals in the adjacent areas too.\n\nThe steps of this systematic review followed the guidelines published in the\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis\n(PRISMA) Statement, which aims to help the authors to carry out complete and clear\nrecords of a systematic review and meta-analysis\n8\n.\n\nIt was defined as the guiding question of this review: Formation of aerosols occurs\nduring cleaning activities of MD, and what is the impact of negative air pressure in the\ndispersion of these to adjacent areas?\n\nInclusion criteria were defined as the PICO strategy as follows: P (Patients) = health\nprofessionals or MD cleaning professionals; I (Intervention) = negative pressure; C\n(Comparison) = normal atmospheric pressure; O (Outcome) = dispersion of aerosols. After\nan initial search in major databases and query in the manuals and guidelines, we\nidentified the lack of studies, both experimental and field, published specifically\nregarding the CSD. Therefore, it was defined as inclusion criteria: a. Studies published\nin full, regardless of the publication date and language; b. Clinical studies,\nexperimental studies, guidelines, manuals and national and international technical\nstandards; c. Studies that reported data on the justification for the presence of\nnegative differential ambient air pressure in MD cleaning area; d. Studies that have\naddressed the formation of aerosols or droplets during the MD cleaning procedures.\nExclusion criteria were defined as: a. Reviews of unsystematic or editorial literature;\nb. Studies where there was only review of the dispersion aerosols; c. Studies that\nevaluated other air treatment modes.\n\nInitially a consultation of experts in the field of air treatment methods in Health\nSystem was held with the clinical engineers and professionals from the Brazilian\nAssociation of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heating - (ABRAVA in Portuguese).\nThese experts were asked about the scientific evidence of the need for negative\ndifferential ambient air pressure in CSD, which indicated guidelines, manuals and\nnational and international technical standards for consultation. These documents were\naccessed through the websites of organizations such as the National Health Surveillance\nAgency (ANVISA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and\nthe Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI).\nThe documents that were not available on the Internet were obtained from the\ndocumentation center of ABRAVA, such as technical standards and booklets of: Brazilian\nAssociation of Technical Standards (ABNT), American Society of Heating,\nRefrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the\nAmerican Institute of Architects (AIA). \n\nInitially, to search for scientific articles, consultations were held on portal\ndescriptors encyclopedias (MeSH - Medical Subject Headings do PUBMED)\nand (\"CINAHL Titles\" - Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health\nLiterature), to identify descriptors related to the inclusion criteria.\nHowever, to ensure access to all potentially eligible studies, keywords were also used.\nTherefore, the following descriptors were selected: equipment and\nsupplies; health personnel; ventilation;\nair pressure; aerosols; atmospheric\npressure. And the keywords: devices; health\nworker; negative pressure; HVAC system\n(heating ventilation and air conditioning);\nbioaerosol; airborne; droplet;\ndroplet nuclei. \n\nAs a search strategy, the website and databases were consulted as follows: PUBMED and\nSCOPUS - the controlled descriptors of MESH were primarily used in a single search box.\nIn CINAHL - through the feature \"CINAHL Titles\" preferably with the expanded definition\nof the term, with the search first being carried out with all titles separately and\nlater combining the titles using the Boolean operators. In the Web of\nScience - the controlled descriptors of MESH and synonym keywords were used.\nAccess to Embase was restricted in the country at the time of data collection. Filters\nwere not used in the bases and the Boolean AND operator was used to cross the data\nbetween the descriptors of the PICO strategy. The OR operator was used to descriptors or\nsynonyms keywords. The search was carried out between March and April 2015, and updated\nin June of the same year. The search strategies were built with the help of a librarian\nexpert in database.\n\nGiven the scarcity of scientific articles detected initially, it was decided to conduct\na comprehensive search, a large number of articles being found with crossings. The\ntitles and summaries of them were read, identifying potentially eligible articles. Thus,\n68 articles were read in full by two of the authors of this review, individually, which\nevaluated whether the articles corresponded to the established inclusion criteria. If\nthere were no correlation, the authors recorded the reason for the exclusion. A third\nresearcher was consulted when there were doubts and disagreements. \n\nThe manual search step was the consultation of all technical document references (when\nmentioned), of the included articles and non-systematic reviews read in its entirety in\norder to identify other potentially eligible studies.\n\nThe articles selected according to the inclusion criteria were analyzed separately by\ntwo reviewers. After the critical reading, reviewers completed a table, prepared by two\nof the authors of this review in Microsoft Excel, considering the concerned matter. The\ntable was composed of the following items: identification of the article; objective,\nstudy outline; study site; aerosolizing mechanism; presence or absence of negative air\npressure environment; type of statistical analysis; main results; main conclusions;\nrecommendations for their practice; and finally limitations of the studies. Because of\ngaps in the methodological descriptions and results, it was necessary to consult a third\nreviewer to discuss the doubts of all articles. After establishing a consensus among\nreviewers, a final table with all the relevant data extracted from the studies was\nprepared.\n\nThe risk of bias was assessed according to the design of each study. Due to the\nheterogeneity of the articles, it was decided to present the results descriptively.\nSince laboratory experimental studies are not included in the reference classification\nof evidence, studies of this review were classified as inconclusive, partly conclusive\nand conclusive, considering the guiding question of this review.\n\nFive technical documents and four scientific articles that met the inclusion criteria\nwere analyzed. The results of the search strategies are shown in the flowchart (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experts consulted indicated five technical documents to be analyzed: 2011 ASHRAE\nHandbook. Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning Application\n\n6\n; ABNT NBR 7256:2005\n9\n; Comprehensive guide to steam sterilization and sterility assurance in\nhealth care facilities from AAMI\n10\n; Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care\nFacilities from CDC\n11\n; e Guidelines for design and construction of hospital and health care\nfacilities from AIA\n12\n. \n\nIn the technical standard NBR 7256, of the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards\n(ABNT/2005)\n9\n, regarding the air treatment in health care facilities - Requirements for the\nproject and construction of facilities, the environments are classified according to the\nrisk of adverse health events by exposure to ambient air, with numerical assignments,\nlevel zero being considered low risk and level three the ambient with high-risk health\nproblems related to air quality. The CSD was classified as level one \"an area where it\nwas not found the risk of health problems related to air quality, but some authorities,\norganizations and researchers suggest that the risk should be considered.\"\n\nAll the technical documents analyzed\n6\n\n,\n\n9\n\n-\n\n12\n advocate that the reception area, and the cleaning and separation of CSD\nmaterials should have a negative differentiation ambient air pressure relative to\nadjacent areas (min 2,5Pa), without recirculation of air and that all the air inside\nshould be eliminated directly outside. There is no consensus on the number of air\nchanges per hour, as well as on the dilution method for the elimination of\npathogens.\n\nIn Brazil, the NBR 7256/2005\n9\n is followed, referring to CSD in the cleaning area, which resembles the\ninternational recommendations, as shown in Figure\n2.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four scientific articles included\n13\n\n-\n\n16\n are studies in English: three\n13\n\n-\n\n15\n published between the decades of 1960-1980 and only one in the 2000s\n16\n; three\n13\n\n-\n\n14\n\n,\n\n16\n are laboratory experimental studies and one is transversal\n15\n (held in hospital bathrooms); three\n13\n\n-\n\n15\n studies conducted in the United States and one in Australia\n16\n. No studies that evaluated the negative air pressure in MD cleaning areas were\nfound on the searches. Therefore, studies that evaluated the formation of aerosols\nduring cleaning products or surfaces were included, even if not specifically made in a\nCSD environment.\n\nIn three studies\n13\n\n-\n\n14\n\n,\n\n16\n, experiments were performed to analyze the aerosol recovery generated from\nequipment commonly used in the CSD: ultrasonic cleaner and scrubbers with pressurized\nwater.\n\nIn the study conducted with the ultrasonic cleaner\n14\n, air samples above the water surface in the washer tank were collected (the air\ngatherer had a flexible termination that was placed inside the washing machine), aiming\nto recover aerosols with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Air specimens were\nobtained in four moments: before the washer was turned on (during 15 minutes),\nconsidering that the instruments were placed within it (five minutes), during its\noperation (25 minutes), and after it was off (15 minutes); covered with a lid\n(suggesting that all generated aerosols were from the washer); and with the lid off\n(ambient air added to the aerosol generated by the washer). Samples from surfaces on\nnine points around the washer (before and after collecting air samples) and from the\ncleaning solution (10ml) were collected. By analyzing the four moments of air\ncollection, higher average of colonies per ft3 were found during the operation of the\nwasher. And when compared to the results of the samples with and without a lid,\nstatistically significant differences were found, with larger numbers of colonies\nrelated to the operation with the lid, which means aerosols formed exclusively by the\noperation of the washer. The results of surface samples were not influenced by the\naerosol, because there was no correlation between the number of colonies found before\nand after the operation of the washing machine. The authors suggest that surface\ncontamination is related to cleaning solution leakage and dripping during the insertion\nand removal of the MD, regardless of the washer being with or without the lid. There was\nno apparent correlation between the contamination of the air and the cleaning solution.\nThe authors indicated that the ultrasonic cleaner should be used with the lid to\nminimize the release of aerosols to the environment.\n\nRegarding the formation of aerosols from automatic washers with pressurized water, in a\nstudy\n13\n, surface cleaning was performed (wall) with an intentionally contaminated\nprepared solution of organic food components added with microorganisms (Serratia\nmarcescens; spores of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus\naureus positive coagulase, Mycobacterium smegmatis and a\nbacteriophage virus). The size of the aerosols generated after the use of a pressurized\nautomatic washer and cleaning with stiff bristle brush were compared. In addition, we\nevaluated the number of viable microorganisms after cleaning only with water and a\ndisinfectant solution (sodium hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, peracetic acid,\ndetergents and phenolic disinfectants, non-toxic neutral liquid detergent). The wall was\ninfected one day prior to the collection of air samples, that occurred immediately\nbefore, during and after the spraying of the cleaning solution / disinfection, through\ntwo types of air collectors: Andersen sampler six stages (size\nevaluation of the particles) and May air sampler (impingers -\nquantitative evaluation). It was observed that after using the washer with pressurized\nwater and the collection with the Andersen sampler for 15 to 30\nseconds, the number of colonies in the aerosol was greater compared to brushing (24,565\nand 1628, respectively). Furthermore, 45.5% of the particles formed after the washer\nwith pressurized water correspond to the third and sixth stages of the gatherer (up to\n6\u03bcm) and after brushing, 27.6%; therefore, aerosols generated by the washer were\nsmaller. For all the pathogens, the number of viable microorganisms per liter of air\ncollected were higher during the cleaning procedures, when compared to the numbers after\ncompletion. When compared with washing only with water, all the cleaning solutions /\ndisinfection reduced the number of viable microorganisms in aerosols and the peracetic\nacid solution was proved to be more effective. Comparative analyzes using statistical\ntests were not performed.\n\nIn another study\n16\n, in order to evaluate the formation of aerosols during household activities, a\ncar cleaning experiment was conducted in a controlled environment, sealed with plastic.\nTwo ways of using the hose with pressurized water were tested: spraying (used for\nrinsing) and a water jet with controlled flow (used to remove dirt), conventional (low\npressurization - manual trigger) and efficient (high pressurization). The authors used\nthree gauges of particle sizes not aiming to identify microorganisms in aerosols. It was\nobserved that when used in higher pressurization (efficient method), more and smaller\nparticles were identified (up to 2\u03bcm). However, there were no statistically significant\ndifferences between the methods: efficient and conventional or between the spray modes\nand jet. The authors reported that they observed the formation of visible fog in the\ntent where the experiments were carried out, especially after the high pressurization\nmethod, and cogitated they were hydrated aerosols, possibly lower than 500\u03b7m.\n\nA study\n15\n was included considering the possibility that the CSD could be equipped with hot\ntap water. In this one, the formation of aerosols from showers and hot tap water\ncontaminated with Legionella pneumophila was evaluated. Samples were\ncollected for cultures of water from showers and faucets; Swabs of the\ninternal surface of those; air samples outside the scope of the shower jet; and samples\nof 14 air rooms, where the gatherer was positioned 61cm away from the tap area. Two\ntypes of air collectors were used: Andersen sampler six stages\n(Calibrated to collect particles 0,65\u03bcm to 3,3\u03bcm in stages four, five and six and in\nstages one, two and three particles larger than 3,3\u03bcm) and two stages (differentiation\nonly in two particle sizes: 0.8 to 8\u03bcm and greater than or equal to 8\u03bcm). Air samples\nwere collected before the tap was opened, while open, and after being closed. Of 19\npaired samples of tap water or swab of the tap's nozzle and air\nsamples, in 17 water samples and in 13 air samples there was identification of bacteria\ncolonies. Eleven samples with positive cultures were obtained while the tap was open.\nAerosols generated by taps were fewer in number and larger in size when compared to\naerosols of the showers. No statistical tests were applied. \n\nThe summary of the results is shown in Figure\n3.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the selected technical papers for this review, there is a consensus of the need for\nnegative pressure air in cleaning and decontamination areas of the MD in CSD. This\ndirective corresponds to the norms of the RDC ANVISA 15/2012\n7\n, where it is stated that in class II CSD a negative differential ambient air\npressure (minimum 2,5Pa) should be kept between adjacent areas. However, it was found\nthat both the national and international technical documents do not cite scientific\nreferences that prove, with conclusive evidence, the risk of environmental exposure to\naerosols for both the MD and for professionals. The classification of CSD as level one,\nrelated to the risk of adverse health events by exposure to ambient air\n9\n, states that this risk is not scientifically proven, but based on expert\nopinions, which reinforces the need for research to generate data for the support of\nlaws, rules and recommendations. \n\nAs mentioned in the introduction of this study, microorganisms in the air of the CSD\nenvironment can be related to two issues: inhalation by professionals and depositing of\nthem on the clean material in the preparation area. Regarding the last issue,\nconsidering that the MD will be sterilized before use and that this method was designed\nto eliminate all forms of microbial life\n10\n, by theoretical deduction, the possible air contamination of the MD can be\nconsidered negligible.\n\nIt is noteworthy, in technical documentation, the need for environments with efficient\nsystem of negative air pressure having automatic doors, that have all windows and floor\nsealed, because the opening and closing of a door, associated with the movement of\npeople, immediately reduces the differential air pressure between the areas. In the case\nof environments with a high circulation of people, as it occurs in the CSD cleaning\narea, the construction of an anteroom should be considered \n6\n\n,\n\n11\n. \n\nThe influence of the movement of doors and people traffic in the negative pressure air\nefficiency in isolation rooms was demonstrated in the study by Adams, Johnson and\nLynch\n17\n. The air pressure differentials were measured between the room and the anteroom\nand between the room and the hallway. The average in the aerosol count per m3 where\nlarger when there were greater movement of people and doors, however the aerosol score\ndecreased as the air pressure differential increased. The authors indicate a negative\nair pressure differential of 20 Pa when there is heavy traffic between areas. In this\ncontext, there is a need for routine monitoring of the pressure differential between the\nareas, for example, by testing with the observation of the direction of smoke flow or\nspecific gauges\n18\n.\n\nOther parameters shown in Figure 2 relate to the\nminimum and total number of air changes per hour. The ventilation and air conditioning\nsystems act favorably in controlling infections decreasing the time of exposure to\nbioaerosols by means of air exchange and differential pressure. In addition, they\nprovide the dilution of the air through supplement and/or exhaustion, reducing the\nconcentration of contaminants; improving air quality by filtration; allowing control of\ntemperature and humidity; and creating air flow patterns\n19\n. \n\nThe need for negative air pressure in isolation rooms is strongly evidenced in the\nliterature, aiming to reduce the risk of exposure microorganisms transmitted by aerosol\ninfected people to uninfected people (especially other patients or professionals). The\nadvent of diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian flu and drug\nresistant tuberculosis raises concern for health authorities in relation to the\nisolation of patients\n11\n\n,\n\n18\n. Also there is no consensus on the number of air changes per hour in isolation\nrooms\n4\n.\n\nThe release of aerosols also occurs in other sectors of the health system. In the study\nof Verde and collaborators\n20\n, the goal was to characterize the air pollution levels in different areas of the\nhospital (emergency room, surgical ward and operating room). After finishing the\nprocedure, it was detected an increase in the concentration of bacteria in the air.\nHowever, the contamination level returned to baseline values (collected in the empty\noperating room) after cleaning procedures.\n\nBronchoscopy is a procedure recognized for its potential to generate aerosols, by\nstimulating coughing patient leading to the contamination of the environment and\nprofessionals. In the study by Lavoie and collaborators\n21\n, although it is not the main goal of the authors, sizes and aerosol\nconcentrations were compared in two bronchoscopy rooms, (one with negative differential\nair pressure and one without). After statistical analysis, it was shown statistically\nsignificant increase in the average concentration of aerosols per m3 in a non-negative\ndifferential room during the performance of bronchoscopy, and there was no significant\nincrease in the room with differential. These data shows a greater contamination of the\nair in rooms without negative pressure, while performing procedures that form aerosols.\nDespite the concentration of aerosols return to baseline levels more quickly in the room\nwith negative differential air pressure after completion of the procedures, it took\nfifteen minutes to the bioaerosols levels to return to baseline in both rooms.\n\nThe papers included in this review are in the majority originated in previous decades,\nwhich demonstrates the need of current research conduction because there were advances\nin the technology of the equipment used in CSD, for example, in ultrasonic cleaner. The\nultrasonic cleaner complement the manual cleaning or are self-cleaning in cleaning the\nMD with simple conformation depending on the power of ultrasound. They are mainly\nsuitable for complementary cleaning of the complex forming MD and operate on the\nprinciple of cavitation (sound waves propagated in an aqueous medium fragmenting rupture\nor dirt adhered to products)\n7\n. Despite using the same principle, the equipment currently available are modern,\nof different dimensions and efficiency when compared to the washer used in the study\nincluded in this review\n14\n, and the fact that they are usually operated capped. A limitation of this study\nwas the definition for the recovery of only one microorganism (Pseudomonas\naeruginosa) and it was rated as partially conclusive.\n\nIn the studies included in this review\n13\n\n,\n\n16\n, it was shown that using pressurized water cleaning devices generate more\naerosol when compared to conventional methods (brushing and low pressurization of\nwater). Considering the guiding question of this review and the fact that these\nexperiments were not performed in a CSD environment they were classified as partially\nconclusive. On CSD, the pressurized water guns are used for crude dirt cleaning.\nCompressed air guns are used for drying products with lumen and complex\nconformation\n22\n. \n\nAbout the size of the particles, it was evidenced in this review that the aerosol\ngenerated after the use of pressurized water surface cleaning devices were smaller than\n5\u03bcm\n13\n\n,\n\n16\n. In the study of Bollin and collaborators\n15\n, there are reports that Legionella pneumophila aerosols generated by the tap\nwere larger than the ones in the shower, however, there is no detailed description of\nthe sizes. Particles larger than 10\u03bcm are more likely to remain on the surface of the\nupper airways and not penetrate into the lower lung regions. However, the smaller the\nparticle size, the easier it is its moving until the alveoli\n23\n. Researchers say less than 5\u03bcm aerosols can be easily inhaled and it moves\nslowly with speed lower than 1m / h\n24\n.\n\nThe size of the aerosol is the factor that most influences in its biological properties\nand displacement. The permanence of aerosols in ambient air undergoes action of\nphysicochemical processes such as evaporation, interaction with other particles,\ntransportation, gravity, temperature, relative humidity and air currents, among others.\nThere are reports that aerosols remain suspended in the same environment for years\n25\n. Therefore, there is evidence of air pollution in the CSD cleaning area;\nhowever, data on the permanence in the air and displacement of aerosols to adjacent\nareas is lacking. A limitation of the studies included in this review was the lack of\ncontrol of environmental factors where the experiments were carried out, which may have\nunderestimated or overestimated the recovery of aerosols.\n\nIn a study of this review the contamination of water and air by Legionella\npneumophila was evaluated and it was identified that the strains detected in\naerosols were of the same subtype of the samples of shower water and hot tap water\n15\n. This study has limitations regarding the collection of data because there has\nbeen no standardization of the number of samples, time and air collection instrument,\nfurthermore, the authors collected water samples a week before the air samples, which\nresulted in its classification as an inconclusive study. \n\nEnvironmental contamination by Legionella pneumophila aerosols has been\nreported, mostly from showers, humidifiers and ventilatory support equipment\n(bag-valve-mask device) rinsed with contaminated water\n26\n. Infection by these bacteria generates concern especially for immunosuppressed\npeople. In a retrospective study in elderly care institutions\n27\n, evaluated the contamination of the water supplied to the shower and the\noccurrence of Pontiac fever symptoms that is a benign form of infection caused by\nLegionella pneumophila and resembles the symptoms of influenza\ninfection. The incidence of Pontiac fever in this population was 0.11 cases/people/year\n(95% CI 0:07 to 0:15). Of the 32 reported cases, 29 had been exposed to contaminated\nwater. Considering these data, the water of hot water taps contaminated in the CSD can\nlead to the formation of aerosol with Legionella pneumophilla.\n\n\nIn summary of the results of this review, it was found that air contamination by aerosol\nwas higher during the cleaning procedure or while the tap was turned on\n13\n\n-\n\n15\n, returning to baseline levels after these procedures were completed . These data\nconfirm the need to use respiratory personal protective equipment (PPE) by professionals\nresponsible for cleaning products on CSD. The RDC 15/2002\n7\n determines that the reception area and cleaning worker must wear a mask or face\nshield, goggles, gloves, long sleeve waterproof aprons, ear protection and closed\nfootwear. However, there is no description of the type of mask. Considering the results\npresented in this review as the size of the aerosols formed, suggests the use of N95\nmask (a mask that has the capacity to filter particles <3\u03bcm) in the mentioned\nareas\n2\n\n,\n\n13\n, although no studies have assessed the risk of disease transmission via aerosol\ngenerated in cleaning activities. It is known that, in the chain of transmission of\ninfections, there is need for interaction between the elements: host susceptibility,\npresence, source, input port and output of the infectious agent and a vehicle of\ntransmission, in addition to the amount of it. Therefore, the risk of CSD employees, or\nother areas of health services being infected by aerosols vary fundamentally according\nto the elements of infection transmission chain\n19\n. \n\nThere were no scientific evidence on occupational diseases related to the cleaning\nactivity in CSD. Greater emphasis is given to accidents with sharp objects, chemical or\nergonomic exposure. The use of PPE in CSD is problematic due to the compliance to the\nuse and discomfort reported by the professionals working in this sector\n28\n. Nurses should the responsibility to raise awareness and motivate the CSD team\nof the obligation and benefits of using PPE.\n\nConsidering the occupational health of the CSD workers, the environment temperature\ncontrol contributes to the comfort of the professional\n10\n. The control of this parameter, and the relative humidity is possible through\nthermo hygrometer installation. However, maintenance of air quality with microbiological\napproach, based on the values recommended by ASHRAE\n19\n, it is impractical in the reality of the CSD. In this sector there is no full\ncontrol of conditions of environmental contamination, as carried out in a controlled\nproduction structure, found in the pharmaceutical industry, considering that\nmicroorganisms can be released both by professionals (eg, movement of people, sneezing,\ncoughing, expiration, speech) and by the activities carried out there.\n\nGiven the above, this review has brought advances in scientific knowledge in the control\nof air pollution in CSD, providing theoretical foundations for better understanding of\nthe phenomenon studied. It was found that aerosols are inevitably generated during the\nMD cleaning activities, emphasizing the importance of the use of PPE among cleaning room\nworkers. Because of the risk of the deposition of contaminant particles, this data\nreinforces the need for decontamination of surfaces touched associated with the hand\nhygiene of professionals. Considering the aerosols generated during the operation of the\nultrasonic cleaner, it is recommended to use it with the lid closed.\n\nScientific evidence showed that aerosols are generated during cleaning activities and\nuse of devices found in CSD such as the ultrasonic cleaner and the washer with\npressurized water. Although the need for a negative differential ambient air pressure\nbetween the cleaning area and adjacent areas in CSD is standardized, no studies\nevaluating its impact on the dispersion of aerosols were found, which could compromise\nthe safety of the material in the preparation room and the health of the cleaning room\nprofessionals and the ones that circulate in the adjacent areas.\n\nThe studies have not provided information regarding the occupational health of workers\nin the surrounding areas, but there are strong indications for the use of the N95 mask\nby cleaning area workers. It demonstrates the need to conduct research on the occurrence\nof occupational diseases in the workers of CSD."}
