{"title": "Synthesis and cytotoxic studies of novel 5-phenylisatin derivatives and their anti-migration and anti-angiogenic evaluation", "body": "Isatins are a class of structurally versatile molecules and their core structure appears in many biologically active molecules and pharmaceutical agents. Isatin derivatives have been reported to possess a broad spectrum of activities such as anticancer [1, 2] , antidepressant [3] , anticonvulsant [4] , antifungal [5] , anti-HIV [6] and anti-inflammatory [7] , etc. In the last decade, N-substituted isatins have attracted increasing attention from both industry and academia. Vine et al. has reported that some N-benzyl isatin derivatives were more cytotoxic than their N-H counterparts toward some lymphoma cells as well as a series of human cancer cell lines, including human leukemic (K562, U937 and Jurkat), liver (HepG2), breast (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), prostate (PC-3) and colorectal (HCT-116) cell lines [8] . Chen's and Chiyanzu's groups reported that N-substituted isatin derivatives exhibited inhibition activities against SARS CoV 3CLpro and parasitic cysteine proteases [9, 10] . Later on, Limpachayaporn and Liu found that 5-sulfonylisatin analogues could act as caspase-3,7 inhibitors and SARS-CoV 3C-like protease inhibitors [11, 12] . In addition, Chinnasamy's group found that some N-1 and C-5 disubstituted molecules such as 1-(substituted benzylidene)-3-(1-(morpholino/piperidinomethyl)-2,3-dioxoindolin-5-yl)urea derivatives exhibited antiepileptic activity and neurotoxicity [13] . Previously, we reported some 5-(2carboxyethenyl)isatin derivatives as anticancer agents, and found that the combination of a 5-[trans-2-(methoxycarbonyl)ethen-1yl] group and a 1-(4-methoxybenzyl) group (compound 5e61, Fig. 1 ) in isatin significantly enhanced it's cytotoxic activity [14] . However, further research on this molecule indicated that the presence of a metabolically unstable acrylic ester moiety on the C-5 position is the key to its in vivo efficacy. In order to further improve the antitumor property of this type of 1,5-disubstituted isatin molecules, we have synthesized a serious of isatin derivatives and studied their cytotoxicity. The results showed that although the substituent of 5-methacrylate could increase the antitumor activity of the target compound, it is not stable in metabolic processes (unpublished data). Therefore, we report a series of new compounds in this paper, which can maintain good anti-tumor efficacy even without the use of 5-methacrylate substituents. Among them, compound 2m was shown as the most active compound against human leukemia K562 cells. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of the cytotoxic activity of compound 2m was explored on antimigration and anti-angiogenesis.\n\nFirstly, the target compounds were synthesized according to the procedures outlined in Scheme 1. Monosubstituted isatins 1a-1g were obtained in two steps with a improved yield of 55e80% [15] . Moreover, 5-Bromoisatin (1d) was coupled with six different boronic acids by microwave-assistant Suzuki coupling reaction to afford compounds 1h-1k in 70e80% isolated yield [16] . Secondly, N-alkylation of 1i led to the synthesis of compounds 2a-2v in good to excellent yield (75e90%). Thirdly, compound 3a-3c were prepared from isatin derivatives by suzuki-coupling reaction (Scheme 2). Finally, compound 4a-4s were prepared from 5-bromo-1-(4methoxybenzyl)indoline-2,3-dione by Suzuki-coupling (Scheme 3).\n\nCompounds 5a-5k (Scheme 4) were prepared from 2m in good yield in one or two steps. Compound 2m was reduced with NaBH 4 in methanol under room temperature to afford compound 5a. Compound 5b was prepared by treatment of the compound 2m with methylmagnesium bromide in tetrahydrofuran at \u00c078 C. Compound 2m was reduced with hydrazine monohydrate in ethanol under reflux to afford compound 5c. Compound 5d and 5e were prepared by treatment of the compound 2m with (triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature. Compound 5f was synthesized by treatment of the compound 2m with ethylene glycol in toluene at 110 C. Compound 5g was prepared by treatment of the compound 2m with diethylaminosulfur trifluoride in DCM at reflux. Compound 5h was synthesized by treatment of the compound 2m with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in ethanol at reflux. The compounds 5i-5k were prepared by the treatment of 5c with benzaldehyde or substituted benzaldehyde and pyridine in ethanol.\n\nThe data obtained from 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and Mass Spectrometry confirmed the proposed structures (Spectral data results are provided in supporting information).\n\nWhen contemplating a new class of 1,5-substituted isatin structure that could avoid the metabolically liabile acrylic acid ester group found in compound 5e61 while maintaining its biological potency, we envisaged a general structure compound 5e61 (Fig. 1 ) [14] . It can bear a various of aromatic groups at the C-5 position, that carry some structural similarity in terms of their size and conjugation property, whereas the in vivo Michael addition liability of the 5-acrylic acid ester group could be eliminated.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2 , with the isatin as the core structure of our drug design, this strategy would allow us to start with the modification of the substitution pattern of the benzene ring, especially at C-5, followed by N-derivatization and then C-3 variation.\n\nThe in vitro antitumor activities of the 5-substituted isatins 1a-1k against two human tumor cells K562 and HepG2 were first evaluated. As shown in Table 1 , the cytotoxic activities of the 5phenyl substituted compounds are far better than the parent nucleus. Among them, compound 1i exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity against HepG2 cell lines (IC 50 \u00bc 0.96 mM).\n\nAfter compound 1i was identified as the potential lead, our SAR study was then focused on the N-derivatization based on the hypothesis that the combination of C-5 substitution with N-alkylation may further enhance their cytotoxic potency. A series of 5-(4methoxyphenyl) N-substituted derivatives (Scheme 1) were screened for their in vitro cytotoxic activity.\n\nAs can be seen from the data in Table 2 , introduction of simple aliphatic groups at N-1 (2a-2c) did not significantly enhance their potency. Moreover, a p-methoxyphenyl group at N-1 significantly diminished the potency. However, the introduction of benzyl groups into the N-1 position (2d-2v) resulted in much better inhibitory activities, with 10e300 folds improvement compared to that of 1i, pointing to the tendency that the N-1 position needs a relatively sterically larger group with certain lipophilic property to increase the potency. Further examination of the structure difference and the cytotoxic data of the compounds 2d and 2f-2v against K562 showed that the substituted benzyl group did increase the potency. The improvement in potency does not seem to be related to the electron density of the substituent groups (2f, 2r and 2h, 2l); however, the substituents' size (2k, 2p) and location (2n and 2m, 2o) plays a more significant role. Moreover, the excellent cytotoxic activity for the compounds containing N-1 para or ortho mono methoxy benzyl group (2m, 2o), dimethoxy benzyl group (2q) as well as a piperonyl group (2v) indicated that hydrogen bond receptor in this direction of the molecule could significantly enhance the potency (8e25 folds, compared to that of 2d).\n\nWith the identification of the p-methoxybenzyl group as an optimal substituent at N-1, our attention then turned back to the pmethoxyphenyl substitution on the benzene ring. Specifically, we were interested in finding out how the location would influence the cytotoxic potency. For this purpose, a series of isatins bearing pmethoxyphenyl group(s) at various position on the benzene ring were synthesized and their cytotoxic activities were examined. The compounds 3a-3c were synthesized following the procedure similar to that of 2m (Scheme 2) and their potency were listed in Table 3 . The 4-, 6-and 7-monosubstituted compounds 3a-3c exhibited much weaker potency than that of 2m (>220 folds), which may suggest that the N-1, C-5 disubstituted pattern in 2m possess a much favorable 2-dimensional orientation toward the biological targets.\n\nThe SAR analysis of the compounds in Table 3 revealed that the N-(p-methoxybenzyl) and 5-(p-substituted phenyl) disubstituted isatins are the most attractive candidates, with compound 2m exhibiting the highest potency. To further investigate the activity of the structural analogues of 2m, a number of 5-aryl N-(p-methoxyphenyl)satins were prepared (Scheme 3) and their inhibition against two human tumor cells were tested ( Table 4 ). As shown in Table 4 , among all the 18 compounds examined, the cytotoxic activities of the phenyl analogue 4k, region-isomers 4a, 4b as well as the 3,5-dimethoxy-phenyl substituted compounds 4c exihibted a 5e25 folds decrease in potency compared to 2m, indicating that the para methoxy group is necessary and its linear orientation maybe a critical factor in maintaining its high potency.\n\nThe halogen-containing compounds (4f, 4g, 4h), compounds (4i, 4j, 4l, 4m) possess either electron-donating or electronwithdrawing groups, all exhibit very similar inhibition, indicating that variation of the electron density at this position did not significantly change their potency.\n\nThe excellent potency 5-(4-pyridyl) substituted compound 4q and 5-(2-thiophenyl) substituted compound 4r suggest that groups possessing a Lewis basic site could potentially improve the compound's activity. The hydroxyl group containing compound 4o did not exhibit any improved activity in comparison to compounds 2m, 4q and 4r.\n\nThere was no significant potency change when the 5-phenyl substitution (4k) was replaced by 5-(4-methyphenyl) group (4i) or 5-(2-naphthyl) group (4p). However, the cytotoxic activity of the 5-(4-n-butyl)phenyl compound 4e dropped 15 folds from that of the non-substituted counterpart (4k), which indicated the bulky aliphatic chain is detrimental.\n\nDerivatization of the C-3 ketone group of 2m led to compounds 5a-5l (Scheme 4) and their cytotoxic activities were evaluated to establish the importance of this functionality. The testing result showed that all these derivatives are inferior candidates as inhibitors of K562 and HepG2 ( Table 5 ), suggesting that the carbonyl functionality at C-3 is essential in order to maintain the observed high antitumor activity.\n\nBased on these SAR studies, compound 2m exhibited significant cancer inhibitory activity in vitro against the tested cancer cell lines.\n\nThe IC 50 of compounds 2m against K562 cells and HepG2 cells were 30 nM and 50 nM, respectively (Fig. 3A) . Meanwhile, a normal human cell line (umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVEC) has been tested for 2m, the IC 50 was 920 nM. Then the molecular mechanism by which compound 2m exerts its cytotoxic activity on cells proliferation, migration and angiogenesis was further investigated.\n\nFirstly, the morphological changes in compound 2m-treated K562 cells were observed. K562 cells treated by compound 2m showed the cells morphology change of G 2 /M phase arrest (such as elongation of the cells) and typical apoptotic morphology (such as cell shrinkage and/or blebbing) (Fig. 3B ). As shown in Fig. 3B , the elongated cells increased significantly as early as 6 h after compound 2m treatment at a concentration of 30 nM as compared to \n\nIn vitro antitumor activities of compounds 1a-1k [14] . DMSO-treated cells. The apoptotic cells were clearly observed in K562 cells after the treatment with compound 2m for 24 h. These results indicated that compound 2m might inhibit the cell proliferation of K562 cells through the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.\n\nTo evaluate the cell cycle distribution of K562 cells with or without compound 2m treatment, we measured the DNA content by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 4 , after treatment with compound 2m (30 and 300 nM) for 48 h, the percentage of K562 cells in G 2 /M phase increased. Only 0.02% of cells were in G 2 /M phase in basic DMSO cultures. However, the exposure to compound 2m caused increased cell fraction in G 2 /M phase in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrated that compound 2m has cell proliferation inhibitory effect and can induce the cell cycle arrest of K562 cells in G 2 /M phase.\n\nThe presence of apoptotic K562 cells following compound 2m treatment was further revealed by flow cytometric analysis of cells double-labeled with Annexin V-FITC and PI (Fig. 5 ). After 48 h of treatment with compound 2m (30 and 300 nM), we observed that compound 2m showed significant apoptosis against K562 cells. The apoptotic rates of compound 2m-treated K562 cells increased to 43.4% and 95.2% of the total cells whereas only 4.1% and 4.3% apoptosis respectively at 30 nM and 300 nM. Result also indicated that the apoptosis was increased obviously in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. We have concluded that compound 2m inhibits the proliferation of K562 cells by inducing apoptosis in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner.\n\nTo study whether compound 2m could inhibit migration and repair ability of tumor cells, wound healing assay and transwell assay were performed by HepG2 cells. After HepG2 cells were wounded, they were treated with the indicated concentrations of compound 2m (10 nM, 30 nM, 100 nM) for 0, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h respectively. As shown in Fig. 6A , after treatment by DMSO for 48 h, the migration distance was 184.89 mm. The migration distances of HepG2 cells treated with compound 2m were 162.89 mm, 135.22 mm and 96.24 mm respectively at 10 nM, 30 nM and 100 nM.\n\nBy calculation, we found that the higher concentration of compound 2m, the higher the inhibition ratio. The inhibition ratios of HepG2 cells treated with compound 2m were 11.9%, 26.9% and 47.9% respectively at 10 nM, 30 nM and 100 nM.\n\nTranswell assay is an experimental technique for studying the tendency of cells which is applied in cell culture, cytotaxis, cell migration and cell invasion. As shown in Fig. 6B , basic DMSO did not affect migration of HepG2 cells. While, the compound 2m could inhibit the HepG2 cells migration and have a dose-dependent inhibitory effect.\n\nTube formation plays an important role in the development of tumors. Angiogenesis is also the path which tumors transition from benign to malignant. Inhibiting this process can significantly prevent the development and spread of tumor tissue. As shown in Fig. 7 , basic DMSO did not affect tube forming of HUVEC cells. However, the compound 2m could inhibit the angiogenesis of HUVEC cells and have a dose-dependent inhibitory effect.\n\nIn conclusion, a series of novel N-1 benzyl and C-5 phenyl substituted isatin derivatives were synthesized and tested for their in vitro antitumor activity against two strains of cancer cell lines (human leukemia K562 cells and liver cancer HepG2 cells). Among them, compounds 2m exhibited excellent cancer inhibitory activity in vitro against K562 cell lines (IC 50 \u00bc 0.03 mM) and HepG2 cell lines (IC 50 \u00bc 0.05 mM). SAR analysis showed that the carbonyl group of the isatin, N-benzyl and C-5 phenyl substituted pattern, the paramethoxyl group of the benzyl played a significant role in the antitumor activity.\n\nBoth morphological results and flow cytometry analysis showed Table 3 In vitro antitumor activities of compounds 3a-3c.\n\nPosition Table 4 In vitro antitumor activities of compounds 4a-4r. 2-thiophenyl 0.08 \u00b1 0.04 3.67 \u00b1 1.40 Table 5 Antitumor activity of the C-3 derivatized compounds 5a-5k.\n\nthat compound 2m induce apoptosis and cause cell cycle arrest in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, wound healing and transwell experiments showed that compound 2m could inhibit the migration and repair ability of HepG2 cells. In addition, the results of cell tube formation showed that the compound 2m could inhibit the angiogenesis of HUVEC cells and has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect. The effects of indole derivative compound 2m on tumor cell growth, migration and angiogenesis were studied, which provide a strong foundation for further study on the antitumor activity and mechanism of indole compounds.\n\nAll reagents and solvents used in this paper were of reagent grade, were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-400 NMR spectrometer (Billerica, Middlesex, MA, USA) in CDCl 3 or DMSO-d 6 .

For each experiment, IC 50 value was calculated from three independent assays.\n\nFor the DNA content analysis, 5 \u00c2 10 4 cells were cultured for 2 h and treated with compound 2m (30 nM, 300 nM) for 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h respectively. Cells were collected and fixed with 1 mL of 70% ice-cold ethanol at \u00c020 C overnight. Cells then were washed with PBS, incubated with propidium iodide (PI, 50 mg/mL), RNase A (100 mg/mL) and 0.2% Triton \u00c2 100 for 30 min in dark at room temperature and analyzed using a FACS Calibur system (version 2.0, BD) using the CELLQuest program (Becton Dickinson). Results were representatives of at least three independent experiments.\n\nApoptotic cells were assayed by the Annexin-V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Tianjin Sungene Biotech Co., Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. K562 cells were seeded in six-well plates and treated with DMSO or compound 2m (30 nM, 300 nM) for 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h respectively. After the treatment, cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS at 2500 rpm and resuspended in 1 \u00c2 Binding buffer. Then, the cells were stained with 5 ml of Annexin-V-FITC for 10 min and 5 ml of PI (50 mg/mL) for 10 min at room temperature in dark and analyzed by flow cytometry. The fraction of cell population in different quadrants was analyzed using quadrant statistics.\n\nWound healing assay was performed to determine migration rate and repair ability of HepG2 cells. The HepG2 cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 2 \u00c2 10 5 cells/well and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 24 h incubation, the cultured cells grew against the wall of 6-well plates. Then, the HepG2 cells were scratched with a 10 ml pipette tip to make a straight line on the HepG2 cells. The medium in the well was removed and the well of the HepG2 cells was washed for three times by 1 \u00c2 PBS. The cells were treated with DMSO or compound 2m (10 nM, 30 nM, 100 nM) for 0, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h respectively, and incubated at 37 C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Images of the HepG2 cells were got by a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nThe transwell assay of HepG2 cells was performed using 24-well culture plates containing polycarbonate filter inserts (EMD Millipore corporation, Germany). The HepG2 cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum and 200 ml (2 \u00c2 10 5 cells/well) were added to the upper compartment of the chamber. 600 ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the lower chamber. After 30 min, the cells were treated with DMSO or compound 2m (10 nM, 30 nM, 100 nM) for 24 h and incubated in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 C. After 24 h, medium in the chamber was removed and the well of the HepG2 cells was washed for three times by 1 \u00c2 PBS. Then, use the methanol as fixative and DAPI as stain. HepG2 cells on the upper side of the filter were removed using cotton swabs. The photographs of three horizons were taken in random. The migrated HepG2 cells to the lower side of the filter were counted.\n\nThe capillary-like network formation of HUVEC cells was investigated with Matrigel-coated 96-well culture plates [17] . Matrigel (13.9 mg/mL; BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) was thawed at 4 C. Fifty microliters of the Matrigel was added to each well of the 24-well culture plates and incubated for 30 min at 37 C for polymerization. The HUVEC cells (1 \u00c2 10 5 cells/well) were suspended in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS, and were then added to the Matrigel-coated wells. After 40 min incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 atmosphere, added DMSO or compound 2m (10 nM, 30 nM, 100 nM) to the cells. Then, the plates were incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 12 h incubation, the capillary-like tube formation in each well of the culture plates was photographed by a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). the online version, at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.07.032.
