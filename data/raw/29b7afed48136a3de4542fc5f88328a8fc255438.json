However, our understanding of how this virus adapts to new species remains unclear. Letko et al. experimentally observe several different routes in the stepwise, adaptive evolution of MERS-CoV to a unique host-species variant of the viral receptor.\n\nSince its discovery in 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected over 2,000 people and has a mortality rate of approximately 35% (World Health Organization, 2018WHO; Zaki et al., 2012) . The ancestral host species of MERS-CoV remains elusive; however, mounting evidence suggests that the virus most likely originated in bats and passed to humans through multiple zoonotic spill-over events from dromedary camels (Azhar et al., 2014; Haagmans et al., 2014; Ithete et al., 2013; Woo et al., 2012) . While species capable of supporting MERS-CoV infection have been studied, the genetic mechanisms underlying cross-species adaptation remain poorly understood.\n\nA primary determinant of viral species-tropism is at the level of host cell entry, which is mediated by MERS-CoV spike protein binding host dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (Ohnuma et al., 2013; Raj et al., 2013) . Structural studies have shown that this interaction relies on multiple contact points (Lu et al., 2013; Song et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013) . Our group has previously demonstrated that hamster DPP4 contains variation in these contact points, which prevents MERS-CoV replication (van van Doremalen et al., 2016) . Other genetic variation responsible for the glycosylation of DPP4 in mice, hamsters, ferrets, and guinea pigs forms an additional block to the interaction with MERS-CoV spike (Cockrell et al., 2014; Peck et al., 2017) . In contrast to small rodents and ferrets, MERS-CoV is capable of utilizing DPP4 from different bat species, and Artibeus jamaicensis bats have been shown to support experimental infection (Ca\u00ec et al., 2014; Munster et al., 2016) .\n\nHere, we investigated the host breadth and adaptability of MERS-CoV. We demonstrate that MERS-CoV can use DPP4 from a diverse range of bat species and can rapidly adapt to variation in DPP4.\n\nWe selected 16 bat species representing a broad taxonomic and geographic distribution to screen for MERS-CoV entry (Figures 1A, S1, and S2). Plasmids encoding the bat DPP4s were transfected into Baby Hamster Kidney fibroblasts (BHK) cells, which are non-permissive to MERS-CoV infection . All DPP4s supported viral replication to varying degrees; however, Desmodus rotundus DPP4 (drDPP4) was the least permissive to viral replication ( Figure 1B) . Flow cytometry showed that DPP4 surface expression varied between species but did not correlate with infectivity ( Figure S3A ). While this may result from variation in antibody recognition, to date, no commercially available DPP4 antibody recognizes an epitope that is conserved across all species.\n\nRelative to human DPP4, the bat DPP4s contained variation throughout the whole spike-binding region ( Figure S3B ). However, within the residues, which specifically bind MERS-CoV spike, drDPP4 only differed from human DPP4 in two amino acids at positions 295 and 317 ( Figures 1C, 1D , and S3B) . As drDPP4 was also unique at position 317 (R317Q), we chose to focus on drDPP4. Introducing drDPP4 mutations into human DPP4 reduced viral replication, while mutating drDPP4 to match the amino acids in human DPP4 increased its ability to support MERS-CoV replication ( Figure 1E ). These data show that residues 295 and 317 largely determine resistance of drDPP4 to MERS-CoV replication.\n\nViral Adaptation of MERS-CoV to Desmodus Rotundus DPP4 As only two drDPP4 residues influenced MERS-CoV replication, we hypothesized that viral spike may be able to adapt to this vari-ation. To test this, we generated BHK cell lines that stably expressed human DPP4, drDPP4, or blue fluorescent protein (BFP; a negative control) from a lentiviral expression cassette that also included a fluorescent reporter, mCherry, as well as a puromycin selection gene ( Figure 2A ). These genes were separated by 2A sequences, which allowed for all three to express under the human Ef1a promoter (Letko et al., 2015) . Flow cytometry for mCherry and DPP4 confirmed similar transduction efficiency and transgene expression levels, respectively, between human and drDPP4 cell lines ( Figure 2B ). Cells expressing drDPP4 were less susceptible than human DPP4 to MERS-CoV infection, similar to our transfection experiments ( Figure 2C ).\n\nWild-type (WT) MERS-CoV was serially passaged, in triplicate, on these DPP4 and control cell lines. While human DPP4 cells showed cytopathic effects (CPE) from the first passage, drDPP4 cells only showed CPE after eight passages, indicative of viral adaptation ( Figure 2D ). Sanger sequencing of the MERS-CoV spike receptor binding domain (RBD) revealed the emergence of several mutations with the drDPP4 cell cultures ( Figure 2E ). By the fifth passage, spike S465F emerged in two replicates, and spike D510H emerged in one replicate ( Figure 2F ). By passage 8, one S465F mutant acquired a secondary D510G mutation, and on passage 12, the D510H mutant acquired a secondary S465F mutation ( Figure 2F ). We sequenced the spike RBD from 14 passages, as well as full-length spike from passages 3, 6, and 9, but did not observe additional mutations. No spike mutations were observed with the human DPP4 or control cell lines, indicating that these mutations were specific for drDPP4 and not the BHK cells themselves. Spike residues 465 and 510 are located within the RBD and interface with DPP4 ( Figures  2G and 2H) . Notably, spike residue 510 clusters with DPP4 residues 295 and 317 and directly interacts with DPP4 residue 317 ( Figure 2H ) . MERS spike 465S and 510D are found in the majority of published spike sequences ( Figure S4A ).\n\nHuman and drDPP4 are 83.8% similar at the amino acid level and both function as the receptor for MERS-CoV, suggesting the two proteins share a common structure. Therefore, we used struc-tural data for human DPP4 to predict the structure of drDPP4. Electrostatic potential analysis showed a positive surface charge of human DPP4 at residues 295 and 317 and a negative charge at these positions in drDPP4 ( Figure 3A ). Complementary to human DPP4, the WT MERS-CoV spike RBD is negatively charged (Figure 3B ). This analysis revealed that the spike adaptations altered the surface charge of spike from negative to positive, complementing the negative charge of drDPP4 ( Figure 3C ).\n\nBecause we only sequenced MERS-CoV spike, it remained possible that other mutations arose in the viral genome that increased viral replication in the drDPP4 cells. Therefore, we generated spike point mutant viruses, which failed to grow on control transduced cells but grew to similar levels as WT virus and induced CPE in the human DPP4 cells (Figures 3D and  S4B ). In contrast, WT virus replicated to lower titers than the spike mutants and failed to induce CPE in drDPP4 cells ( Figures  3D and S4B ). Next, we performed an entry assay with spikepseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles expressing luciferase. While all spike mutations slightly increased entry over WT spike on human DPP4 cells, there was a striking increase in entry with drDPP4 cells ( Figure 3E ). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that adaptation in MERS-CoV spike enhanced viral replication on drDPP4 cells through increased viral entry.\n\nWe transfected cells with a subset of the bat DPP4 panel and then infected with spike mutant viruses, all of which replicated better than WT virus on cells expressing drDPP4 (Figure 4 ). While some mutants performed better than WT virus on cells expressing other bat DPP4s, there was not a consistent top-performing mutant. Notably, spike-510H only replicated better than WT virus with drDPP4 and not the other bat DPP4s, suggesting that this mutation is specific for drDPP4.\n\nWhile numerous studies have shown that MERS-CoV can infect several different species, our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying cross species spillover remains unclear (Adney et al., 2014; Agrawal et al., 2015; Here, we investigated species promiscuity and adaptability of MERS-CoV.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that MERS-CoV entry is less efficient with DPP4 from pipistrelle bats compared to human DPP4 (Barlan et al., 2014; Raj et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014) . This difference in receptor efficiency was used to suggest that MERS-CoV spike adapted away from using bat DPP4 as it adapted to human DPP4. While our data confirm this replication phenotype with Pipistrellus DPP4, we showed that DPP4 from several other bat species supported MERS-CoV replication comparable to or better than human DPP4 ( Figure 1B) . Thus, without more evidence as to the true ancestral host of MERS-CoV, conclusions regarding spike adaptation away from bats should be more reserved. This finding also highlights the importance of screening a broad selection of species when assessing host breadth.\n\nA. planirostris and A. jamaicensis DPP4s are identical to human DPP4 at the 14 contact points with spike but differed in their ability to support MERS-CoV replication ( Figure 1B) . Notably, these two bat DPP4 sequences varied from human DPP4 and from each other at other positions in the receptor binding domain ( Figure S3B ), suggesting that additional DPP4 residues can influence the interaction with spike. Forced adaptation of MERS-CoV spike has been a challenge in the field as DPP4 from most non-permissive species contains glycosylation that completely abrogates the interaction and blocks infection (Cockrell et al., 2014; Peck et al., 2015; Peck et al., 2017) . Without viral replication, it has not been possible to experimentally demonstrate evolution of the MERS-CoV spike. We found that drDPP4 was only semipermissive to viral infection and, therefore, served as a tool to test MERS-CoV spike adaptation in vitro (Figures 1 and 2) . Within three passages on cells expressing drDPP4, MERS-CoV accumulated mutations in the receptor-binding domain of spike that enhanced viral entry and replication specifically with drDPP4 and not the other bat DPP4s (Figures 2, 3, and 4). The prevalence of these adaptation mutations is low in published sequences, further suggesting that they are specific for drDPP4 ( Figure S4A ). Taken together, MERS-CoV spike is likely adaptable to any DPP4 variation that does not completely ablate the interaction.\n\nAt least 14 contact points have been identified in crystal structures of human DPP4 and MERS-CoV spike . drDPP4 contains variation within and around these known points ( Figure S3B) . Therefore, the spike-465F mutation, which is just outside of the interface, may lead to broader structural adjustments that favor interaction with drDPP4 ( Figure 2H ). Surprisingly, the adaptation mutations had very little effect on the interaction with human DPP4, suggesting that other contact points could compensate for this variation (Figure 3 ). For example, spike residue 510 has been shown to contact DPP4 residue 322 in addition to 317, so it may be possible that this interaction is retained with human DPP4 . Structural studies are needed to fully define how these spike mutations influence the interface with DPP4.\n\nOur viral adaptation experiments revealed mutations in MERS-CoV spike, which altered the surface charge to complement the opposite charge of drDPP4 ( Figure 3C ). Interestingly, these mutations share a striking similarity to species adaptations identified in SARS-CoV spike (as reviewed in Li, 2013) . The ability to rapidly adjust surface charge may be a general property of MERS-CoV spike to facilitate cross-species adaptation. However, animal studies are needed to see if the mutations we described here affect other viral phenotypes, including host immune evasion.\n\nPrevious work has assessed coronavirus spike adaptation to orthologous host receptors (Baric et al., 1999; McRoy and Baric, 2008; Roberts et al., 2007; Sheahan et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2012) . These studies characterized viruses after passage in animals, long-term cell culture, or performed biochemical analysis on spike variations from different isolates. As these experiments only focused on the viral endpoint, they failed to capture the continuous evolution through viral passages. Thus, the exact speed and order in which mutations arise in response to receptors from non-cognate species remain unclear in these studies. The work we present here demonstrates that MERS-CoV rapidly adapts to DPP4 variation and can do so utilizing different mutation paths. While D. rotundus is not known to be a host species for MERS-CoV, the use of its semi-permissive DPP4 allowed us to observe, with high temporal resolution, species adaptation of MERS-CoV. All together, these findings shed light on the evolutionary mechanisms underlying MERS-CoV cross-species transmission.\n\nAll work with infectious MERS-CoV was approved by the Rocky Mountain Laboratories Institutional Biosafety Committee and performed under biosafety level 3 conditions.\n\ncDNA from E. buettikoferi and R. aegyptiacus were derived from the EpoNi/22.1 and RE06 cell lines, respectively. cDNA was produced from A. planirostris, C. perspicillata, and S. bilineata primary lung tissue and H. gigas heart tissue, provided by Dr. Tony Schountz.
