{"title": "Seasonality, ambient temperatures and hospitalizations for acute exacerbation of COPD: a population-based study in a metropolitan area", "body": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases and is associated with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Given that the prevalence of COPD increases with age, the perspective is that the impact of the disease will continue to increase in the near future. According to the World Health Organization, in 2005, COPD affected 210 million people, of whom 3 million died from the disease.1 More recently, the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated that, in 2010, COPD was the third leading cause of death globally and ninth in disability-adjusted life years.2,3\n\nA great part of this mortality in COPD occurs during exacerbations and the subsequent weeks, especially in patients hospitalized for severe exacerbations.4,5 Recent studies show that up to one third of patients with COPD require hospitalization for exacerbation of their disease over a period of 3 years.6 In addition, these hospitalizations generate the majority of health care costs and cause a significant deterioration in quality of life for affected patients.6,7 Factors associated with an increased risk of hospitalization include a prior history of admissions for COPD exacerbation, older age, severe pulmonary functional impairment, and the presence of comorbidities.6,8\u201311\n\nRecently, two publications based on data obtained in the TORCH and POET trials, (two large international studies involving over 13,000 patients) investigated the relationship between exacerbations and seasonality, and confirmed an increase in exacerbations during the winter months along with an increase in hospitalizations, although this association was not observed in the tropics.12,13 Both studies were performed by comparing seasons, and therefore only indirectly dealt with temperatures. There are few studies directly assessing the influence of temperature in exacerbations of COPD, especially in more severe cases, such as those requiring hospitalization.\n\nThe aim of our study was to assess the influence of temperature on the number of hospital admissions for COPD exacerbation in a well-defined geographic area and to assess the influence of humidity, comorbidity, influenza-like illness, and air pollution on these hospitalizations.\n\nContinuous variables are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation while categorical variables are described by absolute and relative frequencies. Means among seasons were compared using the Welch robust test. Fisher\u2019s Exact test of proportions was used to compare the influence of different factors on the proportion of hospitalizations. Simple and multivariate linear regression models were used to investigate the relationship between the different variables (measured in weekly means) and the total number of weekly hospital admissions for COPD. Multicollinearity of the multivariate models was checked using Durbin-Watson tests. The real shape of the model was previously investigated by a general additive model. The determination coefficient was used to measure the quality of the models. P-values below 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. All calculations were performed with the R.2.10 free software package (www.r-project.org).\n\nDuring the year 2009, a total of 967,241 discharges from Catalonian hospitals were recorded, of which 18,548 (1.9%) had acute exacerbation of COPD as the main diagnosis. The average age of patients hospitalized for COPD was 74.5\u00b111.4 years, with 77.3% being male and the average hospital stay being 7.1\u00b16.6 days. Of these admissions, 9,804 (53.2%) were in Barcelona and its metropolitan area. The number of weekly hospitalizations ranged between 89 and 459, with an average of 188.5\u00b180.2 and a median of 174. Again, these patients were predominantly male (75.4%) with a mean age of 74.9\u00b110.5 years and an average stay of 6.5\u00b16.1 days. Differences in sex, age, and length of stay between total COPD admissions in Catalonia and the study sample were statistically significant (all P<0.001) but clinically irrelevant except for the average length of stay.\n\nThe highest number of admissions occurred during the winter, with 3,689 (37.6%) hospitalizations, followed by autumn with 2,353 (24.0%), spring with 2,328 (23.7%), and summer with 1,434 (14.6%; P<0.001, see Figure 1). The population and climate characteristics and their analysis grouped by seasonality are detailed in Table 1.\n\nThe observed mortality during hospitalization was 3.2%, being higher in the summer months (P=0.050). The most frequent comorbidities recorded were hypertension (43.6%), psychiatric disorders including anxiety and/or depression (42.0%), heart failure (32.8%), ischemic heart disease (28.3%), and diabetes mellitus (28.0%). The total number of comorbidities was lower during the winter months than in the rest of the year (P<0.001), although no difference was seen in the Deyo-Charlson Index (Table 1).\n\nThe mean annual maximum temperature was 19.7\u00b0C\u00b1 6.6\u00b0C with a maximum of 34.5\u00b0C, while the mean of the minimum temperatures was 8.5\u00b0C\u00b15.7\u00b0C with a minimum of 0.0\u00b0C. The values of the mean daily temperatures ranged between 3.8\u00b0C and 27\u00b0C, with a mean value of 13.7\u00b0C\u00b1 6.2\u00b0C and an interquartile range (25%\u201375%) between 9.6\u00b0C and 19.2\u00b0C. The maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures were closely and similarly related with the number of hospitalizations (Figure 2). On average, in an unadjusted model we found that for each Celsius degree decrease in mean weekly temperature, hospital admissions increased by 5.04% (r2=0.591, P<0.001, see Figures 3 and 4).\n\nDespite being located in the same geographic area, as with other densely populated cities, temperatures in Barcelona were slightly higher than in the metropolitan area (urban heat island effect), varying a few degrees depending on the location of the meteorological station. However, we did not find differences between the pattern of temperature and hospitalizations between Barcelona city and its metropolitan area (P=0.08, Figure 5).\n\nThe percent humidity was also significantly associated with the number of hospital admissions (P=0.002), although this effect disappeared after adjustment in the multivariate model (P=0.723).\n\nDuring 2009, the new influenza virus A (H1N1) pandemic was present, with two peaks of incidence in the influenza rate between the first and third week and later between weeks 41 and 47 of the year. The number of outpatient consultations and home visits for influenza-like illness increased in the same weeks, so both were significantly more frequent in the autumn than in the other seasons (P<0.001, see Table 1). Overall, the influenza rate slightly increased the number of admissions but without statistical significance (P=0.052), even after adjusting for temperature (P=0.444).\n\nTo study the possible relationship between air pollution and number of hospital admissions, the highest level of pollution, expressed by mean weekly values (Catalonian Air Quality Index) was used. Over the year, the mean score obtained on the Catalonian Air Quality Index scale was 42.5\u00b110.2, which, according to the scale detailed in the methods, corresponded to an acceptable air quality. When stratifying according to the air quality scale, 858 (8.8%) admissions occurred in weeks in which air quality was considered low (more pollution), 6,481 (66.1%) during weeks when it was estimated as acceptable, and 2,645 (26.1%) during periods when it was rated as satisfactory (less pollution). Weeks of pollution coincided with higher temperatures, although no significant differences were found between air pollution and number of hospital admissions (P=0.887).\n\nIn multivariate analysis, after adjustment for humidity, comorbidity, air pollution, and influenza rate, only mean temperatures retained statistical significance, with a mean increase of 4.70% weekly admissions for each Celsius degree decrease (r2=0.599, P<0.001, see Tables 2 and 3).\n\nThe main conclusion of our study is the independent relationship between ambient temperature and number of hospital admissions for exacerbation of COPD, regardless of humidity, influenza rate, comorbidity, or environmental pollution. Although the increase in COPD exacerbations and the higher number of hospital admissions during the winter season have been well known for years, the relationship with ambient temperature has scarcely been studied, and with contradictory conclusions.18 To the best of our knowledge, direct evidence of the relationship between temperature and hospitalizations is scarce.\n\nMost epidemiological studies exploring the influence of temperature on cardiorespiratory diseases have focused mainly on the effect of heat. For example, a recent meta-analysis concerning the relationship between climate and cardiorespiratory morbidity found only three studies that examined the effect of cold in these pathologies.19 In another study performed in Copenhagen, the authors found a higher prevalence of hospitalizations for respiratory causes in the warmest months.20 These data are similar to a Canadian study that found an association between colder temperatures and cardiovascular diseases but not with respiratory diseases.21\n\nIn contrast, studies that have specifically analyzed COPD exacerbations show that numbers increase in the winter months, including the number of hospitalizations for exacerbation of COPD.22 Recently, two publications based on the TORCH and POET trials indicated that the numbers of COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations in winter were almost double those in summer, which is in agreement with our study. Regrettably, both studies were only able to perform the analysis stratified by month and seasonality, and therefore only indirectly considered ambient temperature, due to a lack of climate data analysis.12,13\n\nThere are very few studies about the role of temperature in the number and severity of COPD exacerbations. A study performed in Bavaria, Germany, showed an increase of 1% in outpatient visits for COPD for each Fahrenheit degree decrease.23 These results are similar to those of two other studies done in Taiwan, which found an increase of 0.8% in outpatient consultations for COPD exacerbations for each 1\u00b0C decrease in temperature and an increment of emergency room consultations in the colder months.24,25 Our data yield similar conclusions in a different climate and with more severe exacerbations, since it is centered on hospital admissions. Finally, a population-based study in Scotland confirmed an increase in hospital admissions for COPD with a decrease in monthly temperatures, especially in groups of lower socioeconomic status.26 Other studies link diurnal temperature range with emergency room visits for cardiovascular disease or mortality from COPD.27\u201330\n\nThe reasons for the increase in exacerbations with cold temperatures are complex and not entirely elucidated. The most plausible explanation is that the increase in viral infections acts as a trigger for exacerbation. It is well known that virus alone or associated with bacterial infection is present in around two thirds of COPD exacerbations. The most common virus is the human rhinovirus causing the common cold, which can be found in more than 50% of exacerbations, followed by respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and others.30,31 Viral infections lead to increased basal inflammation being present in the airways of patients with COPD.34\n\nMost respiratory viral infections in the northern and southern regions of the world have a seasonal pattern not observed in the tropics, and they have been associated with low temperatures, humidity, variations in patient physiology, and changes in social behavior.30 These respiratory infections are more common in winter, both in COPD patients and in the general population, and occur in a wide range of climates, being more closely related to temperature variations than to absolute temperatures. Recent research suggests that human rhinovirus infections, at least in children, are more severe in winter.34 Another possible explanation for the increased number of hospitalizations for COPD in winter is the decline in lung function with the cold, and the increased airway inflammation and longer duration of exacerbation experienced by COPD patients with decreasing temperatures.35\u201338\n\nOur study confirms the low impact of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 on the number of hospitalizations for COPD. The pandemic in 2009 affected predominantly the young population, probably because of residual immunity in the elderly from previous antigenically similar virus exposure.39 Only 10% of patients hospitalized for influenza A in Catalonia in 2009 had a diagnosis of COPD.15\n\nOther factors associated with an increase in COPD exacerbations in some studies are low humidity and higher air pollution levels, although their role appears less relevant than that of falling temperatures, and in our study their significance disappeared after adjustment for temperature.23,30,31,40\u201342\n\nOur study has some limitations. First, the collected data about the number of COPD admissions were based on hospital discharge codes, so we cannot rule out errors inherent in coding or data not collected with the etiology of the exacerbation. The definition of discharge codes based on ICD-9 is used in all previous studies using this methodology and their accuracy has been validated in several studies.43,44 This limitation is common to all studies performed with the same methodology, and is partially compensated for by the large sample size.5 Additionally, our population was very similar in terms of sex, age, and length of stay to that reported in prospective cohort studies conducted in the same area.10,45\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates an independent relationship between ambient temperature and the number of hospital admissions for COPD exacerbation even after adjustment for humidity, comorbidity, influenza syndromes, and air pollution."}
