{"title": "Southeast Asian cooperation in health: a comparative perspective on regional health governance in ASEAN and the EU", "body": "In the section on \u201cResearch Methodology\u201d, we highlight the potential of ASEAN for horizontal and vertical integration; working towards the convergence of health systems among its ten member states. What are the specific mechanisms for health improvement in ASEAN? What is ASEAN\u2019s modus operandi for health policy making and subsequently, how may those mechanisms be improved to build capacity and enhance cooperation for health among and within ASEAN\u2019s ten member states (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam). In sum, we look into ASEAN\u2019s potential for increased systematic cooperation within a complex world order (Rosenau 1992). ASEAN, as a young regional institution, experiences a certain degree of resistance from member states towards regional governance reforms that might impede on their sovereignty (Fidler 2007). Nevertheless, this regional body has a moral obligation to support the international framework for health improvement and this support may come in the form of an open method of coordination. For the Southeast Asian context, such a method of cooperation might be a good way to work around a rigid decision-making process.\n\nASEAN is faced with important health challenges due to demographic and epidemiological transitions of the region, and the double burden of diseases typically present in developing countries with a continuous threat of infectious diseases or the growing needs of chronic diseases. Globalization has affected working environments and consumption patterns leading to changes in lifestyles and well-being. Additionally, climate change along with recurrent natural disasters pose major health threats to the region. The main obstacle to health cooperation in Southeast Asia lies in the economic, cultural, and political differences between its ten member states. To overcome these disparities and tackle common health challenges as collective, Southeast Asian nations must look beyond national policy and towards the potential of ASEAN as a regional institution. Health is still largely considered as a national concern that is related to domestic issues. However, there is relevant scope for regional intervention to achieve common standards, as in the form of training and capacity building of health policy makers or the health workforce.\n\nThe conventional \u201cASEAN Way\u201d has caused the decision-making process to be often slow, and highly politicized. The primacy of national sovereignty, the prevalence of national interests over the common good, and the culture of rule by consensus have been the main limitations to collective action among ASEAN nation states. With regards to the ratification of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) for example, Indonesia continuously refuses to sign the convention due to the high revenues generated from taxes on tobacco and the close cooperation between the Indonesian government and multinational tobacco companies. This causes the whole region to lag behind in tobacco control. To overcome this prevalence of national interests over the common good which acts as a limitation to ASEAN\u2019s involvement in health improvement, member states must be prepared to pool their sovereignties further regarding health interests\u2014hence, pushing the movement for regional integration forward.\n\nThe SARS epidemic (2003) was a turning point for ASEAN\u2019s involvement for health in the region. The common threat of a potential epidemic forced ASEAN member states to cooperate on cross-border surveillance and screening procedures, for example. Despite the continuous lack of infrastructure in terms of EID control, the response to SARS has had positive implications for the development of regional policy making in health. The series agreements and declarations at the ASEAN level (such as the Joint Declaration of the Special ASEAN Leaders Meeting on SARS 2003) testify ASEAN\u2019s intention to strengthen cooperation to curb the SARS epidemic and subsequently the H5N1 epidemic (leading to the Declaration of the 8th ASEAN Health Ministers Meeting; \u201cASEAN Unity in Health Emergencies\u201d 2006)\n\nThe ASEAN Charter of 2007 granted ASEAN with a legal personality\n1 and greater legitimacy as a global actor. The charter redefines ASEAN institutions and instigates a rule-based approach to policy making, allowing for more systematic planning in all policy fields. The Charter created an ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) pillar focusing on health as well as the environment, education, welfare, and development. Among these new priorities, ASEAN seeks to \u201cenhance the well-being and livelihood of the peoples of ASEAN by providing them with equitable access to opportunities for human development, social welfare and justice\u201d (Tran 2011) striving towards the creation of an ASEAN Community by 2015. This is a clear sign of ASEAN\u2019s progressive involvement in health governance for the region whereby it recognizes that the region\u2019s capacity for development depends first and foremost on a healthy community achieved through collective effort. The ASCC blueprint establishes a strategic framework on health and development (2010\u20132015) to guide action in health governance and focuses on access to adequate and affordable healthcare, medical services and medicines, and promotion of healthy lifestyles. It seeks to improve the capability to control communicable diseases and pays a new attention to food quality control. The birth of the ASCC pillar and blueprint create the potential for a more integrative health governance framework in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, the current structure of cooperation and governance in health for Southeast Asia remains an emergent policy space that has not reached a stable institutional profile (Bradford and Linn 2007). It is challenging at this stage to track clear policy responses with nation states that reflect the blueprint recommendations directly.\n\nThe ASCC pillar and its blueprint gave rise to a small Health and Communicable Diseases Division, currently consisting of five employees including the head, one senior officer, two technical officers, and one secretary. This is a first sign of institutionalized cooperation for health improvement in Southeast Asia. At the present stage however, the Health Division is understaffed to tackle all the priorities listed under the blueprint. It is apparent that to increase ASEAN\u2019s capacity to govern health for the region, this Health Division would need more human resources.\n\nThe ASEAN Health Ministers\u2019 Meetings (AHMM) is an important mechanism for high-level decision making on the priorities for health improvement in ASEAN. These meetings are preceded by Senior Officials Meetings (SOM) which oversees the operational decision-making processes for health policy making. SOMs are prepared through the advisory work of numerous technical working groups that identify the evidence-based health priorities for the region. ASEAN\u2019s ability to guide regional action on health matters is thus limited by a decision-making process that is highly compartmentalized and bureaucratic. Furthermore, the long lapses of time between each stage of the decision-making process highly compromise its efficiency. Nevertheless, we may note that AHMMs have led to numerous declarations on health since the early 1980s. After the SARS epidemic, health was acknowledged by ASEAN as an essential element in promoting social development.\n\nAs early as 2002, ASEAN put together a \u201cHealthy ASEAN 2020\u201d vision and established a Regional Action Plan on healthy Lifestyles 2020, promoting the improvement of social determinants of health (Association of Southeast Asian Nations 2002). This first strategy aims to establish a number of relevant regional mechanisms for governance in health such as high-level policy forums, a network of exchange in expertise, partnerships for technical capacity improvement, the involvement of the educational sector for health literacy, as well as multisector engagements to secure the determinants of health (Association of Southeast Asian Nations 2002). This regional action plan mentions the establishment of leadership development programs, for key government and nongovernmental bodies, built around needs that are relevant to the ASEAN Member Countries (Association of Southeast Asian Nations 2002) and to develop capacity for health governance among member states.\n\nThis regional action plan also calls for more intersectoral links between departments of ASEAN in labor, economic or cultural cooperation, thus gearing internal governance towards dealing with global health challenges at large. This recommendation is reflected with the new structure of the ASEAN sociocultural community pillar, whereby the health division is placed under the umbrella of the Cross-Sectoral Cooperation Directorate. This suggests that solution to health threats must be solved in parallel to other areas of attention under the sociocultural community pillar of ASEAN namely social and education policy, environmental sustainability, and disaster management. While the declarations that emanate from ASEAN official meetings are not legally binding, they do bear a lot of political pressure on the ten member states. The regional action plan as an example of a nonbinding cross-cutting strategy thus calls for the establishment of relevant mechanisms for GHG, encouraging an open method for cooperation.\n\nThe main limitation to cooperation for health is a lack of economic commitment and thus resources for ASEAN to act on its ASCC blueprint and priorities in health. This lack of economic resources ultimately stems from a lack of political commitment to tackle health threats as a collective. In order to solve the collective action problem and achieve the best outcome for health development across the ten member states, ASEAN must adopt a method of negotiation and policy making that is adapted to the ASEAN leaders\u2019 attachments to sovereignty and rule-by-consensus. Through an open method of coordination, \u201cthe objective is not to prescribe uniform rules or to deliver policy outcomes. Instead, it organises a learning process in order to promote the exchange of experiences and best practices\u201d (Regent 2003). By promoting dialog on policy making as a first step, it might be possible to convince and pressure countries such as Indonesia to ratify the FCTC and abide by tobacco control measures.\n\nIn order to achieve a higher level of horizontal integration, the ASEAN community must allow more regional integration altogether. To achieve a greater level of health equity and work to reduce the disparities in health status between the lower-income countries including the countries Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar and the other six ASEAN members, capacity building and a political commitment to help one\u2019s neighbor will be essential.\n\nASEAN member states must shift their understanding of health threats from a security issue to a global public good. As Kaul, Grundberg, and Stern explain, public goods are understood as non-excludable and nonrival. In other words, no one can be stopped from consuming \u201cbetter health\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d can be consumed by many without being depleted (Bettcher and Lee 2002)\u2014legal frameworks such as the FCTC or even immunization programs and epidemic surveillance are all intermediate public goods that aim to achieve one final public good: improved health for all (Bettcher and Lee 2002). Ultimately, pooling resources and working towards further cooperation will serve to guarantee this intermediate public good for the ASEAN community. By promoting further dialog and working towards a common ASEAN Strategy for Health Improvement in line with the ASCC blueprint\u2014ASEAN could pool resources that might be redirected towards countries in greater need and accompanied by effective training and capacity-building programs. The establishment of an ASEAN training center for capacity building might be yet another efficient mechanism for the harmonization of health systems across ASEAN.\n\nAnother challenge for ASEAN is the quality of data collection and analysis. A centralized data collection system such as a Health Metrics Network (Waldman 2007) would be of great support to an ASEAN health governance framework. This initiative might be possible by pooling ASEAN member states\u2019 resources and creating a centralized data collection system\u2014but also by relying further on the help of civil society organizations\u2014as we will see in the next subsection.\n\nAside from improving horizontal mechanisms for regional cooperation in health, we must analyze ASEAN\u2019s potential to support a wider framework of cooperation for health governance\u2014in cooperation with WHO and CSOs at large\u2014a process of vertical integration.\n\nThe World Health Organization as the specialized technical agency of the United Nations for health has often been considered as the leader in global health policy (Waldman 2007). Yet its capacity to act has been largely reduced to its inefficient and bureaucratic structure. In addition to well-needed reforms, it is essential for WHO to build upon partnerships between the regional and country offices of the WHO. In the case of Southeast Asia, ASEAN and WHO work on a very ad hoc cooperation structure. The rare cooperation between both structures translates into WHO representatives\u2019 participation at the yearly ASEAN preparatory meetings to the AHMM as well as at the ASEAN Regional Forum. There are noticeable instances of cooperation between both institutions through emergency response programs such as during the H5N1 epidemic. Furthermore, ASEAN is part of the WHO Pacific Strategy for emerging infectious diseases (World Health Organisation Western Pacific Office 2005). This ad hoc cooperation structure, however, does not extend substantively beyond the emergency of an epidemic. There is no long-term cooperation mechanism in place between ASEAN and WHO regional offices.\n\nThe first limitation to an institutionalized cooperation is the fact that ASEAN member states are split between the regional offices of WHO South-East Asia Regional Office (SEARO) and WHO WPRO. This structural disadvantage does not set the right context for continuous and structured dialog. An institutionalized form of cooperation, however, might be useful in preventing the duplication of health programs at the regional level; it would also contribute to the effective use of technical resources and expertise through a more constant channel of knowledge sharing. Both institutions could benefit from an institutionalized cooperation as they are complementary in nature. At the EU level for example, WHO provides the credibility of the content while Directorate General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) provides the tools by monitoring implementation through close scrutiny on national action and implementation plans. ASEAN, as an intergovernmental body, has the necessary tools to stir political commitment among its ten member states. Furthermore, ASEAN possesses the cross-sectoral value of a diplomatic entity with direct contact with all sectors of government in its member states, as well as with CSOs and the private sector. As a regional intergovernmental institution, it is a better candidate for identifying the specific needs of the Southeast Asian people and bridging the gap between WPRO and SEARO. WHO on the other hand, could bring in the technical expertise (the medical know how and data collection capacity) that ASEAN has not yet harnessed to its full potential.\n\nThe EU experience in health cooperation at the regional level offers some material for comparison with the current situation in ASEAN. We do not, however, turn towards the EU example to take the European-level mechanisms for an absolute solution. Both institutions are at a very different level of integration. Rather, we examine the EU structure to understand what may be useful to ASEAN. Another apparent difference between the EU and ASEAN is the financial strength and the legitimacy of the EU as a sui generis organization. The EU has reached a level of regional integration which accounts for its highly developed health governance structure. Nevertheless, over the last 44 years, ASEAN has developed into less of a trade organization and into an all-encompassing institution\u2014widening its competences to other fields including health. Similarly to the European Commission, ASEAN has a role to play in ensuring the sharing of best practices, in coordinating forums for dialog and exchange of information, and in the use of statistics for harmonization of data collection across the ten member states. From our observations of the EU\u2019s partnerships for health improvement, its interactions with the WHO and its framework of cooperation with CSOs, we have highlighted various mechanisms that could feed into a Southeast Asian health governance framework.\n\nThe example of the European Commission\u2019s (EC) DG SANCO established in 1999, is a useful element for comparison with the newly established ASEAN health division. DG SANCO for example, encompasses over 120 employees working on health for Europe and representing the voice of the EU as a whole. DG SANCO\u2019s mandate is to \u201ccomplement national action on health\u201d rather than duplicate national initiatives. Developing the Health Division of ASEAN closer to the model of DG SANCO would allow the creation of specialised sections dealing with infectious disease or noncommunicable disease and also trade regulations (e.g., to deal with cases of illicit medicine trade). Such a division could oversee the creation of a stronger system of health indicators for the ASEAN community\u2014to allow for more successful harmonization of data collection and measurements, for example (European Commission, Together for Health 2007).\n\nAdditionally, to improve its potential as a leadership institution for health governance however, ASEAN could work on the development of a more general strategy for health. The EU general health strategy for example was designed to improve health security (health preparedness, health promotion) by tackling health inequalities related to social determinants of health and by disseminating health knowledge and information. The general European Health strategy works through annual priority work plans\u2014and operates through an Executive Agency for Health and Consumers. Supplementing this European strategy is the Statement on Fundamental Health Values by the EC\u2014aimed at improving the coherence of the strategy by aligning member states on a similar value system for health improvement (European Commission Together for Health 2007). As such, we may suggest that ASEAN\u2019s potential in health governance could be improved by the creation of a more complex health division, more regular SOM and AHMM meetings, as well as a more resourced executive structure working towards the implementation of a general strategy for health, and supported by an ASEAN-specific statement on health values.\n\nThe EC\u2019s Together for Health 2008\u20132013 strategy tackles the challenge of an aging population, and of continuous threats to public health security such as pandemics. It is based on the principle of shared values\u2014on access to quality healthcare and on solidarity. Such a strategy helps to improve the coherence of policy recommendations between all actors for health in the EU and works to reinforce the regional institution\u2019s role as a global actor in health governance. The \u201cTogether for Health\u201d strategy also incorporates the Health in All Policies principle which calls for more synergy between the NGO sector, the industry, academia and the media. Now that ASEAN has integrated health as one of its priorities within the ASEAN sociocultural community pillar\u2014the next step towards incorporating health as a cross-sectoral priority could be to adopt an approach similar to Health in All Policies as clear mechanisms for cross-sectoral horizontal integration. The Reform Treaty of the EU (Article 9) reinforces this initiative by categorizing public health as one of three overarching objectives for the EU. All sectors of policy making at the national and regional levels must consider public health as a prime objective\u2014from social and regional policy, to taxation policy, environment policy, education policy, and to research. This is an example of horizontal integration\u2014as it promotes a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach (Kickbush 2011)\u2014with the intent of reaching all levels of the governance spectrum. This change of approach is primordial to effective collective action.\n\nAs demonstrated through our two examples (EID and tobacco control), ASEAN could benefit from a more comprehensive health strategy. In the case of emerging infectious disease control for example, ASEAN operates through numerous frameworks and disease-specific agreements. This leads to a less coherent approach to EID control. ASEAN\u2019s political commitment in EID control is apparent through the numerous working groups and task forces that were set up over the last 10 years. However, ASEAN does not benefit from a comprehensive surveillance mechanism (Coker et al. 2011) such as the European Centre for Disease Control that coordinates EID control activities with the EU commission and WHO EURO. ASEAN\u2019s sustained capacity to prevent and combat EIDs could depend on the creation of a clearly defined health strategy for the region. With regards to tobacco control, the EU provides strong leadership through the European coordination mechanisms which draw the link between FCTC requirements, WHO EURO initiatives and EU commission activities in tobacco control. ASEAN currently operates through its focal point on tobacco control set up in 2007. However, it could benefit from a more comprehensive and integrated strategy for tobacco control, to ensure greater coherence between WHO SEARO and WPRO initiatives and national government efforts towards tobacco control. Additionally, ASEAN involvement in tobacco control could largely contribute to reducing the disparities in health status between Southeast Asian nations as tobacco-related diseases account for the highest rate of preventable deaths across the region. From a development perspective therefore, a coherent strategy for tobacco control transposing the FCTC provisions to the national level via a regional initiative is essential.\n\nAs we have seen in the first section \u201cResearch methodology\u201d, one of the main challenges for health cooperation in Southeast Asia is the lack of a coherence data collection mechanism. The Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) collaborates with the EU on Health and may be considered as the third partner for health governance in Europe along with the EC and WHO EURO. As a potential equivalent to the OECD, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) might be an interesting partner supplementing an ASEAN regional health governance framework, by supplying for example, the resources for improved surveillance. From the perspective of EID control, for example, working in closer synergy with APEC would allow ASEAN to harness the private sector stakeholders for EID control. We may note that APEC has previously worked to empower business leaders in the region by advising them on how to cope with the influenza virus through business continuity plans. This is a clear example of how APEC may supplement ASEAN\u2019s mechanism for EID control, or supplement a more general health strategy for the region in the near future.\n\nWHO and ASEAN communicate via the WHO Indonesia Country Office in Jakarta; however, from a global governance point of view, this has little potential for regional integration. The EC on the other hand, cooperates with the WHO Headquarters in Geneva and the WHO EURO office separately as both bureaus have set up an office in Brussels. Additionally, DG SANCO has a representative stationed in Geneva for continuous exchange of information and expertise. Executive Directors of both DG SANCO and WHO EURO meet twice a year in January and May to discuss priorities in health security for the region, health information and solutions to health inequalities in the EU. In order to reinforce the cooperation between ASEAN and WHO regional offices therefore, both WHO WPRO and SEARO would ideally combine efforts to support a WHO regional office or unit based at the ASEAN headquarters in Jakarta. To implement a more systematic structure of cooperation, ASEAN may choose to work towards a joint agreement with WHO WPRO and SEARO, calling for more policy dialog. In order to elaborate on a complex matrix of cooperation\u2014WHO EURO and the EC have agreed on the need to include all EU delegations and WHO country offices in EU member states as direct partners on their health programs. This is an interesting idea for ASEAN and the WHO country offices. An integrated cooperation with WHO would allow the establishment of a single integrated information system for a uniform and efficient surveillance and alert mechanism, for example. The European region is currently working on such a system which will be based on standardized definitions and methods for data collection\u2014reducing the burden of data collection on member states. This would be highly valuable to Southeast Asia to overcome inefficiencies in data surveillance.\n\nFurthermore, both WHO EURO and the EC have aligned their health strategies for improved coherence as another benefit of their cooperation for health governance. WHO EURO implements projects and general strategies that are directly in line with EU health policy. The Health 2020 Strategy established by WHO EURO at its 61st Committee Session (September 2011) presents the regional directors\u2019 proposals on the \u201cscope, vision, and values \u2026 related to the new European policy for health\u201d (WHO EURO 2011). The alignment of regional strategies for health at the ASEAN level would be a great opportunity for added coherence in health policy making for the region. Moreover, WHO EURO contributes to regional health governance for Europe through additional mechanisms such as the South Eastern European Health Network\u2014a forum for cooperation among health ministries, International Organisations and the Council of Europe to guide the reconstruction and stabilization of the East European Region and reduce disparities in health. Such networks of complex partnerships would be a useful model for Southeast Asia in the region\u2019s attempt to minimize health inequity and to provide specific help to less developed countries such as Myanmar, Lao PDR, or Cambodia.\n\nWe may illustrate the above points by drawing further recommendations from cooperation in EID control and tobacco control. WHO Global oversees the harmonization of infectious disease control and prevention tools. The FCTC and the International Health Regulations serve as a template on which WHO regional offices and regional institutions may base their region-specific strategies for infectious disease and tobacco control. Regional offices of the WHO have taken the lead in establishing region-specific technical programs to strengthen national capacity. As we can see, WHO EURO works in a tripartite partnership with the EC and the European Centre for Disease Control for EID control. It is unfortunately much more difficult to impose such a structured framework for Southeast Asia due to its divided WHO membership. Although SEARO and WPRO have joined forces through the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases\u2014ASEAN would benefit from an institutionalized center for prevention and surveillance (such as the ECDC) to facilitate cooperation between its health division and the WHO regional offices. Furthermore; WHO EURO established a European Strategy for Tobacco Control and includes the EU as a main partner for this strategy. In contrast, the Tobacco Free Initiative (TFI) by WHO WPRO only includes ASEAN and WHO SEARO as collaborators. ASEAN would benefit from having a more integrated role in a cooperation framework where ASEAN, WHO WPRO, and SEARO all work together as partners in the TFI.\n\nUltimately, ASEAN needs a stronger civil society network at the local, national, and regional levels in order to build on its potential for more regional integration in health governance. For CSOs, it is easier to influence one body representing ten member states rather than lobbying for change in ten different countries at once. The European Public Health Alliance (EPHA) for example, acts as a platform for all health CSOs to relay information to the European institutions. EPHA supports the flow of information on health promotion and public health policy developments among all players: politicians, civil servants, NGOs, stakeholders, and the public. EPHA trains, mentors, and supports NGOs and health actors to engage with the EU. This CSO platform therefore helps create the link between government and business and regional organizations. Having such a platform of CSOs would help to draw the link between health and social justice. Before such a platform can be created in Southeast Asia however, there needs to be a flourishing CSO landscape. The richness of the CSO landscape depends largely on the political structure and philosophy behind the governments of each member state. Governments of Southeast Asia have a role to play in facilitating the legal registration of CSOs in health. Developing on the CSO framework would allow governments to go beyond the complex bureaucratic and political compromises of ASEAN and to reach out to the ASEAN community more efficiently\u2014building on the ASEAN Community principle.\n\nFrom an institutionalist perspective, CSOs create the bridge between regional, global, and governmental bodies. The EC has set up various consultation mechanisms to integrate CSOs in the governance framework for heath. It organises residential seminars to promote interconnectedness between the institutions consulting with the EU and EU delegations on health policy making\u2014promoting synergy for effective implementation. Furthermore, DG SANCO organises Global Health Policy Forums once a month in Brussels for the network of CSOs to share their ideas and projects with the EC. The Civil Society Contact Group is yet another example of a forum in health in which CSOs meet to discuss the implementation and evaluation of health policies in the EU region. CSOs influence policy formulation and policy implementation from bottom up and from top to bottom\u2014they are thus essential to a fully inclusive GHG framework. A flourishing CSO framework is a predetermining factor that would support ASEAN in the creation of a sustainable and integrated health governance framework by creating synergy between all levels of the governance spectrum.\n\nASEAN possesses much potential to strengthen health governance in Southeast Asia. ASEAN\u2019s potential can be improved by reinforcing its existing mechanisms to support a stronger and more coherent regional health governance framework. Ultimately, pushing for more integration can pave the way towards a more inclusive ASEAN\u2014pooling the resources and expertise of a civil society network together towards the reduction of health inequities and to meet the health challenges of the twenty-first century.\n\nWe have argued that ASEAN member states may cooperate more effectively through an open method of coordination in which actors and stakeholders for health interact in a complex matrix of shared interests. Such a model involving soft agreements and more regular interactions may be a good structure to move progressively towards more integrated frameworks for cooperation. The OMC does not imply a transfer of competences from the national to the regional level, yet it still empowers regional institutions with certain specific tasks central to the governance process (Regent 2003). The OMC is of particular relevance in dealing with socio-economic issues of high sensitivity such as health (Borras and Jacobsson 2004). As such, it would be a relevant governance structure for ASEAN to enhance its framework for cooperation in health.\n\nAs Illona Kickbush explains, the main challenge of global health governance today is the need to harness creativity, energy and resources for global health. This means instigating the notion of \u201chealth responsibility\u201d in all institutions that have an impact on health\u2014such as businesses, employers, school teachers etc. The greatest challenge is getting non-health actors to act consciously for health\u2014such as the energy, food, or transport industries (Gostin and Mok 2009). As such, the OMC would be a catalyst for increasing CSO activity in Southeast Asia. It is through the creation of community movements and other such grassroots initiatives, for example, that monitoring the implementation at the national and local levels for tobacco control and EID control will become feasible.\n\nAs we have seen, EPHA successfully harnesses the potential of CSOs to supplement a wider matrix for cooperation in health, and to openly contribute to an open framework of cooperation. This platform of CSOs fosters a health-promoting economic framework and social framework favoring a cross-sectoral perspective on health challenges. CSOs can create the link with industrial policies, and corporate behavior, or with issues of poverty and discrimination that have repercussions on health governance. This demonstrates the value of a CSO network for ASEAN to become a noticeable actor in global health. Governance is not only about exchanging technical information; it is also about interchange of values, expectations and accountability. CSOs thus have an important role to play in relaying the expectations of global citizens (Bloom 2007).\n\nRegional bodies such as ASEAN are useful mid-way organizations relaying the engagements of international agreements to the region\u2014ensuring respect and adequate implementation of all international agreements for health improvement within their member states. However, ASEAN should demonstrate equal political commitment towards both short- and long-term health challenges. Although political commitment to cooperate is apparent in times of a pandemic, a similar engagement would be required from member states to tackle the costly threat of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) linked to tobacco usage for example. The challenge of NCDs may be heightened by the creation of an ASEAN Economic Community, hence the need for a regional answer to tackle long-standing health risks.\n\nThe examples of EID control and tobacco control demonstrate the need for stronger horizontal and vertical integration at the regional level. A regional institution takes time to develop and expand. Its integration must be progressive and organic and will have to be accompanied with increasing human capital and financial resources. These will trickle down from heightened political commitment by member states. Greater regional integration may stir political commitment. And with deeper political commitment comes financial commitment, ultimately increasing ASEAN\u2019s capacity to act as a global health actor. With more elaborate regional mechanisms for health cooperation and a wider network of global/regional/societal partnerships, an ASEAN-style and context-specific framework for regional health policy making can evolve organically. By doing so, Southeast Asian representatives will be able to harness ASEAN\u2019s potential to act as a stronger global actor for health cooperation"}
