The counts per minute (cpm) of [ 35 S]methionine incorporated into the Caco-2 cells. In addition, treatment with results, summarized in Table 1 , indicate that IL-1a and IL-1b induced a moderately rotavirus-resistant IFN did not cause any gross change in the specific SDS-PAGE pattern of metabolically labeled Caco-2 state in the Caco-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (maximum inhibition, 70% of control), whereas IL-6 proteins (data not shown). Additional studies were performed to characterize led to a reproducible decrease in infection of dubious physiological significance (maximum inhibition, the time course and nature of the antiviral effect. Figure 1 shows the effect of different durations of IFN-a 30%).

By 24 hours, rotavirus resistance was evident but re-varying concentrations in a ''checkerboard'' simultaneous titration (data not shown). IFN-g and IFN-a pre-quired higher concentrations of IFN-g (mean inhibitory concentration [MIC 50 ], 40 U/mL) compared with treatment led to significant dose-dependent resistance to rotavirus infection (maximum inhibition, 99% and an MIC 50 of approximately 3 U/mL for 72 hours of treatment. The resistance to rotavirus largely persisted 90%, respectively). Similar results were obtained when cytokine-pretreated HT-29 cells were challenged with even if cytokine was removed for 48 hours from cells that had been previously treated for 72 hours.

Double-shelled rotavirus particles also Significant Effect on Rotavirus Binding to Caco-2 Cells\n\nBecause uncoating, transcription, and translation were not blocked in the IFN-g-and IL-1-treated cells, it was deduced that inhibition must be caused by a very early step in viral replication. To identify this early step, binding studies were performed using purified, metabolically labeled RRV rotavirus. Results of a typical experiment are shown in Table 2 . No significant difference in radiolabeled virus binding between control and IL-1-, IFN-a-, and IFN-g-treated cells could be observed. Because many of the purified rotavirus particles may not be capable of initiating infection, it was possible that IFN reduced the binding of the infectious fraction of rotavirus particles. Therefore, the binding of infectious particles of both RRV and Wa rotavirus was also measured using previously described methods. 12 As can be seen from Table 2 , this approach failed to show any \n\nResults are expressed as percentage of media-treated control wells that were infected in the same manner (double-shelled particles or\n\nLipofectin/single-shelled particles).\n\nkines, particularly IL-1, IFN-a, and IFN-g, could downregulate the rotavirus permissivity of Caco-2 cells ( Table  1) .

It is not surprising to observe that IFNs induce strong antiviral states in Caco-2 cells, given that IFN was originally discovered, described, and named for its antiviral effect. 18 Type I IFNs (such as IFN-a) are believed to inhibit viral translation by several pathways including inactivation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2a by phosphorylation via an induced kinase. Thus, in early studies of type I IFN-induced antiviral states, transfection of viral RNA failed to cause cellular infection. 19 Previous experiments in which liposomal transfection of rotavirus failed in IFN-a-treated Caco-2 cells confirm those results (Figure 4) .\n\nThe antiviral properties of IFN-g (type II IFN) have been studied less than those of the type I IFNs such as IFN-a. IFN-g binds to a distinct receptor and apparently induces a distinct antiviral state. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] The fact that anti- (Figures 2 and 3) .
