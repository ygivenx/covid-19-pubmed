{"title": "Comorbid Diabetes Mellitus was Associated with Poorer Prognosis in Patients with COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study", "body": "Since December 2019, China has been experiencing an outbreak of pneumonia with a novel coronavirus [1] , which was officially named as Severe Acute Respiratory \n\nDemographic, clinical features, laboratory, and radiological findings, treatment strategy, and short-term prognosis data of the patients were obtained from their medical records. Clinical outcomes were followed up to March 12, 2020. All the data were checked by two senior physicians (P.P and J.Z). All patients enrolled to this study were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, and the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 was based on the positive detection of viral nuclear acids. The severity of COVID-19 was defined based on the diagnostic and treatment guideline (Version 5-7) by the National Health Committee of China. Severe subtype was defined if a patient met one of the following criteria: 1) Respiratory distress with respiratory frequency \u2265 30/min; 2) Pulse oximeter oxygen saturation \u2264 93% at rest; 3) Oxygenation index (artery partial pressure of oxygen/inspired oxygen fraction, PaO2/FiO2) \u2264 300 mmHg.\n\nCritically ill subtype followed above criteria, and must meet one of the following criteria: 1) Needs mechanical ventilation because of respiratory failure; 2) Shock; 3)\n\nCombined with multiple organ failure that needs to be admitted to intensive care unit .

All data were reviewed and collected onto the standardized forms from the electronic medical records in the hospital, including case report forms, nursing records, laboratory and radiological findings were reviewed. Two senior physicians (P.P and J.Z) independently reviewed the data. Information on demographic data, symptoms, preexisting chronic comorbidities, computed tomographic images of chest, laboratory results were collected. All treatment strategy were collected during the hospitalization, such as antiviral therapy, antibiotic therapy, use of corticosteroid, and respiratory support. The time from illness onset to hospital admission were also recorded.\n\n.

The presence of ARDS was designated by The berlin definition [12] . Cardiac injury was identified when the serum level of hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hsTNI) was above the upper limit of the normal range (>28 pg/mL) or new abnormalities shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography [13] . Acute kidney injury (AKI) was classified on the basis of the highest serum creatinine level or urine output criteria based on KDIGO clinical practice guideline for AKI [14] . Prognosis was defined as discharged from hospital, not discharged yet, and death during hospitalization. The followed-up observation was conducted before March 12, 2020.\n\nContinuous variables were shown as median and interquartile range (IQR), and compared by Mann-Whitney test since most laboratory data were with skewed distribution. Categorical variables were presented as counts and proportions, and compared by Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the associations of diabetes and FBG with fatality of COVID-19, adjusting for potential confounders. Adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were presented as the effect size. All statistical analyses and .

Baseline characteristics of the patients with COVID-19.\n\nThe laboratory and radiological findings on admission of the COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes were presented in Table 2 COVID-19 patients with diabetes had more leucocytes increase (20.6% vs. 6.7%) but less leucocytes decrease (4.8% vs. 10.3%, P=0.004) than those patients without DM.\n\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio (NLR) was significantly higher in diabetic patients compared to those without diabetes (median: 4.56[IQR: 2.69, 9.51] vs. median: 3.8[IQR: 2.25, 6.31], P=0.043). Interestingly, decreased eosinophil counts were also common in these patients (43%), but no significant difference in eosinophils counts and the ratio of patients with decreased eosinophil counts was found in patients with or without DM. Besides, a positive correlation between eosinophil and lymphocytes numbers on admission was observed ( Figure S1) , which was consistent with previous study [15] . Other laboratory findings showed no significant differences between the two groups of patients with respect to serum levels of CRP, PCT, and LDH, but diabetic COVID-19 patients had higher levels of FBG .

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is sharply climbing in China during the past decades. According to the latest nationally representative cross-sectional survey in mainland China in 2013, the estimated prevalence of diabetes in elderly participants (\u226560 years old) was 20.2%\n\n[4]. Previous studies reported 9% to 14% prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19\n\npatients [1, 8, 13, 15 ]. Here, we reported a higher prevalence rate of diabetes in these patients, which might be due to the larger proportion of geriatric patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in our study. The median age of all the participants was 64 years old, which was older than the data previously reported [1, 7, 8 ]. In the current study, 53.5% of the patients were male, and the percentage is similar to that reported by Wang et al The laboratory findings on admission showed that leucocytes and neutrophils counts and the proportion of increased leucocytes were higher in COVID-19 patients with diabetes than those without, which might be explained by the fact that diabetic patients were more susceptible to pathogens after viral infection due to lower immune function. During hospitalization, the diabetic patients were more likely to receive .

Decreased lymphocytes counts and eosinophil counts were also common in these patients; this was consistent with the results of previous studies [15] . However, no significant differences were found in the cell counts and percentage lymphocytes and eosinophil counts between COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes. The data revealed that diabetic COVID-19 patients had a higher NLR, which was recently reported as a predictor of severity of COVID-19 in the early stage [16].\n\nWe found that COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severely or critically ill subtypes, including more complications with ARDS, acute cardiac injury, resulting in receiving more antibiotic therapy and mechanical ventilation. Cox regression model indicated that both diabetes and FBG level on admission were independent predictor for the fatality of COVID, after adjusting for potential confounders. Based on these findings, we deliberately concluded that diabetes was associated with deteriorated disease severity and poorer prognosis in patients with\n\nThis is the first report to demonstrated that the diabetes was associated with greater disease severity and poorer prognosis in COVID-19 patients. An increasing number of studies have shown that diabetic patients had higher mortality and morbidity of severe medical illness, such as myocardial infarction, and high FBG plays an independent predictive role in hospitalized non-diabetic patients as well [17, 18, 19] . Diabetes has also been identified as a significant risk factor for severe disease following respiratory tract infections [20] . Several studies demonstrated that diabetes was associated with increased the risks of severity and mortality after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV .

Previous study reported that diabetic patients who received intensive glycemic control had lower risk of cardiovascular events [25] . Nevertheless, we could deliberately conclude that diabetes and FBG were independent predictive risks for poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients after adjusting those cofounders and mediators.\n\nDiabetes results in a proinflammatory homeostatic immune response skewed toward helper T cell 1 (Th1) and T17 cells and a decrease in regulatory T cells (Treg) [26] .\n\nImmune dysfunction of diabetes alone or following infection has been reported for a wide variety of immune cells, not just macrophages, monocytes and CD4 + T cells [26] .\n\nA recent study reported the number of total T cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subsets were substantially reduced and functionally exhausted in COVID-19 patients, especially among geriatric and critically ill patients who required ICU admission [27] .\n\nKulcsar KA et al showed that diabetic mice presented a prolonged phase of severe disease and delayed recovery after MERS-CoV infection, which was attributed to dysregulated immune response with lower inflammatory monocytes/macrophages and CD4 + T cells [28] . Thus, optimal management of diabetes and intensive glycemic control may help prevent the occurrence of life-threatening infections and .

First, this study was a retrospective study, with the fact that we included a very small proportion of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan. Berkson bias might be introduced since asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms were less likely to be enrolled. Second, due to the massive number of patients and the lack of medical resources, the interval from the illness onset to hospital admission was more than 10 days for most patients, which could further complicate and deteriorate the illness, with different extent. Nevertheless, patients with diabetes had similar interval from onset to admission compared with those without diabetes. Third, at the time of the study submission, most of patients were not discharged yet, and the final survival outcome could not be determined now, and the long-term prognosis were not observed.\n\nIn the current study, we demonstrated that diabetes mellitus is associated with greater disease severity and poorer short-term outcomes including death. Stronger personal prophylactic strategies are advised for diabetic patients, and more intensive surveillance and treatment should be considered when they are infected with SARS-CoV-2, especially in geriatric patients or those had preexisting comorbidities.\n\n.
