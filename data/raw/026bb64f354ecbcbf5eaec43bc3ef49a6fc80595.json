{"title": "Virological and clinical characterization of respiratory infections in children attending an emergency department during the first autumn-winter circulation of pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus", "body": "Hospital emergency departments (EDs) experience pressure on admissions during the winter months, because of respiratory infections; in winter, various respiratory pathogens that present with similar symptoms circulate widely in children [1] . Diagnosis of influenza virus infections, as with other respiratory pathogens, is usually based on clinical and epide-miological criteria, and is only rarely confirmed virologically [2] . However, lack of an aetiological diagnosis could hamper efforts to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission and the efficient use of the proper antiviral drugs. In order to evaluate the relative impact of a novel virus, laboratory-confirmed data are needed on hospitalization rates for and clinical courses of respiratory viral infections.\n\nIn Italy, as in other northern hemisphere countries, pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus (A/H1N1/2009) caused a first peak of infection in the spring and early summer months of 2009, and there was a second flare during the autumn, the normal epidemic period for various respiratory viruses. Recent papers have focused on the clinical course of A/H1N1/2009 infection [3] [4] [5] , comparing patient data from the paediatric population with those available for seasonal influenza infections, but not with other respiratory virus clinical presentations and courses. In only one prospective study [3] , conducted in the southern hemisphere, were the clinical features of A/H1N1/2009 compared with those of several other respiratory viruses (although not rhinovirus (RV) and other recently identified viruses).\n\nThe fact that A/H1N1/2009 circulates concurrently with other respiratory agents points to a need for better data on the epidemiology, clinical presentation and course of infections caused by the different respiratory viruses.\n\nAccordingly, with the aim of characterizing respiratory viral infections during the first autumn-winter season characterized by A/H1N1/2009 circulation, children attending a paediatric ED in Rome for acute respiratory infections, whether subsequently hospitalized or not, were prospectively enrolled between November 2009 and March 2010. The signs and symptoms, laboratory data and clinical outcomes were then compared in order to characterize A/H1N1/2009 from other respiratory virus infections.\n\nBetween November 2009 and March 2010, consecutive children (age 0-16 years) attending the paediatric ED of a teaching hospital (Policlinico Umberto I, 'Sapienza' University of Rome, one of the largest EDs in Rome, with approximately 30 000 consultations per year) were eligible for enrolment in the study, if they presented with fever at admission (temperature \u202138\u00b0C) or in the preceding days and/or with at least one acute respiratory symptom (rhinorrhoea, cough, wheezing, or respiratory distress). Exclusion criteria were underlying chronic diseases (including cystic fibrosis, chronic pulmonary disease, congenital heart disease, and immunodeficiency). Informed consent was sought from the children's parents for them to participate in the study, which had been approved by the hospital's Ethics Committee. To ensure accurate virological diagnosis, two respiratory specimens-a pharyngeal swab (PS) (Virocult; Medical Wire and Equipment, Corsham, UK) and a nasal washing (NW) (3 mL of sterile saline solution injected into each nostril and collected with a syringe)-were taken during ED consultation from enrolled children, whether subsequently hospitalized or not. Detailed demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the patients' medical files. A severity score ranging from 0 to 8 was assigned according to respiratory rate (age-adjusted), arterial oxygen saturation in room air (0, >95%; 1, 95-90%; 2, <90%), the presence of retractions (0, none; 1, present;; 2, present + nasal flare), and ability to feed (0, normal; 1, reduced; 2, intravenous) [6] .\n\nWithin 24 h of arrival at the virology laboratory, aliquots of the PS medium (140 lL) that had been collected were used for RNA extraction with a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and subjected to reverse transcription driven by random hexamers, with the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Monza, Italy). NW samples were vortexed to shear mucus, and divided into three aliquots, one of which was used for RNA extraction as described above. Detection of the influenza A virus was performed with a PCR assay targeting the influenza M gene, according to WHO protocols (http://www.who.int/ csr/resources/publications/swineflu/diagnostic_recommendations/en/index.html). Positive samples were subjected to a further PCR reaction, in nested format, targeting the M genomic sequence specific for A/H1N1/2009, with primer pairs designed for this study (first round-MEXF5, 5\u00a2-TGCATGGGCCTCATATATACAA-3\u00a2, and MEXR5, 5\u00a2-AT GACCATCGTCAACATCCA-3\u00a2; second round-SM670, 5\u00a2-AGCTCCAGTGCTGGTCTGAAAG-3\u00a2, and SMR900, 5\u00a2-GACTCAGGCACTCCTTCCGTAGAA-3\u00a2), and confirmed by sequencing. Thirteen respiratory viruses other than influenza A virus (influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, RV, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs)1-3, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1, and human bocavirus (hBoV)) were tested for with PCR assays, as previously described [7, 8] . A case was defined as positive when at least one of each type of sample (NW and PS) gave a positive result.\n\nViral genome quantification was performed on cDNA from the most A/H1N1/2009-positive PS sample. Primers and probes targeting the influenza M gene were derived from CDC protocols (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/swineflu/CDCrealtimeRTPCRprotocol_20090428) and adapted for use in a 5\u00a2-exonuclease TaqMan-based real-time PCR technique. The standards were obtained by cloning 105 bp of the viral M gene into the pCR2.1 plasmid with a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A linear distribution (r = 0.99) was obtained between 10 1 and 10 9 copies of standard plasmid. Data were expressed as number of copies/mL of PS; limits of detection were 10 viral copies/mL.\n\nPatient age, number of days of hospitalization and severity score were reported as median (range), and data were compared by means of the Kruskal-Wallis test. The Fisher exact test was used to analyse categorical independent variables. For continuous variables, Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney U-test were used to compare parametric and nonparametric data, respectively. Data analysis was carried out with SPSS v. 1.3 for Windows; p-values <0.05 were considered to be significant. (Table 1 ). In addition, PS samples taken either at hospital discharge or at follow-up visits after a variable number of days (median 4.5 days; range 3-27 days) were tested for respiratory viruses; only two PS samples were positive for A/H1N1/2009 (Table 1) . No significant correlation was found between number of copies of A/H1N1/2009 in the PS samples and patient data (i.e. age, length of hospitalization, duration of symptoms before hospitalization, clinical diagnosis, oseltamivir treatment, or positivity to PCR test performed at hospital discharge).\n\nA/H1N1/2009 infections were found mainly in the first weeks of November, the last few cases being found in December (Fig. 1 ). During November, 19/47 (40%) enrolled patients, representing 73% (19/26) of the viral respiratory infections, were infected with A/H1N1/2009. Although three RSV infections were found in November, full seasonal activity for RSV started in December, appeared to peak in February, and decreased in March. Throughout January and February, RSV affected 49% (51/104) of the total number of patients and 88% (51/58) of those who were virus-positive. RV was found throughout the study period ( Fig. 1) , with two peaks, the first being in November/December, corresponding to the second half of the H1N1 2009 peak and the beginning of RSV seasonal activity. After all but disappearing during January and February, RV peaked again in March, at the end of the RSV season. For the two peak periods, RV infections affected 21% (11/52) and 33% (8/24), respectively, of the total number of patients presenting for acute respiratory infections; 4/20 (20%) RV-infected children were co-infected with other respiratory viruses (two RSV, one hMPV, and one hBoV), with a significant difference in co-infection rates vs. A/H1N1/2009 and RSV (p <0.05; chi-squared test).\n\nAnalysis of patient signs and symptoms at ED presentation, and of any requirement for hospitalization or admittance to the paediatric intensive-care unit (PICU), was performed initially between virus-negative and virus-positive patients and then for four different virus groups (Table 2 ). Overall, virus-infected patients presented with similar frequencies of fever, cough and respiratory parameters (thoracic auscultation, oxygen saturation (S a O 2 )) as virus-negative children and were hospitalized at similar rates, but were significantly more frequently admitted to the PICU (Table 2 ). Among the viruspositive groups, RSV-infected children were, as expected, significantly younger than those who tested positive for A/H1N1/2009 and RV, presented with significantly lower saturation rates, and were more frequently admitted to the PICU than other virus groups ( Table 2 ). Children infected with A/H1N1/2009 presented as frequently with fever, cough and gastrointestinal symptoms as other children with acute respiratory infections, whether virus-positive or not, and did not suffer from severe respiratory distress, as also documented by a significantly higher rate of negative thoracic auscultation than in the other groups. The ED presentations of RV-infected children appeared to be indistinguishable in terms of signs and symptoms from those of other groups ( Table 2) .\n\nTo better evaluate the clinical course in hospitalized patients infected with RSV, A/H1N1/2009 and RV as single infections, patient data were analysed with stratification by age (Table 3 ). Whether in infants or in children aged >1 year, RSV cases presented a higher severity score with respect to A/H1N1/2009 but not to RV, whereas no significant difference was found in number of days of hospitalization between virus groups. For blood cell counts, several statistically significant differences between virus groups were found. Among children aged \u00a31 year, those infected with RV presented with leukocytosis (defined as white blood cell (WBC) counts >15 000/mm 3 ) and elevated lymphocyte and eosinophil counts as compared with those infected with RSV; as compared with the RSV group, the A/H1N1/2009 group presented only with significantly higher lymphocyte counts. In children aged >1 year, the total WBC and neutrophil counts were elevated in RV cases, at a statistically significant level, as compared with patients infected with RSV only, but three RV patients probably had a concomitant bacterial infection, having WBC counts >15 000/mm 3 and C-reactive protein levels of approximately 9 mg/mL. The main discharge clinical diagnoses are presented in Table 4 , distributed by respiratory virus results. Bronchiolitis (defined as a history of upper respiratory tract infection followed by acute onset of respiratory distress with cough, tachypnoea, retraction and diffuse crackles on auscultation in infants within 1 year) was the most frequent clinical diagnosis, and 49% of these cases were RSV single infections; the second most frequent single agent was RV (7%), whereas 16% of bronchiolitis cases were infected with other viruses or co-infected; no viruses were found in the remaining cases. Pneumonia was the second most frequent clinical diagnosis, and RSV was the most frequent viral pathogen found (47% of virus-positive cases). It is noteworthy that 7/8 children aged >1 year affected with A/H1N1/2009 were diagnosed with pneumonia.\n\nRSV was also the most prevalent virus (32%) in patients with a wheezy bronchitis diagnosis, followed by RV (15%) and A/H1N1/2009 (7%); in 40% of wheezing patients, no virus was detected. Children with a diagnosis of influenza-like illness (definition provided by the Italian Ministry of Health, i.e. fever (temperature \u202138\u00b0C), with at least one of , and nine co-infections (three RSV-hMPV, two RSV-RV, one RSV-hBoV, one RV-hMPV, one RV-hBoV, and one hBoV-PIV1). d ILI definition provided by the Italian Ministry of Health, i.e. fever (temperature \u202138\u00b0C), with at least one of headache, asthenia, or myalgia, and at least one of the respiratory symptoms of cough, rhinitis, or acute pharyngitis. headache, asthenia, or myalgia, and at least one of the respiratory symptoms of cough, rhinitis, or acute pharyngitis) had the lowest rate of hospitalization (57%) as compared with the other clinical diagnoses; A/H1N1/2009 infected 33% of influenza-like illness cases, but in most of these (62%) no respiratory virus was found.\n\nIn the framework of a study aimed at characterizing respiratory virus infections, we compared signs and symptoms, laboratory results and clinical outcomes in prospectively enrolled paediatric patients seeking medical care in EDs during the first autumn-winter season characterized by A/ H1N1/2009 circulation. The national sentinel surveillance systems for influenza (Influnet) of the Italian Ministry of Health reported the peak in influenza A incidence in week 45 of 2009, just when the study period started, with 25.7 cases/1000 served population in the 0-4-year age group and 43.1 cases/1000 in the 5-14year age group [9] . The reported incidence of influenza A fell at the end of November, and in December the rates were very low [9] , according to the distribution of A/H1N1/2009 cases in our study. In addition, the national surveillance system reported approximately 1100 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized cases, 40% of which had underlying risk factors [9] . In this study, we restricted enrolment to children with no underlying chronic diseases; Italian papers [10] [11] [12] on hospitalized children have reported other inclusion criteria or focused on specific aspects, so it is difficult to compare data.\n\nAt ED presentation, no respiratory signs/symptoms could differentiate virus infection from other causes of acute respiratory syndrome, but virus-infected children were more often admitted to the PICU than those with negative results for respiratory viruses. Presentations of children infected with A/H1N1/2009 were quite similar to those for other acute respiratory infections; only RSV infections could be associated with younger age, significantly lower oxygen saturation rates, and more frequent admissions to the PICU. Thus, as indicated in previous studies in adult patients [13] [14] [15] , ED triage assessment would not be able to separate virus-infected patients from non-infected patients, or to identify a specific agent.\n\nOver the study period, unlike in previous seasons, the A/ H1N1/2009 prevalence peak preceded the period in which RSV circulated (December-March); RV circulated in November-December, when the A/H1N1/2009 prevalence was declining and the RSV prevalence was rising, and in March, when RSV circulation was diminishing. Thus, although RV showed a tendency to circulate at the end of either the A/ H1N1/2009 or RSV peaks, RV infections also occurred at the same time as infections with the two major respiratory viruses, A/H1N1/2009 and RSV, and presented a rate of coinfections (20% of positive samples) consistent with previous reports [16, 17] . Interestingly, in this study, A/H1N1/2009 occurred as a single infection, whereas RSV presented with a low frequency of co-infection (7%). The relatively low rate of mixed respiratory virus infections (only about 4% of the total number of samples) and the low percentages of detection of PIV1, PIV3 and hMPV found in this study as compared with our previous studies [7, 8] , in which the same RT-PCR reactions were used, could be explained by the unusual prevalence of an influenza A virus, A/H1N1/2009, in October-November. In fact, several papers [18] [19] [20] have reported changes in respiratory virus circulation in the past season, and suggested, as a possible explanation, that the activation of innate immunity resulting from a respiratory infection would prevent superinfection with other respiratory pathogens [21] ; further studies are needed to investigate this possibility.\n\nEvaluation of the clinical characteristics of enrolled patients confirmed that RSV is the pathogen with the highest severity of infection in children, with the highest number of PICU admissions, even though the total days of hospitalization were not significantly different from those for other groups. In our patients, leukocytosis occurred less frequently in RSV infections than in RV and A/H1N1/2009 infections, and lymphocyte, neutrophil and eosinophil counts were not elevated as compared with other virus-positive groups (Table 3 ) and the virus-negative group (data not shown). These findings are consistent with previous reports, and might imply either that leukocytes are not alerted by RSV infection or that they are being recruited at specific sites away from the circulating blood, as has been suggested by others [22] [23] [24] . Lymphocyte and eosinophil counts were significantly increased in RV-infected infants as compared with other groups; as blood eosinophil counts are predictors of reactive airway disease, our finding is consistent with studies reporting early RV infections as an important risk factor for recurrent wheezing [25, 26] .\n\nPatients infected with A/H1N1/2009 experienced a mild clinical course overall, as documented by severity scores that were significantly lower than those for RSV cases; nevertheless, in our series, 7/8 (87%) A/H1N1/2009-infected children aged >1 year had a final clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. The rate of A/H1N1/2009 pneumonia diagnosis found in this study is consistent with previous reports of A/H1N1/2009 pulmonary replication greater than that expected from a seasonal influenza virus [5, 27] . It has been suggested that the greater rate of pneumonia might perhaps differentiate A/ H1N1/2009 from seasonal influenza [4] ; however, this criterion will not help to discriminate it from other respiratory virus infections, as pneumonia, being a clinical diagnosis, is not suggestive of a specific viral infection.\n\nIf diagnostic tests are not performed, epidemiological and clinical criteria could lead to the misdiagnosis of viral infections for which specific treatments might be available. Even though specific antiviral drugs are currently used only in cases of influenza virus infection, the usefulness of proper treatment against RSV and RV infections in infants would be improved by the use of virological molecular diagnosis. As an example, even though treatment with systemic corticosteroids is not recommended in cases of RSV infection, it has been reported that administration of prednisolone to hospitalized children with first episodes of wheezing associated with RV infection reduces the frequency of relapse [28] .\n\nIn conclusion, in the season characterized by the first autumn-winter circulation of a new pandemic influenza virus, RSV was the most frequent and relevant respiratory virus determining ED consultations for children of any age, A/ H1N1/2009 was confirmed as a mild pathogen but with a relevant rate of pulmonary replication, and RV was established as the third most relevant agent for children's hospitalization for respiratory infections. Considering the fact that clinical presentation is not useful in discriminating between viral pathogens, a timely virological diagnosis is essential in order to separate infected patients during pandemic alerts or at-risk children, and in order to prescribe specific treatments for influenza A virus, RSV and RV infections."}
