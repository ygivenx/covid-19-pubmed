{"title": "The C-terminal domain of the MERS coronavirus M protein contains a\ntrans-Golgi network localization signal", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs)4 are widespread\npathogens that can infect a wide variety of species among mammals and birds (1, 2),\nincluding humans, causing mostly respiratory and enteric symptoms. There are six\nknown coronaviruses infecting humans. The first human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and\nHCoV-OC43, were isolated in the 1960s from patients suffering from a common cold.\nAdministration of these viruses to volunteers rapidly confirmed their harmless\ncharacter. Therefore, research on coronaviruses had been mostly of veterinary\ninterest, but this changed recently with the emergence of two highly pathogenic\nhuman coronaviruses causing severe pneumonia epidemics. First, the severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) appeared in 2002, and then the Middle\nEast respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) appeared in 2012. Both viruses have\na zoonotic origin, showing that this virus family is a reservoir of emerging\npathogens, especially because of their high interspecies transmission (3).\n\nCoronaviruses are enveloped positive single-stranded RNA viruses, with a very large\ngenome of 25\u201330 kb, belonging to the Coronaviridae family in the Nidovirales\norder. The viral particle is composed of a lipid envelope in which at least three\nstructural proteins are anchored: the spike protein (S), the\nenvelope protein (E), and the membrane protein\n(M). Inside the particle, the viral RNA is associated with the\nnucleocapsid protein (N), forming a helical capsid. The S\nprotein triggers viral entry by binding to the cellular receptor and mediating\nfusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane (4, 5). The E protein is a\nsmall protein with multiple roles during infection (6). The SARS-CoV E protein plays an important role in viral\npathogenesis, and this role can be linked to the ion channel activity of the protein\n(7). The E protein is also involved in\nviral assembly, trafficking, and egress of virions, by promoting membrane curvature\nand viral fission and by inducing morphological changes of the compartments of the\nsecretory pathway (8, 9).\n\nThe M protein is the most abundant protein of the envelope (10). Its length ranges from 217 to 230 amino acid residues in\nmost coronaviruses, but it can go up to 270 residues in some coronaviruses\n(bottlenose dolphin coronavirus). It is a protein with three membrane-spanning\nhydrophobic segments, a small N-terminal domain located outside the virion (or\ninside the lumen of intracellular organelles), and a large C-terminal domain that\nmakes up half of the protein, inside the virion (or in the cytoplasm of infected\ncells) (10). M proteins of some\nalphacoronaviruses contain an additional hydrophobic segment that functions as a\nsignal peptide. The M protein is invariably glycosylated on its N-terminal domain.\nHowever, there are differences in the type of glycosylation. The murine hepatitis\nvirus (MHV) and some other Betacoronavirus M proteins are\nO-glycosylated, whereas Alpha- and\nDeltacoronavirus M proteins are modified with\nN-linked sugars. The glycosylation is dispensable for virus\nassembly (11). The M protein is considered to\nbe the motor of the assembly of viral particles because it is able to interact with\nall of the other structural proteins (12\u201314). Important M\u2013M interactions have also been demonstrated\nduring assembly (15, 16). For many coronaviruses, including the transmissible\ngastroenteritis virus, MHV, and IBV, the co-expression of M and E proteins in cells\nis sufficient to induce the production of virus-like particles (17\u201319), indicating that\nthese proteins are essential and sufficient to the assembly step. Only for SARS-CoV,\nthe nucleocapsid protein has been shown to be additionally required for the\nproduction of virus-like particles (20). EM\nobservations have shown that coronaviruses bud inside the ER\u2013Golgi\nintermediate compartment (ERGIC) (21, 22) and then travel through the Golgi. Although\nthe assembly step of coronaviruses occurs in the ERGIC compartment, it has been\nshown for several coronaviruses that the M protein expressed alone in cells can go\nbeyond the assembly site in the secretory pathway (21). However, the subcellular localization of the M protein varies\nbetween the different coronavirus species. Indeed, MHV M protein can reach the\ntrans-Golgi network (TGN), whereas IBV-M protein is retained in\nthe ERGIC and one or two cisternae of the cis-Golgi (21, 23,\n24). The intracellular retention of IBV-M\nhas been attributed to the first membrane-spanning segment and particularly to polar\nresidues located within this domain (25,\n26). For MHV, both the TM1 and the last\n22 amino acids seem to be important determinants for the intracellular localization\nof the protein (27). The aim of this study\nwas to investigate the subcellular localization of the MERS-M protein and to\ncharacterize the signals involved in its trafficking.\n\nThe M protein is composed of a short N-terminal domain followed by three\nmembrane-spanning segments and a long C-terminal domain (Fig. 1A). To analyze the intracellular\ntrafficking of the MERS-CoV M protein, we transfected a vector expressing the\nMERS-CoV M protein with a HA tag fused at its N terminus (HA-MERS-M) in HeLa\ncells and compared the protein localization with different compartment markers\nusing immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (Fig. 1B). As observed in Fig. 1B, MERS-CoV M shows a good\ncolocalization with TGN46 that localizes in the trans-Golgi\nnetwork. We confirmed this colocalization by co-transfection of the M protein\nwith the GFP fused to the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of the\ncation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (GFP-CI-MPR). This reporter has\nbeen shown to be localized in the TGN in HeLa cells (28). The images were then analyzed using ImageJ to\ncalculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for each co-staining (Fig. 1C). The PCC measures\nthe pixel-by-pixel covariance of the signal levels of two images (29). The PCC values range from \u22121 to\n1. A PCC value of 1 is obtained for two images whose intensities of fluorescence\nare linearly and perfectly related, whereas a value of \u22121 means that the\nintensities are inversely related to one another. Values near 0 mean that the\nintensities are uncorrelated. Our results confirm the localization of MERS-CoV M\nin the TGN with a PCC of 0.878 (\u00b10.014) and 0.852 (\u00b10.012) for the\nMERS-CoV M with TGN46 and GFP-CI-MPR markers, respectively. The PCCs for\nMERS-CoV M and CD4 (a cell surface marker) or the calreticulin (an ER marker)\nare below 0.4. However, the PCC between MERS-CoV M and the ERGIC marker,\nERGIC-53, is higher (0.524 \u00b1 0.03).\n\nTo facilitate the detection of the M protein and particularly in co-staining\nexperiments, different M protein constructs were generated with different tags\neither at the N terminus (HA or V5) or at the C terminus (V5 or VSVG). This\noffers the advantage of using a panel of antibodies raised in different species.\nTo use these tools, we analyzed their intracellular localization to confirm that\nadding a tag, regardless of their sequence or the position of the insertion, had\nno effect on MERS-CoV M localization. We also generated a polyclonal antibody\nraised against a C-terminal peptide of the M protein to detect the untagged\nprotein. This antibody was used to control the effect of the tags on the\nsubcellular localization of the M protein. Cells expressing M or the different\ntagged versions of this protein were processed for double-label\nimmunofluorescent detection of the M protein and TGN46 (Fig. 1D). For each protein, the\ncolocalization level with the TGN46 marker was also quantified by calculating\nthe PCC (Fig. 1E). As\nobserved with HA-M, the untagged form of the protein presented a strong\ncolocalization with the TGN46 marker (Fig.\n1, D and E) with a PCC of 0.857\n\u00b1 0.015. Similar results were obtained with the other tagged proteins.\nAltogether, these results indicate that the MERS-CoV M protein expressed alone\nis located in the TGN and that the tag added to our constructs does not alter\nthis localization.\n\nTo study the role of the C-terminal domain of MERS-CoV M in its intracellular\ntrafficking, we constructed serial deletion mutants of 20 residues. The deletion\nof the last 20 residues of the MERS-CoV M protein (M\u039420) produced mutants\nthat were no longer localized in the TGN (Fig.\n2A). Moreover, it induced a different intracellular\nlocalization, depending on the tag used. Indeed, HA-M\u039420 co-localizes with\ncalreticulin, the ER marker, as shown by the double labeling in Fig. 2B, whereas\nM\u039420-VSVG was located at the cell surface, as shown by the double labeling\nof M\u039420-VSVG and CD4 (Fig.\n2C). We measured the extent of colocalization for\nHA-M\u039420 or M\u039420-VSVG with the ER, TGN, or cell surface marker by\nmeasuring the PCC (Fig.\n2D). The WT protein presented a PCC of 0.905 \u00b1\n0.007 for TGN46 and of 0.296 \u00b1 0.014 and 0.239 \u00b1 0.017 for CRT and\nCD4, respectively. The HA-M\u039420 protein showed a decrease of the PCC for\nTGN46 (0.369 \u00b1 0.019) associated with an increase of the PCC with CRT\n(0.855 \u00b1 0.011). The HA-M\u039420 also showed a moderate increase in cell\nsurface localization with a PCC for CD4 of 0.539 \u00b1 0.018. The PCC between\nM\u039420-VSVG and TGN46 was also strongly decreased (0.331 \u00b1 0.025);\nhowever, the M\u039420-VSVG protein presented a strong increase of the PCC for\nCD4 (0.79 \u00b1 0.016) and a moderate increase of the PCC for CRT (0.475 \u00b1\n0.018). These results suggest that important intracellular trafficking motifs\nare present in the distal part of the C-terminal domain of MERS-CoV M. Analysis\nof the sequence of the last 20 residues showed that the deleted sequence\ncontains a potential diacidic ER export signal at positions 211\u2013213\n(211DIE213). This signal was first characterized for\nthe glycoprotein of VSV and is indeed present in the VSVG tag\n(YTDIEMNRLGK) used in our experiments. It is likely\nthat a blockade of ER export arose from the deletion in HA-M\u039420 and the\nloss of the DxE signal; however, the addition of the VSVG tag in the\nM\u039420-VSVG protein restored the signal and rescued the ER export. Moreover,\nthe M\u039420-VSVG protein was mainly located at the cell surface instead of\nbeing retained in TGN, suggesting that the distal part of the C-terminal domain\nof the M protein also contains a determinant responsible for its localization in\nthe TGN.\n\nTo confirm the role of the DxE signal in the ER export of the MERS-M protein, we\nmutated the aspartic acid and glutamic acid into alanine (D211A/E213A) in the M\nprotein fused with an N-terminal HA tag (HA-M-DxE) or with a C-terminal VSVG tag\n(M-DxE-VSVG) and analyzed the subcellular localization of the mutants in\nconfocal microscopy. Similarly to HA-M\u039420, HA-M-DxE was mainly localized\nin the ER, whereas M-DxE-VSVG was localized in the TGN (Fig. 2, A and B),\nconfirming that the VSVG tag is able to compensate the D211A/E213A mutation.\nThis result demonstrates that the DxE signal present in the C-terminal domain of\nMERS-CoV M protein is a functional ER export signal involved in the trafficking\nof the protein.\n\nThe presence of the DxE signal explained the exit of the M protein from the ER\nbut not its retention in the trans-Golgi, because it is\ncommonly accepted that in nonpolarized cells, the constitutive secretory pathway\nleads to the plasma membrane by default (i.e. in absence of\nspecific addressing/retention signals). Considering that and the fact that the\nM\u039420-VSVG protein migrates to the cell surface, we looked for the presence\nof another signal in the last 20 amino acids of the cytosolic tail, which could\nbe involved in the retention of MERS-CoV M in the TGN compartment. For this\npurpose, we constructed three smaller C-terminal deletion mutants lacking 5, 10,\nor 15 residues but keeping the VSVG tag to rescue the ER export. These mutants\nwere called M\u03945, M\u039410, and M\u039415. We then compared the\nsubcellular localization of these mutants with the WT and M\u039420 M proteins\n(Fig. 3, A\u2013C).\nSimilar to what was observed for the WT M and in contrast to M\u039420 protein,\nthe M\u03945, M\u039410, and M\u039415 proteins co-localized with the TGN46\nmarker, indicating that the 5-amino acid sequence AGNYR, located between the\n\u039420 and \u039415 deletions, is likely involved in the specific\nlocalization of the protein in the TGN. To identify the residues involved in the\nTGN localization of the protein, each amino acid (except the alanine) was\nmutated individually into alanine in the M\u039415 protein. M\u039415-G201A,\nM\u039415-N202A, M\u039415-Y203A, and M\u039415-R204A were expressed in HeLa\ncells, and the subcellular localization of the proteins was analyzed by\nfluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4). The\nproteins carrying the mutation G201A, Y203A, or R204A showed a reduced\ncolocalization with the TGN46 marker compared with the M\u039415 (Fig. 4, A and\nC), with partial export of the protein to the cell surface\n(Fig. 4, B and\nC). This difference in intracellular trafficking is\nillustrated by a decrease of PCC between the M mutants and TGN46 associated with\nan increase of the PCC with CD4. These results indicate a role of these three\nresidues in the localization of the protein in the TGN. The mutation N202A had\nno effect on the subcellular localization of the protein compared with the WT.\nTo confirm these results, the mutation G201A, Y203A, or R204A was also inserted\ninto the full-length protein. Analysis of the subcellular localization of these\nmutants is shown in Fig. 5. M-G201A,\nM-Y203A, and M-R204A showed a reduced co-localization with TGN46 compared with\nthe WT M-VSVG and an increase of cell surface expression, resulting in an\nincrease of the PCC between the mutant and CD4. To ensure that we identified the\nfull motif involved in the TGN localization of the protein, we also mutated\nthree conserved residues (Tyr-195, Arg-197, or Lys-199) among the\nbetacoronaviruses located upstream of the \u039420 deletion. Interestingly,\nmutation of the residue Lys-199 also resulted in an increase of the cell surface\nexpression of the protein (Fig. 5).\n\nWe also constructed a quadruple mutant protein, M-K199A/G201A/Y203A/R204A\n(M-KGYR). The extent of colocalization of the quadruple mutant (M-KGYR) with\nTGN46 and CD4 was in the same range than those of the single mutants.\n\nTo confirm the cell surface expression of the M protein when the residues\nLys-199, Gly-201, Tyr-203, and Arg-204 are mutated, we performed a cell surface\nbiotinylation assay. The MERS-M protein contains an\nN-glycosylation site in its N-terminal domain\n(MSNMTQLTE); consequently, the migration profile of\nthe MERS-M protein in immunoblotting renders the quantification of the protein\namount difficult (see Fig.\n6C), so we also mutated the\nN-glycosylation site in the different mutants. First, we\nverified that introducing the mutation N3Q had no effect on the intracellular\nlocalization of the different proteins (M, M\u039420, M-DxE, M-K199A, M-G201A,\nM-Y203A, M-R204A, and M-KGYR; data not shown). Plasma membrane proteins in cells\nexpressing the different mutants were labeled with nonpermeable biotin, and then\nbiotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-conjugated agarose\nbeads and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig.\n6, A and B). The M protein is only\nweakly expressed at the cell surface, with less than 1% of the total amount of\nprotein expression at the cell surface. Mutation of the residues Lys-199,\nGly-201, Tyr-203, and Arg-204 alone or in combination induced an increase in\ncell surface detection of the M protein, with \u223c13% of the total amount of\nN3Q-M-KGYR located at the cell surface. Single mutations induced only moderate\nincreases of the cell surface expression compared with the quadruple mutant. The\nN3Q-M-DxE was barely detected at the cell surface. As seen in an\nimmunofluorescent colocalization assay (Fig.\n6B), the expression of the N3Q-M\u039420 mutant at\nthe cell surface was slightly increased compared with the WT protein. Together,\nthese results indicated that the residues Lys-199, Gly-201, Tyr-203, and Arg-204\nof MERS-CoV M are involved in its specific localization in the TGN.\n\nWe also investigated the N-glycosylation status of the DxE and\nKxGxYR mutants. In the immunoblot, the WT protein migrated as three bands (Fig. 6C). A first band of\naround 20\u201325 kDa corresponds to the unglycosylated M protein, confirmed\nby the migration profile of the protein in which the\nN-glycosylation site was abolished by mutation (N3Q-M) and by\ntreatment with PNGase F. A second band of \u223c30 kDa and a third more\ndiffuse band migrating more slowly were also observed. As expected, the second\nband is sensitive to endoglycosidase H (EndoH) treatment, showing that this band\ncorresponds to M proteins glycosylated in the ER that have not reached the Golgi\nyet. The more diffuse band was not sensitive to EndoH treatment, suggesting that\nthis form is further modified in the Golgi. Only one band was observed with the\nDxE mutant with a high intensity at 30 kDa sensitive to EndoH. The EndoH\nsensitivity of the 30 kDa band likely reflects the accumulation of this protein\nin the ER due to the lack of export signal. It is worth noticing that the\nmigration profile of the M-KGYR mutant in Western blotting showed an increased\nN-glycosylation consistent with a better trafficking\nthrough the Golgi (Fig.\n6C). Altogether, these results confirm the presence of\ntwo intracellular trafficking motifs in the C-terminal domain of the MERS-CoV M\nprotein: first the DxE motif is responsible for the ER export of the protein,\nand then a second motif, KxGxYR, is involved in its retention in the TGN.\n\nIntracellular trafficking is a dynamic process with proteins that can undergo\ncycles of cell surface expression and internalization. At steady state, the\nlocalization of proteins at the plasma membrane results from an equilibrium\nbetween anterograde intracellular trafficking and retrieval of protein by\nendocytosis. Any inhibition of endocytosis would result in protein accumulation\nat the cell surface. To test whether the KxGxYR motif is an endocytosis signal,\nwe analyzed the endocytosis of the M protein in a biotinylation assay. Proteins\nexpressed at the plasma membrane of cells expressing N3Q-M or N3Q-M-KGYR were\nlabeled at 4 \u00b0C with a nonpermeable cleavable biotin, and then endocytosis\nwas allowed by incubating the cells at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Noninternalized\nbiotin was then cleaved with GSH, and internalized proteins were detected by\nimmunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 6\n(E and F), we did not detect any\ndifference in endocytosis levels between the WT protein and M-KGYR.\n\nIt has been proposed that oligomerization of MHV-M protein could be involved in\nits TGN retention. Indeed, mutants that do not form oligomers were detected at\nthe cell surface. In cell lysates, the mutant N3Q-M-KGYR forms dimer in amounts\ncomparable with the WT protein (Fig.\n6D). We also analyzed the formation of N3Q-M-KGYR\noligomers at the cell surface. To do so, the cell proteins at the cell surface\nwere biotinylated and cross-linked. The formation of multimers was detected by\nimmunoblotting (Fig. 6D).\nAs previously shown, expression of N3Q-M-KGYR at the cell surface was increased.\nWe detected the formation of dimers with a strong band migrating at 40 kDa and\nalso the formation of higher oligomers for both proteins, suggesting that the\nincreased cell surface expression conferred by the mutation of the motif KxGxYR\nis not due to a defect in M\u2013M interactions. These results indicate that\nthe KxGxYR signal is not involved in M oligomerization and is not an\ninternalization signal and that the localization of MERS-CoV M in the TGN is\nlikely due to a mechanism of retention, preventing the cell surface expression\nof the protein.\n\nTo confirm the role of the KxGxYR as a retention signal in the TGN, we tried to\ntransfer this signal on a protein expressed at the cell surface. We used CD4 as\na reporter; however, the chimeric proteins that were constructed presented\nfolding defects (data not shown). CD4 is a type-I transmembrane protein, whereas\nthe M protein has a very different architecture with three transmembrane\nsegments. Therefore, we constructed chimeras between MERS-CoV M and the M\nprotein of another coronavirus, IBV. This way, we were able to construct\nchimeras that conserved the transmembrane domain structure of the protein, which\nis likely important for the folding and localization of the protein. The IBV-M\nprotein expressed alone in cells is located in the ERGIC and\ncis-Golgi (26), so\nits localization can be distinguished from that of MERS-CoV M, using specific\ncompartment markers. In addition, it has been shown that the first transmembrane\nsegment of IBV-M is involved in the intracellular retention of the protein. The\namino acid sequences of the MERS- and IBV-M C-terminal extremity are not\nconserved and are rather different (Fig.\n7A).\n\nFirst, we constructed chimeras in which we switched the C-terminal domains of the\nproteins: MERS-M/IBV-M and IBV-M/MERS-M or IBV-M/MERS-M-KGYR. We also replaced\nthe first transmembrane segment of the MERS-M-KGYR with that of IBV-M to test\nwhether the first transmembrane segment of IBV-M can retain MERS-M-KGYR\nintracellularly (TM1-IBV/MERS-M-KGYR). Finally, we replaced the first\ntransmembrane segment of IBV-M with that of MERS-CoV M. Schematic drawings of\nthe different chimeras that were constructed are presented in Fig. 7B. The subcellular\nlocalization of the chimeric proteins was then analyzed by fluorescence\nmicroscopy. As shown in Fig. 8, the\nimmunofluorescent staining of IBV-M and MERS-CoV M differed in their pattern,\nwith a compact perinuclear staining for MERS-CoV M and a punctuated staining for\nIBV-M. Co-localization assessment of IBV-M with TGN46 and ERGIC-53 showed that\nthe protein mainly localizes within the ERGIC. The MERS-M/IBV-M protein\ncolocalized with the ERGIC-53 marker and not the TGN46 marker, and is thus\nlocated in the ERGIC (Fig.\n8C), whereas the IBV-M/MERS-M protein colocalized\nwith the TGN46 marker and not with the ERGIC-53 marker and is thus localized in\nthe TGN. In other words, the switch of the C-terminal domains of the IBV-M and\nMERS-CoV M proteins caused a switch of their specific localizations, to the\nERGIC and the TGN, respectively. Interestingly, the IBV-M/MERS-KGYR protein\nlocalized to the cell surface, confirming the role of the KxGxYR signal in the\nspecific localization of the MERS-M protein to the TGN. This result also\nsuggests that the first transmembrane segment of IBV-M is not able to retain\nMERS-M-KGYR intracellularly. In accordance with this result, the chimera\nTM1-IBV/MERS-M-KGYR was also located at the cell surface, and the chimera\nTM1-MERS/IBV-M was located in the ERGIC compartment. These results are\nunexpected based on previous reports on the role of the first transmembrane\nsegment of IBV-M in its intracellular retention. Moreover, these results\nindicate that for both MERS-CoV M and IBV-M, the presence of the C-terminal\ndomain is critical to induce the specific localization of the protein.\nFurthermore, we also confirmed the involvement of the KxGxYR signal in the\nspecific retention of MERS-CoV M to the TGN, even in the chimeric context.\n\nViruses divert the intracellular trafficking machinery, and studying the\nintracellular trafficking of viral membrane proteins often helps to decipher the\nmechanisms of protein sorting and leads to uncovering new sorting motifs. We\ninvestigated the intracellular trafficking of the MERS-CoV M protein and identified\na well-known ER export signal. In addition, we identified a novel TGN retention\nmotif.\n\nSpecific targeting of viral structural proteins to the assembly site in the cell is\ncrucial for viral egress and spreading. The three envelope proteins of coronaviruses\nE, M, and S are synthesized in the ER. Protein exit from the ER toward the Golgi\noccurs at specific sites called ER exit sites and for most of the proteins relies on\nthe coat protein complex II (COPII). Assembly of the coat starts with the activation\nof the GTPase Sar1 by Sec12, an integral ER guanine nucleotide exchange factor. This\nallows the recruitment of the complex Sec23/24, forming the inner layer of the coat\nfollowed by the recruitment of the outer layer of the coat formed by Sec13/31 (30). ER export signals, including LxxLE,\ndiacidic DxE, YNNSNP, or triple R, can interact directly with Sec24 or Sar1 and lead\nto the recruitment of the COPII carriers (31). We identified a functional DxE motif in the C-terminal part of the\nMERS-CoV M protein, and this signal is also present in the M protein of the porcine\nepidemic diarrhea virus. Some Alpha- and\nGammacoronavirus M proteins, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63,\nFIPV, or IBV, contain a diacidic ExE motif; however, it remains to be determined\nwhether these signals can also act as ER export signal because, in the yeast protein\nSys1p, ExE cannot compensate for the DxE signal (32).\n\nAfter its exit from the ER, the MERS-CoV M protein reaches the Golgi, where the\nprotein undergoes further modification of its N-glycans, as shown\nin our glycosidase resistance assays. As shown previously for MHV-M protein, we and\nothers (33) found that ectopically expressed\nMERS-CoV M protein is mainly located in the TGN at steady state. In the cells, the\nTGN is a sorting station where proteins are either sent to the cell surface or\ndiverted toward other endomembrane compartments. The localization of proteins in\nspecific biosynthetic compartments generally results from an equilibrium between\nanterograde and retrograde movements of the proteins. For example, in\nimmunofluorescent labeling of the protein TGN38/46, the protein is located in the\nTGN, but this localization is the consequence of a very dynamic process in which the\nprotein is transported to the plasma membrane and recycled back to the TGN after\ninternalization and sorting in endosomes. The SDYQRL motif in the C-terminal domain\nof the protein is important for its retrieval from the cell surface (34). In addition, the transmembrane domain of\nthe protein also participates in the TGN localization of the protein by mediating\nsome retention in the TGN (35). An increase\nof the transport of the protein to the cell surface can lead to the saturation of\nthe retrieval mechanism of the protein and its accumulation at the cell surface.\n\nHere, we identified a KxGxYR motif in the MERS-CoV M protein that is involved in the\nTGN localization of the protein. The mutation of any residue of this motif leads to\nthe accumulation of the protein at the plasma membrane. This signal is highly\nconserved in the M proteins of Betacoronavirus. Interestingly,\nArmstrong and Patel (36) previously reported\nthat deletion of the last 18 residues of the C-terminal domain of the MHV-M protein\ninduced a shift of the protein localization toward the cell surface. Interestingly,\nthis deletion is in the middle of the KxGxYR signal, leaving only the Lys and Gly\nresidues on the truncated protein. In another study, Locker et al.\n(27) also reported a deletion of 22\nresidues of the protein, leading to the accumulation of the protein at the cell\nsurface. Furthermore, in their study about the structural requirements of MHV-M\nprotein, De Haan et al. (11)\nmentioned that one of their mutants containing a mutation of the KxGxYR motif\n(Y211G) leaked to the cell surface. These data suggest that TGN localization of M\nproteins may be a general feature of the betacoronaviruses and that the KxGxYR motif\nis involved in this localization. It has been reported that the SARS-CoV M protein\nis located in the Golgi; unfortunately, its precise localization within the Golgi\nremains unclear (37, 38).\n\nLocker et al. (39) reported\nthat oligomerization of MHV-M protein is involved in the TGN retention of the\nprotein; however, our results show that it is unlikely that the KxGxYR motif is\ninvolved in the oligomerization of the protein. As a small proportion of the\nMERS-CoV M protein could be detected at the cell surface (less than 1% of the total\nprotein; see Fig. 6, A and\nB), we tested whether the KxGxYR motif could be an endocytosis\nmotif. The MERS-CoV M protein is retrieved from the cell surface by endocytosis;\nhowever, we could not detect any defect of endocytosis of the M protein when the\nKxGxYR motif was mutated (Fig. 6,\nE and F). This result argues against an\nendocytic function of this motif and suggests a role as a retention signal. Indeed,\nit was reported previously (27) that the\nMHV-M protein does not cycle between the plasma membrane of the cell and the TGN but\nrather acts as a TGN-resident protein. Another hypothesis is a cycle of the M\nbetween the ER and the TGN with the KxGxYR motif acting as a retrieval signal from\nthe TGN to the ER. The mutation of this signal would inhibit the retrieval of the\nprotein, allowing its trafficking to the cell surface. The retrograde trafficking\nensures the constant recycling of proteins and lipids from the Golgi to the ER to\nmaintain their steady-state distribution and the composition and function of the\norganelles themselves. Two distinct mechanisms are responsible for this retrograde\ntransport. The first one depends on the coat protein complex I (COPI), and the\nsecond one is the COPI-independent pathway that is less characterized, involves the\nRab6 GTPase, and is composed of tubular rather than vesicular carriers (40). The formation of the COPI-coated vesicles\nstarts with the recruitment en bloc of the coatomer composed of seven subunits by\nthe Arf1 GTPase. Cargos carry specific signals in their cytosolic-exposed domain\nmediating their recruitment by COPI. The best characterized motifs are the di-lysine\nmotifs KKxx or KxKxx that are recognized by the \u03b1-COP or \u03b2\u2032-COP\nsubunit of the coatomer. Multimeric proteins, such as receptors or channels, contain\nan arginine-based sorting signal (\u03c6RxR, where \u03c6 represents any\nhydrophobic amino acid). A common feature of the motif involved in the protein\nsorting toward the COPI-dependent pathway is the presence of basic residues. Because\nof its content in basic residues, the KxGxYR motif might be recognized by the COPI\nmachinery to prevent its cell surface expression.\n\nNevertheless, the mechanism of action of the KxGxYR motif remains to be further\nelucidated, particularly in the context of the viral infection. Indeed, the\nretention of the protein may be important for the proper assembly of the viral\nparticle by promoting interaction with the other viral membrane components. How the\ninteraction with E or S may mask the KxGxYR retention signal or how these protein\ncomplexes may further traffic through the biosynthetic pathway remains to be\nclarified.\n\nFurthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that other domains of the protein may\nalso be implicated in the TGN localization of the protein. As mentioned above, the\ntransmembrane domain and an endocytic motif cooperate for the proper localization of\nTGN38/46. The Golgi apparatus is a compartmentalized structure where glycosylation\noccurs in an ordered process (41). The\nsuccessful completion of glycosylation relies in part on the proper distribution of\nglycosyltransferases along the Golgi that will permit their action in a sequential\nmanner. Most of the glycosyltransferases are type II transmembrane proteins. They\nconsist of a short N-terminal domain exposed in the cytosol, a transmembrane domain,\na stem region, and an enzymatic domain. The nonuniform distribution of these enzymes\nin the Golgi is likely maintained by a combination of retention and recycling\nmechanisms (42). The mechanisms that ensure\nthe localization of glycosyltransferases in the Golgi are numerous and diverse.\nThese include the oligomerization status of the enzyme and complex formation, the\nlength of the transmembrane domain but also its composition, which may affect the\nway it is interacting with the different lipid compositions that the protein\nencounters in the different Golgi cisternae. The cytosolic domains also contain\nmotifs involved in the localization of the enzymes (42).\n\nTo confirm the role of the KxGxYR motif as a retention signal in the TGN, we\nattempted to transfer the motif in CD4, a protein expressed at the plasma membrane.\nUnfortunately, the different chimeras that we constructed were not folded properly.\nThis was likely due to the difference of protein structures, CD4 being a type I\ntransmembrane protein, whereas MERS-CoV M is a triple membrane-spanning protein.\nTherefore, to further confirm the role of the KxGxYR motif, we constructed chimeras\nbetween MERS-CoV M and IBV-M, as they show clear differences in subcellular\nlocalization at steady state. Indeed, IBV-M is mainly expressed in the ERGIC and\ncis-Golgi compartment. Previous studies reported the role of\nthe first transmembrane segment in the intracellular retention of the protein (26). This was shown by the replacement of the\ntransmembrane domain of the glycoprotein G of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVG)\nwith the first transmembrane segment of IBV-M, which resulted in the intracellular\nretention of the protein, and four polar residues were shown to mediate this\nretention (25). Surprisingly, when we\nreplaced the first membrane-spanning domain of MERS-CoV M with that of IBV-M in the\ncontext where the KxGxYR motif is mutated into alanine residues\n(TM1-IBV/MERS-M-KGYR), the protein was not located in the ERGIC but was still\ntransported to the cell surface. This difference may lie in the use of a full-length\ncoronavirus M protein instead of a reporter protein such as VSVG. Interestingly,\nwhen we swapped the C-terminal domains of the proteins, we also switched their\nspecific localizations, suggesting that the IBV-M C-terminal domain contains a\nsignal(s) for the ERGIC localization of the protein and not the first membrane\nsegment as reported previously.\n\nAltogether, our results suggest that the C-terminal domain of coronavirus M proteins\ndictates their specific localization, the betacoronavirus M proteins being addressed\nto the TGN, where they are retained by the action of the KxGxYR motif. The motif\nmediating IBV-M localization in the ERGIC and cis-Golgi compartment\nremains, however, to be determined. At this state of knowledge, we cannot exclude\nthe possibility that the membrane-spanning segments of the protein additionally\nparticipate in the intracellular retention of these proteins and cooperate with the\nC-terminal domain to prevent the expression of the protein at the cell surface.\n\nThe coding sequence of the M protein was cloned in the pCDNA3.1(+) vector, with\nor without a sequence coding for different tags, including HA, VSVG, and V5.\nTotal RNA from blood samples of an infected patient were extracted by using the\nNucleospin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. Then reverse transcription was performed using the high-capacity\ncDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems), and the M protein sequence\nwas amplified by two successive PCRs. First, the sequence was amplified by using\nthe two following primers: 5\u2032-gacgagtgggtttaacgaact-3\u2032 and\n5\u2032-ggggatgccataacaatgaaa-3\u2032. Then, to insert the sequence in\nexpression vectors, the sequence was amplified with\n5\u2032-tcggatccaccatgtctaatatgacgcaactcactg-3\u2032 (primer A) and\n5\u2032cagaattcctaagctcgaagcaatgcaa-3\u2032 (primer B; untagged protein) or\nby combination of primer A and\n5\u2032-tagaattcagctcgaagcaatgcaagttcaat-3\u2032 (primer C; C-terminal\ntagged protein) or with 5\u2032-acggatccaatatgacgcaactcactgagg-3\u2032\n(primer D) with primer B (N-terminal tagged protein). PCR products were inserted\nbetween the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the different vectors.\n\nM protein deletion mutants were generated by PCR by using either primer A or D in\ncombination with a reverse primer annealing at different positions of the M\nsequence, with or without a stop codon with an EcoRI restriction site. M protein\npoint mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR. Overlapping\nprimers containing the mutation(s) of interest were designed and used for PCR on\na MERS-M WT template. PCRs were then gel-purified, digested, and cloned into a\npCDNA3.1-VSVG or pCDNA3.1-HA plasmid. The chimeric constructions were generated\nby fusion PCR. For IBV-M/MERS-M-Ct, the sequence of IBV-M corresponding to\nresidues 1\u2013101 were amplified with the forward primer\n5\u2032-ttaagctttccatgcccaacgagacaaattg-3\u2032 and the reverse primer\n5\u2032-taaacagccgaatactctggatccaataac-3\u2032, containing 10 bases\ncomplementary to the MERS-M sequence at its 5\u2032 extremity. The MERS-M\nsequence between residues 100 and 219 was amplified by PCR using the forward\nprimer 5\u2032-ccagagtATTcggctgtttatgagaactgg-3\u2032 containing 10 bases\ncomplementary to the IBV-M sequence and with the primer D. Then the two PCR\nproducts were mixed and amplified using the forward primer that anneals the\nIBV-M sequence and the primer D. Using the same strategy of overlapping\nsequences for the internal primers, we constructed MERS-M/IBV-M-Ct composed of\nthe MERS-M1\u2013102 fused to IBV-M105\u2013225. The\nfirst transmembrane segment of the MERS-M-KGYR was replaced by the first\ntransmembrane segment of IBV-M by fusing IBV-M1\u201342 to\nMERS-M-KGYR41\u2013219 (TM1-IBV/MERS-M-KGYR), and the first\ntransmembrane segment of IBV-M was replaced by the first transmembrane segment\nof MERS-M by fusing MERS-M1\u201340 to\nIBV-M43\u2013225 (TM1-MERS/IBV-M). The PCR products were\ngel-purified and digested by BamHI and EcoRI and then inserted into the\npCDNA3.1-V5 expression vector. All of the constructs were verified by DNA\nsequencing.\n\nThe plasmids coding the ERGIC-53 protein fused to the GFP and coding the\nGFP-CI-MPR were kindly provided by Dr. Hauri (University of Basel) and Dr.\nHoflack (University of Dresden) respectively. The plasmid encoding the CD4-GFP\nfusion protein was constructed by amplification of the GFP with the two primers\n5\u2032-AGACATGTAGCCCCATTGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCT-3\u2032 and\n5\u2032-GGGTCGACTCACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC-3\u2032 and then inserted into the\nPCI-CD4 between the AflIII and SalI restriction sites.\n\nHeLa cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10%\nfetal calf serum and 1% Glutamax. 24 h before transfection, HeLa cells were\nplated in 24-well plates on coverslips or in 6-well plates. The next day,\nplasmids encoding WT M protein or M mutant protein were transfected into HeLa\ncells using TransIT\u00ae-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio).\n\nAt 18 h post-transfection, cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 3% PFA, and\nprocessed for immunofluorescence analysis. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1%\nTriton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and then blocked with buffer containing 10% goat\nor horse serum in PBS for 10 min. M protein was detected using anti-M pAbs\n(rabbit, Proteogenix) or anti-tag antibodies: anti-HA mAbs (3F10,\nSigma-Aldrich), anti-VSVG mAbs (P5D4, produced in the laboratory of the\nauthors), or anti-V5 mAbs (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For co-localization\nexperiments, cells were double-labeled for M-proteins and cellular marker,\nanti-CRT pAbs for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and anti-TGN46 pAbs for TGN\n(Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. In some cases,\nintracellular compartments were stained by transfecting an expression vector for\na marker fused with GFP. For ERGIC and TGN compartments, cells were\nco-transfected with M proteins and expression vectors for ERGIC53 and M6PR fused\nto GFP, respectively. For cell surface staining, cells were transfected with a\nvector expressing CD4 fused to GFP. After a 30-min incubation with primary\nantibodies, cells were washed three times for 5 min with PBS. Then the cells\nwere incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies\n(cyanine-3\u2013conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG; cyanine-3\u2013conjugated\ngoat anti-rabbit IgG; Alexa 488\u2013conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG;\ncyanine-3\u2013conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG; Alexa 488\u2013conjugated\ndonkey anti-mouse IgG; Alexa 555\u2013conjugated goat anti-rat IgG) and 1\n\u03bcg/ml 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.\n\nImages were acquired using a laser-scanning confocal microscope LSM 880 (Zeiss)\nusing a \u00d763 oil immersion objective. Signals were sequentially collected\nusing single fluorescence excitation and acquisition settings to avoid\ncrossover.\n\nThe extent of colocalization was quantified by calculating the PCC using the\nJACoP plugin of ImageJ. The PCC examines the relationship between the\nintensities of the pixels of two channels in the same image. For each\ncalculation, at least 15 images were analyzed to obtain a PCC mean. A PCC of 1\nindicates perfect correlation, 0 no correlation, and \u22121 perfect\nanti-correlation.\n\nHeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected the next day with\npCDNA3.1-V5-N3Q-M, pCDNA3.1-V5-N3Q-M\u039420, pCDNA3.1-V5-N3Q-M-D211A,E213A,\npCDNA3.1-V5-N3Q-M-K199A,G201A,Y203A,R204A, PCDNA3.1-V5-N3Q-M-K199A,\npCDNA3.1-V5-N3Q-M-G201A, pCDNA3.1-V5-N3Q-M-Y203A, or pCDNA3.1-V5-N3Q-M-R204A. At\n24 h post-transfection, cells were rinsed on ice with ice-cold PBS and incubated\ntwice with 250 \u03bcg/ml EZ-LinkTM Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce)\ndiluted in PBS for 15 min to label cell surface proteins. Unfixed biotin was\nthen quenched by two sequential incubations of the cells for 10 min with 50\nmm glycine/PBS.\n\nFor internalization assays, cells were biotinylated 48 h post-transfection and\nthen incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The biotin of nonendocytosed proteins\nwas then cleaved upon three incubations of 20 min with GSH buffer (50\nmm reduced GSH, 75 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, 10% fetal\ncalf serum) followed by two incubations of 15 min with iodoacetamide buffer (50\nmm iodoacetamide, 1% BSA, PBS).\n\nCells were then lysed with B1 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100\nmm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, protease\ninhibitor mixture) on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C\nfor 5 min to remove cellular debris and were then incubated with 30 \u03bcl of\nstreptavidin-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h. Beads were then washed\nserially with 1 ml of buffers B1, B2 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100\nmm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.5%\ndeoxycholate), B3 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2\nmm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100), and B4 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5,\n100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA). Proteins were resuspended in Laemmli\nloading buffer and detected by immunoblotting. Samples were separated by\nSDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham\nBiosciences). Membrane-bound M proteins were then detected using a monoclonal\nanti-V5 antibody and horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary\nantibody. Detection was carried out by chemiluminescence (Pierce).\n\nHeLa cells were transfected with vectors expressing V5-M, V5-M-DxE, V5-M-KGYR, or\nV5-N3Q-M proteins. 24 h later, cells were lysed in B1 buffer. Then, 30 \u03bcl\nof lysates were mock-treated or treated with PNGase F or endoglycosidase H\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions. Then proteins were separated on\nSDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting.\n\nHeLa cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and transfected with vectors expressing\nV5-N3Q-M or V5-N3Q-M-KGYR. The next day, cell surface proteins were biotinylated\nat 4 \u00b0C and cross-linked with 0.8% PFA in PBS for 10 min. Then PFA was\nquenched by washing the cells with 50 mm NH4CL/PBS twice.\nCells were lysed with B1 buffer, and lysates were processed for streptavidin\nprecipitation as described previously. Proteins were resuspended in nonreducing\nLaemmli loading buffer without heating and detected by immunoblotting.\n\nA. P. and S. B. formal analysis; A. P., A. B., L. D., A. D., and S.
