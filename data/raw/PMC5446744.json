{"title": "Attitudes of consumers and live-poultry workers to central slaughtering in controlling H7N9: a cross-sectional study", "body": "From 2013 to 2015, three major outbreaks of a newly-emerged avian influenza A (H7N9) virus occurred in China, creating a serious human health threat [1\u20133]. The first outbreak of the deadly infectious disease took place in Shanghai [1], and then occurrences spread to eastern, northern, and southern China [3] and far west areas such as Xinjiang [4]. By the end of 2015, China had reported a total of 667 H7N9 human cases with 269 deaths from over 15 provinces [5]. Most patients suffered from severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome [6]. The clinical manifestation of H7N9 was worse than previous human H7 cases where mild/moderate cases were reported [7]. Some H7N9 cases reported a history of exposure to live poultry [8], leading to immediate suspicion of an avian reservoir as the origin of human infections. Avian-origin was further proven by Gao et al. [6] who used polymerase-chain-reaction assays, viral culturing, and sequence analyses to confirm the association between human infectious cases and reassortant H7N9 viruses. Risk factors for zoonotic H7N9 infection included physical contact with infected poultry or breathing in of contaminated aerosols/droplets [9]. Common physical contact included slaughtering, defeathering, or preparing sick poultry for cooking, handling diseased or dead poultry, and consuming raw or undercooked fowl products [10].\n\nThis emerging avian influenza virus threatens human health in Guangdong, which is one of the provinces that have had H7N9 confirmed cases. From 2013 to 2015, Guangdong experienced severe H7N9 outbreaks, and coping strategies were launched in late 2014 after risk factors concerning the disease outbreak were studied. By the end of 2015, a total of 183 cases with 67 deaths were reported by the Health Department of Guangdong Province [11]. A risk factor of concern was the Cantonese preference for shopping at live-poultry markets for live fowl or its products [12]. Cantonese residents are the original or native-born residents in Guangdong and this population sub-group shares a similar culture, dietary habits, and social preferences when compared with populations in other parts of China [13]. Live fowl was usually slaughtered on site or brought back for home slaughter as Cantonese commonly believe that live poultry slaughtered upon purchase preserves freshness and flavour [14]. Live-poultry markets therefore play a crucial role in poultry-to-human transmission [15]. To validate this point, researchers have isolated H7N9 from environmental swab samples collected at live-poultry markets [16]. Laboratory tests then further confirmed avian influenza A virus\u2019s ability to sustain, replicate, and disseminate at these markets [17, 18]. Clinical and epidemiological results indicated that live-poultry markets serve as a possible reservoir for avian influenza virus [15] and have placed market workers [19] as well as consumers at risk for contracting the avian influenza virus [16]. Due to the severity of H7N9 outbreaks in 2013\u20132014, the local preference for purchasing live fowl, and the high risk of virus exposure, the government of Guangdong Province announced a new policy on the central slaughtering of live poultry in late 2014. The Central Slaughtering of Live Poultry Policy (CSLPP) was officially set to take effect in the 21 cities in Guangdong Province on January 15, 2015 [20]. The CSLPP is a comprehensive policy combining several previously-proven biosecurity measures with some unconfirmed measures. Though policy regulations are consistent across the entire province, their implementation is determined by prefecture-level governments. Implementation priorities are given to the cities within the Pearl River Delta region to set \u2018Leadership Cities\u2019 for the whole province (Fig. 1). However, broader knowledge of influential factors of attitudes toward policy is lacking at prefecture levels and thus it is important to address these issues before further implementation of the CSLPP is carried out. General information on the CSLPP can be found in Table 1 and on the government website [20].\n\n\n\nBecause the CSLPP is a new policy, questions still need to be answered on perceptions and attitudes of this policy among general consumers and poultry workers. Although a previous paper assessed consumers\u2019 attitudes toward central slaughtering, its findings were confined to the city of Guangzhou [21], and further work is needed to determine if those findings can be extrapolated to other parts of Guangdong Province. Also, influential factors of public acceptance of the CSLPP require further study for the successful long-term implementation of the policy. Therefore, the current study aims to assess and better understand the acceptability of the CSLPP and its influential factors among consumers and live-poultry workers on a larger scale in Guangdong Province.\n\nWe defined the population of consumers as those who lived in Guangdong and had once purchased or consumed live-poultry products. Consumers of live-poultry products living in the 15 cities were recruited as participants for the study. In sampling consumers, we adopted both field and online recruitment (Additional file 1: Table S1). Field surveys were carried out in Guangzhou, Foshan, and Shenzhen, where we deployed our trained interviewers at market entrances and randomly selected consumers as they entered. The markets were also randomly selected. Consumers were asked if they or their family had purchased live poultry before (screening question). We further investigated consumers who gave a positive reply and expressed willingness to participate in the survey. To recruit consumers in other cities, notices about the questionnaire were posted on WeChat, including a link to an external survey website where participants were able to click on and fill out the questionnaire. The trained interviewers used the same screening question above to identify potential participants in their chat-groups and randomly selected target participants. They sent WeChat notices to target participants. Interviewers also provided online survey instructions to participants to ensure the validity of the online surveys. In the end, 1506 consumers completed questionnaires, but only 1449 (96.2%) consumers lived in the selected cities and were thus considered appropriate for analysis.\n\nWe defined the population of live-poultry workers as those who worked either at live-poultry markets or poultry farms in Guangdong. Live-poultry workers either at live-poultry markets or poultry farms in the 15 cities were recruited as participants for the study. Field surveys were conducted in the investigation of live-poultry workers. For different sub-groups of live-poultry workers, we conducted random sampling in different locations. Live-poultry traders were sampled and surveyed at live-poultry markets, while poultry farm workers were surveyed at poultry farms. Live-poultry markets and poultry farms were randomly selected in each city. We approached all live-poultry traders and poultry farm workers at each live-poultry market and poultry farm. A quick on-site review of the questionnaires was conducted to ensure data validity. A total of 181 (100.0%) live-poultry traders and 114 (100.0%) poultry farm workers completed the questionnaires. (All 181 and 114 samples are considered appropriate for data analysis because the enrollment requirement for each sample was satisfied.) Additional information on sampling strategies and power analysis can be found in Additional file 1: Table S2.\n\nA separate questionnaire was developed for live-poultry farm workers, live-poultry traders and consumers of live-poultry products (Questionnaires are provided in Additional file Q1, Q2, Q3). The questionnaires were designed after review of the policy and previous research [14, 22]. We conducted a pilot survey in the city of Guangzhou and also consulted field experts to ensure the validity of the questionnaires.\n\nAll questionnaires covered a range of four dimensions. The first dimension began with demographic questions, such as age, sex, and local resident status of the respondent. Other questions, depending on their respondent type, were included for background information on their experience with live poultry. The second dimension evaluated knowledge and perceptions of avian flu. We converted choice-results into scores where each correct answer was counted as one point for a total score of 12. The third dimension explored the perceptions of the CSLPP including whether they had heard of the CSLPP and the source of their hearing about the policy. Other questions, depending on their respondent type, were included for background information on their perception with the CSLPP. The final dimension assessed influential factors on attitudes toward the CSLPP. The whether-or-not questions were either binary (yes/no) or ternary (yes/no/no idea). (Additional file 1: Table S3) Attitude item was a three-level ordinal outcome variable. Disapproval of the CSLPP was the lowest level, indifference to the policy the middle, and acceptability the highest.\n\nDescriptive statistics were derived from each questionnaire. Consumers and live-poultry workers were analysed separately. Poultry traders and farm workers were analysed as a group, with farm worker and trader status being included as a possible explanatory variable. The sum-up score of knowledge on avian flu was converted into a three-level knowledge variable. A chi-squared test was used in the univariate analyses to compare the indicators between regions. Proportional odds logistics regressions were conducted in the univariate and multivariate analyses to explore contributions of demographic variables, attitude variables, and knowledge variables to acceptability of the CSLPP. Initial variables for model selection were listed in Additional file 1: Tables S6 and S7, and final variables were selected based on Akaike information criterion (AIC). Odds ratio (OR) lower than one indicated disapproval of the policy. All statistical analyses were computed by R version 3.2.3, and P < 0.05 indicated statistical significance.\n\nThe sociodemographic characteristics of participants are listed in Table 2. Sampled consumers and live-poultry workers had an average age of 25 years (SD 13.0) and 41 years (SD 9.0), respectively. For consumers sampled, over 30% resided in Guangzhou and 77.5% lived in the Pearl River Delta region, but most reported being native-born Cantonese (80.0%). As for the sub-groups of live-poultry workers, most live-poultry traders sold chicken (97.2%) and ducks (84.0%) and their sales volume in median was 30 per day. Over a half (64.8%) of the live-poultry traders surveyed worked in the Pearl River Delta region. Most poultry farm workers bred chicken for commercial trading (89.6%) and some bred ducks (10.4%). Also, participating poultry farm workers reported that their cities had once reported confirmed cases of the avian influenza virus (36.8%), and that their farms had a trade volume of 100,000 or more per year (77.0%) and a business history of over 5 years (58.9%). A total of 64.7% of surveyed farm workers worked in the non-Pearl River Delta region.\n\n\nThis study found that 58.5% of consumers knew about the CSLPP. (Additional file 1: Table S4) Among those who had heard of the policy, 57.1% expressed support for the policy, 26.5% were indifferent to the policy, and 16.4% disapproved of the policy. This study also summarized policy acceptability of consumers across cities. (Additional file 1: Table S5) Over half (52.4%) of consumers in Guangzhou supported the policy. Univariate analysis of concerning factors (Additional file 1: Table S6) showed that consumers who raised an objection to the CSLPP might possess the following traits: native-born Cantonese, (family) preference to purchase live poultry slaughtered on site, not believing in the food safety of chilled poultry products, etc.\n\nFor live-poultry workers, while most knew about the policy (92.6%) and also understood its purpose (96.7%), acceptability differed within sub-groups. For live-poultry traders, 37.9% supported the policy but 45.4% disapproved of the policy. For poultry farm workers, 62.6% supported the policy and 11.1% disapproved of the policy. The remaining were indifferent to the policy (16.6% and 26.3% for live-poultry traders and poultry farm workers, respectively). A total of 69.5% of live-poultry traders complained about the inconvenience caused by the CSLPP where only 24.2% of poultry farm workers complained about inconvenience (Table 3). Univariate analysis was used to explore lower acceptability among live-poultry traders, and significant factors include: being an employer, loss in trading volume, given subsidies, inconvenience induced by the CSLPP, and low scores on knowledge of avian flu, etc. (Additional file 1: Table S7).\n\n\nTo further explore the influential factors of acceptability toward the policy in the previous univariate analysis, multivariate analyses were conducted among participating consumers and sub-groups of live-poultry workers. Table 4 shows the variables in the final proportional odds logistics regression models. In the consumer model, 15 variables were selected and the rest were screened out based on AIC values of the models. Some major influential variables leading to disapproval of the policy include: being a male, being a native Cantonese, preferring live poultry, etc. In the model for live-poultry traders, six variables entered the model. Live-poultry traders tended to disapprove of the policy if they: a) were males; b) were subsidized by the government; c) experienced a drop in trading volume; and d) were unclear whether avian flu was a preventable disease. Finally, poultry farm workers tended not to support if they: a) experienced a drop in trading volume; b) operated a poultry farm on a small to medium scale, and c) experienced inconvenience to their work due to the policy.\n\n\nThe government should continue to disseminate the robust detail and positive influence of the CSLPP via public-welcomed methods including TV shows, magazine articles and advertisements, and community billboards. Alternatively, people should be educated about the cold-chains for chilled products and be taught about the procedures that help prevent pre-processed meats from bacterial infection. Through these efforts, people\u2019s uninformed opinions on chilled products may undergo a change, and they may realize the significance of the policy to their health.\n\nA reform of the subsidy policy and enhancement of the satisfaction of live-poultry traders should become an important agenda. Extra support should be given to live-poultry workers to cover the potential loss of customers and drop in profits. Bonuses should also be granted to live-poultry workers for their contribution to implementation of the CSLPP. Also, both provincial and prefecture governments should rethink the strategy of fiscal allocation so that a subsidy system could become a government-run insurance and support system for live-poultry traders in the long run.\n\nThe policy-maker should never expect quick results from the CSLPP, and special attention should be given to the areas where public objection to the CSLPP is strong. To deal with objections, we suggest small trial zones be set up. In these small trial zones, the government should practice the CSLPP in several steps. Local residents should be given the time that is needed to adjust their attitudes and behaviors. But it is also important that they be educated about the flu, most especially during times of outbreak, so that the effect of education and promotion can be strengthened.\n\nThis study concludes that acceptability of the policy among live-poultry traders is low and divergent within sub-groups of live-poultry workers. Possible reasons for low acceptability among live-poultry traders include: the drop in trading volume, the insufficient subsidy offered by the government, and the misconception about avian flu. Concern about food safety and dietary preference are two major reasons for disapproval of the policy among consumers. These findings are crucial to the prevention of human-infected H7N9 cases in Guangdong Province."}
