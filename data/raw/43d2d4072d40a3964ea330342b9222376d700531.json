{"title": "Lassa fever in travelers from West Africa", "body": "We identified a case of fatal acute respiratory disease from household transmission of human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) in Anhui Province, China. Computed tomography showed severe pneumonia. Comparative genomic analysis of HAdV-55 indicated the virus possibly originated in Shanxi Province, China. More attention should be paid to highly contagious HAdV-55.\n\nH uman adenoviruses are associated with mild and acute respiratory infections, depending on the virus type and host immunity. Human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) (1), formerly known as HAdV-11a (2) , is a reemergent respiratory pathogen that has caused severe pneumonia outbreaks in military and civilian populations in Europe and Asia (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . However, household transmission of HAdV-55 is rarely reported. We report a case of household transmission of HAdV-55 involving 3 confirmed adult cases with 1 death. Epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory investigations, along with whole-genome sequencing, elucidate the disease progression and the pathogen origin.\n\nDuring April 1-May 5, 2012, 7 household members (5 males and 2 females; 3 children and 4 adults) in Anhui Province, China, sequentially experienced influenza-like symptoms, including fever, productive cough, fatigue, pharyngalgia, dyspnea, and other symptoms. The youngest patient was 4 months of age, the oldest, whom we refer to as AQ-1, was a 55-year-old man. The family lived together near a farm in a house with poor sanitary and ventilation conditions.\n\nThe first onset of acute respiratory disease (ARD) occurred on April 1, when the index case, a 4-year-old granddaughter of AQ-1, had a febrile respiratory infection with cough. Three days later, AQ-1's grandson, 1 year of age, displayed similar symptoms. On April 9 and 11, AQ-1's daughter, 28 years of age, and another grandson, 4 months of age, both had influenza-like symptoms. On April 14, AQ-1 had a fever, chills, and lumbago. He was admitted to the hospital on April 14 where clinicians diagnosed pneumonia. AQ-1 had close contact with his sick grandsons and granddaughter and had not been out of the house during the month he cared for them.\n\nWhile hospitalized, AQ-1 had bilateral pneumonia seen on chest computed tomography (CT), a temperature of 41.0\u00b0C, and low total leukocyte (3.63 \u00d7 10 9 /L) and platelet (42 \u00d7 10 9 /L) counts. AQ-1 sustained high fever and yellow phlegm despite antiinflammatory and antiviral treatment, including levofloxacin, piperacillin sodium, tazobactam sodium, and ribavirin.\n\nOn April 24, AQ-1 had indications of severe pneumonia, including respiratory failure, hypoxemia, double lung rales, and a mass of shadows visible on chest CT. In addition, he had indications of liver damage and multi-organ failure. Transverse chest CT images demonstrated increased areas of patchy shadows and consolidation in both lungs compared to CT images from April 22, indicative of disease progression (Appendix Figure 1 , http://wwwnc. cdc.gov/EID/article/25/9/18-1937-App1.pdf).\n\nAQ-1 died on April 27, 3 days after onset of respiratory failure, and 13 days after his illness began. On the same day, his 20-year-old son, AQ-2, and 31-year-old nephew, AQ-3, who had taken care of AQ-1 for 5 days, also exhibited symptoms of influenza-like illness. Both were hospitalized and had normal chest CT scans, but AQ-2's leukocyte count was 5.4 \u00d7 10 9 /L and AQ-3's was 6.7 \u00d7 10 9 /L. After antiinflammatory and antiviral treatment, including vitamin C, sulbactam, amoxicillin, amikacin, cefoperazone, ribavirin, and oseltamivir, they recovered and were discharged on May 5 (Figure) .\n\nWe tested endotracheal aspirates from AQ-1 and throat swabs from AQ-2 and AQ-3 for influenza A and B viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, and HAdVs by real-time PCR. Only adenovirus was strongly positive for all 3 patients. Testing for antibodies against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis Treponema pallidum, hepatitis B and C viruses, and HIV were all negative. After treatment, samples from AQ-2 and AQ-3, were negative for adenovirus by PCR.\n\nWe isolated AQ-1's adenovirus in culture and sequenced the genome (GenBank accession no. KP279748). Sequences for the hexon, penton base, and fiber genes were identical to those previously reported for HAdV-55. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 3 isolates clustered closely with other strains from China (Appendix Figure 2) . The genome of AQ-1's strain had the highest nucleotide identity (99.951%) with QZ01_2011, an isolate from a military trainee in Shanxi Province, China. The second highest identity (99.948%) was with QS-DLL_2006, which caused a fatal ARD outbreak in a senior high school in Shaanxi Province, China (1,8) (Appendix Table) . We hypothesize the strain infecting AQ-1 and his family originated from Shanxi Province.\n\nIn this household transmission of ARD, the index case was a probable case because no specimens were collected to confirm virologic identification. From the timeline of illness onset in this household cluster of ARD cases (Figure) , we suspect that the pathogen spread rapidly among the children and further circulated in adults who had close contact with infected children and one another.\n\nHAdV-55 contains a 97.4% genome of HAdV-14 and a hexon from HAdV-11 (1). Since 2006, HAdV-14 has caused severe ARD in America, Europe, and Asia (8, 9) , with high hospitalization (38%) and case-fatality (5%) rates (10) . Because the risk for infection among the close contacts may rise, more attention should be paid to these highly contagious pathogens. "}
