{"title": "", "body": "146 tested their ability to interact with MxB 1-35 -MBPdi in our co-pelleting assay. Our binding results 147 pinpoint the MxB-interacting site at the tri-hexamer interface.\n\nMutations in tri-hexamer interface residues had the greatest effect on MxB binding. This 149 region of the CA lattice contains the densest concentration of negative charge, with 12 glutamate 150 residues (three copies of E71, E75, E212 and E213) creating a deep well of negative charge. In 151 the tri-hexamer interface, three sets of CA CTD residues E212 and E213 from three adjacent 152 symmetry-related monomers form the floor of this negatively charged well. MxB binding to 153 CA E213A was significantly reduced, and CA E212A/E213A drastically reduced binding to the 154 background level (Fig 2C and 2D ). The CA NTD residues E71 and E75 form the wall of the 155 negatively charged well and mutations at these sites (CA E71A and CA E75A ) also substantially 156 reduced MxB binding (Fig 2C and 2D ).\n\nMutation of residues in the di-hexamer interface has a mild effect on MxB binding. This 158 interface is present in the WT CA dimer, which showed no binding to MxB in solution in 159 previous experiments [11] . We identified glutamates E180 and E187 on helix 9 at the CTD-CTD 160 dimerization interface as responsible for the patch of negative charge between two CA hexamers. 161 Both CA E180A and CA E187A modestly affected MxB binding (Fig 2C and 2D ). This suggests they 162 do not contribute substantially to the MxB interaction.\n\nIn contrast to the effect from perturbations at the hexamer interfaces, mutation of residues 164 around the CypA-binding loop on the surface of the CA hexamer had no effect on MxB binding. 165 The most prominent region of negative charge on the hexamer surface is contributed by residue 166 E98 near the CypA-binding loop, which is not near any lattice interfaces. Consistent with our 167 interface-binding hypothesis, MxB 1-35 -MBPdi bound CA E98A tubes at a level similar to CA tubes 168 (Fig 2C and 2D ). We additionally examined the interactions of MxB 1-35 -MBPdi with CA tubes 169 having mutations in the CypA-binding loop. Since the G89V and P90A mutations have been 170 reported to affect MxB restriction in vivo and G89V has been reported to reduce MxB copelleting 171 of MxB in cell lysates with CANC tubes [6, 7, 13], we tested these two mutations in our in vitro .

Our previous work demonstrated that G89V had 173 no effect on full-length MxB pelleting [11] . Using our minimal MxB-MBPdi construct, we 174 confirmed that neither CA G89V nor CA P90A reduce the binding (Fig 2C and 2D ).\n\n175 Tri-hexamer interface mutations that escape MxB restriction also abolish MxB 1-35 -MBPdi 176 binding 177 Three mutations at the tri-hexamer interface (P207S, G208R and T210K) ( Fig 4A) were 178 previously identified in an in vitro evolution experiment to escape MxB restriction to varying 179 degrees [9] . The mutation P207S is relatively conservative, while both G208R and T210K 180 introduce bulky, positively charged residues to the predominantly negatively charged 181 environment described above (Fig 2A, 3A ). Based on our interaction mapping results, we 182 predicted that both G208R and T210K, which drastically alter the electrostatic environment of the 183 tri-hexamer interface, would decrease MxB binding to capsid. To test this hypothesis, we 184 introduced these mutations into CA tubes and performed co-pelleting assays with MxB 1-35 -185 MBPdi.\n\nThe CA mutations G208R and T210K drastically reduced MxB binding ( Fig 3B) . MxB 1-187 35 -MBPdi binding to CA G208R was indistinguishable from the MxB 1-35-AAA -MBPdi background 188 signal. Binding to CA T210K was also substantially reduced. By neutralizing the strong negative 189 charge at the tri-hexamer interface, these mutations likely disrupt charge-charge interactions that 190 are required for MxB binding. It is also possible that the bulkiness of these residues occludes the 191 well at the tri-hexamer interface and sterically blocks MxB access. The relatively modest 192 mutation P207S had a minor effect on MxB interaction ( Fig 3B) . These data lend strong support 193 to our mapping results that identify the MxB targeting site to the tri-hexamer interface on capsid.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/444067 doi: bioRxiv preprint 233 Results from our MD analysis show that MxB 1-35 binds persistently in the tri-hexamer 234 region throughout the entirety of the simulation, with extensive molecular contacts between MxB 235 N-terminal region and CA residues (Table 2) . Importantly, CA residues in the tri-hexamer 236 interface, E71, E75 and E213, interact with the 11 RRR 13 motif of MxB with high occupancies (Fig   237 4D and Table 2 ), which is in good agreement with our co-pelleting assay data (Fig 2C and 2D ). In 238 fact, there is a remarkable agreement between the MD results with the experimental binding data 239 obtained independently. For example, contacts between E212 and the MxB N-terminus were 240 observed less frequently, which is consistent with the experimental finding that the E212A 241 mutation has a smaller disruption of MxB binding than other glutamate mutations do at the tri-242 hexamer interface ( Fig 2D) . Moreover, we observe CA residues T210, G208, and P207 243 interacting with the 11 RRR 13 motif of MxB, which accounts for the importance of these sites in 244 MxB binding ( Fig 3B) and sensitivity [9] . In addition, we found contacts between CA and 245 residues outside of the 11 RRR 13 motif ( Table 2, The MxB-binding pocket revealed by the simulation is primarily formed by key CA 253 residues located in adjacent CA hexamers (Table 2 and Fig 4D and SI Appendix 3) . The MxB 254 11 RRR 13 motif is anchored to the bottom of the pocket, primarily interacting with the negatively-255 charged CA E213 residues, while the rest of the MxB 1-35 peptide exhibits significantly higher 256 flexibility (Fig 4D and SI Video 1) . This observation is supported by the experimental finding 257 that the E213A mutation shows the largest effect on MxB binding ( Fig 2D) . Notably, the 258 significant difference in effect between E212A and E213A on MxB binding is consistent 259 experimentally and computationally. This is likely due to their relative positions at the interface: 260 E213 is closer to the 3-fold symmetry axis (Fig 2b) and other E213 residues from adjacent 261 hexamers, such that MxB can bind E213 from multiple CA monomers simultaneously ( Fig 4D) .

Consistently, we found that the tri-303 hexamer interface mutations that escape MxB restriction, G208R and T210K, also significantly 304 disrupted the binding of MxB, likely due to a combined result of steric clash and charge repulsion 305 with the 11 RRR 13 motif. In contrast, mutations in the di-hexamer interface and around the CypA-306 binding loop on the hexamer surface had little effect on MxB binding. Our structural studies 307 showed these mutations had no apparent effect on the structure of CA lattice assemblies, 308 supporting that the mutagenesis results revealed a direct binding of MxB at the tri-hexamer 309 interface.\n\nThough our mutant CA tubes are similar in morphology to that of wild-type CA, many of 311 these mutations have deleterious effects in the virus, which may explain why MxB escape 312 mutations are not commonly seen. Notably, it has been reported that the mutation E213A leads to 313 decreased infectivity in cellular assays, and while Gag processing and viral cores appear normal, 314 the core remains stable longer than wild-type upon entry into the target cell [31]. This is 315 consistent with our observation during protein purification that E213A appeared to produce more 316 stable CA assemblies and prone to precipitation. Viruses containing the CA mutations E71A and 317 E180A had reduced infectivity relative to wild-type [32, 33] . The latter suggests that these two 318 mutations are not tolerated well by the virus, and perhaps coping with MxB restriction is a lower-319 cost measure than evolving resistance. 320 Our all-atom molecular dynamics simulations identified the same important tri-hexamer 321 interface independent of the experimental biochemistry. In the simulation, the bound MxB 322 peptide interacts with many CA residues that were tested biochemically to be critical for MxB 323 interaction (E71, E75, E212 and E213) and shown to be functionally important for MxB 324 sensitivity (P207, G208, and T210). The extensive contacts between the MxB peptide and CA 325 residues illustrate where and how MxB targets the CA lattice. Moreover, the glutamates in the tri-326 hexamer region, i.e. E213, create inter-hexamer repulsion and undermine the tri-hexamer \n\nThe work presented herein advances the mechanistic understanding of MxB restriction in 348 molecular detail. We defined the HIV-1 capsid site recognized by the MxB 11 RRR 13 motif to be 349 the interface between three CA hexamers. This represents a residue-level mapping of a HIV-1 350 capsid lattice-sensing restriction factor. Further work is needed to structurally characterize the 351 interaction of MxB N-terminus and its interaction with CA. In addition, a better understanding of 352 the binding affinity and behavior of the MxB oligomer will shed more light on its restriction.
