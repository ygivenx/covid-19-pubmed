{"title": "PLP2, a potent deubiquitinase from murine hepatitis virus, strongly inhibits cellular type I interferon production", "body": "The coronavirus family has been extensively studied since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in 2003 1. SARS coronavirus (SCoV) belongs to the group II coronavirus and is phylogenetically related to the mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) 2. Studies showed that type I interferons (IFNs) including IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 could inhibit replication of SCoV, and IFN\u03b2 was more effective 3, 4. However, clinical studies revealed that SCoV infection induced very low levels of type I IFNs 5, 6, 7, which likely contributed to the rampant viral replication and high mortality associated with the disease. Interestingly, a similar type I IFN response was also found in MHV-A59 infection 8, 9. It was reported recently that certain viral components of SCoV, such as nsp1, nsp3 (nonstructural protein 3), ORF3b, ORF6 and N protein, might play some roles in the inhibition of type I IFN induction 10, 11. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated.\n\nType I IFNs (mainly IFN\u03b2 and multiple IFN\u03b1 subtypes) are believed to be the most important cytokines in innate immunity against viral infections. Depending upon the nature of invading viruses and the infected host cell types, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR3, 7 and 9, as well as cytosolic RNA helicases, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5), play important roles of sentinel to recognize viral genomes and trigger the type I IFN signaling through adaptor proteins TRIF, MyD88 or CARDIF 12, 13, 14, 15. Moreover, recent studies indicate that these multiple TLR-dependent and -independent pathways may converge on a common TRAF3 adaptor complex, leading to the activation of two critical serine/threonine kinases, TBK1 or IKK\u03b5 16, 17. Activated TBK1 or IKK\u03b5 then phosphorylates the transcription factor IRF3, which translocates into the nucleus to activate the transcription of type I IFN genes. Secreted IFNs, via autocrine or paracrine circuit, activate the JAK-STAT pathway through the common type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) and induce the expression of an array of anti-viral related genes and cytokines 18, 19.\n\nRecent research also indicates that host cells possess intrinsic ubiquitination and deubiquitination programs that are critically involved in the type I IFN induction pathway 20, 21. Interestingly, the nonstructural protein of SCoV, nsp3, a known protease involved in the processing of replicase polyproteins, has recently been shown to carry a conserved deubiquitinase (DUB) motif within its papain-like protease (PLpro) domain 22. In the present study, we provide evidence showing that nsp3 of MHV-A59, a group II coronavirus phylogenetically related with SCoV, can efficiently inhibit IRF3 ubiquitination and IFN induction. This novel finding therefore sheds new light into why host cells produce very low levels of type I IFNs characteristic for innate immunity evasion by SCoV and MHV 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. These results also suggest a novel target for the development of drugs against SARS.\n\nUsing Sendai virus (SeV) as a control, we assessed whether MHV-A59 induced IFN\u03b2 expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed rapid and strong IFN\u03b2 production in response to SeV infection of MEF cells (6 h post-infection), whereas MHV-A59 infection resulted in no detectable IFN\u03b2 induction along the time course, with trivial increase after 24 h of infection (Figure 1A). MHV-A59 replicated well in MEFs as revealed by the RT-PCR assay showing the expression of nucleocapsid genes and the plaque assay (Supplementary information, Figure S1). IFN\u03b2 binds to IFNAR to activate the phosphorylation of STAT1. The inability of MHV-A59 to effectively induce IFN\u03b2 gene expression correlated well with undetectable STAT1 phosphorylation, as compared with strong STAT1 phosphorylation after SeV infection (Figure 1B). IRF3 is a nucleo-cytoplasm shuttling factor that requires phosphorylation and dimerization for transcriptional activation. In contrast to SeV, MHV-A59 infection of MEFs could induce neither dimerization (Figure 1C) nor nuclear translocation (Figure 1D) of IRF3. These results therefore suggest that host cells lack the ability to produce type I IFN in response to MHV-A59 infection.\n\nBecause ubiquitination plays an important role in the RIG-I-mediated IFN induction cascade 20, and because PLpro domain 2 (PLP2) domain of MHV-A59 contains a conserved DUB motif 22, we hypothesized that the DUB activity of PLP2 domain might block the IFN\u03b2 response during MHV-A59 infection. As the first step to identify the potential target of PLP2 DUB in the type I IFN signaling pathway, we tested whether IFN reporter activities driven by overexpressed CARDIF, TBK1 or IRF3 were affected by co-expressed PLP2. As shown in Figure 2A-C, PLP2 efficiently inhibited IFN\u03b2 reporter activities in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown for expression of various exogenous proteins). As mentioned above, PLP2 is the main active domain of nsp3; to understand whether full-length nsp3 also contains such activity we tried to clone the full-length nsp3 of MHV-A59. However, the full-length sequence appears very unstable, always resulting in smaller inserts in our constructs. We were able to obtain a construct (MHV NSP3 4.0) with an about 4.0-kb insert which comprised 2/3 of the full-length nsp3 from its N terminus and contained the intact PLP2 domain. We found that this construct could produce a 150-kDa protein and could greatly inhibit the type I IFN signaling pathway (Supplementary information, Figure S2). At the same time, we also tested the effect of full-length nsp3 of ScoV, which is a close relative of MHV-A59. Expression of this construct could produce several proteins with different sizes and could also inhibit the type I IFN signaling pathway (Supplementary information, Figure S3). Because PLP2 exhibited apparent inhibition of IRF3-driven reporter activity, and IRF3 activation is the very last step in the type I IFN signaling pathway, we suspected that inhibition of IRF3 ubiquitination by PLP2 DUB would account for the inactivation of IRF3 and reduced IFN\u03b2 production. While overexpressed IRF3 became poly-ubiquitinated, such poly-ubiquitin modification of IRF3 was effectively inhibited by co-expressed PLP2 DUB (Figure 3A). Furthermore, PLP2 could deconjugate both Lys63- and Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains as shown with the mutant Ubi-K48 or Ubi-K63 (described in Materials and methods), respectively (Figure 3B), suggesting its rather promiscuous spectra of deubiquitination. This result was also in good agreement with its general hydrolyzing activity towards cellular polyubiquitinated proteins (data not shown). Furthermore, Flag-PLP2 and Myc-IRF3 were reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated with each other, indicating that they could form a complex (Figure 3C). All these data therefore suggest that PLP2 likely inhibited IFN induction through binding to and deubiquitinating IRF3.\n\nThe Cys residue of the catalytic triad \u201cCys-His-Asp\u201d is essential for the DUB activity of SCoV PLpro domain 22. When we mutated the conserved Cys106 to Ala, the resultant mutant (PLP2-C106A) could no longer deubiquitinate IRF3 (Figure 4A). In the following experiments we found that the C106A mutant showed reduced ability to inhibit IFN\u03b2 promoter activation driven by CARDIF, TBK1 and IRF3 (Figure 4B-4D). We also produced another mutant, PLP2-D277A (Asp277 to Ala), which changes one of the catalytic triad, Asp277. Unexpectedly, the D277A mutant still showed strong DUB activity (Figure 4E) even though its expression level was lower. Consequently, D277A could still inhibit the activation of IFN\u03b2 promoter (Figure 4F). Therefore, our data indicate that the DUB activity of PLP2 was required for the inhibition of type I IFN induction.\n\nIRF3 activation has been shown to be critically involved in type I IFN induction by paromyxoviruses such as SeV and VSV 23, 24. In order to substantiate our hypothesis that PLP2 DUB may be a general blocker of the type I IFN signaling pathway, we set to determine whether PLP2 inhibits IFN production induced by these viruses. Overexpression of wild-type PLP2 could greatly inhibit the activation of IFN\u03b2 promoter induced by SeV infection of HEK293T cells, while PLP2-C106A failed to do so (Figure 5A). The ability of PLP2 to inhibit IFN\u03b2 induction by SeV (Figure 5A) was due to inactivation of IRF3, as wild-type PLP2 but not the PLP2-C106A mutant inhibited IRF3 nuclear translocation (Figure 5B). Similarly, wild-type PLP2 but not PLP2-C106A could effectively inhibit VSV-mediated induction of endogenous IFN\u03b2 mRNA (Figure 5C) and, consequently, accelerate virus replication in HEK293T cells (Figure 5D). Overall, it is tempting to speculate that group II coronaviruses, including MHV-A59 and SCoV, might utilize the immediate-early gene product, nsp3, to subvert host anti-viral innate immune response by preventing ubiquitination and activation of IRF3, a critical transcription factor in the type I IFN signaling pathway.\n\nCoronaviruses are able to infect a broad range of vertebrates to evoke systemic immunopathological dysfunction. Lack of type I IFN production in host cells to effectively control viral replication likely plays an important role in SARS manifestation and progression. By using a mouse-specific strain of group II coronavirus, MHV-A59, we provide evidence here that a DUB activity conserved among coronavirus nsp3 proteins might specifically inhibit IRF3 activation, and thereby is responsible for viral inhibition of cellular type I IFN production.\n\nMost mammalian cells including immune and non-immune cells can produce type I IFNs in response to various viral infections. On the other hand, as a result of host-pathogen co-evolution, viruses have developed various strategies to escape from type I IFN response. For example, VP35 of Ebola virus could inhibit the phosphorylation of IRF3 25; NS1 of influenza virus could bind dsRNA and inhibit the subsequent activation of IRF3 26. NS34A, a cysteine protease of HCV, could cleave CARDIF to block RIG-I-mediated IFN induction 27. In immune response to SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses, such as HCoV-OC43, there is an unusual lack of the antiviral IFN response 5, 6, 7, 8. The finding that MHV-A59 PLP2 potently inhibits IRF3 ubiquitination (Figure 3) and its transcriptional activation of the IFN\u03b2 gene (Figures 2, 4 and 5) provides novel insight into how the viral gene expression program targets the host innate immune system. During our study, another group reported a similar phenomenon that SCoV PLpro could block IRF3-mediated type I IFN induction 28. However, in their study, they concluded that the DUB activity of PLpro was not involved in the inhibition of type I IFN signaling pathway because the Asp mutant (D1826A), which had been shown to lose >99% of DUB activity 22, could still inhibit type I IFN induction 28. In our present study, we found that the Asp mutant of PLP2 could still strongly block the ubiquitination of IRF3 (Figure 4B). In fact, from the data of the previous study 22, one could clearly see that the D1826A mutant could cleave di-ubiquitin to produce mono-ubiquitin, even though its activity was lower than that of WT. Considering the situation of over-expression, the remaining DUB activity might be sufficient to affect the ubiquitination process of the cells. Therefore, we propose that the DUB activity of PLP2 is closely related to its function to block the type I IFN induction pathway.\n\nA growing body of evidence indicates that ubiquitination is critically involved in the type I IFN signaling pathway. Ubiquitination of RIG-I by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 is necessary and sufficient to trigger the downstream signaling cascade to produce type I IFNs 20. Ubiquitination of IRF7 by the E3 ligase TRAF6 has been implicated in type I IFN induction in TLR7, 8 and 9 pathways 29, 30. Studies have shown that activated IRF3 could be polyubiquitinated and degraded 31, 32, yet one could not exclude the possibility of IRF3 activation by ubiquitination just like what is observed with RIG-I 20. In the present study we found that IRF3 could be ubiquitinated by both K48 and K63 Ubi (Figure 3B). Notably, K48 ubiquitination is involved in degradation while K63 ubiquitination is usually regarded as an active form of ubiquitin-targeted proteins 33, 34. The fact that deubiquitinated IRF3 fails to translocate to the nucleus (Figure 5B) also supports the possibility that IRF3 activation may require ubiquitination. Although further studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between the activation and ubiquitination of IRF3, our present study and the recent report by others 28 clearly show that IRF3 is a target of the coronavirus PLpro. Interestingly, the newly identified cellular DUB, DUBA, inhibits the ubiquitination of TRAF3, an adaptor of RIG-I signaling, and negatively regulates the type I IFN signaling pathway 21. Coronaviruses may have picked up this mechanism from the host during their co-evolution, and deubiquitination of IRF3 by nsp3 seems to provide a general suppression of anti-viral IFN production to facilitate productive infection. This strategy is not unique to viruses because the bacterial virulence factor YopJ also functions as a DUB that inhibits TRAFs-mediated innate immune response 35.\n\nIt would be ideal to provide definitive evidence that nsp3PLP2 encodes a functionally important DUB by either reverse genetics to introduce point mutations (e.g., C106A) into the MHV-A59 genome 36 or small interference RNA against nsp3 to rescue IFN response in the infected cells. However, the nsp3 protein and the catalytic cysteine site are required for the processing of replicase polyprotein of coronaviruses 22, 37; therefore targeting of nsp3 would affect viral replication per se. Nevertheless, ectopic expression of the PLP2 domain inhibits both SeV- and VSV-induced IFN response and facilitates viral replication (Figure 5), suggesting that MHV-A59 PLP2 provides a general inactivation mechanism of the host anti-viral response through deubiquitination of important innate immunity regulatory factor(s), such as IRF3.\n\nTaken together, the results of our study and others suggest that inactivation of IRF3 by nsp3 may contribute to the weak IFN response in coronavirus infections. Ultimate understanding of the overall interactions between coronaviruses and the host innate immune system will provide further insight into the pathogenesis of viruses in this class, and open a new avenue of therapeutic target exploration against coronavirus infections.\n\nWild-type MEF cells were in C57/BL6 background.
