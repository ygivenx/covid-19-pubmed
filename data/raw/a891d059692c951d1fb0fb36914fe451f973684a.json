All inhibitors were used 151 at non-toxic concentrations (Fig. 2C) . 152 The experiments conducted so far suggested that KLK13 is required for virus infection. 153 However, one may question the specificity of the KLK13 protease inhibitors. To ensure that 154 KLK13 is indeed the priming enzyme during HCoV-HKU1 infection, we developed HAE 155 cultures by transforming cells with lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs targeting KLK13 156 mRNA. We then confirmed that the expression of the protease was silenced (HAE_shKLK13). (Fig. 3A) . Importantly, HAE_shKLK13 cells continued to differentiate and formed 162 pseudostratified cultures (Fig. 3B) . Next, we infected HAE_ctrl, HAE_GFP, HAE_vector, and 163 HAE_shKLK13 with HCoV-HKU1 (10 6 RNA copies per ml) and incubated them for 2 h at 164 32\u00b0C with the viral stock solution. Cultures were maintained at 32\u00b0C for 5 days at an air-liquid 165 interface. Apical washes were collected, and virus yield was determined by RT-qPCR. We 166 found that, in contrast to that in control cultures, replication of virus in HAE_shKLK13 was 167 abolished (Fig. 3C) . Overall, these data suggest that silencing the KLK13 gene in HAE inhibits 168 virus infection, indicating that KLK13 is necessary for HCoV-HKU1 infection. 171 We determined that KLK13 is essential for efficient HCoV-HKU1 infection in HAE The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.971499 doi: bioRxiv preprint proteases my render RD cells permissive, we generated RD cells expressing human KLK13 or 176 TMPRSS2 proteases. RD cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors harboring the KLK13 177 gene (RD_KLK13), control vector (RD_ctrl), or TMPRSS2 (RD_TMPRSS2). Due to the lack 178 of KLK13 specific antibodies, we verified its presence based on RT-PCR (Fig. 4A) . The 179 presence of TMPRSS2 in RD_TMPRSS2 cells was confirmed using Western blot. The 180 TMPRSS2 band in RD cells was observed at 25 kDa, which corresponds to one of the naturally 181 occurring splicing variants (Fig. 4B) . Subsequently, we transduced RD_ctrl, RD_KLK13 and pseudoviruses, compared to \u0394Env, which was completely abolished in the presence of KLK13 193 inhibitor (Fig 4D) . Overall, these data demonstrated that KLK13 activity drives HCoV-HKU1 194 entry into cells. 195 196 KLK13 enables the replication of HCoV-HKU1 in RD cells 197 Obtained results showed that KLK13 expression on RD cells was sufficient for HCoV-198 HKU1 pseudovirus entry. Here, we aimed to test whether KLK13 presence renders RD cells 199 permissive for HCoV-HKU1 infection. For this, we infected RD_ctrl and RD_KLK13 cells 200 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Next, cellular RNA was isolated 202 and the presence of HCoV-HKU1 N subgenomic mRNA (N sg mRNA), which is considered 203 to be a hallmark of coronaviral infection, was assessed (14). sg mRNA appeared in RD_KLK13 204 cells, while no signal was detected in cultures supplemented with the KLK13 inhibitor nor in 205 RD_ctrl cells (Fig. 5A) . 206 To further confirm the role of KLK13 during HCoV-HKU1 infection RD HCoV-HKU1 infection was analyzed by means of N sg mRNA detection. Again, we found that 212 N sg mRNA was produced only in the presence of KLK13 (Fig. 5B) . Further, we passaged in the presence of KLK13 (Fig. 5B) . However, we observed no cytopathic effects (CPEs), and 218 replication levels were very low (no significant increase over control levels on RT-qPCR; data 219 not shown). To further test the effect of KLK13 on replication of HCoV-HKU1 in RD cells, the 220 virus stock was incubated with purified KLK13 (200 nM) and incubated in the presence or 221 absence of a KLK13 inhibitor (10 \u00b5M) or DMSO. After 2 h at 32\u00b0C pre-treated virus stock was 222 diluted in media as described above and overlaid on RD cells. After 7 days at 32\u00b0C we evaluated 223 the presence of the HCoV-HKU1 N sg mRNA. The virus replicated only after treatment with 224 KLK13, and supplementation with the inhibitor blocked this effect infection (Fig. 5C) . 225 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Subsequently, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by western blotting 238 with antibodies specific for His-tagged proteins. The analysis showed that, in the presence of 239 500 nM KLK13, the CleavEx protein harboring the S1/S2 cleavage site was degraded; however, 240 the CleavEx protein harboring the S2/S2' site remained intact. Because KLKs are produced as 241 pro-forms that undergo self-activation, an additional band of His-tagged purified pro-KLK13 242 (HisTag-pro-KLK13) was observed after treatment with 500 nM KLK13 (Fig. 6A) . The product 243 of the S1/S2 cleavage was further sequenced by N-terminal Edman degradation showing the 244 following sequence: R\u2193SISA, which corresponds to the S1/S2 site. This result shows clearly 245 that the S1/S2 region of the HCoV-HKU1 S protein is prone to KLK13-mediated cleavage. 246 Furthermore, we aimed to confirm the cleavage using a full-length Spike protein of HCoV-HKU1 (HKU1-S). For this, we expressed the HKU1-S in 293T cells, purified the protein 248 using 6 \u00d7 His tag, and incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C with increasing concentrations of purified 249 KLK13.

Broad spectrum protease inhibitors are now used widely for virus research, 281 although their non-specific activity makes the results equivocal. For example, Matsuyama et al. 282 showed recently that the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK interferes with the activity of several 283 proteases, and that its previously described inhibitory activity during MERS-CoV infection is 284 not specific to furin; instead, its activity is due to non-specific inhibition of cathepsin L and 285 TMPRSS2 (81). We tried to use specific KLK inhibitors developed in our laboratory (61).\n\nConsidering the small arsenal of tools available to researchers studying KLKs, only three 287 compounds were readily available. Treating HAE cultures with these inhibitors revealed that 288 only compounds designed to inhibit KLK13 hampered HCoV-HKU1 replication. However, the 289 great similarity between different KLKs makes one doubt the specificity of these inhibitors, 290 despite their performance in biochemical assays. Therefore, we decided to silence KLK13 in 291 HAE cultures. This abolished virus replication ex vivo, thereby confirming the importance of 292 KLK13 during infection. KLK13 is thought to be secreted and membrane-bound(82, 83). 293 This study showed that HCoV-HKU1 infection in HAE modulates the expression of 294 different KLKs, including KLK13. In our study, KLKs expression was tested using semi-295 quantitative PCR, and for that reason, we were unable to show the level of KLKs modulation 296 after HCoV-HKU1. However, the pattern of virus-induced expression of several KLKs could 297 be observed. KLK mechanism of activation is a complex process and until now it has only 298 been proven that most KLK genes are regulated by steroids and other hormones (84). It is also 299 important to remember, that KLK expression is regulated in a similar manner, and the induction 300 of a single gene usually results in overexpression of the whole cluster (85, 86). While one may 301 assume that the virus stimulates KLK13 production to promote the infection, this up-regulation 302 is likely a natural response of the damaged tissue, as KLKs were previously reported to take 303 part also in tissue regeneration (87-89). Further, increased expression of KLKs may be the 304 author/funder. All rights reserved.

We 309 tested the purified enzyme expressed in the eukaryotic cells; however, we also developed a cell 310 line constitutively expressing the enzyme. As an in vitro model for our studies, we used RD 311 cells previously reported to carry attachment receptors for the virus (26). Here, using 312 pseudoviruses decorated with S-HKU1 proteins we showed that KLK13 presence on RD cells 313 is sufficient for virus entry and renders these cells permissive. Our experiments also showed 314 that in contrast to previous reports, TMPRSS2 is not involved in this process(51). Furthermore, 315 we observed that RD cells supported the replication of the virus in the presence of KLK13 and 316 that this effect was reversed in the presence of the specific KLK13 inhibitor. We were, however, 317 not able to culture the virus to high yields. HCoV-HKU1 replication in KLK13-expressing RD 318 cells remained inefficient and RTqPCR assessment did not reveal significant increases in the 319 amounts of viral RNA. For that reason, we are only able to detect viral sg mRNAs, which are 320 considered to be the hallmark of coronaviral replication.We believe that this may be due to 321 non-optimal infection conditions, which may include inappropriate KLK13 concentrations or 322 low density of the entry receptor. Also, it is possible that RD cells may not support efficient 323 replication of the virus due to factors unrelated to the entry process. Nonetheless, our results\n\nshow that the HCoV-HKU1 entry receptor is present on RD cells, and we were able to trigger 325 virus entry and replication; these findings warrant further exploration.\n\nMost coronaviral S proteins are processed into S1 and S2 subunits by host proteases, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.971499 doi: bioRxiv preprint HCoV-HKU1 S protein has two regions that are prone to proteolytic activation: the S1/S2 furin 330 cleavage site and a secondary cleavage site termed S2', which is adjacent to a potential fusion 331 peptide (38). While the S1/S2 site is believed to be processed by furin during protein 332 biosynthesis, the S2/S2' site is expected to be cleaved during virus entry. As we already knew being tested. We found that the S1/S2 site was efficiently cleaved by KLK13, whereas the 338 S2/S2' region remained intact. As CleavEx technique is a convenient surrogate system allowing 339 for precise mapping of the cleavage site, it has some limitations. To ensure the reliability of 340 results, purified full-length HCoV-HKU1 S protein was subjected to the proteolytic cleavage.\n\nAlso here we observed efficient cleavage of the HCoV-HKU1 S protein by KLK13.\n\nWhile the results presented here show that KLK13 is able to process the HCoV-HKU1 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.971499 doi: bioRxiv preprint to cross the species barrier and cause severe diseases in humans, further research on the role of 355 different proteases in coronaviral infections is necessary. 356 author/funder.
