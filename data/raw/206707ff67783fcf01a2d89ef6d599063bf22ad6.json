{"title": "Salt Effects on the Thermodynamics of a Frameshifting RNA Pseudoknot under Tension", "body": "The multifarious roles RNA molecules play in controlling a myriad of cellular functions 1 have made it important to understand in quantitative terms their folding [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , and how they respond to external stresses. 7 Among them one of simplest structural motifs is the RNA pseudoknot (PK), which is involved 5 in many biological functions. The simplest type, referred to as H-type PK, consists of two stems connected by two loops in which one of the stems forms base pairs with the loop of the other. The PK motif, found in many RNA molecules such as telomerase, 8 mRNA, 9 ribosomal RNA, 10 transfer-messenger RNA, and viral RNA, 11 are functionally important. 12 For instance, a PK in the 10 human telomerase RNA (hTR) is essential for the enzyme (a ribonucleoprotein complex) activity. 13 Many pathogenic mutations in the hTR are found in the well-conserved PK region of the RNA further underscoring the importance of the PK. 8, 13 The presence of PKs are also important in ribozyme catalysis and inhibition of ribosome translation. 15 Recently, there is heightened interest in the biophysics of PK folding because it plays a crucial role in affecting the efficiency of -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF). [14] [15] [16] Usually proteins are synthesized when the ribosome reads the mRNA code in three nucleotide steps until the stop codon is reached. In -1 PRF, the open reading frame of mRNA being trans- 20 lated within the ribosome is programmed to be shifted by one nucleotide, and consequently the mRNA becomes non-functional or produces an entirely different protein. 5, [17] [18] [19] [20] The downstream PK of the mRNA is a roadblock at the entrance to the mRNA channel on the ribosome, that impedes the translocation of the ribosome. The ribosome must unfold the PK, presumed to occur by 25 exertion of mechanical force, to complete translocation. Because frameshifting efficiency could depend on how the PK responds to force, a number of single molecule pulling experiments have focussed on PKs. 15, 21, 22 Several factors could determine -1 PRF as evidenced by multitude of proposals based on many experimental studies. 14, 15, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Nevertheless, given that ribosome translocation 30 exerts mechanical force on the downstream mRNA, it is physically reasonable to assume that resistance of PK to force should at least be one factor determining the frameshifting efficiency. 14, 29 The considerations given above and the availability of both ensemble and single molecule pulling experimental data prompted us to focus on the effects 35 of temperature, mechanical force, and salt concentration on a 28-nucleotide Htype RNA PK from the Beet Western Yellow Virus (BWYV) . 19 This PK has been the subject of several ensemble experiments, which have characterized the folding thermodynamics as a function of monovalent and divalent cations. 30, 31 The BWYV PK has two stems (S1 and S2) connected by two loops (L1 and 40 L2) as shown in Figure 1 . The crystal structure reveals that L2 forms triplextype tertiary interactions with S1. 32 In another context, it has been shown that such interactions and mutations affecting them dramatically changes the efficiency of frameshifting. 21 In vitro and in vivo experiments on many mutants of BWYV suggest variations in the frameshift efficiency, which for some mutants 45 is attributed to changes in the stem-loop interactions affecting the stability of PK. For others, direct involvement of the ribosome is invoked. 25 In addition to mechanical force (f ), it is known from several ensemble experiments that the stability of BWYV PK, like other RNA molecules, depends on monovalent and divalent cations. 33 Thus, it is important to understand in quantitative detail how 50 this crucial structural motif respond to f as well as changes in ion concentration.\n\nAlthough single molecule pulling experiments suggest how force affects the stability of RNA, 19 structural information obtained from such experiments is limited only to changes in molecular extensions. In order to provide a theoretical basis for the changes in the stability and structural transitions as f 55 and monovalent ion concentration (C) are altered, we performed simulations using a coarse-grained three site interaction (TIS) model 34 PK and ribosome. Based in part on our work we propose that there should be a link between the stimulatory effect of frameshifting and the stability of the 5 -end of the PK. Our predictions are amenable to validations using single molecule experiments.\n\nIn order to validate our model, we first performed temperature replicaexchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations at C = 500 mM with f = 0.\n\nFormations of stems (S1 and S2) and tertiary (stem-loop) interactions (L1 and L2) are characterized by hydrogen-bond energies U S HB and U L HB , respectively.\n\nChanges in the distributions of hydrogen bond energies as the temperature is increased are shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information (SI). Figure S1 shows that there are two minima corresponding to two distinct states.\n\nThe minimum that dominates at T = 20 \u2022 C corresponds to the folded state in which both S1 and S2 are formed (U S HB \u2248 \u221245 kcal/mol). The minimum with 95 U S HB \u2248 \u221230 kcal/mol at 80 \u2022 C corresponds to a state in which S1 is intact ( Figure  S1 ). The free energy profile of U L HB shows only one possible minimum around U L HB \u2248 \u221220 kcal/mol at T = 20 \u2022 C, indicating that L1 and L2 fold/unfold cooperatively as temperature changes.\n\nWe calculated the free energy profiles G(R \u03b1 ) = \u2212k B T log P (R \u03b1 ) (R \u03b1 = 100 R ee , end-to-end distance, or R g , radius of gyration) from the distributions of P (R \u03b1 ), which are given in Figure S2 in the SI. The locations and the number of minima report on the thermodynamic transitions between the states ( Figure   2 ). (1) At a low temperature, T = 20 \u2022 C, the PK is completely folded (F state) including all the structural motifs, S1, S2, L1 and L2. The existence of F state At T = 60 \u2022 C, the free energy profile for U L HB shows that some of the tertiary interactions, involving L1 and L2, are no longer stably formed ( Figure S1B ).\n\nOn the other hand, G(R g ) shows two stable minima, indicating that there are two possible states ( Figure 2B ). In one state, both stems S1 and S2 are formed but tertiary interactions are absent, corresponding to the I1 state identified using UV absorbance and differential scanning calorimetry experiments ( Figure   3 ). 30, 31 The other conformation, in which only S1 is formed, has been also 115 observed in experiments and is referred to as the I2 state. It should be noted that the distribution of U S HB also has two minima at 60 \u2022 C ( Figure S1A ) whereas G(R ee ) has only one minimum ( Figure 2A ). (3) At a still higher temperature T = 80 \u2022 C, G(R ee ) and G(R g ) each have a minimum with S1 stably formed. This is also reflected in Figure S1 , which shows a minimum at U S HB \u2248 \u221230 kcal/mol, and a minimum at U S HB \u2248 0. Thus, completely unfolded conformations, U state, and the I2 state are populated. (4) At T = 110 \u2022 C, both U S HB and U L HB are 0 , indicating that only the U state exists. This is also reflected in G(R ee ) and G(R g ), which show that the PK is completely unfolded. In both profiles ( Figures 2A and 2B) , the center of minimum is located at larger values than in 125 the F state (R ee \u2248 5 nm and R g \u2248 2 nm).\n\nThe simulations results in Figure 2 and Figure S1 show that melting of The range of melting temperatures for the three transitions can be obtained from the temperature dependence of the various states f \u03b1 (T ) (\u03b1 =F, I1, I2 or U)\n\ngiven in Figure 2C . The I1 state has a maximum population around T \u2248 50 \u2022 C.\n\nWe equate this with the melting temperature T m1 associated with the F I1 Table 1 of Nixon and Giedroc 30 ).\n\nThe dependence of the stability of the F state with respect to the U state, Figure 4D ; boundary between red and green regions). At low forces (f < 2.5 pN), the diagram of states based on R ee shows that the extension is relatively small as C changes from a low to a high value. From this finding one 180 might be tempted to infer that the PK is always folded, which is not physical especially at low (C \u2248 10 mM) ion concentrations. In contrast, Figure 4E shows 8 that below 5 pN there is a transition from compact structures (R g \u2248 1.3 nm in the blue region) at high C to an intermediate state (R g > 2.2 nm in the green region) at C \u2248 100 mM. The differences between the diagrams of states 185 in the [C, f ] plane using R ee and R g as order parameters are more vividly illustrated in terms of the free energy profiles conformation (see the cyan profile in Figure 5A ). As f exceeds 5 pN, there is essentially one minimum whose position increases as f increases. In the force regime (f > 5 pN) only the E state is visible at all C.\n\nIn order to compare the thermal free energy profiles generatuted at C = 500 mM ( Figure 2 ) we calculated the G(R g ) and G(R ee ) at different forces with C fixed at 500 mM. Comparison of Figure 2 and Figure S3 shows that at f = 0 the free energy profiles are similar. At f = 0 the folded state is destabilized and at f = 15 pN the unfolded state is more stable than the folded PK. qualitatively similar to one of R g ( Figure S4 ).\n\nIn order to highlight the structural changes that occur as C and f are varied, we used, Q, the fraction of native hydrogen-bond interactions as an order parameter. The [C, f ] phase diagram ( Figure 6A ) calculated using the average Q 215 is similar to the R g -phase diagram ( Figure 4E ), indicating the presence of three states ( Figure 6A ). Using Q we can also quantitatively assess the contributions from different structural elements to the stability of the PK, and correctly infer the order in which the structural elements of the PK rupture as f is increased.\n\nIn order to determine the structural details of each state, we calculated the in-220 dividual Qs for the two stems (Q S1 , Q S2 ) and the two loops (Q L1 Q L2 ) ( Figure   6B ). The dependence of Q S1 as a function of C and f shows that Stem 1 (S1) is extremely stable and remains intact at all salt concentration, rupturing only at f \u2248 10 pN (see upper left panel in Figure 6B ). In contrast, the upper right panel in Figure 6B shows that Stem 2 (S2) is only stably folded above a moderate salt 225 concentration (C \u2248 80 mM) and low f . The stability difference between S1 and S2 can be explained by the number of canonical G-C base pairs; S1 has five G-C base pairs whereas only three such pairs are in S2. Consequently, S1 cannot be destabilized even at low C, but its rupture to produce extended states requires the use of mechanical force. Above C > 100 mM, the fraction of contacts asso-230 ciated with S2 and the two loops (Q S2 , Q L1 and Q L2 ) simultaneously increase.\n\nAll the interactions are, however, still not completely formed (Q \u2248 0.8) even at the highest salt concentration, C = 1200 mM. In particular, the contacts involving L2, Q L2 \u2248 0.6, implying that tertiary interactions are only marginally\n\nThe results in Figure 6 Parsing the U HB due to contributions from interactions among S1, S2, L1, and L2 produces a picture of thermodynamic ordering as C (f ) is increased (decreased) from low (high) value to high (low) value. Low C and high f correspond to the top left region in the phase diagrams (Figures 4 and 6) . In all conditions, S1 is the first to form as indicated by the presence of distinct We did not find any condition in which S1 and S2 are completely folded but there are no tertiary interactions, U L HB \u2248 0 (i.e. isolated I1 state). Our simulations show that the tertiary interactions contribute to the loop energy only after the stems are formed. Thus, the actual population is distributed between I1 and F, and the tertiary interactions are only marginally stable in 295 the conditions examined here. Soto et al. suggested that diffuse Mg 2+ ions play an important role in stabilizing such tertiary interactions. 31 Because Mg 2+ is not considered here, we cannot determine the precise interactions stabilizing the I1 state, especially at f = 0. In the discussion hereafter, for simplicity, we refer to (I1+F) state as F.\n\nIn order to delineate the phase boundaries quantitatively, we calculated the free energy differences between the three major states in the [C, f ] plane using \u2206G EI (C, f ) = \u2212k B T log P (I;C,f ) P (E;C,f ) , where the classification of the states, E, I (=I2), or F, is based on the hydrogen-bond interaction energies of stems, U S1 HB 305 and U S2 HB (Figure 8) . A similar equation is used to calculate \u2206G IF . Based on the distribution of U HB , we determined the threshold values for S1 formation as U S1\n\nHB < \u221215 kcal/mol ( Figure S5A ). Similarly, S2 formation is deemed to occur if U S2 HB < \u221210 kcal/mol ( Figure S5B ). We classified each structure depending on whether both stems are formed (F) with both U S1 HB < \u221215 kcal/mol and In what follows we provide a theoretical interpretation of these results, which automatically shows that the difference in preferential ion interaction coefficients between states can be directly measured in LOT experiments. 39-43 325 The salt-concentration dependence of RNA stability can be determined using the preferential interaction coefficient, defined as \u0393 = \u2202C \u2202CRNA \u00b5 , where C RNA is the concentration of RNA, and the chemical potential of the ions, \u00b5, is a constant. 35, 44 The free energy difference, \u2206G \u03b1\u03b2 (=G \u03b2 \u2212G \u03b1 ), between two states \u03b1 and \u03b2 (such as E and I or I and F) can be expressed as,\n\nwhere C 0 is an arbitrary reference value of the salt concentration. 45 Note that we consider only 1:1 monovalent salt such as KCl or NaCl for which ion activity can be related to salt concentration C. The factor of 2 in Eq. (1) arises from charge neutrality. The difference, \u2206\u0393 \u03b1\u03b2 (=\u0393 \u03b2 \u2212 \u0393 \u03b1 ), is interpreted as an effective number of bound or excluded ions when the RNA molecule changes its conformation 335 between the two states. 35, 44 The free energy change upon application of an ex-\n\nIn the [C, f ] phase diagram, \u2206G \u03b1\u03b2 = 0 along the phase boundaries. Since the reference salt concentration C 0 is arbitrary, we determine its value using 340 \u2206G \u03b1\u03b2 (C 0 , f = 0) = 0. Thus, C 0 = C \u03b1\u03b2 m,f =0 is the salt concentration at the midpoint of the transition at zero force. The determination of \u2206\u0393 \u03b1\u03b2 using this procedure from single molecule pulling data has been described in several key papers. [39] [40] [41] [42] By adopting the procedure outlined in these studies and with our choice of C 0 , we rearrange Eq.(2) to obtain the phase boundary at f = 0,\n\nwhere C \u03b1\u03b2 m is the midpoint of salt concentration, and f \u03b1\u03b2 It follows from Eq.(3) that the critical force, The observed non-linearity of the phase boundary separating I and F over the 360 entire concentration range ( Figure 8D ) arises because \u2206R IF ee is not a constant, but varies linearly with f IF c (Figures 9B and 9C ). In giving from F\u2194I there is only a rupture of few tertiary interactions as well as unfolding of the relatively unstable S2. Because this transition is not cooperative (interactions break in a sequential manner), we believe that a linear behavior over a limited force range 365 is not unreasonable. In contrast, the unfolding of S1 is cooperative, like some hairpins studied using pulling experiments, in the E \u2194 I transition, resulting in the constant value for \u2206R ee over the force range probed. Thus, using \u2206R \u03b1\u03b2 ee = af \u03b1\u03b2 c + b and Eq.(4), we find that f \u03b1\u03b2 c satisfies,\n\nNote that if a is zero then Eq.(5) reduces to Eq.(4) with b = \u2206R \u03b1\u03b2 ee = const.\n\nSolving Eq.(5), the non-linear dependence of f IF c is expressed as,\n\nThe simulation data can be quantitatively fit using Eq.(6) ( Figure 8D ). In general, we expect \u2206R \u03b1\u03b2 ee depends on f \u03b1\u03b2 c , and hence f \u03b1\u03b2 c \u223c log C \u03b1\u03b2 m . It is worth noting that estimation of \u2206\u0393 \u03b1\u03b2 requires only knowledge of how the critical force varies with salt concentrations (\u2206G = 0). For any given salt concentration the best statistics are obtained at the critical force because at f c multiple transitions between the two states can be observed.\n\nFrom the coefficients in the dependence of f c on log C m , we can estimate \u2206\u0393 which provides a quantitative estimation of the extent of ion-RNA interactions. 45 For the E I transition, \u2206R ee \u2248 4.9 nm and the slope of the linear 380 function is 1.7 pN which leads to \u2206\u0393 EI = 0.96 ( Figure 8C ). This indicates that, Our analysis is based on the assumption that \u2206\u0393 is a constant independent of the salt concentration. However, it is known experimentally that \u2206\u0393 deviates from a constant value at high salt concentration. 41, 43, 46 In Figure 8C and 395 D, theoretical lines (blue dotted) show such a deviation from \u2206G = 0 of the simulation data (white region) at high salt concentration (C 500 mM). Therefore, we believe that our theoretical analysis is most accurate for C 500 mM.\n\nOur coarse-grained simulation reflects the non-linearity of \u2206\u0393 observed in previous experiments. Understanding the origin of the non-linearity requires a 400 microscopic theory that perhaps should the effects of ion-ion correlations. For complex architectures such as PK or ribozymes this does not appear straightforward.\n\nThe three-interaction-site (TIS) model 405 We employed a variant of the three-interaction-site (TIS) model, a coarsegrained model first introduced by Hyeon and Thirumalai for simulating nucleic acids. 34 The TIS model has been previously used to make several quantitative predictions for RNA molecules ranging from hairpins to ribozymes with particular focus on folding and response to f . 34, 38, [47] [48] [49] More recently, we have Briefly, we determined the stacking interactions by a learning procedure, which amounts to reproducing the measured melting temperature of dimers. We \u03b5(T )kBT and b is the mean distance between the charges on the phosphate groups. 55 The mean distance (b) between charges on RNA is difficult to estimate (except for rod-like polyelectrolytes) because of its shape fluctuations. Therefore, it should be treated as an adjustable parameter.\n\nIn our previous study we showed that b = 4.4\u00c5 provides an excellent fit of the thermodynamics of RNA hairpins and the MMTV pseudoknot. 37 We use the same value in the present study of BWYV as well. Thus, the force-field used in this study is the same as in our previous study attesting to its transferability for simulating small RNA molecules.\n\nThe native structure of the BWYV PK is taken from the PDB (437D). 32 The structure contains 28 nucleotides. We added an additional guanosine monophosphate to both the 5 and 3 terminus. Thus, the simulated PK has 30 nucleotides.\n\nThe mechanical force is applied to the ribose sugars of both the 5 -and 3 -terminus ( Figure 1A) . one has to be concerned about non-equilibrium effects. However, in optical tweezer experiments the pulling speed is low enough so that tension propagates uniformly through out the RNA prior to initiation of unfolding. 58 Thus, the un-folding of PK studied using LOT experiments 19 occurs at equilibrium, justifying comparisons to our explicit equilibrium simulations.\n\nTo analyze the structural transitions from which the phase diagrams are determined we stored snapshots every 10 4 time steps from all the trajectories.\n\nWe computed the radius of gyration (R g ), and the end-to-end distance (R ee ) using the stored snapshots. The fraction of native contacts, Q, is calculated by 500 counting the number of hydrogen-bond (HB) interaction pairs. The assessment of HB formation is based on the instantaneous value of the HB interaction energy, U HB . In our model, each HB interaction pair contributes up to nU 0 HB towards stability, where U 0 HB is -2.43 kcal/mol corresponding to the stability of one hydrogen bond and n represents number of hydrogen bond associated in 505 the interaction. 37 A cut-off value nU C HB is defined to pick out contacts that are established. We use a value, U C HB = \u22121.15 kcal/mol to obtain the diagram using Q as an order parameter (see below). Modest changes in U C HB do not affect the results qualitatively. "}
