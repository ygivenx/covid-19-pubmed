Furthermore, this phenomenon has been utilized to identify putative receptors for the import of proteins into mitochondria (Pain et al., 1990) , and anti-anti-IgE idiotypic antibodies have been shown to mimic IgE in their binding to FCe receptor on mast cells involved in complex allergic responses (Baniyash and Eshhar, 1987) .\n\nThese results suggest that there may exist significant structural mimicry between the \"complementarity determining regions\" (CDRs) of internal image Ab2s and the original antigen. This represents one of the most interesting areas of structure-function relations, and several structural studies dealt with this unique problem. Since X-ray crystallography is currently the only technique capable of solving this problem on a molecular level, in this chapter, we will try to summarize the results obtained by crystallographic analysis of components of the idiotypic cascade.\n\nStructural studies of idiotypic cascades have been carried out using exclusively antibody fragments (reviewed in Mariuzza and Poljak, 1993; Pan et al., 1995) . This is because intact antibodies are large and flexible molecules which are rather difficult to crystallize (Harris et al., 1992) (Figure 1 , opposite). Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies have shown that antibody Fab fragments are multimeric proteins consisting of light (L) and heavy (H) polypeptide chains appearing as four homologous globular domains, organized in pairs, that share a common 3-D arrangement. The \"immunoglobulin\" fold consists of two antiparallel P-sheets formed by three and four antiparallel strands in the constant light (CL) and heavy (CHI) domains, and five and four antiparallel strands in variable light (VL) and heavy (VH) domains. These are connected by loops showing a conserved topology (for reviews, see Amzel and Poljak, 1979; Davies and Metzger, 1983; Alzari et al., 1988; Davies et al., 1990) . The specificity of immunoglobulins is determined by the amino acid sequences of three hypervariable loops of both the heavy and the light chains of a variable domain. These CDRs occur at the extremities of the molecule, fully exposed to solvent, where they form the antigen binding site. Using the techniques of molecular biology it is also possible to produce, by expression in bacteria, only VH-VL domain pairs, called Fv. Utilizing this system it is possible to perform site directed mutagenesis, and selectively change amino acids forming CDRs, and monitor the binding capabilities of new antibody combining regions.\n\nIn order to study the relationship between an antiidiotypic antibody and the original antigen it is necessary to know the structure of both on a molecular level, and preferably to know the details of interactions between idiotype and each of these molecules. This, on the other hand would require two different complexes to be crystallized and their structures determined. This illustrates the difficulty associated with this type of study. To date, there have been five different investigations dealing with anti-idiotypes. These involved two different studies of an anti-lysozyme idiotypic system Fields et al., 1995) , an anti-angiotensin II system (Garcia et al., 1992) , an anti-feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) system (Ban et al., 1994) , an anti-lipopolysaccharide A antigen of Brucella abortus system (Evans et al., 1994) , and an anti-anti-idiotypic Fab fragment belonging to the high molecular weight-melanoma associated antigen (HMW-MAA) idiotypic cascade (Ban et al., 1996) .\n\nThe first crystallographic analysis of the idiotope-antiidiotope (Id-anti-Id) phenomena on a molecular level was achieved by Poljak and co-workers . This study included solving the structure of a complex between a Fab fragment of D 1.3 antibody in complex with lysozyme, and the structure of a complex between the Fab fragment of idiotypic D1.3 and a Fab fragment of an anti-idiotypic antibody E225. Antiidiotypic antibody E225 was shown to be an Ab2p, carrying an internal image of an external antigen. The structure of the Id-anti-Id complex was solved at 2.5 A.\n\nTwo molecules forming a complex are approximately aligned along their long axis. The interaction between the idiotype and anti-idiotype is formed primarily through hypervariable regions. There are 13 residues on five CDRs of the D 1.3 that interact with fourteen residues on six CDRs of the anti-idiotypic E225. There is also one framework residue on the V^ domain of each molecule that contributes to the binding interactions. Both the Fab of the anti-idiotypic E225 and the Fab of the idiotypic D1.3 are centered on V^ domains of the complementary molecule in the complex. In spite of this interaction involving primarily W^ domains, the V^^ domain on the anti-Id is responsible for 45% of the contacts. There are nine hydrogen bonds formed upon complex formation, and one salt link between E225 Arg ^^o and D1.3 Asp\"^^ (summarized in Table I .A.).\n\nThe paratope of D1.3 (lysozyme binding site) consists of 13 residues. Of these 13 residues, seven are in common with the residues recognized by the antiidiotype E225 (Table LA. ). Comparison of the CDRs of the idiotypic D1.3 in the Id-anti-Id complex and the complex between Fab, or Fv with the antigen lysozyme, showed that there are significant side chain conformational changes. This is probably the result of different steric requirements for binding of the lysozyme versus the anti-idiotype by the idiotopic D1.3. Interestingly, there is no conformational change of the side chains when free D1.3 idiotope is compared with that bound to the antigen (Bhat et al., 1990) .\n\nThis structure did not provide a molecular explanation for the mechanism of anti-idiotypic mimicry. A detailed comparison of the nature of the interactions within the lysozyme-Dl.3 and the D1.3-E225 complex showed them to be quite different. There are Figure 1 . Ribbon representation of the structure of the murine antibody against canine lymphoma determined by X-ray analysis of the triclinic crystals. The heavy chains are shown in yellow and blue, while the light chains are in red. The Fc stem of the molecule projects towards the viewer and assumes an asymmetric, oblique orientation with respect to the Fabs. This orientation illustrates the vast difference in hinge angles of about 65\u00b0 and US''. One of the Fabs is viewed along the axis through the switch peptides. This Fab has an elbow angle of 143\u00b0, in contrast to the other which has an elbow of 159\u00b0. several plausible explanations for this: a) there are structural differences that occur at the combining site of the idiotopic D1.3; b) the open loop structure of anti-idiotypic antibody's CDRs may not be able to mimic the partly ahelical conformation of the lysozyme epitope recognized by the idiotopic D1.3; and, c) the potential for anti-idiotopic mimicry is reduced because of only partial overlap between the paratope and the idiotope of D 1.3. In addition, anti-idiotopic antibody E225 has a con-siderably lov^er affinity for D1.3 (2.0 x lOVM) than the original lysozyme antigen (1.4 x 107M).\n\nAnother very interesting study on the molecular basis of antigen mimicry v^as completed using again an antilysozyme idotypic cascade (Fields et al., 1995) . This analysis was the first to visualize molecular mimicry of the external antigen (lysozyme) by an anti-idiotypic . Stereo view of the structure of the two 2-fold related mAb GH1002 Fab molecules reveals \"head on\" positioning of variable heavy and light chains with respect to the corresponding subunits of the other molecule along the direction of p strands. The Fab molecule is in magenta (light chain) and dark blue (heavy chain). The 2-fold axis crosses between the two Fabs approximately in the plane of the paper (panel A). Molecular surface of the Ab3-Ab3 complex demonstrates tight interaction between the two molecules. The orientation and color scheme is the same as in panel A (panel B). Figure 8 . Stereo view of the combining site of anti-anti-Id mAb GH1002. The 2-fold axis of symmetry is approximately in the plane of the paper and vertical. This makes atoms on the left side of the image interact with atoms on the right side of the image of the two identical, 2-fold related, molecules. In panel A, all atoms are shown as space filling models. There are 116 van der Waals contacts and 13 probable hydrogen bonds. Twelve groups involved in hydrogen bonding are labeled to facilitate identification of contact points between the two Fabs. The hydrogen bond acceptors are labeled with red and donors with blue. Threonine labeled with magenta is interacting with itself and can be either donor or acceptor. In panel B, this region is buried upon complex formation. The surface is color coded according to the distance between two molecules in the complex. antibody (E5.2). The mimicry is achieved by extensive overlap between the paratope and the idiotope of D1.3. Virtually the same residues of idiotypic D1.3 are involved in binding the original antigen and the anti-idiotope. Furthermore, there is a considerable similarity in the nature of the interactions of the idotypic Dl .3 in the antigen-idiotype and the Id-anti-Id complex, and the affinity of the E5.2 for the D1.3 of 1.4 X lOVM approaches the affinity between the antigen and D1.3 of 2.7 x lOVM.\n\nIn this study, the interaction between idiotope and anti-idiotope was performed by crystallographic analysis of respective Fv fragments of antibodies. The contacts involve all six CDRs of the two antibodies. Tyr^\"^^ is the only residue on both antibodies that is involved in interface contacts. The V^^ domains of the two molecules are responsible for a majority of contacts. The V^ domain of the anti-idiotope accounts for 77% of the total contacts with the idiotope. Upon complex formation, 912 A^ of the idiotope and 974 A^ of the anti-idiotope are buried.\n\nComparing the structures of the idiotypic antibody D1.3 CDRs in complex with the anti-idiotype with the original antigen, no structural changes were observed. Significant overlap of the paratope and idiotope was evident in the observation of 13 residues on the idiotopic D1.3 interacting both with the antiidiotopic E5.2 and the antigen. These residues make up 75% (687 A^) of the interaction area with the antiidiotope and 87% (675 A^) of the interacting area with the lysozyme. Besides surface complementarity, there are also six out of 12 hydrogen bonds in the D1.3-E5.2 complex that are structurally equivalent to the hydrogen bonds formed in the Dl .3-lysozyme complex. This was not observed in the case of the D1.3-E225 complex. Interestingly, solvent molecules contribute to the binding mimicry. The positions of 11 water molecules are conserved to within 1 A in both the D1.3-E5.2 and D 1.3-lysozyme interfaces. Interactions between the two different Id-anti-Id complexes and an antigen-antibody complex are compared in Figure 2 \n\nFor this idiotope-anti-idiotope system the original antigen was the E2 peplomer, a large glycoprotein, of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). The E2 peplomer was chosen as an antigen because it is responsible for: a) the binding of virus to plasma membranes of susceptible cells, b) cell fusion, c) induction of cell-mediated cytotoxicity of infected cells, and d) induction of neutralizing antibody (Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . This virus, antigenically similar to other coronaviruses, including human coronavirus 229E (Pedersen and Black, 1983) , produces a fatal disease in both wild and domestic cats that has defied conventional vaccines (Escobar et al., 1992) . A salient observation was that anti-idiotypic antibody 409.5.3 raised against Abl 730.1.4, when injected back into mice, elicited the production of Ab3 antibodies that had FIP virus neutralizing properties. This indicated that the combining properties of the original epitope were transmitted by the Ab2. (38) . Loop H3 has 12 amino acids and forms a long hairpin structure that extends towards L2 and LI on the light domain. Two ridges on the surface of the combining site are formed by LI, L3 and H3 on one side and HI and H2 on the other. Four hypervariable regions of the Fab2 can be classified as belonging to the canonical structures L2j, L3^, HI J and H2^ (Chothia et al, 1989) . Even though loop HI can be classified as Hl^, it has a conformation different from the canonical structure: the side chain of residue Phe 27 is buried within the framework structure instead of residue Phe 29 in the canonical structure model. On the other hand residue Phe 29 of this loop is oriented towards the V^-V^ domain interface and partially buried. Sequence analysis of the Fab2 indicated that the LI region belongs to the mouse kappa light chain subgroup IV (Kabat et al., 1991) . This loop has 10 residues and main chain atoms of residues 25-27a and residue 33 follow the canonical structure model. Hydrophilic serines between residues 29-31 form a turn that is one residue longer than the turn in the LI^ loop of HyHel-5. Loop H3 of Fab2 has 10 amino acids and forms a broad turn stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the side chain of Arg 94 and the carbonyl oxygen of Phe 97. The Fab2 CDR's surface is undulating, with no deep grooves as are observed when the antigen is a small molecule (Davies et al., 1990) . A shallow cavity exists between the LI, H3 and H2 loops.\n\nTwo views of the complex are shown in Figure 3 (see p. 23). The two Fab molecules interact by direct juxtaposition of their complementary CDRs. The Fabs are rotated by 61\u00b0 about the long axis of the complex with respect to one another. The pseudo 2-fold axes relating y^ and Vj^ domains of the two fragments are nearly coUinear, the angle between their axes being 154\u00b0. By this rotation, the heavy chain of one molecule is interacting almost entirely with the heavy chain of the other, and similarly light chain with light, but to a much lesser extent. The major axis of the complex is approximately 140 A.\n\nSurface representations of the CDRs that form the interface between the two Fabs are shown in Figure  4 (p. 24). There is a striking degree of structural and chemical complementarity between the two, consistent with observations for other antibody-antigen complexes (Davies et al., 1990) . Even though water molecules can not be reliably visualized at 2.9 A resolution, there appear to be no buried waters in the interface. Upon complex formation, 1750 A^ are buried. Of this surface, Fabl accounts for 860 A^ and Fab2 for 890 A^. These values are significantly greater than the values observed with Fab lysozyme complexes, but very close to the buried surface area in the case of a neuraminidase-Fab complex which conceals about 885 A^ for the Fab and 878 A for the neuraminidase . The heavy chain of 409.5.3 dominates the binding and contributes 63% of the surface area of the anti-idiotope buried in the complex. The surface of the Fabl CDR may be described as slightly concave so that the antiidiotypic Fab, the antibody in this system, protrudes into it.\n\nEnthalpic contributions in the formation of antibody-antigen complexes arise from van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Hypervariable loops of two Fabs in contact through van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds are: LI (minor contributor), L3, HI, H2 and H3 of Fabl (58 atoms) and LI, L3 (minor contributor), HI, H2 and H3 of Fab2 (59 atoms). Loops LI, L2, HI and H2 on one Fab are in proximity to loops LI, L3, HI and H3, respectively, on the other molecule ( Figure 5 ). In total, 19 residues of the idiotope and 17 residues of the anti-idiotope participate in 111 long van der Waals interactions <4.11 A and seven short interactions <3.44 A (Sheriff et al., 1987) (Table l .D, pp. 30-31). The interaction is further stabilized by nine hydrogen bonds. The maximum distance between electronegative atoms of a hydrogen bond pair is 3.5 A.\n\nIn both cases residues of Rabat's heavy chain FRl are involved in the interaction. According to the canonical structure model, these residues belong to the binding site loop HI (Chothia et al., 1989) . Overlap between the hypervariable region HI deduced from immunoglobulin sequence analysis (Kabat et al., 1991) and the structural loop HI (Chothia et al., 1989 ) is only two amino acids. It is probable that the HI region defined by Chothia et al. (1989) is mainly responsible for interaction with the antigen even though it shows less sequence variation than Rabat's HI region.\n\nThe 730.1.4 idiotope is predominately located on its heavy chain which contributes 71% to the buried area on the idiotope. Since V^^ domains usually contribute more surface area in antibody-protein interactions (Davies et al., 1990) , it is likely that this domain dominates the interaction between the idiotypic antibody and the antigen. In the structure of the Id-anti-Id complex (anti-lysozyme D1.3 Fab and its anti-idiotypic E225 Fab) both Fabs are centered on V^ domains of opposing Fabs and interact primarily through their V^^ domains. On the other hand, the V^^ domain of idiotypic Fab D1.3 dominates the interaction with lysozyme. This is the reason that the paratope and the idiotope in the Dl .3-E225 system only partially overlap, thus reducing the potential for total molecular mimicry.\n\nIn the case of the FIP virus antibody system described here, Abl recognizes an epitope on the E2 peplomer of the FIP virus as shown by Western blots (Escobar et al., 1992) even when the E2 protein is completely denatured. This suggests that Abl may be specific, not strictly for a structurally unique epitope, but for a sequence unique epitope on the antigen.\n\nIt may be noteworthy that a comparison of the sequences of the three light and three heavy chain CDRs with the known sequence of the antigen shows homology in two instances. In both LI and HI there is near identity with sequences of six residues that occur in the antigen. The LI CDR sequence is Val-Ser-Ser-Ser-Ile-Ser, which differs with the segment on the E2 peplomer beginning at position 276 having sequence Ile-Ser-Ser-Ser-Ile-Ser by the conservative substitution of valine for isoleucine at the first position. Similarly, the HI loop is Gly-Phe-Thr-Phe-Asn-Asn, which matches the Gly-Phe-Ser-Phe-Asn-Asn sequence of the antigen beginning at residue 1451. Here again, only the conservative change from serine to threonine marks a difference. These two regions of homology on the anti-idiotope provide important contacts with the idiotypic antibody originally produced in response to antigen. Homologous residues on LI of the anti-idiotope are involved in 36 van der Waals contacts and two hydrogen bonds, and those on HI form 18 van der Waals contacts and the one hydrogen bond presented in Table l .D (pp. 30-31) and in Figure 5 (below). The possibility exists, therefore, that antigen sequence information determining specificity may in fact be preserved through the idiotypic antibody and be made to reappear in the structure of the anti-idiotypic response.\n\nAn exciting structural study dealing with antiidiotopes was published by Garcia et al. (1992) . This work utilized a system in which monoclonal antibody against the angiotensin II (All), an octapeptide which plays a central role in the regulation of blood pressure in humans and other mammals, was used to obtain anti-idiotypic antibodies. Using these polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies as an immunogen, anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced. One of these anti-anti-idiotopes in particular, designated Mabl31, was found to bind All with high Chothia (38) , except for loops H3 which follow the convention of Kabat (39) . Density of the square in the matrix is a function of distance, ranging from darkest <6.5 A to lightest at 12.5 A.

The numbering of amino acids follows the convention of Kabat (30) , except in section A where the sequence of the idiotope E225 and the anti-idiotope D 1.3 is numbered sequentially. Van der Waals contacts, where available, are indicated with numbers in parenthesis beside a residue name and number. Hydrogen bonds and salt links are indicated with number and letter H and S, respectively. A. Contacts between D1.3 (Abl) and E225 (Ab2). Under the lysozyme column the type of contact between idiotopic D1.3 and the lysozyme is specified according to the D1.3 residues involved.

Contacts between two self complementary mAb GH1002 Fab molecules. affinity (7.3 x 107M), a value similar to that of the original antibody which had an affinity constant of 3.2 X 107M. The structure of the anti-anti-idiotypic Mabl31 in complex with the angiotensin II was solved at 2.9 A resolution. The combining site of the Mabl31 has long hypervariable loops, especially LI and H3. Loops LI and H2 form a deep cleft between them, while H3 runs in the middle of the cleft and folds back, forming a flat foundation for the combining site. In the complex, 22 residues on five out of six hypervariable loops of the antibody are in contact with the antigen. There is 725 A^ of the Fab and 620 A^ of the peptide buried in the complex. The peptide predominantly interacts with the heavy chain of the Mabl31. Loops LI, L3, H2, and H3 are main contributors to the binding interactions, and contribute 91% of the total buried area. Several polar contacts can be characterized as hydrogen bonds between: AIIArg^-Mabl31^^^ AIIHis^-Mabl31Ser^^^ and Arg\"^^ carboxy-terminal carboxylate of AII-MabArg\"^^ and Arg\"^\u00b0.\n\nAnti-idiotypic antibodies in this system transmitted information describing the original antigen and elicited Mab 131. To probe the possibility that perhaps one CDR loop on the anti-idiotope could have had a conformation similar to the bound All, the authors searched the crystallographic structural database. Their analysis indicated that backbone atoms of the All peptide resemble a CDR loop belonging to the canonical structure L3j. Thus, it is possible that the anti-idiotypic antibody in this system has a CDR that resembles angiotensin II and, fiirther, that Ab3 binding to this CDR also binds to the antigen. In this instance, the mimic of the peptide in the Ab2 may be a single hypervariable loop.\n\nto the same site on the idiotope as the antigen. Crystallographic analysis of the complex between a Fab fragment of YsT9.1 and a Fab fragment of T91AJ5 revealed that anti-idiotypic T91AJ5 was unable to carry an internal image of the original antigen because the polysaccharide binding cleft is too narrow and deep to allow comprehensive contact with the Ab2 CDRs (Evans et al., 1994) . This makes T91AJ5 antibody a class Y anti-idiotype.\n\nTwo molecules forming a complex interact head to head, with the angle between the pseudo 2-fold axis of the variable domain dimers equal to 178\u00b0. The two Fabs are rotated approximately 90\u00b0, with respect to each other along the long axis of the complex. All inter-Fab contacts in the complex occur through CDRs except for the amino terminus of the heavy chain of the anti-idiotype. Heavy and light chains of each Fab contact both heavy and light chains of the other Fab. There are 12 putative hydrogen bonds at the interface of this complex (Table 1 . C, pp. 30-31) . Tyrosine residues predominate in the formation of hydrogen bonds, and they also form a large aromatic ring network which spans three of the four variable domains. The total solvent excluded area is 730 A^ for the idiotope and 760 A^ for the anti-idiotope. Each Fab has two distinct binding surfaces as a result of the groove structure of the idiotope (Figure 6, p. 24 ). The groove on the idiotypic YsT9.1 segregates light and heavy chains, while the two binding surfaces of the anti-idiotope are shared between heavy and light chains. The antigen binding groove on the YsT9.1 is 20 A long, 15 A wide and 10 A deep. The binding surface of the anti-idiotope does not contact lower sides and the floor of the groove on the idiotope. This depression might be too deep to construct hypervariable loops of the antiidiotypic antibody which would fill it completely, and this, it appears, is what would be required in order to make an effective mimic for the antigen.\n\nThe murine monoclonal antibody YsT9.1 binds cell wall polysaccharide A antigen of Brucella abortus (the causative agent of brucellosis in bovidae and Homo sapiens). The polysaccharide antigen is anal,2-linked polymer of 4,6-dideoxy-4-formamido-a-D-mannopyranose. None of the anti-idiotopic antibodies raised against idiotypic YsT9.1 were found to mimic the antigen, although these Ab2s competed for the antigen binding site of the idiotopic antibody with the polysaccharide antigen. Chemical modification studies suggested that anti-idiotypic antibody T91AJ5 binds\n\nCrystallographic analysis of the Fab fragment of the mouse anti-anti-Id mAb GH1002 (Ab3) revealed that it exists in the crystal as dimers related by crystallographic 2-fold axes (Ban et al., 1996) . This antibody was elicited with the syngeneic anti-Id mAb MK2-23 . The latter mAb, which bears an internal image of the antigenic determinant defined by anti-HMW-MAA mAb 763-774, has been shown to induce anti-HMW-MAA immunity in patients with malignant melanoma (Kusama et al., 1989; Chen etal., 1991; Mittlemanetal., 1992; Chen et al., 1993) . To characterize the immunological and structural organization of the idiotypic cascade in the HMW-MAA, a panel of anti-anti-Id mAbs was developed from a BALB/c mouse immunized with mAb MK2-23 . Immunochemical analysis of 11 anti-anti-Id mAbs showed that eight reacted with the immunizing mAb MK2-23 and with HMW-MAA, and three with the immunizing mAb MK2-23 alone. The latter three include mAb GH1002 which binds anti-Id mAb MK2-23 with an association constant of 4 x 107M and inhibits its binding to the Id mAb 763.74.\n\nThis Fab fragment shares, along with other Fabs whose crystal structures have been determined, a common 3-D fold. The elbow angle of the molecule is 176\u00b0. The CDR's surface is undulating with a relatively deep cavity formed by the L2, L3, HI and heavy chain framework (FR)-3 regions. Five hypervariable regions of the mAb GH1002 can be classified as Ll^, L2j, L3j, HI J. (with a Trp instead of Gly at position 26) and m^ (with a Glu instead of Gly at position 55) (Chothia et al., 1989^ . A short H3 loop has seven amino acids and has no pronounced features such as bulky residues pointing at the surface of the binding region. This loop is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between residues Asp\"^^^ and Glu\"^^\u00b0. There is also a salt link formed between Arg\"^^ and Asp\"^\u00b0^ and Glu\"^^^\n\nPacking analysis revealed a tight interaction between four 2-fold related pairs of Fab fragments in the unit cell (Figure 7, p. 25 ). Although the combining region of the molecule accounts for a relatively small area of the whole Fab, the head-to-head interactions between the two molecules were responsible for nearly half of the total packing contacts. The crystallographic 2-fold axis bisected the complex between light and heavy chains. mAb GH1002 is crossreactive and, apparently, an auto-anti-anti-Id antibody, as it binds not only the immunizing mAb MK2-23, but also itself This can be summarized as follows:\n\nAbl Ab2 Abs] ...\n\nA view of the complex is shown in Figure 7 , p. 25. The two Fab molecules interact by direct juxtaposition of their CDRs. The Fab fragments are not noticeably rotated with respect to one another around the long axis of the complex, since their elbow angle axes are nearly parallel with the crystallographic 2fold axes. The pseudo 2-fold axes relating variable light and variable heavy domains of the two Fab fragments are coUinear. Because of this arrangement, the heavy and light chains of one molecule interact principally with the corresponding subunits of another molecule.\n\nSurface representations of the CDRs that form the interface between two Fab fragments are shown in Figure 8 , p. 26. The degree of structural and chemical complementarity between the two Fab fragments of mAb GH1002 is comparable with other antibodyantigen complexes (Davies et al., 1990) . Upon complex formation, 1103 A^ of surface area are buried on each Fab fragment. This value is significantly greater than those observed for most other complexes (Sheriff, 1993) . The heavy and light chains of mAb GH1002 play a similar role in the binding and each contribute approximately 50% of the total area of the anti-anti-Id mAb in the complex. The surface of the interface may be described as circular with a diameter of approximately 35 A and a small cavity in the center, presumably occupied by water molecules. Hypervariable loops of two Fabs in contact through van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds are: LI, L2, L3, HI, H2 (minor contributor), heavy chain FR3 and H3 (65 atoms). Loops LI and L2 on one Fab are in contact with loops LI and L2, on the other molecule, while heavy chain FR3 provides 17 van der Waals contacts and three hydrogen bonds, binding primarily to the same framework element of the symmetry related molecule. In total, 23 residues of the anti-anti-Id mAb participate in 116 van der Waals interactions <4.11 A (Table 1 .E, pp. 30-31). The interaction is further stabilized by 13 probable hydrogen bonds.\n\nThe self-complementary interaction of the Fab fragment of mAb GH1002 could be a consequence of crystallization conditions and be coincidental, but there is some evidence that would suggest otherwise. The extensive and intimate contact, judged according to buried surface area, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals bonds are not consistent with the more tenuous crystal packing interactions usually observed. Interactions are very tight and comparable to those seen in antibody-antigen complexes. In spite of the fact that antibodies and particularly Fab fragments are becoming the most studied family of proteins (Davies and Chacko, 1993; Padlan, 1994) , similar self-interaction has never been reported. Furthermore, the original antigen for this anti-anti-antibody is the CDR region of another antibody (anti-idiotypic MK2-23). It is possible that the interaction between the anti-antiidiotypic mAb GH1002 and the anti-idiotypic MK2-23 involves certain framework regions. These regions are likely to be similar for the two antibodies, and could be the basis for the self-recognition of GH1002 in the crystal.\n\nA possible physiological role is suggested by the observed structural complementarity, though, of course, there may be alternatives. Because it would be immunologically fiitile to prolong an anti-idiotypic cascade indefinitely, evolution of a cascade toward selfneutralization would provide a mechanism for modulation and ultimate termination. Indeed, isologous interactions based on dyad symmetry are usually the basis for energetically favorable protein-protein interactions in oligomers (Monod et al., 1965; Morgan et al., 1979) ; Id-anti-Id complexes of Fabs already possess pseudo dyad axes, by virtue of the roughly collinear disposition of Fabs, relating framework portions of the molecules Ban et al. 1994; Evans et al., 1994; Fields et al., 1995) , and the only parts of the antibody subject to change in an anti-idiotypic series, and therefore capable of exerting self regulation, are the CDRs.\n\nIf this idea is ftindamentally correct, then it implies that interacting antibodies downstream in the idiotypic cascade will have increasingly similar surfaces and that self recognition would be enhanced along the cascade as well. In the process, the structural information reflecting the original antigen would gradually be lost. The process could be summarized as follows:\n\nAg t Abl ^^-Ab2i ^\u2022-Ab3 \"\"-Ab4\n\nThe structure of the complex between anti-Id mAb MK2-23 and anti-anti-Id mAb GH1002 has not been solved yet. It seems likely, however, that the nature of the interaction between these two molecules will be considerably different from that for the Ab3-Ab3 complex. Formation of a 2-fold axis of symmetry between mAb MK2-23 and GH1002 is impossible, and it is likely that the general disposition of the antibodies forming the complex will be different, though some interactions may be similar to those observed in the complex described here."}
