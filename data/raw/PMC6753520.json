{"title": "The perceptions of natural compounds against dipeptidyl peptidase 4\nin diabetes: from in silico to in\nvivo", "body": "According to the statistics from International Diabetes Federation (IDF), there were\n425 million diabetes mellitus (DM) patients in 2017 worldwide, and that number is\nexpected to increase to 629 million by 2045.1 Abnormally high blood glucose caused by insulin insufficiency or\ninsensitivity can lead to severe complications such as chronic renal failure,\nmicrovascular complication, cerebrovascular accident, and infarction induced by high\nglycated serum and blood vessel proteins.2,3 Moreover, insufficient insulin\nsignal leads to the decreased glucose uptake from the blood that, in turn, can\nresult in ulcers, gangrene, diabetic retinopathy, and neuropathy.2 Recent DM treatment is inclined to maintain the blood glucose level within\nnormal limits by (e.g. nutritional therapy and physical management) and medication\ndue to the incurable nature of DM.4,5 Diabetic medications can be\ncharacterized into five strategies based on their acting mechanisms: raising insulin\nsecretion (e.g. sulfonylurea and meglitinide analogs), reducing intestinal glucose\nabsorption (e.g. acarbose), triggering insulin-independent glucose uptake signaling\n(e.g. thiazolidinedione and biguanide), reducing urinal glucose reabsorption (e.g.\ngliflozins), and prolonging insulin sensitive [e.g. dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4)\ninhibitor and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists] [American Diabetes\nAssociation, 2019b]. These antidiabetic drugs help DM patients to maintain their\nblood glucose levels with various adverse effects (Table 1), such as urine-tract infection,\nlactoacidosis, hypoglycemia, and obesity. These drug-related adverse effects can\ndeteriorate the quality of life of DM patients and create unsurmountable\ndifficulties for proper dosing regimens in a clinical setting. It has been observed\nthat DPP-4 inhibitors can exert a similar efficacy in reducing blood glucose levels\nwithout severe adverse effects such as hypoglycemia as compared with sulfonylurea.6 Nevertheless, various adverse side effects associated with the current DPP-4\ninhibitor can still be observed that, in turn, can severely limit their practical\napplication. As such, there is a clinical demand for novel DPP-4 inhibitors from\nvarious sources including chemical synthesis and botanic sources containing herbs\nand plants with fewer side effects. In this article, we have reviewed various\napproaches including in silico, in vitro enzymatic and cell assays,\nand in vivo animal tests in the search for natural DPP-4 inhibitors\nfor the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nDPP-4, which is a 88 kDa serine protease, contains one region of cytoplasmic\nregion (amino acids 1\u20136) coupled with transmembrane domain (amino acids 7\u201328)\nand extracellular region (amino acids 29\u2013766) with the main catalytic domain.14 There are two DPP-4 isoforms in the body: membrane-bound DPP-4 (mDPP-4)\ncomposed of full-length DPP-4 peptide; and soluble DPP-4 (sDPP-4), whose\ncytoplasmic and transmembrane regions are absent.14 Both forms can exert various biological activities in regulation of\nphysiology and pathology.15\n\nsDPP-4 is secreted by lymphocytes, circulates in the blood,16 and shows high concentration in kidney.17 It has been observed that sDPP-4 plays various roles in improving\nskeleton muscle activity, immunocyte activation, chemotaxis, and homeostasis.\nsDPP-4 can secrete into serum via the response of skeletal\nmuscle cells upon acute physical activities or feeding protein hydrolysate.18 Secreted sDPP-4 can reduce vasoconstriction that is caused by\nneuropeptide Y (NPY) and subsequently increase the arteriolar diameter of\nskeletal muscle that provides a physiological explanation for raising training\nefficiency caused by sDPP-4.19,20 In addition to arteriolar\ndiameter of skeletal muscle, secreted sDPP-4 acts as myokine, which stimulates\ninflammation in smooth muscles from blood vessel through activating\nprotease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2)/ERK/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, increasing\nproinflammatory cytokine release and finally stimulating smooth muscle cell proliferation.21 However, sDPP-4-induced smooth muscle inflammation is not always good to\nthe body. For instance, Romacho et al. reported sDPP-4 might\ncause microvascular endothelial dysfunction, which is the cause of chronic\nkidney disease in elders, through the same signaling with smooth muscle\ninflammation.22,23 Thus, Dub\u00e9 et al. illustrated that\ncardiovascular inflammation can be attenuated by DPP-4 inhibitor in the process\nof HIV treatment, and that leads to diminish cardiovascular morbidity of HIV treatment.24 In T-cell activation, sDPP-4 can activate T-cell proliferation\nvia co-stimulation with T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and\nToll-like receptor, whose activation is neither associated with its enzymatic\nactivity nor with adenosine deaminase binding.25\u201328 On the other hand, sDPP-4\ncan upregulate the expressions of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in monocyte through\ncaveolin-1/ERK/NF-\u03baB/c-Fos signaling, which is involved in monocyte proliferation.29 It is noteworthy that Tansi et al. proved the\ninteraction between DPP-4 and HIV-1 transcription regulator Tat (HIV-1-Tat).30 Markedably, the effect on DPP-4/HIV-1-Tat in viral infection and\nproliferation needs further investigative attention. The role of sDPP-4 in\nchemotaxis regulation is related to the degradation of chemokine. Hematopoietic\nstem cell homing is attracted by stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1/CXCL12)\nand colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), which are substrates of both sDPP-4 and\nmDPP4.15,31 Accordingly, sDPP-4 inhibition can improve success rate of\ntransplantation after analyzing the relationship between sDPP-4 activity and\nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation.32 The known DPP-4 (both soluble and membrane-bound forms) substrates\ninclude numerous homeostatic hormones such as GLP-1, NPY, glucagon, peptide Y,\nand secretin, which accurately regulate blood sugar homeostasis.15 GLP-1 is involved in insulin sensitivity and secretion, food reward, and\nappetite through ghrelin and leptin, and cellular metabolism with\nadiponectin.15,33\u201335 NPY blocks\nmelanocortin-4 receptor signaling and leads to the reduction of energy\nconsumption and possibility of obesity.36,37 After secretion from\nintestinal L cell, GLP-1 is rapidly degraded by sDPP-4 into inactive GLP-1\namide, in which half-life is shorter than 2 min.38 In dysglycemic patients, active GLP-1 content can be further decreased\nand cause more severe hyperglycemia.39 Accordingly, inhibiting sDPP-4 activity can keep more active GLP-1 and\nNPY in serum and thus improve insulin efficiency.40 Other biological activities including nonimmunodeficient virus infection\nare also explored. It has been demonstrated by the case study of Middle East\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection that sDPP-4 can\npotentially function to block viral infection.41,42 Truncated C-X-C chemokine\n10 (CXCL10) secretion in persistent infection of hepatitis C is essential,43 implying that DPP-4 may play a role in HCV persistent infection as\nmanifested by a case report, in which a DM patient complicated with HCV\ninfection showed HCV replication reduction after sitagliptin treatment.44 sDPP-4 is essential for maintaining immune activity and chemotaxis,\nespecially in inflammatory regulation, based on all available information of its\nbiological activities. Thus, the serum activity of sDPP-4 can be an indicator of\nphysiological or immunological stages.\n\nThe effect of serum sDPP-4 activity can be classified into several categories:\ninfection related damage, transplantation or autoimmune disease, respiratory\ndisease, and response to diabetic medications and complications, as discussed in\ndetail in the following. Serum sDPP-4 activity in HIV infection is referred to\nthe HIV-induced intestinal damage that is caused by Th17 cell\ndepletion.45,46 It has been observed that rheumatoid arthritis and multiple\nsclerosis patients have lower serum sDPP-4 activity than healthy\npeople,47,48 whereas HIV patients have higher serum sDPP-4 activity.49 Moreover, Leicht et al. analyzed sDPP-4 activity in\nend-stage renal disease patients before and after kidney transplantation, and\nsDPP-4 activities were found to decrease after kidney transplantation.50 These results suggest that serum sDPP-4 activity can be a potential\nbiomarker for monitoring the progress of autoimmune disease and the prognosis of\norgan transplantation. Interestingly, serum sDPP-4 activity can be associated\nwith the progress of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),51 which is highly correlated with respiratory inflammation, obviously\nindicating the relationship between serum sDPP-4 activity and COPD progression.52 However, the prognosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), which is\na rare pulmonary malignancy, can be predicted by sDPP-4 activity in pleural fluid.53 The pathological correlation between sDPP-4 activity and MPM prognosis is\nstill veiled. These reports provide interesting suggestions about sDPP-4 levels\nas the biomarkers of various diseases, which are not easy to monitor in serum or\nother body fluid.\n\nRemarkably, mDPP-4 can be found mainly in the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, T\nlymphocytes, and reproductive organs.54,55 Biological activities of\nmDPP-4 include the regulation of immune response and blood vessel function.15 mDPP4, also named CD26, is a T-cell co-stimulator of T-cell receptor\nresponding to antigen-presenting cells.56 Thus, mDPP-4 recently has been considered as a potent target in treatment\nof transplantation and autoimmune disease. Dolanbay et al.\nreported an interesting study about the impact of mDPP-4 inhibition in early\npregnancy that can be important in treating recurrent implantation failure.57 In hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,\ngraft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication,\nwhich is critical in survival rate after transplantation.58 Zhang et al. proved the association between Th17 cells\nand GVHD and which Th17 cell can be regulated by mDPP-4 inhibition that\nindicates current DPP-4 inhibitors can help ameliorating the onset of GVHD.59 The impact of mDPP-4 in immune regulation is also implicated in\nautoimmune disease and hypersensitivity. mDPP-4 expression levels in\nCD8+ T cells of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis patients are\nsignificantly lower than healthy subjects that is plausibly attributed to\ndisease progression.60 In contrast, mDPP-4 levels are almost 11-fold higher in psoriatic skin\nthan in normal skin, asserting the involvement of mDPP-4 in psoriatic development.61 mDPP-4 plays a positive role in asthma progress through promoting T-cell activation.62 These reports have unequivocally demonstrated the positive role played by\nmDPP-4 in immune regulation. mDPP-4 acts on both endothelial and epithelial\ncells in regulation of blood vessel function,. In addition to endothelial\ninflammation caused by sDPP-4, the role of mDPP-4 in endothelial generally\ninvolves the endothelial migration, angiogenesis, and proliferation under\nhypoxia status, which can be found in the development of endometriosis.63 Xu et al. have pointed out that DPP-4 inhibitors that\ncan alleviate pulmonary artery remodeling and, finally, delay the development of\npulmonary hypertension.64 In the regulation of cardiovascular function, mDPP-4 inhibition can\nreverse diastolic left ventricular dysfunction via inhibiting\nmDPP-4/SDF-1\u03b1 related angiogenesis.65 mDPP-4 involves in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) for epithelial cell,66 suggesting the potential implication of mDDP-4 in promoting cancer\ndevelopment. In fact, breast cancer metastasis can be triggered by DPP4\ninhibition through CXCL12/CXCR4/mTOR pathway.67 However, DPP-4 inhibitor shows the opposite activity in non-small cell\nlung cancer, which suppresses cancer cell growth via\nmacrophage-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation.68 Collectively, these studies have furnished comprehensive descriptions of\nmDPP-4 biological functions in the whole body and further manifest that DPP-4\ninhibition (sDPP-4 or mDPP-4) can produce unexpected side effects.\n\nThe endocrinological impact of DPP-4 is more prominent in the mediation of blood\nglucose. DPP-4 inhibition is a predominant approach for treating diabetes\nbecause of prolonged incretin half-lives within serum, especially in type 2 DM.69 In addition, it has been suggested that sitagliptin can preserve\npancreatic \u03b2-cell function and subsequently stabilize insulin secretion as shown\nby two 4-year clinical trials, in which sitagliptin was adopted to treat slowly\nprogressive type 1 DM (SPTIDDM) and latent autoimmune diabetes adult\n(LADA).55,70 In addition to clinical treatment, DPP-4 levels can be used\nas a biomarker. For instance, high serum sDPP-4 levels can be referred to the\nelevated glycation end products, which subsequently evoke endothelial cell\ndamage and diabetic nephropathy incidence.71,72 In addition, high serum\nsDPP-4 levels also indicate worse drug response to DPP-4 inhibitor and\nhyperglycemia, which are the indicators of poor glycemic control and advanced\ndisease progress.73,74 The above information emphasizes the effect of DPP-4\ninhibition and monitoring in DM treatment. The method of screening DPP-4\ninhibitor and the recent known natural DPP-4 inhibitors are presented in the\nfollowing.\n\nVirtual screening has been seamlessly integrated into drug discovery and development75 and its success significantly relies on compound library,76 especially the structural diversity of compound library.77 For instance, microalgal metabolites were screened for DDP-4 inhibitors.78 Compared with the synthesized chemicals, natural compound libraries\ngenerally consist of more structurally diverse compounds than their synthetic counterparts,79 providing a better screening resource. As such, numerous studies have\nadopted various natural compound libraries to find novel DDP-4 inhibitors as\nlisted in Table\n2.\n\nIt is not uncommon to observe that docking studies were carried out based on a\nsingle DDP-4 crystal structure, despite the fact that a great number of\nDDP-4-inhibitor co-complex structures have been deposited in the Protein Data\nBank (PDB). Deng et al.88 for instance, docked a series of synthesized triazole-based uracil\nderivatives into the linagliptin-DDP4 co-complex structure (PDB code: 2RGU)\nusing the standard precision (SP) Glide (Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc.),\nwhich places internally generated ligand conformations with various positions\nand orientations into the binding pocket. Deng et al.89 employed Gold (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center),\nwhich is a genetic algorithm (GA)-based scheme to explore the conformational\nflexibility of ligand and the rotational flexibility of receptor, to dock\nsynthesized pyrazolo inhibitors into the quinazolinone-DDP4 co-complex structure\n(PDB code: 2ONC).90 It should be noted that both Glide and\nGold are flexible docking algorithms.91 Nevertheless, DDP-4 is unrestrained per se as manifested\nby the fact that DDP-4 consists of various binding subsites, namely\nS1, S\u20191, S2, S\u20192, and extensive\nS2, etc., to which the corresponding amino acids of the DDP4\nsubstrate peptide designated by P1, P\u20191, P2,\nP\u20192, etc. from the nearest to the farthest cleavage point can\nbind as shown in Figure\n1,92 and S2, which is composed of various hydrophobic residues,\nnamely GLU205 and GLU206 dyad and ARG125, is highly plastic.93 Furthermore, Nabeno et al. categorized inhibitors into\nthree different classes (Figure\n1) based on the interactions between inhibitor and DDP-4 subsites as\nlisted in Table 3,\nfrom which it can be observed that inhibitors of different classes bind to\ndifferent DDP-4 subsites, and S1 and S2 are the common\nbinding subsites.92 In fact, the root means square deviation (RMSD) between alogliptin-bound\nprotein conformation (PDB: 3G0B) and teneligliptin-bound one (PDB: 3VJK) is 1.07\n\u00c5, denoting the promiscuous nature of DDP-4 that can be further demonstrated by\nFigure 2, in which\nthe six DDP4 co-complex structures (PDB codes are 3W2T, 1X70, 3BJM, 2RGU, 3VJK,\nand 3G0B) are superimposed. Moreover, the diverse structures of inhibitors can\nalso manifest the plasticity of DPP4. Lee et al. for instance,\nanalyzed the chemical structures of those launched DDP-4 inhibitors and divided\nthem into different classes94 that, in turn, can be further noticeable the promiscuity of target protein.95 As such, the promiscuity of DDP-4 cannot be fully taken into account\nunless more sophisticated structure-based ensemble docking schemes such as\nSVM-Pose/SVM-Score combinatorial ensemble docking96 or analog-based pharmacophore ensemble schemes such as pharmacophore\nensemble/support vector machine97 can be adopted. It can be argued that molecular dynamics (MD) can be used\nto address the flexibility of DDP4 as illustrated by the study of Liu et\nal.98 Nevertheless, the lengthy MD calculation will substantially increase\ncomputational time and expense, making it impractical to be carried out in a\nhigh-throughput fashion, let alone the more resource-demanded quantum mechanical\n(QM)/molecular mechanics (MM) algorithm.99\n\nThere are four types of assay methods for screening DPP-4 inhibitors for direct\ntesting: direct enzymatic assay, in vitro cell assay,\nex vivo assay, and in vivo animal tests.\nDPP-4 and tested compounds are mixed in the direct enzymatic assay, followed by\nadding specific substrate peptides such as\ngly-pro-p-nitroanilide. The chemical\np-nitroanilide will be released from peptides and the amount is\ndetermined by optical absorption at 405 nm at noninhibition state.105 This method is fast for analysis and can be used to evaluate the\ninhibition pattern from calculated Ki values.\nHowever, the minimum changes within direct enzymatic assay cannot be directly\ntranslated into the actual bioactivity in cells and animals.106\nEx vivo assay can simulate the biological interaction within\nbody, whereas it needs fresh serum or tissue sample as the source of\nDPP-4.107,108 Moreover, previous studies reported that mucosal DPP-4\ninhibition can be possibly related to the onset of coeliac disease, which is an\nautoimmune disorder due to the immune response to gluten.109,110 However,\na modern version of DPP4 activity assay needs to homogenize the whole intestinal\nbiopsy that, in turn, can lead to mucosal DPP-4 inhibition.108 Yazbeck et al. have derived a new DPP4 substrate with\n13C isotope that can be released upon reaction with DPP-4.111 As such, the requirement to homogenize the biopsy is completely\nexonerated, leading to higher correlation as compared with its conventional counterparts.111\n\nMyocytes and pancreatic cells are often used in the cell-based assays to discover\nDPP-4 inhibitors. Because \u03b2-cells in pancreatic islet is an important GLP-1\ntarget, the downstream signaling of GLP-1 in pancreatic cells can be an\nindicator or biomarker of DPP-4 activity.112 In addition, GLP-1 attenuates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced\ncardiomyocyte inflammation. The variations of inflammatory signaling including\nNF-\u03baB, ERK, and TNF-\u03b1 within LPS-induced cardiomyocyte can indirectly gauge\nDPP-4 activity.113 Nevertheless, the results of cell-based assay can be an authentic\nrepresentative of the realistic situation mainly due to the fact that they do\nnot consider in vivo pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic\nfactors. Nevertheless, direct action upon target cells can be very helpful in\ndetailing intracellular dynamics prior to clinical or animal tests.\n\nDPP-4 inhibitors have been highlighted as potential regimen for\nautoimmune-disease based on the characteristics in T-cell activation and inflammation.55 Notably, autoimmune animal model becomes a platform for testing\nin vivo efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors in long-term administration.114 Alternatively, in vivo assay of DPP-4 inhibitory\nefficacy can be verified by diabetic animal model despite the fact that DPP-4\ncan degrade GLP-1, leading to insulin desensitization and secretion decrease.112 The most unvanquished limitation of in vivo test is that\nonly end-point effect can be observed in pre-testing drug candidate despite the\nfact that it is more related to clinical situations. The data retrieved from\nin vitro and direct enzymatic assay can be synergistically\nessential for understanding the conceivable hypoglycemic mechanism.\n\nThe effects of DPP-4 studies were mainly focused on immune, endocrine, and neuron\nsystem from the end of 1990s to early of 2000s.115\u2013117 A study reported in 2006\nthat incretin was the molecular target of DPP-4, suggesting the implication of\nDPP-4 inhibitor in diabetes treatment. Consequently, the diabetic research has\nturned into a new paradigm for searching for antidiabetic DPP-4 inhibitors.118 To date, only very limited natural DPP-4 inhibitors from various\nsources/origins have been reported (Table 4). Natural DPP-4 inhibitors from\ndifferent origins using different approaches for screening the compound to reach\nthe target are summarized as follows. In addition to plant source, DPP-4\ninhibitors from animals and microbes are single-subclasses, in which DPP-4\ninhibitors from animals and microbes are peptides and macrolides, respectively.\nInterestingly, the most predominant subclasses of DPP-4 inhibitors are\nterpenoids, peptides, phenolics, and flavonoids. These findings have implicated\nthat alkaloids are not suitable as DPP-4 inhibitors or their applications in\nDDP4 inhibition have not been well explored. In addition to pure compounds, some\ncrude extracts of natural materials or protein hydrolysates can exert DPP-4\ninhibition as well. For instance, the DPP-4 inhibition activities of methanol\nextracts of Ficus benghalensis, Syzigium cumini, Ocimum\nsanctum, and Eucalyptus sp. have been\ndemonstrated.119,120 The hypoglycemic efficacy of traditional Chinese\nantidiabetic medicines decoction of Schizandra chinensis\nBaill., Coptis chinensis, Psidium guajava L., and Morus\nalba L. has been verified by DPP-4 inhibition by in\nvivo test.121 The protein hydrolysates from whey, barbel, and yam can reduce the DPP-4\nactivity in enzymatic measurements.122\u2013125 Through partition by\nmolecular sieve, the highest inhibition peptide sequences of DPP-4 such as\nAla-Pro, Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, Trp-Ser-Gly, and Phe-Ser-Asp have been\nfound.126\u2013128\nNevertheless, these results from in vitro enzymatic assays\ncannot guarantee a promising future since physiological regulation of DPP-4 is\nfar more complicated than bench-top experiments. Therefore, the results from\ndirect enzymatic assay for new candidates or hits require further validation\nsuch as in vivo investigations to confirm their actual\ntherapeutic values when compared with clinical medicines.\n\nPrevious sections have described the biological functions, assay methods, and\nknown natural DPP-4 inhibitors, which are purported to treat DM. However, DPP-4\ninhibition can possibly cause unexpected sequela owing to its entanglement with\nimmune response and endothelial functions. In fact, the roles of DPP-4 in\ntumorigenesis and progression, respectively, have been reviewed\nrecently.144,145 In lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, DPP-4 inhibitor\ncan assuredly reduce cancer progression and promote the overall survival.146 However, in breast cancer, prostate cancer, and endometrial carcinoma,\nDPP-4 inhibition would cause the opposite consequence which promotes cancer\nprogression.67,147,148 The role of DPP-4 inhibition in cancer treatment is\ninconclusive, but it is certain that DPP-4 inhibition in tumorigenesis and tumor\ndevelopment in site-specific tumor should be considered.144,145 In\naddition to cancer development, opportunistic infection is another issue of\nDPP-4 inhibition. Anno et al. reported a 69-year-old DM\npatient, who developed fever after taking vildagliptin for 1 week owing to hypercytokinemia.149 It is obvious that numerous chemokines such as CXCL3, CXCL4, CXCL 5, and\nCXCL10 can also function as DPP-4 substrates.56 Chen et al. have found that DM patients with short-term\nDPP-4 inhibitor treatment are at higher risk of herpes zoster infection as\ncompared with non-DPP-4 treatment patients after surveying the Longitudinal\nHealth Insurance Database 2000.150 The development of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis and celiac disease are\ninversely correlated with DPP4 levels (vide supra), suggesting\nthat DPP-4 inhibition can promote disease progression. Inflammatory bowel\ndisease (IBD), which is a general term for Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative\ncolitis, is caused by opportunistic infection or immune cell\ninfiltration.151,152 A meta-analysis published by Radel et\nal. has indicated that DPP-4 inhibition can increase the risk of\nCrohn\u2019s disease.153 In conclusion, DPP-4 inhibitors can be used to treat DM, whereas their\ncomplications with other immune disease or cancer should be seriously\nconsidered.\n\nThe effect of virtual screening via computational biology or\ninformatics further combined with in vitro enzymatic and cell\nassay, and in vivo animal tests offer a promising approach to\ndiscover candidates or hits for expediting the preclinical development process\n(Figure 3).\nNevertheless, poor or ill drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and\ntoxicity (ADME/Tox) properties make substantial contributions to drug attritions,154 and little effort has been dedicated to profiling ADME/Tox properties of\nDDP-4 inhibitors. As such, it is necessary to predict ADME/Tox parameters in the\nprocess of virtual screening, which should be carried by adopting schemes that can\nconsider the unstructured nature of DDP-4, to minimize the late-stage failures."}
