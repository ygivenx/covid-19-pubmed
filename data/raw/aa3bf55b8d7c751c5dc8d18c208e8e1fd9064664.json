{"title": "Identification and evaluation of potent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 3CL Pro inhibitors", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) affecting upper respiratory tract were first identified in humans in mid-1960 (Tyrrell and Bynoe, 1965) . In late 2002, there was emergence of a life threatening CoV of atypical pneumonia, named severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV belongs to the family Coronaviridae, and is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus with~30,000 nucleotides (Rota et al., 2003) . Its genome encodes two polyproteins, pp1a (~490 kDa) and pp1ab (~790 kDa) which are processed by 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) and papain-like protease (PL pro ) to generate nonstructural proteins essential for viral replication (Thiel et al., 2001 (Thiel et al., , 2003 . Due to its vital role in replication, 3CL pro has been regarded as a validated drug target. Many inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL pro were discovered by high throughput screening and structure-based rational design as summarized in the review articles (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013; Kumar et al., 2013; Kuo and Liang, 2015; Pillaiyar et al., 2016; Ramajayam et al., 2011; Tong, 2009; Zhao et al., 2013) . After SARS-CoV infection subsided, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), has emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread worldwide, killing 36% of the reported 1826 patients (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/mers-cov/ en/). Due to the similar maturation pathway, MERS-CoV 3CL pro is also regarded as a target for developing antiviral drugs . Though tremendous efforts have been made to develop inhibitors, therapeutic interventions for such continuous CoV outbreaks are yet to reach market (Barnard and Kumaki, 2011; Kilianski and Baker, 2014) .\n\nThese CoVs' 3CL pro are functionally similar to the 3C pro in picornaviruses and both adopt chymotrypsin fold . However, 3CL pro is a dimer with Cys-His dyad, whereas 3C pro is a monomer with Cys-His-Glu triad (Hsu et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2003) . Picornaviruses are small, nonenveloped RNA virus with genome size of 7500e8000 nucleotides. Based on their genetic organization, the family is composed of 31 genera including Enterovirus (enterovirus and rhinovirus), Aphthovirus (foot-and-mouth disease virus), Cardiovirus (encephalomyocarditis virus), Hepatovirus (hepatitis A virus) and others (http://www.picornaviridae.com/). As 3C pro is produced in all genera of Picornaviridae virus family, its inhibitors showed broadspectrum, potent antiviral activity against rhinovirus, coxsackievirus and enterovirus (Jetsadawisut et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2015; St John et al., 2015) . Though 3C pro and 3CL pro share similar structures at their active sites, subtle differences often discriminate inhibitors. AG7088, an established 3C pro inhibitor, was inactive against SARS-CoV 3CL pro prior to the modifications (Ghosh et al., 2005; Shie et al., 2005; Thanigaimalai et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2006) . Unlike AG7088 which contains a, b-unsaturated ester for forming covalent bond with the active-site Cys, our previously reported potent peptidomimetic inhibitors of 3C pro from enterovirus 71 (EV71) contains aldehyde as electrophilic warhead (Kuo et al., 2008) . In this work, we screened those EV71 3C pro inhibitors against MERS-CoV 3CL pro and further evaluated the hits by cellbased assays using live MERS-CoV. Our best compounds 6b, 6c and 6d inhibited MERS-CoV 3CL pro with IC 50 values ranging from 1.7 to 4.7 mM and also suppressed viral replication with EC 50 values between 0.6 and 1.4 mM. These derivatives represent some of few cell-based assay-confirmed anti-MERS-CoV agents and also showed broad-spectrum activity against both aand b-types of CoVs as described herein.\n\nCompounds reported here were synthesized using previously reported procedures with some modifications (Kuo et al., 2008) . Test compounds and gemcitabine hydrochloride (GEM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) at 50 mM concentration. Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL) at 37 C and 5% CO 2 . To minimize adaptive mutation probability of MERS-CoV to another species during passage, MERS-CoV was amplified by infection of a human cell line, Huh-7 cells. The infectious viral titers from culture supernatants at day 2 post-infection (p.i.) were measured by a plaque assay using Vero cells according to other reports (Chan et al., 2013; de Wilde et al., 2013 \n\nThe expression and purification of SARS-CoV 3CL pro followed our reported procedure (Kuo et al., 2004) . For expression of MERS-CoV 3CL pro (Kumar et al., 2016) , the Factor Xa cleavage site (IEGR) and the 3CL pro (accession KJ361502.1, Ser3248eGln3553) DNA sequence was synthesized and cloned into the pET32 expression vector by Mission Biotech. Company (Taiwan) and was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). A 10 ml overnight culture of a single transformant was used to inoculate 1L of fresh LB medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown at 37 C to A 600 \u00bc 0.8 and induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-b-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 22 h at 16 C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7000 \u00c2 g for 15 min and the pellet was suspended in lysis buffer (12 mM Tris-HCl, 120 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT, pH 7.5). A French-press instrument (Constant Cell Disruption System) was used to disrupt the cells at 20,000 psi and centrifuged at 20,000 \u00c2 g for 1 h to discard the debris. The cell-free extract was loaded onto Ni-NTA column which was equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 5 mM imidazole. After exhaustive washing with lysis buffer, the imidazole concentration of the washing buffer was increased to 30 mM. The protein eluted by lysis buffer containing 300 mM imidazole was dialyzed against lysis buffer to remove imidazole and then Factor Xa was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/w) and incubated at 16 C for 24 h to remove the His-tag. Subsequently, the processed MERS-CoV 3CL pro was passed through a Ni-NTA column for purification. The protein concentration was determined by the protein assay kit (BioRad, USA) and BSA was used as standard.\n\nA fluorometric assay by using the fluorogenic peptide, Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans as previously described (Kuo et al., 2004) was used to determine the inhibition constants of compounds. The enhanced fluorescence due to the cleavage of this substrate catalyzed by the 3CL pro was monitored at 538 nm with excitation at 355 nm. The IC 50 value of individual sample was measured in a reaction mixture containing 50 nM SARS-CoV 3CL pro or 0.3 mM MERS-CoV 3CL pro and 10 mM of the fluorogenic substrate in 20 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0).\n\nHuh-7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2 \u00c2 10 4 cells per well). On the next day, cells were infected with MERS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in DMEM without FBS for 1 h. After washing with PBS, mock-infected or virus-infected cells were treated with 3-fold serial dilutions of test compounds or GEM used as a positive control. At day 2 p.i., cell lysate was harvested for measuring cell viability using the CellTiter 96 \u00ae AQ ueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) and 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Antiviral assay for other CoVs, including 229E, OC43 and FIPV strains, were performed as mentioned above by using different cell lines. MRC-5 cells were used for culturing human CoVs, 229E and OC43, while CRFK cells for feline CoV, FIPV.\n\nHuh-7 cells seeded in 6-well plates (3 \u00c2 10 5 cells per well) were infected with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 0.02 for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were treated with 0.1, 1 and 10 mM of compounds 6b, 6c and 6d. In parallel, 0.02% DMSO was treated as a compound vehicle. On day 1 p.i., 30 mg cell lysates suspended in sample loading buffer (Biosesang, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). MERS-CoV NP was detected using a primary antibody specific for viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) (Cat. 100211-RP02; Sino Biological Inc., Beijing, China), followed by a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat antirabbit secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). The cellular b-actin protein, a loading control, was detected with an anti-b-actin-specific primary antibody (Cat. No. A1987; Sigma-Aldrich) and the HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific). After addition of a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate; Pierce, Rockford, IL), images were obtained using a LAS-4000 Luminescent Image Analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nHuh-7 cells were inoculated in 6-well plates at a density of 1 \u00c2 10 6 cells per well for 1 day. Culture supernatants treated with 1 mM compounds were harvested at day 1 p.i. They were serially diluted 10-fold in DMEM from 10 \u00c01 to 10 \u00c03 and 1 ml of each sample was used to infect Vero cells for 1 h. After washing with PBS to remove unabsorbed virus, DMEM containing 0.5% agarose (overlay medium) was added. On day 3 p.i., plaques were visualized with 50 mg/ml neutral red (Sigma-Aldrich).\n\n3.1. Inhibition of MERS-CoV 3CL pro and viral infection by 6b, 6c and 6d\n\nPeptidomimetic compounds were synthesized according to our reported method (Kuo et al., 2008) . Preliminary screening of these peptidomimetic compounds against MERS 3CL pro were done at 50 mM. Compounds inhibiting more than half of the protease activity under such condition were selected for further IC 50 measurements. Using enzymatic assay, the compounds 6b, 6c and 6d showed IC 50 of 2.4, 4.7 and 1.7 mM against purified 3CL pro of MERS-CoV, respectively (Table 1) . These compounds also inhibited SARS 3CL pro at lower IC 50 values of 0.7, 0.5 and 0.2 mM, respectively.\n\nTo evaluate the ability of these compounds to block viral replication, we performed cytopathic inhibition assay using MERS-CoVinfected Huh-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, compounds 6b, 6c and 6d efficiently suppressed viral replication with EC 50 of 1.4, 1.2 and 0.6 mM, respectively (Table 1) . Though it is usual to see EC 50 higher than IC 50 , due to the presence of membrane barrier, we observed EC 50 to be smaller than IC 50 . This could be due to the higher concentration (300 nM) used for in-vitro enzymatic assay because it is a weakly associated dimer . In fact, they inhibited 50 nM SARS 3CL pro , a tight dimer, in the submicromolar range (Table 1) . These compounds had CC 50 larger than 100 mM for 6b and 6c or 58.6 mM for 6d against uninfected cells, resulting in selectivity index (S.I.) values larger than 71.4. As expected, compound 6a which was inactive in the enzyme assay did not suppress viral replication. GEM, used as a positive control according to a previous report (Dyall et al., 2014) , was less potent in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection with an EC 50 value of 8.3 mM. It also showed marginal toxicity and thus decreased viability of mock cells by 20% or more at the concentrations above 3.7 mM (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ).\n\nTo confirm that the observed antiviral activity of compounds 6b, 6c and 6d reflects inhibition of MERS-CoV infection, both viral protein and progeny production was measured after treatment of virus-infected cells with these compounds. Western blot analysis showed that viral NP was decreased by these inhibitors in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 2) . It is noteworthy that no viral NP detectable in the presence of 10 mM 3CL pro inhibitors.\n\nWe further compared the number of infectious MERS-CoV particles in the culture supernatants, both in the presence and absence of 3CL pro inhibitors. The plaque assay showed that the viral titer in the absence of compound was 4.4 \u00c2 10 5 plaque forming units (pfu)/ ml, but reduced to 1.7 \u00c2 10 4 , 2.9 \u00c2 10 4 , and 1.2 \u00c2 10 4 pfu/ml by 1 mM of compounds 6b, 6c and 6d, respectively (Fig. 3) . Taken together, the results suggest that the compounds originally selected as EV71 3C pro blockers efficiently inhibited MERS-CoV 3CL pro activity and suppressed viral protein production as well as viral progeny generation. The data also indicate that the inhibitors can penetrate virus-infected cell membrane to reach the active site of 3CL pro .\n\nTo rationalize potent inhibition, we docked 6d into the active site of MERS-CoV 3CL pro . The initial pose of the complex was generated based on the X-ray structure (PDB code: 4RSP) of the 3CL pro in complex with a covalent inhibitor and those of the human rhinovirus 3C pro bound with irreversible inhibitors (Matthews et al., 1999; Webber et al., 1998) . Then, the simulation was done by Discovery Studio (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). A Cys at subsite S1 of 3CL pro acts as a nucleophile to cleave substrates by attacking carbonyl carbon of the amide bond between the conserved Gln at P1 and the small amino acids such as Ser, Ala or Gly at P1' (Fan et al., 2004; Needle et al., 2015) . Our modelling shows that the g-sulfur of Cys148 forms a covalent bond with the 6d aldehyde carbon and the resulting oxyanion is stabilized by His41 (Fig. 4) . A cyclic lactam moiety with cis-amide geometry on Fig. 1 . Antiviral activity of 6b, 6c and 6d against MERS-CoV in Huh-7 cells. Huh-7 cells in 96-well plates were mock-infected or infected with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 0.1 for 1 h at 37 C. After washing with PBS, cells were treated with 3-fold serial dilutions of test compounds (6a, 6b, 6c and 6d) or a control compound (GEM). On day 2 p.i., cell lysates were harvested for measuring cell viability. The data represent the means \u00b1 standard deviations from three independent experiments. Fig. 2 . Inhibition of MERS-CoV NP production by 6b, 6c and 6d in a dosedependent manner. Huh-7 cells in 6-well plates were infected with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 0.02 for 1 h at 37 C.The virus-infected cells were treated with increasing concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 mM) of each compound. Co-treatment of interferon-alpha 2A (IFN; 50 ng/ml) and ribavirin (RBV; 100 mM) was used as a positive control. On day 1 p.i., cells were harvested and loaded to 10% SDS-PAGE (30 mg per well). Immunoblotting was performed using rabbit anti-NP antibody and HRP-conjugated goat antirabbit secondary antibody. b-Actin was used as a loading control. binding to 3C pro was proposed to mimic the P1 Gln of peptide substrates (Matthews et al., 1999) . Based on our docking results, the P1 lactam moiety of 6d binds to S1 subsite of 3CL pro by forming Hbonds with His166 and Glu169. The P2 phenylalanine moiety prefers to occupy S2 subsite. The cinnamoyl group of 6d occupies S3 and may be extended to S4. The amide group between phenylalanine and cinnamoyl group further forms H-bonds with Gln192 and Glu169. We also docked 6d based on the apo-form MERS-CoV 3CL pro structure (PDB code: 5c3n) (Ho et al., 2015) . Since the free-form and ligand-bound structures showed no significant difference in the active site, the binding modes of 6d in these two structures are indeed very similar (data not shown).\n\nFrom our experimental as well as modelling results, substituents on cinnamoyl groups of these peptidomimetic inhibitors seem to be critical for the activity. Substituent p-chloro in 6d makes halogen bonding with His194, leading to better potency. Compound 6b and 6c with slightly bulkier m-bromo and p-dimethylamino moiety, respectively, displayed approximately 2-fold drop in IC 50 . Compound 6a with the bulkiest 3,4-methylenedioxy substituent failed to inhibit the 3CL pro even at 25 mM. Compounds 4a and 5a that lacked aldehyde warhead failed to inhibit 3CL pro , emphasizing the importance of reactive aldehyde electrophile.\n\nTo investigate for broad spectrum activity, three compounds were tested against human and feline CoVs. The result showed both a-CoVs, human 229E strain and FIPV, and b-CoV (human OC43 strain) were sensitive to the compounds with EC 50 of 1.1e17.7 mM (Table 2) , suggesting potent and broad-spectrum antiviral activities of these 3CL pro inhibitors. The CC 50 values measured using MRC-5 and CRFK cells, used to cultivate human and feline CoVs, respectively, were found to be more than 100 mM. Therefore, the S.I. values were ranged above 5.7 as shown in parentheses.\n\nPeptide and peptidomimetic aldehyde inhibitors against 3CL pro have been reported (Akaji et al., 2008 (Akaji et al., , 2011 Zhu et al., 2011) but not tested on live CoVs. However, a potent SARS-CoV 3CL pro peptidomimetic aldehyde inhibitor, TG-0205221, has been shown to block SARS-CoV and human CoV 229E replications (Yang et al., 2006) . As shown in this study, we have identified potent and membranepermeable MERS-CoV inhibitors 6b, 6c and 6d using live MERS-CoV virus with EC 50 of 0.6e1.2 mM and S.I. over 71.4. These compounds with IC 50 < 0.5 mM against 3C pro (Kuo et al., 2008) inhibited 3CL pro of MERS-CoV with IC 50 of 1.7e4.7 mM and SARS-CoV with IC 50 of 0.2e0.7 mM. Moreover, we found these inhibitors were active against other viruses, including aand b-CoVs with EC 50 of 1.1e17.7 mM, but were less potent (higher EC 50 ) in killing human b-CoV OC43. Although not as potent as inhibiting picornavirus EV71 with the EC 50 of 18 and 7 nM for 6c and 6d, respectively (Kuo et al., 2008) , they are the most potent inhibitors of live MERS-CoV identified so far. Their inhibitory activities against picornaviruses and CoVs make these compounds broad-spectrum antiviral agents. With the escalating cost of drug discovery, development of an antiviral agent with broad-spectrum activities might help in overcoming financial hurdles. More compounds are being synthesized for lead optimization. Animal study needs to be further conducted for developing one of these potent inhibitors into an antiviral drug. 6c and 6d. MERS-CoV-infected Huh-7 cells in 6-well plates were treated with 1 mM 6b, 6c and 6d for 1 day. Culture supernatants were harvested and serially diluted by 10fold in DMEM (10 \u00c01 to 10 \u00c03 ). Fresh Vero cells in 6-well plates were infected with the diluted cell culture inoculum for 1 h. And the number of infectious viral particles was counted by addition of the overlay medium for 3 days and by neutral red staining. Fig. 4 . Docking of inhibitor 6d with MERS-CoV 3CL pro . Cys148 of the protease makes a covalent bond with the carbonyl carbon of the inhibitor aldehyde, forming a stable tetrahedral species (the inset), and the resulting oxyanion being stabilized by His 41. The protease is shown in a charge-potential surface. The putative substrate-binding subsites S1 0 , S1, S2, S3 and S4 are indicated. Moreover, the possible hydrogen bonds of 6d to the protease are further drawn with dashed lines. "}
