{"title": "", "body": "III. PULMONARY MEDICINE 1. Define severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\n\nSevere community-acquired pneumonia refers to CAP that requires management in the intensive care unit (ICU). The mortality rate for patients with severe CAP is high, and the empiric antimicrobial regimen for this subgroup differs from antibiotic coverage recommended for less severe cases of pneumonia. Ultimately, the decision to admit a patient to the ICU must be based on clinical judgment; however, various indices have been validated to predict the need for ICU admission and can supplement clinical decision-making. The modified American Thoracic Society (ATS) rules define severe CAP by the presence of either one of two major criteria (septic shock or need for mechanical ventilation) or two of three minor criteria (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 90 mmHg, multilobar pneumonia, and PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 250). The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend that patients with two or more of the following be considered for ICU admission: altered mental status, blood urea nitrogen > 19.1 mg/dL, respiratory rate 30 breaths/min, and either DBP 60 mmHg or SBP < 90 mmHg (CURB \u00bc confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure).\n\n2. Which pathogens most commonly cause severe CAP? Table 17 -1 lists the most common culprits. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequently identified causative organism. Pathogens are identified in fewer than 50% of cases. Culturing the blood or pleural fluid in addition to respiratory tract specimens may increase the diagnostic yield. Furthermore, Legionella pneumophila can often result in severe illness; therefore, urinary antigen for L. pneumophila serogroup 1 should be measured. Whether or not a specific organism is identified does not appear to affect mortality; however, microbiologic data can be used to tailor therapy.\n\n3. Is the sputum Gram's stain and culture helpful diagnostically for CAP? Sputum Gram's stain and culture can be performed noninvasively and are inexpensive diagnostic tests. A sputum Gram's stain specimen is considered satisfactory for interpretation when the neutrophil count is >25 per low-power field and <10 epithelial cells. There is some controversy regarding how the results of a sputum Gram's stain should influence clinical practice. The ATS recommends that this test be used to broaden antibiotic therapy to treat unsuspected organisms not covered by the usual empiric regimen. Conversely, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines suggest that empiric antimicrobial therapy be narrowed based on sputum Gram's stain findings. Keep in mind the diagnostic limitations of sputum Gram's stain and culture, including the inability to visualize atypical organisms, contamination by oral flora, and the difficulty encountered by some patients to provide adequate specimens.\n\n4. What determines the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy for patients with severe CAP?\n\nThe initial empiric antibiotic regimen depends on the presence of risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These include malnutrition, underlying structural pulmonary disease such as bronchiectasis, >7 days of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within the past month, leukopenic\n\nRachel H. Dotson, MD, and Jeanine Wiener-Kronish, MD immunosuppression, and steroid use (>10 mg prednisone per day). Recommended antibiotics according to the most recent ATS guidelines are listed in Table 17 -1. The current IDSA guidelines also note that exposure to an antibiotic within the preceding 3 months predicts resistance to that antibiotic class. Prompt administration (within 4 hours of presentation) of appropriate empiric antibiotics is strongly encouraged because studies suggest that delays in treatment are associated with worse outcomes.\n\n5. Who is at risk for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae pneumonia, and does this affect treatment? Risk factors for infection due to penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae include age older than 65 years, recent beta-lactam therapy, multiple comorbidities, alcoholism, immunosuppression, noninvasive disease, and contact with a child who attends day care. Several investigations indicate that penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae pneumonia (in the absence of meningitis) can be successfully treated with beta-lactam antibiotics without adversely affecting mortality unless the minimal inhibitory concentration is 4 mg/L. S. pneumoniae resistance against macrolides and fluoroquinolones is increasing. Clinical failures with macrolides are rare despite macrolide resistance; however, fluoroquinolones with less potency against S. pneumoniae are likely to be ineffective against resistant strains. 2. Select the initial empiric therapy based on the current bacteriology and resistance patterns at each institution. Alternatively, published evidence-based practice guidelines may be used.\n\n3. Obtain cultures of respiratory tract specimens to identify pathogen(s), preferably before the initiation of antibiotics. However, the administration of antibiotic therapy should not be delayed for diagnostic testing.\n\n4. Narrow the initial antibiotic regimen based on quantitative culture results and clinical response (i.e., de-escalation).\n\n5. Avoid excessive antibiotic use by de-escalating therapy when appropriate and prescribing the minimal duration of therapy required for efficacy.\n\n6. What is meant by ''de-escalation'' of antibiotic therapy? Antibiotic use promotes the development of antibiotic resistance; therefore, restricted use of antimicrobial drugs should be encouraged. If the patient is responding favorably, the initial empiric antibiotic regimen should be de-escalated, or narrowed to the most specific antibiotic based on the results of respiratory tract cultures and sensitivities.\n\n7. When is it safe to switch a patient to oral therapy? Conversion to oral therapy may be considered in a clinically stable patient who demonstrates the following: improvement in cough and shortness of breath, defervescence (<100 F) on two In roughly one-third to one-half of the cases no etilogy was identified.\n\nIn no particular order.\n\n} Antipseudomonal agents such as cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, and meropenem are generally active against DRSP and other likely pathogens in this population, but not recommended for routine use unless the patient has risk factors for P. aeruginosa. separate measurements 8 hours apart, white blood cell count trending toward normal, and satisfactory oral intake and gastrointestinal tract absorption.\n\nThe majority of patients receiving appropriate therapy show a favorable clinical response within 72 hours. Therefore, initial antibiotic therapy should not be changed within 72 hours of initiation unless indicated by significant clinical worsening or microbiologic data. Remember that certain host factors, such as advanced age, alcoholism, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), have been associated with delayed resolution despite appropriate treatment. Radiographic resolution of pneumonia lags behind clinical improvement and in some cases may take up to 8-10 weeks to clear completely.\n\n9. Discuss the potential reasons why a patient may not respond favorably to empiric therapy. Clinical deterioration or a lack of response to empiric antimicrobial therapy within 3 days often indicates treatment failure, warranting thorough reassessment and additional investigation. The following should be considered: 14. What is health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP)?\n\nThe term HCAP refers to pneumonia that develops in a patient who lives in a nursing home or long-term care facility; undergoes hemodialysis; has received IV antimicrobial therapy, chemotherapy, or wound care within the preceding 30 days; or has been hospitalized for at least 2 days within the preceding 90 days. The causative pathogens in these patients are similar to those responsible for hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and are often multidrug resistant.\n\nThe majority of cases are due to microaspiration of pathogens colonizing the oropharynx. Endotracheal intubation interferes with normal host defenses by impairing the patient's ability to cough and disrupting the protective barrier between the oropharynx and trachea. Bacteria-laden oropharyngeal secretions pool and leak around the cuff of the endotracheal tube and infect the lower respiratory tract. This is facilitated when the patient is supine. It has been hypothesized that the endotracheal tube is colonized with bacteria encased in biofilm and that tube manipulation or suctioning results in embolization of bacteria into the lower respiratory tract.\n\nOther less common sources of bacteria include the paranasal sinuses, dental plaque, gastrointestinal tract, and rarely hematogenous spread from another site of infection. Bronchoscopic methods include bronchoalveolar lavage and protected specimen brush. Nonbronchoscopic methods can be performed in intubated patients by respiratory therapists and include minibronchoalveolar lavage and protected telescoping catheter. Bronchoscopic and nonbronchoscopic methods have similar performance characteristics; however, the diagnostic threshold for each procedure varies. Although nonbronchoscopic procedures are performed blindly and most frequently sample the right lower lobe, studies have shown that VAP is a diffuse process that typically involves every pulmonary lobe, particularly the posterior lower lobes.\n\n20. What are the advantages of quantitative cultures of lower respiratory tract specimens over a clinical approach for the diagnosis of VAP? A microbiologic diagnosis using quantitative cultures of lower respiratory tract specimens not only establishes the presence of lung infection, but also identifies the etiologic organism. Several studies have shown that unless antibiotic therapy was initiated or changed within 72 hours preceding sampling, antibiotics can be safely discontinued when quantitative cultures of lavage specimens are below the diagnostic threshold. Qualitative or semiquantitative cultures of the trachea rarely yield negative results due to tracheal colonization even in the absence of lung infection. A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of over 400 patients meeting clinical criteria for VAP showed that a diagnostic strategy involving bronchoscopic sampling and quantitative cultures resulted in significantly less antibiotic use and decreased 14-day mortality when compared with a clinical diagnostic strategy using qualitative cultures of endotracheal aspirates. \n\nAre there factors that predispose patients to nosocomial lung infection with drug-resistant organisms? Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or VAP that develops within the first 4 hospital days is described as early-onset. A patient is at risk for infection with drug-resistant pathogens when HAP or VAP develops 5 days of hospitalization (i.e., late-onset) or if, within the preceding 3 months, the patient was hospitalized or received antibiotics. Additional risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens are listed in Table 17 -3 and should be considered when prescribing empiric therapy for nosocomial pneumonia.\n\n22. What determines the selection of the initial empiric antibiotic therapy for HAP, HCAP, and VAP? Investigations have shown that early, appropriate (meaning, effective against the etiologic pathogen) antimicrobial therapy for VAP improves outcomes. The ATS guidelines recommend empiric therapy. The initial selection of antibiotics depends on whether the patient has risk factors for drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens and whether the pneumonia is classified as early-or late-onset. Individual institutions differ in patterns of antimicrobial resistance; therefore, many hospitals have antibiotic guidelines or antibiograms for empiric therapy based on likely pathogens and local antimicrobial resistance patterns. If the patient has received antibiotics recently, empiric therapy should include antimicrobials from a different class than the patient received (Tables 17-4 and 17-5).\n\n23. What is the duration of antimicrobial therapy for HAP, HCAP, and VAP? In a prospective, randomized clinical trial, an 8-day treatment strategy for culture-proven VAP resulted in a significant decrease in multidrug-resistant bacteria and more antibiotic-free days with no differences in mortality, ICU length of stay, or mechanical ventilator-free days compared with a 15-day regimen. A higher rate of recurrence was documented with the 8-day regimen when the infection was due to Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas species; therefore, VAP due to these organisms should be treated for 15 days. Because the infecting pathogens are similar, HAP and HCAP can be treated similarly. Extended therapy (14-21 days) may be indicated in the setting of multilobar disease, cavitation, malnutrition, or necrotizing gram-negative infection. \n\nCombination Antibiotic Therapy *"}
