{"title": "Th e Role of Viral Infection in Pulmonary Exacerbations of Bronchiectasis in Adults A Prospective Study", "body": "Patients with bronchiectasis frequently develop acute infective exacerbations characterized by increased cough frequency and sputum volume and purulence that readily lead to hospital admissions with high treatment costs. 1, 2 More importantly, frequent exacerbations impose adverse effects on quality of life (QoL) 3 and might accelerate loss of lung function and increase mortality. 4, 5 To date, however, triggers of bronchiectasis exacerbations (BEs) have been poorly elucidated. Because antibiotic treatment of BEs has been shown to mitigate clinical symptoms, restore lung function, and concurrently suppress systemic and airway inflammatory responses, 6, 7 BEs have been postulated to result from airways bacterial infections of novel strains, increased bacterial density, or both. 8 However, Tunney et al 9 showed that total bacterial density and microbiota taxa, analyzed by culture and 16s ribosomal DNA pyrosequencing, did not change remarkably during antibiotic treatment of BEs, suggesting that changes in lung microbiota composition might not account signifi cantly for BEs. This has led us to examine the roles of other poten tial pathogens, especially viruses, in adults with bronchiectasis.\n\nIt has been well established that respiratory viral infections are a major trigger of acute exacerbations of COPD, 10, 11 asthma 12, 13 and cystic fi brosis. 14, 15 A recent study in children with bronchiectasis found that respiratory viruses were detected in 48% of 77 pediatric pulmonologistdefi ned BEs and were associated with worse clinical outcomes. 16 However, signifi cance of viral infection in adults with BEs remains unknown. In addition, clinical characteristics and investigations regarding virus-associated BEs in adults are also lacking, and the interactions between respiratory viruses, bacteria, and host immune response, which might directly relate to pathogenesis of bronchiectasis, as shown in COPD, 17 deserve special attention from researchers and clinicians. Meanwhile, biomarkers such as serum interferon-g -induced protein 10 (IP-10) have been proposed as surrogate markers for predicting virus-associated exacerbations of COPD, 18 but the utility in bronchiectasis has never been assessed. In this prospective study, we sought to (1) document the incidence of 16 common respiratory viruses in adults with bronchiectasis during steady-state bronchiectasis and BEs, (2) investigate the clinical diff erences between virus-positive and virus-negative BEs, and (3) assess the utility of serum IP-10 for predicting virus-related BEs.\n\nPatients with bronchiectasis, diagnosed by compatible history combined with bronchial dilatation on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan, were recruited from outpatient clinics of Th e First Affi liated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University and a previous cohort assessing the eff ects of anxiety and depression on BEs 19 Within the span of 12 months, patients were assessed at baseline, when clinically stable, and at BEs. During follow-up, patients were required to attend chest clinics routinely every 3 months. Between the neighboring scheduled visits, patients experiencing symptoms of exacerbations were requested to contact investigators immediately, with an additional visit being scheduled within 48 h. BEs were defi ned as persistent ( . 24 h) deterioration in at least three respiratory symptoms, including cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, increased sputum purulence or volume, chest pain, febrile, radiographic deterioration, systemic disturbances, or changes in chest auscultation. 20 Spontaneous or induced sputum was collected at each visit for bacterial culture, viral assays, and measurement of airway infl ammation. Paired serum samples were collected for assessment of systemic infl ammation. All parameters were measured when clinically stable and at times of BE.\n\nA comprehensive history including age, sex, BMI, infl uenza vaccination in the preceding year, the number of infective exacerbations and hospitalizations in the previous 24 months, and current treatment were recorded at baseline. Chest HRCT scan within 12 months was used for radiologic scoring based on the number of bronchiectatic lobes (with the lingula being scored as a separate lobe) and severity of bronchial dilatation (tubular: 1 point, varicose: 2 points, cystic: 3 points), with the maximal score of 18. 21 Etiology of bronchiectasis was determined after meticulous testing recommended by British Thoracic Society guidelines 2 and group discussion (Yong-hua Gao, W. G., and G. X.). Upper and lower airway symptoms were recorded when clinically stable and at BEs. Bronchiectasis severity at baseline was quantifi ed according to Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI). 4 QoL was assessed using St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) for all patients when clinically stable and those with the fi rst BEs who had one or more exacerbations. 6, 22 \n\nMethods for assessing sputum bacterial density for Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Haemophilus infl uenza , and other potentially pathogenic microorganisms have been introduced previously. 23 Details are provided in e-Appendix 1 . Details of lung function measurement are given in e-Appendix 1.\n\nLevels of IL-1 b , IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a in sputum, and IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a , and IP-10 in serum were measured using commercial multiplex bead-based assay kits (Bio-Plex Cytokines Assay; Bio-Rad Inc) (14) . C-reactive protein (CRP) level and WBC counts were also measured as systemic inflammatory markers. Details are given in e-Appendix 1 .\n\nNasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and sputum were sampled for virology analysis. Sixteen common respiratory tract pathogens were tested using TaqMan reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as previously reported, 24 including rhinovirus, infl uenza viruses A and B, parainfl uenza viruses (1, 2, 3, and 4), human coronovirus (HCoV) (HCoV-229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1), respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus. Specimens with cycle threshold \u0545 35 were deemed positive, according to manufacturer's specifications (Guangzhou HuYanSuo Medical Technology Co, Ltd). Lower cycle threshold values indicated that fewer cycles of PCR amplifi cations were needed to detect viral nucleic acids and, hence, refl ected a higher magnitude of PCR positivity. Details of virus detection are provided in e-Appendix 1 .\n\nBecause studies investigating the roles of viral infections in bronchiectasis are lacking, by assuming that the detection rate of viruses in NPS and sputum in steady-state bronchiectasis was 19%, imputed from COPD, 11 100 participants in the baseline subgroup and exacerbation subgroup during follow-up were required to detect a 20% diff erence in the proportion of viral infection with a two-sided signifi cance level of P 5 .05 and power of 90%. Therefore, we planned to include 120 patients (assuming a dropout rate of 20% to capture suffi cient exacerbation events during 1-year follow up). Data were presented as mean (SD), median (interquartile range [IQR]), or counts (proportion), as appropriate. Bacterial density (colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) was logarithmically transformed before analyses. Categorical variables were compared using x 2 tests. For continuous variables, two-group comparisons were performed using unpaired t tests or Mann-Whitney tests when appropriate; one-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test were applied for multiple-group comparisons as appropriate. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between independent variables and presence of viruses. Th e utility of IP-10 in predicting viral infection during BEs was investigated using receiver operating characteristics curve. Results were presented as area under the curve and 95% CI. A P value , .05 was considered statistically signifi cant for all analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 (IBM) and Graphpad Prism, version 5.0 (GraphPad Soft ware Inc).\n\nOf 119 patients recruited ( Fig 1 ) , 58 with at least one reported BE during 1-year follow-up were included in the final analyses. These 58 patients experienced 127 BEs, with 100 reported BEs over 12-month follow-up. During the study period, 26 patients reported no BEs and 35 experienced BEs but failed to report them and, therefore, were not sampled. Th ese 35 patients had a total of 77 unreported exacerbations. Th us, 119 patients had a total of 204 exacerbations (mean, 1.7 exacerbations per patient per year) during the whole study period. Th e characteristics and underlying causes of bronchiectasis of 58 included patients did not diff er from those of the 61 patients who dropped out ( Table 1 , e- Table 1 ). Of the 58 patients, 24 (41.4%) had Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization at baseline. Of these, only one received infl uenza vaccination in autumn before the study, and 34 patients (58.6%) had idiopathic/postinfective bronchiectasis in the baseline cohort. Baseline characteristics using diff erent BSI scores are presented in the online supplement ( e- Table 2 ).\n\nMedian time to sampling was 3 d (IQR, 2-5 d), which was unrelated to virus detection ( P 5 .79). Respiratory viruses were detected in NPS or sputum in 49 of 100 reported BEs (49.0%) and 11 of 58 patients with bronchiectasis (18.9%) at baseline who then experienced exacerbations ( P , .001) ( Fig 2 ) . None of the adults who were virus-positive at baseline had identical virus detected during subsequent exacerbations. Th irty (51.7%) were positive for a respiratory virus at the first BEs. Of the 24 patients with two or more reported BEs, only four had identical virus at two different BEs. In the 49 BE events, 65 viruses were detected, including 13 episodes of multiple viruses ( e- Table 3 ). Th ree of 58 patients who reported exacerbations had multiple viruses isolated at steady-state bronchiectasis (one each of infl uenza with rhinovirus, infl uenza with HCoV-OC43, and infl uenza with HCoV-229E). Th e distribution of viruses detected is shown in Table 2 according to study group and type of specimens analyzed. Th e most common viruses were coronavirus, rhinovirus, and infl uenza A and B. Th e detected viruses in BEs according to bronchiectasis severity, assessed by BSI, are summarized in e- Table 4 . Patients with moderate to severe bronchiectasis (BSI \u0546 5) had higher positivity of viral infection than those with mild bronchiectasis (BSI 5 0-4; 56.0% vs 28.0%, respectively; P 5 .015).\n\nComplete sets of virology samples (NPS and sputum) were collected at 100 episodes of BE without missing samples. Of these, 45 viruses could be detected in 39 (39.0%) compared with fi ve viruses in fi ve of 58 patients \n\nTh e odds of virus-positive BEs being associated with individual symptoms are summarized in e- Table 5 .\n\nBlocked nose and hoarseness were more common at virus-positive BEs. QoL was measured in 58 patients with the fi rst BEs. Of these, 30 were in the virus-positive group and 28 in the virus-negative group. Changes in SGRQ, LCQ, and CAT total scores between BEs and steady-state bronchiectasis in patients in the virus-positive group were more signifi cant (albeit not statistically signifi cant) than those in patients in the virus-negative group ( Table 3 ). ( Fig 3 ) . Th e positive and negative predictive values were 0.60 and 0.64, respectively.\n\nTo our knowledge, this was the fi rst large-scale, prospective study to determine the incidence and clinical impact of viral infection, by using PCR-based methods, on BEs in adults. We found that the following: (1) BEs were signifi cantly associated with the presence of viruses in NPS and sputum, with coronavirus, rhinovirus, and infl uenza virus being most common; (2) virus-positive BEs were associated with signifi cant increase in systemic and airway infl ammatory markers, and prone to require IV antibiotic therapy compared with virus-negative BEs.\n\n(3) Viral infection at BEs did not have signifi cant eff ects on QoL (albeit greater deterioration in viruspositive BEs), lung function, and bacterial density; and (4) serum IP-10 levels had limited signifi cance for predicting viral infection at BEs.\n\nWe detected respiratory viruses signifi cantly more oft en in BEs (49.0%) than in steady-state bronchiectasis (18.9%). Th e overall incidence of viral infection in BEs was consistent with previous studies regarding pediatric bronchiectasis, COPD, and cystic fi brosis. 11 15 Th erefore, the rate of viral carriage in stable chronic airway disease, including bronchiectasis, might not be signifi cantly diff erent from that in the healthy adult population.\n\nAn intriguing fi nding was the detection rate of respiratory viruses during BEs was higher in those with moderate to severe bronchiectasis (ie, BSI \u0546 5) ( e-Appendix 1 ). Th e underlying interpretations remain entirely unclear but could be the following: (1) Participants with moderate or severe bronchiectasis were prone to virus-induced BEs, due to impaired innate interferon production following viral infection, as evidenced in patients with asthma 26-28 ;\n\n(2) participants with moderate or severe bronchiectasis were more likely to harbor bacterial colonization, which might increase the susceptibility to virus by up-regulation of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 29, 30 ; and (3) the relatively small number of BEs might have biased our estimations of the underlying relationship between viral infection and bronchiectasis severity.\n\nWe have shown that viral infection at BEs did not impact signifi cantly on the QoL, which might be explained by the fact that systemic and lower airway symptoms were not signifi cantly diff erent between virus-positive and virus-negative BEs, or that the discriminative ability of the aforementioned, unspecifi c questionnaires was limited. Additionally, viral infections during BEs were not associated with marked changes in FEV 1 from baseline, implying that FEV 1 was not a sensitive marker of BEs. 8 Disease-specifi c questionnaires and more sensitive indicators of spirometry, such as the lung clearance index, merit further investigations to determine whether viral infection at BEs is associated with worse QoL and greater reduction in lung function. 31,32 Serum IP-10 has been a promising indicator of virusassociated exacerbation in COPD. 18, 33 Although serum IP-10 was increased in virus-positive BEs, we found that the diagnostic accuracy was poor for predicting viral infection at BEs. Given the low positive and negative predictive values, our fi ndings suggested that serum IP-10 was not an ideal surrogate of laboratory-confi rmed viral infection at BEs in clinical practice and further researches. Novel biomarkers for identifying virus-associated BEs are urgently needed to guide future antiviral therapy, for antiviral agents are becoming increasingly available. 34 Th e potential clinical implications of our study are as follows: (1) Determination of the contributions of var-ious respiratory virus types in BEs would off er rationales for antiviral therapy; (2) supplementation of virologic data would better guide appropriate antibiotic use in clinics in the future; (3) provision of evidence for infl uenza vaccination in populations at high risk for bronchiectasis; (4) inspiration for future investigations regarding mechanisms of virus-induced exacerbations, especially defi cient interferon production in bronchiectasis; and (5) extension of our understanding of other pathophysiologic mechanisms relevant to bronchiectasis, not just relying on extrapolating evidence from cystic fi brosis.\n\nTh is study has some inherent limitations. Patients were requested to contact investigators once BEs occurred; therefore, milder BEs that mirrored upper respiratory tract infections might have been underreported. Th e scheduled follow-up investigations to determine eff ects of viral infection on symptom recovery could not be performed because of poor compliance and the lack of validated electronic diary cards. Th is refl ected real-life practice, where patients have been frequently unwilling to record their symptoms using the daily paper diary in China. Because our setting was a single medical center, some of our fi ndings need to be further validated in multicenter studies.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that respiratory viruses are a major trigger of BEs in adults. Further studies determining the mechanisms of virus-induced BEs and how viruses impact lower-airway microbial communities are merited."}
