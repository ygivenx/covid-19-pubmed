{"title": "Community responses during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong: risk 1 perception, information exposure and preventive measures 2 3 Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase", "body": "On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus which 54 caused unknown pneumonia cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China since December 2019 as \"2019-55 nCoV\", which was renamed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as \"SARS-CoV-2\" 56 on 11 February 2020. In parallel, the WHO formally named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as 57 \"COVID-19\", short for Coronavirus Disease 2019. Back in late December 2019, a cluster of 27 58 pneumonia cases associated with SARS-CoV-2 with a common link to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale 59 Market were reported [1] , and the first death case attributable to SARS-CoV-2 occurred on 9 January 60 2020. Soon after the first global incidence was confirmed in Thailand on 12 January 2020, new cases 61 were reported in different countries and were mostly associated with Wuhan travel history or residency. To control this COVID-19 epidemic, much effort has been paid to identifying the etiological agent, 77 epidemiological parameters such as incubation period [4] , disease transmissibility [4, 5] , clinical 78 .

District councilors were invited to share our survey link and promotion 109 messages on their webpages, social media platforms or any channels which they usually use to convey 110 information to their targeted residents, but in general there was no restriction on their dissemination.\n\nIndividuals who were aged 18 or above, understood Chinese and lived (on average) over five days per 112 week in Hong Kong in the last month are eligible to participate. Respondents were compensated with a 113 HKD10 cash coupon if they indicated willingness for receipt. To avoid duplicated responses from the 114 same respondent, the survey could only be taken once from the same electronic device. Respondents were asked about their demographics (including sex, age, living district, education 118 attainment, household income), self-perceived health status, travel history in the past month, occurrence 119 of respiratory symptoms in the past fourteen days and anxiety level using the Hospital, Anxiety and 120 Depression scale -Anxiety (HASD-A) (0-7 = Normal; 8-10 = Borderline abnormal; 11-21 = Abnormal).\n\nAlthough HADS-A is intended for screening clinically significant anxiety symptoms in clinical 122 populations, many studies have showed that it is valid for community populations [12, 13] \n\n128 .

The study sample is comparable to the population in terms of 181 residential district (effect size=0.27). Table 2 Table 3 shows the perceived susceptibility and perceived severity towards COVID-19 among 189 respondents. Most respondents regarded themselves as likely to be infected with likely/likely: 89%), and most considered the symptoms of COVID-19 (if infected) as serious (very 191 serious/serious: 97%). Less than a quarter of the respondents thought that it was likely to have 19 cured (if infected) (15%), and only 18% thought that it was likely to survive through When referencing to existing diseases (Table 4) , almost all respondents (>98%) consider equivalent 194 disease severity between COVID-19 and SARS. This magnitude was similar to other deadly NCDs 195 (85%-94%), but much higher than the annual seasonal influenza (66%).

On the other hand, the two most common information sources were 216 social platforms (94%; 1608/1715) and websites (regardless of official or unofficial) (90%; 1539/1715), 217 but they were rated as reliable or very reliable by only 26% and 16%-23% of the respondents 218 respectively.
