{"title": "Hotel Buildings", "body": "\"Today's hotels may offer a variety of services and activities for their transient and permanent guests. A traveler who is staying at a hotel for a limited period of time is commonly described as a guest. Besides providing for lodging and meals, hotels usually have newsstands, retail shops [such as boutiques], restaurants, cocktail lounges, [coffee bars,] health clubs, concierges, and other quality services [which may include laundry and dry cleaning services and business centers with high-speed Internet connections]. Generally, parking facilities are available [many of which include self-park and valet service]. Some have recreational facilities, such as saunas [spas/hot tubs,] and swimming pools, while others may offer tennis and racquetball courts, gyms, and exercise rooms.\" 4 According to Bell, [Hotels] are unique in that they almost always combine several different occupancies under one roof. In addition to guest rooms or guest suites, which are residential occupancies, hotels usually provide space for assembly occupancies such as ballrooms, meeting rooms, exhibition halls, and restaurants; or mercantile r occupancies such as shopping areas, gift shops, and other retail areas; and offices and commercial establishments, or business rr occupancies.\n\n\u2026Many large hotels also contain industrial-type laundries and dry cleaning facilities, as well as kitchens, which use large broilers, ovens, and deep-fat fryers.\n\nLarger-scale hotel building configurations often have atria two or three stories high and sometimes up to sixty stories high, which are often the focal point of building design. Atrium areas themselves may include several occupancies or mixed functions associated with hotel operations [on lower floors these consist of restaurants and retail establishments ( Some structures also may include parking facilities which may be open, enclosed, above-or below-ground, and often directly beneath or adjacent to the hotel itself. These arrangements may require special types of fire protection, and the building codes may require fire separations. 5 \"limited-service hotels are free-standing properties that do not have on-site restaurants or most other amenities that must be provided by a staff other than the front desk or housekeeping. They usually offer continental breakfasts, vending machines or small packaged items, Internet access, and sometimes unattended game rooms or swimming pools in addition to daily housekeeping services.\" 6 4 ibid. r A mercantile occupancy is \"an occupancy used for the display and sale of merchandise\" (NFPA.

In addition, there may be the disruption of building utilities such as water; electrical power; natural gas; sewer; heating, ventilation, and airconditioning (HVAC); telecommunications; security; and fire life safety systems. Some security threats may involve terrorism.\n\nl Security threats to people and property: bombs, chemical and biological weapons, civil disturbance, fires, hazardous materials, natural disasters, and nuclear attack. l Life safety threats: aircraft collisions; bombs and bomb threats; daredevils, protestors, and suicides; elevator and escalator incidents; fires and fire alarms; hazardous materials, chemical and biological weapons, and nuclear attack; kidnappings and hostage situations; labor disputes, demonstrations, and civil disorder; medical emergencies; natural disasters (earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, heat waves, storms, and floods and landslides); contractible diseases (pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and tuberculosis); power failures; slip-and-falls; stalking and workplace violence; traffic accidents; and water leaks.\n\n\"Providing security in a hotel or motel is the broad task of protecting people-guests, employees, and others-and assets. Crimes involving the theft of assets usually result in greater losses to lodging properties than crimes against persons, but crimes against persons have a greater effect on public relations (and therefore occupancy) and may generate high legal expenses.\" 8 According to Kaminsky According to Callaghan, The lodging industry is somewhat different from other businesses in that customers are present 24 hours per day, seven days a week, in effect living with hotel proprietors. The close proximity of customers, as well sometimes-informal situations in which they find themselves, can lead to problems. These include a myriad of incidents that can be referred to as acquaintance assaults. Examples are two people sharing a room who are fighting with one another, people meeting and getting into an argument in a lounge area, and incidents where one guest reports that he or she was sexually assaulted by another. These crimes often occur without witnesses. 10 \"There is the possibility that an assailant who victimized a guest followed the victim back to the [guest] room after encountering him or her elsewhere. There will be many instances when criminals readily spot out-of-state visitors, either in tourist areas or other locations, and target them at that time.\" 11r Such crimes may lead to attacks in hotel parking garages, as well as in the hotel itself.\n\nAlso, \"crimes of opportunity\" such as confidence tricks rr may occur against guests and patrons in hotel lobbies, restaurants, bars, casinos, and other facilities.\n\n\"While recognizing the need for the protection of the guests, the employees, and the assets of each, management must also recognize that guests and employees may themselves create security problems by stealing property and services from the hotel.\" 12 For example, thefts and check and credit card fraud may occur at the front desk, in bars, restaurants, retail stores, casinos, recreation facilities, and any other hotel facilities that handle money transactions. As Beaudry commented, Incidents involving \"walk-outs\" are common when nonpaying customers enjoy a meal and/or drinks in a hotel and then proceed to leave without offering to 10 \"lodging no complaints\" by Chad Callaghan, CPP, ClSD, vice president of loss prevention for Marriott International (Security Management. Alexandria, VA; June 2001:74). 11 rr A confidence trick \"or confidence game, more often known as a con, scam, swindle, grift, gaffle, bunko, flim flam, stratagem, or scheme, is an attempt to swindle a person or people (known as the 'mark' or sometimes 'griftee') which involves gaining his or her confidence\" (Wikipedia. \ue02chttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Confidence_trick\ue02e; August 4, 2008) . 12 ellis Jr rC, Stipanuk DM. Security and Loss Prevention Management. 2nd ed. lansing, MI: educational Institute, American Hotel and Motel Association; 1999: 5. pay for items consumed.\u2026 Frequently, if the patron is caught leaving, they can be confronted and-if they refuse to pay-be held long enough for security or the public police to arrive. The thief then can be identified for future reference or prosecution. The amount of loss is usually not worth the time required to prosecute, so it is recommended that the name and description of the individual be recorded and distributed to all outlets in the hotel. You may also try alternate means of payment (e.g., having a family member pay, or requesting [a] form of payment like cash). If the person tries to obtain food or drink again, they can be refused until they pay for the previous bill\u2026.\n\nThe security department must face problems ranging from guests using stolen credit cards and cards over their allowable limit to dishonest employees inflating gratuities or even writing in gratuities. The best means of avoiding these and other scams is to develop detailed policies and procedures for authorization of use, and to train employees to follow the procedures. Charging store merchandise [and meals in hotel restaurants and services in recreation facilities] to a guest room, for example, must somehow be verified first [by, say, requesting photo identification and the room key or keycard itself]. Management must then follow up to ensure compliance with the rules, and violators should be dealt with appropriately. 13 In addition, guests may steal items from their room (such as alcohol and food items from in-room containers, bathing towels, bed linen, bathing robes, hair dryers, coffee pots, television sets, clock radios, computer peripherals, artwork, light fixtures, and, as unlikely as it may seem, even furniture), cutlery and china from in-room dining carts (particularly those left in the corridors outside of guest rooms), tableware from hotel dining areas, and various items left unsecured in meeting and banquet rooms, exhibition halls, recreational areas, and other facilities.\n\nIn addition, there may be other security-or crime-related incidents-such as illegal gambling and prostitution-that occur in guest rooms. These crimes involve the guest knowingly inviting the participant to his or her hotel room. In the case of the latter, prostitution, Beaudry noted, Some of the comments frequently heard about prostitution [are] that it is a victimless crime and that society should not care what consenting adults do in privacy. However, prostitution is a problem that, if not controlled, can ruin a hotel's reputation. The word controlled was used intentionally, for prostitution cannot and will not be eliminated. The security objective should be to reduce such activity to an absolute minimum. A hotel's reputation is, without doubt, its single most important asset. No matter how professional the hotel's services may be or how good a value may be offered, no one respectable will stay at your hotel if this type of activity is allowed to take place openly.\n\nIt is not the prostitutes (both males and females) that are in and of themselves a concern, but rather the peripheral activity that frequently accompanies prostitution. Theft of the guest's property, assaults on the guests, and drugs are only a sample of the concerns associated with this crime. It is in the best interest of the hotel operator and guest alike to control prostitution.\n\nThere are a number of simple control methods a hotel can employ. First, guest registration procedures must be established and followed closely. All guests must be required to show valid photo identification such as a driver's license and preferably a credit card when checking in, even if they are paying cash in advance for their stay. The reason for the tight registration process r is that most streetwalkers will not carry identification. The more sophisticated \"call girl\" or \"escort\" type of prostitute will have identification, but he or she also represents less of a threat to the innkeeper.\n\nThe The final two methods of prevention include employee cooperation. The housekeeping department will know if a certain guest room has heavy traffic going to and from it and can alert security. Secondly, hotel managers must maintain a no-tolerance attitude towards prostitution while supporting security in its efforts to deal with the problem. Common meeting places for prostitutes are lobby pay telephones [now less frequent due to the advent of mobile telephones], bars, and easily recognized hotel fixtures such as chairs, plants, and the like. 14 Sometimes, hotel staff may even be involved in the prostitution activities. \"In some cases, employees working in collusion with the front desk or even with security staff members have provided prostitutes to guests.\" 15 If the problem cannot be adequately dealt with, hotel management, in consultation with legal counsel, may want to seek the cooperation of local law enforcement. r Of course, the tight registration process requiring photo identification and a valid credit card is for purposes other than that of prostitution. For example, if the guest is a victim of an accident, a crime, or a medical incident that renders him or her unconscious, dead, or missing, such information will be crucial in contacting next of kin, reporting to law enforcement and medical authorities, and so on. Also, it will assist in investigation of the guest not paying the hotel bill, including guest services, or may provide information if he or she is suspected of committing a crime. rr A guest folio is a \"printout of guest activity while in [a] hotel\" ( The sale and use of illegal drugs by guests can also occur in hotels. According to Beaudry, It is very unlikely that a hotel manager will be able to prevent a guest from using drugs in the privacy of his or her room. If, however, the manager becomes aware of such use, action should be taken. Limited use (e.g., smoking a marijuana cigarette) may best be handled by warning the guest that repeated activity will result in removal from the hotel. However, evidence of a more serious use (such as large parties with cocaine left out in the open) may require assistance from the local police. It is common for drug dealers to use large urban hotels to conduct their drug deals, for the size of the hotel usually will ensure their anonymity. 16 In addition, the potential also exists for a guest room to be set up as a temporary, mobile laboratory manufacturing illicit drugs such as methamphetamine. r A room can even be used for \"surreptitious meetings among dangerous persons such as [gangsters,] terrorists, and drug dealers.\" 17 Of course, due to the openness of hotels, this is difficult to prevent.\n\n\"large hotels host large parties, weddings, reunions, conventions, conferences, [exhibits], seminars, sales meetings, and the like. employees, especially the event planner, regularly face a myriad of crime-and security-related incidents.\" 18 Sometimes, problems arise when large groups that are traditionally antagonistic to each other have events at the hotel at the same time. Often, the excessive use of alcohol or drugs can be the trigger for incidents to occur.\n\n\"Depending on the size and location of a hotel, certain types of public figures are likely to stay as guests on occasion. In larger, convention-class hotels, political figures are often in attendance for social events. Public figures, whether they are politicians or people such as rock stars or sports teams, often will draw crowds. These crowds may be admirers, or they may be demonstrators protesting the appearance of the individual\u2026.\n\n[T]he security manager should be prepared to work with the authorities in planning for the person's arrival, stay, and departure.\" 19 Additional hotel security staff will often be required to handle these occasions. 16 Beaudry MH. Contemporary Lodging Security. Newton, MA: Butterworth-Heinemann; 1996:115. r According to ruda Maxa for Marketplace, \"If you happen to get a whiff of ammonia in the hallway of a long-term-stay hotel, you might want to pick up the phone and make a few calls. That's because over the past several years, in states including Arkansas, Texas and California, bad guys have used these hotels for makeshift methamphetamine [meth] labs. last August, just such a lab blew up at a Quality Inn and Suites in Arlington, Texas, demolishing 60 of its 100 rooms and causing more than $1 million in damage. If you happen to be the next guest in a hotel room used to make meth, just touching an ammonia-saturated bedspread, curtain or carpet can burn your skin, eyes or respiratory tract\u2026. Hotels can shell out thousands just to clean carpeting, bedding, curtains and even drywall before throwing it all away. That's why hotels are training staffs to recognize suspicious guests, especially ones who decline regular housekeeping service\" (\"Is the hotel room next door a meth lab?\" January 12, 2005 \n\nSome notable incidents 20 that have occurred in high-rise hotels are shown in Table 10 -1.\n\nFire is a constant risk in high-rise hotel buildings. \"Since hotel guests are [primarily] transients, special consideration must be given to the potential threat to their life safety from fire. For example, occupants of the residential portion of a hotel sleep in unfamiliar surroundings and could possibly become disoriented when trying to evacuate under heavy smoke conditions. likewise, persons in ballrooms, lounges, [casinos,] and restaurants could become disoriented due to low-level lighting, crowd size, and unfamiliarity with evacuation routes.\" 21 In discussing fire risk, r it is helpful to analyze fire incident data rr for the four property classes-office buildings, hotels and motels, rrr apartment buildings, and hospitals (and other facilities that care for the sick)-that account for the majority of high-rise building fires. 22 even though this data pertains only to the united States, it is worth considering because it includes the types of commercial buildings that are addressed in this book (namely, office, hotel, residential and apartment, and mixed-use buildings).\n\nA study by Dr. John Hall, Jr., of the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) Fire Analysis and research Division, using statistics from the u.S. Fire Administration's National Fire Incident reporting System (NFIrS), stated that from 1987 to 1991, office buildings, hotels and motels, apartment buildings, and facilities that care for the sick 21 Bell Jr. Hotels. In: Fire Protection Handbook. 18th ed. Quincy, MA: National Fire Protection Association; 1997:9-64. S.] high-rise buildings, however, has been less than systematic because the nationally representative fire incident data bases did not originally include reporting of height of structure. reasonably good reporting began with 1985 fires\u2026. NFPA and other analysts have long used lists of particularly memorable incidents to study the high-rise fire problem, but these and other available special data bases are heavily weighed towards larger and more severe incidents.\" ibid., p. 1. rrr \"The term 'motel' is a general designation for lodging establishments that specialize in attracting the motoring public by offering parking accommodations. The distinctions between hotels and motels are gradually disappearing, however\" ( Other information was obtained from various agencies and news sources, many of which are identified in the summaries of a number of the incidents in Chapter 3. At times, reports of casualties were conflicting. Therefore, the number of persons killed and injured could not always be definitively determined. r According to the New York Times, \"No precise number of casualties for the Marriott exists, but it is likely, based on eyewitness accounts analyzed by the New York Times, that no fewer than 50 people inside the hotel were killed. At least 41 of those were firefighters, and the number could be much higher. Besides Mr. Keller [Joseph Keller the executive housekeeper], another Marriott employee, Abdu A. Malahi, was killed. As for guests, 11 of the 940 registered guests that day were 'unaccounted for,' said Cathy Duffy, a spokeswoman for Marriott. It is not known if they died in the building or were elsewhere in the complex\" (Dwyer J, Fessenden F. One hotel's fight to the finish; At the Marriott, a portal to safety as the Towers fell. The New York Times, September 11, 2002 The most recent published study by Hall shows that \"in 2002, 25 high-rise buildings in these four property classes combined had 7,300 reported structure fires and associated losses of 15 civilian deaths, 300 civilian injuries, and $26 million in direct property damage.\" 26 He concluded that \"these statistics generally show a declining fire problem over the nearly two decades covered\" 27 and, similar to his previous findings, \"most high-rise building fires and associated losses occur in apartment buildings.\" 28 However, Hall did caution that, due to a number of factors (one being lower participation in national fire incident reporting in recent years 29 ), \"the patterns shown in data available so far should be given limited weight.\" 30 It is worth noting here that, as previously mentioned, some buildings, particularly \"larger-scale hotel building configurations often have atria two or three stories high and sometimes up to sixty stories high, which are often the focal point of building design. Atrium areas themselves may include several occupancies or mixed functions associated with hotel operations.\" 31 The presence of an atrium constitutes a fire risk. If a fire occurs on the lower floors of the atrium (for example, in a restaurant or a retail space), then the resulting smoke and heat can rise up through the atrium and possibly reach guest rooms on upper floors located on corridors that face toward the atrium). To reduce this risk, according to Brannigan and Corbett, Building codes specify numerous requirements for atria: full sprinkler protection throughout the building (with the exception of the top of the atrium itself if it is more than 55 feet [16.8 meters] above the floor because it is felt that sprinklers will not activate so high above the floor), a smoke control system to minimize the movement of smoke onto the adjacent floors to the atrium and to move the smoke out of the building, and standby power for the building. 24 In addition, the fire code requires that the floor of the atrium be limited to \"low\" fire hazards. Author Corbett has seen this violated many times with moderate and high fire hazards such as live, cut Christmas trees; propane grills in food kiosks; and large plastic displays. This provision is difficult to enforce (hence the desire for sprinklers at the top of tall atria). 32 It is worth noting here that in his book, High Rise/Fire and Life Safety, O'Hagan stated that high-rise residential building fires, including those in hotel rooms, to some extent are different in nature and not as severe as fires in high-rise office buildings (see earlier discussion in Chapter 2). Two of his stated reasons for this position are (1) highrise residential buildings are typically of masonry construction and lack the empty spaces between the interior of their exterior walls and the outer edges of their floors (that typify the curtain walls of steel-framed [core construction] buildings) and (2) for privacy and usage reasons, residential buildings are typically compartmentalized with walls and partitions that have adequate fire resistance to withstand the fire until the arrival of the fire department; as a result, individual fires are considerably smaller in area. 33\n\nWeaknesses that can make an asset (in this case, a hotel building and its operations) susceptible to loss or damage 34 will largely depend on the building itself and the nature of its operations. A vulnerability assessment is required to \"evaluate the potential vulnerability of the critical assets against a broad range of identified threats/hazards.\" 35 (See Chapter 4.)\n\n\"lodging property security efforts may involve such areas of concern as guestroom security, key control, locks, access control, perimeter control, alarm systems, communication systems, lighting, closed-circuit television, safe deposit boxes, inventory control, credit and billing procedures, computer security, staffing, pre-employment screening, employee training, responsible service of alcoholic beverages, emergency procedures, safety procedures, record keeping, and more.\" 36\n\nMitigation measures to counteract the identified vulnerabilities of an asset to a threat may consist of security systems and equipment (see Chapter 5), fire life safety systems and equipment (see Chapter 6), security personnel (see Chapter 7), security policies and procedures (see the next section, \"Security Programs\"), and emergency management (see the later section, \"emergency Planning\"). These countermeasures need to be looked 32 at in terms of security design. \"Security design involves the systematic integration of design, technology, and operation\u2026. The process of designing security into architecture is known as Crime Prevention Through environmental Design (CPTeD).\" 37 As mentioned previously, the key to selecting appropriate countermeasures for a particular facility is for a risk assessment to be conducted. ( Because fire is a risk in high-rise buildings, the following is noted regarding their fire protection features: hotel buildings that have properly designed, installed, operated, tested, and maintained automatic fire detection and suppression systems and other fire protection features-automatic closing fire doors for compartmentation and maintenance of the integrity of occupant escape routes and automatic smoke control systems to restrict the spread of smoke-do have the necessary early warning systems to quickly detect fires and warn occupants (including guests and visitors) of their presence; they also have the necessary automated sprinkler systems to quickly extinguish a fire in its early stages. One of the key issues here is the presence or absence of sprinklers.\n\nIn the study mentioned in the previous section, \"Threats,\" Hall commented on fire protection in high-rise buildings by stating,\n\nIn several instances, the value of these fire protection features [i.e., automatic extinguishing systems (primarily sprinklers), fire detection equipment, and fire-resistive construction] may be seen clearly in a statistical analysis of 1994-1998 loss per fire averages, with and without the protection. For highrise buildings, automatic extinguishing systems are associated with a reduction of at least 88% in the rate of deaths per 1,000 fires for each of the three property classes (excluding office buildings, which had no deaths recorded in NFIRS [National Fire Incident Reporting System] in high-rise buildings) and at least 44% in the average dollar loss per fire for each of the four property classes\u2026.\n\nr Premises security is \"that combination of security measures (such as locks, fences, lights, closed circuit television, and security officer patrolling) in use at a premises (such as a hotel, apartment complex, and office building)\" (Fay JJ. Security Dictionary. Alexandria, VA: ASIS International; 2000:194) . 38 Automatic extinguishing systems and fire detection equipment and the compartmentation features associated with fire-resistive construction all contribute to fire protection by helping to keep fires small, with extinguishing and construction doing so directly and detection doing so by providing early warning that can lead to earlier manual suppression. 39\n\nSecurity programs for hotels and for individual guests and patrons involve policies, rules and regulations, and procedures designed \"to prevent unauthorized persons from entering, to prevent the unauthorized removal of property, and to prevent crime, violence, and other disruptive behavior.\" 40 Security's overall purpose is to protect life and property. \"Because hotels offer such diversity of facilities and activities, no one security program will fit all properties. The security program must be designed to fit the needs and characteristics of the individual hotel. While crime is not always preventable, certain policies and procedures, properly implemented, may deter or discourage criminal activity.\" 41 \"every establishment has to find the right balance for its environment-weighing the benefits of security against the extent to which each measure will inconvenience guests.\" 42\n\nThere are many different people who may, at any one time, wish to enter a hotel building. They include hotel owners and management staff, hotel contractors (such as elevator technicians and engineering, maintenance, security, janitorial, and parking personnel), guests, visitors, salespersons, tradespeople (including construction workers, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, gardeners, telecommunications repair persons, persons replenishing vending machines, and others who service equipment within the hotel), building inspectors, couriers, delivery persons, solicitors, r sightseers, people who are lost, vagrants or homeless people, mentally disturbed individuals, vandals, suicidal persons, protestors, and daredevils. There may also be others who try to enter hotel parking areas, retail shops, restaurants, cocktail lounges, health clubs, business centers, recreational facilities, gyms, exercise rooms, function rooms, meeting rooms, or an individual guest room, with the sole purpose of committing a crime.\n\nIt is primarily the hotel owner and operator who determine the access control measures for this wide spectrum of persons. These measures aim to screen out unwanted persons or intruders and at the same time provide a minimum of inconvenience to hotel guests and legitimate visitors. Varying degrees of access control can be achieved using security staff-in some hotels known as a security officer, a security guard, a doorman, a concierge, or by another title that differs according to the respective duties and responsibilities-and various security measures. In this context, a solicitor is a person who approaches building occupants with the intent to sell something, to ask for business for a company, to request charitable contributions, or to obtain magazine subscriptions. This definition would include people who beg or panhandle for money or food.\n\nBuilding access controls include vehicle access to parking lots, garages, and loading dock/shipping and receiving areas; pedestrian access to building lobbies, elevator lobbies, and passenger and freight/service elevators; and access routes to retail spaces, restaurants, promenades, mezzanines, atria, and maintenance areas. Measures for controlling access to these areas vary from hotel to hotel, depending on the hotel management's policy, but generally they incorporate some or all of those described in the following sections.\n\nHandling of hotel guest and patron vehicles will vary from hotel to hotel and will often include the following: 1. A hotel valet or parking attendant stationed at the front entrance of the hotel to take control of hotel guest and patron vehicles and park them in a parking structure located adjacent to or underneath the hotel or in a surface parking lot outside of the hotel. 2. Hotel guests and patrons self-park their vehicles in a parking structure located adjacent to or underneath the hotel or in a surface parking lot outside of the hotel. either a. there are no controls on the entry of vehicles to structures (apart from vehicle height restrictions at the point of entry to any structure). Many hotels allow such free access. Some require the guests, once they have registered at the reception desk, to display a sheet of paper, placard or sign on their vehicle dash indicating their authorization to park, or b. a ticket (imprinted with the date and time of entry) is dispensed by a machine at the point of entry, which when withdrawn from the control unit automatically opens an entry gate or raises a gate arm. (There will be vehicle height restrictions at the point of entry to any structure.) When exiting a controlled-access parking structure or lot, the driver may be required to make a monetary payment, to present a hotel-validated ticket to a parking attendant, to present the ticket to a pay-on-exit machine and either pay in cash or with a credit card, or to present a token issued by the hotel to a controller that can operate the parking exit barrier. c. the guest room electronic access card provided to guests when they check into the hotel also provides access for their vehicle to the hotel parking areas (both for ingress and egress).\n\nrequiring hotel staff, vendors, and other hotel workers to park in designated safe areas far from the hotel building is a sound security policy. Adherence to this rule frees up available parking spaces closer to the hotel for hotel guests and patrons to use. Not only is this appropriate from a customer service standpoint, but it also keeps hotel staff from parking in specific areas-such as near hotel loading dock/shipping and receiving areas, kitchens, food and alcohol storage areas, and building stairwells-and makes it more difficult (or at least increases the chance of detection) for hotel staff to carry unauthorized items from the hotel to a parked vehicle.\n\nVehicles entering loading dock/shipping and receiving areas either may do so at will and park at whatever loading bays or docks are available, or they may be permitted to enter and be directed to park in certain areas by a loading dock attendant who will then supervise subsequent loading or unloading. Also, docks that are normally unattended may have an intercom or buzzer system, possibly in conjunction with closed-circuit television (CCTV), to allow drivers to remotely summon hotel staff for assistance. For security purposes, the dock attendant normally will maintain a log or record of the vehicle license plate number, the driver's name and company, the time in, and the time out. Depending on building policy, vehicle keys may remain in the vehicle or be given to the dock attendant for safekeeping and to permit the attendant to move the vehicle if necessary.\n\nThe activity of drivers and delivery persons usually will be confined to the loading dock/shipping and receiving areas, unless they need to proceed into the hotel for deliveries or pickups. For this reason, rest areas, toilet facilities, and pay phones may be provided in these areas. If drivers and delivery persons enter the hotel, they are usually required to notify the dock attendant of the specific area they will be visiting and the approximate duration of their stay. They may also be issued special identification badges and required to leave some form of personal identification (such as a driver's license) with the attendant.\n\nSecurity officers or doormen are often present at a larger hotel's main entrances (for major facilities they will be present 24 hours per day, 7 days per week). These individuals (and others such as bellhops r and valet parking attendants) can observe both incoming and outgoing pedestrian traffic and assist hotel guests, patrons, and visitors with information and directions. (Some smaller hotels may rely on hotel reception staff to monitor pedestrian traffic at the hotel's main entrance, if visibility affords it. Such surveillance is not always reliable because staff may be distracted when carrying out other reception duties such as handling guests, answering telephones, etc.) They can also direct persons delivering or picking up items to the appropriate hotel service entrances, assist other legitimate hotel users, and, by being trained observers and asking probing questions, they can help screen out intruders who have no legitimate reason for entering the premises.\n\nDuring business hours (or at least during daytime hours, 7 days per week), pedestrians entering hotel buildings may simply enter the facility at will and proceed to whatever area they desire, including freely using elevators to access guest room floors, or they may be asked to submit to some form of credentialing process before rr they are permitted to r A bellhop, \"also bellboy or bellman, is a hotel porter, who helps patrons with their luggage while checking in or out. They often wear a uniform like certain other page boys or doormen. The job's name is derived from the fact that the hotel's front desk would ring a bell to summon an available employee, who would 'hop' (jump) to attention at the desk in order to receive instructions\u2026. Duties that are often included in this job are opening the front door, moving luggage, valeting cars, calling cabs, transporting guests, giving directions, basic concierge work, and responding to any of the guest needs.\" (Wikipedia. \"Bellboy.\" \ue02chttp://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Bellhop\ue02e; August 4, 2008) . Bellboys are usually supervised by a bell captain.\n\nrr Some hotels only permit guests to enter exterior hotel doors, other than those at the main entrance, by presenting their guest room access card to electronic card readers positioned at these ingress points.\n\nenter the hotel and proceed to interior locations (such as guest room floors, penthouse r or presidential suites, concierge floors; rr and recreational facilities, function rooms, dining areas, and restaurants). Sometimes the process will involve the hotel guests being required to use their room access cards either on the elevator bank wall or at an elevator kiosk before proceeding to an elevator car (as is the case with destination dispatch elevators) or inside the elevator car itself to access their floors or a specific location.\n\nAfter hours (or at least from early to late evening until the next morning, 7 days per week), the procedures may vary. Some hotels may lock all entrances except the main entrance door(s). For entry to interior areas of the hotel, some hotels do not control access to guest floors during normal business hours but do require it after hours. Hotel guests may be required to use their room access cards either on the elevator bank wall or at an elevator kiosk before proceeding to an elevator car (as is the case with destination dispatch elevators) or inside the elevator car itself to access their floors or a specific location; or for hotels that do not have card-access controlled elevators, a temporary kiosk may be set up at the entrance to each guest elevator lobby, and a security officer or a doorman requires guests to produce their room access cards before proceeding to use the elevators.\n\nThe degree of access control imposed by a hotel determines the percentage of unwanted persons successfully screened out. \"The security program should be designed just tight enough to screen out as many intruders as it takes to reduce problems to the level that can be accepted. This means that a useful security program will rarely screen out all intruders.\" 43 Because hotels desire to create a warm, welcoming atmosphere, often access control measures will not be tight due to the fear of driving away guests, patrons, and legitimate users of the hotel's facilities.\n\nSigns or sidewalk plates, generally located outside the hotel, may state the following: \"rIGHT TO PASS By PerMISSION, AND SuBJeCT TO CONTrOl, OF OWNerS\" or \"PerMISSION TO PASS reVOCABle AT ANy TIMe.\"\n\nIf a person who does not have a legitimate reason for being in the hotel is discovered, then the hotel owner, manager, or agent acting on behalf of the hotel may revoke the person's right to remain. Due to the limited authority of security staff, \"any activities which limit the freedom of movement of any person or persons in the lodging 43 After being told to depart the premises, those who refuse to leave may be subject to arrest by law enforcement. Also, anyone reentering a hotel after having been warned that he or she is not authorized to enter may be treated as a trespasser. These actions should be thoroughly documented.\n\nDoors leading to stairwell doors are unlocked from the floor side (as required by life safety codes as a means of egress during an emergency) and are also usually unlocked from the stairwell side leading onto the floor, including on all guest room floors (with the possible exceptions of the concierge floor and hotel service floors).\n\nAccess to maintenance areas (mechanical rooms and floors, air-conditioning rooms, telecommunications and utilities access points, and elevator machine rooms), storage closets, and areas under construction or renovation usually will be tight. Depending on hotel 44 policy, persons accessing these areas may be logged in and out, required to wear special identification badges, given keys (although issuing keys to vendors or visitors can be a security risk) or an access card (if the card is not returned, it can be immediately deactivated) to a particular area, or provided an escort. Some contractors servicing certain types of equipment in specific hotel areas may be permitted to install their own locking devices at access points leading to this equipment (see further comments in the \"Key Points to Consider\" section presented later in this chapter). Main electrical switchgear and power transformer rooms are usually deemed such a life safety risk that no hotel personnel are issued keys to these areas.\n\nOn checking into many hotels and providing appropriate photo identification, a guest is often given a paper folder containing an electronic access card r that can be presented to a card reader located on the entrance door to the guest's room or suite. This card is programmed with its own unique identification number and is valid only for the scheduled period of stay. Presenting of a valid card to the door reader will permit entry and record each individual transaction. (each individual card reader is usually battery powered and will continue to operate during a power failure.)\n\nThe access card does not have the guest's room number recorded on it. Hand written inside the folder is the guest's room number, plus possibly some simple security and safety information printed on the folder. \"The guest should be reminded to keep the room number identifier separate from the key or keycard or the identification of the keycard will be compromised.\" 46 unless the guest is visually impaired, the staff checking in the guest usually does not speak the room number out loud. This is done to ensure that no one else in close proximity can hear the conversation and thereby know where the guest will be staying. (A guest's room number should never be revealed to outsiders other than the guest. rr ) If the hotel has its elevators on access control, a guest can present this same card to the elevator system to gain access to the floor on which her or his room is located.\n\nIf there is a problem using an access card, the guest loses their card, or the guest inadvertently leaves their card in their room when they exit the room, the guest can speak to any available hotel security staff or request housekeeping staff to contact hotel security, use a house telephone (usually located on guest floors in each elevator lobby) or a mobile telephone to contact the lobby reception desk, or return in person to the front reception desk. If the guest goes to the reception desk with their photo identification, hotel reception staff can simply program another card for the guest. If the guest has left their personal identification in their room, hotel security or other hotel staff can accompany the person to the room in question, use their own access card to permit the guest entry to the room, and observe the guest retrieving their identification for confirmation of identity. In the case of the guest having left their access card in the room, the guest can then retrieve it; in the case where the card is not working properly, or has been lost, a replacement card can be made for the guest by the hotel. r In the past, keys were commonly issued to hotel guests to access and secure their rooms. However, keys can be fairly easily duplicated and present problems if they are lost or stolen. Today, throughout the world, most hotels issue electronic access cards-sometimes simply called keycards-that operate guest room electronic door locks. 46 For security reasons, most hotel access cards will display no identifying marks (such as the hotel's trademark, its name, or its address) that indicate where it might be used. Then, if a card is lost, there are no identifiers to indicate from which hotel it came. If used with an insertion or a swipe-type card reader, there may be an arrow depicting the correct way to insert or swipe the card (or other simple step-by-step instructions on its use). An advantage of an electronic access card is that if it is missing (either lost or stolen) or when a guest leaves the hotel, the card can be immediately deactivated at a hotel computer without the need to retrieve the card itself. (Some hotels allow guests to keep the card as a memento of their stay. However, if the card does not contain identifying information, then much of the appeal for keeping the card is diminished.) regarding the value of access card-controlled door locks, lauer stated, Since the introduction of the recodable electronic door lock in the late 1970's, hotel security has been virtually transformed. The focus at the time of inception was increased guest security, but the benefit to the property was quickly realized. Hotel security experts, along with media pundits, the courts, and the insurance industry all agree-keycard locks, which can be easily changed so that every guest gets a new key, are the best way to boost security\u2026.\n\nEmployee access control was one of the first system enhancements to increase the level of internal technology. In order for a property to be maintained efficiently, hotel personnel require their own means of entry to rooms in which they must perform daily routines or tasks. In the past, distribution of conventional keys to housekeepers, room service attendants, and maintenance personnel compromised guest belongings and increased the liability of the hotel. In some instances of theft, the victim was often the hotel (where even the negligent customer is king), and claims went unchallenged. The \"burden of proof\" is welcome by a hotel equipped with modern electronic locks, for the actual lock serves as a log, monitoring and recording up to 1,000 entries (about 100 days worth). Many reputations have been restored and many a thankful employee has been cleared of suspicion due to the success of these products. Employee key cards can be coded to allow access only to their assigned units of responsibility and only during the hours of their shift. Knowledge of these system capabilities may also serve as a deterrent to those less ethical. 47 In the case of a reported theft from a guest's room, the event history of cards used to enter the room and when entries occurred can be determined by interrogating r the lock at the door itself (using a small hand-held device); or if the lock uses a hardwired or a wireless system, rr this information can be determined with the use of an online central computer at the front reception desk or the security command center, eliminating the 47 lauer e. \"Hotel security: The evolving electronic lock.\" Spring 1999. \ue02cwww.hotel-online.com/News/ Pressreleases1999_2nd/Apr99_electroniclocks.html\ue02e; August 2, 2008. r In this context, interrogate means to examine the audit trail of events when access cards were used to operate an electronic lock. need to go to each individual lock. This information can be vital in such an investigation, particularly if there were no visible signs of a forced entry. 48 Technology is also available to determine whether a door was opened from the inside of the room (such a feature is invaluable in investigations to determine when a door was opened and whether an access card was used in the process).\n\nFor hotels that do not have a guest room locking system connected to a central computer, when a guest checks out of their room the access card to that room usually remains active until the next guest assigned to that room presents their card to the door reader or the scheduled time of stay expires. r When the next guest to that room uses their card it will automatically delete the previous guest's access privileges. Therefore, until the new guest arrives, the possibility exists that the previous guest could continue to access their room until their scheduled time of stay expires. This issue does not exist with a centralized, online computer-controlled card system since the card's access privileges can be immediately deleted at the reception desk's central computer when the guest checks out.\n\nIn addition to completely closing the door when entering the hotel room (and leaving it closed rr while in the room), guests may improve their room security by engaging any secondary locking mechanism, such as a deadbolt lock, rrr a door swing arm security restraint, or a safety chain. Also, if there is a connecting room, guests should check that the door leading to it is locked.\n\nIt is important that guests never open their doors for anyone that they do not know personally or for room service or hotel maintenance that they did not request, even if the person is wearing a name tag, as most hotel employees are required to do. Any guest who is in any doubt as to the identity of anyone requesting entry should immediately telephone the hotel reception desk to report the matter or to verify the identity of the person in question and determine the purpose for allowing the person to enter the room.\n\nIn many hotel guest rooms, the main entrance door is equipped with a conventional door viewer (sometimes called a view port) rrrr to provide a clear view of the other side of the door (using a hollow end or peephole to look through and a lens at the other end to give a wide viewing angle) and of anyone requesting entry. (Some hotels have a small box housing the view port. A printed sign informs the guest to \"lIFT THe leVer FOr VIeWING. VIeW THe CAller BeFOre OPeNING THe DOOr.\") Also, digital door viewers are available. Such a device \"includes an lCD monitor that mounts on the inside of the guest room door with a digital camera on the outside to r This same time control feature also can be utilized to issue housekeepers with keycards that only work during their shifts (Channell, WT. electronic locks finding the right fit. Alexandria, VA: Security Management: January 1996:61).\n\nrr Although a guest who is entertaining a visitor may decide for appearances sake to leave the door ajar while in the room. However, if there is such a concern, it may be more appropriate to meet the person in a public area such as the hotel lobby or a restaurant. rrr Some hotels use spring-activated deadbolts, which automatically engage when the door is closed without requiring the guest to manually engage the deadbolt in order to double lock the door. provide a clear and effortless view.\" 49 The guest should use these viewing devices to see the person requesting entry before granting or denying access.\n\nIf a hotel guest in-room safe is provided, a guest should secure in it any valuables (such as money, credit cards, jewelry, documents, airline tickets, clothing, or other items of considerable value, and, if the safe is large enough, any laptop computer). If the safe uses a security key that can be removed from the safe only after the door is closed and locked, the guest should keep the key safely in her or his possession at all times. If the safe has a digital keypad system, the guest should record the combination selected for the safe but make sure not to leave it lying around in the room.\n\nIf no guest in-room safe is available, the guest should consider using any safe deposit boxes located at the hotel's main reception desk. (If neither is available and the hotel offers to take possession of valuables, the guest should request to see where the items are being secured. If there is a concern they are not being adequately protected, the guest should not leave such items in the hotel's possession. r )\n\nIf the guest decides to leave valuable items in the room, they should be secured in the room (for example, the guest can anchor a laptop with an appropriate cable and lock it to an immovable room fixture rr ) or hidden from view as much as possible (such items are still at considerable risk for an experienced thief to search for and find, even if extremely well hidden). Also, leaving valuable items in vehicles parked in the hotel's parking garage is a risk. If a guest does so, these items should always be out of sight and secured in the vehicle's trunk (boot) or locked glove box compartment. using a valet service may potentially increase the chance of such items being taken from the vehicle.\n\nGuests should familiarize themselves with the telephone in their guest rooms to ensure they know how to dial the main reception desk or any other emergency services. They should also pay attention to security and safety information-usually in the form of listed security and safety awareness tips-provided to them at check-in (for example, printed on the paper folder containing the room key or keycard), contained in any guest information book or brochure provided in the guest room, posted on the back of the guest room main entrance door (see Figure 10 -2) (including information on steps to take if a fire emergency occurs, including a plan depicting the emergency exits on the floor in question and possibly the location of manual fire alarm stations on the floor), or displayed in a program on any hotel television channel. Guests can play an important part in any hotel security and life safety program by promptly reporting things such as suspicious persons rrr or activities, safety hazards, or the smell of smoke to hotel management and security staff. In hotel meeting rooms, a similar security precaution can be taken by securing the laptop to a meeting room table. \"In addition, some hotels have provided roll-in safes for meeting rooms, with newer models outfitted with electrical outlets so that the laptop can be charged while secured\" (\"lodging no complaints\" by Chad Callaghan, CPP, ClSD, vice president of loss prevention for Marriott International [Security Management. Alexandria, VA; June 2001:76]).\n\nOf course, this is no guarantee that a physically secured laptop will not be interfered with or the information within it compromised. encrypted software may be used to protect information stored in a laptop computer. As part of guest room security, when a hotel operator receives a call from an outside telephone line or an internal house phone requesting connection to a guest room, the operator should never forward such a call unless the caller is able to provide the guest's name and, depending on hotel policy, possibly the guest's room number.\n\nThe hotel operator and receptionists should never reveal the room number of a guest to anyone other than the guest. As mentioned previously, when checking in a guest and handing the person the guest room access card, the receptionist should never loudly announce the room number (to prevent someone standing close by from hearing this information). Instead they should speak softly or indicate the room number by pointing to it written on the folder containing the card. r When leaving the room, the guest should make sure any exterior sliding glass doors and all windows are closed and locked and should engage any additional devices (such as added locking mechanisms or material that can be placed in the channel in which a sliding door or window is designed to glide along) that limit the distance the door(s) or the window(s) can open; and on exiting the hotel room door, the guest should make sure it is completely closed and locked, testing it by trying to open it again without using a key or access card (some opportunists may methodically walk hotel corridors to locate an unsecured room; such activity may be for criminal purposes or simply to find a vacant room to use). Also, when not in the room, leaving the \"Do Not Disturb\" notice on the door and a television set on may be a deterrent to a would-bethief. While out of the room, guests should keep the room access card in their possession at all times, particularly if it is housed in a paper wallet on which the room number is written. On leaving the room, guests should make sure they take the room access card with them.\n\nWhen returning to the hotel after dark, guests consciously pay attention to their surroundings, keep to well-lighted areas, and use the main entrance of the hotel. 50\n\nAccording to ellis and Stipanuk,\n\nA guest with vision impairment should be taken aside, out of the hearing of others, to be told the room number. Hotel room doors should be equipped with Braille numbers or raised numerals for blind persons to find their designated room, or they should be escorted to their room by hotel security or other hotel staff. Depending on local laws or a hotel's policy, some facilities may have specially designated guest rooms for persons with impairments. 50 \n\nAccording to Beaudry,\n\nAccording to Beaudry,\n\nThe hotel may make reasonable regulations governing the conduct of guests, provided such regulations are applied to all persons, without discrimination. These regulations can be designed to prevent immorality, drunkenness, or any form of willful misconduct, e.g., loud obnoxious behavior, r drug activity, etc., that may offend other guests, may bring the hotel into disrepute, or may be inconsistent with the generally recognized properties of life. The hotel has the right to evict any guest who willfully violates these rules\u2026.\n\nObviously, the eviction must be done in a reasonable manner. If guests refuse to leave the hotel after their attention has been called to the violation and they have been requested to leave and given a reasonable opportunity to do so, the hotel may forcibly evict them. \n\nWhen a hotel guest becomes ill with a contagious disease, the hotel management, after notifying the guest that he or she must leave, has the right to remove the guest in a careful manner and at an appropriate time to a hospital or other place of safety, provided this does not imperil the guest's life. As a practical matter, however, it is preferable to consult with an attorney and report these matters to the proper local authorities. Usually the local authorities will take charge and remove the sick guest. The illness of an indigent guest should be reported to the local department of welfare, communicable diseases should be reported to the local health authorities, and psychiatric cases should be reported to police. 53\n\nIn hotels, people may be escorted for a variety of reasons. It may be to protect individuals or the property that they are carrying. It may also be to show a person, unfamiliar with a site or facility, to a particular location.\n\nEscorts to and from the Hotel escorts to and from a hotel usually occur after normal business hours. Security staff members generally conduct these escorts. Hotel guests, particularly older residents or females, may request hotel security to escort them to areas of the property such as parking garages. Hotel policy should dictate how, when, and where the escorts are to be conducted.\n\nSome guests may require escorts to their rooms, and hotel staff such as cashiers may require escorts to areas where monies are secured. Also, hotel policy may require that persons needing access to certain maintenance spaces and areas under construction or renovation be provided with an escort to accompany them whenever they are in these areas. Building engineering or security staff may be required to provide such escorts.\n\nSome hotels have a list of local and state agencies whose inspectors are authorized to enter, but it is absolutely critical to verify the identification of these individuals and to make hotel management aware of their presence before they are granted entry. It is important to escort anyone claiming to be an inspector while he or she is in the facility.\n\nMost hotels allow the free movement of guest's luggage and possessions into and out of the facility. This makes the control of property extremely difficult, if not impossible.\n\nThe objectives of a property control system are threefold: 54 l To prevent stolen property or other unauthorized items from leaving. Stolen property may include furniture and furnishings, entertainment equipment, antiques and works 53 of art from hotel guest rooms, function rooms, convention facilities, restaurants, and dining areas; cash and negotiable instruments from reception and restaurant areas, retail shops, and other areas handling such items; computers and printers from administrative offices and business centers; equipment from recreation areas, kitchens, dining areas, restaurants, retail shops, newsstands, entertainment centers, kitchens, and laundries; equipment and exhibits from exhibit areas; and property from inside vehicles parked in the hotel's parking garage. l To prevent dangerous items entering. Items such as explosives, illegal drugs, and hazardous materials might easily be secreted on a person, in that person's luggage, or in a vehicle and brought into a hotel. l To prevent unnecessary or disruptive delivery traffic. By keeping out misdirected deliveries, unnecessary traffic is avoided. By routing deliveries through proper entrances, such as loading docks and freight/service elevators, disruptive traffic is avoided and the guest elevators are protected against damage from hand trucks and bulky crates.\n\nThe use of property control systems for guests and patrons is usually not appropriate in the hotel setting. r However, guests and patrons may hand over certain property to hotel staff for temporary safe keeping (for example, items placed in safe deposit boxes, coats and hats checked in at restaurants, and luggage stored after a guest has checked out of the hotel but has not yet left the facility). Also, during special events, such as those involving valuable exhibits, strict property removal control may be required to protect the exhibits; and the hotel, particularly a larger one, may require hotel staff and workers to enter and leave the hotel through an employee entrance and be subject to periodic inspections of bags, containers, and packages. However, it is unusual for vehicles, even those entering under-building hotel parking garages and loading dock areas, to be inspected.\n\nGood housekeeping should always be practiced for trash (rubbish) storage, trash compacting, and dumpster areas. Hotel staff, including security and housekeeping staff, should be alert for objects, items, materials, or parcels that look out of place or suspicious, and for large items being removed from the facility.\n\nHotels receive deliveries of assorted items for guests (for example, delayed airline luggage). Also, couriers sometimes come to a hotel to pick up packages and sundry other items. The entry of delivery persons and couriers needs to be strictly controlled. Depending on the size of the hotel, such items will be handled inside the hotel by bellhops and possibly a business center where shipping and receiving services are offered. like any well-run operation, these programs need to be meticulously documented to provide an audit trail to track deliveries and pickups and ensure that these tasks are being done in a timely manner.\n\nSpecial events where exhibits of various items, some of which may be of high value, that are held in the hotel require special security measures. When the exhibitors are r However, since the 2008 Mumbai bombing incident, some hotels are searching guest's bags, deploying X-ray machines at entrances, scanning guest luggage upon arrival, and, in future, may not permit luggage storage or packages or luggage to be to accepted prior to the guest's arrival (Conde Nast Traveler. Brady S. Wake up call: lessons learned from Mumbai. March 9, 2009 . \ue02chttp://www.concierge.com/cntraveler/ articles/500281\ue02e; March 20, 2009. present, responsibility for these items is generally theirs. However, when the exhibition hall or room is closed (and particularly if the exhibits are left overnight), the exhibitors will need to make special arrangements, in conjunction with hotel management, to protect these items. Protective measures may involve the use of hotel security or contract security staff, video surveillance, or intrusion detection systems in the area where the exhibits are located. It is critical that all arrangements be thoroughly documented, contracts and insurance policies be in place, and that there is a clear understanding of any liability burdens that the hotel may be assuming while the exhibits are in the hotel, including the time periods when the exhibition is being set up or dismantled.\n\nWhen a hotel is being constructed or remodeled, the security department needs to be a critical part of the operation. It is particularly important that access control measures are in place to prevent the unauthorized removal of property from the hotel, including hotel fixtures and equipment.\n\nHandling lost and found property is an important part of an effective security program. Most people can recall the anguish they felt on discovering that a valuable personal possession or business item was missing. likewise, one may remember the exhilaration at being contacted and informed that the missing property had been found and was available for pickup.\n\nIf property is lost in a hotel and is subsequently found and handed to hotel staff, the item should be kept in a secure place (including a safe deposit box for items such as cash, credit cards, traveler's checks, jewelry, etc.) and, if possible, expeditiously returned to its rightful owner. This can considerably enhance the trust and confidence that hotel guests and patrons will have in the hotel's operations. Just the opposite will be true if a guest or patron learns that the found item was handed to hotel security and was then lost or went missing.\n\nHotel staff should maintain a list of lost and found items in a lost and found property log. The log should contain details such as the following: l A brief description of the property, including any serial or asset tag numbers l The date, time, and place the property was lost or found l The identity of, and means to contact, the person who lost or found the property l If the property is claimed, the identity of, and means to contact, the claimant and the signature of the person who received the property l The names of the person who took the report of the lost property, logged in the found item, or handled the return of the property to its rightful owner\n\nIf the lost property is particularly valuable or sensitive, it may be necessary for the local law enforcement agency to be contacted; if the property is subsequently handed over to local authorities, this fact, including the identity of the receiving law enforcement officer, should be noted. A receipt for the property should be obtained. local and state laws often determine the handling of lost property. r Some jurisdictions allow found property, when its owner is unknown and its value is below a certain amount, to be distributed to local charitable organizations. Others, after a certain waiting period, auction the property or allow the finder to assume ownership of it.\n\nIf a guest staying alone at the hotel is sick or injured and needs to be transported for medical help or dies while on the premises, a member of the hotel's staff, in the presence of another staff member, will need to itemize the guest's personal property and store it in a safe location until the guest or an authorized representative can take possession of it. Of course, the handling of a deceased guest's property will depend on whether law enforcement is involved as part of a criminal investigation. In this case, if a suspicious death has occurred in the guest room, the room may be considered a crime scene that needs to be protected (see a discussion of crime scenes in Appendix 9-2 on the CD-rOM provided with this book). If a similar type of death occurs in a public area, the scene will need to be protected accordingly.\n\nHousekeeping staff (who wear uniforms and usually name or photograph identification cards) are assigned to clean and replenish the supplies of designated guest rooms on a floor. Because they often work alone in guest rooms there is the opportunity for them to steal a guest's property or copy information from confidential documents or a laptop computer or other electronic media left in the room.\n\nBecause housekeeping staff are assigned rooms, this can make investigations involving housekeeping staff easier as management will know which housekeeper handled which rooms on a particular day. In itself, this can be a strong deterrent to dishonest behavior.\n\nDuring the hiring process, housekeeping staff should be carefully screened, including conducting a thorough background investigation. As part of preemployment or preassignment agreements, housekeeping staff may be asked to submit to a visual inspection of any items they are carrying to and from work-lunch pails, bags, backpacks, packages, and so on. The frequency of the inspections can be established as part of the agreement: inspections may be conducted every time the employee enters or leaves the hotel, at random, or only with cause.\n\nHousekeeping supervisors or hotel security staff members usually conduct such inspections. They are visual only, and employees are requested to open appropriate items themselves. under no circumstances does the inspecting person touch the items being inspected or attempt to inspect any part of the employee's person or clothing.\n\nr For example, in California, Section 2080 of the California Civil Code does not require a person to take charge of found property, but if the person does, she or he can be sued for the negligent handling of it. The law further provides that if the owner of lost property is known, the property must be returned to that owner. If the owner is not known and the property has a value above ten dollars, the property must be turned over to the local police within a reasonable period of time (American Protective Services. Administrative News: Oakland, CA; 1993:4).\n\nAll persons have a legal right and expectation of privacy, so items such as purses will be subject to inspection only under special circumstances, the nature of which should be established in writing beforehand.\n\nThe housekeeping staff constitutes an important part of a hotel's security program. r Some of the ways these employees can impact security are as follows:\n\n1. When cleaning guest rooms, either taking their cleaning and supplies cart inside the room and locking the room door while servicing the room, or leaving the room entrance door open, with the cart immediately outside to partially block the entrance. They should not allow persons, other than the room guest, to enter the room while they are working (unless the room guest authorizes others to enter). 2. recognizing potential security hazards (such as malfunctioning door locking mechanisms) and safety hazards (such as potential slip-and-fall hazards like a water leak, broken flooring, slippery floor mats or damaged carpeting). 3. Being alert for people who act in a suspicious manner (including guests who decline regular housekeeping service, particularly for more than one day), as well as for objects, items, materials or parcels that look out of place or suspiciousincluding plastic tubes, glass containers, and supplies of household chemicalsand strong odors that may indicate a clandestine drug laboratory. 4. reporting missing signs and notices displaying security and safety information and hotel liability notices that should be securely attached to the back of guest room doors, and similar information contained in guest information books or brochures provided in the guest rooms.\n\nIn hotel buildings, keys and electronic access cards to various parts of the facility are under the control of hotel management and departments that include security, engineering, and housekeeping. Hotel management personnel obviously need to have access to all areas of the hotel they manage. Depending on how the hotel is managed and how security staff is utilized, security personnel also will need access to certain areas. Building engineers, because of the nature of their work, need access to virtually all areas, including guest rooms. Housekeeping personnel will need access to guest rooms and rooms where cleaning and supplies are kept. Depending on the size of the hotel and the services provided, various other department heads, including those overseeing function rooms, business and conference centers, restaurants, kitchens, and recreational facilities, will need keys and access cards pertaining to their areas of responsibility. rr Also, during r All staff members are an important part of a hotel's operations. In numerous ways they are the eyes and ears of the hotel's security and fire life safety program. \"Nonsecurity staff should also be concerned about security\u2026.\n\n[B]y training the entire hotel security staff to report security and safety concerns, security departments can cost-effectively improve site safety, thus enhancing customer's overall perceptions of the facility\" (\"lodging no complaints\" by Chad Callaghan, CPP, ClSD, vice president of loss prevention for Marriott International In some hotels, telecommunications technicians, gas, water, and power utility workers are permitted to attach their own locking devices to areas containing their equipment. This practice is convenient because hotel staffs are not required to open these areas, but it compromises security because control of keys and the areas special circumstances (such as during medical emergencies or when a guest has died), there will be the need for designated hotel personnel (possibly security and engineering or hotel management staff) to override the locking systems to enter a guest room.\n\nKeys and access cards should be issued only to those persons who can be entrusted with them and who have an absolute need for them. The status a person may feel by possessing certain keys and access cards should not enter into the decision-making process.\n\nMost lodging properties use at least three levels of keying. These levels typically include emergency keys, master keys, and guestroom keys. The emergency key opens all guestroom doors, even when they are double locked. It can be used, for example, to enter a room when the guest needs aid and is unable to reach or open the door. The emergency key should be highly protected and its use strictly controlled and recorded; it should never leave the property. One procedure for emergency keys is to have them locked in a safe or safe deposit box [or in a locked or sealed key cabinet with the cabinet's key, lock code, access card, or replacement seal in strict custody] and signed out by the individual needing one. The log should be dated and signed by the individual taking the key.\n\nA master key opens all guestrooms that are not double locked. Depending upon the need, the master key or keycard [access card] may be further established as a section master, a floor master, or a grand master. For example the section master may be used by a housekeeping supervisor who is providing a quality check on service of the room by the room attendant. If it is more practical for the entire floor to be supervised by one person, that individual would be provided with a floor master. The executive housekeeper and assistant housekeeper would have a grand master, permitting access to any guestroom. Similarly, the management should establish protocol on use of these levels of master keys or keycards [access cards] for engineering and maintenance, room service, mini-bar replenishment and service, front and bell service, [technology personnel, rr ] and security\u2026.\n\nThe guestroom key opens a single guestroom if the door is not double locked. Guestroom keys should be controlled by front desk personnel, who should always make sure the person receiving the guestroom key is the guest registered for that room. Appropriate identification should always be requested. An effort should be made to retrieve keys from guests when they r For additional information on the control of keys, see Chapter 5, \"Key Control.\" themselves has been lost. These areas could be used to store unauthorized or stolen items, and general housekeeping may become a problem. If this practice is permitted, no one should be allowed to place a lock on a door without hotel management or other building departments (such as engineering) having a key. In an emergency, keys must be available for access. A possible alternative is for contractors to store their equipment, including tools, in heavily reinforced large steel boxes, chests, and cabinets that can be secured using highsecurity padlocks that are protected from attack with cutting tools, or the equipment can be stored in cardaccess controlled areas.\n\nrr Hotels that provide Internet connectivity for guests may need to access guest rooms to deal with computer network issues. check out. For the convenience of, and as a reminder to, the guest, consider having well-secured r key return boxes located in the lobby, at exit points of the hotel or motel, and in courtesy vehicles\u2026.\n\nWhenever there is any known or suspected compromise of any metal keys, a loss or theft, or an unauthorized entry by key, the affected lock(s) should be changed or rotated to another portion of the property. When master keys or emergency keys are involved, re-keying the entire area should be considered. 55 Keys and access cards issued to the hotel staff should never be permitted to leave the hotel. They should be passed from shift to shift, and a receipt should be recorded each time they change hands. All personnel understand the importance of not permitting keys and access cards to be compromised.\n\nMobile patrols may be conducted in hotels for a variety of security and fire life safety purposes. \"Guards [security officers] are typically highly visible thus offering something of a deterrent effect and at the same time imparting a sense of security to the [hotel's guests, patrons,] and visitors.\" 56 Patrolling increases this visibility. Patrols can also be used to note and quickly address anything significant or unusual affecting security or fire life safety. After conducting a risk assessment (as described in Chapter 4), the purpose, frequency, and routing of patrols can be determined by hotel management and the security department (and, if special circumstances warrant, with the cooperation of local authorities) and then carried out and thoroughly documented.\n\nPatrols by security staff in hotel buildings may occur as follows: l Continuously throughout all common areas (including hotel lobbies, retail arcades, rr and other areas that hotel guests and visitors can freely access); restaurant, recreation facilities (including swimming pool and spa areas), meeting room, and function areas; building stairwells; maintenance areas (including shipping and receiving areas, rubbish/trash disposal areas, and other areas as deemed necessary by the hotel) and guest room floors to report obstructions (particularly those blocking emergency egress routes), fire hazards, broken glass, missing equipment (such as portable fire extinguishers), water or gas leaks, wet floors, holes, defects in floor coverings, tiles missing, unsecured areas, malfunctioning lighting equipment, doors r It is absolutely essential that not only can the key return box's interior not be accessed, or a key \"fished out,\" but also the box itself must be firmly anchored so that it cannot be easily removed. Such boxes should be located in areas continuously supervised by hotel staff. 55 In some hotels, the patrolling officer carries a pager, a mobile telephone, or a hand-held panic alarm so that hotel staff and retailers can summon the officer for assistance. left unlocked or not completely closed, signs of forced entry, unauthorized and suspicious persons (such as persons loitering and possible prostitutes) and inebriated persons, and others (including hotel staff) found in areas in which they would not normally belong, and so on. (On hotel floors, patrol management stations are often installed at each stairwell so that the patrolling officer must traverse the floor to complete the tour.) l Depending on a hotel's facilities, patrols may also be conducted of exterior grounds, public parks, and other areas, with times varying according to their operating hours. (Motor vehicles, electric carts, bicycles, tricycles, and personal transporters may be used for patrolling large parking areas with long travel distances.) l Continuously in parking garages and lots to deter theft of vehicles and property within them; note parking violations r and possibly issue warnings or citations (hotels are often reluctant to issue citations for fear of losing customers); observe vehicle lights or engines left on, leaks from vehicles, or other unusual conditions of parked vehicles; report fire hazards, water or gas leaks, malfunctioning lighting equipment, broken vehicle windows and other signs of forced entry, unauthorized and suspicious persons, and others (including hotel staff) found in areas in which they would not normally belong; and provide for the general safety of guests, patrons, and visitors. (In parking garages, patrol management stations are often installed at each stairwell so that the patrolling officer must traverse the floor in order to complete the tour.) l To perform a fire watch when a hotel has exceptional hazards or the fire protection system is impaired. rr A fire watch is \"the assignment of a person or persons to an area for the express purpose of notifying the fire department and/or building occupants of an emergency, preventing a fire from occurring, extinguishing small fires, or protecting the public from fire or life safety dangers.\" 57 It is vital that when such an activity is to be performed that the local fire department or other authority having jurisdiction is consulted.\n\nPatrolling Tips l Patrols can be conducted either on foot or using a motor vehicle, an electric cart, a bicycle, a tricycle, or a personal transporter. l There should be reliable communication between the patrolling officer and the security department or the supervisor. r Violations include vehicles improperly parked, parked in a NO PArKING zone or space, parked in a reSerVeD zone or space, or parked in a DISABleD/PHySICAlly IMPAIreD designated space. When placing such a notice on a vehicle, preferably locate it in the lower corner of the driver's window (immediately above the door handle) where it will be visible to the driver when entering the vehicle but will not obstruct his or her field of vision when driving. Also, the notice should be of a nonadhesive material that can be easily removed from the glass (comments by Chuck Hutchinson, National Director of Security and life Safety, The Hanover Company, August 2008).\n\nrr For example, in the united States, according to NFPA 601, Standard for Security Services in Fire Loss Prevention, Chapter 3, Security Functions and Duties, \"a security officer shall make rounds at intervals determined by management. When operations in the property normally are suspended, officers shall make rounds hourly or as assigned by management. Where special conditions exist, such as the presence of exceptional hazards or when fire protection equipment is impaired, management shall institute additional rounds. The first round shall begin within 30 minutes after the end of activities of the preceding work shift. During this round, the security officer shall make a thorough inspection of all buildings or spaces\" (Section 3-2.1-3-3. Whenever possible, routine patrols should be conducted in a random, unpredictable manner to avoid a fixed pattern or routine that someone planning to commit a crime can observe. Sometimes, an effective tactic is for an officer to \"double back,\" or retrace steps to a previous location; anyone observing the patrolling officer's movements would usually not expect the officer to return quickly to an area just visited. l \"Alertness, interest and thoroughness must be displayed. A suspicious mind must be cultivated and anything that appears other than normal must be looked into.\" 58 l using a flashlight or a torch in areas where lighting is poor or nonexistent is extremely useful.\n\nl Simply applying pressure with the hand on a guest room door will reveal if it is securely closed. l \"A simple but effective patrol plan should be established in each area. Its efficiency should be regularly checked by means of [patrol management devices], r radio or telephone checks at regular intervals, etc. Failure to report, or deviation from described assignments, should immediately be investigated.\" 59 Patrol management devices \"provide the security manager with a consistent record of rounds and occurrences at a facility without the need for human supervision to ensure that rounds are completed as assigned.\" 60 If an electronic patrol management device is not used, a notebook is very useful for recording observations. (The patrolling officer can carry the notebook, or it can be positioned at designated patrol stations so the officer can record when visiting a particular area.)\n\nAs with the hiring of other members of the hotel staff, security personnel should be carefully screened, including being subject to a thorough background investigation. They should also be thoroughly trained in their duties and responsibilities (see Chapter 7 \"Selection, Training, Testing, and Supervision of Security Staff\" for additional information).\n\nFor a building owner or manager to effectively manage an incident that constitutes an emergency in a hotel building, it is critical to plan ahead. Before proceeding, it is appropriate to review several key concepts.\n\nA disruption is \"an event that interrupts normal business, functions, operations, or processes whether anticipated (e.g., hurricane, political unrest) or unanticipated (e.g., a [power] blackout, terror attack, technology failure, or earthquake).\" 62 An emergency is \"an event, actual or imminent, which endangers or threatens to endanger life, property or the environment, and which requires a significant and coordinated response.\" 63 During an emergency there may be chaotic conditions, particularly if there is a disruption in normal communications.\n\nA crisis is \"an unstable condition involving an impending abrupt or significant change that requires urgent attention and action to protect life, assets, property, or the environment.\" 64 Emergency management (also sometimes known as crisis management) is defined as \"the organization and management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all aspects of emergencies, in particular preparedness [and] response.\" r A plan is defined as \"a scheme or method of acting or proceeding developed in advance.\" 65 Combining the terms emergency management and a plan can lead to a definition of an emergency management plan rr as \"a scheme or method of acting or proceeding developed in advance for the organization and management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all aspects of emergencies, in particular preparedness and response. The uN definition states that emergency management is \"the organization and management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all aspects of emergencies, in particular preparedness, response and rehabilitation.\" The word rehabilitation has been removed. The reason for this is that for the purposes of this book, an emergency management plan addresses preparedness and response to an emergency and shortly thereafter. It does not deal with the rehabilitation process because, in the opinion of the author, that process is part of business continuity planning, which is \"an interdisciplinary concept used to create and validate a practiced logistical plan for how an organization will recover and restore partially or completely interrupted critical function(s) within a predetermined time after a disaster or extended disruption\" (Wikipedia. \"Business Continuity Planning.\" \ue02chttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning\ue02e; July 9, 2008). 65 Webster's College Dictionary, 1992 Edition (from Webster's College Dictionary by random House, Inc. Copyright 1995, 1992, 1991 by random House, Inc. reprinted by permission of random House, Inc., New york, 1992). rr Sometimes an emergency management plan is referred to as a prefire plan or emergency action plan. The latter is used by the NFPA and is defined as \"designated actions that employers, employees, and other building occupants should take to ensure they are safe from fire and other emergencies\" (NFPA. \"The objective of an [emergency management plan] should be to allow those responsible for the [facility] during an emergency to focus on the solution of major problems, not to attempt immediately to bring order out of chaos. If all predictable and routine items are considered in the plan, those responsible for actions during an emergency will be able to deal with the unpredictable or unusual situations that will surely develop.\" 67 According to Groner,\n\nThe chaotic and dynamic nature of building emergencies requires an exceedingly rapid assessment of the situation. The timeframe is measured in seconds and minutes, not hours and days. The rapid onset of many events means that the process should be well underway before emergency responders arrive at the building. Human factors professionals have been actively researching this problem under the generally accepted term of \"situation awareness.\" Endsley (1988) has provided a well-accepted definition: \"The perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning and the projection of their status in the near future.\" 68 As noted in the definition, it is insufficient to understand the momentary status of the situation; projecting its development is of great importance in choosing a strategy to safeguard building occupants. r\n\nThe purpose of an emergency management plan is to help hotel emergency staff in their efforts to achieve situation awareness and make sound decisions to provide for the safety of hotel guests and patrons during building emergencies, such as fire.\n\nThe value of emergency planning is not only the emergency management plan itself but also in the development process leading to it and the education of hotel emergency staff that should occur in the process. \n\nThe building emergency management plan r in Appendix 9-2 (which is on the CD-rOM provided with this book) is a suggested format for developing an emergency management plan for an office building. It includes actions intended to reduce the threat to the life safety of building occupants from emergencies, both fire and non-fire-related, that are likely to occur in a specific building, or in close proximity to it, until the arrival of emergency responders. A hotel could adopt such an emergency plan as part of its effort to develop its own building emergency management plan. However, several critical differences-building emergency staff organization, occupant documentation and training, and evacuation drills-need to be taken into account.\n\nThe building emergency staff organization that will carry out emergency response procedures for a hotel differs from that of an office building. The most obvious difference is that hotels do not have floor response personnel such as floor wardens, stairwell monitors, elevator monitors, search monitors, and disabled/physically impaired assistance monitors. The responsibility for overseeing the safe and orderly evacuation of occupants from a hotel floor resides with hotel staff, including hotel management, security, engineering, and possibly housekeeping staff (the personnel involved will vary according to the size of the hotel, its staffing capabilities, and the time of day or night).\n\nA typical staff organization rr for a high-rise hotel is outlined in Figure 10 -1. This sample depicts the fire safety director as reporting to hotel management. However, it is noted that the authority that has jurisdiction in many cities empowers the fire safety director with full authority to evacuate a building without the need to obtain approval from hotel owners or managers. each unit of the building emergency staff organization has duties and responsibilities that have been developed and tailored to the specific needs of the hotel and to each type of emergency they may be required to handle. These duties and responsibilities should be defined clearly so that there will be a coordinated and effective response to each emergency situation. For example, the duties and responsibilities of hotel management, the building fire safety director, rrr and the hotel engineering and security staff rrrr in handling a fire emergency include ensuring that the fire department has been immediately notified, all occupants (including guests and patrons) in the affected area have been advised of the situation, any necessary evacuation procedures of occupants r The emergency management plan presented here addresses preparedness and emergency response but does not address business continuity. rr Terminology for the emergency staff organization units and members may vary, and some facilities may designate additional team members (such as a building evacuation supervisor, an emergency coordinator, emergency evacuation teams, a crowd manager, and first aid officers).\n\nrrr Smaller hotels may not formally refer to a fire safety director. The responsibility for coordinating the hotel's fire life safety program, including emergency response procedures, will reside with the hotel manager on duty at the time of an incident. rrrr In addition, building parking staff may be called on to assist in the evacuation of occupants from parking areas. Housekeeping and cleaning staff may be required to clean up areas after the occurrence of water leaks, liquid spills, and water discharged from sprinklers. has begun, a thorough search is made of all affected guest rooms, r fire life safety systems are operating under emergency conditions, any investigation or initial suppression of the fire is carried out, and that the fire department and other responding personnel are met on arrival and briefed on the status of the situation. In contrast, during a bomb threat incident, these personnel may be involved in supervising the evacuation of occupants and checking areas, including common areas and guest rooms, where an explosive device may have been placed. In a medical incident, security staff, depending on the hotel's policy and the type of situation, may be required to administer CPr, an AeD (automated external defibrillator), or basic first aid before the emergency medical responders arrive.\n\n\"Since hotel guests are [primarily] transients, special consideration must be given to the potential threat to their life safety from fire. For example, occupants of the residential portion of a hotel sleep in unfamiliar surroundings and could possibly become disoriented when trying to evacuate under heavy smoke conditions. likewise, persons in ballrooms, lounges, [casinos,] and restaurants could become disoriented due to low-level r Guests may be asleep at any time of the day. Also, they may be in a deep sleep due to the use of alcohol, sleeping pills, or other substances and may require help to evacuate. Others, such as disabled/physically impaired persons, may need assistance. \"emergency evacuation of people with disabilities is a primary concern for security personnel. This is a matter that must be reviewed with local fire authorities. In the event of a fire, the fire department may prefer that they be met by a [hotel] staff member with a full list of disabled persons on the property and their locations\" (ellis Jr rC, Stipanuk DM. Security and Loss Prevention Management. 2nd ed. lansing, MI: educational Institute of the American Hotel & Motel Association; 1999:245). On checking into the hotel, guests may communicate the nature of any such disability or physical impairment to the reception desk staff. This information can be noted in the guest's folio or other document so it is readily available, particularly during an emergency. Also, the authority that has jurisdiction may have special requirements for accommodating disabled/physically impaired guests. lighting, crowd size, and unfamiliarity with evacuation routes.\" 69 The training of hotel occupants in fire life safety procedures is very different for a hotel than that of office building occupants. Apart from verbal instructions that can be given by meeting organizers at the commencement of a gathering in a function, a meeting room, or a conference center, primarily hotel management relies on documentation and exit signage to communicate safety messages to its guests and visitors. Security and safety information-including basic security and fire life safety tipscan be provided as follows:\n\nl When a guest checks in to the hotel (for example, printed on the paper folder containing the room key or keycard; some hotels include a statement that \"upon arrival please notify the Front Desk if you require special evacuation assistance in the event of an emergency\"). 70 l Contained in a guest information book or a brochure provided in the guest room. Written on decals (for example, those adhered to sliding glass doors rr above the locking mechanism to remind guests to lock the door when sleeping or leaving the room; those warning guests not to place a clothing hanger on any sidewall sprinkler head and thus avoiding damaging it and causing an accidental discharge of water in the room; and \"NO SMOKING SIGNS\" sometimes posted in guest rooms, particularly on room balconies). l Displayed on the guest room door equipped with a conventional door viewer with a printed sign warning the guest to view the caller before opening the door. l Displayed on in-car elevator video screens. Such elevator bulletins may, for example, provide information that reminds occupants that in the event the elevator stops running, they should immediately use the elevator emergency communication device to request assistance; or they may be used to post other appropriate emergency notifications. 69 Bell Jr. Hotels. In: Fire Protection Handbook. 18th ed. Quincy, MA: National Fire Protection Association; 1997:9-64. 70 The need to secure windows and sliding doors on outside patios and terraces is more critical on ground floor guest rooms, particularly those facing open parking lots.\n\nStatements \u2666 of appropriate local, city and state laws applicable to hotel owners and operators for the loss of guest's personal property. Such statements may include the following details:\n\nMonetary limits of liability (often called \"innkeeper liability\" \u2666\u2666 ) for the loss through damage, destruction, theft or otherwise of guest belongings (such as suitcases, trunks, hand luggage, or traveling bags) and the contents within, including a clause that specifies that unless there is a written statement from the hotel owner or operator agreeing to assume greater liability this will apply to all other kinds of personal property in the guest's possession.\n\nInformation that a guest in-room safe or a safe deposit box is available and that the hotel will not be liable for any personal items (such as money, credit cards, jewelry, documents, airline tickets, clothing, laptop computers or other items of considerable value), unless they are placed in the provided safe or safe deposit box. In addition, there may be an innkeeper liability statement as to the monetary limits of liability for the loss of the aforementioned items when secured in the safe or safe deposit box, including a clause that specifies that unless there is a written statement from the hotel owner or operator agreeing to assume greater liability, this will apply to all these items so stored.\n\nThere may also be a statement as to the rights of the hotel owner or operator to seize the guest's property, including baggage, and other items under the guest's control, if the guest fails to pay their room bill including guest services provided, and the conditions under which the hotel owner or operator may sell these items.\n\nThe room's maximum occupancy may also be stated here.\n\nClose guest room door and engage the deadbolt lock and the security latch or the safety chain. Check that any doors to connecting rooms are locked.\n\nUse door viewer to identify anyone seeking entry. Never open door for someone unknown to you. If in doubt of a person's identity, contact the hotel operator.\n\nSecure valuables using the guest in-room safe or the safe deposit box available at the main reception desk.\n\nWhen leaving room, make sure any exterior sliding glass doors and windows are closed and locked and your hotel room door is fully closed and locked.\n\nKeep room key or access card always with you.\n\nUpon arrival in your room, note where each nearest fire exit is located on your floor. If you discover fire or smoke, notify anyone in the immediate area of danger and telephone the hotel operator (or first call the fire department emergency number and then notify the operator) to report the situation.\n\nWhen leaving your room, before opening the door, feel it with the back of your hand to ensure it is not hot because of a fire behind it. If it is warm, do not open it. If the door is cool, open it slowly and close it immediately if smoke or heat is encountered. If safe to leave, take your room key or card with you, close the door, and proceed to the nearest safe stairwell. If you encounter smoke on entering a stairwell, proceed to an alternate safe stairwell. Always close the stairwell door after you enter it. \u2666\u2666\u2666 DO NOT USE ELEVATORS.\n\nIf there is heavy smoke in the corridor outside your room and you cannot evacuate, seal the bottom of the guest room door with towels, sheets or blankets, and notify the hotel operator of your situation. If breathing becomes difficult, and smoke is not present outside, open any windows or sliding glass doors leading outside to a balcony. Some guests, as a fire life safety precaution, on first arriving at their hotel room immediately familiarize themselves by walking to the emergency exits on their floor, in particular noting the route leading to the nearest fire exit. Guests can also play an important part in any hotel life safety program by promptly reporting things such as suspicious persons or activities, safety hazards, or the smell of smoke to hotel management and security staff. exit signage (as described in Chapter 6) is also a critical part of the life safety program for hotel occupants. This includes floor evacuation plans that show the building core, perimeter, stairwells, elevators, every wall that faces every exit route, exit routes to the appropriate stairwells, symbols depicting the location of fire equipment and manual fire alarm devices, the floor number, fire department and hotel emergency telephone numbers, what stairwells have roof access, and what the fire alarm looks and sounds like.\n\nCall the hotel operator (or call the paramedic/emergency services emergency number and then notify the operator), stating the nature of the emergency and the room number or the location.\n\nIf properly trained, assist the victim, but do not move the victim unless there is danger of additional, more serious injury. There may also be a written advisement to the guest that if they have any questions regarding security or fire life safety issues they should contact the hotel operator. rr \"The matter of limiting innkeepers' liability goes far back in law. A cap on what an innkeeper must pay if travelers lose their belongings came about to protect those who provided shelter to people on the road-a desirable situation in the view of public policy-from being put out of business by visitors who sued after being robbed on the premises. In the united States, every state and territory has a law limiting this liability, and each state requires that notices of this be posted in a particular way\u2026. Many of these limits were set in the last century, and inflation has made them out of date. In the last five years, some legislatures have been pushed by consumers into raising the limits\" (Practical Traveler; How Safe Is the Hotel Safe? New York Times log, by Betsey Wade. March 14, 1999. \ue02chttp://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec\ue035travel&res\ue0359B0De FDD103FF937A25750C0A96F958260\ue02e; October 17, 2008). rrr See \"evacuation Guidelines\" in Appendix 9-3 for other possible items to include in this section. \n\nHotels can utilize evacuation drills r -commonly called fire drills-to train, instruct, reinforce, and test the preparedness of the hotel emergency staff, but due to the nature of hotel operations, they do not use this training tool for hotel occupants. This adds further weight to the absolute necessity for hotel staff to be always ready to react to an emergency in a competent and professional manner according to predetermined guidelines specified in the hotel's Building emergency Procedures Manual.\n\nIt is important that as many as possible of those who will be involved in the execution of the emergency management plan participate in the planning process. Those concerned should include the emergency staff of the hotel, the hotel safety committee, rr and possibly public officials (such as those from the local fire and law enforcement agencies) and building management staff from neighboring buildings (with the view to developing mutual aid agreements). rrr Public officials may require a particular format for the plan itself.\n\nIt cannot be stressed enough that the sample format for developing a hotel's Building emergency Procedures Manual is provided as an example of how a hotel may prepare its plan. every site and hotel building is different, and emergency plans vary according to local laws and the requirements of the authority that has jurisdiction. It is up to each hotel to develop the emergency management plan most appropriate to its needs. rrr A mutual aid agreement is \"a pre-arranged agreement developed between two or more entities to render assistance to the parties of the agreement\" (ASIS Business Continuity Guideline. Alexandria, VA: ASIS International; January 2005:8).\n\nrr Some hotels, particularly major ones, have a safety committee that meets on a regular basis. According to the Safety Committees for the Real World,\n\nThe purpose of a safety committee is to bring workers and managers together to achieve and maintain a safe, healthful workplace\u2026. An example of a written safety committee policy is:\n\nThis safety committee was established to assist the company in achieving a safe, healthful workplace. The committee, through its representatives, will set specific goals to accomplish the following activities: :1, 14) . Some members of such a committee may be involved in the emergency management planning process for the hotel. r A drill is defined by the NFPA. Glossary of Terms, National Fire Code, as \"an exercise involving a credible simulated emergency that requires personnel to perform emergency response operations for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of the training and education programs and the competence of personnel in performing required response duties and functions\" (National Fire Protection Association, Quincy, MA. Copyright 2005). A fire drill is such an exercise for a simulated fire emergency.
