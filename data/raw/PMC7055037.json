{"title": "Differential diagnosis of illness in patients under investigation for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), Italy, February 2020", "body": "The diagnostic algorithm adopted by the Laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 testing included, immediately upon sample receipt, a rapid molecular test for the most common respiratory pathogens in order to obtain a fast differential diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 testing was based on the protocol released by the World Health Organization (WHO) [13], and three positive patients have been identified at the time of writing this paper. \n\nThe 126 patients were considered suspected cases on the basis of information collected on clinical and epidemiological grounds, i.e. suspicion of a viral aetiology, recent travel history to Asia, or contact with a probable or confirmed case, according to WHO guidelines [14]. They included 64 male and 62 female cases, 52 were Italian citizens, 64 Chinese and six had other nationalities. The mean age was 35 years (range: 1\u201385 years).\n\nNasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from 54 patients hospitalised in the high isolation facility at the INMI in Rome, nine patients from other hospitals in the Lazio Region and a further 63 cases referred to the INMI Laboratory of Virology from different regions of Italy (Figure).\n\nRapid differential diagnosis was based on the QIAstat-Dx respiratory panel (QIAGEN, Milan, Italy); this system uses a single-use cartridge that includes all reagents needed for nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection of the most common bacteria and viruses causing respiratory syndromes: adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E), coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV HKU1), coronavirus NL63 (HCoV NL63), coronavirus OC43 (HCoV OC43), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza A, influenza A subtype H1N1/pdm09 influenza A subtypes H1 and H3, influenza B, parainfluenza virus 1\u20132-3\u20134 (PIV 1\u20134), respiratory syncytial virus A/B (RSV A/B), rhinovirus/enterovirus, (HRV/EV), Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Results were available 70\u201390 min after sample receipt. The results considered in the analysis include those from 109 suspected cases undergoing rapid molecular testing at the Reference Laboratory, and those from 17 patients tested at the laboratory of origin (either with the rapid respiratory panel or with other methods).\n\nAmong the first 126 patients evaluated at the reference Laboratory at INMI, only three were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and none of those three was co-infected with other pathogens (Table).\n\nOverall, 67 (53.2%) of the patients resulted positive for respiratory pathogen(s) other than SARS-CoV-2. Influenza viruses represented the majority of positive findings, influenza A accounting for 26 (20.6%) and influenza B accounting for 10 (7.9%) of all single infections. Other viruses were represented as well (Table). As far as bacterial infections are concerned, M. pneumoniae was detected in five patients (4.0%), while L. pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae (the positive result for S. pneumoniae was referred by the laboratory origin), were found only in one patient (0.8%). Mixed infections were also observed in a small number of cases (Table).\n\nOur results highlight the importance of differential diagnosis in travellers arriving from countries with widespread occurrence of COVID-19, considering the similarity of symptoms shared with more common respiratory infections, such as influenza and other respiratory tract diseases.\n\nBroad screening for respiratory pathogens revealed a high rate of influenza virus infections, accounting for 28.5% of all suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection; this is consistent with the fact that we are the middle of the seasonal influenza epidemic period. Notably, rapid influenza diagnosis facilitates timely administration of antiviral therapy, thus reducing severity and length of the disease and use of unnecessary antibiotics.\n\nOur results highlight the importance of using a broad-spectrum molecular diagnostic panel for rapid detection of the most common respiratory pathogens, in order to improve evaluation and clinical management of patients with respiratory syndrome consistent with COVID-19. This is important in an epidemiological situation with low circulation of SARS-CoV-2, where alternative diagnoses may clarify an individual patient\u2019s risk and may allow adjusting public health containment measures. Nevertheless, it is mandatory to maintain high level of attention with respect to this new emergent pathogen and health authorities should remain vigilant, increasing their capacity for surveillance and constantly reviewing their pandemic preparedness plans."}
