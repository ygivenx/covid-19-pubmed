{"title": "Highly Efficient and Practical N-Heterocyclic\nCarbene Organocatalyzed Chemoselective N1/C3-Functionalization of Isatins with Green Chemistry Principles", "body": "Isatin is not only\na privileged core structure of versatile natural\nproducts, but also a very useful starting material of indole-containing\nbiologically active molecules because of the presence of various functionalizable\ngroups (Figure 1).1\u22126 Specifically, this potential has been realized in designing useful\ndrug scaffolds for emerging targets (e.g., chymotrypsin-like protease,\nNrf2) as well as well-known targets binding to neurotransmitters or\ntheir precursors (e.g., MAO, CB2).7\u221210 However, when compared with the powerful\nutility of isatin, it seems that efficiently controlled introduction\nof functional groups into isatin has not been reported enough. Even\nthough reactive isatins prefer nucleophilic additions at the C3-position,11\u221217 the control of N1- and C3-functionalization\nhas been tried by various synthetic strategies (N-alkylation,18\u221221 N-acylation,22,23 N-carbamoylation,24 N-Mannich reaction,25,26 and aza-Michael addition reaction27\u221234). Despite reports, efficient chemoselective N1-functionalization\nof isatin is still difficult because of the undesired reactions resulting\nfrom the multifunctionality of isatins. The first undesired side reaction\nin the functionalization of isatins is the decomposition of isatins\ninto isatinates.35\u221237\n\nThe second undesired reaction is products resulting from\nthe failure\nof the chemoselectivity (C3- vs N1-site). Any\norganic or inorganic base in an optimized method could not show consistent\nproducts in diverse isatin derivatives and electrophiles. For example,\n1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)/tetrabutylammonium bromide of\ncatalytic amount could only be applicable to Schiff imine protection\nof isatins for aza-Michael product (N1-functionalization).28 In N-unprotected isatins, DABCO is a more efficient\nbase for Morita\u2013Baylis\u2013Hillman (MBH) reaction (C3-functionalization) rather than aza-Michael reaction (N1-functionalization).16,17 Hence, surely C3-protecting groups of isatins (e.g. ketal,18,21 Schiff imine,28\u221231 thioketal32) have been developed. Notably,\naza-Michael reaction of Kanger group\u2019s isatin Schiff imine\nare only applicable for fumarate derivatives as Michael acceptors,28\u221230 and ketal/thioketal shows a loss of isatins as well as a high E-factor\n(low atom economy) through protection/reaction/deprotection procedures\n(Supporting Information).21,32 Recently, aza-Michael addition of isatins without any C3-protecting group27,33,34 made us to expect efficient direct N1-functionalization\nto be more considerable in view of green chemistry (E-factor, atom\neconomy, and step economy). Kinetics of the saponification depend\non the pH of reactions so that a stoichiometric inorganic base can\nresult in the saponification of the aza-Michael products as well as\nisatins (Supporting Information).27,35 Aza-Michael reaction in imidazolium ionic liquids was applicable\nonly for fumarate derivatives as Michael acceptors in spite of a high\nexpenditure of the ionic liquid.33 Remarkably,\nPace group\u2019s N1-functionalization could show a powerful\nadvance, but the recyclable KF\u2013Celite mediation required more\nthan the stoichiometric amount as well as a long time reflux (ca.\n12 h) for efficient aza-Michael reaction.34\n\nIn this study, we investigated neither the stoichiometric\ncondition\nnor the heating energy required for chemoselective N1-functionalization\nof isatins. Therefore, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis\nwas a reasonable method based on (1) the extrapolated reactivity between\nactivated olefins and NHCs from the literature38\u221248 and (2) mild condition escaping saponification.42,43 The stabilized sp2-hybridized lone-pair electrons of NHCs\nmake C2-carbene highly nucleophilic with the basicity (pKa: 20\u201328 in tetrahydrofuran (THF))51 and its precatalysts have the advantages (readily available,\ncheap, less toxic than metal catalysts, easy to synthesize, and recyclable)\nrequired for green catalysis.42,43 NHCs and imidazolium\nsalts, conjugated acids of NHCs, can play powerful roles in Lewis/Br\u00f8nsted\nbase catalysis, and can facilitate various reactive species (e.g.\nacyl anions, homoenolates, acylvinyl anions, and enolates) for synthesizing\na versatile compound collection.42\u221250 Although the concept of NHC-catalyzed Michael addition exists,38\u221241 the scope of the nucleophile was limited to primary amines,38 1,3-dicarbonyls,39,40 and thiols41 but not for amides, especially not for isatins.\nHerein, we report the efficient NHC-organocatalyzed chemoselective\naza-Michael addition of N-unsubstituted (NUS)-isatins for synthesizing\nN-substituted (NS)-isatins (N1-functionalization) in the\nabsence of (1) a protecting group, (2) a stoichiometric reagent, and\n(3) heating energy. The usefulness of the aza-Michael adducts can\nbe reinforced with the subsequent MBH reaction of as-synthesized NS-isatins\n(N1/C3-functionalization) and the reverse synthesis\n(C3/N1-functionalization) to construct versatile\nisatins as a drug library.\n\nInitially,\nthe aza-Michael reaction of isatin 1a with\nmethyl acrylate 2a (1:1.2 ratios) was investigated in\nthe presence of 10 mol % of the organo-NHC precatalyst, 1,3-dimesitylimidazolium\nchloride (IMes\u00b7Cl), in combination with various organic and inorganic\nbases in different solvents to optimize the catalytic conditions.\nAcrylates were used in slight excess (1.2 equiv) because of their\nvolatile nature. The detailed reaction conditions and results are\npresented in Table 1. For the preliminary study, base condition of the reaction was investigated\nin the presence of the IMes\u00b7Cl precatalyst in the selected solvent,\ndichloromethane (entries 1\u20136). The intended roles of the inorganic/organic\nbase are (a) to generate in situ organo-NHCs from IMes\u00b7Cl and\n(b) to assist the organo-NHC catalyst-directed path in the aza-Michael\nreaction. The combination of the IMes\u00b7Cl precatalyst with relatively\nmild inorganic/organic bases (Et3N or K2CO3 or 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)) resulted in\na highly chemoselective aza-Michael addition in dichloromethane (DCM)\nto produce NS-isatin 3aa as the sole product (entries\n3\u20135). On the other hand, the combination of IMes\u00b7Cl with\nthe strong bases KOt-Bu and NaH resulted in the formation\nof 3aa along with other unidentified products (entries\n1 and 2). The best result was observed under the IMes\u00b7Cl/DBU\ncondition with high chemoselectivity and the maximum yield of 81%\n(entry 5). Surprisingly, in contrast to other entries, IMes\u00b7Cl/DABCO\nproduced a MBH product from 1a and 2a (entry\n6). Because DABCO is a weaker base than DBU in terms of pKa (pKa values of their conjugated\nacid in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): Et3N\u2013H+ pKa \u223c 18.82, DBU\u2013H+ pKa \u223c 24.34, and DABCO\u2013H+ pKa \u223c 8.9),52 it is not sufficient for capturing the NH proton\nof isatin, but sufficient for mediating the MBH reaction. Under the\noptimal condition of entry 5, we also compared the catalytic efficacy\nof four well-known organo-NHC precatalysts (entries 5, 7\u20139)\nto prove that NHC catalysis can produce chemoselective aza-Michael\nadducts consistently.\n\nTo enhance the performance of entry\n5, we studied the solvent effect\nin sequence. No considerable improvement was observed in the solvents\nMeOH, EtOH, CH3CN, and CHCl3 in either the reaction\ntime or the yield of 3aa (entries 10\u201313). In the\ncase of the THF solvent, the IMes\u00b7Cl (A) is sparingly soluble\nin the solvent to present a very low yield (entry 14). At this juncture,\nwe tried to add a catalytic amount of more polar solvent DMSO to the\nIMes\u00b7Cl/DBU system to improve the solubility and the reaction\nrate with the related reports of Arduengo and others.53,54 The white turbid THF solution containing IMes\u00b7Cl/DBU (Figure 2a) became a clear,\nlight yellow solution immediately on the addition of DMSO (Figure 2b), which indicates\nthe fast generation of in situ organo-NHC. A further quick change\nin color from yellow to wine red was observed upon successive addition\nof 1a after 2a (Figure 2c,d) with the supposition on the proton loss\n(N\u2013H) of 1a during aza-Michael addition. Therefore,\nthe click-type rapid chemoselective aza-Michael addition took place\nbetween 1a and 2a in less than 1 min at\nRT to provide a 93% yield of 3aa (entry 15).\n\nNext, with the impressive reaction time and yield, the efficiency\nand reaction scope of our optimized reaction was investigated. First,\nthe loading amount of catalysts was only modified under the optimized\ncondition (entry 16). Under the condition of 5 mol % of NHC and 5\nmol % of DBU, the product 3aa was acquired with a slightly\nreduced isolation yield and elongated reaction time (67%, 60 min),\nshowing the importance of the catalyst loading scale. It is worth\nnoting that this catalytic system could catalyze the same reaction\neven at 0 \u00b0C (entry 17). In addition, we attempted a one-pot\nsynthesis of the aza-Michael reaction followed by the MBH reaction.\nThe NHC catalyst activity was tested after completion of the aza-Michael\naddition in the reaction mixture. The reaction between 1a (1 equiv) and 2a (1.2 equiv) was conducted with the\n10 mol % NHC/DBU catalyst system. After 1 min, 1a was\ncompletely converted to 3aa, whereupon one more equivalence\nof 2a (1.2 equiv) was added to the reaction mixture.\nSurprisingly, 5aa was formed with a low yield (entry\n18). An additional reaction was initiated with 1a (1\nequiv) and 2a (2.5 equiv), under the 10 mol % NHC/DBU\ncatalyst condition. In this reaction, 3aa, 4aa, and 5aa were observed with different ratios at the\nstart of the reaction; after 1 h, 5aa was detected along\nwith 3aa (entry 19). Additional reactions were conducted\nwith 30 mol % of DBU or DABCO without the NHC catalyst (entries 20\u201322).\nWhen DABCO was used as a catalyst, only the MBH product was observed\n(63% yield after 8 h, entry 22). In further studies, well-known organic\nbase/catalyst (4-dimethylaminopyridine, DMAP) and chiral organocatalysts\n(l-proline and cinchonine) were tested in the reaction (entries\n23\u201326). When compared with the organo-NHC catalysis, they showed\ninsufficiency and limited yields, proving the efficiency of NHC among\norganocatalysts.\n\nUnder the optimized reaction condition (entry\n15, Table 1), the substrate scope of our reaction was further\ninvestigated\n(Table 2). We tested\nsubstrates bearing electron-rich substituents such as 5-Me (adducts 3ba, 3bb, 3bc) as well as moderately\nelectron-withdrawing substituents such as 5-Cl (adducts 3da, 3db, 3dc), 5-Br (adducts 3ea, 3eb, 3ec), and 5-I (adducts 3ca, 3cb, 3cc) to verify the compatibility\nof substrates (up to 98%; reaction time = 1\u201310 min). In the\nscope of Michael acceptors, the less reactive Michael acceptor, tert-butyl acrylate, was tolerable in our methodology (adducts 3ac, 3bc, 3cc, 3dc,\nand 3ec).\n\nThe promising results of Table 2 encouraged us to further explore the scope\nof the\naza-Michael addition reaction by using various terminal and nonterminal\ndouble-bond Michael acceptors with isatin as depicted in Table 3. Concretely, the\noptimal reaction condition is applicable to a wide range of Michael\nacceptors like acrylonitrile 2d, phenyl vinyl sulfone 2e, methyl vinyl ketone 2f, methyl methacrylate 2g, ethyl 4-oxo-4-phenyl-2-butenoate 2h, and\nethyl crotonate 2i. However, when 2d and 2e were used as Michael acceptors, the same results were observed\n(like acrylates). When 2f was used as a Michael acceptor\nat RT, 1a was consumed completely, but the yield of the\nproduct was very low. After a number of unsuccessful attempts, we\nfinally found that the aza-Michael addition with 2f would\nproceed smoothly at \u221210 \u00b0C. We then conducted the reaction\nat \u221210 \u00b0C, and changing the addition pattern of DMSO (along\nwith isatin addition) improved the yield of 3af to 85%\nwithin 15 min. When methyl-substituted double-bond 2g and 2i were used as Michael acceptors, an increase in time and a trace\namount of tryptanthrin 6a were detected. To our delight,\nin the absence of a Michael acceptor, the corresponding isatin was\nconveniently converted to the tryptanthrin 6a under the\ndesignated condition (Table 3).\n\nIn sequence, the catalytic suitability of the nucleophilic\norgano-NHCs\nwas further examined for the MBH reaction of the as-synthesized aza-Michael\nproducts in Table 4. To observe the N-substituent effect on the substrates, we selected\n(i) NS-isatin 3aa and (ii) NS-isatin 3ad with activated olefins (methyl acrylate 2a and acrylonitrile 2d), respectively, in the presence of IMes\u00b7Cl/DBU and\nIMes\u00b7Cl/DABCO precatalyst systems under various solvent conditions.\nBecause in situ generation of free organo-NHC is very fast under the\nTHF/DMSO condition, it was supposed that acrylates undergo dimerization\nand other side reactions to result in a lower conversion and low yield\n(Table 1, entries 18\nand 19).55,56 To escape the condition, MBH reactions were\nfirst tested in THF. In 10 mol % IMes\u00b7Cl/bases, DBU and DABCO\ndeprotonated the IMes\u00b7Cl and generated the organo-NHC in situ.\nAlthough MBH reactions in the presence of IMes\u00b7Cl/DBU showed\nmaximum conversion of the substrates by thin-layer chromatography\n(TLC) detection (entries 1 and 7), they could not produce a sole MBH\nproduct. On the other hand, the MBH reactions in the presence of IMes\u00b7Cl/DABCO\nshowed clear and major MBH products to reveal the compatibility and\nsuitability regardless of the N-substituent (entries 2, 8 and 9).\nWhen compared with the NHC catalytic condition, a catalytic base without\nNHC did not result in isolable quantities of MBH products in spite\nof the substrate consumption (entries 3 and 4). The increased equivalence\nof bases (30 mol %) could slightly enhance MBH products, but presented\ninsufficient efficiency in both the reaction time and yield (entries\n5 and 6).\n\nIt is also emphasized in the literature\nthat polar organic solvents\nor aqueous\u2013organic mixed-solvent media can accelerate the MBH\nreaction by activating the substrates through noncovalent bonding\ninteractions, including hydrogen bonding and an increase of the equilibrium\nconstant toward a zwitterionic intermediate;57,58 water or aqueous\u2013organic solvent media are also more promising\nsolvent conditions for NHC-catalyzed reactions.59\u221261 In this context,\nthe MBH reaction was studied in pure 1,4-dioxane, CH3CN,\nMeOH, and DMF in the presence of IMes\u00b7Cl/DABCO (entries 10\u201313);\nhowever, no appreciable change was observed in the corresponding MBH\nproduct yields and reaction times. In light of the above patterns,\nthe MBH reaction was further studied in various mixed aqueous\u2013organic\nsolvent media (THF/H2O, MeOH/H2O, CH3CN/H2O, 1,4-dioxane/H2O, and DMF/H2O). To our delight, the mixed aqueous\u2013organic solvent media\nproduced higher yields of MBH products than a single polar solvent\n(entries 14\u201319). The 1,4-dioxane/H2O (1:1) conditions\nwere the most promising and afforded an excellent yield of 97% within\n5 min without purification by column chromatography (entry 17). The\ndetails of the derivatives of the MBH reaction in 1,4-dioxane/H2O have also been depicted in Table 5 (Route A). In addition, the optimal result\ndid not require column chromatography, but needed only the removal\nof the NHC and DABCO with solvent washing and recrystallization with\nethanol to give the desired pure products at an excellent yield.\n\nLastly, the reverse reaction of the aza-Michael/MBH\nreaction (C\u2013C\nbond formation via MBH reaction and then C\u2013N bond formation\nvia aza-Michael addition between activated olefins and NUS-isatins)\nalso was considered to highlight the suitability and generality of\nNHC/DABCO-catalyzed MBH reaction and NHC/DBU-catalyzed aza-Michael\naddition. In this context, IMes\u00b7Cl/DABCO-catalyzed MBH reactions\nof isatin 1a with acrylate 2a and acrylonitrile 2d in 1,4-dioxane/H2O at RT were accomplished smoothly\nand produced selectively the corresponding MBH adducts with excellent\nyields (Scheme 1).\n\nThe MBH adducts 4aa and 4ad can be used\npromptly for the IMes\u00b7Cl/DBU-catalyzed aza-Michael addition as\ndescribed in Route-B of Table 5. As with aza-Michael of NUS-isatins in Table 1, a catalytic amount of DMSO added to THF\ncan accelerate the generation of in situ organo-NHC from IMes\u00b7Cl\nin the reaction of the MBH adducts. All of the five aza-Michael addition\nreactions with isolation yields of up to 91% were accomplished efficiently\nin the presence of the NHC/DBU catalytic system within 1 h (Table 5). When compared with\naza-Michael of the as-synthesized MBH products (Route B), MBH reaction\nof the as-synthesized aza-Michael products (Route A) was more efficient\nin both time and yield. Details of the derivatives have also been\ndepicted in Table 5. The study can be an alternative strategy for efficient diversification\nof N1- and C3-functionalized isatin libraries.\n\nUnder the optimal organo-NHC/DBU catalysis condition, we derive\na plausible mechanism for the chemoselective aza-Michael addition\nreaction as shown in Scheme 2 (path A). At first, the in situ-generated organo-NHC attacks\nthe \u03b2-carbon of the acrylate to form a zwitterionic homoenolate I. Now, this homoenolate I captures a proton\nfrom the conjugate acid (DBU\u2013H+) of DBU62 and forms intermediate III. Simultaneously,\nDBU captures the amine proton of isatin and triggers the chemoselective\naza-Michael addition to form the NS-isatin. Under the optimized NHC/DABCO\nconditions, our plausible catalytic cycle proposed for the MBH reaction\nis described in path B (Scheme 2). The nucleophilic addition of acrylate with in situ-generated\norgano-NHC by the treatment of a DABCO base produced a zwitterionic\nhomoenolate I, whereas this homoenolate I did not capture a proton from the conjugate acid (DABCO\u2013H+) because of the low Lewis basicity of DABCO compared with\nDBU.63 At this time, the nucleophilic attack\nof the NHC acrylate zwitterionic species I to the electrophilic\nC3-keto carbonyl site of NS-isatin forms the second zwitterionic\nspecies V followed by proton transfer toward the elimination\nof free-NHC to form the aza-Michael\u2013Baylis-oxindole derivative VI.\n\nFurthermore, our methodology could apply to aldol-type\ncondensation\nbetween NUS-isatin 1a and nonterminal double-bond ethyl\ndiazoacetate (EDA) 2j to produce \u03b1-diazo-\u03b2-hydroxy\nester 7aj as an important precursor for diverse products\n(Scheme 3).64 The product formation via the NHC/DBU catalyst\nsystem can support that the possibility of proton transfer from the\nconjugate acid (DBU\u2013H+) in aza-Michael addition\n(Scheme 2, path A).\n\nIn view of the green chemistry, our\nmethodology is compared with\nreported methodologies constructing isatin derivatives in Supporting Table 1. First, our method presented\nan efficient E-factor among the 13 methods in previous reports and\n100% atom economy from the starting material to the product. Second, THF as the major solvent in our methodology showed low- or\nmiddle-range scores in the scoring information of the solvent elicited\nfrom the ACS GCI pharmaceutical roundtable, which consists of safety,\nhealth, air environment, water environment, and waste categories.\nThird, our method (within 15 min at ambient temperature) could show\ncomparative advantage in energy consumption and accident prevention.\nFourth, our catalysis condition showed an impressive difference in\nthe loading amount and did not require a protecting group (additional\nprotection/deprotection steps). With the mentioned\nmerits, the most outstanding advantage of our methodology over the\n13 reported methods in the factors of green chemistry was that only\nour method used a renewable catalyst between different batches (Supporting Information).65 Finally, our method permitted efficient and environment-friendly\npurification through simple recrystallization after the reaction.\n\nOur designed NHC/base system could efficiently control the chemoselectivity\nof unprotected isatin through a selective aza-Micheal or MBH reaction.\nIn particular, the respective roles of the solvent, base, and substituents\non the substrates in optimizing both aza-Michael and MBH reactions\nwere assessed. However, in the absence of the organo-NHC (DBU alone),\nthe reaction lost chemoselective control, became sluggish, and produced\na mixture of aza-Michael and Morita\u2013Baylis\u2013Hillman (MBH)\nadducts. In addition, the optimal design of the two NHC-catalyzed\nreactions (aza-Michael/MBH or MBH/aza-Michael as a compensatory reverse)\nmade \u201cthe sequenced introduction of two different three-carbon\nfunctionalities\u201d feasible. Our methodology can be applied to\nthe synthesis of novel and distinctively N1- and C3- functionalized isatin libraries showing variations in steric\nand electronic properties; the salient features of this procedure are a short reaction time,\ngood product yields, and that it does not require column chromatography\nfor purification. In particular, MBH products are purified through\nsimple recrystallization techniques with a high atom economy. It also\nis a very promising method in view of 12 factors of green chemistry.\n\nA dried round-bottomed\nflask was charged with IMes\u00b7Cl salt (10\nmol %) and DBU (10 mol %) in dry THF (1 mL) under an N2 atmosphere. To this, addition of DMSO (0.1 mL), acrylate/acrylonitrile\n(1.2 mmol), and dropwise addition of N-unsubstituted 2-oxindole (1\nmmol) solution in dry THF (1 mL) at room temperature by using a syringe\nwere carried out.

Although our method was developed\nat a bench-top scale, it could be scaled up to the process chemistry\nlevel because of the well-known purification process of NHC catalysis\nwithout the need for column purification. In particular, our method\nshowed only a single product without any remaining starting material\nor byproducts and only required the removal of the NHC and solvent.\n\nWhen the reaction mixture was extracted\nwith ethyl acetate, Mes-NHC was eliminated as a residue from the product\nbecause of the insolubility of Mes-NHC salts in ethyl acetate.

After washing, the crude product was dried and\nrecrystallized with ethanol to give the desired pure products in good\nyield.\n\nRoute-A synthesis, yellow solid, mp 135\u2013138\n\u00b0C, 87% yield; 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3)\n\u03b4 7.36 (td, J = 7.8, 1.2 Hz, 1H), 7.20 (dd, J = 7.4, 0.8 Hz, 1H), 7.06 (td, J = 7.6,\n0.8 Hz, 1H), 6.97 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 1H), 6.58 (d, J = 0.5 Hz, 1H), 6.45 (d, J = 0.4 Hz, 1H),\n4.11 (dt, J = 14.6, 7.3 Hz, 1H), 4.02 (dt, J = 14.5, 7.4 Hz, 1H), 3.71 (s, 3H), 3.64 (s, 3H), 3.44\n(s, 1H), 2.80 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H) ppm; 13C NMR (150 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 176.0, 171.7, 164.9, 143.3,\n139.0, 130.3, 129.2, 127.6, 124.0, 123.0, 108.8, 52.0, 51.9, 35.9,\n31.5 ppm; FT-IR \u03bd 1737, 1718, 1701, 1613, 1491, 1364, 1056 cm\u20131; HRMS (EI, m/z):\nM+ calculated for C16H17NO6 319.1056, found 319.1058.\n\nWhite solid, mp 195\u2013198 \u00b0C,\n85% yield; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 7.90\n(s, 1H), 7.27\n(td, J = 7.7, 1.2 Hz, 1H), 7.17 (d, J = 7.3 Hz, 1H), 7.02 (td, J = 7.6, 0.8 Hz, 1H),\n6.89 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 1H), 6.57 (s, 1H), 6.41 (s,\n1H), 3.71 (s, 1H), 3.66 (s, J = 21.9 Hz, 3H) ppm; 13C NMR (100 MHz, acetone-d6) \u03b4\n177.6, 165.5, 144.2, 141.3, 132.3, 130.3, 127.1, 124.3, 122.4, 110.5,\n110.4, 51.9 ppm; FT-IR \u03bd 1714, 1711, 1621, 1487, 1330, 1065\ncm\u20131; HRMS (EI, m/z): M+ calculated for C12H11NO4 233.0688, found 233.0689.\n\nA\ndried round-bottomed flask was charged with IMes\u00b7Cl salt (10\nmol %) and DBU (10 mol %) in dry THF (1 mL) under a N2 atmosphere.\nTo this, addition of DMSO (0.1 mL), ethyl diazoacetate (1.2 mmol),\nand dropwise addition of N-unsubstituted 2-oxindole (1 mmol) solution\nin dry THF (1 mL) at room temperature by using a syringe were carried\nout.
