{"title": "Abstracts of the Tenth Conference of the Federation of Infection Societies", "body": "The antibiotics currently in Phase I, II and III will each be reviewed with respect to their utility and spectrum of activity. Many of these are agents for the treatment of Gram positive infections and most are new derivatives from existing antibiotic classes and thus do not provide the much needed quantum jump away from established resistance mechanisms. Consequently, over the next 5-10 years few novel antibiotics with entirely new mechanisms of action are destined to reach the clinic. Bacterial genomics has been hailed as the solution to identifying new antibacterial strategies and the tremendous impact that genomics and genomic based technologies has had on the discovery of new antibacterial targets will be illustrated. However, progressing from a novel genomics derived target to identifying a development candidate has proven to be an exceptionally challenging process, exemplified by the small number of novel mechanism agents currently in development. The complexities of delivering new antibiotics in the post genomic era will be illustrated along with perspective on potential solutions to some of the key research hurdles to enhance and facilitate the discovery of new class antibiotics. Despite the vast amount of press in professional and lay journals relating to molecular diagnostics the majority of work still carried out in clinical microbiology laboratories is based upon conventional technologies. There is a steady rise in the application of molecular techniques to the diagnosis and management of infection. There has been no single massive application of molecular technology, more an accumulation of applications in various areas which are either in trial or in day to day application being either more sensitive or cost effective than other non molecular technologies. Perhaps the most striking method which is about to influence every clinical bacteriology lab is the use of molecular technology to detect MRSA. There are a plethora of PCR based techniques for the detection of the mecA gene and other targets which identify Staphylococcus aureus or other staphylococcal species. New developments are the utilisation of the light cycler based or isothermal amplification methods. These being applied both to the characterisation of cultured staphylococci and direct detection from specimens. The theme of direct detection from specimens obviously is seductive as it offers the prospect of altering or initiating therapy much more rapidly than conventional culture methods. A notable addition is the description of a DNA probe based PCR assay for the detection of Campylobacter spp. in faeces. This assay utilises a variant of the reverse line blot as hybridisation assay which utilises immobilised oligonucleotide probes and hybridisation with a labelled PCR product from the specimen. This technology has recently found a number of applications. In the area of epidemiological typing a number of advances have been made with the application particularly in the typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains of variable number tandem repeat typing using various platforms including both DNA sequencers and DHPLC. One useful area would be the ability to use PCR typing for MRSA but a recent evaluation showed that as yet PFGE is superior. Bacterial species identification is of considerable interest and recently the application rpoB gene sequencing was found to be both sensitive and specific when applied to both mycobacteria and bacillus, enabling the rapid and definitive identification of B. anthracis and M. tuberculosis. No review would be complete without reference to SARS this year and the value and availability of rapid reverse transcriptase based DNA sequencing of the SARS coronavirus and the subsequent design of rapid PCR assays is undoubtedly helpful in the identification of cases, although the sensitivity of molecular methods does not approach that of retrospective sero conversion methods. Finally DNA and protein arrays are a potentially powerful tool within the study of pathogenicity and physiology of micro organisms. At the moment their complexity and expense rules them out from routine application in diagnostic laboratories, however, it will not be long before the first commercially based arrays are applied to areas of diagnosis from which the quantity and type of information cannot be gained by any other method. There are many potential advantages to be gained from using plants as a production system for recombinant proteins. They are higher eukaryotic organisms with an endomembrane system, they fold and assemble recombinant proteins using protein chaperones that are homologous to those in mammalian cells, and they glycosylate proteins. Moreover, they offer the potential to scale up to agricultural proportions, that offers both the possibility to produce proteins in enormous quantities, as well as the prospect of very low cost. An important application area where these benefits could be brought to bear is in the field of vaccine production, particularly in developing countries.\n\nPlant expressed IgG monoclonal antibodies were first described in 1989. Since then, transgenic plants have proven to be extremely versatile, successfully used for antibody fragments, IgG and secretory IgA antibodies, the latter already having been taken through clinical trials. A considerable amount of work has also been performed on the expression of antigens in plants, particularly with a view to oral delivery. To date, three examples have been tested in humans-E. coli heat labile toxin, hepatitis B surface antigen and Norwalk virus capsid protein. Overall, proof of principle has been demonstrated for the production of recombinant pharmaceutical in plants. The next step is to progress through formal clinical trials and importantly, to commercialise the first product. \n\nThe last year has seen some consensus emerging, particularly in the UK and USA, in two important areas: the use of cortico-steroids in the management of adults with bacterial meningitis the management of drug sensitive and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis For bacterial meningitis; the first randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive steroids (301 adults) showed a reduction in the proportion of patients who had unfavourable outcomes (15% vs 25%, p \u00bc 0:03) and the proportion of patients who died (7% vs 15%, p \u00bc 0:04). The benefits were most obvious in patients with pneumococcal meningitis (N Engl J Med 2002; 347:1549 -1556). Adjunctive dexamethasone therapy is now recommended for most adults with suspected pneumococcal meningitis. However, most health care-associated infections are endemic and result from cross-transmission related to inappropriate patient-care practices. To improve healthcare workers' (HCW) compliance with practices, infection control should learn from the behavioural sciences. Infection control professionals play key roles in the identification and prevention of nosocomial infections. They act as observers, educators and, ultimately, should become change agents. Changing behaviour and shifting social norms at multiple levels through the HCW community are among the key challenges of infection control today.\n\nAlthough a modification of patient-care practices is vital for infection prevention, this issue has received only little attention in the medical literature. During the latter half of the 20th century, it was suggested that social behaviour could be best understood as a function of people's perceptions rather than as a function of real life. This assumption gave birth to several models based on social cognitive variables to improve our understanding of human behaviour. Cognitive variables used in these models include: knowledge, motivation, intention, perception of threat, outcome expectancy, perceived and actual behavioural control, and social pressure. These determinants shape behaviour; they are acquired through the socialisation process and, importantly, are susceptible to change. Some social cognitive models (Health Belief Model, Health Locus of Control, Protection Motivation Theory, Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Self-Efficacy Model) have been applied to evaluate predictors of health behaviour but, so far, none has been successfully applied to explain behaviour in the field of infection control.\n\nSuccessful strategies to improve infection control practices result from their multidimensional aspect. Successful behaviour change can well by explained by applying the theory of Ecological Perspective, which is based on two key ideas: a) behaviour is viewed as being affected by and affecting multiple levels of influence; b) behaviour both influences and is influenced by the social environment. Levels of influence for health-related behaviours and conditions include intra-personal, inter-personal, institutional, and community factors, as well as administrative support. Intra-personal factors are individual characteristics that influence behaviour such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and personality traits. Inter-personal factors include inter-personal processes and primary groups-family, friends, and peers-that provide social identity, support and role definition. HCWs can be influenced by or are influential in their social environments. Behaviour is often influenced by peer group pressure. Social Cognitive Theory states that people learn not only through their own experiences, but also by observing others' actions and the results of those actions, as well as through modelling. Institutional factors to be considered to promote change include the availability and easy access to rules, policies, as well as technical and informal structures that help to promote recommended behaviours. Responsibilities for each HCWs' individual group must be clearly recognised and defined. Community factors are social networks and norms that exist either formally or informally between individuals, groups, and organisations. For example, in the hospital, the community level would be the ward. Community-level models are frameworks for understanding how social systems function and change, and how communities and organisations can be activated. The conceptual framework of community organisation models is based on social networks and support, focusing on the active participation and development of communities that can help evaluate and solve health problems. Public policy factors include local policies that regulate or support practices for disease prevention, control, and management. The institutional administration must openly support the creation of a multidisciplinary task force to address the problem of infection cross-transmission within the ward or the hospital. By this, it mandates representative members of the multidisciplinary institutional team to come together to identify the problem and to develop strategies to resolve it; it also endorses the choice and options taken and mobilizes the hospital resources needed to implement the strategies.\n\nBased on behavioural theories and reported experiences, multimodal intervention strategies have more chance of success than single approaches or promotion programmes focusing on one or two elements only. Similarly, social models that include several levels of cognitive determinants have more chance of success to explain change in behaviour. Concrete examples applied to infection control issues will be presented. Studies are needed to assess the key determinants of infection control practices and behaviour promotion among the different populations of HCWs, to develop methods to secure senior management support, and to implement and evaluate the impact of the different components of multimodal programmes to promote optimal infection control practices.\n\nHajo Grundmann National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) Bilthoven, The Netherlands\n\nAmong the potentially pathogenic microorganisms bacteria are among the most enigmatic creatures. While viruses are small enough that biochemical means and molecular biology help us to get a near-to-complete understanding of all aspects of their developmental life-cycle, bacteria are more complex and by being prokaryotes, too remote from eukaryotes to understand their life-cycle in terms of conjugation and segregation which govern the reproduction of higher organisms. Genetic typing, especially genomic sequence-based typing provides an insight into the genetic population structure of bacteria and can thus address pertinent research questions in taxonomy, evolutionary genetics, microbial ecology and identify the epidemic potential of bacteria. Since evolutionary convergence and parallelism cannot be expected to occur in many genes at the same rate, multilocus approaches yield classifications not only of heuristic but also of epidemiological value.\n\nLiverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Pembroke Place, Liverpool, L3 5QA, UK, mark.taylor@liv.ac.uk Filarial nematodes cause widespread and debilitating diseases throughout many tropical regions. 1 Filarial disease includes acute lymphangitis, chronic hydrocoele, lymphodema and elephantiasis in lymphatic filariasis and skin disease and blindness in onchocerciasis. Recent research has highlighted the role of a symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia in disease pathogenesis. 2 When the bacteria are released from dead or damaged worms they cause inflammatory reactions associated with the adverse reactions to chemotherapy. 3, 4 Similar activation of innate inflammation by the bacteria causes the inflammatory responses that lead to river blindness. 5 The mutualistic dependence on Wolbachia has been used in a new approach to the treatment of filariasis. 6 Antibiotics have been used to eliminate the endosymbionts, which leads to an arrest of larval and embryonic development and survival and can also lead to the eventual death of adult worms, suggesting the bacteria are essential for their long-term survival. The first trials using doxycycline against human filariasis have been encouraging, with sustained reductions in microfilariae, long-term sterilization in onchocerciasis and potent macrofilaricidal activity in lymphatic filariasis. The use of antibiotics, in addition to perturbing the symbiotic relationship, could also eliminate the cause of filarial disease.\n\nThe first matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) was found to be critical for normal tadpole tail resorption. 26 similar zinc-containing proteases have since been identified, which have central roles in physiological tissue turnover and leukocyte extravasation. 92 kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) and 52 kDa interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) are the quantitatively predominant MMPs secreted by monocytic cells, pivotal in anti-tuberculous immunity. MMP-9 degrades type IV collagen; a major component of vascular basement membrane and MMP-1 cleaves the chief structural collagens in lung tissue. Tuberculosis is characterised by a necrotising granulomatous immune response but the cause of tissue destruction is poorly understood. Since excessive MMP activity may be destructive, the hypothesis that dysregulated MMP activity causes tissue injury in TB was investigated. In vitro, human monocytic (THP-1) cells infected by live, virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis secreted MMP-9 in a dose-dependent manner. At 24 h, MMP-9 concentrations increased 10-fold (p , 0:001 v controls) and de novo MMP-9 mRNA synthesis was detected. In contrast, upregulation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 gene expression and secretion was delayed and less striking. In vivo, MMP-9 concentration per leukocyte in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from tuberculous meningitis patients \u00f0n \u00bc 23\u00de was higher than in bacterial \u00f0n \u00bc 12\u00de or viral meningitis \u00f0n \u00bc 20\u00de \u00f0p , 0:01\u00de: TIMP-1 concentrations were similar in tuberculous compared with bacterial meningitis or controls. Thus, a phenotype in which MMP-9 activity is relatively unrestricted by TIMP-1 developed in vitro and in vivo. In addition, MMP-9 concentrations/CSF leukocyte (but not TIMP-1 levels) was elevated in fatal tuberculous meningitis and in patients with signs of cerebral damage (unconsciousness, confusion, or neurological deficit; p , 0:05). However, there was no relationship with severity of systemic illness.\n\nBiopsies from patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis were next studied by immunohistochemistry. Intense MMP-9 staining was found in monocytic cells forming the center of granuloma and adjacent to necrosis. Minimal TIMP-1 expression again indicated unopposed MMP-9 activity. Since granulomas contain few mycobacteria, the existence of monocyte-monocyte cytokine networks that amplify MMP-9 secretion was investigated in vitro. Conditioned media from M. tuberculosis-infected primary human monocytes or THP-1 cells (CoMTB) stimulated MMP-9 gene expression and . 10-fold increase in MMP-9 secretion by monocytes at 3-4 d (p , 0:009 vs controls). Anti-TNF-antibody (but not IL-1 receptor antagonist) pre-treatment inhibited MMP-9 secretion induced by CoMTB, or by direct infection, by 50% (p \u00bc 0:0001 and 0.0002 respectively). CoMTB and TNF-independently stimulated dose-dependent MMP-9 secretion. Pertussis toxin inhibited CoMTB-induced MMP-9 secretion and enhanced the inhibitory effect of TNF-blockade \u00f0p \u00bc 0:05\u00de; thus implicating chemokines in the network. Finally, the effects of antiinflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13) on M. tuberculosis-infected THP-1 cells suggested that MMP activity might be inadequately suppressed. Conversely, interferon-inhibited MMP-9 gene expression and secretion in a dose-dependent manner.\n\nIn conclusion, M. tuberculosis-infected monocytic cells exhibit a matrix-degrading phenotype in vitro. A similar phenotype was observed in patients where MMP-9 activity was related to local tissue injury and found adjacent to caseous necrosis. Cytokine networks may amplify MMP-9 secretion by monocytic cells within granuloma. TNF-, critical for anti-mycobacterial granuloma formation, is a pivotal autocrine and paracrine regulator. Interferon may protect against MMP-mediated injury.\n\nThe management of prosthetic joint infection requires a multidisciplinary approach. Patients need to be assessed and managed jointly by orthopaedic surgeons specialised in complex revision arthroplasty and by infection specialists. Plastic surgery input is often required. Care involves physiotherapists, occupational therapists, specialised nursing staff and a range of other health professionals.\n\nWhat are the management options? Host, joint and microbial factors affect decision making. For each individual, expectations and aims should be clear to both patient and doctor. This includes the likelihood of eradicating or suppressing infection, reduction in pain and eventual joint function. The options are as follows;\n\nDo nothing or attempt suppression with antibiotics alone (this may be appropriate in an elderly person with co-morbidities, a functioning, relatively pain-free joint with a discharging sinus). Prosthesis debridement and retention One or two-stage revision Excision arthroplasty, arthrodesis or amputation Studies of debridement and prosthesis retention ('salvage' therapy) have been limited by having small numbers and limited follow-up periods. Success rates vary from almost zero in early studies to .50% in carefully selected patients. The duration of symptoms before debridement appears to be a major factor in determining success. There are some outcome data indicating that there are differences according to infecting organism (penicillin-susceptible streptococci .coagulase negative staphylococci . S. aureus). The optimum duration for 'antibiotic suppression' is not clear. Zimmerli et al., using an animal model with a S. aureus device-related infection, showed that antibiotic combinations that included rifampicin have a higher rate of cure. This was subsequently supported by a randomised controlled trial.\n\nFor patients with an unstable (loose) prosthesis or other factors that make salvage impractical, a one or two-staged revision can be considered. Success rates vary from 75-90% for a one stage procedure and 70-100% in two stages. Success is most likely if all foreign and non-viable material, including cement, is removed. The timing of the two stages and route/duration of antibiotics varies between institutions and studies. Some advocate an aspiration biopsy (off antibiotics) prior to the decision to reimplant. Clearly if the joint is still clinically infected or inflammatory markers still high, a re-debridement ('second first stage') is needed prior to considering re-implantation. For knees, a cement spacer is inserted between the two stages. For hips, many surgeons leave the joint with no spacer. Alternatives include cement beads or PROSTALAC implants that aim to preserve function. These devices can contain antibiotics.\n\nWhether or not the joint is retained, surgery (especially with knees) may require the use of muscle flaps. Adequate soft tissue coverage (in addition to overall host status) is crucial in determining the likelihood of eradicating infection.\n\nThe use of staging systems and the development of consensus definitions may allow the eventual comparison of patient groups, and hence improve the quality of evidence to inform clinical decisions. There are few proven therapies for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). There is no significant difference in response or recurrence rates between metronidazole and vancomycin, but mean duration of symptoms is marginally shorter (1.6 days) with the latter. Symptomatic recurrences are common (up to 37% of cases) and pose a therapeutic dilemma. Resistance to metronidazole or vancomycin is rare but has been described notably in Spain. Relapses are usually re-infections with different strains; switching between metronidazole and vancomycin and vice versa in patients with symptomatic recurrences is therefore illogical. A first recurrence should be re-treated with oral metronidazole. Tapering/pulsed vancomycin (4-6 weeks) has been used in noncomparative studies. Similarly the combination of vancomycin/ rifampicin is unproven and inconsistent with susceptibility data.\n\nSaccharomyces boulardii is the best studied biotherapy for CDI, but prophylaxis and treatment efficacy data are inconsistent.\n\nThere is a risk of fungaemia, consistent with animal studies showing heterogenous virulence of S. boulardii strains. Biotherapy studies have usually been open and small; the true efficacy of almost all reported regimens is unknown. Lactobacillus GG trials in acute diarrhoea are conflicting; a recent large study showed no difference to placebo. Rectal biotherapy/infusion of faeces have been used occasionally to circumvent gastric acid degradation of probiotics. Claims of high success rates are undermined by impracticality.\n\nA high molecular weight polymer, GT160-246, binds CD toxins A and B. It protects against death but not colitis in hamsters, and was well tolerated in Phase 1 human trials. There are case reports of CDI unresponsive to standard therapy successfully treated with iv immunoglobulin. Diarrhoea was prevented in hamsters by bovine-sourced immunoglobulin. Non-bovine derived specific anti-toxin antibodies are under investigation. A vaccine containing CD A and B toxoids was safe and immunogenic in healthy volunteers, inducing anti-toxin levels greater than those associated with protection in clinical studies. Since the Cooke report of 1995 1 Infection Control Teams (ICTs) have been encouraged to carry out surveillance of healthcareassociated infections (HCAI). Two national prevalence surveys of HCAI 2,3 have been carried out but surveillance of HCAI has been limited to alert organisms/conditions and a few surgical procedures. However, following the National Audit Office Report 'The Management and Control of Hospital Acquired infection in Acute NHS Trusts in England' 4 greater emphasis has been placed on the need for prospective surveillance of HCAI. Currently ICTs are required to report MRSA bacteraemias and the outcome of elective orthopaedic procedures. In the near future, pressure will be on the ICTs to produce surveillance data on a wider range of alert organisms/conditions and surgical site infections (SSIs) e.g. Clostridium difficile, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, caesarean sections etc. However, the resources needed to carry out these additional studies are not yet in place in many parts of the UK. This workshop will look at the staff and skills required by an ICT to carry out these mandatory surveillance tasks. As an example, the scenario of SSI surveillance will be examined in more detail. This will include the use of core and local datasets, methodologies, definitions and means of data collection. One way forward is to introduce the concept of an 'Infection Control Surveillance Co-ordinator' who will facilitate the whole process. Such a person may require additional training in basic data handling and analysis but these and other skills should be made available to other members of the ICT. The co-ordinator could be from the existing ICT or from others with an appropriate scientific, IT or clerical background.\n\nCurrently, the ICTs are made up of consultant microbiologists/ ICD and ICNs and other support staff. The ICDs and ICNs are supported by a number of professional bodies who assist in one way or another in basic training and higher degrees. Nevertheless, the ICTs still feel that they are ill-equipped to undertake detailed surveillance of HCAI.\n\nDuring the discussion a number of questions need to be answered such as who will require teaching, what need to be taught, who will teach and how the teaching will be carried out. Travel medicine is the rapidly expanding subspecialty of tropical medicine aimed at the prevention of morbidity in travelers. With rapid increase in travel, both regional and international and the many reasons for travel, tourism, commerce and migration the subject encompasses many aspects and specialties of medicine.\n\nWhen providing travelers with advice on morbidity, a risk or hazard assessment needs to be undertaken to define health risks which may be vaccine preventable or modified by behavior. Defining travelers risk requires accurate epidemiological data on morbidity in travellers. The quality of such data in widespread use and the use of endemic disease risk will be evaluated. Data available on the incidence of travel associated morbidity is very limited and of poor quality. Morbidity associated with malaria as a notifiable disease, enables the most precise risk assessment to be made, although comparatively it is a relatively infrequent health problem. Morbidity associated with pre-existing medical conditions, trauma and accidents the most important cause of severe travel morbidity are poorly defined and difficult to predict or advise on.\n\nRisk assessment is often therefore based on clinical judgments of perceived risk while efficacy of prophylactics are often based on studies undertaken on endemic native population rather than travelers. For the identified risks, the interventions available should be evidence based and the use shown to provide more benefit than harm.\n\nSafety and toxicity data of prophylactics are often inconsistent and based on nonrepresentative groups. The effective uptake and use of evidence based interventions are poor and unpredictable. Most risk assessments made on travelers are not evidence based and the protection from prophylactic measures has not been derived from pertinent scientific investigation.\n\nTravel medicine is currently an art form awaiting a scientific base. Rabies immunisation is essential for bat handlers and postexposure treatment for rabies is essential for patients bitten by bats.\n\nPatients with acute flaccid paralysis and presumptive viral encephalitis should be asked if they have been bitten by bats, irrespective of travel history.\n\nAnte-mortem diagnosis of bat rabies in humans is possible using RT-PCR. Results: Most of the West Indian population were born in the UK and thought to have acquired their infection locally. VNTR types tended to be clustered, the Harlem clade, 32333, being most commonly represented. The newly identified X clade, 32433, was seen in 7 patients, 5 of whom were born in the West Indies. There was a group of 11 patients with identical MIRU profiles. Traditional contact tracing had not previously identified links between these individuals, although they are geographically clustered. This information will direct further epidemiological inquiry and may explain the on going excess rates of tuberculosis within this community. In contrast, most of the African populations were recent arrivals in the UK and had disease as a result of re-activation of latent infection rather than from local spread. There was minimal clustering of VNTR profiles. In previous work, we identified an attenuated mutant containing a disruption in the lctP gene, predicted to encode a protein with 21% identity and 58% similarity with a lactate permease from E. coli. To examine the role of the lctP gene on lactate utilisation by N. meningitidis, the growth of strain MC58DlctP in single carbon sources was compared against the wild-type strain. The two strains grew equally well in 10 mM glucose, while the lactate permease mutant was defective for growth in media with lactate as the sole carbon source. In addition, uptake studies demonstrated that the mutant is incapable of assimilating lactate. Metabolic studies showed that growth of the wild type bacterium, though not that of the mutant, is enhanced by the addition of lactate to media containing glucose. Furthermore the survival of the mutant (MC58DlctP) in normal human sera was only 16% that of the wild-type.\n\nIn order to investigate the basis for the attenuation of the lctP mutant virulence assays in complement deficient (C3 2/2 ) animals were performed. Results demonstrated that the mutant is only attenuated in the presence of an active complement pathway. Further results will be presented about the mechanisms underlying the serum sensitivity of the mutant.\n\nThe capacity of recombinant LctP to induce protection against live bacterial challenge was assessed. Immunisation with LctP gave consistently superior protection than PorA, a surface expressed meningococcal protein that elicits bactericidal antibodies. Further work is required to define the immunological basis of the protective immunity. Acanthamoeba is an opportunistic protozoan parasite, which can cause fatal granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE) and eye keratitis. However, the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of these emerging diseases remains incompletely understood. Aims of this study were to determine the effects of Acanthamoeba on host cell cycle using human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC).\n\nTwo isolates of Acanthamoeba belonging to T1 genotype (GAE isolate) and T4 genotype (Keratitis isolate) were used and their pathogenic potential determined using HBMEC and HCEC, respectively. To determine the effects of Acanthamoeba on host cell cycle, a cell cycle specific gene array was used. This screened for 96 genes important for host cell cycle regulation. Next, we determined the effects of Acanthamoeba on Retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylations using anti-phospho-Rb for immunoprecipitation, followed by anti-Rb for Western blotting. Retinoblastoma is a tumour suppressor protein and potent inhibitor of G1/S cell cycle progression. However, Rb function is inhibited upon phosphorylation at multiple sites allowing progression into S phase.\n\nAcanthamoeba isolates belonging to T1 (GAE) and T4 (Keratitis) genotypes produced severe cytotoxicity on HBMEC and HCEC and were considered potential pathogens. No tissue specificity was observed indicating that both isolates have the potential to produce GAE and/or keratitis. Gene array analyses showed that Acanthamoeba inhibits expression of genes including cyclins F, G1 and cyclin dependant kinase 6 that are important for cell cycle progression. Moreover, upregulation of gene expression such as GADD45A and CDC6, associated with cell cycle arrest was observed indicating cell cycle inhibition. Western blotting assays revealed that Acanthamoeba inhibits Rb phosphorylations leading to cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition. A proportion of patients flown on military aeromedical flights will have or may potentially been exposed to an infectious disease. RAF medical and nursing personnel have a duty to take precautions to prevent transmission of infection. Infection Control Guidelines for use in hospital and community settings are available; however, when the 'ward' is 35,000 feet high, conditions are crammed and noisy, and there are no washbasins or running water, and only one chemical toilet for all to share, the two working environments bare little resemblance to each other. The use of disinfectants is strictly forbidden on aircraft so alterative methods to render blood spillages safe had to be approached. Clinical waste on aircraft, and its appropriate management, was carefully considered.\n\nBy going back to first principles of infection control, the existing practices and the working environments on the various types of aircraft were critically analyzed. This resulted in development and adaptations of the infection control guidelines that enabled healthcare personnel to prevent the transmission of infection within the close confines of the aircraft environment.\n\nThe aeromedical transportation of patients into UK hospitals from overseas is on the increase. This not only involves UK military patients, but also referrals to specialist centres, using private fixed-wing and helicopter air ambulances. It is important for all those involved in the control of infection to understand the unique difficulties of this type of patient transport, and appreciate that even in arduous circumstances, infection control must remain a priority. \n\nIntroduction: Skin infection due to opportunistic pathogens has become a major problem to HIV/AIDS and non-HIV/AIDS people in Kenya as HIV prevalence keeps rising in the world. It represents as recurrent itchy rashes. It mimics various dermatology (e.g. cellulites, acne etc.), allergy and asthma like conditions. This has resulted to high use of steroids, antibiotics and anti fungal without success. The immuno suppressant effect of steroids could be worsening these conditions on HIV/AIDS patients. A collaborative community based programme was initiated by Infection Control Association of Kenya (ICAK) and NGOs taking care of the sick to investigate the agents, control antibiotics and steroids/antifungal high usage, by giving health providers effective alternative.\n\nMethod: Itchy conditions were investigated (1) chlorhecidine (2) centrimide, chlorhexidine, \u00fe Centrimide, Benzalkonumechroride, providone iodine, for bacteria/fungal infections and isolates identified. Various locally available antiseptics were tried on patients with bacterial infection to eliminate the bacteria and itching and development of normal skin was monitored for three years. Steroids/antibiotics and anti fungal were withdrawn.\n\nResults: Pure growth of exfoliative Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 80% of recurrent itchy cases while normal skin and mixed growth of skin normal flora. This strain produces exfoliative toxins A, B and epidermolytic toxins which cause scalded skin syndrome and itching conditions. The ointment, which is composed of chlorhexidine gluconate and cetrimide, liquid paraffin and petroleum jelly is able to control itching while others did not control itching, eliminate the exfoliative staphaureus and prevent deformation of the skin. The use of this has drastically reduced the suffering of patients and use of steroids and antibiotics.\n\nConclusion: The use of this very low concentration of chlorhexidine/cetrimide ointment by NGOs, (Church Health providers MSFS-Belgium-Spain-France.) has drastically reduced suffering of patients, reduced use of topical steroids, antibiotics and anti fungal. For those patients who had been on steroids for a long time, their conditions looked bad and they took longer time to heal with this ointment than those who had not been on steroids. We recommend topical steroids should not be used on HIV/AIDS patients. There were a number of individuals who were only present in the factory on certain days. These cases suggested a point source occurring around the 5-9 August 2002. The epidemic curve was consistent with this. A number of potential sources were investigated including wind borne spread from neighbouring farmland, contamination from lorries carrying hay, contaminated landfill site, feral cats and spread from an individual case in the factory. Extensive renovation work was being undertaken at the time of the outbreak and building materials were also investigated as a possible source of the outbreak.\n\nThe presentation/poster highlights a number of difficulties when investigating an outbreak of Q fever, including some of the difficult decisions that have to be made with regard to treatment and follow up. Objectives: To determine the incidence and to identify the risk factors of crosstransmission of nosocomial pathogens in AICU.\n\nDesign and Setting: A prospective cohort study was conducted from January 2000 to April 2001 in a 16 bed AICU of a 1500-bed tertiary teaching hospital.\n\nPatients and Methods: 430 patients who were admitted for .48 h to the AICU, were followed and data on exposures collected daily. Bacterial clones were identified by molecular typing. Transmission events were identified when two or more patients had indistinguishable isolates and were treated in the AICU during overlapping intervals or no more than 7 days apart. The direction of transmission could only be ascertained if the incriminated pathogen was isolated from the donor before admission of the recipient. In all other instances where the direction of transmission could not be determined, patients were regarded as potential recipients and censured for the current analysis. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk factors of transmission were calculated using logistic regression.\n\nResults: Patients were followed for 3947 patient days. 275 isolates were collected and typed. In total, 40 episodes of crosstransmission were detected. Twenty-eight patients were ascertained recipients (6.5%), giving a density (incidence rate) for the first incident of 7 per 1000 patient days and a median time to event of 5 days. Immunosuppression [OR 3.9, CI 1. Histamine is commonly found in biological tissues at low concentrations, but may be associated with scombroid poisoning following the ingestion of spoiled foods that have been contamination with enteric bacteria. Often in wounds, little importance is attributed to the presence of enteric bacteria, yet the ability of these organisms to produce histamine may have clinical significance. The aim of this study was to determine whether bacteria isolated from infected wounds had the potential to produce histamine in vitro. Cultures of Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 23355, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13383, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 13315, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12228, together with 49 clinical isolates of Gram negative bacteria were screened for the production of histamine, using each of four differential media supplemented with histidine. Bacteria were incubated in M9 minimal medium supplemented with histidine at 37 8C for up to 5 days and culture supernatants collected and filtered. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) and enzyme analysis was used to test for the presence of histamine in culture filtrates. The use of differential media for the detection of histamine was judged to be unreliable, with Pseudomonas giving false positives. TLC indicated that only 4/54 isolates were seen to produce histamine. Enzyme assays demonstrated substantial production of histamine in 4 strains of Morganella morganii (,2000 ppm histamine), and lower concentrations in one strain of Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae (5 strains), Escherichia coli (4 strains), and Klebsiella spp. (8 strains). Histamine was not detected in Proteus mirabilis (4 strains), Proteus vulgaris (1 strain) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 strains). This is the first report of the in vitro production of histamine in bacteria isolated from wounds. It is possible that histamine production by bacteria in wounds may lead to symptoms of inflammation that may be mistaken for infection. Despite a great increase in our understanding of the molecular biology of the viruses associated with acute upper respiratory tract viral infections (URTI) there is a remarkable lack of knowledge and ideas about why URTI should exhibit a seasonal incidence. Publications in this area acknowledge a lack of any explanation for the seasonality of URTI or put forward an explanation related to an increased 'crowding' of susceptible persons in winter. The incidence of URTI such as common cold and influenza exhibit seasonal fluctuations with a peak of respiratory illness during the winter months. Winter seasonality has been reported for a wide range of viruses: orthomyxoviruses (influenza), paramyxoviruses (RSV, parainfluenza), coronaviruses, picornaviruses (common cold), herpes viruses, and adenoviruses. Viruses which may cause systemic illness but which gain entrance to the body via the upper respiratory tract, such as certain paramyxovirus infections (measles, mumps) and varicella-zoster infection (chicken pox), also show a similar winter seasonality. Lower respiratory tract diseases such as pneumonia, which may be viral or bacterial in aetiology, also show a similar seasonal pattern with the peak of illness in winter. This presentation will discuss some of the ideas concerning seasonality of URTI and put forward a new hypothesis for discussion-that seasonal exposure to cold air causes an increase in the incidence of URTI due to cooling of the nasal airway. The hypothesis proposes that inhalation of cold air causes cooling of the nasal epithelium, and that this reduction in nasal temperature is sufficient to inhibit local respiratory defences against infection such as mucociliary clearance and the phagocytic activity of leukocytes. A case will also be made that warming of the nasal airway as a consequence of nasal congestion may help to resolve a current URTI. Introduction: Adherence to antiretroviral medication is known to be highly important in achieving viral suppression and preventing early emergence of resistance. The complexity of regimes and tablet burden make adherence difficult and when this is combined with the chaotic nature of the lives of some HIV patients, it is not surprising that failure to adhere to regimes is common. Text messaging is cheap and accessible and automated texting to large numbers of patients has been shown to be acceptable and useful in the management of other chronic illnesses. However, it was felt that the potential stigma which still surrounds HIV would make text messaging about HIV unpopular with the majority of HIV patients.\n\nMethods: A questionnaire, designed to look at current compliance with therapy and attitudes to text messaging, was offered to 68 HIV patients attending a clinic. Patients were asked to complete this at the time of their clinic visit and results were collected anonymously.\n\nResults: 65/68 questionnaires (96%) were completed and returned. Mean time since diagnosis was 6.18 years (range 0-20). 55/65(85%) patients were currently on antiretroviral treatment and of those 18 found their treatment complicated.\n\nOnly 13 of those on medication (24%) stated that they always took each of their medications at the right time, with the rest admitting to sometimes taking tablets late, occasionally forgetting or frequently forgetting (more than once a week) to take a dose of medication. 55/65 patients (85%) owned a mobile phone, and 50/65(85%) indicated that they would personally find one or more aspect of a text messaging service useful.\n\nConclusions: A high percentage of patients in our population admit to poor compliance with antiretrovirals. Surprisingly, a large proportion of patients felt that text messaging would be useful. This suggests that this service should be developed and studied further. Lysostaphin is a 452 residue antimicrobial peptide produced by strains of S. simulans that is active against MRSA. During secretion from S. simulans the N-terminal signal peptide and the 15 tandem repeats are removed leaving the 246 residue mature lysostaphin. It has an endopeptidase domain that cleaves the pentaglycine cross-linker that strengthens the cell wall of S. aureus. Producing cells are resistant to killing by lysostaphin due to the incorporation of serine residues in the pentaglycine crosslinker. Lysostaphin also has a targeting domain, that allows lysostaphin to bind to S. aureus cells, however the actual 'receptor molecule' has not been identified. We are carrying out a research programme aimed at widening our current limited understanding of the biology of lysostaphin. We have (1) developed a rapid purification protocol for the mature lysostaphin; (2) developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay of endopeptidase activity; (2) identified conserved residues in the endopeptidase domain in an alignment of lysostaphin homologues; and (3) mutated the conserved residues in the endopeptidase domain, using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, and showed loss of biological and endopeptidase activity in the purified mutant proteins.\n\nThe information acquired in this study will be used to help develop a family of novel, antimicrobial peptides that have (1) a broader spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, and (2) will preempt the resistance mechanisms that will arise when such proteins are used clinically. Results: 946 patient episodes across the seven directorates of cardiology, care of the elderly, haematology, medicine, neurology, orthopaedics and surgery were analysed. 893 of 1074 (83%) AMT inputs were interventional. No significant detrimental effect on either patient mortality or length of stay as a result of stopping antibiotics was identified. In 3.1% of patient episodes the advice given by the AMT was not adopted by the attending physicians. In 55% (6/11) cases this was due to new clinical circumstances arising after the ward round. The remaining 5 episodes were rectified by the AMT the following week. The AMT ward rounds reduced use of intravenous antimicrobials by up to 48% and made direct antimicrobial cost savings on the ward round day of up to 42%. Total cost savings to the Trust ranged from \u00a317k-\u00a3107k per annum dependent on the number of days that the antibiotic changes made by the AMT pre-empted similar decisions by the attending team. This represents up to 14% of the annual antibiotic budget for some directorates. The total cost saving to the Trust in terms of nursing time saved and prevention of health-care associated infection (HCAI) is much greater.\n\nAMTs are interventional, improve patient care and can save large sums of money. The increasing emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria is of major concern for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. This prospective study aimed to examine the antibiotic usage on a 9 bed adult ICU and the relationship with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonisation. During an initial 8 months period all patients admitted to ICU for .24 h were included in the study; demographic and antibiotic data were collected and enhanced MRSA screening. Two hundred and fifteen patients were included, of which 26% were colonised with MRSA. Eighty eight per cent of patients received at least 1 antibiotic, with a mean of 2. Despite being used primarily as surgical prophylaxis agents, cefuroxime and metronidazole were the two most heavily prescribed antibiotics, with both being prescribed for extended periods. All evidence based guidelines for surgical prophylaxis recommend one dose on induction and we therefore implemented an educational programme involving the microbiologists, surgeons, pharmacists and anaesthetists to advocate one off surgical prophylaxis on induction. After the education programme a second period of data collection and MRSA screening took place and to date 37 patients have been included; 24% of which were colonised with MRSA and 86% have received at least 1 antibiotic. Cefuroxime and metronidazole usage has been reduced from 20.6 to 3.8 DDD/100 bed days and 33.1 to 13.8 DDD/100 bed days respectively. There has been an increased usage of tazocin, but other antibiotic usage has remained relatively constant. We have demonstrated that by using a multidisciplinary approach it is possible to reduce the post surgical prophylactic usage of antibiotics on the ICU; thereby potentially reducing the antibiotic selective pressure and in the long term the presence of multi resistant bacteria. Objectives: Cell wall-deficient bacteria (CWDB) have been associated with numerous disease processes, however, we still do not completely understand the factors that cause the loss of cell wall, in vivo, or the consequences of cell wall-deficiency on bacterial metabolism. Our objectives were to characterise the changes in antibiotic sensitivity and cell wall structure that occur when Staphylococcus aureus cells adopt a transient cell walldeficient phenotype.\n\nMethods: We induced cell wall-deficient variants of S. aureus, on media with high osmotic potential, in the presence of sub-lethal levels of penicillin. Antibiotic sensitivity profiles were determined using disc diffusion and agar dilution tests; sensitivity to cell wall active enzymes, intact cell matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were used to analyse cell wall structure.\n\nResults: CWDB were resistant to b-lactams and stained gramnegative. When cells were allowed to recover their wall by passage in the absence of penicillin, they displayed stable, high level, resistance to b-lactam antibiotics and had altered sensitivities to several other classes of antibiotic. In this revertant state, the cells had decreased sensitivity to lysis by lysostaphin and an altered signature on MALDI-TOF. The revertant cells had approximately 2.5 times more mass of cell wall than wild-type cells, the peptidoglycan of which had shorter glycan chains and a greater number of pentaglycine crossbridges.\n\nConclusions: Staphylococcus aureus cells which have been induced to transiently lose their cell walls, in the presence of penicillin, acquire stable, high level, resistance to b-lactams and have altered sensitivity to several other classes of antibiotics. Their cell walls are also altered and it is likely that this is partly responsible for the changed antibiotic sensitivity profile. Objectives: The aim of this study was to elucida te the factors associated with the wide variation in general practitioners (GPs) urine sampling and antibiotic prescribing behaviour for patients with suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs).\n\nMethod: A questionnaire was designed to obtain information o n the management of UTIs, comprising questions on practice demographics (e.g. list size, deprivation payments), GP demographics (e.g. age, sex) and six case scenarios (requiring details of urine sampling and antibiotic prescribing behaviour). Completed qu estionnaires were received from 293 GPs at 103 general practices.\n\nPreliminary Results: Twelve percent of GPs stated that they had a policy for referring samples for microbiological analysis; 28.1%-that laboratory susceptibility results always influenced the choice of agent for empirical therapy; 23.3%-would always request a further urine sample if the patient re-presented with symptoms suggestive of treatment failure; 67.8%-would always change therapy based on the laboratory susceptibility results in the case of treatment failures.\n\nConclusions: There is a high level of variation in urine sample submission rates throughout Wales, indicating a lack of consensus on sampling policy. The dynamics of urine sampling and antibiotic prescribing behaviour a re complex. Further analysis of this data will be presented. Results: After introduction of the policy, the number of notional 7 day courses per 100 admissions per month fell from 13 to 2 for Cephalosporins and from 39 to 13 for Augmentin. Benzyl\n\nPenicillin use tripled and that of Trimethoprim doubled. Amoxycillin use rose by 50%. CDI rates fell from 3 to 1 per 100 admissions per month. Estimated savings of \u00a3191,000 were generated from reductions in cephalosporin use and CDI cases avoided over a 21 month period.\n\nConclusions: Introduction of a narrow spectrum antibiotic policy, reinforced by regular feedback, was associated with a reduction in broad spectrum antibiotic use (cephalosporins and augmentin), an increase in narrow spectrum antibiotic prescription (benzylpenicillin, trimethoprim and amoxicillin), reduction in CDI rates and considerable savings. Feedback appears to be an effective tool to optimize antibiotic use. Methods: Antibiotic assay request forms from two teaching hospitals in Leeds were collected over one month. Antibiotic dosage schedule, timing of last dose, nature of assay, sampling time and the identity of the requesting staff member (doctor/nurse) were collected on each patient.\n\nResults: A total of 1151 request forms were analysed. Information regarding nature of assay was provided on 761 (66.1%), sampling time on 702 (61%) and antibiotic dose on 224 (19.5%).\n\nThe dosage schedule was mentioned on 211 (18.3%) and timing of last dose on 105 (9.1%). Thus only 17 (1.5%) provided all the relevant clinical data.\n\nDiscussion: About two thirds of the requests had information on the assay type (peak/trough/random) and sampling time.\n\nHowever only a small proportion (between 9-20%) provided rest of the necessary information such as timing of last dose, dosage schedule and antibiotic dose, vital for accurate interpretation. This may result in incorrect dosage adjustment, which may potentially be detrimental to patient care and have medicolegal implications. Microbiology and clinical staff time was wasted in trying to obtain this information over the telephone.\n\nThe clinical information provided on microbiology request forms for antibiotic assays was inadequate. This led to modification in the request forms and an educational programme for junior medical staff was recommended. . This service would also allow patients to maintain their lifestyle, avoid hospital acquired infections as well as allowing early discharge. An audit of patients with cellulitis on the Medical Unit before the OHPAT service was commenced, found the average stay inpatient was 9.5 days, but for those greater than 75 years old was 22 days.\n\nThe Service: Patients were mainly referred from the Medical Admissions Unit (MAU) and seen the same day by DB for suitability. Patients were administered their 1st dose of antibiotic on MAU and observed for 30 minutes before being allowed home. MAU staff arranged appropriate investigations.\n\nPatients then returned to the Infection Unit on a daily basis for parenteral antibiotics until there was satisfactory improvement. Hospital taxis were provided for those without private transport. Medical review by BM was twice weekly and management altered as thought appropriate. At discharge DB sent a discharge summary to the patient's GP. All drug cost were incurred by the Medical Division.\n\nResults: 282 patients have been seen, 218 (77%) having cellulitis. The mean length of iv antibiotic therapy for cellulitis was 9 days, with iv Ceftriaxone being antibiotic of choice unless there was a significant contradiction or adverse effect. Some patients were treated with prolonged courses of IV antibiotic (e.g. Malignant otitis externa for 115 days and 2 cases of MRSA spinal discitis treated for a total of 203 days). Overall 2834 patient days of iv therapy was administered. The estimated the cost of an inpatient is \u00a3240/day, therefore approximately \u00a3680 160 was saved by early patient discharge. A patient satisfaction survey was organised and 51 questionnaires were distributed randomly and 33 returned. 82% of respondents were very satisfied with the service, no one was dissatisfied. 94% would have chosen the service again, if needed. 88% of patients were able to maintain their normal lifestyle\n\nConclusions: This service appears to have fulfilled its goal leading to early hospital discharge but maintaining good patient care. The early discharge of patients appears to save significant amounts of money, but in reality, other patients replace those discharged early. However, the 'spill over' of acute Medical patients into other divisions was reduced. We now intend to expand this service to other Divisions within the Trust. Due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant wound-infecting bacteria, there is a need to develop new topical antimicrobial agents. One ancient remedy currently being re-considered is honey. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated in vitro, but if honey is to be an effective inhibitor in vivo it must retain potency in the presence of serum proteins, and this has not yet been tested. Using two wound pathogens, the aim of this investigation was to determine whether the presence of serum proteins affected the bactericidal activity of New Zealand manuka honey. Sterile manuka honey (potency equivalent to 19%w/v phenol) was used to determine Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) NCTC 10017 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 by serial dilution in nutrient broth (Oxoid) with a microtitre plate method. Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) was determined by plating onto nutrient agar (Oxoid). To determine the effect of serum proteins on antibacterial activity, nutrient broth was replaced by 90% foetal calf serum (FCS). In the absence of FCS, MRSA was more sensitive to manuka honey than Pseud. aeruginosa with MIC values of 2.8% (w/v) and 15% (w/v) respectively. MBCs of 7% and 20.6% respectively, indicated that the mode of action was bactericidal. In the presence of FCS, MICs increased by a factor of approximately 4 and 2, respectively, and activity was bactericidal. These results suggest that although components in FCS reduce the antibacterial activity of a manuka honey in vitro, bactericidal activity against two wound pathogens was still present following dilution by a factor of at least 4.\n\nIn clinical treatment, when undiluted honey is applied to wounds, exudate will be generated by osmotic effect, but this study suggests that honey will continue to retain bactericidal activity on dilution and in the presence of serum proteins when used in vivo. Results: There are currently over 70 members of the practice interest group. At least 50% are antibiotic pharmacists and around 33% are pharmacists responsible for working on antibiotic guidelines and audits. National study days are taking place in October 2003 and October 2004, and the UKCPA has a biannual conference providing further networking opportunities. A resource centre has been established providing material such as protocols and guidelines, and a website has been developed. An e-mail discussion group has received 37 enquiries including requests for protocols (30% of enquiries), drug administration and dosing questions (27%), clinical effectiveness issues (14%), job description requests (11%), and anti-infective supply issues (11%). Method: Process of care and outcomes at two Scottish hospitals were compared prospectively over two winters (November-April 2001/02 and 2002/03) before and after a planned intervention. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving appropriate antibiotics (British Thoracic Society definition) within 4 hours of admission. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and 30-day mortality. Pre-implementation, qualitative and quantitative methods identified potential barriers to the efficient delivery of appropriate antibiotics. This data was used to design a targeted intervention, which consisted of wallbased pathways, promotional posters, implementation packs, educational sessions and audit and feedback. Linear regression was used to calculate unadjusted and severity adjusted absolute change*.\n\nResults: The proportion of patients receiving appropriate antibiotics within 4 hours increased from 33% (60/181) to 56% (118/209) at the intervention hospital and 32% (19/60) to 36% (19/53) at the control hospital (Unadjusted absolute change \u00bc 20%, p , 0:01: Adjusted absolute change \u00bc 17%, p \u00bc 0:035). This was mostly due to a reduction in 'door to antibiotic time' rather than improved antibiotic prescribing. There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes. At the intervention hospital, the main reason for not achieving the primary outcome post-implementation was late delivery of antibiotics (71% of 91 cases of non-adherence). In the evaluation period, the maximum achievable adherence to the primary outcome was estimated to be 74%.\n\nThe intervention significantly increased the proportion of patients receiving appropriate antibiotics within 4 hours, although there was no evidence of a decrease in length of hospital stay or mortality. Background and Objective: The aim was to calculate the costeffectiveness of an educational intervention to improve the delivery and appropriateness of initial antibiotics in communityacquired pneumonia (CAP).\n\nMethod: Analyses were performed from the hospital's perspective. All costs were calculated using 2002 prices. The direct costs of healthcare were divided into the costs of: 1) hospitalisation and 2) initial antibiotic therapy. Outliers (patients with a length of stay .30 days or those admitted to high dependency) were excluded. Unadjusted and adjusted differences between the mean costs pre and post-implementation were calculated using linear regression. Significantly different net costs were added to intervention costs and then linked to the primary outcome (the proportion of patients receiving appropriate antibiotics with 4 hours of admission).\n\nResults: In the post-intervention period, 40 (95% CI, 19 -63) additional patients received appropriate antibiotics within 4 hours. In the pre-intervention period, the cost of hospitalisation and initial antibiotic therapy was \u00a31598 and \u00a36.34 per patient, respectively. Post-intervention, these costs increased to \u00a31601 (adjusted difference \u00bc \u00a349, p \u00bc 0:7) and \u00a39.01 (adjusted difference \u00bc \u00a32.12, p , 0:001). The adjusted total net direct health care cost was \u00a3443. The total project cost (including development, implementation, evaluation and training) was \u00a370579 (scenario A). The cost to a hospital adapting, implementing and performing a more limited evaluation was estimated to be \u00a317810 (scenario B). The cost to a hospital adapting and implementing the intervention only was estimated to be \u00a34841 (scenario C). Over the 6-month post-implementation evaluation period, the cost per additional patient receiving appropriate antibiotics within 4 hours with each of these scenarios was \u00a31776 (A), \u00a3456 (B) and \u00a3132 (C).\n\nThe intervention resulted in improved care, but at considerable cost. Costs would decrease notably if electronic case-records were available. The cost-effectiveness ratio also becomes more favourable over time. Background: Antibiotic resistance presents a major challenge. Local, national and international guidance suggests we should promote prudent prescribing of antibiotics, particularly for newer agents that should be used only when there are no alternatives. Linezolid, recently launched in the UK, is active against Gram positive bacteria including MRSA and vancomycinresistant enterococci. It was approved for use in our trust, but only following microbiology or infectious diseases (ID) approval. However, by July 2002, we had treated 54 patients with linezolid in 15 months, expenditure was increasing, and we had isolated a resistant organism. Our objectives were to introduce a system to ensure that linezolid was used only where appropriate, and to assess its impact.\n\nWe removed linezolid from all wards, so it had to be obtained via pharmacy. We adapted a system of mandatory order forms 1 for UK use; these require prescribers to complete details of patient, infection, prescriber, previous agents and microbiology/ID approval. All sections must be completed before dispensing; forms can be faxed to prescribers and back to pharmacy, or filled by pharmacists via telephone. The system also applies at evenings and weekends. We compared linezolid usage before and after its introduction.\n\nResults: Usage decreased from an average of 3.6 patients per month in the first 15 months, to 2.8 in the next 11 months.\n\nComparison of audit forms with pharmacy dispensing data shows that forms were completed for all 31 patients. We have complete audit data for each patient, including clinical specialties, sites of infection and organisms. There was evidence of microbiology/ID approval for 30 of the 31 patients.\n\nConclusion: Introduction of mandatory order forms curtailed our growth in linezolid use, and provides a system for ongoing monitoring and feedback of usage patterns. We are now extending this system to other anti-infectives. Methods: The effects of TD-6424 and four comparator antibiotics (vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and moxifloxacin) were assessed for bactericidal activity against staphylococcal biofilms.\n\nThe experiments were carried out using Sorbarod biofilms. Strains tested included methicillin-susceptible and resistant strains of Stahphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, as well as GISA strains. Bacteria were exposed to the antibiotics at exponentially decreasing concentrations, representing parenteral administration and also at a constant concentration, representing an IV infusion. Concentrations used correspond to peak serum levels and the rates at which drug concentrations were decreased correspond to their elimination half-lives.\n\n: All of the drugs tested produced a reduction in the number of cells eluted from the biofilms with both methods of exposure. Overall, the constant concentration method of antibiotic exposure was more effective than the exponentially decreasing concentration exposure in reducing the number of bacteria eluted from the staphylococcal biofilms. With both methods of exposure, TD-6424 was more effective than the established glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin: 1.0-1.5 log 10 reduction at the end of the experiment vs. 0-0.5 log 10 reduction, respectively, in the exponentially decreasing concentration method.\n\nConclusions: TD-6424 was the most efficient agent among those tested against both the non-GISA and GISA strains by both methods of exposure. It can be concluded that TD-6424 appears to be a promising antibiotic for the treatment of multi-drug resistant staphylococcal biofilm associated infections. Pyomyositis is a subacute bacterial infection of skeletal muscle. We report a case of pyomyositis of the right thigh and iliopsoas muscle in an intravenous drug user and present a review of the literature revealing few reported cases of community acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pyomyositis.\n\nThe patient presented with a two week history of pain and swelling of the right thigh. Although an initial diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was considered, laboratory and imaging studies were suggestive of right thigh and iliopsoas pyomyositis. A diagnosis of pyomyositis was confirmed at operation when incision, drainage and washout were undertaken. The patient worsened on conventional treatment with Benzylpenicillin and Flucloxacillin requiring further incision and drainage. MRSA and Streptococcus pyogenes were cultured from necrotic material excised from the thigh at the initial operation. The antibiotic regimen was converted to include a glycopeptide and following further debridement the patient slowly improved.\n\nA review of the literature was undertaken using searches by Medline and EMBASE. The search found a number of hospital acquired cases of MRSA pyomyositis, but only three reports of community acquired MRSA pyomyositis worldwide, with no case reports in the UK until now. This case report shows that conventional antibiotics for a pyomyositis may not be effective even in patients from the community. It may be necessary to consider a glycopeptide, such as vancomycin, in the initial treatment regimen of pyomyositis in certain subsets of patients such as intravenous drug users and converting to conventional therapy only when the cultures fail to grow resistant organisms. The objectives of this work were to develop a PCR for M. tuberculosis using primers to the IS6110 insertion element.\n\nAlthough the primers and conditions had been previously published, the PCR reaction was found to lack reproducibility, displaying a 10, 000 fold variation in sensitivity. Conditions were changed and a different, thermostable Taq Polymerase was used ('FastStart' Taq polymerase, Roche.) Significant contamination problems occurred during optimalisation but were completely controlled by use of the enzyme uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG), indicating carryover contamination rather than cross contamination. The sensitivity of the PCR reaction when used on DNA from the type strain of M. tuberculosis, H37Rv, was 5 fentograms (5 \u00a3 10 215 g) or 15 targets. This sensitivity, as well as the specificity of the PCR reaction, was confirmed on Southern blot. The internal primers, which were designed and used to make the radiolabelled probe for the Southern blot, would be suitable for use in the development of a nested PCR. Discitis is an inflammatory process of the intervertebral discs which usually involves the vertebral end plates and may extend into the adjacent tissues. Application of magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of discitis has led to increased awareness, and culture of disc aspirates has highlighted the bacterial aetiology. A retrospective study of the clinical presentation, investigation and antibiotic treatment of discitis was carried out between August 1996 and September 2002 by review of the clinical notes and laboratory records at the Taunton & Somerset Hospital.\n\nTwenty four adult patients were identified; 15 were over 60 years. Back pain was the commonest presenting symptom. Alterations in muscle weakness and sensation were observed in 40% and 27% of patients respectively.\n\nPredisposing conditions were present in 16 patients, including previous bacteraemia, haematological malignancy, diabetes, immunosuppression and recent surgery The C reactive protein and white cell count were raised in 22 and 12 patients respectively.\n\nMicrobiological investigations were carried out on 21 patients including culture of blood, intervertebral disc aspirates, urine and occasionally staphylococcal serology. Staphylococcus aureus. was isolated from eleven patients and single isolates of Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida glabrata were also grown. Flucloxacillin and fusidic acid was the most common antibiotic regime used. Other treatment regimes were guided by the susceptibilities of any organism isolated.\n\nMagnetic resonance is the most sensitive and specific method of imaging for detection of discitis. Microbiological investigation of patients in order to isolate the causative organism is critical to the successful and timely outcome of treatment. It was concluded that any patient with localised spinal pain in the presence of risk factors, particularly when accompanied by fever and raised CRP, must be investigated for discitis by magnetic resonance imaging. Fusobacterium necrophorum is a associated with serious infections usually in previously healthy young people causing a condition known as Lemierre's disease. It is also associated with serious infections in animals causing a condition known as necrobacillosis. This organism has been split into two sub-species known as F. necrophorum s.s. necrophorum and F. necrophrum s.s. funduliforme, sometimes referred to as biotypes A and B respectively. The literature states that biotype A is mostly associated with disease in animals and biotype B with human infection although no large-scale investigation of human isolates has been performed to substantiate this.\n\nThe Anaerobe Reference Laboratory has a large collection of isolates of F. necrophorum referred for identification from cases of human infection, however sub-typing has not been routinely performed. The present paper describes subtyping investigations of 98 isolates of F. necrophorum from human infections based on chick-cell agglutination, alkaline phosphatase and some preliminary PCR-RFLP profiles that appear to differentiate between the two sub-species.\n\nProvisional results based on the production of alkaline phosphatase indicate 64/98 (65%) unexpectedly belong to sub-species necrophorum (biotype A). The results of further confirmatory tests will be presented. Introduction: At the present, several drug-resistant community acquired infections are causing global concern. This includes emerging entero pathogenic and toxic E. coli and Shigella organisms transmitted by untreated water and unhygenically prepared foods. The study that has been going on for 14 years in Kenya shows the breakdown of public health facilities, use of untreated water, poverty resulting in unhygienic housing and misuse of antibiotics in trying to treat enteric pathogens thus increasing the mortality and morbidity especially on HIV/AIDS people. This shows that although the current enterotoxigenic E. coli are sensitive to new introduced quinolones and cephalosporions, these drugs kill the bacteria but they are not effective on already produced toxins in patients gut. This calls for a new approach to control spread and managing toxin-producing food poisoning agents and neutralize toxins produced. Agents, which are able to neutralize toxins, should be combined with effective antibiotics.\n\nMethod: From 1983, food poisoning agents were investigated during the outbreak in Kenya. Sensitivity was done, toxin produced was investigated, and model of transmission was studied. Health providers were advised on drugs to use for management i.e. antibiotics with toxin neutralizing agents (attapulgite) and those without.\n\nResult: From 1983, new food poisoning toxin producing agents have been discovered and added to conventional ones, thus making management of food poisoning more expensive and difficult. These organisms continued, developing resistance to new drugs through plasmid resistant factors. Food poisoning due to toxigenic agents (E. coli) responded better with antibiotics combined with activated attapulgite (magnesium aluminum silicate). This is a chemical that has a high absorbent power to neutralize toxins produced. Those treated with antibiotics continued to have stomachache and constipation.\n\nRecommendations: Our study shows that antibiotics with attapulgite are one of the cheapest drugs for food poisoning due to food and water borne toxin-producing agent. Eating freshly prepared food is recommended for HIV/AIDS and non-HIV/AIDS people. Raw foods (salads) are not safe in low-resource countries. Treating water at 'Point of use' using sodium hypochlorite is the best solution to controlling food poisoning diseases in low-resources countries. We are not aware of evidence-based guidelines on the duration of iv antibiotics for bone and joint infection, but have experience in the use of initial iv followed by oral (po) antibiotics and suspect that this approach to management is used widely in the UK. Recommended use of po antibiotics by other Medical Microbiologists in this country and knowledge of treatment guidelines with respect to orthopaedic infection was investigated, to determine whether 6 weeks iv therapy is still considered standard practice for orthopaedic infection.\n\nMethod: A questionnaire about antibiotic recommendations for defined orthopaedic infections, knowledge of published guidelines and availability of local OHPAT was sent 271 microbiologists in the British Isles and Ireland.\n\nResults: 94 (35%) questionnaires were returned. Oral antibiotics are recommended in treatment of MSSA osteomyelitis and septic arthritis by 94% and 91% of those responding. 60% recommend iv to oral switch for MRSA osteomyelitis and 64% during 2-stage replacement of a prosthetic knee infection. 74% microbiologists responding were unaware of evidence-based guidelines on duration of iv antibiotics for orthopaedic infections. 36% had access to OHPAT locally.\n\nConclusions: Despite traditional use of 4-6 weeks parenteral therapy for bone and joint infection, there is a lack of evidencebase for this and oral antibiotics are commonly recommended by Medical Microbiologists in the management of these infections in this country. Early oral switch therapy may be one reason why OHPAT has not become as widely established in the UK as it is in USA. Faecal specimens yielded no MOTT but 13 (6%) were positive on culture for M. tuberculosis, pertaining to 12 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis of which 11(92%) were male. The mean age of cases detected by faecal mycobacterial culture was 51 (S.D. \u00bc 12) years.\n\nIn 4 (31%) cases of tuberculosis detected by faecal culture, M. tuberculosis grew either from faeces prior to its detection in respiratory specimens or was identifiable from patients in whom it was impossible to obtain respiratory specimens.\n\nConclusion: Culture of faecal specimens for mycobacteria is noninvasive and can provide microbiological confirmation of infection with M. tuberculosis, an antibiotic sensitivity profile and guide decisions regarding choice and duration of therapy in patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis when respiratory specimens are unobtainable. Results: All three cases had evidence of I.E. on echocardiogram. Group G Streptococcus was isolated from blood cultures in one case. In the other two cases blood cultures were taken after antibiotics had been commenced. Streptococcus milleri was isolated from pus drained from a brain abscess in one of these cases. All required multidisciplinary input to optimise management. All three cases responded to antibiotic treatment.\n\nConclusions: There is a need for clinicians in all disciplines to appreciate and be vigilant for the various clinical manifestations of I.E. The correct management is essential for a favourable outcome. The microbiologist can play a key role in ensuring appropriate investigations, prompt diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach. Introduction: Once-daily gentamicin (5 mg/kg) combined with piperacillin/tazobactam, is an established regimen for the treatment of pseudomonal infection in the critically ill. It is also known that, due to variable pharmacokinetics in septic patients, there is a wide dose range of gentamicin to achieve appropriate serum levels. We reviewed its use in our intensive care unit (ICU) from 1996 to 2000.\n\nMethods: Exclusion criteria were age over 85 years, serum creatinine .200 mmol/l and recent nephrotoxic chemotherapy. Serum trough levels were measured 18-24 hours after first dose, then on alternate days if the serum level was , 1 mg/l. Gentamicin was discontinued if the level was above 2 mg/l. The dose was halved if the level was 1-2 mg/l.\n\nAll gentamicin assays on the laboratory database were reviewed and patient notes retrospectively analysed to identify risk factors including age, inotrope dependency, renal support, chronic renal disease and nephrotoxic drugs.\n\nResults: 352 gentamicin assays were performed (202 patients). 250 levels (71%) were satisfactory (,1 mg/l) while 67 (19%) were in the range 1-2 mg/l and 36 (10%) were .2 mg/l. 21 of the 36 levels (55%) .2 mg/l were from patients receiving inotropes and 18 (50%) from patients receiving intravenous frusemide. In this group, two patients had chronic renal disease and two were receiving haemoflitration.\n\n75% of the significantly raised levels were from patients with one or more of these risk factors.\n\nThere was no difference between the mean age of the patients with normal gentamicin levels (66.7 years) and those with raised levels (66.9 years).\n\nConclusions: Once-daily gentamicin therapy is safe in critically ill patients, although 10% of trough levels are significantly raised, compared with 5.3% in a previous review of neutropaenic patients. Risk factors for elevated levels are common in the ICU, and close individual monitoring of gentamicin therapy is always indicated. Detailed analysis of these MRSA isolates highlighted a number of unusual traits. Notably, these strains displayed a distinctive antibiogram (resistant to methicillin, fusidic acid and erythromycin, but susceptible to ciprofloxacin) and were lysed by a broad range of phages (13 of 27). Genotypic analyses revealed the presence of genes encoding enterotoxins A and H, and the strains were classified as SCCmec type 1 and agr group 3. Preliminary MLST data suggest they are of sequence type 1. In addition, Sma I profiles by PFGE showed all isolates to be indistinguishable from each other.\n\nThe data suggest that these strains represent a single clone which appears to have a predilection for IDUs, but which is quite distinct from currently prevalent healthcare-associated MRSA in the UK. The geographical and temporal distribution of the strains (.2 years) does not suggest a drug contamination problem. These findings indicate the need for a systematic investigation into the natural history, pathogenicity and epidemiology of this clone. We describe the investigation and treatment of a family in Glasgow with recurrent skin abscesses. In March 2000 the initial patient, a 15 year old girl, presented with a 4 month history of recurrent skin abscesses affecting her trunk, limbs and face. Swabs taken from these abscesses grew S. aureus sensitive to flucloxacillin. The patient was treated with numerous courses of antibiotics but her abscesses recurred after completion of each course. At this time five other family household members were also found to have S. aureus associated recurrent skin abscesses.\n\nPulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) samples of all isolates were indistinguishable and this strain was also found to contain the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene. All family members were treated with all over body washing (Aquasept liquid), mupirocin for nasal decolonisation and twice daily chlohexidine spray to eradicate oral colonisation. The household was also professionally cleaned using Trigene on floors, hard surfaces, toilets, window ledges and door handles. Underwear and bedding was machine washed on a daily basis. It is now over a year since this intervention and there have been no further reports of staphylococcal infection.\n\nAggressive management of the patients and reduction in the environmental load of S. aureus did break the cycle of recurrent infection. This strain was also found to contain the PVL gene that has been associated with recurrent furunculosis in patients. Organisms usually considered as skin or oral commensals were also identified, particularly coagulase negative staphylococci (33%) and diphtheroid species (10%). These may reflect blood culture contamination or unhygienic injecting technique or drug use paraphernalia.\n\nThe spectrum of organisms identified in bacteraemic IDUs in Northeast Glasgow is similar to that seen in American cities. Interestingly bacteraemic IDUs are older than the general IDU population in Northeast Glasgow which suggests an association between duration of drug use and the severity of the septic complications. This increased risk of bacteraemic complications may be explained by them having to resort to skin and muscle popping as their venous access is lost. Teicoplanin, a bactericidal glycopeptide, plays an important role against Grampositive bacterial infections. Monitoring teicoplanin levels is currently not a routine practice due to a variety of reasons. The UK recommendation suggests that therapeutic monitoring may optimise dose and serum trough level should not be less than 10 mg/l. Recently several studies revealed a substantial proportion of studied populations had a concentration of less than 10 mg/l under the standard dosage, raising a concern that some of the patients may not have been properly treated. However, It can be argued that vast majority of patients had a concentration above MIC of 4 mg/l. The aim of this study was to examine the difference of clinical responses between the patients with serum trough level 4-10 mg/l and those having level of more than 10 mg/l. Clinical responses were assessed changes of body temperature, WCC and CRP around five days after starting administration. So far 48 patients have been studied, 3 patients (6.3%) had serum trough levels less than 4 mg/l and were not included in the data analysis, Group A with levels of 4 -10 mg/l had 17 (35.4%) patients and Group B with levels greater than 10 mg/l had 28 (58.3%) patients. The mean concentration in group A was 7.3 mg/l with a standard deviation of 1.5; whereas the mean was 27.2 mg/l and 21.3 respectively in group B. A significant difference was observed in WCC change between the two groups, with 72.7% in group A and 22.2% in group B, showing a reduction in WCC; whereas no significant change was noticed in CRP between the groups. On the whole there was no difference of clinical response between patients with a serum level of 4-10 mg/l and those with more than 10 mg/l. The study is on going and more patients and longer observation time arrive at a conclusion. A 45 year old woman underwent an uncomplicated lumbosacral discectomy (L5, S1). Five days later, she was admitted with severe back pain. X-rays were unhelpful. A presumptive diagnosis of post-operative wound infection was made. Intravenous (iv) vancomycin and oral rifampicin were started, empirically. There was no clinical improvement and after two weeks she was transferred to our institution. On presentation, her maximum temperature was 39 8C, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 128 mm/hr and C reactive protein (CRP) was 221 mg/l. At reoperation, pus and fragments of disc were removed. Five of five intra-operative specimens were positive for Enterobacter on culture. A diagnosis of Enterobacter osteomyelitis was made. Vancomycin and rifampicin were discontinued and she received two weeks of amikacin 1 g, daily plus meropenem 2 g, three times daily. There was dramatic improvement clinically. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) was inserted and the patient was discharged to receive ertapenem, 1 g iv once daily for a further four weeks. On completion of her intravenous therapy the ESR was 24 mm/hr and CRP was 27 mg/l. She is currently receiving a further six weeks of oral ciprofloxacin 750 mg, twice daily.\n\nIn conclusion, ertapenem, a once daily infusion, is an attractive option for outpatient and home iv antibiotic services as it can be easily delivered. Few examples exist to support its use for bone infection, however. Methods: A prospective clinical study collected data on cases of MOE over 1 year to determine clinical features, imaging findings, microbiology, response to therapy and complications.\n\nResults: 5 patients (4 male, 1 female) age range 61-75 years were seen. Clinical features included ear pain, cranial nerve palsies, dysphagia and meningitis. Predisposing factors including steroids, diabetes, otitis externa, ear syringing and ENT surgery were present in all cases. Inflammatory markers were raised in all patients. MRI scanning revealed inflammatory masses or abscesses. Osteomyelitis occurred in the skull base or cervical spine of 2 patients. Delays in diagnosis were common. All patients responded to a course of at least 6 weeks of dual antipseudomonal antibiotics. One patient with meningitis needed VP shunting for hydrocephalus.\n\nConclusions: MOE is a serious condition and delays in diagnosis and use of inadequate antibiotic therapy are common allowing the development of complications such as cranial nerve palsies or osteitis. The diagnosis should be carefully considered in patients with ear pain and raised inflammatory markers and a history of predisposing factors sought. MRI scanning and subsequent microbiological sampling of inflammatory masses should be undertaken. Treatment with at least 6 weeks of combined antipseudomonal antibiotics is required to effect a cure. Neurosurgical intervention may be required for complications. Background: There has been a resurgence of serious invasive group A streptococcal infections amongst injecting drug users in Brighton. Aims. This study was undertaken to see whether there was a difference in toxin genotyping of Group A streptococci (GAS) blood culture isolates from injecting drug users (IDU) compared with similar blood culture isolates from the local community in Brighton.\n\nMethods: GAS isolates were grown overnight in Todd-Hewitt broth at 37 8C. The cells were spun down and genomic DNA extracted. All the isolates were toxin genotyped by PCR with specific primers. Toxin genes amplified included those encoding streptococcal superantigens streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA), streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C (SPEC) and streptococcal mitogencic exotoxin Z (SMEZ). All isolates were also checked for the presence of the mf/Dnase B gene (also known as spef) and M serotype/emm type.\n\nResults: 95.6% (22/23) of control GAS isolates from the community were SPEA positive compared with 30% (7/23) of IDU GAS isolates. Data for other toxin genes including SPEC and SMEZ will be presented. As expected all the GAS in both IDUs and controls possessed the mf gene.\n\nIn the IDU isolates, M typing revealed a higher number of GAS with M82 and M87 types and in one case a new emm type was found.\n\nConclusion: GAS isolates from IDU blood cultures are distinct from those isolated from the non-IDU population. In addition to the recently reported prevalence of higher M types in IDU, carriage of the SPEA gene in the community GAS isolates is much greater than isolates from IDUs. Aims: To investigate the microbiology and epidemiology of a cluster of MRSA bacteraemias in the local IVDU population.\n\nMethods: Sensitivity testing of S aureus isolates was performed to BSAC recommendations.\n\nMRSA isolates were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and molecular work was carried out to determine the Staphylococcal chromosomal cassette type (SCCmec). A case note review was performed to ascertain epidemiological differences between IVDU with MRSA and those with MSSA. We report our experience of debridement accompanied by a closed double lumen suction irrigation system, modified from that described by Lautenbach and inserted intraosseously. Objectives: The primary aim of the current study was to identify any bacterial species detected within OSCC tumour tissue by a combination of cultural and molecular techniques.\n\nMethods: At the time of surgery 1 cm 3 specimens were collected by aseptic technique from deep within the tumour. Surface decontamination of tissue specimens was performed by immersion in Betadine. Specimens were subsequently bisected: Half of each was aseptically macerated, resuspended in PBS and cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on nonselective media. The remainder of each specimen was digested with proteinase K, subjected to DNA extraction, and analysed by a nested PCR-DGGE technique using universal primers. Bacteria detected by both methods were identified by 16S rDNA sequence analysis.\n\nResults: A diversity of bacterial species including gram positive and negative, facultative and anaerobic species were isolated and identified using both methods. The PCR-DGGE approach detected the presence of additional species over and above those isolated by culture. Negative results from cultural and PCR analysis of washes of the tumour specimens signified that surface decontamination was successful and that the bacteria detected were from within the tumour tissue.\n\nConclusions: A diversity of bacterial groups has been isolated from within the tissue of oral squamous carcinoma by culture and molecular means. The significance of these bacteria within the tumour tissue warrants further study. Results: A total of 394 sets of blood cultures were received in the laboratory from the liver unit during the study period. 31 (8%) were positive with 36 different organisms isolated. The most frequent isolate was coagulase-negative staphylococci (20/36, 55%) with gram-negative bacilli being next most common (13/36, 36%). Just over half (53%) of the isolates were deemed to be clinically significant. Sources of the significant organisms were intra-abdominal (11/19, 58%), catheter-related (7/19, 37%) and wound infection (1/19, 5.3%). Of the gram-negative isolates, 12/13 were considered clinically significant. Nine of these isolates (67%) were resistant to cefuroxime.\n\nConclusions: As expected in a cohort of patients with liver disease, the most common sources of significant blood culture isolates were intra-abdominal and catheter-related. Of particular concern, two-thirds of the gram-negative organisms were resistant to cefuroxime, which is routinely prescribed in these patients. Clinical details are being reviewed with a view to possible change of the antibiotic policy in the unit.\n\nIsolates of Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrumlactamase were identified from clinical specimens of three patients resident in a surgical ward. A fourth isolate was obtained from another patient in the ITU, on a different floor of the hospital. Serotyping, antibiogram and pulse-field gel electrophoresis, following digestion with restriction endonucleases Xbal, were performed. The isolates were indistinguishable by all three typing techniques.\n\nInitially, there appeared to be no connection between the three patients on the surgical ward and the fourth who had never been admitted there. However, a detailed review of all four patients revealed that patient 2 had been briefly in the adjacent bed to patient 4 whilst on the ITU for post-operative care.\n\nThe spread of multi-resistant organisms is facilitated by the practice of patient movement from ward to ward. It is essential to limit the unnecessary movement of patients who are colonized or infected with multi-resistant bacteria in order to effectively control nosocomial transmission. The production of Extended-Spectrum Beta-lactamases (ESBLs) by Enterobacteriaceae poses a therapeutic problem, as these organisms can be associated with severe illness, such as pneumonia and meningitis. This compromises the use of third generation cephalosporins as empirical first line therapy in these conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate how well routine sensitivity tests predict ESBL production.\n\n50 E. coli and 50 Klebsiella spp. from blood cultures were tested for ESBL production using double disc synergy tests and combination disk tests. Routine sensitivity testing in the clinical laboratory was by a breakpoint method, which included ceftazidime as the representative third generation cephalosporin.\n\nOverall, the proportions of ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella spp. were 2% and 20% respectively. Routine testing detected 10/11 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (sensitivity 91%, specificity 99%). While only 18% of the total isolates were taken from medically intensive environments, 45% of ESBLpositive isolates came from such an environment.\n\nESBL-producing pathogens may appear to be susceptible to third generation cephalosporins in vitro, whilst being resistant in vivo.\n\nOur results confirm that organisms resistant to the screening cephalosporin should be assumed to be ESBL-producers and confirmatory tests undertaken. ESBL detection from highrisk patients and locations must be actively sought and not opportunistically gleaned. This may involve including two screening two different third generation cephalosporins in routine sensitivity testing, or testing specifically for ESBLs for isolates from high-risk units/patients. Methods: Data on patient admissions were collected from hospital computer records and infectious disease notification forms. A retrospective survey of hospital staff was carried out using a face-to-face structured questionnaire. Conclusions: Hospital staff accounted for more cases of gastroenteritis than any other unit and the operational effectiveness of the hospital was put at risk by this outbreak. Further studies and changes to working practices have been initiated to prevent and control similar outbreaks in the future. Methods: Data on patient admissions were collected from hospital computer records and infectious disease notification forms. In the early stages of the outbreak, patients were asked about exposure to specific risk factors.\n\nResults: Over a one month period there were 2065 hospital presentations, of which 1466 (71%) were referred to physicians, of which 1340 (91%) were due to gastroenteritis, of which 975 (73%) required hospital admission. Rates of admission for gastroenteritis were initially high at 92%, but reduced with time to 13%. Average length of stay for gastroenteritis patients was 1.65 days, which led to 1605 bed-days being occupied and bed occupancy rates in the hospital reached .90%. Hospital staff accounted for 36% of all gastroenteritis cases.\n\nThe epidemic curve of all gastroenteritis cases showed a rapid increase followed by a biphasic reduction, whereas that for hospital staff cases showed a more rapid decrease. 43% of cases amongst non-hospital staff came from just 3 local units. Risk factors for gastroenteritis amongst these patients included having affected colleagues (83%), eating fresh fruit (52%), using centralised catering (47%), poor hand-washing facilities (45%) and eating pasteurised yoghurt (43%). Units with the most cases had higher than average exposure to these risk factors. Stool investigations revealed the presence of caliciviruses only.\n\nConclusions: Gastroenteritis was a major cause of morbidity during this operation and may have had an impact on the operational effectiveness of those units affected. Further studies and changes to working practices have been initiated to prevent and control similar outbreaks in the future. Twelve patients, 12/283 (4.2%) were infected with B. cepacia complex, of these eight were BCC genomovar II, one genomovar IIIb and one genomovar IV and in two the type was unknown.\n\nTwenty-seven patients (27/283, 10%) had Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and 13 patients (13/283, 5%) had Alcaligienes spp. isolated from sputum respectively, figures compatible with a multi-centre study in the United States. 3 Of note one patient was sputum culture positive for Pandorea pulmonicola, a recently described non fermenting Gram negative rod with possible transmissibility and pathogenic potential.\n\nDuring the study period two patients were culture positive on more than three occasions for atypical mycobacteria, one with Mycobacterium abscessus and the other with M. avium intracellulare, however the number of patients for whom mycobacterial sputum culture was performed is unknown.\n\nScedosporium apiospermum, an unusual fungal isolate which is amphoteracin resistant has been isolated in two patients. This organism may have implications for lung transplantation.\n\nOngoing surveillance of lower respiratory tract infection in cystic fibrosis patients is essential. P. aeruginosa remains one of the leading pathogens in cystic fibrosis and problems with emerging antibiotic resistance, and outbreaks of infection 4,5,6 with this organism emphasise the importance of surveillance, access to molecular epidemiological typing to detect and control outbreaks, and the development and use of reliable, reproducible sensitivity testing methods (including synergy testing) to guide treatment. p The definition used was 'two or more resistant strains' to allow for possibility of faulty disc or transcription error. Objective: Uniform standardised methods are advocated to improve standards of recovery of organisms. A five year, 4 laboratory, quarterly measured review of recovery rates of pathogens using agreed standard exclusion criteria was conducted to assess if there was a detectable improvement with adoption of standard methods or whether there were significant changes in denominator based recovery rates suggesting a change in epidemiology.\n\nMethods: Laboratory computers were retrospectively interrogated on an isolate and sometimes patient basis to detect changes in recovery rates. This was correlated with adoption times for PHLS standard methods. Regression lines for trends with time were plotted and compared with changes assessed only from numerators.\n\nResults: Reductions in prevalence of Salmonella were highly correlated and quantitatively similar in all laboratories. Staph aureus and Campyobacter isolation rates were similar for all laboratories and stable. Serially increased prevalence of MRSA as a proportion of S. aureus was detected but differed in timing between laboratories. Method problems with Clostridium difficile and Haemophilus influenzae were detected. C. difficile methodology has not been standardised between laboratories and H. influenzae isolation rate change rose in one laboratory because of an increase in sensitivity associated with decreased dilution. Inter-laboratory and intralaboratory variation in detection of anaerobes continued after the adoption of standard methods. There were continuing inter-laboratory but stable variations in isolation rates for haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis declined in all laboratories.\n\nWith the exception of a changed sensitivity for Haemophilus influenzae there was no evidence that standardisation improved organism recovery rates in 4 laboratories over 5 years. However, denominator based data revealed difficulties with methods and unexplained stable differences between laboratories in organism recovery rate. Denominator based data is suitable for use in comparative internal quality control and assessment and also for detecting changes in organism epidemiology. The purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) inhibits colonisation with MRSA.\n\nMethods: MRSA and MSSA were isolated from 753 routine screening nasal swabs collected over a six months period and identified using standard laboratory methods. The difference in the observed number of patient swabs with co-colonisation was compared with that expected assuming no interference between MSSA and MRSA.\n\nResults: Results from 680 routine patient screening swabs were available for analysis. There was a significant trend for carriage of MRSA with increasing age, and in males compared with females. One hundred and fifteen patient swabs were colonized with MSSA alone, and 56 with MRSA alone. Both MRSA and MSSA were isolated from only four nasal swabs which was significantly less than expected \u00f0p \u00bc 0:021\u00de: The potential impact of different rates of colonisation with MSSA on the epidemiology of MRSA is illustrated using mathematical modelling. Aim: To conduct an analysis of adherence and biofilm forming capacity of five S. epidermidis isolates associated with neurosurgical device-related infection.\n\nMethods: Isolates were screened for the presence of the ica operon with a PCR assay. Using a microtitre plate assay, biofilmforming capacity was evaluated under standard laboratory and stress-inducing conditions (growth at 42 8C, in 4% NaCl and 4%EtOH) Cell surface hydrophobicity, zeta potential and adherence of isolates to silicone discs during both logarimethic and stationary phase was measured under the above conditions.\n\nResults: Three isolates contained the ica operon. Two isolates (one ica positive) remained biofilm-negative under all conditions. Of the remaining three isolates, one was weakly biofilm forming under standard laboratory conditions and all could be induced to form strong biofilm under stress-inducing conditions. Induction of biofilm under stress-inducing conditions was associated with increased cell surface hydrophobicity. The surface charge of individual isolates under standard and stressinducing conditions did not correspond to specific adherence or biofilm-forming characteristics. Isolates containing the ica operon showed a tenfold increase in adherence to silicone discs but variations in adherence under stress-inducing conditions did not necessarily correlate with biofilm formation under the same conditions.\n\nThe presence of the ica operon was associated with increased adherence to biomaterials but was not necessarily sufficient for biofilm formation. Cell surface hydrophobicity may play a role in initial adherence. Understanding the surface properties and adherence characteristics of staphylococci may assist in the development of biomaterials that are more resistant to bacterial adhesion. Over a nine month period in an eight-bedded ICU 26 patients were investigated for suspected CRBSI, and had one or more positive blood cultures. Of the 14 where both central and peripheral cultures were received simultaneously and were positive, 9 had DTP .2 hours and in a further 3 DTP was .1 hour. In two of these, however, an alternative source for the bacteraemia could be found, and in one the bacteraemia persisted following line removal. Over a three month period we calculated the number of patient catheter days and the number of patient days. Although catheter days was consistently lower than patient days, there was a linear relationship between the two.\n\nThese data suggest that paired central and peripheral cultures with assessment of DTP may be helpful in the diagnosis of CRBSI in the ICU setting, although they do not always exclude other sources. For the calculation of infection rates, catheter days provides the most accurate denominator, but patient days may be an acceptable and simpler alternative. MRSA is an important cause of bacteraemia. Recent surveillance data in England has shown that over 40% of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteraemias are caused by MRSA. This has major implications for the choice of antibiotic therapy, but results of identification and susceptibility testing of blood cultures can take two days or more.\n\nWe have looked at the use of a rapid method of detecting MRSA in blood cultures at the time of detection of positivity of the culture, using an automated blood culture detection system and at the impact that this might have on choice of antibiotic therapy.\n\nIn a retrospective study, 108 positive blood cultures were used to evaluate the Roche Light cycler mecA and staphylococcal PCR.\n\nBlood cultures previously demonstrated to be positive were recultured and, in addition, an aliquot of culture broth was extracted using the MagNAPure kit and the PCR reaction performed.\n\nOf 74 samples containing coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) alone, 60 gave a compatible PCR result while 14 were either negative or showed some inhibition. Of 10 samples containing MRSA alone, 10 gave a compatible PCR result. In 2 cases where the culture was mixed MRSA and CNS, one gave an equivocal result and one was positive only for CNS (mecA positive).\n\nOverall, sensitivity and specificity for detection of MRSA were 83% and 99%.\n\nIn a retrospective analysis of 50 staphylococcal bacteraemias, details were collected about clinical advice given at the time of initial culture positivity and compared with appropriate advice in the light of the identification and sensitivity results. In 24 (48%), the correct management was advised at the time of initial positivity. In 17 (34%), an unnecessary antibiotic was recommended and in 9 cases (18%), the appropriate antibiotic was not recommended.\n\nUsing this method of rapid detection is sensitive and specific and can give a result within 5 hours. This could significantly impact on clinical practice, guiding appropriate management. It could also decrease laboratory workload by identifying insignificant isolates before further culture occurs. Bacteraemia in patients with non-tunnelled central venous catheters (CVC) was measured using a denominator of patient catheter days. A computerized coding system was used to identify catheterised patients.\n\nMethods: A computerized procedure coding system identified patients who had CVC inserted over a six month period. Patient's notes were reviewed and those with bacteraemia identified from the laboratory database. CVCs in use for less than 48 hours were not included when measuring the rate of infection.\n\nResults: 191 CVCs were inserted of which 96 (50.3%) were placed as emergencies. Over half of the lines were in place for fewer than 7 days, mean duration was 6.9 days. 79 (41.4%) CVCs were inserted in critical areas, 86 (45%) were inserted on general wards and 26 (13.6%) in Theatres. Of the 106 lines where reasons for removal was documented 20 (19%) were removed due to infection. The sum life span of the CVCs was 1241 days. Ten episodes of bacteraemia were identified. The overall CVC associated bacteraemia rate was 8.1 catheter days. In each episode the same organism was also grown from the line tip. 60 (31%) line tips were submitted for culture. 34 yielded a significant growth of bacteria.\n\nConclusions: The rate of bacteraemia was higher than many published surveillance systems. UK data of hospital acquired bacteraemia exists, but does not record rates per catheter days. The method used here allows the calculations of this more useful rate as opposed to numbers of catheters infected. The rate measured total bacteraemias, not just primary line associated infections. The computerized coding system failed to record all the lines inserted; missing many critical care episodes. Retrospective review was time consuming but is likely to result in accurate bacteraemia rates. The measured rate suggests that locally antimicrobial impregnated lines would be cost effective. Methods: Horizontal surfaces were sampled with contact plates, and air was sampled with a Surface Air Sampler (SAS) and settle plates, twice a week for up to four weeks in the rooms of patients isolated for MRSA in a hospital where MRSA is endemic. All plates were incubated for 48 hours and isolates were identified and antibiotic susceptibility testing performed using standards methods.\n\nResults: The environment of 25 patients (13 males, 12 females) was sampled; 64% of patients were colonized and 36% were infected. A total of 1003 samples were obtained; 502 from horizontal surfaces and 501 air samples (settle plates, 251; SAS, 250). 54% of horizontal surfaces (contact plates) were positive, e.g. 55% of samples from chairs. 34% of air samples were positive; 28% of SAS and 40% of settle plates.\n\nConclusions: A high proportion of environmental samples taken from rooms occupied by patients with MRSA were positive, representing a continuing source of endemic MRSA. Enhanced environmental cleaning and decontamination, especially of horizontal surfaces is required, and will reduce airborne spread as part of an effective programme of MRSA control. Four were thought to have imported the organism from the bone marrow transplant unit where there had been an ongoing outbreak. The remaining nine cases were therefore acquired on the critical care unit. Most had ventilator associated pneumonia. The epidemiology of the outbreak was investigated. Isolates were genotyped using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and risk factors associated with acquisition were identified by means of a case-control study.\n\nExtensive environmental screening was undertaken revealing multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa to be colonising the majority of the hand-wash basin drains. All clinical and environmental isolates collected were indistinguishable by PFGE. Review of ward practices revealed that respiratory equipment, including tracheostomy tubing, was routinely rinsed at the bedside handwash basins. Five patients had acquired the organism without overlap with other known cases suggesting an environmental reservoir. The case \u00f0n \u00bc 9\u00de control \u00f0n \u00bc 48\u00de study identified a number of significant risk factors such as: length of stay, presence of tracheostomy, ventilation .24 hours, and prior anti-pseudomonal therapy. After multivariate analysis however, only presence of a tracheostomy remained significant \u00f0p \u00bc 0:04\u00de: This is consistent with the theory that transmission of multiresistant P. aeruginosa from the environment to the patients occurred during tracheostomy care.\n\nA number of control measures were employed to control the outbreak with some success. These included enhanced hand hygiene using alcohol gel, regular disinfection of sinks with hypochlorite and a change in practice of tracheostomy care. Introduction: Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of hospital acquired bacteraemia causing significant morbidity and mortality with the majority of episodes secondary to intravascular devices (IVD). This study focused on the IVD type, complications and outcome of all episodes of IVD related Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in SEHB, Ireland incorporating one regional and three general hospitals over a nine month period.\n\nMethod: A prospective study was carried out over a nine month period from 1/08/02 to 30/04/03 and information obtained on all episodes of IVD related Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemias.\n\nResults: There were 42 episodes of IVD related Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia over the nine month period with peripheral venous device as the source in 12 episodes, central venous device as the source in 14 episodes and permcath device as the source in 16 episodes. Metastatic complications occurred in 4 patients and death directly related to the Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia occurred in 5 patients.\n\nConclusion: This prospective study led to a three month programme focusing on the revision and implementation of guidelines for insertion and management of intravascular devices with subsequent surveillance currently ongoing. Methods: All microbiology specimens from UHL patients yielding MRSA were selected from the pathology computerised database. Susceptibility pattern over time, specimen site and hospital site were analysed. Macrolide prescribing information was obtained from the pharmacy department.\n\nResults: A total of 5934 patients had MRSA during this period. The proportion of MRSA sensitive to erythromycin (ES strains) in hospital A increased from 17% to 43%, in hospital B from 0 to 17% and at hospital C from 4% to 29%. Over all the three hospitals the change was an increase from 6% to 26%. The proportion of ES strains isolated from sterile sites (blood cultures, CSF etc) increased from 4% to 17%. Susceptibility testing methods have remained unchanged over this period. Total macrolide usage has increased over this period. A limited number of ES strains were phage typed. All were EMRSA 15. The annual number of new MRSA positive patients increased slightly from 1056 in 1998/99 to 1295 in 2002/3.\n\n: Surprisingly, an increasing proportion of MRSA isolates in our Trust are susceptible to macrolides. Paradoxically, increases in erythromycin susceptibility occurred at the same time as an increase in macrolide prescribing. The increase in the proportion of invasive MRSA susceptible to erythromycin was similar to the overall change in erythromycin susceptibility. Thus there was no evidence to support a claim of increased invasive potential of ES strains as an explanation for the change in resistance. Methods: A retrospective review of actions taken in response to SARS at a multi-site 1300 bedded Trust with over 5000 employees and an evaluation of outcomes and effectiveness.\n\nResults: 5 patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for SARS were admitted over a 3-week period. No cases were subsequently confirmed. Many more worried patients and staff were dealt with in A&E or by telephone consultation. The Infectious Diseases (ID) team admitted the first case to the ID unit on 30/3/03. A SARS policy was written by the Infection Control Team (ICT) recommending the initial management giving clear instructions about referral/admission pathways, infection control precautions and Occupational Health advice for staff. Information was reviewed daily and the policy was redrafted as necessary. There was close liaison between Occupational Health, ID, Infection Control, Microbiology, and Human Resources. Educational sessions were arranged for staff. Planned recruitment of nurses from Singapore was postponed. The Infection Control Doctor participated in a web-based chat on the hospital's Intranet site, which allowed open discussion and alleviated fears. An Occupational Health hotline was set up for staff at the Trust with any work related or travel query. Background: Between March and May 2002, we noticed an increased isolation of multi-antibiotic resistant E. cloacae strains from 6 ventilated patients in our 9-bedded ICU, 55% of isolates caused invasive infections. All strains were resistant to gentamicin and broad-spectrum cephalosporins, most were quinolone and carbapenem sensitive.\n\nObjectives and Methods: To phenotype a representative sample of 36 isolates of E. cloacae using API and antibiogram analysis, to estimate the percentage of isolates carrying extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESbLs), to genotype all strains of E. cloacae using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of macro-restricted chromosomal DNA to establish if there was a single dominant clone or several clones involved in this outbreak. All test strains demonstrated the presence of ESbLs by the Mast DD system. A representative sample from each phenotype was subjected to bla-SHV PCR using SHV-FOR and SHV-REV primers and all four strains were positive for the bla-SHV gene, indicating production of SHV-type enzymes. Restriction endonuclease analysis with Nhe I enzyme on the above amplicons confirmed a point mutation in the SHV structural gene at position 238 (glycine to serine switch) indicating presence of an extended-spectrum SHV-type b-lactamase.\n\nConclusions: This study demonstrates that molecular fingerprinting by PFGE is a useful and reliable epidemiological tool for investigation of outbreaks caused by multi-resistant E. cloacae. It also highlights that acquisition of ESbLs may be one of the alternate mechanisms of multi-antibiotic resistance in E. cloacae strains in addition to chromosomally encoded cephalosporinases. Methods: Retrospective analysis of presumptively infected prosthetic joints undergoing radiological biopsy to aid diagnosis in patients managed in a specialist musculoskeletal infection unit. Data were obtained by cross-referencing the Microbiology database (Sunquest, Persoft Inc.) with prospective Radiology and Histology databases. Histology was used as the criterion standard for diagnosing infection. Conclusions: Prosthetic joint biopsy is more specific than sensitive for the diagnosis of PJI. Taking multiple samples, and using prolonged culture techniques may improve sensitivity, as the sensitivity of an individual sample is only approximately 20%. We advocate taking at least two biopsy samples for culture, using prolonged incubation, and sending material for histology. The study also highlights difficulties in evaluating diagnostic tests when robust consensus definitions of infection are lacking. This study was carried out to determine accurately the incidence of sternal wound infections and permit their early diagnosis in patients following cardiothoracic surgery.\n\nMethods: A prospective observational study involving assessment of sternal wounds following cardiothoracic surgery for a three-month period was carried out. Wound assessment was based upon a wound scoring system modified from the original scoring system devised by Wilson et al., which included erythema, pain/tenderness, serous discharge, purulent discharge, wound dehiscence and positive microbiology as wound infection criteria. Each criterion was given a score of 5 except purulent discharge and positive microbiology from deep swabs or fluid/tissue, which carried a score of 10. Patients were assessed until they developed wound infection or were discharged from hospital. Risk factors were not investigated because this study was to determine the crude wound infection rate.\n\nResults: 186 patients had cardiothoracic surgery during the above period. 148 had Coronary Artery Bypass Graft operation (CABG) and 27 patients had aortic or mitral valve replacement. One patient had ventricular septal defect closure and one had aortic root replacement. The remaining patients had a combination of procedures. Nine patients were found to have wound infection giving a crude infection rate of 4.8%. The average stay in hospital following surgery was 10 days while mean duration of stay in those who developed wound infection was 32 days. The mean time to diagnose wound infection was 11 days. The microorganisms isolated were methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), coagulase negative staphylococci and Enterococcus spp.\n\nThe crude infection rate in sternal wounds was 4.8%. The modified wound scoring protocol was easy to use and a simple method for detection of wound infection at an early stage. Data collected on 24 808 hip arthroplasties from 102 hospitals in England between 1997 and 2001 were analysed to estimate the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) and strength of association with major risk factors. Demographic, operative and infection data on in-patients was collected prospectively over a four-year period by hospitals participating in the Nosocomial Infection National Surveillance Service (NINSS). Generalised linear models were used to estimate the associations between potential risk factors and SSI after allowing for confounding. The incidence of SSI was 2.2% in primary total hip arthroplasties, 5% in primary hemarthroplasties, and 3.7% and 7.6% in revision total hip arthroplasties and revision hemiarthroplasties respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was identified in 50% of SSI; 59% of these were methicillin resistant (MRSA). In hemiarthoplasties, MRSA was a causative pathogen in 40% of SSI. Most SSI were superficial (75%), but 9% involved bone or joint. The multivariable regression analysis identified age group, trauma, duration of operation and ASA score as significant independent risk factors for SSI. When these factors were taken into account, type of arthroplasty was not a significant predictor of risk of SSI. After allowing for these factors there was still significant interhospital variation in rates of SSI, which was still evident when the length of post-operative stay was taken into account. Patients undergoing hemarthroplasty are older, have higher ASA scores and are more likely to have surgery as a result of trauma. The variation in incidence of SSI following hip arthroplasty is more likely to be explained by these characteristics than the type of procedure. The variation in incidence of SSI between hospitals is not fully explained by case-mix, but comparisons of rates should take into account significant risk factors. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen in SSI of hip arthroplasty, especially in patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty. Background: The issue of antibiotic prophylaxis for dental work in the presence of a joint prosthesis is controversial. However, advanced dental sepsis requires detection and treatment prior to joint replacement.\n\nMethods: Patients from whom non B-haemolytic streptococcal were recovered from revisions of prosthetic joints over the period 1993-2003 were retrospectively reviewed for predisposing factors.\n\nResults: 9 patients had viridans streptococcal infection detected and confirmed by histology and culture at excision arthroplasty. 9 additional patients were excluded-4 because there was no histological proof of infection and 5 because only a single isolate was made from the infected joint (Oxford Criteria). Five patients had continuing dental sepsis which antedated the last joint replacement: one had pre-existing radiation proctitis. One other patient had mixed coagulase negative staphylococcal and viridans streptococcal infection without evidence of dental sepsis. No patient had endocarditis. Two of the dental patients had had multiple revisions. Mean interval in these patients since last surgery was 7.6 years. All dental patients required multiple dental extractions in the interval between excision and revision arthroplasty. One patient had a broken tooth reported at the time of his last surgery and had received reassurance, one an overt dental abscess fro 15 years, one an occult dental abscess revealed on radiology. Two others had extensive dental caries with blackened stumps as teeth. Follow-up after antibiotic treatment and revision arthroplasty is limited in these cases but results appear satisfactory.\n\nConclusion: Looking in the mouth is now a routine part of assessment prior to primary joint replacement in Oswestry as it would be in a cardiac surgery unit. Patients referred from other centres for revision arthroplasty receive a dental examination if excision arthroplasty cultures yield viridans streptococci. Methods: 32 patients were initially assessed with aspiration of the prosthetic joint for culture, histology, and measurement of inflammatory markers. 22 patients were infected on the basis of neutrophil infiltration at excision arthroplasty with one patient unassessable because of inflammatory joint disease and one because histology was omitted.\n\nResults: 13 of these 22 had microbiologically confirmed infection on aspiration or operative microbiology. 4/6 initial aspirates yielding coagulase-negative staphylococci proved to be false positives as judged by operative histology and culture. Initial aspirates yielded false negative results as assessed by operative culture in 1 patient. 4 Staphylococcus aureus or haemolytic streptococcus recoveries from aspirates were always predictive of histological infection but cultures were often negative due to antibiotics. Mean interval between excision and revision arthroplasty was 100 days. 5 patients grew coagulase-negative staphylococci at the 2nd stage from multiple samples. Three had had negative and one enterococcal infection at excision: one had had previous coagulase-negative staphylococcal infection.\n\nOnly one with previous negative excision cultures but positive aspiration developed infection in the subsequent revision. Five further patients developed signs of infection at follow-up having had negative operative cultures at first and second stage revision. 25 patients had at least 24 month follow up and for the total group follow-up was 12 -46 months. Only one patient has had evidence of recurrence of the organism recovered at initial aspiration or excision arthroplasty and overall a satisfactory outcome was achieved in 78% overall and 90% who had only had a single revision arthroplasty.\n\nConclusion: Vancomycin therapy after excision arthroplasty may be restricted in duration. Bacteriology from aspirates and second stage arthroplasty is a poor guide to definitive aetiology and outcome respectively. Method: A retrospective case note review of a random selection of HIV patients was conducted.143 notes were reviewed (80 GUM and 63 ID).\n\nResults: At least 80% of patients had a sexual history and smoking history taken. 72% of GUM patients were asked about other recreational drugs (46% ID patients). Both departments were poor at recording vaccination histories, past history of tuberculosis and risk factors for heart disease. 59% of GUM patients had a sexual examination and screen for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) performed compared to 19% of ID patients. 63% of ID patients had fundoscopy performed (37% GUM). In both departments approximately 50% of patients had a blood pressure and weight recorded, with less than 20% of patients having teeth examined. Greater than 95% of patients had baseline CD4 counts, viral loads, full blood counts, renal and liver function tests recorded. ID was more likely to perform a chest X-ray, toxoplasmosis and CMV screening, whereas GUM was more likely to perform HSV and VZV screens. Both teams were poor at performing baseline lipids and glucose. More patients were screened for hepatitis B and C in both Departments (with similar results) than for hepatitis A, for which 58% of ID patients and 67% of GUM patients were screened.\n\nConclusions: Some differences exist between the two departments in the approach to the newly diagnosed HIV patient. A universal new patient proforma would aid equality of documentation and care, as well as providing an audit tool in face of new BHIVA guidelines. Background: Outpatient management of HIV infected patients allows for screening of infections and malignancies as well as monitoring disease progression and adherence to treatment. We conducted an audit to review these aspects of care. Conclusions: Substantial differences exist in the approaches to outpatient management and screening between the two departments. Both departments are poor at repeating screening investigations, assessing the risk for sexually transmitted infections and adherence with medications. A 'reminder' proforma will be introduced in both clinics and the outcomes audited again (against the new draft guidelines produced by the British HIV association). Neither the antimalarials nor XR9576 exhibited significant anti-HIV activity compared with SQV (selectivity index 2.5 vs 2716). MQ, but not CQ was able to significantly increase intracellular 3 HSQV at concentrations 300 M \u00f0p \u00bc 0:02\u00de in infected U937 cells. Isobolograms constructed across a range of concentrations revealed antiviral synergy between SQV and MQ (but not SQV and CQ). Finally, the effect of XR9576 on the intracellular accumulation of 3 HSQV was evaluated. XR9576 had no effect upon intracellular SQV concentrations in CEM cells. However, in CEM VBL100 cells (overexpressing P-gp) where the intracellular SQC concentration was diminished, XR9576 was able to almost complete restore intracellular SQV accumulation. I think we are just lucky to get some people to come for their smears without going further down the road.\n\nHealth care staff stated that any increased testing should be accompanied by clear, concise PCT guidance on when and how to test, including how to obtain informed consent and perform contact tracing. Staff felt that testing could be undertaken at family planning clinics or with cervical smears if patients received information before the consultation. Alternatively, in larger practices specific chlamydia clinics could be held.\n\nConclusion: Efforts to increase chlamydia screening in this setting should be accompanied by clear guidance, education and have appropriate financial and staff resources. GUM clinics, or level three practices with GUM expertise, will need to be increased to provide appropriate contact tracing and follow-up. Introduction: Diagnosis of genital herpes is difficult without taking viral swabs at the onset of symptoms. To make this more practical, kits for the self-collection of viral swabs were given to selected patients.\n\nMethod: Kits including a sterile swab and viral medium were distributed to individuals attending a genitourinary medicine clinic with a history suggestive of genital herpes, but in whom diagnosis was proving difficult. Kits were posted to the virus laboratory for analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). By case note review of these 71 patients, information about their characteristics, nature and duration of symptoms, clinical findings on history and examination, and the results of diagnostic tests were analysed using Microsoft excel and SPSS software.\n\nResults: 21/71 patients were diagnosed with HSV type 2 and 7 with HSV type 1. This diagnosis was made by self-collection kit in 20 and by clinic swab in 8. Of these 8, a greater proportion had been symptomatic at the time of first attendance at the clinic (6/8, versus 10/20) and they had been attending longer with their symptoms before being issued with a kit (mean 33.75 versus mean 15.3 weeks). It took longer to reach a diagnosis (mean 10.13 versus mean 7.5 months), with more consultations at the clinic (mean 3.75 versus mean 2.9), but none of these differences were statistically significant. In18 patients alternative diagnoses were made.\n\nConclusions: This study illustrates the difficulties in reaching a diagnosis of genital herpes. Innovative use of diagnostic techniques could improve the management of this debilitating infection. Further work is warranted to investigate the cost effectiveness and acceptability of self-collection kits for diagnosis of HSV. This method is a useful adjunct to testing in the conventional setting and may provide a swifter, more flexible route to diagnosis and management of genital herpes for some individuals. Background: Attendance at STD clinics in Ireland has increased dramatically in recent years. An increase in the incidence of STDs has paralleled this. Attendees aged twenty and under comprise a significant proportion of new infections.\n\nMethods: Between January 1999 and December 2002, all attendees to an STD clinic aged less than twenty were followed, and data recorded on demographics, reasons for attending, diagnoses, and risk behaviour for STDs. Conclusions: People under twenty increasingly availed of this STD clinic. Females comprised the larger part of attendees. Most attended with symptoms rather than for screening. Genital warts remained the commonest reason for assessment, but incidence of Chlamydia appeared to trend upwards. The low level of condom use is of concern. Substance misuse is of concern for sexual and general health. and increased with increasing maternal antibody titre (x 1 2 \u00bc 48, p , 0:001). 15% (145/978) of mothers had detectable HHV8 DNA in saliva (mean viral copy number 488,450 copies/ml, range 1550-660,000); the prevalence was 10% (51/532) in HHV8 seronegative women and 33% (71/216) in women with the highest antibody titres (OR \u00bc 4.6, 95% CI 3.0 -6.9). The prevalence of anti-HHV8 antibodies in children was 15% (109/735) if the mother had no detectable HHV8 in saliva and 28% (12/43) if the mother had a high HHV8 copy number (.50,000) in saliva (OR \u00bc 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.5). Among 43 women with high anti-HHV8 antibody titres, 12 had detectable HHV8 DNA in breast milk, but at lower levels than in saliva (mean viral copy number 5800 copies/ml, range 1550-12,540).Interpretation. We provide evidence of motherto-child transmission of HHV8 and that maternal saliva is a likely route. Commonly, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with herpes simplex (HSV) encephalitis/ meningitis show normal glucose levels. A case of herpes simplex encephalitis with unusually low CSF glucose is presented. We also reviewed 21 previous glucose measurements from 29 HSV PCR positive CSF samples taken between 1996 and 2003. The CSF glucose range was ,1 to 12 mmol/L, with a mean of 3.6, SD 2.5. The ratio of CSF: serum glucose ranged from 0.07 to 0.64 with a mean of 0.46, SD 0.17. One other patient had a CSF glucose of ,1 associated with HSV meningitis. With the advent of molecular diagnostics a wider spectrum of HSV encephalitis/meningitis is now being recognised, and our series suggests that a low CSF glucose value does not rule out this diagnosis. Background: Adult measles is generally an imported infection in the UK. Outbreaks of measles are becoming of increasing concern with reduced uptake of MMR.\n\nCase Report: A 26 year old Indian man was referred to our infection unit with a one week history of fever, cough, diarrhoea and rash. He had returned from India two weeks previously. On admission he was noted to have an erythematous throat, cervical lymphadenopathy, fever and a widespread maculopapular rash on his face, arms, trunk and legs. The rash had initially appeared on his face 24 hours prior to admission. Investigations showed abnormal liver function, a CRP of 59 mg/L, a normal chest X-ray and negative malaria films. There was spontaneous resolution of fever and rash over the next 4 days. Serology for measles showed a positive measles IgM and negative measles IgG and PCR was positive for measles. Convalescent serum showed positive measles IgM and IgG.\n\nNine days after discharge, and prior to the serological diagnosis of the initial patient, his flatmate was admitted with a similar history and clinical findings. Measles was diagnosed serologically. Both patients were students staying in halls of residence. Although a program of screening and vaccination with MMR was employed by public health one further student was admitted with serologically diagnosed measles.\n\nThe diagnosis of measles should be considered in patients with maculopapular rashes. There is increased risk with foreign travel to countries with a high incidence of measles and in patients with no clear history of vaccination. This may become an increasing diagnosis in the UK given the recent controversies over the MMR vaccination program. Noroviruses (NV) are the most common cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis and are of particular concern in healthcare settings. The Dako enzyme immunoassay (EIA) has been shown to have a sensitivity of 55.5% and specificity of 98% for norovirus diagnosis compared to RT-PCR. In this retrospective analysis we evaluated in our laboratory the impact of changing outbreak investigation methods from EM to EIA. We collected and analysed data during 2 consecutive winter seasons 2001 and 2002. During the winter of 2001, 282 faecal specimens from 91 outbreaks were investigated for NV by EM, and 9 (3%) were positive. 155 specimens from 64 outbreaks negative by EM were also examined by RT-PCR and an additional 37 (24%) specimens were found to be positive. The increase in positive cases and consequently the number of outbreaks diagnosed in the second season could be due to the increased sensitivity of the EIA. The noticeable increase in the reporting of NV outbreaks in the United Kingdom during the winter season of 2002-2003 could be explained in part by the fact that many laboratories have probably introduced more sensitive diagnostic methods, i.e. EIA. The EIA is less labour-intensive than EM, could be performed more frequently and has the ability to process more samples, which explains the noticeable reduction in turnaround time between the two seasons. Background & Objectives: Steatosis is common in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and is thought to accelerate disease progression. Viral and host factors reported to influence the formation of steatosis include obesity, age, alcohol consumption and HCV genotype. 1 -3 To address the relative contributions of the virus and host factors we studied 221 patients, 107 of whom were infected with genotype 3, with liver biopsy proven chronic HCV in whom data on all 4 variables was available.\n\nMethods: Retrospective analysis of patients attending the regional Hepatitis C service.\n\nResults: Steatosis was found in 47% of liver biopsies (54% of patients with genotype 3, 40% of patients with genotype 1). In univariate analysis, steatosis correlated with clinical obesity (BMI 30) \u00bdp , 0:01; but not with age, alcohol consumption or HCV genotype. On repeat analysis of patients with BMI , 30 \u00f0n \u00bc 192\u00de; steatosis was significantly associated with genotype 3 \u00f0p , 0:02\u00de:\n\nConclusion: In this large cohort of patients (including 107 patients with genotype 3 infection) steatosis is strongly associated with the host factor of obesity, rather than alcohol consumption. Genotype 3 infection may influence steatosis in individuals who are not clinically obese. Our data indicates that risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) need to be addressed in all patients with chronic HCV. recently emerging disease affecting almost 200 million people world-wide, yet knowledge about previous travel, health, drug adherence, alcohol intake and risk behaviour in the HCV positive (HCV\u00fe ) traveller is limited.\n\nMethods: Prospective questionnaire-based study of patients attending the Joint Hepatitis C Services at Newcastle Hospitals NHS Trust over five week period addressing issues of travel, HCV and risk behaviour (Special Study Module which was limited in time and patient numbers). Conclusion: HCV \u00fe patients are a travelling population, but are often ill prepared. High-risk behaviour including unsafe sex and drug use occurs whilst travelling. To improve the care of HCV \u00fe travellers in the future, pre-travel advice specific to the HCV \u00fe patient should be promoted. In the Spring term of 2003 it became apparent that there was an outbreak of mumps among the 42,000 students in the University of Sheffield and Hallam University, Sheffield. In total 247 cases were seen by health professionals between January and June 2003, 213 being linked to one of the two Universities. The attack rate rose to approximately 1:50 among 18-year-old students. 10% of student cases were hospitalised, the majority being managed in the local Department of Infectious Diseases. Most cases were diagnosed clinically, presenting with parotitis. The complications precipitating admission to hospital included meningitis, orchitis, pancreatitis and oophoritis. Laboratory confirmation was obtained in 45 cases by Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for Mumps IgM in the blood and/or the detection of mumps virus RNA on samples from saliva, throat swabs or cerebro-spinal fluid by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Case confirmation was discontinued as the outbreak progressed.\n\nThe cohort of students currently in higher education was born in the early 1980 s and therefore did not receive the Measles Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine, which was introduced in 1988. These students are, however, particularly susceptible to the mumps virus, as the introduction of the vaccine reduced herd immunity due to naturally circulating virus.\n\nEarly in the epidemic an outbreak meeting was called, and a decision was made to offer MMR vaccination to all students. More than 7000 students were vaccinated over 4 separate days in 2 vaccination centres. No severe complications arose as a result of vaccine administration.\n\nWe present an overview of the outbreak, with brief clinical vignettes of the more severe complications, plus graphs of the epidemiology of the epidemic. Background: Hepatitis A (HAV) outbreaks in the UK in the last 2 years have frequently involved injecting drug users (IDU) and active immunization of all IDU has been proposed to protect the general public health. Hepatitis A (HAV) poses extra risks when it causes superinfection in chronic hepatitis C (HCV) carriers. In Merseyside, where IDU is a common problem, HCV prevalence has been found to be as high as 67%. However little was known about HAV, making it difficult to plan vaccination guidelines for the region.\n\nAim: To assess the rates of HAV screening in IDU in hospital based services.\n\nTo document rates of natural immunity to HAV.\n\nMethod: A retrospective review of laboratory databases of IDU seen in our services with positive HCV antibody tests between 1996-2003. Tabulation of HAV, Hepatitis B (HBV), and HCV was undertaken.\n\nResults: HAV serology was only performed in 381 of 2235 (17%) HCV positive IDU overall. However, the population tested rose to 112 out of 155 (72%) in those screened since 2001, when a screening policy was adopted. HAV IgG serology was positive in 219 of 381 (57.5%). Hepatitis B surface antigen was positive in 40 of 315 (13%) of those tested for both HAV and HCV.\n\nConclusions: Hepatitis A screening rates were low before 2001 and still need to be improved.\n\nOver half of HCV positive IDU already have immunity to HAV, and this might affect cost calculations for immunization programmes that include pre-vaccination screening.\n\nAlthough these results are subject to ascertainment bias, the overall conclusion is likely to be similar in a prospective study. Diarrhoea is the most common infection in children resulting in the death of up to 6 million children every year. Human Rotavirus (HRV) is responsible for between 20% to 25% of these deaths. Diarrhoea is one of the main health problems in Iran, although there is no information on the pathogens involved. This study describes the aetiology of viral diarrhoea and the characteristics of HRV in Shahrekord, Iran.\n\n259 Children ,5 ys admitted to Hajar Hospital, 245 attending primary health centres in Shahrekord, with acute diarrhoea and 114 children hospitalised for elective surgery were selected from October 2001 to August 2002. Stool samples were collected for ELISA, EM, RT-PCR and electropherotyping. 186 viruses were identified of which 146 were HRV. Ten (8.4%) HRV were identified in children without diarrhoea. The second most frequent virus was coronavirus with 16 cases, followed by calicivirus (9). Other viruses included adenovirus (8), astrovirus (6) and parvovirus (1). HRV was more frequently identified in children ,2 years old. The RT-PCR successfully typed 139 of the 146 (95%) HRV G types and 124 (85%) P types. The most frequent P type was P[8*], 61 (42%) samples, P[8] in 48 (33%), P [4] in 16 (11%) and was non P-typeable in 22 (15%). Among the G types, G1 was identified in 78 (53%), G1* in 42 (29%), G2 in 19 (13%) and was non-G-typeable in 7 (5%). HRV is the most important pathogen causing severe diarrhoea in Shahrekord and has a marked seasonal variation, being most frequently isolated from November to February (50% of HRV recovered). These results are in agreement with studies reporting a peak of HRV in the winter months ( A 29 year-old asymptomatic male intravenous drug user of six years was under the ongoing care of an addiction team when routine screening tests revealed significant elevation of liver transaminases; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was particularly elevated. Despite no known exposure to a definite HCV positive contact, there was a high index of suspicion for acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Additional risk factors were recent tatooing and recent episodes of unprotected sexual intercourse.\n\nUpon admission to hospital, hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening IgG antibody was non-reactive. However, a specimen taken on day 11 was weakly reactive, although a supplementary assay, the recombinant immunoblot assay-3 (RIBA-3), was negative. By day 15 both IgG and the RIBA-3 had become positive.\n\nRetrospective real-time, quantitative, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of RNA extracted from all of the specimens referred to above was carried out. PCR positivity 10 days prior to seroconversion was observed in this case. The patient was followed up at an outpatient clinic and after 8 weeks of remaining HCV RNA positive it was decided that he should receive combination antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Conclusions: Although this is not a controlled study, this targeted approach to antifungal prophylaxis appears to have been effective in reducing the incidence of both non-invasive and invasive FIs in children after LTx. However, the influence of changes in antibacterial policy-that may have affected both fungal colonisation and FI-are acknowledged and will be discussed. ) and desferrioxime therapy. The incidence of zygomycoses is rising due to an increase in the number of susceptible patients. Disease can be rhinocerebral, pulmonary, cutaneoarticular or disseminated. Rapidly overwhelming sepsis with a high mortality rate is usual. Survival is associated with early diagnosis, aggressive surgical debridement, high dose Amphotericin B and immunostimulation.\n\nA 68 year old man with type II D.M. and myelodysplastic syndrome (M.D.S.), requiring regular blood transfusions and regular desferrioxime infusions, was admitted with a five-day history of a painful swollen left index finger-the site used for blood glucose monitoring. Pus from the finger was sent to microbiology. Over the course of 48 hours the patient deteriorated rapidly and died despite antimicrobial therapy. A postmortem was performed.\n\nResults: Postmortem findings showed evidence of fungal septicaemia. There were infarcts in the kidney, spleen and brain, severe pericarditis, necrotising areas in the myocardium and severe meningitis. Thrombi in the coronary arteries contained numerous fungi. The morphology of the fungi on histological staining suggested a zygomycete. The pus from the patient's finger yielded C. bertholletiae, but this result was only available post mortem.\n\nConclusions: This case highlights the rapidity at which invasive zygomycosis can progress. Two cases of cutaneous zygomycosis acquired by inoculation due to C. bertholletiae have been reported previously, raising the possibility that the infection may have been introduced by home blood glucose monitoring in this case. Patients in whom such procedures are required, particularly those with other risk factors, may be at increased risk of infection. Infection of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) by Staphylococcus aureus is common and associated with increased mortality, due to compromisation from co-morbidities. Whilst elimination of nasal carriage of S. aureus is known to be a useful health protection measure in some patient groups, its status and role in diabetes mellitus is controversial and unknown in DFU patients. We therefore sampled the anterior nares and ulcers of 98 DFU outpatients to isolate S. aureus. Macrorestriction with Sma I was used to distinguish or match ulcer and nasal isolates from individual patients. As a control, 111 healthy individuals (medical students) at the same institution had nasal swabs taken for culture to determine a baseline carriage rate. Of the 98 DFU patients, 38 (38.7%) were nasal carriers of S. aureus. All but one patient had S. aureus isolated from their ulcers. This was significantly different from the controls, 28 (25.2%) of whom were carriers \u00f0P , 0:05\u00de: 78.9% of DFU isolates were penicillin-resistant, compared to only 12.3% of S. aureus in baseline controls. Macrorestriction determined that 35 (92.1%) of the 38 DFU patients with nasal carriage had the same strain of S. aureus in their ulcer \u00f0P , 0:001\u00de: The positive and negative predictive values of a nose swab as a simple measure to determine whether a DFU is likely to be infected or not, were 85.0% and 92.1%, respectively. Nasal carriage of S. aureus is therefore linked to infection of DFU and protocols for its eradication are required to protect these patients against infection. Out of the 20 who were PCR positive, 14 had CMV disease and 6 had infection (of which 4 received pre-emptive treatment).\n\n24 of the 34 patients under PCR surveillance received aciclovir prophylaxis however 10 of these patients developed CMV disease.\n\nThe mean interval between transplant and CMV PCR positivity was 77 days in the aciclovir group and 44.6 days in the patients who did not receive prophylaxis.\n\nThe cost of managing patients with CMV according to current protocol was \u00a346,884 as compared to \u00a351,015 if all the high-risk patients were to receive ganciclovir prophylaxis with the caveat that 15% of these patients will still end up with CMV disease.\n\nConclusions: No significant difference was noted between the cost of managing high-risk patients as per the current protocol and if all these patients were to receive ganciclovir prophylaxis instead.\n\nProphylactic aciclovir does not prevent CMV disease/infection but may delay it.\n\nlncidence of CMV infection/disease and rate of adverse outcome was higher than expected in the study group. Objectives: To evaluate our protocol of CMV surveillance and pre-emptive treatment with oral ganciclovir in CMV mismatched liver transplants. Protocol compliance was in doubt and there was no consensus on whether pre-emptive therapy or universal prophylaxis is the optimal approach against CMV infection.\n\nMethods: Retrospective database analysis and casenote review of liver transplants (January 2000-December 2002) was performed. Management of CMV-mismatched patients (D \u00fe R 2 ) was assessed against the agreed protocol. This comprised regular CMV-QPCR monitoring for three months, twice-weekly for inpatients then weekly following discharge. 14 days pre-emptive oral ganciclovir was to be given in the event of a single high viral load (VL) (10 5 copies/ml) or a VL increasing by 0.5 log in sequential samples. Therapeutic intravenous ganciclovir was indicated if there was evidence of CMV disease.\n\nResults: 100 liver transplants were performed. Of 15 CMV mismatches, 14 survived and were evaluated. In 3/14 (21.4%), CMV-QPCR remained negative.11/14 (78.5%) developed positive titres (10 4 -10 6 copies/ml). 3 out of the 11(27.2%) with positive titre had evidence of CMV disease at time of first positive VL and were successfully treated with intravenous ganciclovir. 8/11(72.7%) had no evidence of CMV disease initially; 3/8 received neither pre-emptive nor therapeutic ganciclovir, 4/8 were given intravenous then oral ganciclovir and all 7 remained well. 1/8 developed serious CMV disease after delayed preemptive treatment and required intravenous ganciclovir.\n\nConclusion: Of 14 evaluable CMV mismatches, agreed protocol was strictly followed in only 6/14 (42.8%)cases. In the remaining 8 (57.1%), 50% were given unnecessary oral or IV ganciclovir. Compliance with the protocol was poor. After discharge, followup in out-patients or in distant referring centres lead to delays in CMV surveillance. Lack of confidence in the protocol may have resulted in some unnecessary use of intravenous ganciclovir. Following review, we have now introduced prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir (90 days) for all CMV-mismatched liver transplants. A standard pro-forma was used to collect patient data including age, sex, primary diagnosis, type of transplant, immunosuppressive therapy, respiratory symptoms, specimens collected, laboratory diagnosis, antimicrobial agents used (antiviral, antibacterial etc) and outcome of these infections. The 2 \u00a3 2 chi square test was used for statistical calculations.\n\nThe 5-year data collected showed a total of 626 adult patients who underwent transplants. This unit accepts patients over the age of 18 years. 11 patients had infection with rhinoviruses accounting for 40% of viral diagnosis. Other viruses present include, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (22.2%), influenza A (18.5%), Para influenza (PIV) (14.8%) and enteroviruses (7.4%). Herpes simplex and CMV infections were excluded from the study and no adenovirus infections were found. Only patients with rhino viral infections will be further discussed in this report. The frequency of infection due to rhinoviruses was 1.8%. The prevalence being higher in allogeneic compared with autologous recipients. 2 out of a total of 4 deaths were directly attributable to a rhinovirus respiratory infection.\n\nRespiratory viral infection is increasingly reported as important cause of morbidity and mortality in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. In the recent past, considerable experience has been gained regarding the role of viruses including RSV, influenza A, PIV and adenoviruses, there is however relatively little data describing the role of rhinovirus infections in these patients. This report highlights the increasing importance of rhinovirus chest infection in causing morbidity and mortality in BMT patients. Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis is a serious human infection that almost always leads to death, however the pathogenic mechanisms associated with this disease remain unclear. Several lines of evidence suggest that haematogenous spread is a prerequisite for Acanthamoeba encephalitis but it is not clear how circulating amoebae cross the blood-brain barrier to gain entry into the central nervous system. We have recently developed an in vitro blood-brain barrier model using human brain micorvascular endothelial cells. Using this model, we determined the effects of Acanthamoeba (encephalitis isolate belonging to T1 genotype) on blood-brain barrier permeability and factors responsible for these changes. We observed that Acanthamoeba produced more than 60% increase in the bloodbrain barrier permeability. To determine whether Acanthamoeba mediated increased permeability is contact-independent, Acanthamoeba conditioned media were produced and incubated with the blood-brain barrier. A timedependent increase in permeability was observed with more than 60% permeability within 5 h of incubation. Prior treatment of conditioned media with PMSF (a serine protease inhibitor), abolished permeability changes indicating the role of serine proteases. Of interest, alpha-mannose inhibited Acanthamoeba binding to human brain microvascular endothelial cells but increased the blood-brain barrier permeability. Zymography assays revealed that Acanthamoeba produced three distinct proteases, two of which were inhibited by PMSF. In conclusion, we have, for the first time, shown that Acanthamoeba produces blood-brain barrier permeability which can be blocked by PMSF, indicating the potential role of serine proteases. Further understanding of the mechanisms associated with Acanthamoeba encephalitis will allow us to develop novel strategies to prevent this serious infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae normally resides in the human nasopharynx in a nondisease state. In response to yet unknown triggers it can invade mucosal surfaces and enter the bloodstream causing disease. Regulation and activation of virulence genes play essential roles in this process of disease development. Characterization of S. pneumoniae regulatory networks has been a recent area of interest but despite inroads there is little known about regulation of virulence genes in this pathogen. A putative transcriptional regulator in S. pneumoniae, MgrA, with homology to a virulence gene activator, mga, of Group A streptococcus (GAS) was identified as being required for development of pneumonia in a murine model. In this work we confirm that mgrA is required for both nasopharyngeal carriage and pneumonia.\n\nTranscriptional profiling by microarray technology shows that mgrA acts as a repressor of genes in the rlrA pathogenicity island that mediate adherence to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. A second regulator within the island, rlrA, activates transcription of the same genes. Interplay between these two regulators may control expression of these adhesins in response to changing host environments hence altering the invasive and/or adhesive properties of the bacteria. Background: Caspases are cysteine aspartate-specific proteases that regulate cell functions including programmed cell death, cytokine processing and cytoskeletal homeostasis. Caspase activation contributes to poor outcomes in models of sepsis.\n\nMethods: Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) or murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were infected with type 1 pneumococci (Spn) in vitro. A resolving model of pneumococcal infection in C57BL6 mice was established, in which apoptosis was quantified by morphology after DAPI staining, TUNEL and Annexin V staining. Caspases were inhibited by the pancaspase inhibitor, zVAD, with zFA as control. Caspase 1 2/2 mice were investigated to examine the specific effect of caspase 1 activation. Bacterial colony counts were quantified in vitro by an intracellular killing assay and in vivo from blood and lung homogenates. however bacterial internalisation in vitro and inflammatory cell recruitment in vivo were not altered. Bacterial clearance was 1.2 \u00a3 10 3 cfu/lung (0-3.5 \u00a3 103) after zVAD vs.0 cfu/lung (0-3.8 \u00a3 10 5 ) in controls and a greater number of mice were bacteraemic (6/13 vs.0/8, p , 0:05). Caspase 1 deficient mice showed no alteration in AM apoptosis or in bacterial clearance as compared to wild type.\n\nConclusions: Caspase activation is associated with macrophage apoptosis induction and bacterial killing in a resolving model of pneumococcal infection. Apoptosis induction contributes to bacterial clearance. Members of the genus Shigella are pathogens of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans, causing severe and sometimes fatal bacillary dysentery responsible for approximately one million deaths annually. Shigella spp. can invade the mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract and initiate an acute and intense inflammatory reaction that leads to the destruction of epithelium and breakdown of the intestinal barrier. However, far less is known about how the bacterium survives within the hostile environment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; Shigella spp. must be extremely adept at this critical initial phase of pathogenesis as only 1-10 microorganisms given orally are sufficient to cause diarrhoea in healthy volunteers.\n\nWe have begun to investigate the factors that S. flexneri requires during colonisation of the GI tract. Through analysis of a library of transposon mutants, we have identified mutants of the bacterium that are unable to cause sustained infection of rabbit ileal loops, the most validated non-primate model of intestinal shigellosis. Several mutants that are defective in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biogenesis were identified.\n\nWe have shown that strains with marked truncation of their LPS structure are unable to withstand the bactericidal effects of an anti-microbial peptide, cecropin, or complement (which is secreted into the GI lumen during acute infection). Even mutants with minor changes in LPS, such as those which are unable to glycosylate the O antigen repeating subunit (gtr mutants), were also defective for colonisation; this effect is dependent upon the invasive capacity of the bacterium. Glycosylation and acetylation of the O antigen is the basis for the multiple serotypes of Shigella spp.\n\nExpression of LPS is essential for survival in the GI tract and different serotypes of Shigella spp. may inherently different fitness for survival in the host. Therefore, to gain a full appreciation of the molecular mechanisms that the bacterium has evolved to successfully inhabit its niche in the host, we have examined the behaviour of N. meningitidis in human tissue explants. Nasal turbinates were infected with N. meningitidis and bacteria failing to penetrate through the epithelial layer were identified. We isolated mutants that were unable to successfully colonise the upper airway tissue, including two that do not express pili, a characterised adhesin for meningococcal interactions with epithelial cells. We also recovered colonisation defective mutants with insertions novel genes of unknown function. We have begun to analyse the function of these genes by expressing them as a recombinant proteins in E. coli, and determining whether the heterologous proteins mediate binding of E. coli to host cells.\n\nStudying the interaction between pathogenic bacteria and host tissue should reveal further mechanisms underlying colonization and pathogenesis than using models relying solely on immortalised cells. Aim: To characterize the internalization process of an M89 clinical isolate and isogenic strains with mutations in the superantigens smez (streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin Z) and mf (mitogenic factor)-additional isolates with mutations in speB, ska, sls, and slo were also used.\n\nMethods: Internalization assays used human epithelial cell lines (A549 and SVK14) for an in vitro model in which extracellular bacteria were removed by washing or killed by antibiotics. The internalization mechanism was further investigated by using an actin cytoskeleton inhibitor and b1 integrin subunit blocking antibodies. To measure cytoxicity to epithelial cells, culture media was removed after infection and LDH measured by an enzymatic assay. For analysis of transcripts, bacterial RNA was extracted at desired growth phases, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with DIG labelled PCR products.\n\nResults: The M89 strain exhibited inoculum dependent internalization. Internalization was dependent on actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and the b1 integrin subunit. Interestingly, TNFb and IL-1b inhibited internalization. Loss of a functional smez gene increased the isolates internalization and also increased the LDH release by epithelial cells. The smez mutant had marked enhancement of slo transcription. Paradoxically, in an M49 strain, slo was associated with a decrease in internalization and an increase in cytotoxicity.\n\nConclusion: Contrary to published results, this data indicates that in some serotypes slo may not be a key factor in determining internalization. Furthermore, other factors such as fibronectin binding proteins may be downregulated by smez or adjacent regulatory factors. This is a rigorous system for investigating GAS internalization in epithelial cells offering a platform with capacity for screening of a genome-wide mutant pool. Using either a 6% all-cause pneumonia efficacy or a 20.5% pneumococcal pneumonia efficacy, an IPD efficacy of 97.4% and a paediatric otitis media efficacy of 7%, the CLYG is \u00a32500.\n\nConclusions: Universal paediatric use of 7-PCV in the UK would prevent 1957 deaths at a CLYG of \u00a32500. This is highly cost effective."}
