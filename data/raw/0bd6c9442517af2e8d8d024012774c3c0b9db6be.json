{"title": "Early behavior of Madrid Covid-19 disease outbreak: A mathematical model", "body": "On 31 December 2019, a comunity-adquired pneumonia of unknown ethiology was first reported in Wuhan city. On 2 January 2020 it was first published its relation with a Coronaviridae virus, called SARS-CoV-2 (1) . During the first two months of epidemic, a total of 79384 cases were reported in China, with 2838 deaths (Lethal Index of 3.57% (2) . On 13 January 2020 the first case outside China was reported in Thailand, corresponding to an imported case from Wuhan and in the following days, imported cases from this region were also reported in Japan and Republic of Korea (3) .\n\nDuring the first 2 months of epidemia, a total of 85403 cases were globally reported, with a total of 2924 deaths and a Letality index of 3.42% (2) .\n\nIn Spain, the first reported cases occurred on 31 January and 9 February 2020. They were two cases adquired on Germany and United Kingdom respectively(4 According to the early Wuhan outbreak data, the Reproduction Number (R 0 ) is reported to be between 2 and 3 [Li, Wu, Riou] . Although it may change over time and it can be reduced with PHM based on mobility restrictions, as it has been seen in Wuhan (8, 9) .\n\nTo describe the early characteristics of Covid-19 outbreak in Madrid.\n\nTo build a Mathematical model that fits the early findings of Covid-19 infection on Madrid's outbreak.\n\nData used for this paper was obtained directly from Spanish Government reported cases. This data is available online at the Spanish Health Ministry webpage (10) .\n\nAnalyzed data corresponds to the first 15 days of Madrid Covid-19 disease outbreak (26 February to 11 March 2020).\n\nBased on the Spanish Government reported cases, we built a stochastic transmission model, based on a classical SIR epidemiological model (11), as can be seen on figure   1 . Basically, it divides individuals into four different subgroups: Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed (recovered, isolated or death).\n\nThe incubation period was assumed to be Normally distributed, with a mean of 5 days and a standard deviation (SD) of 2 days. The time to the start of symptoms and the peak of the disease is normally distributed, with a mean of 3 days and a SD of 1 day.\n\nOnce a patient is infected (turns into an Infected individual), the probability to transmit the infection on a certain day (R n ) is based on the estimated R 0 , with a peak probability on the peak day (p) of symptoms:\n\nThe probability for developing symptoms is fixed on 0.7, and in those symptomatic patients, the time to diagnosis is Normally distributed, with a mean of 8 days and a SD of 2 days. Once a patient is diagnosed, it is supposed to be removed from the general population (turns into a Removed individual) and thus its probability to infect other individual is stopped. If a patient is asymptomatic and thus no diagnosed, it still can .

All of this parameters introduced in the model are shown in table 1.\n\nThe Mathematical model was built with R (12) and it can be downloaded online from our repository [cite] . \n\nMean estimated R 0 value along the early period is of 2.22 (+/-1.21 SD). A temporal representation of the obtained R 0 value is shown in figure 2 , and temporal results with the confidence interval is also shown in table 2.\n\nDuring this analyzed period of time the regression analysis shows a significant increase of the R 0 value along days. An increase of 0.093 (+/-0.037, p=0.025) in R 0 value each day of outbreak is found.\n\nSimulated mathematical models are useful to asses the epidemic characteristics and evaluate possible effects of different PHM interventions. Moreover, they are of special interest in early stages of an outbreak, when no enough information is still available to make decisions. In this sense, the proposed model can be used and adapted to .

This R 0 value is about 2-3 at the beginning, although our data suggest it can increase along the outbreak if no PHM are taken.\n\nIn previous reports, PHM based on mobility restrictions can reduce this R 0 value, leading to a disease control and finally to a possibility to overcome this situation. In this sense further investigation will be necessary to evaluate weather or not, this mobility restrictions can lead to a reduction in R 0 value. This effect in outbreak reduction would be of special importance to plan future decisions and to monitor their effect.\n\nOur proposed Mathematical Simulation model may be useful to evaluate early characteristics of this outbreak and the results of further PHM.\n\nThe present work is the first reported estimation of R 0 value in the Spanish Madrid Covid-19 outbreak. It is similar to the previous reported in the Wuhan outbreak, although it may suggest a slightly increase on R 0 along time.\n\nWhether or not PHM based on mobility restrictions will be able to reduce R 0 value in Covid-19 Madrid outbreak is still not known, and thus, further investigation in this sense will be needed.\n\n.
