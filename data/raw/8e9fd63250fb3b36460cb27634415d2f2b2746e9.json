{"title": "Collection and Interpretation of Laboratory Data", "body": "2. Cations: Na + , K + B. Unmeasured 1. Anions (UA): albumin, aand b-globulins, PO 4 3-, SO 4 2-, organic acids, certain toxins and drugs 2. Cations (UC): gamma globulins, Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , certain drugs C. In electroneutrality: Na + + K + + UC = Cl -+ HCO 3 -+ UA III. Anion gap is the difference between measured cation and anion concentrations.\n\nA. Denotes an alteration in some unmeasured component of the equation B. Anion gap = (Na + + K + ) -(Cl -+ HCO 3 -) 1. Normal: 12 mEq/L; range: 8 to 16 mEq/L 2. May be increased by either a decrease in UC or an increase in UA 3. Is decreased by either an increase in UC or a decrease in UA 4. Potassium \n\nI. If the calculated value exceeds the measured value, a mathematical or laboratory error exists. II. If the measured value is normal but the calculated value is low, a decrease in serum water is the usual cause. Shedding of virus is brief and usually not detected by day 10-12 of infection (day 5-7 of clinical illness) Vaccination produces false positives 5-12 days after administration RSAT, Rapid slide agglutination test; TAT, tube agglutination test; ME-TAT, 2-mercaptoethane TAT; AGID, agar-gel immunodiffusion; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IFA, indirect immunofl uorescence antibody; MAT, microscopic agglutination test; IgM, immunoglobulin M; IgG, immuoglobulin G; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FIP, feline infectious peritonitis. III. An unmeasured osmole is suggested when both values are elevated and a signifi cant gap exists. A. Mannitol, glycerin B. Sorbitol, acetone C. Ethylene glycol, alcohol D. Myeloma protein, hyperlipidemia E. Infused hyperosmotic solutions F. Activated charcoal containing propylene glycol and glycerol (Burkitt et al., 2005) "}
