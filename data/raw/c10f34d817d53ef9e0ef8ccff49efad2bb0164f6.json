{"title": "Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Obstetric Procedures", "body": "I nfectious complications following obstetric surgical procedures are a significant source of morbidity and potential mortality. They include urinary tract infection, endometritis, wound infection, perineal infection, and sepsis, which lead to prolonged hospital stays and increased health care costs. Much work has been done to study the effect of prophylactic antibiotics in reducing infectious morbidity. A plethora of antibiotic types, dosing schedules, and routes of administration have been investigated. There is evidence to support the use of prophylactic antibiotics for a number of procedures in obstetrics. Unfortunately, few comparative trials have been conducted, leaving the clinician with uncertainty as to which regimen is superior.\n\nThe presence of antibiotic resistant organisms is a reality in Canadian health care facilities. 1 These organisms include methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms.\n\nBoth morbidity and mortality are increased in infections caused by these organisms, as they may be more virulent and are more difficult to treat because therapeutic options are limited. Antibiotic resistance development results mainly from the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Incomplete courses of antibiotic therapies and the unnecessary use of broader spectrum regimens play a role. 2 Adherence to both treatment and prophylaxis guidelines likely assists in reducing infection and antibiotic resistance. Physician adherence to antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines is variable and usually at odds with published guidelines. 3, 4 In addition to antibiotic prophylaxis, it is essential to review all factors that affect infectious risk reduction in obstetrical care. 5 Adherence to appropriate skin preparation procedure, including hair clipping as opposed to shaving, and effective antisepsis of both patient and staff are required. 6 Sterile surgical fields must be ensured, and ongoing quality assessment of sterilization technique, air ventilation, and postoperative wound care is needed. Consistent infection control surveillance and reporting of infectious complications track ability to minimize these morbidities and possibly to identify clusters of infection and the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms. This will dictate changes to operative routines to respond to evolving microbial diversity that seems inevitable.\n\nSEPTEMBER JOGC SEPTEMBRE 2010 l 879 \n\nThe purpose of antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical procedures is not to sterilize tissues but to reduce the colonization pressure of microorganisms introduced at the time of operation to a level that the patient's immune system is able to overcome. 7 Prophylaxis does not prevent infection caused by postoperative contamination. Prophylactic antibiotic use differs from treatment with antibiotics 5 in that the former is intended to prevent infection, whereas the latter is intended to resolve an established infection, typically requiring a longer course of therapy. Prophylaxis is intended for elective procedures when the incision will be closed in the operating room.\n\nBefore an agent can be considered for use as a prophylactic antibiotic, there must be evidence that it reduces postoperative infection. It must also be safe and inexpensive, and it must be effective against organisms likely to be encountered in the surgical procedure. The agent must be administered in a way that ensures that serum and tissue levels are adequate before an incision is made and that therapeutic levels of the agent can be maintained in serum and tissue during surgery and for a few hours (at most) after the incision is closed. 7 Wound infections-surgical site infections-in the form of cellulitis, abscess, or dehiscence can occur following laparotomy. Pelvic infections, such as an abscess or infected hematoma, are a risk with any surgical procedure that enters the abdominal cavity. Cuff cellulitis is a specific risk for hysterectomy. Endometritis can result from Caesarean section or surgical abortion. Urinary tract infections can occur as a result of any procedure that involves catheterization of the bladder. A 1999 guideline published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists the specific and stringent criteria that must be met for diagnosis of a surgical site infection. 7 Accurate surveillance for SSI monitoring requires followup for 30 days postoperatively, and the trend towards early discharge from hospital makes surveillance a challenge. It is estimated that up to 84% of surgical site infections occur following discharge from hospital. 7 If prophylactic antibiotics are to be given, they should be administered shortly prior to or at bacterial inoculation. 8, 9 The majority of studies suggest that a single dose is effective, but for lengthy procedures (> 3 hours) the dose should be repeated at intervals 1or 2 times the half-life of the drug. It has also been suggested that with large blood loss (> 1500 mL), a second dose should be given. 10\n\nProcedures reviewed in this section include Caesarean section, operative vaginal delivery, manual removal of placenta, repair of third or fourth degree perineal laceration, cervical cerclage, and postpartum dilatation and curettage. Recent changes to endocarditis prophylaxis guidelines are also be reviewed.\n\nThe single most important risk factor for postpartum maternal infection is Caesarean section. 11 Women having Caesarean section have a 5-to 20-fold greater risk of infection than women having vaginal delivery. Rates of wound infection and serious infectious complications can be as high as 25%. 12 There is no consistent application of definitions for SSI, and the practice of post-discharge surveillance varies widely. 13 There has been debate about the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics for a woman who has an elective Caesarean section with intact membranes and without labour. A meta-analysis of 4 studies found that antibiotic prophylaxis resulted in a decrease in postoperative fever (RR 0.25; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.44) and endometritis (RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38). 16 Taken together, these data support the recommendation to use prophylactic antibiotics for all women undergoing Caesarean section.\n\nControversy also exists about whether prophylactic antibiotics in Caesarean section should be given prior to skin incision or at the time of the umbilical cord clamping. Traditionally, prophylaxis has been delayed in an effort to avoid masking a neonatal infection and to prevent an unnecessary septic work-up. However, recent evidence may change this practice. A randomized trial compared maternal infectious and neonatal outcomes in women randomized to receive cefazolin 15 to 60 minutes before incision versus at cord clamp. Three hundred fifty-seven women were enrolled. Overall maternal infectious morbidity was reduced in the pre-treatment group (RR 0.4; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.87); in particular, endometritis was reduced (RR 0.2; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.94).\n\nNo increase in neonatal sepsis, investigation, or length of stay was observed. 17 A recent meta-analysis supports the use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to Caesarean incision to prevent total infectious morbidity (RR 50; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.78, P = 0.002). Neonatal outcomes were not affected. 18 The most widely studied antibiotics for surgical prophylaxis are cephalosporins. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin and is a Pregnancy Category B drug. When given intravenously, its half-life is 1.8 hours. It provides good coverage for gram positive organisms and has modest gram negative coverage. In a 1999 guideline, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended its use at Caesarean section. 7 It is recommended that 1 to 2 grams should be administered intravenously not more than 30 minutes before the skin is cut. An additional dose can be considered if blood loss exceeds 1500 mL or at 4 hours if the procedure lasts more than 4 hours (i.e., up to 2 half-lives of the drug). 19 Trials have shown that broader spectrum antibiotics for Caesarean section do reduce infectious morbidity. Superiority trials with cefazolin have not been conducted. Given the potential for antibiotic resistance in both mother and neonate, recommendations for the use of broader spectrum antibiotics require further study. 20\n\nA 2004 Cochrane review investigated the use of prophylactic antibiotics for operative vaginal delivery, with either forceps or vacuum assisted deliveries, to determine if prophylaxis reduces the incidence of postpartum infections. 21 The review identified only one trial of 393 women, and only 2 of 9 outcomes deemed appropriate by the reviewers were assessed in this study: endometritis and length of hospital stay. These did not differ between those who received prophylaxis and those who received no treatment. The review concluded there were insufficient data on which to base recommendations for practice and that further research is needed. No additional studies addressing this issue have been published to date.\n\nThere is limited information regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the development of postpartum endometritis following manual removal of the placenta. A Cochrane review, updated in April 2009, did not identify any randomized controlled trials. 22 The World Health Organization suggests that prophylaxis should be offered but recognizes that there is no direct evidence of the value of antibiotic prophylaxis after manual removal of the placenta and bases the recommendation on studies involving Caesarean section and abortion and on observational studies of other intrauterine manipulations. 23 The effect of operator glove change before manual removal of the placenta at Caesarean section was studied in a group of 228 women, with operators changing gloves in one half of the cases. No difference in post-Caesarean endometritis was noted between the 2 groups. 24 However, the incidence of endometritis was decreased when the placenta delivered spontaneously rather than being manually removed at Caesarean section in a study of 333 women, all of whom received prophylactic antibiotics (15% vs. 26%, RR 0.6; P = 0.01). 25\n\nA 2005 Cochrane review 26 on this subject found there were no randomized trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment in fourth degree perineal tears during vaginal birth. A well-designed randomized trial was recommended. This was undertaken by Duggal et al. 27 and published in 2008. This prospective trial followed 107 women post third or fourth degree laceration repair for 2 weeks; the women had been randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous dose of cefotetan, cefoxitin, or placebo. Four of 49 (8%) who received antibiotics and 14 of 58 (24%) who received placebo developed perineal wound complication (P = 0.037). This suggests a benefit to using prophylactic antibiotics to reduce morbidity following significant perineal laceration. 27\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of prophylactic antibiotics with the placement of cervical cerclage in any clinical setting. One study 28 investigated the use of continuous low-dose antibiotics in women with a history of second trimester pregnancy loss with the placement of cerclage at 14 to 24 weeks' gestation on the basis of transvaginal sonographic findings of cervical funnelling. Each of the 10 patients had a live birth, and pregnancy was prolonged by a mean of 13.4 \u00b1 4.2 weeks beyond the previous pregnancy. There was no control group. 28 In a second retrospective study of 116 mid-trimester cerclage placements, antibiotic use was not associated with a decreased risk of delivery before 28 weeks' gestation. 29 Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the role of antibiotics in these high-risk pregnancies.\n\nNo studies were identified that investigated the use of prophylactic antibiotics for postpartum dilatation and curettage.\n\nIncreased BMI is associated with higher rates of both obstetric and infectious complications. 30 Controlled trials assessing the required dosage for antibiotic prophylaxis based on patient BMI have not been assessed in our specialty. Expert opinion recommends twice the normal dose of prophylaxis for morbidly obese patients, who have a BMI > 35. 19 Future research in this area is needed.\n\nPenicillin allergy is self-reported by up to 10 % of patients, yet only 10 % of those are actually allergic when skin testing is performed. [31] [32] [33] True anaphylactic response to penicillin is rare, occurring in 1 to 4 of 10 000 administrations. 34 An allergic reaction to cephalosporins in those with a penicillin allergy occurs at rates of 0.17% to 8.4%. [35] [36] [37] An alternative to cephalosporins should be given only to individuals with a history of penicillin anaphylaxis (shortness of breath or evidence of airway edema rather than just rash or other allergic reaction) or cephalosporin allergy. Alternative prophylactic antibiotics include clindamycin 600 mg IV or erythromycin 500 mg IV.\n\nAn American Heart Association guideline 38 published in 2007 found no evidence that genitourinary procedures cause IE or that administration of antibiotics prevents IE following such procedures. The American Heart Association therefore does not recommend prophylactic antibiotics for patients undergoing genitourinary procedures; this is a change from their 1997 guideline. They identified 4 conditions that are at highest risk of adverse outcome (Table 2) . For patients with the conditions listed in Table 2 who have an established gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract infection or for those who receive antibiotic therapy for another reason (e.g., to prevent wound infection), they suggest it may be reasonable that the choice of antibiotic also be active against enterococci (i.e., ampicillin, piperacillin, or vancomycin).\n\nThey also suggest that it may be reasonable for patients at high risk of IE who have a known enterococcal urinary tract infection or colonization to receive antibiotic treatment prior to any urinary tract manipulation. A review on this recommendation change has been recently published. 39 "}
