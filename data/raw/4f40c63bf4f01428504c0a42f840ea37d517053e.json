{"title": "Cryptosporidium and concurrent infections with other major enterophatogens in 1 to 30-day-old diarrheic dairy calves in central Spain", "body": "Diarrhea of neonatal calves causes major economic loss directly through mortality and therapy, and indirectly from poor growth. The diarrheal disease syndrome has a complex Veterinary Parasitology 80 (1999) 179\u00b1185 etiopathogenesis, because various infectious agents, either single or in combination, may be associated with field outbreaks. In addition, environmental, managemental, and nutritional factors may influence the severity and outcome of the disease.\n\nCryptosporidium parvum, an intestinal protozoan parasite that causes enteric infection and diarrhea in many species of mammals (O'Donoghue, 1995) , has emerged as one of the major enteropathogens associated with neonatal calf diarrhea together with rotavirus, coronavirus, F5 Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Cryptosporidium infection of calves may be asymptomatic or causes clinical signs range from mild intermittent diarrhea to profuse watery diarrhea with concomitant dehydration (Fayer and Ungar, 1986) .\n\nMost studies carried out in different countries have found Cryptosporidium and rotavirus to be the most commonly detected agents in calves with diarrhea. In some reports Cryptosporidium was the most prevalent (Rosati et al., 1991; McDonough et al., 1994; Fagan et al., 1995; Otto et al., 1995) , while in other studies rotavirus was the agent most frequently detected Reynolds et al., 1986; Snodgrass et al., 1986; Zrelli et al., 1990; Moore and Zeman, 1991; Brenner et al., 1993) . In microbiological surveys of diarrheic calves, the detection rate of mixed infections with two or more of the main enteropathogens ranged between 5% and 20%, and in most of them Cryptosporidium was involved (Bulgin et al., 1982; Sherwood et al., 1983; Reynolds et al., 1986; Snodgrass et al., 1986; Bellinzoni et al., 1990; Zrelli et al., 1990; Fagan et al., 1995) .\n\nSome reports have described the detection rate of Cryptosporidium infection in field cases of neonatal calf diarrhoea in Spain (Mart\u00f5 \u00c2n et al., 1995; Qui \u00c2 lez et al., 1996) . However, no studies involving other recognized enteropathogens simultaneously has been conducted. This study reports the detection rates of Cryptosporidium and concurrent infections with four other major enteropathogens in different age groups (1\u00b17, 8\u00b114, 15\u00b1 21 and 22\u00b130 days) of diarrheic dairy calves in central Spain.\n\nIn the autumn of 1993, a letter was sent to 33 veterinarians working in the dairy industry in central Spain and members of the National Association of Specialists in Bovine Medicine (ANEMBE), asking for their collaboration for sampling natural cases of neonatal calf diarrhea. The diagnosis of diarrhea was made by veterinarians. Faecal samples were collected directly from the rectum in sterile plastic bottles and submitted on the day of sampling to the laboratory by express mail. Submitted samples were accompanied by a record sheet containing information on the size of herd, number of scouring calves and number of calves ( < 30 days) in the herd at sampling time, and age of each sampled calf. Only fecal samples obtained within 48 h of onset of clinical signs from non-treated calves up to 30 days of age were included in this study. Samples were processed within 24 h of reception.\n\nCryptosporidium infection was diagnosed in fresh faecal smears. For oocysts detection smears were made from non-concentrated faecal samples on glass slides and oocysts were detected microscopically using extemporaneous fuchsin staining method (Heine, 1982) . A modified Ziehl-Neelsen's acid-fast method (Casemore et al., 1985) was also used to confirm Heine-stain negative results. Moreover, Cryptosporidium was also detected by a commercial ELISA kit (Tetravalent, Ve \u00c2toquinol, Magny-Vernois, France).\n\nAll the faecal samples positive to Cryptosporidium were tested for the presence of rotavirus, coronavirus and F5 E. coli by a commercial ELISA kit (Tetravalent). The ELISA test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Moreover, faecal samples were also tested for the presence of rotavirus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as described by Herring et al. (1982) , and for the presence of F5 E. coli by bacterial culture as follows. The faeces samples were plated on MacConkey agar. After overnight incubation, four colonies with the typical appearance of E. coli from each sample were randomly chosen. E. coli strains were identified by biochemical tests. The strains were tested for F5 fimbriae by the slide agglutination method with live bacteria grown on Minca-Isovitalex solid media. The production of absorbed antiserum used to detect this fimbrial antigen has been described (Morris et al., 1983; Contrepois et al., 1985) . Salmonella species were isolated by enrichment of faeces in selective broths. Approximately 1 g of faeces was added both to 9 ml of tetrathionate broth and to 7.5 ml of selenite broth. After 24 h of incubation at 378C, samples were plated out on brilliant green agar, and incubated for 24 h at 378C. Lactose-negative colonies were tested on triple sugar iron, urea, and o-nitrophenyl--D-galactopyranoside media. Those that had Salmonella-type reactions were tested for agglutination, using commercial polyvalent O-antisera (Salmonella antiserum, Difco).\n\nData were computed using Epi Info Version 6.04 (Dean et al., 1994) . Calves were grouped according to their age as follows: 1\u00b17, 8\u00b114, 15\u00b121 and 22\u00b130 days. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for Cryptosporidium infection in the different age groups were calculated using each age group as reference. The relative risk of infection was considered significant if 95% CI for OR did not include 1.0 (Fletcher et al., 1996) . Mantel-Haenzsel 1 2 was used for linear trends.\n\nFrom November 1993 to September 1995, 18 of the 33 veterinarians submitted samples from at least two herds (range 2\u00b17). Altogether, 218 faecal samples from diarrheic dairy calves in 65 herds were submitted. Herd sizes ranged from 12 to 650 cows (median 49 cows). Of 218 calves, 64, 57, 68 and 29 calves were 1\u00b17, 8\u00b114, 15\u00b121 and 22\u00b130-days old, respectively. The mean age of the studied calves was 13.3 days (median 12 days).\n\nCryptosporidium infection was detected in 43.8%, 71.9%, 63.2% and 6.9% of the calves in the age groups 1\u00b17, 8\u00b114, 15\u00b121 and 22\u00b130 days, respectively ( Table 1 ). The risk for Cryptosporidium infection in the age group 22\u00b130 days was significantly lower in comparison with age group 1\u00b17 days (OR 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02\u00b10.43; p < 0.001; Table 1), with age group 8\u00b114 days (OR 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01\u00b10.14; p < 0.0001), and with age group 15\u00b121 days (OR 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01\u00b10.20; p < 0.0001). The risk for Cryptosporidium infection in the age group 1\u00b17 days was also significantly lower in comparison with age group 8\u00b114 days (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14\u00b10.65; p < 0.01) and with age group 15\u00b121 days (OR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23\u00b10.91; p < 0.05). The mean age of the Cryptosporidium-infected calves was 11.8 days (range 2\u00b130 days).\n\nOnly Cryptosporidium was detected in 60 of the 114 (52.6%) diarrheic calves. Concomitant infections with other enteropathogen(s) were detected in 64.3%, 46.3%, 39.5% and 0% of the Cryptosporidium infected calves in the age groups 1\u00b17, 8\u00b114, 15\u00b121 and 22\u00b130 days, respectively (Table 2) . A significant age-associated decrease in the detection rate of mixed infections (p < 0.05) was found. The detection rates of the other (Table 2) . Thus, the combination Cryptosporidium-rotavirus was found in all but seven of the calves with mixed infection, and in 14 of the 47 calves with Cryptosporidium\u00b1rotavirus infection at least one of the other agents was also detected ( Table 2) .\n\nThis study reports the detection rates of Cryptosporidium and concurrent infections with other enteropathogens in different age groups (1\u00b17, 8\u00b114, 15\u00b121 and 22\u00b130 days) of diarrheic dairy calves. Given the sampling procedure, we cannot exclude that the results are biased, since veterinarians may have tended to select severe or persistent cases of diarrhea for sampling, and, thus, mild or transient cases may be under-represented in this study. This same drawback frequently exists for other studies involving diarrheic calves. Therefore, it seems reasonable to compare our results with those reported in similar studies.\n\nThe overall detection rate of Cryptosporidium in this study (52.3%) is higher than those found in neonatal diarrheic calves in other countries (from 14.1% to 44.4%) (Reynolds et al., 1986; Snodgrass et al., 1986; Zrelli et al., 1990; Moore and Zeman, 1991; Rosati et al., 1991; Brenner et al., 1993; Fagan et al., 1995) , and in Spain (35.7%) (Mart\u00f5 \u00c2n et al., 1995) , but similar to that reported by Otto et al. (1995) (52.5%) in diarrheic calves up to 3 weeks of age in Germany. Rotavirus is traditionally considered the most prevalent agent in diarrheic calves. However, recent surveys tend to find higher Cryptosporidium than rotavirus prevalence. Thus, it is possible that the incidence of Cryptosporidium had increased in the last years.\n\nThe detection rates of Cryptosporidium infection in the different age groups are generally in accordance with the pattern of Cryptosporidium oocysts shedding reported for calves (Tzipori et al., 1983; Markovics and Pipano, 1987) . Thus, the highest risk of being infected with Cryptosporidium in diarrheic calves occurred in the second week of life, although this risk was not significantly higher in comparison with that of the third week. The percentage of calves in the second week of life positive to Cryptosporidium in our study was slightly higher than the result reported by Fagan et al. (1995) in a similar study (71.9% vs. 62.5%), while that of the third week was much higher (63.2% vs. 33.3%) than their's.\n\nThe percentage of calves infected with Cryptosporidium in the first week of life was higher than expected, since the experimentally determined pre-patent period for the parasite in cattle is 2\u00b17 days (Tzipori et al., 1983) , and 4\u00b18 days is the usual pre-patent period in naturally infected calves (Markovics and Pipano, 1987) . Nevertheless, broadly similar high detection rate of Cryptosporidium infection (37.3%) in 0\u00b17-day-old diarrheic calves was found by Fagan et al. (1995) in Ireland. On the other hand, very different results have been reported in prevalence surveys. Thus, in a survey carried out in Arago \u00c2n (Spain), Qu\u00f5 \u00c2lez et al. (1996) found as much as 44.4% of calves aged 3\u00b14 days infected with Cryptosporidium, while in a nation-wide survey performed in USA only 2.5% of < 4 days old calves were positive to Cryptosporidium (Garber et al., 1994) . Two to 4 days are typically required for the first shedding of oocysts in feces. Therefore, the high detection rate found by us in age group 1\u00b17 days indicates that most of these calves were infected immediately after birth, and that the environment was heavily contaminated with oocysts.\n\nCryptosporidium was the only enteropathogen detected in 52.6% of the diarrhoeic calves. Therefore, although concurrent infection with other agents as well as environmental, managemental, and nutritional factors may influence the outcome of disease for a calf with Cryptosporidium infection, the results of this study indicate the importance of this organism as primary pathogen causing acute diarrhea in neonatal calves.\n\nMixed infections were detected in nearly half (47.4%) of the Cryptosporidium-infected calves, and, in agreement with the results published in most surveys all over the world, the most common mixed infection found in this study was rotavirus\u00b1Cryptosporidium. A significant age-associated decrease in the detection rate of mixed infections (p < 0.05) was found. That is in accordance with the age-dependent susceptibility of calves to the other enteropathogens considered except Salmonella. The pathogenic significance of concurrent infections in diarrheic calves, however, is not yet clear. Whether additive or synergistic interactions, that give rise to clinical effect or increase the severity of disease, occur in calves infected with Cryptosporidium and any other agent, or whether other agents extend the risk period for clinical cryptosporidiosis remain to be proved experimentally. Nevertheless, in microbiological surveys of diarrheic and healthy neonatal calves, mixed infections were much more commonly detected in diarrheic than in healthy calves (Morin et al., 1980; Reynolds et al., 1986) . Reynolds et al. (1986) suggested that the presence of more than one enteropathogen may be one of the factors determining whether an infection results in a clinical or subclinical effect. Moreover, mixed infections have been associated with more severe disease (Morin et al., 1980) ."}
