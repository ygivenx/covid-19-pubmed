Wang, Washington University), HFF-1 (ATCC #SCRC-1041), Hs 633T (Sigma-Aldrich #89050201), Huh7, RPE (provided by M. Mahjoub, Washington University), JEG3, U2OS (provided by S. Cherry, University Of Pennsylvania), HT1080 (provided by J. Cooper, Washington University), Raji, and K562 cells all were cultured at 37\u00b0C in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM Sodium pyruvate, 1\u00d7 non-essential amino acids, and 100 U/mL of Penicillin-Streptomycin. HTR8/SV.neo cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Jurkat cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 mM HEPES. hCMEC/D3 cells (provided by R. Klein, Washington University) were cultured in EBM-2 media (Lonza, 00190860) supplemented with 5% FBS, 5 \u03bcg/mL ascorbic acid, 10 mM HEPES, 1% Lipid concentrate (Gibco, 11905-031) in plates pre-coated with collagen. All cell lines were tested and judged free of mycoplasma contamination using a commercial kit.\n\nPrimary human keratinocytes (#102-05n), synovial fibroblasts (#408-05a), osteoblasts (#406-05f), chondrocytes (#402-05f), and skeletal muscle cells (#S150-05f) were purchased from Cell Applications. Primary human dermal fibroblasts (#CC-2509) were obtained from Lonza. Cells were thawed and cultured in specified medium according to the instructions of the manufacturers, and used within one week.\n\nThe following alphaviruses were used: CHIKV (strains 2006 La Reunion OPY1, 37997, AF15561, 181/25, and 181/25-mKate2 (rescued from pJM6 CHIKV-181/25 mKate2 cDNA clone, provided by T. Morrison and M. Heise), RRV (T48), MAYV (BeH407), ONNV (MP30), Semliki Forest (Kumba), SINV (Toto1101, Girdwood), Bebaru (MM 2354), Middleburg (30037), Getah (AMM-2021), Una (CoAr2380), and Barmah Forest (K10521) viruses. Additional viruses tested included chimeric encephalitic alphaviruses (SINV-EEEV, SINV-WEEV, and VEEV-GFP (TC-83)), a flavivirus (WNV, New York 2000), a bunyavirus (RVFV-GFP, MP-12), a rhabdovirus (VSV-GFP, Indiana), and a picornavirus (encephalomyocarditis virus, EMCV). Replication-competent SINV chimeric viruses were constructed by replacing the SINV TR339 structural protein genes with EEEV FL93-939 or WEEV Fleming structural protein genes under control of the SINV subgenomic promoter in the TR339 cDNA clone26. All viruses were propagated in Vero cells and titrated by standard plaque or focus-forming assays27.\n\nA mouse GeCKOv2 CRISPR knockout pooled library encompassing 130,209 different sgRNAs against 20,611 genes28 was made available by Feng Zhang (Addgene #1000000053), and amplified in Endura cells (Lucigen # 60242) as described previously28,29. The sgRNA library was divided in half (A + B), packaged into lentiviruses, and used for independent screening. The sgRNA plasmid library was packaged in 293FT cells after co-transfection with psPAX2 (Addgene #12260) and pMD2.G (Addgene #12259) at a ratio of 2:2:1 using Fugene\u00aeHD (Promega). Approximately 48 h after transfection, supernatants were harvested, clarified by centrifugation (3,500 rpm x 20 min) and aliquotted for storage at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nFor the CRISPR screen, a clonal 3T3-Cas9 cell line was generated by transduction with a packaged lentivirus (lentiCas9-Blast, Addgene #52962), blasticidin selection, and limiting dilution. 3T3-Cas9 cells were expanded and transduced with CRISPR sgRNA lentivirus library at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3 by spinoculation (1,000 x g) at 32\u00b0C for 30 min in 12-well plates. After selection with puromycin for 7 days, ~1 x 108 cells were inoculated with CHIKV-181/25-mKate2 (MOI of 1) and then incubated for 24 h to allow nearly all cells to become infected. Cells were sorted for an absence of mKate2 expression using a Sony Biotechnology Synergy SY3200 Cell sorter (Siteman Flow Cytometry Core, Washington University). To enrich for the cell population that was resistant to CHIKV infection and increase the signal-to-noise ratio, the mKate2-negative cells were expanded in culture. Given the rapid replication rate and cytopathic effect of CHIKV, two humanized neutralizing mAbs5, CHK-152 and CHK-166 (2 \u03bcg/ml of each), were added to block infection by any residual virus. The expanded cells were re-infected with CHIKV-181/25-mKate2 in the absence of mAbs, sorted for mKate2 negative cells, and the procedure was repeated for one additional round.\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from the uninfected cells (5 x 107) or the mKate2-negative sorted cells (1 x 107), and sgRNA sequences were amplified30, and subjected to next generation sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Genome Technology Access Center, Washington University). The sgRNA sequences against specific genes were determined after removal of the tag sequences using the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) and cutadapt 1.8.1. sgRNA sequences were analyzed using a published computational tool (MAGeCK)6 (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).\n\nMxra8 was validated by using three independent sgRNAs as follows: Mxra8-sgRNA1, 5\u2032-CTTGTGGATATGTATTCGGC-3\u2032; Mxra8-sgRNA2, 5\u2032-TGTGCGCCTCGAGGTTACAG-3\u2032; Mxra8-sgRNA3, 5\u2032-GCTGCATGATCGCCAGCGCG-3\u2032. The sgRNAs were cloned into the plasmid lentiCRISPR v2 (Addgene #52961) and packaged with lentivirus express system. 3T3 or MEFs cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing individual sgRNA and selected with puromycin for 7 days prior to infection with different viruses. For some validation experiments, clonal cells edited by sgRNA1 were isolated by limiting dilution. To validate the human ortholog MXRA8, two different sgRNAs targeting all four isoforms were used: MXRA8-sgRNA1, 5\u2032-GGCGCGGATGCCTTTGAGCG-3\u2032; MXRA8-sgRNA2, 5\u2032-GTCCGCCTGGAGGTCACCGA-3\u2032. The sgRNAs were cloned similarly as above, and the gene-edited bulk cells were used for validation studies.\n\nFor flow cytometric analyses, gene-edited 3T3 cells were inoculated with different viruses as follows: CHIKV-181/25 (MOI of 3, 9.5 h), CHIKV-AF15561 (MOI of 10, 24 h), CHIKV-37997 (MOI of 3, 10 h), CHIKV-LR 2006 (MOI of 1, 9.5 h), ONNV (MOI of 3, 12 h), RRV (MOI of 3, 32 h), MAYV (MOI of 3, 24 h), SFV (MOI of 1, 9 h), SINV (MOI of 10, 6 h), SIN-WEEV (MOI of 10, 10 h), SIN-EEEV (MOI of 10, 10 h), VEEV-GFP (MOI of 3, 6.5 h), RVFV-GFP (MOI of 10, 8 h), VSV-GFP (MOI of 3, 6 h), WNV (MOI of 10, 25 h), and EMCV (MOI of 3, 6 h). Gene-edited MEF cells were inoculated with CHIKV-181/25 (MOI of 3, 8 h), CHIKV-AF15561 (MOI of 10, 10h), CHIKV-37997 (MOI of 1, 10 h), and CHIKV-LR 2006 (MOI of 1, 8 h). Gene-edited MRC-5, RPE, and HFF-1 cells were inoculated with CHIKV-181/25 (MOI of 10, 10 h), CHIKV-AF15561 (MOI of 10, 10 h), and CHIKV-LR 2006 (MOI of 1, 10 h). Gene-edited Hs 633T cells were inoculated with CHIKV-181/25 (MOI of 15), CHIKV-AF15561 (MOI of 15), and CHIKV-LR 2006 (MOI of 3) for 11.5 h. At the indicated times, cells were harvested with trypsin, and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with Perm buffer (HBSS supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% (w/v) saponin, and 2% FBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells then were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 \u03bcg/ml of the following virus-specific antibodies: CHIKV (mouse CHK-115), ONNV and MAYV (mouse CHK-48), RRV (human 1I9); SINV (ascites fluid, ATCC VR-1248AF), SFV (mouse CHK-124), VEEV (mouse 1A4A), WEEV (mouse 11A1), EEEV (mouse EEEV-10), WNV (human E1631), EMCV (mouse serum). After washing, cells were incubated with 2 \u03bcg/ml of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-human IgG (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were processed on a MACSQuant\u00ae Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec), and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).\n\nValidation also was performed by an infectious virus yield assay. Gene-edited 3T3 cells were plated 12 h prior to infection. Cells were inoculated with CHIKV-181/25, CHIKV AF15561, CHIKV-LR 2006 at an MOI of 0.01 or other alphaviruses (BEBV, MOI 0.001; BFV, GETV, UNAV, MIDV, and SFV, all at MOI of 0.01) for 1 h, then washed once and maintained in reduced 2% FBS culture media. Supernatants were harvested at specific times after infection for titration on Vero cells by focus-forming assay (CHIKV) or standard plaque assay (all other viruses).\n\nTo assess for effects of Mxra8 on CHIKV replication, we transfected capped viral genomic RNA into MEFs. Capped genomic RNA was generated using an mMESSAGE mMACHINE\u2122 SP6 Transcription Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific #AM1340) from the NotI-linearized CHIKV-181/25 cDNA clone. 1 \u03bcg of purified RNA was transfected into control or \u0394Mxra8 cells using the Neon transfection system according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were then incubated in 15 mM NH4Cl to prevent subsequent rounds of infection. At specified times, cells were harvested with trypsin and processed for E2 expression levels by flow cytometry.\n\nMLV-GFP pseudoviruses were made as described32,33 except plasmids encoding structure proteins of CHIKV (strain 37997), VEEV (strain TrD), and EEEV (strain FL91-4697) were used. Pseudovirus entry in 3T3 cells expressing or lacking Mxra8 was assessed 36 h later by measuring GFP expression by flow cytometry.\n\nThe C-terminal FLAG tagged mouse Mxra8 corresponding to the transcript (NM_024263) was synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) and cloned into the lentivirus vector pCSII-EF1-IRES-Venus with restriction sties NotI/BamHI. The Mxra8 sgRNA target sequences were mutated (cttgtggatatgtattcggcg to ctGgtCgaCatgtaCAGCgcg) to avoid re-cutting by Cas9 protein for the trans-complementation assay. Based on this plasmid, a truncation lacking the cytoplasmic domain was constructed by PCR-mediated mutagenesis \u0394C-tail (378-442). To express the GPI anchored Mxra8, the N-terminal 336 amino acids missing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains were fused with placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) (ctggcgccccccgccggcaccaccgacgccgcgcacccggggcggtccgtggtccccgcgttgcttcctctgctggccgggaccctgctgctgctggagacggccactgctccc) or Qa1 (tacccatacgatgttccagattacgctacgtcctcaccatccattggcggcccaaacatgactttactattggccatgatcatgtttgcgttaaagatagggtcg, HA tag is underlined) GPI anchor sequences. To assess the function of different human MXRA8 isoforms, the cDNA of isoform 2 (NM_032348.3) containing C-terminal Myc and FLAG tags was purchased from OriGene (Cat. No. RC200955), and cloned into the lentivirus vector pCSII-EF1-IRES-Venus. The Isoform 1 (NM_001282585.1), isoform 3 (NM_001282584.1), and isoform 4 (NM_001282583.1) were created by either mutagenesis of isoform 2 or gene synthesis (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.), and cloned into the lentivirus vector pCSII-EF1-IRES-Venus containing C-terminus Myc and FLAG tags.\n\nThe plasmids constructed above were packaged using the lentivirus expression system. Cells transduced with these lentiviruses were sorted for Venus-positive cells by flow cytometry. 3T3 cells were inoculated with CHIKV-181/25 (MOI 3) for 9.5 h, or CHIKV-AF15561 (MOI 10) for 20 h. HeLa and A549 cells were inoculated with CHIKV-181/25 (MOI 3), CHIKV-AF15561 (MOI 10), or CHIKV-LR 2006 (MOI 1) for 14 h. 293T cells were inoculated with CHIKV-181/25 (MOI 1), CHIKV-AF15561 (MOI 3), or CHIKV-LR 2006 (MOI 0.5) for 11.5 h. CHO cells (K1 and 745) were inoculated with CHIKV-181/25 (MOI 0.3), CHIKV-AF15561 (MOI 10), or CHIKV-LR 2006 (MOI 0.3) for 12 h. Cells were then harvested and processed for E2 expression by flow cytometry.\n\nA cDNA fragment encoding the mouse Mxra8 extracellular domain (residues 22-336, GenBank accession no. NM_024263) or the human MXRA8-2 extracellular domain (residues 20-337, GenBank accession no. NM_032348.3) and the mouse IgG2a-Fc were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies) and inserted into the pCDNA3.4 vector (Thermo Fisher) downstream of an IL-22 signal peptide sequence. After confirmation by Sanger sequencing, Mxra8-Fc and MXRA8-2-Fc were expressed into Expi293 cells (Thermo Fisher). Cells were seeded at 5 x 106 cells/ml one day prior to transfection. 200 \u03bcg of plasmid was diluted in Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher) and complexed with HYPE-5 transfection reagent before addition to cells. Transfected cells were supplemented daily with Expi293 media and 2% (w/v) Hyclone Cell Boost. Four days after transfection, supernatant was harvested, centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 15 min, and purified by Protein A Sepharose 4B (Thermo Fisher) chromatography. After elution and buffer neutralization, the purified protein was dialyzed into 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.5), filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Mxra8 that was cleaved from the IgG backbone was generated by inserting an HRV cleavage sequence (LEVLFQGP) into Mxra8-Fc downstream of the Mxra8 coding sequence and prior to the mouse IgG sequence. Mxra8-HRV-Fc was expressed in Expi293 cells as described above. After purification, Mxra-HRV-Fc was cleaved using HRV 3C protease (Thermo Fisher) at a 1:10 ratio overnight at 4\u00b0C. Cleaved Fc fragments were depleted using protein A Sepharose chromatography, and the purity of Mxra8 was confirmed using SDS-PAGE analysis.\n\nCHIKV VLPs plasmids (strain 37997) were provided by G. Nabel (Vaccine Research Center, NIH) and expressed in Expi293 cells as previously described18. The supernatant was harvested four days after transfection, 0.2 \u03bcm filtered, and stored at 4\u00b0C.\n\nAnti-CHIKV human mAb 4N1219 or anti-EEEV human mAb 53 (J. Crowe, unpublished data) were immobilized (50 \u03bcl, 2 \u03bcg/ml) onto Maxisorp ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher) overnight in sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.3. Plates were washed four times with PBS and blocked with PBS supplemented with 4% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. CHIKV-181/25 or SINV-EEEV was diluted to 1.5 x 107 FFU/ml in PBS and 50 \u03bcl/well was added for 1 h at room temperature. Mxra8-Fc and respective positive (CHK-115 and EEEV-10 (A. Kim and M. Diamond, unpublished results) and negative OPC-Fc (D. Fremont, unpublished results) controls were diluted in PBS supplemented with 2% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After serial washes with PBS, plates were incubated with horseradish peroxide conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1:2000 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, plates were developed with 3,3\u2032-5,5\u2032 tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Dako) and 2N H2SO4. Absorbance was read at 450 nm with a TriStar Microplate Reader (Berthold). The mAb competition binding assay was performed by incubating 10 \u03bcg/ml of indicated anti-CHIKV human mAbs19 for 30 min prior to the addition of mMxra8-Fc, as described above; the anti-CHIKV human mAbs were mapped previously to different epitopes by alanine scanning mutagenesis and evaluated for neutralizing activity19. Humanized anti-WNV mAb E1631 was included as a negative control in competition binding assays.\n\nSurface plasmon resonance binding experiments were performed on a Biacore T200 system (GE Healthcare) to measure the kinetics and affinity of Mxra8 binding to CHIKV VLPs. Experiments were performed at 30 \u03bcl/min and 25\u00b0C using HBS-EP (0.01 M HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20) as running buffer. CHK-265 mAb5 was immobilized onto a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) using standard amine coupling chemistry, and CHIKV VLPs were captured. Recombinant Mxra8 was injected over a range of concentrations (1 \u03bcM to 20 nM) for 5 min followed by a 10 min dissociation period. As a negative control, murine norovirus was captured with mAb A6.2, as described previously34. Real-time data was analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.1 (GE Healthcare). Kinetic profiles and steady-state equilibrium concentration curves were fitted using a global 1:1 binding algorithm with drifting baseline.\n\n3T3 cells were inoculated with different viruses at the following MOI: CHIKV-181/25 (MOI of 3, 9.5 h), ONNV (MOI of 5, 12 h), MAYV (MOI of 3, 24 h), RRV (MOI of 3, 32 h), SINV (MOI of 10, 9 h), and VEEV (MOI of 3, 6.5 h). Cells were detached using TrypLE (Thermo Fisher #12605010), washed twice with cold HBSS supplemented with 15 mM HEPES and 2% FBS. Cells were incubated with 1 \u03bcg/mL of Mxra8-Fc, OPG-Fc, or viral E2-specific antibodies at 4\u00b0C for 25 min. After washing, cells were stained with goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 for 25 min at 4\u00b0C. After washing twice, cells were fixed with 2% PFA for 10 min at room temperature. After two additional washes, cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis.\n\nThe assays were conducted in suspension. MEFs cells were collected using TrypLE and washed twice with ice-cold medium supplemented with 2% FBS. CHIKV AF15561 virions were purified through a 25% glycerol cushion at 25,000 rpm for 2 h. For the binding assay, cells (5 x105) and virions (MOI of 20) were mixed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and incubated on ice for 45 min. After five cycles of centrifugation and washing, cells were lysed in RLT buffer for RNA extraction using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN #74104). For internalization assay, after 5 cycles of centrifugation and washing, cells were resuspended into medium supplemented with 2% FBS and 15 mM NH4Cl and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Cells were chilled on ice and treated with 500 ng/mL protease K on ice for 1 h. After three additional washes, cells were lysed in RLT buffer for RNA extraction. RT-qPCR was conducted with Gapdh as an internal control using a TaqMan\u2122 RNA-to-CT\u2122 1-Step Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific #4392938). Primers and probes used are as follows: Fwd-CHK181/AF: 5\u2032-TCGACGCGCCATCTTTAA-3\u2032; Rev-CHK181/AF: 5\u2032-ATCGAATGCACCGCACACT-3\u2032; Probe-CHK181/AF: 5\u2032 6-FAM/ACCAGCCTG/ZEN/CACCCACTCCTCAGAC/3\u2032 IABkFQ; Fwd-Gapdh: 5\u2032-GTGGAGTCATACTGGAACATGTAG-3\u2032; Rev-Gapdh: 5\u2032-AATGGTGAAGGTCGGTGTG-3\u2032; and Probe-Gapdh: 5\u2032 6-FAM/TGCAAATGG/ZEN/CAGCCCTGGTG/3\u2032 IABkFQ.\n\nFor the flow cytometry-based binding assay, experiments were conducted as above but with 5 x 104 cells and an MOI of 200. After binding and washing, cells were fixed and stained with a mixture of mAbs (CHK-11, CHK-84, CHK-124, and CHK-1665) (1 \u03bcg/mL) at room temperature for 25 min. Cells were washed once and stained with 2 \u03bcg/mL of goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher #A21235) for 25 min. After two additional washes, cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis.\n\nMouse or human cells were harvested with TrypLE and washed twice with cold Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with 15 mM HEPES and 2% FBS. Cells were incubated with anti-Mxra8 (mouse) armenian hamster serum (1:300), anti-Mxra8 (mouse) hamster mAbs (1 \u03bcg/mL), or anti-MXRA8 (human) mAb (1 \u03bcg/mL) (MBL International # W040-3) at 4\u00b0C for 25 min. After washing, cells were stained with 2 \u03bcg/mL goat anti-Armenian hamster IgG H&L conjugated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647 (Abcam #ab173004) or goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific #A21235) for 25 min at 4\u00b0C. After two additional washes, cells were fixed with 2 % PFA for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice and subjected to flow cytometry analysis.\n\nA CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, 2 x 104 of 3T3 or MEFs cells in 100 \u03bcl culture medium were seeded into opaque-walled 96-well plates. 24 h later, 100 \u03bcl of CellTiter-Glo\u00ae reagent was added to each well and allowed to shake for 2 min. After a 10 min incubation at room temperature for 10 min, luminescence was recorded by using a Synergy H1 Hybrid Plate Reader (Biotek) with an integration time of 0.5 second per well.\n\nCells seeded in 6-well plates were washed once with PBS, chilled on ice in PBS, and detached with a cell scraper. After spinning at 300 x g for 5 min, cell pellets were lysed in 45 \u03bcl RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling #9806S) with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich # S8830). Samples were prepared in LDS buffer (Life Technologies) under reducing (+ dithiothreitol) conditions. After heating (70\u00b0C, 10 min), samples were electrophoresed using 10% Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies) and proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes using an iBlot2 Dry Blotting System (Life Technologies). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry powdered milk and probed with hamster mAb 3G2.F5 (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) against mouse Mxra8. Western blots were developed using SuperSignal\u2122 West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate or SuperSignal\u2122 West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Life Technologies).\n\nA CHIKV E2, 6K, and E1 envelope protein expression construct (strain S27, Uniprot Reference #Q8JUX5) with a C-terminal V5 tag was subjected to alanine scanning mutagenesis to generate a comprehensive mutation library35. Each residue of the envelope proteins was mutated to alanine, with alanine codons mutated to serine. 141 mutations within the E2 A and B domains were screened for binding by Mxra8-Fc. Binding of Mxra8-Fc to each mutant expressed in HEK-293T cells was determined by immunofluorescence detected with a high-throughput flow cytometer (Intellicyt), as described previously35. Residues of domains A or B were identified as contributing to the binding site if their mutation eliminated Mxra8-Fc binding, but supported binding of CHIKV mAbs that bind to the appropriate domain (control mAbs were CHV-84, CHKV-88, IM-CHKV063, IM-CKV065, and C95,35,36).\n\nFigures were prepared using the atomic coordinates of CHIKV pE2-E1 (RCSB accession number 3N42) using the program PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.7.4 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC).\n\n4 week-old male Armenian hamsters were immunized intravenously with 100 \u03bcg of purified Mxra8-Fc. After two boosts (~ 7 months of age), spleens were harvested for hybridoma fusion and mAb production. Hybridoma supernatants were initially screened by ELISA using Mxra8-human Fc (mouse Fc was replaced by human Fc). As a second assay, we examined the binding of hybridoma supernatants to Mxra8 on the surface of 3T3 cells by flow cytometry. Finally, a tertiary screen evaluating blockade of CHIKV-181/25 infection by hybridoma supernatants was performed in 3T3 cells. After limiting dilution subcloning, the seven clones with the strongest blocking activities were selected and expanded. Antibodies were purified using protein A-Sepharose\u2122 4B (Invitrogen #101042), dialyzed in PBS, concentrated, and filtered for in vitro and in vivo experiments.\n\n2.5 x 104 of 3T3 or MRC-5 cells were seeded into 96-well plates 12 h prior to treatment. CHIKV-181/25 virions were purified through a 25% glycerol cushion at 25,000 rpm for 2 h. Serially diluted Mxra8-Fc or MXRA8-2-Fc protein was incubated with purified virions (MOI of 3) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a volume of 100 \u03bcl. The mixture was added to 3T3 or MRC-5 cells for 9.5 h or 11.5 h, respectively. Cells were then harvested for intracellular E2 expression as measured by flow cytometry. For hamster mAb blocking experiments, 3T3 or MRC-5 cells were pre-incubated with serially diluted mAbs for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a volume of 50 \u03bcl, and then purified virions (MOI of 3) in 50 \u03bcl were added and incubated for 9.5 or 11.5 h, respectively. Cells were harvested and intracellular E2 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. For hamster mAb blocking experiments on primary human cells (KE, DF, SF, OB, CH, and SMC), 2 x 104 of cells were seeded into 96-well plates 12 h prior to treatment. Cells were pre-incubated with Armenian hamster isotype control (Bio X Cell # BE0260), 1H1.F5, or 9G2.D6 mAb for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a volume of 50 \u03bcl (50 \u03bcg/ml), and subsequently, purified CHIKV-AF15561 virions (MOI of 15) in 50 \u03bcl were added and incubated for 10.5 h. Cells were harvested and intracellular E2 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n3T3 cells (105) expressing GPI-anchored Mxra8 were harvested using TrypLE and washed twice with PBS. Cells were then treated with 1 U/mL of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (Sigma-Aldrich #P8804) in 50 \u03bcl PBS at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After two more cycles of washing, cells were stained for Mxra8 expression and processed aby flow cytometry analysis as described above.\n\nExperiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health after approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Washington University School of Medicine (Assurance number A3381-01). Mxra8-Fc or an IgG control (JEV-13 mAb) (250 \u03bcg per mouse in PBS) was administered to four week-old WT male C57BL/6J mice 6 h prior to subcutaneous inoculation in the footpad with 103 FFU of CHIKV-AF15561. Alternatively, in co-injection experiments, CHIKV or ONNV was mixed directly with Mxra8-Fc or JEV-13 (25 \u03bcg per mouse in PBS), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min before inoculation. At 12 h, 24 h, and 72 h post infection, animals were euthanized, and after perfusion with PBS, indicated tissues were harvested. For antibody pre- or post-treatment experiments, 300 \u03bcg of purified hamster mAbs 1G11.E6 + 7F1.D8, 4E7.D10 + 8F7.E1, and isotype control PIP (Bio X cell # BE0260) in PBS were administered via an intraperitoneal route to four week-old WT male C57BL/6 mice 12 h prior or 8 or 24 h post subcutaneous inoculation in the footpad with 103 FFU of CHIKV AF15561. Virus was titrated by FFA as described5 using mouse CHK-115 for CHIKV or mouse CHK-48 for ONNV as the detection antibody. Joint swelling was monitored at 72 h post infection via left foot measurements (width x height) using digital calipers as described previously37. Samples sizes were estimated to determine a difference of 3 to 5-fold, depending on data distribution. Blinding and randomization were not performed.\n\nStatistical significance was assigned when P values were < 0.05 using Prism Version 7 (GraphPad). Cell culture experiments were analyzed by multiple t-tests with a Holm-Sidak correction or ANOVA with a multiple comparison correction. Analysis of levels of joint swelling or viral burden in vivo was determined by a Mann-Whitney, ANOVA, Kruskal Walllis, or unpaired t-test depending on data distribution and the number of comparison groups.\n\nThe authors declare that all data supporting the findings of this study are available within the paper and its Supplementary information. The Supplemental Tables provide data for the CRISPR-Cas9 screen, statistical analysis, and alanine scanning mutagenesis mapping of the Mxra8-Fc binding site on CHIKV."}
