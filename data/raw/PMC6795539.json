{"title": "A single T cell epitope drives the neutralizing anti-drug antibody\nresponse to natalizumab in multiple sclerosis patients", "body": "Blood samples were collected from two MS patients (A and B) who had a\nhypersensitivity reaction following infusion of NZM and developed high titers of\nADAs. Patient A was treated with NZM at the University Hospital for Neurology in\nInnsbruck, Austria, in 2014, while patient B was treated at the Mondino\nFoundation in Pavia, Italy, in 2018. Both patients provided written informed\nconsent for this study. The study was approved by the Ethical committees of\nInnsbruck (UN2013-0040_LEK) and Pavia (P-20170027756). Blood samples were\nprocessed to obtain serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). For\nserum preparation, whole blood was collected in Vacutainer tubes (BD\nBiosciences) containing clot activators and kept at room temperature until a\nclot was formed. The tube was centrifuged at 2,000g for 10 min at 22\u00b0C,\nand the serum fraction was stored at \u221280\u00b0C. PBMCs were isolated\nfrom whole blood through Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and were\nresuspended in freezing medium for long-term storage in liquid nitrogen.\n\nA variant of NZM in which the human Fc was replaced with the murine\ncounterpart (NZM-mFc) was produced by molecular cloning and used in ELISA and\nFACS assays to avoid reactivity with secondary anti-human Fc\u03b3-specific\nantibodies. Briefly, synthetic genes expressing the NZM heavy chain and light\nchain variable regions (KEGG DRUG Database entry: D06886) were produced by\nGenscript and sublconed into vectors for expression of chimeric human CH1-murine\nIgG2a heavy chain (mFc) and human Ig\u03ba, respectively. The chains were\nexpressed following transient transfection of these vectors into Expi293F cells\n(ThermoFisher Scientific) using polyethylenimine. Cell lines were routinely\ntested for mycoplasma contamination. NZM CDR swap variants were designed by\naligning the sequences of NZM with those of the human antibodies\n(21/28\u2019CL and REI) used for humanization (GenBank accession numbers\nAAA52825 and 751419A), synthetized by Genscript and subcloned into the mFc\nvector. NZM deimmunized variants were synthetized by Genscript and subcloned\ninto vectors for expression of full human IgG4. The antibodies were purified by\nprotein A or protein G chromatography (GE Healthcare) and concentrated by Amicon\nUltra filter units (100K, Millipore). For SPR, mass-spectrometry and T cell\nexperiments, NZM IgG was purified from TYSABRI\u00ae drug solution for\ninfusion (Biogen). Total IgGs were quantified by Pierce BCA protein assay\n(ThermoFischer).\n\nMonocytes were isolated from PBMCs by positive selection using CD14\nmagnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech). CD14-depleted fractions were stained on\nice for 15\u201320 min with the following fluorochrome-labeled mouse\nmonoclonal antibodies: CD8-PE\u2013Cy5 (clone B9.11; cat. no. A07758),\nCD14-PE\u2013Cy5 (clone RMO52; cat. no. A07765), CD16-PE\u2013Cy5 (clone\n3G8; cat. no. A07767), CD45RA-FITC (clone ALB11; cat. no. A07786) from Beckman\nCoulter, CD19-PE\u2013Cy7 (clone SJ25C1; cat. no. 341113), CD25\u2013PE\n(clone M-A251; cat. no. 555432) from BD Biosciences, CD4\u2013PE\u2013Texas\nRed (clone S3.5; cat. no. MHCD0417) from ThermoFisher Scientific,\nCCR7\u2013BV421 (clone G043H7; cat. no. 353208) from BioLegend, Alexa Fluor\n647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (cat. no. 109-606-170) from Jackson\nImmunoResearch. IgG+ memory B cells were sorted from CD19+\nB cells to over 98% purity on a FACSAria III (BD). Memory CD4+ T\ncells were sorted to over 98% purity after exclusion of na\u00efve\nCD4+ T cells (CD45RA+CCR7+) and\nCD8+, CD14+, CD16+, CD19+,\nCD25bright cells.\n\nB cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM\nglutamine, 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids, 1% (v/v) sodium pyruvate,\npenicillin (50 U/ml), streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/ml) (all from Invitrogen) and\n10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, characterized, GE Healthcare Life Science).\nSorted IgG+ memory B cells were immortalized with Epstein\u2013Barr\nvirus (EBV) and plated in single-cell cultures in the presence of CpG-DNA (2.5\n\u03bcg/ml) and irradiated PBMC-feeder cells, as previously\ndescribed12. Two weeks\npost immortalization, the culture supernatants were tested by ELISA for binding\nto NZM-mFc as well as to a control antibody of an irrelevant specificity. B cell\ncultures that tested positive only for NZM-mFc were isolated and expanded.\n\ncDNA was synthesized from selected B cell cultures, and both the VH and\nVL genes were sequenced as previously described22. The genes that encoded the VH and VL and the\nnumber of somatic mutations were determined by analyzing the homology between\nthe genes encoding the VH and VL sequences of the monoclonal antibodies and the\nknown genes encoding human V, D and J regions that are present in the\ninternational immunogenetics information system (IMGT) database (version\n3.4.17)23.\nAntibody-coding sequences were amplified and sequenced with primers specific for\nthe V and J regions of the given antibody. Sequences of the unmutated common\nancestor (UCA) of the VH- and VL-coding genes were constructed using\nIMGT/V-QUEST23 and\nsynthetized by Genscript. To calculate the frequency of mutations, the entire\nsequence of each heavy chain variable region was compared to the germline\nsequence to identify replacement (R) and silent (S) mutations. The selection\nstrength was estimated using BASELINe framework which compares the observed\nfrequencies of replacement and silent mutations with the expected ones24. All calculations were done\nusing the \u201ccalcBaseline\u201d and \u201cgroupBaseline\u201d\nfunctions from SHazaM (version 0.1.11)25. Sequences encoding antibody heavy and light chains\nwere cloned into vectors for expression of human IgG1, Ig\u03ba and\nIg\u03b3, and the chains were expressed following transient transfection of\nthese vectors into Expi293F cells, as described above. Selected antibodies were\nalso expressed as antigen-binding fragments for X-ray crystallography\nanalysis.\n\nTotal IgGs were quantified using 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) coated\nwith 10 \u03bcg/ml goat anti\u2013human IgG (SouthernBiotech, cat. no.\n2040-01). Plates were then blocked with PBS with 1% BSA and incubated with\ntitrated monoclonal antibodies, using Certified Reference Material 470\n(ERMs-DA470, Sigma-Aldrich) as a standard. Plates were then washed and incubated\nwith 1/500 alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti\u2013human IgG\n(Southern Biotech, cat. no. 2040-04). Substrate (para-nitrophenyl phosphate\n(p-NPP), Sigma) was added and plates were read at wavelength of 405 nm to\ndetermine optical density (OD) values. To test specific antibody binding, ELISA\nplates were coated with 1 \u03bcg/ml of NZM-mFc or a control antibody to test\nfor nonspecific binding. Plates were blocked with PBS with 1% BSA and incubated\nwith titrated sera or monoclonal antibodies, followed by 1/2,500 AP-conjugated\ngoat anti-human IgG, Fc\u03b3 fragment specific antibody (Jackson\nImmunoResearch, cat. no. 109-056-098), goat anti-human serum IgA, \u03b1 chain\nspecific (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 109-055-011), or goat anti-human IgM,\nFc5\u03bc fragment specific (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 109-055-129). In\nsome dissociation assays, the samples were supplemented with 25% (vol/vol) of an\nalkaline dissociation buffer (2.5% Triton X-100, 2M ethanolamine, 0.15M NaCl, pH\n11.6) one minute before the end of incubation. To test antibody binding to NZM\nCDR swap variants, ELISA plates were coated with 2 \u03bcg/ml goat\nanti\u2013mouse IgG, human adsorbed (Southern Biotech, cat. no. 1030-01) and\nblocked with PBS with 1% BSA. After washing, the plates were incubated with 2\n\u03bcg/ml of NZM CDR swap variants, followed by monoclonal antibodies at 2\n\u03bcg/ml concentration and 1/2,500 AP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG,\nFc\u03b3 fragment specific antibody. A heat map of the patterns of antibody\nbinding to the 64 NZM CDR swap variants was computed by using the default\nclustering parameters of the heatmap.2 function from \u2018gplots\u2019\npackage in R in which the Euclidean metric and complete aggregation method were\nselected.\n\nTo study the kinetics of interaction of NZM-specific monoclonal ADAs,\nNZM IgG (50 nM) was stabilized in 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.5, and immobilized\nonto a EDC/NHS pre-activated ProteOn sensor chip (Biorad) through amine\ncoupling; unreacted groups were blocked by injection of ethanolamine HCl (1 M).\nHEPES buffered saline (HBS) (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005%\nsurfactant Tween-20) was used as running buffer. All injections were made at\nflow rate of 100 \u03bcl/min. Monoclonal ADAs were diluted to 30 nM and\ninjected onto the NZM coated chip; one channel of the chip was injected with HBS\nand used as reference for the analysis. Injection time and dissociation time\nwere 240 s and 600 s, respectively. The binding interaction of each antibodies\nwith NZM was assessed using a ProteON XPR36 instrument (BioRad). SPR data were\nprocessed with ProteOn Manager Software and ka (1/Ms), kd\n(1/s) and KD (M) parameters were calculated applying the Langmuir fit model.\n\nSerial dilutions of NZM and NZM variants IgG4 were prepared in MACS\nbuffer (PBS 1% FBS, 2mM EDTA). T cells isolated from healthy donors were used as\nsource of the cell adhesion molecule \u03b14-integrin and added (50,000\ncell/well) to the plates for 30 min, 4\u00b0C. T cells were washed and stained\nwith 3.75 \u03bcg/ml Alexa Fluor 647\u2013conjugated goat anti-human IgG\n(Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 109-606-170) for 30 min, 4\u00b0C. Cells\nwere washed and analyzed by FACS. NZM binding was calculated as percentage of\nIgG+ stained cells. To study NZM neutralization, NZM-mFc was\ndiluted to 5 ng/ml (final concentration) in MACS buffer (PBS 1% FBS, 2mM EDTA)\nand incubated with titrated monoclonal antibodies for 1 h, 37\u00b0C. T cells\nwere added to the plates for 30 min, 4\u00b0C, then washed and stained with\nsecondary goat anti-mouse-IgG-PE (SouthernBiotech, cat. no. 1030-09) at 1\n\u03bcg/ml for 30 min, 4\u00b0C. Cells were washed and analyzed by FACS. NZM\nneutralization was calculated for each well as percentage of inhibition of\nbinding of NZM-mFc to T cells with the following formula: 1 \u2013 % of cells\nstained by NZM-mFc. Gates were defined based on negative and positive\ncontrols.\n\nNZM, NAA32 and NAA84 antibodies were produced as antigen-binding\nfragments and purified on IMAC (HitrapTM IMAC HP, GE Healthcare). Stable\ncomplexes of NZM-NAA32 and NZM-NAA84 were prepared in D-PBS buffer (PBS\nDulbecco\u2019s Gibco 14190-094) at 1.5:1 molar ratio, purified by\nsize-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE healthcare) and concentrated to\n10 mg/ml. Crystal were grown by vapor diffusion with a well solution containing\n1.7 M sodium malonate pH 6 at 292 K (NZM-NAA32) or 35 % PEG400, 200 mM NaCl, 4 %\nMPD, 100 mM MES pH 6 (NZM-NAA84), and they typically appeared within a week.\nCrystals were flash frozen and x-ray data were collected at the European\nSynchrotron Radiation Facility (Beamline ID30A-1, Grenoble) using MxCube2\nsoftware. Data collection and processing statistics are outlined in Supplementary Table 3.\nStructure solution was performed by molecular replacement using MOLREP (version\n11.6.03)26 through the\nCCP4 suite (version 7.0.058)27\nand crystallographic refinement was carried out using BUSTER (version\n2.11.7)28. The shape\ncorrelation statistic Sc of protein interface was calculated with CCP4.\nSuperimposition was performed using the structure of the NZM-\u03b14\u03b27\nintegrin complex as a reference (4IRZ, https://www.rcsb.org/).\nSurface area is calculated based on Van der Waals surfaces of atoms of NZM lying\nat 4\u00c5 distance from any atom of NAA32 or NAA84. For deimmunization of\nNZM, the CDR2 of the light chain of the antibody was modelled by mutating\nresidues that were positioned at more than 4.0 \u00c5 distance from\n\u03b14-integrin as observed in the 4IRZ structure and did not affect the\nconformation of the antibody CDR region. A non-exhaustive search was performed\nand a number of potential mutations were selected for mutagenesis.\n\nT cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM\nglutamine, 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids, 1% (v/v) sodium pyruvate,\npenicillin (50 U/ml), streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/ml) (all from Invitrogen) and\n5% heat-inactivated human serum (Swiss Red Cross). Sorted memory CD4+\nT cells were labelled with 5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl\nester (CFSE, ThermoFisher) and cultured at a ratio of 2:1 with irradiated\nautologous monocytes untreated or pre-pulsed for 2-3 h with a peptide pool\n(15mers overlapping of 10) covering the entire sequence of the variable region\nof the NZM heavy and light chains (NZM peptide pool, 3 \u03bcM per peptide,\nproduced by A&A Labs). After 12 days, cells were stained with antibodies\nto CD25\u2013PE (BD Biosciences, clone M-A251, cat. no. 555432) and\nICOS\u2013Pacific Blue (Biolegend, clone C398.4A, cat. no. 313522).\n\nProliferating activated T cells from ex-vivo stimulated\ncultures were sorted as CFSElowCD25+ICOS+ and\ncloned by limiting dilution. T cell clones reactivity was determined by\nstimulation with irradiated autologous monocytes or B cells, untreated or\npre-pulsed for 2-3 h with NZM peptide pool (3 \u03bcM per peptide) or, in some\nexperiments, with recombinant NZM (5 \u03bcg/ml). T cell clones proliferation\nwas measured on day 3 after 16 h incubation with 1 \u03bcCi/ml\n[methyl-3H]thymidine (Perkin Elmer). Positive T cell clones were\nselected based on a cut-off value of (i) counts per minute (cpm) with antigen\nand antigen-presenting cells (APCs) \u22651000, and (ii) stimulation index\n\u22651.5 (cpm with antigen and APCs / cpm with APCs only). To determine MHC\nrestriction, stimulation assay was performed in the absence or presence of\nblocking anti-MHC-II monoclonal antibodies produced in house from hybridoma cell\nlines (anti-HLA-DR, clone L243 from ATCC, cat. no. HB-55; anti-HLA-DQ, clone\nSPVL329; anti-HLA-DP,\nclone B7/2130). Epitope\nmapping was performed by stimulation of T cell clones with irradiated\nEBV-immortalized B-cell (EBV-B) clones, untreated or pre-pulsed for 2-3 h with\nindividual peptides (15mers overlapping of 10) covering the entire sequence of\nthe variable region of the NZM heavy and light chains (3 \u03bcM per\npeptide).\n\nSequence analysis of rearranged TCR V\u03b2 genes of NZM-specific T\ncell clones was performed as previously described31. Briefly, cDNA from individual T cell clones\nwas obtained by reverse transcription of total RNA from\n103-104 cells per reaction. Rearranged TCR V\u03b2\ngenes were PCR amplified using forward primer pool targeting V\u03b2 genes,\nand reverse primer pairing to C1\u2013C2 \u03b2-chain constant region.\nSequence amplification was assessed through agarose gel electrophoresis;\nsuccessfully amplified fragments were sequenced by Sanger method, and TCR\nsequence annotation was carried out by using IMGT/V-QUEST algorithm23.\n\nHLA genotype of the patients was determined by reverse sequence-specific\noligonucleotides probes (revPCR-SSO) DNA typing (LABType, One Lambda Inc.)\nperformed at the IRCCS San Matteo Hospital Foundation, Pavia, Italy. Predicted\nIC50 (nM) binding values of all theoretical NZM-derived peptides (15mers\noverlapping of 14) to HLA-DRB1 alleles carried by the two patients and to a\nreference set of nine HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DRB3/4/5 alleles including DRB1*0301,\nDRB1*0701, DRB1*1501, DRB3*0101, DRB3*0202, DRB4*0101, DRB5*010115 and DRB1*13:01/14:0116 were calculated using\nNetMHCIIpan 3.2 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCIIpan-3.2/)14.\n\nNZM-specific EBV-B clones isolated from the two patients were pulsed\novernight with 5 \u03bcg/ml NZM at a cellular density of 5x106\ncells/ml. MHC-II complexes were purified from about 109 NZM-pulsed\nEBV-B cells with a protocol adapted from Bassani-Sternberg M. et al32. Briefly, the B cells were\nlysed with 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% octyl-\u03b2-D glucopyranoside\n(Sigma), 0.2 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM EDTA, and Complete Protease Inhibitor\nCocktail (Roche) in PBS at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. The lysates were cleared by 20\nmin centrifugation at 18,000 g at 4\u00b0C, and MHC-II complexes were purified\nby immunoaffinity chromatography with the anti-HLA-DR/DP/DQ HB-145 monoclonal\nantibody produced in house from hybridoma cell line IVA12 (ATCC, cat. no.\nHB-145) and covalently bound to Protein-A Sepharose beads (Thermo Fisher\nScientific). In detail, the cleared lysates were loaded 3 times into the\naffinity columns at 4\u00b0C, and subsequently washed at 4\u00b0C with 10\ncolumn volumes of 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris\u2022HCl, pH 8 (buffer A); 10 column\nvolumes of 400 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris\u2022HCl, pH 8; 10 column volumes of buffer\nA; and finally 10 column volumes of 20 mM Tris\u2022HCl, pH 8. The HLA-II\ncomplexes were eluted at room temperature by addition of 500 \u00b5l of 0.1 M\nacetic acid, in total five elutions for each sample. Small aliquots of each\neluted fraction were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE to evaluate yield and purity of\nMHC-II complexes. Sep-Pak tC18 (Waters, Milford, MA) cartridges were used for\nfurther separation of peptides from MHC-II subunits. The cartridges were\nprewashed with 80% acetonitrile (AcN) in 0.5% formic acid, followed by 0.2%\ntrifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and subsequently loaded 3 times with each fraction\neluted from the immunoaffinity column. After loading, the cartridges were washed\nwith 0.2% TFA, and the peptides were separated from the more hydrophobic MHC-II\nchains by elution with 30% AcN in 0.2% TFA. The peptides were further purified\nusing a Silica C18 column tip (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) and eluted\nagain with 30% AcN in 0.2% TFA. Finally, the peptides were concentrated by\nvacuum centrifugation, and resuspended in 2% AcN, 0.1% TFA, 0.5% formic acid for\nMS analysis.\n\nMHC-II peptides were separated on an EASY-nLC 1200 HPLC system coupled\nonline to a Q Exactive mass HF spectrometer via a nanoelectrospray source\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded in buffer A (0.1% formic acid)\non in-house packed columns (75 \u03bcm inner diameter, 50 cm length, and 1.9\n\u03bcm C18 particles from Dr. Maisch GmbH) and eluted with a non-linear 120\nmin gradient of 5%\u201360% buffer B (80% ACN, 0.1% formic acid) at a flow\nrate of 250 nl/min and a column temperature of 50\u00b0C. The Q Exactive was\noperated in a data dependent mode with a survey scan range of 300-1650 m/z and a\nresolution of 60,000 at m/z 200. Up to 10 most abundant isotope patterns with a\ncharge \u2265 1 were isolated with a 1.8 Th wide isolation window and\nsubjected to higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) fragmentation at a\nnormalized collision energy of 27. Fragmentation spectra were acquired with a\nresolution of 15,000 at m/z 200. Dynamic exclusion of sequenced peptides was set\nto 30 s to reduce the number of repeated sequences. Thresholds for the ion\ninjection time and ion target values were set to 80 ms and 3E6 for the survey\nscans and 120 ms and 1E5 for the MS/MS scans, respectively. Data were acquired\nusing the Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific). MaxQuant software was used to\nanalyze mass spectrometry raw files. MS/MS spectra were searched against the\nfull-length NZM heavy and light chains sequences, the human Uniprot FASTA\ndatabase, and a common contaminants database (247 entries) by the Andromeda\nsearch engine33. N-terminal\nacetylation and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications; no\nfixed modifications were selected; the enzyme specificity was set to\n\u201cunspecific\u201d with a minimum peptide length of 8 amino acids. A\nfalse discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was required for peptides. Peptide\nidentification was performed with an allowed precursor mass deviation of up to\n4.5 ppm and an allowed fragment mass deviation of 20 ppm; \u201cmatch between\nruns\u201d option was disabled.\n\nGraphPad Prism 7 software was used for to perform all the statistical\nanalyses. EC50 (ng/ml) and IC90 (ng/ml) values were calculated for every\nantibody tested with the different ELISA assays and the inhibition of NZM\nbinding assay, respectively, by nonlinear regression analysis using the GraphPad\nPrism 7 software. A two-tailed Spearman\u2019s correlation was performed to\ncorrelate NZM neutralization (IC90) with association constant (ka)\nand dissociation constant (kd). \u201cn\u201d indicates the\nnumber of antibodies tested. With 17 or more pairs, GraphPad Prism 7 software\ncomputes an approximate P value for nonparametric correlation. An extremely\nsignificant P value is indicated as P < 0.0001."}
