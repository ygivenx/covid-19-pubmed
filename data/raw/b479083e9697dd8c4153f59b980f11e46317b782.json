{"title": "Structural and Inhibitor Studies of Norovirus 3C-like Proteases", "body": "Noroviruses (genus norovirus in the family Caliciviridae) are the most common cause of food-and water-borne acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide (Eckardt and Baumgart, 2011; Green, 2007; Koo et al., 2010; Patel et al., 2009 ). In the US alone, up to 21 million estimated cases of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis occur each year (2010). Due to its high contagious nature, norovirus outbreaks in cruise ships, army barracks, schools, and hospitals can cause significant morbidity. Furthermore, norovirus infections may lead to fatality in children, the elderly and immuno-compromised patients (Green, 2007) . Therefore, norovirus infection constitutes an important public health problem, as well as a potential bioterrorism threat.\n\nNoroviruses are highly diverse with multiple genotypes (GI to GV) with currently genotype II as the most prevalent in the field. Recently, outbreaks of extremely virulent norovirus, GII.4 Syndey strain (first discovered in Australia in March 2012) continues to spread globally, including the US (Desai et al., 2012; MMWR, 2013; van Beek et al.) . This emerging norovirus strain is associated with increased rates of hospitalizations and deaths (Desai et al., 2012) . Although norovirus is classified as a Category B bioterrorism agent by CDC, currently there is no norovirus-specific antiviral therapeutics or vaccine partly due to the inability to grow human noroviruses in cell culture (Atmar et al., 2011; Tan and Jiang, 2008) . Thus there is an urgent and unmet need for the discovery and development of antiviral therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of norovirus infection. Our group has focused on the discovery and development of small molecules as anti-norovirus therapeutics with enzyme and /or cell based assay systems (Dou et al., 2011a; Dou et al., 2011b; Dou et al., 2012; Dou et al., 2011c; Kim et al., 2011; Mandadapu et al., 2013a; Mandadapu et al., 2012; Mandadapu et al., 2013b; Pokhrel et al., 2012; Tiew et al., 2011) .\n\nNoroviruses have a single-stranded, positive sense 7-8 kb RNA genome, which encodes a polyprotein precursor processed by a virus-encoded 3C-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) to generate intermediate or mature functional non-structural proteins. Since processing of the polyprotein is essential for virus replication, viral 3CLpro has been targeted for the discovery of anti-norovirus small molecule therapeutics. Norovirus 3CLpro is characterized with a chymotrypsin-like fold and a cysteine residue acting as a nucleophile in the active site. Norovirus 3CLpro has N-terminal anti-parallel -sheet domain and C-terminal -barrel domain and the catalytic site consisting of C139, H30, and E54 is present in the cleft between the domains. The structures of Norwalk virus protease (NV 3CLpro) (Zeitler et al., 2006) , Chiba virus protease (CV 3CLpro) (Nakamura et al., 2005) , Southampton virus protease (SV 3CLpro) bound with a Michael acceptor peptidyl inhibitor (Hussey et al., 2011) , and MNV 3CLpro (Leen et al., 2012) have been determined by X-ray crystallography.\n\nOur group has previously reported the backbone and side-chain resonance assignments of NV 3CLpro by solution NMR spectroscopy (PDB: 2LNC) (Takahashi et al., 2013; Takahashi et al., 2012) , and 3D structure of NV 3CLpro without or with a protease inhibitor (GC376) by X-ray crystallography (PDB: 3UR6, 3UR9) . In addition, the design, synthesis, and evaluation of transition state inhibitors of norovirus 3CLpro, including GC376 (a dipeptidyl compound), was recently reported by our group Mandadapu et al., 2012; Tiew et al., 2011) . In this study, the proteolytic activities of three 3CLpro from Norwalk virus (NV, genogroup I), MD145 (genogroup II) and murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1, genogroup V) were optimized for a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, and compared for the inhibitory activities of a synthetic protease inhibitor (GC376). The comparative analysis of 3CLpro from different genogroups of noroviruses may provide further basic knowledge of substrate (inhibitor)-protease interactions, as well as finding broadly active inhibitors against diverse noroviruses. In addition, we describe the comparative analysis of the apo NV 3CLpro and NV 3CLpro-GC376 determined by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy.\n\nThe expression of 3CLpro from NV and MD145 was described previously by our lab . The 3CLpro from MNV-1 was expressed for the comparative studies in this study. The multi-alignment of 3CLpro from NV, MD145 and MNV-1 showed that overall amino acid sequences of three 3CLpro are conserved well (Figure 1 ). The full-length cDNA corresponding to the complete amino acid sequence of MNV-1 3CLpro was amplified using primers of MNV 3CLpro-6hisXba-F (5'-tctagaaaggagatataccATGcatcatcatcatcatcat gccccagtctccatctggtcc-3', underlined and italic sequences are the start codon and His-tag sequences, respectively) and MNV 3CLpro-Xho-R (5'-ctcgaggcggccgctcatcactggaACTccagagcctcaag-3', underlined sequences are the stop codon). The primers contain cDNA sequences include start and stop codons as well as sequences encoding N-terminal six His-Tag for Ni column purification. The amplicon was cloned into the pET28a vector using enzyme sites of Xba I and Xho I. The plasmid encoding MNV-1 3CLpro was transformed into E.coli BL21 cells, and expressed in a regular Luria-Bertani broth media by induction with 1 mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 hrs at 37 C\u00b0 in a shaking incubator. The harvested cells were sonicated and ultracentifuged. The expressed protease was soluble and the supernatants were applied to a Ni-NTA affinity column (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) for purification.\n\nTo increase the sensitivity of norovirus FRET enzyme assay, we used new dye and quencher combination of 5-FAM and QXL520 and compared with the pair of Edans and Dabcyl. The FRET substrate, 5-FAM-DFHLQGP-QXL520 which derived from the P5-P2' residues on the NS1-2/3 cleavage site in ORF1 of NV was synthesized by AnaSpec, Inc (Fremont, CA). The designation of substrate residues for P1 and P1' starts at the scissile bond and counts toward the N-or C-terminus, respectively, as suggested by Schechter and Berger (Schechter and Berger, 1967) . We reported the optimization of FRET assay for norovirus 3CLpro with a substrate with the Edans/Dabcyl FRET pair, Edans-DFHLQGP-Dabcyl , which was also used in this study for comparative analysis. For FRET protease assays, the stock solutions (10 mM) of the substrates were prepared in DMSO, and diluted in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES buffer [pH 8.0] containing 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 60 % Glycerol, and 6 mM DTT). The 3CLpro was mixed with substrates in assay buffer in 50 \u00b5l in a 96-well black plate (Nalgen Nunc International, Rochester, NY). The fluorescence signals were detected using an excitation and emission wavelength of 490 and 520 nm on a fluorescence microplate reader (FLx800, Biotek, Winooski, VT). The relative fluorescence units (RFU) were calculated for each well by subtracting background fluorescence (substrate only) from the total fluorescence in each well.\n\nThe synthesis and activity of a protease inhibitor compound GC376 against NV 3CLpro and in NV replicon-harboring cells were reported elsewhere . The dipeptidyl compound was designed based on the substrate specificity and showed excellent inhibitory activity in the enzyme (NV 3CLpro) and cell (NV replicon-harboring cells) based assay . While GC376 was designed as a protease inhibitor against norovirus 3CLpro, it also demonstrated a broad spectrum activity against related 3C or 3CL protease of picoranviruses and coronarviruses . The stock solution (10 mM) of GC376 was prepared in DMSO and further diluted in assay buffer. The final concentrations of DMSO in the assay did not exceed 1.5% (vol/vol). The 3CLpro from NV, MD145 or MNV-1 were incubated with various concentrations (0.01 to 50 \u00b5M) of GC376 in 25 \u00b5l of assay buffer for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Following incubation, 25 \u00b5l of assay buffer containing substrate was added, and the mixtures were incubated in a 96-well black plate at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min. The fluorescence signals were detected using an excitation and emission wavelength of 490 and 520 nm on a fluorescence microplate reader. The RFU were calculated for each well, and the dose-dependent FRET inhibition curves were fitted with variable slope (four parameters) using GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA) in order to determine the IC 50 values of GC376.\n\nWe recently reported the crystal structure of apo NV 3CLpro and the complex of GC376-NV 3CLpro without detailed analysis. In this study, we report further analysis of apo NV 3CLpro with other previously reported NV 3CLpro or CV 3CLpro (Nakamura et al., 2005; Zeitler et al., 2006) , and the complex of GC376-NV 3CLpro was also comparatively analyzed with previous report of the complex of CV 3CLpro-Acetyl-EFQLQ-CH=CHCOO- (Hussey et al., 2011) . The interactions of NV 3CLpro and GC376 from X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopic analysis was also compared.\n\nWe previously reported the interaction of NV 3CLpro with a nonspecific protease inhibitor, chymostatin, with NMR spectroscopic analysis . Using similar approach, we investigated the interaction of NV 3CLpro with GC376 which is a specific inhibitor designed to inhibit norovirus 3CLpro from our lab. Briefly, 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra were recorded on 15 N-labeled NV 3CLpro with different concentrations of GC376, and chemical shift perturbation of the 1 H and 15 N backbone resonances of NV 3CLpro were observed during titration with the inhibitor. We have previously reported the backbone and side-chain assignments NV 3CLpro by solution NMR spectroscopy (Takahashi et al., 2013; Takahashi et al., 2012) . NMR experiments were performed at 25 \u00b0C on a Varian 500 MHz VNMR system (Varian Inc., now Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a 5 mm cryogenic triple-resonance inverse detection pulse-field gradient NMR probe. All NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995) , and analyzed with Sparky (Goddard TD., 2006) and CARA software (http://www.nmr.ch) (Keller, 2004) . A 0.3 mM of 15 N-labeled NV 3CLpro solution dissolved in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, with 200 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, and 3 mM NaN3 was used to perform the inhibitor titration experiments. Stock solution of GC376 (~50 mM) dissolved in d6-DMSO (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) was prepared and added directly into the 15 N-labeled NV 3CLpro sample. 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra of NV 3CLpro were recorded for titration points correspond to GC376/NV 3CLpro molar rations of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0. Final concentration of DMSO was 3%, and this concentration has been confirmed to have negligible effect on chemical shift changes of NV 3CL pro in our previous study . All the spectra were acquired with complex points 1024 \u00d7 128 and spectral widths of 14 \u00d7 38 ppm in the 1 H and 15 N dimension. Because chemical shift changes caused by addition of GC376 were relatively large for some residues, additional 15 N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum (mixing time 100 ms) was measured and analyzed to confirm assignments of backbone amide chemical shift for those residues. Chemical shift changes by the presence of GC376 were characterized using a weighted chemical shift difference ( \u2122 = [1/2{( H ) 2 +(0.2 N ) 2 }] 1/2 ), where H,N represents chemical shift changes in the proton and nitrogen dimensions on addition of the inhibitor (Grzesiek et al., 1996) .\n\nThe optimal concentrations of each protease and the substrate (5-FAM-DFHLQGP-QXL520) were determined for the FRET assay. The optimal concentrations of enzyme and the substrate were 0.03 and 1.6 \u00b5M for NV and MD145 3CLpro, respectively, and 0.057 and 1.6 \u00b5M for MNV 3CLpro, respectively. These combinations of 3CLpro and substrate gave strong signals with minimal backgrounds. A protease inhibitor, GC376, previously designed and reported from our lab was used to probe the inhibition of 3CLpro from different noroviruses, NV, MD145, and MNV-1. The IC 50 values of GC376 against 3CLpro from NV, MD145, and MNV-1 were comparable among tested viruses in the FRET assay (Table  1) . However, the IC 50 values of GC376 against each 3CLpro were 3-5.3 fold lower in the FRET assay using 5-FAM-DFHLQGP-QXL520, compared to those with Edans-DFHLQGP-Dabcyl (Table 1) .\n\nThe structure of NV 3CLpro was determined as dimer by X-ray crystallography in our study (refined to 1.50 \u00c5 resolution), which is consistent with the previous reports (Nakamura et al., 2005; Zeitler et al., 2006) . The N-terminal end including the -helix region and the regions between aII and bII -strands including the loops of C-terminal domain were in closed proximity to the dimeric interface ( Figure 3A ). When our monomer structure was compared to the previously determined NV 3CLpro by other group (Zeitler et al., 2006) , they were closely overlaid with minor variations at the substrate recognition areas including M101-R112, K146-V152 and T161-T166 ( Figure 3B ). Our solution 3D structure of NV 3CLpro (Figure 4) showed minor differences in the secondary structures, compared with the crystal structures of NV or CV 3CLpro previously determined by other groups (Nakamura et al., 2005; Zeitler et al., 2006) . The solution structure of NV 3CLpro by NMR spectroscopy has one -helix in N-terminal domain with 12 -strands, and its overall organization of -helix and -strands are similar to the crystal structures of NV 3CLpro (Zeitler et al., 2006) , except extra -strand consisting of residues 72-77 found in the solution structure ( Figure 4B and 5).\n\nWe also determined the structure of NV 3CLpro-GC376 complex by X-ray crystallography and the interaction between the enzyme and inhibitor was studied in comparison to a previous report of the complex of SV 3CLpro-Acetyl-EFQLQ-CH=CHCOO- (Hussey et al., 2011) . In this complex, GC376 was covalently bound to NV 3CLpro, and multiple hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor and amino acids of the enzyme were identified . The amino acids including H30, Q 110, T134, C139, H157, A158, A160 were found to participate in the interaction with GC376 ( Figure 5A ) and Acetyl-EFQLQ-CH=CHCOO-( Figure 5B ). Additional amino acids, Arg108 and Lys162 were shown to interact with Acetyl-EFQLQ-CH=CHCOO- (Hussey et al., 2011) .\n\nA series of 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra of NV 3CLpro with increasing concentrations of GC376 were analyzed to identify the residues of NV 3CLpro involved in the interaction with GC376. NMR chemical shift perturbations of backbone amide ( 1 H and 15 N) resonances in the 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra are sensitive probes for changes in chemical environments surrounding amino acid residues and/or in the relative populations of different conformations in protein structural ensemble (Shuker et al., 1996) . The weighted chemical shift differences of 1 H-15 N resonances for NV 3CLpro in the presence of varying concentrations of GC376 were compared to those observed in the absence of the compound ( Figure 6A ). Significant chemical shift changes were observed in the high concentrations of GC376 ( Figures 6A) , indicating the specific interaction between NV 3CLpro and GC376. In the presence of 5-fold molar excess of GC376, the residues of NV 3CLpro that showed significantly shifts ( d \u2265 0.07) were G15, W16, H30*, V31, V32*, H50*, A52, E54*, F55*, Q57*, E74*, K88, R89, G102, A103*, I104, A105, Q110*, L113, V114, H115, G119, G133, T134, G137*, D138, C139, P142, Y143*, V152, H157, T161, K162* and S163* (amino acids for the triad are underlined). The residues that could not be traced out due to the peak disappearance and/or line broadening are marked with asterisks and the largest positive values ( d \u2265 0.35) in Figure 6B . The line-broadening effects are likely indicative of chemical exchange on the slow time scale (\u00b5s-ms) due to the conformational dynamics of NV 3CLpro interacting with GC376. Figure 6C shows the residues that significantly shifted in the presence GC376 in NV 3CLpro, and the shifted residues include amino acids involved in the hydrogen bonds with the compounds except A158 and A160 ( Figure 5A ), and other amino acids mostly located in the active sites.\n\nNorovirus 3CLpro is a cysteine protease with chymotrypsin-like folds with two domains, Nterminal twisted anti-parallel -sheet domain and C-terminal -barrel domain. The active site with catalytic residues, C139, H30, and E54 are present in the cleft between the domains. The 3D crystal structures of NV 3CLpro (PDB: 3UR6, 3UR9, 2FYQ, 2FYR) Zeitler et al., 2006) , CV 3CLpro (PDB: 1WQS) (Nakamura et al., 2005) , and Southampton virus (SV) 3CLpro bound with a Michael acceptor peptidyl inhibitor (PDB: 2IPH) (Hussey et al., 2011) have been previously reported. Our multi-alignment of 3CLpro from NV (GI), Southampton (GI), Chiba (GI), MD145 (GII) and MNV-1 (GV) demonstrated that while overall amino acid sequences of all 3CLpro are conserved well, 3CLpro of MNV-1 is more divergent from the other proteases ( Figure 1 ) with especially high divergence in the loop between cI and dI -strands and C-terminal region of MNV-1 3CLpro. Other than those two regions, however, there is a high homology of 3CLpro including the long loop between cII and dII -strands (amino acid residues from 119 to 139), which is known to be the major area for the interaction between the enzyme and substrate. The H30, E54 and C139 in the active site are conserved among the proteases except amino acid E54 was replaced with D54 in the MNV 3CLpro (Figure 1) . The substrate specificity of noroviruses of different genogroups is also well conserved, and the FRET assays with NV, MD145 and MNV-1 3CLpro showed that they are capable of processing the substrate derived from NS2/3 cleavage sites of NV (Figure 2 ). The amino acid identities of different norovirus 3CLpro were found to be approximately 90% within the genogroup and 50-70% among different genogroups (Figure 1) . The FRET assay also revealed that the 3CLpro from different genogroups were similarly inhibited by a dipeptidyl protease inhibitor, GC376, suggesting that a drug may be developed that are broadly active against multiple norovirus genogroups.\n\nWe also examined and compared the structure of NV 3CLpro expressed in our lab with Xray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of apo NV 3CLpro (PDB: 3UR6) and the complex of NV 3CLpro-GC376 (PDB: 3UR9) were recently reported by our group . NV 3CLpro expressed in our lab exists as dimers by X-ray crystallography, which is consistent with other reports (Nakamura et al., 2005; Zeitler et al., 2006) . However, the interface between two molecules (monomers) was different from the previous reported NV 3CLpro (PDB:2FYQ) (Zeitler et al., 2006) . It was reported that the regions of bII and cII -strands of NV 3CLpro were in close proximity to the dimeric interface (Zeitler et al., 2006) . However, in our study, the N-terminal end including thehelix region and the region between aII and bII -strands including the loop of C-terminal domain were in closed proximity to the dimeric interface ( Figure 3A) . Interestingly, size exclusion and analytical ultracentrifuge analysis showed that NV 3CLpro exists as a monomer in solution Takahashi et al., 2013) . These findings suggest that monomer/dimer state of NV 3CLpro may depend on the experimental conditions.\n\nOverlay of our apo NV 3CLpro with NV 3CLpro available in the protein database (PDB: 2FYQ) (Zeitler et al., 2006) showed that their overall fold was well conserved with minor differences in the regions of M101-R112, K146-V152 and T161-T166 (Figure 3) . The NMR structure of NV 3CLpro in our study also showed minor differences in those regions with overall conserved folds. It was demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of NV 3CLpro is predominantly involved in the interaction with the substrate, in which the binding occurs in the manner of anti-parallel -sheet via hydrogen bond network between the substrate and the protease. Thus, the observed differences are speculated to be originated from high internal dynamics in those regions that are involved in the interaction of substrates. The regions with minor differences in structure encompass the highly disordered loop (L121-G140), most of which have no visible electron densities in the norovirus 3CLpro crystal structure (T123-G133) (Nakamura et al., 2005; Zeitler et al., 2006) . The amino acids in the disordered loop are highly conserved among norovirus proteases, suggesting their crucial role in the interactions with substrates. Our apo NV 3CLpro also demonstrated that the loop had no visible electron densities (Figure 3) .\n\nWe have shown that GC376 is effective in inhibiting norovirus 3CLpro and in replication of noroviruses in cell based assays including NV replicon-harboring cells and MNV-1 Tiew et al., 2011) . We also previously reported the co-crystallization of enzymeinhibitor by X-ray crystallography . The structure of NV 3CLpro-GC376 complex showed that the dipeptidyl compound was covalently bound to Cys residue of the enzyme ( Figure 5A ). Also the structure identified several hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor and amino acid residues including H30, Q110, T134, C139, H157, A158, and A160 in the protease. These amino acids were shown to be also involved in the interaction of SV 3CLpro with Acetyl-EFQLQ-CH=CHCOO-( Figure 5B modified with PDB: 2IPH, Hussey et al., 2011) . Of note, additional two amino acids, R108 and K162 in SV 3CLpro, were shown to interact with Acetyl-EFQLQ-CH=CHCOO-, most likely due to its longer length compared to GC376. In this study, we determined the interaction of NV 3CLpro and GC376 with NMR spectroscopy and compared it to that with X-ray crystallography. In NMR structure of the complex, H30, Q110, T134, C139 and H157 among the amino acids showing hydrogen bonds with GC376 were significantly shifted ( Figure 6 ). Furthermore, additional amino acids adjacent to those directly interacting with the inhibitor were significantly affected as shown in Figure 6C . These findings are consistent with those as determined in the crystal structure using X-ray diffraction. It was reported that NV 3CLpro has the catalytic triad in the active site with a C139 (the nucleophile), H30 (the general base), and G54 (an anion that correctly positions the imidazole ring of the active site H) (Zeitler et al., 2006) . It was also suggested that some norovirus 3CLpro (such as CV 3CLpro) may have the catalytic dyad (Nakamura et al., 2005) . In this study with NV 3CLpro, significant conformational changes were also observed the residues of the catalytic triad in the presence of inhibitor such as GC376 chymostatin .\n\nWe previously reported chymostatin inhibit norovirus 3CLpro in the FRET assay, but it is not effective on inhibiting virus replication in cell based system . Chymostatin is a tetrapetide protease inhibitor with F at P1 and L (V or I) at P2, capreomycidine at P3, and N-alpha-carbonyl at P4 sites. In that study, the chemical shift mapping by the interaction of NV 3CLpro and chymostatin was also investigated using NMR chemical shift perturbation method. Amino acids residues involved in the interaction between NV 3CLpro with chymostatin include E54, Q110, C139 and H157. Overall profiles of amino acids involved (shifted) in the interaction with chymostatin or GC376 were similar, but more amino acids were shifted by chymostatin in compared to those by GC376. The size-differences between chymostatin (tetrapeptidyl) and GC376 (dipeptidyl) may be the reason for why more amino acids were shifted by chymostatin. Nonetheless, GC376 has comparable (or better) activity than chymostatin in inhibiting norovirus 3CLpros in the enzyme assay, which suggests that the dipeptidyl structure has a minimum requirement for the enzyme inhibition. It is also noted that while GC376 is active in the cell culture systems including the replicon-harboring cells and MNV-2, chymostatin did not show any activity in cell-based assay.\n\nIn summary, we performed comparative studies of 3CLpro from three noroviruses of different genogroups and comparative structural analysis of apo NV 3CLpro or NV 3CLpro-GC376 complex with X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. The results of this report provide insight of the structures NV 3CLpro as well as substrate/inhibitor interaction for better understanding of the enzyme function and antiviral drug development.\n\nThree norovirus 3C-like proteases from different genogroups were optimized for a FRET assay -\n\nThe apo 3D structures of Norwalk virus 3C-like protease were further analyzed -\n\nThe binding mode of Norwalk virus 3C-like protease with a synthetic inhibitor (GC376) was analyzed Multi-alignment of 3CLpro from various GI, GII and GV norovirus strains.
