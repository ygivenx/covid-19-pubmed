{"title": "Infection Control of 2019 Novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) in Cancer Patients undergoing Radiotherapy in Wuhan", "body": "A pandemic of 2019 novel corona virus disease , which was first reported in Wuhan city, has affected more than 100,000 patients worldwide.\n\nPatients with cancer are at a higher risk of COVID-19, but currently, there is no guidance on the management of cancer patients during this outbreak. Here, we report the infection control measures and early outcomes of patients who received radiotherapy (RT) at a tertiary cancer centre in Wuhan.\n\nWe reviewed all patients who were treated at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (ZHWU) from Jan 20 to Mar 6, 2020 . This preceded the city lock-down date of Jan 23, 2020. Infection control measures were implemented, which included a clinical pathway for managing suspect COVID-19 cases, on-site screening, modifications to the RT facility, and protection of healthcare workers. Primary end-point was infection rate among patients and healthcare staff. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the 5 th edition criteria. during the study period. No healthcare worker was infected.\n\n.

It is therefore imperative that RT services are not affected during this outbreak. Here, we report our experience and preliminary outcomes of 209 RT patients, who were treated at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (ZHWU) during the period when the city was locked down on Jan 23, 2020.\n\n.

The start-date of the study period preceded the commencement of the lock-down of Wuhan city on Jan 23, 2020. Patient's demographics, medical history, contact history, clinical symptoms and examination, haematological and biochemical investigations, and results of the computed tomography (CT) of the chest were obtained. Data cut-off date for the study was Mar 6, 2020. This study was approved by the institutional review board of ZHWU (2020039). As aggregated, anonymised patient data was used in this study, waiver of consent was approved by the ethics committee.\n\nThe workflow for screening of both hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients is outlined in CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .\n\nthe characteristic CT change of COVID-19 pneumonia is the presence of ground-glass changes in the outer zone of one or both lungs. This method of diagnosis for COVID-19 is considered more reliable than the SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, since CT manifestations tend to appear earlier than nucleic acid detection. 7 If either the CT or laboratory results were abnormal, the suspect cases would then be sent to the outpatient fever clinic for further assessment. Throat swab samples would be collected and tested using the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. While waiting for the outcome of the RT-PCR test, patients would be quarantined in a dedicated area within the hospital compound to mitigate the risk of nosocomial spread. Contact, droplet and airborne precautions were undertaken for the suspect cases. In the event of a positive RT-PCR result or highly suspicious CT findings, patients would be transported to a designated infectious disease hospital for isolation, observation, and treatment. For patients with normal results, they will be admitted to the hospital for RT or receive RT as an outpatient.\n\nWe employed the following workflow to screen all patients and health-care workers (nurses, radiation therapists, physicists ,physicians and paramedics):\n\n1) All people entering the treatment area must record a body temperature of less than 37.3\u2103 prior to entry; 2) they would be screened again for contact history; 3) they must don a three-ply surgical mask at all times; and 4) strict hand hygiene must be practised.\n\nPatient holding area should be well-ventilated.

To date, more than 100,000 humans have been infected, and the numbers are likely to increase. Perhaps among the natural history of this virus infection, the predominant characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 is its remarkably high infectivity potential, where an infected individual can spread the virus to two to three other individuals when in close proximity. 8 While large-scale epidemiological studies from China have suggested that young and elderly individuals are equally susceptible to 9 it has also been shown that the latter subgroup, as well as patients with co-morbidities like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac conditions are more likely to succumb to severe illness. 10 Hence, there is a real concern about the impact of COVID-19 in patients with cancer. To date, two case series have identified that patients with cancer habour an approximately two-fold increased risk of COVID-19, and reasons underpinning these observations include older patients, immunosuppressive therapies, and recurrent hospital visitations. 5, 11 Robust infection control measures are therefore crucial to prevent cross-transmission between patients and between patient and healthcare workers within the compounds of a cancer centre.\n\nHerein, we shared our single institution experience in the management of cancer patients undergoing RT from a cancer centre that was based in Wuhan, where the outbreak first started. Our infection control protocol was comprehensive, covering a stepwise clinical pathway to manage suspect cases (questionaire, CT, and RT-PCR assays), on-site screening, re-organisation of the RT facility, and protection of healthcare workers. The extremely low rates of infection among our patients (0.48%) and healthcare workers (0%) were a testament to the efficacy of our measures.\n\nNotably, one patient who was treated in our RT facility became infected .

We were able to establish a contact history with 70 other patients over the preceding 14-day window. Amazingly, none of the patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia on follow-up, which again highlights the effectiveness of our infection control protocol. Unfortunately, due to the lock-down, only 18 of these patients were able to resume RT, as the remaining 52 patients were not allowed to return to the city. Some limitations of this study deserve mention. First, it is apparent that the number of patients decreased substantially following the lock-down (a 10-fold drop in case-load; Figure 3) . While it is unknown if such a meticulous protocol would be applicable in high-volume cancer centres from other parts of the world, reduction of case-load constitutes a key step of limiting human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and thus, patients' treatment ought to be prioritised accordingly. Finally, it is important to assess the impact on the long-term prognosis of these cancer patients, especially for those individuals who were unable to resume their treatment, which is the undesired consequence of a lock-down and robust infection control measures.\n\nTo conclude, we described infectious control measures that were undertaken to prevent human-to-human transmission among patients with cancer undergoing RT and healthcare workers. The early result of a 0.48% infection rate validates the effectiveness of our protocol. Longer-term follow-up will inform on the implications of this pandemic on the survival outcomes of cancer patients.\n\n.
