{"title": "Genomic characterization of a proventriculitis-associated infectious bronchitis coronavirus", "body": "Proventriculitis has been seen in chickens throughout the world since the early 1970s [1]. However, the causative agent has not yet been definitively established. Both infectious and dietary agents have been implicated as contributing causes [1]. Some studies have reported infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to be a candidate etiological agent [2, 3]. In mid-1995, there was an outbreak of disease in the eastern China characterized by a swollen proventriculus and since then this disease has become endemic in China. Several proventriculitis-associated IBV strains have been isolated and analyzed [4\u20137], but the full genomes of these viruses have not yet been determined. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of the proventriculitis-associated IBV isolate ZJ971 [4, 8].\n\nThe entire genome of ZJ971 is 27,627 nucleotides (nt) in length (GenBank accession No. EU714028), with an A + T content of 61.8%, excluding the polyA tail, and has the same genomic organization as the classical IBV strain Beaudette [9]. Its 5\u2032-UTR is 528 (1\u2013528) nt in length. Gene 1 (polymerase gene) consists of 19,836 nt, encompassing ORF 1a and ORF 1b. ORF 1a is 11,802 nt in length (529\u201312,330) and encodes a polyprotein of 3933 amino acids (aa; polyprotein 1a, pp1a), while ORF 1b is 7,959 nt in length (12,405\u201320,363), and encodes a protein of 2652 aa (pp1b). Gene 2 (spike, S) of ZJ971 is 3,489 nt in length (20,314\u201323,802), and encodes a protein of 1162 aa. There is a 50 nt overlap between the 3\u2032-end of ORF 1b and the 5\u2032-end of the S gene. Gene 3 is 678 nt in length, and contains three ORF: 3a (23,802\u201323,975), 3b (23,975\u201324,169), and the envelope (E) protein (3c, 24,150\u201324,479). The length of gene 4 (membrane protein, M) is 678 nt (24,451\u201325,128), with a 29 nt overlap between the 3\u2032-end of the E gene and the 5\u2032-end of the M gene. There is a non-coding region of 359 nt between the 3\u2032-end of the M gene and gene 5. Gene 5 contains ORF 5a (25,488\u201325,685) and 5b (25,682\u201325,930). Gene 6 (25,873\u201327,102) encodes the N protein (409 aa). There is a 58 nt overlap between the 3\u2032-end of 5b and the 5\u2032-end of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. The 3\u2032-UTR of ZJ971 is 525 nt long, 205 nt and 20 nt longer than those of strains M41 (AY851295) and Beaudette (NC_001451), respectively.\n\nThe complete genomic sequence of ZJ971 is very similar to that of the vaccine strain H120 (FJ888351), which is widely used in China, with 99.8% sequence identity, and only 54 nucleotide substitutions and a deletion of three bases in the 3\u2032-UTR detected in ZJ971. The 54 nucleotide substitutions were distributed throughout the genome, two in 5\u2032-UTR, 35 in gene 1, 14 in the S gene, two in the N gene, and one in the 3\u2032-UTR. The 35 nucleotide substitutions in gene 1 resulted in 19 amino acids changes, with six in non-structural protein (nsp) 2 (198T \u2192 A, 322G \u2192 D, 331S \u2192 P, 358A \u2192 T, 475A \u2192 V, and 501 V \u2192 I), three in nsp3 (1126 N \u2192 D, 1489 N \u2192 D, and 1910R \u2192 K), three in nsp4 (2348I \u2192 M, 2498 N \u2192 T, and 2562R \u2192 K), two in nsp5 (2772G \u2192 V and 2879A \u2192 T), two in nsp7 (3368E \u2192 K and 3418I \u2192 V), one in nsp12 (4488P \u2192 Q), one in nsp13 (4919P \u2192 S), and one in nsp15 (6129I \u2192 M). The 14 nucleotide substitutions in S gene resulted in nine aa substitutions, including seven in the S1 subunit (19A \u2192 V, 52 I \u2192 V, 118G \u2192 V, 122I \u2192 L, 130S \u2192 F, 355E \u2192 Q, and 440T \u2192 I) and two in the S2 subunit (1047S \u2192 F and 1136R \u2192 K). The two nucleotide substituions in the N gene resulted in one amino acid change (22S \u2192 P). There are eight epitope clusters within the S glycoprotein of IBV strain D207, located between amino acid residues 24\u201361 (S1D), 132\u2013149 (S1E), 291\u2013398 (S1C/A/B), 497\u2013543 (S1F), 548-574(S2G), and 1095-1118(S2H) [10, 11]. Three of the nine aa difference between the S proteins of H120 and ZJ971 were located in these epitope clusters (52 I \u2192 V, 130S \u2192 F, and 355E \u2192 Q).\n\nThese findings suggest ZJ971 could be a variant of IBV strain H120, with mutations distributed throughout the genome."}
