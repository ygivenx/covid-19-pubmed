{"title": "", "body": "Patients' demographic and clinical profiles are shown in online Technical Appendix Table 1 (http://wwwnc.cdc. gov/EID/article/21/12/15-1421-Techapp1.pdf). Of the 17 patients, 9 had severe disease (4 required mechanical ventilation, 4 required supplemental oxygen; 1 died) and 8 had mild disease. Serial serum samples were collected and analyzed. The study was approved by the SNU Institutional Review Board.\n\nAntibody to MERS-CoV was detected by using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and MERS-CoV S1 IgG ELISA (EUROIMMUN, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) (4,5) (online Technical Appendix). MERS-CoV EMC was used for the PRNT assay; a 50% PRNT endpoint (PRNT 50 ) was used because it was more sensitive than the 90% PRNT cutoff in detecting mild infections (6) . The ELISA was based on the recombinant spike S1 region of strain EMC because that region is sufficiently divergent between different coronavirus species and expected to lead to less cross-reaction (4) .\n\nOverall, serologic responses were robust and were detected in most patients by week 3 of illness (Figure) . Of the 12 patients who had serum samples tested beyond day 18 of illness, 9 had PRNT 50 titers >1:320 by day 21 and 2 more had titers >1:320 by day 28. Patient L, a 56-year-old woman with no underlying disease, had weakly positive PRNT 50 (1:20) and borderline ELISA responses (optical density ratio 1.0), even at day 32 of illness. A chest radiograph showed she had lung infiltrates, but she was not oxygen-dependent and was not administered antiviral drugs or corticosteroids; her recovery was uneventful.\n\nAntibody responses in patient A, a 38-year-old man, were delayed up to 16-18 days after illness onset (Figure) . He required mechanical ventilation, and on illness day 14, he was given convalescent-phase plasma (200 mL; antibody titer unknown) from the outbreak index patient's wife (1) . The next day, antibody responses were undetectable in the patient's serum by PRNT or ELISA. By day 18, he had a PRNT 50 antibody titer of 1:10 and a negative ELISA response; strong antibody responses developed from day 21 onwards. We hypothesize that the data from the first 21 days of illness represent his own serologic response, unaffected by the passive transfusion with convalescentphase plasma on day 14; thus, these data were included in the analysis. Patient A was given a second infusion of convalescent-phase plasma on day 24, and serologic data after day 21 were excluded from analysis.\n\nWe constructed a statistical model in which age, sex, incubation period, concomitant conditions, and therapy with corticosteroids or antiviral drugs were adjusted for disease severity. We assessed how these factors were associated with the time from illness onset to commencement of the log-phase antibody response (Table 1 ) and the time for the antibody response to reach a titer of 1:40 (PRNT 50 ) or become positive in the ELISA (online Technical Appendix Table 2 ). An accelerated failure model was used for a more natural interpretation of the median time from illness onset to the aforementioned antibody responses (online Technical Appendix). Because the increase in antibody titers exhibited an S-shaped pattern, we assessed the rate of change in antibody response after the commencement of the exponential phase by manually removing data from the steady state, thus restricting antibody data to the logphase response ( Table 2) . A linear mixed model was used to test the potential difference in the rate of increase by the above factors (online Technical Appendix). Patients with severe disease had significant delays in the commencement of PRNT 50 antibody responses (Table 1 ) but had a steeper slope to the antibody response once it began (Table 2) . Thus, a delayed adaptive immune response may contribute to increased severity, and passive therapy with convalescent-phase immune plasma may be clinically beneficial. In avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection of humans, earlier antibody responses and a faster rate of increasing antibody titers were associated with milder disease (8) , but in SARS-CoV infection, earlier antibody responses were associated with an adverse outcome (9).\n\nEast respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, by days after illness onset, as determined by using a 50% endpoint plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT 50 ) (A) and an S1 IgG ELISA (B). Key indicates individual patients; red inicates patients with severe illness requiring mechanical ventilation; blue indicates patients with severe illness requiring only supplemental oxygen therapy; and green indicates patients with mild illness. For better presentation, the PRNT 50 titers have been jittered vertically (random noise added to prevent overplotting) (7) by adding random numbers to the titers within the range of \u22120.2 to 0.2 at the log scale. OD, optical density. Extensive contact tracing during the outbreak enabled us to determine the date of MERS-CoV exposure and incubation periods for patients (online Technical Appendix Table 1 ). A longer incubation period was associated with earlier commencement of antibody responses detectable by ELISA (Table 1; online Technical Appendix Table 2 ) and with a steeper slope to the response once it began ( Table  2 ). Even after adjusting for disease severity, the use of interferon and antiviral drugs was associated with earlier commencement of antibody responses detectable by ELI-SA ( Table 1) . The time to commencement of response was similar for men and women, but the slope of the response was steeper for male patients ( Table 2) .\n\nAn understanding of MERS-CoV antibody response kinetics helps in defining the window during which passive antibody therapy may be useful. In our study, this window was the first 21 days of illness for most patients. However, some patients may not develop strong antibody responses even after 4 weeks of illness, so therapy must be individualized.\n\nOur study has some limitations. First, no MERS-CoV isolates from the study patients were available, so MERS-CoV EMC was the basis of the serologic assays we used. Strain EMC is a clade A virus, and the outbreak in South Korea was caused by a clade B virus (1). However, using serum from naturally infected camels, we previously showed that clade A and B viruses and genetically diverse MERS-CoVs from Egypt were serologically indistinguishable (10) . Another study reported that isolates of MERS-CoVs circulating in Saudi Arabia in 2014 were antigenically indistinguishable from the EMC strain in neutralization tests with human convalescent-phase serum (5) . Thus, it is unlikely that the use of MERS-CoV EMC in our study considerably affected the observed antibody titers. A second limitation was the small number of patients studied (n = 17) and that they were followed only through the acute stage of illness. Longer term follow-up is needed to define the duration of antibody responses. If MERS-CoV antibody responses wane, as has been reported with SARS (11), this is relevant for interpretation of seroepidemiologic studies and for finding convalescent-phase donors with high antibody titers for passive immunotherapy. It would be useful to investigate IgM antibody responses and antibody responses to other virus proteins, including the MERS-CoV nucleoprotein, especially in patient L, who had poor antibody responses.\n\nIn summary, our findings showed that an early MERS-CoV antibody response was associated with reduced disease severity. Robust neutralizing and S1 ELI-SA IgG antibody responses were mounted by the third week of illness in most patients. However, a robust response did not occur in a few patients, and infections in such patients may be undetectable by serologic and seroepidemiologic methods. *Differences in rates of change and p values were estimated by using linear mixed models; positive value indicates a faster increase in antibody titer. Given that the antibody titers exhibited an S-shaped pattern, the analysis was restricted to data for log-phase antibody responses by manually removing data from the inductive/steady-state phase. Increases in antibody titers during the log phase were compared by different factors, adjusted for disease severity, by using a linear mixed model to account for repeated measurements, assuming a linear increasing trend by days since illness onset. PRNT50 titers were first log-transformed (with base 10). OD, optical density; PRNT50, 50% endpoint plaque reduction neutralization test. \u2020Effects were adjusted for severity."}
