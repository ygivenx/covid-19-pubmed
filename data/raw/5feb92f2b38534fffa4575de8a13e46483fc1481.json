Surface immunofluoresence was detected with wt, m1, and m2 S protein (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that an endogenous protease cleaves the MHV-A59 S protein at the same position as trypsin does. The absence of cleavage of mutant m2 also implies an important role for the arginine residue at position P 1 .\n\nWe also tested whether the transition of the 150-kDa precursor protein to the gp180/90 mature form could be improved by incubating the vaccinia virus-infected and DNA-transfected cells at 32\u040a, as has been suggested by Marquardt and Helenius (1992) . No significant difference quirements for cleavage of the S protein. Four additional mutants were generated, three containing single amino S proteins. Cells were washed several times in PBS supacid changes at position P 5 , P 4 , or P 2 of the cleavage site plemented with 10 mM glycine, reacted with a 1:5 diluted and one having a deletion of the arginine residue at monoclonal antibody mix of J7.6, J1.4, and wa3.1 for 30 position P 5 (Fig. 1 ).

Substitution of the arginine residue at position P 5 by glycine (m3) had only Protein sequencing of the trypsin-generated N-terminus of the MHV-A59 S2 subunit has revealed the position a limited effect on cleavability (Fig. 3 , lanes 3 and 4). When the arginine residue at position P 4 was replaced of the cleavage site (Luytjes et al., 1987) . To determine whether the trypsin cleavage site is also recognized by by a threonine residue, no cleaved S could be detected. Neither did we observe any cleavage in which the argi-the endogenous protease that cleaves S during transport to the cell surface, we have constructed several mutant nine residue at position P 5 was deleted (Fig. 3, lanes 5, 6, 9, 10) . The presence of the endo-H-resistant 180-kDa (m) S genes. In m1 the sequence encoding the peptide R 5 -R 4 -A 3 -H 2 -R 1 , which is located at the C-terminus of S protein in both m4-and m6-transfected cells clearly demonstrates that the cleavage-negative phenotype of trypsin-cleaved S1 ( Fig. 1) , has been deleted, whereas in the second mutant (m2) the arginine residue at the P 1 position has been replaced by a glycine residue. To study the processing of both mutants, L cells were infected with the vaccinia T7-RNA-polymerase recombinant (vTF7.3) and transfected with the wild-type (wt), m1, and m2 Sexpressing plasmids. After metabolic labeling for 1 hr followed by a chase of 2 hr, the cells were lysed and S protein was immunoprecipitated using a mixture of three different S-specific monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) .\n\nIn both MHV-infected cells (see below) and in cells transfected with the wt S-encoding plasmid, S was mostly present as a 150-kDa core protein. In addition the converted into the 90-kDa cleavage product during the chase period, but no 180-kDa protein was detected (Fig.  4A, lanes 7 and 8) . Even after prolonged exposure the 180-kDa was not observed in JHM-infected cells (data not shown). The different cleavage patterns of MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM S proteins are thus not host cell dependent.\n\nTo test whether the difference in cleavability between the S proteins of JHM and A59 was dependent on the amino acid at position P 2 of the cleavage site, an A59 L cells expressing S were labeled with 100 mCi Expres 35 SS label from 7 to 11 hr posttransfection.

Immunoprecipitations were performed using an anti-S mAb mix. Proteins were subsequently incubated at 37\u040a for 16 hr without (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7) or with (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8) endo H.

Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using the mixture of S-specific mAbs mentioned earlier.\n\nIn the pulse-labeled lysates, the majority of the S protein of both wt and mutants is in the 150-kDa endo-H-sensitive form (Fig. 8B) . After the 2-hr chase period, part of the 150-kDa protein had been converted to the 180-and 90-kDa endo-H-resistant proteins (Fig. 8C, lanes 1 and  2) .

Cells were transfected with wt S (lanes 1 and 2), m40 (lanes 3 and 4), m41 (lanes 5 and 6), m42 (lanes 7 and 8), and m43 (lanes 9 and 10).

This is in receptor and that are required for subsequent membrane fusion. The large size of the predicted transmembrane contrast to the data obtained by Gombold et al.

This could prevent some conformational change at the membrane that is required for residue at position P 2 was replaced by an arginine (m7), mimicking the MHV-JHM cleavage site.

One candidate for the binding capacity. The transmembrane region, or part of it, might be involved directly in the fusion process. The endogenous protease could be furin. Furin has been shown to cleave a number of viral and cellular proteins region with the seven large hydrophobic amino acids, e.g., could possibly act as fusion peptide and the trans-at the RXR/KR or RXXR sequence (reviewed by Barr, 1991; Molloy et al. 1992) . The biological role of the difference membrane region may participate in the destabilization of the host membrane. Evidently, several regions in the between the extent of cleavage of the A59 and JHM spike proteins remains unclear, but could be related to the protein are involved in the complex fusion process.\n\nIn none of the cysteine mutants was the incorporation different pathological behavior of these viruses (reviewed by Wege et al., 1982) .\n\nof [ 3 H]palmitic acid abolished and therefore the role of acylation in coronavirus-induced syncytium formation re-It has been shown for other viruses that mutations introduced in the transmembrane region or cytoplasmic mains unclear. Since all three forms of the S protein (150, 180, and 90 kDa) were labeled with palmitic acid, tail of the surface proteins abolish the fusion activity without affecting transport to the cell surface (Mulligan palmitylation of MHV S occurs before the protein reaches the medial-Golgi, similarly to the VSV G and Sindbis E1 et al., 1992; Dubay et al., 1992; Owens et al., 1994) . Using a number of mutants, we have obtained several pieces proteins (Bonatti et al., 1989) . Mutant m41 and m42 seem to have the lowest level of acylation. This suggests that of evidence indicating that the transmembrane region of the MHV spike protein is also involved in fusion. The at least one of the cysteines, that are mutated in m41 or m42, becomes acylated. Fatty acids linked to these transmembrane mutants can be divided in two categories: (i) mutant m40, in which a charged residue at the cysteines could also have an influence on the conforma-"}
