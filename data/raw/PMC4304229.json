{"title": "A common feature pharmacophore for FDA-approved drugs inhibiting the Ebola virus", "body": "The current Ebola virus (EBOV) crisis has demonstrated that globally we are not prepared to respond with therapeutics to treat existing infections or act as prophylactics as there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMEA) approved therapeutic. More importantly this suggests we should have been prepared for a pathogen which has been known about for nearly forty years. The current EBOV outbreak is already proving remarkably costly in terms of the mortality and financial ramifications\n1,\n2. The best approaches to EBOV so far have relied on public health measures for containment\n3 which have been used in past outbreaks\n4. These lessons with EBOV will undoubtedly be important for the next virus outbreak\n5 but they also raise many questions\n6 which point to how little we know about these viruses in general, as well as how best to share knowledge openly\n7.\n\nThere have been a relatively small number of studies that have attempted to identify compounds active against EBOV. Two recent studies utilized high-throughput screens of a subset of FDA approved drugs against different EBOV strains (Zaire and Sudan)\nin vitro and\nin vivo. These independent reports suggested the promise of the antimalarials amodiaquine and chloroquine in one study\n8, while the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) clomiphene and toremifene were active in another\n9. Chloroquine to date has not progressed beyond the mouse EBOV model used in these studies. We hypothesized that we could use these four molecules to computationally define the features that are important for activity. The previous studies were not exhaustive screens of all FDA drugs and so we have taken this opportunity to suggest additional compounds. Looked at from another perspective \u201cnon-antiviral\u201d drugs may be worth following up even though their molecular mechanism is unknown. These compounds may themselves have broad antiviral activity as reports describe modest inhibitory activity against other viruses\n10\u2013\n13.\n\nSeveral studies have identified non-FDA approved drugs including an\nin silico docking approach to identify molecules targeting the viral Nedd4-PPxY interface\n14. These molecules were similar to the FDA benzimidazole and aminoquinoline\n8,\n9 compounds that were active against EBOV. Another good example is the recent\nin silico docking of 5.4 million drug-like compounds docked in the viral protein VP35 protein\n15. This identified multiple pyrrolidinones which inhibit its polymerase cofactor activity\n15. The pyrrolidinones bind to an alpha helix which is proposed as important for viral function\n16. With the limited knowledge of small molecules and potential targets we have studied whether the FDA-approved drugs that are active\nin vitro and\nin vivo versus EBOV could be targeting VP35.\n\nTwo papers from 2013 described compounds active as inhibitors of different EBOV strains\nin vitro and\nin vivo, namely amodiaquine and chloroquine in one study\n8, clomiphene and toremifene in another\n9. These active molecules were used as they have both\nin vitro and\nin vivo activity to build a common features pharmacophore with Discovery Studio 4.1 (Biovia, San Diego, CA) from 3D conformations of the molecules generated with the CAESAR algorithm. This identified key features. The pharmacophore was then used to search various databases (for which up to 100 molecule conformations with the FAST conformer generation method with the maximum energy threshold of 20 kcal/mol, were created). The pharmacophore was then used to search the Microsource Spectrum database (\nhttp://www.msdiscovery.com/spectrum.html) as well as the CDD FDA drugs dataset (\nhttps://www.collaborativedrug.com/pages/public_access). In both cases over 300 hits were retrieved initially. The van der Waals surface of amodiaquine (which was more potent than chloroquine\n8) was added to limit the number of hits retrieved\n17\u2013\n19.\n\nReceptor-ligand pharmacophores for the VP35 protein were generated from crystal structures (4IBB, 4IBC, 4IBD, 4IBE, 4IBF, 4IBG, 4IBI, 4IBJ, 4IBK) in the protein data bank PDB. Pharmacophores were constructed using the receptor-ligand pharmacophore generation protocol in Discovery Studio version 4.1 (Biovia, San Diego, CA) with a maximum number of pharmacophores (10), minimum features (4), and maximum number of features (6) as are described elsewhere\n20.\n\nPDB 4IBI was used for docking using LibDock in Discovery Studio (Biovia, San Diego CA)\n21. The proposed binding site was centered on the ligand and a site sphere created (coordinates 2.14, 20.93, 1.71) with 9.45 \u00c5 diameter. The protocol included 10 hotspots and docking tolerance (0.25). The FAST conformation method was also used along with steepest descent minimization with CHARMm. Further parameters followed the default settings. The ligand VPL57 was removed from the binding site and re-docked. The four FDA approved drugs with activity against Ebola were docked in the structure from an sdf file. Molecules were visualized alongside the original ligand VPL57 and the 2D interaction plots generated.\n\nThe pharmacophore was generated using the\nin vivo and\nin vitro active amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene (\nSupplemental Table 1) as these represent the most relevant FDA approved drugs to date. This pharmacophore consists of 4 hydrophobic features and a hydrogen bond acceptor feature (\nFigure 1). The pharmacophore with van der Waals surface was also used to search FDA drug various libraries (\nSupplemental Table 2 and\nSupplemental Table 3). The most interesting observations from this virtual screen are that various estradiol analogs score well (e.g. estradiol valerate Fit value 4.23). Previously estradiol was suggested to be active in the EBOV pseudotype assay\nin vitro\n8. In addition, dibucaine was also retrieved (Fit value 1.58) which was also active in the EBOV pseudotype assay\n8. Amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene can be used as positive controls for future screens. Because the original complete sets of FDA approved compounds screened are not publically accessible it is difficult to compare hit rates versus all compounds tested to date.\n\nThe nine receptor-ligand pharmacophores created all consisted of three to four hydrophobic features and one to two hydrogen bonding features (\nTable 1). Eight of these pharmacophores also had a negative ionizable feature. These suggest that the receptor-ligand based approach results in a general similarity across the nine structures, likely indicating the similar binding mode and importance of features for interfering with this generally hydrophobic pocket for protein-protein interactions.\n\nRedocking the 4IBI ligand in the protein resulted in an RMSD of 3.02\u00c5, which generally indicates the difficulty of predicting orientations for compounds binding in what is a relatively hydrophobic and shallow pocket (\nFigure S1). This molecule was ranked the 29\nth pose and had a LibDock score of 86.62 (\nFigure S1 higher scores are better). The four FDA approved drugs were docked into the VP35 structure 4IBI. All compounds docked similarly and overlapped with the co-crystal ligand (\nFigure 2). Amodiaquine and chloroquine had higher LibDock scores (> 90) than the 4IBI ligand, while clomiphene and toremifene had LibDock scores less than 70. All four FDA approved drugs bound similarly to the pyrrolidinone ligands in the pocket formed by residues from the \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-sheet subdomains\n15. We have highlighted proposed energetically favorable interactions of the antimalarial candidate binders with ILE295, LYS248 and GLN244, which scored favorably. Previously published studies suggested mutation of ILE295, LYS248 resulted in near-complete loss of binding activity\n15.\n\nOur previous experience with common feature and quantitative pharmacophore models has demonstrated their value in predicting novel actives from collections of FDA approved drugs\n22\u2013\n27. Candidate predicted actives may be assessed by their Fit Value to the pharmacophore model. This score can be used to prioritize compounds for eventual testing. In the current study it was hypothesized that two different classes of compounds showing activity against EBOV\nin vitro and\nin vivo may share a common pharmacophore. Construction of this pharmacophore (\nFigure 1) indicated four hydrophobic features and a hydrogen bond acceptor feature. This pharmacophore (with an added van der Waals surface to limit the number of hits retrieved) was then used to screen and score other FDA drugs from a small database and identified 120 and 124 structures for future evaluation\nin vitro testing (\nSupplemental Table 2 and\nSupplemental Table 3). Out of these compounds estradiol and dibucaine had been previously described as active in\nin vitro EBOV assays. This suggested the pharmacophore could retrieve some structurally diverse classes of known hits\n8.\n\nRecently identified co-crystal structures of the EBOV VP35 protein were used to derive receptor-ligand pharmacophores. These nine receptor-ligand pharmacophores suggested the importance of hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding and negative ionizable interactions to interfere with this protein-protein interaction (\nTable 1). Eight out of nine of the pharmacophores had one or more hydrogen bond acceptor feature. These pharmacophores are grossly similar to our ligand based pharmacophore (derived from four FDA approved drugs that inhibit EBOV), as both types of model had multiple hydrophobic features and at least one hydrogen bond acceptor. When we docked the antimalarials and SERMs into a representative VP35 structure these compounds were found to overlap with the X-ray ligand to differing extents. Amodiaquine and chloroquine had LibDock scores greater than 90 and higher than that for the redocked X-ray ligand. This indicated that VP35 may be a potential target for these two distinct classes of compounds. However, it is important to point out that we have not compared docking to other proteins in EBOV and it could also be possible that these molecules are active elsewhere as well as via other mechanisms than by specific binding to proteins\n28,\n29. Further, VP35 may be a preferred target for the antimalarials while the SERMs are not predicted to bind as well as the X-ray ligand. The use of other docking and scoring methods may produce differences in the pose and predicted binding affinity, which could be of interest for further studies.\n\nA combination of the promising efficacy of chloroquine (EC\n50 16 \u03bcM\n8) and amodiaquine (EC\n50 8.4 \u03bcM\n8) versus EBOV, their availability and likely low cost should prioritize their further laboratory exploration. Mechanistic studies against VP35 and possibly other proteins should also be pursued and may be enlightened by the observation that both of these compounds also have reported activity against other viruses. For example, chloroquine is active against human coronavirus OC43 (\nin vitro and in infected mice) as well as SARS (\nin vitro)\n10,\n30,\n31, while amodiaquine also inhibits dengue virus 2 replication and infectivity\nin vitro\n11.\n\nIn summary, this study has built on the previous publications that identified four FDA approved compounds active against different strains of EBOV\n8,\n9. Our pharmacophore model for SERMs and aminoquinolines suggests that these compounds share multiple chemical features based on their overlap to the four hydrophobic features and a hydrogen bond acceptor (\nFigure 1E) and they may have a common mechanism or target. We suggest that VP35 may be the likely target based on the overlap of receptor-based pharmacophores and docking into the crystal structure. Amodiaquine and chloroquine score particularly well in terms of docking to VP35. If this is the case it could provide a means to follow up with other small molecule analogs and/or additional FDA approved drugs that could target this protein-protein interaction. As with our other tuberculosis-focused research\n32,\n33, and computational approaches to repositioning compounds\n34 we embrace the essentiality for computational predictions to be interrogated through rigorous experimental studies. For example at least two\nin silico docking studies screened commercially available compounds\n14,\n15. We propose that docking FDA approved drugs could also be a viable first step to identifying potential compounds that could be used. We are actively seeking collaborators with experience with EBOV assays to enable further translational studies. We believe this computationally inspired approach may be applicable for other known infectious pathogens that do not have current treatments such as other viruses related to Ebola. Ultimately we need to be able to leverage such approaches to provide antivirals for future pathogens.\n\nF1000Research: Dataset 1.
