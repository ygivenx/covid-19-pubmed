Biyeom-go is prepared by the addition of Sophorae Radix and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma to the Korean Medicine herbal prescription, Hwanglyeonhaedok-tang (HHT), which consists of Coptidis Rhizoma, Cortex Phellodendri, Scutellariae Radix and GardeniaeFructus. 8, 9 ExperimentalstudieshavesuggestedthatHHThasanti-inflammatory effects by regulating inflammation-related cytokines, includingnitricoxide,prostaglandinE 2 ,interleukin(IL)-6andtumour necrosisfactor(TNF)-\u03b1, 10-12 andanti-allergiceffectsbysuppressing eosinophil and histamines. 13, 14 Biyeom-go, which is derived from HHT, is assumed to reduce various symptoms caused by nasal inflammation, including nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and sneezing, butitssafetyandeffectivenessinhumanshavenotbeenthoroughly investigated.
