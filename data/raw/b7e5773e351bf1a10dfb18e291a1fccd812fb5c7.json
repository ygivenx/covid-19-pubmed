{"title": "", "body": "Modified nucleosides constitute a major class of biologically active compounds, especially as antitumor and antiviral agents [1e4] . Cytotoxic nucleoside analogues were among the first chemotherapeutic agents to be introduced for the medical treatment of cancer [5] . Nucleoside chemistry has also evolved to facilitate efficient routes to effective agents for the treatment of viral diseases caused by HIV [6] and herpes viruses [7] . Subsequently, nucleosides, which are frequently altered in the carbohydrate or base moiety, became the focus for the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents.\n\nDuring the last decades, several branched-chain sugar nucleosides have been extensively studied for their potential antitumor or antiviral properties [8e11] . Attachment of the cyano group to the sugar moiety has been an attractive object for nucleoside chemists due to its small size and its great electron withdrawing character. Thus, cyano ribofuranose nucleosides have been reported as interesting antiviral agents [12e14] , while replacement of the hydroxyl group of 1-b-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) by the cyano group led to a new biologically active compound [15, 16] , with a novel mechanism of anticancer action [17] .\n\nLately, nucleosides bearing pyranosyl rings have been evaluated for their potential antiviral [18e20], antioxidant [21] and antibiotic [22] properties and as building blocks in nucleic acid synthesis [23, 24] . As part of our efforts to develop novel biologically active agents, we recently reported that new classes of uncommon 3 0 -fluorinated pyranonucleosides have a promising potential in combating the rotaviral infections and in the treatment of colon cancer, and are efficient as antitumor growth inhibitors [25e29] . Experimental data also revealed that human poly(A)-specific ribonuclease [30] and glycogen phosphorylase [31] are among the molecular targets of these compounds.\n\nIn view of the interesting biological activity of the fluorinated pyranonucleosides, we decided to extend our studies to the synthesis of novel molecules in which an electron withdrawing cyano group replaces the fluorine atom. Therefore, we report the stereocontrolled synthesis of novel branched-chain C-cyano pyrimidine pyranonucleosides, i.e. 3 0 -C-cyano-b-D-glucopyranonucleosides and 3 0 -C-cyano-3 0 -deoxy-b-D-allopyranonucleosides, bearing 5-fluorouracil, uracil, thymine and cytosine as heterocyclic bases, in order to assess their biological activity. The chemical synthesis and biological activity of these compounds are presented herein.\n\n3 0 -C-Cyano-b-D-glucopyranonucleosides 6aed were prepared according to the synthetic route outlined in Scheme 1. Treatment of the 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-a-D-ribo-hexofuranos-3-ulose (1) [32] with sodium cyanide in a two-phase ethylether/H 2 O system, in the presence of sodium bicarbonate, afforded the thermodynamically more stable gluco cyanohydrin epimer 2, in a virtually quantitative yield [33, 34] . The assignment of its configuration was further supported by NOE measurements, as depicted in Fig. 1 . A 5% NOE enhancement of H-2 and a 7% NOE enhancement of H-5 on irradiation of the proton of the free OH group show that these protons are on the same side of the ring system. Hydrolysis of 2 using Amberlite IR 120 (H \u00fe ) resin in methanol followed by acetylation using acetic anhydride (Ac 2 O) in pyridine [32] led to the 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-acetyl-3-C-cyano-Dglucopyranose (4). The protected, 1-(2 0 ,3 0 ,4 0 ,6 0 -tetra-O-acetyl-3 0 -Ccyano-b-D-glucopyranosyl) pyrimidine nucleosides 5aed were obtained upon coupling of the precursor material 4 with silylated 5-fluorouracil, uracil, thymine and N 4 -benzoylcytosine, respectively, in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluomethane-sulfonate (Me 3 SiOSO 2 CF 3 ), in refluxing acetonitrile [35] . The 1 H NMR spectra obtained for the protected nucleosides 5aed, showed large coupling constants between protons H-1 0 and H-2 0 (J 1 0 ,2 0 \u00bc 9.4e9.6 Hz), indicating an axial orientation of both protons and equatorially oriented base rings. Fully deprotection of 5aed, performed by saturated methanolic ammonia [36] , gave the desired nucleosides 6aed.\n\nCompound 2 was the starting material for the synthesis of 3 0 -Ccyano-b-D-allopyranonucleosides 12aed (Scheme 1). Phenoxythiocarbonylation of 2 under a commonly used condition, phenyl chlorothionoformate, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) and triethylamine (Et 3 N) in CH 3 CN [16] , afforded the 3 0 -O-phenoxythiocarbonyl derivative 7, which proved to be unstable during the purification process. Therefore, crude 7 was directly submitted to deoxygenation with Bu 3 SnH in the presence of 2,2 0 -azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN), to give the 3 0 -deoxy derivative sugar 8, in 76% overall yield. In order to elucidate the structure of the newly synthesized 8, NOE measurements were performed, as depicted in Hydrolysis of 8 using Amberlite IR 120 (H \u00fe ) resin in methanol followed by direct standard acetylation led to the 1,2,4,6-tetra-Oacetyl-3-C-cyano-3-deoxy-D-allopyranose (10) . Condensation of cyano sugar 10 with per-O-silylated 5-fluorouracil, uracil, thymine and N 4 -benzoylcytosine using Me 3 SiOSO 2 CF 3 as activator, afforded the 1-(2 0 ,4 0 ,6 0 -tri-O-acetyl-3 0 -C-cyano-3 0 -deoxy-b-D-allopyranosyl) pyrimidine nucleosides 11aed, respectively [35] . 1 H NMR data obtained for the newly synthesized nucleosides 11aed (J 1 0 ,2 0 \u00bc 9.4e9.7 Hz, J 2 0 ,3 0 \u00bc 5.0e5.2 Hz), revealed the b-configuration of the sugar moiety and an axial oriented cyano group, respectively.\n\nFinally, treatment of 11aed with hydrazine hydrate in buffered acetic acid (AcOH)epyridine gave the fully deprotected nucleosides 12aed, in yields that varied from 55% to 75%. Interestingly, attempts to deprotect 11aed by NH 3 /methanol (MeOH) under the subsequent basic conditions produced complex mixtures, containing b-elimination products, probably due to the acidity of H-3 0 and the presence of two leaving groups (OAc) at the 2 0 -and 4 0positions of the sugar moiety.\n\nThe cytostatic activity of 6aed and 12aed was determined against murine leukemia L1210, human lymphocyte CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cell cultures. The test compounds showed poor, if any cytostatic activity against the three cell lines, except the 3 0 -C-cyano-5-fluorouracil pyranonucleoside 6a that showed pronounced antiproliferative activity against all three cell lines. Its cytostatic activity spectrum was similar to that of the parent base 5-fluorouracil. It is currently unclear whether 6a is biologically active as such, or, alternatively, acts as a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, from which the free base may be released by the action of phosphorolytic enzymes and/or by a spontaneous release ( Table 1) .\n\nNone of the compounds was endowed with activity against a broad panel of DNA and RNA viruses in cell culture at 100 mM.\n\nIn conclusion, the stereocontrolled synthesis of the 3 0 -C-cyano & 3 0 -C-cyano-3 0 -deoxy pyranonucleoside analogues bearing 5-fluorouracil, uracil, thymine and cytosine, respectively was undertaken. The target nucleosides were tested for their inhibitory effects on the proliferation of murine leukemia L1210, human lymphocyte CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cell cultures. 3 0 -C-Cyano-5-fluorouracil pyranonucleoside 6a showed a similar cytostatic activity spectrum as the free base 5-fluorouracil.\n\nMelting points were recorded in a Mel-Temp apparatus and are uncorrected.

Briefly, virus stocks were titrated in CEM cells and expressed as the 50% cell culture infective dose (CCID 50 ). CEM cells were suspended in culture medium at w3 \u00c2 10 5 cells/ml and infected with HIV at w100 CCID 50 . Immediately after viral exposure, 100 ml of the cell suspension was placed in each well of a flat-bottomed microtiter tray containing various concentrations of the test compounds. After a 4-day incubation period at 37 C, the giant cell formation was microscopically determined. Compounds were tested in parallel for cytostatic effects in uninfected CEM cells."}
