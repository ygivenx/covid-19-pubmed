{"title": "A survey on infection control in emergency departments in Japan", "body": "Emergency departments are the entrance to hospitals for all patients with diseases or injuries, including emerging and re\u2010emerging infectious diseases. Some infectious diseases cause risks for secondary infection in health\u2010care providers and other patients,1 and most patients with infectious diseases are not diagnosed before admission. Patients with multidrug\u2010resistant organisms admitted to the emergency department could cause a hospital outbreak.2\n\n\nInfection control in the emergency department is important for risk management in hospitals and regions. Various infectious disease outbreaks have recently occurred around the world, including severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002,3 pandemic influenza worldwide in 2009,1 Ebola virus disease in West Africa in 2014,4 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in Korea in 2015.5 It was reported that 31 patients contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome from exposure in the emergency department at a university hospital in Taiwan.3 A single patient admitted to an emergency department in Korea caused the Korean outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015.5 These reports suggest that emergency departments can be key locations for the spread of emerging infectious diseases. However, in the abovementioned cases, the appropriateness of preparation, triage, and treatment in the emergency departments have not been reviewed. Few clinical guidelines for infection control in emergency departments have been established,6 and not all institutions have their own manuals. In addition, current situations and issues related to infection control in emergency departments have not been examined or recognized. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM)\u2010certified hospitals have infection control manuals for the emergency department, and to investigate manual contents, consulting systems, and isolation facilities. The results could contribute to establishing essential lists for preparing infection control manuals for emergency departments.\n\nThis survey was undertaken by the committee for infection control for the emergency department (JAAM) and a joint working group. Some emergency departments in Japan have inpatient units. However, this study focused on the outpatient unit of emergency departments. A total of 517 hospitals certified as educational institutions for board\u2010certified acute care physicians in Japan (JAAM\u2010certified hospitals) received a written request between March and May 2015 to provide written evaluation of infection control in the emergency department. The questionnaire (Table S1) covered the following: (i) demographics of the hospitals, (ii) contents of infection control manuals for emergency departments, (iii) consulting systems between emergency departments and infection control departments, (iv) negative\u2010pressure isolation rooms in emergency departments. The need for ethical approval was waived because the survey did not include clinical or personal data.\n\nOf 303 hospitals, 178 (58.7%) had tertiary care emergency centers (treating severe patients), and 125 (41.3%) had general emergency departments (not treating severe patients) (Table 1). The number of physicians with board certification in tertiary care emergency centers and general emergency departments is shown in Table S2. Only 154 (50.8%) of 303 hospitals had at least one board\u2010certified physician designated by the Japanese Association for Infectious Disease (JAID\u2010certified physicians; Table S3).\n\nOf 303 hospitals, 225 (74.3%) had hospital infection control manuals that included content for emergency departments and 25 (8.3%) had specific manuals for emergency departments, whereas 51 (16.8%) had no such manuals. Among the 250 hospitals that had manuals or content in manuals for emergency departments, nearly all (245, 98.0%) had contents on transmission\u2010based precautions. Almost half (115/250, 46.0%) did not include content that mentioned how to use, disinfect, and sterilize imaging examination rooms when patients were suspected of, or diagnosed with, communicable diseases. Of 50 hospitals that had three or more JAID\u2010certified physicians, 32 (64.0%) had manuals for imaging examination rooms; among 139 hospitals that had no JAID\u2010certified physicians, only 52 (37.4%) had the manuals (Table 2). Among 250 hospitals with content or manuals for emergency departments, only 44 (17.6%) had criteria for contacting the emergency medical service (EMS) when patients were suspected of, or diagnosed with, communicable diseases. Among 50 hospitals that had three or more JAID\u2010certified physicians, only 10 (20.0%) had manuals with criteria for contacting the EMS (Table 2).\n\nAlmost all hospitals (277/303, 91.4%) prepared specific manuals for the 2009 pandemic influenza.1 However, 80 hospitals (80/303, 26.4%) did not prepare specific manuals for the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa.4 Of 50 hospitals that had three or more JAID\u2010certified physicians, 43 (86.0%) prepared specific manuals for the Ebola virus disease; among 139 hospitals that had no JAID\u2010certified physicians, 96 (69.1%) prepared the manuals (Table 2).\n\nOf 303 hospitals, 292 (96.4%) had systems for emergency physicians to consult with physicians in infection control departments in person or by telephone at night and during the holidays. Among 303 hospitals, 257 (84.8%) had one or more isolation rooms in emergency departments. However, 92 (30.4%) did not have any negative\u2010pressure isolation rooms, and 45 (14.9%) did not have any isolation rooms at all.\n\nThis survey did not investigate several other elements of infection control, such as screening at admission, isolation of suspected patients, standard precautions, transmission\u2010based precautions, disinfection and sterilization of medical instruments, disinfection of medical devices and patient rooms, surveillance culture, environmental controls, control for multidrug\u2010resistant organisms, or vaccination of health\u2010care providers and all staff in the hospital.14, 15, 16, 17 In addition, the results do not reflect the situation of all JAAM\u2010certified hospitals in Japan (valid responses, 60%).\n\nPractices and guidelines for infection control in emergency departments were not sufficiently met in the hospitals studied. Such elements are required to prevent secondary infection among health\u2010care providers and staff, EMS personnel, and other patients. Therefore, education, information sharing, and a checklist for preparing manuals are needed to establish better infection control systems in emergency departments.\n\nApproval of the research protocol: N/A.\n\nInformed consent: N/A.\n\nAnimal studies: N/A.\n\nConflict of interest: JS received honoraria and research funding from Pfizer, Dainihon\u2010Sumitomo Pharma, Shionogi Pharma, Asahi\u2010Kasei Pharma, and Astellas Pharma.
