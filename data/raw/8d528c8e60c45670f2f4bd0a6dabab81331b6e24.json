{"title": "Replication of Bovine Coronavirns in Cell Line BEK-I Culture Brief Report", "body": "1V[~iBus and his associates (4--6) have demonstrated an agent with morphologic features of coronavirus by electron microscopy in fractions prepared by density gradient ultracentrifugation from diarrheal feces of calves with natural and experimentally produced neonatal diarrhea. The agent multiplied but failed to induce readily recognizable cytopathic effect in bovine embryonic kidney cell cultures (3) . The virus has been assayed therefore in these cultures by a rather cumbersome method in which the presence of the virus was determined by microscopic examination for syncytia of cultures stained with gentian violet, or by immunofluorescent technique (3). This paper describes briefly our recent observation that the virus readily replicates and induces a marked cytopathic effect in cultures of a continuous cell line, BEK-1, derived from bovine embryonic kidney (2), thus providing a sensitive, practical assay method and a satisfactory source of the virus.\n\nBEK-1 cells were grown at 37 \u00b0 C in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10 per cent tryptose phosphate broth (Difco) (TPB), 10 per cent bovine serum, 10O units/m] penicillin, 100 ~zg/ml streptomycin, and 1 ~xg/ml fungizone. The bovine corona~drus (3), at the 29th passage level in bovine embryonic kidney cells, was kindly supplied by Dr. C. A. Mebus, University of Nebraska, and was passaged twice in primary calf kidney cell cultures in our laboratory before use in the present study. BEK-1 cell cultures prepared in 10\u00d7 110 mm tubes were inoculated with 0.1 ml amounts of virus dilution, and incubated in a roller drum at 34 \u00b0 C. The maintenance medium after virus inoculation was MEM containing 10 per cent TPB, 5 per cent sodium glutamate, 1 per cent glucose, 0.1 per cent yeast extract, 0.1 per cent bovine serum albumin (Armour) and antibiotics.\n\nThe virus readily multiplied and induced marked cytopathic effect. The effect was first recognized 3 days after inoculation as rounded cells scattered in the cell sheet. As incubation progressed, round cells increased in number, fused to form syncytia, disintegrated and sloughed off the glass surface. These changes destroyed cell sheets within 4 or 5 days after inoculation (Figs. 1 a and 1 b) . Further passages were readily made with supernatant fluid from infected cultures developing cytopathic effect, and the viral yield attained ranged from 104 to 105 TCIDj0/0.1 ml.\n\nThe cytopathic effect was specifically inhibited by antiserum to the bovine coronavirus. The antiserum used was prepared in rabbits, which received an intravenous dose of 1.0 ml of virus suspension followed at 3 and 6 weeks intervals, by two intramuscular doses of 1.0 ml each of equal volume mixture of the virus suspension and Freund's complete adjuvant. The virus suspension was prepared by resuspending, in 1/100 volume of phosphate buffered saline, pellets obtained by centrifugation of infected BEK-1 culture fluid at 100,000 x g for one hour. Serum was obtained from the animals 3 weeks after the last dose. The neutralization test was carried out by the method described elsewhere (1) . The serum neutralized the virus, the antibody titer being 1:512, while the preimmunization serum was negative.\n\nInfection of BEK-1 cells with the bovine coronavirus was also proved by immunofluoreseent staining. Coverslip cultures of BEK-1 cells inoculated with the virus were examined after 2 or 3 days of incubation at 34 \u00b0 C. The cultures were fixed with acetone at ..... 20 \u00b0 C for 10 minutes, and stained with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody for the bovine coronavirus which was kindly donated by Dr. C. A. Mebus. Many immunofluorescent mono-and multi-nucleated cells were observed; the cytoplasm contained granular fluorescence, in some cells most of the cytoplasm fluoresced ( Fig. 1 c) . As MEBUS et al. (3) we prepared fractions from infectious culture fIuid by density-gradient ultracentrifugation, and examined them by phosphotungstic negative staining in an electron microscope. R'umerous particles, about 130 nm across, with morphologic features of coronavirus were observed (Fig. ld) .\n\nThese results prove BEK-1 cells to be a good medium for propagation and assay of bovine coronavirus, rendering consistent work with the virus feasible.
