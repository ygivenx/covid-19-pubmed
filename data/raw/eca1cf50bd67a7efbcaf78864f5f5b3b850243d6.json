{"title": "Clinical Data on Hospital Environmental Hygiene Monitoring and Medical Staff Protection during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 2 Outbreak", "body": "The outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan in December 2019 has led to a serious public 69 health event [1] [2] [3] . Meanwhile, the outbreak of this novel virus has placed 70 unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene. The occurrence of 71 medical staff-associated infections is closely related to long-lived pathogens in the 72 hospital environment [4, 5] . Thus, it is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene 73 to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of 74 COVID-19 in hospitals. The Chinese government quickly adopted quarantine 75 measures for confirmed and suspected patients to restrain the spread of the 76 pandemic [6] . Comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during the 77 outbreak of the pandemic is conducive to the refinement of hospital infection control 78 [5, 7] . It also increases understanding of the environmental challenges corresponding to 79 the reemergence of COVID-19 or similar viruses. Therefore, it is of great significance 80 to ensure the safety of medical treatment and the quality of hospital infection control 81 through the monitoring of environmental hygiene. According to a report from the The environmental monitoring methods referenced the hospital sanitation standards 106 (GB15982-2012). All air was collected by two methods: natural sedimentation [9] and 107 .

(Tables 2 and 3 ). We found that the virus was present both on surfaces and in the air. 148 The total positive rate was 1.26% (2/158). The positive rates of the air and surface 149 samples were 3.57% (1/28) and 0.77% (1/130), respectively. 150 Table 2 : Air monitoring results for the different risk areas 151 .
