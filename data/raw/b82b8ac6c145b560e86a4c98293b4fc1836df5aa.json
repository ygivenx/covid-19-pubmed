{"title": "", "body": "The 2.2-Mb A. fulgidus sequence is probably complete by now (Hans-Peter Klenk) and annotation is under way. Only a few genes of known function have been firmly identified, but it appears to share up to half the genes of Methanococcus jannaschii although in no organizational relationship. One apparent consequence of life at high temperature is to have more and shorter open reading frames.\n\nAnother way of sampling the environment for potentially exploitable microorganisms is simply to screen for gene products with no reference to the originating genomes. Eric Mathur (Recombinant BioCatalysis Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) outlined their strategy for the discovery of industrial enzymes from uncultivatable organisms; they use a combination of phylogenetic trees as 'road maps' and recombinant protein screening from 'environmental libraries' obtained from DNA extracted directly from samples. His company is sampling the extremes, from insect guts to whale carcasses (which contain microorganisms with interesting esterases), as well as the, by now obligatory, survey of hydrothermal vent flora; the only bottleneck to their environmentwide surveying is the limitations of their robotic screening capacity. They are looking for enzymes with specific properties, such as thermal tolerance, long shelf life and resistance to solvents, and so far have recovered 300 industrially relevant enzymes.\n\nThere is still a sense of gaining immense power from genomics but having little to fire it at, as knowledge of an entire genome will not automatically answer a lot of questions about an organism's biology. Of course, it will tell us general features (Robert Fleischmann) about small genome organization, pinpoint many of the open reading frames and open the door to the discovery of genes for virulence, drug and vaccine targets, diagnostic tests and industrially important enzymes, among many other properties. What remains a limitation is a lack of agreement about gene nomenclature and the huge potential for confu-sion and misattribution of function (Craig Venter). But the main thing that knowledge of the genome does reveal is how little we do actually know and the potentially astonishing complexity and plasticity of even the smallest genomes. It also demonstrates the quite extraordinary ingenuity and collaborative powers of the disparate group of technologists who work on genome sequencing.\n\nThe next meeting, Small Genomes II, will also be held at Hilton Head Island from 31 January to 4 February 1998. See genome@ t, igr. org for details. Such a paradigm would presumably also be valid for the known human virus-induced demyelinating diseases such as postmeasles encephalomyelitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (papovavirus) or tropical spastic paraparesis (human T cell leukaemia virus type 1).\n\nThe etiology of the multifactorial disease MS is still unknown, but MS remains a prime candidate for a virus-induced demyelinating disease-', and an adequate animal model would certainly be a great benefit to MS research. A series of inbred murine (or rodent) models for MS exist: an antigen-based experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and several virus-mediated modem including coronavirus, lactic dehydrogenase/N-tropic C-type virus ~ and Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus 4. All these models suffer from two major drawbacks: they do not represent the highly variable manifestations of MS (from subclinical course over relapsing and remitting forms to slow or fast chronic progressing disease) and they are all rodent-based. The basic structure of the immune system in rodents and humans is very similar and, therefore, it is tempting to assume that an immunoregulatory mechanism found in one is automatically present in the other. This is indeed the case in some instances, but not always: a costly lesson that was learned in MS therapy% It seems reasonable to caution against presentations like Table 1 in the review by Lane and Buchmeier. An MS exacerbation does not necessarily correspond to an MHV-induced exacerbation in mice, and the implications of a cytokine response differ in the two cases. We still do not have a paradigm for human virus-induced demyelinating diseases/MS, and mice are not men.\n\nDept of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Bartholin Building, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark"}
