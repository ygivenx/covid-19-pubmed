{"title": "Genetic Variation Analyses of nsp2 Gene of PRRSV in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of China", "body": "seven ORFs located at the 3`-terminus of the genome are postulated to encode viral structural proteins.\n\nAmong the nonstructural proteins, the multidomain protein nsp2 is the largest PRRSV replicative protein.\n\nGenetic analysis of both Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae (1) originally identified the protein to be spanning amino acids (aa) 384 to 1 363 (nsp2 aa 1 to 981); this was subsequently projected to comprise aa Each sequence of the PCR products was determined by both enzyme analysis and sequencing.\n\nThe viral RNA of all clinical samples were extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, after lysis of the specimens, the mixture was applied to a spin column as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed at 42\u2103 for 1.5 h with 5\u03bcL total RNA, and then PCR was carried out in a reaction volume of 50 \u03bcL containing 1\u03bcL of each primer (S1 and R1, 50 pmol/\u03bcL), 5 \u03bcL of 10\u00d7PCR Buffer, 4 \u03bcL 2.5 mmol/L dNTPs, 3 \u03bcL of 25 mmol/L MgCl 2 , 1\u03bcL of RNase Inhibitor (40U/\u03bcL), 0.5 \u03bcL of Taq (5U/\u03bcL), 10 \u03bcL of reverse transcription production and 24.5 \u03bcL ddH 2 O.\n\nAmplification conditions were 94\u2103 for 4 min, then 30 cycles that each consisted of denaturing at 94\u2103 1min, annealing at 57\u2103 40 s, and extension at 72\u2103 for 1 min, the sample was then heated at 72\u2103 for 10 min, and a final stage of 4\u2103 for 5 min. The amplified PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's protocol. All nucleotide sequences were obtained from clinical sample RNA by direct sequencing of PCR products.\n\nSequence data were analyzed using the method \n\nRelative to strain ch-1a, the nsp2 genes of seventeen isolates have 87 nucleotides deleted at positions 2 937 to 2 948, 2 952 to 2 978, 2 986 to 3 003 and 3 007 to 3 036, respectively; these deletions are the same as those for the SD (3) and SD2006 strains (Fig.2) .\n\nNingxia and ch-1a was 60.3%-79.9% in nucleotide sequence, and homology between Ningxia and the common SD strain was 80.3%-98.8% in nucleotide sequence. The nsp2 genes of seventeen isolates had 74.9%-100% nucleotide sequence identity with each other (Fig.3) . "}
