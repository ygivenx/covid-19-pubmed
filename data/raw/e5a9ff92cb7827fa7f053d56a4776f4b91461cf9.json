{"title": "Protection of Newborn Animals through Maternal Immunization", "body": "The period immediately after birth is critical for the health and development of animals. The high susceptibility to infectious disease during this period is related to a variety of factors including immaturity of the immune system and susceptibility to tolerogenic signals (Barrios et al., 1996) . In particular, suboptimal interactions between antigen-presenting cells and Tcells, and the inability of these cells to secrete some cytokines, may result in responses that are qualitatively di\u00a1erent from those in adults, with decreased cytotoxic e\u00a1ector cell function and B-cell help (Upham et al., 2002) . An alternative strategy to provide early life protection against infectious disease is maternal vaccination. In humans, the medical, societal and legal risks of immunizing pregnant women pose important barriers to this process (Brent, 2003) . By contrast, active maternal vaccination of various animal species has been practiced for a long time and provides a good level of safety and protection against some pathogens.\n\nThe placentae of all eutherian (placental) mammals share common structural and functional features, but there are also striking di\u00a1erences between species in the gross and microscopical structure of the placenta. Two characteristics form the basis for classi\u00a2cation of placental types: the shape and area of contact between fetal and maternal tissue, and the number of layers of tissue between the maternal and fetal vascular systems. These di\u00a1erences in the structure of the placental interface determine the nature of molecular transport across the placenta. In primates and rodents, there is substantial transfer of immunoglobulin (Ig) G from the maternal to the fetal circulation prior to birth. By contrast, there is no transplacental transfer of immunoglobulin in animals like cattle, sheep, horses and pigs. In these species, the neonate is essentially devoid of circulating antibodies until it absorbs them from colostrum. Antibodies contained in the colostrum reach the neonatal vascular circulation through the intestine which is permeable to immunoglobulin for a few hours following birth. In dogs, in addition to postnatal transfer of maternal IgG through colostrum, some passive immunity is conferred to the fetus during the last third of pregnancy (Sto\u00a1el et al., 2000) . Whatever the placental structure and transport mechanisms involved, successful maternal vaccination programmes are employed in various domestic animal species. Some examples of maternal vaccines used in cattle, dogs and pigs will be discussed in this overview.\n\nDiarrhoea is common in newborn calves. The acute disease is characterized by progressive dehydration and death, sometimes in as little as 12 h. In the subacute form, diarrhoea may persist for several days and result in malnutrition and emaciation. Several enteropathogens are associated with neonatal diarrhoea, but the most prevalent in most areas are Escherichia coli, rotavirus, coronavirus and Cryptosporidium parvum. In North America and Europe, various maternal vaccines against calf diarrhoea have been developed. Both mod-i\u00a2ed-live and inactivated vaccines have been shown to enhance antibody titres in the colostrum and milk of vaccinated cows. In most cases, two primary injections are given several weeks before calving, followed by an annual booster injection just before subsequent calvings. The safety and e\u2044cacy for the pregnant cow and new born calves is well established in the \u00a2eld. Studies have been conducted to determine the amount of transferred IgG required to provide protection against newborn calf infections (Tyler et al., 1999) . In order to be fully protective, these maternal antibodies must cross the permeable intestinal barrier during the \u00a2rst 24 h of neonatal life (Moore et al., 2005) . E\u2044cient uptake of colostrum will depend on several factors including: the genetic background of the cow, alimentation, sanitary status and calving conditions. A more controlled method of ensuring good passive transfer is to feed calves a concentrate of speci\u00a2c antibodies, such as those in the commercial product Locatim s (Biokema Anstalt, Furstentum, Liechtenstein) which confers good protection against neonatal enteritis.\n\nCanine herpesvirus-1 (CHV-1) is enzootic in dog populations all over the word. Infection is associated with an acute and usually fatal disease in puppies during the \u00a2rst weeks of life.The pups become infected oronasally during whelping or in their \u00a2rst day of life from the bitch or their littermates. In adult dogs, the virus causes only a mild infection of the upper respiratory or genital tracts, but infection of the pregnant bitch may induce stillbirth, abor-tion or neonatal mortality. This virus is also strongly suspected to cause infertility. As a result of its di\u00a1erent pathogenic roles, CHV-1 may cause severe reproductive problems and high economic losses in breeding units. Because CHV may infect puppies very early in life, vaccination of the bitch represents the only option for actively preventing the disease. An inactivated CHV-1 vaccine is available (Poulet et al., 2001) and in both laboratory and \u00a2eld studies this vaccine has been shown to be safe for the pregnant bitch with no adverse e\u00a1ects on reproductive performance. In all cases, vaccination resulted in uniform seroconversion and high neutralizing antibody titres in the bitches. No cases of CHV disease were recorded in the puppies produced by vaccinated bitches. Moreover, the results of \u00a2eld trials provided strong evidence of the e\u2044cacy of the vaccine against other e\u00a1ects, such as infertility, induced by the virus.\n\nThe porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is now accepted as the major infectious agent involved in post-weaning multisystemic syndrome (PWMS). PWMS a\u00a1ects pigs during the \u00a2rst weeks of life. Clinical signs include progressive weight loss, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, anaemia, diarrhoea andjaundice. PWMS is now endemic in many swine-producing countries, causing an economic impact on the swine industry worldwide. The e\u00a1ects of PCV2 on the pig immune system are not fully understood but several studies have suggested that PCV2 might cause immunosuppression (Shibahara et al., 2000; Segales et al., 2001; Vincent et al., 2007) . Moreover, it has been reported that experimentally induced immune stimulation (e.g. by vaccination) early in life can induce the disease (Grasland et al., 2005) . Because of these features, maternal vaccination is regarded as the most favourable option to provide protection from PWMS. Piglets born from sows with high antibody titres to PCV2 were well-protected from a severe PCV2 challenge. By contrast, piglets of the same age but born from sows with low PCV2 antibody titres had higher viral load in lymph nodes, more serious clinical signs and lesions, and some of them developed PWMS. A killed PCV2 vaccine has been developed recently. Experiments conducted in a speci\u00a2c pathogen-free model evaluated the e\u00a1ect of maternal protection against a virulent PCV2 challenge. Piglets born to vaccinated gilts expressed signi\u00a2cantly fewer clinical signs and lesions, and had signi\u00a2cantly lower viral load in serum, faeces and lymph nodes, compared with piglets born to non-vaccinated gilts. Field studies reported a signi\u00a2cant decrease of PWMS and global mortality in both neonatal and \u00a2nishing pigs, suggesting that passive immunity could confer long-term protection. It is hypothesized that mild PCV2 exposure, in the face of maternally derived immunity, enables piglets to build e\u2044cient active immunity speci\u00a2c to the virus.\n\nMany other examples of maternal vaccination of animals exist, for example the vaccination of sows has been widely used in the \u00a2eld to protect piglets and pigs from neonatal colibacillosis, necrotizing diarrhoea, erysipelas, atrophic rhinitis, swine in\u00a3uenza and Aujesky's disease. In all cases these vaccinations have proven to be safe and e\u2044cient.\n\nThe protective e\u00a1ect of passive vaccination has always been related to the presence of antigen-speci\u00a2c antibodies in the vaccinated mother and colostrum. However, other mechanisms whereby maternal immunity confers protection may exist. Numerous other constituents of colostrum, in addition to antibodies, are thought to potentially contribute to passive immunity. These include innate defence factors such as lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase, complex oligosaccharides, mucins, cytokines, chemokines and leucocytes (Kelleher and Lonnerdal, 2001) . It has been established that colostrum-derived lymphocytes can migrate from the gut into the circulation and lymphoid organs of neonates (Tuboly and Bernath, 2002) . Transferred lymphocytes could represent a source of cytokines and chemokines that exert regulatory e\u00a1ects on neonatal antigen-presenting cells andTcells, or be a source of speci\u00a2c armed cells able to \u00a2ght early infection. Although maternally derived antibodies are generally considered to impair neonatal responsiveness to active vaccination, at least at the B-cell level, their potential positive e\u00a1ects on the generation of speci\u00a2c T-cell responses requires further detailed investigation (Rowe et al., 2004) .\n\nThe rational design of the most appropriate maternal vaccination programmes and strategies is linked to a better understanding of the di\u00a1erent mechanisms by which maternal immunity confers protection to the newborn. Veterinary models could help to address these fundamental questions for the bene\u00a2t of human vaccination."}
