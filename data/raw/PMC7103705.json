{"title": "Postexposure management of healthcare personnel to infectious diseases", "body": "Healthcare personnel (HCP) are at risk of exposure to various pathogens through their daily tasks. They may serve as a reservoir for ongoing nosocomial transmission, particularly highly contagious infections such as varicella and measles [1]. Nosocomial transmission can result in infection of susceptible patients, outbreaks, work and patient care disruption, and increased cost [2,3]. An occupational exposure is defined as an exposure of HCP to a material containing an infectious agent in a healthcare setting [1]. The exposure can occur in inpatient settings (e.g. patient rooms and laboratories), in outpatient settings (e.g. medical offices and dialysis units), and in nontraditional facilities (e.g. emergency medical and skilled nursing facilities) [1]. HCP include all paid and unpaid persons working in healthcare settings who can potentially be exposed to patients and/or to infectious materials, including body substances (e.g. blood, tissue, and specific body fluids), contaminated medical supplies and equipment, contaminated environmental surfaces, or contaminated air [1]. The infectious organism can be transmitted to HCP from a patient, another HCP, hospital visitor, or the environment by several routes (Table 1) [1].\n\nThere are several strategies to prevent infections among HCP. These include vaccination of HCP who are at risk of infection and are close to or in frequent contact with high-risk patients; education and implementation of infection prevention and control measures (Table 1); and timely delivery of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) to susceptible HCP in the event of exposure [4,5]. PEP involves administration of anti-infective agents, vaccines, or immunoglobulin as soon as possible to HCP potentially exposed to a pathogen in order to reduce the risk of infection [1,4]. Management of HCP exposure to infectious agents is paramount not only to prevent or attenuate the infection in the HCP but also to prevent secondary transmission to their contacts [1].\n\nHCP who have had unprotected exposure to an infectious source should notify their supervisor and seek prompt medical evaluation. Infection control and occupational health departments should be notified for postexposure management of HCP, identification of all contacts of the index case, application of immediate infection control measures for the index case and exposed HCP, if indicated, and for deciding on whether exposed HCP can continue to provide patient care [1,4]. The HCP should be evaluated by an experienced clinician in the occupational health or emergency department as per institution policy. Postexposure management includes assessing the risk of transmission through a thorough history and laboratory testing, if necessary, with follow up, if indicated, timely administration of appropriate PEP, if available, and general and psychological counseling of exposed HCP [1,4]. The clinician can determine the need for PEP after exposure to an infectious agent based on the followings: infectivity of the source patient or material at the time of exposure, extent and type of exposure, susceptibility of the HCP to the infectious disease of concern, and whether the exposed HCP is at a greater risk of complications than the general population [1,4]. Vaccines should be given to the exposed HCP even if they present beyond the time indicated for PEP administration. All nonimmune HCP should be vaccinated against hepatitis B virus (HBV), seasonal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, and varicella [4,5]. The HCP should be counseled on risk of infection acquisition and transmission to others, particularly if they decline PEP, benefits of treatment, importance of adherence to the drug regimen, possible adverse effects of the PEP regimen, and follow-up plan [1,4].\n\nThe exposed HCP should be counseled to immediately stop working or not to report to work, notify infection control and occupational health, and seek prompt medical attention if they develop fever or symptoms and signs of the infection of concern. They should comply with work restriction or exclusion until they are no longer deemed infectious to others by the occupational health department [1,4].\n\nHealthcare institutions should have protocols available to HCP for the management of occupational exposures to infectious diseases. Federal law requires covered employers to ensure that all medical evaluations and procedures, vaccines, and PEP are made available to the employee within a reasonable timeframe, at a reasonable location, and at no cost to the employee [1,4,6]. The employer is responsible for establishing and implementing policies to protect the confidentiality of both the exposed employee and the source [6].\n\nIn the following section, we will review postexposure management of common and serious infectious agents encountered in the healthcare setting, categorized by route of transmission. We will discuss initial assessment and testing, PEP regimen and its adverse effects, follow-up testing, and work restriction. We will also briefly discuss primary prevention, infection prevention and control precautions and vaccination for each infection.\n\nFollowing exposure to blood-borne pathogens, the exposed area should be immediately washed with soap and water and cleansed with an antiseptic (e.g. chlorhexidine gluconate). The exposed mucous membranes should be flushed with copious amounts of water and the eyes irrigated with saline or water [1].\n\nThe risk factors and baseline status for HIV, HBV, HCV, and other blood-borne pathogens should be assessed in both the source and the exposed HCP. It is not necessary to test the source patient if the status of HIV, HBV, or HCV is known to be positive [9-11]. If the status for these infections is unknown through history and medical records, testing to determine the disease status of both source and exposed HCP should be performed promptly. The recommended tests are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibodies, and HIV antibodies. It is not recommended to test needles or sharp instruments implicated in the exposure [9-11].\n\nPEP for HIV and HBV, if nonimmune, should be given to HCP as early as possible while waiting for further information or test results if the exposure is associated with risk of transmission [9-11]. However, hepatitis B vaccine should be given to nonimmune exposed HCP who are at future exposure risk even if presenting >7 days after exposure [9,11].\n\nThe exposed HCP should be counseled about modifying sexual practices (for HIV), avoiding breastfeeding and pregnancy (HIV), and refraining from donating blood, plasma, organs, tissue, or semen until these infections have been ruled out [9-11].\n\nThe average risk of HIV transmission after percutaneous and mucocutaneous exposure to HIV-infected blood in healthcare settings is approximately three and one per 1000 exposures, respectively [12]. The risk of transmission of HIV after percutaneous exposure to HIV-infected blood is increased with deep injury, visible blood on the device, procedures involving a needle in an artery or vein, and high HIV viral load. Low level of HIV viral load in the blood and the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are associated with a reduction of the risk of HIV transmission [13].\n\nSelection of a three-drug regimen for HIV PEP should be guided by proven efficacy, tolerability and side effect and toxicity profiles, ease of administration, and known or suspected resistance of the source virus to ART [9,11]. The preferred HIV PEP regimen is tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir, based on their proven efficacy in treatment of HIV infection and tolerability (Table 2) [9,11,14,15].\n\nHIV PEP should be continued until the result of HIV testing is available. If the source patient is known or confirmed to be HIV-infected, PEP should be continued for 28 days. If HIV antibody testing is negative in the source patient, PEP should be discontinued and no follow-up HIV testing for the exposed HCP is required. However, if the source patient is at a risk of HIV exposure in the previous 6 weeks and acute retroviral syndrome is clinically suspected, plasma HIV RNA testing is recommended. PEP should be continued until results of the plasma HIV RNA assay are available [9,11].\n\nRapid HIV testing is the recommended test to be utilized in decision-making regarding PEP, if the HIV status of the source is unknown. A fourth-generation HIV antigen/antibody combination test is the preferred serologic screening test, if the rapid HIV test is positive, and as a follow-up test for the exposed HCP. All positive HIV antibody tests should be confirmed by supplemental tests such as the HIV1/HIV2 antibody differentiation immunoassay [9,11,16].\n\nExposed HCP should be followed in an outpatient clinic 3 days after initial assessment, every 1\u20132 weeks until the end of PEP treatment and for blood testing (Table 2). If the exposed HCP develop an acute illness consistent with primary HIV infection such as febrile or mononucleosis-like illness, testing for HIV with a fourth-generation enzyme immunoassay and HIV RNA assay is recommended [9,11]. If HIV antibody testing is positive at baseline or at any time during follow up, HCP should be referred to a clinician experienced with HIV care for further management and treatment, and the incident should be reported to the local health department if occupationally acquired [9,11].\n\nThe risk of HBV transmission after percutaneous exposure to blood from an HBV-infected patient is approximately 23%\u201362% [17].The need and type of PEP for HBV is based on type of exposure, HBsAg status of the source patient, disease status of the exposed HCP, and vaccination status and vaccine-response status of the exposed HCP (Table 2) [4,10]. HBV vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin are 70%\u201390% effective in preventing HBV infection if given within 12\u201324 hours of exposure [18,19].\n\nThe risk of transmission of HCV following percutaneous exposures to blood from HCV-infected source patients is estimated to be 1.8% per exposure [8,11]. Since there is no effective PEP regimen to prevent HCV transmission, the goal is early identification of infection and, if present, referral for follow up, and evaluation of treatment options with an experienced clinician (Table 2) [11,20].\n\nIf the serum alanine aminotransferase level is elevated at follow up, HCP should be tested for HCV RNA to assess for acute HCV infection; if the HCP become acutely infected with hepatitis C, immediate referral to a specialist experienced in the treatment of hepatitis C is strongly recommended [11,20].\n\nPrimary prevention of occupational infection with blood-borne pathogens can be achieved by preventing exposures to blood and body fluids through infection control precautions, use of safety devices, safer work practices and engineering controls, improved surgical techniques, education of HCP on prevention of needlestick injury, and postexposure care and vaccination against HBV [6,10].\n\nHCP are at higher than average risk of acquiring tuberculosis (TB), particularly in TB-prevalent areas. The estimated latent TB infection (LTBI) rates among HCP in countries with low, intermediate, and high TB incidence are 3.8%, 6.9%, and 8.4%, respectively [24]. Patients with unrecognized TB disease who are not promptly placed in appropriate airborne precautions are the major risk factor for transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in healthcare settings [21]. The risk of transmission is higher following contact with patients with cavitary pulmonary or laryngeal TB, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear positive sputum, cough, and those who are not on effective anti-TB treatment or have just initiated treatment [21].\n\nWhen a new case of infectious TB is identified in the healthcare setting, all contacts prior to implementing infection control measures should be identified and evaluated for TB disease and LTBI [21]. The highest priority for contact evaluation should be given to HCP with medical risk factors for TB disease (e.g. HIV infection or immunocompromised) and those present during aerosol-producing procedures (e.g. bronchoscopies, sputum induction, or autopsies) (Table 3) [21].\n\nAny HCP exposed to a potentially infectious TB source should be evaluated promptly with a symptom screen for TB and a tuberculin skin test (TST) or IFN-\u03b3 release assay (IGRA). TST or IGRA should not be performed in exposed HCP who have had a previous positive test result or a history of treatment for LTBI or TB disease [21]. The TST or IGRA and symptom screen should be repeated 8\u201312 weeks later, if the initial TST or IGRA result is negative and HCP is asymptomatic. Repeating TST is not contraindicated, unless the test was associated with severe ulceration or anaphylactic shock; in such cases, IGRA is the recommended test. IGRA is also preferred in previously Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccinated HCP [21,25-27].\n\nThe choice of the cut point for a positive TST result after exposure to an active TB index case will depend on the baseline TST result if known and whether the exposed HCP has an immunocompromising condition. Prior BCG vaccination status should not be used in the interpretation of TST in the setting of contact investigations [25-27]. The result of the TST should be read by a designated and trained clinician 48\u201372 hours after the TST is placed and should be documented in millimeters, not simply as negative or positive. A positive TST in a contact of a known infectious TB patient is defined as \u22655 mm in HCP with a previous TST result of 0 mm or an increase of \u226510 mm in HCP with a previous TST result between 0 mm and 10 mm. In immunocompromised HCP, a TST \u22655 mm on baseline or follow-up testing is considered positive [21,25-27].\n\nAll exposed HCP with positive TST or IGRA should be evaluated by screening for symptoms and signs of TB disease and chest radiography to rule out TB disease. If TB disease is ruled out, treatment for LTBI should be considered [21]. Treatment of LTBI significantly reduces the risk of progression from infection with M. tuberculosis to TB disease by 60%\u201390% (Table 3) [28-31].\n\nExposed immunocompromised HCP (e.g. HIV infection, organ transplantation) should be evaluated by screening for symptoms and signs, TST or IGRA, and chest-X-ray; if all the tests are normal, they should be started on treatment for LTBI due to the high risk of developing active disease. If the repeat TST or IGRA at 8\u201312 weeks is negative, treatment for LTBI can be discontinued. Clinicians may choose to complete the treatment course for LTBI in that situation since TST and IGRA may not be reliable in severely immunocompromised conditions [21].\n\nIf exposed HCP develop symptoms or signs of TB (e.g. fever, weight loss, hemoptysis) during follow up, chest X-ray and AFB smear and culture should be performed and the HCP should be treated for TB disease if indicated [21].\n\nPrevention of TB among HCP can be accomplished through education regarding TB symptoms, transmission, and prevention, and by providing training in the proper donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as respirators and N95 masks. In addition, annual screening for symptoms or signs of TB disease, baseline (for all HCPs in low- and medium-risk settings) and annual (for medium-risk settings) TB screening for HCP with negative TST or IGRA, and treatment of HCP who have LTBI is recommended [21,25-27].\n\nVaricella, caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), is highly contagious, with secondary attack rates up to 90%. It is transmitted via direct contact with vesicles and inhalation of aerosols from vesicular fluid or respiratory tract secretions of a patient with varicella or disseminated herpes zoster (HZ) [22]. HZ is much less contagious than varicella [22,32]. Varicella can still occur in vaccinated exposed persons, but the infection is usually milder and less infectious than in the unvaccinated ones [22]. Nosocomial transmission, which is uncommon, is usually due to delay in the diagnosis, incorrect diagnosis, or late implementation of infection control precautions [4,22,32].\n\nPEP regimens for varicella and HZ include varicella vaccine, varicella zoster immune globulin (VariZIG), and oral antiviral agents (Table 3) [22,32,33].\n\nVaricella vaccine, not zoster vaccine, is effective in prevention of varicella infection (risk reduction of 60%\u201390%) and development of severe disease due to vaccine-induced VZV-specific T-cell proliferation if given within 3\u20135 days of exposure to an index case of varicella or zoster [34]. The disease is usually mild in vaccinated persons who did not seroconvert or who lost detectable antibody and developed varicella after exposure to VZV [4,35]. Any HCP who develops vaccine-related rash should avoid contact with susceptible patients until resolution of the rash [4,22].\n\nVariZIG is effective in prevention and disease modification of varicella in exposed susceptible persons if given ideally within 96 hours, and up to 10 days, of exposure [36,37].\n\nIt should be noted that none of the PEP regimens are completely effective in preventing the disease after exposure and breakthrough infections have been reported [22].\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease with a secondary attack rate of 90%. The majority of measles cases occur in either unvaccinated HCP or HCP with unknown vaccination status. It still can occur in immunized persons after exposure to an index case [4,38,39].\n\nMeasles vaccine may prevent and attenuate the severity of the disease if given within 3 days of exposure in limited contact settings such as schools, childcare, and medical offices [40,41]. Immunoglobulin products are effective in preventing and modifying the infection, in addition to reducing the mortality by 75%, in persons who are nonimmune if administered within 7 days of exposure [42].\n\nMeasles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is highly effective in primary prevention of measles, with a two-dose vaccine effectiveness of 99% [4,39,43].\n\nEbola is an infection caused by Ebolavirus, part of the family Filoviridae. Although the natural reservoir host is unknown, the virus can be transmitted from person-to-person and can result in outbreaks. There are 20,129 cases of Ebola with 7879 deaths in the current outbreak of Ebola in West Africa [44].\n\nThe virus is transmitted through direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with blood, body fluids, tissues, or skin of symptomatic infected patients or persons who have died of the disease. The risk of transmission is particularly high during the later stages of infection, when viral loads are high. Transmission is not possible during the incubation period when the patient is asymptomatic [45-47]. HCP caring for Ebola patients are in the highest risk of infection if not wearing appropriate PPE.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no available PEP for Ebola. Exposed HCP should stop working immediately and report to occupational health and their supervisors. They should monitor their temperature twice daily for 21 days after the last exposure and report any temperature >101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C) or symptoms/signs of Ebola infection. Clinicians should follow the updated information available at Centers for disease control and prevention, World Health Organization, and other health organization websites [45-47].\n\nPostexposure management of avian influenza and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus are summarized in Table 3 [48-52].\n\nHealthcare-associated severe group A streptococcal (GAS) infection occurs at rate of 5%\u201312%. Surgical, obstetrics and gynecology, and burn units are the wards most commonly involved in hospital outbreaks of GAS infections [53-55]. The issue of treating the contacts of invasive GAS (iGAS) index cases is debated because it is unknown if antibiotic therapy will decrease risk of acquiring GAS infection. It is generally agreed that PEP should not be routinely given to all contacts of iGAS cases. The decision to use PEP for contacts will be based on clinician\u2019s assessment of the risk associated with each HCP and guidance from local institutions (Table 4) [53-55].\n\nAll HCP in contact with an index case of iGAS infection should be screened for GAS if they develop sore throat, skin infection, skin lesions, vaginitis, or pruritus within 7 days of contact with the index case [55]. In outbreaks of GAS infection, the infection control department may decide to screen asymptomatic HCP for GAS. Screening for GAS should be performed from throat and skin lesions and, if negative, from nose, anus, and vagina. Screened HCP found to be positive for GAS should receive antibiotic eradication therapy (Table 4). Screening for GAS should be repeated 7\u201310 days after completion of therapy and, if still positive for GAS, HCP should be retreated and their household contacts should be screened [53-55].\n\nNosocomial transmission of N. meningitidis is rare due to adherence to infection control practices. HCP can acquire the organism through contact with respiratory secretions of infected patients or in laboratory settings [4,56]. Antibiotic therapy used as PEP is effective in preventing infection after exposure and eradicating nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis (Table 4) [57].\n\nQuadrivalent (A, C, W-135, Y) meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) and conjugate meningococcal vaccines (MenACWY-D, MenACWY-CRM) protect against 75% of disease among adults by induction of detectable bactericidal antibodies, which decline 3\u20135 years post-vaccination [4,56]. Meningococcal vaccines can be used in the routine vaccination schedule of high-risk HCP (Table 4) and during institutional outbreaks (defined as the occurrence of \u22652\u20133 confirmed or probable primary cases of meningococcal disease caused by the same serogroup in \u22643 months). During an outbreak, HCP should be vaccinated with a meningococcal vaccine that contains the responsible serogroup [4,56]. The recently approved meningococcal vaccine for serogroup B is indicated for individuals 10\u201325 years of age and its role for HCP vaccination is not clear [58].\n\nPertussis is a highly contagious disease with a secondary attack rate of 80%, which may turn into an outbreak [4,59]. Pertussis is most communicable in the first 2 weeks of illness during the catarrhal and early paroxysmal stages. Transmission is negligible after about 3 weeks of untreated infection or 5 days after initiation of effective antibiotic therapy [59].\n\nThe benefits of PEP for exposed HCP to pertussis are not well supported with strong evidence (Table 4) [4,60-62]. However, it is generally recommended that unvaccinated HCP with significant exposure to an infectious patient should be given PEP. On the other hand, vaccinated HCP can be given the option of either taking PEP or monitoring for symptoms for 21 days after last contact with infectious index patient. Providing PEP is preferred for vaccinated HCP at high risk of severe disease or HCP working with patients at high risk of severe disease, such as neonates or pregnant women [60,63].\n\nEffectiveness of pertussis-containing vaccines (e.g. tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis, diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis) for primary prevention of pertussis ranges from 66% to 78% but the duration of immunity is unknown [4,5,59,63-65].\n\nInfluenza is a large burden in healthcare settings since it is a common infection and can cause outbreaks of severe respiratory illness among hospitalized patients and long-term-care residents [4,66]. Viral shedding typically occurs from 1 day before symptom onset until 5\u201310 days after onset, although young children and immunocompromised patients may shed virus for longer durations [67]. Antiviral agents have been shown to be effective as PEP after unprotected exposure to influenza and particularly in outbreak situations. However, because of concern of antiviral resistance, it is usually preferred to watch the exposed HCP and to initiate treatment early if symptoms develop [67-69]. If it is decided to give PEP, it should be for HCP contacts who are at high risk of influenza complications or in contact with persons at high risk of influenza complications (Table 4) [67].\n\nThe effectiveness of influenza vaccine to prevent influenza varies and depends on the age and health status of the person and the match between the circulating strains and the strains included in the vaccine for that season [68,70]. The influenza vaccine is \u223c90% serologically effective in HCP but the vaccine impact on clinical illness among HCP and their contacts is not well established [71-74].\n\nPostexposure management of other infections transmitted by the droplet route are summarized in Table 4 [39,75-80].\n\nScabies, which is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, has resulted in many outbreaks in different healthcare settings [81]. Scabies is transmitted primarily by skin-to-skin contact with an infested person. Crusted scabies, in which millions of mites infest a single host, is more contagious than scabies and can be transmitted by casual contact, such as holding hands, or through fomites, such as clothing and linens [82]. PEP should not be given for exposed HCP who lack signs of infestation. In case of a continuing outbreak, PEP for scabies can be given to asymptomatic HCP contacts in consultation with the infection control and occupational health departments (Table 5) [1,83,84].\n\nPostexposure management of other infections transmitted by the contact route is summarized in Table 5 [1,85-89].\n\nPostexposure management is the responsibility of the HCP, occupational health provider, and employer, and is made possible through awareness of the risks and potential interventions both before and after exposure. There are several challenges in the postexposure management of HCP to infectious sources. These include evaluation of an unknown source patient or a source patient who refused testing, difficulties in determining levels of risk of transmission for exposure incidents, availability of a rapid diagnostic test for source patient testing, sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests, disclosure of related information of the source individual, unavailability of PEP regimens, development of drug-resistant pathogens (e.g. TB), and adherence of exposed HCP to clinic visits and to the prescribed PEP regimen. There is an urgent need for PEP for serious infections such as HCV and Ebola. Having established protocols for postexposure management, a multidisciplinary team approach, and accessible expert consultation may solve some of these challenges."}
