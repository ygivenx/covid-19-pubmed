{"title": "OAS proteins and cGAS: unifying concepts in sensing and responding to cytosolic nucleic acids", "body": "To recognize potentially harmful signals, the innate immune system has evolved a conserved set of receptors \u2014 known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) \u2014 that can detect microbial pathogens through the presence of microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Certain PRRs sense MAMPs that are truly (structurally) non-self, whereas others sense the non-self origin of molecules by their presence in compartments that are normally devoid of them1. Viral infection can be sensed by the recognition of virus-derived nucleic acids through structural features that are not found in self nucleic acids. For example, unmodified, fully base-paired 5\u2032-triphosphorylated RNAs activate the cytosolic RNA helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), whereas long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are detected by melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). By contrast, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can sense RNA and DNA molecules of both exogenous and endogenous origin, although they show preferences for microbial nucleic acids. In this regard, the mislocalization of nucleic acids in the endolysosomal compartment acts as a signal of non-self origin (as reviewed in Ref. 2).\n\nIn this Progress article, we describe the recent studies that have revealed the existence of a new family of cytosolic nucleic acid-sensing proteins that includes the well-known dsRNA-sensing 2\u2032\u20135\u2032-oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) proteins and the DNA sensor cyclic GMP\u2013AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS). cGAS functions in a classical PRR pathway that monitors the cytosol for the presence of DNA, and that triggers type I interferon (IFN) production and antiviral gene expression through activation of stimulator of IFN genes (STING) (Fig. 1). By contrast, OAS proteins function as nucleic acid sensors in a more immediate antiviral restriction pathway by impeding translation3. Despite these different functionalities, a remarkable finding from recent studies is that OAS1 and cGAS share closely related structural and enzymatic features \u2014 they possess the same structural fold, they are activated by a similar double-stranded nucleic acid-induced structural switch and they form a nucleotide second messenger that contains an unusual 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 phosphodiester linkage (Fig. 1).\n\nThe human OAS family. The human OAS family consists of four IFN-regulated genes \u2014 namely, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 and OASL (which encodes OAS-like protein)4,5. The OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3 proteins are all active enzymes that can generate 2\u2032\u20135\u2032-linked oligoadenylates, whereas OASL is devoid of 2\u2032\u20135\u2032-linked oligoadenylate synthase activity. Nevertheless, OASL (and Oasl2 in mice) has potent antiviral activity6, which can be ascribed to its positive regulatory role in RIG-I signalling7. By contrast, mouse Oasl1 has been shown to negatively regulate antiviral immunity by inhibiting the translation of IFN-regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)8.\n\n2\u2032\u20135\u2032-linked oligoadenylates are second messengers that activate RNase L. The OAS proteins sense viral dsRNA and synthesize 2\u2032\u20135\u2032-linked oligoadenylates, which are second messengers that activate RNase L (Fig. 1). All three human OAS isoforms can be activated by dsRNA in vitro, although the precise in vivo activators are unknown. The 2\u2032\u20135\u2032-linked oligoadenylates bind to RNase L, which dimerizes and degrades cellular and viral RNA9,10. The structural mechanisms of RNase L activation by 2\u2032\u20135\u2032-linked oligoadenylates and its dimer formation have recently been described11,12. The full activation of the OAS system in virally infected cells leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis and induces apoptosis, and therefore interferes with the production of new viruses13.\n\nActivation of the OAS\u2013RNase L system limits the replication of many different viruses, in particular, positive-strand viruses \u2014 such as picornaviruses, flaviviruses and alphaviruses3,14,15,16 \u2014 which is in line with the notion that these viruses display large amounts of dsRNA during their life cycle (as reviewed in Ref. 15). Indirect evidence for the importance of the OAS\u2013RNase L system in restricting viral propagation is provided by the existence of virus-encoded inhibitors of this pathway. For example, the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus encodes non-structural protein 2 (NS2), which can degrade 2\u2032\u20135\u2032-linked oligoadenylates17. Similarly, several picornaviruses have mechanisms that antagonize RNase L18,19,20. Although the OAS\u2013RNase L pathway seems to inhibit a wide variety of viruses, this inhibition is rarely complete and is often redundant with other pathways in vitro. Therefore, the OAS\u2013RNase L pathway probably cooperates with other translational inhibitors that are induced during viral infection in vivo to efficiently prevent the production of viral proteins in infected cells.\n\nOAS proteins and cGAS are structurally related nucleotidyltransferases. Structural studies have shown that OAS proteins and cGAS have a highly similar fold41,61,62,63 (Fig. 2). OAS proteins belong to the class of template-independent polymerases that includes poly(A) polymerase, for example64,65. Enzymes of this family have a common two-lobed catalytic core (Fig. 2a) and they transfer a 'donor' nucleotide triphosphate to the 2\u2032-OH or 3\u2032-OH of an 'acceptor' nucleotide. In the case of OAS1, the acceptor is the 2\u2032-OH of ATP and subsequently of 2\u2032\u20135\u2032-linked oligoadenylates. In general, the products of these enzymes are linear nucleotides (Fig. 3). However, cGAS generates CDNs rather than linear nucleotides by carrying out a second nucleotidyl transfer reaction39,40,66. In the case of cGAS, the first reaction is the transfer of the donor ATP onto the 2\u2032-OH of the acceptor GTP41,42,43. The resulting pppG(2\u2032\u20135\u2032)pA is cyclized by an additional link between the \u03b1-phosphate of GTP and the 3\u2032-OH of ATP. This two-step mechanism is distinct from that of the broadly distributed bacterial diadenylate or diguanylate cyclases (which have DAC and GGDEF domains, respectively) that are dimers or oligomers, in which each active site binds one ATP or GTP molecule67,68. Here, two opposing active sites carry out two transferase reactions in parallel to form c-di-AMP or c-di-GMP. Although OAS1 and cGAS seem to be closely related in evolutionary terms, no phylogenetic connection is apparent between cGAS and bacterial diadenylate or diguanylate cyclases. Of note, Vibrio cholerae contains a cGAMP(3\u2032\u20135\u2032) synthase that has sequence homology to OAS proteins66. It will be interesting to clarify the catalytic mechanism of this bacterial enzyme and the potential evolutionary connections to cGAS and OAS proteins.\n\nNucleic acids allosterically activate OAS proteins and cGAS by a structural switch. In the absence of DNA, cGAS is monomeric in vitro and contains a partially unstructured active site that is not properly aligned for binding donor and acceptor nucleotides41,61,62,63 (Fig. 2). Although single nucleotide triphosphates or the cGAMP product can be bound to the cGAS active site in the absence of DNA41,61,69, they do not seem to induce a fully folded and nucleotidyltransferase-competent conformation.\n\ndsDNA binds to cGAS in a sequence-independent manner to a highly positively charged 'platform' on the opposite site of the enzyme with respect to the nucleotidyltransferase active site41,61 (Fig. 2b). A similar surface area of OAS1 binds to dsRNA70 (Fig. 2a), which suggests a common overall activation mechanism. The binding of B-form DNA to cGAS and of A-form RNA to human OAS1 induces a structural switch in the long 'spine' helix that spans both lobes of the nucleotidyltransferase fold in cGAS and OAS1 (Fig. 2c). This structural change modulates the conformation of active site loops for productive binding of GTP and ATP substrates, as well as active site Mg2+ ions. The active conformation is further stabilized in cGAS by dimer formation, in which two dsDNA moieties are sandwiched between two cGAS protomers69,71 (Fig. 2b).\n\nThe specificity of cGAS for DNA is, in part, provided by a 'zinc thumb' motif, which is not found in OAS1 and which is important for proper DNA binding and DNA-induced cGAS dimer formation69,71. Besides the zinc thumb, crucial cGAS dimer interactions are mediated by the binding of each dsDNA moiety to the 'platform' (site 'A') of one protomer and a secondary DNA-binding site 'B' on the other protomer. The cooperative binding of DNA to both sites A and B has been shown to be crucial for cGAS activation and stabilizes the conformationally active dimer structure69,71. Currently, there is no evidence that OAS1 forms a similar dimer structure, which suggests that dimer formation is a unique feature of cGAS and may help to generate specificity for DNA rather than RNA.\n\nAlthough cGAS can bind dsRNA in vitro, this does not lead to its activation61. This could be because only B-form nucleic acids can form appropriate contacts with the platform, the zinc thumb and the secondary binding site in the cGAS dimer. By contrast, the OAS1 platform binds A-form dsRNA70 and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) but only dsRNA triggers formation of the active conformation. Thus, it seems that OAS proteins and cGAS use double-stranded nucleic acid topology to distinguish between RNA and DNA.\n\nCatalytic mechanism of OAS1 and cGAS. After the DNA-induced structural switch, cGAS can bind ATP and GTP to the active site. Crystal structures of porcine cGAS61 with transferase-trapping active site mutations defined the catalytic step that leads to the formation of the linear intermediate pppGp(2\u2032\u20135\u2032)A. GTP and ATP bind to the acceptor and donor pockets, respectively. The ATP donor nucleotide and its triphosphate moiety are positioned in such a way that the 2\u2032-OH of GTP can attack the \u03b1-phosphate of ATP. Structural studies using wild-type cGAS protein have revealed the subsequent steps of catalysis that occur in the cyclization reaction41. It seems that, before the second catalytic step, the linear dinucleotide intermediate (pppG(2\u2032\u20135\u2032)pA) needs to rebind in the reversed order \u2014 that is, GTP now occupies the donor pocket and 2\u2032\u20135\u2032-linked AMP occupies the acceptor pocket. In this setting, the 3\u2032-OH of AMP attacks the \u03b1-phosphate of GTP, which is in keeping with the universal nucleotidyltransferase mechanism72,73. The proposed reaction mode would result in a cGAMP product with guanine in the donor site and adenine in the acceptor site, which is indeed observed in a crystal structure71.\n\nAlthough cGAS is very specific for GTP as the acceptor, biochemical experiments have shown that, to some extent, it can tolerate GTP instead of ATP as a donor41,43. Similarly, OAS enzymes selectively use nucleotides with an adenine base and a free 2\u2032-OH as the acceptor substrate, whereas any triphosphate nucleotide can be used as a donor74. It therefore seems that the triphosphate moiety in pppGp(2\u2032\u20135\u2032)A overrules the donor and acceptor specificities. Further work is necessary to decipher the timescale and nucleotide specificities of the different reaction states. On the basis of the available structures, it is possible to formulate unified activation and catalytic mechanisms for both cGAS and OAS1 (Fig. 3).\n\nAn interesting open question is why cGAS forms CDNs, whereas OAS1 forms linear oligomeric chains. One possibility is that OAS1 simply suppresses the swapped binding of a pppA(2\u2032\u20135\u2032)pA intermediate. Moreover, we need to understand why dsDNA or dsRNA needs to be \u226550 base pairs in length to trigger efficient antiviral immunity through OAS1 and cGAS in vivo27,75,76. According to the crystal structures and biochemical analyses, the binding site of DNA on cGAS or dsRNA on OAS1 is much shorter and, in vitro, cGAS is partially activated by dsDNA that is 16 base pairs long and almost fully activated by dsDNA that is 20 base pairs long71. This length-dependence in vivo cannot be explained by the structure of the cGAS dimer, which binds two shorter DNA molecules side-by-side, rather than one long DNA molecule. Thus, further work is necessary to understand the precise mode by which these two related sensors operate."}
