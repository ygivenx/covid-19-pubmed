{"title": "Long-Term Stability Monitoring of Printed Proteins on Paper-Based Membranes", "body": "Detection and sensing of viruses, pollutants, and other related proteins have received much attention with the Zika and MERS outbursts in recent years. 1\u22125 To be considered a good detection and sensing platform, stability and detection sensitivity as well as ease of use and maintenance should be guaranteed. 6, 7 There are several careful studies of paper-based sensing membranes that provide a cheap and convenient option for virus/pollutant detection. 8\u221212 To date, a large number of novel paper-based sensing technologies, including nanoparticle-based and electronic-based sensors, have been developed to increase detection sensitivity. 13\u221216 However, many of these technologies require a significant amount of detection time, function only under certain storage conditions and are quite often expensive. As alternatives to these high technology sensing platforms, colorimetric and immunosensors are still popular in clinical use. 17\u221219 These immunosensors are based on immobilized capturing antibodies, and virus particles/antigens captured on antibodies were detected by detection antibodies. 20, 21 Colorimetric/immunosensing platforms are widely used in various viruses, antigens, and pollutant detection systems; however, most of the studies of these paper-based sensors focus on detection sensitivity and not stability or storage conditions. 22 \u221224 In addition, a large number of paper-based sensing membrane systems have adopted chemically treated membranes to enhance protein/ antibody adsorption and stability, 25\u221227 but comparative studies of protein stability and detection sensitivity on different paperbased membranes are rare. To verify the stability of printed proteins on paper-based membranes and to fill the gaps in research, we conducted systematic studies of protein stability and sensitivity on three different paper-based membranes. We also conducted long-term monitoring of printed proteins/ antibodies on paper-based platforms with varying storage temperature conditions to identify an optimal storing period and temperature for printed proteins.\n\nPrinting and Detection of Anti-IgG-HRP Antibody on a Paper-Based Platform. First, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/ mL aliquots of the anti-IgG-HRP antibody were loaded on a Piezo printhead inkjet printer and printed on printing paper and nitrocellulose and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes ( Figure 1A ,B). Data suggest that IgG-HRP antibodies were successfully printed on the paper-based membrane ( Figure 1B) . The printed IgG-HRP antibodies on paper-based membranes were then incubated with the HRP substrate, and the HRP signal intensity was recorded. Chemiluminescence intensities from 100 \u03bcg/mL of the printed IgG-HRP antibody gave values of 4123 \u00b1 1214, 4325 \u00b1 385, and 4936 \u00b1 325 (arbitrary unit) for printing paper, nitrocellulose membrane, and PVDF membrane, respectively ( Figure 1C ).\n\nStability Measurement of Membrane-Printed IgG-HRP. Three different paper-based membranes printed with the IgG-HRP antibody were stored at room temperature (r.t.), 4\u00b0C\n\nor \u221220\u00b0C for 1\u2212180 days, and the HRP signal was monitored ( Figure 2A ). The data suggest that the signal intensity from IgG-HRP printed on printing paper decreased by half on days 56.3 and 57.1 (from 0.8 cm diameter dot) under 4 and \u221220\u00b0C storage conditions, respectively, while that at r.t. was 6.7 days ( Figure 2B \u2212D). The chemiluminescence intensity of IgG-HRP printed on both nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes decreased by half on day 1.3 and day 2.5, respectively. Storage temperature does not induce >10% changes in the signal for nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes. No chemiluminescence signals from the printed IgG-HRP antibody were detected after 6 months of storage for printing paper or nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes.\n\nDetection of Printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 on a Paper-Based Platform. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) recombinant proteins were printed on printing paper and nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes ( Figure 3A ,B). After the designated storage period, PSMA/TNF-\u03b1 printed paper strips were incubated with antibodies-HRP, and HRP signals were monitored. The chemiluminescence signal intensity from anti-PSMA and anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibodies conjugated with HRP increased as the concentration of printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 increased ( Figure 3C ,D). PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 printed on printing paper showed the highest signal intensity from antibody-HRP (2016 and 2786, respectively, from a 0.8 cm diameter dot, arbitrary unit), followed by PVDF (1073 and 1932, respectively) and nitrocellulose membrane (496 and 693, respectively).\n\nStability Monitoring of Paper-Based Sensors of PSMA and TNF-\u03b1. Printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 were stored at r.t., 4, or \u221220\u00b0C for 28 days, and chemiluminescence signal intensities from antibody-HRP were monitored. Signal intensity from printed PSMA was reduced by half on days 3.3, 3.1, and 2.6 for \u221220, 4\u00b0C, and r.t. storage, respectively, for printing paper ( Figure 4A ), while that of nitrocellulose was 0.9 \u00b1 0.2 ( Figure 4B ). Times to reach half intensities compared to the original signal for printed PSMA on the PVDF membrane were 4.1, 3.8, and 2.9 days for \u221220, 4\u00b0C, and r.t. storage ( Figure 4C ). Signal intensity from printed TNF-\u03b1 was similar to printed PSMA, and the time to reach half intensities of the initial signal was the longest for the PVDF membrane followed by printing paper and nitrocellulose membrane ( Figure 4D \u2212 F). No signals were detected.\n\nWe first tested whether inkjet-printed proteins on a paperbased membrane are functional. We focused on maintenance of functional ability of printed HRP and structural integrity of printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 proteins. Varying concentrations of anti-IgG HRP antibodies (1\u2212100 \u03bcg/mL) were printed on printing paper and nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes, and the HRP substrate was added to detect signals from the printed antibodies ( Figure 1A ). As low as 1 \u03bcg/mL of printed IgG-HRP antibodies can be detected on paper-based membranes ( Figure 1B,C) , which suggests that piezo inkjet printing does not induce changes or damage to the function of printed antibodies. The concentration of the anti-IgG-HRP antibody versus the chemiluminescence signal intensity from the printed IgG-HRP plot showed a linear relationship, with R-squared values of 0.952, 0.931, and 0.946 for printing paper, nitrocellulose membrane, and PVDF membrane, respectively ( Figure 1C ). These data suggest that the signal intensity from printed IgG-HRP is a good reflection of the concentration of IgG-HRP. IgG-HRP-printed printing paper and nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes were stored at three different temperature conditions: r.t. (\u223c22\u00b0C), 4, and \u221220\u00b0C, to test the effect of storage temperature on printed protein functionality and stability. Chemiluminescence signal intensities from printed IgG-HRP antibodies on printing paper and nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes showed less than 10% variation, which suggests that the binding capacity of the three paper-based membranes tested are quite similar. The HRP signal from printed IgG-HRP on printing paper decreased rapidly during the initial 5 days when stored at r.t. However, 4 and \u221220\u00b0C significantly increased printed protein stability, and the signal intensity from HRP remained >50% up to 60 days. Signals from printed HRP on printing paper can be detected up to 180 days when stored at \u221220\u00b0C. These data suggest that storing temperature is critical in maintaining printed protein functionalities. However, when the same protein was printed on the nitrocellulose membrane, the signal intensity from HRP dropped rapidly over the first 2 days, regardless of storage temperature ( Figure 2C ). Although protein molecules bind to nitrocellulose membranes through hydrophobic interactions, printed proteins on nitrocellulose membranes lose functionality in a very short amount of time. IgG-HRP antibodies printed on PVDF also showed significant signal intensity drops over the first 5 days; however, signals from HRP can be detected up to 6 months when stored at 4 and \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nWe next tested whether printed proteins on paper-based membranes can be detected by antibodies. Two recombinant proteins, PSMA and TNF-\u03b1, were printed and HRP conjugated antibodies against the two proteins were used to detect the printed proteins. Although signals from anti-PSMA-HRP and anti-TNF-\u03b1 HRP were lower compared to the directly printed IgG-HRP antibody, printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 were still detected when printed on all three paper-based membranes. Signal intensities from the detection antibody were highest on printing paper followed by PVDF and nitrocellulose membrane; however, they did not show a linear relationship with the concentration of printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 ( Figure 3C,D) . These data may suggest that the signal intensities from colorimetric/immunosensors may not exactly reflect the actual concentration of antigens. We again tested whether printed proteins can be detected by detection antibodies after storage at various storage temperatures. It took \u223c3 days for signals to be reduced to half of the initial intensity from printed proteins on printing paper ( Figure  3A,D) . Storage temperatures have a minimal effect on signal intensity in the first 3 days; however, storing at \u221220\u00b0C increases printed protein stability after 7 days of storage.\n\nAlthough the signals from printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 on PVDF membranes were lower than those from printing paper, signal intensity from printed proteins remains longer at 4\u00b0C compared to that from printing paper ( Figure 4C,F) . Storing at 4 and \u221220\u00b0C also increases printed protein stability compared to r.t. Printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 antibodies on the PVDF membrane and printing paper retains >50% activity for 4.1 and 3.5 days, respectively, when stored lower than 4\u00b0C. Two antibodies on the PVDF membrane and printing paper retains >25% activity for 14.2 and 5.8 days when stored at \u221220\u00b0C. PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 printed on the nitrocellulose membrane showed significantly reduced signal intensities from detection antibodies compared to printing paper and PVDF membranes ( Figure 4B ,E). Low-temperature storage increases the chemiluminescence signal upon storing; however, the signal only lasts up to 7 and 14 days for PSMA and TNF-\u03b1, respectively. These data suggest that although nitrocellulose membranes are quite often used for various protein detection purposes, immobilized protein stability upon storing cannot be guaranteed compared to the PVDF membrane or even simple printing paper.\n\nHowever, our studies focus more on protein stability and storage temperature and not on detection sensitivity. Paperbased sensing platforms adopting nanoparticles (plasmonic gold and quantum dot) and microelectronics have detection limits up to pictograms of proteins. 28 Although this study adopted a simple colorimetric detection method using HRP, we believe that nanoparticles and even electronic or mechanistic sensing methods can be applied in a paper-based platform. 29\u221234 Overall, our data suggest that proteins and antibodies printed on simple printing paper can be stable up to several months upon storage at low temperature. Our results can be further applied to developing a simple and cost-effective antigen/virus/pollutant test based on paper membranes.\n\nOverall, our data also show that proteins printed on simple printing paper retain functionality for a long duration of time compared to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes when stored at low temperature.\n\nMaterials.
