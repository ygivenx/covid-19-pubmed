{"title": "Crystal Structure of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\n(MERS-CoV) Papain-like Protease Bound to Ubiquitin Facilitates Targeted\nDisruption of Deubiquitinating Activity to Demonstrate Its Role in Innate Immune\nSuppression*", "body": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)6 was first isolated in June 2012 from a patient in\nSaudi Arabia who had died from progressive respiratory and renal failure (1). Since then, over 800 cases have been\nreported, with a case fatality rate surpassing 30% (2). The progression and severity of the symptoms observed in MERS\npatients resemble the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) observed in patients\ninfected with SARS-CoV, which caused a global pandemic in 2003, resulting in over\n8000 cases, with a case fatality rate of \u223c10% (3). Whereas the SARS-CoV outbreak was contained within\nmonths, MERS cases continue to occur 2 years after the emergence of MERS-CoV in the\nhuman population. Currently, dromedary camels are suspected to be one of the direct\nreservoirs for the zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV, although the exact chain of\ntransmission remains to be explored in more detail (4, 5).\n\nMERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+RNA)\nviruses that belong to the Betacoronavirus genus in the family\nCoronaviridae of the Nidovirales order (6).\nThe CoV non-structural proteins (nsps), which drive viral genome replication and\nsubgenomic RNA synthesis, are encoded within a large replicase gene that encompasses\nthe 5\u2032-proximal three-quarters of the CoV genome. The replicase gene\ncontains two open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b. Translation of ORF1a yields\npolyprotein 1a (pp1a), and \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting facilitates\ntranslation of ORF1b to yield pp1ab (7). The\npp1a and pp1ab precursors are co- and post-translationally processed into functional\nnsps by multiple ORF1a-encoded protease domains. CoVs employ either one or two\npapain-like proteases (PLpros), depending on the virus species, to\nrelease nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 and a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro)\nthat cleaves all junctions downstream of nsp4 (reviewed in Ref. 8). Comparative sequence analysis of the MERS-CoV genome\nand proteome allowed for the prediction and annotation of 16 nsps, along with the\nlocation of the probable proteolytic cleavage sites (6). The MERS-CoV PLpro domain, which resides in nsp3, has\nrecently been confirmed to recognize and cleave after the sequence\nLXGG at the nsp1\u21932 and nsp2\u21933 junctions, as\ndefined previously for other CoV PLpros, as well as an\nIXGG sequence, which constitutes the nsp3\u21934 cleavage\nsite (9, 10).\n\nThese recognition sequences within pp1a/pp1ab resemble the C-terminal LRGG motif of\nubiquitin (Ub), an 8.5-kDa protein that can be conjugated to lysine residues or the\nN terminus of target proteins as a form of post-translational modification through\nthe action of the cellular E1/2/3 ligase system (reviewed in Ref. 11). Additional Ub molecules can be linked to any of the\n7 lysine residues in Ub itself or to its N terminus to generate polyubiquitin\n(poly-Ub) chains of various linkage types (11). The best-studied linkages are the ones occurring at Lys48 of\nUb, which results in the targeting of the tagged substrate to the 26 S proteasome\nfor degradation, and at Lys63, which generates a scaffold for the\nrecruitment of cellular proteins to activate numerous signaling cascades, including\ncritical antiviral and proinflammatory pathways (11). The C terminus of Ub can be recognized by deubiquitinating enzymes\n(DUBs), which catalyze the deconjugation of Ub, thus reversing the effects of\nubiquitination (12). Interestingly, CoV\nPLpros, including those of MERS- and SARS-CoV, have been suggested to\nact as multifunctional proteases that not only cleave the viral polyproteins at\ninternal LXGG cleavage sites but also remove Ub and the antiviral\nUb-like molecule interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins,\npresumably to suppress host antiviral pathways (9, 13\u201319).\n\nActivation of antiviral and proinflammatory pathways is a critical first line of\ndefense against virus infections, including those caused by nidoviruses. Viral RNA\nmolecules are recognized by pattern recognition receptors, such as the cytoplasmic\nRIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I and MDA5, which are activated by intracellular\nviral RNA transcripts bearing 5\u2032 tri- and diphosphates and double-stranded\nRNA (dsRNA) replication intermediates, respectively (20, 21). Upon their stimulation,\nRLRs signal through the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), leading to\nthe formation of a signaling complex at the mitochondrial membrane and ultimately to\nthe activation of transcription factors IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB. These transcription\nfactors in turn regulate the expression of antiviral type 1 interferons (IFN),\nincluding IFN-\u03b2, which acts through autocrine and paracrine\nreceptor-mediated signaling pathways to induce the transcription of numerous\ninterferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that will interfere with virus replication as\nwell as proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1. Regulation\nof the antiviral and proinflammatory pathways is largely Ub-dependent, because\nmultiple factors in the innate immune cascade are ubiquitinated, including RIG-I,\nwhich is critical for downstream signaling. Cellular DUBs function to prevent\nexcessive inflammation and immune responses during infection by removal of Ub from\ninnate immune factors (reviewed in Ref. 22).\n\nThe DUB activities of MERS- and SARS-CoV PLpro have been implicated in the\nsuppression of host antiviral pathways because these proteases can suppress\nIFN-\u03b2 induction upon their ectopic expression (9, 13, 15, 16,\n19, 23). Previous work has shown that during infection, SARS-CoV indeed\nsuppresses the host's antiviral responses by preventing the induction of\nIFN-\u03b2 expression in cell culture (24\u201326). Similarly, MERS-CoV infection has been found to\nelicit a poor type-1 IFN response in cultured monocyte-derived dendritic cells\n(27) and alveolar epithelial A549 cells\n(28) as well as ex vivo\nin bronchial and lung tissue samples (28).\nFurthermore, delayed induction of proinflammatory cytokines in human airway\nepithelial cells infected with MERS-CoV has been reported (29).\n\nAlthough the above observations suggest that MERS- and SARS-CoV actively suppress\nantiviral responses, such as IFN-\u03b2 production and inflammation, they do not\ndirectly implicate the DUB activity of PLpro as being responsible for\n(part of) this suppression. Due to the dependence of MERS-CoV replication on the\nability of PLpro to cleave the nsp1\u2013nsp3 region of the replicase\npolyproteins, studying the role of PLpro DUB activity, specifically in\nthe suppression of the cellular innate immune response, is difficult because both\nactivities depend on the same enzyme active site. Selective inactivation of only the\nDUB activity of PLpro would enable the study of how this activity alone\naffects cellular signaling; however, achieving this requires detailed information on\nthe structural basis of Ub recognition and deconjugation by PLpro. To\nthis end, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV PLpro bound to\nUb to elucidate the molecular determinants of Ub recognition. Based on the structure\nof this complex, mutations were introduced that selectively disrupted Ub recognition\nby targeting regions of the Ub-binding site on PLpro that were\nsufficiently distant from the active site of the protease. Using this approach, we\nwere able to remove the DUB activity from PLpro without affecting its\nability to cleave the nsp3\u21934 cleavage site in trans. This\nenabled us, for the first time, to demonstrate that the DUB activity of MERS-CoV\nPLpro can suppress the MAVS-mediated induction of IFN-\u03b2\nexpression.\n\nHEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Bodinco BV), 100 units/ml\npenicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm\nl-glutamine (cell culture medium and supplements were obtained\nfrom Lonza).\n\nPrimary antibodies used were mouse anti-HA (ab18181; Abcam), mouse\nanti-V5 (37-7500; Invitrogen), mouse anti-\u03b2-actin (A5316;\nSigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-FLAG (F3165; Sigma-Aldrich), and rabbit\nanti-GFP (30). As secondary\nantibodies, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies were used\n(P0447 and P0217; Dako).\n\nThe following plasmids were described elsewhere: pASK3 (31), pcDNA-eGFP (30), pCMV-FLAG-Ub (32), pLuc-IFN-\u03b2 (33), pEBG-RIG-I(2CARD) (34), pcDNA-FLAG-MAVS (35), and\npEGFP-C1-IRF3(5D) (36).\n\nA cDNA fragment encoding the PLpro domain (amino acids\n1479\u20131803 of the MERS-CoV pp1a/pp1ab polyprotein (NCBI ID:\nJX869059); pp1a/pp1ab amino acid numbering is used throughout the rest\nof this work) was cloned into bacterial expression vector pASK3 in-frame\nwith N-terminal Ub and a C-terminal His6 purification tag to\nproduce pASK-MERS-CoV-PLpro.\n\nUsing standard methodologies, the sequence encoding amino acids\n1480\u20131803 of MERS-CoV pp1a/pp1ab was PCR-amplified, cloned\ndownstream of the T7 promoter of expression vector pE-SUMO\n(LifeSensors), and used to transform Escherichia coli\nBL21 (DE3) GOLD cells (Stratagene) grown under kanamycin selection (35\n\u03bcg/ml). Recombinant expression plasmid\n(pE-SUMO-PLpro) was isolated from a single colony, and DNA\nsequencing confirmed the expected sequence of the PLpro\ndomain and the in-frame fusion of the 5\u2032-end to a sequence\nencoding a His6-SUMO purification tag, which facilitated\npurification of the product by immobilized metal (nickel) affinity\nchromatography as described below.\n\nTo obtain high expression in eukaryotic cells, the sequence of MERS-CoV\nnsp3\u20134 (amino acids 854\u20133246) flanked by an N-terminal\nHA tag and a C-terminal V5 tag was optimized based on the human codon\nusage frequency, and potential splice sites and polyadenylation signals\nwere removed. This sequence was synthesized (Invitrogen) and\nsubsequently cloned into the pCAGGS vector (Addgene) using standard\nmethodologies. The following expression constructs were generated:\npCAGGS-HA-nsp3-4-V5 (amino acids 854\u20133246), pCAGGS-HA-nsp3C-4-V5\n(amino acids 1820\u20133246, which does not include the\nPLpro domain), and pCAGGS-HA-nsp3-Myc (amino acids\n854\u20132739). The sequence encoding MERS-CoV PLpro\n(amino acids 1479\u20131803) was PCR-amplified using synthetic\nplasmid DNA as a template and cloned in frame with a C-terminal V5 tag\nin the pcDNA3.1(\u2212) vector (Invitrogen). The\npASK-MERS-CoV-PLpro and\npcDNA3.1-MERS-CoV-PLproexpression constructs served as\ntemplates for site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange strategy\nwith Pfu DNA polymerase (Agilent). All constructs were\nverified by sequencing. The sequences of the constructs and primers used\nin this study are available upon request.\n\nIn vitro DUB activity assays were performed with\nrecombinant MERS-CoV PLpro batch-purified from lysates of\nE. coli strain C2523. Cells transformed with\npASK-MERS-CoV-PLpro were cultured to an\nA600 of 0.6 in lysogeny broth at 37\n\u00b0C. Protein expression was then induced with 200 ng/ml\nanhydrotetracycline for 16 h at 20 \u00b0C. The cells were pelleted,\nresuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 200\nmm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme), and\nlysed for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C, followed by sonication. The lysate was\nclarified by centrifugation at 20,000 \u00d7 g for\n20 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the soluble fraction was applied to Talon\nresin (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. After a 2-h\nrolling incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the beads were washed four times\nwith wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl,\n10% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole), followed by the\nelution of the protein with elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH\n7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 250 mm\nimidazole). Eluted protein was dialyzed against storage buffer (20\nmm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 50% (v/v) glycerol,\n2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) and stored at \u221280\n\u00b0C. N-terminal Ub is cleaved from the\nUb-PLpro-His6 fusion protein by the\nPLpro domain itself during expression. To achieve removal\nof the Ub from mutated and/or inactive PLpro, E.\ncoli strain C2523 containing pCG1, expressing the\nubiquitin-specific processing protease 1 (Ubp1), was used (37).\n\nIn vitro DUB activity assays were performed as described\nby van Kasteren et al. (30). Briefly, the indicated amounts of purified MERS-CoV\nPLpro wild type or active site mutant (C1592A) were\nincubated with 2.5 \u03bcg of either Lys48-linked poly-Ub\nchains or Lys63-linked poly-Ub chains (Boston Biochem) in a\nfinal volume of 10 \u03bcl. Isopeptidase T (Boston Biochem) served as\na positive control. After a 2-h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the\nreaction was stopped by the addition of 4\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer\n(4\u00d7 LSB; 500 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.02%\nbromphenol blue, 2 mm DTT, pH 6.8). SDS-polyacrylamide gels\nwere stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma-Aldrich) and scanned\nusing a GS-800 calibrated densitometer (Bio-Rad).\n\nE. coli BL21(DE3) GOLD cells harboring\npE-SUMO-PLpro were grown at 37 \u00b0C with aeration\nin 500 ml of lysogeny broth containing kanamycin (35 \u03bcg/ml) to\nan A600 of 0.6\u20130.8. Expression of\nthe His6-SUMO-PLpro fusion protein was then\ninduced by the addition 1 mm isopropyl\n\u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 18 h at 16 \u00b0C\nwith aeration. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at\n\u221280 \u00b0C.\n\nCell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm\nTris, pH 8.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl\nfluoride (PMSF), 2 mm DTT) and lysed using a French pressure\ncell (AMINCO). Cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (17,211\n\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C), and the supernatant\ncontaining the His6-SUMO-PLpro fusion was applied\nto a column containing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin\n(Qiagen). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer\nsupplemented with 25 mm imidazole, followed by elution of the\nfusion protein with lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole.\nThe His6-SUMO tag was then removed from PLpro by\nadding His6-tagged Ulp1 SUMO protease to the eluted\nSUMO-PLpro fusion, followed by dialysis of the protein\nmixture overnight against 2 liters of cleavage buffer (150 mm\nNaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT) at 4 \u00b0C.\nTag-free PLpro was separated from His6-SUMO and\nthe His6-Ulp1 SUMO protease by passing the dialyzed protein\nmix through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid gravity column. The\nflow-through contained purified PLpro that was subsequently\ndialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2\nmm DTT and further purified by gel filtration using a\nSuperdex 75 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column.\n\nUb(1\u201375)-3-bromopropylamine (Ub-3Br) is a modified form of Ub\nwith a reactive C terminus that forms an irreversible covalent linkage\nto the active site cysteine of DUBs and was prepared according to\nMessick et al. (38) and Borodovsky et al. (39). Purified PLpro was incubated\nwith a 2-fold molar excess of Ub-3Br and incubated for 1 h at room\ntemperature with end-over-end mixing. The resulting\nPLpro\u00b7Ub complex was dialyzed into 20 mm\nTris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and excess Ub-3Br\nwas removed by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 column.\n\nThe purified PLpro\u00b7Ub complex was concentrated and\ncrystallized at 20 \u00b0C in two different conditions using the\nvapor diffusion method: 1) 20% PEG 4000, 0.1 m trisodium\ncitrate, pH 5.4, 20% isopropyl alcohol at 10 mg/ml, which yielded the\nstructure of open PLpro\u00b7Ub (see\n\u201cResults\u201d), and 2) 1.80 m ammonium sulfate\n(AmSO4) at 20 mg/ml, which yielded the structure of\nclosed PLpro\u00b7Ub (see \u201cResults\u201d).\nCrystals of unliganded PLpro were also grown using the vapor\ndiffusion method in 18% PEG 4000, 0.1 m trisodium citrate, pH\n5.6, 16% isopropyl alcohol after concentrating the protein to 12 mg/ml.\nImmediately prior to crystallization, 1 m DTT was added to the\nprotein to a final concentration of 5 mm, which was found to\nimprove crystallization.\n\nIn preparation for x-ray data collection, single crystals of open\nPLpro\u00b7Ub from condition 1 above were briefly\nswept through a droplet of cryoprotectant composed of 22% PEG 4000, 0.1\nm trisodium citrate, pH 5.6, 20% 1,2-propanediol before\nflash cooling in liquid nitrogen. Similarly, single crystals of closed\nPLpro\u00b7Ub from condition 2 above and unbound\nPLpro were cryoprotected in 1.85 m\nAmSO4, 15% glycerol and 22% PEG 4000, 0.1 m\ntrisodium citrate, pH 5.6, 10% 1,2-propanediol, respectively, before\nflash cooling in liquid nitrogen.\n\nX-ray diffraction data were collected from all crystals at the Zn-K\nabsorption edge at beamline 08B1-1 of the Canadian Light Source and\nintegrated using XDS (40).\nIntegrated data were then scaled using Scala (41). Initial phase estimates for reflections\ncollected from unliganded and Ub-bound PLpro were determined\nvia a single wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment. The position of\nthe zinc anomalous scatterer was identified using HySS (42), and density modification was performed\nwith RESOLVE (43) within the\nphenix.autosol pipeline (44).\nInitial models were constructed using phenix.autobuild, and further\nmodel building and refinement were carried out using Coot (45) and phenix.refine (46). Crystallographic statistics\nfor all structures are found in Table\n1.\n\nHEK293T cells, grown to 80% confluence in 12-well plates, were\ntransfected using the calcium phosphate transfection method (47). To determine the DUB activity\nof MERS-CoV PLpro, plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged Ub (0.25\n\u03bcg), GFP (0.25 \u03bcg), and MERS-CoV-PLpro-V5\n(0.2 \u03bcg) were co-transfected. A combination of plasmids encoding\nGFP (0.25 \u03bcg), HA-nsp3C-4-V5 (0.2 \u03bcg), and\nMERS-CoV-PLpro-V5 (0.15 \u03bcg) were transfected to\nassess the in trans cleavage activity of\nMERS-CoV-PLpro. Total amounts of transfected DNA were\nequalized to 2 \u03bcg by the addition of empty pcDNA vector. At 18 h\npost-transfection, cells were lysed in 2\u00d7 LSB. Proteins were\nseparated in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto Hybond-P (GE\nHealthcare) using the Trans-blot turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad).\nAspecific binding to the membrane was blocked with dried milk powder\nsolution, and after antibody incubation, protein bands were visualized\nusing Pierce ECL 2 Western blotting substrate (Thermo Scientific).\n\nUsing the calcium phosphate method, 80% confluent HEK293T cells in\n24-well plates were transfected with 5 ng of plasmid pRL-TK (Promega)\nencoding Renilla luciferase; IFN-\u03b2-Luc firefly\nreporter plasmid (25 ng); innate immune response inducer plasmids\nencoding RIG-I(2CARD), MAVS, or IRF3(5D) (25 ng);\nand the indicated quantities of MERS-CoV PLpro- or MERS-CoV\nnsp3-encoding expression plasmids. Total amounts of transfected DNA were\nequalized to 1 \u03bcg by the addition of empty pcDNA vector. At 16 h\npost-transfection, cells were lysed in 1\u00d7 passive lysis buffer\n(Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was\nmeasured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) on a\nMithras LB 940 multimode reader (Berthold Technologies). Experiments\nwere performed in triplicate and independently repeated at least four\ntimes. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to\nRenilla luciferase, and statistical significance\nwas determined using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t\ntest. Values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n4\u00d7 LSB was added to the remaining lysates, and these samples\nwere analyzed by Western blotting as described above.\n\nIt was recently shown in cell culture experiments that ectopic expression of\nMERS-CoV PLpro resulted in deconjugation of poly-Ub and ISG15 from\ncellular targets (9, 16). DUB activity of purified recombinant MERS-CoV\nPLpro was also demonstrated using\nUb-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (48)\nor Ub-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (49) as a\nsubstrate. To characterize the direct activity of recombinant MERS-CoV\nPLpro toward poly-Ub, we purified the enzyme from E.\ncoli and incubated it with either Lys48- or\nLys63-linked poly-Ub chains. Wild-type PLpro degraded\nboth Lys48- and Lys63-linked chains in a\nconcentration-dependent manner, whereas mutating the active site nucleophile\n(C1592A) severely reduced the activity of the enzyme toward both Ub linkage\ntypes (Fig. 1). No clear preference of the\nenzyme for cleaving either the Lys63 or the Lys48 Ub\nlinkage was observed under the conditions used in this in vitro\nDUB assay (Fig. 1, compare\nA and B). This assay clearly demonstrated\nthat the protease domain used throughout this study for ectopic expression and\ncrystallization experiments possesses DUB activity toward Lys48- and\nLys63-linked Ub chains and that this activity does not require\nother viral or cellular proteins. During the preparation of this manuscript, an\narticle by B\u00e1ez-Santos et al. (50) was published in which similar results were\npresented.\n\nThe crystal structure of PLpro was determined both on its own\nand as a covalent complex with Ub (PLpro\u00b7Ub). The\nPLpro domain crystallized in space group P63,\nand consistent with another recently determined crystal structure of\nMERS-CoV PLpro (49),\nwe found the protease to adopt a fold consistent with DUBs of the\nubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family. The structure includes a\nC-terminal catalytic domain containing a right-handed fingers, palm, and\nthumb domain organization as well as an N-terminal Ub-like (Ubl) domain\nfound in many USPs, including that of SARS-CoV (51, 52) (Fig.\n2A). The packing of the palm and thumb\ndomains forms a cleft leading into the active site in a manner\nconsistent with the domain organization prototyped by the Clan CA group\nof cysteine proteases (53). The\nUbl domain packs against the thumb domain composed of helices\n\u03b12\u20137, which in turn packs against the palm domain\ncomposed of strands \u03b26, \u03b27, and \u03b214\u201319.\nExtending from the palm, the fingers domain is composed of strands\n\u03b210, \u03b211, \u03b213, \u03b214, and \u03b219 and\ncontains a C4 zinc ribbon motif (54) coordinating a zinc atom via residues\nCys1672, Cys1675, Cys1707, and\nCys1709 in tetrahedral geometry, similar to that of SARS\nPLpro, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus\nPL1pro, and cellular USP2 and USP21 (51, 55\u201357).\n\nThe MERS-CoV PLpro\u00b7Ub complex crystallized in two\ndifferent space groups (P63 and P6522), which\nrevealed a considerable level of conformational flexibility in the\nprotein. Electron density maps calculated using diffraction data\ncollected from PLpro\u00b7Ub complex that crystallized in\nspace group P63 revealed weak density for the covalently\nbound Ub molecule. Although the entire bound Ub molecule could be\nmodeled within its binding site on PLpro in this crystal\nform, high temperature factors for atoms comprising the modeled Ub\nmolecule suggested that it was not rigidly bound to the protease despite\nbeing covalently linked to the active site cysteine. Further analysis of\nthe crystal packing revealed that the Ub molecule was fully exposed to\nsolvent and not involved in crystal contacts, which provided a degree of\nmobility to Ub when bound to PLpro (Fig. 3A). This result encouraged us\nto pursue additional crystallization conditions, which yielded crystals\nof PLpro\u00b7Ub in space group P6522 (Figs. 2B and 3B). The crystal\npacking in this space group allowed for multiple crystal contacts\nbetween the bound Ub monomer and surrounding symmetry mates and resulted\nin clear, well defined density for the Ub molecule (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, relative\nto the P63 crystal forms of PLpro, the fingers\ndomain in this crystal form was moved toward Ub (Fig. 2C). In light of these\nmovements, the PLpro\u00b7Ub structure with the fingers\ndomain positioned away from Ub (space group P63) will\nhereafter be referred to as \u201copen\u201d\nPLpro\u00b7Ub, whereas the structure with the fingers\ndomain shifted toward Ub (space group P6522) will be referred\nto as \u201cclosed\u201d PLpro\u00b7Ub. An overlay\nof the different PLpro crystal structures that have been\ndetermined reveals that these structures vary in the position of the\nzinc ribbon motif, further suggesting a high degree of mobility for this\nregion (Fig. 2C).\nIn line with this observation, movement of the fingers domain toward\nbound Ub was also reported for the SARS-CoV PLpro domain,\nwhich displayed a 3.8-\u212b movement of the zinc atom when comparing\nthe Ub-bound and unbound structures (58). Further comparison of the closed MERS-CoV\nPLpro\u00b7Ub structure with the recently determined\nSARS-CoV PLpro\u00b7Ub structure (58) revealed differences in the relative\norientation of the fingers domain of the two proteases. The MERS-CoV\nPLpro fingers domain was found to be shifted\n\u223c26\u00b0 away from the palm domain compared with that of\nSARS-CoV PLpro, resulting in a slight difference in the Ub\nbinding orientation, with the MERS-CoV PLpro-bound Ub being\npositioned closer toward helix \u03b17 of the palm domain (Fig. 4).\n\nThe cleft formed between the palm and thumb domains of PLpro guides\nthe C-terminal 72RLRGG76 motif of Ub toward the protease\nactive site, and the interactions between the C-terminal motif of Ub and the\nactive site cleft are depicted in Fig. 5\n(A and B). The PLpro active\nsite is composed of a Cys1592-His1759-Asp1774\ncatalytic triad, which adopts a catalytically competent arrangement in both the\nunliganded and Ub-bound structures of PLpro (Fig. 5C). The oxyanion hole of the\nPLpro active site appears to be composed of backbone amides from\nresidues Asn1590, Asn1591, and Cys1592, which\nappear suitably arranged to stabilize the negative charge that develops on the\ncarbonyl oxygen of the scissile bond during catalysis (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, as noted by Lei\net al. (49), the\nMERS-CoV PLpro active site appears incomplete. In SARS-CoV\nPLpro, Trp107 (amino acid numbering according to the\nstructure of Protein Data Bank entry 2FE8) is positioned within the enzyme's active\nsite with the indole nitrogen of its side chain oriented such that it is\nprobably involved in forming part of the oxyanion hole (51). In the case of MERS-CoV PLpro, we and\nothers (48, 49) have found the structurally equivalent residue in\nMERS-CoV PLpro to be Leu1587, which would be unable to\nparticipate in stabilizing the oxyanion during catalysis. Furthermore, it was\nrecently shown that MERS-CoV PLpro L1587W mutants show greater\ncatalytic efficiency than wild-type PLpro (48, 49). Given\nthe effect this residue has on the catalytic rate of PLpro, it will\nbe very interesting to understand how this residue influences MERS-CoV\nreplication kinetics. It has been proposed that the decreased catalytic\nefficiency may influence maturation of the MERS-CoV polyprotein (48) and could be involved in the recognition of\nresidues downstream of the scissile bond of the polyprotein cleavage sites or in\nthe modulation of PLpro DUB activity.\n\nInterestingly, differences were observed in the position of a loop on\nPLpro connecting strands \u03b215 and \u03b216, which is\nstructurally analogous to the blocking loop (BL2) first described in the\nstructure of USP14 (59). This loop is\ndisordered in our unliganded PLpro structure and that previously\ndetermined by others (49); however, in\nboth of our PLpro\u00b7Ub structures, we found this loop to be\nfully resolved, supported by the main-chain hydrogen-bonding interactions\nbetween Arg74 of Ub and Gly1758 of PLpro, as\nwell as a hydrophobic interaction between Val1757 and\nPro1644, two PLpro residues present on opposite sides\nof the active site cleft (Fig.\n5A). The side-chain \u03b7-amino group of the Ub\nresidue Arg74 is also hydrogen-bonded to the main-chain carbonyl\ngroup of PLpro residue Thr1755; however, this interaction\nis only seen in the open PLpro\u00b7Ub structure. The SARS-CoV\nPLpro domain has also been crystallized both in the presence\n(51) and absence (58) of Ub, and although the BL2 loop of unbound\nSARS-CoV PLpro was resolved in two of three monomers of the\nasymmetric unit, the third showed weak electron density for BL2 and high\ntemperature factors, indicating a high degree of mobility. In addition, in the\ntransmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus USP domain PL1pro, a\nstructurally analogous BL2 loop was found to be in an open conformation with\npoorly defined electron density in the absence of substrate (55). It is interesting to note that all three\ncoronavirus USP DUBs crystallized to date (from MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and\ntransmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus) demonstrate a significant degree of\nflexibility within the BL2 loop region in the absence of substrate and that none\nof the structures determined in their unbound form demonstrate obstruction of\nthe active site via BL2.\n\nWe previously demonstrated that the DUB activity of the papain-like protease 2\n(PLP2) from equine arteritis virus (another member of the nidovirus order),\nwhich resembles the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain-containing family of DUBs (60), could be selectively removed without\naffecting its ability to process the equine arteritis virus replicase\npolyprotein. This allowed us to establish that the DUB activity of PLP2 is\ndirectly responsible for suppressing Ub-dependent antiviral pathways during\ninfection of primary host cells (61).\nSubsequently, Ratia et al. (62) applied a similar strategy to the SARS-CoV PLpro\ndomain in order to partially remove the DUB activity of PLpro while\nmaintaining the nsp2-3-processing function. We now used the crystal structure of\nthe USP-like MERS PLpro\u00b7Ub complex to guide the design of\nmutations targeting the Ub-binding site on PLpro that would\ncompletely disrupt Ub binding without affecting the structural integrity of the\nactive site. PLpro residues interacting directly with Ub were\nreplaced with larger, bulkier residues that would prevent Ub binding by altering\nboth shape and surface electrostatics of the Ub-binding site. Individual\nmutation of eight different PLpro residues (Arg1649,\nThr1653, Ala1656, Asn1673,\nVal1674, Val1691, Val1706, and\nGln1708) and combinations thereof were generated (Fig. 6, A\u2013D).\nImportantly, these residues are located at a distance from the PLpro\nactive site, and thus we hypothesized that they would only participate in DUB\nactivity and not polyprotein processing.\n\nDespite significant movement within the fingers domain of PLpro, most\ninteractions between the protease and Ub are consistent between the open and\nclosed Ub-bound complexes. Residue Ile44 of Ub, which forms part of\nthe hydrophobic patch that is commonly recognized by Ub-binding proteins (63), interacts with the hydrophobic side\nchain of Val1691 of PLpro (Fig. 6B). Residues Gln49 and\nGlu51 of Ub form hydrogen-bonding interactions with\nThr1653 that is present on helix \u03b17, which runs through\nthe center of PLpro. Two arginine residues, Arg1649 of\nPLpro and Arg72 of Ub (the latter of which forms part\nof the C-terminal tail of Ub that is bound in the PLpro active site\ncleft) are oriented such that the guanidinium groups of these residues are\narranged in a stacked conformation (Fig.\n6C). In addition, due to the inward movement toward\nUb of the closed PLpro\u00b7Ub fingers domain, a unique\nhydrogen-bonding interaction between Gln62 of Ub and\nGln1708 of PLpro and a hydrophobic interaction between\nPhe4 of Ub and Val1706 of PLpro were found\nto occur in this complex (Fig.\n6D). Residue Ala1656 is positioned near\nthe C terminus of PLpro helix \u03b17, and although it is not\ndirectly involved in Ub binding, we believed that it was positioned such that\nthe introduction of larger residues (e.g. arginine or\nphenylalanine) could disrupt Ub recognition, and thus this residue was targeted\nfor mutation (Fig. 6C).\nTwo residues on the solvent-facing region of the PLpro zinc ribbon\nmotif, Asn1673 and Val1674, were also targeted for\nmutagenesis. Although they do not bind Ub at the S1 binding site (the substrate\nbinding site on PLpro responsible for binding mono(Ub) in our\nstructure; see Ref. 64 for nomenclature),\nwe hypothesized that it may inhibit association with the distal Ub on\nLys63 poly-Ub chains based on a superposition of a\nLys63-linked di-Ub model onto the PLpro-bound Ub\nmolecule of the closed PLpro\u00b7Ub complex structure determined\nhere (not shown). In addition, the crystal structure of USP21 bound to linear\ndi-Ub was recently determined and revealed that the tip of the fingers domain of\nthis DUB acts as an S2 recognition site, binding to the distal Ub of a linear\ndi-Ub molecule (57). Given the structural\nsimilarity between Lys63 di-Ub and linear di-Ub and the clear\nactivity we observed for MERS-CoV PLpro toward Lys63, we\nhypothesized that mutating residues Asn1673 and Val1674\nnear the zinc ribbon may also disrupt Ub processing.\n\nUsing a previously described ectopic expression assay (61), we monitored the effects of amino acid\nsubstitutions in PLpro, as described above, on overall levels of\nUb-conjugated proteins in HEK293T cells as well as the ability of these\nPLpro variants to process the MERS-CoV nsp3\u21934 polyprotein\ncleavage site in trans. V5-tagged PLpro (wild type\nand mutants) was co-expressed with N-terminally HA-tagged and C-terminally\nV5-tagged MERS-CoV nsp3C-4 excluding the PLpro domain, hereafter\nreferred to as HA-nsp3C-4-V5. We assume that the successful processing of the\nnsp3\u21934 site in HA-nsp3C-4-V5 is indicative of unaltered proteolytic\ncleavage capability of PLpro, which during infection facilitates the\nrelease of nsp1, -2, and -3 from the viral polyproteins. Processing of\nHA-nsp3C-4-V5 in trans by wild-type PLpro and our\npanel of mutants was visualized via Western blotting (Fig. 7A). Whereas wild-type\nPLpro was able to cleave HA-nsp3C-4-V5 substrate in\ntrans, the PLpro active site mutant C1592A was\nunable to cleave the nsp3\u21934 site (Fig.\n7A, compare lanes 5 and\n6 and lanes 19 and 20).\nAs expected, each of the substitutions in the Ub-binding site of\nPLpro only minimally affected nsp3\u21934 cleavage, with the\nexception of the A1656R mutant that displayed a clearly reduced ability to\ncleave HA-nsp3C-4-V5 compared with wild-type PLpro (Fig. 7A, compare\nlanes 5 and 10). This suggests that\nAla1656 of PLpro may be involved in recognizing and\nbinding sequences in the vicinity of the nsp3\u21934 cleavage site. Most\ndouble and triple substitutions tested were also slightly less efficient in\ncleaving HA-nsp3C-4-V5 compared with the wild-type control.\n\nIn order to analyze the effect of the mutations on overall DUB activity,\nPLpro-V5 was co-expressed with FLAG-Ub, and the levels of\nFLAG-Ub-conjugated cellular proteins were visualized via Western blotting (Fig. 7B). Expression of\nwild-type PLpro resulted in a strong decrease of the accumulation of\nFLAG-Ub conjugates, whereas a negligible effect was observed upon expression of\nactive site mutant C1592A (Fig.\n7B, compare lanes 3 and\n4 and lanes 16 and 17).\nSubstitutions of residue Val1691, positioned on strand \u03b212 of\nPLpro, and Thr1653 and Ala1656, residues\nlocated on helix \u03b17 (Fig. 6,\nB and C), displayed the clearest reduction\nof PLpro DUB activity (Fig.\n7B, lanes 5\u20138). The V1691R\nmutation had the most pronounced effect, and a PLpro T1653R/V1691R\ndouble mutant also displayed severely reduced DUB activity, comparable with that\nseen for the active site mutant (Fig.\n7B, compare lanes 4 and\n5 and lanes 17 and 22).\nNotably, a more conservative substitution at the same position, V1691L, had a\nmuch less pronounced effect on DUB activity (Fig.\n7B, lane 6). Substitution of\nVal1674 with either Ser or Arg impaired DUB activity but to a\nmuch lesser extent than substitutions targeting Val1691,\nThr1653, and Ala1656 (Fig. 7B, compare lanes\n5\u20138, 10, and 11). The N1673R\nsubstitution did not negatively affect DUB activity of PLpro at all,\nwhereas the N1673R/V1674S double substitution resulted in slightly greater DUB\nactivity (Fig. 7B,\nlanes 9 and 20). These results do not\nsupport our hypothesis based on modeling that Asn1673 and\nVal1674 might form part of an S2 binding site that recognizes an\nadditional distal Ub within a Lys63-linked chain. Further structural\nstudies are needed to validate the role of these residues in binding Ub chains.\nIt should be noted, however, that these mutants may still be able to process\nLys63-linked poly-Ub chains by recognizing a single Ub monomer at\nthe end of a poly-Ub substrate, which may explain the ineffectiveness of these\nmutations in disrupting DUB activity. Mutations at residues Val1706\nand Gln1708 did not influence DUB activity of PLpro (Fig. 7B, lanes\n18 and 19). Given that these residues were only\nfound to interact with Ub in our closed PLpro structure (Fig. 6A), their failure to\ninhibit DUB activity in this cellular DUB assay is not surprising and indicates\nthat these residues are not essential for Ub recognition. Interestingly and\nrepeatedly observed, the R1649Y mutant was found to have even greater DUB\nactivity than wild-type PLpro (Fig.\n7B, compare lanes 3 and\n12). This residue was found to interact with residue\nArg72 of Ub, and although this result was unexpected, it is\npossible that the R1649Y mutant retains the ability to interact with\nArg72 of Ub via a cation-\u03c0 interaction between the\naromatic tyrosine inserted into PLpro and the positively charged\narginine of Ub. Together, the findings from our mutagenesis study demonstrate\nthat it is possible to selectively decouple the DUB and polyprotein processing\nactivities of MERS-CoV PLpro through structure-guided site-directed\nmutagenesis.\n\nConjugation and deconjugation of Ub plays an important role in the regulation of\nthe innate immune response, and not surprisingly, pathogens have evolved\nmechanisms to subvert these Ub-dependent pathways (reviewed in Ref. 22). For arteriviruses, which are distant\nrelatives of CoVs within the nidovirus order, it has been shown that the DUB\nactivity of their PLP2 is involved in antagonizing IFN-\u03b2 activation upon\nectopic expression, and for equine arteritis virus, this was confirmed during\ninfection in host cells (61, 65). Coronavirus papain-like proteases have\nbeen suggested to act as IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB antagonists as well\n(15, 23, 66, 67). MERS-CoV PLpro is thought to possess\nthese properties based on its capability to inhibit RIG-I-, MDA5-, and\nMAVS-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulation and to reduce\nTNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB reporter gene activity (9, 16). We\ntherefore designed luciferase-based reporter gene assays to establish whether\nthe DUB activity of MERS-CoV PLpro alone suffices to antagonize the\nIFN-\u03b2 pathway. To this end, we first assessed at which level of this\ninnate immune signal transduction pathway MERS-CoV PLpro is most\nactive as a suppressor.\n\nInnate immune signaling was induced in HEK293T cells by expression of one of\nthree signaling factors, RIG-I, MAVS, or IRF3, which stimulate the pathway\nleading to IFN-\u03b2 production at different levels. Because RIG-I and IRF3\nnormally need to be activated through post-translational modification\n(ubiquitination and phosphorylation, respectively), constitutively active\nvariants were used (RIG-I(2CARD) and IRF3(5D)), which\nefficiently induce downstream signaling independent of these activation steps.\nCells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding one of these innate immune\nsignaling proteins and wild-type PLpro, the PLpro active\nsite mutant C1592A, or full-length MERS-CoV nsp3 containing the PLpro\ndomain. The inhibitory effect of the PLpro variants on the activation\nof the IFN-\u03b2 promotor by the different stimuli was measured via\nco-expression of a firefly luciferase reporter gene under control of the\nIFN-\u03b2 promoter. Another co-transfected plasmid encoding\nRenilla luciferase was included as an internal control in\norder to be able to correct for variability in transfection efficiency. At 16 h\npost-transfection, luciferase activities were measured, and activation of the\nIFN-\u03b2 promoter induced by expression of RIG-I(2CARD), MAVS,\nor IRF3(5D) was set at 100% (Fig.\n8). In accordance with Mielech et al. (16), we observed that MERS-CoV\nPLpro significantly reduced the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation\nthat could be induced by expression of either RIG-I(2CARD) or MAVS.\nThis effect was concentration-dependent, whereas the PLpro active\nsite mutant was unable to block IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation (Fig. 8, A and\nC). MERS-CoV nsp3 expression also inhibited RIG-I- and\nMAVS-mediated IFN-\u03b2 promoter induction (Fig. 8, B and D), and together\nthis suggested that PLpro inhibits innate immune signaling at least\ndownstream of the MAVS adaptor and possibly also in the signaling between RIG-I\nand MAVS. MERS-CoV PLpro also inhibited activation of the\nIFN-\u03b2 promoter after stimulation with IRF3(5D) in a\nconcentration-dependent manner, whereas the C1592A mutant did not reduce\nIFN-\u03b2 promoter activation (Fig.\n8E). However, expression of full-length MERS-CoV\nnsp3 did not significantly inhibit IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation after\nstimulation with IRF3(5D) (Fig.\n8F). This suggests that the subcellular localization\nof the protease, which in the case of full-length nsp3 is membrane-anchored and\nin the case of the PLpro domain is presumably cytosolic, may be\nimportant in determining its substrate specificity. Taken together, our results\nsuggest that MERS-CoV PLpro primarily interferes with the\nIFN-\u03b2 signaling pathway at the level between MAVS and IRF3.\n\nWe therefore chose to use MAVS-mediated induction of IFN-\u03b2 promoter\nactivation in subsequent experiments. This also resulted in the strongest\ninhibition by PLpro, providing a maximum window to assess the effects\non IFN-\u03b2 promoter inhibition by the PLpro mutants with\nspecifically inactivated DUB activity. Inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 promoter\nactivation by wild-type and mutant PLpro was determined by\ncalculating the relative luciferase activity (Fig.\n9). Expression of wild-type PLpro reduced MAVS-induced\nIFN-\u03b2 promoter activity to \u223c20% of the control, whereas active\nsite mutant C1592A reduced it by only a few percent compared with the untreated\ncontrol (Fig. 9). Substitutions T1653R and\nA1656R resulted in greatly impaired DUB activity (Fig. 7B, lanes 7 and\n8), and compared with wild-type PLpro,\nexpression of these mutants resulted in higher IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity,\nwith relative luciferase values of \u223c54 and 58% respectively (Fig. 9). It should, however, be noted that\nthe A1656R mutant was also impaired in cleaving the nsp3\u21934 site, and\ntherefore this mutation nonspecifically disrupted the two proteolytic functions\nof PLpro. Strikingly, each mutant containing the V1691R substitution\nwas completely unable to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation, resulting in\nrelative luciferase activity levels similar to those seen with the active site\nmutant (Fig. 9, lanes 4,\n16, and 17). This strongly suggested that\nthe DUB activity of PLpro, which we found to be severely impaired in\nV1691R mutants (Fig. 7B),\nis responsible for suppressing MAVS-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity in\nthis assay. The level of reduction in DUB activity corresponded to the degree of\ninhibition of IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation for all PLpro mutants\ntested, which strengthens this conclusion. In accordance with its increased DUB\nactivity, mutant R1649Y suppressed MAVS-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity\nmore effectively than wild-type PLpro.\n\nTaken together, our data show that the DUB activity of MERS-CoV PLpro\nsuffices to efficiently suppress MAVS-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation\nand that this activity can be selectively disabled, without disrupting protease\nactivity toward the nsp3\u21934 cleavage site, by targeting the Ub-binding\nsite of the enzyme. This demonstrates for the first time that the DUB activity\nof MERS-CoV PLpro is specifically responsible for suppressing the\ninnate immune response.\n\nGuided by the MERS PLpro\u00b7Ub crystal structures, we here describe\nhow the DUB activity of PLpro can be selectively disabled by introducing\nmutations into the S1 binding pocket of the protease (Fig. 6). Particularly, the substitution of Val1691 with the\nbulky and charged arginine residue severely impaired DUB activity in our cell\nculture-based assays. In addition, our results demonstrate that the majority of the\nmutations within the S1 Ub-binding site of PLpro that were tested do not\naffect trans cleavage of the nsp3\u21934 junction, with the\nexception of an A1656R mutant that did disrupt cleavage of the nsp3\u21934 site.\nThe latter result indicates that Ala1656 resides in a region of\nPLpro that recognizes both Ub and a region of the nsp3C-4 construct\nthat was used to test cleavage efficiency.\n\nOur results demonstrate that the DUB activity of MERS-CoV PLpro inhibits\nIFN-\u03b2 promoter activation when innate immune signaling is induced by\nco-expression of either RIG-I or MAVS. The fact that suppression of IFN-\u03b2\npromoter activation was completely eliminated for several of our mutants (Fig. 9) strongly suggests that the proteolytic\nactivity still present in those mutant enzymes has no additional role in the\nsuppression of this particular branch of the innate immune response\n(e.g. by directly cleaving RIG-I or MAVS). A number of other\nCoV papain-like proteases with DUB activity have also been implicated in\nantagonizing the host innate immune response (15, 23, 66, 67). In\nagreement with our data, recent studies have demonstrated the ability of MERS-CoV\nPLpro to inhibit RIG-I-, MDA5-, and MAVS-dependent IFN-\u03b2\npromoter activation as well as to down-regulate the level of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA\ntranscripts in MDA5-stimulated cells (16).\nThe current data support the hypothesis that all of these activities solely depend\non the deubiquitinating capacities of these coronavirus enzymes. Reports regarding\nthe dependence of MERS-CoV PLpro-mediated IFN-\u03b2 antagonism on the\nenzyme's protease activity have, however, varied thus far. Mielech et\nal. (16) recently demonstrated\nthat a MERS-CoV nsp3 fragment containing PLpro but excluding the\ntransmembrane domain can inhibit MAVS-, RIG-I-, and MDA5-dependent IFN-\u03b2\npromoter activation, and MDA5 mediated IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription only with a\nfunctional PLpro active site. Yang et al. (9) on the other hand used a MERS-CoV\nPLpro expression product extending into the nsp3 transmembrane region\nto demonstrate that down-regulation of RIG-I-stimulated IFN-\u03b2 promoter\nactivity is seen even with an active site knock-out mutant. Here we show that\ninhibition of RIG-I-, MAVS-, and IRF3-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity by the\nMERS-CoV PLpro domain is clearly dependent on a functional active site\nand that it is specifically the DUB activity of the protease that mediates this\ninhibition. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that other parts of nsp3\ncontain additional innate immune suppressing activities, which may be responsible\nfor the protease-independent effects reported with longer expression products.\n\nUbiquitination plays an important role in the regulation of pathways involved in\ndetecting and counteracting viral infections, and, not surprisingly, a number of\nviruses of substantial diversity have been found to deploy DUBs that manipulate\nthese signaling processes by reversing the post-translational modification of\ncellular proteins by Ub conjugation (19,\n68). Some of these DUBs, specifically\nthose found in (+)RNA viruses, are also critical for viral replication by catalyzing\nthe proteolytic cleavage of specific sites in viral polyproteins, thus complicating\nour ability to study the direct effects of the additional DUB activity of these\nviral proteases. Ultimately, these effects need to be studied in the context of a\nviral infection; however, a simple inactivation of the protease/DUB would not only\nfail to prove the specific involvement of the DUB activity, it would also prevent\nviral replication. The method described here selectively removed the DUB activity of\nthe MERS-CoV PLpro domain while leaving polyprotein processing activity\nat the nsp3\u21934 site unhindered, thus paving the way for the application of\nthese mutations to recombinant MERS-CoV and the direct study of the role of DUB\nactivity during infection.\n\nWe were able to show that Lys48- and Lys63-linked poly-Ub\nchains are processed in vitro by MERS-CoV PLpro at\nsimilar rates, which is in accordance with a recent report by B\u00e1ez-Santos\net al. (50). In\ncontrast, SARS-CoV PLpro rapidly cleaves Lys48-linked poly-Ub\nand displays only moderate activity for Lys63 linkages in similar assays\n(62). It has been suggested that SARS-CoV\nPLpro may recognize Lys48-linked di-Ub via its S1 and S2\nsites (62), although to date, no crystal\nstructures have been reported of SARS-CoV PLpro in complex with a di-Ub\nsubstrate. Similarly, no such structural data have been obtained for MERS-CoV\nPLpro, and thus future structural studies are necessary to determine\nprecisely how MERS-CoV PLpro recognizes poly-Ub substrates and whether\nthe preferences observed in expression systems can be confirmed in situations\nrepresentative of an infection.\n\nIn addition to deconjugating Ub, MERS- and SARS-CoV PLpro also recognize\nthe antiviral Ubl molecule ISG15 (16, 17). In the absence of a crystal structure of a\nDUB from the USP family in complex with ISG15, it is difficult to predict which\nregions of PLpro may be specifically responsible for ISG15 binding.\nHowever, it is interesting to note that both the palm and fingers domains of the\nSARS-CoV PLpro domain (62) and the\ncellular USP21 (57), respectively, have been\nimplicated in ISG15 recognition, probably through additional interactions between\nPLpro and the N-terminal Ubl fold of ISG15. Future structural work is\nnecessary to identify the specific determinants of ISG15 recognition by MERS-CoV\nPLpro. Structure-guided mutagenesis of MERS-CoV PLpro to\nselectively disrupt deISGylation without affecting polyprotein cleavage would\nfurther expand our insights into the role of this additional activity in coronaviral\nimmune evasion. The specific removal of DUB and potentially deISGylating activity\nfrom viral proteases that suppress the host innate immune response may open new\navenues to engineer attenuated viruses for use as modified-live virus vaccines."}
