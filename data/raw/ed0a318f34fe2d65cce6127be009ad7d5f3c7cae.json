They replicate on host derived membranous vesicles that are induced 22\n\nfollowing viral infection, the formation of which requires the activity of key membrane 23 bound viral enzymes (Altan-Bonnet, 2017) . Within the membrane bound viral 24 replication complex, translation of the viral genome and the synthesis of new viral 25 RNA occurs in a highly coordinated process. Positive sense RNA viruses have 26 evolved novel gene expression mechanisms that enable them to overcome the 27 genome size limitations that accompany error-prone replication and which might 28 restrict their overall coding capacity (Firth and Brierley, 2012) . In addition, viral 29 modification of the host cell translation machinery often provides a competitive 30 advantage allowing for the efficient translation of viral RNA in an environment where 31 competing cellular RNAs are in abundance (McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017) . 32\n\nThis ability to compete with cellular RNAs is particularly important for the initiation of 33 infection where the incoming viral genome may be present at only a single copy per 34 cell. 35\n\nWe have previously described a novel paradigm of viral translation that relies on the 36 interaction of host translation initiation factors with a virus-encoded protein (VPg), 37 covalently linked to the 5' end of the genome of members of the Caliciviridae family 38 of positive sense RNA viruses (Chaudhry et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2014; 39 7 positions were previously identified using a transposon based mutagenesis screen 115 as sites that tolerate insertions, without compromising virus viability (Thorne et al., 116 2012) . Our approach was somewhat analogous to that recently published for 117 coronaviruses (V'kovski et al., 2019) but instead used stable isotope labelling of 118 permissive cells and the FLAG affinity purification tag rather than proximity labelling. 119\n\nUnlabelled or stable isotope labelled highly permissive BV-2 microglial cells were 120 infected with either wild type MNV or the equivalent virus carrying the FLAG epitope 121 purification tag in either NS1/2 or NS4, and the viral replication complex was purified. 122\n\nThe experiment was performed three times by swapping the labelled derivatives of 123 arginine and lysine as described in the materials and methods. Silver stain of the 124 purified complexes confirmed the presence of the bait proteins, with both the 125 uncleaved and cleaved forms of NS1/2 and NS2 being highly enriched ( Fig 2B) . As 126 expected, complexes purified from NS1/2-Flag virus infected cells co-purified 127 untagged NS4 and vice versa (Fig 2B) , as we have previously shown these proteins 128 to interact to form a complex (Thorne et al., 2012) . Western blot analysis of the 129 purified complexes confirmed that viral non-structural and structural proteins were 130 specifically enriched in the purified complexes, including NS5 (VPg)-containing 131 8 proteins identified using NS1/2 and NS4 (Spearman correlation of 0.8832), fitting 140 with our prior knowledge that both proteins form a complex during viral replication 141 (Thorne et al., 2012) . Ontology analysis indicated that proteins involved in vesicle 142 transport and fatty acid metabolism were significantly enriched ( Fig S2 and Table  143 S3), fitting with previous observations that the viral replication complex is associated 144 with cytoplasmic membranous structures (Cotton et al., 2017; Hyde and Mackenzie, 145 2010; Hyde et al., 2009) . Several host proteins previously identified in a variety of 146 biochemical and genetic screens were enriched ( Fig S2 and Table S3 ) providing 147 additional confidence that the approach identified biologically relevant interactions. 148\n\nWe noted that the VapA and the paralogue VapB, which we have recently identified 149 as binding to the NS1/2 protein (McCune et al., 2017) , were both highly enriched. 150\n\nComparison with the data obtained using VPg as a bait protein (Fig 1) showed some 151 degree of overlap, however it is worth noting that most of the factors that were 152 identified using VPg were enriched by >2 fold using only the NS1/2 tagged virus and 153 not the NS4 tagged virus (Fig S2) . One of the exceptions to this was the core stress 154 granule protein G3BP1, which was enriched by both MNV and NV VPg proteins, and 155 was also enriched in complexes purified using both NS1/2 and NS4-tagged viruses. 156 9\n\nIn addition, to minimise the impact of gRNAs that may have deleterious effects on 164 long term cell viability and to increase our ability to detect genes that may be 165 important, but not essential, for norovirus-induced cell death, the infection was 166 reduced to 24 hours as compared to 2-10 days post infection in previous studies. 167 BV-2-Cas9 expressing cells were infected with lentiviruses carrying the Brie gRNA 168 library carrying 78,637 independent guide RNAs to 19,674 genes (Doench et al., 169 2016) . The transduced cells were then infected with two MNV strains, CW3 and 170 CR6, which cause acute and persistent infections in immunocompetent mice 171 respectively (Nice et al., 2012; Thackray et al., 2007) , and guide RNA abundance 172 compared to mock infected cells at 24 hours post infection as illustrated in Fig 3A. 173 being negatively selected (Fig 3B) , whereas for MNV-CW3 279 and 19 genes were 179 positively and negatively selected respectively ( Fig 3B) . In most cases, there was a 180 clear correlation between the datasets obtained using either strain ( Fig 3C) . STARS 181 analysis was used to ranks genes with positive and negative values (Table S4 ). In 182 both screens, the MNV receptor Cd300lf was the most highly positively selected 183 gene identified, in agreement with previous reports (Haga et al., 2016; Orchard et al., 184 2016) . The second most highly enriched gene was G3BP1, a gene also identified in 185 one of the two previous CRISPR screens performed on norovirus infected cells 186 . 187 10 A comparison of the data obtained from all three approaches allowed us to identify 189 several host proteins that were common to all screens (Table S5) . G3BP1, the core 190 stress granule component was identified in all three screens as a potential host 191 factor essential for norovirus infection. G3BP1 was found to be associated with the 192 MNV and NV VPg proteins (Fig 1D) , enriched in viral replication complexes purified 193 using either NS1/2 or NS4 flag tagged viruses ( Fig 2D) and identified in a CRISPR 194 screen using two different MNV strains as a putative pro-viral factor involved in the 195 norovirus life cycle ( Fig 3C) . 196\n\nTo validate the importance of G3BP1 in the norovirus life cycle we generated G3BP1 199 deficient BV-2 cell lines ( Fig 4A) and examined the impact of G3BP1 ablation on 200 MNV infection. Western blotting confirmed the loss of G3BP1 in the three lines 201 tested and we noted that at in some cases, a concomitant increase in G3BP2 202 expression was observed as has been previously noted (Kedersha et al., 2016) . A 203 clear defect was observed in the ability to replicate to produce infectious virus in 204 three independently selected \u0394G3BP1 cell lines ( Fig 4B) . This effect was mirrored by 205 an inability to induce cytopathic effect leading to virus-induced cell death ( Fig 4C) . In 206 contrast, the ability of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) to infect and cause cell 207 death was unaffected by the deletion of G3BP1( Fig 4C) . These data confirm that 208 cells lacking G3BP1 are highly resistant to norovirus infection. To determine if the G3BP1 was also essential for HuNoV, we examined the impact 212 of loss of G3BP1 on human norovirus replication in cell culture using the Norwalk 213 virus replicon. To establish the experimental system, we first confirmed that the 214 presence of VPg on the 5' end of the Norwalk RNA was essential for the replication 215 of the replicon RNA and for the capacity to form G418 resistant colonies. 216\n\nTransfection of replicon RNA, purified from replicon containing cells, into BHK cells 217 readily resulted in the formation of antibiotic resistant cell colonies ( Fig 5A) . In 218 contrast, RNA that was proteinase K treated prior to transfection was unable to 219 produce replicon containing colonies. Transfection of replicon RNA into wild type 220 U2OS osteosarcoma cells allowed the formation of replicon-containing colonies, 221 although the efficiency of formation was significantly less than that seen in BHK cells 222 ( Fig 5B) . CRISPR modified U2OS cells that lacked G3BP1 (Kedersha et al., 2016) 223 were unable to support NV replication, as evident by the lack of antibiotic resistant 224 colonies ( Fig 5B) . To further examine the role of G3BP1 in human Norwalk virus 225 replication, WT or G3BP1 deficient U2OS cells were transfected with NV replicon 226\n\nVPg-linked RNA, and RNA synthesis monitored overtime following the addition of 227 G418. While a significant increase in NV viral RNA levels was seen in WT U2OS 228 cells, those lacking G3BP1 were completely unable to support NV RNA synthesis 229 ( Fig 5C) . These data indicate that like for MNV, G3BP1 is essential for human 230\n\nThe RNA-binding domain of G3BP1 is required for its function in the norovirus 233 life cycle. 234\n\nTo confirm the role of G3BP1 in the norovirus life cycle we examined the ability of full 235 length and truncated versions of G3BP1 to restore norovirus replication in G3BP1 236 knockout cells. A mouse BV-2 G3BP1 knockout cell line was complemented with 237 either full length G3BP1 or variants lacking the RGG or both the RGG and RRM 238 binding domains ( Fig 6A) and the impact on viral replication assessed. 239\n\nComplementation with full length murine G3BP1 restored the ability of MNV to 240 induce cell death ( Fig 6B) and to produce infectious virus ( Fig 6C) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/571455 doi: bioRxiv preprint 13 detected in either of the \u0394G3BP1 cell lines suggesting a defect at a very early stage 259\n\nin the viral life cycle (Fig 7C) . Transfection of VPg-linked RNA into the \u0394G3BP1 cell 260 lines reconstituted with WT G3BP1 restored the ability to produce infectious virus 261 ( Fig 7B) and the production of viral proteins (Fig 7D) . A minor increase in viral 262 infectivity was observed in the \u0394G3BP1 cell line reconstituted with the \u0394RGG 263 construct producing viral titres that were higher than those obtained from the WT 264 complemented line in the presence of 2CMC, suggesting low levels of viral 265 replication ( Fig 7B) . However, the levels of viral proteins produced in this line was 266 below the limit of detection by western blot (Fig 7D) . These data confirm that G3BP1 267 is required for a post entry stage of the norovirus life cycle and that in the absence of 268 G3BP1 only residual norovirus replication is observed. 269\n\nTo define the precise role of G3BP1 in the early stages of the virus life cycle, we 272 used strand-specific RT-qPCR to quantify the levels of viral positive and negative 273 sense RNA in WT and \u0394G3BP1 cell lines following infection with MNV. As a control, 274 2CMC was included following virus inoculation as illustrated in the experimental time 275 line ( Fig 8A) . The production of viral positive sense RNA was reduced to background 276 levels in the absence of G3BP1, comparable to levels observed when the 2CMC was 277 present during the infection (Fig 8B) . Viral negative sense RNA synthesis was also 278 reduced to below the detection limit of the assay in \u0394G3BP1 cell lines ( Fig 8C) . 279\n\nSurprisingly, we were able to detect an ~5 fold increase in viral negative sense RNA 280 production at 6 hours post infection of WT cells in the presence of 2CMC, which, 281 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/571455 doi: bioRxiv preprint given that 2CMC was added after the inoculation phase (Fig 8B) , likely represents 282 the first round of viral negative sense RNA synthesis, confirming the sensitivity of the 283 assay. Addition of 2CMC during the inoculation phase reduced this background 284 levels (data not shown). 285\n\nSimilar results were obtained following transfection of viral RNA into cells to bypass 286 the entry phase; viral positive and negative sense RNA synthesis was near (or 287 below) the sensitivity of the assay following transfection of viral VPg-linked RNA into 288 two independent \u0394G3BP1 cell lines ( presence of low levels of viral infectivity ( Fig 7B) . This discrepancy likely reflects the 293 relative sensitivities of the assays and the nature of the strand specific qPCR assay 294 which requires low levels of RNA input to maintain strand specificity. Together these 295 data suggest that the function of G3BP1 is prior to, or at the level of viral negative 296 sense RNA synthesis, with the most logical steps being either viral RNA translation 297 or the formation of viral replication complexes. 298 299 G3BP1 is required for the association of VPg with 40S ribosomal subunits. 300\n\nWe have previously shown that norovirus VPg interacts with eIF4G to recruit 301 ribosomal subunits and direct viral translation (Chaudhry et al., 2006; Chung et al., 302 2014) . The interaction between VPg and eIF4G occurs via a direct interaction 303 between the highly conserved C-terminal region in VPg and the central HEAT 304 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/571455 doi: bioRxiv preprint domain of eIF4G (Leen et al., 2016) and does not require any additional cellular 305 cofactors, at least in vitro. The interaction between the eIF4G HEAT domain and the 306 eIF3 complex plays a central role in the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit for 307 translation initiation (Marcotrigiano:2001uq; Kumar et al., 2016; Villa et al., 2013) . 308\n\nOur proteomics analysis also confirms that the norovirus VPg proteins form a 309 complex that contains multiple components of the 40S subunit ( Fig 1D) and it has 310 been established previously that G3BP1 associates with 40S subunits (Kedersha et 311 al., 2016) . To assess a potential role for G3BP1 in the formation of VPg-driven 312 translation complexes in cells, we examined the ability of GFP tagged version of 313 MNV VPg to pull down 40S subunits in the presence and absence of G3BP1. GFP-314 tagged WT MNV VPg was readily able to pull down eIF4G, G3BP1 and RpS6, a 315 component of the 40S subunit ( Fig 9A) . However, in the absence of G3BP1, the 316 ability to pull down RpS6 was lost ( Fig 9A) . Furthermore, we found that disruption of 317 the VPg-eIF4G interaction by the introduction of the F123A mutation into the eIF4G 318 binding domain, also significantly reduced the ability to pull down RpS6 (Fig 9B) . 319\n\nThese data suggest that the interaction of VPg with eIF4G is important for complex 320 formation with ribosomal proteins and that that G3BP1 contributes in some manner 321 to the formation of this complex.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/571455 doi: bioRxiv preprint capacity of the incoming parental viral RNA to assemble into translationally active 329 complexes, a stage often referred to as the \"maiden round\" of RNA virus genome 330 translation. To this aim, cells were infected with MNV in the presence of 2CMC and 331 polysomes profiling on extracts prepared from cells at 4 and 9 hours post infection 332 performed (Fig 10A) . Quantification of the viral RNA levels in cells in the presence of 333 2CMC confirmed that the absence of G3BP1 has no impact on the overall levels 334 present at the time points examined (data not shown). We noted that even in the 335 presence of 2CMC, which inhibits viral RNA synthesis, there was a small but 336 measurable increase in free 80S ribosomes over time in WT cells but not in cells 337 lacking G3BP1 (Fig 10A) . We have previously found that MNV infection results in 338 translation shut off and that this effect is at least partuialkly due to the activity of the 339 NS6 protease (Emmott et al., 2017) . The fact we observed 80S accumulation in WT 340 cells, even in the absence of viral RNA synthesis, but not in cells lacking G3BP1, 341\n\nindirectly lead us to suspect that translation of viral RNA had occurred in WT cells, 342 but was much less efficient in cells lacking G3BP1. Further analyses indicated that 343 while most ribosome-associated norovirus RNA in WT cells was found in polysomes 344 containing fractions, less viral RNA was found in ribosome-containing fractions (1-12 345\n\nin Fig 10A & B) in the absence of G3BP1 cells and, in comparison to WT cells, very 346 little viral RNA was found in fractions containing polysomes ( Fig 10B) . Extending the 347 fractionation to include the free RNA and ribonucleoprotein complexes at the top of 348 each gradient confirmed that in the absence of G3BP1 norovirus RNA is less 349 efficient at assembling into polysomal fractions, suggesting a defect at the level of 350 viral protein synthesis ( Fig 10C) . Together these data support the hypothesis that 351 prepared from WT and \u0394G3BP1 cell lines (Fig 11A) , whereas norovirus VPg-362 dependent translation was reduced ( Fig 11B) . Quantification of multiple experiments 363 indicated that translation in nuclease treated extracts was on average reduced by 364 ~40-50% because of G3BP1 ablation (Fig 11C) . A similar reduction in in vitro 365 translation was observed across multiple time points (Fig S11C) . 366\n\nThe ability of VPg-linked norovirus RNA to be translated in the presence of 368 increasing amounts of total cellular RNAs was then examined to assess the relative 369 role of G3BP1 under conditions where cellular RNA are present. Total RNA isolated 370 from uninfected cells was titrated into the nuclease treated extracts and the impact 371 norovirus VPg-dependent translation examined ( Fig 11D) . We found that in the 372 presence of cellular RNAs, the translation of norovirus VPg-linked RNA in extracts 373 from \u0394G3BP1 cells is reduced by up to 80% in comparison to extracts from WT cells. 374\n\nIn agreement with our data using polysome profiling, these data suggest that G3BP1 375 functions to provide a competitive advantage for norovirus VPg-linked RNA under 376\n\nconditions where cellular RNAs are present. 377 .

Our combined approaches 381 resulted in the identification of the core stress granule component G3BP1 as a host 382 protein critical for the replication of both murine and human noroviruses in cell 383 culture. Furthermore, we determined that G3BP1 plays a key role in the processes of 384 norovirus VPg-dependent protein synthesis, uncovering a new function for G3BP1 in 385 facilitating RNA virus genome translation. 386\n\nThe orthogonal approaches used in the current study provide an unprecedented 387 insight into the identity of host factors with potential roles in the norovirus life cycle. 388\n\nThe detailed proteomic analysis of the viral replication and translation complexes 389 formed during MNV infection (Fig 2) resulted in the identification of several host 390 factors with previously identified roles in the MNV life cycle. We focused our efforts 391 on G3BP1 as it was identified in all three approaches and was also identified in a 392 CRISPR screen published during this study . Furthermore, we 393 have previously shown that feline calicivirus (FCV), a relative of noroviruses within 394 the Vesivirus genus, cleaves G3BP1 to inhibit stress granule formation (Humoud et 395 al., 2016) . In contrast, MNV infection does not result in G3BP1 cleavage and instead 396 forms cytoplasmic foci the composition of which is distinct from canonical stress 397 granules (Brocard et al., 2018) . 398 G3BP1 is one member of a group of G3BP proteins (Ras-GTPase-activating protein 399 (SH3 domain)-binding proteins), referred to as Rasputin in insects, that possess 400 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/571455 doi: bioRxiv preprint RNA binding activity and have multiple cellular functions including the regulation of 401 RNA stability and translation in response to stress. Originally identified as a protein 402 that interacted with Ras-GTPase activating protein (RasGAP), more than two 403 decades of research have significantly expanded our knowledge of the 404 multifunctional role in cellular processes. It is now well accepted that G3BPs play a 405 role in cancer cell survival, cancer metastasis and invasion, processing of specific 406 miRNAs and stress granule formation (Reviewed in (Alam and Kennedy, 2019) . 407\n\nStress granules are dynamic cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes that form 408 rapidly under stress conditions and within which cellular RNAs are stored in stalled 409 translation complexes (Protter and Parker, 2016) . In the context of viral infection, 410\n\nnumerous studies have suggested that many, if not all, viruses must interact in some 411 manner with stress granules as there is growing evidence that the formation of 412 cytoplasmic stress granules is part of the antiviral defence mechanism (Reviewed in 413 (McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017) . Some viruses interact with stress granules to 414 promote viral replication (Cristea et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2016; Panas et al., 2014; 415 2012) whereas some do so to counteract the inhibitory effect of stress granules on 416 the translation of viral RNA (Panas et al., 2015; White et al., 2007) . 417\n\nOur data suggests that G3BP1 plays a key role in promoting the translation of 418 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/571455 doi: bioRxiv preprint 20 G3BP1 is known to associate primarily with free 40S subunits and not 80S 426 monosomes (Kedersha et al., 2016) . Our data supports a hypothesis whereby the 427 association of G3BP1 with 40S ribosomal subunits provides a selective advantage 428 for norovirus VPg-dependent translation, thereby uncovering a new function in virus 429 specific translation. The mechanism by which G3BP1 contributes to this process has 430 yet to be fully explored but our data supports the hypothesis that G3BP1 directly or 431\n\nindirectly promotes the recruitment of 40S ribosomal subunits to VPg-driven 432 translation complexes. The RGG motif of G3BP1 is known to be essential for the 433 association between G3BP1 and 40S subunits as well as the ability to from stress 434 granules, whereas data would suggest that the RRM may play a regulatory role 435 (Kedersha et al., 2016) . These domains were also required for the function of G3BP1 436 in the norovirus life cycle (Fig 6) confirming that the G3BP1 association with 40S is 437 important for its role in promoting norovirus VPg-dependent translation. Importantly, 438 RGG domains are known to have many functions (Thandapani et al., 2013) and 439 therefore in the context of G3BP1 function in the norovirus life cycle, may also 440 contribute to unknown interactions that promote norovirus translation. Previous work 441 on alphaviruses have shown that G3BP1 is sequestered by binding to the nsP3 442 protein (Panas et al., 2012; 2015) . Furthermore, this interaction occurs via an 443 FGDF motif also found in other viral proteins including the ICP8 protein of herpes 444 simplex virus (Panas et al., 2015) . While the MNV VPg protein has a similar motif 445 FGDGF (Fig 1A) , this motif is not conserved in the GI Norwalk virus VPg protein. 446\n\nTherefore our data suggest that the interaction of VPg with G3BP1 is not direct, 447 fitting with our observation that this interaction is reduced by mutations in the eIF4G 448 binding domain (Fig 1A and Fig 9B. ) While our data fit with a primary role for G3BP1 449 in norovirus translation, we are unable to exclude the possibility that G3BP1 plays 450 . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. VPg-containing complexes again fits with our hypothesis that G3BP1 plays a role in 460 promoting viral VPg-dependent protein synthesis. 461\n\nWe have previously found that norovirus infection leads to a translation bias whereby 462 cellular mRNAs induced in response to infection are inefficiently translated (Emmott 463 et al., 2017) . Our data suggested that this modification of host cell translation was at 464 least partially driven by the ability of the viral NS6 protease to cleave PABP and the 465 induction of apoptosis which results in cleavage of cellular translation initiation 466 factors (Emmott et al., 2017) . Furthermore, we have more recently shown that the 467 ability of the protease to cleave PABP and other substrates is controlled by 468 polyprotein processing and interactions with other viral proteins (Emmott et al., 469 2019) . Recent work would agree with our observations and confirms that the 470 translational bias is not driven by phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and that activation of 471 GCN2 leads to the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (Brocard et al., 2018) . We note however 472 that others have suggested that NS3 may contribute to translational shut off (Fritzlar 473 et al., 2019) , with the caveat that this observation was made outside of the context of 474 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/571455 doi: bioRxiv preprint 22 infected cells and using overexpressed tagged proteins.\n\nWe suspect that 475 noroviruses use multiple mechanisms that work co-operatively to enable the control 476 of host gene expression and the subsequent translation of the cellular mRNAs. The 477 relative contribution of these processes in any given cell type may also differ 478 depending on the degree to which the cells can sense and respond to viral infection 479 through the induction of innate and apototic responses. 480\n\nThe observation that many of the factors enriched using the VPg protein were only 481 enriched on complexes purified with NS1/2 tagged infectious MNV, could suggest 482 that the viral proteins present in the viral translation complex are distinct from those 483 present in complexes active for viral RNA synthesis. However, we cannot formally 484 rule out other possible explanations including the possibility that the specific 485 enrichment of translation factors on NS1/2 occurs because NS1/2 is the first protein 486 to be translated from ORF1, therefore unprocessed NS1/2 at the N-terminus of the 487 ORF1 polyprotein being actively translated could function as an anchor, facilitating 488 the enrichment of ribosomes and the associated factors. In addition, we have 489 previously seen that VPg-containing precursors may bind the translation initiation 490 factor eIF4G less well (Leen et al., 2016) , which could prevent some VPg (NS5) 491 containing precursors associating with translation initiation complexes. 492\n\nIn conclusion, our data adds significantly to the growing body of literature on the role 493 of G3BP proteins in the life cycle of viruses and further extends the functional roles 494 of G3BP1 to include the promotion of viral translation processes. We identify G3BP1 495 as a host protein that has a critical role in the life cycle of murine and human 496 noroviruses, identifying the first cellular pro-viral protein with pan-norovirus activity.

The CRISPR screen was performed similarly to that described 774\n\npreviously with a number of modifications that included the use 775 of the Brie gRNA library to reduce off target effects and shorter 776 infection times to improve the recovery of gRNAs that may also compromise cell 777 viability. BV-2 cells stably expressing Cas9 nuclease were 778 transduced with the Brie library using previously described protocols (Doench et al., 779 2016) . MNV strains CW3 and CR6 were used to infect BV-2 CRISPR library at MOI 780 5 pfu/cell and cells were isolated 24 hours post infection and preparation of gDNA 781 for sequencing as described previously . The screen relies on 782 the premise that guide RNAs targeting genes that are overrepresented following 783 infection represent genes that when disrupted are protected against infection and 784 therefore likely represent factors with pro-viral activity. Likewise, genes for which 785 guide RNA are underrepresented suggest that infection had proceeded faster and 786 the gene is antiviral. Following sequencing, the data was analyzed by STARS 787 method as previously described Orchard et al., 2016) .

SILAC media were supplemented with Light (R0K0), 796\n\nLaboratories). BV-2 cells were maintained in SILAC medium for 2 weeks to ensure 798 complete metabolic labelling of proteins. Labelling of HEK-293T cells was performed 799 essentially as described for BV-2 cells, with the omission of 10 mM HEPES and 1X 800 non-essential amino acids from the cell culture media. 801 802 DNA based recovery of murine norovirus. Experiments were performed according 803 to previously published protocols (Chaudhry et al., 2007) . Briefly, BSRT7 cells were 804 infected to an MOI of 0.5-1 PFU/cell with fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA 805 polymerase. Cells were then transfected with a plasmid encoding the MNV full length 806 clone, or a derivative thereof (e.g. pT7 MNV 383FLAG 3'Rz or pT7 MNV 2600FLAG 807 3'Rz, our FLAG-tagged virus constructs containing FLAG tags in either NS1/2 or 808 NS4 respectively). MNV was harvested by freeze-thaw at 24h post-transfection. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

FLAG immunoprecipitations were 845 performed following the manufacturer's protocol (FLAG M2 beads, Sigma Aldrich) as 846 described (Thorne et al., 2012) . In brief, protein concentration in lysates was 847 normalized using BCA. Lysates were then diluted with 1 volume of wash buffer (10 848 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA). Equal volumes of anti-FLAG 849 affinity gel were dispensed into either WT infected cell lysates, or lysates of cells 850 infected with NS1/2-FLAG or NS4-FLAG. Binding was carried out overnight at 4 o C 851 with rotation. After binding, beads were washed 3 times with wash buffer. All liquid 852 was carefully removed from each tube, before boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer 853 for 10 minutes. GFP-trap immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged VPg was 854 accomplished using GFP-trap beads (Chromotek) per the manufacturer's protocol, 855 as described . RNase cocktail (Ambion) was also 856 included in the lysis buffer at a concentration of 5 \u03bcl/ml to prevent non-specific 857 interactions mediated by RNA. In all cases, light, medium, and heavy-labelled 858 proteins eluted from the beads for each experimental replicate were pooled together 859 in a ratio of 1:1:1 before submission for mass spectrometry analysis at the University 860 of Bristol Proteomics Facility. 861 862 Mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed at the 863 University of Bristol Proteomics Facility. In brief, samples were run into precast SDS-864 PAGE gels for 5 minutes, the entire sample cut from the gel as a single band, and 865 then subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion including reduction and alkylation using a 866\n\nProGest automated digestion unit. The resulting peptides were fractionated using a 867\n\nDionex Ultimate 3000 nanoHPLC system in line with an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos or 868\n\nOrbitrap Tribrid Fusion mass spectrometer. 869 .
