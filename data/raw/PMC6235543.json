{"title": "Evaluation of Zika Virus-specific T-cell Responses in Immunoprivileged Organs of Infected Ifnar1-/- Mice", "body": "The ZIKV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was first isolated in 1947 in Uganda from a febrile rhesus macaque. Recently, the ZIKV has become a public health emergency, due to its rapid dissemination in the Americas and its unexpected link to microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome123. From epidemiological data, the ZIKV has been suspected to be the cause of the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in around 1 per 4,000 infected adults4. Moreover, a correlation between the ZIKV and testes infection/damage in the mouse model has been demonstrated, suggesting that the ZIKV infection, under certain circumstances, can bypass the blood-testis barrier and eventually lead to male infertility5. These findings highlight the importance of completely understanding the induction of protective or pathologic immune responses during a ZIKV infection.\n\nMuch remains to be learned about the cellular immune responses to the ZIKV. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to the capsid, envelope, and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) have been observed in ZIKV-infected monkeys and humans678. In mice, several studies have indicated that CD8+ T cells play a protective role in controlling the ZIKV replication91011. Importantly, Jurado et al. demonstrated that a ZIKV infection results in the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and perivascular infiltration of CD8+ effector T cells within the testes of Ifnar1-/- mice. Furthermore, they showed that CD8+ T cells instigate ZIKV-associated paralysis and appear to play a role in the neonatal brain immunopathology. In a previous study, we prepared the ZIKV-E294-302 tetramer and showed that ZIKV-specific CD8+ T cells exist in the brains and spinal cords of ZIKV-infected Ifnar1-/- mice, which may have important implications for the design and development of ZIKV vaccines10.\n\nIn response to the urgent need for vaccination to prevent ZIKV infection, several vaccines are in the preclinical stages of development, including RNA vaccines, recombinant vector-based vaccines, and purified protein subunit vaccines. The plasmid DNA vaccine is in phase 1 clinical trials12. The evaluation of safety and efficacy of ZIKV vaccines is, therefore, important. One advantage of the vaccines is their ability to elicit specific T-cell responses, which may be important for protection against the ZIKV. By using ZIKV-derived T-cell epitope-related tetramers, the T-cell immunoreactivity induced by an adenovirus-vector-based ZIKV vaccine could be detected in immunized mice, and both M and E glycoproteins were shown to induce robust antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell immunoreactivity13.\n\nDuring a virus infection, the recognition of peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to the T-cell receptor (TCR) is an important T-cell-mediated mechanism for protecting the host14. Based on this theory, tetramer technology is a unique tool to elucidate the roles that antigen-specific T cells play in regulating the immune responses15. This protocol describes the establishment of the Ifnar1-/- mouse model for ZIKV infections, and the detection of reactive T cells in the spleen, brain, and testes of the mice by using tetramer technology. Additionally, we used the ZIKV-E294-302 tetramer to detect and evaluate T-cell immunoreactivity induced by a ZIKV vaccine (AdC7-M/E) in immunized mice. This study provides guidance for investigating T-cell responses in immunoprivileged organs and provides a reference for the potential applications in the placenta or fetal brain.\n\nNOTE: The isolation of the monocytes from the spleen is described as mentioned previously16.\n\nFollowing these methods, we have developed a murine model for ZIKV infections. Ifnar1-/- mice at 6\u20138 weeks of age were infected with 1 x 104 focus-forming units (FFU) of the ZIKV by retroorbital injection. Pathological symptoms and signs (Figure 1A), as well as weight changes (Figure 1B), were observed in the Ifnar1-/- mice after an infection with the ZIKV. The murine brains showed obvious edema and hyperemia (Figure 1C). Meanwhile, the testes shrank gradually (Figure 1D). Furthermore, pathological changes and the destruction of tissue were found in the brain and testes (Figure 2A). We performed an immunofluorescence assay to detect the ZIKV in the brain and testes (Figure 2B). High viral loads were detected in the brain and testis by immunostaining (Figure 2B). Immunohistochemistry showed a robust infiltration of CD3+ T cells into the mice brain after the infection with the ZIKV (Figure 2C).\n\nTo detect and evaluate ZIKV-specific T-cell responses, we prepared a mouse MHC-I H-2Db-E294-302 tetramer. The peptide E294-302 can help the H-2Db renature properly and yield a high amount of the soluble MHC-I (Figure 3A). In the shift assay, a high efficiency in biotinylation could be observed (Figure 3B). Subsequently, three streptavidin fluorescence (APC, PE, and BV421)-tagged pMHC-I tetramers were produced to detect ZIKV-specific T cells (Figure 3C). The PE-labeled tetramer had a higher efficacy to detect the specific CD8+ T cell compared to the APC- and BV421-labeled tetramers, though the difference was not statistically significant.\n\nUsing the E294-302 tetramer, we detected ZIKV-specific T lymphocytes in the spleen of the infected mice by flow cytometry at 7 d post-inoculation of the ZIKV (3.49 \u00b1 0.45%). Also, similar to the method described in section 3 of this protocol, with 4 weeks post-immunization of AdC7-M/E vaccine, ZIKV-specific T lymphocytes were detected in the spleen (6.89 \u00b1 1.36%) (Figure 4).\n\nFurthermore, we detected the lymphocytes infiltrated into the immunoprivileged organs, such as the brain and testes, after the ZIKV infection. The gates were set to select for CD3+CD8+ T cells in total lymphocytes of the brain and testes. A high ratio of the E294-302 tetramer-specific T cells could be detected in the brain (42.2% in CD3+CD8+ T cells) and the testicular (26.4% in CD3+CD8+ T cells) lymphocytes (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 1: Characterization of the ZIKV infection in Ifnar1-/- mice.

Ifnar1-/- mice at 6-8 weeks of age were either infected with 104 focus-forming units (FFU) of ZIKV or received a single-dose of 4 x 1010 viral particles of AdC7-M/E or PBS as a negative control. After 7 days post-infection or 4 weeks post-vaccination, mouse splenocytes were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. The data are shown as mean \u00b1 SD.

Thus, the detection of ZIKV-specific T cells in immunoprivileged organs is a critical methodology to understand T-cell responses against the natural ZIKV infection. Meanwhile, T-cell response detection is an excellent tool to investigate the efficacy of the viral vaccine. Here, we show a comprehensive protocol to visualize the experiments, which include the isolation of lymphocytes from the spleen, brain, and testes of ZIKV-infected mice, the preparation of the immunodominant epitope E294-302 tetramer, and the recognition of ZIKV-specific CD8+ T cells in immunoprivileged organs of ZIKV-infected mice.\n\nA previous study showed that a live ZIKV or its RNA can be detected in the semen of male patients, which indicates that the ZIKV can bypass the blood-testis barrier and replicate itself in the reproductive system24. Previously, we also showed that the ZIKV can cause testes damage and lead to male infertility in mice25. ZIKV infection can lead to viremia in rhesus monkeys, and the viral RNA can be detected in the central nervous system (CNS), as well as in the visceral organs. Immunohistochemistry revealed that ZIKV-specific antigens were presented in the CNS and the multiple peripheral organs26. Also, in murine models, ZIKV infection can induce a robust antiviral CD8+ T-cell response in the spleen and CNS26.\n\nCompared to previous work, this study establishes systematic methods to detect ZIKV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in the brain and testes, which are immunoprivileged sites. It is important to assess the functionality of virus-specific T cells in the immunoprivileged organs of the ZIKV-infected mice. The usage of tetramers to detect ZIKV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in immunoprivileged organs would greatly enhance our understanding of ZIKV infections and their host immune responses. Using E294-302 tetramer, virus-specific T cells in brain and testis can be isolated by flow cytometry, to investigate the cellular mechanisms of the protection and immunopathogenesis during a ZIKV infection. Meanwhile, it is helpful for researchers to investigate further the functions of the CD8+ T cells to control the ZIKV, or to enhance the immunopathogenesis in these organs during ZIKV infection.\n\nTo analyze the antigen-specific murine CD8+ T-cell responses in the immunoprivileged organs, we prepared H-2Db-E294-302 tetramer and detected the CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. Tetramers are a powerful tool to detect antigen-specific T cells. Here, three types of fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin (APC, PE, and BV421) were generated. Although there are no statistically significant differences in the APC-, BV421-, and PE-labeled tetramers for detecting antigen-specific T cells, PE-labeled pMHC-I tetramers yielded the best results. Hence, the PE-labeled tetramer was used throughout this study. Interestingly, based on the PE-labeled H-2Db-E294-302 tetramer, we detected high ratios of antigen-specific T cells in both the brain and testes, which indicate the migration ability of the virus-specific T cells from the blood to immunoprivileged organs.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to the protocol. The H-2Db-E294-302 tetramer is not useful for human T-cell detection, because tetramer detection is dependent on MHC restriction. The screening of immunodominant HLA-restricted peptides is still needed. Besides, retro-orbital infection is effective for a ZIKV infection but might be not a convenient operation for some investigators. Thus, other routes of infection, including peritoneal, subcutaneous, or intravenous, are also recommended.\n\nIn the protocol described here, a critical step is the isolation of monocytes from brain and testis. It is important to acquire high-quality lymphocytes; thus, it is important to pay attention to, for example, the centrifugal speed, the strength of the grinding tissue, and the dissection of the brain and testis tissue. Besides, for tetramer preparation, protease inhibitors (PMSF, pepstatin, leupeptin) are helpful when protecting a protein from being degraded. Therefore, it makes sense to add a protease inhibitor to the refolding buffer and exchange the buffer during the process of the tetramer preparation.\n\nIn conclusion, we present the methods of detecting antigen-specific T-cell responses in the immunoprivileged organs of the Ifnar1-/- mouse model for a ZIKV infection. This platform can be widely applied to investigate the immune mechanisms of emerging and re-emerging viruses which can bypass the barriers between the blood and the immunoprivileged organs. Moreover, this study may pave the way for the future development of candidate vaccines and immunotherapies.\n\nThe authors have nothing to declare."}
