{"title": "", "body": "cytokine generation in neutrophils exposed to physiological stimuli, such as LPS and TNF a. Because the latter are known to activate PI3K in these cells, we investigated whether this pathway also influences cytokine production by neutrophils. Both LPS and TNF a elicited the phosphorylation (ser473) of Akt -the main downstream effector of PI3K. This was blocked in neutrophils pretreated with 10 lMLY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor). Under these conditions, the LPS-and TNF-induced secretion of IL-8, Mip-1 a and Mip-1 b was also significantly impaired. Further investigation showed that LY294002 similarly decreased Mip-1 a and Mip-1 b gene transcription, whereas IL-8 gene transcription and steady-state mRNA levels were unaffected. Accordingly, LY294002 has no impact on NF-j B or C/EBP activation, which are essential for IL-8 transcription. Analysis of deletion mutants of the Mip-1 a and Mip-1 b promoters in human granulocytic PLB-985 cells identified other transcription factors that are potential PI3K targets. We also identified potential translational targets of the PI3K pathway, which may affect the de novo synthesis of inflammatory chemokines. Collectively, these results demonstrate that in human neutrophils, cytokine production is under the control of the PI3K pathway, which selectively controls the transcription of some cytokine genes, and also seems to affect cytokine production post-transcriptionally. Given the importance of neutrophils and their products in numerous chronic inflammatory disorders, the PI3K pathway could eventually represent an attractive therapeutic target. The innate immune response provides the first line of defense foreign pathogen infection by responding to by-products of infection. Certain RNA viruses, such as influenza virus, produce double-stranded RNA as an intermediate during the replication life cycle which activates proteins capable of inducing an interferon response. By engaging interferon receptors, interferon activates the JAK-STAT pathway and results in positive feedback of interferon production, amplifying the innate immune response. To examine how the interferon receptors respond to infection and initiate signaling cascades, we performed influenza virus infections in cells lacking the Type I interferon receptor, the Type II receptor, or both. In the absence of the Type I receptor, we observed increased viral replication, as well as the induction of Stat1, PKR, and TLR3. Furthermore, while cells lacking the Type I receptor exhibited a decreased interferon response, inflammatory response signaling was similar to cells containing the receptor. These results indicate that the cells are producing Type I interferon and that its receptor is needed to strengthen the interferon response and curb viral replication. Nevertheless, we show that redundancies exist in the pathway, likely via the Type II receptor, because an inflammatory response is initiated even in the absence of the Type I receptor. This study illustrates yet another way in which the host has evolved to establish several overlapping mechanisms to combat pathogenic infections. Interferons (IFNs) direct innate and acquired immune responses and, accordingly, are used therapeutically to treat a number of diseases, yet the diverse effects they elicit are not fully understood. We have identified the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein as a previously unrecognized component of the IFN response. IFN stimulated an association of PLZF with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to induce a decisive subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Consequently, PLZF-deficient mice had a specific ISG expression defect and as a result were more susceptible to viral infection. This susceptibility correlated with a marked decrease in the expression of the key antiviral mediators and an impaired IFN-mediated induction of natural killer cell function. These results provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of IFN signaling and the induction of innate immunity. Virus-infected cells secrete a broad range of interferon (IFN) subtypes which in turn trigger the synthesis of antiviral factors that confer host resistance. IFN-a , IFN-b and other type I IFNs signal through a common universally expressed cell surface receptor (IFNAR), whereas type III IFN (IFN-k) uses a distinct cell-type-specific receptor complex (IL28R) for signaling. Using mice lacking functional receptors for IFNAR, IL28R, or both, we have recently shown that IFN-k contributes to resistance against influenza A viruses (Mordstein et al., PLoS Pathogens 2008). We now present data indicating that IFN-k also plays an important role in defense against several other human pathogenic viruses infecting the respiratory tract such as influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus and SARS coronavirus. These viruses replicated to significantly higher titers in the lung of mice lacking both IFN receptors than in mice with single IFN receptor defects. Interestingly, Lassa fever virus that also infects via the respiratory tract but primarily replicates in the liver was not affected by the IFN-k receptor defect. We managed to visualize cells expressing functional IL28R complexes in lung and intestinal tract which may account for IFN-k mediated inhibition of virus replication and shedding. The secreted form of IL-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1Ra) is a natural inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 b and therefore plays an important part in the regulation of inflammatory processes. In human monocytes, IFN b induces the production of sIL-1Ra through the activation of PI3K but not of its canonical STAT1 pathway. In this study, we used RNA interference approaches and kinase inhibitors to dissect further the particular signal transduction pathways used by IFN b to trigger sIL-1Ra production in human monocytes. We establish that PI3Kd is the PI3K isoform that controls sIL-1Ra production. Besides, we demonstrate that MEK2 but not MEK1 activity controls sIL-1Ra production in monocytes through an ERK1/2-independent pathway. Our observations suggest that MEK2 and PI3Kd are elements of a common signaling pathway that regulates Akt activation and leads to sIL-1Ra production. Together the present data demonstrate that IFN b induces sIL-1Ra production by using a unique pathway requiring the activation of PI3K d and MEK2. The latter was not functionally redundant with MEK1 in this setting, and ERK1/2 activation was dispensable. Therefore, the induction of sIL-1Ra production by IFN b in human monocytes represents a rare example of a MEK2/PI3Kd pathway, which does not require the activation of ERK1/2."}
