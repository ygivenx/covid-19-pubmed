{"title": "Liberty to Decide on Dual Use Biomedical Research: An Acknowledged Necessity", "body": "When approaching the issue of liberty on dual-use biomedical research, it would be appropriate first to define \u201cdual-use\u201d. This term has been already used in politics and diplomacy to refer to technology which can be used for both peaceful and military aims. It also seems helpful to review how great men and thinkers perceive liberty.\n\nHumanity entered the twenty-first century with considerable achievements in biology and medicine. A stormy development was noted in molecular biology and genetics, biotechnology, genomics, proteomics, nano-technology and signal replication. In health-care, synthesis of life-saving drugs, including hormones (e.g. insulin), development of vaccines, in vitro fertilization, gene manipulation in genetic disorders and insights in patho-physiology of diseases are among the most important achievements that improve the quality and duration of life. However, the shade of so called \u201cdual-use\u201d sometimes appears to creep up behind the scientific research [1\u20134].\n\nIn recent years the problem attracted the attention of scientific societies [5\u20138], research councils [9\u201311] and committees [12], stating the importance of preventive measures against bio-terrorism and creation of appropriate conditions for further development in biomedical research. Many authors provided historical overviews of the threat and its nowadays significance [13\u201315]. Scientists pointed on different aspects: the misbalance in funding [16]; the particular role of industry [17]; the need of a comprehensive analysis of the situation, and especially on defined criteria to recognize dual-use life-sciences research and assessment of balance between the threat and the possibilities for development in science [18\u201320].\n\nDual use biomedical research includes several categories of life-sciences research, where products, equipments or ideas might be malevolently used against people, animals and plants, against progress, and may cause illness, death, panic or disruption in social life. In some countries these items have been already regarded as a priority [7\u201310, 13].\n\nThe term \u201cdual-use biomedical research\u201d in this article will follow the accepted criteria of the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), USA [21\u201325].\n\nBio-medical research of dual use is research which may:enhance the virulence of microorganisms, causing diseasesdiminish the immunity of the hostenhance the transmissibility of the pathogens (enhance the contagiousness)alter (enlarge) the host range of the pathogenrender a vaccine ineffectiveconfer resistance to life-saving antibioticsprevent diagnosis of infection or detection of a pathogenenable:\neventual weaponizationseverity of disease/symptomsmass casualty.\n\n\n\nGoing through the pages of \u201cThoughts and aphorisms\u201d [26], the selection of Liberty funds [27] and the works of philosophers [28\u201331] (Table 1), I find, according the opinion of famous philosophers, politicians, thinkers, writers and men working on culture and human progress, liberty is an understanding the needs of nature, responsibility and capability of action for better.\n\n\n\nHow can we translate liberty of choice while discussing dual-use biomedical research? What should we consider? Probably, we should take into account some recent events, the natural disaster epidemics, the emerging and re-emerging infections, the bio-terrorism and the future of bio-medical research. We should, of course, be guided by the most rational and ethical considerations: what would be the consequences of our action/inaction (the liberty to decide or not) for health, for life on the planet, for our children and for our achievements. In case of an action, how can we be prudent in decision favorable for further developments in life-sciences, but which at the same time should guarantee national security (as liberty is a responsibility).\n\nLet me remind you some recent events.\n\nThe world was shaken by the terrorist attacks on the USA on September 11, 2001, and during October, 2001 when anthrax spores were disseminated in letters in the USA. The terrorist attacks in Spain, the UK, Turkey, Japan and elsewhere in the world have shown clearly the face of a real threat.\n\nRecently, important scientific results, such as the sequenced genomes of particularly pathogenic agents, the \u201cSpanish\u201d influenza virus that caused the pandemic in 1918, the poliomyelitis virus and Bacillus anthracis [32, 33], have been published without taking account the possibility of a potential mis-use. Similarly, gene manipulations on monkeypox virus, resulting in disruption of immunity in the infected mice, were reportrd without preventive measures [34]. Polio viruses have been synthesized in the laboratory (which is a great scientific success) and the results were again reported without precautions [35\u201337].\n\nHowever, we should point out, because of internationally available virus sequencing data and co-operation, the SARS-CoV was identified in 2002 and the epidemic was contained [38].\n\nIt should be emphasized that bioterrorism and dual-use life-sciences research are not recent events. Since antiquity severe infectious diseases have been used during wars against the enemy [39, 40]. At the beginning of twentieth century bio-weapon programs were developed [41, 42].\n\nNatural disaster epidemics have depopulated the world several times [14, 43\u201345]. Most of diseases are zoonoses1 and have not been eradicated [46\u201350]. Smallpox has been eradicated, but could be mis-used for bio-terrorism [14, 45].\n\nWhen discussing several severe pandemic2 infectious diseases, we should emphasise that there is a possibility that they could also be used intentionally (as bio-weapons).\n\nAccording to contemporary knowledge and data analysis, experts consider that bio-weapons will be used as priority weapons for mass casualty, because they are not-expensive, may be easily obtained, could be difficult for recognition and identification, have a huge potential for morbidity, lethality, epidemic dissemination and to cause panic, disruption in society and economic losses [14, 39\u201342]. Laboratory accidents can also represent a significant danger both for the laboratory staff and the society [3, 4, 14].\n\nCDC, Atlanta, recognizes several categories of select agents (viruses, bacteria, fungi, toxins, genetic elements, recombinant nucleic acids, and recombinant organisms) published in alphabetic range in the last edition [51].\n\nLet us focus on several natural disaster pandemics caused by pathogens which may be used as bio-weapons (Table 2). It is considered that the pathogen, when weaponized, may be preferably transmitted via an air-born mechanism. The consequences would be more deadly disease and symptoms that are difficult to associate with a particular disease.\n\n\n\nWhich are the most threatening emerging and re-emerging infections? Some of them are presented in Table 3.\n\n\n\nList of viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic emerging and re-emerging infections is long. We should point out in brief the pulmonary tuberculosis. Tuberculosis, an old disease, considered almost eradicated in developed countries, is re-emerging now with severe variants\u2014multidrug- and extensively-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB and XDR-TB). Pulmonary tuberculosis is typical example of air-born infection and Mycobacterium tuberculosis spreads person to person via nuclei of respiratory tract secretions containing microbes. MDR strains are defined by resistance to isoniazide + rifampicin (two basic anti-tuberculosis drugs), while the XDR-strains are additionally resistant to at least one fluoroquinolon and one second line parenteral drug [64]. The treatment is very difficult, longer and more expensive than treatment of infections with susceptible strains. The resurgence of tuberculosis and the presentation of MDR-TB and XDR-TB is generally associated with non-compliance with treatment, as well as an infection in HIV-infected patients or poverty. There is a BCG vaccine and other vaccines under development. Infection control necessitates air-born isolation with respiratory masks and respirators; and protection of laboratory workers by use of safety cabinets. Aerosol dispersion of MDR- or XDR-TB strains as bioterrorist attack may have significant health-care consequences.\n\nRecognition and clinical diagnosis of first cases by general practitioners, infectious diseases-specialists, emergency department staff and other health-care workers will be critical. Rapid diagnosis is of vital importance for the successful treatment and control of infection. The diagnosis might be difficult, because of unusual illness, typically not considered, the symptoms may differ from the natural appearance because of atypical spread, and the disease might not have been seen in this region previously [51\u201354]. In such situations, several patients with similar symptoms should be considered an outbreak. It is necessary to emphasize that to be successful, the emergency post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment with vaccines and antibiotics respectively, if available, should start immediately since the exposure. In this respect the rapid (real-time microbiological diagnosis/identification of the pathogen is crucial (the development of typical clinical symptoms usually requires more time).\n\nThe Minimum Standards should be designed not to limit bio-medical research and bio-medical researchers, but to ensure secure measures to protect them.\n\nThe Standards should approve the Code of Conduct of scientists and put it in action; they should support introduction of appropriate security measures at each stage of biomedical research, and for particular type of facility/institution, starting with laboratories performing work at biosecurity level 4 (dealing with the most contagious agents, without reliable specific prophylaxis and therapy) and through academic, university-, hospital-, industry, governmental and private-, civil and military-facilities. In this regard, the institutional scientific/ethics committees should be given more rights and powers to perform responsible evaluation of projects (as well as of new personnel).\n\nThe Minimum Standards should consist of most important rules and guidelines for their implementation; they may be specialized upon human/animal/plant-pathogens/diseases\u2014from one hand, and advanced DNA- and other technologies, from the other, and could be accepted as official legislation. Preliminary negotiations with official countries agencies, scientific organizations and individual scientists may be necessary steps in rising awareness, promoting discussions and compliance.\n\nThe secure measures aim to protect both life-sciences research and society against malevolent use of scientific ideas, methods, products, equipments, tests, materials. Appropriate basis, when preparing the Minimum Standards, will be the criteria and other guidelines of NSABB for \u201cdual-use\u201d life-sciences research and the List of \u201cSelect agents\u201d of CDC, Atlanta. The programs by WHO and other organizations to contain emerging and re-emerging diseases provide experience in reference laboratories and centers which may be further developed and included in a global network of surveillance.\n\nSuch type of epidemiologic surveillance is required for the bio-preparedness as a key-bio-defense [14, 69\u201373]. Preparedness to meet the emerging and re-emerging infections, the natural disaster epidemics, or bio-terrorist attacks requires similar organization, complex plans, coordination, adequate infrastructure and financial resources. In the health-care sectors we should consider appropriately equipping hospitals/departments, including intensive care units, microbiology laboratories with possibilities for real-time diagnosis, well educated and appropriately trained personnel, facilities for isolation, quarantine, stocks of drugs and vaccines. Personal protective equipments should be provided for the medical personnel, for people working at front line in the field, such as policemen, firemen and for all people that will take care of the patients etc.\n\nBoth the National Advisory Committee/Board on Science and Bio-security- and the International one- should be multidisciplinary. As it has been already discussed in the beginning, the bio-medical sciences are under extreme development, they become more and more complex and multi-faced: new sub-disciplines appear. The Boards should include experts in both life-sciences (microbiology, virology, infectious diseases, molecular genetics, immunology, bio-technology, bio-signal regulations, nano-technology, veterinary medicine, agriculture, food and water specialists) and in security, defense/military, legislation, internal and external affair officers, a specialist in risks assessment and prognosis, a psychologist, coordinator from government, representatives from foundations and trusts supporting research, journals\u2019 publishers and editors. It would be appropriate the Boards to have lists of consultants to assist them when a particular question in a more-narrow field arises. The Boards should operate quickly and the experts should be in touch. The International Board will have a variety of coordinating functions\u2014with countries with different national and political organization, different culture and particular structure of responsible agencies and different economic development. On the other hand, it would maintain relations with many international organizations, societies and groups\u2014with different profile:\u2014health-care, scientific professional, civil, military, humanitarian, and religious and other kinds of organizations. In this regard it is important that the committee members act not only defending the national interest, but also in favor of common welfare and respect of the principles of ethics and liberty. Organization of such type would be able to cope with some difficulties, already noted in the recent review by Bonin [74].\n\nFigure 1 summarizes the recommended scheme for organizing secure measures in \u201cdual-use\u201d biomedical research.\n\n\n\nIn Conclusion, if we take into account the natural disaster epidemics, the emerging and re-emerging diseases, the huge potential of organisms that may be mis-used as bio-weapons (or may be involved in a laboratory accident), we will see, that the liberty to decide on dual use biomedical research is an acknowledged necessity. In this respect we should continue research implementing preventive measures and develop bio-preparedness at national and international levels. We should create National and International Advisory Boards on Science and Bio-security, to develop the Minimum Standards aimed at secure development in bio-medical research, and give priority to working international projects and programs."}
