{"title": "The Prediction for Development of COVID-19 in Global Major Epidemic Areas Through Empirical Trends in China by Utilizing State Transition Matrix Model", "body": "Since the first case of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, the dreadful epidemic broke out during Dec 2019-Mar 2020 under the pace of Chinese Spring Festival [1] . With the untiring efforts of the people and the selfless dedication of medical staff, a total of 59,897 cured patients were discharged [2] . As of 24:00 on Mar 9, China has accumulated a total of 80,754 confirmed cases (including 4,794 severe cases) and 3136 dead cases [3] . However, in January, when the large-scale outbreak in China began, the disease initiated to spread to other parts of the world [4, 5] . As of Mar 9, a total of 7,382 cases were confirmed in South Korea, 7,375 cases in Italy, and 6,566 cases in Iran [6] .\n\nBased on the previous data, we analyzed the epidemic situation in Hubei Province [12] . After the validation of the model, we were able to analyze the world epidemic trends, and predict the arrival of peaks and IFPs of newly confirmed cases and provide references for NCP prevention and control strategies in various countries.\n\nData from reports, including medical observation, close contacts, confirmed cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases and death data and corresponding information, released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province (HCHP) (Dec 31, 2019 to Feb 8, 2020) were extracted as the training set. Primarily, the arrival of the IFP of new cases and epidemic trends in Hubei were deduced and testified in the validation set, whose data were extracted from HCHP (Feb 9, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020 ). Subsequently, another training set consisting of the data from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (NHC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) were established. Eventually, the data, including cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative cured cases, death data and corresponding information, from NHC and WHO (Mar 6, 2020 to Mar 9 2020) were collected and constructed the validation set. The data period starts from Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 9, 2020. Data is updated on the daily basis. All data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office 2016) and R studio (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The world epidemic situation was performed using the nCov2019 package of R [13] . Histogram was obtained using the ggplot2 packages of R.\n\nState transition matrix (STM) modeling is a well-regarded approach widely applied in clinical decision analysis based on computer simulation. For estimating the IFP of newly confirmed cases and the scale of cumulative cases in the globe in subsequent days, we chose the Markov model cohort simulation.\n\nIn order to estimate the risk metrics (infectivity, severity, lethality) of the NCP, we build a STM model as showing in the figure ( Figure. 1).\n\nWe define the states in this model. Medical Observation (MO) is the close contact of confirmed cases and put into medical observation. In the subsequent days, outcome could be any of the three: confirmed cases, discharged without COVID-19 infection, or stay in MO. Discharge (Disc) is a terminal state for a close contact, until he or she becomes another incident of close contact again. Infected is an intermediate state, where the patient becomes a confirmed infected case. The outcome is binary: severe, or non-severe. And the outcome is revealed immediately. Non-Severe Case (NS) is the patient also has three possible outcomes in the next day: cure, severe case, or stay in non-severe case. Severe Case (S), the patient has three possible outcomes in the next day: critical case, non-severe case, or stay in severe case. Critical Case (Cr), the patient has three possible outcomes in the next day: cured case, severe case, or stay in critical case. Cured Case (Cu) and Death (D) are also the terminal states for the patient. So, at any moment, we can identify the close contact or patient's state by utilizing a state vector, defined as the following:\n\nWhere each element of the vector stands for one state in the same sequentially arranged order as mentioned above. Please note that the comfirmed itself is not an independent state, since the outcome is revealed instantaneously, so we combine confirmed case with Non-Severe, Severe, and Critical cases. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 10.20033670 doi: medRxiv preprint For the sample population, the state vector is defined as the count of people in each state. For example, if there are 100 patients being treated today, out of which 10 are critical, and 90 are severe. The state vector for this sample population is [0 0 0 90 10 0 0]'.\n\nLet's define the STM as the following:\n\nSuppose we have a state vector V(t) for a sample population at time t, how do we predict the state vector V(t+1) in the next day?\n\nApply simple linear algebra, we can get the following equation:\n\nSince the head count of a certain state comes from itself, all other possible transitions into the state (e.g. S has two possible income states, MO and C), minus the outcome states (C, and Cu).\n\nIf we want to predict for N period, the equation becomes the following:\n\nIf the population is limited and the transition matrix is stationary, the above formula will be sufficient in predicting all future outcomes. In our case, the population is not fixed, so we need to introduce the additional input into the population: new close contacts (NCC).\n\nEvery day, new close contacts are added to the medical observation pool, as people already in the pool will gradually be discharged or confirmed of infection.\n\nAlso, we assume NCC will gradually decay as quarantine measures are put into effect.\n\nUsing this STM model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time as well as IFP of newly confirmed cases (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province or non-Hubei will occur. Moreover, after verifying this matrix model in China, it could be utilized to evaluate the world epidemic development especially in the major epidemic areas.\n\nAlthough there is an intermediate state during the above hospitalization: severe cases (the new standard is broken down into mild and normal), critical cases (which can also be divided into general critical and critical), due to the lack of intermediate state transfer probability, we combine the entire hospital period into a in-patient state, for the sake of keeping the model simple. This minimizes the need for only the following five parameters.\n\nIncrement of New Close Contacts (NCC), defined as ln(NCC(t)/NCC(t-1)); Discharge Rate from Medical Observation (MO), defined as Discharged(t)/MO(t-1) Transitional Probability of Medical Observation -> Confirmed cases, defined as Newly confirmed cases (t)/MO(t-1) Transitional Probability of Treatment -> Death, defined as New Death Incidents(t) / Treatment(t-1) Transitional Probability of Treatment -> Cured, defined as New Cured Incidents (t) / Treatment(t-1) In order to estimate the count of open non-severe cases, severe cases, and critical cases, we need three more parameters:\n\nRatio of Non-Severe Cases Ratio of Severe Cases Ratio of Critical Cases All rights reserved.

(Table. 2), which undoubtedly validate the predictive efficacy of this mathematic model.\n\nAs of Mar 5, there were 23,784 confirmed cases, 53,726 cumulative cured cases, 3042 cumulative deaths, 80,552 cumulative confirmed cases, and 670,854 cumulative close contacts in China. Through the analysis, the 5-day moving average (5DMA) and 10-day moving average (10DMA) increment of the confirmed case in Hubei and non-Hubei suggested that the IFP in China was from Feb 6 to Feb 13 ( Figure. 3A and B) . data on Mar 6 and Mar 9, which was validation set, and the results overtly testified the efficacy of this prediction model all in Korean, Italy, and Iran (Table. 3). By utilizing this model, the approximate number of confirmed cases in the three countries at the end of March, April, and May could be predicted (details show in Figure.6 ), which could instruct the international medical resources allocation.\n\nGiven the punchy transmissibility of COVID-19 [15] , isolation and quarantine are undoubtedly the primary options [11] . Subsequently, the model of this epidemic sprouted out a lot. Ziff et al. established a model of death cases and reported that death cases follow three patterns: exponential growth, power-law behavior, and then exponential decline in the daily rate [16] . Nevertheless, deaths are affected by many factors, such as age [17, 18] . More attention should be paid to the number of new cases, and the rate of increment, attributed to the effect of epidemic prevention and control, can be evaluated to guide the date of return to work.\n\nMoreover, we must strictly follow the coping strategy and learn the Chinese model for dealing with NCP outbreaks. Li et al. developed a simple regression model, and based on this model, they estimated that about 34 founder patients outside of China were not observed in the early stage of transmission, and the global trend approximated an exponential increase, tenfold increase in 19 days [19] . This study reproduced the disease's initial spread to the world, yet made no prediction for the future trend, and exponential growth will be curbed immediately after the attention of local governments, and the IFP will come. Milan Batista proposed an estimate of the final size of the COVID-19 epidemic, the logistic growth model and classic susceptible-infected-recovered dynamic model are used to estimate the final size of the coronavirus epidemic, being approximately 83700 (\u00b11300) cases and that the peak of the epidemic was on Feb 9 2020 [20] . However, as of Mar 5, the number of global cases has reached 95,333, and the IFP for growth in South Korea, Italy, and Iran has not yet arrived, which means the global size will be even more colossal.\n\nOur model is based on the fitting of real data from authorities. Through the STM Model, based on data from Hubei and non-Hubei, we predict the IFPs in Korea, Italy, and Iran, while there are still some limitations. Due to the large outbreaks started at different times all over the world, the effects of seasonal and geographical factors have not been taken into account. Although the fitting with the Chinese model can better predict the situation around the world, through reference and learning, the response strategies of other countries may be more mature. As China resumes work, the production capacity of various medical resources will gear up rapidly, which will impose a positive impact on the world, and it could be more optimistic that the IFP will come soon.\n\nLocal governments, regardless of the speed of outbreaks, should learn from China's primary response strategy, such as stopping working, reducing gathering, preventing contact transmission, wearing masks, and implementing quarantine. After the NCP being under control, the production and output of medical resources should be intensified, the production of coronavirus detection kits should be accelerated, existing cases should be summarized. More accurate diagnostic criteria should be compiled to prevent massive missed diagnoses in countries lacking the kit. Even if it currently causes some global economic regression, the recovery will swiftly come after holding the throat of NCP and COVID-19.\n\nBased on data from China, we utilized the State Transition Matrix Model to predict the IFP of disease in countries currently experiencing outbreaks worldwide. If properly controlled, the IFP in South Korea and Italy will come in early March, and the IFP in Iran will come in mid-March. During this period, countries around the world should work together to fight the epidemic. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 10.20033670 doi: medRxiv preprint author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 10.20033670 doi: medRxiv preprint author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 10.20033670 doi: medRxiv preprint Table. 4."}
