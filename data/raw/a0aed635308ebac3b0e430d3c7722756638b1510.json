{"title": "Exportations of Symptomatic Cases of MERS-CoV Infection to Countries outside the Middle East Technical Appendix 1 Methods Data", "body": "For MERS-CoV, the ratio between reported and estimated total symptomatic MERS-CoV cases has been calculated to be 10 (10). We thus used the factors of 10 in expression (1) to calculate the total number of expected annual exportations of symptomatic cases.\n\nIn both calculations, we used Poisson confidence intervals to reflect stochastic variation in the expected number of exportations (11) . CIs do not take into account uncertainty in the number of travelers, which is likely small if compared to uncertainty related to the outbreak size and so will be unlikely to bias the results.\n\nWe also calculated the likelihood of disease exportation to any of the countries considered. We assumed that the number of symptomatic cases exported to any destination country followed a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to expression 1. We then estimated the probability of the number of exportations being different and higher than 0, that is, the probability of having at least one exportation.\n\nTo calculate the number of exportations among visitors to the source countries, the number of travelers to the source countries was taken to be the total number of persons traveling to the source countries. This includes groups traveling for different purposes such as tourists, professionals traveling for business, or pilgrims. Travelers' duration of stay in the source countries was taken to be the average length of stay of visitors in each country.\n\nTo estimate exportations among travelers who are residents in the Middle Eastern source countries, the number of travelers was considered to be the number of Middle Eastern residents visiting the destination countries. Visitors from the source countries include source country residents (persons that live in the Middle East source countries) and/or persons whose nationality Page 4 of 5 is that of the source countries (for the United Kingdom, the United States, Malaysia, the number of Middle East residents visiting in these countries was available; for Italy and Tunisia, the number of visitors was available per nationality only). Length of stay in the Middle East was taken to be the upper bound of the incubation period (10.2 days [10] ), to ensure exportations were restricted to infectious persons."}
