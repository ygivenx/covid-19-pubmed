{"title": "2 3 TIM-1 SERVES AS A NONREDUNDANT RECEPTOR FOR EBOLA 4 VIRUS, ENHANCING VIREMIA AND PATHOGENESIS 5 6", "body": "Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) is one of five species of ebolaviruses within the Filoviridae family. 68 EBOV continues to cause significant outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa with case fatality rates as 69 high as 90% [1] . All filoviruses have a broad species and cellular tropism. With the exception of 70 lymphocytes, most cells within the body are thought to support EBOV infection and replication 71 [2, 3] . Histopathological studies of EBOV infected humans and non-human primates (NHPs) 72\n\nhave demonstrated viral antigen in many different organs including: liver, spleen, lymph nodes, 73 kidney, adrenal glands, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, brain and heart [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . -/genotype (referred to as TIM-1 -/throughout this study). All expected genotypes 164 were produced in normal Mendelian ratios. Genomic DNA from mouse tail-clips was assessed 165 by PCR for genotypes. The primers and protocol for Ifnar -/screening has been previously 166 Organs were harvested from control and TIM-1 -/mice at 1, 3 or 5 days following infection 204 from with EBOV GP\u2206O/rVSV. Prior to euthanasia, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane to 205 perform retro-orbital bleeds for serum. Mice were euthanized and perfused with 10 mL of PBS 206 through the heart and organs harvested, weighed and frozen at -80\u00baC. To determine virus titers, 207 organs or sera were thawed and organs were homogenized in PBS and filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5 208 syringe filter. Viral titers were determined by end point dilution on Vero cell as previously 209 Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect 216 proinflammatory cytokine and chemokines levels from organs of mice challenged with EBOV 217 GP\u2206O/rVSV. At time of harvest, organs were placed in Trizol and frozen at -80\u00baC until further 218 use. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol LS reagent (Life Technologies) according 219 to manufacturer's tissue RNA isolation procedure. RNA was quantified by Nanodrop (Thermo 220 Scientific). Total RNA (2 \u00b5g) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random primers and the 221 High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). SYBR Green based 222 quantitative PCR reactions (Applied Biosystems) were performed using 1.5\u00b5L of a 1:100 223 dilution of cDNA from each reaction and specific primers for murine cytokines and 224 chemokines.

Further, WT VSV serves as an excellent control for in vivo studies with 287 EBOV GP/rVSV. We challenged TIM-1 -/and control mice with 10 5 iu of VSV by i.v. injection. 288\n\nIn contrast to our EBOV GP/rVSV findings, we observed no difference in the survival curve 289 between the two strains of mice (Fig. 1C ). Since it is likely that VSV bearing it native GP is 290 more pathogenic than a recombinant VSV containing a different viral GP, we also evaluated 291 mortality associated with different doses of VSV and found that administration of as little as 10 1 292 iu of VSV was lethal to Ifnar -/mice (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). Thus, we repeated VSV infections in 293 control and TIM-1 -/mice at a challenge dose of 10 1 iu to determine if subtle changes in virus 294 pathogenesis could be discerned. Even at this low dose, there was no difference in the survival in 295 the TIM-1 -/mice versus the control mice (Fig. 1D ). These results provide evidence that the 296 difference in EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis in BALB/c Ifnar -/and TIM-1 -/mice was due to the 297 presence of EBOV GP expressed in the recombinant VSV rather than other VSV genes. The 298 reduced pathogenesis of EBOV GP expressing virus in TIM-1 -/mice was consistent with 299 findings described by Younan et al. using maEBOV [34] . 300 301\n\nThe effect of TIM-1 expression on viremia and organ viral loads following i.v. EBOV 304 GP\u2206O/rVSV infection was examined in serum and organs harvested 1, 3 or 5 days following 305 infection (Fig. 2) . Viremia and infectious virus in various organs were quantified by endpoint 306 dilution titering on Vero cells, a highly permissive cell line for EBOV GP/rVSV. At early times 307 .

However, by day 5 of EBOV GP\u0394O/rVSV infection, TIM-1 -/mice had a 309 100-fold reduction in viremia compared to control mice (Fig. 2) and a similar trend was observed 310 during infections with full length EBOV GP/rVSV (Supplement Fig. 3 ). In parallel, levels of 311 infectious virus in liver, kidney, and adrenal gland were also significantly reduced. Studies at day 312 5 of infection also indicated that EBOV GP\u2206O/rVSV loads were much reduced in the brain of 313 TIM-1 -/mice and trended lower in the testis (Supplement Fig. 4A at days -1 and 2. We verified that T cells within peripheral blood were profoundly depleted at 366 day 5 of infection by flow cytometry following immunostaining with an \u03b1-CD90 mAb (Fig. 5A) . 367\n\nAs observed for the T cell-competent mice in above studies, T cell-depleted control mice 368 challenged with EBOV GP/rVSV succumbed to the infection between 4-6 days. Likewise, while 369 T cell-depleted TIM-1 -/mice had significantly better survival than T cell depleted control mice 370 they did not exhibit improved survival over TIM-1 -/mice that were not T cell-depleted ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
