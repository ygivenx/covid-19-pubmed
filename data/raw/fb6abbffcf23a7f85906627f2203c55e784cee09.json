Pairs tested Pairs positive Percent positive", "body": "1) Gene expression a) Gene expression data throughout embryogenesis have been previously obtained using Affymetrix microarray analysis by Tomancak et al. 1 These data were used to compute Pearson correlation coefficients between -1 and 1 for all pairs of genes. b) Gene expression data covering approximately 5,000 genes though the developmental life cycle of Drosophila have been previously obtained by cDNA microarrays in Dr. Kevin White's group 2 . These data were used to compute Pearson correlation coefficients between -1 and 1 for all pairs of genes. c) We also used pairs of genes that are co-expressed across evolution, i.e. multiple genomes 3 . A pair was encoded as 1 if the two genes are co-expressed in at least two organisms and as 0 otherwise.\n\nIt is believed that most protein-protein interactions are mediated by domain-domain interactions. Interdom is a database of putative interacting protein domains derived from multiple data sources 4 . This attribute was encoded as 1 if the gene pair contains an interacting domain pair, and as 0 otherwise.\n\n3) Interologs (conserved interaction) Similar to Matthews et al. 5 , we defined Interologs as fly protein pairs for which corresponding homologs had been shown to interact in human, yeast, or worm. Interologs were encoded as 1 or 0. a) Human interologs were derived from human protein interaction data downloaded from HPRD 6 . b) Yeast interologs were derived from yeast protein interaction data downloaded from DIP 7 . c) Worm interologs were derived from C. elegans protein interaction data downloaded from DIP 7 .\n\nGenetic interactions were downloaded from the FlyBase 8 . These data were encoded as 1 if a gene pair is a genetic interaction, and 0 otherwise. 5) Gene Ontology annotations 9 a) Molecular functions: for each pair of genes A-B, we counted how many gene pairs (out of all possible binary gene combinations) have the exact same GO Molecular Function annotations as A-B. b) Cellular components: for each pair of genes A-B, we counted how many gene pairs (out of all possible binary gene combinations) have the exact same GO Cellular Component annotations as A-B. The above two data items have integer values from 0 to 98 million, the number of all possible gene pairs of Drosophila melanogaster. Biological process annotations were reserved for evaluation purpose and were not used in the training process.\n\nFlyBase provides a controlled vocabulary annotating where a gene is expressed 10 . The assumption is that when two proteins are expressed in the same location, they are more likely to interact than proteins not found to be expressed at the same location. Each gene was assigned a list of anatomy terms. This attribute was encoded as 1 or 0, where 1 means two genes share at least one anatomy term and 0 means otherwise.\n\nObtaining training positives and negatives. We used a set of reported high-confidence yeast two hybrid results (2,689 interactions) as our positive training examples. Specifically, we took the union of the following as our positive training set: 1) Interactions from Giot et al. 11 with confidence score greater than 0.8. 2) Interactions from Stanyon et al. 12 with reporter score sums greater than 3.\n\n3) Interactions from Formstecher et al. 13 with scores of 'A', 'B', or 'C'. These authors assigned confidence scores to their data such that A > B > C > D > E.\n\nNegative training examples were synthesized by selecting random protein pairs. Any interactions that had been detected by the yeast two-hybrid screens were deleted from this set (to enrich for true negatives). The final negative training set contained 131,761 random pairs of Drosophila genes.\n\nComputational evaluation of prediction results. The accuracy of the predictions was assessed using the technique of five-fold cross-validation. By this approach, 20% of the positive and negative data are withheld during training and, once training is completed, the model predictions are tested on the withheld data. This process is repeated five times, with a different fraction of data withheld each time. The average precision over these five trials was 89%; the recall was 27%.\n\nAs another means of evaluating prediction results, we withheld GO Biological Process annotations from training and prediction and instead used them to score the biological relevance of the predicted interactions. We computed the number of pairs sharing at least one annotation as well as the average depth of shared annotations. We then generated 2000 sets of random gene pairs, each set with as many pairs as we predicted, and computed the above two indexes for all random sets. The actual predicted interactions had a much larger number of pairs sharing GO biological process annotations (5832) than the distribution of shared annotations among random pairs, which had a maximum value of 740 (p<2.2 x 10 -16 ). Similarly, the average depth of shared annotations for the predictions (7.5) was significantly larger than the depths of the sets of random pairs, which reached a maximum of 6.5 (<2.2 x 10 -16 ).\n\nYeast two-hybrid test of predicted interactions. We used the LexA-based yeast twohybrid mating assay 14 to test two sets of predicted interactions: 469 protein pairs predicted to interact by Sharan at al. 15 based on cross-species conservation, and 2047 interactions predicted using a classifier built on multiple lines of evidence (see main text). At the same time, we tested a background set of 2354 randomly selected pairs of proteins. Assays were conducted using sequence-verified yeast two-hybrid clones as previously described 16 . Briefly, BD and AD yeast clones were re-arrayed into 96-well plates (using a Beckman Biomek Span 8 robot) and grown to saturation in 100 \u00b5l of the appropriate media for each clone type. A Beckman Biomek FX 96-channel robot was used to plate 6\u00b5l of each clone type onto a single YPD plate, which was then incubated for 36-48 hours to allow mating and formation of diploids. Yeast cells were replicated to two different diploid selection plates to assay for two-hybrid reporter activity: one plate lacking leucine to assay the LEU2 reporter, and the other containing X-Gal to assay the lacZ reporter. Growth on the Leu-plate and \"blueness\" on the X-Gal plate were scored using scales of 0 -3 and 0 -5, respectively, as previously described 17 . These two values were corrected by subtracting the LEU2 or lacZ scores that the BD clone produced by itself (in a separate auto-activation assay). Pairs for which the sum of corrected LEU2 and lacZ scores exceeded 0.9 were recorded as positives. The quantitative results for all assayed pairs are shown in Supplementary Table 2 .\n\nInteraction probability model. We use a na\u00efve-Bayesian probabilistic model to compute the posterior probability that proteins i and j interact in vivo given the experimental evidence at time t. The results of two experiments on a given interaction are assumed to be conditionally independent if they employ different assay types or different orientations (i as bait and j as prey vs. j as bait and i as prey). The prior probability is set as the background probability for an interaction or using the probability assigned by a classifier via network conservation or other predictive features. \n\nFor brevity we write this expression as .\n\nUsing Bayes rule we get ) (\n\nis the prior probability that i and j interact, is the unconditional probability of observing experimental results x 1 through x t and can be expressed as:\n\nDividing by the numerator gives:\n\nUsing the conditional independence assumption and can be expressed as the product of t independent probabilities: . Two-phase pooling. For strategies that utilize two-phase pooling experiments, a pooling-sensitivity parameter \uf072 is defined. Intuitively, this parameter represents the probability that a pool with a single detectable interaction will show a positive result. Given a pool of 96 AD clones mated with a single BD clone, k is defined to be the number of assay-specific detectable interactions in the sample space (k \u2264 96). Assuming that all detectable interactions in the sample space are independently likely to contribute to a positive pool, the probability that the pool does not show a positive result is , and the probability that the pool shows a positive result is given by (at least one success in k independent Bernoulli trials).\n\nAccording to the two-phase pooling protocol, every positive BD clone from phase I is individually mated with the 96-well AD array in phase II. Since direct mating is highly reproducible using the same assay type 17, 18 , we assume that the results of direct mating are deterministic given , the detectability of an interaction in a given assay type.\n\nHowever, when the include multiple pooled experiments using the same assay type, the interaction probability update equation is more involved. This is due to the fact that repeated pooled experiments are conditionally independent only given the detectability , but not given alone. Therefore,\n\nAssuming that k is small (which is generally true for most pools) we can approximate\n\nSubstituting back, and using simple induction we get the following update rules.\n\nProtein pairs in the sample space of the first phase that do not show a positive BD clone have their posterior probabilities updated using the following equation: \n\ncaptures the number of times pair ij has been in the sample space of the first phase of a pooling experiment using assay type\n\nshowing a positive result. When an interaction is tested directly in the second phase of a pooling experiment its posterior probability is updated as follows: \n\nLower and upper thresholds. The Thresholding and Prediction strategies stop testing a protein pair once its posterior probability of interaction is greater than the upper bound (P u ) or less than the lower bound (P l ).\n\n, where FDR is the target falsediscovery-rate (95%). This ensures that the interactome map at any time t always includes less than 1 -FDR false positives. The lower bound is defined in order to stop testing protein pairs that are very unlikely to interact in vivo. This reduces the cost spent on testing non-interacting pairs, which compose the majority of the candidate interactions. The lower bound is a function of the target coverage level (C), and should leave out less than 100(1 -C) percent of the true interactions. We estimate the lower bound by defining L to be the smallest integer, such that the probability that a true interaction be tested directly L times with zero positive results is less than 1 -C. This leads to the following inequality: C fnr L \uf02d \uf0a3 1 . "}
