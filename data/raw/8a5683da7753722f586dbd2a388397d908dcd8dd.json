The upper band corresponds to wt and DI-A genomes, and the lower band to DIs B and C To study whether defective RNAs were encapsidated, (data not shown). These data indicate that DI RNAs are virions from passage 1 and 41 were partially purified by independently packaged into defective virions that differ centrifugation through a 15% w/v sucrose cushion.

Due to these large sizes, D-RNAs could not be amplified by RT-PCR using primers specific for the aged into virions together with full-length genome or independently encapsidated, virions from passage 41 were ends of the genome. To circumvent this limitation, four pairs of primers were designed to amplify the D-RNAs purified by centrifugation through sucrose cushions and through a continuous sucrose gradient. RNA extracted in four separate reactions, giving overlapping fragments that were referred to as, from 5 to 3, a, b, c, and d.

After sedimen-from passage 41 purified virions was used as template.\n\nAs a control, parallel amplification of wt genomic RNA tation through a 31% w/v (1.19 g/ml) sucrose cushion only the wt genome was detected in pelleted virions (Fig. was performed.\n\nRT-PCR amplification with primers 1 and 2 (Table 1 ) 2B, lane b). However, when the sucrose cushion density was decreased to 15% w/v (1.11 g/ml) both the full-length from either passage 1 or passage 41 RNAs gave rise to a unique PCR product of 1.9 kb, indicating that fragment and the defective RNAs were detected (Fig. 2B, lane c) . An almost complete separation of wt and defective viri-a was common to all DI-RNAs, and corresponded to the 5 1.9-kb region of the TGEV genome (Fig. 3) . Amplifica-ons was achieved in continuous sucrose gradients (15-were observed in agarose gels around the 1.9-kb band, indicating the presence of high heterogeneity in this fragment (results not shown). To assign fragments to the defective genomes, RNA from passage 41-purified virus was resolved in agarose gels until a clear separation between genomic, DI-A, DI-B, and DI-C RNAs was achieved. Bands containing each of these four RNAs were independently cut and used as templates for RT-PCR amplification with primers 8 and 9 (Table 1) . No amplification occurred from genomic RNA. A predominant PCR product of 1.1 kb was obtained from the amplification of either DI-A or DI-B RNAs, although other less abundant DNAs of varying size were also detected with DI-B RNA, indicating again the presence of heterogeneity at the 3 end of DI-B RNA. DI-C RNA amplification resulted in a 1.4-kb product. These results allowed the assignment of cloned fragments of 1.9-and 2.1-kb fragments to DI-B and DI-C, respectively. The fragments of 3.5 and 4.6 kb obtained using primers 5 and 6 were assigned to D-RNAs C and B, respectively, since the sum of fragments a to d resulting from this assignment accounts for the total size observed for DI-B and DI-C RNAs (Fig. 1) . The assignment of these fragments was subsequently confirmed by Northern hybridization using oligonucleotides that mapped in the regions of DI-B not present in DI-C, and vice versa (data not shown).\n\nThe four DI-C PCR-derived overlapping fragments, a (1.9 kb), b (2.8 kb), c (3.5 kb), and d (2.1 kb) were cloned, and at least two clones from independent RT-PCR reac- the ORF1a-ORF1b overlapping region; (III) a region of 2531 nt corresponding to positions 17843 to 20372 of the genome, comprising the 3 half of ORF1b and the first 8 tion with primers 3 and 4 gave rise to a unique PCR product of 2.8 kb specific of DI-RNAs.

The areas containing these differences were then sequenced in uct (12 kb). With primers 5 and 6 two different PCR products of 3.5 and 4.6-kb were obtained from p41 RNA. The the strain PUR46-MAD (i.e., the DI parental virus). The sequences of DI-C and PUR46-MAD were identical with 4.6-kb product was also obtained from passage 1 RNA, indicating that it could be derived from the helper RNA the exception of three nucleotide differences (Table 2) and one nucleotide insertion at the 3 end of the genome present in the DI-RNA stock (without excluding that it could be also present in one DI RNA).

Twenty two and 5 clones derived from DI-B the S gene, and the 3 end of the genomic RNA. This structure closely resembles that observed for an IBV-and DI-C, respectively, were sequenced. All DI-C-derived fragments had identical sequence (Fig. 5B ). In contrast, derived DI genome (CD-91) of 9.1 kb (Penzes et al., 1994) . Similarly to IBV CD-91 RNA, TGEV DI-B and DI-C RNAs the 22 clones derived from DI-B RNA showed up to 9 different sequences with variable lengths (Fig. 5A) .

The sequence AAACT was found and a pseudoknot structure located 3 to this sequence), and encoding for the polymerase, metal ion binding, and flanking the deletions. sequenced genomes is shown. The number of clones giving the same sequence are indicated in the column to the left. All DI-C sequenced clones showed the same deletion of 7714 nt between regions III and IV. In contrast, DI-B genomes showed a larger deletion with variable size. Numbers above the nucleotide sequences indicate residue position in the indicated ORF. n, number of nucleotides to be added to 7714 to make the size of the deletion between regions III and IV.

Mapping of DI-A by Northern hybridization. RNA from PUR46 passage 41 was electrophoresed in agarose gel until complete separation of genomic RNA and defective RNAs A, B, and C was achieved. RNA was probed with various 32 P-labeled oligonucleotides that hybridized to the wt genome or to the DI RNAs (/) or that did not hybridized to these RNAs (0). The approximate localization of the complementary sequence recognized by the oligonucleotides in the wt genome is indicated by arrows. Letters and numbers above boxes indicate viral genes in the wt genome. The oligonucleotide (1) complementary to the leader sequence maps at 66 to 91 nucleotides from the TGEV genome 5-end. The seven oligonucleotides (2 to 8) complementary to gene 1 map at positions: 2151 to 2170; 6121 to 6140; 8684 to 8703; 12261 to 12280; 14148 to 14167; 17363 to 17381; and 18792 to 18811, from the 5-end, respectively. The oligonucleotides used to determine the presence of the structural genes (9 to 13) map at positions: 1055 to 1074; 1980 to 1999; and 3600 to 3619, from the 5-end of S gene; 97 to 116, from the 5-end of M gene; and 5 to 24, from the 5-end of N gene, respectively. The oligonucleotide mapping in the UTR (number 14) corresponds to nucleotides 28524 to 28543 from the 5-end of genomic RNA. All probes hybridized to wt genomic RNA and gave the expected results with DI-B and DI-C RNAs. case sequence motifs, these subgenomic RNAs do not DI-C was more abundant than DI-B, probably reflecting seem to have self-replicating activity, because they were the higher replication efficiency and/or stability of DI-C. lost after infecting at low m.o.i.

However, this is unlikely because DI-C conspeculate that DI-A RNA could self-replicate in those tains sequences, located in the junction between regions cells that did not receive helper virus and DI-A particles III and IV, that are missing in DI-B (Fig. 5) . could be recovered after subsequent infection from a Coronavirus N protein has been implicated in the replihelper virus shed by neighboring cells.
