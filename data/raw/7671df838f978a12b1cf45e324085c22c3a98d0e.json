{"title": "Impact of community respiratory viral infections in urban children with asthma", "body": "Viral infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbation in children. Cross-sectional studies of outpatient children who are sick with asthma exacerbations have shown 61% to 81% positivity for viral infection, compared with 21% to 42% of children who are well. [1] [2] [3] [4] Rhinovirus (RV) makes up more than 50% of viruses isolated. Viral detection is associated with asthma exacerbation treatment failure. 5 Nevertheless, apparently well children with asthma may also harbor respiratory viruses in their airways. 1, [6] [7] [8] [9] Twenty-one percent of hospitalized children 3 years or older without wheezing tested positive for virus. 3 Similarly, 23% of children 2 years of age or older with well-controlled asthma tested positive for virus. 4 Virus detection rates in healthy children are higher in young children [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and developing communities. 16 Given the high rate of RV transmission within families 17 and the 1-to 3-week duration of RV shedding after infection, most asymptomatic infections likely represent children convalescing from a symptomatic viral infection. 18 The impact of respiratory viral detection in children with asthma in a community environment is less well studied. In children from Madison, Wisconsin, virus-positive weeks were associated with greater asthma symptoms, as well as more frequent loss of asthma control. 19, 20 In a community cohort of children with asthma from Randrick, Australia (a suburb of Sydney), RV was detected in 25.5% of nasal samples and associated with increased cough, phlegm, wheeze, and chest tightness. 21, 22 No change in peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) was seen. However, effects of natural respiratory viral infections on lung function and symptoms in urban children with asthma remain largely undefined. Patterns of viral respiratory illnesses may differ between urban and suburban children. For example, sick inner-city infants have lower rates of viral detection than suburban infants. 23 In addition, asthma is undertreated in urban children, 24 which may amplify the effects of viral infection. Finally, whereas we 25 and others [26] [27] [28] [29] have examined nasal cytokine responses of children with asthma to natural colds, potential effects of asymptomatic or mild viral infections have not been studied.\n\nWe hypothesize that children with asthma in an urban community environment who experience high-symptom upper respiratory viral infections have reduced pulmonary function as well as greater respiratory tract inflammation and viral copy number than children with virus-positive low-symptom illnesses or virus-negative upper respiratory tract symptoms. We therefore examined the influence of viral infection on respiratory symptoms, lung function, and nasal cytokines in children with asthma from Detroit, Michigan.\n\nThis study was conducted by Community Action Against Asthma (CAAA), a community-based participatory research partnership, as part of an environmental epidemiology study evaluating the impact of roadway-associated air pollution on asthma health. Children with known or probable asthma living in Detroit, Michigan, were recruited using a screening questionnaire 24 distributed at community venues and through door-to-door recruitment in neighborhoods near highways. The questionnaire asked about demographic information, symptoms, and whether their child had ever been diagnosed by a medical care provider with any of the following conditions: asthma, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, reactive airways disease, or pneumonia. Parents also were asked whether their child had taken prescription medication for these conditions. Classification of asthma severity was based on symptom frequency and reported inhaled steroid use (eTable 1). Children were classified as atopic if they reported having hay fever, nasal allergies, or eczema. This study was approved by the University of Michigan IRB (ID# HUM00018442).\n\nFifty-three children participated in a 2-week surveillance assessment period of health status each season from fall 2010 to summer 2011. During each 2-week surveillance period, staff obtained spirometry, symptom reports, and nasal lavage samples during 3 home visits. Respiratory symptoms were assessed by using a modified version of a previously published respiratory symptom score 30 assessing fever, cough, sore throat, nasal symptoms, wheezing, difficulty breathing, and interference with activities (eTable 2). By definition, children with wheezing, difficulty breathing, or breathing fast had symptom scores of 5 or greater. Families were given a calendar and respiratory symptom scale to mark the level of their symptoms.\n\nFrom winter 2010 to summer 2011, measurements were repeated during a 1-week period whenever the child experienced a symptomatic respiratory illness as defined by a symptom score of 2 or higher (referred to as a \"sick period\"). We set a low symptom threshold to maximize sensitivity to detect viral illnesses. Families called when the child became ill. When symptoms reached the appropriate threshold, staff would begin a \"sick period\" assessment within 48 hours of the phone call (median time to first sample was 72 hours after symptom development). Staff also conducted weekly telephone calls to identify illnesses in progress that families may not have reported and initiated a \"sick period\" collection if the child had current symptoms.\n\nNasal lavage samples were collected 3 times during a 2-week surveillance period or a 1-week sick period by field staff. Two squirts of isotonic 0.65% NaCl (B.F. Ascher, Lenexa, Kansas) were instilled into the child's nostrils. Subjects then blew their nose into a zippered plastic bag, and 3 mL of M4RT viral transport medium (Remel, Lenexa, Kansas) were added. After collection, samples were placed in transport cooler at 0\u00b0C and transported to the Henry Ford Health System Epidemiology Lab for freezing to -70\u00b0C, and subsequently transported to Ann Arbor on dry ice.\n\nNasal lavage samples were homogenized (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) and nucleic acids extracted using TRIzol-LS (ThermoFisher), chloroform, and an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California). Samples were analyzed for viral nucleic acid by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Seegene Seeplex RV-15 ACE detection kit, Concord, California). This kit detects human adenovirus, bocavirus 1-4, coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and OC43, enterovirus, influenza A and B, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B and rhinovirus A, B, and C. For surveillance samples, all specimens were analyzed for virus; for cold samples, specimens from the same sick week were pooled before viral detection analysis (samples from sick periods were not pooled for cytokine or viral copy number determination).\n\nAll nasal samples were analyzed for messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from total RNA by Taqman reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen). DNA was digested with DNase I (Qiagen). C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)-8, CXCL10, interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), retinoic-acid-inducible protein 1 (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), and interferon (IFN)-l1 mRNA expression were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Specific primers and probes spanning exon-exon junctions (intron splice-sites) were used to prevent amplification of genomic DNA. Expression levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), using the DDCt method. Reactions with a GAPDH cycle number greater than 35 were not analyzed. CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, CCL20, CCL24, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and ICAM-1 protein levels were determined by multiplex immune assay (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California). Biomarkers were chosen based on previous studies showing elevations after RV infection, our interest in examining biomarkers we had not previously studied, difficulty of detecting some biomarkers or cytokines in nasal aspirate fluid, cost, and availability.\n\nFor samples testing positive for RV, copy number was determined by qPCR, using previously published primers. 31 \n\nRhinovirus-positive surveillance samples and 1 sample each from RV-positive sick period were further analyzed to determine RV genotype. Rhinovirus typing was performed by semi-nested PCR amplification of the P1-P2 region from gel-purified PCR products. 32 The identity of each sequence was determined by comparison with known 5 0 sequences, using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/Blast.cgi).\n\nUsing protocols we developed for large-scale community-based asthma studies, 33 staff conducted spirometry to assess lung function during home visits using the EasyOne spirometer (NDD, Andover, Massachusetts).\n\nFraction of exhaled nitric oxide in exhaled breath (FeNO) was measured using the NIOX MINO (Aerocrine, New Providence, New Jersey).\n\nOur initial analysis identified that, in addition to anticipated viralpositive illnesses and virus-negative asymptomatic periods, in some surveillance samples viruses were detected and symptomatic illnesses were seen during which no virus was detected. This prompted us to perform a post-hoc analysis looking for similarities and differences between 6 groups: virus-positive/severe symptoms (symptom score \u22655); virus-negative/mild symptoms (symptom score 1-4); virus-negative/asymptomatic (symptom score 0); virus-negative/ severe symptoms (symptom score \u22655); virus-positive/mild symptoms (symptom score 1-4); and virus-positive/asymptomatic (symptom score 0). Mean and standard deviation were used to describe nasal biomarker protein levels, nasal mRNA levels and symptom score before and during viral illnesses. Distributions of continuous outcome variables were examined and appropriate transformations taken to achieve normality. Toll-like receptor 3 and IFN-l1 mRNA levels were undetectable in a large number of samples (eTable 3), and therefore these results were analyzed as a binary variable (detectable, undetectable).\n\nEffects of viral/symptom state on individual symptoms, lung function, nasal aspirate mRNA and protein levels, and RV copy number were determined using generalized estimating equations (GEE), with an exchangeable correlation structure using the identify link for continuous outcomes and the log link for binary ones. Analysis was performed using SAS software (Cary, North Carolina). We evaluated and adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity/race, self-reported atopy, smoker in the home, caregiver educational attainment, season of sample collection, and whether the sample was from a surveillance or sick collection period. Family income, proximity to high-traffic highways, baseline asthma severity, and medication use were evaluated but not included in final models, because they were not significant predictors. Significance level was set at P < .05.\n\nFifty-three children with asthma were enrolled. Surveillance samples were collected from September 2010 to August 2011, and sick samples were collected from December 2010 to August 2011. Subjects were predominantly African-American (Table 1) . Most subjects were atopic, exposed to tobacco smoke, and had a household income less than $15,000. Based on symptom frequency and reported inhaled steroid use, most children had mild intermittent or mild persistent asthma. Approximately one-quarter had moderate-to-severe persistent disease and used inhaled corticosteroids within the last year. Of note, this community has a high rate of poorly controlled asthma and undertreatment with inhaled corticosteroids. 24, 34 Mean values of forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV 1 , and PEF measured at the time of the first surveillance visit were normal, but FEV 1 /FVC ratio and forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of the pulmonary volume (FEF 25%-75% ) were mildly reduced ( Table 2 ). Average FeNO was elevated. Group mean surveillance nasal aspirate mRNA and protein values are shown in Table 3 .\n\nFrom September 2010 to August 2011, 410 surveillance samples were collected, 94 (22.9%) of which were positive for 1 or more viruses. From December 2010 to August 2011, 83 self-reported respiratory illnesses were found, for which 248 samples were collected. Analysis of samples pooled within each individual sick period showed that 28 of 83 (33.7%) of these illnesses were positive for virus. Thus, \n\nDuring surveillance periods, virus-negative samples were associated with a symptom score of 2.6 \u00a7 4.5 (mean \u00a7 standard deviation [SD]), and virus-positive samples were associated with a symptom score of 3.1 \u00a7 4.2 (P = .008, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). During sick periods, virus-negative samples were associated with a symptom score of 6.4 \u00a7 5.7, and virus-positive samples were associated with a symptom score of 5.7 \u00a7 5.1. Children with virus-positive, severe illnesses (symptom score, \u22655) experienced reductions in FEF 25%-75% (Fig 1A) . Only the symptomatic virus-negative groups demonstrated a significant increase in FeNO (Fig 1B) .\n\nNext, we examined nasal aspirate mRNA and protein levels in the 6 conditions. A total of 607 samples were analyzed (Table 4 ). Of interest, 43 samples were virus-positive and had an associated symptom score of 0 (asymptomatic infection). Of these, 24 had at least 1 sample collected within 28 days before the asymptomatic infection. Eighteen of 24 (75%) were preceded by a cold within that time period, indicating that asymptomatic infections represented convalescence from an earlier symptomatic cold.\n\nCompared with the virus-negative asymptomatic condition, samples from children with more severe colds (symptom score \u22655) showed higher nasal mRNA expression of CXCL10 and MDA5 (Fig 2A) and greater protein abundance of CXCL8, CXCL10, sICAM-1, CCL2, CCL4, CCL20, and CCL24 (Fig 2C) . In addition, samples from children A B Figure 1 . Comparisons of lung function and exhaled NO (eNO) between the 6 groups of conditions. The virus-negative/high-symptom group (symptom score \u22655, black squares), virus-positive/mild-symptom group (symptom score 1-4, gray squares), virus-positive/asymptomatic (symptom score 0, white squares), virus-negative/high-symptom group (symptom score \u22655, black circles) and virus-negative/mild-symptom group (symptom score 1-4, gray circles) are each compared with the virus-negative/asymptomatic group.

Samples from children with mild and asymptomatic viral infections also showed significant increases in some nasal aspirate biomarkers, albeit fewer biomarkers than samples from more severe colds (Fig 2A, 2C) . Samples from children with asymptomatic infections showed higher nasal CXCL10 mRNA and CCL20 protein expression, suggesting persistence of these cytokines after resolution of symptoms. Children with mild colds and asymptomatic infections, but not those with severe colds, also showed an increase in the number of aspirates positive for IFN-l mRNA (Fig 2B) . Finally, and unexpectedly, symptomatic virus-negative illnesses showed no significant increases in nasal biomarkers except for CXCL10 protein. When we re-examined data, restricting our analysis to children with persistent asthma (either mild or moderate-tosevere), nearly identical results were obtained, except that samples from all 3 virus-positive groups showed significant increases in IFN-l compared with the virus-negative, asymptomatic condition (not shown). The considerable number of virus-negative illnesses led us to examine the distribution of subjects with self-reported atopy and proximity to highways in the 6 viral detection/symptom score conditions. However, no difference was seen in the percentage of children with atopy (x 2 , 0.24) or high-traffic exposure (0.46) in the virus-negative illness groups. Also, when we reevaluated our data for effect modification using interaction modeling, interaction terms for atopy and high traffic were not statistically significant. Finally, when we reran our GEE models adjusting for the main effects of atopy or high traffic, no change was seen in the associations of interest between virus/symptom group and cytokine level.\n\nFor RV infections, we examined the association between viral copy number with nasal aspirate mRNA, protein, and overall symptom scores. Nasal aspirate RV copy number was positively associated with mRNA expression of CXCL10 and MDA5 (Fig 3A) . Viral load also was associated with protein abundance of CXCL8, CXCL10, ICAM-1, CCL2, CCL4, and CCL20 (Fig. 3B, 3C) , which together attract neutrophils and monocytes to the airways. However, levels of IL-4, IL-13, CCL5, and CCL24, which promote eosinophil chemotaxis and allergic airways disease, were not associated with viral load. No significant difference was found in viral copy number between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections (symptomatic, 1.22 \u00a3 10 5 \u00a7 125 copies/mL; asymptomatic, 0.54 \u00a3 10 5 \u00a7 54 copies/mL; geometric mean \u00a7 geometric SD, P = .62, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Nor was an association seen between viral copy number and overall symptom score (P = .42). The study did not have statistical power to correlate copy number with lung function.\n\nAlthough we did not design the study to examine the time course of cytokine expression, our collections included 3 samples from each of 28 sick period single viral infections, as well as baseline surveillance samples for these individuals. Messenger RNA expression of CXCL10, IRF7, and MDA5 and protein abundance of CXCL10 peaked 1 to 3 days after the onset of infection (Fig 4A) . Protein abundance of CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL4, CCL20, and ICAM1 peaked at 4 to 6 days A B C Figure 2 . Comparison of nasal aspirate mRNAs and proteins between the 6 groups of conditions. The virus-negative/high-symptom group (symptom score \u22655, black squares), viruspositive/mild-symptom group (symptom score 1-4, gray squares), virus-positive/asymptomatic (symptom score 0, white squares), virus-negative/high-symptom group (symptom score \u22655, black circles), and virus-negative/mild-symptom group (symptom score 1-4, gray circles) are each compared with the virus-negative/asymptomatic group.

Interleukin-4, IL-13, CCL5, CCL24, each of which promote type 2 inflammation, peaked 7 to 14 days after infection.\n\nThis study was undertaken to examine the influence of natural upper respiratory tract viral infection on respiratory symptoms, airway function, and inflammation in children with asthma from the urban community, and to determine possible mechanisms by correlating these outcomes with nasal aspirate cytokines and other biomarkers. We hypothesized that children with high-symptom severe colds have greater airflow obstruction, respiratory tract inflammation, and viral copy number than those with milder colds and asymptomatic infections, as well as virus-negative conditions. In contrast to children from a suburban setting, 22 high-symptom viral infections were associated with reduced small airway function, as evidenced by changes in FEF 25%-75% . Compared with the virus-negative asymptomatic condition, children with severe colds showed elevations of nasal mRNA and protein biomarkers. Children with mild and asymptomatic infections showed fewer elevations. We found associations between viral load and nasal aspirate levels of chemokines, which together attract neutrophils and monocytes to the airways, but not those that promote eosinophil chemotaxis and allergic airways disease. This is the first study to correlate viral load and respiratory tract cytokine levels during natural colds. Finally, urban children with asthma experienced many virus-negative symptomatic illnesses, which were associated with increased exhaled nitric oxide but not reduced airway function or elevated nasal biomarkers.\n\nWe found that subjects were only slightly more likely to have a virus during self-reported colds (33.7%) than during surveillance sample collection (22.9%). The high rate of viral detection during surveillance periods is consistent with previous studies in well children with asthma [1] [2] [3] [4] and is unlikely to be attributable to false positives, because RV detection was confirmed by amplification and sequencing of gel-purified PCR products in 92% of cases. Conversely, we believe the low viral detection rate during symptomatic episodes can be explained by the fact that samples were not collected in the fall and instead were only collected from January to August, when rhinovirus infections are less prevalent. The low symptom threshold for \"sick\" sample collection and financial reimbursement for each sick period assessment, which offset time and effort needed to participate, could also have contributed to a low viral detection rate. While our rate of viral detection is lower than reported previously, 1,2 it is consistent with the lower frequency of viral detection in urban children with respiratory illnesses compared with suburban children. 23 Finally, our data indicate that urban children with asthma experience frequent virus-negative upper respiratory tract illnesses. Cold-like illnesses were unlikely to represent false-negative viral infections, because they were unaccompanied by reduced pulmonary function or increases in nasal aspirate MDA5, a double-stranded RNA pattern recognition receptor that was increased in virus-positive samples and has been shown to be induced after RV infection. 35 Finally, when we retested a subset of our initial multiplex PCR viral detection results using standard RV qPCR, we found a false-negative rate of only 3%. As in previous studies, 23, 30 RV was the most common virus detected, and overall, inner-city infants had low rates of viral detection. However, we did not appreciate higher adenovirus rates as observed previously. 23 Although RV-C is associated with severe asthma exacerbations, 32,36-42 we did not recruit enough patients to discern a difference in symptom severity between species.\n\nNext, we evaluated the significance of viral infection on respiratory symptoms, lung function, and respiratory tract inflammation. One third of viral infections were associated with severe colds (symptom score \u22655), which by definition included children with wheezing, difficulty breathing, or breathing fast. In contrast to children with asthma from a suburb of Sydney, 22 children from Detroit with severe colds demonstrated significant reductions in FEF 25%-75% , consistent with small airways involvement. 43 This discrepancy could relate to the frequent undertreatment of urban children with asthma. 24 Because inhaled corticosteroid use reduces the rate of exacerbations, 44 urban children may be more susceptible to viral-induced reductions in airway function than suburban children. This hypothesis is consistent with previous studies in which the impact of pollution on asthma was seen predominantly in children not using steroids. 45, 46 In addition, we found that high-symptom severe viral infections, but not virus-negative illnesses, were associated with significant elevations in nasal aspirate mRNA expression of CXCL10, MDA5, and TLR3 and protein abundance of CXCL8, CXCL10, sICAM-1, CCL2, CCL4, CCL20, and CCL24. Previous studies of children with natural colds have shown increases in nasal chemokines. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Increases in MDA5, TLR3, and ICAM-1 are noteworthy, because each functions as a receptor for RV. Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 and TLR3 are cytoplasmic and endosomal receptors for viral double-stranded RNA, respectively, 47 whereas ICAM-1 is a receptor for major group RV. 48 Samples from children with mild and asymptomatic viral infections also showed significant increases in nasal aspirate biomarkers, albeit fewer than samples from more severe colds.

Collection of these samples often followed symptomatic viral infections, indicating that asymptomatic infections represented convalescence from more severe colds. Samples from children with asymptomatic infections showed higher nasal CXCL10 mRNA and CCL20 protein expression, suggesting persistence of these cytokines after resolution of symptoms.\n\nWe hypothesized that viral copy number determines asthma symptoms and respiratory tract inflammation after RV infection. We found that viral load was associated with protein abundance of CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL4, and CCL20, chemokines that together attract neutrophils and monocytes to the airways, but not with IL-4, IL-13, CCL5, or CCL24, cytokines that promote eosinophil chemotaxis and allergic airways disease. In contrast, no association was seen between viral copy number and symptoms. Our data are consistent with a previous study in adults with asthma showing no correlation between severity of lower respiratory tract symptoms and viral load. 49 These data suggest that respiratory symptoms in children with asthma with natural colds may not depend on viral load alone. Other factors may determine asthma control after viral infection, including environmental and genetic factors. 50 The exact nature of the observed virus-negative respiratory tract illnesses is unclear. Unlike virus-positive illnesses, virus-negative symptomatic sicknesses were accompanied by increased eNO. Previous studies in subjects with asthma have shown that experimental exposure to allergen and particulate matter increases eNO in contrast to experimental RV infection, which does not, 51, 52 suggesting that virus-negative illnesses could have been precipitated by environmental exposures. We did not find an association between viral-negative illnesses and self-reported atopy or proximity to high-traffic roadways. However, because the 6 groups we studied do not represent different subjects but different disease states according to viral detection and symptoms, possibly these illnesses represent acute exposures to allergen, traffic, or other pollutants.\n\nAfrican American children living in low-socioeconomic-status urban environments continue to experience higher asthma morbidity than white children. 53 Racial disparities are observed in asthma prevalence, emergency department visits, hospital readmissions, and death rates. 54, 55 Therefore, although data from Detroit may not be generalizable to other settings, they provide new insight into the effect of viral infections on an important pediatric population.\n\nOur study has a number of limitations. First, we used nasal aspirates to sample respiratory tract inflammation, allowing repeated collection of samples from children in a noninvasive manner. We did not validate our method by comparing our results with lower respiratory tract specimens. However, gene expression among children with asthma is altered similarly in nasal and bronchial airways. 56 Second, a lag period occurred between onset of respiratory symptoms and nasal aspirate collection. Third, symptoms may have been caused or prevented by any number of unmeasured covariates, including body mass index, mucus production, or antiinflammatory cytokines. Fourth, our assessments of symptom score, asthma severity, and atopy were based on self-report and were not independently validated, allowing the possibility of measurement error.\n\nWe conclude that, in urban children with chronic asthma, highsymptom respiratory viral infections reduce airway function. Children with more severe colds demonstrate more elevations of nasal biomarkers than children with mild colds, asymptomatic infections, or virus-negative illnesses. However, many children experienced virus-negative cold-like illnesses associated with increased eNO but not nasal aspirate biomarkers or lung function change. Further studies are needed to understand the precise factors that determine respiratory tract symptoms in children with asthma.
