The virus RNA was stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.\n\nA PCR for norovirus identification was conducted as described (1, 2) . We use a set of oligonucleotide primers (Appendix Table 4 ). A 1-step reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (Invitrogen, https://www.thermofisher.com) was conducted in a final volume of 25 \u00b5L containing 3 \u00b5L of template RNA, 12.5 \u00b5L of 2\u00d7 reaction mixture, 0.6 \u00b5L of 10 \u03bcmol/L of forward (F4895) and reverse (R5591) primers, 1.2 \u00b5L of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and distilled water. The RT-PCR procedure included a reverse transcription step at 55\u00b0C for 30 min; an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 2 min; followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 68\u00b0C for 1 min; and final extension step at 68\u00b0C for 6 min. To confirm the presence of noroviruses, 4 \u00b5L PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, with RedSafe dye (Bulldog Bio, https://www.bulldog-bio.com), at 100 V for 45 min. The amplification product was visualized on a UV transilluminator. The expected size of the norovirus-positive amplified product was 493 bp.\n\nWe conducted a 1-step real-time RT-PCR for norovirus identification as described (8, 9) . This real-time RT-PCR was conducted by using the TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step real-time RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, https://www.thermofisher.com) with specific primers and probe to GI and GII noroviruses was conducted in a final volume of 25 \u00b5L containing 5 \u00b5L of template RNA, 1\u00d7 Master Mix, 0.25 \u00b5mol/L GI forward and reverse primers, 0.125 \u00b5mol/L of GI-JOE labeled probe, 0.25 \u00b5mol/L GII forward and reverse primers, 0.125 \u00b5mol/L of GII-FAM labeled probe, and distilled. This real-time RT-PCR included a reverse transcription step at 50\u00b0C for 10 min; an enzyme activation step at 95\u00b0C for 20 s; followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3 s and annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 s. A cycle threshold value <40 was considered as indicating GI and GII positive.\n\nIn this study, we selected 4 noroviruses from Thailand: including 2 from humans (CU21953 and CU21954) and 2 from dogs (CU21939 and CU21952) for whole-genome sequencing. Whole norovirus genomes were sequenced by using oligonucleotide primer sets previously described and new primer sets designed with Primer 3 Plus (Appendix Table 4 ) (10, 11) . A 25 \u00b5L RT-PCR mixture contained 3 \u00b5L of template RNA, 12.5 \u00b5L of 2\u00d7 reaction mixture, 0.6 \u00b5L of 10 \u00b5mol/L forward and reverse primers, 1.2 \u00b5L of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase, and distilled water. The RT-PCR procedure included a reverse transcription step at 55\u00b0C for 30 min; an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 2 min; followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 48-55\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 68\u00b0C for 2 min; and a final extension step at 68\u00b0C for 6 min. Amplicons were gel-purified and sequenced (First Base Laboratories, http://www.firstbaselab.com). Nucleotide sequences were assembled and validated by using SeqMan software version 5.03 (DNASTAR Inc., https://www.dnastar.com).\n\nWhole-genome sequences of noroviruses from Thailand were submitted to GenBank under accession nos. MK928496-9. "}
