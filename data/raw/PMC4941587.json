{"title": "A cluster randomized clinical trial comparing fit\u2010tested and non\u2010fit\u2010tested N95 respirators to medical masks to prevent respiratory virus infection in health care workers", "body": "The current influenza A H1N1 2009 virus pandemic,\n1\n the ongoing zoonotic transmission of influenza A H5N1 and the emergence of oseltamivir\u2010resistant seasonal influenza A H1N1 are threats to human health. Hospital health care workers (HCWs) are key to effective pandemic response and the capacity of health care systems. Respiratory protection is one of the key non\u2010pharmaceutical interventions for protection of HCWs.\n\nNosocomial influenza and other outbreaks result in significant morbidity and costs\n2\n, \n3\n and can occur in the absence of community epidemics.\n4\n During outbreaks of infectious diseases, hospitals may amplify virus transmission, as demonstrated during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n5\n Furthermore, anticipated antiviral shortages and delays in vaccine development make non\u2010pharmaceutical interventions crucial. There are gaps in knowledge about prevention of influenza by medical masks and respirators. There are several prospective, randomized controlled trials on the use of handwashing,\n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n but only two trials on the use of medical masks/respirators in households.\n9\n, \n10\n In one of these studies, we showed that medical masks/respirators in compliant users in the household setting were associated with reductions in the risk of influenza\u2010like illness (ILI)\u2010associated infection.\n10\n To date, there is one small randomized controlled trial (RCT) of medical masks compared to respirators in HCWs\n11\n which found no difference, but lacked a control arm. Medical masks are not designed to provide respiratory protection.\n12\n They have consistently lower filtration efficiency when compared to respirators, which are designed specifically for respiratory protection.\n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n Medical masks were designed to prevent wound contamination when worn by the surgeon; however, three RCTs failed to show efficacy against their intended design.\n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n\n\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of medical masks compared to fit\u2010tested and non\u2010fit\u2010tested N95 respirators in HCWs in the prevention of disease because of influenza and other respiratory viruses.\n\nThe unit of randomization was hospitals. Hospitals were randomized to one of three intervention arms: (i) Medical masks (3M\u2122 medical mask, catalogue number 1820, St Paul, MN, USA); (ii) N95 fit\u2010tested mask (3M\u2122 flat\u2010fold N95 respirator, catalogue number 9132) and (iii) N95 non\u2010fit\u2010tested mask (3M\u2122 flat\u2010fold N95 respirator, catalogue number 9132). Figure 1 outlines the recruitment and randomization (using a secure computerized randomization program) process. A pre\u2010study assessment of hospital infection control levels determined that the hospitals had sufficient diversity to warrant stratified randomization by size of hospital and level of infection control. This assessment measured ventilation, spatial dimensions, bedding configuration, handwashing facilities and personal protective equipment use. The Ministry of Health in 1989 categorizes hospitals in China into three levels (Level 3 is the highest) depending on their level of sophistication, equipment and staff/bed numbers. Fifteen hospitals were randomized \u2013 five level 2 and ten level 3.\n\n(i) Clinical respiratory illness (CRI),\n19\n defined as two or more respiratory or one respiratory symptom and a systemic symptom; (ii) ILI, defined as fever \u226538\u00b0C plus one respiratory symptom (i.e. cough, runny nose, etc.); (iii) laboratory\u2010confirmed viral respiratory infection (detection of adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3, influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, rhinovirus A/B and coronavirus OC43/HKU1 by multiplex PCR); (iv) laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza A or B and (v) adherence with mask/respirator use.\n\nThe choice of a relatively broad CRI definition was dictated by our interest in interrupting transmission of a wide range of respiratory viruses, which in adults may or may not be accompanied by fever. Also, all respiratory pathogens share a similar transmission mechanism namely aerosol, droplet and fomite spread, although the relative role of these factors may vary between different viruses and in different clinical situations. Other endpoints included adverse effects, measured using a semi\u2010structured questionnaire and adherence.\n\nAny nurse, doctor or ward clerk who worked full time in the emergency or respiratory wards at the hospital were eligible. HCWs were excluded if they: (i) were unable or refused to consent; (ii) had beards, long moustaches or long facial hair stubble; (iii) had a current respiratory illness, rhinitis and/or allergy and (iv) worked part\u2010time or did not work in the aforementioned wards/departments. In all participating wards, 100% of eligible health workers participated.\n\nParticipants wore the mask or respirator on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks after being shown when to wear it and how to fit it correctly. Participants were supplied daily with either three masks for the medical mask group or two N95 respirators. Participants were asked to store the mask in a paper bag every time they removed it (for toilet breaks, tea/lunch breaks and at the end of every shift) and place the bagged mask or respirator in their locker. All participants were instructed on the importance of hand hygiene prior to/after the removal of medical masks and respirators. Participants in arm two underwent a fit\u2010testing procedure using a 3M\u2122 FT\u201030 Bitrex Fit Test kit according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions (3M\u2122, St Paul, MN, USA).\n\nDetailed demographic and clinical details of all participants were collected. This included age, sex, smoking history, comorbidities, seasonal influenza vaccination status, medications, conduct of high\u2010risk procedures (defined as suctioning, intubation, nebulized medications, chest physiotherapy and other aerosol generating procedures), handwashing practices, use of other personal protective equipment (gowns, gloves, eye shields and hair/foot covers) and results of laboratory tests. Use of specific interventions for influenza such as antivirals was also measured.\n\nParticipants were followed for 4 weeks of wearing the masks or respirators and an extra week of non\u2010wearing for development of respiratory symptoms.\n\nAll participants received a mercury thermometer to measure their temperature at the beginning of each day and at the onset of any symptoms. Diary cards were provided for the duration to record daily the (i) number of hours worked; (ii) mask/respirator usage and (iii) recognized CRI encounters.\n\nParticipants were contacted daily by phone or face\u2010to\u2010face contact to actively identify incident cases of respiratory infection. At each ward, the head nurse actively followed up all participants and identified incident illness. Staff members from the District CDC also undertook daily monitoring of the sites. If participants were symptomatic, swabs of both tonsils and the posterior pharyngeal wall were collected.\n\nWe also monitored adherence with mask or respirator use over the 4\u2010week time course by: (i) observation: the head ward nurse observed compliance on the ward on a daily basis and recorded the information on a structured form, (ii) self\u2010report: a diary card with tick boxes was given to each subject, to be carried during the day. Adherence to wearing the masks or respirators was monitored by these diary cards and returned to researchers on a weekly basis. Exit interviews with participants were conducted after the 4 weeks to gain further insights into adherence and other issues around the use of masks/respirators including adverse effects.\n\nParticipants with symptoms had two pharyngeal swabs collected by a trained nurse or doctor. Double rayon\u2010tipped, plastic\u2010shafted swabs were used to scratch both tonsilar areas and the posterior pharyngeal wall. These were transported immediately after collection to the laboratory, or at 4\u00b0C within 48 hours if transport was delayed.\n\nPharyngeal swabs were tested with at the Laboratories of the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Viral DNA/RNA was extracted from 300 \u03bcl of each respiratory specimen using the Viral Gene\u2010spinTM kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Inc., Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed on 8 \u03bcl of RNA in a final reaction volume of 20 \u03bcl for 1\u00b75 hours at 37\u00b0C, using the RevertAidTM First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) to synthesize cDNA. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using the Seeplex\u00ae RV12 Detection kit (Seegen, Inc., Seoul, Korea) to detect adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 or 3, influenza viruses A or B, respiratory syncytial virus A or B, rhinovirus A/B and coronavirus OC43/HKU1. Three microlitres of synthesized first\u2010strand cDNA, 4 \u03bcl of multiplex primers, 10 \u03bcl master mix (hot start Taq DNA polymerase and dNTP are included in the reaction buffer) and 3 \u03bcl of 8\u2010methoxypsoralen (8\u2010MOP) were added (8\u2010MOP, accompanied by UV irradiation for 20 minutes, prevents amplification of contaminated DNA). A mixture of 12 viral clones was used as a positive control template, and sterile deionized water was used as a negative control. After preheating at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes, 40 amplification cycles were carried out under the following conditions in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR system 9700, Foster City, CA, USA): 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 1\u00b75 minutes and 72\u00b0C for 1\u00b75 minutes. Amplification was completed at the final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The multiplex PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on an ethidium bromide\u2010stained 2% agarose gel. Viral isolation by MDCK cell culture was undertaken for some of the influenza samples which were positive by nuclei acid detection. Specimen processing, DNA/RNA extraction, PCR amplification and PCR product analyses were conducted in different rooms to avoid cross\u2010contamination.\n\nThe primary endpoints of interest as described above were analysed by intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis. The two N95 arms were also combined and compared to the medical mask arm, given that there was no significant difference between them and rates of fit test failure were extremely low in the fit\u2010tested arm (5/461 fit test failures). Differences in proportions between the trial arms were tested by calculation of Pearson\u2019s chi\u2010square using sas 9.2 software (Cary, NC, USA). The distribution of key potentially confounding variables between study arms was compared. To estimate the odds ratio while adjusting for the clustering effects, we used a random effect logistic regression model. In the model, we added a hospital\u2010specific random intercept in the linear predictors, and maximum likelihood was estimated using adaptive quadrature.\n20\n The model was fitted using \u2018xtlogit\u2019 command in stata (College Station, TX, USA).\n21\n\n\n\nWe also conducted multivariable analysis to adjust for the potential confounders. In the initial model, we included all the variables along with the main exposure variable those were significant (P < 0\u00b705) in the univariate analysis. We then used a backward elimination method to remove the variables that did not have any confounding effect, that is, could not make meaningful (roughly 10%) change in the effect measure with the main exposure variable.\n22\n In case of high multi\u2010collinearity because of strong correlation among the potential confounders, we chose the more relevant ones having the highest confounding effect on the association of interest.\n\nWe analysed compliance as wearing the mask for >80% of the shift.\n\nTo obtain 80% power at 2\u2010sided 5% significant level for detecting a significant difference of attack rate between the intervention arms, and for an assumed 5% attack rate in the N95 arm and 12% in the medical mask arm, a sample size of 488 participants or five clusters (hospitals) per arm was required for cluster size (m) 100 and intra\u2010cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) 0\u00b701.\n23\n The design effect (deff) for this cluster randomization trial was 2 (deff = 1 + (m\u22121) \u00d7 ICC = 1 + (100\u22121) \u00d7 0\u00b701 = 2). As such, we aimed to recruit a sample size of 500 per arm.\n\nA total of 1441 nurses and doctors in 15 Beijing hospitals were recruited into the randomized arms and 481 nurses and doctors in nine hospitals were recruited into the convenience no\u2010mask group. Figure 1 shows the recruitment process. The distribution of demographic variables was generally similar between arms (Table 1), but was significantly different for anyone smoking in the family, four or more people in family, four or more adults in family, influenza vaccination in 2008 and 2007, public transport, handwashing, hospital level and high\u2010risk procedures. In regards to hand hygiene, 83% (382/461), 87\u00b78% (428/488) and 88\u00b76% (435/492) of participants from the N95 fit test arm, N95 non\u2010fit test arm and medical mask arm stated that they washed their hands between patients, respectively.\n\nFor all outcomes, non\u2010fit\u2010tested N95 respirators had lower rates of infections compared to fit\u2010tested N95s (for all N95 versus medical masks, the rates were 3\u00b79% versus 6\u00b77% for CRI, 0\u00b73% versus 0\u00b76% for ILI, 1\u00b74% versus 2\u00b76% for laboratory\u2010confirmed virus and 0\u00b73% versus 1% for influenza) but these differences were not significant. All infection outcomes were consistently higher (approximately double) in the medical mask group compared to the N95 group (Figure 2). There were no cases of influenza in the non\u2010fit\u2010tested N95 arm, three in the fit\u2010tested N95 arm and five in the medical mask arm. After adjustment for clustering, non\u2010fit\u2010tested N95 masks were significantly protective compared to medical masks against CRI, but other outcomes were not significant between N95 and medical masks (Table 2). When compared to the convenience no\u2010mask group and adjusted for clustering, N95 non\u2010fit\u2010tested was significantly protective against CRI, and all N95 was protective against laboratory\u2010confirmed virus and laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza (Table 3). In a post hoc analysis carried out to adjust for potential confounders which were unevenly distributed between arms, all N95 and hospital level remained significant for CRI and laboratory\u2010confirmed viral infection, but handwashing, vaccination and high\u2010risk procedures were not significant (Table 4).\n\nFit\u2010testing failure rate was very low (5/461, 1\u00b708%). Rates of adherence in all arms of the study were high (Figure 3). Table 5 shows adverse events associated with medical mask or N95 use, and that N95 respirators were associated with higher rates of adverse events. Adherence with mask or respirator wearing was high and not significantly different in all arms, with 74% adherence (95% CI 70\u201378%) in the N95 fit\u2010tested arm, 68% in the N95 non\u2010fit\u2010tested arm (95% CI 64\u201373%) and 76% in the medical mask arm (95% CI 72\u201379%). The duration of mask wearing in these arms, respectively, was 5\u00b72 hours (95% CI 5\u00b71\u20135\u00b74 hours), 4\u00b79 hours (95% CI 4\u00b78\u20135\u00b71 hours) and 5 hours (95% CI 4\u00b79\u20135\u00b72 hours; Figure 3).\n\nWe found that rates of respiratory tract infection were approximately double in the medical mask group compared to the N95 group in health workers who wore masks throughout their shift. However, only the N95 non\u2010fit\u2010tested arm was significantly protective against CRI, and there were no other significant differences between N95 respirators and medical masks for the four primary outcomes in the adjusted analysis. However, it should be noted that under the null hypothesis where there is no difference between groups, the probability that we wrongly find at least one significant difference given the 12 tests undertaken is 46%. The trial may also be underpowered because observed attack rates were lower than expected.\n\nThe rates of all outcomes were higher in the convenience no\u2010mask group than in the masks groups. By adjusted intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis, N95 respirators but not medical masks had significantly lower rates of infection compared to no masks. However, the convenience no\u2010mask group was not a randomized control arm and hospitals in this group were actually selected on the basis that most of their staff did not wear masks (which is not the norm in hospitals in Beijing), suggesting that conditions in those hospitals were different than those in hospitals from the masks groups. As a consequence, it is not possible to make any definitive judgement on the efficacy of masks on this basis. One possible bias would be if those hospitals had differentially higher risk of infection compared to the intervention hospitals, for example because of the occurrence of outbreaks. However, we monitored all hospitals involved in the study for outbreaks which may have increased apparent attack rates, and none were documented. Other than that, possible sources of bias that could have plausibly increased the infection rate in the control arm (namely vaccination, handwashing, hospital level and high\u2010risk procedures) were measured. In a post hoc adjusted analysis, only hospital level and the N95 arm were significant against CRI and laboratory\u2010confirmed viral infection.\n\nRespiratory protection is a key strategy for pandemic control and key to sustaining the health care workforce. The fact that rates of all outcomes were consistently lower in the N95 group suggest that N95 respirators might offer better protection for HCWs; but a larger trial is needed to make a definitive judgment about the relative efficacy of respirators and medical masks. A recent, smaller trial found no difference between N95 and medical masks, but was probably underpowered to detect any differences.\n11\n Further, the intervention in that study was use of respiratory protection only during care of identified febrile patients with ILI or high\u2010risk procedures. This is different from the intervention in our study, which comprised wearing the mask for the entire shift. In addition, that study measured serological evidence of influenza as an outcome, which comprised the majority of outcomes, but did not exclude influenza\u2010vaccinated participants, a flaw that would have resulted in false\u2010positive cases of \u2018influenza\u2019.\n\nThe finding that fit testing did not improve the efficacy of N95 respirators is important, although it could be explained by a lack of power. The value of fit testing varies with the quality of the respirator, and our study used a high\u2010quality respirator. These results would not be generalizable to other respirators, where fit testing may be more important. As such, we still recommend that fit testing be part of the process of using respirators.\n\nThe small number of randomization units along with the small numbers of cases means that estimation of multivariate models would not necessarily converge. In the post hoc multivariable analysis, we could not adjust for all of the factors because of high correlation among some of them.\n\nOther limitations of the study include the generalizability of our results to other types of respirators and to other HCW populations in other countries. Scoping work with Australian HCWs showed compliance of 10% with continual mask wearing during a severe influenza season.\n24\n Beijing was selected to maximize the power of the study because of the strong culture of mask wearing among HCWs. Another limitation of the study is that cluster RCTs can be impacted by heterogeneity of behaviours, meaning that we cannot exclude such effects caused by behaviours we did not measure. The cluster design is also strength, as interventions against infectious diseases can have herd effects. In infectious diseases which can spread from person to person, the \u2018herd effect\u2019 is a real and documented phenomenon where protecting some individuals with an intervention (most commonly vaccination, but also applicable to other interventions) can also protect individuals who were not protected by the intervention. Therefore, if some individuals are randomized to masks on a ward, the individuals who do not wear masks may also be protected because of the effect the masks have on interrupting the transmission of disease from person to person. This is why it is preferable to use cluster design, where everyone in the cluster gets the same intervention.\n\nIn our study, masks or respirators were worn during the entire shift. Some policies recommend mask/respirator use only when HCWs are conducting high\u2010risk procedures or entering an isolation room. Whether masks/respirators will be protective when used only when an identified episode of exposure occurs depends on whether HCWs accurately identify all episodes of risk, whether most transmission occurs after clearly identified exposures and whether there is transmission from asymptomatic or pre\u2010symptomatic infections. There is currently no evidence on how much of a HCWs\u2019 risk is unidentified or unrecognized. In our study, HCWs who conducted high\u2010risk procedures had higher rates of CRI, but not of laboratory\u2010confirmed pathogens or influenza. Further clinical research is required to determine the efficacy of continuous versus targeted mask use.\n\nUntil now, public health policy for dealing with pandemics has relied heavily on data from a modest number of often old and inadequate studies. Data from the SARS outbreak showed that masks reduced transmission of SARS and other viral respiratory infections.\n25\n, \n26\n During SARS, the use of N95 respirators and medical masks was the major protective infection control measure.\n27\n However, the relative contribution of each type or the difference between N95 respirators and medical masks cannot clearly be determined from observational data.\n\nProblems with adherence to mask/respirator use are also a potential problem. We showed that in Australia, less than half of parents who were randomized to wear a medical mask or respirator while their child was ill adhered with mask wearing.\n10\n There may be adverse effects of wearing masks, which can reduce adherence.\n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n Our study showed significantly higher reported adverse effects of N95 respirators compared to medical masks, consistent with other studies.\n28\n Interestingly, this population of Chinese HCWs reported overall similar rates of discomfort with masks as parents in our household study,\n10\n with higher rates in the N95 group, but it did not affect their adherence with mask/respirator wearing. This suggests that discomfort is not the primary driver of adherence, and rather, cultural acceptability and other behavioural factors may be the main reason for non\u2010adherence. The past experience of Beijing health workers with SARS may also be a factor in the high adherence. This level of adherence may not translate to Western cultural contexts in a normal winter season, especially for N95 respirators; however, adherence can change with perception of risk. During a pandemic, we would expect HCWs to have higher adherence to infection control measures. In summary, our study adds evidence on the use of respiratory protection for HCWs, but highlights the need for larger trials and comparison of different policy options.\n\nProfessor C.
