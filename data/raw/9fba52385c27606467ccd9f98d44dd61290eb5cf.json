{"title": "Houttuynia cordata inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced rapid pulmonary fibrosis by up-regulating IFN-\u03b3 and inhibiting the TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway", "body": "Traditionally, acute lung injury (ALI) causes pneumonedema and matrix lesions, rather than pulmonary fibrosis [1, 2] . However, the common characteristics of some new diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first studied in 2003, avian influenza first studied in 2008, and the swine influenza pandemic first studied in 2009, suggest that ALI may initiate these pathologies, and in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with rapid pulmonary fibrosis (RPF), ALI can be the most important lethal factor in the short-term [3] . Acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the mechanisms of repair and remodeling in acute lung injury have recently gained much attention [1, [4] [5] [6] . Based on the common characteristics and mechanisms of these diseases, we established a new RPF model that could be induced by ALI via a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) three-hit regimen and found that days 3-7 and 14-21 were two important time windows for RPF.\n\nHouttuynia cordata (HC), a grass of the Saururaceae H. cordata thumb, is a promising drug for treating RPF. The Chinese Health Department and a clinical report claimed that HC could prevent and treat SARS [7] and avian influenza [8, 9] . HC water extracts had immunomodulatory and anti-SARS activities, as evidenced by the ability to significantly inhibit SARS-CoV 3C-like protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [10] , which significantly and dose-dependently stimulated the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes and increased the proportion of CD4 (+) and CD8 (+) T cells and the secretion of IL-2 and IL-10. The HC ethanol extract inhibited the expression of International Immunopharmacology 13 (2012) 331-340 IL-4 and IL-5 and the migration of TARC-induced Jurkat T cells. The injection of HC had a direct inhibitory effect on Pseudorabies herpesvirus (PrV) in vitro [11] , and HC was shown to be a selective COX-2 inhibitor [12] . The volatile chemical components of HC are its main pharmacologically active components [13, 14] . Therefore, the volatile extract of HC might be an alternative drug for treating RPF.\n\nThe injection of HC produced from the volatile extract was suspended by the State Food and Drug Administration of China (SFDA) due to reports of allergic shock between 2006 and 2008; however, the use of Tween 80 as an adjuvant solution for the HC extract might be the primary cause of the reported allergic shock [15] . Afterwards, the SFDA re-approved the use of HC intramuscular injections and strengthened the standardization of its production and quality management to improve security. The research into HC active ingredients and their pharmacological mechanisms is indispensable.\n\nLPS (O555:B5) and dexamethasone (Dex) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, United States). HC vapor extract (999 Enterprise Group, China) was prepared as follows: fresh HC (2000 g) was exposed to steam distillation. The forerunning liquid (200 ml) was collected for redistillation. Then, 7 g of sodium chloride was added to the redistilled liquid (1000 ml).\n\nA total of 315 healthy Wistar rats (200 to 220 g, half male and half female) supplied by the Experimental Animals Center of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine were randomly allocated into 6 groups: 1) control group (n =35); 2) LPS group (n =56); 3) Dex group (n = 56); 4) group that received a high dose of HC (H-HC group, 16.5 mg/kg) (n =56); 5) group that received a medium dose of HC (M-HC group, 10 mg/kg) (n =56); and 6) group that received a low dose of HC (L-HC group, 3.5 mg/kg) (n =56).\n\nAll experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and efforts were made to minimize suffering.\n\nA detailed description of the model was published previously [16] . First, the rats were given LPS (1.5 mg/kg) intratracheally. After 24 h, LPS (3 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally, and 48 h later, LPS (3 mg/ kg) was given intratracheally. Two acute stages of development of pulmonary fibrosis were observed on days 7 to 9 and on days 14 to 21. After the rats received the third LPS administration, Dex (3 mg/kg) and HC were administered intraperitoneally once a day for 7 days. High, medium and low dosages of HC were determined on the basis of the clinical application in adults according to the FDA guidelines for industry and reviewers for estimating the safe starting dose in clinical trials for therapeutics in adult healthy volunteers. The collection of samples for testing began on day 1 (24 h after completing the third LPS administration). Blood and lung tissue samples were taken on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. The rats were infused with 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the tissue. The middle lobes of the right lung were embedded in paraffin and sliced into 5 \u03bcm sections for H&E and VG staining.\n\n2.5 . Testing blood samples, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cell counting, and determining lung dry/wet weight Blood and BALF samples from the right basement trunk were used for cell counting and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) testing. The samples were analyzed by the laboratory of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Serum cytokines were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immune-absorbent assay (ELISA). Tissue (100 mg, wet weight) from the same location was dried until a constant weight (dry weight) was obtained. The dry weight subtracted from the wet weight indicates the water content, representing the level of inflammation, and the dry/wet weight ratio is the lung parenchyma weight ratio, representing the level of fibrosis. The extracted total protein of the lung was preserved with protease inhibitors (Calbiochem) for the western blotting assay.\n\nWet tissue (100 mg) from the middle lobe of the right lung was used to determine hydroxyprolone (Hyp) content using the alkaline hydrolysis kit (Jiancheng Bioengin., Nanjing, China).\n\nThe expressions of IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and TGF-\u03b21 in the plasma from rats and the supernatant from cell lines were investigated using an ELISA kit (Zymed, Invitrogen, USA). The absorbance at 450 nm was analyzed using an Elx 808 TM absorbance microplate reader (Bio Tek, USA).\n\nEndogenous peroxidase was extracted with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 , 30 min), and the sections were blocked with blocking buffer (5% BSA and 0.03% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. The samples were then incubated with monoclonal anti-IFN-\u03b3, anti-IL-4, anti-TGF-\u03b21/TGF-\u03b2 receptor I, Smad2/3, Smad4, and Smad7 antibodies (all from Santa Cruz, USA) or an anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (Abcam, Cambridge) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h or at 4\u00b0C for 18 h. Then, the sections were incubated with a secondary antibody at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled Vectastain Elite ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase binding was detected in 0.005% diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 0.01% H 2 O 2 .\n\nThe extracted protein samples from the lungs and cell lines were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane at 0.8 mA/cm 2 for 2 h. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk dissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T). The membranes were washed with TBS-T and incubated with monoclonal anti-IFN-\u03b3, anti-IL-4, anti-TGF-\u03b21/TGF-\u03b2 receptor I, anti-Smad2/3, anti-Smad4, anti-Smad7 (all from Santa Cruz, USA), anti-STAT1 (Abcam, Cambridge), anti-STAT6 (Cell Signaling Technology, USA) and anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, USA) antibodies at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. Finally, the membranes were treated with HRP-conjugated IgG (Sigma, USA) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL western blotting substrate, Pierce Biotechnology, USA).\n\nThe supernatant from the HC vapor extract was analyzed using an Agilent 6890 N+5973 N GC-MS (USA) equipped with a 30 m\u00d7 0.25 mm\u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm DB-1MS quartz microcapillary chromatographic column (Agilent J&W Scientific) after extraction with 2 ml of cyclohexane and dehydrated alcohol demulsification. The GC oven temperature was held at 60\u00b0C for 1 min, raised to 220\u00b0C at 6\u00b0C/min, and held for 3 min. The injector temperature was 250\u00b0C, and the flow rate of the carrier gas, helium, was 1.3 ml/min at a 60:1 split ratio. The diluted samples (1.0 \u03bcl, 1/100 v/v, in ethyl acetate) were injected manually in the split mode. The major components of the HC vapor extract were identified by co-injection with standards wherever possible and confirmed with Kovats indices using the Wiley (V. 7.0) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) V2.0 GC-MS library. The relative concentration of each compound in essential oil was quantified based on the peak area integrated by the analysis program.\n\nMurine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 and embryonic fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells (Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of humidified 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C. At 80%-90% confluence, the RAW264.7 and NIH/3T3 cells were washed twice with, and subsequently cultured in, serum-free OPTI-MEMI medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After pre-incubation for 12 h, cell cultures were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) and co-treated with the HC vapor extract and the active ingredients detected by GC-MS. Cell viability was determined with an MTT assay, and the levels of inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, TGF-\u03b21 and TNF-\u03b1, were determined using an ELISA assay.\n\nData were analyzed as the mean\u00b1 SD for each group. The difference between groups was analyzed with a factorial model ANOVA followed by Student's t-test. SPSS 11.5 (the software for statistical analysis) was used to perform all analyses, and P b 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\n\nAll H&E stained slides were examined by 3 investigators who were experienced in pneumonia pathology, and the majority decision was considered final (Supplement Table 1 , Supplement Fig. 1A-T) . The result showed that in the LPS group, there were a large number of monocytes and neutrophils in the alveolar spaces, and the alveolar inflammatory exudation was reduced in a dose-and time-dependent manner in the HC groups. The results suggest that HC vapor extract can reduce ALI. Table 2 : The lymphocyte ratio in the blood samples from the LPS group decreased from days 1 to 7 and returned to the same level as that of the control group on day 9. Compared with the LPS group, Dex reduced the lymphocyte ratio significantly (P b 0.01); however, the levels in the three HC groups were significantly higher than those in the LPS and Dex groups on day 7 (P b 0.01). The ratio of mononuclear phagocytes in BALF (Fig. 1B , Supplement Table 3 ) in the three HC groups on day 7 and day 14 was significantly higher than that in the LPS and Dex groups (P b 0.01). The ratios changed in a dose-dependent manner. The results suggest that HC vapor extract can regulate the lymphocyte ratio.\n\nFig. 1 C, Supplement Table 4 : LDH levels in all treatment groups were significantly lower than those in the LPS group (Pb 0.01). LDH levels in the HC groups were lower than those in the Dex group on day 14. The results suggest that HC can reduce ALI. Fig. 1D , Supplement Table 5 : The Hyp content increased significantly in the LPS group (Pb 0.01) from day 3 to day 7 and from day 14 to day 21, representing two distinct RPF stages. The Hyp content in the H-HC group was significantly lower than that in the LPS and Dex groups on day 21 (Pb 0.01), indicating that the high-dose HC vapor extract had a better inhibitory effect on the later RPF stage.\n\n3.1.5 . Lung dry/wet weight ratio Fig. 1E , Supplement Table 6 : Pulmonary fibrosis was inhibited on days 14-21 in a dose-dependent manner in the HC groups, and it was inhibited more significantly in the H-HC group. These results suggest that HC can reduce RPF. Fig. 2A -T: In the LPS group, collagen fibers were progressively deposited in the alveolar septum from days 1 to 28, and pulmonary consolidation was found on day 28 ( Fig. 2A-D) . Compared with the LPS group, fiber deposition was decreased in the Dex group (Fig. 2E-H) . Compared with the Dex and LPS groups, fiber deposition was decreased significantly in the M-HC and H-HC groups on days 14 and 28 (Fig. 2 , K > 2G > 2O > 2S and 2D > 2H > 2L > 2P > 2T). In addition, the decreasing of fiber deposistion in alveolar septum was consistent in the H-HC group was consistent with that in (Fig. 2T) , suggesting that HC vapor extract might improve the alveolar framework and enhance alveolar ventilation. The results suggest that the HC vapor extract can reduce RPF in a dosedependent manner.\n\nThe serum ELISA results showed that IFN-\u03b3 expression decreased rapidly between days 1 and 7 and continued to decline gradually on day 14 in the LPS group (Fig. 3A , Supplement Table 7) . IFN-\u03b3 expression decreased gradually from days 1 to 28 in the three HC groups, with the smallest decline observed in the H-HC group. The three HC groups showed high IFN-\u03b3 expression levels on days 7-21, suggesting that the HC vapor extract up-regulated IFN-\u03b3 secretion during days 7-21. This finding was consistent with the results of the western blotting (Fig. 4) and immunohistochemistry (Supplement Fig. 2 ) experiments and was further supported by the results from NIH/3T3 cells treated with HC. STAT1 is a downstream signaling molecule of IFN-\u03b3. Western blotting results showed that STAT1 expression was synchronized with IFN-\u03b3 expression in all groups on day 1. However, the synchrony was disrupted on day 7. IFN-\u03b3 expression in the HC groups was higher than that in the LPS and Dex groups on day 7, and STAT1 expression in the HC groups was lower than that in the LPS and Dex groups on day 7 (Fig. 4) , suggesting that HC might inhibit STAT1 expression through a non-IFN-\u03b3 pathway or that HC vapor extract might upregulate IFN-\u03b3 expression through a non-STAT1 pathway.\n\nThe serum ELISA results (Fig. 3B, Supplement Table 8 ) showed that IL-4 expression peaked on day 7 in all groups, which is consistent with the western blotting results. The western blotting results from the lung tissues (Fig. 4) showed that IL-4 expression was high in the LPS, Dex and L-HC groups but weak in the M-and H-HC groups on day 1. IL-4 expression increased on day 7 and decreased on day 28 in all groups. STAT6 expression (Fig. 4) changed along with IL-4 expression. There was no significant difference in IL-4 expression between the HC groups and the Dex group, suggesting that the HC vapor extract affected IL-4/STAT6 signaling in a similar manner as Dex.\n\nThe serum ELISA results showed that TGF-\u03b21 expression increased from days 1 to 21 in the LPS group (Fig. 3C, Supplement Table 9 ). TGF-\u03b21 expression in the Dex group was dramatically and persistently lower than that in the LPS group from days 1 to 28 (P b 0.01). TGF-\u03b21 expression in the HC groups increased from days 1 to 7 and decreased from days 7 to 28. The ELISA results showed that, compared with the LPS group, TGF-\u03b21 expression in the HC groups decreased in a dose-dependent manner, which was consistent with the western blotting (Fig. 4) and immunohistochemistry (Supplement Fig. 2 ) results. Our results indicate that HC inhibited TGF-\u03b21 expression. Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3) are downstream signaling molecules of TGF-\u03b21. The western blotting (Fig. 4) and immunohistochemical (Supplement Fig. 3 ) results showed that changes in Smad2/3 expression were consistent with the changes in TGF-\u03b21 expression in all groups on days 1, 7 and 28.\n\nSmad4 is the synergistic Smad of Smad2/3. The western blotting (Fig. 4) and immunohistochemical (Supplement Fig. 3 ) results showed that on day 1, Smad4 was expressed at high levels in all groups, with no significant differences among the groups. In the LPS and Dex groups, Smad4 expression was high on day 7, suggesting that Smad4 contributed to the first RPF stage. Therefore, the down-regulation of Smad4 expression on days 1-7 in the HC groups might be an important molecular mechanism through which the HC vapor extract inhibits RPF.\n\nSmad7 is the antagonistic Smad of Smad2/3 signaling. The western blotting (Fig. 4) and immunohistochemical (Supplement Fig. 3) results showed that Smad7 expression was higher on day 7 than on day 1 in all groups and was weak in the LPS and Dex groups on day 28; however, the expression remained high in the HC groups in a dose-dependent manner. This suggests that the HC vapor extract up-regulates Smad7.\n\nWe tested three groups of HC vapor extract using GC-MS (Fig. 5) and found that the active ingredients of HC vapor extract were composed of 4-terpineol (42.77 \u00b1 5.61%), \u03b1-terpineol (16.55 \u00b1 3.44%), L-bornyl acetate (2.60 \u00b1 0.21%) and methyl-n-nonyl ketone (38.08 \u00b1 2.00%). The HC content of these four components was stable across groups, accounting for 80.61-91.68% of the total amount, with an average content of 86.99%. In contrast, other components were : the pulmonary interstitium broadened significantly, the number of collagen fibers increased, and the pulmonary interstitium was restructured. LPS on days 14-28 (C, D, \u00d7 100): the red collagen fibers thickened dramatically and formed bunches or sheets indicative of pulmonary fibrosis. Dex inhibited inflammation exudation dramatically. On day 1 (E, \u00d7 100), the collagen fibers in the alveolar spaces were normal, the alveoli were intact, and there were fewer inflammatory cells in the interstitial space and alveolar spaces. Dex on days 7 and 14 (F, G, \u00d7100): the pulmonary interstitium thickened, the inflammatory exudation in alveolar spaces increased, and the interstitial collagen fibers thickened. Dex on day 28 (H, \u00d7100): the interstitial space thickened and consolidated significantly, and the alveolar spaces narrowed. HC groups on day 1 (I, M, Q, \u00d7 100): the interstitial space was normal. HC on days 7 to 28 (N, \u00d7100): the pulmonary interstitial collagen fibers proliferated persistently, and the interstitial space thickened. L-HC group on day 28 (L, \u00d7100): the number of interstitial cells increased, and the alveoli narrowed. M-HC and H-HC groups (P, T, \u00d7100): the interstitial space thickened, and the number of collagen fibers increased significantly, but the alveoli were normal. present in smaller quantities (13.02 \u00b1 5.72%) and were not as stable across the groups, suggesting that they are not responsible for the main pharmacological effect. Therefore, we choose \u03b1-terpineol, L-bornyl acetate and methyl-n-nonyl ketone to study the potential pharmacological mechanism of the four components. Some reports [17] have proposed that sodium houttuyfonate (SH) was the effective component of HC. Thus, we used HC as the positive control. RAW264.7 and NIH/3T3 cells are typical immune and fibroblast cells, respectively. These are two important cell types involved in damage and repair. We observed the viability of RAW264.7 and NIH/3T3 cells after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of treatment with the HC vapor extract (10%, 30%, 50%; HC), \u03b1-terpineol (0.1 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, 1 mg/ml), L-bornyl acetate (2.5 \u03bcl/ml, 5 \u03bcl/ml, 10 \u03bcl/ml), methyl-n-nonyl ketone (1 \u03bcl/ml, 2 \u03bcl/ml, 4 \u03bcl/ml) and SH (32 \u03bcg/ml, 64 \u03bcg/ml, 128 \u03bcg/ml). After 48 h, LPS (100 ng/ml), HC vapor extract, SH and \u03b1-terpineol inhibited the viability of RAW264.7 cells, but L-bornyl acetate enhanced viability significantly and dose-dependently (Fig. 6A ). In addition, HC vapor extract, \u03b1-terpineol and L-bornyl acetate inhibited the viability of NIH/3T3 cells significantly and dose-dependently (Fig. 6B) . We also observed the viability of cells 24 h and 72 h after being treated with LPS or without treatment with LPS. The results show that the HC vapor extract can inhibit the viability of RAW264.7 and NIH/3T3 cells.\n\nWe used ELISA to analyze the concentrations of TGF-\u03b21 and IFN-\u03b3 in the NIH/3T3 supernatant after 48 h of treatment with LPS ( Fig. 7A and B). HC and \u03b1-terpineol up-regulated IFN-\u03b3 expression, but L-bornyl acetate inhibited it significantly and dose-dependently. HC inhibited TGF-\u03b21 expression, but SH up-regulated it significantly and dosedependently. The results suggest that the HC vapor extract inhibits TGF-\u03b21 and enhances IFN-\u03b3 secretion from NIH/3T3 cells in a dosedependent manner.\n\nIn this investigation, we applied the volatile extract of HC to the RPF rat model and found that HC could repair RPF through upregulating IFN-\u03b3 and inhibiting the TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway. Moreover, we found that the volatile components of the HC vapor extract were mainly composed of 4-terpineol, \u03b1-terpineol, L-bornyl acetate and methyl-n-nonyl ketone. HC inhibited the viability of NIH/3T3 and RAW264.7 cells. HC inhibited TGF-\u03b21 secretion and enhanced IFN-\u03b3 secretion from NIH/3T3 cells, suggesting that these effects might contribute to the results observed in vivo. Interestingly, \u03b1-terpineol, L-bornyl acetate and SH had diverse effects on NIH/3T3 and RAW264.7 cells, suggesting that the volatile extract of HC has complicated mechanisms of action through which it affects ALI and RPF.\n\nRecent studies have found that the active ingredients of the HC water extract, such as \u03b1-terpineol and L-bornyl acetate, had strong anti-tumor, anti-virus, anti-pneumonia and anti-pulmonary fibrosis effects [10, 18] . \u03b1-Terpineol has been suggested as a potential anticancer agent that suppresses NF-\u03baB signaling [19] , and L-bornyl acetate has been shown to inhibit nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW264.7 macrophages [20] . An HC water extract remarkably improved the morphological appearance of the lung in bleomycin-treated rats and exhibited a protective effect against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis [21] . Our investigation found that \u03b1-terpineol dose-dependently enhanced IFN-\u03b3, but L-bornyl acetate had the opposite effect (Fig. 7A) . The HC vapor extract inhibited TGF-\u03b21, while SH did not (Fig. 7B) , suggesting that \u03b1-terpineol, L-bornyl acetate and SH might have different pharmacological actions on ALI and AFP.\n\nIt has been suggested that Th2 polarization might be a necessary condition of ALI-induced fibrosis [16, 22] . In the LPS group, we observed Th2 polarizations. IFN-\u03b3 expression decreased consistently, and IL-4 and TGF-\u03b21 expression increased consistently, which further induced RPF. The period from days 3 to 7 constituted the first stage of RPF, and the second stage of RPF was from days 14 to 21. HC and Dex did not show obvious differences in anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects on days 3-7, and HC showed better anti-inflammatory and antifibrosis effects than Dex on days 14-21. Compared with Dex, HC appropriately improved immune stress status by up-regulating the lympocytes/mononuclear phagocytes ratio on day 7, which might be more advantageous (Fig. 1A and B) . IFN-\u03b3, as a Th1 cytokine with multiple functions, has proinflammatory, anti-viral and anti-fibrosis effects [23, 24] . IFN-\u03b3 inhibited influenza virus type A [25] and SARS-CoV replication [24] in vitro, suggesting that up-regulating IFN-\u03b3 may increase the survival of SARS patients. IFN-\u03b3 expression declined in the LPS group, suggesting that the immune system was suppressed to induce RPF. The HC vapor extract increased IFN-\u03b3 expression on days 7-21, and the results from the NIH/3T3 cells showed that \u03b1-terpineol might be the active ingredient of the HC vapor extract that up-regulates IFN-\u03b3 expression. The HCinduced up-regulation of IFN-\u03b3 expression was not accompanied by an up-regulation in STAT1 expression, suggesting that the HC vapor extract might inhibit the pro-inflammatory STAT1 pathway. Thus, the upregulation of IFN-\u03b3 might be an important mechanism through which HC reduces RPF.\n\nTGF-\u03b21, as a Th2 cytokine with multiple functions, plays an important role in pulmonary fibrosis [26] [27] [28] . In ALI, TGF-\u03b21 inhibited inflammation and improved repair. In RPF, TGF-\u03b21 was up-regulated further to prompt fibrosis, and Smad4 and Smad7 were suggested to be involved in crucial molecular mechanisms of RPF [16] . In our investigation, the HC vapor extract inhibited the TGF-\u03b21 signal via the Smad2/"}
