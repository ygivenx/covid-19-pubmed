CONCLUSIONS: Rhinovirus is the major viral trigger for pediatric asthma in Trinidad and is not associated with seasonality in this tropical climate. \n\nWe hypothesize that children identified as wheezers will present with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and decreased levels of anti-viral cytokines in nasal lavage samples during symptomatic RV infection compared to non-wheezers during symptomatic RV infection. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, children enrolled in the Childhood Origins of ASThma (COAST) project provided nasal lavage samples during symptomatic respiratory infections and at scheduled well visits at ages 5 and 6 years. Children with a history of wheezing were sampled when well, during an uncomplicated cold and during a wheezing illness. Children with no history of wheezing were sampled when well and ruing an uncomplicated cold. Innate cytokine profiles were assayed using a Beadlyte\u00d2 Human Multi-Cytokine Flex Kit, and detection of the cytokines were evaluated using the Luminex 100\u00e4 IS for the following cytokines: IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 (p40), IFN-g, IFN-a, and TNF-a. Interleukin-8 levels were evaluated by ELISA. RESULTS: Interleukin-6, IL-10, IFN-g, and IL-8 were present in measurable concentrations. Concentrations of IL-6 were significantly higher during symptomatic RV infection than when well (14.6 vs. 9.91, p<0.001). The % detectability of IL-10 and IFN-g were significantly higher during symptomatic RV infection than when well (23.9 vs. 5.0, p50.045; 54.3 vs. 0, p50.022 respectively). Concentrations of IFN-g tended to be higher in non-wheezers than in wheezers during symptomatic RV infection (13.9 vs. 8.1, p50.077). CONCLUSIONS: During symptomatic RV illness, non-wheezers presented with higher levels of IFN-g than wheezers, suggesting the possibility that wheezers may have a depressed anti-viral response, which may not be as effective at fighting viral infections.
