{"title": "More targeted use of oseltamivir and in-hospital isolation facilities after implementation of a multifaceted strategy including a rapid molecular diagnostic panel for respiratory viruses in immunocompromised adult patients", "body": "Respiratory viruses are increasingly recognized as important causative pathogens in acute respiratory tract infections (RTI) in up to 50% of patients, depending on the season in which these viruses are detected [1] [2] [3] . Moreover, the number of immunocompromised patients is increasing due to ageing of the population, increased prevalence of chronic diseases as well as treatment with immunosuppressive agents [4, 5] . Although immunocompromised patients have similar etiologies of acute RTI when compared to immunocompetent patients [6] , they more often have a complicated course of the disease leading to high healthcare burden, especially in secondary and tertiary care settings [7, 8] [9, 10] . Rapid and accurate detection of respiratory viruses by molecular diagnostics might lead to more targeted use of in-hospital isolation facilities [11] and improvement of other clinical outcomes due to more targeted antibiotic and antiviral therapy [12] . However, current evidence on the effect of implementation of rapid molecular testing on clinical outcomes and hospital resource use is heterogeneous and inconclusive. Most studies only focus on immunocompetent patients, do not specifically address the viral respiratory season, are of low quality due to their design or lack of proper adjustment for potential confounders [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , whereas randomized studies [11, [23] [24] [25] [26] evaluating effects within a research setting with perfect implementation of diagnostic assays, may lead to over-optimistic results.\n\nIn the current study, we therefore aimed to assess the effect of rapid molecular diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses implemented in regular care presenting with suspected RTI in a tertiary University Medical Centre (UMC).\n\nWe performed an observational before-after cohort study. Patients were included at the emergency department (ED) of the UMC Utrecht, a 1042 bedded teaching hospital and a referral center for, among others, treatment of hematological malignancies, organ transplantation and HIV, located in the center of the Netherlands. Patients \u226518 years were included when they were immunocompromised at the time of presentation and presented with the clinical suspicion of a RTI, which was defined according to the definition of the World Health Organization, with measured fever of \u226538\u00b0C, cough and onset within the last 10 days [27] . Pneumonia was defined as having visible new infiltrates at chest X-ray. Immunocompromised was defined as the use of corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent, cumulative dose > 700 mg), anti-CD20 therapy, biologicals (TNF-alpha inhibitors, interleukin-5 inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies), methotrexate, azathioprine and/or mercaptopurine within the last 6 months, having received an autologous/allogenic stem-cell transplantation, having neutropenia (< 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L), (functional) hypo/asplenia, CD4-penia (< 200 cells/mm 3 ), hypogammaglobinemia and/or having another primary immunodeficiency. The primary endpoints were the use of antibiotics < 72 h after ED presentation, oseltamivir use and the use of in-hospital isolation facilities, e.g. private rooms with appropriate droplet precautions to avoid further circulation of respiratory viruses, in admitted patients. Secondary outcomes included hospital admissions, the duration of empiric antibiotic treatment (until switch or discontinuation), duration of oseltamivir treatment and the length of hospital stay and the length of stay inhospital isolation facilities in admitted patients. Furthermore, we assessed adverse outcomesdefined as 30-day mortality and/or intensive care admission (composite endpoint), representation at the ED and hospital readmission within 30 daysand potential disadvantageous effects, defined as length of ED stay, the use of additional common diagnostics for RTI, e.g. blood cultures, sputum cultures, Streptococcus pneumoniae urine antigen tests (PUAT) and Legionella pneumophilia urine antigen tests (LUAT), and > 1 chest X-ray within the first 72 h of admission.\n\nData were collected from the electronic patient files and the hospital clinical microbial system (GLIMS version 9.5). The study obtained ethical approval from the UMC Utrecht local ethics committee during both seasons (protocol numbers 16-692/C and 17-659/17-659/C).\n\nDuring the first season, in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for the detection of respiratory viruses [28] . Nucleic acids were extracted using the total nucleic acid protocol with the MagNA Pure LC nucleic acid isolation system (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). For detection of RNA viruses using the Universal Master Mix, cDNA was synthesized first using MultiScribe RT and random hexamers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Detection of viral pathogens was performed in parallel, using laboratory developed RT-PCR assays specific for the following viruses: respiratory syncytial virus; influenza virus A and B; parainfluenza virus 1-4; rhinoviruses; bocaviruses; enteroviruses; adenoviruses; human coronaviruses OC43, [29] . The cut-off value for a positive result was set at a Cycle threshold (Ct) value < 45 [30] . Right before the second season we implemented a rapid molecular diagnostic test with a reported mean turnaround time of 2.3 h (SD 1.4 h) [11] -the FilmArray\u00ae respiratory viral panel version 1.7 (BioFire Diagnostics) -for simultaneous detection of a panel of respiratory viruses similar to the in-house RT-PCR. Additionally, the FilmArray\u00ae detects a couple of bacterial pathogens, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, for which the assay however was not validated in our laboratory and results were neither reported for clinical practice nor for this study. The FilmArray\u00ae contains all needed reagents in a freeze-dried format for extraction, amplification, and detection steps. The FilmArray\u00ae test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, prior to run 1 ml of hydration solution and 300 \u03bcl of respiratory sample was added to the reagent pouch. The pouch was then placed on the FilmArray\u00ae instrument and the test performed using the FilmArray\u00ae system. After extraction and purification of all nucleic acids from the sample, a nested multiplex PCR is performed followed by an individual singleplex second-stage PCR reactions to detect the products from the first-stage nested PCR. The FilmArray\u00ae was available as diagnostic assay on weekdays between 8am-8pm and on weekend days and national holidays between 8-12 am. If samples were collected outside these opening hours, the rapid test was performed the following morning. Instructions on nasopharyngeal sampling were similar for the in-house RT-PCR and the FilmArray\u00ae and both tests were ordered by sending the sample plus application form to the clinical virology laboratory. All respiratory samples were collected in universal transport media and transported similarly, both the in-house RT-PCR and the FilmArray\u00ae were located in the clinical virology laboratory and handled in a standardized manner by trained technicians and all results were subsequently approved by a clinical virologist. Results of the rapid assay were directly reported to the treating physician by phone as were the positive test results of the in-house RT-PCR. In addition, results of both assays were reported in the electronic patient file.\n\nDuring both seasons, the decision to perform microbiological procedures was left to the treating physician. Bacteria were defined causative when found in PUAT/LUAT, bronchoalveolar lavage culture, blood culture (in absence of another infection source) and/or accurately performed (< 10 squamous epithelial cells and > 25 neutrophils per low power field) sputum culture meeting pathogen-specific threshold criteria [31, 32] . Furthermore, we enforced specific ED instructions for the management of patients presenting with a suspected RTI during the respiratory viral season (Supplementary Text 1) . These instructions contained a flowchart and guideline for decision making on a (rapid) molecular diagnostic test performance, treatment with oseltamivir for (suspected) influenza and ribavirin [33, 34] for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and application of in-hospital isolation facilities for (suspected) influenza virus, RSV, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus and/or parainfluenza virus. The implementation procedure consisted of plenary instructions for ED nurses and internal medicine and pulmonology physicians, distribution of pocket cards and a launch of all instructions on the internal hospital protocol website.\n\nAnalyses were performed using SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp, 2012). Multiple imputations were used to account for missing data. We used both determinants, confounders and outcome variables in the imputation model and we imputed missing values under the assumption of missingness at random. Differences between patients included during the first and second season were assessed by univariate analysis using a Pearson's Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for differences in proportions for binary variables and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables, as appropriate. We compared outcomes between the two seasons using adjusted odds or risk ratios with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from multiple logistic or (log) linear regression, controlling for age, all covariates with an univariate p-value < 0.2 [35] and differences in viral prevalence for outcomes on antivirals and in-hospital isolation facilities. Stratified analyses were performed for influenza virus positive and negative patients for the use of oseltamivir. A pvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nDuring the two inclusion periods, 1543 patients presented with a suspected RTI, of whom 570 patients (36.9%) were immunocompromised. Patients had a median age of 62 years (interquartile range 50-70), 53.3% (n = 304) were male and 39.6% (n = 226) had a pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ( Table 1) . Of these 570 patients, 192 patients (33.7%) were included during the 19 weeks inclusion period within the 2016/2017 respiratory viral season and 378 patients (66.3%) were included during the 22 weeks inclusion period within the 2017/2018 season (Fig. 1) . During the second season, more patients had COPD (45.8% vs 27.6%, p < 0.001). Both seasons had a comparable proportion of patients with signs of pneumonia, 86 patients (44.8%) vs 160 patients (42.3%) (p = 0.57). Overall, antibiotics were prescribed in 71.4% of patients, in 147 patients (76.5%) in first season and 260 (68.8%) in the second season. Overall, 61.7% received beta-lactam antibiotic monotherapy, e.g. amoxicillin, penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefazolin or ceftazidime, and 9.6% beta-lactam antibiotics in combination with macrolides or fluoroquinolones. There were no differences between the two seasons in the proportion of patients who received narrow or broad spectrum antibiotic therapy or atypical coverage.\n\nOf all patients tested during the first season (n = 135), 61 (45.2%) tested virus positive versus 169 (59.5%) patients during the second season (n = 284). Overall, influenza A and B virus were the most frequently identified viruses and accounted for 46.5% of all detected viral pathogens ( Implementation of the rapid molecular test and ED instructions led to a reduction in patients treated with oseltamivir (41.7% vs 27.8%, p < 0.001) ( Table 3) . When stratified, we observed that influenza virus positive patients received more oseltamivir prescriptions (70.8% vs 89.2%, p = 0.011) and influenza virus negative patients fewer (37.5% vs 7.7%, p < 0.001). Also, the number of admitted patients who needed in-hospital isolation facilities was significantly reduced (56.4% vs 41.7%, p = 0.001). We observed no significant effect on the proportion of patients who received empirical antibiotic treatment within 72 h of ED presentation (76.6% in the first season vs 68.8% in the second season, p = 0.458) or on the duration of antibiotics. Furthermore, we observed no effect on hospital admissions, length of hospital stay in admitted patients, the number of PUAT and LUAT taken at the ED, and the proportion of admitted patients receiving more than one chest X-ray within the first 72 h of admission. Also, there was no difference in any adverse outcomes between the two seasons. Significant disadvantageous effects were observed on the number of blood cultures taken at the ED (75.5% vs 74.3%, p = 0.017), the number of sputum cultures (27.6% vs 38.1%, p = 0.046) and length of stay at the ED (3:43 h vs 4:01 h, p = 0.020). When stratified based on admission, a significant increase in ED stay was only observed in non-admitted patients (p = 0.035) and not in admitted patients (p = 0.192).\n\nWe assessed the effects of implementation of a rapid molecular diagnostic panel for respiratory viruses and specific ED instructions in immunocompromised adult patients presenting at the ED during the respiratory viral season. Implementation of these diagnostic interventions resulted in more targeted use of oseltamivir and in-hospital isolation facilities, without evidence of an increase in adverse outcomes. This is in line with a previous randomized study assessing the effect of rapid testing for respiratory viruses in mainly immunocompetent patients that observed an increase in oseltamivir use from 65% to 91% in influenza virus positive patients [11] . More targeted use of oseltamivir in influenza positive patients may not only lead to better individual patient outcomes [36] , but may also lead to more rapidly decreased viral loads and thereby reduce secondary infections [37, 38] . Additionally, the reduction of prescriptions in influenza virus negative patients (38% to 8%) may lead to less side effects [39] . A decrease in use of in-hospital isolation measurements, which is in line with the results of the same large randomized study [11] , partially solves the recurrent logistical problem of a shortage in hospital beds during the crowded respiratory viral season. We did not perform an official costsbenefit analysis. However, based on the \u20achr concept [40] a substantial beneficial effect can be expected, since the rapid diagnostic test is as expensive as in-house RT-PCR in our setting and the implementation of specific instructions do not involve substantial costs, while the median turnaround time and isolation days are reduced considerably.\n\nRapid molecular testing for respiratory viruses did not reduce antibiotic prescriptions and the duration of antibiotic treatment in immunocompromised patients. The lack of significant results on these outcomes might be due to insufficient power of our study, and due to our vulnerable, immunocompromised patient population, in whom withholding or discontinuing antibiotic treatment is not according to (inter)national recommendations. Nevertheless, these results are in line with most former studies, mostly among immunocompetent patients, that also showed no reduction in antibiotic prescriptions [11, 14, 19, 22, 24, 41, 42] . Only two observational studies [15, 16] showed a significant effect, but both validity and generalizability were problematic in these studies due to inadequate adjustment for potential confounders and specific patient selection [15] . The duration of antibiotic treatment was reduced in only one study among otherwise healthy children with uncomplicated acute RTI [14] , whereas all studies among adult patients observed no effect [11, 19, [24] [25] [26] 41, 43] . Even though most studies show no effect on antibiotics, there might still be potential for rapid molecular testing for respiratory viruses in antibiotic stewardship programs. This is supported by a randomized study that observed a significant reduction in single dose antibiotic prescriptions and antibiotics prescribed for less than 48 h [11] . Clear instructions or guidelines on whether to withhold antibiotics or to prescribe narrow spectrum antibiotics should however accompany the introduction of rapid molecular test for respiratory viruses to have maximum effect [43] .\n\nIn contrast to similar studies, we were unable to show a reduction in the number of hospital admissions or length of hospital stay [11, 41] , which might also have resulted from our vulnerable patient population, a lack of power and the absence of 24/7 availability of the rapid molecular test, resulting in longer assay turnaround times overnight and during weekends. The absence of a difference in adverse events between the two seasons was similar to other studies [11, 14, 16, 21, 24, 43] . The increase in the length of patient ED stay, especially in non-admitted patients, might be explained by waiting time for rapid viral test results, although we had no formal numbers on the proportion of patients for whom the rapid test result was available before leaving the ED, e.g. for clinical and bed management decision making. However, given the intense and crowded viral season of 2017/2018 with twice as many patients as during the previous season, this might also have resulted from overall longer ED turnaround times during the second season. Anyhow, rapid acquirement of respiratory samples, subsequent transportation to the laboratory and sufficient capacity of the rapid diagnostic test might reduce turnaround times of the results and thereby waiting times at the ED.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the effect of regular care implemented rapid molecular testing for respiratory viruses in immunocompromised adult patients. Other studies have focused on immunocompetent patients, which make former results less applicable in tertiary care centers with a large proportion of immunocompromised patients. Furthermore, with our non-randomized design in which the implementation of the rapid diagnostics for respiratory viruses during the second season was not 100%, we provide a truthful reflection of daily practice. Our study also has several limitations. First, given the before-after design of the study, outcomes can be biased due to residual confounders. However, we thoroughly adjusted our analyses for differences at baseline using a liberal p-value to select confounding factors and differences in viral pathogens for certain clinical outcomes. We thereby reduced the effect of confounders more thoroughly than former before-after studies on rapid molecular testing [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 41] . Second, differences between the two seasons might also have been affected by trends in time not resulting from the diagnostic intervention per se. Adjustment for any possible trends in time with an interrupted time series analysis would have been appropriate. However, due to the short timeframe in this study and a limited number of patients per time point, this analysis was not feasible [44] . Also, we tried to maximize the potential effect of rapid testing by accompanying the implementation of this assay with specific instructions for the ED, by which we limited the possibility to distinguish the effect of the instructions and the rapid test as a sole intervention. Finally, our study was a single center study and clinical outcomes as antibiotic and antiviral prescriptions might be influenced by local protocols and guidelines, making results potentially less generalizable to other settings.\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates that implementation of a rapid molecular test for the detection of respiratory viruses in adult immunocompromised patients who present at the ED with acute RTI, results in more targeted use of oseltamivir and in-hospital isolation facilities. The standard use of a rapid molecular test for respiratory viruses may therefore be recommended for these patients in daily practice.\n\nThe diagnostic intervention was designed and implemented by LV, AR and JJO.
