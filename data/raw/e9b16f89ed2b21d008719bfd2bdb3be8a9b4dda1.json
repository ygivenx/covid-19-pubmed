They occur widely among mammals, and the secretory pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (CPB) is generally taken to be the most representative member of this class of enzymes [1] . Although pancreatic CPB is responsible for the intestinal digestion of food proteins and peptides, the other basic carboxypeptidases are not digestive enzymes but have regulatory e\u00a1ects on the activity of biological peptides such as anaphylatoxins, enkephalins and bradykinins [1] . Since all the mammalian basic carboxypeptidases have similar enzymatic activities, they may play di\u00a1erent roles in vivo, depending on their localization and physical properties.\n\nHuman plasma CPN (which is also known as kininase I) is synthesized in the liver and released into the bloodstream in the form of a large tetrameric complex (280 kDa) containing two active subunits (48^55 kDa) and two inactive glycosylated subunits (83 kDa), the latter of which stabilize the active ones and keep them in the solubilized form [2, 3] . Since CPN has mainly been found in circulating blood, its most likely function seems to be to protect the organism from the action of potent vasoactive and in\u00a3ammatory peptides such as kinins and/or anaphylatoxins [1, 4] . A plasma pro-CPB of hepatic origin which is structurally similar to pancreatic pro-CPB has recently been identi\u00a2ed as a circulating protein, isolated from the blood, and found to form a non-covalent association with other plasma proteins [5, 6] . Unlike pancreatic CPB, which has a purely digestive function, plasma CPB might be involved in \u00a2brinolysis and has been de\u00a2ned as a thrombin activatable \u00a2brinolysis inhibitor, or TAFI [7, 8] .\n\nCPH, which is also known as CPE or enkephalin convertase, is located in the secretory granules of pancreatic islets, as well as in the adrenal and pituitary glands and brain [9^13] , where it is present in both the soluble and membrane-bound forms [14, 15] . This enzyme di\u00a1ers from the other basic carboxypeptidases in that it has an acidic optimum pH, which is consistent with the acidic interior of the granules [16, 17] . CPH is probably involved in the removal of residual COOH-terminal arginine or lysine residues from peptidic prohormones during their processing in secretory granules [1, 18] . Another recently discovered enzyme, CPD, which has similar characteristics but a di\u00a1erent molecular mass, may also be involved in the processing of the peptides and proteins that transit via the secretory pathway [19, 20] .\n\nCPM is a widely distributed membrane-bound basic carboxypeptidase which has been puri\u00a2ed to homogeneity, cloned and sequenced from human placenta [21, 22] , where it is attached to the plasma membrane via a phosphatidylinositol glycan tail [23] . In view of its presence in plasma membranes and the fact that its optimal activity occurs at neutral pH levels, CPM might well participate in the local control of peptide hormone activity. Its proximity to plasma membrane receptors suggests that it may either inactivate or a\u00a1ect in some way the receptor speci\u00a2city of peptide hormones released at local tissue sites [1] .\n\nA novel cDNA encoding CPZ has recently been identi\u00a2ed based on its homology with known metallocarboxypeptidases [24] . CPZ was expressed in the baculovirus system and found to be more active at neutral pH levels than at pH 5.5 toward substrates with COOH-terminal basic amino acids [24] . Lastly, AEBP1 was identi\u00a2ed as a transcription repressor showing some homologies with metallocarboxypeptidases. Although it lacks the residues on which carboxypeptidase activity is thought to depend, this enzymatic protein has been reported to cleave peptides containing a COOH-terminal arginine residue [25] .\n\nThe increasing number of data becoming available nowadays on biologically active peptides has led to considerable attention being paid to mammalian basic carboxypeptidases. Little is known so far, however, about these non-digestive basic carboxypeptidases located in the intestinal tract, although it has been reported that most of the CPH activity in the rat intestine is membrane-bound, based on the \u00a2nding that it is stimulated by CoCl 2 and inhibited by low concentrations of guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid (GEMSA) at low pH levels [26] . CPM has the same properties as CPH [27] , and the presence of both enzymes has been brie\u00a3y described in the dog small intestinal wall [28] , but no further characterization has been performed. Here, we describe the puri\u00a2cation procedure used and give some of the characteristics of the membrane-bound basic carboxypeptidase from hog intestine mucosa, an enzyme which de\u00a2nitely di\u00a1ers from the other known carboxypeptidases but which is similar in some respects to the newly described CPD, the mammalian homologous form of duck gp180 protein, a 180 kDa hepatitis B virus-binding glycoprotein.\n\nPorcine intestines were obtained from the Marseilles slaughterhouse. Hippuryl-L-arginine, trypsin, papain, subtilisin, as well as all the activators, inhibitors and detergents used here were purchased from Sigma Chemicals (St. Louis, MO, USA). Phospholipase from Bacillus cereus was from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). Arginine-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, Sephacryl S200 HR were from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). The electrophoretic molecular mass markers were obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Richmond, CA, USA). HCl, PITC and the amino acid analysis standards were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA), while the polyvinylidene di\u00a3uoride membrane was from Millipore (Bedford, MA, USA) and the nitrocellulose sheets (0.2 Wm) from Schleicher and Schuell (Dassel, Germany). The rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against human placental CPM and the IgG fraction of goat anti-rabbit serum conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Tebu (Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France) and Sigma, respectively. Solvents (pure grade) were supplied by SDS (Peypin, France). All the other chemicals used were of reagent grade.\n\nAll the enzyme activities were measured at 37\u00b3C. Basic carboxypeptidase (CP) activity was measured with hippuryl-L-Arg as the substrate. The activity was \u00a2rst quanti\u00a2ed by performing an HPLC assay at 254 nm of the hippuric acid released. The enzyme was incubated with 1 mM hippuryl-L-Arg in a 0.1 M Tris^HCl bu\u00a1er (pH 7.5) containing 0.14 M NaCl. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 Wl of acetic acid to 200 Wl of reaction mixture. After extraction with 200 Wl of Cl 3 CH, the aqueous phase was removed and \u00a2ltered through Millipore \u00a2lters (0.45 Wm), and 15-Wl samples were injected into the Vydac C18-RP column (0.4U25 cm, 5 Wm) and separated at a \u00a3ow rate of 1 ml/min on a 10-min linear gradient from 10% to 25% acetonitrile in 0.01% TFA containing H 2 O. The basic CP activity was routinely determined spectrophotometrically during the puri\u00a2cation steps with the same substrate, as previously described by Koheil and Forstner [29] , and Skidgel and Erdo \u00ab s [30] . One unit of CP activity was de\u00a2ned as 1 Wmol of hippuryl-L-Arg hydrolysed per minute.\n\nThe activity of aminopeptidase N and alkaline phosphatase, two microvillus membrane markers, was assayed as described by Louvard et al. [31] , whereas (Na ,K )-ATPase, which was used as the basolateral plasma membrane marker, was assayed using the method developed by Murer et al. [32] . The activity of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, a microsomal contamination marker [33] , was assayed as described by Sottocasa et al. [34] , while cytochrome c oxidase, which was used as mitochondrial marker, was assayed using Cooperstein and Lazarow's method [35] . Acid phosphatase, a lysosome marker, was assayed according to Murer et al. [32] , and cathepsin B activity was determined using the speci\u00a2c substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC [36] as described by Gabrijelcic et al. [37] . Proteins were determined as described by Bradford [38] with bovine serum albumin as the standard.\n\nImmediately after the hogs were killed, their small intestines were removed, washed with a 50 mM Tris\u0124 Cl bu\u00a1er (pH 8.0) and placed at 4\u00b3C as soon as possible. The mucosa was scraped o\u00a1 with a microscope slide and kept at 320\u00b3C until being further processed. Crude brush-border membrane preparations were obtained as previously described by Schmitz et al. [39] and modi\u00a2ed by Maury et al. [40] , with additional slight modi\u00a2cations. Hog intestinal mucosal scrapings (200 g) were homogenized in four times their mass of a 5 mM Tris^HCl bu\u00a1er (pH 7.3) containing 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM KCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 in a motor-driven Te\u00a3on^glass homogenizer, and \u00a2ltered through a gauze. The resulting homogenate was submitted to di\u00a1erential centrifugation, and the \u00a2nal brush-border membrane-enriched pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of a 20 mM Tris^HCl bu\u00a1er (pH 7.3) containing 0.14 M NaCl, 10 mM KCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 . The other pellets were resuspended in 200 ml of the same bu\u00a1er.\n\nThe pH^activity pro\u00a2les were determined at 37\u00b3C with hippuryl-L-Arg as the substrate in the following two bu\u00a1ers: 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 3.0 to 7.0) and 0.1 M Tris^HCl (pH 7.0 to 9.0) containing 0.14 M NaCl. The e\u00a1ects of a number of reagents on basic CP activities were investigated after a 15-min incubation period at 37\u00b3C in the bu\u00a1ers used for the enzyme activity determinations described above. The reaction was started by adding the hippuryl-L-Arg substrate and the relative activity was expressed as a percentage of the control value.\n\nSmall intestines, stomachs and colons were removed immediately after the hogs were killed and washed with a 50 mM Tris^HCl bu\u00a1er (pH 8.0) and stored at 4\u00b3C. The intestines were further cut into 1-m pieces, their mucosa were scraped o\u00a1 with a microscope slide and crude brush-border membrane fractions were prepared as described above.\n\nCrude brush-border membrane preparations were washed \u00a2ve times with a 20 mM Tris^HCl bu\u00a1er (pH 7.3) containing 2 M NaCl, 10 mM KCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 . The \u00a2nal pellets were resuspended in the same bu\u00a1er containing only 0.14 M NaCl, and the resulting suspensions (about 2 mg/ml of proteins) were incubated with various detergents under gentle shaking at 4\u00b3C for 60 min. Suspensions were then centrifuged at 105 000Ug for 30 min and the enzyme activities in the pellets and supernatants were measured. Solubilized activities were expressed as percentages of total activities.\n\nPrior to the solubilization experiments with PI-PLC from Bacillus cereus, the \u00a2nal pellets were resuspended in a 0.1 M HEPES bu\u00a1er (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM PCMS, 0.1 mM TLCK and 1 mM leupeptine in order to inhibit the action of any brush-border membrane proteases and proteases possibly contaminating the commercial PI-PLC preparation used. The resulting suspensions (about 2 mg/ml of proteins) were incubated at 37\u00b3C for 2 h with 1 U/ml of PI-PLC from Bacillus cereus (1 unit of PI-PLC cleaves 1 nmol of phosphatidylinositol per minute). We then proceeded as described in the case of detergents.\n\nAs regards the solubilization process used with proteases, the \u00a2nal pellets were resuspended in a 20 mM Tris^HCl bu\u00a1er (pH 7.5) containing 0.25 M sucrose to obtain a 0.5 mg/ml protein solution. After the diluted membrane fractions had been incubated under gentle shaking at 4\u00b3C with increasing amounts of trypsin, papain and subtilisin, they were then processed as described in the case of detergents.\n\nOnce the brush-border membranes had been incubated with 10% trypsin (w/w) at 4\u00b3C for 24 h, trypsin was inhibited with 4 mM PMSF. The suspension was then centrifuged at 105 000Ug for 30 min and the resulting supernatant concentrated and dialyzed against a 20 mM Tris^HCl bu\u00a1er (pH 7.5) in an Amicon Concentrator with a PM-10 membrane. Solubilized CP was separated from the other proteins by performing chromatography using a Waters 650 E FPLC system, and 5-ml fractions were collected. The solubilized protein concentrate (about 50 ml) was \u00a2rst loaded on an arginine-Sepharose column (2.2U10 cm) pre-equilibrated with the dialysis bu\u00a1er at a \u00a3ow rate of 1 ml/min. After washing the column with the equilibration bu\u00a1er, the proteins were eluted with a 90-min linear gradient from 0 to 0.15 M NaCl followed by a 30-min linear gradient from 0.15 to 0.5 M NaCl in the same bu\u00a1er. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 5 l of a 20 mM Tris^HCl bu\u00a1er (pH 7.5) containing 1 M (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 . The dialyzed solution was then applied, at a \u00a3ow rate of 1 ml/min, to a phenyl-Sepharose column (2.2U10 cm) pre-equilibrated with the dialysis bu\u00a1er, which was subsequently washed with the equilibration bu\u00a1er. The proteins were eluted with a 120-min linear gradient from 1 to 0 M (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 in the same bu\u00a1er. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 10 l of a 20 mM Tris\u0124 Cl bu\u00a1er (pH 7.5) containing 0.35 M NaCl and concentrated to 1 ml in an Amicon Concentrator equipped with a PM-10 membrane. The concentrate was further applied to a Sephacryl-S200 HR column (2.6U60 cm) pre-equilibrated with the dialysis bu\u00a1er, at a \u00a3ow rate of 1 ml/min. After eluting the active fractions with the same bu\u00a1er, they were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 5 l of a 20 mM Tris\u0124 Cl bu\u00a1er (pH 7.5) containing 0.14 M NaCl, and the protein material was concentrated to 2 ml in an Amicon Concentrator with a PM-10 membrane.\n\nSDS^PAGE was performed using Laemmli's method [41] with 10% slab gels. Native PAGE was also carried out in 10% slab gels as described by Gabriel [42] . Proteins were detected by performing Coomassie blue or silver staining, while glycosylated proteins were detected with Schi\u00a1 reagent according to Zacharius et al. [43] with bovine serum albumin and fetuin from fetal calf serum as the standards.\n\nThe molecular mass of the native enzyme was estimated by performing gel \u00a2ltration using a Sephacryl-S200 HR column (2.6U60 cm) under the same ex-perimental conditions as for the puri\u00a2cation procedure.\n\nProteins were electrotransferred from slab gels to PVDF membranes as described by Matsudaira [44] , stained with Ponceau red and excised from the membrane for analysis. Amino acid compositions were determined using the Picotag procedure [45] , after hydrolyzing the proteins with 6 N HCl at 110\u00b3C for 24 h and derivatizing the resulting amino acids with PITC before injecting them into the Picotag Waters column (0.39U30 cm). Edman degradation was carried out on an Applied Biosystems Sequencer Model 470 according to Hewik et al. [46] . Phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) identi\u00a2cation was carried out by means of an Applied PTH column (0.21U22 cm, 5 Wm).\n\nProteins were electro-transferred from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose as described by Burnette [47] . After the transfer, Ponceau red protein staining and immunoprinting were carried out according to Coudrier et al. [48] as described by Gorvel et al. [49] .\n\nBasic CP activity was detected in homogenates from hog intestinal mucosa assayed with hippuryl- At each step in the subcellular fractionation procedure, the enzyme activities were measured in the pellet and the supernatant and expressed as a percentage of the total activity. Results are means based on three separate subcellular fractionations.\n\nL-Arg at pH 7.5. Subcellular fractionation yielded a microvillar membrane fraction containing about 40% of the total basic CP activity and a soluble fraction containing the remaining 60% (Table 1) . When the microvillar membrane fraction was washed with 2 M NaCl, no signi\u00a2cant release of basic CP activity into the \u00a2nal supernatant was observed, which indicates that the enzyme was probably tightly bound to the intestinal cell membranes. Two di\u00a1erent pH activity pro\u00a2les were obtained when the membrane-bound and soluble CP activities were tested with hippuryl-L-Arg at pH values ranging from 3.0 to 9.0 (Fig. 1) . In the microvillar membrane fractions, the activity was highest at pH 7.5, and the enzyme was still 72% active at pH 9.0, whereas the activity dropped sharply at acidic pH levels and was practically nil below pH 4.5. These \u00a2ndings are in agreement with those obtained on CPM from human placenta and from MDCK cells [21, 50] . Hog intestinal basic CP showed the highest level of activity at pH 5.0 with the soluble enzyme, and was still 57% active at pH 3.0, but its activity dropped sharply at basic pH levels. All these data suggested either that CPH may have been present, or that the lysosome did not remain intact during the subcellular fractionation, which would result in the soluble fractions being contaminated with lysosomal enzymes, which was apparently the case (Table 1) . It was therefore concluded that the soluble CP activity showing an acidic optimum pH might be that of cathepsin B (also named lysosomal carboxypeptidase), which is not a metallocarboxypeptidase, but a cysteine proteinase [51] . This hypothesis was further con\u00a2rmed upon testing the e\u00a1ects of some inhibitors and activators on the enzyme activity at acidic pH levels.\n\nAs shown in Table 2 , the membrane-bound CP activity was inhibited by o-phenanthroline and Chemicals were incubated at 37\u00b3C for 15 min at pH 7.5 and pH 5.0 with hog intestinal microvillar membrane fractions and soluble fractions, respectively, before adding the substrate hippuryl-L-Arg. The activities are expressed as percentages of the control values, and the results are means of duplicate assays on two separate subcellular fractionations. a On human placental CPM [21] b On bovine adrenal enkephalin convertase (CPH) [9] . c On lysosomal carboxypeptidase (cathepsin B) [9] .\n\nEDTA, which strongly suggests that zinc or some other cation was required for the enzyme activity to occur, whereas the serine protease inhibitor PMSF, as well as PCMS, the sulfhydryl protease inhibitor which is known to be active on CPH, had no appreciable e\u00a1ects. The fact that no SH group was involved in the enzymatic activity was con\u00a2rmed by the lack of e\u00a1ect of HgCl 2 . As in the case of other mammalian basic CP, CoCl 2 increased the membrane-bound CP peptidase activity, while cadmium acetate was slightly inhibitory. As regards the soluble basic CP activity, no activation was observed with CoCl 2 , the speci\u00a2c activator of basic carboxypeptidases, and only 50% inhibition occurred with o-phenanthroline, whereas EDTA and the two metal cations Ni 2 and Cd 2 were almost ine\u00a1ective, in sharp contrast with what occurs in the case of CPH [9] . The subcellular localization, optimum pH and spe-ci\u00a2c activation or inhibition by both CPM and hog intestinal membrane-bound CP reagents were very similar indeed (Table 2) . It seems very likely that the soluble CP activity was mainly due to a lysosomal cathepsin, since this enzyme was also detected in the soluble fractions (data not shown) in the assay on cathepsin B activity with the speci\u00a2c substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC. However, the possibility that a soluble form of CPH or any other basic CP may have been present cannot be de\u00a2nitely ruled out.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2 , basic CP activity was detected especially in the brush-border membrane preparations from hog small intestine. No signi\u00a2cant di\u00a1erence between the duodenum, jejunum and ileum was observed, in agreement with the results obtained by Lynch et al. [26] on the localization of the membrane-bound form of CPH in the rat gastrointestinal tract. Since the methods used in the latter case were not speci\u00a2c to CPH, but can be used to detect all the basic CPs, the enzyme activity of the rat gastrointestinal tract may also involve CPM. Here we observed that, in the rat intestine, the speci\u00a2c activity of the microvillar basic CP (about 22.5 nmol/min.mg) does not di\u00a1er signi\u00a2cantly between the duodenum, jejunum and ileum (data not shown).\n\nSince hog intestinal basic CP is apparently \u00a2rmly attached to the microvillar plasma membrane, we compared its pattern of solubilization by detergents, phospholipase C and proteases in order to gain insights into the way in which the CP is anchored to the membrane. Fig. 3 clearly shows that the pattern of solubilization of the basic CP activity by a series of six detergents was comparable to that of aminopeptidase N, but di\u00a1ered greatly from that of alkaline phosphatase. The latter two enzymes are generally thought to be suitable markers for labeling proteins anchored by a hydrophobic amino acid residue sequence and by a GPI moiety, respectively, as pointed out by Hooper and Turner [52] in their study on pig kidney microvillar ectoenzymes. It is worth mentioning that only octyl-glucoside and CHAPS, two detergents with high CMC values, e\u00a1ectively released substantial amounts ( s 60%) of GPI-anchored alkaline phosphatase activity, whereas all the detergents used solubilized 60^80% of the membrane-bound APN and basic CP activities.\n\nWhen hog intestinal microvillar membrane fractions were incubated with PI-PLC from Bacillus cereus, a speci\u00a2c release ( s 50%) of alkaline phosphatase was observed, but neither aminopeptidase N nor basic CP were solubilized (data not shown). The presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors during the incubation of membrane fractions with PI-PLC, as indicated in Section 2, rules out the possibility that contaminating proteases may have been involved in the release of the GPI-anchored enzyme. This result therefore con\u00a2rms the above conclusion that hog intestinal microvillar basic CP may not be bound to the membrane via a GPI tail like human placental CPM [23] , but via a hydrophobic peptidic anchor. The same conclusion was previously reached by Hooper and Turner [53] in their study on microvillar basic CP from pig and human kidney.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 4 , when hog intestinal microvillar membrane fractions were incubated at 4\u00b3C with 5% trypsin (w/w), as much as 40% of the total basic CP activity was released after a 24-h treatment, and more than 80% with 10% trypsin (w/w). Aminopeptidase N amounted to 10% and 50%, respectively, whereas no alkaline phosphatase was released at all. Similar results were obtained with papain and subtilisin (data not shown). After tryptic release of the soluble form of basic CP from its hydrophobic peptide anchor, the enzymatic activity remained intact. In addition, trypsin can be expected to cleave o\u00a1 only a relatively short peptide (about 20^30 amino acids) from the whole protein as observed in the case of CPM [50] . The tryptic release of a hydrophilic form of the basic CP from the microvillar plasma membrane was therefore taken as the starting point for the enzyme puri\u00a2cation procedure. \n\nBasic CP was puri\u00a2ed from hog intestinal mucosa using a 6-step procedure including the preparation of microvillar plasmic membrane fraction, washing it with 2 M NaCl and treating it with trypsin to solubilize the enzyme, on which an a\u00a4nity chromatography was subsequently performed on arginine-Sepharose, prior to hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, and \u00a2nally gel \u00a2ltration on Sephacryl-S200 HR. As summarized in Table 3 , in a typical experiment starting with 200 g of intestinal mucosa, the isolation procedure yielded about 2 mg of protein with a speci\u00a2c activity of 100 nmol/min per mg. The overall enzyme activity yield was 11% and a 500-fold puri\u00a2cation of the enzyme was obtained. It is worth mentioning that the arginine-Sepharose-bound basic CP activity could not be speci\u00a2cally eluted from the column using the basic CP speci\u00a2c inhibitor GEMSA, which nevertheless completely inhibited the enzyme (data not shown). This might be due to the molecular mass of the protein which is about four times that of the other basic carboxypeptidases.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 5 , the protein thus puri\u00a2ed gave a single PAGE band under non-denaturing conditions, which indicates that the isolated protein might be homogeneous, but unfortunately two bands were observed in the presence of SDS. No further improvement of the puri\u00a2cation level could be achieved although a number of other chromatographic procedures were tested.\n\nEqual volumes of native enzyme and sweet potato L-amylase, the molecular mass of which is known to be about 200 kDa, were eluted from the Sephacryl-S200 HR column (data not shown). The molecular masses of the two protein bands separated by SDST PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 5 , lane 2) were found to be 200 kDa and 120 kDa, respectively. When the SDS^PAGE was performed under non-reducing conditions, in the absence of DTT, and without any heating of the protein sample (Fig. 5, lane 3) , a single band at 200 kDa was obtained on the contrary, which strongly suggests that the two protein units might be linked by one or more disul\u00a2de bonds. However, when the SDS^PAGE was carried out in the absence of DTT and heating the protein sample before running the electrophoresis (Fig. 5, lane 4) , the 120 kDa protein was separated from the 200 kDa protein in the same way as under reducing and heating conditions. It is possible that the 120 kDa band may re\u00a3ect the presence of a proteolytic fragment from the 200 kDa protein.\n\nThe sugar-speci\u00a2c pattern of slab gel staining obtained with periodate-Schi\u00a1's reagent clearly indicated that the two protein bands were glycosylated. Therefore, the native enzyme might be a 200 kDa glycoprotein, as compared with the molecular mass of CPM, which is 60 kDa [21] . The only basic carboxypeptidase which is known to be a single-chain glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 180 kDa is actually CPD, a carboxypeptidase which was recently characterized and found to have similar enzymatic properties to those of CPH [19] . Upon being subjected to SDS^PAGE, the puri\u00a2ed membrane-bound and soluble forms of CPD from bovine pituitary gland showed a single 180 kDa band in the former case, and a 170 kDa and a 135 kDa band in the latter case [20] . The two polypeptide chains observed upon performing SDS^PAGE on the solubilized form of the basic CP puri\u00a2ed from hog intestine were similar to those observed in the soluble form of CPD, and thus suggested that a membrane-bound CPD may also exist in the intestine.\n\nThe basic CP puri\u00a2ed in this study was able to cleave hippuryl-L-Lys about 1.5-fold faster than hippuryl-L-Arg, contrary to what has been found to occur in the case of CPM [21] , and its optimum pH was about 6.5 with the latter substrate. Since the enzyme was not detected when immunoblotting was performed with a polyclonal antiserum against human placental CPM, intestinal CP can de\u00a2nitely be said to be a structurally distinct protein from human placen- Results are expressed as a percentage of total residues determined. n.d., not determined. a Mean value based on two analyses. b Deduced from the cDNA nucleotide sequence of CPM [22] . c Deduced from the cDNA nucleotide sequence of CPD [54] .\n\ntal CPM-type enzyme. Since no NH 2 -terminal residue was detected using the Applied Biosystems Automatic Sequencer, the protein N-terminus was taken to be blocked. The amino acid composition of the two solubilized forms of CP from intestine was determined and compared with those of human CPM and CPD (Table 4 ). The two proteins separated by SDS^PAGE showed similar amino acid contents, except for Asx and Glx, which suggests that the lower molecular mass form might be due to some proteolysis of the higher molecular mass form. The 200 kDa glycoprotein had roughly the same amino acid distribution as CPM and CPD, but its lysine content was not so high. However, although the amino acid compositions of hog intestinal CP, human CPM, and human CPD are comparable, the exact identity of the intestinal enzyme still needs to be con\u00a2rmed.\n\nThe COOH-terminal arginine and lysine from peptides and proteins may be cleaved by several carboxypeptidases, which show the same pattern of carboxypeptidase B activity, but have di\u00a1erent molecular and enzymatic characteristics [1] .\n\nThe results of the present study show that hog intestinal mucosa contains at least a membranebound carboxypeptidase capable of releasing basic COOH-terminal amino acids from short peptides. The trypsin-solubilized form of CP was isolated from the hog intestine, with a speci\u00a2c activity of 100 nmol/min per mg using hippuryl-L-Arg as the substrate. According to its subcellular localization and optimum pH, the enzyme activity greatly resembles that of CPM in the human placenta as well as that of MDCK cells [21, 50] . The basic CP activity was equally distributed between the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, in agreement with the pattern of distribution of CPH in the rat gastrointestinal tract [26] . However, since the methods used by the latter authors were not really speci\u00a2c to CPH activity [27] , the enzyme involved might have been CPM, and this might explain why CPH was sometimes found in areas apparently devoid of any endocrine function in the rat gastrointestinal tract. Although we observed that the ratio between intestinal membranebound and soluble CP activities was the same as that between membrane-bound and soluble CPH [26] , it is worth noting that two distinct enzymes with di\u00a1erent optimum pH values and behavior towards activators and inhibitors were found to exist in hog intestine. The soluble CP activity was probably due to cathepsin B, a cysteine enzyme of lysosomal origin with several endo-and exopeptidase activities [51, 55] usually found in the gastroduodenal mucosa [56, 57] . This enzyme, which is not a metallocarboxypeptidase, was not further characterized in this study.\n\nHog intestinal basic CP did not appear to have the characteristics of a GPI-anchored enzyme, judging from its pattern of solubilization by a range of detergents, in addition to the fact that it was not released from microvillar membrane preparations in response to PI-PLC. Consequently, this cell-surface peptidase is probably anchored by a sequence of hydrophobic amino acid residues to the lipid bilayer. The basic carboxypeptidases present in human and hog kidney microvillar membranes are known to have the same pattern of solubilization by detergents and to resist solubilization by PI-PLC [53] , whereas CPM from human placenta and that from MDCK cells are anchored via a GPI tail [23, 50] . The discovery in human placenta of a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase which was not GPI-anchored and had di\u00a1erent characteristics from those of CPM [23] may support the idea that membrane-bound CPM is not the sole microvillar carboxypeptidase. Since Hooper and Turner [53] described the solubilization of basic CP from the rat kidney without further characterizing the enzyme, it is therefore possible that the microvillar membrane-bound carboxypeptidase is another member of the B-type carboxypeptidase family. A placental enzyme distinct from CPM was recently partially puri\u00a2ed and denoted CPD [58] , a basic carboxypeptidase which was still unknown when the present work was carried out.\n\nAlthough the basic CP from hog intestinal mucosa has some properties in common with CPM, it is definitely a distinct enzyme, since CPM is a GPI-anchored single-chain 60 kDa glycoprotein, whereas hog intestinal CP is apparently a single-chain 200 kDa glycoprotein which is anchored to the membrane by a number of hydrophobic amino acid residues. Moreover, intestinal CP cleaved lysyl bonds faster than arginyl bonds, contrary to CPM, and immunoblotting analysis provided further evidence that hog intestinal CP was di\u00a1erent from CPM. The molecular mass of the intestinal CP (200 kDa) was not very di\u00a1erent from that of the membranebound CPD (180 kDa), which was \u00a2rst described in the bovine pituitary gland as a CPH-like enzyme [19, 20] . CPD is a widely distributed enzyme [20, 58] which has recently been partly puri\u00a2ed from human placental microvilli [58] , indicating that CPM is not the sole microvillar carboxypeptidase of the B-type. The optimum pH of the puri\u00a2ed intestinal CP was actually between 6.0 and 7.0, which is similar to that of human placental CPD (5.5^6.5).\n\nThe sole membrane-bound CP which was isolated and characterized from hog intestine in the present study was identi\u00a2ed as a new member of the B-type metallocarboxypeptidases, and is consequently di\u00a1erent from CPB, CPN, pCPB, CPH and CPM. It appeared to be similar to the newly described CPD, which is the mammalian homologue of duck gp180, a 180 kDa hepatitis B virus-binding glycoprotein which was recently cloned and sequenced [59] . It is worth noting that unlike bovine CPD, the N-terminus of which was determined chemically [19, 20] , no NH 2 -terminal residue could be detected when NH 2terminal Edman degradation was performed on the gp180 protein puri\u00a2ed from duck liver [59] . Although CPD occurs in a wide range of tissues, this is the \u00a2rst time a CPD-like enzyme is puri\u00a2ed from intestinal tissue. Further characterization of the structural, catalytic and immunological properties of hog intestinal CP is still necessary to de\u00a2nitely con\u00a2rm that this enzyme is a CPD.\n\nAs the various carboxypeptidases described so far have the same catalytic properties, their speci\u00a2c biological function must depend mainly on their site of action, which is generally directly related to their physical state (e.g., solubilized vs membrane-bound). It is therefore widely recognized that the pancreatic CPB present in the intestine in the form of a soluble enzyme contributes along with other digestive enzymes to degrading food proteins and peptides, whereas CPH in the secretory granules of neuroendocrine tissues might be involved in the maturation and sorting of peptidic hormones [60, 61] . Two other carboxypeptidases present in most mammalian tissues and organs, namely CPN, which circulates in the blood, and CPM, which is bound to the plasma membrane of several cells, play key physiological roles, consisting of regulating the activity of various peptides. These two enzymes in particular have been described as kininases [62] , although their exact function has not yet been established. The function of CPD is still unknown, but the recent \u00a2nding that it is located mainly in the trans-Golgi network is consistent with the idea that it is involved in the processing of a broad range of proteins that transit along the secretory pathway, playing a similar role to that of CPH in prohormone processing in the regulated secretory pathway [63] . In addition, the \u00a2nding that CPD is recycled from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi network constitutes important evidence supporting the suggestion that it may act as a receptor for hepatitis B virus [63] . Another metal containing peptidase, aminopeptidase N, has been found to be a coronavirus receptor [64, 65] . The question as to whether the intestinal membrane-bound basic CP has a speci\u00a2c and exclusive degradative role completing that of pancreatic CPB, or is involved independently or concomitantly in the regulation of some of the active biological peptides present in the luminal secretions of the intestine, as well as in the immunological response of the intestinal mucosa to the presence of exogenous peptidic antigens, still remains to be elucidated."}
