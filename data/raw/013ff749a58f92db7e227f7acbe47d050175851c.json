{"title": "Full-Length Genome Sequence of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Strain CH/GX/2015/750A", "body": ". However, 750A has a relatively low nucleotide identity (96.8% to 97.7%) with classical strains and vaccine strains (CV777 and DR13) in Asia, which might explain the incomplete protection efficiency of the vaccination.\n\nThe genome sequence reported in this study will promote a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and genetic diversity of PEDV.\n\nAccession number(s). The complete genome sequence of PEDV strain CH/GX/2015/ 750A has been deposited in GenBank under the accession no. KY793536.\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the Science and Technology Projects of Fishery and Husbandry of Guangxi Province, China (grants 201633041, 201633044, and 201633034)."}
