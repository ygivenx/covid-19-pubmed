{"title": "Influenza surveillance in Middle East, North, East and South Africa: Report of the 8th MENA Influenza Stakeholders Network", "body": "The Middle\u2010East and Africa Influenza Surveillance Network (MENA\u2010ISN) has been established in 2014 and is hosted by Fondation M\u00e9rieux since 2017.1 The network, initially composed of eight countries, includes 15 countries at present (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Iran, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Tunisia, Turkey and United Arab Emirates). MENA\u2010ISN works as a think tank to share evidence\u2010based information, experience and best practices in order to address challenges in control and prevention of influenza, and to increase partnership and networking between countries and international organizations. The main objectives of MENA\u2010ISN are the following:\nImprove awareness and knowledge of influenza burden through effective communication, education and training;Strengthen evidence base through surveillance and research;Reduce the incidence of infection through effective prevention measures;Increase influenza vaccine uptake and introduction into the national immunization programmes;Develop the economic case for sustainable investment of National Plans.\n\n\nThe purpose of this paper was to report on the current situation of influenza surveillance and action plans to move forward in MENA\u2010ISN countries. Data were originated from the 8th MENA\u2010ISN meeting, organized by M\u00e9rieux Foundation that was held on 10\u201011 April 2018 in Cairo, Egypt. The meeting included MENA\u2010ISN representatives from 12 countries (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Tunisia and United Arab Emirates) and experts from the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology, and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nOutbreaks of A/H5N1 (2006 and 2014), A/H1N1 pandemic (2009) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\u2010Coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV, 2012) were the main drivers of increasing influenza surveillance in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Overall, 19 EMR countries, namely Afghanistan, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Occupied Palestinian Territory, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, have functional influenza surveillance systems and 16 National Influenza Centers (NIC) of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), are operative and report to the WHO through Eastern Mediterranean Flu (EMFLU), FluNet or Flu Informed Decision (FluID).2 Also, the pandemic preparedness tools are available from the WHO.\n\nThe main goal of the EMR influenza programmes is to minimize the burden of this vaccine\u2010preventable disease by (a) monitoring the trends of influenza and locally circulating virus types/subtypes using epidemiological and virological surveillance system for influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI); (b) describing influenza burden by performing studies on disease burden estimation; and (c) monitoring programme performance and progress towards the set\u2010up of policies and programmes to increase seasonal influenza vaccination coverage.\n\nIn total, 28 professionals from 15 countries were trained to define influenza baseline and threshold values and five countries are working on publishing the results. Overall, 14 (64%) countries have seasonal influenza vaccination policies, five countries included influenza vaccine in their national immunization programmes, and three countries have policies for vaccinating healthcare providers (HCPs). A significant improvement has also been noticed in the number of high\u2010risk people receiving seasonal influenza vaccines.\n\nThe first scientific conference on acute respiratory infection in EMR (EMARIS) was held in December 2017 (Amman, Jordan) and gathered over 140 participants from 20 countries.3 One region\u2010specific panel session was also held during the international conference on emerging infectious diseases in 20154 (Atlanta, USA).\n\nKenya and South Africa joined the MENA\u2010ISN in 2018 and participated in the MENA\u2010ISN meeting for the first time. A summary of major actions achieved in participating countries is provided in Table 1. ILI and SARI surveillance systems are in place in all countries. While some progresses have been achieved, the number of available vaccine doses as well as vaccine coverage remains low. Social mobilization and advocacy campaigns are in place in almost all MENA\u2010ISN countries.\n\nFuture objectives for participating countries are summarized in Table 2. All countries aim at strengthening their surveillance by identifying the needs and by adding detection and monitoring of other novel or emerging respiratory viruses when feasible. Participants also highlighted the need to support the WHO initiative in building laboratory capacity and surveillance in the MENA region and urge the governments to give high priority to the establishment and continued support for influenza surveillance systems.\n\nRegarding influenza vaccines, developing long\u2010term plans for the use of seasonal influenza vaccines at least among high\u2010risk groups, providing/increasing funding for vaccination by governments and setting\u2010up vaccination campaigns were reported as the main actions to increase vaccine uptake.\n\nIn addition to the lack of adequate funding to procure influenza vaccines, poor awareness in the public and HCPs about influenza/vaccine, vaccine hesitancy, absence of clear messages and social mobilization could also contribute to low vaccination coverage in MENA region. Several programmes on education of the community and HCPs are currently ongoing, but more still needs to be done.\n\nFinally, influenza burden (ie morbidity, mortality, loss of working hours) is not well described. More research to clearly estimate the economic burden of influenza and cost of \u201cinaction,\u201d to generate new evidence on influenza virus circulation and disease burden can serve as the basis to increase uptake and coverage of seasonal influenza vaccines and to guide measures for pandemic influenza.\n\nThe MENA\u2010ISN roadmap is now available to help achieving the network's goals.\n\nEmerging infectious diseases are a major public health problem in the EMR region. Besides, more than half of the 22 countries of the EMR are affected by acute or protracted complex emergencies.\n\nTo increase influenza vaccination coverage, MENA\u2010ISN countries could start by targeting HCPs and high\u2010risk individuals and scale up to other groups and ultimately to the whole population.\n\nPregnant women are considered by the WHO as the main high\u2010risk group during pandemics. Maternal immunization can reduce the risk of post\u2010natal infections in the infants.5 Currently, two studies among pregnant women are ongoing in Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. One aims at using antibodies in the umbilical cord of women who received vaccination during pregnancy as a marker of response to influenza virus vaccination in pregnant women. Two other studies on the critical window of vaccination during pregnancy and a prospective observational cohort study to determine the burden of influenza disease in pregnant women and in the newborns in the MENA region are under examination by the expert group.\n\nElderly individuals are also at high risk of influenza\u2010related hospitalization and death.6, 7 Frailty is defined as \u201ca state of increased vulnerability to poor resolution of homoeostasis after a stressor event\u201d, which increases the risk of adverse outcomes,8 and represents a new way to think about vulnerability to influenza9, 10 that can be used in the MENA region for at\u2010risk individuals. For example, frailty has been studied in influenza surveillance in Canada, where a frailty index based on a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment has been found to impact estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness and outcomes of hospitalization with influenza illness.9 Given that frailty can be measured in different ways, work is ongoing to identify and validate brief measures of frailty such as the Clinical Frailty Scale which may be more readily implemented in resource\u2010diverse settings.11\n\n\nPilgrims to Saudi Arabia are a specific high\u2010risk group for influenza infection and transmission in the MENA region. Influenza vaccination is recommended since 2005 but few studies assessed influenza vaccine effectiveness in pilgrims and its impact on other respiratory illnesses.12, 13 Arising from discussions at the 8th MENA\u2010ISN meeting, a multicentre hospital\u2010based study is under investigation by MENA\u2010ISN participating countries. A questionnaire will be prepared to collect data on vaccination status of pilgrims, SARI symptoms and other factors that could impact vaccine effectiveness.\n\nCurrently, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is the main vaccine in use in the majority of MENA countries. Considering different vaccine products, which could be targeted to different high\u2010risk groups (eg young children, immunosuppressed or elderly people) in MENA region, has the potential to provide greater effectiveness that would also help in combating the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. Introduction of quadrivalent vaccine covering both influenza B lineages could be beneficial since both lineages have been detected in MENA countries. Given that elderly people tend to have diminished immune responses compared with younger adults,14 increasing vaccination rates to protect elderly people, potentially using vaccine products which lead to more vigorous immune response, is also fundamental. Recently, several influenza vaccines that could have a better action have been tested in elderly people. The use of adjuvanted sub\u2010unit vaccine (MF59) has been proven to be effective in reducing several influenza\u2010related outcomes among the elderly, especially hospitalizations due to influenza\u2010related complications.15 Compared with standard\u2010dose influenza vaccine, high\u2010dose vaccine was also found to reduce hospital admission with respiratory illness16, 17, 18 and to be cost\u2010saving.19, 20 Finally, a recombinant influenza vaccine has been shown to provide a better protection in older adults than the standard quadrivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine.21 At present, the availability of these newer vaccine products is limited in many settings, and where available, they may be cost\u2010prohibitive. With this in mind, implementing a realistic vaccination strategy with available product in order to improve influenza vaccine coverage should be considered as the first\u2010line strategy with whatever influenza vaccine available in a given country.\n\nIn summary, despite enhanced influenza surveillance systems, a higher number of NICs that actively perform influenza virus typing and more available information on influenza burden in the region, the current situation is not satisfactory. Key challenges for the future are sustainability, good quality data and more private\u2010academic collaborations under a common scientific umbrella. A unified group of committed national experts, that is MENA\u2010ISN with joint multisectoral and multidisciplinary efforts, will help to get further than individual efforts. The network can be the active advocate for acceptance of vaccination by HCPs and the public, by bringing key local stockholders together, explaining benefits of seasonal influenza vaccination and addressing misinformation. Dissemination of surveillance and disease burden data through publications and effective communication tools will help to push health authorities in favour of official recommendations for influenza vaccination.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest to report."}
