{"title": "Estimation of the final size of the COVID-19 epidemic", "body": "The logistic growth model originates from population dynamics (Haberman 1998) . The underlying assumption of the model is that the rate of change in the number of new cases per capita linearly decreases with the number of cases. Hence, if C is the number of cases, and t is the time, then the model is expressed as\n\nwhere r is infection rate, and K is the final epidemic size.

The comparison of the predicted final sizes is shown in the graph in Figure 1 . We see that both methods converge and with more data, the discrepancy between the predicted values becomes less than 5%. From Table 1 , we see that the peak of the epidemic was probably on 9 Feb, 2020. .

From Table 3 , we see that the logistic regression model has a high coefficient of determination of 0.996, while the pvalue (< 0.000) indicates that all the regression parameters are statistically significant.\n\nIn Tables 3 and 4 , the iterated Shanks transformations for the predicted series of the final epidemic size are given. It appears that the predictions of the logistic model tend to the final size of 83231 cases, while the SIR model predictions converge to 83640 cases. Thus, the discrepancy is less than 0.5%.

Namely, as can be seen from the graph in Figure 2 at the beginning, we have exponential growth. Then until 11 Feb, one can predict the final epidemic size of about 55000 cases. However, the collection of data changes and we have a jump of about 15000 new cases on 12.\n\nFeb. On 20 Feb we have another change in trend; the data begin to shows almost linear trend (See Fig 3) . While the above models show that the epidemic is slow down, the linear trend predicts about 873 new cases per day (see Table 5 ). .

A more optimistic final size of 83300 cases is obtained using the Shanks transformation. Similar figures are obtained using the SIR model, where the predicted size of the epidemic is approximately 84500, and the Shanks transformation lowers this number to about 83700 cases.\n\nNaturally, the degree of accuracy of these estimates remains to be seen.\n\nIn conclusion, qualitatively, both models show that the epidemic is moderating, but recent data show a linear upward trend. The next few days will, therefore, indicate in which direction the epidemic is heading.\n\nPS. Today it is more or less clear that the predictions of the article apply only to China. By February 20, 99% of the case was from China. The linear trend in data from Feb 20 onward meant a decreasing number of infected in China and increasing infected elsewhere in the world. In other words, in China, the epidemic is slowing down, .
