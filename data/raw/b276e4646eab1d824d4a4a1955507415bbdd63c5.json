{"title": "Clinical evaluation of a new single-tube multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay for simultaneous detection of 11 respiratory viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia in hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections", "body": "Respiratory virus infections are an important cause of hospitalization for young Children. Different respiratory virus infections often present similar influenza-like symptoms (Kelly and Birch, 2004) , laboratory analysis is therefore essential for etiological diagnosis. Recently, molecular assays, especially in a multiplex format, have been accepted as an excellent choice for broad spectrum detection of respiratory viruses (Kim et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2007; Mahony et al., 2007; Raymond et al., 2009) . However, these methods or kits are either lower throughput (real-time reverse transcription-PCR), labor intensive (microarray) or costly (Luminex xTAG RVP Fast kit, FilmArray Respiratory Panel and next generation sequencing), which limits their wide use in the clinical setting. Multiple reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays (Hu et al., 2012; Nagel et al., 2009; Qin et al., 2010) are a good alternative with acceptable sensitivity, specificity and reasonable expense. Our previous study (Li et al., 2013) reported a 2-tube multiplex RT-PCR assay (2-tube assay) using automated electrophoresis system to detect 16 respiratory viruses. The 2-tube assay is now commercialized (ABT 9 + 7, Zhuochenhuisheng, Beijing, China) and has routinely used at most of provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in China.\n\nIn addition to respiratory virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is an important pathogen of respiratory infections in children, especially plays a significant role in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children (Ferwerda et al., 2001; Zhuo et al., 2015) . Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) are 2 of the most common members of the Chlamydiaceae family that infect humans. CP is now recognized worldwide as a common cause of respiratory infections in adults and children, CT can be found in respiratory tract of newborns and can lead to pneumonitis (Hammerschlag, 2003; Webley et al., 2009 ). It has long been known that MP pneumonia (MPP) is associated with preceding or concomitant viral or Chlamydia infections. These coinfections should be considered in refractory MPP, as more severe outcome was found in co-infections patients than singe infection, and also more hospitalization expenses of patients with co-infections were observed than patients with single infection in the same hospital stay days (Song et al., 2015) . Thus, in clinical settings, especially in Children's hospital, there is therefore a high demand of simultaneous detection of respiratory viruses, MP and Chlamydia. Recently, a new Respiratory Pathogen 13 Detection Kit (13\u00d7 kit, Health Gene Technologies, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China) based on multiplex RT-PCR assay and automatic capillary electrophoresis is commercialized, which enables simultaneous detection of 11 respiratory viruses including human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus types A (FluA), FluA-H1N1, FluA-H3, influenza virus types B (FluB), adenovirus (Adv), human Bocavirus (HBoV), metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), coronavirus (COV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and MP and Chlamydia (including CP and CT) in a single reaction. However, no study was conducted to evaluate the clinical performance of this kit.\n\nIn this study, the clinical performance of the 13\u00d7 kit was evaluated for the first time in a head to head comparison against the 2-tube assay and commercial Real-time Quantitative PCR (qPCR) kits using 572 Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from children with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI). The utilization of 13\u00d7 kit in clinical practice was also discussed.\n\nA total of 572 children with ARTI hospitalized in Children's hospital of Hebei, China, from May to October 2015 and from May to July 2016 were included in the study, of those 201 (35.1%) were female and 371 (64.9%) were male. Ages ranged from 1 month to 13 years old, and 83.2% were under 3 years old. NPAs collected consecutively from those children were added to 3.5 ml of transport medium and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. All aspects of the study were performed in accordance with national ethics regulations and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China. Children's parents were apprised of the study's purpose and of their right to keep information confidential. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or caregivers.\n\nTotal RNA/DNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcL of clinical samples using EasyPure Viral DNA/RNA Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two microliter MS2-based pseudovirus particles as a RT-PCR internal control were mixed with clinical samples and extracted together. The extracts was eluted in 50 \u03bcL of DNase-and RNase-free water and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nEach RNA/DNA preparation was subjected to RT-PCR procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thermal cycling was performed on an ABI 7500 apparatus (Applied BioSystems, USA). The condition of RT-PCR was as follows: 5 min at 25\u00b0C, 15 min at 50\u00b0C, 2 min at 95\u00b0C, 6 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 65-60\u00b0C for 30 sec (1\u00b0C touchdown PCR), 72\u00b0C for 60 sec and 29 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 60 sec, followed by a single incubation of 10 min at 70\u00b0C. An aliquot (1 \u03bcL) of the PCR product for each sample or reference standards (Health Gene Technologies, China) was prepared for capillary electrophoresis by adding 28.7 \u03bcL of CEQ Sample Loading Solution (Beckman Coulter, USA) and 0.3 \u03bcL of CEQ DNA Size Standard 400 (Beckman Coulter, USA) in a 96-well CEQ electrophoresis plate (Beckman Coulter, USA), and then were analyzed by a GeXP system (Beckman Coulter, USA). For all amplified products, the reaction was considered positive when the value of sample dye signal was over the high value of reference standards or negative when under the low value. If dye signal value of the clinical sample was between the high value and low value (gray area), the sample was re-detected.\n\n2.4. Validation of 11 respiratory viruses using 2-tube multiplex RT-PCR assay (2-tube assay)\n\nThe 2-tube assay was performed with a One Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in a 25 \u03bcL volume according to the protocols as described (Li et al., 2013) , and the products were analyzed on the QIAxcel automatic electrophoresis using QIAxcel DNA High-Resolution kit.\n\nIf results were discordant between 13\u00d7 kit and 2-tube assay, both tests were repeated concurrently to evaluate any problems relating to sample degradation or potential hands-on error. Assignment of such samples as having concordant or discordant results was based on the results of duplicate testing by both methods. If results were still discordant, mono-RT-PCR was then performed followed by sequencing using a pair of universal tag primers (Table 1 ). The specific primers for each pathogen were designed by Health Gene Technologies and the primers information is showed in Table 1 .\n\nFor MP, all samples were validated by qPCR using commercial diagnostic kits for MP (Daan Gene, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacture's instruction. For discordant MP results, mono-RT-PCR was then performed followed by sequencing. For Chlamydia, all samples were validated by sequencing. The primers for mono-RT-PCR and sequencing are shown in Table 1 .\n\nA total of 503 out of 572 (87.94%) specimens were positive for at least one of the respiratory pathogens by either 13\u00d7 kit or 2-tube assay, 230 (40.21%) specimens with co-infections were detected by either of the 2 methods. Of the 494 positives by 13\u00d7 kit, 267 (46.68%), 202 (35.31%), and 25 (4.37%) specimens were positive for a single pathogen, 2 pathogens, and 3 pathogens, respectively. Of the 433 positives by 2-tube assay, 240 (41.96%), 173 (30.24%), and 20 (3.50%) specimens were positive for a single virus, 2 viruses, and 3 viruses, respectively. Table 2 shows the sample positivity for each pathogen detected by 2 methods. A specimen was considered positive for a pathogen if it was tested positive by either of 2 methods. The most frequently detected pathogen was HRV (241/572, 42.13%). PIV was detected in 179 of 572 (31.29%) specimens including 14/572 (2.45%) type 1, 1/572 (0.17%) type 2 and 164/572 (28.67%) type 3. 83 of MP and 17 of Chlamydia were identified by 13\u00d7 kit. No PIV2 were detected by either of 2 methods. Discordant results were found in 4.02% (23/572) of specimens. As detection of MP and Chlamydia was not done with 2-tube assay, MP and Chlamydia were not counted in the discordant results.\n\nOverall, 413 of the 572 specimens were positive for at least one virus with both techniques, 136 specimens were negative for all viruses by both methods. A sensitivity of 97.41% and a specificity of 91.89% for 13\u00d7 kit were achieved using 2-tube assay as the reference method. The positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) for the 13\u00d7 kit were 97.18% and 92.52%, respectively. In a head-to-head comparison for all viruses, the assay concordance was 95.98%, the kappa coefficient was 0.89. The sensitivity, specificity, Youden's index, PPV, NPV, accordance rate and kappa coefficient for every target (MP and Chlamydia was not includEd.) using the 2-tube assay as the reference method are shown in Table 3 .\n\nOf the 4.02% (23/572) of specimens with discordant results, 12 specimens including 6 of PIV, 3 of HRV, 1 of FluB, 1 of COV, 1 of Adv, and 1 of HBoV were tested positive by the 13\u00d7 kit but missed by the 2-tube assay; while 11 specimens missed by the 13\u00d7 kit were identified by the 2-tube assay including 6 for HRV, 2 for RSVB, 2 for Adv, 1 for PIV1, 1 for RSVA, 1 for HMPV and 1 for HBoV (Table 4 ). All the positive specimens with discordant results were confirmed by mono-PCR and sequencing as true positives, as shown in Table 4 .\n\nThe results of 13\u00d7 kit were in accordance with qPCR or sequencing. Eighty-three positive samples for MP were detected and 26 of 83 samples were co-infected with viruses. Seventeen cases of Chlamydia were detected and 7 cases were co-infected with viruses. Seventeen cases of Chlamydia detected by 13\u00d7 kit were confirmed by sequencing as true positives for CT.\n\nThere are many reports on the multiple causative viruses of acute respiratory tract infections with different approaches using molecular detection techniques (Coiras et al., 2004; Li et al., 2013; Pabbaraju et al., 2011; Raymond et al., 2009) . Nucleic acid amplification methods such as conventional PCR, nested PCR and real-time PCR have increasingly been explored for identification of MP and Chlamydia in respiratory diseases (Higgins et al., 2009; Kumar and Hammerschlag, 2007) . However, no commercial assay for simultaneous detection of common respiratory viruses, MP and Chlamydia in respiratory specimens was available in China. Recently, the first commercial kit (13\u00d7 kit, Health Gene Technologies, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China) was launched in China for the simultaneous detection of 11 common respiratory viruses, MP and Chlamydia. In the present study, the feasibility of potential clinical practice of this kit is evaluated in comparison with the 2-tube assay and qPCR using 572 nasopharyngeal specimens from hospitalized children with ARTI. The overall detection rate of 13\u00d7 kit for each virus was comparable to that of 2-tube assay (kappa N0.75) revealing the high sensitivity (97.41%) and specificity (91.89%) of 13\u00d7 kit in the analysis of clinical samples. We also found 100% diagnosis agreement for detection of MP and Chlamydia between 13\u00d7 kit and qPCR/sequencing. We showed that the detection rate of co-infections was similar between 13\u00d7 kit (227/572) and 2-tube assay (193/572). Moreover, 29 of 34 coinfections detected by 13\u00d7 kit were MP or CT co-infections with viruses, demonstrating the ability of 13\u00d7 kit to detect the mixed infections involved in MP/CT and respiratory viruses. Additionally, 13\u00d7 kit is more sensitive than 2-tube assay in the detection of PIV, as PIV4 was only identified by 13\u00d7 kit (Table 3) . In this study, HRV was the most frequently detected pathogen followed by PIV, MP, Adv and HBoV, and FluA and FluB were detected at a low prevalence. These results were similar to our previous study in 2016 about common respiratory viruses (Le et al., 2016) except that the prevalence of RSV was very low in this study. This difference might be caused by the following 2 aspects: 1. The detection of RSV increased during the winter (Cui et al., 2015; Jain et al., 2015) , but the collection time of the samples in our study was not in winter (May to October). 2. Our previous study only referred to patients with community acquired pneumonia. In this study, the patients were hospitalized for both the upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract infections. In addition, the positive percentage of CT was 2.97% in our study which was consistent with the reported results of Chen et al. (2010) . Common atypical bacteria such as MP and Chlamydia are listed as common agents of CAP in Chinese Community-acquired Pneumonia Management Guidelines in Children (trial, 2007) . Recent epidemiological studies (Liu et al., 2015a (Liu et al., , 2015b Wu et al., 2014) of pathogens leading to respiratory infection among hospitalized children in China showed that MP was the most frequently detected pathogen. These studies also reported that co-infections with multiple pathogens are common in children with respiratory infection and the most commonly seen was the combination of MP and viral pathogen. In this study, MP was detected in 83 children (68 cases \u22653 years), composed of 50 males and 33 females, and the co-infection rate was 31.3% (26/83), which was lower than the detection rates reported in other studies mentioned above. These differences may be associated with various factors such as sample size, types of samples, the timing of specimen collection and methodology. CP often mixes infections with MP, especially in children older than 3 years (Chen et al., 2012; Song et al., 2015) . CT is mainly prevalent in infants less than 6 months hospitalized with pneumonia and severe pneumonia cases had a higher proportion of viral co-infection compared to mild pneumonia cases (Li et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015b) . In our study, 17 of CT were detected in 11 males and 6 females and 7 of them (41.2%) were co-infections with virus, suggesting a high proportion of viral co-infection in patients infected with CT. Furthermore, 16 of them were infants less than 6 months of age and the onset age was consistent with above studies. So, the diagnosis of atypical bacterial infection, especially co-infection with viruses, should be paid more attention.\n\nThe distinctive feature of 13\u00d7 kit is that it integrates multiplex RT-PCR with automatic capillary electrophoresis. A total of 13 sets of chimeric primers (comprising of universal tag at the 5\u2032-end and pathogen specific primer at 3\u2032 end) labeled with one fluorescence dye at 5\u2032-end were designed. One-step multiplex RT-PCR was performed in a single tube, followed by capillary electrophoresis separation of different length of amplification products for different pathogens. DNA and RNA targets of samples were thus tested at the same time. Taking the advantages of its one-step multiplex procedure and high-throughput sample loading, 13\u00d7 kit assays is labor-saving and time-saving. The detection of 96 samples can be completed in 10-16 hours, including extraction of RNA/DNA (40 minutes), the whole RT-PCR (2 hours), and the detection on the automatic capillary electrophoresis (8 tests/30 minutes on 3500Dx/3500xL Dx and 3130/3130xl genetic analyzer or 8 tests/ 1 hour on GeXP Genetic Analysis system). Moreover, an RT-PCR internal control was added to each specimen prior to extraction to monitor the whole process including nucleic acid extraction, RT-PCR and capillary electrophoresis.\n\nA limitation of 13\u00d7 kit is that an automated capillary electrophoresis system is needed and many clinical laboratories do not have this highly specialized laboratory equipment. Besides, 13\u00d7 kit is unable to distinguish the infection between CP and CT on the etiology, and the etiological significance of MP, CP or CT in the co-infection or the severity of patients remains unclear due to the limited data in this study.\n\nIn conclusion, our present study highlights the important role of respiratory viruses and atypical pathogens in hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections. The utilization of the 13\u00d7 kit in clinical settings will be helpful for doctors to assess clinical outcome according to virus type or multiple infections, and to limit the use of antibiotics.\n\nNone. \n\nAll aspects of the study were performed in accordance with national ethics regulations and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China."}
