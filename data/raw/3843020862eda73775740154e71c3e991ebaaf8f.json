Neither AP-A nor AP-N were affected by these sulphydryl compounds. Inhibition of AP-W may account for some of the side effects noted with the clinical use of the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors. The availability of compounds which are totally setective for AP-W over any of the other mammalian ceil surface zinc aminopeptidases may aid in identifying endogenous substrates, and thus physiological or pathophysiological role(s) of AP-W.\n\nMammalian cell surface peptidases are involved in the metabolism of a range af biologically active peptides, includingpeptide hormones, neuropeptides and dietary peptides [I] . Some of them are proving to be therapeutic targets in a variety of disease states, including heart disease, inflammation and metastasis [2, 3] . Several cell surface peptidases have recently been identified as cluster differentiation (CD?) antigens. For example, endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) has been shown to be identical to the common acute lymphocytic leukaemia antigen (CALLA; CDlO) [4] , aminopeptidase N (AP-N; EC 3.4.11.2) to CD13 [S] . dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5) to CD26 [6] and aminopeptidase A (AP-A; EC 3.4.11.7) to the murine P-lymphocyte differentiation antigen BP1/6C3 [7] . The role(s) of these peptidases in metastasis is unclear, although the termination or generation of peptide signals affecting the proliferation of transformed and normal cells is a possibility. In addition, AP-N has been identified recently as a receptor in both pigs and humans for the coronaviruses TGEV and 229E, respectively [S, 91.\n\nThe zinc aminopeptidases constitute a relatively large subdivision of the mammalian cell surface * Corresponding author.

To date four distinct enzymes have been characterized: AP-N, AP-A, aminopeptidase P (AP-P; EC 3.4.11.9) and aminopeptidase W (AP-W; EC 3.4.11.16). AP-P is somewhat different from the other three in being anchored in the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinosito1 moiety [lo] and in having a strict requirement for Pro in the penultimate position of susceptible substrates [ 111. AP-N, the best characterized of this class, displays a broad substrate specificity 1121 and has been identified as the major activity releasing the Nterminal Tyr from the enkephalins [ 131. The enzyme may also play a role in the metabolism of cholecystokinin-8 [14] and neurokinin A 1151. AP-A hydrolyses acidic residues from the N-terminus of susceptible substrates and may be involved in the in uivo conversion of angiotensin I1 to angiotensin III [16] . AP-W preferentially hydrolyses short peptides and exhibits maximal rates towards di~ptides in which the Pi residue is aromatic [17, IS]. So far, AP-W has not been implicated in the metabolism of any biologically active peptide, due in part to the lack of a selective inhibitor. The specificities of these latter three aminopeptidases overlap to a certain extent often leading to difficulties in identifying unequivocally the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of a particular peptide.\n\nAlthough several inhibitorsof the aminopeptidases are available, most of these are effective on more than one enzyme. We observed recently that certain compounds designed as supposedly selective inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) also inhibited AP-P with I~,, values in the micromolar range 1191. In the present study we have extended this work by directly comparing the effect of a range of converting enzyme inhibitors on the activities of AP-A, -N and -W in an attempt to identify compounds which could be used to discriminate between these activities and thus be useful tools for delineating the role of a particular peptidase in the metabolism of a biologically active peptide.\n\nIn addition, we have reassessed the inhibitory profile of a number of compounds which have been characterized as inhibitors of the zinc aminopeptidases.\n\nAP-N and AP-W were purified from pig kidney cortex as described previously \n\nThe effect on the activity of AP-A, -N and -W of specific metallopeptidase inhibitors (at a final concentration of 0.1 mM) was examined ( The aminopeptidases were assayed with the appropriate substrate as described in Materials and Methods.\n\nThe results are the means 2 SEM of three independent determinations with each inhibitor.\n\nany of the arnin~~~~tj~as~s s~gni~~an~1~ (maximally l?%f, except for &orphan which caused 30% inhibition of AP-W. The inhibition of the three aminopeptidases by amastatin, bestatin and probestin was examined in more detail (Fig. 1) . Amastatin was equipotent with all three aminopeptidases (I~(, = 1.5-3.2pM). However, probestin was same 100-4OO-fold more potent an inhibitor of AP-N (I~,, = 50nM) than of either AP-A or AP-W (1~0 = 19.9 and S.O@I, respectively). In contrast, bestatin was an II-fold more potent inhibitor of AP-W (tso = 7.9 ,uM) than AP-N (I~~) = 89.1 yM).\n\nThe effect on the activity of AP-A, -N and -W of specific inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (at a final concentration of 0.1 mM) was also examined ( Table 2 ). AP-A was not significantly inhibited (maximally 13%) by any of the inhibitors tested. Only ~ndolaprilat, pentopritat, ramiprifat and spirapritat caused partial inhibition (maximally 30%) of AP-N. None of the carboxylalkyl or phosphoryl inhibitors caused >28% inhibition of AP-W.\n\nHowever, the sulphydryl compounds, captoprii, rentiapril, YS 980 and zofenoprilat, all caused significant (>54%) inhibition of AP-W. The effect of these sulphydryl compounds on the activity of AP-W was examined in more detail (Fig. 2) . These results indicate that rentiapril (I~,) = 1.6 pM) was the most potent at inhibiting AP-W, with zofenoprilat (I~~ = 7.0 PM), YS 980 (I$~, = 17.7 PM) and captopril (I~~) = 199 FM) being increasingly less potent.\n\nIn the present study we have directly compared (c) YS 980; (d) captopril. Table 3 ). These results are somewhat surprising as bestatin has long been considered a potent inhibitor of AP-N and has been used extensively to inhibit this activity in metabolic studies [27.28]. It was originally noted, however, that bestatin inhibited monkey and canine kidney cell surface leucine aminopeptidase activity (probably AP-N) with an I~,, value in the range 32-162pM [29] . Bestatin has been shown to display immunomodulating properties 129-311 and to act as an antitumour agent [32-341. These chemotherapeutic actions are believed to be due, in part, to its inhibition of cell surface AP-N. However, in the light of the present results, these actions may either/also be due to inhibition of cell surface AP-W.\n\nProbestin was isolated recently from Streptomyces azureus and shown to inhibit AP-N [35]. In the present study, we show that probestin also inhibits AP-A and AP-W with I~,) values in the micromolar range (see Table 3 ). Thus, probestin appears to be a relatively broad acting aminopeptidase inhibitor, although it is somewhat more potent against AP-N. Amastatin was originally identified as an inhibitor of AP-A [36], and has since been shown to inhibit also AP-N [26] and AP-W [18] . In this study, we have directly compared the inhibitory potency of amastatin with AP-A, -N and -W and obtained results in agreement with these earlier reports, indicating that amastatin is essentially equipotent against these three enzymes (see Table 3 ). Actinonin was originally identified as an inhibitor of AP-N which lacked activity towards AP-A [37] . and it has also been shown not to inhibit AP-W [18]. These results have been confirmed in the present study (see Table  3 ). Thus, within the cell surface aminopeptidase family, actinonin can be considered as a selective inhibitor of AP-N.\n\nDue to the key role played by angiotensin converting enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system. numerous inhibitors of this zinc peptidyl dipeptidase have been synthesized and some have been used successfully in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure [38,39]. These compounds can be divided into three classes depending on the group that coordinates to the active site zinc atom: (i) sulphydryl, (ii) carboxylalkyl and (iii) phosphoryl. Recently, we observed that AP-P was sensitive to inhibition by some of these converting enzyme inhibitors [19] . In the present study we have extended these observations by assessing the effect of inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme on AP-A, -N and -W. None of the compounds examined caused significant inhibition of AP-A or AP-N. However, the sulphydryl compounds rentiapril, zofenoprilat and YS 980 all inhibited AP-W with I~,, values in the micromolar range (1.6-17.7 PM). These sulphydryl compounds are all analogues of captopril [38] . YS 980 is structurally identical to captopril apart from having a sulphur atom at position 4 of the prolyl ring. Zofenoprilat differs from captopril in possessing an aromatic ring attached to position 4 of the prolyl ring by a sulphur bridge. while rentiapril differs from YS 980 in having a hydroxylated aromatic ring attached to position 5 of the prolyl ring. The increased potencies towards AP-W of rentiapril and zofenoprilat may be due to their large aromatic moieties mimicking the aromatic Pi residue of the substrate. The order of potency of these sulphydryl compounds is essentially the reverse of that seen with AP-P [19] where the order was YS 980 (15s = 19.5 PM), captopril (I~,, = 110 ,uM), zofenoprilat (USA = 44OyM) and rentiapril caused only 35% inhibition at a concentration of 1 mM. The slight inhibition of AP-W observed with thiorphan (Table  1 ) is probably also due to the zinc coordinating sulphydryl group in this compound.\n\nEven though the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors are loo-fold less potent at inhibiting AP-W than angiotensin converting enzyme [19] , an in vitro 150 value in the micromolar range may be significant in causing inhibition of AP-W in vivo. For example, teprotide, the first effective converting enzyme inhibitor in vivo, displays an rso toward the enzyme of 1.0 PM [40] . In addition, the inhibitor of membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11), cilastatin, which is coadministered with the @actam antibiotic imipenem to prevent its metabolism by dipeptidase in the kidney, displays an 150 value of 0.1 FM in vitro [41] . In clinical use, numerous side effects have been noted with captopril, including coughing, skin rashes and taste disturbance [39, 42] . The cause of these adverse effects remains unclear, ahhough similar side effects have been noted with penicillamine leading to speculation that the sulphydryl group may be responsible. The results of the present study suggest that these effects may be due to additional inhibition of AP-W by the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that both amastatin and probestin have broad inhibitory profiles acting on the three cell surface zinc aminopeptidases A, N and W. We also confirm that actinonin is a relatively selective inhibitor of AP-N, but that bestatin is a relatively poor inhibitor of this peptidase and is much more potent towards AP-W. This raises the question as to whether the chemotherapeutic properties of bestatin may involve inhibition of AP-W. The observation that the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors, rentiapril and zofenoprilat, are relatively potent and totally specific for AP-W over any of the other cell surface zinc aminopeptidases should enable the role of this enzyme in the metabolism of bioactive peptides under normal and disease situations to be assessed, and may explain some of the side effects noted with the clinical use of these compounds. However, no selective inhibitor of AP-A has been identified. "}
