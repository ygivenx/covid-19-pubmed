The inflammatory networks exhibits significantly higher variability in the protein expression levels than that in the normal networks for the H5N1 and H1N1 infections. P-values are from an one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test.

The average relative errors (AREs) of all nodes are less than 0.1 in the constructed normal and inflammatory networks ( Supplementary Fig. S21) , suggesting that the accuracy and reliability of the constructed networks.\n\nBased on the same computational and statistical analysis as in the main text, we found that there are not significant differences in the entropies and the variance of protein expression levels between the normal and inflammatory networks for HCV infection ( Supplementary Fig. S16) , which is very different from those for IAV infection (Figure 3 and Supplementary Fig. S7 ). In addition, Supplementary Fig. S17 shows that there are not significant differences in these common network metrics between the normal and inflammatory networks.\n\nThese results indicated that both the network entropy and other network metrics cannot discriminate normal networks from inflammatory networks for HCV infection.\n\nWe also used the TSN-PCD algorithm 4 to identify protein complexes during HCV infection. Surprisingly, the protein complex (TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5), which was predicted to be important for controlling IAV-induced inflammation, has not been identified in the normal and inflammatory networks with HCV infection.\n\nCorrelations. Compared to the normal network, the local network entropies of the three proteins (TNFSF10, HDAC4, HDAC5) were increased in the inflammatory networks, while those of TNF\u03b1, NF\u03baB and COX-2 were all reduced after HCV infection, which were opposite to those in IAV infection. Moreover, Supplementary Table S22 showed that there were no strong correlations between the entropies of TNFSF10, HDAC4, HDAC5 and those of the three proteins TNF\u03b1, NF\u03baB and COX-2.\n\nIn summary, these results suggested that the pathogenesis of HCV infection is quite different from that of IAV infection. Our findings in this study are specific to the pathogenesis of IAV disease. However, our investigation supports the quantitative analysis of applying network-based approaches to elucidate the characteristics of infectious diseases and provide a rationale for developing specific intervention strategies to reduce the risk of infectious diseases. These findings can serve as a significant foundation for further exploring the molecular mechanisms of other infectious diseases and developing control strategies."}
