{"title": "Replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human respiratory Aleksandra Milewska a", "body": "Coronaviruses constitute a large family of RNA viruses that infect mainly mammals and 41 birds. In humans, there are four species associated with mild-to-moderate respiratory infections. 42 While these viruses are present in the human population for a long time, they are believed to 43 enter the human population in a zoonotic event, and one may speculate that they may have 44 caused epidemics similar to the one observed for the SARS-CoV-2. Time to the most recent 45 ancestor analysis suggests that human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 is the oldest species in humans, 46 followed by its cousin HCoV-229E and two betacoronaviruses, which emerged in humans in a 47 relatively near past 1, 2, 3, 4 . In the 21 st century, we already faced the emergence of the three novel 48 coronaviruses in humans, of which SARS-CoV disappeared after one season never to come 49 back, and MERS-CoV never fully crossed the species border, as its transmission between 50 humans is highly ineffective 5, 6, 7 . The 2019 zoonotic transmission, however, resulted in the 51 emergence of a novel human coronavirus, which seems to carry an optimal set of features 52 allowing for its rapid spread with considerable mortality. Whether the virus will become 53 endemic in humans is an open question 8, 9, 10 .\n\nAt present, the studies on the virus are carried out using a surrogate system based on the 55 immortalized simian Vero E6 cell line 11 . While this model is convenient for diagnostics and 56 testing of some antiviral drugs, it has serious limitations and does not allow for the 57 understanding of virus biology and evolution. To make an example, the entry route of human 58 coronaviruses varies between the cell lines and differentiated tissue, not mentioning the immune 59 responses or virus-host interactions 12, 13, 14 .\n\nHere we used the fully differentiated epithelium cultures to study the infection with the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.999029 doi: bioRxiv preprint primarily ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium.\n\nThe HAE cultures reconstitute the tissue lining the conductive airways of humans. Fully 68 differentiated, are among the best tools for studying the viral infection in a natural 69 microenvironment 15 . These air-liquid interphase cultures contain a number of cell types (e.g., 70 basal, ciliated, and goblet). At the same time, they also functionally reflect the natural tissue 71 with extensive crosstalk and production of protective mucus and surfactant proteins 16, 17, 18 . The science, but also the antiviral drug development 12, 13, 14, 20 .\n\nHere we verified whether HAE cultures may be used to study the SARS-CoV-2 infection The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.999029 doi: bioRxiv preprint The analysis clearly showed that the sg mRNA are abundant in the infected HAE cultures.\n\nAs this is generally considered to be the hallmark of an active replication, we believe that it 107 provides sufficient proof that the virus is indeed actively replicating in the cultures.
