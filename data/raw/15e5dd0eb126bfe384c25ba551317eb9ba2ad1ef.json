{"title": "Title: Perceptions of the Adult US Population regarding the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak Short title: Perceptions regarding Novel Coronavirus Outbreak", "body": "Background: The current novel coronavirus outbreak, COVID-19, has spread to 28 countries and territories with tens of thousands infected and thousands of deaths (1) . Although risk of contracting the disease in the United States (US) is currently low (2) , it is important to understand risk perceptions about COVID-19 and trust in political and public health/scientific leadership among the US population to better inform messaging and policies (3) .\n\nObjective: In the first study of its kind on COVID-19, our objective was to survey the adult US population to better understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nMethods: Data were collected using an electronic questionnaire via Qualtrics\u00ae (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). Participants completed the questionnaire through the CloudResearch (4) online platform in early February 2020. We asked participants to rank who they felt should lead the US response to COVID-19. Options included the president, Congress, the Director of the Participants provided informed consent prior to data collection.\n\n.

Over 90% of our sample was aware of the COVID-19 mostly through the news (n = 522, 73%). The majority of participants wanted the CDC Director (n = 382, 53%) or the NIH Director .

However, only 13% of participants wanted the president (n = 91) or Congress (n = 5, 1%) to lead the response (Figure 1 ). The mean risk perception score was 5.0 out of 10 (SD = 1.9; Figure 2 ). Strict policies for infection prevention including quarantine (n = 571, 83%) and travel restriction (n = 519, 75%) were endorsed by most participants. Additionally, thirty-five percent of participants supported \"temporary discrimination based on someone's country of origin\" in case of an outbreak (n = 244, 35%). .

We found that the public trusted the CDC director to lead the COVID-19 response with trust in the public health/scientific leadership being high. Responsive, open, and respectful communication with the US population by these agencies may improve public health compliance and safety. 3 Furthermore, although participants reported relatively low risk perception, many supported restrictive policies for infection prevention. A portion of the sample also supported temporary discrimination based on someone's country of origin. These responses are concerning, and preemptive targeted messaging by the public health agencies is required to ensure a compassionate response to this outbreak. Our findings may be influenced by possible selection bias because participants needed a CloudResearch account and access to smartphone/computer to participate. However, our sample was fairly representative of the general adult US population. A weighted analysis based on age and gender demonstrate that our results are generalizable to national population ( Table 2) . Data for weighted analysis were extracted from US Census data. 6 \n\nNovel coronavirus is a respiratory disease caused by a viral infection. Displayed symptoms usually include respiratory symptoms accompanied by fever, but novel coronavirus is not contagious. Novel coronavirus can progress to a severe illness but never leads to death. Don't know\n\nNovel coronavirus is transmitted through coughing or sneezing. Novel coronavirus is not transmitted by close contact with people. Don't know.\n\n6. Which of the following is correct about \"close contact\" of novel coronavirus? \"Close contact\" involves a direct contact with persons' respiratory secretions. Relatives and healthcare workers are excluded from the category of close contact. Don't know. 7. Which one is correct about the treatment or vaccine for the novel coronavirus?\n\nThere is a curative treatment for novel coronavirus Currently, there is neither a curative treatment nor a vaccine Currently, there isn't a curative treatment, but there is a vaccine Don't know. .
