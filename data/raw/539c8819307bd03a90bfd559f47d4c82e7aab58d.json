{"title": "", "body": "In duplex part, optical melting result (-12.9 kcal/mol) of model duplex (5\u0384GAACAAACGG3\u0384/3\u0384AACUUGUUUGF5\u0384 in Table 1 ) made less favorable by 1.9 kcal/mol for 3\u0384 dangling AA (62) and 2.7 (=0.82+1.9) kcal/mol for 5\u0384FG/3\u0384GGC terminal overhangs, made more favorable by 2.36 kcal/mol for 5\u0384CG/3\u0384GC nearest neighbor parameter (39) and 2.1 (=0.82+1.3+0.0) kcal/mol for 5\u0384FC/3\u0384GGG terminal overhangs. Here 5\u0384FC/3\u0384G is approximated as the 0.82 kcal/mol of 5\u0384FG/3\u0384C (Table 1) Plots of reported vs T m for the BWYV pseudoknot (45) reveal the possibility that the transitions F\u2192PK and PK\u2192HP may have non-zero . Reported errors in values are \u00b115% (45), which does not allow a reliable estimate of . The data, however, indicates the possibility that for transitions F\u2192PK, PK\u2192HP, and HP\u2192U can be on the order of -700, -330, and -20 calK -1 mol -1 , respectively. Points shown as diamonds are excluded from linear fit."}
