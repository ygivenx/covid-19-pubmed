{"title": "", "body": "In the models the following assumptions were made:\n\n\u2022 Attack rates of 25%, 30% and 50%; \u2022 The age specific attack and complication rates are as in a normal influenza epidemic; \u2022 Health care including application of antibiotics will be equal to a normal influenza epidemic; \u2022 Therapeutic use of one treatment of neuraminidase inhibitors (applied within 48 hours after onset of symptoms) gives 50% reduction in hospital admissions and mortality; \u2022 No upper limit inhibitors shortage has been incorporated in models; \u2022 Total high risk group per 100,000 inhabitants is based on registrations from the general practitioners databases; \u2022 Duration of the pandemic period is based on historical data, although local and regional differences in duration can occur; \u2022 Basic reproductive number R 0 was set on 1.4\n\nTotPop = Total Population divided in age and risk groups PopatRisk = Population at risk HCcmr Influenza-like illness = Number of general practitioner consults per 100,000 inhabitants ZHObaltussen = Number of hospital admissions per 100,000 inhabitants (adapted from Baltussen (3)) Ssprenger = Mortality contributable to influenza per 100,000 inhabitants (adapted from Sprenger (4) All models are based on 0.3% hospital admission rate for infected patients. Changing this rate will have a significant impact on the peak demand for hospital beds and ICU beds. The maximum number of regular hospital beds in the 15 hospitals in the three Northern provinces of the Netherlands equals 5,629 of which 3,940 could be washed out for influenza related hospital admissions (30% of all admissions is acute, non-influenza related care). The maximum number of intensive care beds which could be washed out for influenza related care equals 136. In the next tables we present the difference (i.e. surplus or deficit) between demand and capacity for ICU beds at the peak of the pandemic for a mean length of stay of 8 and 15 days with a maximum of 136 available ICU beds for different hospital admission rates and 30% attack rate. For example: with 0.3% hospital admission rate, 50% ICU admission rate and a mean length of stay of 8 days and no intervention with antiviral medication (table 3B1) , a shortage of 143 ICU beds will occur at the peak of the pandemic. Dividing these 143 beds over 15 hospitals will leave every hospital with a shortage around 10 ICU beds. For a short period of time this shortage can be bridged by utilizing any form of respiratory support available in the hospitals (operating room ventilators, medical specialist and nurses, medical students etc.)"}
