{"title": "Two resource distribution strategies for dynamic mitigation of influenza pandemics", "body": "Influenza pandemics have historically ensued enormous societal calamities amplified by staggering economic forfeitures. In the U.S. alone, the Spanish flu (1918, serotype H1N1), the Asian flu (1957, H2N2), and the Hong Kong flu (1968, H3N2) resulted in the death toll of more than 500,000, 70,000 and 34,000 cases, respectively.1 More recently, a series of scattered outbreaks of the avian-to-human transmittable H5N1 virus has been mapping its way through Asia, the Pacific region, Africa, the Near East, and Europe.2 As of March 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 287 deaths in 486 cases, worldwide.3 At the same time, in Spring 2009, a milder human-to-human transmissible H1N1 virus subtype resurfaced and propagated to an ongoing global outbreak; as of March 2010, 213 countries have been affected with a total number of infections and mortalities of 419,289 and 16,455, respectively.4 Today, most experts have an ominous expectation that the next pandemic will be triggered by an emerging highly pathogenic virus, to which there is little or no pre-existing immunity in humans.5\n\nThe ability to contain and mitigate influenza pandemics depends on available emergency response infrastructure and resources, and at present, challenges abound. Prediction of the exact emerging virus subtype remains a difficult task, and once it is identified, a surge production of sufficient vaccine quantities can take from six to nine months.6,7 Even if the emerged subtype has a known epidemiology, the existing stockpiles would be limited due to high production and inventory costs.8,9 Also will be significantly constrained the supply of antiviral, immunizers and other healthcare providers, hospital beds and supplies, and logistics. Thereby, pandemic mitigation has to be done amidst a limited knowledge of disease and population dynamics, constrained infrastructure, shortage of effective clinical treatments, and to-be-proven resource allocation policies. This challenge, faced during the recent H1N1 outbreak, has been acknowledged by WHO9 and echoed by the Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).10,11\n\nThe existing literature on pandemic influenza (PI) modeling aims to address various complex aspects of the pandemic evolution process including: (i) underlying spatio-temporal structure, (ii) contact dynamics and disease transmission, (iii) disease progression, and (iv) development of mitigation strategies. A comprehensive decision-aid model for containment and mitigation has to invariably consider all of the above aspects: it must incorporate the mechanism of disease progression, from initial infection, to the asymptomatic phase, manifestation of symptoms, and a final health outcome;12\u201314 it must also consider the population dynamics, including individual susceptibility15,16 and transmissibility,12,17\u201319 as well as the behavioral factors that affect infection generation and disease progression;20\u201323 finally, it must incorporate the impact of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures, including vaccination, antiviral therapy, social distancing and travel restrictions, and use of low-cost measures, such as face masks and hand washing.24\u201327\n\nIn recent years, the models for PI containment and mitigation have focused on integrating therapeutical and non-therapeutical measures in search for synergistic strategies, aimed at better resource utilization. Most of these approaches implement a form of social distancing to reduce infection exposure, followed by application of pharmaceutical means. A number of significant contributions has been made in this challenging area.1,25,28\u201332 One of the most notable among the recent efforts is a 2006\u201307 initiative by the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS)33 which examined independent models of large-scale PI spread for rural areas of Asia,34,35 U.S. and U.K.,36,37 and the city of Chicago.38 MIDAS cross-validated the models by simulating the city of Chicago, with 8.6 M inhabitants, and implementing targeted layered containment.39,40 The research findings of MIDAS and other institutions14,25 were used in a recent \u201cModeling Community Containment for Pandemic Influenza\u201d report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), to formulate a set of recommendations for mitigating PI at a local level.41 These recommendations were used in a pandemic preparedness guidance developed jointly by CDC, HHS, and other federal agencies.42\n\nAt the same time, the IOM report points out several limitations of the MIDAS models, observing that \u201cbecause of the significant constraints placed on the models\u201d being considered by policy makers, \u201cthe scope of the models should be expanded.\u201d The IOM recommends \u201cto adapt or develop decision-aid models that can ... provide real-time feedback during an epidemic.\u201d The report also emphasizes that \u201cfuture modeling efforts should incorporate broader outcome measures ... to include the costs and benefits of intervention strategies\u201d.41 It can indeed be observed that practically all existing approaches focus on assessment of apriori defined strategies; virtually none of the synergistic decision models are capable of \u201clearning\u201d, ie, adapting to changes in the pandemic course, yet predicting them, to generate a dynamic optimal strategy. Such a strategy is advantageous in its ability to be state-dependent, ie, as being formed dynamically as the pandemic spreads, by selecting the optimal combination of available mitigation options at each decision epoch, based on the present pandemic state.\n\nIn an attempt to address the IOM recommendations, we present two novel simulation-based optimization models for developing dynamic predictive resource distribution strategies for a network of regional pandemic outbreaks. In both models, the underlying simulation mimics disease and population dynamics of the affected regions (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). The quantity-based optimization model (Section 2.3) generates a progressive allocation of limited quantities of mitigation resources, including stockpiles of vaccines and antiviral, healthcare capacities for vaccination and antiviral treatment, and social distancing enforcement resources. The budget-based optimization model (Section 2.3.1) allocates a total resource budget, as opposed to a separate allocation of individual resources, which vary in their relative cost and effectiveness. Both models seek to dynamically minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks, spreading from the ongoing regions. The optimality criterion incorporates measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, translated into the societal and economic costs of lost productivity and medical expenses. The models were calibrated using historic pandemic data and implemented on a sample cross-regional outbreak in Florida, U.S., with over four million inhabitants (Section 3). We present a sensitivity analysis for estimating the marginal impact of changes in the total budget and quantity availability (Section 3.4), and show that the quantity-based approach is inferior to the budget-based strategy, which takes advantage of its ability to balance the relative cost and effectiveness of individual resources.\n\nCompared to our earlier work,43 this paper presents the following main advances: (i) the original single-region simulation43 has been expanded to serve as the basis for the cross-regional simulation model presented in this paper; (ii) we now propose two novel dynamic optimization models, embedded in the cross-regional simulation, to generate resource distribution strategies; as such, the decision support power of our model has substantially increased; (iii) the calibration methodology now incorporates both the basic reproduction number and the infection attack rate; inclusion of the latter adds to a more accurate assessment of the pandemic severity over the entirety of the pandemic period, and (iv) our model now incorporates certain socio-behavioral features, such as the target population compliance.\n\nThe model initializes by creating mixing groups and population dynamics for each region (see Section 2.1). A pandemic is triggered by injecting one infectious case into a randomly chosen region. The resulting regional contact dynamics and disease propagation are presented in Section 2.2. As the symptomatic cases start seeking medical assistance, the new regional outbreak is detected, and a resource allocation is generated (see Section 2.3) and passed over to the single-region model.\n\nThe outbreak spreads to unaffected regions as infectious travelers pass with some probability through border control (the probability varies with the degree of symptom manifestation). Travelers are assumed to act independently. Each traveler is assumed to seed a regional outbreak in her destination with an equal, time-homogeneous probability \u03c9 for the entirety of her infection period. For each unaffected region, the outbreak probability at time t is calculated using the binomial probability law, as follows\n(1)Pt=1\u2212(1\u2212\u03c9)nt,where nt denotes the number of infectious travelers in the region at time t. Based on the outbreak probability values, the model determines which of the regions have become new outbreaks (in the testbed implementation, the values of Pt were computed daily). The model also determines if an ongoing outbreak has been contained, based on a certain threshold of the daily infection rate. The cross-regional simulation stops when all outbreaks have been contained.\n\nWe view a region as a set of population centers formed by mixing groups (eg, households, offices, facilities, universities, dormitories, schools, shopping centers, etc.). Each individual is assigned a set of attributes (eg, age, gender, parenthood, workplace, infection susceptibility, probability of travel, etc). Each person is also assigned \u0394t time-discrete (eg, \u0394t = 1 hour) weekday and weekend schedules, which depend on: (i) person\u2019s age and parenthood, (ii) disease status, (iii) travel status, (iv) social distancing decrees in place and person\u2019s compliance. As their schedules advance, inhabitants circulate throughout the mixing groups. It is assumed that at any point of time, an individual belongs to one of the exclusive compartments of susceptible, infected, recovered or deceased.\n\nInfection transmission occurs during contact events between susceptible and infectious cases in the mixing groups. At the beginning of every \u0394t period (eg, one hour), for each mixing group g, the simulation tracks the total number of infectious cases, ng, present in the group. Each infectious case generates rg per \u0394t unit of time new contacts,37 chosen randomly (uniformly) from the susceptible. We make the following assumptions about the contact process: (i) during \u0394t period, a susceptible may come into contact with at most one infectious case and (ii) each contact exposure lasts \u0394t units of time. Once a susceptible has started a contact exposure at time t, she will develop infection at time t + \u0394t with a certain probability that is calculated as shown below.\n\nLet Li(t) be a nonnegative continuous random variable that represents the duration of contact exposure, starting at time t, required for contact i to become infected. We assume that Li(t) is distributed exponentially with mean 1/\u03bbi(t), where \u03bbi(t) represents the instantaneous force of infection applied to contact i at time t. 45\u201347 The probability that susceptible i, whose contact exposure has started at time t, will develop infection at time t + \u0394t is then given as\n(2)P{Li(t)\u2264\u0394t}=1\u2212e\u2212\u03bbi(t)\u0394t.\n\nA schematic of the disease natural history is shown in Figure 2. During the incubation phase, the individual stays asymptomatic. At the end of the latency phase, she becomes infectious and enters the infectious phase.35,37,39 She becomes symptomatic at the end of incubation. At the end of the infectious phase, she enters the final disease stage which culminates in her recovery or death.\n\nMortality for influenza is a complex process affected by many factors and variables, most of which have limited accurate data support from past pandemics. Furthermore, the time of death can be weeks following the disease episode (often attributable to pneumonia related complications).48 Because of the uncertainty underlying the mortality process, we thus adopted a simplified, age-based form of the mortality probability of infected i, as follows\n(3)mi=\u03bci\u2212\u03c4\u03c1i,where \u03bci is the age-dependent base mortality probability of infected i, \u03c1i is her status of antiviral therapy (0 or 1), and \u03c4 is the antiviral efficacy measured as the decrease in the base probability.35 We assume that a recovered case develops immunity but continues circulating in the mixing groups.\n\nMitigation include pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical options. It is initiated upon detection of a critical number of confirmed infected cases,49 which triggers resource allocation and deployment. We assume a certain delay for deployment of field responders.\n\nPharmaceutical mitigation consists of vaccination and antiviral application. Vaccination is targeted at individuals at risk to reduce their infection susceptibility. We assume that a certain fraction of the risk group does not comply with vaccination. The vaccine takes a certain period to become effective (typically, between 10 and 14 days).50 Vaccination is constrained by the available stockpile and administration capacity measured in terms of the number of immunizer-hours.\n\nWe assume that as some symptomatic cases seek medical assistance,51,52 a fraction at risk of them receives an antiviral. Antiviral treatment is subject to availability of the antiviral stockpile and administration capacity, measured in terms of the number of certified providers.\n\nBoth vaccination and antiviral application are affected by social behavioral factors, including conformance of the target population, degree of risk perception, and compliance of healthcare personnel.53\u201355 The conformance level of the population at risk can be affected, among other factors, by the demographics and income level56\u201360 as well as the quality of public information.61 The degree of risk perception can be influenced by negative experiences developed during pharmaceutical campaigns of the previous outbreaks,62,63 as well as by public fear and rumors.64,65\n\nNon-pharmaceutical mitigation includes social distancing and travel restrictions. We adopted a CDC guidance,42 which establishes five categories of pandemic severity and recommends quarantine and closure options according to the category. The categories are determined based on the value of the case fatality ratio (CFR), the proportion of fatalities in the total infected population. For the CFR lower than 0.1% (Category 1), voluntary at-home isolation of infected cases is implemented. If the CFR falls in-between 0.1% and 1.0% (Categories 2 and 3), in addition to the at-home isolation, the following measures are recommended: (i) voluntary quarantine of households members of infected cases and (ii) child and adult social distancing. For the CFR exceeding 1.0% (Categories 4 and 5), all the above measures are implemented. As effectiveness of social distancing is affected by some of the behavioral factors listed above,61 we assume a certain social distancing conformance level. Travel restrictions considered in the model included regional air and land border control for infected travelers.\n\nThe quantity-based and budget-based optimization models have the following form.\n\nBoth models have the same objective function. The first term of the objective function represents the total cost of the new outbreak j, estimated at the nth outbreak epoch, based on\nMinimize   TCjn(q1j, q2j, \u2026, qrj)+\u2211s\u2208CnTCsn(q1s,q2s,\u2026,qrs)\u00b7psn\n\nQuantity-based model\n\nsubject to\nqij+\u2211s\u2208Cnqis\u00b7psn\u2264Qin     \u2200i\u2208R,qij,qis\u22650  \u2200i\u2208R.\n\nBudget-based model\n\nsubject to\n\u2211i\u2208Rci\u00b7qij+\u2211s\u2208Cn\u2211i\u2208Rci\u00b7qis\u00b7psn\u2264Mn,qij,qis\u22650   \u2200i\u2208R.the actual resource allocation {q1j,q2j, \u2026 qrj} (see Eq. 6). The second term represents the total expected cost of outbreaks in currently unaffected regions, based on the virtual allocations {q1s, q2s, \u2026, qrs} and the regional outbreak probabilities \npsn (Eq. 5).\n\nIn the quantity-based model, the set of constraints assures that for each resource i, the total quantity allocated (current and virtual, both nonnegative) does not exceed the total resource availability at the nth decision epoch. Both the objective function and the availability constraints are nonlinear in the decision variables.\n\nIn the budget-based model, the first constraint relates the total available budget at nth decision epoch with the total cost of the resources to be allocated (current and virtual). The second constraint assures a nonnegative allocation.\n\nThe solution algorithm for our dynamic predictive simulation optimization methodology is given below.\n\nDemographic and social dynamics data for each region were extracted from the U.S. Census68 and the National Household Travel Survey.69 Daily (hourly) schedules were adopted from Das and Savachkin, 2008.43\n\nEach infected person was assigned a daily travel probability of 0.24%,69 of which 7% was by air and 93% by land. The probabilities of travel among the four regions were calculated using traffic volume data (Table 1).70\u201373 Infection detection probabilities for border control for symptomatic cases were assumed to be 95% and 90%, for air and land, respectively. These values were reduced by 70% for asymptomatic cases. The value of \u03c9 in Eq. 1 was taken as 0.01. The values of regional outbreak probabilities Pt were calculated once at the end of every day.\n\nThe instantaneous force of infection applied to contact i at time t (Eq. 2) was modeled as\n(7)\u03bbi(t)=\u2212ln(1\u2212pi(t)),  where pi(t)=\u03b1i\u2212\u03b4\u03b8i(t)where \u03b1i is the age-dependent base instantaneous infection probability of contact i, \u03b8i(t), is her status of vaccination at time t (0 or 1), and \u03b4 is the vaccine efficacy, measured as the reduction in the base instantaneous infection probability (achieved after 10 days).50\n\nThe values of age-dependent base instantaneous infection probabilities were adopted from Germann, 200637 (see Table 2). The disease natural history for H5N1 virus included a latent period of 29 hours, an incubation period of 46 hours, and an infectiousness period between 29 and 127 hours.74\n\nBase mortality probabilities (\u03bci in Eq. 3) were determined using the statistics recommended by the Working Group on Pandemic Preparedness and Influenza Response.44 This data shows the percentage of mortality for age-based high-risk cases (HRC) (Table 3, columns 1\u20133). Mortality probabilities (column 4) were estimated under the assumption that high-risk cases are expected to account for of the total number of fatalities, for each age group.44\n\nSingle-region simulation models were calibrated using the basic reproduction number (R0) and the infection attack rate (IAR). R0 is defined as the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical infected case in a totally susceptible population. IAR is defined as the ratio of the total number of infections over the pandemic period to the size of the initial susceptible population. To determine R0, all infected cases inside the simulation were classified by generation of infection.25,34 The value of R0 was calculated as the average reproduction number of a typical generation in the early stage of the pandemic, with no interventions implemented (baseline scenario).25 Historically, R0 values for PI ranged between 1.4 and 3.9.29,34 To attain similar values, we calibrated the hourly contact rates of mixing groups (original rates were adopted from).37 For the four regions, the average value of R0 was 2.54, which represented a high transmissibility scenario. The values of regional IAR averaged 0.538.\n\nMitigation resources included stocks of vaccines and antiviral, capacities for vaccination and antiviral application, and quarantine enforcement resources (required to achieve a target conformance level). We assumed a 24-hour deployment delay following detection of the first infection case.49\n\nThe vaccination risk group included individuals younger than 5 years and older than 65 years.75 The risk group for antiviral included individuals below 15 years and above 55 years.75,76 The efficacy levels for the vaccine (\u03b4 in Eq. 7) and antiviral (\u03c4 in Eq. 3) were assumed to be 40%35,77 and 30%, respectively. We assumed a 95% target population conformance for both measures. The immunity development period for the vaccine was taken as 10 days.50\n\nA version of the CDC guidance for quarantine and isolation for Category 5 was implemented (see Section 4). Once the CFR has reached 1.0%, the following policy was declared and remained in effect for 14 days:42 (i) individuals below a prespecified age \u03be (22 years) stayed at home during the entire policy duration; (ii) of the remaining population, a certain proportion \u03c6 stayed at home and was allowed a one-hour leave, every three days, to buy essential supplies;78 (iii) the remaining (1\u2212\u03c6) non-compliant proportion followed a regular schedule. All testbed scenarios considered the quarantine conformance level \u03c6 (a decision variable) bounded between 50% and 80%.61\n\nAn outbreak was considered contained if the daily infection rate did not exceed five cases, for seven consecutive days. Once contained, a region was simulated for an additional 10 days for accurate estimation of the pandemic statistics. A 25 statistical design of experiment was used to estimate the regression coefficient values of the significant decision factors and their interactions (Section 2.3).\n\nThe simulation code was developed using C++. The running time for a cross-regional simulation replicate averaged 19 minutes on a Pentium 3.40 GHz PC with 4.0 GB of RAM.\n\nThis section presents a performance comparison of the quantity-based and budget-based allocation models. We also present a sensitivity analysis for assessing the marginal impact of changes in the total resource availability. The marginal impact is measured by the change in the total pandemic cost (averaged over multiple replicates), resulting from a unit change in the total quantity/budget availability.\n\nTable 4 summarizes vaccination and antiviral treatment resource requirements for each region, based on the composition of the risk groups (see Section 3). The table also shows the resource costs,79\u201381 budget requirement by each resource, and the total required budget.\n\nTable 5 shows the costs of lost productivity and medical expenses adopted from Meltzer, 199944 and adjusted for inflation for the year of 2010.82\n\nComparison of the two allocation models was done at different levels of the total resource availability relative to the total requirement. The total resource quantity requirements are shown in Table 4 along with the corresponding required budget. The sensitivity analysis was performed for quantity levels of 80%, 65%, 50%, 35%, and 20% of the total quantity requirement, for each resource. The corresponding budget values were computed using resource unit costs from Table 4.\n\nFigures 3a and 3b below show the dynamics of the average number of infected cases and the average number of fatalities for different levels of resource availability. Figure 4 shows the corresponding dynamics for the average total pandemic cost. For illustrative purposes, we also show the average number of regional outbreaks, for both allocation models, in the testbed scenario involving four regions, with Hillsborough as the initial outbreak region (Table 6).\n\nAs expected, the curves for all impact measures (average total number of infected, deaths, and total cost) exhibit a downward trend, for both allocation models, as the total resource availability increases. Increased total resource availability not only mediates a regional pandemic impact but also reduces the probability of spread to unaffected regions. For both models, as the resource availability approaches the resource requirement (starting from approximately 60%), the impact curves show a converging behavior, whereby the marginal utility of additional resource availability diminishes. This can be explained by noting that the total resource requirement was determined assuming the worst case scenario when all regions would be affected and provided with adequate resources to cover their respective populations at risk. It can also be observed that for all three measures, the budget-based model dominates the quantity-based model at all levels of resource availability. This can be attributed to the fact that the budget-based model, being less restrictive as having only one constraint (Section 1), also takes advantage of its ability to balance the relative cost and effectiveness of individual resources, such as vaccine, antiviral, etc. The difference in the performance of two models was as high as 339,079 infected cases, 19,724 fatalities, and 17.84 M in the pandemic cost (all attained at the 20% resource availability). The difference in policy performance gradually diminishes as the resource availability increases and as available quantities become close to be sufficient to cover the entire populations at risk in all regions: at 80% availability, the gap was 118,124 infected, 4,318 fatalities, and 5.07M in the pandemic cost.\n\nEffective mitigation of influenza pandemics has to invariably rely on understanding of evolution of disease and population dynamics and intelligent resource allocation. As recently pointed by the IOM, the existing models fall short of providing dynamic decision support, which incorporates broader outcome measures including \u201ccosts and benefits of intervention\u201d. In this paper, we present two large-scale simulation-based optimization models specifically aimed at addressing these challenges.\n\nThe models support development of dynamic predictive resource allocation strategies for a network of regional outbreaks. In both models, the underlying simulation mimics the disease and population dynamics of the affected regions. The quantity-based optimization model generates a progressive allocation of resource quantities, whereas the budget-based model aims at allocating the total resource budget. Both models seek to minimize the impact of ongoing and expected outbreaks. The impact measures incorporate morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, translated into the societal and economic costs of lost productivity and medical expenses. The models were calibrated using historic pandemic data and implemented on a sample cross-regional outbreak in Florida, with over 4M inhabitants.\n\nSummary of the main results. We observed that for both models, the marginal utility of additional resource availability was steadily diminishing as the resource availability approached the resource requirement for a worst case scenario, in which all regions would be affected. We also showed that the quantity-based model was inferior to the budget-based model at different levels of resource availability. While the budget-based model includes the quantity-based solution as a special case, the former takes advantage of its inherent ability to balance the different relative cost and effectiveness of individual resources. Moreover, the budget-based model is less restrictive (the only constraint is the total available budget), and therefore, it has a richer geometry of feasible solutions at any decision epoch of pandemic evolution. The difference in model performance was particularly noticeable at lower levels of resource availability, which is in accordance with a higher marginal utility of additional availability at that levels. Hence, the budget-based model can be most useful in scenarios with very limited supply of resources.\n\nContributions of the model. The methodology presented in this paper is one of the first attempts to offer dynamic predictive decision support for pandemic mitigation, which incorporates measures of societal and economic impact. Our comparison study of the budget-based versus quantity-based progressive cross-regional resource allocations is also novel. In addition, our simulation model represents one of the first of its kind in considering a broader range of social behavioral aspects, including vaccination and antiviral treatment conformance. The simulation features a flexible design which can be particularized to a broader range of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions and more granular mixing groups.\n\nBased on our methodology, we have also developed a decision-aid simulator with a GUI which is made freely available to general public through our web site at http://imse.eng.usf.edu/pandemics.aspx. The simulator allows the input of data for regional demographic and social dynamics, and disease related parameters. It is intended to assist public health decision makers in conducting customized what-if analysis for assessment of mitigation options and development of policy guidelines. Examples of such guidelines include targeted risk groups for vaccination and antiviral treatment, social distancing policies (eg, thresholds for declaration and lifting, closure options (ie, household-based, schools, etc.), and compliance targets), and guidelines for travel restrictions.\n\nLimitations of the model. Lack of reliable data prevented us from considering geo-spatial aspects of mixing group formation in the testbed implementation. We also did not consider the impact of public education and use of personal protective measures (eg, face masks) on transmission, again due to a lack of effectiveness data.83 We did not study the marginal effectiveness of individual resources due to a considerable uncertainty about the transmissibility of a future pandemic virus and efficacy of vaccine and antiviral. For the same reason, the vaccine and antiviral risk groups considered in the testbed can be adjusted, as different prioritization schemes have been suggested in the literature, based on predicted characteristics of a future virus. The form of social distancing implemented in the testbed can also be modified as a variety of schemes can be found in the literature, including geographical and social targeting. Effectiveness of these approaches is substantially influenced by the policy compliance, for which limited accurate data support exists. It will thus be vital to gather the most detailed data on the epidemiology of a new virus and the population dynamics early in the evolution of a pandemic, and to expeditiously analyze it to adjust the interventions accordingly."}
