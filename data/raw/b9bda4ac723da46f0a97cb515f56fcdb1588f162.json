{"title": "Comparison of Bovine Coronavirus (BCV) Antigens: Monoclonal Antibodies to the Spike Glycoprotein Distinguish between Vaccine and Wild-Type Strains", "body": "Bovine coronavirus (BCV) is a member of the coronaviridae family that causes neonatal diarrhea, a disease with substantial economic impact in the dairy and beef cattle industries. The viral particle is spherical, enveloped with a diameter of around 100 nm, possessing a single-stranded nonsegmented RNA genome of positive polarity. The viral particle is composed of sets of four major structural proteins (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . These consist of the peplomeric glycoprotein (gpl9O/S, gplOO/S), the nucleocapsid protein (p53/N) and its apparent trimer (p160/N), a family of small matrix glycoproteins (gp25/ M, gp26/M, p23/M), and the putative hemagglutinin (gpl24/HE).\n\nProtein processing studies in infected cells indicated that the glycosylated precursor gpl90 is proteolytically cleaved to yield gplOO/S (4). GPlOO/S was shown to be the predominant form of S for BCV as two presumptive comigrating gplOO/S species or a doublet band was reported (4, 5) . A number of other coronaviruses possess similar structural proteins that are targets of the humoral antibody response. MAbs to S of mouse hepatitis virus type 4 (MHV-4), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) neutralized respective virus infectivity (8-12). Immunization of mice with purified S from MHV-4 protected them against a challenge infection with the virus (8). Neutralizing MAbs to S and HE glycoproteins of BCV (Quebec strain) defined two distinct antigenic domains ' To whom reprint requests should be addressed. on the S and three domains on the HE glycoprotein (13).\n\nAntigenic diversity among isolates of several groups of coronaviruses was documented. MAbs to MHV-4 gpl80/90 revealed little conservation among isolates (14). Comparison of TGEV strains with a panel of MAbs evidences differential retention of epitopes (10, 11, 15) . Monoclonal antibodies to the S glycoprotein of FIPV were used to distinguish virulent and avirulent FIPV strains, and to demonstrate antigenic differences between FIPV and FECV strains (9, 16). Serological variation among 5 BCV strains was observed ( 17). Oral vaccination of newborn calves with attenuated BCV protected against infection by the virulent virus within 2-3 days postimmunization of colostrum-deprived calves (18). However, the vaccine has not been completely effective in field trials (19). We analyzed with a panel of MAbs the cross-reactivity of gpl 00/S and p53/N specified by five virulent wild-type strains and two high passage cell-adapted strains, which includes the currently used vaccine strain.\n\nThe cell culture-adapted prototype BCV-L9 was originally isolated in bovine fetal kidney (BFK) cells from diarrhea fluid of a calf (20). This virus was serially passaged 42 times in BFK cells, 16 times in bovine fetal brain cells, 15 passages in bovine fetal spleen (BFS) cells, and for 5-l 0 passages in human rectal tumor(HRT-18) cells. Five other wild-type BCV isolates, initially maintained by calf inoculation, were adapted to HRT-18 cells from diarrhea fluid or intestinal mucosal scrapings of calves with clinical diarrhea and electron micro-scopic evidence of coronavirus infection (21, 22). These strains are: LY-138 (Utah, 1965 ) BCV C-50 (Colorado, 1972 BCV-Miller (Colorado, 1974) BCV-Meeker (Colorado, 1975) and BCV-Fisher (Colorado, 1980) . The vaccine strain of BCV was cultured in HRT-18 cells from the vaccine of Norden Laboratories (Omaha, NE) (20,23). Specific markers of this strain are currently not available. Importantly, cultivation of the BCV wild-type filed strains remained difficult until it was demonstrated that the cytopathic expression of BCV-L9 in cultured bovine cells was enhanced by tt-ypsin (24) and that HRT-18 cells were susceptible to BCV (25).\n\nPlaques of BCV were selected by a method similar to the one described by Takayama and Kim (26) and modified by Jimenez et al. (10) in a plaque assay described earlier (24). The infected cultures were overlaid with 3 ml of 1.2% (w/v) agarose in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium) containing 4 pg/ml final trypsin concentration. A stock of virus was prepared after two consecutive plaque purification passages. The BCV was purified as described (27). MAbs were produced against purified virus preparations from the prototype BCV-L9 as described previously (28).\n\nSodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed in 12% slab gels by the Laemmli procedure (29). Detailed procedures for the analysis of BCV proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blot were described (5, 28) .\n\nWestern blots were performed under mildly denaturing conditions according to Cohen eT al. (30) . Briefly, this technique involved the use of low concentration of SDS (0.1 Yo) and no heat or reducing agent which allows retention of much native conformation and detection of discontinuous epitopes. The presence of antibodies neutralizing BCV infectivity in sera from naturally or experimentally infected calves, or ascitic fluid was detected by the plaque neutralization test as described previously (13, 24) .\n\nThree independent cell fusions produced 200 different hybridoma lines which yielded in 10 cell lines selected on the basis of their reactivity with BCV-specific proteins in Western blots performed under mildly denaturing and denaturing conditions. The most frequent isotype was immunoglobulin Gl (IgGl) (seven MAbs), followed by IgM and IgG2a. The MAb titer, determined by ELISA of ascitic fluids ranged from 103.6 to 104.5. Seven MAbs reacted specifically with gplOO/S in mildly denatured Westerns (Fig. l) , but failed to react in denatured Westerns (not shown). Three MAbs reacted with nucleoprotein p53/N in mildly denatured westerns (Fig. 1 ) and denatured Westerns (not shown). Four MAbs to gplOO/S neutralized BCV effectively by exhibiting neutralization titers that were 160, 320, or 640. In contrast, all three MAbs to nucleoprotein p53/N failed to neutralize the virus infectivity (Table 1) .\n\nMAbs were reacted with proteins specified by five wild-type strains originating from different geographical locations and isolated at different times, and with two related cell-adapted strains in Westerns. The latter group included the currently used vaccine strain and its progenitor laboratory strain BCV-L9 (Table 1) . MAbs to p53/N reacted similarly against p53/N specified by all strains in both Westerns. Three MAbs to BCV-L9 gplOO/S failed to react with gplOO/S specified by other viral strains with the exception of antibodies 44 and 38 which reacted with the vaccine strain (Table 1) . Specifically, three antigenic types of virus were distinguished. One type was the cell-adapted Mebus strain BCV-L9 used as the immunogen for the isolation of the MAbs. The second type was represented by the modified live virus vaccine strain, which differed from the prototype BCV-L9 through the loss of reactivity to MAb 31. The third antigenic type included all five virulent wild-type isolates, distinguished by their failure to react with MAbs 31, 38, and 44. The infectivity neutralizing ability of MAbs against heterologous BCV strains was tested. MAbs 43F6 and 43C2 neutralized all strains, exhibiting small variations in titers. In contrast, MAbs 38 and 44 neutralized the avirulent BCV-L9 and vaccine strains but failed to neutralize the five wild-type strains ( Table 1) .\n\nAll MAbs to gplOO/S reacted in mildly denatured Westerns but failed to react with gplOO/S in denatured Westerns which reveals that the major antigenic domains of gplOO/S were composed of discontinuous amino acids brought together by virtue of the folding of the molecule in three dimensions. Furthermore, the addition of a reducing agent abolished the antigenic reactivity indicating that disulfide bonds were important in stabilizing the tertiary structure of gpl 00/S. Similar results were reported for gplOO/S specified by the BCV Quebec strain (13).\n\nMAbs to gplOO/S reacted exclusively with gplOO/S and failed to detect its precursors gpl7O/S and gpl90/ S in Westerns. It is not clear whether gplOO/S represents the amino-terminal (S,) or carboxyl-terminal (S2) component of the proteolytic cleavage products of S. In contrast, MAbs to BCV (Quebec-strain) were reported to react with gplOO/S precursors and higher molecular weight aggregates (13). The observed differences in reactivity may be due to the different conditions used to solubilize BCV viral proteins or may reflect viral strain-host cell differences in the relative amounts of processed gplOO/S used to produce the immunogens for the generation of the hybridomas. Comparative reactivity of these sets of MAbs would resolve these differences.\n\nMAb cross-reactivity tests with different viral strains revealed strong antigenic variation in gplOO/S among virulent and avirulent strains. In contrast, MAbs to nucleoprotein p53/N cross-reacted with all strains. Cross-reactivity of six out of seven MAbs with gpl 00/S specified by the related avirulent vaccine and BCV-L9 strains infers that these glycoproteins folded into nearly identical conformations. The failure of MAb binding to gplOO/S specified by the wild-type strains implies that their three-dimensional configurations differed significantly. Interestingly, one MAb failed to react with the vaccine strain although it reacted with its progenitor strain BCV-L9. A limited number of replication cycles of the virus in cell culture is evidently sufficient for the emergence of an antigenic variance.\n\nMAbs to the nucleoprotein p53/N reacted in both Westerns illustrating that their target epitopes were composed of continuous amino acids located proximal to each other, thus rendering these epitopes insensitive to denaturation.\n\nNeutralization tests with MAbs to gplOO/S revealed the presence of epitopes associated with virus neutralization. This is in agreement with findings for coronaviruses from other animals (4, 11, 37, 32) and the Quebec strain of BCV (13). Cross-neutralization studies with MAbs to gplOO/S revealed that wild-type strains were not neutralized by two MAbs. Conformational differences detected by the reactivity in Westerns are thus within antigenic areas that are crucial for virus neutralization. Similar observations were reported for mouse hepatitis virus 4 (31, 33) and the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (10, 11). It is conceivable that con-formational differences in gplOO/S of wild-type strains, as compared to the vaccine stain, result in loss of neutralizing sites with subsequent loss of protection following vaccination. None of the five wild-type BCV strains were cultivatable in bovine fetal spleen cells even in the presence of trypsin (22). A unique plaque morphology characterized each BCV strain grown in . The epitopes to MAb 31, 38, and 44 appear to reflect the wider host cell range of the highly cell-cultured adapted L9 and vaccine strains.\n\nGlycoprotein S of coronaviruses is generally implicated in virus adsorption onto eukaryotic cells and in cell fusion (5, 35) . The biological differences in BCV strains reported previously and the differences in the reactivity of MAbs with BCV strains apparently reflect changes in gplOO/S related to virulence and adaptation to cultured cells. Our findings highlight again that gplOO/S is a major target of the humoral response, and it may contain the majority of antigenic domains that are targets for neutralizing antibodies."}
