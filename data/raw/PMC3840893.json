{"title": "Lack of MERS Coronavirus Neutralizing Antibodies in Humans, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia", "body": "Two collections of patient samples were analyzed. The first collection consisted of 158 serum samples taken from children hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections during May 2010\u2013May 2011. The samples came from 77 female and 81 male patients with a median age of 11.6 months (range 7.3 months to 9 years). The second sample collection consisted of 110 plasma samples from men with a median age of 28 years (range 19\u201352 years) who donated blood at the hospital during December 2012.\n\nAnalysis of MERS-S\u2013driven transduction of target cells revealed that none of the samples investigated contained neutralizing antibodies against MERS-S (Figure 1). As a control, a subset of the samples was analyzed for inhibition of cellular entry mediated by the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), an animal virus that does not circulate in Saudi Arabia, and the spike protein of the human coronavirus NL63 (NL63-S), a globally circulating coronavirus. None of the samples robustly inhibited VSV-G\u2013dependent entry, whereas most samples markedly reduced entry-driven by NL63-S (Figure 1), as expected (7). Experiments using serum samples of known neutralizing capacity confirmed that our neutralization experiments were sensitive and specific (Figure 2). Thus, serum samples obtained from a patient infected with MERS-CoV potently inhibited MERS-S but not VSV-G\u2013 or NL63-S\u2013driven entry, whereas the reverse observation was made with serum samples reactive against NL63-S (Figure 2). In sum, none of the samples from children with respiratory infections and none of the samples from healthy adult men showed detectable amounts of MERS-S\u2013neutralizing antibodies, but most neutralized NL63-S\u2013driven host cell entry.\n\nOur results suggest that the estimated MERS-CoV seroprevalence in the area served by King Fahd Hospital was <2.3% in children during 2010\u20132011 and <3.3% in male adults in 2012 (upper limits of the 95% CIs for 0/158 and 0/110, respectively, by Fisher exact test). Our analysis of samples from children might have underestimated seroprevalence because if they were hospitalized for MERS-CoV infection, a virus-specific antibody response might have developed after sample collection. Moreover, although infection of young children has been reported (8), the average age of MERS patients is 50 years. Our findings using samples from adult men argue against the extensive spread of MERS-CoV within this group in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia during 2012, which is noteworthy given recent reports of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infections (9,10). \n\nWe cannot rule out that other diagnostic methods that are not limited to detection of neutralizing antibodies might have identified positive samples in our collection. Future analyses are required to determine MERS-CoV seroprevalence in larger patient collectives and in animal species, such as dromedary camels, that could transmit the virus to humans (4,11)."}
