{"title": "Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV)-based Coronavirus Spike- pseudotyped Particle Production and Infection", "body": "Viral pseudotyped particles are very useful tools for studying the entry pathways that enveloped viruses use and for generating novel gene-delivery vectors. These synthetic enveloped viruses are derived from a parental virus, usually a rhabdovirus or a retrovirus, which forms the core of the particle that can incorporate in its membrane a wide range of viral envelope glycoproteins from heterologous viruses. Several model viruses such as the retroviral murine leukemia virus (MLV) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) or the rhabdoviral vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) have been successfully used to generate viral pseudotyped particles (also named pseudoviruses or pseudovirions). Virus pseudotyping is particularly useful for the following scenarios: (i) to quantify the viral entry process of enveloped viruses using reporter genes like green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase, (ii) to study host cell entry of enveloped viruses that cannot be cultivated in cell culture, (iii) to study entry pathways of risk group (RG) 3 or 4 viral pathogens when biosafety level (BSL) 3 or 4 facilities are not available, (iv) to generate cells stably expressing a specific gene of interest or for specific gene silencing, (v) to produce vectors for gene delivery allowing control over cell tropism. Pseudotyped particles can be used to complement native virus infection assays, especially regarding study of virus entry events.\n\nThe protocol described here is highly adaptable both in terms of scale of production and type of envelope glycoprotein that can be incorporated. It has been extensively used in our research on viral entry of various enveloped viruses, including VSV (Sun et al., 2008) , influenza virus (Tse et al., 2014) and coronaviruses (Belouzard et al., 2009; Millet and Whittaker 2014; Millet et al., 2016) . We have successfully used this method to pseudotype viral envelope glycoproteins from all three classes of viral fusion proteins: influenza hemagglutinin (HA, class I), coronavirus spike (S, class I), Ebola glycoprotein (GP, class I), Semliki forest virus (SFV) E1 (class II), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein (class III). The technique described here is based on work performed by Bartosch and colleagues (Bartosch et al., 2003) , and employs the so-called 'three-plasmid' co-transfection strategy in which producer HEK-293T/17 cells are co-transfected with the following plasmids: a plasmid allowing expression of MLV retroviral core genes gag and pol but lacking the MLV envelope glycoprotein-encoding env gene, a transfer vector containing a luciferase reporter gene flanked by retroviral regulatory LTR regions and a packaging signal, along with a plasmid allowing expression of the desired envelope glycoprotein. The coexpression of these three plasmids allows synthesis of LTR-flanked reporter gene-containing RNA, MLV-derived proteins and heterologous envelope glycoprotein. During pseudotyped particle formation, which occurs at the plasma membrane, the RNAs containing the LTRflanked luciferase gene get incorporated into nascent particles formed by assembly and budding of MLV capsid proteins that also recruit heterologous viral envelope glycoproteins. Upon infection in susceptible cells, the pseudotyped virus entry pathway is solely governed by the heterologous virus envelope glycoprotein used. As such, pseudovirions are excellent surrogates to study the entry pathway of enveloped viruses. Once virus entry has occurred, the pseudotyped virus RNAs are released in the cell and the retroviral reverse transcriptase and integrase then reverse transcribe the molecules into double stranded DNA and integrate them into the genome of target cells. Because the sequence that gets integrated only contains the gene encoding the luciferase reporter but none of the MLV genes, the pseudotyped particles are inherently safer as they only allow for one round of infection. After infection, a simple luciferase assay allows quantification of infectivity of the pseudotyped particle studied.\n\nThe following protocol can form the basis of useful experiments for the study of the heterologous envelope glycoprotein function during virus entry, for example by performing the infection assay using different infection conditions such as receptor/co-receptor expression in target cells, virus binding time and temperature, pH, endocytosis inhibitors, protease inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, etc.\n\nCell culture vessels, plates and tubes \n\nTransfection DMEM (DMEM-T) (see Recipes)\n\nTemperature-controlled water bath (Labnet, model: W1106A)\n\nBiosafety cabinet (Class II-A2) connected to a vacuum aspiration system (Labonco, model: 3440009)\n\nInverted light microscope with 10x objective (Nikon Instruments, model: TS100) for checking cell density and health Millet \n\nPlate rocker in 37 \u00b0C 5% CO 2 cell culture incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fisher Scientific\u2122, model: 13-687-704)\n\nPlate rocker, room temperature (VWR, model: 40000-300)\n\n37 \u00b0C 5% CO 2 humidified cell culture incubator -Symphony (VWR, model: 98000-368)\n\nVortex Genie (Scientific Industries, model: G560)\n\nPocket calculator (Sharp Elsimate, Sharp, model: EL-334TB)\n\nInverted light microscope with 10x objective (Carl Zeiss, model: Axiovert 200) connected to a CCD camera (PCO, model: Sensicam QE)\n\nCentrifuge (Eppendorf, model: 5810R)\n\nGloMax 20/20 luminometer (Promega, model: 2030-100)\n\nLab refrigerator set at 4 \u00b0C (GE Appliances, model: GMR06AAMBRWW)\n\nLab freezer set at \u221220 \u00b0C (SUMMIT APPLIANCE, model: FS-603)\n\nLab freezer set at \u221280 \u00b0C (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Thermo Scientific\u2122, model: UXF30086A)\n\nTimer (VWR, catalog number: 61161-346)\n\nProcedure Day 1\n\nCell culture procedures preparations (performed each time cells and viral pseudotyped particles are manipulated) -see Note 1 for basic recommendations regarding cell culture.\n\nPre-warm cell-culture reagents required in 37 \u00b0C water bath: DMEM-C, DPBS, trypsin.\n\nNote: This is a particularly important step since HEK-293T/17 cells are poorly adherent -see Note 2 for details. 1 . Cell culture and transfection HEK-293T/17 cells were chosen for transfection and production of pseudotyped particles because they are able to be very efficiently transfected. In this protocol, Huh-7 cells were chosen as target cells for infection by pseudotyped particles because they are very permissive to both native MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV S-pseudotyped particle infection. When producing other types of pseudovirions, we recommend to check what is the most suitable cell line for infectivity assays. As cell lines are the basis for production of pseudotyped particles and for infection assays, it is essential that they are maintained as well as possible by passaging them frequently to avoid having overgrown cell monolayers, using freshly made media as much as possible, and using low passage cells when transfecting or infecting them. Poor cell line health and growth often results in low transfection and infection rates, so it is important to exercise care when handling cells.\n\n2. HEK-293T/17 cell adherence\n\nTurn on biosafety cabinet for at least 15 min before starting procedures.\n\nDisinfect all internal surfaces of biosafety cabinet (except top grills) with 70% ethanol-soaked paper towels.\n\nCell seeding (performed in biosafety cabinet)\n\nPlace an 80-90% confluent T75 flask (check by visual inspection using an inverted light microscope) containing HEK-293T/17 cells in sterilized biosafety cabinet.\n\nWash cells twice with 10 ml of pre-warmed DPBS being careful not to dispense liquid directly on cells.\n\nTrypsinize cells with 1 ml of pre-warmed trypsin solution.\n\nRock plate gently with hands so the trypsin solution covers the entire surface of cell monolayer.\n\nIncubate cells at 37 \u00b0C 5% CO 2 incubator for 3-5 min avoiding longer incubation times.\n\nNote: It is crucial to avoid long trypsin incubation times because this typically leads to cells clumping -see Note 3.\n\nGently tap sides of flask to detach cells.\n\nPlace trypsinized flask back into biosafety cabinet.\n\nAdd 4 ml of warmed DMEM-C to neutralize trypsin activity.\n\nResuspend cells by performing repetitive up-down pipetting using a 5 ml serological pipette.\n\nAdd 5 ml of DMEM-C to cells and resuspend cells again.\n\nTransfer 10 ml of cell suspension to a 50 ml Falcon tube.\n\nVortex cells gently for 30 sec.\n\nTransfer 10 \u03bcl of cell suspension to a cell counting chamber using a P20 pipettor and appropriate tip.\n\nCount cells using the cell counting chamber under an inverted light microscope.\n\nCalculate cell density using the calculator.\n\nHEK-293T/17 cells are very useful for this protocol as they typically allow for very high transfection rates. However, these cells tend to adhere poorly to cell-culture treated surfaces, and are easily detached even without trypsin. For this reason, it is important to use pre-warmed Ca 2+ -containing DPBS when performing washes as these cations help with cell adhesion. Also, use of cell culture surfaces coated with poly-D-lysine (coating solution diluted to 40 \u03bcg/ml) are recommended to help with cell adhesion.\n\n3. Trypsin treatment of cells When trypsinizing cells, particularly Huh-7 cells, we found that incubations of more than 5 min at 37 \u00b0C 5% CO 2 incubator was deleterious for counting and cell seeding as cells would clump up and would no longer form evenly distributed cell monolayers. We recommend exercising care when trypsinizing cells and avoiding long incubation times with the protease.\n\nAdd DMEM-C to obtain a final cell density of 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml.\n\nResuspend cells by up-down pipetting and gently vortex tube.\n\nSeed cells to wells of a 6-well plate by adding 2 ml of cells (1 million cells) per well.\n\nGently rock plate back and forth (avoid swirling movement), sideways and diagonally.\n\nIncubate plate at 37 \u00b0C 5% CO 2 incubator for 16-18 h.\n\nC. Transfection (performed in biosafety cabinet)\n\nCheck for cell confluence using a light microscope -ideally cells should be around 40-60% confluency, see Figure 1 .\n\nWarm Opti-MEM in 37 \u00b0C incubator.\n\nCalculate volumes of plasmid DNA and Opti-MEM required for mix A (the quantities given for 1 well of a 6-well plate can be scaled-up or down depending on needs). \n\nAlso, this protocol is performed using a 6-well plate format. This can be scaled up or down according to experimental requirements -see Note 5.\n\nThe ratio of amounts of plasmid DNA used (300 ng pCMV-MLVgag-pol:400 ng pTG-Luc:300 ng envelope-encoding or empty vector) can also be optimized if required (e.g., to increase pseudovirion infectivity), but we recommend to keep the amounts of pCMV-MLVgag-pol and pTG-Luc vectors constant and vary the amount of envelope-encoding vector. Furthermore, in this protocol we have used a 1 \u03bcg DNA:3 \u03bcl Lipofectamine 2000 ratio for the transfections, which has worked very well for our pseudotyped particle productions. However, depending on the expression plasmids and cell lines used, it may be useful to carry out testing and optimization of this ratio. Also, as the transfection procedure increases cell membrane permeability, it is important to avoid antibiotic treatment of cells during that time. Doing so ensures that the cytotoxicity associated with the transfection remains low.\n\nThe following protocol is performed using 6-well plates for the transfection of HEK-293T/17 producer cells. From one well of a 6well plate, approximately 2 ml of pseudotyped particle supernatant can be harvested. If more pseudotyped particle solution is required,\n\nInclude transfection conditions with co-transfection of pCMV-MLVgag-pol and pTG-Luc with a plasmid for positive control particles (VSV-Gpp, e.g., with pCAGGS-VSV-G) and for negative control particles (\u0394envpp, e.g., with pCAGGS empty vector) -see Note 6 for details on pseudotyped particle controls.\n\nCalculate \n\nInclude 2 'safety' wells in volume calculations for mixes A and B of each transfection condition to avoid running out of solutions when performing the same transfection in multiple wells.\n\nHandle Lipofectamine 2000 reagent with care avoiding direct contact with plastic surfaces (tube walls) and always dispense in tubes already containing a liquid solution.\n\nPerform mix A and mix B dilutions according to calculations.\n\nIncubate at room temperature for 5 min.\n\nUse a 1:1 ratio (i.e., 50 \u03bcl each for one well to transfect) of mix A and B and mix solutions by performing multiple up-down pipetting.\n\nIncubate at room temperature for 20 min.\n\nPlace plate of cells to be transfected in incubator and label wells to be transfected with name of viral envelope used.\n\nAspirate supernatants gently and replace with 1 ml of warmed Opti-MEM.\n\nthe same transfection can be performed in multiple wells with the supernatants pooled at the harvesting stage. The protocol can also be scaled up or down depending on needs, by using other culture vessels (such as 10 cm dish or flasks) and by adjusting transfection conditions accordingly. The protocol also details how infection of target cells with pseudotyped particles is performed using 24-well plates. This can also be scaled to the needs of an experiment, for example for high-throughput experiments, the assay can be optimized for infections carried out in 96-well plates by adjusting volumes and using a plate-compatible luminometer. 6. Pseudotyped particle production controls During production of pseudotyped particles, it is important to include particle production controls, an important step that is detailed in this protocol. Typically, 'bald' or '\u0394env' particles (\u0394envpp) are produced by replacing the plasmid encoding the heterologous viral enveloped glycoprotein with an empty vector control. These particles bud out of producer cells, but are devoid of viral envelope glycoproteins. Also, a positive control is also useful to gauge how well the procedure was performed, and typically VSV-Gpseudotyped particles (VSV-Gpp) are used for this. These particles usually reach very high infectivity in many cell types and are thus ideal positive controls.\n\nAdd 100 \u03bcl of transfection mix to each well in a drop-wise manner.\n\nGently rock plates front and back and side to side.\n\nIncubate in 37 \u00b0C 5% CO 2 incubator for 4-6 h.\n\nPre-warm transfection DMEM (DMEM-T, no antibiotics) in 37 \u00b0C water bath.\n\nNote: DMEM-T is used here instead of DMEM-C because the transfection reagent increases cell membrane permeability, which leads to enhanced susceptibility to the cytotoxic effects of antibiotics in the cell culture medium -see Note 4.\n\nAdd gently 1 ml of DMEM-T to each well.\n\nIncubate in 37 \u00b0C 5% CO 2 incubator for 48 h.\n\nD. Harvesting (performed in biosafety cabinet)\n\nLabel cryovials with name of pseudotyped virus (envelope glycoprotein used), date of harvest and initials of user.\n\nCollect supernatants in 50 ml Falcon tubes (solutions from multiple wells can be pooled if they were transfected identically).\n\nSpin tubes in centrifuge at 290 \u00d7 g for 7 min.\n\nPass pseudotyped virus solution through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter using appropriate syringe.\n\nAliquot solution in labeled cryovials (e.g., 1 ml aliquots).\n\nStore tubes at \u221280 \u00b0C -see Note 7 for more details on storage.\n\nDecontaminate with 10% bleach solution all culture vessels, serological pipettes, syringes that have come into contact with pseudotyped virus solutions, with a minimum contact time of 15 min.\n\nNote: This protocol describes how to produce and use pseudotyped particles for infectivity assays. To estimate quantities of particles produced as well as incorporation of specific viral envelope glycoproteins into particles, additional experiments are required such as Western blot analyses or ELISA assays -see Note 8 for details. 7 . Pseudotyped particle storage MLV-based pseudotyped particles retain their infectivity well when stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for several months. However, we recommend avoiding multiple freeze-thaw cycles as these can significantly reduce viral infectivity. We recommend aliquoting pseudovirions stocks into small volumes (1 ml) and thawing what is needed for each infection experiment that is being carried out.\n\nE. Cell seeding for infection (performed in biosafety cabinet)\n\nPlace an 80-90% confluent T75 flask containing Huh-7 cells in biosafety cabinet.\n\nWash cells twice with 10 ml of warmed DPBS being careful not to dispense liquid directly on cells.\n\nTrypsinize cells with 1 ml of warmed trypsin solution.\n\nRock plate gently with hands so the trypsin solution covers the entire surface of cell monolayer.\n\nIncubate cells at 37 \u00b0C 5% CO 2 incubator for 3-5 min avoiding longer incubation times.\n\nNote: It is important to avoid long trypsin incubation times because this typically leads to the clumping of cells as well as cell counting and density problems -see Note 3.\n\nGently tap sides of flask to detach cells.\n\nPlace trypsinized flask back in biosafety cabinet.\n\nAdd 4 ml of warmed DMEM-C to neutralize trypsin activity.\n\nResuspend cells by performing repetitive up-down pipetting using a 5 ml serological pipettor.\n\nAdd 2-3 ml of DMEM-C to cells and resuspend cells again (adjust depending on cell confluency).\n\nTransfer cell suspension to a 50 ml Falcon tube.\n\nVortex cells gently for around 30 sec.\n\nTransfer 10 \u03bcl of cell suspension to a cell counting chamber using a P20 pipettor and appropriate tip.\n\nCount cells using the cell counting chamber under a light microscope.\n\nCalculate cell density using a pocket calculator.\n\nAdd DMEM-C to obtain a final cell density of 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml.\n\nResuspend cells by up-down pipetting and gently vortex tube. 8 . Quantification of particles produced and envelope glycoprotein incorporation This protocol details the procedures for pseudotyped particle production and infection. However, it does not describe the methodology for measuring the amount of particles for each batch produced, which is an important step, especially when comparing infectivity of pseudovirions pseudotyped with different types of viral envelope glycoproteins. \n\nBring luciferase assay lysis buffer (stored at \u221220 \u00b0C) and luciferin substrate (stored at \u221280 \u00b0C) at room temperature.\n\nPlace plate containing infected cells in biosafety cabinet and incubate until temperature has equilibrated to room temperature.\n\nDilute to 1x luciferase assay lysis buffer with sterile water.\n\nAspirate gently the supernatants of cells.\n\nAdd 100 \u03bcl of 1x luciferase assay lysis buffer to each well using the repeater dispenser.\n\nIncubate on rocker at room temperature for 15 min (after incubation, plate can be opened outside of biosafety cabinet).\n\nTurn GloMax 20/20 luminometer on.\n\nPrepare clear 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes for each well to be analyzed by dispensing 20 \u03bcl of luciferin substrate solution in each tube.\n\nAdd 10 \u03bcl of lysed cell supernatant to each 20 \u03bcl luciferincontaining tube, performing quick up-down pipetting and gentle tube flickering immediately followed by placing the tube in tube holder found in the luminometer.\n\nPress 'Measure Luminescence' button on touch screen of luminometer.\n\nRecord reading of relative luciferase units (RLU).\n\nRepeat measurement recording (steps G8-G11) procedure for the other wells.\n\nCollect data for each type of pseudovirion (typical values for coronavirus spike-pseudotyped particles (CoVpp) are in the 10 4 -10 6 RLU range, VSV-Gpp 10 6 -10 8 RLU range and \u0394envpp in the 10 2 baseline RLU range). If the luminometer is connected to a computer, data can be recorded on an electronic file using supplied software.\n\nInclude at least duplicate measurements for each infection condition analyzed. For efficient transfection and pseudotyped particle production, HEK-293T/17 cell confluency should be around the 40-60% range as shown in the above microscopy picture taken with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope. Scale bar represents 100 \u03bcm. Millet "}
