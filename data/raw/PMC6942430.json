{"title": "Tumor\u2010associated macrophages secrete CC\u2010chemokine ligand 2 and induce tamoxifen resistance by activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR in breast cancer", "body": "Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer\u2010related mortality in women.1 Approximately 70% of breast cancers are hormone receptor\u2010positive.2 Although endocrine therapy remains the most effective treatment, its efficacy is limited by intrinsic or acquired endocrine resistance.3, 4, 5 Tamoxifen, a selective ER modulator, is the most common endocrine therapy worldwide 6; hence, resistance to tamoxifen is a major clinical challenge.\n\nSolid tumors such as breast cancer usually contain heterogeneous populations of neoplastic cells, immune cells, and collections of tissue\u2010specific resident and recruited stromal cell types, which together form the TME.7, 8 The relevance of this tumor heterogeneity is linked to various hallmarks of cancer including drug resistance.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Macrophages are diverse cells that show distinct phenotypes depending on their anatomical location and activating stimuli.15, 16 In breast cancer, macrophages can comprise up to 50% of the TME.17 Among them, M2\u2010type macrophages, commonly referred to as TAM, are associated with tumor malignancy.18, 19 CD163, a scavenger receptor, is regarded as a highly specific monocyte/macrophage marker for M2 polarization.20 Escamilla et al reported that TAM are involved in the resistance of patients with prostate cancer to androgen blockade therapy.21 In our previous study, we found a correlation between TAM and tamoxifen resistance in patients with breast cancer, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated.22\n\n\nTumor\u2010associated macrophages secrete a variety of chemokines into the TME including CCL2, which is secreted mainly by macrophages when cocultured with MCF7 cells.23 CCL2 is also known as MCP\u20101 and small inducible cytokine A2. CCL2 belongs to the CC chemokine family that recruits monocytes, memory T cells, and dendritic cells to sites of inflammation.24, 25 Several studies have reported that CCL2 and the inflammatory environment promote the malignant behavior of different tumors.26, 27, 28 Xu et al found that CCL2 recruits monocytes to the TME and polarizes macrophages into the M2 type.25 Secretion of CCL2 is also an important manifestation of TAM polarization in macrophages.29 Ueno et al showed that a high level of CCL2 expression is a significant indicator of earlier relapse.30 However, there have been only a few studies on the role of CCL2 in endocrine resistance of breast cancer.\n\nThe molecular mechanism underlying endocrine resistance of breast cancer is highly complicated and involves many molecules and pathways such as overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor and/or the HER\u20102/neu/ErbB2 oncogene,31 mutations in ER or loss of ER\u2010alpha expression,32, 33 activation of the MAPK 32 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways,34 and overexpression of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes.35 Among these factors, the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is dominant. Thota et al observed induction of endocrine resistance by tumor macrophages, although the intrinsic molecular mechanism remains unclear.36\n\n\nThe aim of the present study was to explore the interaction between TAM and the endocrine\u2010resistant phenotype in breast cancer. CM from tamoxifen\u2010sensitive and \u2010resistant breast cancer cells was tested for its ability to induce macrophage M2 polarization. We then examined the role of TAM in promoting tamoxifen resistance. We also identified a specific cytokine, CCL2, secreted by TAM to promote endocrine resistance and investigated its underlying mechanism of action. CCL2 immunohistochemistry was carried out on pathological sections from patients with invasive ER\u2010positive breast cancer to examine the correlation between CCL2 expression and disease prognosis. Our findings will further the understanding of how TAM promote tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells and may identify novel therapeutic targets for patients with endocrine\u2010resistant breast cancer.\n\n4\u2010Hydroxytamoxifen (4\u2010OH Tam), recombinant human MCP\u20101 (CCL2), the CCL2 synthesis inhibitor Bindarit, and PMA were purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich. Antibodies against CCL2, CD163, nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010\u03baB), and components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway were purchased from Boster. P\u2010FOXK1 was purchased from Invitrogen. Breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D and human monocyte cell line THP\u20101 were purchased from the Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and maintained in RPMI\u20101640 medium supplemented with FBS. Tamoxifen\u2010resistant MCF7 (MCF7\u2010R) cells were obtained by treating MCF7 cells with 1000 nmol/L 4\u2010OH Tam for 3 months. MCF7\u2010R cells were grown in RPMI\u20101640 with 5% FBS and 1000 nmol/L 4\u2010OH Tam to maintain resistance against tamoxifen.\n\nCell proliferation was assessed using CCK\u20108 (Vazyme) assay according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, the cells were seeded in 96\u2010well plates at a density of 1 \u00d7 104 cells/well and incubated with 5 \u03bcmol/L tamoxifen for 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours. At the end of the respective incubation times, the cells were incubated in complete medium containing 10% CCK\u20108 reagent for 2 hours. Subsequently, absorbance of the sample was measured at 450 nm in a microplate reader (Tecan). The experiments were repeated three times.\n\nM\u03a6, MS, and MR human macrophages grown in small culture dishes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes, followed by washing with PBS thrice. Cells were blocked with 5% BSA for 30 minutes, and then incubated with the anti\u2010CD163 antibody (diluted 1:1000) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Signal was detected using Alexa Fluor 488 and 594\u2010conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), and the samples were imaged using the Axioskop 2 mot plus fluorescence microscope equipped with Plan Apochromat 203/0.8 NA and 403/0.95 NA objectives and the AxioCam MRc camera with AxioVision software 4.7.1 (Carl Zeiss).\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from M\u03a6, MS, and MR macrophages using TRIzol reagent and 1 \u03bcg RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using reverse transcriptase (Vazyme). Real\u2010time quantitative PCR (RT\u2010PCR) was done using the SYBR Green I Real\u2010Time Detection kit (CWBio) on the CFX96 Detection System (Bio\u2010Rad). Relative gene expression was normalized to macrophage expression. Primers for the target genes are listed in Table S1.\n\nCCL2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 present in culture supernatants from MCF7\u2010S, MCF7\u2010R, M\u03a6, MS, and MR macrophages were quantified using specific ELISA kits (Quantikine Human CCL2 Immunoassay and Quantikine Human TNF\u03b1 Immunoassay; R&D Systems) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Concentration of the samples was estimated from the standard curve. CCL2 and TNF\u03b1 levels below the detection limit of the assay were recorded as zero.\n\nBreast cancer cells were suspended in RPMI\u20101640 with 10% FBS at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mL. For annexin V\u2010FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining, 100 \u03bcL cells were transferred to a flow cytometer tube, diluted with PBS, and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was then removed by decanting and blotting. For each sample, the pellet was suspended in 100 \u03bcL of 1\u00d7 binding buffer, and 5 \u03bcL Annexin V\u2010FITC was added. The samples were incubated in dark for 15 minutes. Before flow cytometer analysis, 400 \u03bcL of 1\u00d7 binding buffer and 5 \u03bcL of 50 \u03bcg/mL PI were added to each sample. For flow cytometry analysis, PI green fluorescence was dot plotted on the y\u2010axis and Annexin V\u2010FITC orange fluorescence on the x\u2010axis.\n\nMacrophages were washed with PBS. PE mouse anti\u2010human CD163 (BD Pharmingen) was used to analyze M2 polarization of macrophages. The cells were filtered and resuspended in buffer before sorting. All analyses were conducted on FACSDiva (Version 6.1.3).\n\nCells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Protein samples were sonicated followed by centrifugation at 17 153 g for 15 minutes. Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford Assay (Bio\u2010Rad). Protein lysates were then subjected to 4%\u201020% Tris\u2010glycine SDS PAGE, and then transferred onto PVDF membranes according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked in 5% milk\u2010Tris\u2010buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (TBS\u2010T) at 23\u00b0C for 1 hour, followed by incubation with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. On the following day, the membranes were washed with TBS\u2010T thrice before incubation with HRP\u2010conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling) at 23\u00b0C for 1 hour. Protein expression was visualized by ECL chemiluminescence (Promega) and quantified using Image J software (National Cancer Institute).\n\nMicroporous membrane (8\u2010\u03bcm pore size) Transwell inserts (Costar) were used in the chemotaxis assay. Briefly, 2 \u00d7 105 cells in 200 \u03bcL RPMI\u20101640 were added to the upper chamber, and 500 \u03bcL CM from M\u03a6, MS, MR, and MR + Bindarit was added to the lower chamber. THP\u20101 cells were allowed to migrate at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air, and then the inserts were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal staining solution. Non\u2010migratory cells were removed before the membrane was mounted and migratory cells were observed and counted under a microscope.\n\nThe protocol for this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital and conforms to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. Breast cancer specimens were obtained from Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital. All patients signed informed consent forms for medical record review and tissue sample donation. Between December 2003 and June 2014, 100 patients with ER\u2010positive breast cancer were enrolled in this retrospective study. Slides were incubated with anti\u2010CCL2 antibody (1:400 dilution; BioSource International) and anti\u2010CD163 antibody (1:250 dilution; 10D6; Novocastra). Yellow granules indicated CCL2 positivity. CCL2 immunoreactivity was scored by staining intensity (negative, weak, moderate, or strong staining) and the percentage of positive tumor cells per core (\u226425%, >25%\u201050%, >50%\u201075%, and >75%). Tissues were considered positive for CCL2 expression with \u2265moderate staining intensity in >25% of the cells examined. Yellow granules indicated CD163 positivity. CD163 immunoreactivity was scored as the infiltration density of CD163+ macrophages ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (dense). A score equal to or greater than 1 was regarded as positive.\n\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism software (version 6.0) and SPSS Statistics software (Version 19.0). Multiple comparisons were evaluated using the one\u2010way ANOVA. Correlation between CD163 and CCL2 was determined using Spearman rank\u2010order correlation. Survival curves were analyzed using Kaplan\u2010Meier method and curves were compared using the log\u2010rank test. Multivariate survival analysis using the Cox regression proportional hazards model was carried out to adjust for clinical variables that may have statistical significance for prognosis in a univariate analysis. Results with P values <.05 were considered to be statistically significant (*P < .05, **P < .01).\n\nTHP\u20101 cells were first differentiated into macrophage (M\u03a6) by treatment with 320 nm PMA for 24 hours. Then, CM from tamoxifen\u2010sensitive MCF7 (MCF7\u2010S) and tamoxifen\u2010resistant MCF7 (MCF7\u2010R) cells was added to M\u03a6 for another 24 hours of culture (Figure 1A). Finally, we obtained two types of TAM: TAM from a tamoxifen\u2010sensitive TME (MS) and TAM from tamoxifen\u2010resistant TME (MR).\n\nTo examine the differences in the macrophages, cellular CD163 immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis were carried out on the M\u03a6, MS, and MR. CD163 is considered a polarization maker for TAM and M2. We found that CM from breast cancer cell lines increased CD163 expression in M\u03a6, indicating M2 polarization. CD163 expression was higher and M2 polarization was more significant in MR than in MS (Figure 1B,C). These observations indicate that macrophages can be polarized to assume different phenotypes in different microenvironments.\n\nTo investigate the function of macrophages of different phenotypes, supernatants of M\u03a6 and tumor\u2010related macrophages, MS and MR, were added to tamoxifen\u2010sensitive MCF7 cells for 24 hours to obtain MCF7(M\u03a6), MCF7(MS), and MCF7(MR) cells (Figure 1D). The cells were then treated with 5 \u03bcmol/L tamoxifen. Apoptotic flow cytometry analysis was carried out and cell viability was assessed using the CCK\u20108 assay (Figure 1E,F). Significant resistance to tamoxifen was observed in MCF7 cells cultured in CM of TAM (MS, MR), with MCF7(MR) being the most tamoxifen resistant. Thus, we conclude that the increased M2 polarization of TAM increased their ability to resist apoptosis and promote endocrine resistance. Endocrine\u2010resistant cancer cells promote M2 polarization of macrophages, which, in turn, promotes endocrine\u2010resistance in cancer cells.\n\nWe hypothesize that the different abilities of TAM to promote endocrine resistance is due to the different levels of secreted cytokines. After reviewing the relevant literature, we selected seven cytokines (CXCL\u20101, CCL2, CCL5, interleukin [IL]\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201017, and CXCL\u20105) that may promote endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells.37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 Transcription of these seven cytokines in the three macrophages (M\u03a6, MS, and MR) was assessed by RT\u2010PCR to identify the cytokines whose transcription levels were consistent with the trends from the CCK\u20108 and apoptotic flow cytometry assays. Only CCL2 was consistent with the previous results and the difference was statistically significant (Figure 2A). IL\u20106 also has the ability to promote endocrine resistance, and the transcription in MS and MR is different. However, our results showed that the transcription of IL\u20106 in M\u03a6 and MS was not statistically significant. Secretion of IL\u20106 could not explain the difference between M\u03a6 and MS in promoting drug resistance of endocrine tumors. Therefore, IL\u20106 was not chosen as the main object of the present study. To exclude the effect of autocrine CCL2 from cancer cells, we measured CCL2 expression levels in MCF7\u2010S and MCF7\u2010R cells by ELISA, and did not detect significant levels. We then determined the CCL2 concentration in CM from the three macrophages. With M2 polarization of macrophages, the concentration of secreted CCL2 increased significantly. Concentration of CCL2 was positively correlated with the trend of endocrine resistance in MCF7 cells (Figure 2B). Thus, we conclude that CCL2 is associated with endocrine resistance promoted by TAM. Two hormone receptor\u2010positive cell lines, MCF7 and T47D, were selected to test the effect of CCL2. We confirmed that CCR2, the receptor of CCL2, was expressed in both cell lines (Figure S1). CCL2 (100 nm/mL) was added to the two cell lines and the cells were cultured for 24 hours. Subsequently, tamoxifen (5 \u03bcmol/L) was added to all four groups (MCF7, MCF7+CCL2, T47D, and T47D+CCL2) and the cells were cultured for 24 hours. Cell viability was assessed using the CCK\u20108 assay (Figure 2C,D). The four groups were also analyzed by flow cytometry to detect apoptosis (Figure 2E,F). We found that CCL2 promotes endocrine resistance and reduces apoptotic proportion in the two hormone receptor\u2010positive cell lines.\n\nWe have shown that CCL2 is associated with endocrine resistance in MCF7 and T47D cell lines. As the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is a classic pathway regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and endocrine resistance, we investigated the effect of CCL2 on the activation of this pathway. When MCF7 cells were treated with 100 nmol/L CCL2, phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR was significantly increased. Adding CM of MR to MCF7 cells also activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. When MR was treated with 300 nmol/L Bindarit (a CCL2 synthesis inhibitor), the ability of the CM (MR + Bindarit) to increase the levels of phosphorylated Akt and mTOR was weakened (Figure 2G). These results suggest that TAM promote endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells partly by secreting CCL2, which then activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.\n\nCCL2 secretion has been thought to be dependent on the transcription factor NF\u2010\u03baB, which is activated by TNF\u03b1 in TME.44 We tested whether breast cancer cells and macrophages produce TNF\u03b1 by ELISA of CM(MCF7\u2010S), CM(MCF7\u2010R), CM(M\u03a6), CM(MS) and CM(MR). We found that MCF7\u2010S and MCF7\u2010R could secrete low concentrations of TNF\u03b1. The supernatant of breast cancer cells can promote autocrine secretion of TNF\u03b1 in macrophages. However, there was no significant difference in TNF\u03b1 level between CM(MS) and CM(MR), nor between CM(MCF7\u2010S) and CM(MCF7\u2010R) (Figure 3A). Further analysis of the activation of the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway in M\u03a6, MS, and MR showed that activation of the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway in TAM was significant, but that activation of the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway in MS and MR was not statistically significant (Figure 3B). The results do not explain the difference in CCL2 secretion between MS and MR. The mTORC1\u2010FOXK1 pathway senses amino acid changes in CM and regulates CCL2 expression independent of NF\u2010\u03baB signaling by dephosphorylating the transcription factor FOXK1.45 We tested the activation of the mTORC1\u2010FOXK1 pathway in M\u03a6, MS, and MR and found that activation of the mTORC1\u2010FOXK1 pathway was consistent with the secretion trend of CCL2 (Figure 3C). These results suggest that TNF\u03b1 and amino acid metabolism in CM activate the NF\u2010\u03baB and mTORC1\u2010FOXK1 pathways of TAM promoting the secretion of CCL2.\n\nAs a well\u2010known chemokine abundantly present in macrophages, CCL2 is responsible for the recruitment of monocytes.37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46 The concentration of CCL2 is positively correlated with its chemotaxis\u2010promoting potential. We have already determined that the levels of CCL2 secreted by M\u03a6, MS, and MR are different. The next question is whether the chemotaxis of THP\u20101 cells induced by these three macrophages coincides with the secretion of CCL2. Results of the chemotaxis assay confirmed that the chemotaxis\u2010inducing effect of TAM toward THP\u20101 cells was stronger than that of macrophages, the chemotaxis\u2010inducing effect of MR was stronger than that of MS, and Bindarit the inhibitor of CCL2 reverses the enhanced chemotaxis ability of MR (Figure 4A). To further validate this phenomenon in vitro, we analyzed tissue samples from 100 patients with ER\u2010positive breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry of serial pathological sections showed that a high expression of CCL2 in the paraneoplastic stroma was correlated with infiltration of CD163+ macrophages (r = 0.548, P < .001) (Figure 4B and Table S2). We propose that tumor cells stimulate M2 polarization of macrophages, which leads to increased secretion of CCL2, and a high concentration of CCL2 in turn promotes THP\u20101 aggregation to form more M2\u2010like macrophages.\n\nTo determine the clinical relevance of CCL2 and endocrine resistance in the in vitro findings, we selected 100 patients with invasive ER\u2010positive breast cancer who received regular endocrine therapy at the Tumor Hospital of Harbin Medical University from 2004 to 2014 (Table S3). Pathological sections were stained by CCL2 immunohistochemistry, and the paraneoplastic stromal areas were observed by microscopy. Of the 29 patients with high expression of CCL2, 15 (51.7%) developed relapse and progression, with a median PFS of 25 months. Of the 71 patients with low expression of CCL2, 23 (32.3%) developed relapse and progression, with a median PFS of 65 months. The PFS curves were based on CCL2 expression in the paraneoplastic stroma (Figure 5A,B).\n\nResults showed that PFS of the CCL2 high\u2010expression group was significantly shorter than that of the CCL2 low\u2010expression group (P < .05). The prognostic value of each clinicopathological feature was assessed using Cox hazard regression analysis. CCL2 expression was found to be an independent risk factor for disease\u2010free survival (DFS) (HR = 2.323, P = .015) (Table 1). Taken together, these results indicate a crucial role of CCL2 in promoting endocrine resistance in breast cancer.\n\nEndocrine resistance in breast cancer is a major clinical challenge in treating patients with resistant disease. At present, most studies on the mechanism of endocrine resistance are focused on breast cancer cells, and only a few studies have focused on the role of other cells in the TME. TAM are an important component of the TME that play a role in angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumor malignancy.43, 47 Our previous studies have confirmed that TAM are correlated with tamoxifen resistance in patients with breast cancer.22 In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying TAM\u2010mediated endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells.\n\nWe showed that endocrine\u2010resistant breast cancer cells can induce M2 polarization of TAM. M2\u2010polarized TAM, in turn, promote endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells. We found that breast cancer cells secrete trace amounts of TNF\u03b1 and promote autocrine secretion of TNF\u03b1 in macrophages, thereby activating the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway and promoting CCL2 release. Endocrine\u2010resistant breast cancer cells activate the mTORC1\u2010FOXK1 pathway of macrophages by altering amino acid metabolism in the environment, further promoting M2 polarization and CCL2 secretion by macrophages.\n\nWe also found that TAM promote endocrine resistance by secreting CCL2, which activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, CCL2 plays an important role in this malignant feedback loop. In addition, CCL2 promotes the aggregation of monocytes and macrophages in the TME.48 The transition from monocytes to TAM further promotes the formation of the endocrine\u2010resistant microenvironment. Analysis of tissue samples from patients with hormone receptor\u2010positive breast cancer confirmed a correlation between high expression of CCL2 in the paraneoplastic stroma and infiltration of CD163+ macrophages. Moreover, patients with high CCL2 expression in the stroma had a shorter PFS after endocrine therapy. This is consistent with the findings of our previous study that patients with high CD163+ macrophage infiltration tend to develop endocrine resistance.22 The finding that CCL2 promotes the formation of the TME and the malignant cycle of cells in the TME may partly explain why patients with endocrine resistance in the past are more likely to be resistant to new endocrine therapy.\n\nTumor\u2010associated macrophages can adjust their phenotype and function in response to local cues provided by the TME.49 Crosstalk between TAM and cancer cells is complex and involves exosomes, cytokines, and metabolites.50, 51, 52 In the present study, we focused on the cytokine CCL2 secreted by macrophages and examined its role in the endocrine resistance of breast cancer cells. We found that CCL2 activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which is a classical endocrine resistance pathway. However, the direct mechanism by which CCL2 activates this pathway was not determined. Another limitation of the present study was that due to the long culture time of drug\u2010resistant cell lines, the effects of endocrine\u2010resistant and \u2010sensitive T47D cell lines on macrophages could not be repeated.\n\nCell components in the TME are complex. In addition to TAM, fibroblasts, dendritic cells, epithelial cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes can also be tamed by tumor cells and promote a tumor malignant environment.53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 It has been reported that dendritic cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells tamed by cancer cells secrete CCL2.55, 56, 57, 58 These cells can also contribute to the positive feedback loop. However, there are only a few studies on the role of these cells in the endocrine resistance of breast cancer, and there is no report on the effect of endocrine\u2010resistant breast cancer cells on the differentiation of these cells. Future research should focus on the effect of other cell components in the TME on the endocrine resistance of breast cancer.\n\nIn conclusion, our results indicate that endocrine\u2010resistant tumor cells are more likely to promote M2 polarization of macrophages, whereas M2\u2010polarized TAM further promote endocrine resistance in tumor cells, thus forming a positive feedback loop between TAM and breast cancer cells (Figure 5C). CCL2 plays an important role in this positive feedback loop. Increased CCL2 secretion by M2\u2010polarized TAM activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in tumor cells to promote endocrine resistance and formation of the endocrine\u2010resistant microenvironment by aggregating monocytes into the TME. These findings suggest that CCL2 and TAM may be potential novel therapeutic targets for patients with endocrine\u2010resistant breast cancer.\n\nAuthors declare no conflicts of interest for this article."}
