{"title": "Development of a Polyclonal Antibody-based AC-ELISA and Its Comparison with PCR for Diagnosis of Canine Parvovirus Infection", "body": ".\n\nA total of 129 faecal samples were collected or received at Virus Laboratory, CADRAD, for diagnosis from dogs suspected of CPV-2 infection. The rectal swabs were taken from individual dogs suspected of CPV-2 infection and suspended (in the ratio 1:9) in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing streptomycin (100 mg/L) and penicillin (100 000 IU/L). It was filtered through a disposable syringe filter (0.45 \u00b5m) (Millex, Milipore, USA) and then centrifuged at 10 000 r/min at 4\u2103 for 5 min in a refrigerated centrifuge. The supernatant was carefully pipetted out and stored at -20\u2103 till further use [18] .\n\nMDCK cell line was obtained from National Centre for Cell Science, Pune. It was maintained at the Virus Laboratory, CADRAD by using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) as growth medium.\n\nGentamicin was added in the medium at the rate of 50 mg/L (Life Technologies). The MDCK cell line was sub-cultured and grown to 70% of cell culture flask, 0.5 mL of processed faecal samples were added and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2103 . After incubation, the infected cell monolayer was washed three times with DMEM and 5 mL of DMEM medium with 2% FCS was added. The infected cells were incubated at 37\u2103 for 3-5 days.\n\nPurification of CPV was carried out according to the protocol described by Teramoto et al. with some modifications [30] . Infected cells were disrupted and then centrifuged at 3 000\u00d7g for 30 min at 4\u2103 to obtain cell pellet. The pellet was resuspended in PBS, sonicated at 30 \u00b5 amplitude for 1 min to disrupt the cells, centrifuged at 8 000\u00d7g for 10 min and supernatant was collected. The supernatant was treated with 8% PEG-6000 and kept on the magnetic stirrer overnight for precipitation of the virus. The PEG-treated supernatant was pelleted by centrifugation at 6 000\u00d7g for 30 min and the pellet was re-suspended in PBS for ultracentrifugation. Two mL of the resuspended virus was then carefully layered over discontinuous gradient of 60% and 40% sucrose in 12 mL centrifuge tube (4.5 mL 60% sucrose + 4.5 mL 40% sucrose) and centrifuged at 100 000 \u00d7g for 2 h at 4\u2103 in an ultracentrifuge (Sorvall, Ultracentrifuge, swinging rotor AH629, USA). At the interface of sucrose gradients thick opaque band was observed.\n\nThe band containing the virus was collected, diluted with equal amount of PBS and again centrifuged at 100 000\u00d7g for 2 h at 4\u2103 in an ultracentrifuge (Sorvall, Ultracentrifuge, USA) using fixed rotor.\n\nHyperimmune serum was raised in rabbits and guinea pigs by inoculating purified virus for three times over a period for 28 days. One hundred \u00b5g of \n\nThe primer set pCPV-2ab (F) 5'-GAAGAGTGGT for 10 min [18] . At the end of PCR, the amplified products were analyzed on 1.0% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide to a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL. 10 \u03bcL of amplified product was mixed with 2 \u03bcL of bromophenol dye (6\u00d7) and loaded into the well and run along with 100 bp DNA ladder in 1\u00d7TAE electrophoresis buffer at 5 V/cm 2 and the progress of mobility was monitored by migration of dye. \n\nThree faecal samples found positive in PCR were subjected to blind passages in MDCK cells. In the first 3 passages, no cytopathic effects (CPE) were seen.\n\nHowever, from 4th passage onwards, MDCK cells exhibited CPE characterized by rounding of cells, granulation and aggregation of cells after 72 hpi which increased subsequently and widely distributed in whole monolayer (Fig. 1) . The results are in accordance with the Joshi et al [11] . Then the virus was harvested and freeze-thawed thrice and stored at -20\u2103 until further use. The virus titre was determined by Reed and Muench method [25] . The titre of virus was calculated from three different readings and the mean was found to be 10 4.8 TCID 50 /mL. Using this as inoculums, 2 000 mL of CPV-2 infected cell culture fluid was produced for purification of virus.\n\nIn the sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, the pellet obtained was resuspended in 2 mL of PBS.\n\nThe protein content of the purified virus was estimated by U.V. method in nanodrops spectrophotometer (Thermo-scientific, USA) and found to be 350 \u00b5g/mL. After test bleeding, the presence of antibody was evaluated by AGPT and a distinct band was visualized between the raised hyperimmune serum in both species and purified virus (Fig. 2) . Final bleeding was done after 10 days of the final immunization, serum collected, inactivated and kept at -20\u2103 for further use. coronavirus, canine adenovirus etc. and found to be nonreactive. The CPV-2 variants used in the study were typed previously on the basis of PCR and sequence analysis and maintained in the Virus Laboratory, CADRAD [19] . The analytical sensitivity of the AC-ELISA was determined using serial 10-fold dilutions of CPV-2 infected cell culture supernatant of known titer (10 4.8 TCID 50 /mL) and the detection limit of the AC-ELISA assay was up to 10 -2 dilution, equivalent to 10 2.8 TCID 50 /mL. The analytical sensitivity of the AC-ELISA was compared with the pCPV-2ab primer set based PCR [22] and detection limit of the PCR was up to 10 -4 dilution, equivalent to 10 0.8 TCID 50 /mL (Fig. 3) . So, PCR was found to be about 100 times more sensitive than the AC-ELISA for detection of CPV in cell culture system (Table 1) .\n\nAt the end of the electrophoresis, the gel was visualized under the UV transilluminator and an amplicon of 681 bp of VP2 genes was seen from positive faecal samples and positive control, but not in fecal sample from healthy dog (Fig. 4) . Table 2 ). The relative sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the AC-ELISA were found to be 88.4%, 100% and 91.4% respectively ( Table 2) . "}
