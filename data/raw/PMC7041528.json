{"title": "Spontaneous lung pathology in a captive common marmoset colony (Callithrix jacchus)", "body": "Recently, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has increasingly\nattracted attention as a translational animal model in the field of\nrespiratory research because of its small size, good availability, and\nconsistent characteristics of primate lung architecture (Greenough et al.,\n2005; Lever et al., 2008; Seehase et al., 2012; Curths et al., 2013, 2014).\nAs a non-rodent species, the common marmoset is used in\npreclinical testing of drugs acting on the respiratory system and is a\nsuitable animal model for various human pulmonary diseases, including asthma\nand chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; Seehase et al., 2012; Curths et al., 2013, 2014).\nHistopathological examination of lung tissue from toxicological and\nexperimental studies requires detailed knowledge of the spectrum of\nspontaneously occurring lung pathology of this laboratory animal species to\nidentify possible drug-induced or disease-associated pulmonary lesions and\nto distinguish these from species-specific background lesions. Compared to\nother laboratory animals, spontaneous pathology of common marmosets is less\nwell defined. Background lesions of the common marmoset in toxicological\nstudies have previously been documented by Kaspareit et al. (2006), who also\nreferred to pulmonary findings. David et al. (2009) also performed a\nretrospective study on the spontaneous pathology of common marmosets\nincluding the morphological diagnoses of pneumonia, atelectasis, pulmonary\nextramedullary hematopoiesis, and lymphosarcoma in the lungs. However, a\ndetailed survey about the range and incidence of lung pathology in common\nmarmosets does not exist in the literature so far.\n\nIn order to provide reference data on spontaneous histopathological\npulmonary findings in conventionally kept common marmosets, we performed a\nretrospective study on necropsy material of 638 common marmosets from the\nindoor-housed marmoset colony of the German Primate Center in G\u00f6ttingen.\n\nIn this retrospective study, archived lung tissue of 638 common marmosets\n(317 males and 321 females) originating from the marmoset colony of the\nGerman Primate Center in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, was used. Archived material\nincluded formalin-fixed or paraffin-embedded lung tissue, or histological\nsections of the lung, which were collected between 1997 and 2011. Animals of\nthis study were housed in small family groups in an indoor facility with a\nroom temperature of 25 \u2218C and relative humidity of 50\u201360 % on a\n12 h light\u2013dark cycle with 30 min \u201cdawn\u201d and \u201cdusk\u201d periods. Care\nand housing conditions of the animals complied with the regulations of the\nEuropean Parliament and the Council Directive on the protection of animals\nused for scientific purposes (2010/63/EU), the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2010), and the applicable\nGerman Animal Protection Law. According to necropsy records, animals\nunderwent necropsy after spontaneous death, following euthanasia due to\nillness with poor prognosis, or after scheduled terminal kill in the context\nof experimental studies. From the latter group of marmosets only control\nanimals or animals without treatment-related findings were considered for\nre-evaluation of lung histology. Photographic documentation of respective\nmacroscopic pulmonary findings and results from bacteriological culture of\nthe lungs were available for some animals. Lung tissue samples were fixed in\n4 or 10 % phosphate-buffered formaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at\n3 \u00b5m, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). If required for\ndiagnostic purposes, additional stains were prepared and analyzed, including\nperiodic acid Schiff (PAS) reaction, Prussian blue stain, von Kossa stain,\nMasson's trichrome stain, Congo red stain, Grocott's methenamine silver stain,\nand Giemsa stain. The lungs of all 638 marmosets were re-examined\nhistologically, and findings were reported on a spreadsheet (Microsoft\nOffice Excel 2010) with searchable columns for morphological\ndiagnosis/histological finding, sex, age, cause of death (if known),\nchronicity of lesion (in case of inflammation), and severity grade. Animals\nwere assigned to three age groups: newborn (0 to 7 days old, including\nsupposedly timely delivered but stillborn marmosets), juvenile (7 days to 30\nmonths old), and adult (older than 30 months). Histological findings were\ngrouped into inflammatory conditions, neoplasia, changes in air content,\ncirculatory disturbances, pigment deposition, and miscellaneous findings.\nTotal incidences of findings were indicated in absolute numbers and\npercentage. In addition, absolute numbers of findings were calculated for\nmales and females as well as different age groups.\n\nIn the present study, 39 of 638 common marmosets (6.11 %) did not show\nany histological changes of the lungs. All spontaneous pulmonary lesions of\nthe other animals are documented in Table 1.\n\nThe most commonly observed inflammatory lung condition was constituted by\ninterstitial pneumonia, which was observed in 206 marmosets (32.29 %).\nThe majority of cases with interstitial pneumonia revealed a subacute course\nof disease with predominance of plasma cells in the inflammatory cell\ninfiltrate. Regarding severity and distributional pattern, mild multifocal\nor multifocal to coalescing forms predominated (Fig. 1), while severe and\ndiffuse cases were very rare. In two marmosets (0.31 %), interstitial\npneumonia was associated with acute to subacute alveolitis. There was no\nhistological evidence of infectious agents in all cases of interstitial\npneumonia, except for one male juvenile marmoset, which showed\ncharacteristic disseminated Grocott-positive blastospores and pseudohyphae\nin inflamed lung regions, indicating a mycotic etiology consistent with\ncandidiasis. Bacterial culture, if available, was positive in the minority\nof marmosets affected by interstitial pneumonia. Bacterial isolates included\nEscherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other forms of pneumonia were rare and included lobar pneumonia\nin nine marmosets (1.41 %), suppurative bronchopneumonia in six marmosets\n(0.94 %), and bronchointerstitial pneumonia in two marmosets (0.31 %).\nLobar pneumonias were further subdivided into purulent or fibrinopurulent\nforms according to the inflammatory exudate (Fig. 2). In two cases (0.31 %),\nthere was fibrinopurulent pleuropneumonia. The majority of lobar\npneumonias (eight of nine cases) and all suppurative bronchopneumonias were\nmoderate to severe and acute to subacute, representing the main cause of\ndisease or death in most cases. Bacterial culture of marmoset lungs affected\nby purulent bronchopneumonia yielded isolates of Streptococcus sp.\nand/or Bordetella bronchiseptica in all cases. Bordetella bronchiseptica was also isolated from the lungs of a juvenile female\nmarmoset with fibrinopurulent pleuropneumonia. In three cases of lobar\npneumonia, Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., and/or\nKlebsiella pneumoniae ssp. ozaenae could be isolated,\nwhile five cases of lobar pneumonia were negative for bacterial culture.\n\nNeoplastic conditions occurred in five marmoset lungs, including lymphoma in\nfour adult animals (0.63 %) and fibrosarcoma in one juvenile animal (0.16 %).\nRegarding the age of animals with tumors, lymphomas affected three rather young\nadults (3.5 years (two cases) and 2.75 years old)\nand one older animal (7 years old). The fibrosarcoma occurred in a 1-year-old\nmarmoset. In all cases, pulmonary tumors were regarded as secondary,\nresulting from metastatic neoplastic disease with presumptive primary tumors\nin the nodal or extranodal lymphatic system (lymphomas) and in the mammary\ngland (fibrosarcoma). Immunohistochemical examinations confirmed B cell\norigin of at least three lymphomas (Fig. 3). One lymphoma has not been further\ncharacterized.\n\nChanges in air content were commonly observed, either in otherwise healthy\nlungs or as an additional finding to other histological diagnoses. There was\nevidence of atelectasis in 215 marmosets (33.7 %), of which the majority\nrepresented subtotal secondary (acquired) atelectasis (178 of 215 cases).\nPrimary (fetal) atelectasis occurred in 37 newborn marmosets (5.8 %), of\nwhich 36 animals showed total fetal atelectasis that was regularly\nassociated with lung immaturity. One juvenile marmoset revealed partial\nfetal atelectasis, also accompanied by discrete signs of lung immaturity.\nAlveolar emphysema of variable severity and extent was present in 154\nanimals (24.14 %), whereas interstitial emphysema could not be observed\nin this study.\n\nCirculatory disturbances in marmoset lungs included congestion, edema,\nhemorrhage, and hyaline membrane formation. Acute pulmonary congestion was a\ncommon finding (41.54 %), often regarded as agonal or euthanasia-induced\ndue to the use of barbiturates. The same might be true for\npulmonary edema, which was present in 131 marmosets (20.35 %) and\noccurred both as an additional finding and solitarily. The majority of\npulmonary edema was represented by alveolar forms (120 of 131 cases), while\ninvolvement of the interstitium was only seen in 11 cases. Extravasation of\nerythrocytes (hemorrhage) into the interstitium or alveolar space could be\nseen in 39 marmosets (6.11 %) and, to some extent, was presumably also\ncaused by euthanasia or agony. Hyaline membranes were observed in the lungs\nof three newborn marmosets (0.47 %) with concurrent atelectasis and evidence\nof lung immaturity.\n\nMild to moderate deposition of coal dust in the pulmonary interstitium\n(anthracosis) was present in 52 mostly adult marmosets (8.15 %). In\ngeneral, anthracosis was not associated with any tissue reaction (Fig. 4).\nHemosiderin-laden macrophages (hemosiderosis) were observed in the lungs of\ntwo juvenile and nine adult marmosets (1.72 %), which commonly showed\nco-existing hemosiderosis in other organs, especially in liver, spleen, and\nkidneys. There was no evidence of chronic heart failure in cases of\npulmonary hemosiderosis.\n\nWithin the group of miscellaneous lung findings, extramedullary\nhematopoiesis, mainly characterized by megakaryocytes within alveolar septa,\nwas observed in 74 animals (11.6 %). This predominantly affected adult\nmarmosets, which regularly showed concurrent foci of extramedullary\nhematopoiesis in multiple organs (liver, spleen, etc.). The\nsecond-most-common miscellaneous finding was multifocal interstitial or subpleural\nmineralization, being present in 70 juvenile and adult marmosets (10.97 %),\nfollowed by disseminated inflammatory cell foci observed in 66\nmarmosets (10.34 %). They mainly consisted of plasma cells, macrophages,\nand lymphocytes and were primarily located within alveolar septa,\nperivascular or peribronchial/peribronchiolar (Fig. 5). Cuboidal alveolar\nepithelium and thick fibrotic interalveolar tissue of variable extent,\nindicative of pulmonary immaturity, were present in 62 newborn/stillborn\nmarmosets and in 1 juvenile animal (9.72 %). In many cases, premature\nlungs also showed total atelectasis and represented a common cause of death\nin newborn marmosets. A few animals with immature lungs also revealed\naccumulations of intra-alveolar amniotic fluid (Fig. 6). Focal or multifocal\nalveolar histiocytosis, found in 26 marmosets (4.08 %), was generally\nassociated with inflammatory lung lesions. Multifocal interstitial and\nsubpleural fibrosis was detected in juvenile and adult marmosets (3.61 %),\noccasionally accompanied by focal mineralization (Fig. 7). Three\nadult marmosets (0.47 %) revealed pulmonary arteriopathy, characterized\nby hyperplasia and mineralization of the tunica media as well as edema and\nhypertrophy of the tunica intima. A focal foreign-body granuloma due to an\naspirated hair fragment (Fig. 8) was observed in the lung of one adult female\nmarmoset (0.16 %).\n\nWith an incidence of 32.99 %, the most common inflammatory condition in\nthe lungs was interstitial pneumonia. However, the majority of cases were\nmild and were not associated with severe clinical disease or death. Except\nfor a few case reports, published data on the incidence of interstitial\npneumonias in common marmoset colonies are lacking. David et al. (2009)\nobserved pneumonias in 9 of 597 marmosets but did not provide further\nclassification of this diagnosis. The etiopathogenesis of interstitial\npneumonia generally includes aerogenous damage to the alveolar epithelium\n(e.g., by toxic gases or due to infection with pneumotropic viruses) or\nhematogenous injury to the alveolar capillary endothelium or basement\nmembrane (e.g., in septicemia, by endotoxins from the alimentary tract, from\nfree radicals released in acute respiratory distress syndrome, from\nmicroembolism or disseminated intravascular coagulation, in the context of\nhypersensitivity reactions, or due to infection with endotheliotropic\nviruses) (L\u00f3pez, 2007). In the common marmosets affected by interstitial\npneumonia, testing for respiratory viruses was not performed routinely.\nTherefore, a viral etiology accounting for at least a part of interstitial\npneumonias cannot finally be excluded. Evidence of bacterial agents was\npresent in only a few cases, including Streptococcus sp.,\nEscherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,\nPseudomonas aeruginosa, and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae.\nThese isolates are of variable pathogenicity regarding respiratory\ninfections but are usually not associated with interstitial pneumonia\n(Simmons and Gibson, 2012). In some marmosets, bacterial isolates were also\nobtained from other organs (gall bladder, intestine) with evidence of\nbacteria-induced pathologic lesions suggesting septicemic distribution of\nthe respective bacteria. Mycotic interstitial pneumonia was observed in one\nmarmoset with systemic candidiasis, which represents the most frequently\noccurring mycotic disease in immunocompromised non-human primates (Simmons\nand Gibson, 2012). However, the etiology of the majority of interstitial\npneumonias remains unclear. Environmental influences linked to the housing\nconditions of the marmoset colony \u2013 e.g., room temperature, humidity, air\nexchange rate and air filter specifications, and aerosol formation \u2013 may\nrepresent predisposing or triggering factors for the development of\ninterstitial lung inflammation in captive marmosets, although evidence for\nthis assumption is lacking. In addition, fine dust pollution has to be\nconsidered as an initiating factor for interstitial lung disease, especially\nwith regard to the atmospheric composition in the natural habitat of common\nmarmosets, which surely differs from the artificial conditions in indoor\nmarmoset husbandry. The presence of anthracosis in 52 marmosets (8.15 %)\npoints to at least partial exposure of indoor-kept marmosets to the\noutside air. However, the association between anthracosis and interstitial\npneumonia remains questionable as many animals with intrapulmonary coal dust\npigment did not exhibit obvious interstitial inflammation or fibrosis, which\nis consistent with observations in cynomolgus monkeys (Sato et al., 2012).\nFinally, influences like stress or immunological status of the animal, both\nconditions that are hard to grasp, may have an impact on the individual's\ndisposition to develop interstitial lung inflammation (L\u00f3pez, 2007).\n\nLobar pneumonias and bronchopneumonias occurred in a small number of\nmarmosets (1.41 and 0.94 %, respectively), were grossly evident in most cases, and\nwere generally caused by bacterial infection resulting in severe disease and\ndeath. Bordetella bronchiseptica was isolated from the lungs in all\ncases of bronchopneumonia and 1 case of lobar pneumonia. Outbreaks of\nbordetellosis with characteristic pneumonic lesions have previously been\ndescribed in marmoset colonies and were associated with high morbidity and\nmortality (Baskerville et al., 1983; Chalmers et al., 1983). Pathogenic\nKlebsiella pneumoniae strains are known to cause\npurulent/fibrinopurulent pneumonias in New World monkeys (Berendt et al.,\n1978; Simmons and Gibson, 2012) and could be isolated in most cases of lobar\npneumonia in the common marmosets.\n\nPrimary pulmonary neoplasia is rare in non-human primates and is limited to\na few case reports primarily referring to malignant epithelial tumors observed\nin different macaque species (Lowenstine and Osborn, 2012). In a previous\nstudy on the incidence of pulmonary tumors in the marmoset colony of the\nGerman Primate Center, Brack et al. (1996) reported three cases of primary lung\ntumors (one small-cell carcinoma, one bronchial adenoma, one squamous cell\ncarcinoma) in 409 adult callitrichids that were examined between 1978 and\n1994. However, in the present study, for which data were obtained from the\ntime period between 1997 and 2011, pulmonary neoplasms in the marmoset\ncolony (0.79 %) exclusively represented secondary tumors in the context\nof metastatic disease with primary tumors located in other organ systems\n(lymphatic system, mammary gland). Primary lung malignancies or benign lung\ntumors were not observed in the present study.\n\nAcquired atelectasis with patchy distribution was commonly diagnosed in the\nexamined marmoset lungs (27.9 %). However, in most cases, obvious\ncausative factors, e.g. compression or obstruction, could not be observed.\nTherefore, a large portion of atelectasis probably resulted from artificial\nlung collapse during necropsy followed by immersion fixation with\nformaldehyde. Congenital atelectasis mainly affected stillborn marmosets or\nnewborn animals that died within a couple of days after birth (5.8 %).\nThe main causes of congenital atelectasis include obstruction of airways due to\naspiration of amniotic fluid and alterations in the quantity and quality of\npulmonary surfactant (L\u00f3pez, 2007). In the common marmosets, atelectatic\nlungs regularly showed concurrent lung immaturity, suggesting surfactant\ndeficiency. In a few cases, lung immaturity was associated with hyaline\nmembrane formation, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome as the\nlikely cause of death. Amniotic fluid aspiration was evident in a couple of\nnewborn marmosets and might have caused atelectasis due to airway\nobstruction.\n\nAlveolar emphysema is a common secondary finding in lungs affected by\nbronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia and can be attributed to a valve effect\nelicited by exudate plugs in the intrapulmonary airways (L\u00f3pez, 2007).\nHowever, as the incidence of alveolar emphysema clearly exceeds the number\nof alveolar pneumonias in the marmoset study cohort, alveolar emphysema in\nmost marmosets likely represents an agonal change or a euthanasia artifact.\nThe same probably applies to most marmoset lungs exhibiting circulatory\ndisturbances, including acute congestion, edema, and hemorrhage, which are\nfrequently seen in animals euthanized with barbiturates (L\u00f3pez, 2007).\n\nHemosiderosis is a common finding in many New World monkey species, including\ncommon marmosets; mainly manifests in the liver; and is believed to be\ncaused by high-iron diets (Miller et al., 1997; Rensing and Oerke, 2005). As there\nwere no signs of chronic heart failure in cases of pulmonary hemosiderosis\nbut there was evidence of concurrent hemosiderosis in other organs, the majority of\npulmonary hemosiderin deposition in the common marmosets of this study is\nregarded as the result of systemic iron overload due to excessive intestinal\niron uptake. However, the presence of siderophages may also, to some extent,\nrepresent residua of localized pulmonary hemorrhages of undefined origin\n(Sato et al., 2012).\n\nThe occurrence of extramedullary hematopoiesis in the lungs of adult common\nmarmosets has previously been described by Kaspareit et al. (2006) and is\nbelieved to be an incidental finding without clinical relevance (Z\u00fchlke\nand Weinbauer, 2003; Chamanza et al., 2006). Subpleural mineralization\nmacroscopically presented as subpleural plaques, which are distinctly\nvisible at necropsy. Both interstitial and subpleural mineralization was\nfound in 70 marmosets (10.97 %) and was largely regarded to be of\nmetastatic origin as there was co-existing mineralization of other tissues\nwith accentuation on basal lamina structures. Taking into consideration that\nthe diet for young marmosets in the German Primate Center is supplemented\nwith vitamin D to prevent rachitic lesions, soft tissue mineralization in\nthe common marmosets was likely due to hypervitaminosis D, which is a\nwell-known nutritional disease entity in New World monkeys (Hunt, 1969;\nKaspareit et al., 2006; McInnes, 2012; Saravanan et al., 2015).\nCircumscribed areas of interstitial and subpleural fibrosis occurred in 23\njuvenile and adult marmosets (3.61 %) and presumably represent residua\nfrom earlier tissue damage. Mononuclear inflammatory cell foci, which were\npresent in 66 marmoset lungs (10.34 %), are a regularly observed\nbackground finding in common marmosets and may affect different organ\nsystems (Chamanza et al., 2006; Kaspareit et al., 2006). In the lungs, it is\nimportant to distinguish between such inflammatory cell foci and\ninterstitial pneumonia, which should be feasible regarding the extent,\ndistribution, and severity of infiltrating inflammatory cells. The\nhistological features of pulmonary arteriopathy observed in 3 adult\nmarmosets (0.47 %) were indicative of pulmonary hypertension, and\nconcurrent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was present in at least one of the\naffected animals. However, the exact pathogenetic mechanisms leading to\npulmonary arteriopathy remained obscure in the common marmosets. Occasional\noccurrence of foreign-body granulomas in marmoset lungs has previously been\nreported by Kaspareit et al. (2006). They are usually caused by aspiration\nof foreign material (hair, food particles, plant fragments) (Sato et al.,\n2012). When small and focal as in the present case, they can be regarded as\nincidental microscopic findings without clinical relevance. However,\naspiration of larger or sharp-edged foreign bodies may result in substantial\ntissue reaction and respiratory distress. Tissue migration may lead to\ncomplications like abscess formation, pneumo- or pyothorax, or signs of\npenetration of other organs (L\u00f3pez, 2007).\n\nThis study documents the range and incidence of spontaneous histological\nfindings in the lungs likely to be encountered in purpose-bred common\nmarmosets used in toxicological or experimental studies. When interpreting\nthese findings in marmoset studies, special care should be taken to identify\npreexisting pulmonary disease and to distinguish species-specific background\nfindings from trial-related changes.\n\nAll relevant data are presented in the paper.
