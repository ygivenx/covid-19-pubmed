{"title": "Inhibition of SARS-CoV replication by siRNA", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has recently created a serious health crisis and economic disruption in Canada and Southeast Asia (Lee et al., 2003) . A previously unidentified coronavirus (SARS-CoV) isolated from SARS patients has been implicated in the etiology of the disease (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . No effective therapy is available and scientists worldwide are exploring various possible ways to fight SARS (Kontoyiannis et al., 2003; Anand et al., 2003) .\n\nRNA dependent gene silencing, a research hotspot in recent years, involves RNA interference (RNAi) in animals/mammalian cells and post-transcriptional gene silencing in plants. Transfection of 21-nt small interfering RNA (siRNA) into mammalian cells results in degradation of the target gene mRNA and silencing of its expression (Elbashir et al., 2001a) . siRNA-induced RNAi may provide a new ap- * Corresponding author.

RNAi has been used to modulate the replication cycle of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus in cultured human cells (Jacque et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2003) . SARS-CoV is a positive-stranded RNA virus, suggesting that siRNA treatment might be feasible for SARS-CoV. Coronavirus-infected cells contain a characteristic 3 coterminal nested set of mR-NAs, each of which has a capped leader sequence of approximate 70 nts derived from the 5 end of the genome. At the 3 end of the RNA genome is another UTR, followed by poly (A) of variable length. The sequences of both the 3 -and 5 -UTR are important for RNA replication and transcription. The synthesis of subgenomic negative sense RNA species by discontinuous RNA transcription is regulated by a core transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) found on the genome near the beginning of each ORF and at the 3 end of the leader (Lai and Holmes, 2001) . The consensus sequence, 5 -CUAAAC-3 , is found before each of the S and M genes and ORF 10 of SARS-CoV . The S glycoprotein is a large multifunctional protein which forms large petal-shaped spikes on the surface of the virions and plays a central role in the biology and pathogenesis of coronavirus (Lai and Holmes, 2001) . The availability of the complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV Marra et al., 2003) makes the design of siRNA aimed at SARS-CoV possible. We focused on four regions of the SARS-CoV genome, the leader sequence, TRS, 3 -UTR, and the coding sequence for the spike protein, to design specific siRNAs to test whether RNAi could selectively target SARS-CoV viral RNAs and inhibit viral protein expression and replication. Based on recent research (Elbashir et al., 2001a (Elbashir et al., , 2001b and the successful experience of the Ambion Corporation's researchers (Jacque et al., 2002) ; we designed seven siR-NAs that were 21 nts in length and had a G/C content of 30-50%: these were siSARS-L (sense, AGCCAACCAAC-CTCGATCTdTdT), directed against the leader sequence region of each 5 subgenomic mRNA; siSARS-TRS (sense, ATCTGTTCTCTAAACGAACdTdT), directed against the TRS region; siSARS-3 UTR1 (sense, TTTCGCAATTC-CGTTTACGdTdT) and siSARS-3 UTR2 (sense, CGTAAC-TAAACAGCACAAGdTdT), directed against the 3 -UTR region; and siSARS-S1 (sense, TGTTGTTATACGAGCAT-GTdTdT), siSARS-S2 (sense, GGGCTATCAACCTATA-GATdTdT), and siSARS-S3 (sense, CAAGGCGATTAGT-CAAATTdTdT), directed against the spike protein region. The negative control siRNA, siJEV-M, (sense, CAACACG-GACATTGCAGACdTdT) targets the gene for the membrane of extracted viral RNA was applied for RT-PCR by using Qiagen \u00ae One\n\nStep RT-PCR kit with SARS-specific primers Cor-p-F2 5 -CTAACATGCTTAGGATAATGG-3 and Corp-R1 5 CAGGTAAGCGTAAAACTCATC3 . This primer set was designed to amplify a region in open reading frame 1b in the genome of SARS-CoV (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . The RT-PCR conditions were: 50 \u2022 C, 30 min; 95 \u2022 C, 15 min; 25 cycles of (94 \u2022 C 30 s, 50 \u2022 C 30 s, 72 \u2022 C 1 min); 72 \u2022 C, 10 min. As shown in Fig. 1 , there was a consistent 90 and 85% reduction in viral genomic RNA copies in the supernatants of cells transfected with siSARS-S2 and siSARS-S3, respectively, but the reduction was less marked in siSARS3 UTR2transfected cells (56%), and much lower in the other cells. This showed that viral RNA synthesis could be inhibited by certain specific siRNAs. As shown in Fig. 2 , when the transfected cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis using a 1:500 dilution of a serum from a convalescent SARS patient (a gift from the Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan), many prominent bands were seen; these were SARS-CoV viral antigens, as they were not present in noninfected cells. Virally-infected cells treated with siSARS-S2, siSARS-S3, or siSARS3 UTR2 showed, respectively, 64, 51, or 40% inhibition of viral antigen synthesis (Fig. 2) . Immunohistochemistry was also used to examine the inhibitory effect of siRNA on viral antigen synthesis. The transfected cells were fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min, washed with PBS, air dried, and treated with acetone/methanol (1:1), then incubated with a 1:500 dilution of the same patient s serum, washed, and probed with HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG antibody, and the signal developed in DAB substrate solution (Pierce). Control SARS-CoV-infected cells were dark brown color, whereas siSARS-S2-or siSARS-S3-treated cells were paler, and siSARS-3 UTR2-treated cells were very pale brown (Fig. 3) , indicating that siSARS-S2 and siSARS-S3 effectively blocked viral antigen synthesis. Taken together, our results showed that siSARS-S2 and siSARS-S3 treatment profoundly reduced the amount of RNA transcripts and viral antigens, while siSARS-3 UTR2 was less effective.\n\nThese data show that, in our test system, 100 pmol of siSARS-S2, siSARS-S3, or siSARS-3 UTR2 siRNA could inhibit SARS-CoV replication. However, further studies are required to optimize the amount of siRNAs and to evaluate the feasibility of using siRNAs in SARS-CoV-infected animals before use in humans."}
