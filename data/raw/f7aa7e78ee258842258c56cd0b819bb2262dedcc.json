{"title": "Clostridium perfringens type E enteritis in calves: two cases and a brief review of the literature", "body": "Clostridium perfringens is an important cause of enteric disease in domestic animals [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Its virulence is based largely upon toxinogenesis [6, 7] , and production of four so-called major toxins is the basis for division of the species into types [6, [8] [9] [10] [11] (Table 1) .\n\nType E is a putatively uncommon cause of enterotoxemia of lambs, calves, and rabbits [12] (Table 1) . Iota enterotoxemia in calves and lambs was reported 50 years ago in Britain, and accounts published since that time have been of hemorrhagic, necrotic enteritis of calves [13] and of detection of type E organisms and iota toxin in ovine or bovine intestines at post mortem [14] . Suspected type E-induced disease in rabbits must be differentiated from that caused by C. spiroforme [3, 15] . Strains of type E are distinguished from other toxinotypes by their production of iota toxin, which consists of two non-covalently associated components and ADPribosylates actin at Arg-177 [16] [17] [18] . Little is known of the pathogenesis of type E infections, although it is assumed that, in keeping with the pattern set by isolates of other toxin types, iota toxin plays an important role.\n\nCase one: Fixed and fresh tissues from a 2-week-old male Angus calf were submitted by a veterinarian in Wisconsin. The history included diarrhea and sudden death, and necropsy findings of hyperemia and edema involving the abomasum and small intestine. Microscopic examination of abomasum revealed mild multifocal mucosal hemorrhage and acute inflammation of the submucosal layer (Fig. 1) microscopic examination of intestinal contents. Direct fecal smears were negative for cryptosporidia. Anaerobic cultures of abomasum confirmed a heavy growth of C. perfringens, which was determined by PCR analysis to be genotype E; PCR results also revealed the presence of the genes for enterotoxin (cpe) and beta2 toxin (cpb2) [10, 11, 19] (Fig. 2) . No significant organisms were found in small intestine, colon, or lymph node. Case two: Fixed and fresh tissues from an 11-day-old crossbred female calf were submitted by a veterinarian in Nebraska. The calf was one of 70 in the herd, of which about 10% were affected and three had died. In the subject animal, death followed 3 days of scouring, and the veterinarian suspected a coronaviral infection.\n\nNecropsy revealed jejunal hemorrhage, which was especially notable from the serosal surface. Streaks of inflammation were seen on the mucosal surface of the spiral colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes were edematous and inflamed.\n\nMicroscopic examination of tissues revealed mild autolytic change in segments of jejunum, ileum, and colon. Some areas of ileum appeared necrotic, with inflammation of some villous tips, and lymphadenitis was evident.\n\nFluorescent antibody examinations of intestine were negative for rotavirus and coronavirus, as was electron microscopic examination. Direct fecal smears were negative for cryptosporidia. No significant bacteria were found in lymph nodes or colon, but heavy growth of C. perfringens was obtained upon anaerobic culture of intestine. The isolate was determined by PCR analysis to be genotype E; PCR results were also positive for cpe and cpb2 [10, 11, 19] (Fig. 2) . In both cases, findings were consistent with C. perfringens type E enteritis.\n\nAs noted, infection by C. perfringens type E has been a rare diagnosis since its first description more than 50 years ago. Diagnoses in rabbits may, in fact, have been infections by C. spiroforme, an organism which is very different from C. perfringens but which produces a toxin quite similar to iota toxin [3] . An important point illustrated by the cases presented here is that, without bacteriologic culture and genotyping, these infections, if attributed to C. perfringens, would likely have been assumed to be caused by organisms of type A or C.\n\nIn fact, strains of type E are not uncommon in certain niches. Examination of 1113 strains of C. perfringens from cases of enteritis in domestic animals revealed 45 type E strains (4%), all from different herds. The origin of these isolates was uniformly from neonatal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (and most experiencing sudden death), which is consistent with the findings of others [15, 19] . Samples submitted to us for diagnostic screening are not necessarily random or representative; nevertheless, the fact that all 45 type E isolates identified in this study originated from a single host type and condition is notable, since these type E isolates represented 46.9% of all isolates submitted from similar clinical cases in calves. More rigorous epidemiologic and diagnostic pursuit of similar cases is perhaps warranted.\n\nIt is also important to note that currently available commercial toxoids will likely offer little or no protection against type E infections. Thus, disease could occur even in the face of faithful use of an immunoprophylactic product directed against other genotypes. It is tempting to speculate on a role for type E strains in socalled vaccine breaks.\n\nThe finding of cpe in isolates from these cases is consistent with previous work by ourselves and others [19] [20] [21] [22] , in which the gene could be amplified from strains of type E, but enterotoxin (CPE) was not expressed. Silent cpe sequences, found near the iota toxin genes on episomal DNA, were highly conserved among type E isolates, but contained nine nonsense and two frameshift mutations and lacked the initiation codon, promoters, and ribosome binding site. This is remarkable, given that sequencing of cpe from eight different isolates revealed 100% sequence homology [19, [23] [24] [25] . These strains were apparently not clonal; location of cpe sequences, with iap and ibp, on episomal DNA and lack of isolate-specific mutations suggests recent wide distribution among C. perfringens isolates.\n\nDetection of cpb2 sequences by PCR analysis is of uncertain importance. CPB2 has been associated with enteric disease in pigs [26] , horses [27] , and feedlot cattle [28] . We have found cpb2 in 12.9% of bovine isolates across-the-board, and in 30.1% of isolates from cattle with enteritis (unpublished data). However, there is no direct experimental evidence for a role in pathogenesis, in cattle or any other species. Furthermore, we have found that cpb2 is expressed by only B50% of all bovine isolates; cpb2 is silent in all type E isolates we have examined.\n\nIn sum, consideration should be given to type E-associated enteritis when planning for the health care of calves. Greater attention to bacteriologic culture and genotyping as part of diagnostic approaches will provide more information on the true importance of this problem. Development of immunoprophylactic products is desirable, but may not be considered financially viable."}
