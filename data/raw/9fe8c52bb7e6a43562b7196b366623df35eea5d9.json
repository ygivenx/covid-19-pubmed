{"title": "Design, synthesis, and evaluation of 3C protease inhibitors as anti-enterovirus 71 agents", "body": "Enterovirus (EV), a member of Picornaviridae family, is a primary causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth diseases in humans and animals. 1 In severe cases, EV can damage the central nervous systems leading to viral meningitis, encephalitis, and severe myocarditis, as well as fatal pulmonary edema. [2] [3] [4] Children are particularly vulnerable due to their relative immunodeficiency. 5, 6 There are over 5 billion cases of EV infections annually worldwide and several outbreaks have been reported. [7] [8] [9] In 1998, a severe outbreak by the EV71 (TW/2231/98) occurred in Taiwan causing about 120,000 cases of infection in children and 78 deaths. 10, 11 Since then, a steady number of cases caused by this particular EV strain have been reported annually. In May 2008, Chinese health authorities reported a major outbreak of EV71 in Anhui province of China, which has led to 28 deaths as of May 7. To date, no effective anti-viral therapy for the diseases caused by EV is available. Like other picornaviruses such as polioviruses, rhinoviruses (RV), coxsackieviruses, and hepatitis A viruses, a virally encoded chymotrypsin-like protease (3C protease) is required for the proteolytic processing of the large polyproteins translated from the viral RNA genomes and thus essential for viral replication. 12, 13 The RV 3C protease was used as a target to develop inhibitor AG7088, aiming to treat the common cold. [14] [15] [16] This peptidomimetic inhibitor (see below for structure) contains a lactam ring to mimic Gln at the P1 position, fluoro-phenylalanine at P2, Val at P3 followed by 5-methyl-3-isoxazole, and an a,b-unsaturated ester at P1 0 as a Michael acceptor to form a covalent bond with the active site Cys residue. 17, 18 Recent research has shown that AG7088 is effective against EV6 and EV9 with EC 50 of 43 and 15 nM, respectively, likely due to the structural similarity of their 3C proteases judging from their sequence homology. 19 This provides a starting point for developing potent inhibitors against EV71.\n\nIn this study we have expressed, purified, and characterized the recombinant EV71 3C protease and developed a fluorescencebased enzymatic assay according to the substrate specificity. Based on the crystal structure of RV 3C protease in complex with AG7088, 17 we designed and synthesized new compounds and evaluated their inhibitory activities in both enzymatic and cell-based assays. Our findings serve as a basis for anti-EV71 drug development.\n\nThe EV71 3C protease expressed with pET16b vector contained N-or C-terminal hexa-His-tag and both forms were purified by using Ni-NTA column. In order to observe the effect of additional residues (hexa-His) on the protease activity, we also expressed the protease without any tag and purified it by using a cation-exchange column followed by a size-exclusion column. The three forms of the protein were purified to homogeneity as shown in the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) . The yields of the N-and C-terminal Histagged forms were higher (2.2 and 3.6 mg/L medium, respectively) than that of the tag-free protease (0.8 mg/L medium).\n\nThe three forms of protease were compared for their activities using the fluorescence-based assay as described below. It was found that the protease with a C-terminus His-tag had specific activity equal to that of the tag-free enzyme, but the enzyme with N-terminal His-tag displayed 10-fold lower activity, indicating that additional N-terminal amino acids interfered with the protease activity. We thus used the protease with C-terminal His-tag in the following studies.\n\nThe peptides corresponding to the autoprocessing sites by the 3C protease including RQAVTQ;GFPTEL between vp2 and vp3, QTGTIQ;GDRVAD between vp3 and vp1, DEAMEQ;GVSDYI between 2A and 2C, IEALFQ;GPPKFR between 3A and 3B, RTATVQ;GPSLDF between 3B and 3C, YFCSEQ;GEIQWN between 3C and 3D, and TSAVLQ;SGFRKM derived from the N-terminal auto-processing site of a 3C-like protease from severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 20,21 which all contain Gln followed by a small amino acid (Ser or Gly) to serve as the cleavage sites, were tested as substrates for 3C protease of EV71 (; indicates the cleavage site). Surprisingly, EV71 3C protease showed substantially better activity (60-fold) against TSAVLQ;SGFRKM, the substrate of the SARS-CoV 3C-like protease, than aganist its own cleavage sites based on the HPLC assay (Fig. 1B) . Therefore, the peptide Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans with the fluorescence quenching pair (Dabcyl-Edans) was chosen for EV71 3C protease assay to monitor the fluorescence increase due to the peptide bond cleavage in real time. The K m and k cat of the enzyme in using this fluorogenic substrate were measured to be 5.8 \u00b1 0.9 lM and 0.45 min \u00c01 , respectively (Fig. 1C ).\n\nWe used 3 (the intermediate in synthesizing AG7088) 22 as a starting material for making new AG7088 analogues (Fig. 2 ) by modifying the reported methods. [23] [24] [25] The protecting group tertbutyloxycarbony (Boc) in 3 was removed and the resulting species was reacted with Boc-protected Phe to make 4. This molecule contained P1-lactam ring, P2-Boc-Phe, and P1 0 -a,b-unsaturated ethyl ester. To simplify the synthesis, a variety of different acyl chlorides were coupled with P2-Boc-Phe through an amide bond to make a library of compounds from 4. Among them, we found that the best inhibition came from the compounds derived from cinnamoyl chlorides. As illustrated in Figure 2A , cinnamoyl chlorides 5a-c with substituents of 3,4-(methylenedioxy), 4-dimethylamino, and H in the benzene ring, respectively, were incorporated into 4 to make 6a-c.\n\nTo make the analogues containing aldehyde at the P1 0 position, 2 was condensed with benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)-protected Phe to make 7 (Fig. 2B ). The P1 0 -methyl ester in 7 was converted to aldehyde to make 8. By adding cinnamoyl chlorides 5a-f into 7, the methyl esters 9a-f were formed. Compounds 10a-f were synthesized from the reduction, followed by oxidation of the methyl esters 9a-f.\n\nRecombinant 3C protease and the fluorogenic substrate were used to evaluate the IC 50 of the synthesized compounds. Compound 4 with the basic features of AG7088 with P1-lactam ring, P1 0 -a,b-unsaturated ester, and P2-Boc-Phe did not inhibit the enzyme at 20 lM (the greatest concentration tested). With additional cinnamoyl groups, 6a-c showed smaller IC 50 values of 10.6, 8.2, and 10.0 lM against the enzyme, respectively, when they were not preincubated with the protease (Table 1) . However, the timedependent inhibition was observed in a prolonged time window for 6b as an example (Fig. 3 , top panel). From the replot (Fig. 3 , lower panel), the k inact was calculated to be 0.077 min \u00c01 and the K i was 2.6 lM. In agreement with their K i values, 6a-c showed EC 50 of 1.8, 2.9 and 1.3 lM, respectively, in the anti-viral assay.\n\nHowever, 6b and 6c displayed some cellular toxicity with CC 50 of 21 and 8 lM, respectively.\n\nWhen replacing a,b-unsaturated ester with an aldehyde at the P1 0 position, 10a-e displayed 10-to 100-fold smaller EC 50 values compared to 6a-c (Table 1) . Both 10b and 10d displayed potent inhibitory activity with EC 50 of 18 and 26 nM, respectively, without cytotoxicity at the concentration approximately 1000-fold greater than their EC 50 . The anti-viral activity of 10d was further demonstrated by using a western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 4 To rationalize the different inhibitory activities of these compounds, a computer program was used to dock 6b (in cyan), 10b (in yellow), and AG7088 (in salmon) into the active site of EV71 3C protease structure simulated using the structure of RV 3C protease as a template. From the computer modeling (Fig. 5) , we found in order to accommodate the a,b-unsaturated ester of 6b (a poor inhibitor) at the S1 0 site, its cinnamoyl group is forced away from the S3 site (see the top view in the left panel and side view in the right panel) and could not make proper interaction with the nearby amino acids (e.g., Phe170), leading to significant loss of binding affinity and inhibitory activity. However, with the aldehyde of much smaller size in 10b (a potent inhibitor), the binding becomes favorable. The aldehyde group of 10b occupies a similar position to that of the a-carbon of AG7088 in the active site, and is readily accessible by the nucleophile Cys147. show the purified proteins without tag, with N-terminal His-tag, and with C-terminal His-tag, respectively. (B) Compared to the peptides derived from its own auto-activation sites, EV71 3C protease showed the best activity toward the preferred substrate, TSAVLQSGFRKM, of the SARS-CoV 3C-like protease. (C) Using the peptide containing a fluorescence quenching pair, the initial rates of the protease versus substrate concentrations were measured to obtain the k cat of 0.45 min \u00c01 and K m of 5.8 \u00b1 0.9 lM.\n\nIn this study, we have verified that EV71 3C protease is a target for anti-EV 71 drug discovery based on the enzyme-and cell-based assays. The compounds, which inhibited the protease activity, also blocked the viral replication in the cell-based assay with similar activity. In order to set up an assay for finding the protease inhibitors, we have expressed, purified, and characterized the recombinant EV71 3C protease. By testing the potential substrates, we unexpectedly found that the protease showed the best activity A HO 2 C CO 2 H NH 2 against a substrate peptide derived from the N-terminal autocleavage site of SARS-CoV 3C-like protease. Using this fluorogenic peptide, we evaluated a series of AG7088 analogues as inhibitors of EV71 3C protease, which were further tested for their anti-viral activities.\n\nCompared to the complicated procedure to synthesize AG7088, which requires synthesis and assembly of three moieties, we report potent AG7088 analogues that can be easily synthesized and used as anti-EV71 agents in this study. In contrast to the tripeptide aldehyde inhibitors of RV 3C protease, which contain Gln or unnatural amino acid at P1, Phe at P2, and Cbz-Leu at the P3 position, showing moderate EC 50 in the lM range, 26 \n\nand 10d with the lactam ring at the P1 position, Phe at P2, cinnamoyl derivatives at P3, and aldehyde at P1 0 exhibit great inhibitory activities in enzymatic and anti-viral assays without cytotoxicity.\n\nTherefore, P1-lactam group is important and Leu or Val at the P3 position seems not important for the anti-virus activity. However, with only P1-lactam, P2-Phe, and P1 0 -a,b-unsaturated ester, the key features of AG7088, do not guarantee the protease-binding affinity (no enzyme inhibition was found for compound 4 at 20 lM). Addition of cinnamoyl group at P3 and simultaneous replacement of P1 0 -a,b-unsaturated ester with aldehyde yield potent inhibition as rationalized by the computer modeling. Aldehyde group, which can form reversible covalent bond with the catalytic Cys, is important for inhibition since other compounds with CH 2 OH or CO 2 Me at P1 0 did not effectively inhibit the 3C protease. Our study provides potent EV71 3C protease inhibitors effective as anti-EV71 agents and facilitates the combinatorial synthesis of derivatives for further improving the inhibitory activity.\n\nAll the reagents were commercially available and used without further purification unless indicated otherwise. All solvents were of anhydrous grade unless indicated otherwise. All non-aqueous reactions were carried out in oven-dried glassware under a slight positive pressure of argon unless otherwise noted. Reaction mixtures were magnetically stirred and monitored by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel. Flash chromatography was performed on silica gel of 60-200 lm particle size. Yields are reported for spectroscopically pure compounds. Melting points were recorded on an Electrothermal MEL-TEMP \u00d2 1101D melting point apparatus.

IR spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet 380 FT-IR spectrometer. High resolution ESI mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Daltonics spectrometer.\n\nThe gene encoding EV71 3C protease was cloned from viral cDNA obtained from Chang-Gung memorial hospital (Tao-Yuan, Taiwan) by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The forward primer 5 0 -CATGCCATGGCATCATCATCATCATCATGGCCGAGCTTGGA C-3 0 and the backward primer 5 0 -GCGCTCGAGTCATTGTTCACT Purification of His-tagged protease was conducted at 4\u00b0C. The cell paste obtained from 2 L cell culture was suspended in an 80 mL lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl. A French-press instrument (AIM-AMINCO spectronic Instruments) was used to disrupt the cells at 12,000 psi. The lysis solution was centrifuged and the debris was discarded. The cellfree extract was loaded onto a 20-mL Ni-NTA column, which was equilibrated with 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole. The column was washed with 5 mM imidazole followed by a 30 mM imidazole-containing buffer. His-tagged protease was eluted with 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 300 mM imidazole. The protein solution was dialyzed against a 2\u00c2 2 L buffer containing 12 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 7.5 mM b-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM DTT.\n\nThe purified protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. The protein concentration used in all experiments was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm. For preparing untagged protein, SP sepharose, a cation exchange column, was applied to purify the protease. The untagged protein was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl from 200 to 1000 mM. Subsequently, the eluted sample was subjected to a size-exclusion chromatography (Sephadex 200, 10/300 GL column) for further purification.\n\nThe peptides for testing as the protease substrates were synthesized via solid phase using a 433A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Starting with 0.10 mmol (0.101 g) of p-hydroxymethyl phenoxymethyl polystyrene resin (1.01 mmol/g), the synthesis was performed using a stepwise FastMoc protocol (Applied Biosystems, USA). The amino acids were introduced using the manufacturer's prepacked cartridges (1 mmol each). For examining the substrate specificity of the protease, each peptide at 50 lM was incubated with 0.5 lM protease for 6 and 12 h, and the resulting mixture was injected into C-18 reverse-phase HPLC for analysis using the above-mentioned conditions. The areas of the product peaks were integrated to calculate the reaction rate of each peptide substrate under the catalysis of the protease.\n\nThe best peptide substrate was attached with a fluorescence quenching pair, and the fluorogenic peptide (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQ SGFRKME-Edans) was used to measure the protease activity. The kinetic constants for the fluorogenic peptide were measured in 10 mM MES at pH 6.5 (the optimal pH for EV71 3C protease) at 25\u00b0C. Enhanced fluorescence due to the cleavage of the peptide was monitored at 538 nm with excitation at 355 nm using a fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent from ThermoLabsystems, Finland). The enzyme concentration used in measuring K m and k cat values was 0.5 lM and the substrate concentrations were from 0.5to 5-fold of an estimated K m value. Substrate concentration was determined by using the extinction coefficients 5438 M \u00c01 cm \u00c01 at 336 nm (Edans) or 15,100 M \u00c01 cm \u00c01 at 472 nm (Dabcyl). The initial rates within 10% substrate consumption at different substrate concentrations were used to calculate the kinetic parameters using Michaelis-Menten equation fitted with the KaleidaGraph computer program.\n\nKnown compounds 1-3 and 6a were prepared as previously reported. [22] [23] [24] The synthesis of new compounds is described below in details. \n\nA solution of HCl in 1,4-dioxane (4.0 M, 10 mL) was added to a solution of 3 (652 mg, 2 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (5 mL) at room temperature.

After the reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h at 0\u00b0C, the reaction was quenched by adding saturated NH 4 Cl solution (5 mL). All volatiles were removed under reduced pressure and the aqueous residue was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (5\u00c2 10 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over MgSO 4 , filtrated, and concentrated. The crude product (225 mg) was used in the next step without further purification. The above alcohol (225 mg) was dissolved in CH 2 Cl 2 (20 mL) and was treated with Dess-Martin periodinane (640 mg, 1.5 mmol) at 0\u00b0C. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirring was continued for 3 h. The reaction was quenched with a mixture of Na 2 S 2 O 3 (1.26 g) in aqueous saturated NaHCO 3 (20 mL). The resulting mixture was stirred until the organic layer turned clear. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (3\u00c2 10 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtrated, and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH/CH 2 \n\nTo a solution of 5-methylisoxazole-3-carboxaldehyde (1.0 g, 9 mmol) and (carbethoxymethylene) triphenylphosphorane (4.70 g, 13.5 mmol) in toluene (30 mL) was refluxed for 5 h and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a crude product.

The fluorescence change resulted from the reaction was followed with time using a 96-well fluorescence plate reader. The initial velocities of the enzymatic reaction in the first 5 min of reactions were plotted against the different inhibitor concentrations to obtain the IC 50 by fitting with Eq. 1.\n\nIn Eq. 1, A(I) is the enzyme activity with inhibitor concentration [I], A(0) is the enzyme activity without inhibitor, and [I] is the inhibitor concentration. For the K i measurements from timedependent inhibition, 1-10 lM of inhibitor 6b was used to inhibit 0.5 lM enzyme. The reduction of enzyme activity with the incubation time of the enzyme with the inhibitor was fitted with a single exponential equation to obtain the k obs of inactivation at different inhibitor concentrations. From the k obs of inactivation, the half-life (t 1/2 ) can be calculated (t 1/2 = ln2/k obs ). The half-life for inactivation at each inactivator concentration was plotted against 1/[inactivator] to yield a line. The intersection at the y-axis was ln 2/k inact , from which the value of k inact was determined. The extrapolated negative x-axis intercept was \u00c01/K i .\n\nThis assay measured the ability of a tested compound to prevent the infection of EV71 on human embryonic rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD cells). The 96-well tissue culture plates were seeded with 200 lL of RD cells at a concentration of 1.1 \u00c2 10 5 cells/mL in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The plates were incubated for 24-30 h at 37\u00b0C and were used at about 90% confluence. Virus (100 TCID 50 ) mixed with different concentrations of the tested compounds was added to the cells and incubated at 35\u00b0C for 1 h. After adsorption, the infected cell plates were overlaid with 50 lL of DMEM plus 2% FBS and 0.1% DMSO. The plate was incubated at 35\u00b0C for 72 h. At the end of incubation, the plates were fixed by the addition of 100 lL of 4% formaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. After the removal of formaldehyde, the plates were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 15 min at room temperature. The plates were washed and dried, and the density of the remaining cells in the wells was measured at 570 nm. The concentration required for a tested compound to reduce the virus-induced cell death by 50% relative to the virus control was defined as EC 50 . All assays were performed in triplicate and at least twice.\n\nThe ability of 10d to inhibit viral protein accumulation was performed by using RD cells grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The confluent cells in 12-well plates were infected with EV71 (EV71 TW/2231/98) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in the absence or presence of 10d at 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 or 1 lM. After 48 h post infection, total cell lysate was harvested and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Protein samples were subsequently transferred to PVDF membrane and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody against EV71 3C protease and antib-actin antibody. A rabbit anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:2000; Amersham biosciences) was used as the secondary antibody. The horseradish peroxidase was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany).\n\nConstruction of EV71 3C protease structural model was based on the X-ray crystal structure of RV 3C protease with AG7088 bound (PDB code 1CQQ) as template using the software of Discovery studio 1.7 (Accelrys, Inc.). Docking of 6b and 10b in the active site was performed with an automated ligand-docking program of Discovery studio 1.7. The docking utilized a genetic algorithm and a set of parameters to control the precise operation via defined binding sites, specified ligand conformations, energy grid parameters, variable numbers of Monte Carol trials, and selected score type."}
