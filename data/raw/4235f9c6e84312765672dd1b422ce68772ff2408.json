This apparent discrepancy could be explained if an interaction between pAPN and possibility seems unlikely because most enteric viruses have the same nucleotide as PTV at position 214 (S\u00e1 n-two domains of S protein located at both areas (amino acids near residue 219 and amino acids 522 to 744) are chez et al., 1992), indicating that most likely a single nucleotide change at position 655 was responsible for required to infect the enteric tract. Alternatively, a putative second factor, such as coreceptor, mapping around the loss of enteric tropism. Nucleotides 214 and 655 are located within the area of the S gene which is deleted amino acid 219 of the spike protein could be specifically required to infect the enteric tract and responsible for in PRCVs, strongly suggesting that this deletion was responsible for the loss of enteric tropism in PRCVs. In the loss of enteric tropism in PTV and PRCV isolates. Other explanations are also possible and the loss on human immunodeficiency and other virus systems it has also been shown that a single point mutation can alter enteric tropism could also be due to: (i) a decrease in the pH stability required to allow the virus passage tropism (Takeuchi et al., 1991) .\n\nAn intragastric inoculation route was employed to as-through the stomach, (ii) a decrease in virion resistance to bile salts and proteolytic enzymes in gut, and (iii) an sure that the inoculum of each isolate was introduced into the stomach, independently of their tropism. While alteration in the strength or affinity of the S/receptor interaction. Recent studies also located the receptor binding viruses with enteric tropism have been found in the intes-"}
