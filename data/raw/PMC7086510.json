{"title": "A continuous method for the large-scale extraction of plasmid DNA by modified boiling lysis", "body": "Recent progresses in the development of DNA vaccination and gene therapy show great potential for the treatment of disease. As clinical application of these technologies will require large quantities of plasmid DNA at the milligram level, there is an increased demand for large quantities of recombinant plasmid DNA1,2. Thus, developing a large-scale, reproducible and cost-effective protocol for plasmid DNA preparation is now one of the most challenging tasks in DNA vaccine development3,4,5.\n\nTarget DNA sequences can be amplified to produce large quantities of purified DNA for use in such applications as gene therapy by ligation into a plasmid vector, which can then be transformed into suitable bacterial cells. These recombinant bacterial strains will replicate the plasmid, producing large quantities of the target DNA6. A typical process of plasmid DNA generation includes the construction and selection of appropriate expression vectors, production of recombinant microorganisms and cell growth, followed by lysis of the cells, and the extraction and purification of plasmid DNA7. When the plasmids are extracted and purified, they usually result in one of two forms: either open-circled or supercoiled. However, when they are used in gene therapy or vaccine immunization, the plasmid with the supercoiled form is preferred. During plasmid DNA extraction, the step of lysing bacterial cells without losing plasmids is probably the most critical for downstream processing8, as the quantity of plasmid DNA recovered is mostly determined by this step after fermentation9,10.\n\nPlasmid DNA extraction from bacterial cells usually begins with a chemical lysis step6, such as alkaline lysis11, which is a widely adopted method in research laboratories. However, during alkaline lysis, precipitates form that contain cell debris, denatured proteins and nucleic acids, which must be removed. Centrifugation on a fixed-angle rotor is the most common operation during this process12,13 and is a rate-limiting step for a large-scale preparation14. An alternative method is boiling lysis, in which the 100 \u00b0C thermal treatment disrupts and makes cells release the plasmid DNA15. Although boiling lysis can isolate more plasmids than alkaline lysis, the inconsistent plasmid yield and purity, and the difficulty in operation, make this method undesirable even for laboratory research-scale preparations16. For large-scale production, a high-pressure homogenizer is used to continuously disrupt cells17. However, this often causes problems in collecting fragmented DNA plasmids and more contaminated genomic DNA due to its severe fluid dynamic forces for destruction17. Therefore, the development of a highly efficient continuous lysis and scalable protocol becomes a challenging but important issue.\n\nBased on the conventional boiling lysis protocol18, Lee and Lander have made several modifications to improve the method19,20. Although these modifications significantly improve the efficiency of boiling lysis and the yield of plasmid DNA, they require centrifugation steps at the bacterial-collecting and plasmid-extracting stage, special equipment and reagents. In a recent report21, we described a design for a flow-through protocol from cultured bacteria for the extraction of plasmid DNA. The schematic design of the device and set-up is shown in Figure 1. The use of a 0.2 \u03bcm pore size hollow fiber-membrane module to harvest the fermented bacteria will minimize the centrifugation step, which is one of the limiting steps in large-scale preparation. Pumping through the heat-exchanging coils, cells receive uniform thermal treatment regardless of the volume of the sample, which ensures continuity and homogeneity of cell lysis. The diameter of copper coils can vary, depending on the volume of fermentation. This provides versatility for any given volume of samples. This protocol does not aim to increase the yield of plasmid, but to provide consistency between batches, which can otherwise be lacking in boiling lysis methods. A centrifugation step is, however, still required to separate the plasmid-containing supernatant from the lysed bacteria, which will require further optimization. Overall, this protocol provides a scalable, efficient and cost-effective preparation system to meet the needs of large-scale plasmid production for both laboratories and industry. The protocol mainly details the lysis of cells and the extraction of plasmid DNA, and although further purification procedures may be required, they are not explained in detail within this protocol.\n\n\nYeast extract and tryptone (Oxford Ltd, cat. no.

Chemicals should be dissolved into solution one after other and the tryptone and yeast extract should be the last to be dissolved. After the medium is autoclaved at 121 \u00b0C for 20 min and cooled down to room temperature, the filtered antibiotic should be injected via a sterilized inlet valve into the medium.Feeding medium 71 g l\u22121 yeast extract, 71 g l\u22121 peptone, 170 g l\u22121 glycerol, 5.7 g l\u22121 MgSO4. The yeast extract, peptone and glycerol should be made in one bottle in water and the MgSO4 made in another bottle in water; they are then autoclaved separately at 121 \u00b0C for 20 min and combined together with the same volume after they are cooled to room temperature.TE buffer 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0.10\u00d7 Lysis buffer 100 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of lysozyme, 1 M of NaCl and 20% of Triton-X-100.CriticalLysis buffer must be freshly made.TAE buffer 40 mM Tris-Acetate, 1 mM EDTA.LB medium 10 g l\u22121 tryptone, 5 g l\u22121 yeast extract, 5 g l\u22121 NaCl in water. Add the desired antibiotic at the following concentrations: Ampicillin, add 1 ml of 100 mg ml\u22121 ampicillin per liter of media (final = 100 \u03bcg ml\u22121); Kanamycin, add 1 ml of 50 mg ml\u22121 kanamycin per liter of media (final = 50 \u03bcg ml\u22121).LB agar plates Include 15 g agar with the ingredients for 1 l of LB medium. Pour approximately 30 ml LB-agar at 50 \u00b0C per plate and store plates at 4 \u00b0C. The concentration of antibiotic is the same as for LB medium.\n\n\n\nTransform a plasmid of interest into competent E. coli TOP10 using an appropriate method (e.g., heat shock or electroporation15).Propagate bacteria in a suitable antibiotic-selective LB culture15 at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h.Plate bacteria onto LB agar plates containing 50 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of kanamycin and incubate at 37 \u00b0C overnight.Critical StepDo not plate too many cells onto the selective plate. It may be necessary to plate 10 \u03bcl and 100 \u03bcl of transformed bacteria onto different plates to obtain appropriate colony separation.Pick a single recombinant bacterial colony carrying the target plasmid and seed onto 10 ml of antibiotic-selective LB medium.Critical StepSelect a single well-separated E. coli colony and use it for seed culturing.Incubate at 37 \u00b0C overnight at 200 rpm in an orbital shaker for 10\u201312 h.Critical StepThe bacteria should not be used to seed cultures beyond their log phase (if their OD value is more than 0.6), otherwise a low yield of plasmid can occur.Inoculate 5 ml of the seed bacteria onto 50 ml of LB medium containing an appropriate amount of antibiotics, and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for an additional 12 h in the orbital shaker.Inoculate 50 ml culture into 4 l of semi-synthesized media with antibiotics in an automatically controlled fermentor.Ferment using the following conditions: set the temperature at 37 \u00b0C and the dissolved oxygen (DO) at 30%. Maintain the pH at 7.0 by the addition of ammonium hydroxide solution (30%) and 5 M hydrochloric acid (HCl). Set the inflow sparge air to 7 l min\u22121 and add 400 ml of feeding media at the rate of 20 ml h\u22121. It takes 10\u201312 h to complete the fermentation, but it can be varied and is dependent on the bacteria used.Critical StepDuring fermentation, a constant volume of DO should be maintained at 30%; when DO is more than 30%, the bacteria will grow quicker, but the plasmid copies will be lost as the plasmid could not replicate quickly enough to keep up with the rapid cell division. We found the optimal DO value to be 30% in different bacterial strains and different plasmid DNAs.To monitor cell growth, collect a sample of 2 ml of the culture every 2 h during fermentation to determine the density at OD 600 nm, and stop the fermentation once the density reaches a plateau after two consecutive readings.\n\n\n\n10After the OD 600 nm value reaches a plateau, pump bacteria into the 0.2 \u03bcm pore-size hollow-fiber membrane module using pump P1, by opening inlet valve V1.Critical StepThe hollow-fiber membrane module should be pre-wetted with one bed volume of TE buffer. The flow rate of fermented culture must be deliberately controlled to allow the liquid to pass into the module and through the fiber membrane, discharging into the waste container (C1), while keeping the retained cells on the outside of the membrane and so inside of the column. The permeate flow control can be achieved by reducing or increasing the feed pump (P1) velocity to reduce or to increase the inlet transmembrane pressure. Outlet valve V2 must be open to allow waste discharge into C1.11When all the fermented culture has been pumped into the module and discharged into the waste container, leaving the concentrated bacteria within the module, switch inlet valve V1 to allow one bed volume of TE buffer to be pumped into the module by pump P1 to rinse cells as the V2 remains open to discharge the rinsed TE buffer into C1.12Close outlet valve V2 and increase the feed pump (P1) velocity by 1.5\u20132 times to increase the inlet pressure of TE, in order to discharge cells from the module through the top outlet into C2 container.Pause pointThe concentrated cells can be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until use. Normally, fermented bacteria can be concentrated by 5\u20138-fold after the hollow fiber module.\n\n\n\n13The freshly collected bacteria or the frozen bacteria paste after thawing are re-suspended with TE buffer to OD 600 nm = 100 monitored by a UV/VIS spectrophotometer.Critical StepCells harvested from the fermentation should be diluted to the OD 600 nm of 100 to allow uniform subsequent lysis; a higher density of bacteria may result in an incomplete lysis.14Treat with 1/10 volume of 10\u00d7 freshly made lysis buffer at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min with gentle stirring.Critical StepWhen the bacteria are treated with the lysis buffer, the stirring should be very gentle and stirring is recommended at 10\u201320 rpm; otherwise, the cells will be overlysed during the heating process.15Switch on P2 to pump the bacteria from C2 through a copper-coil (or made of glass; A) that is immersed in a 70 \u00b0C water bath (C3) and immediately through another copper-coil (B) that is immersed in an ice bath (C4) to terminate the lysis, before being collected in a container that is set in the ice-cold water bath (see Fig. 2).Critical StepAdjust the flow rate using a stop watch so that the bacteria pass through the heated coil within 20 s. We have found this to be an optimal time period for the thermal lysis of cells; however, other times may be tested if an optimal yield can not be obtained. As indicated in Figure 2, the temperatures of 70 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C achieved a higher yield of plasmids with a minimum contamination with genomic DNA. However, 70 \u00b0C is probably the most appropriate setting in terms of the balance between energy costs and the quality of plasmids produced. An immediate connection from the heating coil to the coil submerged in ice should be used to avoid excess lysis.\n\n\n\n16Lysed bacteria are centrifuged at 12,000g for 30 min.17To precipitate the plasmid DNA from the supernatant in a floc form, transfer the supernatant into a clean flask (C5) containing 0.1 volume of NaOAc (3 M, pH 5.2) and 0.6 volume of isopropyl alcohol, and incubate at room temperature for 20 min.Critical StepTo obtain perfect floc precipitates, do not vigorously shake the mixture of plasmid after adding isopropyl alcohol. If a high yield of plasmid is obtained from the precipitation, the incubation time can be reduced, as appropriate, and white floc can be immediately collected by passing through the 200 mesh nylon filter.18Collect the floc precipitates by passing through a bucket with 200 mesh nylon filter on the bottom.19Rinse twice with 70% ethanol (EtOH) while the precipitates are still on the filter, and air-dry.Pause pointThe dry precipitates can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for weeks.Critical StepDipping the bucket into 70% ethanol several times can enable effective rinsing. This will remove contamination as the dipping action will disassociate substances from the plasmid floc. Rinsing with 70% ethanol is important to eliminate impure substances, such as RNAs; sometimes, an additional rinse with chloroform before the 70% ethanol washes will remove some of the protein or lipid contamination.\n\n\n\n20The precipitates collected are re-suspended with 1\u20135 ml of TE buffer.21Purification of plasmid DNA can be performed using either option A or B:A\nPurification by PEG precipitation\niMix with the same volume of 13% PEG 8000 (in 1.6 M NaCl solution).iiCentrifuge at 15,000g at room temperature for 10 min.iiiDissolve purified plasmid DNA in fresh 1 ml TE buffer and the plasmid can be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for long-term storage.\nB\nUse a Qiagen Maxiprep column, according to the manufacturer's instructions\niThe purification method can be adapted to be used with any available commercial purification column, such as the one made by Qiagen.\n\n\n\n\n22Digest the plasmid with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and XbaI for 2\u20133 h, and the reaction should be stopped by incubation at 60 \u00b0C for 10 min.23Load the digestion reaction onto 0.7% agarose gel containing 0.05 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of ethidium bromide, covering with TBE buffer to perform electrophoresis for 1 h at 60 V.Critical StepThe appropriate concentration of agarose gel should be based on the size of the tested plasmid.24View under 300 nm UV light and record using a digital camera.25Plasmid quality can also be analyzed by measuring its ratio of OD 260/280 nm using UV/VIS spectrophotometry. The ratio of the OD values at 260 nm versus those at 280 nm should be 1.8\u20132.0, which is within the range of acceptable purity for plasmids.\n\n\n\n26The plasmid is serially diluted 1:1 with TE buffer and subjected to 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis (as in Step 23), along with a standard DNA marker with a known concentration. All bands are visualized under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide and visualized on a UV transilluminator. Photographic records obtained from a digital camera (Olympus) are analyzed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) by comparing the intensity of the known concentration of marker DNA as a reference with the plasmid to determine the concentration of the tested plasmid.\n\n\nTroubleshooting advice can be found in Table 2.\n\nCollection of bacteria in the hollow fiber membrane module: 20 min\n\nLysozyme treatment: 20 min\n\nThermal treatment: 5\u201310 min\n\nCentrifugation: 30 min\n\nPlasmid precipitation: 20 min\n\nPurification: 20 min\n\nThe plasmid yields from three independent trials are shown in Table 3. In general, this process can yield plasmid at around 100 mg l\u22121 culture after purification, which presents an attractive protocol for laboratory use and a large-scale process. After purification by PEG 8000 precipitation, most of the plasmids are shown in supercoiled form (Fig. 3), and the ratio of OD 260/280 nm is around 1.8\u20131.9 (Table 3)."}
