{"title": "Evolved sequence features within the intrinsically disordered tail influence FtsZ assembly and bacterial cell division", "body": "Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) feature prominently in eukaryotic proteins (Dunker et al., 2002a; van der Lee et al., 2014) . These regions are associated with a range of molecular functions that contribute to an assortment of cellular processes (Dunker et al., 2002b; Iakoucheva et al., 2002; Iakoucheva et al., 2004; Wright and Dyson, 2015) . IDRs and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) defy the well-established sequence-structure-function paradigm that provides a coherent framework for connecting sequence-encoded information to molecular functions for proteins that fold into well-defined three-dimensional structures (Babu, 2016) . This is because conformational heterogeneity is a defining hallmark of IDRs / IDPs (Babu et al., 2012; Forman-Kay and Mittag, 2013; Lyle et al., 2013; Wright and Dyson, 2015) . Despite this sequence-intrinsic conformational heterogeneity it has become clear that IDRs and IDPs have definable sequence-to-conformation relationships (Das et al., 2015; Forman-Kay and Mittag, 2013; Gibbs and Showalter, 2016) . The overall sizes, shapes, and amplitudes of conformational fluctuations of IDRs / IDPs are governed by compositional parameters such as the fraction of charged residues and the overall proline contents (Hofmann et al., 2012; Holehouse et al., 2017; Mao et al., 2013; Muller-Spath et al., 2010) . Additional contributions to sequence-to-conformation relationships include the linear patterning of oppositely charged residues as well as the linear patterning of proline and charged residues Martin et al., 2016) .\n\nProgresses in advancing our understanding of sequence-to-conformation relationships of IDRs / IDPs (Mollica et al., 2016; Schneider et al., 2015) have opened the door to using sequence design as a tool to investigate the functional and phenotypic effects of modulating sequence-to-conformation relationships of IDPs / IDRs (Das et al., 2016; Sherry et al., 2017; Staller et al., 2018) . These studies have been directed at yeast proteins that control cell cycle arrest (Das et al., 2016) , mating type switching (Martin et al., 2016) , and transcriptional activation (Staller et al., 2018) and mammalian systems that regulate cell differentiation (Sherry et al., 2017) , tumor suppression (Borcherds et al., 2014) , and transcriptional regulation (Portz et al., 2017) . There is also growing interest in the roles of IDRs / IDPs as modulators of the driving forces for the formation of membraneless organelles and protein-RNA bodies in eukaryotic systems (Dao et al., 2018; Harmon et al., 2017; Hernandez-Vega et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018; Mitrea et al., 2018; Mitrea and Kriwacki, 2016; Wei et al., 2017) .\n\nIn contrast to eukaryotic systems and viruses, where the functional importance of IDRs / IDPs is reasonably well established (Berlow et al., 2017; Jensen et al., 2011; Mollica et al., 2016; Wright and Dyson, 2015) , the prevailing dogma is that bacterial proteins largely conform to the classical sequence-structure-function paradigm (Dunker et al., 2015; Pavlovic-Lazetic et al., 2011) . This view has emerged from bioinformatics analysis, which shows that only a small percentage of bacterial proteins include long IDRs (Brown et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2006; Yruela et al., 2017) . The apparent bias against IDRs / IDPs in bacterial proteomes has been ascribed to a variety of factors. These include shorter protein lengths, the importance of well-defined structure in metabolic enzymes, and the purportedly focused / limited repertoire of functions associated with bacterial proteins (Brown et al., 2010; Dunker et al., 2001; Yruela et al., 2017) .\n\nHowever, recent studies have demonstrated that while IDRs / IDPs may make up a small fraction of proteins / protein regions in bacterial proteomes when compared to eukaryotic ones, the synergies between IDRs and folded domains contribute directly to an assortment of functions. Prominent bacterial IDRs / IDPs include proteins involved in regulating cell division (Buske and Levin, 2013; Buske et al., 2015) , DNA replication (Kozlov et al., 2015; Shereda et al., 2008) , protein and RNA quality control (Ait- Foit et al., 2013; Jakob et al., 2014; Quan et al., 2014; Reichmann et al., 2012; Updegrove et al., 2016) , bacterial warfare (Bonsor et al., 2008; Hecht et al., 2009; Papadakos et al., 2015) , biofilm formation (Gruszka et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2017; Whelan and Potts, 2015) , and chemotaxis (Daughdrill et al., 1997; Dedmon et al., 2002; Ding et al., 2009) . These findings raise a key dimerization step and the elongation of polymers (Caplan and Erickson, 2003; Romberg et al., 2001) . Filaments can associate laterally with one another to form bundles (Gonzalez et al., 2005; Romberg and Levin, 2003) . GTP hydrolysis promotes the bending of laterally associated polymers to form wreath-like structures that vary in thickness around the circumference (den Blaauwen et al., 2017) .\n\nCalorimetric measurements suggest that the formation of FtsZ assemblies requires the crossing of a critical concentration threshold (Caplan and Erickson, 2003; Chen et al., 2005) . This apparent cooperativity is at odds with the observation that FtsZ forms stable singlestranded filaments, which is the defining characteristic of isodesmic assembly (Oosawa and Kasai, 1962) . Numerous models have been developed to describe how FtsZ assembles cooperatively. These models suggest that FtsZ subunits might undergo conformational changes to facilitate the population of a high affinity state that favors polymerization (Miraldi et al., 2008) .\n\nDetailed molecular and structural evidence for such a high affinity state remains elusive. In this context, it is worth noting that most models for FtsZ assembly have been motivated primarily by the structure and dynamics of the conserved and well-folded GTPase domain.\n\nWe propose that clues to the observed complexities and regulation of FtsZ assembly come from the distinctive protein architecture, which include modules other than the GTPase domain ( Figure 1A) . The modular architecture of FtsZ encompasses a folded N-terminal core domain that forms an active GTP hydrolysis site upon dimerization. The negatively charged core includes the GTP binding site and the coordinating T7 loop. The interface between the nucleotide binding site and the T7 loop (in dimers and higher order polymers) forms the active site for GTP hydrolysis (Oliva et al., 2007) . The C-terminal stretch of FtsZ includes an intrinsically disordered linker (CTL), a 17-residue C-terminal peptide (CTP), and 7-10 residue stretch that is rich in basic residues and has been designated as the C-terminal variable region or CTV Levin, 2012, 2013; Buske et al., 2015) . The CTP is an alpha-helical 7 molecular recognition element (Oldfield et al., 2005) that coordinates heterotypic protein-protein interactions involving FtsZ. The interaction partners that engage with FtsZ through the CTP include the protein FtsA, which assists in the bundling of FtsZ protofilaments and anchoring of Z-rings to bacterial membranes, and SepF, which is required for the late stages of cell division (Adams and Errington, 2009) . Depending on its charge, the CTV can play a significant role in mediating lateral interactions between FtsZ polymers in vitro and in determining the integrity of the FtsZ ring in vivo (Buske and Levin, 2012) .\n\nPrevious studies showed that deletion of the CTL leads to aberrant FtsZ assembly that compromises Z-ring formation and cell division (Buske and Levin, 2013) . Replacing the wildtype (WT) CTL with a scrambled sequence variant of the linker preserves Z-ring formation and cell division. In contrast, replacing the CTL with a rigid alpha-helical domain from human betacatenin yielded diffuse FtsZ puncta that compromise Z-ring formation and cell division (Buske and Levin, 2013) . This work underscored the importance of the disordered CTL in FtsZ assembly and Z-ring formation. It also raised several questions regarding the contribution of the intrinsically disordered CTL to the assortment of functions coordinated by FtsZ. Here, we pursue answers to some of these questions by leveraging insights that have emerged through systematic studies of sequence-encoded conformational preferences of intrinsically disordered proteins / regions (Das et al., 2015) .\n\nWe focus here on the CTL of B. subtilis FtsZ because its amino acid compositional bias is similar, in terms of the fraction of charged residues and net charge per residue, to that of a third of the CTL sequences in rod-shaped bacteria (Buske et al., 2015) . The fraction of charged residues is 0.33 and the net charge per residue is +0.06 implying that the CTT is polyampholytic.\n\nThe overall sizes, shapes, and amplitudes of conformational fluctuations of polyampholytic sequences are governed by a combination of the fraction of charged residues, the net charge per residue, the length of the IDR, and the linear patterning of oppositely charged residues (Das All rights reserved.

In polyampholytic IDRs, oppositely charged residues can be separated into distinct blocks or they can be uniformly mixed along the sequence ( Figure 1B) . The linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues can be quantified using different parameters Sawle and Ghosh, 2015; Sawle et al., 2017) . The one we use here is designated as \u03ba, where 0 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 1 . If oppositely charged residues are well mixed, then the sequence will have low \u03ba-values. In contrast, separation of oppositely charged residues into discrete blocks within the linear sequence leads to higher values of \u03ba. In well-mixed sequences, preferential solvation of charged residues combined with a counterbalancing of intra-chain electrostatic repulsions and attractions will promote chain expansion. Increased linear segregation of oppositely charged residues causes systematic compaction of IDRs leading to smaller values for radii of gyration, more spherical shapes for individual molecules, and decreased amplitudes of global conformational fluctuations ( Figure   1B) .\n\nA recent analysis of polyampholytic IDRs drawn from the human proteome showed an inverse correlation between median \u03ba-values and median values for the fraction of charged residues . Importantly, based on random distributions of disordered sequences with an FCR \u2248 0.3 there is a clear evolutionary preference for sequences with higher than randomly expected \u03ba-values ( Figure S1 ). Interestingly, previous studies also showed that there is a clear selection against sequences with higher values of \u03ba (> 0.45) . These observations also apply to CTT sequences drawn from 1209 orthologous FtsZ proteins (Buske et al., 2015) . Here, we explore the functional and phenotypic impacts of charge segregation / mixing within the polyampholytic CTT of FtsZ in B. subtilis. We studied the impact of varying \u03ba within the CTT of B. subtilis FtsZ and quantified the impact of changing \u03ba on CTT conformations, cell division, Z-ring formation, cell growth, and the biophysical aspects of FtsZ polymerization and GTPase activity.\n\nCTT \u03ba-values span a narrow range even though CTL sequences are hypervariable:\n\nWe quantified the evolutionary conservation of different regions within FtsZ across 1209 orthologous proteins. We used the sequences of G-actin derived from orthologs as a reference for this analysis because these sequences are highly conserved across evolution. We used the mean conservation score for G-actin to normalize the conservation scores for different regions of FtsZ. The results are shown in Figure 1C . The core of FtsZ and the CTP motif show considerably higher degrees of conservation when compared to the CTL and CTV regions, which are poorly conserved.\n\nWe also calculated the distribution of \u03ba-values for CTT sequences derived from 1209 distinct orthologs ( Figure 1D) . Given the conservation of the CTP, it follows that the variation in \u03ba is mainly due to sequence variations within the CTL. Roughly 95% of the CTT \u03ba values are within the interval 0.13 < \u03ba < 0.36. The CTT from B. subtilis FtsZ has a \u03ba value of 0.19. The expected distribution of \u03ba values for randomly shuffled sequences that are constrained to have the CTT composition of B. subtilis FtsZ is shifted to lower values when compared to the actual \u03ba values observed for the 1209 orthologous sequences ( Figure S2 ). However, when compared to the shuffled sequences generated in the absence of any selective pressure, many sequences with higher \u03ba values are found, although very few naturally occurring sequences have a \u03ba value above 0.4. This suggests that there is an evolutionary pressure against CTT sequences with \u03ba values that go above 0.4. Similarly, there appears to be a selection pressure against sequences with \u03ba values lower than 0.15.\n\nTo test the impact of changing CTT \u03ba values on FtsZ function, we designed a set of sequence variants of B. subtilis FtsZ. In these variants, we fixed the GTPase core domain, the amino acid composition of the CTL, and the sequence of the CTP. We shuffled the positions of charged and neutral residues within the B.\n\nsubtilis CTL to generate sequence variants of the CTT that span the spectrum of \u03ba values between 0.1 and 0.8. There are roughly 10 40 sequences that satisfy the design criteria ( Figure   2A ). Of these, we selected six variants of B. subtilis FtsZ and each of these variants is distinguished by the \u03ba value for the CTT, which spans the range from 0.15 to 0.72 (Figure 2A and Figure 2B ). Each of the designed B. subtilis FtsZ variants is designated as CTLVx, where x is an integer value that increases as the CTT \u03ba value increases.\n\nSequence-intrinsic conformational preferences of CTT sequences are influenced by the extent of charge segregation: We performed atomistic simulations of the WT CTT from B. subtilis FtsZ and the six designed variants. We used the ABSINTH implicit solvation model and forcefield paradigm (Vitalis and Pappu, 2009a; Vitalis and Pappu, 2009b) for these simulations. The results were used to quantify the impact of charge patterning on the overall sizes, shapes, and amplitudes of conformational fluctuations of CTT sequences modeled as autonomous units. As \u03ba increases, there is a clear trend toward compaction. We quantified the preference for compact structures in terms of the length normalized mean radii of gyration R g n that are plotted for the WT CTT and designed variants ( Figure 2C ). For each variant, R g n is calculated as the mean R g value of the variant divided by the square root of the number of residues n in the CTT. Variants of the B. subtilis CTT sequence with \u03ba values that are lower than the WT are slightly more expanded than the WT CTT, although the degree of expansion is not statistically significant. However, sequences with \u03ba values that are higher than the WT become increasingly more compact with increasing \u03ba. It follows, in accord with previous observations for other systems (Das et al., 2016; Das and Pappu, 2013; Sherry et al., 2017) , All rights reserved.

These parameters are quantified in terms of the radii of gyration (R g ) and asphericities (\u03b4 * ) that are achievable via spontaneous conformational fluctuations ( Figure 2D ). Distributions of R g and \u03b4 * for each of the designed CTT sequences are shown in Figure S3A . The diversity of sizes and shapes can be quantified using the (R g , \u03b4 * ) distributions and summarized in terms of a normalized Shannon entropy (s). Larger values of s imply a greater diversity of and sizes and shapes.\n\nA large number of distinct conformations might be compatible with similar values of R g and \u03b4 * . Here, we refer to this feature as the ruggedness of the energy landscape. Following previous approaches , we quantify ruggedness in terms of the degree of similarity / dissimilarity of backbone dihedral angles among every pair of conformations sampled by each variant. This yields a distribution of similarity / dissimilarity values denoted as p(D) and we take the mean value, denoted as D to be an average measure of backbone dihedral angle similarity / dissimilarity. For a well-folded protein, such as the FtsZ core, the value of D will be small because the backbone dihedral angles of distinct conformations that are accessible as a result of spontaneous fluctuations will be similar to one another. In contrast, the value of D will be higher for systems that sample conformations with distinctly different patterns of backbone dihedral angles.\n\nThe combination of values for s and D will define the sequence-specific topography of the energy landscape. This aspect is schematized in Figure S3B in terms of a one-dimensional projection of the energy landscape along a single conformational coordinate that combines the contributions of sizes, shapes, and backbone dihedral angles.

Figure 2E shows the values of D and s for the WT CTT and each of the designed CTT variants. These results show that of the seven CTT sequences, the WT sequence best conforms to the designation of encoding a wide and smooth landscape.\n\nThe energy landscapes of CTT sequences become progressively more rugged (increasing D) with increasing \u03ba, although the landscapes for variants CTLV1, CTLV2, CTLV3, and CTLV4 retain the width (similar s values) of the WT CTT. The energy landscapes of CTT sequences from CTLV5 and CLTV6 are fundamentally different in that they become narrower (smaller s values) and more rugged (larger D values) . Overall, our analysis shows that the WT CTT stands out as the sequence with nearly the highest conformational diversity in terms of global sizes and shapes (high s value) and the lowest ruggedness, given that it has the lowest D value.\n\nCellular phenotypes are robust in B. subtilis that express variants CTLV2, CTLV3, and CTLV4: We used in cell investigations to probe the impact of designed changes to CTT sequences on cell division and cell growth in B. subtilis. Western blots in Figure 3A show that the cellular levels of FtsZ variants are sensitive to sequence-encoded features within the CTT.\n\nFtsZ variants with extreme \u03ba values for their CTT sequences such as CTLV1 and CTLV6 are not well tolerated by the cells (Figure 3A ). This in turn influences Z-ring formation because it diminishes the cellular levels of the FtsZ variants. Clone verification using restriction digests and sequencing at the vector-insert junctions showed that the constructs were correctly cloned.\n\nInstead, it appears that variants that have low cellular levels are actively degraded as opposed to being under expressed.\n\nIn cells where CTLV1 reaches a sufficient concentration, well-defined Z-rings are formed ( Figure 3B ). The cellular levels of CTLV2, CTLV3, and CTLV4 are not compromised by the designed changes to the CTT sequences ( Figure 3A ). Cells expressing these three variants show robust Z-ring formation. This is true even though the \u03ba values for their CTT sequences All rights reserved.

However, Z-ring formation is compromised for cells expressing variants CTLV5 (\u03ba=0.46) and CTLV6 (\u03ba=0.72) ( Figure 3B ). These results suggest that increased segregation of oppositely charged residues within the CTT sequence leads to a disruption of Z-ring formation and haphazard localization of FtsZ puncta that in turn inhibit cell division.\n\nTo quantify the robustness / disruption of Z-ring formation, we measured the L/R ratio, which describes the ratio of the average length of the cell to the number of Z-rings observed (Buske and Levin, 2013) . This is a measure of the fitness and robustness of cell division in rodshaped bacteria. The L/R ratio is 7.2 \u00b1 1.2 for cells expressing WT FtsZ. Compromised fitness is indicated by L/R ratios that are larger than the WT. The L/R ratio is 5.9 \u00b1 1.1, 6.6 \u00b1 1.0, and 5.8 \u00b1 0.9 for cells expressing variants CTLV2, CTLV3, and CTLV4, respectively ( Figure 3C ). These measurements suggest robust Z-ring formation and division for cells expressing FtsZ variants with CTT \u03ba values between 0.18 and 0.40. In contrast, the L/R ratio is 18.8 \u00b1 1.6, 57.5 \u00b1 12.5, and 117.3 \u00b1 27.6 for cells expressing variants CTLV1 (CTT \u03ba=0.15), CTLV5 (CTT \u03ba=0.46), and CTLV6 (CTT \u03ba=0.72), respectively.\n\nThe higher L/R ratio for CTLV1 is likely due to lowered cellular levels ( Figure 3A ). The in vivo behavior we observe for cells expressing CTLV5 and CTLV6 cannot be explained in terms of reduced protein levels alone ( Figure 3B) . Therefore, as an additional measure of cell division efficiency we monitored the rate of change of optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ), which is proportional to the concentration of cells in mid-log phase of growth. A reduction in OD 600 would arise from the combination of a decrease in the efficiency of cell division, compromised metabolism, and increased cell death. As shown in Figure 3E , cells expressing CTLV5 and CTLV6 show a reduction in the rate of increase of OD 600 , indicating that CTLV5 and CTLV6 cause a significant reduction of the cellular growth rate. In contrast, cells expressing all other All rights reserved.

Accordingly, the active form of the enzyme is a dimer and GTP is hydrolyzed at the interface of the GTP binding site and the T7 loop ( Figure S4A ). GTP binding promotes dimerization and the formation of higher-order headto-tail polymers of FtsZ. In the dimeric state, GTP hydrolysis at the subunit interface leads to dissociation into two monomers (Scheffers et al., 2002) . In the polymeric form, GTP hydrolysis promotes bending and ring formation (Erickson et al., 2010) .\n\nRecent studies have shown that the CTT also has a role to play in polymerization and Zring formation, in vitro and in vivo (Buske and Levin, 2013) . Right-angle light scattering is a sensitive method for studying FtsZ polymerization and bundling of FtsZ polymers in the presence of GTP. Outputs from a typical light scattering assay are shown in Figure S4B . In these experiments, the concentration of FtsZ is above the apparent critical threshold for polymerization, which was found to be 2.5 \u00b5M in the presence of 50 mM KCl, in a pH 6.5, 50 mM MES buffer (Caplan and Erickson, 2003) . Upon the introduction of 1 mM GTP into the solution mixture, the scattering intensity increases within a narrow time interval and rapidly reaches a steady state value. Light scattering is sensitive to the presence of large aggregates and these might include linear polymers, bundled polymers, or even large spherical assemblies.\n\nWe collected samples at the mid-point of the scattering assay and performed deep etch electron microscopy imaging. A representative image for WT FtsZ is shown in Figure 4A . These images reveal the formation of linear and curved protofilaments that are roughly 100 nm long.\n\nThe light scattering data in Figure S4B were obtained in the presence of 50 mM KCl.\n\nPrevious studies showed that FtsZ can form bundled polymers and the extent of bundling is All rights reserved.

Figure 4B shows comparative light scattering traces obtained in the presence of different concentrations of KCl. The steady-state scattering intensity decreases sharply as salt concentration is increased.\n\nNegative stain EM imaging shows that the FtsZ polymers form large bundles at low salt and this bundling is disrupted at high salt ( Figure 4C ). The EM data together with the light scattering data suggest that the scattering intensity derives mainly from the bundling of FtsZ polymers, as opposed to the formation of linear polymers.\n\nNext, we studied the salt dependence of the light scattering traces obtained for CTLV4.\n\nThis variant is of interest because it maintains cellular phenotypes despite an increase of the CTT \u03ba by a factor of two when compared to the WT CTT. Like WT, we observed a canonical dependence of light scattering intensity on monovalent salt ( Figure 4D ). At high salt, the interactions that hold the bundles together are screened and CTLV4 forms unbundled polymers that are similar to those formed by WT FtsZ (Figure 4E ). Simulations predict the CTT of CTLV4 is 10% smaller than the WT CTT ( Figure 2C ). Compaction is mediated by increased electrostatic interactions between charged blocks on the CTT sequence. While the simulations illustrate charge-dependent intramolecular interactions, these interactions could also occur in an intermolecular fashion. Concordant with this expectation, we observed a two-fold increase in the peak scattering intensity in the presence of 50 mM KCl for the CTLV4 variant when compared to the WT FtsZ ( Figure 4F ). This increase in scattering intensity derives from two distinct features as revealed by negative stain EM images ( Figure 4E) . When compared to the WT FtsZ, CTLV4 forms longer polymers that become part of thicker bundles in the presence of low salt. Figure   4F shows a comparison of the relative strengths of filament / polymer bundling by comparing the maximum scattering intensities measured for the WT versus CTLV4 in the presence of three different concentrations of KCl. The major differences between the variants are manifest at low salt. However, under physiologically relevant salt concentrations, the morphological differences All rights reserved.

Therefore, while the CTT of CTLV4 can be involved in enhanced tail-mediated interactions, especially at low salt, this does not deleteriously affect polymerization or bundling of CTLV4. These data provide an explanation for the observed robustness of Z-ring formation and cell division for cells expressing CTLV4 as well as cells expressing variants CTLV2 and CTLV3.\n\nTo further assess the robustness of altering charge patterning within evolutionarily observed bounds (Figure 1D) , we quantified the comparative efficiencies of GTP hydrolysis of FtsZ variants. Figure 4G shows results from measurements that compare the efficiencies of WT FtsZ to those for CTLV4 and \u2206CTT. The latter is a variant of FtsZ that lacks the CTT. The efficiency of GTP hydrolysis remains unchanged for CTLV4 when compared to the WT FtsZ ( Figure 4G ). Higher-order assembly, such as protofilament bundling and Z-ring formation, are compromised for \u2206CTT (Buske and Levin, 2013; Sundararajan and Goley, 2017; Sundararajan et al., 2015) and we do not observe a measurable increase in light scattering that is distinguishable from the background. Despite this, we find that \u2206CTT is much more efficient as a GTPase with an enzymatic activity that is ~3 times higher than the WT or CTLV4. Taken together with the observation that GTP hydrolysis promotes the severing of protofilaments (Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus, 1998) our data suggest that \u2206CTT, as a result of being unencumbered by the absence of the CTT, is able to bind GTP, polymerize, hydrolyze GTP, disassemble and repeat the cycle in an extremely efficient manner. Accordingly, we propose that the CTT, which is essential for Z-ring formation, promotes FtsZ assembly and this suppresses GTPase activity. This suppression could arise from steric effects of the CTT, a reduction in subunit turnover, and possible protofilament stabilization through interactions with neighboring filaments mediated by the CTT.\n\nCTLV5 and CTLV6 drive alternative modes of polymerization even in the absence of GTP: Given the deleterious phenotypic impacts associated with CTLV5 and CTLV6, we All rights reserved.

We performed light scattering assays for CTLV5 and CTLV6 in the presence and absence of GTP. The light scattering data obtained in the presence of GTP show a WT-like decrease in light scattering intensity at physiological concentrations of monovalent salt ( Figure 5A ). In 50 mM KCl, CTLV5\n\nforms large linear filaments that are not bundled ( Figure 5B) . Surprisingly, even in the absence of GTP, CTLV5 forms discernible assemblies that persist at high salt concentrations ( Figure   5C ). This behavior is distinct from what we observe for WT FtsZ and CTLV4. The assemblies formed by CTLV5 in the absence of GTP are spherical aggregates that are roughly 20 nm in diameter ( Figure 5D ). Interestingly, light scattering from these assemblies that form in the absence of GTP, increases with increased salt concentration. Relative CTLV5 light scattering magnitudes for different buffer conditions are shown in Figure 5E . The increased assembly size in high salt might derive from a weakening of electrostatic repulsions amongst the surfaces of assemblies. This is clearly a CTT-mediated phenomenon given that we do not observe these assemblies for the wild-type FtsZ or for variants with lower degrees of charge segregation within their CTTs.\n\nOf the designed variants, CTLV6 has the most extreme degree of segregation of oppositely charged residues in its CTT. Increased segregation of oppositely charged residues within the CTT drives increased self-association of FtsZ via inter-tail interactions between filaments. These interactions generate profoundly different assemblies when compared to the morphologies that we observe for wild-type FtsZ or other designed variants ( Figure 5F ). The spacing between filaments corresponds to the length of a fully extended CTT. This is suggestive of zippering interactions between tails with \"blocky\" (charge-segregated) sequences. These assemblies persist at physiological salt concentrations in the presence of GTP (Figure S5A &B) ,\n\nindicating that they likely form in the cellular setting as well. At 200 mM KCl, we observe morphologies that are similar to those seen in 50 mM KCl ( Figure S5C) . We further observed a All rights reserved.

This is indicative of reduced rates of subunit turnover for assemblies formed by FtsZ variants with high \u03ba CTT sequences ( Figure S5D ).\n\nDelineating the contributions of charge patterning and amino acid composition within CTT sequences: The CTT sequences of all of the designed variants studied to this point have identical amino acid compositions that were derived from the CTT of B. subtilis FtsZ. The parameter \u03ba quantifies the extent of segregation or mixing of oppositely charged residues within the CTT and is agnostic to the specific amino acid composition. In order to separate the contributions from amino acid composition and charge patterning, we designed an FtsZ variant with a WT-like \u03ba for its CTT. However, the amino acid composition was based on a reduced amino acid alphabet. The composition of the CTT was such that all positive charges from the CTL of B. subtilis FtsZ were replaced with Arg, all negatively charged residues were replaced with Glu, Ser / Thr / Cys residues were replaced with Ser, all Asn / Gln residues were replaced with Gln, all hydrophobic groups were replaced with Ala / Val, and the numbers of Gly / Pro residues were kept intact ( Figure 6A) . The FtsZ variant with a reduced alphabet and \u03ba=0.21\n\nCTT is tolerated in B. subtilis. This variant, designated as RLWT forms robust Z-rings and grows in a wild-type manner (Figure 6B, 6C, & 6D) . However, the cellular levels were significantly lowered for FtsZ variants with reduced alphabet for their CTT sequences and \u03ba values of 0.17 (RLV1) and 0.47 (RLV5), so designated because they were intended to be mimics of CTLV1 and CTLV5 (Figure 6B ). In these cells, Z-ring formation and cellular growth are also impaired ( Figure 6C & 6D) . Cellular levels of FtsZ variants are lowered for those with reduced complexity in their CTT sequences: Measures of sequence complexity quantify the diversity of the amino acid alphabet and the complexity of the sequence syntax. For sequences of similar amino acid compositions, the sequences that cluster similar amino acids into contiguous blocks will have All rights reserved.

Sequence complexity is also lowered by using a simplified amino acid composition as we have done with the CTT sequences that are based on a reduced amino acid library. In eukaryotic systems, ubiquitinated substrates engage productively with the proteasome if and only if they have low sequence complexity tags at their termini (Kraut et al., 2012; Schrader et al., 2011) . Accordingly, we quantified the sequence complexities of each of the designed CTTs based on the WT and reduced amino acid alphabets. Here, we use the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) measure of complexity (Lempel and Ziv, 1976 ) that has been used in previous analysis of IDPs / IDRs Romero et al., 2000) . Interestingly, we find that the variants that have low cellular levels in B. subtilis (Figure 3B & 6B) also have the lowest LZ sequence complexity in their CTT sequences ( Figure 6E) . The sequence complexity of CTT sequences is lowered either by increasing or decreasing \u03ba within the CTT, for the WT amino acid composition or by using a reduced alphabet for the amino acid composition.\n\nOur analysis suggests that there is probably an evolutionary selection against FtsZ molecules with low complexity CTT sequences. This selection pressure would appear to protect against lowered cellular stability of FtsZ and tail-mediated interactions that compromise FtsZ assembly. In accord with this proposal, the LZ sequence complexity values of CTT sequences from all 1209 orthologs are higher than those of CTT sequences that engender compromised cellular stability or deleterious tail-mediated interactions ( Figure 6F) . These data lead to the hypothesis that a viable CTT sequence of FtsZ must have a CTL of sufficient amino acid complexity in order to avoid degradation, and an overall \u03ba value to ensure that the tail engages in an optimal balance of intra-and inter-molecular interactions that stabilize the polymer without compromising subunit turnover kinetics or engaging in tail-to-tail associations.\n\nIntrinsically disordered regions come in different sequence flavors (Das et al., 2015) .\n\nHowever, uncovering the connections between sequence-to-conformation relationships and the All rights reserved.

Instead, mutations have to be designed to shift conformational populations (Hilser and Thompson, 2007; Li et al., 2017) and fundamentally alter global and / or local conformational preferences (Das et al., 2015) . One can presumably build evolutionary profiles of sequences to identify regions that appear to be highly conserved and hence immutable or covarying (Rivoire et al., 2016) . Whilst such an approach would readily identify the structured regions of FtsZ, specifically the core and the CTP, as evolutionarily relevant modules, this approach is not readily transferrable to IDPs / IDRs. The CTL shows minimal sequence conservation -an attribute that is shared by many other IDPs / IDRs (Chen et al., 2006; Holehouse et al., 2017) . Thus, using a sequence alignment based approach to identify relevant modules would erroneously suggest that the CTL might either be non-essential or serve as a passive tether that is interoperable with any other randomly chosen flexible sequence tether.\n\nIn order to understand the functional roles played by the CTL, we resorted to an approach driven by sequence design that is guided by physical principles underlying the sequence-to-conformation relationships of IDRs . A similar approach was pursued to uncover the roles of functional polyampholytic IDRs in p27, an inhibitor of cyclindependent kinases in yeast (Das et al., 2016) , and the IDR within the RAM region of the Notch intracellular domain that regulates transcription of Notch genes in mammalian cells (Sherry et al., 2017) .\n\nAlthough the CTL sequence of FtsZ is poorly conserved across orthologs, the patterning of oppositely charged residues, as quantified by \u03ba is bounded within a well-defined interval Figure 1D ). These bounds are such that there is a pronounced rightward shift vis-\u00e0-vis a random distribution of \u03ba values that one would calculate for a random CTL of identical amino acid composition (Figure S2) . Our experiments show that the observed bounds on CTL / CTT \u03ba All rights reserved.

Additionally, variants of FtsZ with low complexity CTT sequences have low stability in the cellular milieu and are likely degraded by proteases. This presents at least a two-variable driving force for evolutionary selection whereby bacteria are likely to select against CTT sequences with low complexities and \u03ba values that enable aberrant tail-driven assemblies, whilst selecting for sequences that enable FtsZ polymerization and controlled GTP hydrolysis / subunit turnover.\n\nFor CTT sequences with \u03ba values that lie within the evolutionarily observed bounds, the CTTs promote lateral bundling of FtsZ filaments. These interactions are weak enough to be screened by monovalent salts such as 200 mM KCl, which is less than the basal KCl salt concentration of 350 mM in B. subtilis (Whatmore et al., 1990) . For FtsZ variants with higher \u03ba CTTs, the lateral interactions appear to have at least two distinct modes. In the presence of GTP, the tail-to-tail interactions can be weakened with monovalent salt if FtsZ molecules bind GTP and make canonical polymers. However, in the second mode of interaction, unmasked here in the absence of GTP, the salt dependence of assembly formation is inverted vis-\u00e0-vis the wild-type FtsZ, and tail-mediated interactions promote aberrant assemblies (Figure 5D & 5E) . It would appear that assemblies stabilized by tail-to-tail associations can grow larger as salt concentration increases -a feature that resembles salting-out transitions whereby proteins become insoluble at higher salt concentrations (Ruckenstein and Shulgin, 2006) .\n\nThe pathology of tail-mediated assemblies is made particularly vivid for CTLV6, which has a highly \u03ba CTT (\u03ba=0.72). The intermolecular electrostatic interactions are so strong that one observes large linear polymers with inter-polymeric \"tracks\" that are consistent with stabilization via tail-to-tail associations ( Figure 5F ). These types of strong, complimentary electrostatic interactions have also been recently reported by Borgia et al. for polyelectrolytic IDPs where oppositely charged IDPs form binary, albeit disordered high affinity complexes (Borgia et al., 2018) . Electrostatic attractions can also drive phase transitions via complex coacervation as All rights reserved.

The driving forces for phase separation increase multi-fold for variants of NICD with long blocks of charged residues. Similar results were observed by altering the patterning of oppositely charged residues within the IDR of DDX4, a protein that forms nuage bodies (Nott et al., 2015) . Theories show that the driving forces for phase separation become stronger and the salt dependence becomes weaker with increased separation of charged residues (Chang et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2016 Lin et al., , 2018 . Taken together our results suggest that the lack of CTL sequences above and below the thresholds shown in Figure 1C derives from a combination of considerations including maintaining FtsZ concentrations within the cell and minimizing tail-totail associations that lead to strong albeit aberrant multivalent interactions amongst segregated blocks of charge within CTTs.\n\nDeletion of the FtsZ CTT leads to a 3-fold increase in GTPase activity. Thus, the CTT plays an auto-inhibitory role by promoting polymerization and lowering the efficiency of GTP hydrolysis. In this way, although GTP binding is required to promote canonical FtsZ polymerization, the hydrolysis of GTP provides the energy required to bend / deform FtsZ polymers to form Z-rings. Preliminary atomistic simulations of the CTT tethered to the FtsZ core show that the CTP motif makes fluctuating patterns of contacts with the T7 activation loop of the FtsZ core (data not shown). We propose that in addition to stabilizing the protofilaments and reducing subunit turnover by lowering the GTPase activity, the CTL may also enable inhibitory interactions between the CTP and the active site of the enzyme. This auto-inhibition could further reduce the GTPase activity and promote polymerization by weakening the dissociation of FtsZ subunits. Similar auto-inhibitory roles have been ascribed to disordered tails that are tethered to ordered domains in a range of different systems (Trudeau et al., 2013) .\n\nRecently, Petrovska et al. also showed that metabolic enzymes in yeast form filaments under conditions of stress as a strategy to inactivate these enzymes (Petrovska et al., 2014) .

No reuse allowed without permission.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/301622 doi: bioRxiv preprint Our findings are complimentary to those of Petrovska et al. inasmuch as filament formation weakens GTPase activity of FtsZ ( Figure 4G) . However, in the bacterial context, the weakening of enzymatic activity ensures robust FtsZ polymerization, which provides the basis for ring formation and serves as a generator of multivalency of CTP motifs that helps coordinate membrane anchoring and a network of interactions with effector proteins and regulatory molecules. The overall picture that emerges is of a multi-functional, multi-purpose CTT with definable features appear to govern the evolution of its amino acid sequence. The sequence complexity has to be sufficiently high vis-\u00e0-vis a random control to ensure cellular stability of FtsZ. The CTT has to enable auto-regulatory functions of suppressing GTP hydrolysis by promoting polymerization in the presence of GTP (Figure 7) . It is worth noting that polymers of FtsZ will be defined by a multivalency of CTP motifs. From a functional standpoint, this should provide the basis for membrane anchoring and mediating a full complement of protein-protein interactions. As far as cell division and cell growth are concerned, the intra-CTT sequence segregation of oppositely charged residues cannot cross a defined threshold value. If this threshold value is crossed, then the regulatory tail-mediated interactions can be overwhelmed by GTP-independent tail-to-tail interactions. These strong tail-mediated will promote alternative assemblies that compromise canonical FtsZ polymerization and Z-ring formation while conferring a dominant negative phenotype.\n\nA defining feature of canonical FtsZ polymers that form in the presence of GTP and apparently aberrant tail-driven assemblies that form in the absence of GTP is the multivalency of CTT sequences. Whilst canonical FtsZ polymers may be thought of as bottlebrushes with CTTs forming the polymer brushes (Figure 7) , the spherical aggregates may be thought of as inverted versions of \"hairy spherical colloids\" (Lindenblatt et al., 2001) (Figure 7) with the CTTs forming electrostatically stabilized cores and the FtsZ cores making up the corona, although this hypothesis needs to be tested experimentally.

It is worth noting that the bacterial cytoplasm has been shown to form structured glasses (Parry et al., 2014) , which would involve physical crosslinking i.e., gelation of multivalent molecules. We conjecture that the multivalency engendered by polymerization of molecules such as FtsZ with their folded cores and disordered tails might drive the gelation and / or glass-like properties of the bacterial cytoplasm.\n\nOur findings suggest that the CTT / CTL encoded effects cannot be too weak (low \u03ba) or too strong (\u03ba > 0.4); instead, they have to be just right because the CTT plays multiple regulatory roles. In addition, the sequence complexity of the CTT also has to be above a threshold value to ensure protein stability in the cellular setting. We refer to this combination of requirements as a \"Goldilocks precept\" for the evolution of sequence features within IDPs / IDRs. Similar results have been uncovered from a deep mutational scan of the transactivation domain of Gcn4, which is an essential transcription factor in yeast (Staller et al., 2018) . Our investigations open the door for systematic high-throughput experiments guided by recent computational advances (Harmon et al., 2016) that enable the design of CTT sequences with bespoke sequence complexities, lengths, amino acid compositions, and charge patterning.\n\nThese methods can be applied to other GTPases with N-and C-terminal IDRs of GTPases in order to uncover the robustness of the Goldilocks precept that appears to underlie the evolutionary selection of IDPs / IDRs.\n\nGeneral methods: B. subtilis strains expressing CTL variants of FtsZ were derived from PAL 2084 and were grown in 0.5% xylose to induce wild-type expression or 0.1 mM IPTG to induce CTL variant expression.

All restriction enzymes were ordered from New England Biolabs. All genomic DNA extractions were performed using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega). Plasmid preparations were made using the NucleoSpin Plasmid Kit (Macherey-Negel). Gel/PCR purifications were performed using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (Macherey-Negel). T4 DNA ligase was used for ligations (New England Biolabs).\n\nThe CTL variant strains were constructed as described previously (Buske and Levin, 2013) . The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1 of the supplemental material. Synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides of the CTL variants were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies, digested using restriction enzymes, and ligated into pPJ19, which contains FtsZ, under the control of the Pspac promoter that is inducible with 0.1 mM IPTG, with restriction sites flanking the CTL. A BamHI site after amino acid 315 and a XmaI site before residue 366 result in the insertion of amino acid pairs GS and PG N-and C-terminal to the CTL, respectively. The plasmid was transformed into PAL 644, a strain of E. coli derived from PAL930. PAL 644 contains the low copy plasmid pBS58 expressing E. coli ftsQAZ, which allows the sub-cloning of B. subtilis FtsZ. FtsZ was amplified in pPJ19, the product of which was restriction digested, purified, and ligated into pDR67. The multiple cloning site in the vector pDR67 contains the 5'-and 3'-ends of the amyE gene on either side, which allows the insertion of FtsZ into the amyE locus by homologous recombination.\n\nThe purified plasmid was transformed into PAL 522, a derivative of the JH642 wild-type strain of B. subtilis. Genomic DNA was purified and transformed into MEO 1, a derivative of PAL 2084 containing a copy of wild-type FtsZ under the control of the Pxyl promoter, inducible with 0.5% xylose. The cells were made competent and transformed with purified genomic DNA from PAL 2084, which knocks out the chromosomal WT copy of FtsZ. Plasmids were verified by restriction digests and sequencing.

For WT and CTLV4, bundling decreases as salt concentration increases. (G) Comparative assessments of GTPase activity -normalized to the WT FtsZ -for CTLV4 and \u2206CTT. Polymerization weakens the GTPase activity and this auto-inhibition derives from the presence of the tail. This point is made by comparing the efficiencies of GTP hydrolysis for CTLV4 and \u2206CTT to that of the WT FtsZ. The efficiencies are shown normalized to that of WT. Absence of the CTT leads to an enzyme that almost three times more efficient as a GTPase when compared to the WT or CTLV4.

Polymerization and bundling increases the effective valence of the CTP, shown in pink. In the absence of GTP, FtsZ subunits exist primarily as monomers and small oligomers. As CTT \u03ba is increased above 0.4, the interactions amongst CTTs alter the FtsZ assembly mechanism. In the presence of GTP, high \u03ba FtsZ variants form large linear polymers that become laterally zippered through stable CTT-CTT interactions, forming a train track-like morphology thereby inhibiting GTP hydrolysis and slowing down subunit turnover. In the absence of GTP, FtsZ interactions amongst CTTs lead to the formation of spherical assemblies that are stabilized in higher salt concentrations.\n\nEvolved sequence features within the intrinsically disordered tail influence FtsZ assembly and bacterial cell division Megan C.

Pappu Figure S1 : Naturally occurring sequences with an FCR \u2248 0.3 have a more positive \u03ba value than would be expected by random chance. We identified all predicted IDRs from the human protein within the bounds 0.27 < FCR < 0.33 that were thirty residues or more in length (4755 IDRs). For each IDR, we calculated the expected \u03ba (\u27e8\u03ba\u27e9) value associated with a sequence of that composition in the absence of any selective pressure performing multiple random shuffles and assessing the mean value. Finally, for each naturally occurring IDR (WT), we calculated the \u0394\u03ba, where \u0394\u03ba = \u03ba WT -\u27e8\u03ba\u27e9. If \u0394\u03ba > 0 then the naturally occurring sequence has a higher \u03ba than The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/301622 doi: bioRxiv preprint S2 expected, while if \u0394\u03ba < 0 the naturally occurring sequence has a lower \u03ba than would be expected, and the distribution of \u0394\u03ba was plotted as the red curve. The same analysis was performed for randomly shuffled sequences instead of naturally occurring sequences to assess the intrinsic variance in the data, as shown in the black curve. Many sequences showed a bias for higher than expected \u03ba values, although a small number of sequences showed a bias for lower than expected \u03ba values. Figure S2 : Naturally occurring FtsZ CTT sequences are biased towards larger \u03ba than expected by random chance. We calculated the \u03ba value associated with 1209 orthologous FtsZ CTT sequences. The associated distribution of \u03ba values is shown in blue. For each sequence, we then shuffled the sequence multiple times to generate a set of randomly permuted CTT sequences.

Figure S4 : FtsZ forms protofilaments and polymerization is sensitive to the presence of GTP. (A) FtsZ is a GTPase whose active site is formed by the interface between two FtsZ monomers. The cartoon representation, generated using the VMD software package, is based on the coordinates for FtsZ dimers obtained from the protein data bank (PDB id: 2vxy). In each subunit, residues that make up the GTP binding site are colored in red whereas residues that make up the T7 activation loop are colored in yellow.
