{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Spatial transmission of COVID-19 via public and private transportation in China Spatial transmission of COVID-19 via public and private transportation in China", "body": "Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province with a population of more than 11 million people, is the largest city and the most important traffic hub in Central China. Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hit the Wuhan city [1] . The time of the outbreak coincided with the Chinese Spring Festival, when the largest annual population movement began. Before the lockdown on January 23 rd , an estimated 5 million residents left Wuhan [2] . The infected people in incubation period had brought the virus to other cities and person-to-person transmission of the new coronavirus caused the spread of infections across the country.\n\nUp until February 9 th , there have been 330 cities in addition to Wuhan with reported confirmed COVID-19 cases in mainland China (figure A). In the study of Zhao et al., they found significant association between travel by train and spread of COVID-19 infections, but not for travelling by car and flight [3] . In order to evaluate the role of public transportation in the spatial transmission of COVID-19, we searched daily flights, buses, and trains from Wuhan to these cities in January (https://www.ctrip.com). The figure shows destinations and frequencies of these flights (B), buses (C) and trains (D) from Wuhan. We also obtained straight line distances between Wuhan and these cities (https://map.baidu.com) and excluded those \u22651500 km to avoid outlier effects. The daily number and the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in each city were obtained from the official website (http://health.people.com.cn/GB/26466/431463/431576/index.html) with real-time updates at 12:00 pm on each day since January 24 th . All the data were logarithmically transformed and the Pearson\u00b4s correlation analysis was used to examine correlations of daily frequencies of each transportation methods and the distance between Wuhan and other cities, with the daily 4 number and the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases.\n\nWe found a significant and positive association between the frequency of flights, trains, and buses from Wuhan and the daily as well as the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in other cities with progressively increased correlations for trains and buses (all P values < 0.001) (figures E, F). The distance between Wuhan and other cities was inversely associated with the numbers of COVID-19 cases in that city (all P values < 0.001), and the correlation became increasingly stronger and went stable after February 1 st . The mean incubation period was estimated to be 5.2 days [1] , therefore real associations appeared after most infected cases out from Wuhan presented typical symptoms and were diagnosed [4] . "}
