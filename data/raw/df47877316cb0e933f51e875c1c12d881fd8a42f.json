{"title": "", "body": "Bovine trichomoniasis is a veneral disease caused by the protozoal pathogen Tritrichomonas foetus and is considered to be one of the most important infectious causes of reproductive failure in beef cattle drastically reducing their breeding efficiency [1e4] . The infection in bulls is primarily acquired through direct sexual contact and is asymptomatic in nature affecting neither the semen quality nor the sexual behaviour although in some cases, early death of developing foetus has also been observed [5e7] . Literature rationale has also revealed that the parasite provoked cell death to bovine oviduct epithelial cells [8] and extracellular products secreted by T. foetus were cytotoxic to bovine sperm [9] . Although the use of artificial insemination in breeding cattle has led to the virtual eradication of this organism from the cattle population in many countries, bovine trichomonad infection still is responsible for significant economic losses in the free-ranging cattle industry around the world. In light of this current problem, the identification of new chemotherapies for this pathogen is still warranted.\n\nIsatin is a versatile scaffold with wide possibility of chemical modification and display a diverse array of biological and pharmacological activities which include anti-HIV [10] , antiviral [11] , anti-tumour [12e14], antifungal [15, 16] , anti-angiogenic [17] , anticonvulsants [18] , anti-Parkinson's disease therapeutic [19] , and effective SARS coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitor [20] . An extensive investigation on the synthetic versatility of isatin has disclosed many interesting aspects of organic synthesis allowing the generation of a large number of structurally diverse analogues derived from electrophilic aromatic substitution at positions C-5 and C-7 of the phenyl ring, nucleophilic additions onto the C-3 carbonyl group, chemoselective reductions, oxidations, ring-expansions, and spiroannulations [21] . However there are only few reports regarding the antineoplastic activities of N-alkyl and N-aryl isatins. Vine and coworkers have reported the apoptosis behaviour of N-alkyl/aryl isatins through introduction of various hydrophobic substituents like N-phenethyl, N-benzyl and N-2-naphthylmethyl on the parent nucleus that significantly increased their cytotoxicity towards lymphoma cells and against a wide range of human cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cells and U937 human monocyte-like histolytic lymphoma cells [22] . Recent report from our lab has shown the synthesis of N-alkylisatin along with their cytotoxic profiles against a panel of cancer cell lines [23] . The approach has been further extended towards the synthesis of 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered isatin conjugates with four of the synthesized scaffolds being twice as potent as 5-fluorouracil on THP-1 cell line [24] .\n\nIn continuation with our interest towards the synthesis of novel molecular frameworks having biological relevance [25], we recently disclosed the synthesis of 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered isatin-b-lactam conjugates along with the preliminary analysis of their in vitro activity against Trichomonas vaginalis at 10 and 100 mM [26] . Eighteen of the synthesized hybrids have shown 100% growth inhibition at 100 mM with the most potent and non-cytotoxic compound showing and IC 50 of 7.69 mM. The methodology was further extended towards the synthesis of b-amino alcohol based blactameisatin conjugates and their evaluation against T. vaginalis at 50 mM with the most active chimeric scaffold among the test series exhibited an IC 50 of 9.73 mM along with low cytotoxicity [27] . As an extension of this work, we now describes the Cu(I)Cl-facilitated synthesis of N-propargylated-isatin Mannich adducts along with their preliminary in vitro evaluation studies against the veterinary protozoal pathogen T. foetus and cytotoxicity against human prostate (PC-3) cancer cell line.\n\nThe synthetic approach devised for the synthesis of desired hybrids involved sodium hydride promoted initial propagylation of C-5 substituted isatins 1 with propargyl bromide in dry DMF to yield 2. This upon refluxing at 110 C in dry dioxane with secondary amines and para-formaldehyde in the presence of catalytic amount of Cu(I)Cl resulted in the isolation of desired N-propargylated-isatin Mannich adducts. Mechanistically, the reaction is thought to proceed by an initial formation of Cu-acetylide I which undergoes Mannich addition as shown in Scheme 1. Interestingly, the reaction employing piperazine as the secondary amine unit resulted in the isolation of bis-adduct formed via an initial condensation reaction of piperazine with para-formaldehyde at 1st and 4th position to result in the corresponding bis-iminium ion with subsequent Mannich addition.\n\nThe developed methodology has been further extended towards the synthesis of N-propargylated isatin-7-chloroquinoline hybrids via Cu-mediated Mannich reaction of C-5 substituted N-propargylated isatins with 7-chloro-4-piperazin-1-yl-quinoline 6, prepared by heating 4,7-dichloroquinoline with an excess of piperazine and triethylamine at 120 C overnight Scheme 2. The inclusion of 7- chloroquinoline nucleus in the synthesized conjugates is based on the recent disclosure by Dwivedi and co-workers on the promising activity of the quinoline based compounds against different strains of T. vaginalis [28] .\n\nThe structure to the synthesized Mannich adducts were assigned on the basis of spectral data and analytical evidences. The compound 3d, for example was characterized as 1-(4-Morpholine-4-yl-but-2-ynyl)-1H-2-indole-2,3-dione analysed for C 16 \n\nThe synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antitrichomonas activity against the veterinary protozoal pathogen T.\n\nfoetus at 50 mM and the results are provided in Table 1 . As evident from Table 1 , the anti-trichomonas activity of the test compounds were found to be dependent upon the nature of substituent at C-5 position as well as the presence of nature of secondary amine. The presence of a eCH 3 substituent at C-5 position of isatin ring of the synthesized Mannich adducts considerably improved the activity profile as evident by compounds 3ae3p and 5ae5d. Further, the introduction of 7-chloro-4-piperazin-1-yl-quinoline moiety remarkably improved the anti-trichomonas activity with a preference for halogen substituent at C-5 position of isatin ring. The most potent of the synthesized hybrids 7b and 7c showing 100% growth inhibition at 50 mM. The active compounds viz. 7a, 7b and 7c from the preliminary inhibition data were chosen in order to determine their IC 50 which is the minimum concentration required for 50% growth inhibition and the results are tabulated in Table 2 . As evident from Table 2 , although the synthesized conjugates are not as active as the standard drug metronidazole, the compounds showed potent activity against the veterinary protozoal pathogen T. foetus. The compound 7c having a chloro-substituent at C-5 position of the isatin ring proved to be the most potent of the synthesized scaffolds with an IC 50 of 11.3 mM. The synthesized compounds were further evaluated for their cytotoxicity against human prostate (PC-3) cancer cell lines in order to confirm if the observed activity profiles are because of their intrinsic anti-trichomonas activity or the cytotoxicity. The cytotoxic evaluation results of the test compounds at 0.2, 2.0 and 20 mM are enlisted in Table 1 . As evident, virtually all the synthesized Mannich adducts are devoid of cytotoxicity except 5a and 5f, showing that the bis-adducts were cytotoxic against PC-3 cell lines compared to the mono-adducts. The most potent anti-trichomonas scaffolds viz. 7a, 7b, 7c and 7d showed no cytotoxicity against PC-3 cell line and can be considered as a good hit.\n\nIn conclusion, the present manuscript describes the Cu(I)Cl promoted N-propargylated-isatin-Mannich mono-as well as bisadducts with an extension towards the synthesis of N-propargylated-isatin-7-chloroquinoline conjugates. The synthesized scaffolds were evaluated for their activity against veterinary protozoal pathogen T. foetus. The preliminary evaluation data revealed that the introduction of 7-chloroquinoline ring markedly enhanced the activity profiles with the most active compound 7c exhibiting an IC 50 of 11.3 mM. The cytotoxic studies against human prostate (PC-3) cell lines showed that the synthesized Mannich adducts are virtually devoid of any cytotoxicity and the isatin-7-chloroquinoline framework can act as an ideal starting point for the synthesis of new pharmacological templates against T. foetus.\n\nMelting points were determined by open capillary using Veego Precision Digital Melting Point apparatus (MP-D) and are uncorrected. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded in deuterochloroform and DMSO-d 6 with Jeol 300 (300 MHz) spectrometers using TMS as internal standard.
