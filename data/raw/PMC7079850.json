{"title": "Development of a monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the analysis of glycyrrhizic acid", "body": "Licorice root has been a herbal medicine in China for over a thousand years. It is commonly used in Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) and Chinese proprietary medicines (CPMs). Glycyrrhizic acid (GL) (Fig. 1a) is a major active compound and a quality control marker of licorice root. It has anti-viral [1, 2], anti-inflammatory [3], anti-carcinogenesis [4, 5], anti-hepatitis [6\u20138], anti-thrombotic [9], and immunomodulatory [10] activities. Its antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus has recently been demonstrated in vitro [11, 12]. GL is also used as food additive and masking agent in pharmaceutical products because of its sweet taste (170 times sweeter than sucrose) [13].\n\n\n\nThe content of GL in the licorice roots varies considerably with strains, cultivars, growing regions, climatic conditions, and harvest age. The quality of the raw herbs used in the CPMs affects the final therapeutic outcomes and consumer safety. An effective method is needed to screen large numbers of licorice root samples for the quality control. Existing methods for the determination of GL include high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [14, 15], liquid chromatography\u2013ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-ITMS) [16], capillary electrophoresis [17], near-infrared spectroscopy [18], immunosensor [19], immunoassay [13, 20\u201322], and micellar electrokinetic chromatography [23]. Compared to conventional instrumental methods, immunoassay is a rapid and sensitive method which needs small quantities of test materials and simple pretreatments. There are reports of ELISAs based on monoclonal antibody (MAb) against GL [13, 24]. The MAb was obtained from GL\u2013BSA synthesized by the NaIO4 method. The ELISA reported by Mizutani et al. [13] had a detect range of 20\u2013200 ng mL\u22121. Here, we report a new ultra-sensitive and specific immunoassay by using a new GL MAb. A conventional indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) and a simplified icELISA were developed for the determination of GL in different licorice samples.\n\nGlycyrrhizic acid (99% purity) and glycyrrhetic acid (99% purity) were purchased from Tauto Biotech Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Cell culture media (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium, DMEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Gibco BRL (PaisLey, Scotland). Reagents purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA) were cell freezing medium\u2014DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) (serum-free), hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT), hypoxanthine and thymidine (HT) medium supplements, L-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (GAM\u2013HRP), complete and incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant, N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin (OVA), and o-phenylenediamine (OPD). Poly(ethene glycol) (PEG)-2000 was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Methanol and acetic acid of chromatography gradient grade were purchased from Fisher Scientific (New Jersey, USA). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade.\n\nCell culture plates and 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates were purchased form Costar (Corning, NY, USA). An automated plate washer (Wellwash 4 MK2), a microplate reader (Multiskan MK3), and direct heat CO2 incubator were purchased from Thermo (Vantaa, Finland). Syringe filters (25 mm, 0.2 \u03bcm, and 0.45 \u03bcm pore size, Acrodisc) and filter unit (Acrocap) were purchased from Pall (Ann Arbor, USA). An electric heating constant-temperature incubator was purchased from Tianjin Zhonghuan Experiment Electric Stove Co. Ltd. (Tianjin, China).\n\nThe following solutions were used: (i) coating buffer (0.05 M carbonate buffer, pH 9.6); (ii) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.5); (iii) PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (PBST); (iv) PBST containing 0.5% (w/v) gelatin (PBSTG); (v) citrate-phosphate buffer (0.01 M citric acid and 0.03 M Na2HPO4, pH 5.5); (vi) substrate solution (4 \u03bcL of 30% H2O2 added to 10 mL citrate-phosphate buffer containing 2 mg mL\u22121 OPD); and (vii) a stop solution (2 M H2SO4).\n\nGL\u2013BSA and GL\u2013OVA conjugates were prepared via the active ester method as an immunogen and coating antigen, respectively. DCC (150 mg) was added to a stirring mixture of GL (80 mg) and NHS (40 mg) in 3 mL DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide). The mixture was stirred for 4 h at 4 \u00b0C and centrifuged. The supernatant was added dropwise to protein solution (150 mg BSA or OVA in 12 mL carbonate buffer, 50 mM, pH 9.6), and the solution was stirred overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against five changes of PBS for 5 days and stored lyophilized at \u221220 \u00b0C. The hapten density in the GL\u2013BSA was determined by UV spectroscopy. The hapten to BSA molar ratio was 5:1.\n\nFive Balb/c female mice (6\u20137 weeks old) were injected subcutaneously with 0.1 mg GL\u2013BSA conjugate dissolved in 0.1 mL PBS mixed with 0.1 mL Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant. Two subsequent injections were carried out at 1-week intervals using Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant. One week after the third injections, mice were eye-bled and sera were tested for anti-GL antibody titer and for GL recognition properties in icELISA. Three days after the last injection in adjuvant, mouse with the highest titer and best specificity was boosted intraperitoneally with 0.1 mg GL\u2013BSA conjugate in 0.1 mL PBS and was used for the fusion. The spleen cells collected from the mouse were fused with the SP2/0 (obtained from China Institute of Veterinary Drug Control, Beijing, China) cell line using PEG-2000 at a ratio of 10:1 of spleen to myeloma cells. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2 in air). Selective growth of the hybrid cells in the DMEM supplemented with HAT. Seven days after fusion, the supernatant was tested by icELISA. Positive hybridomas were cloned by limiting dilution and clones were further selected by icELISA.\n\nThe clone, designated as 8F8A8H42H7, having a high antibody titer and good sensitivity in the culture supernatant was expanded in mice for production of MAb in ascites. The antibody was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by affinity chromatography on a HiTrap Protein G HP affinity column (HiTrap, Amersham, USA). The immunoglobulin isotype was determined with a mouse antibody isotyping kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The assay cross-reactivity with glycyrrhetic acid (Fig. 1b) and the affinity of MAb 8F8A8H42H7 to GL were determined with the conventional icELISA.\n\nIn all the procedures, microtiter plates were washed on an automated plate washer with 250 \u03bcL PBS or PBST per well for four times. A microtiter plate was first coated with 200 \u03bcL hapten\u2013OVA in coating buffer per well for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C. After four washes with PBS, each well was blocked with 200 \u03bcL 3% non-fat dry milk in PBS for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. After the plate was washed with PBST, 100 \u03bcL aliquots of various concentrations of the standard in PBSTG were pipetted into each well followed by addition of 100 \u03bcL sera, supernatant, or purified MAb solution diluted in PBSTG. The plate was then incubated for 0.5 h at 37 \u00b0C. The unbound antibody was removed by washing the plates four times with PBST, and then 200 \u03bcL goat anti-mouse IgG\u2013peroxidase conjugate in PBSTG was added to each well followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 0.5 h. After the plate was washed with PBST again, 200 \u03bcL substrate solution per well was added. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 \u03bcL 2 M H2SO4 per well. Absorbance was read at 492 nm in the microplate reader.\n\nThe washing step and the buffers used in the simplified icELISA were the same as that of the conventional icELISA. Briefly, a microtiter plate was first coated with 200 \u03bcL hapten\u2013OVA per well for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C. Each well was blocked with 200 \u03bcL 3% non-fat dry milk in PBS for 0.5 h at 37 \u00b0C. After the plate had been washed with PBST, 20 \u03bcL of the standard in PBSTG was pipetted into each well followed by the addition of 90 \u03bcL goat anti-mouse IgG\u2013peroxidase conjugate and 90 \u03bcL purified MAb solution in PBSTG. The plate was then incubated for 0.5 h at 37 \u00b0C. The substrate solution was added at 200 \u03bcL per well followed by the addition of 100 \u03bcL 2 M H2SO4 to stop the reaction. Absorbance was read at 492 nm on the microplate reader.\n\nThe root samples of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch were collected to a maximum depth of 91 cm. The above-ground caudex and leaflets of the cultivated licorice were collected. All samples were air-dried before being finely powdered.\n\nThe samples were extracted by the method of Shan et al. [22]. The sample of root, caudex, and leaflets materials (10 mg) was extracted with 1 mL methanol under sonication for five times and centrifuged at 7,000 g for 2 min. The supernatant was collected and transferred into a 50 mL volumetric flask. The distilled water was added up to a total of 50 mL to provide the real sample stock solution. The solution was divided into two equal aliquots. One aliquot was detected in the conventional and simplified icELISA after dilution with distilled water. The dilution ratio was 5,000 and 500 for the conventional icELISA and simplified icELISA, respectively. The other aliquot was lyophilized. The resultant residue was dissolved in 0.5 mL of a mixture of methanol/30% acetic acid/water (73:5:22, v/v/v), i.e., the mobile phase, and filtered with a Millipore membrane. The filtered solution was used for analysis by HPLC.\n\nThe HPLC apparatus consisted of a Waters (Milford, MA, USA) 600E multisolvent delivery system and a Waters 2487 dual \u03bb absorbance detector. All modules and data collection were controlled by Waters Millennium32 software. The analytical column was a Zorbax (Agilent Technologies, Massy, France) SB-C18 (150\u00d74.6 mm i.d.; 5 \u03bcm). The mobile phase was filtered through Millipore nylon filters and degassed by sonication (SB5200, Branson, Shanghai, China) prior to use. Separations were carried out at ambient temperature with a flow rate of 1 mL min\u22121 and a 20 \u03bcL injection loop. Quantitative analyses were carried out at a wavelength of 254 nm.\n\nThe titer (the serum dilution that gave an absorbance of 1.0 in the noncompetitive assay conditions) of the ascites was 2\u20134\u00d7104. The dissociation constant (K\nd) of the MAb (designated as 8F8A8H42H7) was determined with the method of Bertrand et al. [26]. The K\nd value was 9.96\u00d710\u221210 M. The MAb is a IgG1 isotype that has \u03bb light chains.\n\nTwo icELISA formats were optimized. The coating antigen (0.5 mg mL\u22121), purified MAb (2.0 mg mL\u22121), and anti-mouse IgG\u2013peroxidase conjugate (1 mg mL\u22121) were at a dilution ratio of 1:2,000, 1:4,000, and 1:1,000 and 1:1,000, 1:1,000, and 1:250 for the conventional icELISA and the simplified icELISA, respectively. The inhibit curves of the conventional icELISA and simplified icELISA (Fig. 2) were established. The IC50 values were 1.1 ng mL\u22121 and 5.3 ng mL\u22121, and the detection ranges were 0.2\u20135.1 ng mL\u22121 and 1.2\u201323.8 ng mL\u22121 for the conventional icELISA and simplified icELISA, respectively. MAb 8F8A8H42H7 in the conventional icELISA format had a low cross reactivity (2.6%) with glycyrrhetic acid.\n\n\n\nTen licorice samples were analyzed with the conventional icELISA, simplified icELISA, and HPLC (Table 1). The results obtained from icELISAs agreed well with those obtained from the HPLC analysis. The correlation coefficients were 0.9844 (y = 0.9612x + 0.1498) between HPLC and the conventional icELISA and 0.9983 (y = 1.0368x\u22120.0918) between HPLC and the simplified icELISA. There was no significant difference among the results obtained from the three methods for each sample. \n\n\n\nThe GL content in various licorice roots differs considerably and is higher in the roots of wild strains than in cultivated licorice. The GL content in licorice roots generally increases as the growth age prolongs within the five-year life with which our results agree. The above-ground caudex and leaflets contained too low levels of GL to be detectable in HPLC.\n\nGlycyrrhizic acid is a marker of quality for Glycyrrhiza materials. Mizutani et al. [13] reported a MAb-based ELISA for the analysis of GL. The immunogen was synthesized by the NaIO4 method. The polysaccharide residue in the glucuronic acid molecules is specifically oxidized at adjacent hydroxyl residues leaving reactive aldehyde groups. Reductive animation proceeds between the aldehyde group(s) and free amino group(s) of the protein. In our study, the MAb was derived with an immunogen (GL\u2013BSA) conjugated by the active ester method. The two new icELISAs are approximately 20- to 100-fold more sensitive than that reported by Mizutani et al. [13]. The results showed that our immunogen evoked a high-quality antibody against GL.\n\nThree of four hybrid clones which secreted anti-GL MAb in the previous report showed more than 18% cross reactivity with glycyrrhetinic acid [22], whereas, MAb 8F8A8H42H7 showed only 2.6% cross reactivity. In general, there is some correlation between the position in the hapten molecule used for the conjugation to carrier protein and the recognition of epitopes on the hapten by the prepared antibodies. The epitopes distant from the site of conjugation tend to be well recognized by antibodies, whereas epitopes neighboring the coupling site tend to be less well recognized [27]. There are three carboxyl groups in the GL molecule. Thus, it is proposed that the carboxyl group in its aglycon, but not the carboxyl groups in the two glucuronic acid molecules, was connected with the free amino group on the carrier protein (Fig. 1c). However, the hypothesis needs further study to be verified.\n\nThe two icELISAs can be used to control the quality of raw licorice materials. The results obtained from the two icELISAs were in a good agreement with those from the HPLC analysis. The advantages of the icELISAs over the HPLC method are mainly that they are rapid, sensitive, cost-effective, and allow large sample throughput. However, the simplified icELISA consumes more reagents such as coating antigen and goat anti-mouse IgG\u2013peroxidase than the conventional icELISA.\n\nThe GL content varied remarkably in different licorice samples. The different quality of crude licorice roots used in CPMs surely results in inconsistency of the clinical effectiveness. The analysis data indicated wild and 3- to 5-year-old cultivated licorice roots possess higher quality than 1- to 2-year-old cultivated licorice roots. In China, farmers usually harvest 3-year-old licorice roots. Our results suggest that the cultivation system is reasonable."}
