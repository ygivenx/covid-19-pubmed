{"title": "RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF RHINOTHERMY FOR TREATMENT OF THE COMMON COLD RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF RHINOTHERMY FOR TREATMENT OF THE COMMON COLD", "body": "Strengths and limitations of this study:\n\n\u2022 This is the first study investigating the use of rhinothermy delivered via high flow nasal cannulae for the treatment of the common cold\n\n\u2022 This open-label randomised placebo-controlled feasibility study shows that an RCT of rhinothermy compared with vitamin C in the treatment of the common cold is feasible.\n\n\u2022 A five unit change in modified Jackson score has been estimated to represent the threshold for substantial clinical benefit.\n\n\u2022 Although this study showed clinically and statistically significant benefits from rhinothermy, this finding should be considered with caution, as this was a feasibility study in which efficacy was not the primary outcome measure.\n\n\u2022 A robust adequately powered RCT is needed, particularly as this feasibility study identified that rhinothermy improved symptoms of the common cold compared with control. Steam inhalation for symptom relief is a traditional remedy for the common cold. There is a scientific rationale for this treatment because HRV is a temperature sensitive virus with temperature-dependent reduction in viral replication between 33 Study limitations include variable, and likely ineffective, methods of delivering heated humid air at high flow to the upper airways. These methods include delivery through nozzles held a distance away from the nares and vented anaesthetic masks. The reported intervention durations were also variable. A Cochrane Review assessed that the current evidence could not support or refute effectiveness and recommended that there is a need for robustly designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effectiveness of rhinothermy to treat the common cold.\n\n[22]\n\nWe have reported a tolerability study which found that a high flow nasal cannula device (myAIRVO 2, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) modified to deliver high flow humidified air at 41\u00b0C via wide bore nasal cannulae was well tolerated in healthy volunteers.\n\n[27] The potential advantage of this device for rhinothermy is that it can deliver a consistent temperature, humidity and flow rate direct into the upper airways. The study reported here is a feasibility study of rhinothermy in the treatment of the common cold that will inform the design of a robust RCT of this treatment. The specific aims of the feasibility study were to:\n\n1. To estimate the proportions of potential participants after screening who undergo randomisation, and who then complete the study, in turn providing an estimate of the time and resources required to undertake an RCT. All participants were requested to complete a symptom diary every day for 10 days. The diary comprised a daily modified Jackson score questionnaire and a box to tick when they first felt \"a lot better\" compared to study entry. The mean change in modified Jackson score when participants felt \"a lot better\" was used to estimate the MCID.\n\nAll participants returned to the clinic for a second and final visit after day 10 and returned their symptom diary. Participants who used myAIRVO 2 returned the device and were asked to fill in a tolerability questionnaire about their experience. There were nine questions, with participants recording their answer on a continuous scale from most positive (0) to least positive (100). The questions were about: 1) the teaching session; 2) connecting the components; 3) cleaning process; 4) level of comfort; 5) amount of moisture from the device; 6) weight of the nasal interface; 7) noisiness; 8) applying and removing the nasal interface; and 9) the likelihood of reusing it in the future. Compliance data from the myAIRVO 2 was uploaded and analysed.\n\nThe primary outcome measure was the proportion of recruits who were randomised. Other outcome measures included i) Proportion of randomised participants who completed the study;\n\nii) Mean and SD of the modified Jackson scores from randomisation to 10 days after initiation of the randomised regimen; iii) Time until feeling \"a lot better\" compared to study entry; iv) Time \n\nA sample size of 30 was chosen to:\n\n1. Assess the proportion of screened participants who were randomised into the trial. If a minimum of 60 patients were approached, assuming a recruitment rate of 50% or less, an achieved participation of 30 participants has 80% power, one sided alpha of 5% to rule out a recruitment rate of less than 34%.\n\n2. Estimate the SD of the change from baseline modified Jackson score. A sample size of at least 25 has acceptable precision to estimate a SD based on a Chi-square distribution.\n\nThe recruitment and completion rates confidence intervals were estimated by the Clopper-Pearson exact method. Mixed linear models with an exponential-in-time covariance matrix were used to estimate the differences in modified Jackson scores by treatment and time. A post hoc interaction term tested if the response differed by whether the nasal swab results was positive or not. The confidence interval for the SD for the change from baseline modified Jackson score was estimated using a Chi-square distribution. Logistic regression was used to estimate Receiver Operating Characteristic curves for the probability of participants saying they were better compared to the change from baseline modified Jackson score. The times of measurement were chosen so that about half of participants reported they had improved by that time point. Individual sensitivities and specificities were calculated for change from baseline modified Jackson score of between -7 and -4 at these times.\n\nSurvival analysis was used to estimate the relationship between treatment and time until the participants said they felt better and time until the modified Jackson score was zero with \n\nParticipant flow through the study is shown in Figure 1 . In all, 79 potential participants were screened for eligibility and 30 participants were randomised. All participants completed their visits between 12 May 2016 and 13 July 2016. Participants were predominantly young adults who were non-smokers (Table 1) .\n\nThe recruitment rate was 30/79 (38.0%) with a 95% CI 27.3 to 49.6%. One of the main reasons for exclusion was that participants had symptoms for 48 hours or longer at presentation ( Figure   1 ). All 30 randomised participants completed the study, resulting in a retention rate of 100% with a lower 95% confidence limit of 88.4%.\n\nParticipants had symptoms for a mean of 31 hours at presentation, at which time the mean modified Jackson score was 11.7 (Table 1 ). There were 27 participants who completed the modified Jackson score after ten days. Table 2 shows the mean (SD), median (IQR) and the range of the modified Jackson score from baseline to day 10 for both groups. The mean change in modified Jackson score from baseline was greater in the rhinothermy group than in the control group after 24 hours, and remained significantly greater than the control group until day 6 ( Table 3 ). Figure 2 shows a plot of the change from baseline of the modified Jackson score. In total 27 participants reported feeling \"a lot better\" within 10 days of randomisation; 17/20 8 participants from the rhinothermy group and all 10 control group participants. Two participants did 9 not fill in the modified Jackson score on the day they felt \"a lot better\". Therefore, an estimate of 10 the MCID used the scores of 25 participants, 16 in the rhinothermy group and nine in the control 11 group. We recognised post-hoc that the threshold \"a lot better\" corresponded to an estimate of 12 substantial clinical benefit rather than the MCID [32,33] and so have estimated the change which 13 represents substantial clinical benefit. The change from baseline modified Jackson score which 14 had the best sensitivity and specificity for the participants stating that they felt a lot better was 15 between 5 and 6 units on the modified Jackson Score on days 4 and 5 ( The difference in modified Jackson score between the rhinothermy group and the control group 20 was greater than the substantial clinical benefit threshold on days three, four, and five, p<0.001 21 (Table 3) . 22\n\nComplete resolution of symptoms, denoted by a modified Jackson score of zero, occurred in only 23 12 participants within 10 days after randomisation. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for feeling 'a lot 24 better' rhinothermy compared to control was 1.33 (0.60 to 2.98), p=0.48, which favoured the 25 rhinothermy group. Kaplan-Meier based survival curves are shown in Figure 3 . There were no 26 reported adverse events. 27 28 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Estimation of the SD for modified Jackson score 42\n\nThe SDs for the modified Jackson score at Days 4 and 5, based on the pooled values from t-43 tests, were 3.8 (95% CI 3.0 to 5.2) and 4.8 (3.8 to 6.6); and for change from baseline modified 44 Jackson score 3.7 (95% CI 2.9 to 5.0) and 4.7 (3.7 to 6.5). 45 46 Nasal swab viral PCR results 47\n\nPositive nasal swab PCR for a respiratory virus was found in 16 participants (53.3%). The 48 organisms found are shown in Table 5 . Human rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus 49\n\nand was found in one third of participants. There was no evidence of an interaction between the 50 treatment difference in modified Jackson scores for those that were Nasal swab positive or 51 negative. 52 The mean total use of the myAIRVO 2 device was 9.9 hours, a mean (SD) of 2.0 (0.85) hours per 57 day. Eight participants (40%) did not use the myAIRVO 2 device on day 5 and seven participants 58 (35%) used it for less than 4 days.

The study fully recruited 30 participants within an eight week 82 period and all completed the study. Adherence to rhinothermy treatment was good while 83 participants were symptomatic. Although not a primary outcome for the study rhinothermy with 84 the modified myAIRVO 2 device was associated with clinically significant reductions in common 85 cold symptoms compared to treatment with vitamin C. 86 87 This is the first study to investigate rhinothermy using the modified myAIRVO 2 device and 88 strengths include the randomised controlled design and the complete follow-up of all participants. 89\n\nIn addition, the use of a real-world control treatment increases the external validity of these 90 results, as about two-thirds of people suffering from a common cold buy over the counter 91 products for symptom relief despite inadequate evidence of effect.\n\n[4] Participants in this study 92 were recruited primarily through social media so the results should be generalisable to people in 93 the community with symptoms of the common cold. 94 95 Three main limitations apply to these results. Firstly, this study was designed as a feasibility 96 study which means that although the modified Jackson score was an efficacy outcome measure, 97 we did not formally pre-specify it as the primary outcome measure. Secondly, due to the nature 98 of the intervention we were unable to blind participants and investigators to the allocated 99 intervention and a future study aiming to replicate these results should explore the option of 100 sham rhinothermy. Finally, the small sample size means that although this study showed 101 clinically and statistically significant results it can be considered relatively 'fragile', in that the 102 modified Jackson score would only need to change in a small number of participants who 103 received the rhinothermy intervention to match the placebo group for our conclusions to be 104 different. [34, 35] A formal fragility index cannot be calculated for the change in modified Jackson 105 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 participants used the myAIRVO 2 device for two hours per day on average throughout the 5 day 124 treatment period, and for 2.6 hours on the days of use. As instructed not all participants used the 125 device late in the treatment course once their symptoms had improved. Around a third of 126 participants reduced the flow rate to 25 or 30L/min suggesting that giving participants the option 127 of reducing the flow from the initial 35L/min, or having a lower starting flow is worthwhile. The 128 difference between the randomised groups was observed within 24 hours, so that the efficacy of 129 single dose regimens or sessions over a two to three day period, which may enhance its 130 implementation in clinical practice, will be worth further study. However, while alternative 131 rhinothermy regimens will need to be assessed, our study findings suggest that the regimen used 132 in this feasibility study should also be used in future RCTs. 133 Our study has also been informative in terms of the likely number of participants required in a 135 RCT. We have estimated the change in modified Jackson score which denotes substantial 136 clinical benefit to be a five unit change. Based on the largest SD of 6.6 (from the upper CI of the 137 Jackson score at Day 5), a sample size of 38 per arm would give 90% power, alpha 5%, to detect 138 a difference in symptom score equal to the substantial clinical benefit at day 5. Assuming a 10% 139 drop out rate, derived from the lower confidence interval of our estimate, this would require a total 140 of 126 participants in an RCT investigating three randomised treatments, comprising the current 141 rhinothermy regimen, a sham rhinothermy regimen and vitamin C. 142 143 A specific respiratory virus was identified by PCR in 16/30 (53%) of participants, with the majority 144 being rhinovirus. This respiratory virus detection rate was comparable to previous studies, which 145 report detection rates between 43 and 64%.[36-38] We found no difference in the treatment 146 effect between participants who were nasal swab PCR positive or negative, indicating that our 147 findings are generalisable to symptomatic common colds, and not restricted to those with positive 148 virus detection. It also suggests that the efficacy may also relate to non-temperature related anti-149 viral effects, such as humidification of the airways and enhanced mucociliary clearance. This study shows that an RCT of rhinothermy with the modified myAIRVO 2 device is feasible, 154 that rhinothermy is well tolerated, and that the estimated change denoting substantial clinical 155 benefit for the modified Jackson score is a five unit change. Compared with vitamin C, 156 rhinothermy improves symptoms of the common cold by at least the substantial clinical benefit 157 threshold between days 3 and 5. These efficacy findings now require replication in a larger study 158 of common colds. Investigation of the efficacy of rhinothermy in the treatment of influenza is also 159 a priority, in view of the temperature-sensitivity of influenza viruses, [39] [40] [41] Results: In all 30/79 (38%, 95% CI 27 to 50) of potential participants screened for eligibility 44 were randomised. Rhinothermy was well tolerated and all randomised participants completed 45 the study (100%, 95% CI 88 to 100%). The reduction from baseline in the modified Jackson 46 score was significantly greater with rhinothermy compared with control at days 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, 47 with the maximum difference at day 4 (-6.4, 95%CI -9.4 to -3.3). The substantial clinical benefit 48 threshold for modified Jackson score was a 5 unit change. 49\n\nConclusions: This study shows that an RCT of rhinothermy compared with low-dose vitamin C 50 in the treatment of the common cold is feasible. A robust adequately powered RCT is needed, 51 particularly as this feasibility study identified that rhinothermy improved symptoms of the 52 common cold compared with control. 53 \u2022 This is the first study investigating the use of rhinothermy delivered via high flow nasal 59 cannulae for the treatment of the common cold 60\n\n\u2022 This open-label randomised -controlled feasibility study shows that an RCT of 61 rhinothermy compared with low-dose vitamin C in the treatment of the common cold is 62 feasible. 63\n\n\u2022 A five unit change in modified Jackson score has been estimated to represent the 64 threshold for substantial clinical benefit. 65\n\n\u2022 Although this study showed clinically and statistically significant benefits from 66 rhinothermy, this finding should be considered with caution, as this was a feasibility 67 study in which efficacy was not the primary outcome measure. 68 The common cold is the most frequent infection worldwide. Adults report between two and four 75 colds a year and children between six and eight colds a year.\n\n[1] The median incubation period 76 depends on the virus but is usually between one and six days.\n\n[2] The severity of symptoms 77 typically peaks two to three days after symptom onset.\n\n[1] It is almost always a self-limiting 78 illness and the total symptom duration is between seven and 14 days. volunteers.\n\n[26] The potential advantage of this device for rhinothermy is that it can deliver a 116 consistent temperature, humidity and flow rate direct into the upper airways. The study reported 117 here is a feasibility study of rhinothermy in the treatment of the common cold that will inform the 118 design of a robust RCT of this treatment. The specific aims of the feasibility study were to: 119 1. To estimate the proportions of potential participants after screening who undergo 120 randomisation, and who then complete the study, in turn providing an estimate of the time 121 and resources required to undertake an RCT. 122 2. To estimate the standard deviation (SD) of the proposed primary outcome variable for the 123 RCT, the modified Jackson score [27-29] so that the sample size for the RCT can be better 124 estimated. 125 3. To estimate the likely minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in modified Jackson 126 score among people with the common cold who are eligible to take part in the study. 127 Participants were eligible if they were between 16 and 75 years old, had common cold 144 symptoms for less than 48 hours at the time of randomisation and a modified Jackson score 145 \u22655.\n\n[28-30] The modified Jackson score is calculated from a symptom severity questionnaire 146 that consists of eight symptoms: sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, sore/scratchy 147 throat, cough, headache, malaise and fever/chills, which are scored on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 = 148 absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The total score can range from 0 to 24. 149 150 Participants were not recruited if they had: 1) An immunosuppressive medical condition and/or 151 were prescribed immunosuppressive medications; 2) A diagnosis of asthma, COPD or other 152 significant respiratory conditions; 3) Nasal conditions such as a deviated septum or chronic 153 rhinitis, which could impair nasal breathing; 4) Use of cold remedies e.g. decongestants/cough, 154 linctus/throat lozenges, within 6 hours of randomisation; 5) Currently using antibiotics or 155 inhalation medication; 6) Known allergy to ascorbic acid (Vitamin C); 7) The investigator 156 believed the participant or their care giver would be unable to safely use the myAIRVO 2 device 157 without medical supervision; 8) Had any other condition which, at the investigator's discretion, 158 was believed may present a safety risk or impact the feasibility of the study or the study results. 159 Paykel Healthcare New Zealand, the manufacturer of the myAIRVO 2 device. Written informed 163 consent was obtained before starting any study specific procedures. During the study 164 participants were able to stop the intervention at any time, without being withdrawn from the 165 study. Participants were also able to withdraw from the study at any time without giving a 166 reason. 167 168\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to two groups that received either: 1) 170\n\nRhinothermy via the modified myAIRVO 2 device, two hours per day for up to five days; or; 2) 171\n\nControl medication, Vitamin C 250mg (Healtheries, Vitaco Health NZ Ltd, Auckland, New 172 Zealand) daily for five days. The randomisation schedule was computer generated by the study 173 statistician, who was not involved in study recruitment, procedures, or data collection. After training on myAIRVO 2 set-up and use, participants were given a modified myAIRVO 2 203 device to use at home according to the same regimen (100% humidity, 41 O C, 35L/min, 120 204 minutes) for up to five days depending on resolution of symptoms. Participants were 205 encouraged to use the device for at least two hours per day and longer if desired in either a 206 single or repeated administration, preferably in the evening. Participants were allowed to reduce 207 the flow to 30L/min or 25L/min according to comfort when at home. After three days participants 208 that were randomised to the myAIRVO 2 group were contacted by phone, to check if they had 209 any adverse events and/or had any problems with using the myAIRVO 2. 210 211 Participants allocated to the control group received their first 250mg Vitamin C tablet in the CTU 212 after randomisation, and then at home for a further four days. Low-dose Vitamin C was used as 213 a control. As therapeutic use of Vitamin C after symptoms develop has not been shown to 214 consistently reduce the duration of colds or improve cold symptoms,[14] participants were not 215 expected to derive benefit above that obtained by the placebo effect. The low dose of vitamin C 216 used in this study is freely available in pharmacies in New Zealand but is unlikely to be of 217 benefit when taken after symptoms develop, as opposed to regular supplementation. 218\n\nParticipants who used Vitamin C returned the bottle for medicines reconciliation. 219 220 All participants were requested to complete a symptom diary every day for 10 days. The diary 221 comprised a daily modified Jackson score questionnaire and a box to tick when they first felt \"a 222 lot better\" compared to study entry. The mean change in modified Jackson score when 223 participants felt \"a lot better\" was used to estimate the MCID. 1. Assess the proportion of screened participants who were randomised into the trial. If a 248 minimum of 60 patients were approached, assuming a recruitment rate of 50% or less, an 249 achieved participation of 30 participants has 80% power, one sided alpha of 5% to rule out 250 a recruitment rate of less than 34%. Participant flow through the study is shown in Figure 2 . In all, 79 potential participants were 279 screened for eligibility and 30 participants were randomised. All participants completed their 280 visits between 12 May 2016 and 13 July 2016. Participants were predominantly young adults 281 who were non-smokers (Table 1) . 282 283\n\nThe recruitment rate was 30/79 (38.0%) with a 95% CI 27.3 to 49.6%. One of the main reasons 285 for exclusion was that participants had symptoms for 48 hours or longer at presentation (Figure  286 2). All 30 randomised participants completed the study, resulting in a retention rate of 100% with 287 a lower 95% confidence limit of 88.4%. 288 289\n\nParticipants had symptoms for a mean of 31 hours at presentation, at which time the mean 291 modified Jackson score was 11.7 (Table 1 ). There were 27 participants who completed the 292 modified Jackson score after ten days. Table 2 shows the mean (SD), median (IQR) and the 293 range of the modified Jackson score from baseline to day 10 for both groups. The mean change 294 in modified Jackson score from baseline was greater in the rhinothermy group than in the 295 control group after 24 hours, and remained significantly greater than the control group until day 296 6 ( Table 3) . 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 In total 27 participants reported feeling \"a lot better\" within 10 days of randomisation; 17/20 310 participants from the rhinothermy group and all 10 control group participants. Two participants did 311 not fill in the modified Jackson score on the day they felt \"a lot better\". Therefore, an estimate of 312 the MCID used the scores of 25 participants, 16 in the rhinothermy group and nine in the control 313 group. We recognised post-hoc that the threshold \"a lot better\" corresponded to an estimate of 314 substantial clinical benefit rather than the MCID [31,32] and so have estimated the change which 315 represents substantial clinical benefit. The change from baseline modified Jackson score which 316 had the best sensitivity and specificity for the participants stating that they felt a lot better was 317 between 5 and 6 units on the modified Jackson Score on days 4 and 5 ( The difference in modified Jackson score between the rhinothermy group and the control group 322 was greater than the substantial clinical benefit threshold on days three, four, and five, p<0.001 323 (Table 3) . 324\n\nComplete resolution of symptoms, denoted by a modified Jackson score of zero, occurred in only 325 12 participants within 10 days after randomisation; 10 of 19 participants who completed the 326 modified Jackson Score on day 10 in the rhinothermy group and two of 10 in the Vitamin C 327 group. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for feeling 'a lot better' rhinothermy compared to control was The SDs for the modified Jackson score at Days 4 and 5, based on the pooled values from t-340 tests, were 3.8 (95% CI 3.0 to 5.2) and 4.8 (3.8 to 6.6); and for change from baseline modified 341 Jackson score 3.7 (95% CI 2.9 to 5.0) and 4.7 (3.7 to 6.5). 342 343\n\nPositive nasal swab PCR for a respiratory virus was found in 16 participants (53.3%). The 345 organisms found are shown in Table 5 . Human rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus 346\n\nand was found in one third of participants. There was no evidence of an interaction between the 347 treatment difference in modified Jackson scores for those that were Nasal swab positive or 348 negative (p\u22650.17 for all time points). 349 This study has shown that an RCT of rhinothermy via high flow nasal cannulae in the treatment 378 of the common cold is feasible. The study fully recruited 30 participants within an eight week 379 period and all completed the study. Adherence to rhinothermy treatment was good while 380 participants were symptomatic. Although not a primary outcome for the study, in participants with 381 established common cold symptoms, rhinothermy with the modified myAIRVO 2 device was 382 associated with clinically important reductions in common cold symptoms compared to treatment 383 with low-dose vitamin C. 384 385 This is the first study to investigate rhinothermy using the modified myAIRVO 2 device and 386 strengths include the randomised controlled design and the complete follow-up of all participants. 387\n\nParticipants in this study were recruited primarily through social media so the results should be 388 generalisable to people in the community with symptoms of the common cold. 389 390 Three main limitations apply to these results. Firstly, this study was designed as a feasibility 391 study which means that although the modified Jackson score was a pre-specified efficacy 392 outcome measure, we did not formally specify it as the primary outcome measure. Secondly, due 393 to the nature of the intervention we were unable to blind participants and investigators to the 394 allocated intervention and a future study aiming to replicate these results should explore the 395 option of sham rhinothermy. Finally, the small sample size means that although this study 396 showed clinically and statistically significant results it can be considered relatively 'fragile', in that 397 the modified Jackson score would only need to change in a small number of participants who 398 received the rhinothermy intervention to match the control group for our conclusions to be 399 different. [33, 34] A formal fragility index cannot be calculated for the change in modified Jackson 400 score as it is not a dichotomous variable. The complete follow-up of all participants helps protect 401 against this fragility, however due to the above limitations a larger replication study is required. 402 participants used the myAIRVO 2 device for two hours per day on average throughout the 5 day 419 treatment period, and for 2.6 hours on the days of use. As instructed not all participants used the 420 device late in the treatment course once their symptoms had improved. Around a third of 421 participants reduced the flow rate to 25 or 30L/min suggesting that giving participants the option 422 of reducing the flow from the initial 35L/min, or having a lower starting flow is worthwhile. The 423 difference between the randomised groups was observed within 24 hours, so that the efficacy of 424 single dose regimens or sessions over a two to three day period, which may enhance its 425 implementation in clinical practice, will be worth further study. However, while alternative 426 rhinothermy regimens will need to be assessed, our study findings suggest that the regimen used 427 in this feasibility study should also be used in future RCTs. 428\n\nOur study has also been informative in terms of the likely number of participants required in a 430 RCT. We have estimated the change in modified Jackson score which denotes substantial 431 This study shows that an RCT of rhinothermy with the modified myAIRVO 2 device is feasible, 448 that rhinothermy is well tolerated, and that the estimated change denoting substantial clinical 449 benefit for the modified Jackson score is a five unit change. Compared with a low dose of vitamin 450 C in established common colds, rhinothermy improves symptoms by at least the substantial 451 clinical benefit threshold between days 3 and 5. These efficacy findings now require replication in 452 a larger study of common colds. Investigation of the efficacy of rhinothermy in the treatment of 453 influenza is also a priority, in view of the temperature-sensitivity of influenza viruses, [ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Results: In all 30/79 (38%, 95% CI 27 to 50) of potential participants screened for eligibility 50 were randomised. Rhinothermy was well tolerated and all randomised participants completed 51 the study (100%, 95% CI 88 to 100%). The reduction from baseline in the modified Jackson 52 score was greater with rhinothermy compared with control at days 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with the 53 maximum difference at day 4 (-6.4, 95%CI -9.4 to -3.3). The substantial clinical benefit threshold 54 for modified Jackson score was a 5 unit change. 55 \u2022 This open-label randomised controlled feasibility study shows that an RCT of 63 rhinothermy compared with low-dose vitamin C in the treatment of the common cold is 64 feasible. 65\n\n\u2022 A five unit change in modified Jackson score has been estimated to represent the 66 threshold for substantial clinical benefit. 67\n\n\u2022 Although this study suggested a benefit from rhinothermy, this finding should be 68 considered with caution, as this was a feasibility study in which efficacy was not the 69 primary outcome measure. 70\n\n\u2022 A robust adequately powered RCT is needed, particularly as this feasibility study 71 identified that rhinothermy improved symptoms of the common cold compared with 72 control. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 We have reported a tolerability study which found that a high flow nasal cannula device 115 (myAIRVO 2, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) modified to deliver high 116 flow humidified air at 41\u00b0C via wide bore nasal cannulae was well tolerated in healthy 117\n\nvolunteers.\n\n[26] The potential advantage of this device for rhinothermy is that it can deliver a 118 consistent temperature, humidity and flow rate direct into the upper airways. The study reported 119 here is a feasibility study of rhinothermy in the treatment of the common cold that will inform the 120 design of a robust RCT of this treatment. The specific aims of the feasibility study were to: 121 1. To estimate the proportions of potential participants after screening who undergo 122 randomisation, and who then complete the study, in turn providing an estimate of the time 123 and resources required to undertake an RCT. believed the participant or their care giver would be unable to safely use the myAIRVO 2 device 158 without medical supervision; 8) Had any other condition which, at the investigator's discretion, 159 was believed may present a safety risk or impact the feasibility of the study or the study results. 160\n\nThe study was approved by the Northern B Ethics Health and Disability Ethics Committee of 161 New Zealand (16/NTB/47), and prospectively registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical 162 Trials Registry (Trial ID: ACTRN12616000470493). The study was sponsored by Fisher & 163\n\nPaykel Healthcare New Zealand, the manufacturer of the myAIRVO 2 device. Written informed 164 consent was obtained before starting any study specific procedures. During the study 165 participants were able to stop the intervention at any time, without being withdrawn from the 166 study. Participants were also able to withdraw from the study at any time without giving a 167 reason. 168 169\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to two groups that received either: 1) 171\n\nRhinothermy via the modified myAIRVO 2 device, two hours per day for up to five days; or; 2) 172\n\nControl medication, Vitamin C 250mg (Healtheries, Vitaco Health NZ Ltd, Auckland, New 173 Zealand) daily for five days. The randomisation schedule was computer generated by the study 174 statistician, who was not involved in study recruitment, procedures, or data collection. Participants allocated to the control group received their first 250mg Vitamin C tablet in the CTU 213 after randomisation, and then at home for a further four days. Low-dose Vitamin C was used as 214 a control. As therapeutic use of Vitamin C after symptoms develop has not been shown to 215 consistently reduce the duration of colds or improve cold symptoms,[14] participants were not 216 expected to derive benefit above that obtained by the placebo effect. The low dose of vitamin C 217 used in this study is freely available in pharmacies in New Zealand but is unlikely to be of 218 benefit when taken after symptoms develop, as opposed to regular supplementation. 219\n\nParticipants who used Vitamin C returned the bottle for medicines reconciliation. 220 221 All participants were requested to complete a symptom diary every day for 10 days. The diary 222 comprised a daily modified Jackson score questionnaire and a box to tick when they first felt \"a 223 lot better\" compared to study entry. The mean change in modified Jackson score when 224 participants felt \"a lot better\" was used to estimate the MCID. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Participants had symptoms for a mean of 31 hours at presentation, at which time the mean 300 modified Jackson score was 11.7 (Table 1 ). There were 27 participants who completed the 301 modified Jackson score after ten days. Table 2 shows the mean (SD), median (IQR) and the 302 range of the modified Jackson score from baseline to day 10 for both groups. The mean change 303 in modified Jackson score from baseline was greater in the rhinothermy group than in the 304 control group after 24 hours, and remained greater than the control group until day 6 (Tables 3 305 and S1). Figure 3 shows a plot of the change from baseline of the modified Jackson score. 306 307\n\nIn total 27 participants reported feeling \"a lot better\" within 10 days of randomisation; 17/20 310 participants from the rhinothermy group and all 10 control group participants. Two participants 311 did not fill in the modified Jackson score on the day they felt \"a lot better\". Therefore, an 312 estimate of the MCID used the scores of 25 participants, 16 in the rhinothermy group and nine 313 in the control group. We recognised post-hoc that the threshold \"a lot better\" corresponded to an 314 estimate of substantial clinical benefit rather than the MCID [31,32] and so have estimated the 315 change which represents substantial clinical benefit. The change from baseline modified 316 Jackson score which had the best sensitivity and specificity for the participants stating that they 317 felt a lot better was between 5 and 6 units on the modified Jackson Score on days 4 and 5 318 (Table 4 ). Based on this analysis, we propose that a 5 unit change in modified Jackson score is 319 the substantial clinical benefit threshold for this instrument. 320 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The difference in modified Jackson score between the rhinothermy group and the control group 327 was greater than the substantial clinical benefit threshold on days three, four, and five, p<0.001 328 (Table 3) . 329\n\nComplete resolution of symptoms, denoted by a modified Jackson score of zero, occurred in 330 only 12 participants within 10 days after randomisation; 10 of 19 participants who completed the 331 modified Jackson Score on day 10 in the rhinothermy group and two of 10 in the Vitamin C 332 group.

The 356 organisms found are shown in Table 5 . Human rhinovirus was the most commonly detected 357 virus and was found in one third of participants.

Eight participants (40%) did not use the myAIRVO 2 device on day 5 and seven 366 participants (35%) used it for less than 4 days. On the days the myAIRVO 2 was used, the 367 mean (SD) use was 2.6 (0.5) hours per day. All participants in the control group took all five 368\n\nVitamin C tablets as per protocol (100% adherence). 369\n\nOn day one at the clinic all participants used a flow of 35L/min. On day two, 13 participants kept 370 using this flow rate at home, while 7 participants used a reduced flow; a flow of 30L/min and 371 25L/min was used by 3 and 4 participants respectively. On day three, four and five a mixture of 372 the 3 different flow rates were used with a mean flow rate overall of around 32L/min. 373\n\nTolerability questionnaire results for the myAIRVO 2 are shown in Table 6 . The device was 375 reasonably simple to connect at home, comfortable to wear, and acceptable with regards to the 376 amount of moisture build-up and weight of the nasal interface. It also scored favourably with 377 respect to ease of application but was found to be moderately noisy. Overall, participants 378 scored a mean (SD) of 32.4 (27.4) units on a scale of likely future use where 0 was very likely 379 and 100 was very unlikely. 380 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 This is the first study to investigate rhinothermy using the modified myAIRVO 2 device and 391 strengths include the randomised controlled design and the complete follow-up of all 392 participants.
