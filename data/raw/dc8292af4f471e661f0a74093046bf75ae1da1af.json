{"title": "A study on antigenicity and receptor-binding ability of fragment 450-650 of the spike protein of SARS coronavirus", "body": "SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a positivestranded RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family. It is the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and infected over 8000 people around the world in 2002 (Peiris et al., 2003 Rota et al., 2003) . The genome of SARS-CoV encodes several structural proteins including the spike (S) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid protein, membrane protein and envelope protein (Marra et al., 2003) . The S protein of SARS-CoV is consisted of 1255 amino acid residues with approxi-mately 25% homology to that of the other human CoVs (Ho et al., 2004; Spiga et al., 2003) . It mediates viral binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a cell surface zinc peptidase . The S protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) was mapped to a fragment between residues 318 to 510 . Li et al. (2005) have recently solved the crystal structure of S-RBD complexed with ACE2 at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution. Their results demonstrate that S-RBD contains 2 subdomains: a core (residues 318 to 423) and an extended loop (residues 424 to 494). The latter, referred as the S protein receptor binding motif (S-RBM), is formed by 2 anti-parallel \u03b2sheets (\u03b25 and \u03b26) folding into a gently concave surface, which makes all contacts with the ACE2 molecule . Interestingly, 9 out of the 14 amino acid residues of S-RBM in direct contact with ACE2 are in the \u03b26 strand (residues 450 to 494), suggesting a possibility that the \u03b26 fragment alone might be able to bind with ACE2 with considerable affinity.\n\nAs the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV, S-RBD is the most likely target for neutralizing Abs against the virus. Several groups have mapped a number of B cell epitopes in, or around, the S-RBD region (Hu et al., 2005; Hua et al., 2004 Hua et al., , 2005 Lu et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2003) , although the exact location and conformational structure of such epitopes remain to be clarified. Our previous results demonstrated that SARS patients mounted early and strong humoral responses against fragment 450-650 of the S protein (S450-650) (Zhao et al., 2005a (Zhao et al., , 2005b , which contains the \u03b26, but not \u03b25, strand of the S-RBM. We herein analyze the receptor binding ability of S450-650 and also its antigenicity in terms of recognition by Abs.\n\nExpression and purification of recombinant truncated polypeptides of S450-650 and their fusion products with GFP Preparation of recombinant S450-650 was as previously described (Zhao et al., 2005a (Zhao et al., , 2005b . DNA encoding truncated fragments covering the sequence of S450-650, namely S-I (450-510), S-II (511-560), S-III (546-595), S-IV (581-630) and S-V (601-650), were amplified by PCR using vector pET28a-S450-650 (encoding for S450-650 of SARS-CoV) as template. The resultant products were inserted into prokaryotic expression vector pET28a. DNA encoding GFP was inserted downstream the S protein genes for preparation of GFP fusion proteins S450-650-GFP, S450-510-GFP and S511-650-GFP (Fig. 1A) . Glycine-and serine-rich linkers of various length have been widely used in protein engineering since these linkers may offer little structure hindrance to folding proteins in their own constructs Nardella et al., 2004) . A linker sequence (GSGGSGS) was therefore introduced between S fragment and GFP. The recombinant products, expressed in E. coli, were purified to more than 90% homogeneity using Ni columns and examined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (Figs. 1B and 2).\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the presence of B cell epitopes in S-RBD by screening synthetic or recombinant polypeptides covering its sequence in ELISA or WB assays (Chen et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2004) . To further map the B cell epitopes in the S450-650 region, a set of convalescent patient sera (PT31, PT41, PT42, PT53, and PT58), all tested positive in SARS-CoV-based ELISA as previously described (Zhao et al., 2005a) , were screened in WB experiments against recombinant S-I, S-II, S-III, S-IV and S-V. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , S-II (511-560) and S-IV (581-630) were strongly recognized by all 5 patient sera, while none of the other overlapping constructs produced detectable signals. These results imply that fragments between residues 511-545 and 596-600 represent either linear B cell epitopes or parts of conformational B cell epitopes predominantly recognized by human Abs produced following an infection of SARS-CoV.\n\nBALB/c mice were s.c. immunized with recombinant S450-650 emulsified in CFA and subsequently tested for serum Abs against the immunizing Ag and also its truncated polypeptides in WB assays. In contrary to that obtained with patient sera, the mouse anti-serum strongly recognized S-I, weakly recognized S-III and S-IV but did not recognize S-V (Fig. 2) .\n\nComparison of the neutralization ability of patient sera and mouse antiserum By co-transfecting 293T cells with a SARS-CoV-S-proteinexpressing vector and a defective HIV-1-genome-expressing luciferase, we prepared S-protein expressing pseudovirus. The pseudovirus thus obtained was able to infect ACE2-positive Vero E6 cells in vitro, evidenced by the approximately 100,000 folds increase of luciferase activity in the infected cells (Fig. 3A) . The system was employed to compare the neutralization ability of patient sera and mouse antiserum. As shown in Fig. 3B , convalescent patient sera (PT31 and PT53), but not mouse anti-S450-650 antiserum, were able to specifically neutralize Sprotein-expressing pseudovirus infection of Vero E6 cells, implying that Ab specificity for linear epitopes in the \u03b26 strand is not necessarily associated with neutralization ability. Both human and mouse sera tested herein were unable to neutralize the infectivity of VSV-G pseudovirus (Fig. 3C) , confirming the specificity of the system.\n\nTo assess the receptor binding ability of the S450-650 fragment, Vero E6 cells were treated with recombinant S450-650 followed by either convalescent patient serum (PT31), or control serum sample (HDS), or mouse anti-S450-650 antiserum (MAS), or normal mouse serum (NMS). S-RBD-Fc is a fusion protein between the S-RBD domain (residues 318-510) and Fc fragment of human IgG1. It has been shown to be able to bind with ACE2 receptor with high affinity (Kuba et al., 2005) . As controls, S-RBD-Fc and human IgG-Fc were used to treat Vero E6 and also ACE2-negative 293T cells. After washes, the cells were subsequently treated with FITC-conjugated secondary Abs for FACS analysis. As illustrated in Figs. 4A and B, S450-650-treated Vero E6 cells were specifically recognized by patient serum PT31 or mouse anti-S450-650 antiserum, indicating specific binding of the recombinant S450-650 to the cell surface. To further locate the site for receptor binding within the 450-650 construct, we next employed fusion proteins S450-510-GFP, S511-650-GFP and S450-650-GFP for direct staining of Vero E6 and 293T cells. As expected, S450-650-GFP was able to label Vero E6, but not 293T cells and deletion of the 450-510 sequence completely abolished its ability of doing so (Figs. 4D and E). It is noteworthy that the intensity of Vero E6 cell staining by S450-650 ( Fig. 4B ) and S450-650-GFP ( Fig. 4D ) was approximately 50% of that by S-RBD-Fc ( Fig. 4C) , while the fluorescence intensity of the S450-510-GFP-stained cells was only 1/20 of that stained by S-RBD. \n\nIn the experiment shown in Fig. 6 , Vero E6 cells were treated with recombinant S450-650, washed and then lysed using lysis buffer. The lysate was treated sequentially with PT31 serum and protein A/G-agarose for precipitation of the S450-650/ACE2 complexes. The resultant precipitates were run on SDS-PAGE gels and assayed by WB with anti-ACE2 Abs as first Abs. Fig  6B illustrates that the PT31-precipitated materials contained ACE2 molecules (120 kDa band specifically recognized by goat anti-human ACE2 Abs). In parallel experiments, the S450-650treated cell lysate was precipitated using goat anti-human ACE2 polyclonal Abs and then the precipitates analyzed by WB using PT31 serum as the first Abs. A 31 kDa protein band, corresponding to the size of the S450-650 polypeptide, was clearly visualized (Fig. 6C ).\n\nIdentification of neutralizing epitopes in the S protein is of great interest for vaccine design and also our understanding of anti-SARS-CoV humoral immunity in patients. It has been demonstrated that the S-RBD (residues 318-510) contains immunodominant B cell epitopes and some of which are recognized by neutralizing Abs He et al., 2004; Sui et al., 2004) . Presumably, the neutralizing epitopes are located within the S-RBM region (residues 424-494) which forms direct contacts with ACE2 . However, this has so far not been confirmed by experimental data. In our WB assays, the \u03b26 strand (i.e. SI or S450-510) was not recognized by convalescent patient sera (Fig. 2) . Although the \u03b26 strand was predominantly recognized by antisera from mice after immunization with the S450-650 construct (Fig. 2) , such Abs did not show neutralization ability against SARS-CoV-S pseudovirus infection (Fig. 3) . By immunizing mice with the S-RBD-Fc, which adopts a natural fold of the S-RBD (Kuba et al., 2005) , He et al. (2005) generated a panel of mAbs, two of which were specific for linear epitopes between residues 450 and 510, neither of these mAbs was able to neutralize viral infection. This is in agreement with our data, shown in Fig. 3 , and indicates that the lack of neutralization ability of the mouse Abs specific for linear sequences in the \u03b26 strand is likely a genuine phenomenon rather than the result of improper presentation in the context of the peptides.\n\nIt should also be emphasized, however, that the above results do not exclude the possibility that the \u03b26 strand, or the whole S-RBM fold formed by \u03b25 and \u03b26 strands together, contains conformation-dependent B cell epitopes predominantly recognized by neutralizing Abs. In WB assays, the reducing and denaturing nature of SDS-PAGE would only allow protein Ags to be recognized in linear form.\n\nOur WB results also show that 2 fragments near the S-RBM (residues 511 to 545 and 596 to 600) were specifically recognized by all 5 patient sera tested (Fig. 2) . Whether binding of human Abs to these epitopes contributes to neutralization is still unclear, although a correlation between S450 and 650 specificity (mostly targeted at the 511-545 and 596-600 epitopes) and neutralization ability of convalescent sera provide circumstantial evidence for this notion (JC Zhao, unpublished observation). Furthermore, data reported by Li et al. (2005) and He et al. (2005) suggest that Ab binding to regions near the S-RBM fold may cause conformational change of the receptor binding sites, resulting in inhibition of the RBD binding to ACE2.\n\nAlthough the S450-650 construct contains only half of the S-RBM fold (\u03b26 but not the \u03b25 strand), it is nonetheless able to bind to ACE2 with relatively high affinity, as determined in cellular staining, pseudovirus inhibition assays and co-precipitation experiments (Figs. 4, 5 and 6 ). This is also supported by Hu et al. who documented that recombinant S471-503 blocked the binding between S-RBD and ACE2 (Hu et al., 2005) . Additionally, our computer modeling results show that the \u03b26 strand contributes significantly more than \u03b25 in terms of contact area (238 vs. 17 \u00c5 2 ) as well as binding energy (139 vs. 30.6 kJ/mol) when interacting with ACE2 (Fig. 7 ).\n\nAn unexpected finding of this study is that construct S450-510, either alone or in fusion with GFP, was relatively poor in binding to ACE2 compared with S450-650, as determined in both Vero E6 cell staining (Fig. 4D ) and SARS-CoV-S pseudovirus inhibition (Fig. 5B ) experiments. There are several possible explanations for this phenomenon. In the case where GFP-fusion proteins were employed, it is possible that the Fig. 4 . Staining of Vero E6 cells with S450-650 or its GFP fusion proteins. For indirect staining (A, B), Vero E6 cells were treated with S450-650 (0.5 \u03bcM) in PBS at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, followed by convalescent patient serum (PT31), or mouse anti-S450-650 antiserum (MAS), or serum sample from healthy blood donors (HDS), or normal mouse serum (NMS). FITC-conjugated goat anti-human, or goat-anti-mouse, IgG Abs were employed as secondary Abs. As controls, Vero E6 cells and 293T cells were treated with S-RBD-Fc, or human IgG (0.5 \u03bcM), at 4\u00b0C for 1 h and followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (C, F). For direct staining, Vero E6 (D), or 293T (E), cells were treated with GFP, S450-510-GFP, S510-650-GFP or S450-650-GFP (0.5 \u03bcM) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. After washes, the cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis. ACE2-binding site on a \u223c5.5 kDa peptide could be physically blocked by the > 20 kDa GFP. This blocking effect is significantly lessened in S450-650-GFP construct that binds ACE2 efficiently, perhaps because of a buffering effect of residues 511-650 between \u03b26 (i.e. 450-510) and GFP. In addition, by starting the molecule from the middle of the S-RBM fold, the S450-650 might be prone-to-misfold. Thirdly, sequences adjacent to S-RBM may also assist the receptor binding of S-RBM in a yet unknown mechanism. By virtue of the formation of inter or intra-molecular disulfide bonds, the binding of S450-650 polypeptide for ACE2 could be stabilized and enhanced as well. Xiao et al. (2004) found that a dimeric state of S1 portion of the S protein could contribute to an increased overall affinity that may enhance fusion efficiency. This hypothesis may help explaining the fact that Abs against regions adjacent to the S-RBM exhibit neutralizing potential.\n\nHigh fidelity Taq DNA polymerase was purchased from TaKaRa Biotech Co.

PDB file accession number is 2AJF. Fig. 6 . Co-precipitation of recombinant S450-650 with ACE2 in the lysate of Vero E6 cells. Vero E6 cells (1 \u00d7 10 6 ) were sequentially treated with goat anti-human ACE2 Abs, or goat IgG (2 \u03bcg), and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG. The stained cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis for determination of ACE2 expression on the cell surface (A). For the co-precipitation experiment (B), Vero E6 cells (2.5 \u00d7 10 7 ) were treated with, or without, recombinant S450-650 (15 \u03bcg/ml) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. After washes, the cells were lysed using lysis buffer and the lysate treated with PT31 serum followed by protein-A/G-agarose precipitation. The precipitated materials were run on SDS-PAGE 12% gels and the protein bands transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for WB assays using goat anti-human ACE2 Abs as the first Abs, the detection Abs were HRP-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG. In a parallel experiment (C), lysate of the S450-650-treated, or untreated, Vero E6 cells were precipitated using goat anti-human ACE2 Abs and protein-A/G-agarose. The precipitates were assayed by WB using PT31 serum (first Ab) and HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG (detection Ab). and T4 ligase were from Invitrogen (California, USA). A kit for DNA extraction and purification was from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). E. coli strain of BL21 (DE3) was from Stratagene (La Jolla, California, USA). The Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin was from Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany). Protein A/G-agarose for immunoprecipitation was supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (California, USA). The cell transfection reagent was from Vigorous Biotech Co. (Beijing, China). Luciferase assay reagent was supplied by Promega (Madison, USA). Goat anti-human ACE2 ectodomain polyclonal Abs was purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat, goat anti-human, goat antimouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat antihuman and goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Zhongshan Biotech Co. (Beijing, China). Vero E6 cells and 293T cells were obtained from ATCC and propagated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Utah, USA).\n\nSerum samples used in this study were from convalescent SARS patients, collected between July and August 2003 by the Beijing Red Cross Center. The blood samples were processed within 18 h of collection. In addition, a control serum sample (HDS) was prepared by mixing sera from 10 randomly selected healthy blood donors.\n\nExpression vector containing the gene for S450-650 (pET28a-S450-650) was as previously described (Zhao et al., 2005a (Zhao et al., , 2005b . DNA encoding truncated fragments of S450-650 was PCR amplified using pET28a-S450-650 as template. A vector containing the gene for green fluorescence protein (GFP) was a gift from Dr. L. Barber, Imperial College School of Science, Technology and Medicine, London. For preparation of GFP fusion proteins, a linker sequence (-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser-) was added between the S protein fragment and GFP using sequence overlapping extension PCR method. The DNA sequences encoding for S protein fragments or their GFP fusion proteins were inserted into pET28a expression vector. Recombinant products were expressed in E. coli and purified using Ni-NTA resin following the manufacturer's instructions. The preparation of S-RBD-Fc, a recombinant fusion protein between S-RBD (residues 318-510) and the Fc portion of human IgG1, was expressed in CHO cells and purified by chromatography as described elsewhere (Kuba et al., 2005) .\n\nFemale BALB/c mice of 6-8 weeks of age, obtained from the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, were immunized s.c. with recombinant S450-650 (50 \u03bcg/mouse/100 \u03bcl), or PBS, emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA, Sigma, USA) at the base of the tail. Booster immunizations were given on days 15 and 29 with S450-650 emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). The mice were bled for sera a week after the third immunization and the serum samples were kept at \u2212 80\u00b0C until use.\n\nThe procedure for IP-Western blot assay was according to that by Li et al. (2003) . Briefly, Vero E6 cells (2.5 \u00d7 10 7 ) were treated with, or without, recombinant S450-650 (15 \u03bcg) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. The cells were washed 3 times and then lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.5% NP-40 and protease inhibitors (pepstinin, leupeptin and aproptinin, all from Sigma). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the lysate was allowed to mix with either PT31 serum (1:200 diluted) or goat-antihuman ACE2 Abs (2 \u03bcg/ml final concentration) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sera from healthy subjects (HDS) and goat IgG were also included as controls. Protein A/G-agarose was then added and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, followed by 3 washes. Bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, at 90-100\u00b0C for 10 min, and separated on SDS-PAGE 12% gels. The protein bands were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for WB assays using goat anti-human ACE2 Abs or PT31 serum as the first Abs.\n\nThe nitrocellulose membrane, on which the recombinant proteins were transferred from SDS-PAGE gels, were blocked at room temperature for 2 h with blocking solution (5% non-fat dry milk) and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with convalescent sera of SARS patients (1:200 diluted) or antisera from mice after S450-650 immunization (1:1000 diluted). After washes in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH7.5) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T), the membranes were incubated with HRP-labeled goat anti-human or anti-mouse IgG. 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB, Sigma) was used to visualize the reaction.\n\nFor indirect staining experiments, Vero E6 cells (1 \u00d7 10 6 ) were treated with recombinant S450-650 (0.5 \u03bcM) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. After 3 washes, the cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min in the presence of patient sera (1:100 diluted) or mouse anti-S450-650 antiserum (1/200 diluted). Serum samples from healthy blood donors or naive BALB/c mice were included as controls. Recombinant S-RBD-Fc and human IgG-Fc were also employed to treat Vero E6 cells (0.5 \u03bcM, 4\u00b0C for 1 h) as controls. After washes, the cells were incubated with FITCconjugated goat anti-human or goat-anti-mouse IgG at 4\u00b0C for 30 min and analyzed with FACScan (BD).\n\nFor direct staining experiments, Vero E6 cells (1 \u00d7 10 6 ) were treated with GFP or GFP fusion proteins (0.5 \u03bcM) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by flow cytometric analysis using a FACScan machine. GFP has a single excitation peak at 490 nm and emission peak at 509 nm, which adapts to common fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) bandpass of FACS (Gerdes and Kaether, 1996) .\n\nPreparation of SARS-CoV-S-protein-expressing pseudovirus was according to the method of Nie et al. (2004) . Briefly, 293T cells (5 \u00d7 10 6 ), seeded in 10 cm diameter tissue culture dishes one day earlier, were co-transfected with defective HIV-1 genome pNL4.3-Luc-R \u2212 E \u2212 (20 \u03bcg) and plasmid pVSV-G (10 \u03bcg), encoding for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein, or plasmid pCMV-S, encoding for the S protein of SARS-CoV, using the Vigorous transfection reagent (Vigorous Biotech Co., Beijing, China). The defective HIV-genome contains the gene for luciferase which can be used as a reporter of successful infection by the pseudovirus. The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium 24 h post-transfection and the cells cultured for additional 24 h. The culture supernatant, containing VSV-G-pseudovirus or SARS-S-pseudovirus, was then harvested and filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm pose-sized filter, followed by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 3 h at 4\u00b0C using a Beckman XL-90 ultra centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Harbor Boulevard, USA). The pseudoviral pellets were resuspended in PBS, titrated, aliquoted and stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C until use.\n\nNeutralization and blocking assays using the SARS-CoV-S pseudovirus system SARS-CoV-S pseudovirus and VSV-G pseudovirus infection of cells and its neutralization were according to Zhang et al. (2004) . Briefly, Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates, at a density of 8 \u00d7 10 3 cells/well, and cultured overnight. Serially diluted serum samples or recombinant proteins were mixed with pseudovirus preparations for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, and then the mixture added to the wells with monolayer of Vero E6 cells. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, the mixture in the wells was replaced with fresh medium and the cells were cultured for additional 48 h. After washes, the cells were lysed using the luciferase assay reagent (Promega, UAS) and the luciferase activity in the cell lysate determined using a Veritas microplate luminometer (Turner Biosystems).\n\nLuciferase activity of the reference group (Vero E6 cells treated with pseudovirus alone) was taken as 100% infection. Cells not treated with pseudovirus were included as specificity control and their luciferase activity readings were at least 3 logs lower than that of the reference group in all experiments. Luciferase activity of the experimental groups (Vero E6 cells treated with pseudovirus preparations in the presence of serum Abs or blocking reagents) was compared with that of the reference group and the results, expressed as percent infection, are calculated as follows: 100 \u00d7 [Luciferase activity of the experimental groups] / [Luciferase activity of the reference group].\n\nAll experiments described here had been repeated at least 3 times. Comparison of the data was performed using the Student's t test. Significance was defined as a P value < 0.05."}
