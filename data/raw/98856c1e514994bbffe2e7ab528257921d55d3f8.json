COVID-19 OUTBREAK IN NORTHERN ITALY: FIRST PRACTICAL INDICATIONS FOR RADIOTHERAPY DEPARTMENTS", "body": "The number of people infected by COVID-19 is dramatically increasing worldwide [1] . The first person-to-person transmission in Italy was reported on February 21, 2020, and led to an infection chain that represents the largest outbreak outside Asia to date [2] . As of March 12, 2020, in Italy, there are 10,590 positive patients, 827 deaths, and 1,045 healed, with numbers varying from hour to hour. The COVID-19 ncubation interval varies from 5 to 14 days [3] . Since January 30, 2020, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and the day after the Italian Government declared a public health emergency. In the first phase, the Government defined areas at different risk of infection: a) high-risk (so-called \"red zone or level 1 risk zone\" b) mean risk (level 2 risk zone) and c) the rest of national territory, to be alerted but considered at low risk (level 3 risk zone). In the subsequent phases of the crisis, following the indications of a scientific and technical committee and in agreement with the WHO, the Government finally decided to extend the Red Zone to the whole Nation (March 8, 2020). All public Hospitals faced an unprecedented emergency, with drastic changes in the organization. All cancer patients were consequently involved at different levels. We here report the experience of a group of Northern Italy Radiotherapy Departments that are located inside or very close to the first \"Red Zone,\" and thus were the first to face the emergency. accessing the radiotherapy areas.\n\nTo provide a hydroalcoholic solution for hand disinfection at the entrance of the radiotherapy center.\n\nTo wear surgical masks, as recommended for all health professionals and patients according to WHO indications [5] , and in particular in the following cases: 1) if the operator has respiratory symptoms, to protect others; 2) if the operator is in close contact with a person who has respiratory symptoms, to protect herself/himself. 1.\n\nIf the patient has a cough or fever or dyspnea due to pre-existing morbidity: the patient should wear a protective mask, and radiotherapy should be continued.\n\nIf a new patient is COVID-19 positive: do not start treatment.\n\n3. If a patient on treatment is suspect for the onset of COVID-19 typical symptoms (cough and/or fever and/or dyspnea) and is waiting for microbiological diagnosis: stop treatment. 1.\n\nreport the current situation to the hospital management, for getting help in solving the problem (e.g., hiring new staff); 2. connect with other radiotherapy centers for the use of external personnel to avoid the interruption of ongoing therapies;\n\n3. call for service of retired personnel following the procedures already defined by the administrations;\n\n4. redistribute patients on available machines, and a variation of fractionation, when feasible, is advised.\n\nProblem analysis:\n\nIt is advisable to limit patient access to radiotherapy facilities while maintaining optimal care conditions.\n\nSuggested solutions:\n\n1.\n\nTo adopt hypo-fractionated regimens when possible;\n\nTo postpone follow-up visits;\n\n3.\n\nTo use palliative medical treatments at home, instead of radiotherapy, when deemed to be of similar efficacy;\n\nTo delay non-urgent and deferrable radiotherapy treatments for patients with a better prognosis (e.g., adjuvant radiotherapy of breast cancer patients, radical radiotherapy of patients with low-intermediate risk prostate disease, others);\n\nTo postpone therapies for benign and functional diseases.\n\nThe COVID-19 spread in Italy was initially subtle, and then unexpectedly rapid in its expansion.\n\nBased on the information obtained from the Wuhan Region in China, it was initially thought to confine the outbreak areas while protecting the rest of the nation with lighter measures. As the first affected regions are characterized by a very high population density, the virus dramatically spread in a few weeks throughout Northern Italy. As a consequence, all cancer patients' therapeutic flows were altered: surgery, systemic therapies, and radiotherapy. The radiotherapy centers located in the hospitals that were the first to face the emergency gained rapid field experience and then started monitoring the situation and collecting data. This report presents a few practical suggestions that came up from the first two weeks of collective work under emergency conditions and is the result of a joint effort to ensure continuity of therapies while protecting patients, health professionals, and the general population. The indications were integrated with the WHO recommendations and with the local health authorities' guidelines. The primary aim was to share information and provide guidance to radiotherapy departments worldwide. The report is mainly focused on how to deal with symptomatic, suspect, or COVID-19 positive patients undergoing radiation therapy. Since international indications for radiotherapy units facing COVID-19 outbreak have not been developed yet, we identified five key priorities, here described, together with a brief analysis of the problems and the possible solutions."}
