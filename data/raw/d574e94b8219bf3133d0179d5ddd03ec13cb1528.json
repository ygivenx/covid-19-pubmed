{"title": "YouTube as Source of Information on 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak: a Cross Sectional Study of English and Mandarin Content YouTube as Source of Information on 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak : a Cross Sectional Study of English and Mandarin Content", "body": "underrepresented . Given its popularity, YouTube should be considered as important platform for information dissemination.\n\nIn December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan city in Hubei Province of China 1 . A novel strain of coronavirus was isolated from the affected patients on 7 th Jan 2020 and the number of confirmed cases rapidly soared to 581 within 2 weeks 2 . The cases spread beyond Wuhan city and on 30 th Jan 2020, World Health Organization (WHO ) declared the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV ) outbreak as \"public health emergency of international concern \"(PHEIC). As per WHO situation report of 6 th February 2020, 28276 cases had been confirmed globally, of these 216 were outside China in 24 countries worldwide 3 .\n\nIn our current digital world, online platforms are perhaps the most accessible source of health related information for the public 4, 5 . YouTube is a popular video sharing website with an estimated monthly viewership of 1 billion 6 The quality of information on YouTube has been evaluated during previous epidemics and endemics. Up to 20 % of videos were reported to have misleading information about various aspects of disease during these outbreaks 8, 10, 11 We are not aware of any studies evaluating the role of YouTube as a source of information on 2019 -nCoV. The objectives of our study were (i) to analyze the quality of the information available on YouTube about current nCoV outbreak (ii) to compare the English language content with the information available in Chinese Mandarin henceforth mentioned as Mandarin. It is the most widely spoken language in Asia and official language of China. The current n-CoV epidemic has affected the Asia Pacific region more than the West. We think that it is therefore important to review the available content in Mandarin\n\nYouTube was accessed on 1 st and 2 nd February 2020 from Singapore using the search terms ' 2019 novel coronavirus ' and 'Wuhan virus '. Search term ' 2019 novel coronavirus ' yielded 16,4000,000 results while the term 'Wuhan virus' showed 20,800,000 results. The search term used in Mandarin '\u6b66\u6c49\u75c5\u6bd2' is a translation for 'Wuhan virus' and showed 58,100,000 results. We included first 50 videos from each search term for further analysis.\n\nThis screening strategy is based on previous studies indicating that the users do not go beyond the first few pages of results from a search engine [12] [13] [14] . The default YouTube algorithm of decreasing order of relevance was used for sorting the videos. These 150 videos were saved in a playlist for further analysis because the search results in YouTube can change on a day to day basis 7 . Uniform resource locators (URLs) of these videos were saved separately as back up. Our search methodology is in alignment with previous studies on YouTube content [15] [16] [17] Of the 150 videos screened, 72 videos in English and 42 videos in Mandarin were included in further analysis ( Figure 1A and 1B). Exclusion criterion were : videos in language other than English or Mandarin , absence of audio, videos lacking information on the 2019 novel coronavirus and duration more than 15 minutes. An analysis of 250 top YouTube channels concluded that the optimal length for a video is 10-16 minutes 18 . Videos with longer duration do not receive much viewership. Hence we excluded those videos from our study. The videos with subtitles were included in the group of the subtitle language. All videos were reviewed and analyzed by 2 independent reviewers (WZT and YYL ). Both WZT and YYL have received formal education in English and Chinese and are fluent in both. WZT is a haematologist and YYL is a medicine trainee. Any discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer NKB who is proficient in both English and spoken Mandarin. As this study required analysis of publicly available information, Institution Review Board approval was not required.\n\nVideos were classified as useful if they contained scientifically correct information about any aspect of the disease (symptoms, treatment, prevention of disease, or measures being taken to combat the disease). The videos that contained scientifically unproven (e.g., referring to nCoV as a manmade conspiracy or government propaganda) information were classified as misleading. Videos uploaded by news agencies with information on current status of the disease in terms of mortality and extent of spread only, without any information on prevention, treatment, or measures to combat the disease were classified as news update. This classification has been used in evaluation of information during previous epidemics 10, 19, 20 We used modified DISCERN score to assess the reliability of the videos 15 . This score allocates one point each for clarity, reliable source of information, lack of bias, reference supplementation and mention of uncertainty (Table 1) Table 1 .The kappa coefficient of agreement was used to determine degree of agreement between the two researchers.\n\nSource of videos was categorized into one of five groups : academic institutions or hospitals, news agencies, government agencies like regional health departments, WHO or independent users.\n\nThe authors are aware of the uncertainties regarding this disease. For example, there is still no consensus on the source of disease outbreak or the transmissibility of the virus, exact incubation period of the virus, and the proportion of infected people who develop disease.\n\nBefore grading the videos, available scientific literature [21] [22] [23] and relevant information on WHO website was reviewed.\n\nVersion R 3.5.3 was used for analysis. Unpaired Student t-test was used to test the hypothesis of difference in means for all variables. A p-value of 0.05 was considered to be significant. Given the small sample size, univariate logistic regression was used to find the odds of posting a useful video based on source . Table 2 .\n\nThe majority of videos were uploaded by news agencies ( 76 %, n= 86) followed by independent users (11%, n=12). WHO contributed 3 videos ( Table 4 ). One of these videos was in English language with Mandarin subtitles and had 29466 views. There were no videos by CDC. No videos were shared by academic institutions in Mandarin. Independent users were 7 times less likely to upload useful information than academic institutions (Table 5) .\n\nDespite being of similar length, misleading videos in English attracted significantly lesser number of views and likes than useful videos. Conversely, misleading videos in Mandarin were of longer duration than useful videos and attracted more number of views . This difference was however not statistically significant .The statements made in misleading videos are available as supplementary Table 2 More than 70% of useful videos in English contained information about the prevalence, transmission and treatment/outcomes of nCoV disease. Almost half of the useful videos did not address transmission or clinical symptoms ( Table 3 ). The mean MICI scores for each component were low. The majority of mandarin videos focussed on transmission similar to their English counterparts. 90 % of useful Mandarin videos relayed no information on screening or testing of nCoV disease.\n\nYouTube viewership of content related to the 2019 n-CoV epidemic appears higher than previous disease outbreaks 10, 20 . This is evident by the much higher number of mean views/day of the useful videos in our study. This can be partly explained by the fact that we [24] [25] [26] . The lower percentage of misleading videos in our study can be explained by the difference in source of these videos compared to previous studies . Individual users accounted for only 11 % of total videos while news agencies contributed 68% . This is not surprising given the global nature and rapid spread of this outbreak . This has attracted attention of news agencies worldwide. Videos uploaded by independent users are more likely to contain misleading information than government/news agency videos 8 .\n\nThe modified DISCERN score of videos which were characterized as useful is of concern too. There was only 1 video with a perfect DISCERN score of 5 indicating highest reliability. \n\nOur study has many limitations. This study presents only a cross sectional snapshot of the available information. The viewership and content on YouTube change on a daily basis. We are unable to comment on how the viewership and content regarding 2019 nCoV will change as the outbreak evolves. We did not analyze other video sharing platforms such as health sharing websites or news channel websites. In addition, YouTube is not accessible from China. Instead, a platform called Youku is used for video sharing. This affects the applicability of results in China which is the epicentre of this disease outbreak. Restriction of YouTube in China also explains the relative lesser number of views of Mandarin language videos compared to those in English. Nonetheless, Mandarin remains the widest spoken language in Asia Pacific region and videos in this language serve as an important source of information to native Mandarin speakers in this region. Another limitation of our study is the possibility of inter and intra observer bias though we used the kappa coefficient to ensure that the results were not too different.\n\nOur search was limited to first 50 videos for each keyword. It has previously been explained in multiple studies that most Internet users do not look beyond the first 50 search results 16, [28] [29] For the search of videos in Mandarin, we used the Mandarin translation of 'Wuhan virus' and not '2019 Novel Coronavirus'. This strategy was based on our preliminary review of number of videos with each search term. The Mandarin term for 2019 novel coronavirus ' 2019 \u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2' showed only 380000 videos compared to 58100000 videos identified with the term '\u6b66\u6c49\u75c5\u6bd2' which means Wuhan virus in Mandarin. This indicated that the former term was not very popular in Mandarin language and hence was omitted from further inclusion. YouTube's search can be affected by the previous search history. We rectified this issue by using a cache cleared browser and creating a fresh account for the search.\n\nIn conclusion, the available information on YouTube about 2019 n-CoV outbreak attracted high viewership. This clearly establishes YouTube as a popular platform for information seeking in the current n-CoV epidemic. As the current outbreak evolves, international health agencies and academic institutions should release more videos with information about screening and testing of this disease. YouTube should consider screening and removing videos with misleading information to prevent public paranoia in current state of emergency.\n\nFunding : No funding was required to conduct this study Disclosure : The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\n\u2022 In the current n-CoV outbreak YouTube viewership remains high for both English and Mandarin content. \u2022 The medical content of these videos is suboptimal and needs to be improved \u2022 Misleading videos in Mandarin were more popular and had higher viewership than useful videos \u2022 Government agencies and international health agencies should consider increasing their online presence and consider YouTube as a popular source for dissemination of reliable information"}
