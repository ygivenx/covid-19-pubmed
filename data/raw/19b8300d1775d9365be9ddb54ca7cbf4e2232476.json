Controlling and eradicating infectious diseases are ongoing problems that have received increasing attention from numerous authors [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Various factors, such as vaccination, time delay, impulse and so on, are used to construct mathematical models and seek effective ways to eliminate infectious diseases. Time delay, which has great biologic meaning in epidemic systems, is often used [7] [8] [9] [10] . Many scholars have also paid close attention to the effects of the temporary disease immunity of epidemic models, i.e., a fleeting immunity to a disease after recovery before becoming susceptible again. The phenomenon is common during the transmission of many epidemic diseases, such as influenza, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella and so on. Thus, in current paper, we introduce temporal delays to make epidemic models more realistic and interesting.\n\nEpidemic models are inevitably subject to environmental noise. Most epidemic models are driven by white noise, and many results have been achieved in this area [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, under severe environmental perturbations, such as avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and hurricanes, the continuity of solutions may be broken; accordingly, a jump process should be introduced to prevent and control diseases [20] [21] [22] [23] .\n\nIn the present work, we consider the effects of vaccination and temporary immunity on a stochastic susceptibleinfectious-recovered (SIR) epidemic model driven by L\u00e9vy noise. A generalized nonlinear incidence rate f (S(t))g(I(t)) is also introduced. Based on the above factors, we formulate the delayed vaccinated SIR epidemic model as follows:\n\n( \u039b \u2212 \u00b5S(t) \u2212 pS(t) \u2212 \u03b2f (S(t))g(I(t)) + pS(t \u2212 \u03c4 1 )e \u2212\u00b5\u03c4 1 + \u03b3 I(t \u2212 \u03c4 2 )e \u2212\u00b5\u03c4 2 ) dt \u2212 f (S(t \u2212 ))g(I(t \u2212 ))(\u03c3 1 dB 1 (t) + \u222b Y \u03b3 (u)\u00d1(dt, du)), dI(t) = ( \u03b2f (S(t))g(I(t)) \u2212 (\u00b5 + \u03b3 )I(t) ) dt + f (S(t \u2212 ))g(I(t \u2212 ))(\u03c3 1 dB 1 (t) + \u222b Y \u03b3 (u)\u00d1(dt, du)),\n\nwhere S(t), I(t), and R(t) are the numbers of susceptible, infectious, and recovered populations, respectively. \u039b represents the constant recruitment of susceptible individuals, \u00b5 is the natural death rate of populations, \u03b2 is the transmission rate, \u03b3 represents the recovery rate, p denotes the proportional coefficient of the vaccinated for the susceptible, \u03c4 1 represents the validity period of the vaccination and \u03c4 2 is the length of the immunity period. All parameters are assumed to be positive constants.\n\nHerein, \u03c3 2 i (t) (i = 1, 2) is the intensity of white noise and \u03c3 i > 0 (i = 1, 2); and B i (t) (i = 1, 2) is the standard Brownian motions, which are defined on a complete probability space (\u2126, F , P) with filtration {F t } t\u2208R+ satisfying the usual conditions [21] . N is a Poisson counting measure with compensator\u00d1 and characteristic measure \u03bb on a measurable subset Y of (0, \u221e) which satisfies \u03bb(Y) < \u221e; \u03bb is assumed to be a l\u00e9vy measure, such that\u00d1(dt, du) = N(dt, du) \u2212 \u03bb\u00d1(du)dt; \u03b3 : Y \u00d7 \u2126 \u2192 R is bounded and continuous with respect to \u03bb and is B(Y) \u00d7 F t -measurable, where B(Y) is a \u03c3 -algebra with respect to the set Y, F t is a sub \u03c3 -algebra of F , and F is a \u03c3 -algebra of subsets of a given set \u2126 [22] . In this paper, B i and N are assumed to be independent of each other.\n\nAs the first two equations do not depend on the last equation in system (1.1), therefore, we only consider the equations as follows:\n\n(1.\n\n2)\n\nThe initial conditions of model (1.2) are\n\nAccording to the phenomena observed in nature, such as bee colonies, we assume that the self-regulating competitions within the same species are strictly positive, that is,\n\nWe also establish the following assumptions on functions f (S) and g(I):\n\nAssumption (H2) f (S) is a continuously differentiable function and monotonically increasing on\n\nAssumption (H3) g(I) is twice continuously differentiable, and\n\nI is monotone decreasing on R + , g(0) = 0, and g \u2032 (0) > 0.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to prove the existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution. The extinction and persistence in the mean of the system are also discussed.\n\nIn this section, we list some notations, definitions and lemmas. First, we denote\n\nwhere f (t) is a continuous and bounded function defined on [0, +\u221e).\n\nThen, we give the It\u00f4's formula for general stochastic differential equations. Define the n-dimensional stochastic equation [24] :\n\nwith initial value X (t 0 ) = X 0 . Here, f (t, X ) = (f 1 (t, X ), f 2 (t, X ), . . . , f n (t, X )) is a n-dimensional vector function, (g(t, X )) n\u00d7l is a n \u00d7 l matrix function and B 1 (t) = (B 1 (t), B 2 (t), . . . , B l (t)) is a l\u2212dimensional standard Brownian motion defined on the probability space (\u2126, F , P). Define the differential operator L associated with Eq. (2.1)\n\nIf function V (t, X ) \u2208 C 2,1 (R n \u00d7 R; R), then we have\n\nThus, the It\u00f4's formula is listed as follows Lemma 2.1 ([24] ). Let X (t) satisfy Eq. (2.1) and function V (t, X ) \u2208 C 2,1 (R n \u00d7 R; R). Then\n\n, . . . , \u2202V (t,X ) \u2202xn ).\n\n(2) If positive constants \u03bb 0 , T and \u03bb \u2265 0 exist such that\n\nfor all t \u2265 T , then, \u27e8x\u27e9 * \u2265 \u03bb/\u03bb 0 a.s. Proof. According to the local Lipschitz condition of system (1.2), we obtain that for any initial value X 0 = (S(0), I(0)) \u2208 R 2 + , a unique local solution (S(t), I(t)) exists on [\u2212\u03c4 , \u03c4 e ), herein, \u03c4 e represents the explosion time. To prove that the solution is global, it is required to obtain that \u03c4 e = \u221e a.s. Then, we suppose that k 0 \u2265 1 is sufficiently large such that S(0) and I(0) lie within the interval [1/k 0 , k 0 ]. For each integer k > k 0 , we define the stopping time \u03c4 k = inf{t \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4 , \u03c4 e ] : S(t)\u0338 \u2208(1/k, k), or I(t)\u0338 \u2208(1/k, k)}. Then, \u03c4 k increases as k \u2192 \u221e. Denote \u03c4 \u221e = lim k\u2192+\u221e \u03c4 k , thus \u03c4 \u221e \u2264 \u03c4 e . In the following, we need to show that \u03c4 \u221e = \u221e. If not, there are constants T > 0 and \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1) satisfying P{\u03c4 \u221e < \u221e} > \u03b5. Thus, an integer\n\nwhere a is a constant that will be given later. By virtue of It\u00f4's formula, we derive\n\nHere, LV :\n\n. On the other hand, we achieve that\n\nThus,\n\nThen applying Taylor formula to function ln(1 \u2212 t) here t = f (S) S g(I)\u03b3 (u) and Assumption (H1) to \u03d5 1 , we have that\n\nHere \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1) is an arbitrary number. Similarly, we can obtain that\n\nTherefore, we achieve that\n\nTaking integral on the above inequality from 0 to \u03c4 k \u2227 T , then\n\nLet \u2126 k = {\u03c4 k \u2264 T }, then P(\u2126 k ) \u2265 \u03b5. For each \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 k , S(\u03c4 k , \u03c9), or I(\u03c4 k , \u03c9) equals either k or 1/k, and\n\nThus,\n\nwhere 1 \u2126 k is the indicator function of \u2126 k . Letting k \u2192 \u221e, we obtain the contradiction.\n\nThe proof is completed.\n\nNext, we prove that \u0393 is a positively invariant set of system (1.2). \n\n, I(t)) / \u2208 \u0393 }. We need to show that P(\u03c4 < t) = 0 for all t > 0.\n\nNotice that P(\u03c4 < t) \u2264 P(\u03c4 n < t), then we have to prove lim sup n\u2192+\u221e P(\u03c4 n < t) = 0. Define the function \n\nTaking integral and expectation on both sides of (3.7) and by virtue of Fubini Theorem, then we derive\n\nApplying Gronwall Lemma, we obtain that E(W (X (s))) \u2264 W (X 0 )e \u03b7s .\n\nfor all s \u2208 [0, t \u2227 \u03c4 n ]. Thus, E(W (X (t \u2227 \u03c4 n ))) \u2264 W (X 0 )e \u03b7(t\u2227\u03c4n) \u2264 W (X 0 )e \u03b7t , t \u2265 0.\n\n(3.8)\n\nIn consideration of W (X (t \u2227 \u03c4 n )) > 0 and some component of X (\u03c4 n ) being less than or equal to 1 n , we achieve that\n\n(3.9)\n\nBy (3.8) and (3.9), we obtain that\n\nfor all t \u2265 0. Therefore,\n\nThe proof is completed.\n\nIn this section, to discuss the extinction of the disease, we define\n\nand for the sake of simplicity, we denote \u27e8x(t)\u27e9 = 1 t \u222b t 0 x(s)ds, then the following theorem is obtained. \n\nProof. Applying It\u00f4's formula, we derive that\n\ng(I(t)) \n\non the other hand, we have then,\n\nTherefore, (4.5) and here, \u03c6(t) =\n\nAccording to (4.5), we obtain that\n\nIn addition,\n\nThen, we have that By virtue of the condition (2) and (4.6), we achieve that\n\nMoreover, by (4.6), we have that\n\nAccording to the condition (1) and (4.8), we obtain that lim sup\n\nThat is lim t\u2192\u221e I(t) = 0. Moreover, we have that\n\nThe conclusion is proven.\n\n2(\u00b5+\u03b3 )(\u00b5+p(1\u2212e \u2212\u00b5\u03c4 1 )) 2 hold, then for an arbitrary solution (S(t), I(t)) of system (1.2), we have lim t\u2192\u221e I(t) = 0, which implies that the disease is extinct.\n\nNow we are in the position to discuss the persistence in the mean of the disease and before that some notations are presented in the following.\n\nFor the convenience, we denot\u00ea\n\n) , \n\nConsidering lim t\u2192\u221e F (t) t = 0, then for an arbitrary \u03b6 > 0, there exists a T 1 = T 1 (\u03c9) > 0 and a set \u2126 k such that F (t) t \u2264 \u03b6 and P(\u2126 k ) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b6 for all t \u2265 T 1 , \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 k . LetT = max{T , T 1 }, then according to Lemma 2.2 and Theorem 3 in Ref. [22] , we achieve that\n\nOn the other hand, by (4.2) and (4.5), we obtain that\n\nAs 0 < S + I \u2264 N 0 , then we derive that \u2212\u221e < ln I(t) < ln(N 0 ). Thus,\n\nBy virtue of the conclusion lim t\u2192\u221e \u03c6(t) = 0 and the arbitrariness of \u03b5, we obtain that\n\nIn addition, by virtue of (4.5) and (5.6), we have that\n\nIn the following , we prove lim inf t\u2192\u221e \u27e8S(t)\u27e9 \u2265 I * .\n\nBy assumptions (H2) and (H3), a constant T 2 \u2265 T 1 > 0 exists satisfying\n\nfor all t \u2265 T 2 .\n\nUsing the first equation of model (1.2), we achieve that\n\nTherefore, by Theorem 4.1 and applying the arbitrariness of \u03b7, we have\n\nThe desired result is obtained.\n\nRemark 2. From Theorem 5.1, we obtain that ifR 0 > 1 +\u03c3 1 2 \u039b 2 2\u00b5 2 (\u00b5+\u03b3 ) , and choose A 1 = min{I * ,\u00ce * }, then the solution (S(t), I(t)) of system (1.2) with an initial condition (1.3) is persistent in the mean. Moreover, denote A 2 = max{I * ,\u0128 * }, we can also obtain the condition for the permanence in the mean of the system, that is,\n\nIn this section, we will perform some numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results by Euler numerical approximation [26] .\n\n(1) Choose the parameter values in model (1.2) as follows: 2m N 0 (\u00b5 + \u03b3 ) = 0.008, and the condition (1) of Theorem 4.1 is satisfied. Thus, the disease I goes to extinction with probability one and Fig. 1 confirms it. Moreover, by Fig. 1 , we achieve that the disease is extinct whereas the corresponding deterministic system is persistent because of the effect of the jump noise. In Fig. 2 , the intensities of the noises are \u03c3 1 = 0.08 and \u03b3 (u) = 0.2, then we obtain that 2) goes to extinction with probability one. The red lines, the green lines and the blue lines are solutions of system (1.2), the corresponding deterministic system and the system with white noise, respectively.\n\nThe disease I of system (1.2) is persistent with probability one. The red lines, the green lines and the blue lines are solutions of system (1.2), the corresponding deterministic system and the system with white noise, respectively. and the condition (1) of Theorem 5.1 holds. Therefore, the disease I is persistent with probability one.\n\n(2) Let \u00b5 = 0.26 and the other parameters are the same as those in Fig. 1 . Considering different values of \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 , then we can observe the effects of the validity period of the vaccination \u03c4 1 to system (1.2) (See Fig. 3) .\n\nFrom Figs. 1-3, we achieve that the intensity of L\u00e9vy noise \u03b3 (u) and the validity period of the vaccination \u03c4 1 can greatly influence the extinction and persistence of the disease I.\n\nA stochastic delay epidemic model is proposed with vaccination and generalized nonlinear incidence rate. The effects of L\u00e9vy jumps are considered in this model. The existence of a unique global solution is proven. Sufficient conditions that guarantee diseases to be extinct and persistent in the mean are given. From the analysis and discussion, we derive that noise intensity and the validity period of vaccination greatly influence the extinction and persistence of diseases. Finally, some interesting issues merit further investigations. In this paper, we obtain sufficient conditions for the persistence and extinction of the model. However, whether the threshold value could be derived is an interesting issue. In addition, if we also consider the effects of non-autonomous environment to the proposal of epidemic model, how will the properties change? We will investigate these questions in our future work.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."}
