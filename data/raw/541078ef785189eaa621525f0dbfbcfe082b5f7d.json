{"title": "", "body": "BK virus is detectable both in the blood and the urine. The virus first appears in the urine (viruria) and then is detectable in the blood (viremia) several weeks later. The preferred screening test at most transplant centers is the blood BK quantitative viral DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The sensitivity between the serum and urine BK viral testing is the same at 100%, but the specificity of serum testing is 90% versus 80% for urine testing. BK viremia is also a better predictor of BK nephropathy.\n\nThere is an alternative strategy that does use BK viruria for screening because it appears earlier that BK viremia. Once BK viruria is present, the clinician considers lowering immunosuppression and now switching to BK viremia for screening. Recommended screening times are monthly for the first 6 months and then every 3 months up to 24 months post transplant.\n\nA BK viral load greater than 10,000 copies is strongly associated with BK nephropathy. BK viruria greater than 1,000,000 copies is associated with BK nephropathy. The next step is a kidney transplant biopsy, which is the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis and see the degree of nephropathy.\n\nBiopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of BK-associated nephropathy. BK virus can induce a number of characteristic changes on kidney biopsy, including intranuclear viral inclusions, tubular injury/tubulitis, and tubulointerstitial inflammation. Because none of these kidney biopsy findings are pathognomonic for BK-associated nephropathy, the diagnosis must be confirmed by demonstrating antibodies against BK with immunohistochemistry.\n\nCytologic examination of the urine can detect BK-infected cells (\"decoy cells\"). These characteristic cells have enlarged nuclei with a single, basophilic, intranuclear inclusion. Identification of decoy cells is sensitive, but not specific, for the diagnosis of BK-associated nephropathy.\n\nThe goal in treating BK-associated nephropathy is to eradicate the virus while maintaining kidney function and preventing acute or chronic rejection. Most treatments of BK-associated nephropathy involve reducing immunosuppression to permit native, immune-mediated handling of the BK virus. Possible strategies include discontinuation of a single immunosuppressive agent, reduction of dosages, and steroid avoidance. Antiviral therapy with leflunomide or cidofovir has been used in conjunction with decreasing immunosuppressants in some instances. IVIG also has been used, particularly in patients with concomitant acute rejection.\n\n13. Can patients with graft failure resulting from BK nephropathy be retransplanted? Yes. Transplant nephrectomy is usually not indicated. Ideally the BK viral load should be undetectable in the serum by PCR at the time of transplant.\n\nCMV is a member of the genus Herpesvirus and belongs to the family Herpesviridae. It is composed of a double-stranded DNA genome. Exposure to the virus, as indicated by immunoglobulin G anti-CMV antibodies, is present in more than two-thirds of donors and recipients prior to transplantation. CMV can be transmitted from the donor either by blood transfusions or by the transplanted kidney. Symptomatic CMV infection occurs in 20% to 60% of all transplant recipients and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Risk factors associated with the development of CMV infections post transplantation include lymphocyte-depleting induction therapy, high-dose MMF, and the absence of adequate antiviral prophylaxis.\n\n15. What groups are at highest risk from CMV infections?\n\nHistorically, groups who are CMV donor positive and CMV recipient negative (CMV D1/R-) are at greatest risk for severe \"primary\" infection during the first 3 months post transplantation.\n\nCMV has been associated with atherosclerosis and chronic allograft rejection. CMV is associated with several other vascular injuries, including transplant glomerulopathy, hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy, and transplant renal artery stenosis.\n\nCMV infection implies the detection of CMV via culture or PCR. By comparison, CMV disease requires clinical signs and symptoms, in addition to viral detection. The clinical signs and symptoms of CMV disease include fever, leukopenia, or organ involvement (hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, chorioretinitis, etc.). The quantitative assessment of viral load via PCR can help determine the clinical phenotype. CMV DNA levels .500 copies/mmg of total DNA in peripheral blood correlates with clinically evident disease.\n\nThere are two strategies for CMV prevention; antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive monitoring/therapy. Antiviral prophylaxis means giving valganciclovir without any evidence of CMV infection or viremia. Preemptive monitoring/therapy means reserving antiviral therapy for patients who develop CMV viremia. Preemptive monitoring is associated with lower drug costs and adverse toxicities. However, there are increased laboratory surveillance and logistical labor. Antiviral prophylaxis, on the other hand, is more expensive and puts patients at risk for drug toxicity but is associated with decreased reactivation of other herpesvirus, lower rates of opportunistic infections, and allograft loss. The drug of choice for prophylaxis is valganciclovir. The duration of CMV prophylaxis depends on the CMV serology of the donor and recipient. D1/R-prophylaxis lasts 6 months, and all others last 3 months.\n\nGanciclovir and valganciclovir are the most commonly used agents for the treatment of CMV infection. Both drugys must be dosed based on renal function. Valganciclovir is indicated in patients with mild to moderate disease. The treatment dose with normal kidney function is 900 mg twice daily. The dose needs to be reduced in kidney failure. Ganciclovir is indicated in more severe disease, those with high viral load, or those with questionable gastrointestinal absorption. Treatment is usually continued until the viral load is undetectable for 2 weeks, then the patient is switched to 1 to 3 months of prophylactic therapy. If the viral load does not change with appropriately dosed ganciclovir after 2 to 3 weeks, then ganciclovir resistance should be assessed by viral genotype testing. If resistance is discovered, the usual strategy is to increase the ganciclovir dose or use foscarnet or cidofovir. However, these are nephrotoxic. The other aspect of treatment is the careful reduction of immunosuppression.\n\nEBV is a member of the herpesvirus family and one of the most common human viruses. Most people become infected with EBV sometime during their lives. It can flourish in the setting of immunosuppression and is associated with PTLD.\n\nLive vaccines are contraindicated after transplantation and should be administered prior. If a live vaccine is given prior to transplantation, the patient cannot be on immunosuppression and therefore transplanted for a minimum of 4 weeks. Inactivated vaccines can be given post transplant. The time frame to be able to receive a vaccination post transplant is 3 to 6 months. Close contacts should also be appropriately vaccinated. Table 60 .1 shows a table of commonly questioned vaccinations. The inhaled influenza vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine and is contraindicated. Patients traveling abroad should consider visiting a travel clinic for appropriate vaccinations and prophylaxis as needed. "}
