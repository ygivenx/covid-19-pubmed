{"title": "Diagnosis and Management of Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Evidence-Based Practice", "body": "Respiratory pathogens reach the lungs through inhalation of microorganisms, aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, and hematogenous spread from other bodily sites of infection. 5 CAP refers to pneumonia that is acquired outside health care organizations, including hospitals, nursing homes, and other long-term care facilities.Although antibiotic resistance has increasingly become a recognized problem in pneumonia, older age and underlying disease, not antibiotic resistance, are more important factors in mortality. 1 Despite advances in diagnostic testing, the causative agent in as many as 50% of clients with CAP is not identified even when extensive testing has been performed. 6 Unfortunately, no diagnostic test exists that can identify all potential pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae have been the most commonly identified organisms, although their incidence depends on the type of diagnostic testing and criteria used (Table 1) . Legionella spp and variable infections are also common. Infections by gram-negative bacilli may be increasing in outpatient settings because of the complexity of the clients treated outside of health care settings. 6 \n\nThe purpose of this article is to evaluate the new Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society Guideline for Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Adults for nurse practitioner (NP) practice using evidence-based practice principles.The major recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, site of care, and prevention are also summarized. In general, the guideline meets the criteria of evaluation of practice guidelines, although the methods used for the literature search are not adequately described.The guideline was not developed with the input from primary care providers; however, it is appropriate for NPs who work in a variety of settings, including primary care.\n\nKeywords: Adults, community-acquired pneumonia, evidenced-based practice, practice guidelines \n\nTo eliminate some of the confusion arising from multiple national practice guidelines, the IDSA/ATS published a joint clinical practice guideline in 2007. 4 This guideline is geared toward emergency medicine and primary care practitioners and hospitalists, and it is intended primarily for CAP. Initial diagnosis and treatment decisions are based on assessment of severity. Site-of-care decisions and outpatient treatment versus hospitalization should be based on severity-of-illness scores, such as the CURB-65 criteria (confusion, uremia, respiratory rate, low blood pressure, age 65 years or older), or prognostic models, such as the Pneumonia Severity Index.These objective measures of severity should be supplemented by subjective factors, such as the ability to take medications safely and reliably. Clients with septic shock should be directly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for vasopressors, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. In addition, any clients with three or more of the minor criteria for severe CAP (Table 2) should also be considered for admission to the ICU or high-level monitoring unit.\n\nThe diagnosis of CAP is based on presenting signs and symptoms, such as cough, fever, sputum, pleuritic chest pain, and presence of rales or bronchial breath sounds; however, a demonstrable infiltrate by chest X-ray (or other imaging technique) is required to differentiate CAP from other causes of cough and fever (eg, acute bronchitis). Chest radiographs may also be useful in identification of causative agent, prognosis, alternative diagnoses, and associated conditions. In cases when the chest X-ray is not definitive, although the client's toxic condition is suggestive of pneumonia, it may be prudent to treat presumptively for 24 hours and repeat the imaging in 1 to 2 days. It is important to keep in mind that some clients because of age, immune status, and hydration may not present with typical clinical features, radiograph findings, or both.\n\nRoutine diagnostic tests (eg, cultures, Gram staining) to identify causative agents are optional in nonhospitalized clients with CAP because studies have shown that that these tests are infrequently done, yet clients do well with empirical antibiotic treatment. Exceptions to this recommendation, such as influenza that can be tested using rapid point-of-care tests, do exist. Specific recommendations for additional diagnostic testing are provided in Table  3 . Suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, community-acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), fungal infections, avian influenza, and disease caused by agents used in bioterrorism should be verified with further diagnostic testing. Moreover, in situations when antibiotic treatment would likely be altered, investigation for specific causative agents should be undertaken, especially when the presence of specific pathogens is suspected based on the clinical presentation.This allows the clinician to narrow or completely alter antibiotic therapy, improving the likelihood of treatment success. Clearly, extensive diagnostic testing should be indicated for critically ill clients, and the guideline provides additional information about the circumstances in which other testing, such as blood cultures, respiratory tract specimen Gram stain and culture, and antigen tests, should be done. The mainstay of pneumonia treatment is antimicrobial therapy.Appropriate antibiotic selection is based on prediction of most likely causative pathogen (Table 1 and  Table 4 ) and antibiotic susceptibility. For most clients in the outpatient setting, antibiotic selection will be empirical until more rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are developed (Table 5) . Other factors to consider in selection include pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, compliance, safety, and cost. Local susceptibility patterns, if available from local or state health departments, should be considered in antibiotic selection.When the specific pathogen(s) is known, antimicrobial therapy should be directed toward that causative agent (Table 6 ). 1 Clients should be treated with antibiotics for at least 5 days, be afebrile for 48 to 72 hours, and have no more than one sign of clinical instability (heart rate \u0545 100 beats/minute, respiratory rate \u0545 24 breaths/minute, systolic blood pressure \u0546 90 mm Hg, arterial oxygen saturation \u0546 90% or partial pressure of oxygen \u0546 60 mm Hg on room air, ability to maintain oral intake, normal mental status). Clients with persistent clinical instability may need to be hospitalized or treated for a longer duration.\n\nPrevention of pneumonia is also addressed in the IDSA/ATS guideline (Table 7) .Vaccination status should be assessed at the time of hospitalization for all persons, and vaccination can be performed at discharge or in the outpatient setting. Smoking cessation is also a critical part of prevention. Respiratory hygiene measures, including hand hygiene and masks and tissue for patients with a cough, should be used in outpatient and inpatient settings.\n\nA number of criteria have been identified for the evaluation of clinical practice guidelines. [8] [9] [10] [11] According to the components in the AGREE (appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation) instrument, appraisal should address the following: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity and presentation, applicability, and editorial independence.\n\nIn relation to scope and purpose, the IDSA/ATS guideline has a clear aim: diagnosis and treatment of CAP in adults. Institutionalized and immunocompromised adults are excluded. Relevant clinical questions are addressed, such as antimicrobial selection and determination of site of care. Stakeholder involvement focuses on how well the guideline represents the views of those who will be using it.The investigators readily acknowledge that, although the guideline is intended for use by primary care, emergency care, and hospitalist physicians, those specialists were not involved in the development. NPs, other primary care providers, and clients were not included either. Finally, no information is available about pretesting of the guideline before dissemination for use.\n\nRigor refers to the process used to identify, select, and synthesize the evidence used to develop the guide-line.The strategy used to search for evidence, including search terms, sources used, and the dates covered, is not provided in the guideline. Information on the inclusion or exclusion of pieces of evidence is also not available. The process for formulation and grading of each recommendation is described.The committee used a three-tier scale to grade the recommendations: high (evidence from well-conducted, randomized controlled trials), moderate (evidence from well-designed, controlled trails without randomization), and low (evidence from case studies and expert opinion).The final grading of Clarity and presentation pertains to the language and format of the guideline.The recommendations are concrete with clear descriptions of the diagnosis and management of CAP. Options for diagnosis and treatment are provided.The recommendations are easily identified.The presentation could be enhanced by dissemination of a quick reference guide.\n\nApplicability of the guideline refers to the organizational, behavioral, and cost implications of implementing the guideline.This guideline will potentially require some changes and will have cost implications for some clients and practices; however, these are probably not significant in most situations (see \"Summary and Conclusions\").\n\nFinally, editorial independence deals with the independence of the recommendations and acknowledgement of any possible conflicts of interest by those developing the guideline. No explicit statement acknowledges the funding source for the guideline development, although presumably it was funded by the two societies. Conflicts of interest, specifically funding by pharmaceutical companies, are acknowledged in the guideline.\n\nThe IDSA/ATS guideline for CAP provides a comprehensive overview of diagnosis and treatment, including evaluation of the severity of CAP and determination of site of treatment.The scope and purpose, clarity, and presentation and applicability are strengths of this guideline. Presence of comorbidities such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancies; asplenia; immunosuppressing conditions; use of immunosuppressing drugs; or use of antimicrobials within the previous 3 mo (in which case an alternative from a different class should be selected): a respiratory fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, or levofloxacin (750 mg) or a \u2424-lactam plus a macrolide 3. In regions with a high rate (\u03fe25%) of infection with high-level (MIC \u0546 16 g/mL) macrolideresistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, consider use of alternative agents listed above in (2) for patients without comorbidities\n\nA respiratory fluoroquinolone or a \u2424-lactam plus a macrolide\n\nA \u2424-lactam (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ampicillin-sulbactam) plus either azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (for penicillin-allergic clients, a respiratory fluoroquinolone and aztreonam are recommended)\n\nIf Pseudomonas is a consideration: an antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal \u2424-lactam (piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, or meropenem) plus either ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin (750 mg) or the above \u2424-lactam plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin or the above \u2424-lactam plus an aminoglycoside and an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone (for penicillin-allergic patients, substitute aztreonam for above \u2424-lactam)\n\nIf community-acquired MRSA is a consideration, add vancomycin or linezolid However, several weaknesses do exist.The investigators acknowledge that there was no input from primary care and emergency department physicians and hospitalists in the development of the guideline. In addition, although the approach to grading each recommendation is outlined, the methods for literature review need to be articulated more clearly.The investigators do not provide explicit information about how the articles used in the guideline were identified and selected.This additional information would help practitioners be able to evaluate for any potential biases in the sources used for the guideline. The next step is for individual NPs to evaluate the guideline to (1) decide whether the strengths outweigh the weaknesses and (2) determine whether the guideline is applicable to their setting and clientele. Straus et al 10 recommend addressing the four \"Killer Bs\" as a way to evaluate the appropriateness of the guideline for implementation in various settings. Is the burden of illness, or the number of clients with this disease, too low to warrant use of the guideline? Are the beliefs of the clients served about the type and value of interventions or their potential consequences incompatible with the guideline? Are the opportunity costs associated with guideline implementation a bad bargain? In other words, would the resources of the practice or community be better spent elsewhere? Are the barriers (geographic, organizational, cultural, legally, etc) so high that it is not worth using the guideline? Implementation of the guideline will be Continued from page 640 Diagnosis and Management problematic in some settings (eg, those in which clients have financial barriers). If clients are being treated in the outpatient setting, inexpensive antibiotics (eg, doxycycline) can be selected; however, the need for chest radiography may be problematic. In summary, despite some weaknesses, including the acknowledged weakness that no primary care providers were involved in the development of the guideline, the CAP guideline has many strengths and in general is applicable to many NPs who work in primary care and urgent care settings. NPs are encouraged to review the guideline and determine whether it is relevant to their practice setting and clients."}
