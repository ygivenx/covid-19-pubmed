We extend previous frameworks to study how the censored generation-75 interval distributions change over time and compare this distribution with the backward 76 generation-interval distribution. We classify spatial effects on generation intervals into three 77 levels (egocentric, local, and global) and discuss how they affect observed generation-interval 78 distributions. Finally, we compare two methods for accounting for temporal bias and test 79 our prediction using simulations. course of infection (e.g., duration of latent and infectious periods) and the level of infectious-88 ness, which can depend both on biological infectiousness as well as contact patterns. 89 Assuming that the individual properties are independent of risk of infection, the population-90 level kernel is given by integrating over these individual variations:\n\nThe population-level kernel describes the rate at which secondary infections are expected 92 to be caused by an an infected individual, on average. where f (a) represents a probability 93 density over a (possibly multi-dimensional) aspect space. 94 Assuming that a population mixes homogeneously, we can write:\n\nwhere R 0 = K(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 is the basic reproductive number (the expected number of secondary 96 cases caused by a randomly chosen infectious individual in a fully susceptible population), 97 and g(\u03c4 ) is the expected time distribution of those cases (the intrinsic generation-interval 98 distribution).\n\nIn a homogeneously mixing population, current disease incidence at time t, i(t), is the 100 product of the current infectiousness of individuals infected in the past and the current 101 proportion of the population susceptible, S(t).\n\n102\n\nwhere R = S(t)R 0 is the effective reproductive number.

The censored generation-interval distribution, c t (\u03c4 ), describes all cohorts 120 infected at time s < t; thus, the censored generation-interval distribution is just the average 121 of the backward distributions of these cohorts, weighted by incidence:\n\nFor a single outbreak, the observed mean generation interval through contact tracing 123 will always be shorter than the mean intrinsic generation interval ( Figure 2 ). There are two 124 reasons for this phenomenon. First, longer generation intervals are more likely to be missed 125 due to right censoring (and short generation intervals are more likely to be observed). In 126 particular, when an epidemic is growing exponentially (i(t) = i(0) exp(rt)), the initial cen-127 sored (or backward) generation-interval distribution is just the intrinsic generation-interval 128 distribution discounted by the rate of exponential growth (18):\n\nA deterministic simulation confirms that the censored generation-interval distribution has 130 the same mean as the backward generation-interval distribution during this period ( Figure 2 ).\n\nSecond, the decreasing number of susceptibles over the course of an epidemic makes long 132 infections less likely to occur (16). Overall, we expect naively using the observed generation-133 interval distribution, to underestimate the reproductive number. Infected individuals may contact the same susceptible individual multiple times, but only 136 the first effective contact gives rise to infection in a given individual (after this, they are no 137 longer susceptible). Therefore, we expect realized generation intervals to be shorter than 138 intrinsic generation intervals, on average, in a limited contact network.\n\nTo explore the effect of multiple contacts on realized generation intervals, we first consider 140 the infection process from an \"egocentric\" point of view, taking into account infectious 141 contacts made by a single infector. We define the egocentric kernel as the rate at which 142 secondary infections are realized by a single primary case with aspect a in the absence of 143 other infectors:\n\nwhere k(\u03c4 ; a) is the individual-level intrinsic kernel and e \u2212\u03b4(a) \u03c4 0 k(s;a)ds is the probability that 145 a susceptible acquaintance has not yet been contacted by a particular infected individual.\n\nThe dilution term, \u03b4(a), models how contacts are distributed among susceptible acquain-147 tances.\n\nThroughout this paper, we assume that there is a constant per-pair contact rate \u03bb. In Figure 2 : Temporal variation in the mean observed generation interval. A deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model was simulated using Ebola-like parameters (20): mean latent period 1/\u03c3 = 5 days, mean infectious period 1/\u03b3 = 11.4 days, and the basic reproductive number R 0 = 2. The backward and the censored mean generation interval were calculated over the course of an epidemic. The dotted horizontal line represents the mean intrinsic generation interval.\n\n6 .

This assumption can be relaxed by allowing 152 for asymmetry (19) or heterogeneity (27; 28) in contact rates; for brevity, we do not pursue 153 these directions here.\n\nThe population-level egocentric kernel is found by integrating over individual variations:\n\n(19) used this same kernel (also assuming a constant per-pair contact rate) to study the 157 effect of network structure on the estimate of reproductive number.

Generation intervals are also shortened by 193 indirect connections: a susceptible individual can be infected through another route before 194 the focal individual makes infectious contacts. Simulations on a small homogeneous network 195 confirm this additional effect (Fig. 3, right panel) . 196 In general, spatial reduction in the mean generation interval can be viewed as an effect Since the right-censoring effect is a sampling bias, we typically want to correct for it.\n\nIn contrast, spatial effects have the same effect on how the epidemic spreads as they do on 219 observed generation intervals. We therefore expect that starting from observed generation 220 intervals and correcting for the right-censoring effect, will allow us to estimate an \"effective\" 221 generation interval that accurately reflects dynamics of spread. When temporal correction 222 is performed early in an outbreak, during the exponential growth phase, the effective distri-223 bution should incorporate egocentric and local spatial effects but not the global effects; we 224 expect this distribution to correctly link r and R. We will call the temporally corrected ef-225 fective generation-interval distribution g eff (\u03c4 ). In a large homogeneously mixing population, Here, we investigate two methods for correcting for temporal bias in contact-tracing data 230 (see Methods for details). We refer to the first method as the population-level method as Using the observed generation-interval distributions (based on the first 1000 generation intervals) without correcting for right-censoring severely underestimates the reproductive number. Similarly, using the intrinsic generation-interval distribution overestimates the reproductive number because it fails to account for local spatial effects; the egocentric distribution corrects for this only partially. Both population-level and individual-level methods provide estimates of reproductive number that are consistent with the empirical estimates, which we define as the average number of secondary cases generated by the first 100 infected individuals, but the individual-level method is more precise. Boxplots are generated using 100 stochastic simulations of the SEIR model on an empirical network using Ebola-like parameters (20): mean latent period 1/\u03c3 = 5 days and mean infectious period 1/\u03b3 = 11.4 days. Per-pair contact rate \u03bb = 0.08 days \u22121 is chosen to be sufficiently high such that differences are clear.\n\n.

We compare two methods for estimating the effective generation-interval distribution and 298 assume that the effective generation-interval distribution follows a gamma distribution. The 299 gamma approximation of the generation interval distribution has been widely used due to its 300 simplicity (31; 6; 32; 33; 34); we previously thought that summarizing the entire distribution 301 with two moments (mean and variance) is sufficient to understand the role of generation-302 interval distributions in linking r and R (13). However, further investigation of our methods 303 suggests that making a wrong distributional assumption can lead to biased estimates of 304 the mean and CV of a generation-interval distribution (Appendix A.3), even though the 305 gamma distribution \"looks\" indistinguishable from the shape of the intrinsic generation-306 interval distribution (derived from the SEIR model). These results are particularly alarming population structure can lead to subexponential growth (35; 36; 37; 38; 39; 40); we therefore expect our simulations on an empirical network to be better characterized by subexponential 314 growth models (40). However, our simulations suggest that the initial exponential growth 315 assumption still provides a viable approach for estimating the reproductive number.\n\nContact tracing provides an effective way of collecting epidemiological data and control- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Fitting directly to cumulative 417 incidence can lead to overly confident results (55); instead we fit interval incidence x(t) = 418 c(t + \u2206t) \u2212 c(t), where \u2206t is 1 day, to daily incidence, assuming that daily incidence follows 419 a negative binomial distribution. We estimate the logistic parameters r, K, c 0 , and \u03b8 by 420 maximum likelihood. Fitting time window is defined from the last trough before the peak 421 of an epidemic to the first day after the peak of an epidemic.
