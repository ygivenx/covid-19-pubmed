{"title": "Significance of Viral Glycoproteins for Infectivity and Pathogenicity > \"", "body": "A number of viruses possess in addition to the minimal requirement of viruses, the genomic nucleic acid and its surrounding capsid, an envelope, which represents a virusspecific altered cell membrane. It is taken up during virus maturation in the so-called budding process as an integral and essential constituent of the virus particle. As with cellular membranes the envelope consists of a lipid bilayer in which nearly all of the cellular proteins are exchanged for virus-specific glycoproteins, which appear in the various types of enveloped viruses as protrusions of differing structures and morphology. Additionally, in some enveloped viruses, the inner side of the lipid bilayer is covered by a non-glycosylated membrane or matrix (M) protein (for literature see Ratt and Klenk, 1977; Klenk and Ratt, 1980) .\n\nThe viral glycoproteins possess similar biological functions. As surface components of the virus they represent those antigens against which the immune response of the organism is mainly directed, inducing the B-and T-cell reactivities necessary for protection. These well known properties of the viral glycoproteins, which are already utilized in the development of subunit vaccines, are not the subject of this review. This contribution will, however, concentrate on the role of the glycoproteins in the initiation of infection, making these molecules the determinants of pathogenicity.\n\nLike cellular membrane proteins, the viral glycoproteins are synthesized on membrane-bound polyribosomes. The translocation of the growing polypeptide chain through the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is made possible by the presence of a signal peptide on the amino terminus of the molecule. The signal peptide is eliminated by cotranslational proteolytic cleavage. Likewise the first step of glycosylation occurs cotranslationally, at least with those glycoproteins containing N-glycosidically linked carbohydrate side chains. In this process mannose-rich oligosaccharides are assembled on a dolichol pyrophosphate carrier, and then transferred en bloc to the nascent polypeptide chain (for literature see Schwarz and Datema, 1982) .\n\nThe glycoproteins are further modified during transport from their site of synthesis to the site of virus maturation. These posttranslational modifications include the processing of the carbohydrate side chains and a further limited proteolytic cleavage. Glycosylation and posttranslational proteolytic cleavage are, for most viral glycoproteins, essential for the expression of their biological activity. In addition to this some glycoproteins are further modified by sulfatation and fatty acid acylation, the significance of which is not yet fully understood Schmidt, 1983) . Little is also known about the cellular transport of glycoproteins. Furthermore, it is still an open question as to how the budding process, which leads to the release of newly synthesized virus particles, is triggered.\n\nAn important function of the viral glycoproteins is their ability to initiate the processes of infection. Firstly, they are responsible for attachment of viral particles to specific receptors of the host cell surface, and secondly they induce the penetration of the virus genome into the cell. This latter step involves fusion of the virus envelope with the cellular membrane (see Klenk and Rott, 1980) and appears to be the simplest way for the virus genome to pass through the barrier of two membranes.\n\nDepending upon the virus family, one or two glycoproteins are involved in the adsorption and penetration of enveloped viruses. The mechanisms underlying these processes have been most intensively studied with influenza A viruses. The knowledge gained from these studies will be therefore discussed in greater depth in the following sections.\n\nInfluenza A viruses contain on their surfaces two different types of glycoproteins, the haemagglutinin and the neuraminidase. For a number of influenza virus subtypes the amino acid sequences of the haemagglutinins have been elucidated (Literature see Lamb, 1983 ) and the tertiary structure has been determined by X-ray crystallography (Wilson et aI., 1981) . It was shown that the haemagglutinin is a trimer consisting of three identical monomers. Each monomer is comprised of two polypeptides, HAl and HA 2 , held together by disulfide bonds. HAl and HA 2 are derived by posttranslational proteolytic cleavage of a precursor molecule HA. Each polypeptide comprises two structurally distinct regions. HA 2 forms a triple-stranded coiled-coil of alpha helices extending 76 Afrom the membrane. The amino terminus of the HA 2 exposed by the proteolytic cleavage has a highly conserved hydrophobic amino acid sequence. The larger polypeptide HAl forms a globular domain of anti-parallel~-sheets, which is positioned on top of the HA 2 stem. It contains the variable antigenic determinants responsible for the characteristic recurrence of influenza infections in man, and the receptor binding site of the molecule (Literature see Skehel et aI., 1984) . Each polypeptide has an unusual loop-like topology, which starts at the membrane, extends 135 A distally and then folds back to enter the envelope. Both complex and mannose-rich carbohydrate side chains are present on the surface of the trimer, with only the latter type being specifically located in niches at the interfaces between different domains (Keil et aI., 1984) .\n\nDuring infection the influenza virus particles are adsorbed to neuraminic acid containing receptors of the host cell through the receptor binding site of the haemagglutinino Under acidic conditions a change in the conformation of the molecule occurs (Skehel et aI., 1982) , through which the hydrophobic region at the amino terminus of HA 2 , the so-called fusion peptide, becomes exposed. This leads, possibly via a still hypothetical secondary receptor, to close contact between the lipid lamellae of the virus and cellular membranes, resulting in membrane fusion. The secondary receptor appears to become available in some instances through the action of the virus neuraminidase (Huang et aI., 1981) . Since the fusion peptide becomes exposed after the posttranslational proteolytic cleavage of the haemagglutinin, the fusion capacity of the molecule is activated only by this process. Cleavage, therefore, is an essential condition for the infectivity of the virus (Klenk et aI., 1975; Lazaroioitz and Choppin, 1975) .\n\nThe influenza virus haemagglutinin is activated in the same way as a number of precursors of enzymes and hormones, e.g. proinsulin, progastrin and proopiomelanocortin (for literature see Docherty and Steiner, 1982) . In all these cases trypsin-like endoproteases attack the precursor at a given cleavage site behind an arginine. This is followed by carboxypeptidase cleavage, which eliminates the peptide linking the two polypeptides (Garten and Klenk, 1983 ).\n\nSince the activating proteases are cellular enzymes cleavage of the haemagglutinin depends strictly on the type of host cell. Virus particles, which have been produced in a host cell deficient in activating proteases and which have an uncleaved haemagglutinin and are non-infectious can be transformed into the infectious form by in vitro treatment with appropriate enzymes (Klenk et aI., 1975; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975) .\n\nMicroorganisms may represent one source of enzymes capable of proteolytic activation (see below).\n\nHaemagglutinins from different strains of influenza viruses differ in their sensitivity to proteolytic cleavage in a variety of host cells. This correlates with the spread of the virus in the host organism. Influenza viruses have been isolated from man, horse, swine, mink, seal and whale as well as from a great variety of different avian species. The infection in mammals is usually confined to the respiratory tract, while in birds, there is a systemic infection which has been denominated by the suffix \"pest\". Mammalian viruses have always been isolated from individuals with clinical manifestations and the isolated virus has usually been pathogenic. Most avian viruses, on the other hand, do not cause any, or cause only, mild signs of disease with local infections of the respiratory or intestinal tract being clinically inapparent. All highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses belong to the subtypes H5 and H7 (Ratt and Klenk, 1987) . The differences in cleavability are based on structural differences in the cleavage site of the haemagglutinins (Fig. 1) . Sequence analyses have shown that in the haemagglutinins of the mammalian viruses and those of the apathogenic avian influenza viruses, the polypeptides HAl and HA 2 are linked through a single arginine residue. On the other hand, the haemagglutinins of the pathogenic avian influenza viruses have an intervening sequence of several basic amino acids between HAl and HA 2 in which the sequences lysine-arginine or arginine-arginine regularly appear (see Rott and Klenk, 1986) . Although the haemagglutinins of all influenza viruses are cleaved by the same general mechanism, the available data indicate that differences in specificity of the proteases exist, such that either a single arginine or the basic pairs, lysine-arginine and arginine-arginine, can be recognized and eliminated by the cleavage reaction. The differences in the manifestation of infection are therefore due to the structural differences of the haernagglutinins alone (Bosch et al., 1981; Garten et al., 1981) . The structural differences, upon which the different proteolytic activities depend, are restricted therefore to a small, but functionally important part of the molecule (Rott and Klenk, 1986 ). The haemaggJutinin therefore becomes a critical determinant of pathogenicity.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that the substitution of a single amino acid in the cleavage site can influence the cleavability of the haemagglutinin and as a result the pathogenicity of the virus. In addition to mutations in the cleavage site itself, a mutation in close proximity to the cleavage site can also affect the activation of the molecule. For instance, after adaptation of an influenza virus to MDCK cells, the protease of which is unable to activate its haemagglutinin, it is possible to select a mutant with a haemagglutinin which has become cleavable in these cells, even though the cleavage site itself has not been changed. The only mutation that was found was the replacement of a histidine by an arginine at a position approximately 10 Adistant from the cleavage site (Rott et al., 1984) . The three dimensional structure of the haernagglutinin suggests that, because of this amino acid substitution, the stability of the cleavage site was changed. As a result, the cleavage site became exposed to the activating protease of the new host cell. These experiments are of general significance in that they show that influenza viruses with a broadened cell spectrum can be selected by adaptation to a novel host.\n\nThere is evidence that the acquisition of pathogenicity by an H5N2 virus responsible for a fowl pest-like outbreak in the USA in 1983 was caused by a similar event (Kawaoka et al., 1984) . Comparative studies of different isolates indicate that during the epidemic the virus changed from being one of low pathogenicity to one of high pathogenicity. The haemagglutinin of the original low pathogenic virus had a limited cleavability, whereas the haemagglutinin of the highly pathogenic variant had become cleavable in a wide range of different host cells. Sequence analyses showed that the pathogenic variant possessed a cleavage site with the structure lysine-lysine-lysine-arginine, i.e. a cleavage site recognizable by ubiquitous cellular proteases. Surprisingly, the original low pathogenic virus had the same cleavage site, but this was apparently masked by a neighbouring oligosaccharide side-chain which was lost as the result of a point mutation. \n\nThi s data, taken togeth er , und erlines the impo rta nt rol e of proteolytic activation of th e haemagglutinin in path ogenicity. Sprea d of an influenza virus, which is activated by proteo lytic cleavage of th e haemagglutinin in only a limited number of cells is inhibited as soon as the virus infects a cell which is un able to activat e the HA (Fig. 2) . The result is a local infectio n, whi ch is seen regularl y in mammals and also in birds infected by apa thoge nic influe nza viruses. O n th e other hand , cleavability of the haemagglutinin in a wide spectru m of different cells, as is th e case with th e path ogeni c avian influenza viruses perm its a rap id production of infectiou s virus in all tissues to high a mo unts. T his a llows sp rea d of the viru s th rou ghout th e o rga nism and result s in a fata l systemic infectio n (Ratt , 1979) . Th e co ncept for thi s relat ively simple mecha nism of pathogenicity cou ld be verified by in vitro ex periments with o rgan cultures (Bosch et aI., 1979; Rott et aI., 198 0 ).\n\nMore recentl y it has been found th at som e strains of Staph ylococcus aureus secrete serine prote ases that acti vat e infectivity of influenza viruses by pro teo lytic cleavage of the haemagglutinin. Th e pr esence of the bac terial enzymes in th e virus producing system enables the virus to und ergo multiple step repl icati on in cells which do not possess appro priate proteases. Co rrespo ndingly, co-infectio n of mice with influenza viru s an d Staph . aureus result ed in an eno rmo us increase in tit re in the lun g with ex tensive lesions in the lung tissue an d resulted in deat h of th e mice (Tashiro et aI., 1987a, b) . Development of influenza pneumonia could be pr evented by treatment of infected mice with a prot ease inh ibit or (Tashiro et al., 198 7c) . Th ese findings confirm again th e signific ance of th e hae magg lutinin as a determinant of path ogenicity. They co uld also ex plain th e high mor bidity and mortality observed, e.g. in human s, after co-infection with Staph. aureus and influenza viruse s (Robertson et aI., 1958) . Finall y, th ese ob servations also suggest th at particularly serious infectio ns in humans, as were observed during the \"Spanish influenza \" epidemic of 191 8/1 9, are caused by a similar synergism between an influenza viru s stra in and a relati vely harmless ubiquitous microorgam sm.\n\nThe fusogenic glycoproteins of man y o ther viru ses are synt hesized as pre cursor molecules and are acti vated by proteol ytic clea vage at arginine residues. It ma y be assumed that in these ca ses, as with influenza viruses, a hydr ophobic region, which could act as a fusogen becomes exp osed. Such glycoproteins include the F-protein of p aramyxoviruses, the S-protein of coronaviruses and the envelo pe glycoprotein of retroviruses (Fig. 3 ). In agreement with the observation made with th e haemagglutinin . . . Gl y-Gly-Arg-Arg-Gl n-Ar g-Arg'\" -Ph e-lle .\n\n.. . Gly-Gly-Gly -Lys -Gln-Gl y-Arg \\J -Leu-Il e .\n\n.. .

Gly -Thr-Arg -Ar g-Phe-Ar g-Arg'\" -Ser-lle . .. of influenza viru ses, viru s particles containing uncleaved precursor glycoproteins, can be obtained from appropriate cells if th e clea vage site itself consists of a single arginine. An example is the F-prorein of Sendai virus, and it should be pointed out that this was the first viral glycoprotein shown to be activated by proteolytic cleavage (Homa and Ohuchi, 1973; Scheid and Cb op pin, 1974). In this F-protein and those of other paramyxoviruses a fter clea vage a hydrophobic fusion peptide becomes exposed which has an amino ac id seq ue nce simila r to th e a mino terminus of HA 2 of influenza viru ses (C ething et al., 197 8 ) . Newcastle disease virus, another pa ramyxovirus, comprises a who le ser ies of strains wh ich, like th e avi an in fluenza viru ses, differ widel y in pathogenicit y fo r chickens. Here again diff eren ces in pathogenicity ca n be correlated with the cleavability of th e F-protein (N agai et al. , 19 76) . Sequence analyses ha ve revealed th at the apa thogenic st rains co ntain single a rginine residues and the pathogenic strains paired ba sic residues at their cleav age site, exactly as has been observed w ith the avian influenza viruses (Fig. 3) .\n\nIt is of interest that th e infectivity of rotaviruses, which do not contain an envelope, is activated by trypsin-cleav age of one of its ca psid proteins, VP3 (Estes et a l., 1981). In genetic studies, VP3 was identified as a viru lence factor (O ffit et al. , 1986). Since rota viru s strains differ from ea ch other again by single arginine residues or paired basic amino acids at the cleavage site o f VP.) (Lopez er al. , 1986 ) , it is rea son abl e to assume that cleavabil ity o f thi s surface protein determines pathogen icit y, altho ugh such a correlati on has not yet been demonstrat ed . If bacteria pre sent in the intestinal tract co uld induce a synergisti c effec t, as with influenza viruses, it would be difficult to detect such a co rr ela tio n .\n\nAll in all, evidence is incr easing that p roteol ytic activati on of functionally important proteins ma y be a rather com mon determinant of pathogenicity.\n\nThe author s' work was supported by th e Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Sonderfo rschungsbereich 47) and by the Fonds der Chernischen Indu st rie."}
