{"title": "Hypothesis Design of a set of probes with high potential for influenza virus epidemiological surveillance", "body": "Influenza viruses are part of Orthomixoviridae Family and possess segmented genomes consisting of seven or eight separate RNA molecules, each coding for one or more viral proteins. The viruses can exchange segments, leading to diversity of reassortant strains. Together with accumulation of point mutations, segment reassortment is the basis for evolution and maintenance of diversity for these viruses. It provides them with the ability to rapidly adapt to the pressure of the host immune system and leads to the continuous emergence of new virus variants that cause seasonal and pandemic outbreaks of influenza. Because of this ability, segmented viruses can exist in numerous genotypes and serotypes, presenting a challenge to the creation of protective vaccines and detection methods [1, 2] .\n\nBecause of these reasons, the early detection and diagnostic confirmation of influenza virus infections is fundamental for an appropriate control of the disease. Several molecular biology techniques, most of them based on PCR amplification, have contributed to the diagnostic of the different types and subtypes of influenza virus. However, PCR techniques are frequently unable to detect new potentially virulent strains. Other techniques such as sequencing are able to perform a precise The creation of a microarray is complicated when genomic structures are similar. Probe selection is further complicated when the number of known sequences is very large. When this happens the probe selection strategy becomes critical [5] . There are several methods [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] for the selection of specific probes for influenza virus detection. Direct search for probes based on traditional computational methods is labor-intensive and often requires plenty of time. The Shannon entropy (H), is a bioinformatics technique that has been used to sort the influenza virus, to analyze the evolution of influenza [13] , to facilitate the development of an anti-influenza vaccine [14] , and to create a profile of these areas of high variation, observing characteristic patterns for each subtype [15] .\n\nIn the present approach we designed and tested in silico, an Influenza Probe Set (IPS) which consists in 1,249 probes with a length of 9mer, extracted from sequence alignment zones with maximum entropy within the full viral genome of over 5,000 viruses reported, considering almost all viral subtypes of Influenza A. Using Virtual Hybridization (VH) technology, in silico Genomic Fingerprints were generated, which in turn were compared to estimate a phylogeny based on the fingerprint pairwise distances. Other studies have employed the use of the VH technology to create genomic fingerprints for in silico classifying of microorganisms as Human Papillomaviruses [16] and bacterial genomes [17] .\n\nShannon entropy is a measure of the lack of predictability of an element [19] , such as a given base, in a particular position of alignment. Highly variable columns in an alignment will yield maximum values of entropy.\n\nThis program developed in Java, calculates the Shannon entropy of aligned sequences. It finds the points having maximum entropy, then, selects 9-mer sequences (the size can be modified by the user), using the point of maximum entropy as the 9-mer center. CalcProbes. This Perl script refines the search of probes using the 9-mer sequences provided by SearchProbe. These sequences are subject to the next restrictions: i) Select only sequences having between 35-65 %G + C (4 or 5), ii) Eliminate 9-mers having tandem repeats of 2 or 3 nucleotides, iii) Select sequences having a minimum of 2 differences between them and iv) Chose 9-mer sequences having 34 to 36\u00b0C Tm values. Tm values were calculated with the thermodynamic Nearest-Neighbors (NN) model using SantaLucia parameters [19] . The final 1,249 9-mer probe set selected by this procedure is the IPS (Influenza Probe Set).\n\nVirtual Hybridization is a computer program able to predict perfect and mismatched target/probe hybridizations under a selected Tm cutoff value. The stability of target/probe duplexes is calculated with the NN model. This program was used to determine all the hybridizations occurring between each Influenza virus genome, or control strain, and the IPS. The group of hybridization signals produced by each viral genome corresponds to its particular fingerprint [20] .\n\nUniversal Fingerprinting Analysis (UFA) software transforms genomic fingerprints produced by Virtual Hybridization under any chosen stringent condition, into images. It also allows visual comparison of any selected pairs of fingerprints, producing spots with specific colors for both distinctive as well as for shared hybridization signals. Besides, this tool is able to calculate pairwise distances between pairs of genomic fingerprints. From a table of such distances Taxonomic trees were built using the Neighbor -Joining method with the program MEGA 5 [21] .\n\nTwo types of analysis were performed: I) A Taxonomic tree, based on distances between IPS-Genomic Virtual Hybridization fingerprints, comparing several types of Influenza and other viruses, was made. II) Overlapped images from selected pairs of genomic fingerprints for strains having: low, medium, or high degree of relatedness, were made. Influenza A /mallard duck/New York/170/1982(H1N2) and Influenza A/Mexico/InDRE4487/200 were used as references.\n\nIn the first step an average of 550,500 non-unique sequence probes were selected from the alignment. Furthermore probe sequences were clustered in order to remove the repeated ones and to select only those with entropy higher than a convenient threshold (ProbeSearch). Calcprobes is responsible for applying the design parameters explained in the methodology. After the above-mentioned, we performed a third selection, by removing sequences containing probes with the lowest entropy values and taking probes with a Tm range of 34.5 to 36.5\u00b0C and free energy values between -9.00 and -13.5Kcal/mol.\n\nA database of tested target viral genomes used for the in silico experiments was created. The VH programs conducts a rigorous and reliable analysis to find and track all the sites in each viral genome where the probe sequences can hybridize taking into account the degree of complementarity between the probe and the recognized site in the target (allowing at least a mismatch difference) and the thermodynamic stability between them. The generated information constitutes an in silico genomic fingerprint listing details of the specific sites in each target DNA where hybridization occurred, the number and sequence of the probe that hybridized as well as the free energy value of the hybridizations and it also provides the sequence of the target site recognized by each probe. A free energy cutoff value of -9 kcal/mol for 9mer probes was used. Figure 2 . It is clear that both viruses are very similar with only minor mutations, as expected for viruses from the same outbreak. However IPS genomic fingerprints are able to show seven differences between then, with five specific probes for A/M\u00e9xicoindre4487/2009 H1N1 virus and two for the A/California/04/2009. This is very important for molecular studies of influenza because IPS is highly sensitive as to spread viruses even those very closer; this will help in the management of influenza epidemiology, and not depend on a previous sequencing.\n\nFollowing the established parameters, the set of 1249 highly specific probes (IPS) allowed us to correct typing and subtyping of influenza viruses, including human and animal strains, as well as very similar strains. The IPS design based on the construction of probes from regions of the viral genome with maximum entropy allows a highly sensitive discrimination.\n\nThrough an in silico hybridization, the performance of the IPS microarray was simulated, allows us to know the possible behavior of the probes, and predicting genomic fingerprints of these viruses. Prediction is based in experimentally supported thermodynamic models, which suggest that the IPS microarray would be a valuable Influenza diagnosis tool. "}
