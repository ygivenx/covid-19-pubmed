{"title": "The phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase inhibitor apilimod blocks filoviral entry and infection", "body": "The epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) that raged through Western Africa between 2013 and 2016 was the most severe filovirus disease epidemic in recorded history [1,2]. While several promising therapeutic antibodies [3\u201311] and novel small molecules [12\u201319] remain in development, no therapeutic is yet approved to treat patients with EVD. In the continuing pursuit of an anti- Ebola virus (EBOV) therapeutic, one strategy is to identify approved drugs that show anti-EBOV activity [20\u201328], with the goal of repurposing them for an anti-EBOV therapeutic, either alone or as part of a multi-component regimen [29\u201334].\n\nMost of the approved drugs that have been identified as blocking EBOV infection inhibit the entry phase of the viral lifecycle [19\u201325,27,28]. Cell entry by EBOV is a complex process [35,36] entailing virus binding to cell surface attachment factors, internalization by macropinocytosis, processing by endosomal proteases, and transport to endolysosomes containing Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) [14,37], the intracellular receptor for EBOV [38]. Finally, EBOV fuses with the limiting membrane of NPC1+ endolysosomes [39\u201341], liberating its genome and associated proteins into the cytoplasm to begin replication.\n\nThe essential role of NPC1 in EBOV entry and infection was powerfully illuminated in a haploid genetic screen [37]. The same screen revealed other gene products critical for EBOV entry [42,43] including many involved in endosome and lysosome biogenesis and maturation. One of the latter proteins was phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) [37], a lipid kinase that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2). PIKfyve and PI(3,5)P2 are known to be critical for endosome maturation [44\u201353].\n\nApilimod is a small molecule that binds to and inhibits the phosphotransferase activity of PIKfyve [54]. The drug was developed as a suppressor of interleukin 12 and 23 production [55], and was tested in phase 2 clinical trials for treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease [56,57], psoriasis [58], and rheumatoid arthritis [59]. Although no clinical benefit has yet been reported, apilimod is deemed to be well tolerated in humans. We chose to test whether apilimod could inhibit infections by EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV) for three reasons. The first was that apilimod binds [54] to the EBOV entry factor PIKfyve [37]. The second was because apilimod emerged from a blinded screen of 35 drugs (S1 Fig; S1 Table), which were selected as potential inhibitors based upon hypotheses of drugable targets and from theoretical considerations of pathways possibly involved in the EBOV life cycle. The third reason was because apilimod is well tolerated in humans. We find that apilimod inhibits infection by both EBOV and MARV, being notably effective in primary human macrophages, which are initial targets of filoviral infection [60,61]. Mechanistic studies revealed that apilimod blocks EBOV entry into the cell cytoplasm by working through PIKfyve and that its effect is to block viral particle trafficking to NPC1+ endolysosomes, the site of EBOV fusion [39\u201341]. Hence we propose that apilimod be further explored as part of a cocktail of small molecules to combat EVD.\n\nVero E6 (African green monkey kidney; ATCC 1586) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Huh 7 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells were obtained from Dr. Hideki Ebihara (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, MT). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared from human whole blood (Biological Specialty Corporation; Colmar, PA; Cat # 3100-03-04) and human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells at the Integrated Research Facility (IRF) immunology core laboratories as described previously [62,63]. hMDM were characterized by flow cytometric analysis for expression of major macrophage markers, including human leukocyte antigen-D related, CD11b, CD14, CD163, and CD86, to confirm that the hMDM population was mature and highly purified [63]. HEK 293T/17 (Human embryonic kidney; ATCC CRL-11268 via University of Virginia Tissue Culture Facility) and BSC-1 (Grivet monkey kidney; gift from Dr. Xiaowei Zhuang, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) cells were maintained in growth medium: high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, all from Gibco Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA), and either 10% supplemented calf serum (SCS; Hyclone, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) for HEK 293T/17 cells or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Seradigm, VWR International, Radnor, PA) or 10% cosmic calf serum (CCS, Hyclone) for BSC-1 cells.\n\nToremifene citrate (CAS 89778-27-8) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO; Cat# T7204-25MG) and apilimod (CAS 541550-19-0) was purchased from Axon MedChem (Groningen, NL; Cat# 1369). Nocodazole (CAS 31430-18-9) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO; Cat # M1404-2MG).\n\nAll procedures using infectious EBOV/Mak or MARV were performed under biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) conditions at the IRF. The C05 isolate of the Makona variant of EBOV (EBOV/Mak; full designation: Ebola virus/H.sapiens-tc/GIN/2014/Makona-C05; GenBank: KX000398) and Marburg Angola virus (MARV; full name: Marburg virus/H.sapiens-tc/AGO/2005/Ang-1379v; GenBank: N/A) were propagated in BEI NR-596 Vero E6 cells and used after one or two passages.\n\nThe drug screen method was performed as described previously [63]. Briefly, Vero E6 and Huh 7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3 x 104 cells/well, and hMDMs were plated at a density of 1 x 105 cells/well 24 h prior to the addition of drugs. For each cell type, cells were plated in 1 black opaque 96-well plate, for the evaluation of drug cytotoxicity, and 2 clear bottom, 96-well Operetta plates, for the evaluation of drug efficacy. Drugs dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were diluted in DMEM with 10% FBS with the final DMSO concentration not exceeding 0.05%. The drug solutions were diluted two-fold in an 8-point dilution series and transferred to cell plates 1 h prior to virus infection. Efficacy plates for each cell type were infected with EBOV or MARV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. After 48 h, cells were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin.\n\nChemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine virus activity. EBOV was detected with a mouse antibody against the EBOV VP40 matrix protein (B-MD04-BD07-AE11, made by US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Frederick MD under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contract) [3] and MARV was detected with a mouse antibody against the MARV VP40 protein (Cat# IBT 0203\u2013012, IBT Bioservices, Rockville, MD) for 1\u20132 h at 37\u00b0C. Cells were stained with a secondary antibody, anti-mouse IgG, peroxidase labeled antibody (Cat# 074\u20131802, KPL Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Luminescence was detected using Pico chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL) and an Infinite M1000 Pro plate reader (Tecan, Morrisville NC).\n\nFor quantitation of drug toxicity, 1 black opaque cell plate for each cell type was mock infected (no virus) and treated with drug dilutions under the same conditions as the infected cells. After 48 h, cell viability was measured using the CellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Luminescence was read on an Infinite M1000 Pro plate reader.\n\nFollowing background subtraction, inhibition was measured as percent relative to untreated infected cells. Non-linear regression analysis was performed, and IC50s were calculated from fitted curves (log [agonist] vs response [variable slope] with constraint to remain above 0; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Error bars of dose-response curves represent the standard deviation of three replicates.\n\nEntry reporter viral-like particles (VLPs) bearing GP from the Yambuku-Mayinga isolate of EBOV were prepared as described previously [24,25,41]. In brief, HEK 293T/17 cells (~80% confluent) were transfected with cDNAs encoding EBOV GP, VP40, mCherry-VP40, and \u03b2-lactamase-VP40 (\u03b2lam-VP40). The cell medium was collected 24 and 48 h post-transfection and cleared of debris. VLPs in the cleared medium were then pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion by centrifugation, resuspended in HM buffer (20 mM HEPES, 20 mM MES, 130 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), and repelleted. The final VLP pellet was resuspended (1:100 starting volume of medium) in 10% sucrose-HM. The total protein concentration of the VLPs was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. All entry-reporter VLP preparations were assessed by western blot analyses (for the presence of GP as well as EBOV VP40) and titered on HEK 293T/17 cells to confirm entry competency.\n\nThe VLP entry assay scores the ability of \u03b2lam-VP40 (from incoming entry reporter VLPs) to cleave a \u03b2lam substrate preloaded into the target cell cytoplasm; this only occurs if the VLP fuses with an endosome. The assay was performed as described previously [24,25,41]. In brief, 30,000 HEK 293T/17 cells or BSC-1 cells were seeded per well in a clear 96-well plate. 18\u201324 h post seeding, the cells (~80%\u201390% confluent) were treated with the indicated concentration of apilimod (Axon MedChem; DMSO for mock) diluted in Opti-MEM I (OMEM, Gibco Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. VLPs diluted in OMEM (with DMSO or the same concentration of apilimod) were bound to the cells by spinfection (250\u00d7 g) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. After 3 h in a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator, the \u03b2lam substrate CCF2-AM (Life Technologies, via ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was loaded into the cells using 20 or 5 mM Probenecid (MP Biomedicals via ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), for BSC-1 or HEK 293T/17 cells, respectively. The cells were incubated overnight at RT and then fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\nTo measure corresponding cell viability, 3 x 104 HEK 293T/17 cells, seeded and grown as above but in 96-well opaque white plates were treated as above for VLP entry, but without addition of VLPs or CCF2-AM. Following overnight incubation at RT (as above), the medium was removed and replaced with 50 \u03bcL of fresh medium per well. Fifty microliters (per well) of CellTiter-Glo 2.0 (Promega, Madison WI, USA) was then added. After shaking for 2 min at RT at 575 rpm on a Jitterbug orbital shaker (Boekel Scientific, via ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), the plate was incubated at RT for 10 min, after which the luminescent signal was detected using a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).\n\nTranscription/replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs) were prepared as described [25,64,65]. In brief, HEK 293T/17 cells were seeded in six well plates and transfected 24 h later (when ~50% confluent) using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI, USA) with pCAGGS-NP, pCAGGS-VP35, pCAGGS-VP30, pCAGGS-L, a tetracistronic minigenome plasmid, and pCAGGS-T7 polymerase. The minigenome plasmid encodes Renilla luciferase, as well as the matrix protein VP40, the nucleocapsid associated protein VP24, and the GP from EBOV. 24 h post transfection, the medium in each well was replaced with 4 mL fresh growth medium containing 5% FBS. 96 h after transfection, the medium (containing trVLPs harboring the Renilla luciferase-containing minigenome) was harvested, pooled, and cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation for 5 min at 800\u00d7 g and used for trVLP assays as described below.\n\nThe trVLP assay measures the ability of trVLPs containing a Renilla luciferase-encoding tetracistronic EBOV minigenome to infect target cells pretransfected with plasmids encoding proteins to enhance trVLP entry (the adhesion factor Tim-1) and (other plasmids) to support replication of the minigenome. If trVLPs enter target cells, the minigenome is replicated and transcribed, leading to Renilla luciferase reporter activity [64,65]. In brief: Cells were pretreated with apilimod (Axon MedChem; DMSO for mock) as described above. The pretreatment solution was then removed and replaced with 100 \u03bcL trVLPs diluted to 200 \u03bcL in growth medium containing 10% SCS and the indicated concentration(s) of apilimod (DMSO for mock). The cells were then incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator, after which the medium was replaced with 40 \u03bcL of fresh growth medium containing 10% SCS. 40 \u03bcL of RenillaGlo substrate (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was then added to each well and the plate immediately analyzed on a GloMax plate reader (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).\n\nTo assess cell viability in corresponding samples without trVLPs, the pretreatment solution was removed and replaced with 200 \u03bcL fresh growth medium containing 10% SCS and the indicated concentrations of apilimod (DMSO for mock). The cells were then incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator, after which the medium was replaced with 40 \u03bcL of fresh growth medium containing 10% SCS. 40\u03bcL of CellTiter-Glo 2.0 (Promega) was then added to each well and the plate placed on a Jitterbug orbital shaker (575 rpm) for 2 min at RT. The plate was then incubated at RT for 10 min, after which the luminescent signal was detected using a Synergy HT (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) plate reader.\n\nBSC-1 cells were seeded in 35mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) that were coated with 20 \u03bcg/mL fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The next day, when the cells were 90\u2013100% confluent, the cells were treated with the indicated drug at the indicated concentration, diluted in growth medium containing 10% cosmic calf serum, for 3 h at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Acridine Orange (Life Technologies, Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was added directly to each dish to reach a final concentration of 6.6 \u03bcg/mL. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 20 min and then were washed 3 times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 5 min per wash. Cell imaging medium [Live cell imaging solution (Molecular Probes, Cat# A14291DJ, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) containing 10% FBS and 4.5 g/L glucose] was added to the dishes and images were taken using a Nikon C1 laser scanning confocal unit attached to a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E microscope with a 100X, 1.45-numerical-aperature (NA) Plan Apochromat objective (Nikon, Melville, NY).\n\nBSC-1 cells were seeded in 35mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MD, USA) that had been coated with 20 \u03bcg/mL fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich). The next day, when the cells were 90\u2013100% confluent, the cells were treated with the indicated drug at the indicated concentration plus 0.05 \u03bcM TopFluor Cholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), diluted in serum-free growth medium, for 18 h at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Following incubation, the cells were gently rinsed once with PBS and cell imaging medium (Live cell imaging solution (Molecular Probes) containing 10% FBS and 4.5 g/L glucose) was added to the dishes. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min. Images were then taken using a 60X /1.45 numerical aperture (NA) Nikon Plan Apo total internal reflection fluorescence oil immersion objective attached to a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU 10 spinning-disk confocal unit, a 512-by-512 Hamamatsu 9100c-13 EM-BT camera, a motorized stage maintained at 37\u00b0C, and a Nikon Perfect Focus system.\n\nVLP trafficking experiments were performed in BSC-1 cells essentially as described previously [41] with the following minor modifications. Cells were pretreated with apilimod or nocodazole (indicated concentrations) diluted in OMEM for 1h at 37\u00b0C prior to VLP addition. VLPs at 0.5 \u03bcg/well were bound to the cells by spinfection (250 x g) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. After incubation at 37\u00b0C (CO2 incubator) for the indicated times, the cells were fixed and washed. Next, primary antibodies (1:1000 rabbit \u03b1-NPC1, (Abcam) or 1:1000 mouse \u03b1-early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were added for 45 min at room temperature (RT) and, following washing, secondary antibodies (1:1500 \u03b1-mouse or \u03b1-rabbit AlexaFluor 488, Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added for 30 min at RT. The cells were washed and the coverslips were mounted overnight on glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The coverslips were then sealed and images were taken using a Nikon C1 laser scanning confocal unit attached to a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E microscope with a 100X, 1.45-NA Plan Apochromat objective. Colocalization of VLPs (red, mCherry-VP40) and endosomal markers (green, NPC1 or EEA1) was assessed as Manders coefficients. Statistics were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7. Normality of the data was assessed using the D\u2019Agostino & Pearson normality test. Significance of normally distributed data was determined by T-test, and significance of non-normally distributed data was determined by Mann-Whitney test.\n\nCathepsin B+L activity was assayed as described previously [20,21,24]. (2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester (EST, Cat # 330005, Calbiochem, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), an inhibitor of cathepsin B,H, and L, was used as a positive control for inhibition at the indicated concentration. Data are displayed as fluorescence units (Ex 360/Em 460).\n\nThirty-five drugs obtained from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) were dissolved in DMSO at 500 \u03bcM. Drugs were diluted in DMEM (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamine (Q; Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (PS; Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Drugs were added to confluent Vero E6 cells. Drugs and cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator in 96-well plates for final concentrations of 10, 1, or 0.1 \u03bcM in a final volume of 100 \u03bcl DMEM/PS/Q with 2% FBS (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were returned to the incubator for 2 h.\n\nFor efficacy studies, 50 \u03bcl DMEM/PS/Q containing 1x103 TCID50 of recombinant EBOV expressing firefly luciferase from an additional transcriptional unit (rgEBOV-luc2, Genbank Accession number KF990214.1) [66] was added to the cells. At 48 h post-inoculation the supernatant was removed and 100 \u03bcl GloLysis buffer (Promega) was added to the cells and incubated for 10 min at RT. Afterwards, 40 \u03bcl lysate was added to 40 \u03bcl BrightGlo reagent (Promega) in white opaque 96 well plates, and reporter activity was measured using a GloMax luminometer.\n\nFor cytotoxicity studies, 50 \u03bcl of DMEM/PS/Q without virus was added to the cells following the 2 h pre-incubation with drugs, and cells were returned to the incubator. At 48 h, 100 \u03bcl of supernatant was removed, and 50 \u03bcl of CellTiterGlo reagent (Promega) was added to the cells. Cells were incubated for 2 min on an orbital shaker at 60 RPM, and then for an additional 10 min without shaking at RT. Supernatants were transferred to white opaque 96-well plates, and reporter activity was measured using a GloMax luminometer (Promega). Ribavirin at final concentrations of 1 mg/ml, 100 \u03bcg/ml, and 10 \u03bcg/ml, as well as DMSO at concentrations corresponding to the DMSO concentrations found in the drug dilutions served as controls. All experiments involving infectious rgEBOV-luc2 were performed in the maximum containment laboratory of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT, following approved protocols.\n\nHEK 293T/17 cells were seeded at a density of 3 x 106 cells per 10 cm plate. The next day, when the cells were approximately 60% confluent, the media above the cells was replaced with 6mL OMEM and the cells were transfected with 2.4 \u03bcg pTG-luc, 1.2 \u03bcg pCMV-MLVgag-pol, 1.2 \u03bcg pGP\u0394mucin (encoding Ebola GP deleted for its mucin domain), and 1.2 \u03bcg of MLV-gag-\u03b2lam diluted to 300 \u03bcL in OMEM (per plate), using 18 \u03bcL Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific, Walthan, MA) diluted to 300 \u03bcL in OMEM (per plate). 4h post transfection, 6 mL of antibiotic-free growth medium containing 10% SCS was added to each plate, and the cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. Cell medium containing pseudovirus was then collected, pooled, and cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 250 x g for 7 min. The clarified supernatant containing pseudovirus was then passed through an 0.45 \u03bcm filter and the pseudoviruses were concentrated 100-fold by high-speed centrifugation through a 25% sucrose cushion in HM buffer (20mM HEPES, 20mM MES, 130mM NaCl, pH7.4) for 75 min at 103,745 x g. The final pseudovirus pellet was resuspended in growth medium (100-fold concentrated from harvest supernatant).\n\nHEK 293T/17 cells were seeded at a density of 5 x 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. When the cells were ~50% confluent (~18\u201324 h post seeding), they were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-PIKfyve or pEGFP-Cl using TransIT LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 18 h post transfection, the cells were re-seeded in 96 well opaque white plates (BD Falcon, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at a density of 3 x 104 cells per well. Transfection was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. 18 h post re-seeding, the cells were pretreated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with apilimod. MLV-luciferase particles pseudotyped with EBOV GP\u0394mucin were added to the cells in the presence of apilimod, and infection was allowed to proceed for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then washed once with PBS and overlaid with 50\u03bcL PBS. Luciferase activity was then immediately assayed by adding 50\u03bcL of Britelite plus (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and reading on a Glomax plate reader (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nWe first tested whether apilimod blocks EBOV infection in cell cultures. Apilimod blocked EBOV infection of Huh 7 (liver) cells, Vero E6 (kidney) cells, and primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) (Fig 1) with 6- to 247-fold higher activity than the positive control, toremifene citrate [20,22]. Apilimod also blocked MARV infection of the same cell types (Fig 2) with 38- to 1160-fold higher activity than the positive control. Apilimod was notably potent (IC50, 10 nM) against both filoviruses in hMDMs (Figs 1 and 2, Table 1). While similar potency (IC50, 15\u201325 nM) was seen in Vero E6 cells, apilimod was ~10-fold less potent (IC50, 140 nM) in Huh 7 cells (Fig 1, Fig 2 and Table 1).\n\nTo begin to probe the mechanism by which apilimod blocks EBOV infection, we directly compared dose-response profiles for blocking EBOV entry and replication using entry reporter VLPs [24] and trVLPs [64], respectively. Both sets of VLPs bore the GP from the Mayinga isolate of EBOV. Apilimod blocked EBOV particle entry (Fig 3A) and replication (Fig 3B) with similar dose-response profiles (Fig 3C). This finding suggested that apilimod blocks the entry phase of the filoviral lifecycle.\n\nSince apilimod targets PIKfyve [54], since PIKfyve is required for EBOV entry and infection [37], and since apilimod blocks EBOV entry and infection (Figs 1\u20133), we reasoned that apilimod blocks EBOV entry and infection by targeting PIKfyve. To test this hypothesis we over-expressed PIKfyve (GFP-PIKfyve) and compared the dose response needed for apilimod to block EBOV-GP mediated pseudovirus infection. As predicted, and as seen in Fig 4, higher doses of apilimod were needed to achieve similar levels of inhibition of EBOV GP-mediated infection in GFP-PIKfyve vs. GFP expressing cells. This supports our proposal that apilimod blocks EBOV entry and infection through a PIKfyve-dependent pathway.\n\nRecent work has shown that EBOV traffics deep in the endocytic pathway, to NPC1+ endolysosomes, for fusion and entry [39\u201341]. Therefore we asked whether apilimod prevents EBOV VLPs from reaching NPC1+ endolysosomes. We used BSC-1 cells for these experiments as they are more suitable (flatter and more adherent) for immunofluorescence analysis than the HEK 293T/17 cells used in previous experiments (Figs 3 and 4). We first demonstrated that apilimod blocks EBOV VLP entry into BSC-1 cells with the same approximate dose-dependency as its effects in HEK 293T/17 cells (Fig 3D). Given that, we next asked if apilimod blocks trafficking of EBOV GP VLPs to NPC1+ endolysosomes in BSC-1 cells. As seen in Fig 5, this was, indeed, the case. Apilimod blocked EBOV VLP trafficking to NPC1+ endolysosomes to a similar extent as nocodazole, a microtubule destabilizer that is known to block traffic between early and late endosomes [67].\n\nThe findings presented in Fig 5A\u20135D were obtained after allowing VLPs pre-bound to the cell surface to enter cells for 90 min at 37\u00b0C. This time point was chosen based on our extensive prior analysis of the time courses of EBOV VLP co-localization with NPC1+ endolysosomes and entry into BSC-1 cells [41]. To assure that apilimod did not accelerate VLP trafficking to NPC1+ endolysosomes, we analyzed co-localization of VLPs at various times up to 90 min in cells treated or not treated with apilimod. As seen in Fig 5E, at no point during this time course were VLPs seen to associate with NPC1+ endolysosomes in apilimod-treated cells, supporting our conclusion that apilimod blocks trafficking of EBOV particles to NPC1+ endolysosomes.\n\nConcomitant with decreased trafficking of EBOV GP VLPs to NPC1+ endolysosomes, apilimod caused EBOV VLPs to accumulate in EEA1+ endosomes (Fig 6). In apilimod-treated cells, EEA1+ endosomes appeared larger than those in mock-treated cells, consistent with previous reports showing enlarged endosomes in cells genetically deficient for PIKfyve or treated with PIKfyve inhibitors [44,45,50,53].\n\nThe findings presented in Figs 5 and 6 indicate that the primary mechanism by which apilimod blocks EBOV entry and infection (Figs 1\u20134) is by blocking virus transport from early (EEA1+) endosomes to their site of fusion in NPC1+ endolysosomes. To further test this model, we asked whether apilimod affects other attributes of the endosomal pathway needed for EBOV entry, either endosome acidification or the activity of cathepsin B and L [42,43]. At a concentration that strongly blocked EBOV entry and infection, apilimod had no detectable effect on endosome acidification (Fig 7). Bafilomycin, an inhibitor of EBOV infection that blocks endosome acidification, was used as a positive control. Apilimod also had no apparent direct effect on the activity of cathepsin B and L (Fig 8), in contrast to EST, a known inhibitor of cathepsin B, H, and L. Several cationic amphiphilic drugs such as U18666A that block EBOV entry and infection [20\u201322,24,25,68] induce cholesterol accumulation in endolysosomes [20,24]. In contrast, apilimod did not cause a detectable increase in cholesterol levels in endolysosomes (Fig 9). Hence apilimod appears to block filoviral entry and infection by inhibiting virus particle trafficking to NPC1+ endolysosomes, the portal for entry of the EBOV genome into the host cell cytoplasm [39\u201341].\n\nEBOV journeys deep into the cellular endosomal system, entering the cytoplasm through endolysosomes that are positive for NPC1 and two-pore channel 2 (TPC2) [39]. In addition to NPC1, its intracellular receptor [14,37,38], EBOV requires multiple factors involved in endosome and lysosome biogenesis and maturation for entry [37]. One of the latter factors is PIKfyve [37], which phosphorylates PI3P to generate PI(3,5)P2. Here we have shown that apilimod, which binds to PIKfyve [54], blocks EBOV entry and infection in a PIKfyve-dependent manner.\n\nThe inhibitory effect of apilimod on EBOV entry is likely due to a defect in the maturation of endolysosomes, as extensive evidence indicates the importance of PIKfyve and PI(3,5)P2 in this process [44\u201353]. Although the exact mechanism by which PIKfyve and PI(3,5)P2 orchestrate endosome maturation is not known, several mechanisms have been postulated. Considered in these mechanisms are the observations that two Ca++ channels found in (endo)lysosomes\u2014transient receptor potential cation channel, mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) [50,69] and TPC2 [70\u201372]\u2014are downstream effectors of PIKfyve and PI(3,5)P2. Through its action on TRPML1, PIKfyve has been shown to regulate the fission and consequent remodeling and maturation that reduces the size of macropinosomes containing endocytosed material from the cell surface and exterior [50]. In addition, the TPC2 channel has been reported to be activated by PI(3,5)P2 [71,72]. Intriguingly, both macropinocytosis [35,73,74] and TPC2 [75] are involved in EBOV entry and infection. Although we do not yet know all of the endolysosomal factors needed to trigger EBOV GP for fusion [36,39,43,76], it appears clear that proper endosomal maturation is required. These findings are consistent with the mounting evidence for a role of PIKfyve in EBOV entry and our observation that the PIKfyve inhibitor, apilimod, blocks transport of EBOV particles to NPC1+ endolysosomes. It is therefore likely that interconnected effects of apilimod on PIKfyve [37,54], TPC2 [75], and endolysosome maturation culminate in its blockade of EBOV entry and infection.\n\nSeveral approved drugs that function as EBOV entry inhibitors (e.g., clomiphene, toremifene, and sertraline) block EBOV entry into the cytoplasm after EBOV particles have been delivered to NPC1+ endolysosomes [20,21,24,25]. Hence they likely interfere with some aspect of the virus-endolysosome membrane fusion process, per se. Other approved drugs, including chloroquine, niclosamide, atovaquone, amodiaquine and quinacrine [21\u201323], block endosomal acidification. Hence these drugs likely interfere with the processing of EBOV GP by acid-optimal endosomal cathepsins [42,43] and/or low pH-induced conformational changes required for fusion activity of cleaved GP [77,78].\n\nIn contrast to these mechanisms, our findings indicate that apilimod blocks EBOV entry by blocking particle delivery into NPC1+ endolysosomes. The only other approved drugs that we know of with anti-EBOV activity that are expected to have this mode of action are microtubule-disrupting agents, including colchicine, nocodazole, vinblastine, and vinorelbine [21\u201323]. Hence the mode of action of apilimod as an anti-filoviral agent is novel. Rather than blocking EBOV trafficking to NPC1+ endosomes by interfering with microtubules, apilimod blocks EBOV trafficking by inhibiting PIKfyve.\n\nOur findings indicate that apilimod has similar anti-viral activity against EBOV and MARV, consistent with the need for NPC1 in endolysosomes for the entry of these and other filoviruses [37,79,80]. We therefore consider it likely that apilimod, a host-directed small molecule, will have broad or even pan-filoviral activity. Furthermore, since many other viruses, so-called late penetrating viruses [36,81], traffic beyond early endosomes for entry, it is possible that apilimod will block entry and infection by members of other virus families.\n\nApilimod is an investigational drug. Although it has been tested in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis, the drug has not yet been approved for any indication. Nonetheless apilimod was well-tolerated in humans in the reported phase 2 trials [56\u201359]. We found that intraperitoneal delivery of 10 mg/kg of apilimod to mice resulted in a Cmax of 2.53 \u03bcM. This is well above the IC50 for apilimod inhibition of EBOV infection in the three cell lines tested, ~250 times greater than the IC50 in hMDMs (10 nM), initial major targets of filoviral infections [60,61]. We therefore consider it plausible that apilimod be used in the treatment of EVD. And, while apilimod may not function as a single agent, it may perform well as a component in an anti-filoviral small molecule cocktail. In summary, we introduce apilimod, a small molecule PIKfyve inhibitor that has proven safe in phase 2 clinical trials, as a potential anti-filoviral agent."}
