{"title": "Prevalence and outcomes of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome among pediatrics in Saudi Arabia: a 10-year retrospective study", "body": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the 10-year prevalence of GBS among the pediatric population who complained of acute paralysis and were admitted to the emergency department at the largest healthcare facility in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia. In addition, this study determined the factors associated with GBS and described its clinical outcomes, mainly progression to maximum paralysis and the extent of residual paralysis after 60 days.\n\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study, based on a thorough review of medical records, between 2005 and 2015 at the largest tertiary healthcare facility in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Exceeding a bed capacity of 1,200 beds, King Fahad Hospital was the targeted setting, which is part of a multilevel healthcare system of the Saudi Ministry of National Guard. The estimated annual rate of pediatric visits to the emergency department is 205,800. Ethical clearance and approval to conduct this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at King Abdullah International Medical Research Center with reference number RC 16/130/R. Patient confidentiality was maintained as no patients\u2019 identifiers were collected in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Thus, patient parental consent to review their medical records was not required.\n\nEligible cases were pediatric cases (<14 years old) admitted to the setting complaining of acute paralysis and later diagnosed with one form or variant of GBS.21,22 Diagnosis of GBS was confirmed by expert neurologists based on physical examination and a series of diagnostic tests, such as nerve conduction examinations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid tests. Diagnostic reports were read and validated by two study investigators. Other cases of acute paralysis were excluded (ie, transverse myelitis, myositis, botulism, and myasthenia gravis) (Figure 1). Patient and disease characteristics included gender, age (years), classification of GBS, season of incident, and any antecedent infections prior to disease onset. Results of physical examination and diagnostic tests as well as the type of clinical management performed were collected. Clinical outcomes mainly included the duration of progression to maximum paralysis (cutoff set at 2 weeks), residual paralysis set at 60 days, and prevalence of recurrent vs relapsed GBS.\n\nThe SPSS version 25 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data analysis. Frequency and percentages were used to describe categorical variables, whereas the mean \u00b1 standard deviation was used to present continuous variables. Age was categorized into two groups at the cutoff of 7 years (50th percentile of sample). Testing the two clinical outcomes (progression to maximum paralysis within 2 weeks and residual paralysis at 60 days) across various patient disease characteristics was conducted using Pearson\u2019s chi-square and Fisher\u2019s exact test as applicable. Two binary logistic regression models were constructed to adjust for any confounding effect between gender, age, and antecedent infections to identify the variables significantly associated with these two clinical outcomes. Accordingly, the adjusted OR and the 95% CI were presented with statistical significance set at P<0.05.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2015, a total of 100 pediatric cases were admitted to the emergency department complaining of acute paralysis. The 10-year prevalence of GBS among cases with acute paralysis (N=100) was 49%. Males constituted 29 (59.2%) of the sample, whereas 20 (40.8%) were females. The mean \u00b1 standard deviation age was 7\u00b13.7 years, that is 26 (53.1%) between 1 and 7 years old and 23 (46.9%) between 8 and 14 years old. Although 14 (28.6%) of the cases were unclassified categories of GBS, 18 (36.7%) were classified as AIDP, 14 (28.6%) as acute motor axonal neuropathy/acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy, and 3 (6.1%) as Miller Fisher syndrome. A concurrent infection with GBS or vaccine occurred in 34 (69.4%) cases. Minimal seasonal variation in GBS admissions was observed between the summer and winter seasons, 44.9% in colder seasons vs 55.1% in warmer seasons (Table 1).\n\nAlmost half of the sample (n=27, 55.1%) complained of back or limb pain and 7 (14.3%) complained of limb paresthesia/numbness. Patients who reported facial weakness numbered 12 (24.5%), ocular abnormalities were reported by 14 (28.6%) patients, and bulbar symptoms were reported by 21 (42.9%). Only 9 (18.4%) cases reported respiratory problems and 10 (20.4%) autonomic involvement, while almost all (n=48, 98%) had impaired reflexes. A series of diagnostic tests revealed abnormal brain MRI (ie, loss of peritrigonal white matter and abnormal signal noted within the right basal ganglia) in 2 (11.8%) patients and abnormal spine MRI (ie, intense enhancement of the terminal nerve roots, significant thickening of the anterior spinal nerve root in the conus medullaris and cauda equine, abnormal enhancement noted at the peripheral sacral anterior root at the level of S1 and S2, and diffuse enhancements seen along the peripheral nerve roots of the spinal cord) in 4 (26.7%). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed high protein levels in 15 (62.5%) patients in the sample, with a high white blood cell level in 4 (10.2%) cases. Positive laboratory culture was observed in 7 (14.3%) of the cases (Table 2). The majority of the patients (n=40, 81.6%) received a course of intravenous immunoglobulin and 5 (10%) received a course of intravenous immunoglobulin/steroids, while 4 (8.2%) underwent plasmapheresis. Patients who exhibited a progression to maximum paralysis in \u22642 weeks numbered 34 (69.4%), while 15 (30.6%) had a progression to maximum paralysis in >2 weeks. At 60 days post emergency department visit, 23 (46.9%) patients still had residual paralysis. Three patients suffered from recurrent GBS and one case from a relapse. No deaths were reported.\n\nAnalysis showed that male GBS patients were more likely to endure progression to maximum paralysis in \u22642 weeks after the onset of symptoms (n=24, 82.8%), compared to female GBS patients (n=10, 50%), P=0.014. All cases complaining of respiratory problems exhibited a progression to maximum paralyses in \u22642 weeks, compared to those with no respiratory problems, P=0.027. On the other hand, residual paralysis at 60 days post onset of disease was highly associated with GBS patients aged 8\u201314 years (n=15, 65.2%), compared to younger patients (n=8, 30.8%), P=0.016. Patients admitted in colder seasons (n=14, 63.6%) were more likely to suffer residual paralysis too, compared to warmer seasons (n=9, 33.3%), P=0.035. GBS patients who complained of facial weakness (n=9, 75%) and ocular abnormalities (n=10, 71.4%) were also more likely to endure residual paralysis at 60 days post disease onset, P=0.025 and P=0.03 respectively (Table 3).\n\nTwo binary logistic regression models showed that males were 5.69 times more likely to exhibit progression to maximum paralysis in \u22642 weeks compared to females, adjusted P=0.017. Older GBS patients with age 8\u201314 years were 3.9 times more likely to sustain residual paralysis at 60 days compared to younger patients aged 1\u20137 years, adjusted P=0.034 (Table 4).\n\nA number of limitations have been observed in this study. The retrospective analysis of previously collected data has been built on preexisting disease information recorded on medical charts. These data were originally collected for clinical rather than research purposes, which might have overlooked some patients and disease characteristics that might be of interest to readers. One of the main limitations is the fact that rehabilitation was not investigated in this study as a potential confounder for residual paralysis. Loss of follow-up, which is beyond 60 days, is another limitation, which could have reported the residual paralysis up to 12 months after the diagnosis. Due to that fact that this study reports findings from a relatively small sample size, it might not be generalizable to the populations residing in the whole Gulf region. This study has not reported the population incidence of GBS during the 10-year period, but rather limited its interest to the prevalence of GBS among acute paralytic cases. Last but not least, Zika virus has been reported to be a potential preceding trigger of GBS,14,15 yet no positive cases for Zika virus have so far been reported in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis study reported the prevalence of GBS among pediatrics complaining of acute paralysis in Saudi Arabia over a 10-year period. Male gender and respiratory problems appear to be determinants of a rapid progression to maximum paralysis. Pediatrics admitted in colder seasons and, in particular, the older age group are expected to endure residual paralysis at 60 days post disease onset. GBS can be accounted as a rare disease, especially in pediatrics, so confirmed cases should be investigated comprehensively for research purposes. Multicenter pooling of GBS-related data is crucial to boost the sample representativeness of the Saudi Arabian population and to better understand both the etiology and prognosis of this disease. Having a national GBS database will also aid in better understanding the various GBS variants with their distinctive clinical characteristics. The availability of the Saudi national biobank facility in Riyadh city could be seized to store GBS health-pertinent information and biological samples for future research analytical purposes."}
