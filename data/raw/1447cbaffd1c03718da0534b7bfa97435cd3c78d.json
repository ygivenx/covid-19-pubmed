Expected PDCoV product sizes were 500 bp for the membrane gene and 700 bp for the nucleocapsid gene.\n\nWe selected 2 PDCoVs (S5011 and S5015L) for whole-genome sequencing and 14 PDCoVs for sequencing of spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid genes and the 3\uf0a2-untranslated region.\n\nPDCoV genomes were amplified by using PCR and oligonucleotide primer sets previously described or new primer sets designed by using the Primer3 program (6) (7) (8) Jun 10  2 d  Intestine  +  -------S5012  Jun 10  2 d  Intestine  +  -------S5013 Jun 10 NA Feces\n\nJul 13 20 wk Feces\n\nJul 13 20 wk Feces\n\nJul 20 17 wk Blood\n\nJul 20 17 wk Blood\n\nJul 20 17 wk Blood\n\nJul 20 17 wk Blood\n\nJul "}
