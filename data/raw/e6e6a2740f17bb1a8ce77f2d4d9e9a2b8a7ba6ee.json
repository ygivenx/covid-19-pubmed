SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was 22 accomplished using Real Time RT-PCR published method [1] on nasopharyngeal swab and sputum 23 for patient 1 and on nasopharyngeal swab for patient 2, collected one day after symptoms onset.\n\nPartial sequencing confirmed both patients to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. \n\nThe number of SARS-CoV-2 reads obtained varied from 4,079 to >14 x 10 6 . By using de novo 37 assembly, two contigs of 29,867 nt (mean coverage: 81,324 reads; range: 26-510,718 reads), and 38 29,792 nt (mean coverage: 80 reads; range: 5-599 reads) were obtained for the isolate and clinical 39 sample of patient 1, respectively, and referred to as consensus sequences. Further analysis was 40 dedicated to identify the variants present at any nucleotide position for the variability analysis.\n\nConsidering the consensus sequences, two non-synonymous changes with respect to the Wuhan- "}
