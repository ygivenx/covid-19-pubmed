{"title": "Current Issues in Tourist Health, Safety and Security", "body": "In his Foreword to the recent Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) report 'Tourism Risk Management for the Asia Pacific Region' Sir Frank Moore (2004, p. iii) noted that:\n\nIn times of crisis, for any tourist destination the first concern must be for visitors. Away from home, in unfamiliar surroundings, they are quickly disorientated and very reliant on their hosts and the host communities in general. Adequate planning for what has in the past been seen as the 'unexpected' can be the difference between a well-managed problem and a human and economic disaster.\n\nThe catalyst for the APEC report was the October 2002 terrorist bombings in Bali. However, these observations have sadly been proven equally correct by the December 2004 Asian Tsunami disaster, where thousands of foreign nationals were totally reliant on local people at various tourist destinations for their survival. While it might be argued that the Asian Tsunami was different from other shocks experienced by the tourism industry in recent years (for example, terrorist acts, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in that the devastation was so widespread that it encompassed tourists and locals equally, the fact remains that tourists are a particularly vulnerable group who are reliant on others in times of need. This book is about ensuring that visitors to the world's tourist destinations have safe and enjoyable experiences, taking into account the various direct and indirect threats that may impact on the tourism industry. Safety in this context is all about preventing injury or harm to individuals and/or groups (Wilks, 2003a) . While the term 'safety' technically covers the main threats to tourists, it is common in the tourism and travel literature to distinguish between health, safety and security. This distinction mainly reflects the background and orientation of the different disciplines contributing to this area. The convention is loosely adopted here, with Part 1 of the book devoted to Health, while Part 2 presents Safety and Security chapters. However, there is also recognition that effective responses to the challenges facing tourism will only be possible through cross-disciplinary collaboration and partnerships between the industry and governments.\n\nBefore turning to specific issues, it is important to establish the position and importance of visitor health, safety and security within the realm of tourism. In their seminal work, Zeithaml, Parasuraman and Berry (1990) identified 10 dimensions of Service Quality (see Table 1 .1).\n\nSecurity, defined as freedom from danger, risk or doubt, was included in the original list, though until recently it has been a largely neglected area of service consideration in tourism (Wilks & Oldenburg, 1995) . In fairness, tourism is about selling dreams and any public focus on visitor illness, injury or mishap is not conducive to selling holidays (Wilks, 2004a) . However, particularly after the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 people wanted to be assured of their safety (Taylor, 2001) . Destinations can now rise or fall on these perceptions (Beirman, 2003) , so the second issue for tourist health, safety and security is that it must be seen as a critical and legitimate element of quality service, both by the tourism industry and by governments (the first issue was recognizing the vulnerability of visitors). Interestingly, within the World Tourism Organization (WTO) (www.worldtourism.org) the tourism safety and security programme has always been part of the quality department (see Chapter 16). One of the difficulties in establishing health, safety and security within tourism is that the roles of the required personnel are very different to that of mainstream tourism staff. A seat on a plane not sold on the day, or a hotel room vacant overnight is a lost opportunity for income that cannot be recovered. The tourism industry therefore tends to be focused on active selling and servicing of its products. The role of protecting these valuable, but somewhat intangible assets, involves planning, staff training and practice exercises, audits, monitoring and evaluation -all tasks that do not necessarily generate income or produce obvious benefits. This is why the Communications or Marketing Manager in many tourism organizations is the default crisis management person -it is an 'add-on' consideration, with assumptions that day-to-day operations will take care of safety and that external agencies like the police will always be available in a crisis. As theory and practice clearly show, quality crisis management does not automatically attach to a job description (Marriott, 2004) , so tourism must accept the need for employed personnel whose primary responsibility is to protect the product. The days of relying solely on insurance for protection are largely over (Liability Insurance Taskforce, 2002) . By analogy, construction sites employ security staff to ensure their building materials are not stolen or the premises vandalized. As a very current issue, tourism needs to adopt the same approach to protecting its assets and reputation.\n\nThere are a number of ways to identify other current issues in tourist health, safety and security. Perhaps the most useful barometer is what the tourism industry considers its most pressing matters. For example, the International Hotel and Restaurant Association (IH&RA) conducts regular 'think tank' discussions on key topics for its members. The 1998 Think Tank on Safety and Security in Orlando, Florida, for example, identified crime, terrorism and food safety as the three primary concerns by participants (IH&RA, 1998) . Delegates also expressed major concerns about the lack of information and information structures to assist the industry in addressing challenges in these areas.\n\nAround the same time, the Federation of Tour Operators (FTO) in the United Kingdom released their Health and Safety Handbook (FTO, 1999) emphasizing for members the topics of fire, swimming pool and gas safety. Also highlighted were children's clubs and illness (specifically legionellosis, meningitis, gastroenteritis and food poisoning). So, from an industry perspective there are clearly some readily identified and enduring health and safety issues that must be regularly addressed. The chapter topics for this book were intentionally chosen to respond to issues commonly identified by the tourism and hospitality industry.\n\nA second important source of information on current issues comes from governments around the world and is most readily identifiable through their travel advisories. The role of travel advisories is covered by David Beirman in Chapter 21; however, for the purposes of identifying global health, safety and security issues facing tourism the Consular Information Sheets provided by the US Department of State (http://travel.state.gov/travel_warnings.html) are a very relevant and useful resource. Consular Information Sheets are issued for every country in the world, with information on such matters as the health conditions, crime, unusual currency or entry requirements, any areas of instability, and the location of the nearest US embassy or consulate in the subject country. General information on safety issues for travelling overseas is also provided by the Department under the headings presented in Table  1 .2. A separate section of information is provided for health issues, including a list of Air Ambulance or Medi-Vac providers (see also Chapter 3).\n\nThe State Department also uses a two-tiered advisory system of Travel Warnings and Public Announcements. A Travel Warning is issued when the Department recommends that Americans avoid a certain country. As at 20 January 2005, there were Travel Warnings issued for 26 destinations; most of these were related to security issues.\n\nThe next level down are Public Announcements, which are a means to disseminate information about terrorist threats and other relatively short-term and/or trans-national conditions posing significant risks to the security of American travellers. These are made any time when there is a perceived threat and usually have Americans as a particular target group. In the past, Public Announcements have been issued to deal with short-term coups, bomb threats to airlines, violence by terrorists and anniversary dates of specific terrorist events. As at 20 January 2005, there were Public Announcements issued for 14 destinations. There was also a current World Wide Caution on terrorist activity. Among the 14 destinations, Thailand and Sri Lanka were listed because of the tsunami; others were listed for security reasons.\n\nIn terms of current issues in tourism health, safety and security, it is important to recognize both regional similarities and differences, especially in the use of travel advisories (Chapter 21). For example, a recent review of risk management for 21 tourist destinations in Oceania (Wilks, 2005) . That is, no serious safety or security concerns, some petty crime, typhoons and seismic activity, and a range of possible infectious diseases (most notably dengue fever, hepatitis A and typhoid fever). Malaria was specifically noted for the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, while Japanese B encephalitis was mentioned for the Northern Marianas. In late 2000, Micronesia had experienced an outbreak of cholera. The range of infectious diseases prevalent in this region highlighted the need for all travellers to carry appropriate travel health insurance, especially cover for emergency medical evacuation. In many smaller and remote destinations, it was noted that adequate medical care would not be available should a tourist require emergency treatment. The importance of travel insurance, especially for medical evacuations is expanded upon in Chapter 3. So, in terms of current issues, the tourism industry (with a customer focus) and national governments (in the interests of their citizens) share some common concerns about terrorism, crime, food safety, infectious disease and personal injury. However, as we shall see, based on their resources, responsibilities and priorities, the groups respond to tourist health, safety and security issues in very different ways. Another point worth emphasizing is that current issues change, especially at tourist destinations, which is why travel advisories must be kept up-to-date.\n\nThe third source of information on current issues comes from international associations and groups like the United Nations. Some are expert in tourism matters (e.g. the WTO); others have expertise in specific areas of activity rather than an industry. A good example of the latter is the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) that provides global leadership on mitigating all types of natural and human-made disasters (http://www.unisdr.org/) (see Chapter 9). International groups are very important for providing a 'big picture' view of current issues, and as discussed below, frameworks for accommodating the many and varied issues that are not necessarily prioritized by industry groups or all national governments. A good example is child sex tourism, where countries that are party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) (http://www.unicef.org/crc/crc.htm) have undertaken to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, including the exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices (Article 34).\n\nAlgeria, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Cyprus, Denmark, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Laos, Luxembourg, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the USA have already changed their laws to prosecute at home their citizens who abuse children abroad.\n\nAccording to the WTO (WTO, 1997; Wilks, 2002) , risks to the safety and security of tourists, host communities and tourism employees originate from the following four sources:\n\n\u2022 The human and institutional environment outside the tourism sector \u2022 The tourism sector and related commercial sectors \u2022 Individual travellers (personal risks) \u2022 Physical or environmental risks (natural, climatic and epidemic).\n\nWhile the focus of this book is on visitor safety -which includes protection of life, health, and the physical, psychological and economic integrity of travellers -the WTO framework for sources of risk is very valuable for making sense of the many current issues canvassed above. Indeed, the framework has been used successfully in several international projects (for example, Wilks & Moore, 2004) , so it is presented here again in detail. Adoption of a robust framework is also a step towards addressing one of the continuing concerns in this area -that there are few mechanisms in place to gather and disseminate timely information to protect tourism interests (IH&RA, 1998; Wilks & Moore, 2004) .\n\nThe risks from the human and institutional environment exist when visitors fall victim to:\n\n\u2022 common delinquency (e.g. theft, pick-pocketing, assault, burglary, fraud, deception); \u2022 indiscriminate and targeted violence (e.g. rape) and harassment; \u2022 organized crime (e.g. extortion, slave trade, coercion); \u2022 terrorism and unlawful interference (e.g. attacks against state institutions and the vital interests of the state), hijacking and hostage taking; \u2022 wars, social conflicts and political and religious unrest; and \u2022 a lack of public and institutional protection services.\n\nRisks that occur in the broader community impact similarly on tourists and residents. Tourists are not always targeted, but they are often caught up in events by being in the wrong place at the wrong time (see Chapter 7). Protection of tourists at this level is the responsibility of national governments and contributes to whether a destination is perceived to be safe. As demonstrated with travel advisories, this is an area where national governments are very active in trying to assist their travelling citizens, while at the same time, visitors are particularly reliant on the security services of the host nation.\n\nThrough defective operation, tourism and sectors related to tourism such as transport, sports and retail trade can endanger visitors' personal security, physical integrity and economic interests through:\n\n\u2022 poor safety standards in tourism establishments (e.g. fire, construction errors, lack of anti-seismic protection); \u2022 poor sanitation and disrespect for the environment's sustainability; \u2022 the absence of protection against unlawful interference, crime and delinquency at tourism facilities; \u2022 fraud in commercial transactions; \u2022 non-compliance with contracts; and \u2022 strikes by staff.\n\nThe protection of tourists from problems occurring in areas directly related to tourism is a joint responsibility of individual operators, tourism authorities at each destination, tourism industry associations and relevant sectors of local government. Problems in this area are not necessarily the 'fault' of the tourism industry, but can have a dramatic and negative effect on a destination's image. As emphasized by FTO (1999 FTO ( , 2003 , with appropriate standards in place, tourism can take ownership and responsibility for health, safety and security in relation to its operations. Again, reviews show that the same core issues continue to present challenges for key industry sectors like hotels (Surawski & Wilks, 2002) . Legal obligations, especially 'duty of care' responsibilities, are now clearly articulated for many areas of travel and tourism (Atherton & Atherton, 2003) ; further reinforcing the need to provide safe experiences for visitors in areas that are directly related to tourism.\n\nTravellers or visitors can endanger their own safety and security, and those of their hosts by:\n\n\u2022 practicing dangerous sports and leisure activities, dangerous driving and consuming unsafe food and drink; \u2022 travelling when in poor health, which may deteriorate during the trip; \u2022 causing conflict and friction with local residents, through inappropriate behaviour towards local communities or by breaking local laws; \u2022 carrying out illicit or criminal activities (e.g. trafficking in illicit drugs); \u2022 visiting dangerous areas; and \u2022 losing personal effects, documents and money through carelessness.\n\nMost travel health and safety incidents occur at the level of individual travellers. Many problems are the result of visitors being in an unfamiliar environment and/or participating in unfamiliar activities. For example, motor vehicle crashes remain the leading cause of injury-related death for tourists worldwide (Wilks, 1999; Page, Bentley, Meyer, & Chalmer, 2001) , followed by drowning (Wilks, 2002) . In support of the unfamiliar environment thesis, detailed analyses of motor vehicle crashes involving tourists in Australia show that:\n\n\u2022 international visitor crashes were less likely to involve high-risk driving behaviours such as alcohol use or speeding; and \u2022 international visitor crashes were more likely to involve disorientation, particularly driver fatigue, failure to keep to the left (correct) side of the road, head-on crashes and overturning their vehicle (Wilks, 2004b) .\n\nUnfamiliar adventure activities, such as scuba diving, also account for a significant number of tourist hospital admissions each year (Wilks & Coory, 2000 , while travelling with pre-existing illness continues to be the main cause of overseas visitor fatalities (Wilks, Pendergast, & Wood, 2002) . Some very innovative and useful visitor safety programmes are discussed in the Adventure section of this book; however, as Tarlow points out in Chapter 7, tourists behave differently when away from home, often doing things in a state of disorientation or 'anomie'. So the tourism response must go beyond the minimum duty of care responsibilities in many cases, to understand and prevent reasonably foreseeable incidents from occurring in the first place. This is not to suggest that tourists do not have to take personal responsibility for their actions, but rather that the relevant authorities need to assist them in making informed choices. For example, some countries have severe penalties for drug trafficking. This should be drawn to the attention of visitors so that there can be no misunderstanding of the consequences if local laws are disregarded. Many tourists are unaware that the drug laws of the host country are applicable, not those of the tourist's citizenship.\n\nMalaysia, for example, strictly enforces its drug laws. Malaysian legislation provides for a mandatory death penalty for convicted drug traffickers. Individuals arrested in possession of 15 g (1/2 ounce) of heroin or 200 g (7 ounces) of marijuana are presumed by law to be trafficking in drugs (http://travel.state.gov/malaysia.html).\n\nFinally, physical and environmental damage can occur if travellers:\n\n\u2022 are unaware of the natural characteristics of the destination, in particular its flora and fauna; \u2022 are not medically prepared for the trip (vaccinations, prophylaxis); \u2022 do not take the necessary precautions when consuming food or drink or for their hygiene; and \u2022 are exposed to dangerous situations arising from the physical environment (e.g. natural disasters and epidemics).\n\nPhysical and environmental risks are also largely personal risks, but are not caused deliberately. Rather, these result from the traveller's ignorance or their disregard for potential risks. In our earlier book on tourist health and safety (Wilks & Page, 2003) , we mentioned that physical and environmental risks do not feature prominently in the tourist health and safety literature, but that a single environmental disaster has the potential to claim a large number of lives. As at 22 January 2005, the confirmed death toll around Asia from the tsunami stood at more than 219,000 and was still expected to rise (Anonymous, 2005) . Nationals from more than 50 countries were killed.\n\nIn Chapter 9, Alison Specht provides coverage of natural disaster management in relation to tourism, which draws on both tourism and mainstream emergency and disaster management literature. As a current issue for tourism it is worth distinguishing between a risk, a crisis and a disaster (Wilks & Moore, 2004) . To some extent the relationship between the three is one of escalation (Figure 1.1) , but there are also basic differences in the literatures for each, and the people who specialize in the associated fields.\n\nAccording to the Australian and New Zealand Standard (Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand, 1999, p. 3), a Risk is:\n\nThe chance of something happening that will have an impact upon objectives. It is measured in terms of consequences and likelihood. \n\nRisk Management is defined as:\n\nAn iterative process consisting of well-defined steps which, taken in sequence, support better decision-making by contributing a greater insight into risks and their impacts. The risk management process can be applied to any situation where an undesired or unexpected outcome could be significant or where opportunities are identified (p. iii).\n\nThese terms are important because they draw our attention to proactive opportunities to take control of a situation through early identification and prevention of risk, as well as strategies to manage risks that emerge from time to time. There is always a chance of some undesirable event occurring, so effective risk management aims to prevent an event escalating 'out of control' and becoming a crisis. According to the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA, 2003, p. 2), a Crisis can be defined as:\n\nAny situation that has the potential to affect long-term confidence in an organization or a product, or which may interfere with its ability to continue operating normally.\n\nWhen a Crisis, in turn, escalates we then have a Disaster, defined by Zamecka and Buchanan (2000, p. 8 \n\nA catastrophic event that severely disrupts the fabric of a community and requires the intervention of the various levels of government to return the community to normality.\n\nThe view presented in the APEC report was that a systematic approach to risk management by both the tourism industry and governments will in many cases prevent a crisis or disaster from occurring (Wilks & Moore, 2004) . However, not all adverse events can be avoided, so risk management must be used to respond quickly and effectively to negative situations. Government leadership is critical for the success of this process, since in the final analysis it is the government at each tourist destination that has the resources and the responsibility to provide a safe experience for visitors.\n\nThe benefit of the WTO framework for identifying sources of risk is that it shows where tourism is exposed to threats. For the tourism-related areas and with individual travellers the industry can take an active and leading role in risk management. Where events external to tourism are the source of threats the industry must establish partnerships with other specialist agencies.\n\nThe recommendation that tourism adopts a risk management approach to protecting its assets, including customers, reflects the widespread use and acceptance of risk management processes by national (Emergency Management Australia, 2000) and international crisis and disaster response agencies (International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, 2002) . Indeed, many of the traditional crisis and emergency classification frameworks are now being challenged and replaced by the risk management approach advocated here (see Crondstedt, 2002) .\n\nThe Australian and New Zealand Standard for Risk Management (Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand, 1999) provides a step-by-step framework for taking control of risks and their impacts. The basic framework is presented in Figure 1 .2, and is well suited to managing the risks associated with the tourism industry.\n\nThe important thing to note about effective risk management is that the five central steps need to be implemented in sequence and then continually evaluated through monitoring/review and communication/consultation. Having a documented plan that sits on the shelf is often more dangerous than not having a plan at all. For the purpose of this chapter, only the first two steps in the risk management process will be discussed. It is in starting the process that most current issues and challenges for tourism are to be found. A full description of the process, with tourism examples provided is available in Wilks and Moore (2004) .\n\nThe first step in the risk management process is focused on the environment in which any tourism organization or destination operates. This is the point where basic parameters or boundaries are set within which risks must be managed. This step requires an understanding of crucial elements that will support or impair the risk management process. Among the crucial elements are internal and external stakeholders. In the case of tourism, without the support of senior government officials there is little point in continuing the process. This was the point made about government leadership previously. In addition to the national government, the following stakeholder groups should be involved in the risk management process at this early stage: \u2022 Financial institutions \u2022 Insurance organizations \u2022 Tourism businesses and related commercial interests at each destination \u2022 Regulators and other government organizations that have authority over activities (e.g., police, emergency services) \u2022 Non-government organizations such as environmental and public interest groups \u2022 The media, who are potential stakeholders as well as conduits of information to other stakeholders.\n\nA critical decision at this first stage is which group or agency should be given the lead role in risk management/crisis or disaster response. This is where an understanding of the risk, crisis and disaster definitions is important. Traditionally, risk planning and low-level problems are retained by tourism authorities (e.g. educational campaigns for tourists about sun protection). A crisis response is traditionally coordinated by police (e.g. a hotel fire), whereas a disaster (e.g. a major flood) is managed by emergency services, often with assistance from the military. In establishing the risk management context for any tourism destination, the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders must be made clear at the outset. This should be documented as part of national policy, and linked to any wider government disaster management plan. Legislative authority and resources must be in place.\n\nThe view expressed in the APEC report (Wilks & Moore, 2004) was that, where possible and appropriate, the police should be given the lead coordinating role in all levels of risk response, since they have legal authority to act on behalf of the government in a range of situations. Tourism has a major responsibility to ensure that policy, plans and partnerships are in place across the tourism sector to support the active role of the police in the event of a crisis situation. One way of achieving these aims is through the formation of a National Tourism Safety and Security Committee (Wilks, 2003b) .\n\nThere are two main issues for tourist health, safety and security at this first step. One is that tourism traditionally does not engage fully with health, law enforcement or emergency service agencies in prevention and planning activities, instead relying on these agencies only when problems arise. The general lack of coordination between tourism and health authorities in many destinations affected by SARS is testimony to this lack of existing collaborative relationships. The second issue is the need to convince governments at the highest level of the importance of protecting tourism. In the APEC report this formed the lead chapter titled 'Protecting Tourism', which documented the economic benefits of tourism to the 21 APEC member states through income, jobs and foreign investment and trade opportunities (Wilks & Moore, 2004) . Only by having genuine commitments at the highest levels of government can the tourism industry cater for the safety of visitors in turbulent times.\n\nThe second step in the risk management process is identifying the risks to be managed. According to the Australian/New Zealand Standard, comprehensive identification using a well-structured systematic process is critical, because a potential risk not identified at this stage is excluded from further analysis. Identification should include all risks, whether or not they are under the control of the tourist destination or national government. Examination of the potential 'indirect' shocks to the tourism industry identified in the Queensland Tourism Crisis Management Plan (Table 1 .3) shows that risks such as currency fluctuations and economic downturns are largely beyond the ability of any one government to control. However, a fairly comprehensive general list of possible risks can be developed based on the WTO framework and the various tourism industry and government sources discussed earlier.\n\nIt is also worth adding general business industry publications to the list of risk sources because for a destination they can be very influential, even if they are not specifically directed at tourism. A good example is the annual RiskMap published by Control Risks Group in London (www.crg.com). RiskMap is described as a guide to conducting business in an uncertain world. Countries are rated according to two types of risk -Political and Security -on a five level scale (insignificant, low, medium, high and extreme) with accompanying commentary. For potential investors and global companies involved in tourism-related activities these risk assessments can have far-reaching consequences. By way of illustration, the 2003 ratings for APEC economies are presented in Table 1 .4.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes in risk management generally is starting with Step 2 (identifying risk) and then moving on towards finding and applying solutions (Step 5treating risks) without ever having secured the authority, cooperation or resources to complete the task properly (Step 1 -establish the context). This is why there are so many sources of valuable information about the risks or threats to the tourism industry, but very few best practice models of how governments and industry are working together in a systematic and effective way. While the WTO (1991) recommended that 'every country develop a national policy on tourism safety commensurate with the prevention of tourist risks', most countries still have no operational policies for the health, safety and security of their visitors. This again comes back to not having high-level political support in the first place. Of all the current issues challenging the global tourism industry, this must rank as one of the highest priorities.\n\nIt is now well accepted that a whole-of-government approach is needed in this area. Tourism must engage the other areas of government that have specialized expertise in health, safety and especially security to form genuine partnerships. The emphasis here is on genuine, since there are many examples of lip service paid to tourism by other arms of government. Demonstrating the huge economic contribution tourism makes in many countries is a sound approach to gaining political support for protecting the tourism industry and its clients (Wilks & Moore, 2004) . \n\nTourism in Turbulent Times presents an international review of the challenges faced by the world's largest industry and governments around the world to provide safe and enjoyable experiences for visitors. The book draws on the background and expertise of contributors from 11 countries, representing scholars, government officers and industry practitioners. It addresses traditional concerns for tourism (such as crime) as well as emerging challenges posed by the global movement of infectious disease and terrorism. Recognizing that tourists are most likely to experience difficulties due to being in unfamiliar environments and participating in unfamiliar activities, an examination is made of popular adventure tourism pursuits. The chapter topics are examined by specialists who share a view that tourism can weather turbulent times through adopting appropriate risk management strategies and continuing to provide quality service for customers. Chapter 1 has provided an overview of the current issues in tourist health, safety and security, emphasizing that tourists are a vulnerable group that must be assisted through genuine partnerships between the tourism industry and governments. Protection of visitors is an essential part of quality service and in many cases is legally required by statute or a common law duty of care. The tourism industry must accept that employment of appropriately skilled staff is required; risk and crisis management are not 'add-on' duties for personnel with other responsibilities. Key sources of information were then identified for the current issues in tourist health, safety and security -noting that risk identification was actually the second step in a formal risk management approach to visitor protection. The first step was Establishing the Context and in particular gaining the authority, cooperation and resources to complete the task properly.\n\nThe development of genuine partnerships across industry and government is a theme that runs throughout this book. The benefit of using the WTO framework for identifying sources of risk is that it shows where tourism is exposed to threats. For the tourism-related areas and with individual travellers the industry can take an active and leading role in risk management and visitor protection. Where events external to tourism are the source of threats the industry must establish partnerships with other specialist agencies, and to a large extent rely on the leadership of national governments. The government and industry initiatives presented in Part 4 show the benefits of genuine partnerships in ensuring visitor health, safety and security."}
