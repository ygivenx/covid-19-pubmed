{"title": "m The first three months of the COVID-19 epidemic: Epidemiological evidence for two separate strains of SARS- CoV-2 viruses spreading and implications for prevention strategies Two epidemics of COVID-19 Table of Content", "body": "The first cases of a new coronavirus strain, termed SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (Cascella 2020) , were reported on 31-12-2019 in Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei province of China. (Jernigan 2020) As of 2020-03-28, 10:00 CET, 591,971 symptomatic cases and 27,090 deaths have been reported from virtually every country in the northern hemisphere (see Section Data), The disease was termed COVID-19 by the WHO on 2020-02-11, and categorized as a pandemic on 2020-03-12, yet the details of the spread and their implications for prevention have not been discussed in sufficient detail. Between 02-14 and 03-16, the Dow Jones fell 31% from 29,440 to 20,188, raising fears for the economy, in general, and retirement savings, in particular. Several administrations have imposed severe restrictions aimed at containment of the virus. For instance,\n\n\u2022 On 03-08, the Italian government imposed a quarantine on 16 million people in the north of Italy, which was followed up on 03-11 with a nationwide closure of all restaurants and bars along with most stores. (WSJ, 2020-03-11) \u2022 on 03-11, the U.S. administration banned travel from 26 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland) . https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-12-20intl-hnk/index.html .\n\n\u2022 On 03-15, New York's Mayor de Blasio reversed his previous position that NY schools should remain open to avoid health care workers from \"staying home and watching their children\" and announced NY public schools to be closed, following many other school systems.\n\n\u2022 From 03-17, all New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut restaurants were had to close. From 03-22, hairdressers and barbers were also closed.\n\n\u2022 From 03-19 California was \"shut down\". \u2022 On 03-22, the lockdown in the Italian region of Lombardy was tightened to ban sports and other physical activity, as well as the use of vending machines.\n\n\u2022 Also on 03-22, the National Guard was activated in New York, California, and Washington State, five senators self-quarantined. NY governor Cuomo mandated that all nonessential businesses close or work from home.\n\nBy the end on 03-20, the Dow Jones was down at 19,173 (35%) from 02-14. On 03-26, the U.S. Senate approved a $2T stimulus package.\n\nFor most of the first three months of the epidemic, much of the response was driven by \"fear, stigma, or discrimination\" (Ren 2020) , including naming SARS-CoV-2 the \"China virus\" (Rogers 2020) , despite the fact that seasonal respiratory zoonotic pathogens typically originate in China, where lifeanimal markets provide chances for animal viruses to transmit to humans. (Malik 2020) After three months, enough data are available to discuss important epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 and the potential impact of interventions. In particular, we have now seen the number of new cases (and deaths) to decline in China and South Korea and to at least stabilize in some European countries. Changes in number of deaths follow the changes in number cases (albeit at a lower level) by about two weeks. Hence, we can discuss both the infectiousness and the lethality of the virus, two important characteristics to assess public health impact of the disease.\n\nThe data were processed with MS Excel. To avoid biases from inappropriate model assumptions only basic descriptive statistics were employed. In some cases, data from only the day before or after (or both) was averaged (up to a three day moving average) to reduce the effects of apparent reporting artifacts (Darwin's natura non facit saltum, (Berry 1985) ) without creating undue biases. The two \"smoothers\" applied were:\n\n\u2022 averaging x0 with a previous x\u22121 (or, rarely, following x+1) data and\n\n\u2022 applying a moving average of (x\u22121, x0, x+1)\u2192(2 x\u22121 + x0, x\u22121 + x0 + x+1, x0 +2 x+1)/3\n\nNo other changes were applied to the data.\n\nLike China in mid-February, the German Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) changed the reporting system in mid-March, which resulted in a near 6-fold increase of the data reported on 03-20 over the data reported on 03-19. Such changes in reporting systems add to the difficulties in interpreting the data.\n\nIf a disease causes immunity after an infectious period of a few days only, like respiratory diseases, an epidemic extinguishes itself as the proportion of immune people increases. Under the SIR model, (Kermack 1991) for a reproduction number (Dietz 1993) (secondary infections by direct contact in a susceptible population) of R0=1.5-2.5 over 7 days (recovery rate: \u03b3=1/7=.14), the noticeable part of the epidemic lasts about 90-45 days (R0/\u03b3=\u03b2=.21-.36) in a homogeneous population of 10M. The period is shorter for smaller more homogenous and longer for larger, more heterogenous populations. For a given infectious period 1/\u03b3 (here, e.g., 7 days. SARS and COVID-19 incubation period plus 2 days (Lauer 2020) ), R0 also determines how long it will take for early cases to become visible after a single import (150-60 days), the peak prevalence of infections (5-22%), and how many people will become immune (55-90%). An arbitrary low rate of disease-related death (0.00001*I/d) has been added to allow for comparison between models.\n\n.

Most cases were seen in the Hubei province of 58.5M people (see Table 1 for population sizes).\n\nBy Mid-January 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were seen in other Asian countries, but incidence remained below about 1/M/d outside of continental China, except for an increase to about 2.5/M/d in Malaysia/Brunei and 10/M/d in Singapore, but including Japan with the largest proportion of people 65 years of age and older in the world (28%). In continental South Korea (population 51M, cumulative incidence 185/M), however, the incidence soon rose to a peak of about 14/M/d between 02-29 and 03-02, before declining to less than 150 cases per day (3/M/d) since 03-12 (Fig 2a) .\n\nIn Iran (cumulative incidence 385/M), incidence rose about a week after South Korea. The top incidence before 03-23 (~15.5 cases/M/d) was about the same (the recent increase on 03-24..28 may indicate a \"rebound\" into a population not immunized by the previous wave(s)). Lethality in Iran was notably higher and followed the increase in cases with a delay of several days (Fig 2b) as also seen in South Korea (Fig 2a, 03 -06 for deaths vs 02-28..03-01 for cases).

Wittkowski: Two epidemics of (2020-03-28) -8- From 03-19 to 03-20, several European countries have seen a more than two-fold increase in the number of cases reported (Germany: 570%, San Marino: 340%, Ireland: 260%, Switzerland: 240%, Austria: 202%). As natura non facit saltum (Darwin: nature doesn't jump), (Berry 1985) such abrupt increases must be, at least in part, the result of reporting or other artifacts. In Germany, for instance, the reporting system was changed between 03-16 and 03-19, so that the number is likely includes cases previously reported only through a parallel system. France, Italy, and Spain also reported an unusual increase by 27-35 percent. All these countries reported lower in the following days. As more data are reported, some averaging has been applied.

Other European countries, where the epidemic started more slowly, may see the peak in early April. Germany is notable for reporting 48,582 cases, but only 325 deaths (03-28). See Fig 1 for legend. Data in Germany is based on cases reported electronically to the Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) and transmitted to the ECDC, but the RKI also provides two sources of data on its Web site that are difficult to reconcile with these data.

The incidence is still lower than in the older European population, but keeps rising, as \"more and more states are reporting\" (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/casesupdates/summary.html, accessed on 03-18). The increase seen is consistent with the dynamics of an emerging epidemic. Cumulative incidence in the US (260/M) is still about half of that in Europe (507/M), which reflects, at least in part, the later onset of the epidemic in the US. \n\nThe effect of reducing the reproduction number by reducing the number of contacts (\"containment\", \"Social Distancing\") depends on when it starts in the course of the epidemic. Fig 10 shows the effect of a one-month intervention cutting R0 in half starting at the point of the peak prevalence of infectious subjects. Compared to Fig 1, the duration of the epidemic is shortened, albeit at the price of reducing the R/S ratio, so that a subsequent epidemic with the same are similar virus (cross-immunity) could start earlier.

The more narrow bell curve with a post-peak intervention indicates the reduction in number of infections and, thus, deaths. (spreadsheet for model calculations available from https://app.box.com/s/pa446z1csxcvfksgi13oohjm3bjg86ql ) Fig 11 shows a one-month intervention starting about two weeks earlier, at the turning point where the curve of the new cases changes from increasing faster to increasing more slowly. This intervention reduces the number of deaths, but the epidemic is extinguished two months later and the R/S ratio (\"herd immunity\") is further decreased. Fig 11. Even if the intervention is extended from one to four months no herd immunity is created and, thus, the epidemic rebounds.\n\n` .

It is assumed that a highly effective intervention reduces R0 by 50% for 4 months, beginning after the appearance of a novel type of cases is noticed. The death rate of 5K/10M is arbitrary. (spreadsheet for model calculations available from https://app.box.com/s/pa446z1csxcvfksgi13oohjm3bjg86ql ) In summary, there is a narrow window-of-opportunity for interventions (\"flattening the curve\") aiming to improve public health by reducing R0:\n\n\u2022 Starting after the peak prevalence (of infections) has little effect (not shown). The curve goes down, but is not \"flattened\".\n\n\u2022 Starting at the peak prevalence gives the epidemic a \"coup de grace\", shortening its duration, albeit at the price of reducing the R/S ratio. The curve is narrower, but not \"flattened\".\n\n\u2022 Starting at the peak incidence \"flattens\" the curve without broadening it and maximizes the number of deaths prevented during the current epidemic, but reduces herd immunity and, thus, the chance of another epidemic coming sooner.\n\n\u2022 Starting before the peak incidence \"flattens the curve\", but also broadens it and causes a rebound, unless the intervention is continued for many more months.\n\nIt is herd immunity that stops the spread of an infectious disease, so in general, one would want to let the epidemic initially run its natural course (or even accelerate it, as people have traditionally done with \"measles parties\") to build immunity as fast as possible.\n\nTo reduce the duration of the epidemic and its impact on the economy (and also increase the time until the next epidemic can spread), one would wait until the prevalence of infectious people (I) reaches its peak (in the above model: day 83, red).\n\nWithout repeated broad testing, however, this date cannot be directly observed, but it is known that peak prevalence of infected people is followed about a week by peak number of new cases. This is too late to make a decision, but the SIR model shows that this peak preceded by two weeks by the \"turning point\" in cases where the curve of the new cases changes from increasing faster to increasing more slowly (day 76), which can be estimated from the observed cases in time to making a decision. (It is also about 50% of the peak number of new cases, which one might be able to predict.) Hence, peak prevalence (of infections) follows the turning point/half peak (in number of cases) by about a week. The window of opportunity for starting an intervention is the week following the turning point in number of cases per day.\n\n` .

Instead, the results reflect raw incidences over time as reported by the ECDC, depicted by country or region of neighboring countries.\n\nA shortcoming of such an entirely data-based approach is that it lacks the sophistication and potential additional insights that could come from fitting, e.g., differential equation models. The only modeling assumption made is that curves should be \"smooth\" (except when reporting artifacts are suspected), but even then, data were redistributed only to the directly neighboring day.\n\nStill, the evidence is strong enough to draw qualitative conclusions about possible scenarios for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the near future. Also, the results suggest strategies to explore the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus strains and to select prevention strategies.\n\nDuring the 2003 SARS epidemic the number of new cases peaked about three weeks after the initial increase of cases was noticed and then declined by 90% within a month. Table 1 shows the relevant timepoints for the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic. The SARS-C0V-2 data also suggest that it takes at least a month from the first case entering the country (typically followed by others) for the epidemic to be detected, about three weeks for the number of cases to peak and a month for the epidemic to \"resolve\". This data is consistent with the results from the SIR model (see Epidemiological Models).

Based on these similarities, one could predict the COVID-19 epidemic to end before 04-15 in Europe and about two weeks later in the U.S.\n\nThe time and height of the peak incidence if cases in the different countries are consistent with the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 moved step-by-step westward from China, via other Asian countries to Middle East (Iran. Qatar, and Bahrain), Southern Europe (Italy, followed by its neighbors CH/F/ES/AT/SI), central and northern Europe, and, finally, the US.\n\nViruses improve their \"survival\" if they develop strategies to coexist with the (human) host. (Woolhouse 2007) Multiple coronaviruses have been found to coexist in bat populations. (Ge 2016) The emerging COVID-19 data is consistent with the hypothesis that (at least) two SARS-CoV-2 strains have developed. One strain, which traveled through South Korea, remained more infectious, while the other strain, which traveled through other Asian countries lost more of its infectiousness. The strain that passing through South Korea and then Iran and Italy (SKII strain) showed high lethality in Iran and Italy, but less lethality when it traveled to Italy's neighbors, either because of differences in health systems, because the strain mutated back, or because a strain arriving directly from Asia had the advantage of spreading first. Only sequencing samples from these countries can help to answer these questions. \n\nMainland China is not reporting relevant numbers of novel cases anymore and Hubei reports no new cases since 03-19. The number of new cases in South Korea also has declined to low levels since its peak around 02-30. Maritime Southeast Asia continues to show low levels of new cases only (<2.5/M/d), with the possible exception of Singapore and Malaysia/Brunei. .

Iran was hit about a week after South Korea (around 03-07), with a similar peak incidence, but higher lethality (red bars in Fig 2) . The data also suggests a second wave of infections in Iran, which may have peaked on 03-15. Italy was hit a week after the first wave in Iran (which peaked around 03-07/08, Fig 4a) . Incidence in Italy reached a substantially higher incidence than reported in Iran. The peak incidence in Italy may have been reached on 03-22 (at about 100/M/d).\n\nWithout sufficiently detailed genetic data, it is not clear whether the high lethality in Italy is due to genetic variations in the virus or to Italy having the second oldest populations in the world (after Japan). A 03-20 report by the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, (COVID-19 Surveillance Group 2020) however, implicates that age and comorbidities played a role -among 3200 deaths, mostly in Lombardy and Emilia-Romana, median age was 80 years (IQR 73-85, only were 36 below the age of 50), 98.8% had at least one comorbidity (hypertension: 74%, diabetes: 34%, ischemic heart disease: 30%, atrial fibrillation, 22%, chronic renal failure: 20%, \u2026).\n\nThe epidemiological data does not support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 spread from Munich in Germany to Italy. (Kupferschmidt 2020) Instead, the virus may have spread from Italy to its neighboring countries, Switzerland, France, Spain, Austria, and Slovenia, within just a few days of arriving from Iran. The top incidence seems to be less than half of that in Italy and the lethality is lower, too. While Italy has many people 65 years and older (23%, second only to Japan data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS ), the relatively small differences or age distribution within Europe (e.g., Germany: 21%) are unlikely to account for much of this difference. A possible explanation (indicated in Fig 6) is that the less virulent strain(s) arriving from other parts of Asia may have had a head start in those countries, so that imported infections from Italy met subjects who had already developed (cross) resistance against both strains.\n\nInfections in Scandinavia arrived yet another half week later, but peaked around 03-12. The recent data may indicate a second wave more similar to other European countries. The parts of Europe not hit by the SKII strain may remain at much lower levels (below 30/M/d, except for effects of the recent changes in the reporting systems). Overall, incidence in Europe seems to be leveling off. After the effects of the changes I the reporting system have ceased, incidence in Europe may peak soon at about 40/M/d.\n\nFrom Table 1 , SARS-CoV-2 has arrived in the U.S. almost a week after it arrived in Europe. The incidence is still low (currently at about 55/M/d) and is likely to continue to increase until early April. If incidence in the U.S. were to peak at about 75/M/d, as in Europe as a whole (Fig 4b) , one would expect new cases to peak at up to 25,000 per day and the cumulative incidence could reach 600/M (3 times the number of cases per million people in South Korea to account for a longer course because of the size of the countries) or a total of 200,000 cases, and, at 2% lethality, about 4,000 deaths, about four times the currently reported cumulative number of 1,079. These are conservative estimates, because only 1% of cases died in South Korea over the course of the epidemic and both countries have a similar proportion of people older than 65 years (14% vs 16%) On the other hand, the numbers could double if the SKII strain should have hit the US earlier. A number of 4000-8000 U.S. death over the course of the epidemic compares to an expected number of 16,000-78,000 influenza deaths per season from pneumonia and respiratory/circulatory complications alone, which also occur predominantly among people at 65 years of age and older. (Rolfes 2018) .\n\nThe precise number of people dying depends on (a) which virus strain got to the US first and (b) how early people are being treated against severe complications (e.g., pneumonia).\n\n.

For instance, during much of the HIV epidemic, there was widespread fear that HIV could establish itself in the population as a whole, even though the data (including data showing absence of transmission to the wives of hemophiliacs) (Wittkowski 1995a) and models (Wittkowski 1992; Seydel 1994) contradicted this fear. (Wittkowski 1995b; 1996) These results have been repeatedly confirmed. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019; Haddad 2019) In the case of heterosexual transmission of HIV one could argue that there was little risk associated with a the public health policy promoting condom use, but in the case of COVID-19 prevention, ignoring models and data may carry substantial risk.\n\nDuring the AIDS epidemic, epidemiologists had the advantage that, in addition to the date of report, the date of diagnosis was available for analysis so that variations in reporting delays, such as mid-February in China, 03-20 in Germany, and 03-26 in Canada, could be accounted for. Unfortunately, the public COVID-19 data lacks that information.\n\nA major problem with respiratory diseases is that one cannot stop all chains of infections within families, friends, neighbors, \u2026 . Even after a couple of weeks of \"lockdown\" there will be a few infectuous persons, and as long as there are enough susceptible people in the society, this is enough to re-start the epidemic until there are enough immune people in the society to create \"herd immunity\". Hence, one would expect the cases to appear in waves (Fig 12, the period of the \"lockdown\" corresponds to March to May, 2020 in the U.S.). Such waves of cases have been seen in different countries and the longer than expected duration of the epidemic supports the hypothesis that the social distancing / lockdown interventions had some effect, albeit at a high cost for approx. 10% of deaths saved. This analysis of the publicly available data suggests that at the time Italy imposed quarantine on the Lombardy and adjacent regions on 03-08, the SKII virus strain had already reached the adjacent countries (Switzerland, France, Spain, Austria, Slovenia). Even though the lockdown started early (03-08), which may have caused a rebound consistent with a decline in compliance.\n\nIn the US, the growth in reported cases per day slowed down after 03-20, yet there is no sign of a turning point, yet. Still, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut restaurants were ordered to closed from 03-20; the shutdown of California was ordered on [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . As social distancing was ordered before the epidemic reached its turning point, a \"flattened curve\" is to be expected, but the curve will also be broader.\n\nSome containment strategies could even be counterproductive in other ways. For instance, the simple model used in Fig 12 does not account for age-stratification. In diseases such as COVID-19, where children develop mostly mild forms, while elderly people have a high risk of dying. (Zimmermann Curtis 2020) Hence, containment of high-risk groups, like elderly people in nursing homes (see the Washington State example) is highly effective in protecting them from becoming infected and reducing the pool that would have to reach herd immunity. A substantial increase in the duration of the epidemic, however, might make effective containment of the elderly more difficult and, thus, increase the number of deaths among the elderly.\n\n.

Hence, the optimal time point for starting a New York public health intervention to reduce duration and impact of the COVID-19 epidemic was around 03-27. Social segregation against COVID-19 in NY, as one of the epicenters of the U.S. epidemic, started about 03-17 (day 73) with restaurants being closed, and intensified on 03-22 (day 78) with all non-essential businesses being closed. Because of the Easter holiday, restrictions are discussed to be lifted on 04-12 (day 100). The model predicts that such an intervention would reduce the number of deaths in New York and Detroit (and possibly some other parts of the U.S., but the virus would linger on for another two months, so that it would not be safe for (elderly) high-risk people to participate in this year's Easter activities. \n\nUntil a vaccine will become available, the only pharmacological strategy to reduce the number of deaths is to reduce the damage the infection (and immune system) does, e.g., by reducing the initial viral load, (Chu 2004) and making sure that people get treated at the earliest signs of pneumonia.\n\nAside from separating susceptible populations (elderly and high-risk subjects, e.g., in nursing homes) from the epidemic, which is effective as long as virus is circulating, public health intervention aiming to contain a respiratory disease need to start within a narrow window of opportunity starting at or a week after the curve of the new cases changes from increasing faster to increasing more slowly. Unless the containment efforts started earlier and prevented the epidemic from generating a sufficient number of immune people, the containment efforts can cease after about a month or two (depending on late or early start, respectively), when the ratio of infectious vs immune people is too low to for the disease to rebound. When the window of opportunity has been missed, containment has only limited impact on the course of the epidemic.\n\nTo determine that time point, case data collected and reported needs to contain not only the date of report, but also the date of \"diagnosis\" and whether the patient had clinical symptoms or was merely tested positive and whether the patient was positive for circulating virus RNA/DNA (currently infectious) or antibodies (already immune).\n\n.
