{"title": "", "body": "Physical Examination of the Newborn Foal \u2022 Physical examination is fundamental to the workup of the critically ill foal. To fully understand the subtle changes associated with disease, one must be familiar with the physical examination findings and behavior of the healthy foal. Healthy, term foals are precocious neonates that can stand and nurse from the udder within 2 hours of delivery. Practice Tip: An easy rule of thumb is the \"1,2,3\" rule: most foals should stand by 1 hour, they should nurse by 2 hours, and the placenta should be passed by the mare within 3 hours postpartum. Normal vital signs change dramatically within the first 24 hours of life (Table 31 -1).\n\n\u2022 At 1 minute of age, the foal should have a heart rate and respiratory rate >60. By 1 to 2 hours after birth, the heart rate should be 80 to 120 beats/min, and the respiratory rate should be 30 to 40 breaths/min. \u2022 At 10 minutes of age, a normal, healthy foal has an effective suckle reflex, can sit sternally without assistance, and attempts to rise within 20 minutes. \u2022 A finger inserted in the ear or nostril results in a head shake and a grimace reflex. \u2022 Thoracolumbar stimulation performed by briskly running the thumb and forefinger down either side of the foal's thoracolumbar spine elicits attempts to rise characterized by throwing the front legs forward, lifting the head and neck upward, and trying to push off with the hind limbs. \u2022 The foal's heart rate at this age approaches 100 beats/ min, and the respiratory rate averages between 40 and 60 breaths/min. \u2022 A newborn foal that displays generalized hypotonia and an inability to rise, sit sternally, or suckle may be suffering from the following: \u2022 Peripartum hypoxia/asphyxia or other adverse peripartum challenge \u2022 In utero-acquired sepsis \u2022 Prematurity or dysmaturity \u2022 A thorough history of peripartum events and careful examination of the foal and placenta help differentiate among these conditions. \u2022 Scleral injection and mucosal hemorrhages (petechiae) are consistent with sepsis in the neonate, and these findings warrant consideration of sepsis until proven otherwise. \u2022 Signs of hypovolemic shock in the neonatal foal include:\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 Practice Tip: A history of premature separation of placental membranes, prolonged delivery or dystocia, and meconium staining of the foal or placenta are periparturient events associated with acute or chronic hypoxia/asphyxia. \u2022 A maternal history of prepartum purulent vaginal discharge, precocious udder development and lactation, or evidence of abnormal discoloration of the placenta, particularly in the area of the cervical star, increases the index of suspicion for placentitis and in utero sepsis or fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) associated with abnormal cytokine release. \u2022 Note: A normal placenta weighs approximately 10% to 11% of the foal's birth weight. Evaluate unusually heavy (or light) placentas by means of gross and light microscopic examination. \u2022 Peracute cases of placentitis may produce only generalized edema without obvious areas of infection. \u2022 Small placentas with large areas of abnormal villus formation have been associated with neonatal dysmaturity. \u2022 Therefore, histopathologic examination of the placenta is strongly recommended if a neonate shows early abnormalities. \u2022 Practice Tip: Foals born with high serum creatinine concentration, especially when blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is normal, should be suspected of having had abnormal placental function in utero with \"spurious hypercreatinemia. \" These foals should be evaluated and monitored closely for 3 days for signs of neonatal encephalopathy and sepsis.\n\n\u2022 This is a better prognostic indicator for the premature foal than is the inverted neutrophil : lymphocyte ratio. \u2022 Practice Tip: Hypoglycemia is common in premature foals. \u2022 Some foals born after a prolonged gestation have slightly different clinical features, characterized by a large frame size with poor muscle development, erupted incisors, and long hair coats.\n\n\u2022 The physiological findings may be similar to those of dysmature foals, but these foals are considered \"postmature. \"\n\n\u2022 At birth and during delivery, it is normal for mucous membranes of foals to appear cyanotic; however, this should resolve rapidly as the neonate makes the transition to extrauterine life. The mucous membranes of a healthy neonate quickly become pale pink with a capillary refill time (CRT) of 1 to 2 seconds. Pale mucous membranes suggest anemia or hypovolemia, whereas pale yellow mucous membranes are consistent with the presence of icterus, as occurs with neonatal isoerythrolysis; hepatopathy; and occasionally, sepsis. \u2022 Gray or slightly blue mucous membranes indicate shock, poor peripheral perfusion, or hypoxemia. Cyanosis appears only if the PaO 2 is <35 to 45 mm Hg and only when the packed cell volume (PCV) is within the normal range. Tissue or organ damage may begin when PaO 2 is <60 mm Hg. \u2022 Practice Tip: Do not rely on mucous membrane color to diagnose hypoxemia. \u2022 Hyperemic, injected mucous membranes and hyperemic coronary bands may indicate sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS). Petechiae on oral mucous membranes or inside the pinnae also are associated with sepsis and SIRS. Icteric mucous membranes may be observed with hemolysis, sepsis, hepatic disease or dysfunction, equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) infection, and meconium retention. \u2022 Practice Tip: It is important to differentiate large-and small-vessel injection. Small-vessel injection imparts a generalized or diffuse, bright red appearance to the mucous membranes and suggests more severe disease. \u2022 The sclera should be white with only faint vessels apparent.\n\nSignificant injection is indicative of sepsis/SIRS. Prominent scleral hemorrhages can also be observed after birth trauma, but this should rapidly improve over the first 2 to 3 days of life. \u2022 Differential diagnoses for icterus in the neonatal foal include the following:\n\n\u2022 Liver or biliary disease: Examples are hepatic dysfunction as part of multiple organ failure resulting from sepsis, hepatitis/cholangitis (bacterial or viral, especially equine herpes virus, or congenital malformations), biliary atresia or dysfunction, glycogen branching\n\n\u2022 The possibility of kidney injury in utero, although rare, is evaluated by urinalysis and renal and urinary tract ultrasonography. \u2022 The serum or plasma creatinine in foals with spurious increases should rapidly decrease.\n\n\u2022 Definition: Prematurity is a relative term indicating that the gestational length was inadequate for an individual mare. \u2022 The gestational length in mares can vary widely (320 to 365 days); however, the individual mare has a relatively consistent gestational length from year to year.\n\n\u2022 Therefore, a foal born to a 320-day gestational length may be normal for one mare, while premature for another. \u2022 Foals from abnormally long gestations can also exhibit signs of prematurity. The term dysmaturity rather than prematurity may be more appropriate in these cases.\n\n\u2022 These foals may be the result of intrauterine growth retardation, often the result of placental insufficiency. \u2022 Abnormally large foals occur in mares with prolonged gestation, often as a result of fescue toxicity; these foals are generally healthy in utero but may have an increased mortality as a result of high incidence of dystocia. \u2022 Unusually short (<320 days) or abnormally long (>360 days) gestation has been associated with the birth of foals with signs of prematurity, including the following: \u2022 Small body size \u2022 Fine, silky hair coat \u2022 Generalized weakness; hypotonia \u2022 Increased passive range of limb motion \u2022 Flexor tendon and periarticular ligament laxity \u2022 Incomplete cuboidal bone ossification, usually in premature foals \u2022 Domed forehead \u2022 Floppy ears \u2022 Inability to regulate body temperature \u2022 Many premature foals have inverted neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios, with a neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio <1 : 1, unless they have experienced subacute to chronic intrauterine stress, in which case the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio is normal to high.\n\n\u2022 Hyperkalemia is most common with anuric renal failure or uroperitoneum (ruptured bladder) but also occurs with massive tissue damage resulting from severe shock (sick cell syndrome, hypoxia/ asphyxia) or muscular diseases such as white muscle disease. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and adrenal dysfunction are other differential diagnoses. \u2022 Treatment of hyperkalemia is with potassium-free fluids (such as 0.9% saline or isotonic sodium bicarbonate); calcium (do not mix with bicarbonate; dose depends on ionized calcium laboratory results), add 0.2 to 1.0 mL/kg of 23% calcium gluconate diluted in saline once (no more than 50 mL 23% calcium gluconate per liter of saline or as guided by ionized calcium concentrations); dextrose (4 to 8 mg/kg/min), insulin (0.005 to 0.01, up to 0.1 U/kg/h of regular insulin); and sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq/kg diluted in fluids over \u226515 minutes; do not mix with calcium).\n\n\u2022 The most common cause of bradycardia is hypoxemia or severe anemia leading to tissue (myocardial) hypoxia. \u2022 Many foals respond readily to increased oxygen in the inspired air administered by means of a mask, intranasal insufflation, flow-by oxygen, or nasotracheal intubation and ventilation. \u2022 In cases of severe anemia, as with neonatal isoerythrolysis, blood transfusion is indicated.\n\n\u2022 Tachycardia occurs with the following: \u2022 Sepsis or SIRS: Fever often is absent at examination in the neonate. Hypothermia is more common. \u2022 Hypovolemia, hypotension \u2022 Hypoxemia \u2022 Anemia \u2022 Pain: abdominal or musculoskeletal \u2022 Stress \u2022 Cardiac failure or congenital cardiac anomalies \u2022 Hyperthermia \u2022 Hypocalcemia: occurs with severe asphyxia Murmurs \u2022 Many foals have physiological flow murmurs that may persist for several days after birth. \u2022 Soft, blowing murmurs usually are associated with turbulent blood flow and are exacerbated by anemia or alterations in hemodynamics.\n\n\u2022 These are typically grade III/VI or less in intensity. \u2022 The typical patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) murmur is a continuous machinery murmur or a holosystolic murmur (most common) loudest over the left side of the base of the heart. \u2022 Practice Tip: Persistent or loud (>grade II/VI) murmurs; murmurs present for more than 5 to 7 days after birth that do not resolve or diminish in intensity; or murmurs associated with exercise intolerance, persistent tachycardia, or enzyme deficiency (GBED), Tyzzer's disease, and toxic or drug-induced hepatopathy. \u2022 Neonatal herpes viremia \u2022 Neonatal isoerythrolysis or other hemolysis \u2022 Meconium retention (meconium is rich in bilirubin):\n\nIntestinal reabsorption of unconjugated bilirubin occurs and contributes to neonatal icterus. \u2022 Septic foals may sporadically have increases in both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin without evidence of liver dysfunction.\n\n\u2022 The cardiac rhythm of a neonate should be regular. However, nonpathologic sinus arrhythmia may be present for a few hours postpartum. \u2022 Up to 15 minutes postpartum, normal foals may exhibit wandering pacemaker, atrial premature contraction, atrial fibrillation, ventricular premature con traction, partial atrioventricular block, and tachycardias.\n\n\u2022 However, the duration should be short (5 minutes) and should disappear within 15 minutes of birth. \u2022 Heart rate averages between 70 and 110 beats/min during the first week of life.\n\nBradycardia is associated with hypoglycemia, hypothermia, hyperkalemia, and tissue hypoxia.\n\n\u2022 Hypoglycemia: Use a stall-side dextrometer or glucometer, available in most human pharmacies, to monitor or measure blood glucose (see Chapter 15, p. 111). The AlphaTRAK 1 has been validated for use in foals. Stall-side dextrometers may be inaccurate under conditions of high humidity or extremes of temperature. \u2022 Avoid the temptation to administer a bolus dose of 50% dextrose. \u2022 Introduce 5% dextrose as a constant rate infusion beginning at 4 mg/kg/min equaling a rate of 4.8 mL/kg/h of 5% dextrose. \u2022 Increase the rate or concentration up to 8 mg/kg/min (no more than 15% dextrose) as needed to reach a target glucose concentration in the foal between 60 and 180 mg/dL.\n\n\u2022 Carefully rewarm the foal.\n\n\u2022 Unless bradycardia is present, the rewarming should occur slowly during initiation of other therapies in order to avoid rapid increase in metabolic rate; target approximately 1\u00b0 F per hour. \u2022 Heating pads, covers, heat lamps, and IV fluid warmers can also be used but should frequently be reassessed to avoid thermal damage or overheating.\n\n\u2022 Be careful of direct heat application in the form of warming pads because they may \"thermally\" damage the skin.\n\n\u2022 Respiratory distress is exacerbated by recumbency and characterized by the following: \u2022 Nostril flare \u2022 Expiratory grunting \u2022 Rib retraction \u2022 Increased abdominal effort \u2022 In paradoxical respiration, the chest wall collapses during inspiration. This is referred to as a flail chest and is a lifethreatening medical condition that occurs most commonly when multiple (usually 3 or more) adjacent ribs are broken in multiple places. The flail segment moves in the opposite direction as the rest of the chest wall during respiration. \u2022 In some cases, respiratory distress is associated with congenital upper airway abnormalities such as choanal atresia and subepiglottic cysts, warranting endoscopic examination. \u2022 Rule out rib fractures (gentle palpation, ultrasonographic evaluation of ribs) in all foals showing respiratory distress or abnormal respiratory function. This is done early in the examination and before the foal is forcefully restrained.\n\n\u2022 Apneic episodes, slow respiratory rates, or irregular respiratory patterns such as apnea interspersed with tachypnea (e.g., \"cluster breathing, \" ataxic respiratory patterns), are abnormal and are associated with the following: \u2022 Central respiratory depression resulting from asphyxia or extrauterine maladaptation-generally the most common cause in neonatal intensive care units \n\n\u2022 The resting respiratory rate of a newborn foal averages between 20 and 40 breaths/min; immediately after birth, the respiratory rate should be >60 breaths/min. \u2022 Because foals have a thin chest wall and a relatively rapid respiratory rate, thoracic auscultation often reveals air movement throughout the chest and absence of crackles and wheezes even when there is lung pathology, especially diffuse interstitial disease. \u2022 Moist end-expiratory crackles and \"fluid\" (large airway) sounds are commonly auscultated immediately after birth as the normal foal expands its lungs. \u2022 Unusually quiet adventitial lung sounds associated with large airway sounds auscultated immediately after birth can be compatible with incomplete alveolar inflation and lung atelectasis. Ingestion of colostrum and the act of sucking itself enhance gastrointestinal (GI) motility and the passage of meconium and feces.\n\n\u2022 The first manure a foal passes, meconium, is composed of cellular debris, intestinal secretions, bilirubin, and amniotic fluid ingested by the fetus. \u2022 Meconium is a dark, blackish brown color and is firm, pelletlike, or pasty. \u2022 Practice Tip: All meconium should be passed within 24 hours of birth and is followed by a softer, yellow/orange to tan \"milk feces. \"\n\n\u2022 Meconium or fecal impaction: Aboral or distal impactions usually can be found by means of careful and welllubricated digital rectal examination, although abdominal radiography or ultrasonography may be needed to find more proximal (orad) impactions.\n\n\u2022 Many foals allow abdominal palpation. In these cases, if abdominal distention is not severe, meconium may sometimes be palpated. \u2022 Some foals have meconium retention without colic, particularly when they are obtunded or weak as with prematurity or hypoxic-ischemic injury. In these cases, passage of meconium/feces is delayed because of primary GI dysfunction, but it does not necessarily result in colic and is common in foals with peripartum asphyxia or sepsis. Such foals may be less tolerant of enteral feeding because of this meconium retention and remain so until the meconium impaction is resolved. \u2022 Foals with true meconium impaction may become uncomfortable because of proximal (orad) gas distention. \u2022 Practice Tip: Meconium impaction is most common in colts that do not receive adequate volume of colostrum. \u2022 Enteritis (see Chapter 18, p. 220) is a cause of colic in foals, particularly in the early stages before development of diarrhea.\n\n\u2022 Fever and leukopenia are other clinical findings suggestive of enteritis. \u2022 Ultrasonographic evidence of thickened, fluid-filled small intestine with some motility is a diagnostic finding. \u2022 Ileus can develop secondary to hypoxic-ischemic or asphyxial injury, sepsis, hypovolemia, prematurity, or shock. \u2022 Intussusception may be found with ultrasound (target lesion sign) (see Chapter 14, p. 88). \u2022 Gastroduodenal ulceration: Classic signs of this problem in older foals include rolling onto the back, sialorrhea or ptyalism, and odontoprisis (grinding teeth). The foals often have poor body condition.\n\n\u2022 Ulcers can be clinically silent in the neonatal foal.\n\n\u2022 Upper airway endoscopy is valuable in assessment for congenital anomalies and laryngeal dysfunction.\n\n\u2022 Absence of manure passage can be associated with the following:\n\n\u2022 Atresia coli: Suggested by lack of fecal-staining in enema fluid and the absence of fecal colored material in the rectum; white mucus may be present. A B\n\n\u2022 Gas distention of the small intestine characterized by gasfluid interfaces within the lumen can be found in foals with ileus caused by enteritis, peritonitis, neonatal gastroenteropathy, neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, and smallintestinal obstruction (see Chapter 18, p. 191 ). \u2022 Concurrent large-bowel distention is frequently associated with ileus caused by neonatal gastroenteropathy, neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, or enteritis. \u2022 Primary large-bowel distention occurs with obstruction caused by meconium impaction/retention, volvulus, or displacement. Sand or dirt accumulation can also be detected in foals with pica. Meconium can be seen in some cases of meconium impaction. \u2022 Radiographic settings on portable and stationary machines vary a great deal and depend on the model and brand of the unit, cassettes, film-screen combinations, and focal distance. Consultation with a radiologist or radiologic technician is recommended for guidelines.\n\n\u2022 Barium enema radiographic examination (barium mixed with warm water and administered by gravity flow through a cuffed Foley catheter inserted in the rectum) helps identify meconium impaction and may aid in the diagnosis of atresia coli. \u2022 White foals born of frame overo heritage, or to two known carriers of the overo lethal white syndrome mutation, retain the barium with no or little expulsion from the anus. The diameter of the small colon is often reduced as compared with normal foals. \u2022 Upper GI contrast radiography is used to document delayed gastric emptying and prolonged transit time that occur with ileus, obstruction, and gastroduodenal ulcer disease. This is particularly helpful in foals with gastric outflow obstruction/dysfunction due to ulcers or strictures in the duodenum. \u2022 Contrast radiography of the upper GI tract is performed by administering 5 mL/kg barium sulfate suspension through a nasogastric tube. Serial radiographs are obtained 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes, and 2 and 4 hours after administration of the contrast agent. Contrast radiography is used to find GI obstruction, ulceration, and delayed transit time. Normal findings are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Barium begins leaving the stomach immediately and is gone after 1 1 2 to 2 hours. \u2022 The cecum fills by 2 hours. \u2022 The transverse colon fills by 3 hours. \n\n\u2022 Palpate the umbilicus, inguinal region, and scrotum (in colts) for congenital hernias. The testes may not be descended at birth or may move back and forth through the inguinal canal.\n\n\u2022 Practice Tip: Time to first urination is generally 6 to 12 hours; fillies take longer than colts to void for the first time.\n\nthickness should be <3 mm and there should be a minimal amount of peritoneal fluid. \u2022 Round, fluid-distended loops of bowel can be seen with ileus, enteritis, and small-bowel obstructive disease. \u2022 Enteritis results in a generalized increase in bowel wall thickness and edema, and there is usually at least some motility, although often nonprogressive. \u2022 Severe neonatal gastroenteropathy or neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis bowel diseases can produce focal increases in bowel wall thickness with or without intramural gas accumulation (i.e., pneumatosis intestinalis). \u2022 Small-intestinal intussusception has a doughnut-shaped pattern (\"target lesion\") caused by the telescoping of one segment of bowel into another; the intussusceptum invaginates into the intussuscipiens (see Chapter 14, p. 88). \u2022 The presence of an excessive volume of clear, nonechogenic peritoneal fluid is compatible with uroperitoneum; however, comparison of abdominal to serum creatinine concentration needs to be evaluated for a definitive diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Other differential diagnoses include effusions associated with intestinal diseases and cardiac failure. \u2022 An increase in peritoneal fluid echogenicity is associated with increased cellularity with: \u2022 Because of a persistent frenulum, many colts do not drop the penis to urinate for the first week or more after birth: this is normal. Resist the urge to exteriorize the penis because this is uncomfortable for the foal, can cause penile or preputial trauma, and is not necessary. \u2022 The specific gravity of the first urine produced usually is >1.035 because of fetal (in utero) urine. Within 24 hours the urine should be hyposthenuric <1.010 although it can occasionally be higher. \u2022 Observe for urination closely to be certain the foal does not have a patent urachus, in which case urine \"drips\" from the umbilicus. \u2022 Colts urinating in their prepuce may appear to have a patent urachus because the urine runs down the ventral abdomen and drops off the external umbilical remnant or may create one because of the umbilical stump being constantly urine soaked. \u2022 Healthy, well-hydrated foals urinate frequently, often after nursing. Urine specific gravity is low in nursing foals (often 1.001 to 1.010) because of the high-volume liquid diet in the form of milk. \u2022 Foals with peripartum asphyxia may have oliguria because of decreased renal blood flow and urine production (neonatal nephropathy) which warrants close monitoring of urine output. \u2022 Dysuria or stranguria can be observed in foals with:\n\n\u2022 Uroperitoneum \u2022 Urachitis, patent urachus \u2022 Cystitis \u2022 Cystic blood clots resulting from umbilical bleeding \u2022 Urachal diverticulum \u2022 Occasionally, foals with hypoxic-ischemic injury (peripartum asphyxia) cannot urinate despite greatly distended bladders. Such foals have stranguria and require indwelling urinary catheterization for 1 or more days until the micturition reflex normalizes in order to prevent bladder rupture.\n\n\u2022 Soft infant feeding tubes, Foley or Cook catheters (5F to 8F) can be used as urinary catheters. \u2022 Closed systems with sterile urinary bags are optimal.\n\nPractice Tip: \"One way valves, \" such as a condom with the end cut off, can be used on the end of urinary catheters in ambulatory foals where a closed system is impractical. \u2022 Note: A lack of urine production due to oliguria, anuria, uroperitoneum, or abnormal micturition reflexes is considered an emergency, and the cause is pursued when a euvolemic neonatal foal has not urinated for 2 hours or more. Foals receiving IV fluid therapy urinate at least hourly. \u2022 Uroperitoneum associated with a urachal or bladder defect at the site of urachal attachment most likely occurs in the postpartum period in association with: Important: All septic and peripartum asphyxia foals should be evaluated for the presence of ulcers with fluorescein stain. \u2022 Entropion is common in premature and dysmature foals.\n\nMost of these cases are transient and respond to temporary sutures for a few to 20 days.\n\n\u2022 After local anesthesia, two to three single vertical mattress sutures are placed in the affected eyelid using 4.0 silk or nylon. Skin staples may also be used. \u2022 Congenital cataracts can be removed surgically if determined to be congenital and not resulting from inflammation.\n\n\u2022 Phacoemulsification of the lens is highly successful and best performed in foals under 6 months of age.\n\n\u2022 Healthy foals are bright, alert, and responsive to touch and sound. \u2022 While being restrained in a standing position, normal foals often alternate between periods of hyperactivity and struggling and episodes of sudden, complete relaxation (flopping). \u2022 Foals should stand with an erect, angular head and neck carriage and a base wide stance in front. \u2022 Their gait is exaggerated and appears hypermetric compared with adults, just as limb reflexes are increased compared with adult horses. \u2022 When recumbent, foals have strong resting extensor tone and a crossed extensor reflex that persists for as long as 1 month of age. \u2022 Practice Tip: Foals normally spend approximately 50% of their time sleeping. When \"sound\" asleep, normal foals can be extremely difficult to arouse; this is especially common in miniature horse foals. Foals in \"deep\" sleep can also exhibit rapid eye movement, limb twitching, irregular breathing \u2022 Therefore, broad-spectrum antimicrobials, such as betalactam drugs (ampicillin, penicillin, ceftiofur, cefazolin, combined with amikacin), should be instituted before culture results are known if renal function is normal; serum creatinine should be serially monitored in foals on amikacin.\n\n\u2022 Ampicillin may have some advantage over the other previously mentioned beta-lactams because of better efficacy against many isolates of the genus Enterococcus. \u2022 Penicillin and ampicillin have increased activity over anaerobes as compared with the cephalosporins. \u2022 If renal function is abnormal, or the foal is experiencing hypoperfusion, ceftiofur or another third-generation cephalosporin is used. Adjustments in the dosing interval may be required for cephalosporins used in azotemic foals. \u2022 If anaerobes are suspected based on odor or the presence of significant gas shadows on ultrasonography, metronidazole is indicated. \u2022 Treatment of umbilical infections consists of long-term use of systemic antimicrobials. Duration of antimicrobial therapy is dictated by resolution of clinical signs (fever, umbilical size, resolution of discharge if present) ultrasonographic findings, hematologic results, resolution of leukocytosis, and change in acute phase reactants such as fibrinogen (if it was increased). \u2022 If the foal's clinical status deteriorates during medical management, or the ultrasonographic appearance of infected structures worsens or fails to improve with time, surgical resection is indicated. \u2022 Surgical intervention is rarely needed with early and targeted antimicrobial therapy.\n\n\u2022 The exception is the walled-off abscesses that may be difficult to treat with antimicrobials alone. \u2022 Even if surgery is planned, 24 to 48 hours of antimicrobial treatment during the preoperative period aids in surgical resection by \"reducing\" the inflammation and periumbilical swelling.\n\n\u2022 A pupillary light response should be present, though is more sluggish in foals than in adult horses. \u2022 A consistent menace response often is not present until 2 to 3 weeks of age. \u2022 Newborn foals have decreased corneal sensation and may not appear painful with corneal ulceration. \u2022 Some foals have decreased tear production and red conjunctiva associated with the \"dry eyes\"-keratoconjuctivitis sicca (KCS are indicated. Pharmacology of antimicrobials should be considered, especially regarding blood-brain barrier penetrability. Third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, or ceftriaxone) are advantageous in terms of spectrum of activity and central nervous system (CNS)\n\n\u2022 Practice Tip: Hyponatremia should be corrected slowly to avoid central pontine myelinolysis. \u2022 In human patients, it is recommended that the plasma sodium concentration not be increased by more than 0.5 mEq/h, or 10 mEq/day. \u2022 However, an exception is when hyponatremic seizures are present.\n\n\u2022 In these cases, the plasma sodium concentration should be increased by 2 to 5 mEq/L rapidly, to abolish the seizures. \u2022 Once the seizures abate, a slow correction (0.5 mEq/L) regimen is instituted. \u2022 To raise the plasma sodium a few mEq/L quickly, commercial replacement fluids are administered. Plasma-Lyte\n\n\u2022 Physiological to hypertonic saline can also be used if these balanced commercial fluids do not increase the sodium concentrations fast enough to stop seizures. \u2022 Once seizures stop, the rate of sodium correction should be slowed to 0.5 mEq/L per hour once plasma sodium is 116 to 120 mEq/L or greater. \u2022 Practice Tip: The more chronic the hyponatremia, the more important it is to slowly raise the serum sodium. \u2022 Sodium concentration in other cases of hyponatremia (longer duration or no seizure activity present) should only be increased at a rate of 0.5 mEq/L per hour.\n\n\u2022 Immediately control seizures by administering benzodiazepines.\n\n\u2022 Diazepam: 0.04 to 0.2 mg/kg IV, up to 0.4 mg/kg if needed IV or \u2022 Midazolam: 0.04 to 0.1 mg/kg IV, up to 0.2 mg/kg IV \u2022 An exception to the recommendation for benzodiazepine use is in foals with hepatic encephalopathy, where endogenous benzodiazepines are believed to contribute to encephalopathy.\n\n\u2022 Examine the musculoskeletal system, including mandible, limbs, and ribs, for fractures resulting from birth trauma. \u2022 Fractured ribs often are difficult to detect but frequently produce a clicking sound on auscultation, heard in synchrony with respiration.\n\n\u2022 Displaced fractures or those associated with hematomas or edema can be palpated. \u2022 Nondisplaced or minimally displaced fractures are detected using ultrasound. \u2022 Foals with fractured ribs should be kept quiet. \u2022 Foals with multiple or medially displaced rib fractures may be candidates for surgical repair, particularly if there is any evidence of internal thoracic trauma (hemothorax, pneumothorax) or if the rib fractures are located directly over the heart. \u2022 Foals normally have an initial and transient, mild carpal and fetlock valgus conformation in the thoracic limbs.\n\n\u2022 Physiologic homeostasis is the goal using vital signs and blood pressure as one indicator of clinical trends. \u2022 Control seizures (see What to Do box). \u2022 Begin early treatment with intranasal oxygen. Hypoxemia should be prevented and treated; severe hyperoxemia is best avoided in order to minimize potential oxidant damage. Note: Oxygen insufflation rates should be dictated by arterial blood gases. \u2022 Other treatments include:\n\n\u2022 Balanced, polyionic crystalloids: Normosol R, Plasma-Lyte A, or lactated Ringer's solution (LRS) \u2022 Colloids: plasma \u2022 Dextrose in water, 5% to 15% to provide 4 mg/kg per minute of dextrose \u2022 Positive inopressor (inotropic) drugs: \u25cb Dobutamine: 2 to 10 \u00b5g/kg per minute (if fluids fail to normalize blood pressure and perfusion) \u25cb Norepinephrine: 0.01 to 3.0 \u00b5g/kg per minute (if dobutamine fails to normalize blood pressure and perfusion) to normalize arterial pressure with hypoxia or head trauma \u2022 Magnesium may have some benefit in reducing secondary or reperfusion injury, although its administration in supraphysiological doses (20 to 50 mg/kg infused over one hour followed by 10 to 25 mg/kg/hr as a continuous rate infusion/CRI) is controversial. \u2022 Vitamin C (see Equine Emergency Drugs; Appendix 9, p. 859) and thiamine (10 mg/kg slowly IV) may provide some antioxidant and positive energy metabolism effects, respectively. \u2022 Respiratory stimulants-Caffeine (10 mg/kg PO) or doxapram (0.5 mg/kg IV then 0.04 mg/kg/min for 20 minutes) for encephalopathic foals with hypoventilation and respiratory acidosis. Doxapram may increase heart and brain oxygen demand. These treatments are used when there is hypoventilation and severe respiratory acidosis, and mechanical ventilation is not practical. \u2022 High blood ammonia, secondary to constipation, can exacerbate neurologic signs; enemas and laxatives are indicated.\n\nSee previous discussion and pp. 529-530.\n\n\u2022 Administer 10% calcium borogluconate, 1 to 2 mL/kg (Ca 2+ , 9 to 18 mg/kg), slowly IV over 5 to 10 minutes diluted in crystalloids. Alternatively, administer 0.5 mL/kg of 23% calcium slowly and diluted in crystalloid fluids. \u2022 Slow or stop infusion if bradycardia develops. \u2022 Follow with a maintenance infusion of calcium: 10% calcium borogluconate, 2.3 to 5 mL/kg/day, or 23% calcium borogluconate, 1 to 2 mL/kg/day, diluted and administered slowly. Hyponatremia \u2022 Cortical (central) blindness is a common finding with severe hyponatremia ([Na + ] \u2264 105 to 110 mEq/L). \u2022 The seizures associated with hyponatremia are often focal in nature and facial only in clinical presentation. Jaw drop, or inability to raise the mandible or close the jaw, is very common. \u2022 In more severe cases, the seizures may be generalized and blindness occurs.\n\n\u2022 Mild cases of contracture often respond to stall confinement and support wraps. \u2022 Additional treatments for contracted tendons include physical therapy, systemic analgesics, Robert Jones wraps, and controlled (limited) exercise to prevent worsening of contracture and extensor tendon rupture. \u2022 Moderate to severe cases include the use of toe extensions (for distal limb contracture) and splints along with the bandages. \u2022 Severely affected cases may benefit from the administration of supra-antimicrobial doses of oxytetracycline (1 to 3 g, or 20 to 60 mg/kg IV q24 to 36h for a maximum of 3 doses) in addition to the previously mentioned treatments. Practice Tip: Oxytetracycline should be administered as a dilute solution in fluids. Measuring serum creatinine concentration before and after each treatment is ideal and should be done if repeated doses are needed. \u2022 Caution: Acute anuric-to-oliguric renal failure is occasionally reported to occur after treatment with this higher dose oxytetracycline. Concurrent intravenous administration of fluids is recommended if there are any concerns about concurrent dehydration. \u2022 Casting and splinting are associated with exacerbation of lateral laxity, may promote the development of rubs and pressure sores, and should be used with great attention to monitoring skin and limb integrity. \u2022 Rupture of the common digital extensor tendon (CDET) may occur with significant carpal contracture and has been reported associated with hypothyroidism, forelimb contracture, and mandibular prognathism.\n\n\u2022 Serum thyroid hormone concentrations should be measured in affected foals. \u2022 Treatment for rupture of the CDET consists of stall confinement and the use of support wraps. A firm fetlock bandage extends the digit and assists the foal in foot placement. \u2022 Splints may be needed for foals that are unable to advance or extend the limb or that frequently knuckle over at the fetlock. \u2022 The ruptured tendon ends heal, presumably with fibrosis, and the foals generally have an excellent prognosis for soundness. Early and aggressive treatment is recommended to minimize the possible sequelae of fetlock subluxation. \u2022 Rupture of the gastrocnemius muscle may occur in neonatal foals causing inability to stand and swelling (hematoma) at the proximal insertion of the tendon at the caudal thigh. Some of the foals have a history of a dystocia delivery.\n\n\u2022 There is disruption of the reciprocal mechanism on flexing the stifle and hock. \u2022 For mild gastrocnemius injury, exercise restriction by forced recumbency, with minimal or no bandaging, may be sufficient treatment. \u2022 For more severe disruption of the muscle, limb stabilization by splinting and intensive nursing and monitoring are needed. \u2022 As the hematoma resolves and healing of the tendon insertion begins, some physical therapy is recommended for a normal range of motion after healing.\n\n\u2022 Lameness is usually present, although septic arthritis/ physitis can be difficult to identify in weak or recumbent foals. Careful, frequent palpation and visual assessment of Examine limbs for more severe angular and flexural deformities that may require surgical intervention. \u2022 Palpate joints and physes for signs of swelling, edema, and heat (see Chapter 21, p. 301). \u2022 Lameness should be thoroughly evaluated in the neonatal foal because septic arthritis, physitis, or osteomyelitis may be the etiology.\n\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal signs:\n\n\u2022 Increased passive range of joint motion \u2022 Periarticular ligament and flexor tendon laxity \u2022 Incomplete cuboidal bone ossification (see Chapter 21, p. 309; detectable only on radiographs) of carpus and tarsus. The navicular bone and epiphyses of long bones should also be evaluated in very premature foals. \u2022 Foals with incomplete ossification of the cuboidal bones, epiphyses, or navicular bones should not be allowed to exercise without some support of their body weight during physical therapy.\n\n\u2022 Severely affected foals are often maintained in a recumbent position in a small foal box, with frequent body position changes, rotating every 2 hours. They are allowed to stand for a few minutes every 1 to 2 hours, initially only with assistance (supported under the sternum and tuber ischii) in order to reduce the compressive forces on their limbs and to prevent crushing of the ossifying bones. \u2022 Tube casts and splinting are generally not recommended for these cases because they contribute to laxity of the supporting structures and may be associated with increased morbidity from cast sores; if used, change them frequently. \u2022 Casts can be made to end just above the fetlock to minimize development of the ligament and tendon laxity. \u2022 Angular limb deformities should be corrected early in affected foals to avoid abnormal compression of the immature cartilaginous bones. Standing on slippery floors is to be avoided! \u2022 There may be painful swelling/edema over the physis, epiphysis proximal to the joint, or at site of bone infection with or without secondary sympathetic joint effusion. If joint effusion cannot be readily palpated, consider less commonly affected joints (distal interphalangeal or scapulohumeral). \u2022 Radiographic evidence of periosteal osteolytic and proliferative changes is often present. \u2022 Leukocytosis and hyperfibrinogenemia (often >800 mg/ dL) usually accompany the clinical condition.\n\n\u2022 Treat with long-term antimicrobial therapy; aspirate physis for culture and sensitivity if septic physitis is present. Antimicrobials can be injected directly into the septic physis. \u2022 Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs conservatively to provide analgesia and decrease inflammation. Ketoprofen (1 to 2 mg/kg IV q24h) and flunixin meglumine may be associated with reduced risk of adverse effects, including gastrointestinal and renal toxicity, as compared with phenylbutazone. Carprofen (0.7 to 1.4 mg/kg IV or PO q24h) is another option, but it requires study in foals. Recently, firocoxib has been studied in the neonatal foal and is an alternative, particularly in those foals with renal compromise. \u2022 Regional limb perfusion, using one third the calculated total dose of aminoglycoside, is indicated in many cases. The total daily dose of amikacin should not exceed 25 mg/kg, and is optimally guided by therapeutic drug monitoring. The balance of the dose is administered at the time of tourniquet release. Renal function (creatinine and BUN) is monitored closely in foals receiving amikacin. \u2022 Some severe cases of osteomyelitis may benefit from surgical debridement of affected bone. Support of the unaffected limbs with support wraps is recommended to prevent limb deformities when a severe lameness is present in another limb. \u2022 The need for long-term analgesia with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should prompt prophylaxis for gastric and duodenal ulcer disease in the care of these patients (see Chapter 18, p. 181). \u2022 A recent study (Neil KM et al, 2010) reported the prognosis for survival of foals with septic osteomyelitis to be favorable (80.6% discharge from hospital). In addition, 65.8% of those discharged (48% of those treated) ultimately raced. Multiple septic joints, but not multiple bone involvement, had an unfavorable prognosis for racing; however, both led to a decreased discharge from the hospital.\n\n\u2022 A healthy foal consumes upward of 15% to 25% of its body weight in milk daily with an average daily weight gain of 1 to 3 lb (0.45 to 1.35 kg). \u2022 Foals nurse, on average, seven times per hour during the first week of life. As they age, the nursing frequency decreases. At 24 weeks of age, the nursing frequency is once per hour. \u2022 Practice Tip: Udder distention and milk streaming in the mare are some of the earliest signs of a \"fading foal\" that is no longer nursing effectively.\n\nall joints and growth plate regions are warranted in such foals. \u2022 Practice Tip: If a neonatal foal becomes acutely lame, septic arthritis should be the top differential diagnosis unless another cause is positively identified; too often an overly optimistic diagnosis of \"the foal might have been stepped on by the mare\" is made, and early and important treatment of septic arthritis is delayed. \u2022 Fever is variable. \u2022 Painful, warm joint effusion is frequently accompanied by significant leukocytosis and hyperfibrinogenemia. Osteomyelitis commonly is associated with marked hyperfibrinogenemia (>800 mg/dL). \u2022 Radiographs of affected joints are indicated to evaluate for concurrent septic physitis or osteomyelitis. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging can aid in diagnosis of bone infections when equivocal results are obtained radiographically. \u2022 Arthrocentesis reveals a neutrophilic pleocytosis and increased total protein concentration.\n\n\u2022 Neonatal foals with septic arthritis may not develop as great an elevation in white blood cell count as adult horses. Synovial fluid leukocyte counts of \u226510,000 cells/\u00b5L are indicative of sepsis in the foal. \u2022 Synovial fluid lactate, glucose con centrations, and pH are helpful adjuncts in evaluating for sepsis; lactate increases, whereas glucose and pH decrease relative to serum/plasma concentrations of these analytes.\n\n\u2022 Treatment of septic arthritis is with systemic antimicrobial therapy and joint lavage using balanced electrolyte solutions with 10 g DMSO added per 1 L.\n\n\u2022 Small volumes of an antimicrobial (amikacin, 250 mg per joint) can be instilled in the joint after lavage, but the total dose should be monitored. \u2022 Arthroscopic examination and lavage is indicated in joints where fibrin deposition or osteomyelitis is suspected. \u2022 Note: Regional limb perfusion, using one third the calculated total systemic dose of aminoglycoside, is indicated in some cases (see Chapter 5, p. 16). \u2022 Practice Tip: The total daily dose of amikacin should not exceed 25 mg/kg for either intraarticular injection or regional limb perfusion. The balance of the dose can be administered simultaneously with the release of the tourniquet after regional limb perfusion has been completed. \u2022 Ideally, amikacin therapy is guided by therapeutic drug (i.e., peak and trough concentrations) and renal function monitoring (i.e., serial creatinine and BUN) in affected foals. \u2022 Some severe osteomyelitis cases may benefit from debridement of affected bone or other more invasive procedures. \u2022 Intraosseous and intraphyseal perfusion, especially if there is a septic physis, is an alternative route when intravenous perfusion is not possible. \u2022 Continuous intrasynovial antimicrobial infusion has been studied recently for use in equine septic joints and appears to be an effective adjunct.\n\n\u2022 It is optimal to divide the daily requirement into small feedings every 2 hours or more frequently. Please see section on nutritional support and parenteral nutrition for more information (see Chapter 51, p. 548).\n\n\u2022 The jugular vein is the most common site for venipuncture in an awake, active foal. \u2022 In more depressed foals, the saphenous and cephalic veins are used. \u2022 Sites for arterial blood gas sampling include the dorsal metatarsal (first choice); brachial; transverse facial; facial; and less frequently, the brachial or caudal auricular arteries ( Fig. 31-1 \u2022 Milk dripping from a foal's nose after nursing may be the result of the following: \u2022 Cleft palate: Although it has to be ruled out, cleft palate is one of the least common causes of dysphagia among foals. Upper airway endoscopy is an excellent diagnostic method to rule out a cleft palate. \u2022 Subepiglottic cyst \u2022 Persistent or restricted epiglottic frenulum \u2022 Dorsal displacement of the soft palate \u2022 Generalized weakness caused by sepsis/SIRS/FIRS or dysmaturity is common \u2022 Dysphagia associated with perinatal asphyxial syndrome is common \u2022 White muscle disease is common in certain geographic regions \u2022 Esophageal pooling of milk (megaesophagus or branchial arch defect) \u2022 Transient pharyngeal paresis (idiopathic) may resolve in a few to several days or persist, requiring the foal to be bucket fed. This condition is common in some regions and breeds. \u2022 Congenital fourth branchial arch defects may cause milk to reflux from the esophagus. Diagnosis is made by endoscopy and observing the pharyngeal arch \"hanging\" over the right dorsal arytenoid. A physical defect in the area just dorsal to the right larynx is palpable externally.\n\n\u2022 The caloric requirements of the healthy, active foal are approximately 120 to 150 kcal/kg per day. \u2022 Practice Tip: Sick neonates, such as foals with sepsis or peripartum asphyxia injury, often have reduced caloric needs because of inactivity and recumbency. \u2022 Feeding excessive calories is potentially harmful in septic human patients because these calories can be used to drive the inflammatory response. Note: Preliminary investigations using indirect calorimetry suggest that sick and nonexercising (orphan) foals have reduced resting energy requirements, as low as 40 to 55 kcal/kg per day. \u2022 Practice Tip: Mare's milk is the optimal food source for foals.\n\nMare's milk has approximately 500 kcal/L of milk. To provide 50 kcal/kg per day to a critically ill foal, a total of 2500 kcal is needed for a 50-kg foal, equaling 5 L of milk. This is equivalent to 10% of body weight in milk. If the foal does not gain weight on this volume of milk and the GI tract is normal, a larger volume of milk is fed. \u2022 Alternatives for orphan foals include:\n\n\u2022 Commercial milk replacers \u2022 Goat's milk \u2022 Goat's milk alone may predispose the foal to constipation and metabolic acidosis. A 1 : 1 mixture of foal milk replacer and goat's milk is preferred. \u2022 Foals should be fed small amounts frequently because milk serves as a buffer for gastric pH, and increased frequency of small volume feedings are particularly necessary in foals with subnormal GI motility.\n\n\u2022 FIRS was described in human perinatology and is applicable to foals, characterized by a condition of systemic inflammation in the fetus and an increase in fetal plasma inflammatory cytokines. \u2022 In humans, FIRS is characterized specifically by an increase in fetal plasma interleukin-6. It has been observed in fetuses with:\n\n\u2022 Preterm labor and intact placental membranes \u2022 Premature rupture of fetal membranes \u2022 Fetal viral infections such as cytomegalovirus in humans \u2022 In horses, FIRS likely is present in foal fetuses with:\n\n\u2022 Premature placental separation \u2022 Placentitis, EHV-1, or equine viral arteritis infection \u2022 Prematurity \u2022 In human pediatrics, FIRS is a risk factor for short-term mortality and long-term sequelae such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and even brain injury. Short-term morbidity of FIRS in human infants, which can also contribute to mortality, includes:\n\n\u2022 Pneumonia \u2022 Intraventricular hemorrhage \u2022 Necrotizing enterocolitis \u2022 Respiratory distress \u2022 Neonatal sepsis \u2022 Foals may be born septic or weak and demonstrate signs of maladjustment or unreadiness for birth. If placental disease is recognized early and believed associated with bacterial sepsis, early treatment of the mare with antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is indicated along with anti-inflammatory therapy for placentitis (flunixin meglumine, pentoxifylline, vitamin E, and altrenogest).\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 Obtain thoracic radiographs with the foal in lateral recumbency or standing. Take thoracic radiographs with the foal standing when possible to reduce effects of recumbencyinduced atelectasis. Radiographs of the thorax with the forelegs pulled forward improves evaluation of the cranioventral lung fields. \u2022 It is optimal to image both sides of the thorax.\n\n\u2022 Bacterial bronchopneumonia is commonly associated with an alveolar pattern and air bronchograms in the cranioventral and caudoventral lung fields (Fig. 31-2) . Pulmonary consolidation with loss of air bronchograms may be present with severe disease. Acute bacterial pneumonia can also present as diffuse interstitial disease. \u2022 Both alveolar and interstitial patterns can be seen in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. \u2022 Viral pneumonia is characterized by a diffuse interstitial pattern ( Fig. 31-3 ). \u2022 Aspiration pneumonia, including meconium aspiration, is associated with caudoventral and cranioventral infiltrates. \u2022 Surfactant deficiency and hyaline membrane formation produce a diffuse, ground-glass appearance of the lung with prominent air bronchograms. This radiographic appearance also has been seen in foals with respiratory distress associated with viral pneumonia (Fig. 31-4) . The ground-glass appearance can be mimicked in lateral thoracic radiographs of foals with pulmonary hemorrhage or hemothorax. \u2022 Serial radiographs of swollen, painful joints or physes are recommended to detect signs of articular damage and osteomyelitis. These radiographs should be repeated in 2 to 5 days if swelling or pain persists. \n\n\u2022 The syndrome produces a wide range of clinical signs.\n\n\u2022 Asphyxia induces a critical redistribution of cardiac output. \u2022 The result is preferential blood flow to the heart, brain, and adrenal glands and decreased perfusion of the lungs, GI tract, spleen, liver, kidneys, skin, and muscles. \u2022 Diagnosis is based primarily on clinical signs.\n\n\u2022 Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (neonatal encephalopathy): loss of suckle, loss of dam recognition, apnea, irregular respiratory patterns (inappropriate tachypnea, ataxic or cluster breathing), hypotonia, anisocoria, sluggish pupillary light reflex, dilated pupils, depression, tonic posturing (preference for lying in extensor posture with occasional pedaling limb movements), hyperesthesia, focal or grand mal seizures, and coma \u2022 Renal tubular necrosis (neonatal nephropathy): oliguria, anuria, and generalized edema with fluid or sodium overload associated with the oliguria or anuria \u2022 Plain abdominal radiographs can identify the location of gas distention. Ileus associated with enteritis or peritonitis is associated with generalized mild to moderate distention of the small and large intestines. Radiographs can demonstrate meconium in foals with impactions or retention.\n\n\u2022 Shock is a pathophysiologic state of inadequate energy production for cellular function. \u2022 Categories of shock include the following:\n\n\u2022 Cardiogenic: Examples include myocardial failure and white muscle disease (selenium deficiency). \n\n\u2022 Between 60% and 80% of foals suffering from peripartum asphyxia recover fully and mature into neurologically normal adults. \u2022 A poor outcome is associated with severe, recurrent seizures that persist for >5 days postpartum, severe hypotonia that progresses to coma, and severe multiorgan system damage that includes unresponsive renal failure or hypotension. These foals should be monitored closely for development of concurrent septicemia. \u2022 Dysmature and premature foals exposed to severe acute peripartum asphyxia have a poorer outcome than do term foals.\n\n\u2022 Prematurity is defined as the condition of a foal born before a gestational period of <320 days, although foals born with longer gestational ages can be considered premature if born to dams with historically longer gestational periods. \u2022 Dysmaturity is defined as the condition of a foal born after a normal or prolonged gestation period in which there are signs of underdevelopment. Dysmaturity is associated with abnormal uteroplacental function, which can result in delayed fetal growth and maturation when chronic, and in varying degrees of fetal asphyxia when acute. \u2022 Postmaturity is the term some clinicians apply to the foal born after a prolonged gestation with signs of dysmaturity, yet they have large frame size, poor body condition, and long hair coats.\n\nIn addition to generalized weakness and hypotonia, the following signs are characteristic of dysmaturity and prematurity: \u2022 Avoid acepromazine because it may lower seizure threshold and produce significant hypotension. \u2022 The use of osmotic agents for HIE is controversial. Osmotics are beneficial for interstitial edema; however, whether interstitial or intracellular edema is present in most cases of HIE requires further study. If the foal is hydrated, a mannitol trial is attempted and evaluated for a response in terms of mentation, since intracranial pressure is not routinely measured. Mannitol can be administered at 0.25 to 1.0 g/kg IV as 20% solution over 10 to 20 minutes as an osmotic diuretic. The duration of action of mannitol may be 5 hours or less; therefore, repeated dosing (3 to 4 times) may be required. If improvement is not seen in the first 24 hours, treatment is often suspended.\n\n\u2022 Mannitol may theoretically exacerbate active, ongoing cerebral hemorrhage. Questions remain as to the location of any edema that develops in neonatal encephalopathy. If edema has a role in the pathophysiology of this syndrome, most current evidence, in other species, suggests that it is intracellular (cytotoxic, not interstitial or vasogenic); therefore, the use of osmotic diuretics may be unwarranted in many cases. Some clinicians never use DMSO or mannitol in the management of cerebral edema and report no change in outcome. Others suggest that the antioxidant properties, with or without anti-edema properties, of mannitol are of clinical benefit. \u2022 Some clinicians continue to use DMSO at 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg given as no more than a 10% solution IV over 30 to 50 minutes. \n\n\u2022 Caution: Furosemide is incompatible with many medications. If administering furosemide through the same intravenous line as dopamine, avoid prolonged mixing of solutions in the line by administering dopamine or furosemide solution as close to the catheter port as possible. \u2022 Protect furosemide CRI solutions from light by wrapping the line in paper or foil. \u2022 Although furosemide administration can result in diuresis, prolonged use is associated with electrolyte and acid-base disturbances. \u2022 The use of dopamine or furosemide in the management of oliguric renal failure does not correct the underlying problem. Judicious use of intravenous fluids, and \"protecting\" from dehydration, is indicated in these cases where oliguria or anuria is present. \u2022 Close attention to matching \"ins and outs\" is important.\n\n\u2022 Perform nasogastric decompression to check for reflux. Discontinue feeding if significant reflux is present. Reduce the volume or frequency of enteral feeding if there is a low volume of residual feed present on subsequent nasogastric intubation. \u2022 If abdominal distention is severe and life-threatening and causing significant respiratory compromise, and abdominal exploration is not an option or is delayed, then percutaneous large-bowel trocarization can be performed (see Chapter 18, p. 160). Use a 16-gauge, 3 1 2 -inch (8.75-cm) catheter-over-stylet attached to a 30-inch (75-cm) extension set. Sedate the foal if needed to keep it quiet in lateral recumbency. Clip and surgically prepare a site over the right paralumbar fossae at the point of maximal bowel distention. Infuse a small bleb of lidocaine at the puncture site. Using sterile technique, advance the catheter and stylet through the skin and body wall into distended viscus. Remove the stylet and connect the extension set. Place the free end of the extension set into a small beaker of sterile water to monitor gas-bubble production. Once bubbling stops, a small volume of antimicrobial (e.g., amikacin diluted 50 : 50 with sterile water) can be infused as the catheter is withdrawn. Broad-spectrum systemic antimicrobial therapy is recommended for 3 to 5 days after trocarization. Important: There is a risk of septic peritonitis, and the procedure should only be performed if distention is severe and life-threatening. \u2022 Prokinetic drugs: In general, the cause of ileus should be addressed rather than resorting to prokinetic drugs. Hypoperfusion, hypoxemia, hypoglycemia, and meconium retention should be addressed as possible contributors to ileus. Ileus due to gut injury associated with hypoxic-ischemic damage or sepsis/SIRS needs time to heal, and parenteral nutrition may be indicated. When prolonged ileus is noted, but no mechanical obstruction is present, prokinetic drugs may be indicated. These drugs are not recommended for routine use because they can cause additional GI problems, such as possibly predisposing to intussusception, worsening colic, or neurologic complications. They may be indicated in foals with postoperative ileus.\n\n\u2022 Metoclopramide, 0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg/h as a CRI; can also be used as 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg as slow IV infusion or per rectum q6h; observe for extrapyramidal adverse effects (CNS excitation, motor restlessness, muscle spasms). Metoclopramide stimulates\n\n\u2022 Hypovolemia should be corrected as soon as possible.\n\n\u2022 Lack of urine production should be considered an emergency. It could be due to prerenal or renal oliguria or anuria, or a lack of urine voiding may be due to an inability to micturate. Prerenal oliguria should be rapidly addressed in order to prevent progression to renal disease. Inability to micturate associated with an enlarged, hypotonic bladder can lead to a ruptured bladder if not addressed. \u2022 Monitor fluid balance (fluid input and urine output) to evaluate renal function. This ensures adequate hydration while avoiding overhydration. \u2022 If hypotension occurs despite IV fluid administration: Dobutamine (2 to 15 \u00b5g/kg/min) can be administered as an inotropic agent. Use dobutamine if cardiac dysfunction and secondary hypotension are contributing to poor renal perfusion; discontinue or reduce dosage if tachycardia develops. Norepinephrine (range: 0.01 to 3.0 \u00b5g/kg/ min) causes an increase in systemic vascular resistance and therefore elevates arterial blood pressure. Using 0.3 \u00b5g/kg/min (with or without fenoldopam) increases urine output and creatinine clearance; this regimen may be useful in treating hypotension with concurrent oliguria (Hollis et al, 2008) . \u2022 If correction of hypovolemia and hypotension does not result in correction of anuria, then anuric renal failure is a concern, particularly if concurrent azotemia is present and creatinine is increasing over time. If nonresponsive anuria or marked oliguria is present, despite adequate hydration, blood pressure, and fluid balance, and dialysis is not an option, then medical therapy geared to increasing urine output can be tried.\n\n\u2022 Furosemide: Administer small boluses (0.12 to 0.5 mg/kg IV q30 to 60min, up to 1 to 2 mg/kg total dose) to enhance diuresis, or begin or follow with continuous infusion (0.12 mg/kg per hour after a loading dose of 0.12 mg/kg). Monitor for development of hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and additional electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia. \u2022 Mannitol: Administer 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg IV as 20% solution over 15 to 30 minutes or 75 to 100 mg/kg/h CRI (osmotic diuretic). Do not repeat the bolus if anuria persists. \u2022 Dopamine infusion: Administer 2 to 3 \u00b5g/kg/min if anuria or oliguria is present. \u25cb Lower doses stimulate dopaminergic receptors and enhance urine output by natriuresis. \u25cb Medium doses recruit beta-receptors and support cardiac function, which may further improve renal perfusion. \u25cb High doses stimulate alpha-receptors and result in decreased splanchnic blood flow, renal blood flow, and urine production. \u25cb Titrate the dose to the individual patient. In one report, a dose of 0.04 \u00b5g/kg/min fenoldopam, a dopamine-1 receptor agonist, increased urine output in foals; however, creatinine clearance did not change (Hollis et al, 2006) . \u25cb Recommend bladder catheterization to allow accurate assessment of urine production. \u25cb Note: The use of dopamine in renal failure is controversial as to benefit in human patients and is no longer commonly recommended. However, in cases of oliguria or anuria in foals, it may be worth trying because hemodialysis (or possibly peritoneal dialysis) is the only alternative when medical therapy fails.\n\nasphyxia accompanied by hypothermia, hypotension, shock, or advanced prematurity, recommend delaying all enteral feeds and providing PN until GI function returns (as evidenced by passage of meconium, borborygmi present). \u2022 Foals with colic: Withhold feeding or nursing until the signs of colic or distention resolve. \u2022 Glucose supplementation: 4 mg/kg/min is used for the first 24 hours in foals with an adequate body condition score; however, after 24 hours of withholding enteral feeding, PN is instituted. gastroduodenal motility and thus may be useful in the management of delayed gastric emptying associated with gastroduodenal ulceration in older foals. \u2022 Cisapride, 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg PO q4 to 8h, stimulates small-and large-intestinal motility. Motility is not necessarily coordinated or progressive, and signs of colic may worsen. Cisapride is currently not available as an FDA approved drug in the United States because of concerns of dysrhythmias in human patients. \u2022 Lidocaine: The adult horse dose is 1 to 1.3 mg/kg slowly (over 15 minutes) IV, followed by 0.05 mg/kg per minute. The pharmacokinetics of this drug have not been studied in neonates; neonates are more susceptible than older horses to toxicity and may require a lower dose because of possible reduced liver metabolism and also a lower plasma protein concentration (lidocaine is highly protein bound), thereby increasing free drug concentrations. Discontinue if the following signs of toxicity develop: \u25cb Collapse \u25cb Muscle fasciculations \u25cb Ataxia \u25cb Excitation \u2022 Important: Use lidocaine with caution. It may have several advantages with respect to analgesic and anti-endotoxic effects, but it also has anti-inflammatory effects that have unknown influences on natural protection against infection. \u2022 Neostigmine, 0.005 to 0.01 mg/kg SQ q4h has been used successfully to evacuate \"gas\" (distended large intestine) but not a displacement or obstruction. Neostigmine reduces gastric emptying and jejunal motility in healthy adult horses; therefore, its use in foals with reduced gastric emptying is not recommended. \u2022 Bethanechol, 0.03 to 0.04 mg/kg SQ or IV q6 to 8h: This drug increases gastric emptying and stimulates small-intestinal and pelvic flexure smooth muscle contraction. It may therefore improve gastric emptying in foals with duodenal and pyloric ulcers. \u2022 Gastroprotectants (see Gastric Ulcers, Chapter 18, p. 181): Foals with hypoxic or ischemic GI damage are at increased risk of GI ulcers because of poor GI perfusion and the primary disease process. Acid production is not necessarily the cause of the ulcers, and the gastric milieu is likely more alkaline in sick foals from duodenal reflux than it is in normal foals. Therefore, H 2 -antagonists and proton pump inhibitors may not be needed. In addition, the neonatal foal has a blunted response to H 2 -antagonists. A recent retrospective (Furr M et al, 2012 ) study suggested that the use of antacid medications in foals predisposed foals to diarrhea. Antiulcer medications used in foals are: \u2022 Ranitidine, 6.6 mg/kg PO q8h or 1.5 to 2 mg/kg slow IV q8 to 12h; ranitidine also has some motility-enhancing effects \u2022 Famotidine, 2.8 mg/kg PO q12h or 0.3 mg/kg IV q12h \u2022 Sucralfate, 20 mg/kg PO q6h \u2022 Omeprazole, 4 mg/kg PO q24h \u2022 Pantoprazole, 1.5 mg/kg slow, dilute IV q24h \u2022 Antacids, such as Maalox or Di-Gel: 30 to 60 mL q3 to 4h. Most antacids have a short half-life, produce minimal change in gastric pH, but may provide transient pain relief. \u2022 Administer broad-spectrum, bactericidal antimicrobials to reduce the risk of sepsis from translocation of luminal bacteria across a compromised GI mucosa. Sucralfate may also decrease bacterial translocation. \u2022 PN: With mild GI compromise, reduce the volume or frequency of enteral feeding and support the foal with PN. In cases of severe\n\n\u2022 Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP): This is a spontaneous breathing mode in which there is maintenance of positive airway pressures during inspiration, exhalation, and in between breaths. This mode results in increased functional residual capacity and improves ventilation-perfusion ratios. CPAP can be combined with pressure support ventilation.\n\n\u2022 Typical settings: Begin PPV with initial tidal volume of 6 to 10 mL/ kg and PEEP of 4 to 6 cm H 2 O. Low tidal volumes (6 mL/kg) are associated with protective lung strategies in human critical care. \u2022 A starting point for breath rate is 20 to 30 breaths/min, which should be adjusted using capnography and arterial blood gas analysis. The inspiratory/expiratory ratio should be set at 1 : 2. \u2022 Providing pressure support (PS) without mandatory machine breaths may be sufficient for many foals. PS should start at 8 to 12 cm H 2 O. In this mode, foals generate each breath and determine the depth, volume, and duration of the breath but are assisted by machine-generated pressure throughout each inspiration. CPAP is a weaning mode and may be useful for foals with milder respiratory compromise. \u2022 Use a FiO 2 of 60% to 100% initially and reevaluate arterial blood gas values within 30 minutes of initiating PPV. Adjust inspired oxygen concentration accordingly with the goal of rapidly reducing FiO 2 to <50% to 60% to minimize the risk of oxygen toxicity. \u2022 Attempt to maintain peak airway pressures below 30 to 40 cm H 2 O to reduce barotrauma. \u2022 Breath rate is determined by PaCO 2 and the foal's initial breathing rate; some increase in PaCO 2 is permissible and may be necessary to prevent barotrauma. Some foals respond best to pressure support ventilation only, with no mandatory machine-driven breaths. Foals tolerate SIMV/PS modes well.\n\n\u2022 If meconium aspiration has occurred, attempt to treat the foal with IN oxygen alone. PPV can predispose to alveolar rupture and pneumothorax in these cases. Suctioning of the airways is attempted, but do not perform prolonged suction without oxygen administration. \u2022 Intratracheal surfactant instillation may be beneficial if surfactant dysfunction is suspected because of severe asphyxia, pulmonary hypoperfusion, sepsis, or meconium aspiration.\n\n\u2022 Commercial products are expensive; surfactant can be collected from healthy donors (cows or horses) after bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) using the top \"frothy/foamy\" layer. \u2022 Apnea and irregular respiration may be caused by hypoxic-ischemic damage to the central respiratory center, maladaptation to extrauterine life, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, or hypothermia. Check body temperature and correct hypothermia if present. Correct hypoglycemia and/or hypocalcemia. If central respiratory depression is suspected, consider respiratory stimulants:\n\n\u2022 Doxapram CRI, 0.01 to 0.05 mg/kg/min; begin at the low end of the dose range and titrate. Doxapram may increase myocardial oxygen consumption; therefore, this agent should be used in the hemodynamically stable foal. Monitor the foal for hyperarousal or excitability, and reduce the dose if these occur. \u2022 Caffeine: Caffeine is not as effective as doxapram at improving hypoventilation in foals in two published studies. If used, begin with a loading dose of 10 mg/kg PO initially and then a\n\n\u2022 For mild hypoxemia, PaO 2 60 to 70 mm Hg; SaO 2 , 90% to 94%: Increase periods that the foal spends in sternal or standing position; turn every 2 hours if recumbent; stimulate periodic deep breathing to reinflate atelectic lungs; administer humidified IN oxygen, 2 to 10 L/min for average-sized foal -40 to 200 mL/kg/min. \u2022 For moderate to severe hypoxemia, PaO 2 <60 mm Hg, SaO 2 <90%, accompanied by hypercapnia, PaCO 2 , >70 mm Hg: Initially try oxygen insufflation, sternal positioning, and doxapram if hypoventilation is neurogenic in origin (i.e., HIE). If neurogenic in origin and not improved by treatment with a respiratory stimulant (e.g., doxapram or caffeine), or if respiratory acidosis is causing pH <7.25, and is not associated with metabolic alkalosis and therefore not compensatory, provide positive pressure ventilation (PPV). Respiratory muscle fatigue (in premature foals), severe lung disease, botulism, and muscular diseases should also be treated with PPV. Intubate nasotracheally, using a 7-to 10-mm-diameter, 55-cm long, cuffed, silicone nasotracheal tube. 2 \u2022 If respiratory muscle fatigue is a concern and mechanical ventilation is not an option: \u25cb Aminophylline (5 mg/kg mixed in a small volume of crystalloid fluid) can be administered IV over 30 minutes q12h to help maintain strength of diaphragm muscle contractions. \u25cb Aminoglycoside administration may be switched from IV to IM with the goal of decreasing the neuromuscular blocking effect of the drug.\n\n\u2022 Ventilator modes:\n\n\u2022 Controlled mandatory ventilation: All breaths are machinetriggered, and depth/timing are determined by machine settings. \u2022 Assist/control ventilation: In this mode, the breaths can be patient-triggered, machine delivered or both. The patient may trigger the breath depending on the level of sensitivity, which can be varied. However, whether the breath is patient or ventilator derived, the tidal volume, inspiratory time, and flow rate are machine determined (based on settings) and fixed. \u2022 Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV): This is an assist-control mode in which a minimum number of machinedelivered breaths are guaranteed, while the patient can trigger its own breaths in addition to the set number. The tidal volume, inspiratory time, and flow rate are determined by the patient with spontaneous breaths (i.e., under complete control of the patient), whereas machine-triggered breaths are ventilator controlled. Pressure support ventilation can be combined with SIMV so that patient-triggered breaths are supported. \u2022 Pressure support ventilation: This is a \"supported\" or assisted means of ventilation for spontaneous breaths only. The inspiratory tidal volume and time are augmented by the machine, which decreases the work of breathing, but the control of tidal volume and inspiratory time are under patient control. The patient controls all parts of the breath, including triggering, respiratory rate and tidal volume, except for the pressure limit. The patient initiates each breath, and the ventilator assists by delivering support with a present pressure value. Pressure support may be combined with SIMV mode, in which the spontaneous breaths are supported.\n\n\u2022 Monitor serum/plasma electrolyte concentrations.\n\n\u2022 Practice Tip: Hyponatremia and hypochloremia are the most common disturbances associated with renal and endocrine immaturity or dysfunction. Hyperkalemia and hypokalemia may also be present; hypocalcemia is common. Metabolic (organic and inorganic) and respiratory acidosis are also common in affected foals. \u2022 Guidelines for correction include the following:\n\n\u2022 Hypernatremia \u25cb Correct sodium slowly (0.5 mEq/h) \u25cb Rapid correction can result in brain edema \u2022 Hyponatremia \u25cb Correct sodium slowly (0.5 mEq/h) \u25cb Rapid correction can result in pontine dysmyelinolysis \u2022 Hyperkalemia \u25cb Calcium, dextrose, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, peritoneal dialysis, potassium-binding resins used as enemas \u2022 Hypokalemia \u25cb Supplement fluids with 20 to 40 mEq/L of KCl or KPO 4 , and give supplemental potassium orally if needed \u25cb Do not exceed 0.5 mEq/kg/h of potassium in intravenous fluids. \u2022 Inorganic acidosis \u25cb Inorganic acidosis is caused by hyponatremia or hyperchloremia (strong ion acidosis with normal anion gap) \u25cb Treat with sodium bicarbonate slowly intravenously or orally \u25cb Amount to administer: 0.4 \u00d7 base deficit \u00d7 body mass (kilograms). Give half slowly, and then reassess. Monitor PaCO 2. . \u2022 Organic acidosis \u25cb Organic acidosis is most commonly caused by lactic acidosis (high anion gap) \u25cb Treat with fluid volume, inotropes, and vasopressors Nutrition \u2022 Healthy foals ingest approximately 20% to 25% or more of their body weight in milk each day. \u2022 In sick foals, begin enteral feedings cautiously at a rate of 5% or 10% of body weight in milk divided into 10 to 12 feedings per day. Volumes should be gradually advanced as they are tolerated; gastric residuals should be monitored before each subsequent feeding. \u2022 If the foal cannot tolerate sufficient enteral nutritional support, supply additional calories using partial or complete PN.\n\n\u2022 See Chapter 21, p. 309.\n\n\u2022 Most premature and some dysmature foals have varying degrees of incomplete cuboidal bone ossification. \u2022 Obtain a radiograph of at least one carpus (dorsopalmar view) and tarsus (lateral and dorsoplantar view) to evaluate the degree of ossification. \u2022 If the foal is active but has minimal cuboidal bone ossification, attempt to keep the foal non-weight bearing as much as possible and allow only short periods of controlled standing (\u223c5 min/h), ideally with assistance. Foals should be kept in small foal stalls to discourage activity. When recumbent, they should be turned often (every 2 hours) and passive range of motion/physical therapy is used on all limbs. \u2022 Physical therapy is an important component of managing these foals to prevent limb contracture and laxity. \u2022 In general, sleeve casts should be used judiciously because they exacerbate lateral-medial instability by inducing additional joint laxity.\n\nmaintenance dose of 2.5 to 3 mg/kg PO q24h. Therapeutic range for caffeine is 5 to 20 \u00b5g/L; toxic concentration is >40 mg/L. \u2022 If apnea persists, PPV may be needed. \u2022 If PaO 2 does not have a significant increase with 100% oxygen, on ventilator, or high volume nasal oxygen flow after 3 to 4 hours of treatment, suspect the presence of a shunt or primary cardiac anomaly (a poor prognostic indicator). Rule out persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) by a trial with NO in the inspired gas. The ratio of PaO 2 to inhaled oxygen % should be 5 : 1.\n\n\u2022 Evaluate serum IgG. If IgG is <800 mg/dL and the foal is <18 hours of age and has a functional GI tract, administer good-quality colostrum (specific gravity, >1.060) enterally, or administer IV plasma transfusion, or both. If the foal is >18 hours of age or has compromised GI function, administer plasma. Serum IgG should remain >800 mg/dL. Provide broad-spectrum antibiotics if GI compromise is suspected, if the foal has signs of sepsis, or serum IgG is <800 mg/dL.\n\n\u2022 Attempt to establish the cause of prematurity or dysmaturity. Examine the placenta. If evidence of placentitis is present, initiate broad-spectrum, bactericidal antibiotic therapy. Be watchful for preterm deliveries associated with EHV-1 infection. \u2022 Observe closely for signs of respiratory distress and progressive respiratory fatigue. Therapy depends on the degree of respiratory dysfunction:\n\n\u2022 PaO 2 , <60 mm Hg; PaCO 2 , >60 mm Hg: Initiate IN oxygen therapy, 3 to 10 L/min for an average-sized foal-60 to 200 mL/ kg; increase time spent in sternal recumbency; monitor arterial blood gas values. \u2022 PaO 2 <60 mm Hg, PaCO 2 >65 to 70 mm Hg with respiratory acidosis: Begin PPV with PEEP. Use PPV with tidal volumes of 6 to 10 mL/kg. Attempt to keep peak airway pressure <30 to 40 cm H 2 O and inspired oxygen concentration <50% to reduce risk of barotrauma and oxygen toxicity, and keep PEEP at 4 to 8 cm H 2 O. Excessive PEEP reduces cardiac output and necessitates CRI of dobutamine. Insufficient PEEP may not increase functional residual volume as desired. \u2022 If a foal shows signs of advanced prematurity and signs of severe respiratory distress immediately postpartum, consider intratracheal instillation of surfactant in addition to PPV. Important: This is uncommon: most foals, unless born before 280 days of gestation, do not have primary surfactant deficiency.\n\n\u2022 Maintain carefully controlled environmental temperature if foal shows poor thermoregulation. \u2022 Provide external warmth using warm water pads, radiant heaters, forced warm air blankets, warmed intravenous fluids, and insulated fluid jacket warmers. \u2022 Be careful of inducing hyperthermia because these foals cannot regulate body temperature effectively. Foals should be warmed slowly during the initial resuscitation phase to avoid compounding reperfusion injury, particularly in those having experienced peripartum hypoxia.\n\n\u2022 Reduce risk of decubitus sores by providing soft bedding (e.g., synthetic sheepskin, pressure point pads, plenty of cushion, blankets, and pillows) for recumbent foals.\n\n\u2022 Do not administer aminoglycosides because they inhibit neuromuscular function. \u2022 Do not administer procaine penicillin G or tetracyclines. \u2022 Do not allow the foal to nurse if dysphagia is apparent.\n\n\u2022 Rupture of the urinary structures can involve the bladder, urachus, urethra, ureters, or kidneys. Most commonly, the bladder or urachus is involved. \u2022 Clinical findings include:\n\n\u2022 Lethargy \u2022 Abdominal distention \u2022 Lack of suckling \u2022 Stranguria \u2022 There is little to no observed urination, although the presence of a urine stream does not rule out the presence of uroperitoneum. \u2022 Foals with urachal rents in particular often produce urine streams. \u2022 Tachypnea is common because of restricted tidal volume from the abdominal distention. \u2022 Urachal, urethral, and occasionally ureteral tears result in periumbilical, subcutaneous, and perineal edema, respectively. \u2022 Diagnosis of uroperitoneum is through abdominal ultrasonography and abdominocentesis. \u2022 Definitive diagnosis is the finding of an abdominal fluid creatinine that is twice or more the concentration of serum creatinine. \u2022 Other means of diagnosis are through retrograde contrast radiography using sterile, water-soluble radiopaque material deposited in the bladder. Sterile methylene blue can also be instilled within the bladder with subsequent abdominocentesis to look for blue dye in the abdominal fluid. Practice Tip: The contrast radiography and methylene blue techniques miss ureteral tears and some urachal ruptures; these techniques are seldom needed to diagnose uroperitoneum. \u2022 Cytologic examination of the abdominal fluid may be warranted to rule out other causes of abdominal effusion. \u2022 Serum chemistries usually reveal azotemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hyperkalemia. Foals already hospitalized and treated with sodium-rich crystalloids before rupture can have normal serum sodium and chloride concentrations, and the serum azotemia may be slower to develop. \u2022 Electrocardiography is an important preoperative evaluation for dysrhythmias or alterations in the electrocardiogram caused by hyperkalemia, including:\n\n\u2022 Tented T waves \u2022 Blunted or absent P waves \u2022 Prolonged QRS complex duration and PR interval \u2022 Shortened QT interval \u2022 If only mild incomplete ossification exists, restrict exercise and use corrective shoeing (heel extension for laxity and toe extension for contracture/flexure deformity) and balanced foot trimming as needed to maintain a proper weight-bearing axis. More severe cases, especially those with concurrent angular limb deformities, may require bandaging and splints or tube casts above the fetlock if standing unassisted. Keep foal off slippery surfaces, and provide assistance in rising. \u2022 Use glue-on shoes with appropriate medial or lateral extension to help straighten limbs if valgus or varus is present.\n\n\u2022 Check within 8 to 12 hours of birth. If IgG is <800 mg/dL, administer colostrum supplementation, plasma transfusion, or both.\n\n\u2022 Premature and dysmature foals are at increased risk of infection. Administer broad-spectrum, bactericidal antibiotic therapy (3 to 5 days) until the foal is up and nursing normally.\n\n\u2022 Botulism manifests as generalized weakness, dysphagia, muscle fasciculations, and hypoventilation in the neonatal foal. Most affected foals are approximately 1 month of age, although foals with shaker foal syndrome can range from a few days of age to several months. \u2022 The gait of affected foals is often stilted, and pupillary dilation with ptosis may be present. Foals may be found dead because of respiratory paralysis. \u2022 Most often botulism in the newborn is caused by C. botulinum, type B, which is endemic in areas of the eastern United States. Shaker foal syndrome occurs when foals ingest spores that subsequently vegetate and colonize the GI tract, producing toxin. In addition to type B, types A and C are common on the West Coast.\n\n\u2022 Foals may require mechanical ventilation because of hypoventilation associated with intercostal and diaphragm muscle fatigue. Either pressure support (PS) or synchronous intermittent mechanical ventilation (SIMV) with pressure support is usually adequate. \u2022 Diagnosis is often presumptive and based on clinical findings.\n\nPractice Tip: Positive fecal cultures are strongly supportive in foals. \u2022 Repetitive nerve stimulation of the common peroneal nerve is described as an aid in the diagnosis of botulism in foals. Botulism caused a decrease in the baseline M amplitudes with incremental responses at high rates. \u2022 Treatment usually includes beta-lactam antimicrobials (not procaine penicillin or aminoglycosides because they may affect neuromuscular function) and botulism plasma containing antitoxin. Nutritional support is provided through a feeding (nasogastric) tube, unless ileus is present. Urinary catheters may be required if foals are unable to urinate voluntarily. \u2022 Important: Prevention of type B botulism in foals is through vaccination of the mares. Mares in endemic and high-risk areas should be vaccinated.\n\n\u2022 Meconium impaction: foals present with colic, straining to defecate, tail flagging, and abdominal distention. \u2022 Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH): This is a condition of excessive antidiuretic release. SIADH is proposed to affect foals 12 to 48 hours of age with signs of decreased urine volume, concentrated urine, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia. Serum creatinine concentrations are variable. The foals gain excessive weight consuming a milk diet because of retention of free water within the vascular space. SIADH occurs secondary to brain injury in humans.\n\n\u2022 These foals are not in renal failure, and the treatment of choice is fluid and milk restriction with monitoring of urine output, urine specific gravity, and serum electrolyte values. Clinical signs are associated with electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia), which can be severe.\n\nThe key to diagnosis is concentrated urine and weight gain. \u2022 Tyzzer's disease is an acute, fulminating hepatitis caused by Clostridium piliforme. Pertinent features are the following:\n\n\u2022 The disease affects foals 6 to 42 days of age.\n\n\u2022 Clinical findings include icterus, obtundation, greatly increased concentration of hepatocellular enzymes, severe hypoglycemia, and significant lactic acidosis. \u2022 Foals may be found comatose because of significant hypoglycemia and hypovolemic/septic shock. \u2022 This disease is often fatal, although there is one report of a surviving foal and another involving a suspected case, indicating survival is possible with early and aggressive support. \u2022 Early institution of antimicrobial therapy (aminoglycoside/beta-lactam combination or other) and parenteral nutrition along with supportive measures for liver failure appear to be the key treatments for a rare successful outcome. \u2022 Thoracic radiography or ultrasonography should also be preformed preoperatively because some foals with uroperitoneum can have significant pleural effusion. \u2022 Blood cultures and measurement of serum IgG concentrations are important adjunctive diagnostics. \u2022 Urachal ruptures often develop secondary to urachitis.\n\nCulture of the resected urachus is particularly important in these cases.\n\n\u2022 Preoperative treatment consists of hemodynamic and metabolic stabilization. \u2022 Treat with potassium-free fluids, such as 0.9% saline or isotonic (1.3%) sodium bicarbonate depending on plasma pH. These fluids may increase uroperitoneum volume unless an abdominal drain is placed. \u2022 Means of lowering potassium in addition to dilution include provision of glucose (4 to 8 mg/kg per minute), sodium bicarbonate, and insulin therapy in more refractory cases. \u2022 Calcium is rapidly cardioprotective from the effects of hyperkalemia and should be provided, diluted along with dextrose in the initial fluids administered. \u2022 Clinical Example: Administer 20 mL/kg of 0.9% saline containing 5% dextrose and 0.5 to 1 mL/kg of 23% calcium borogluconate (diluted in saline at no more than 50 mL calcium gluconate per liter) at a rate of 4 to 6 mL/kg/h. If bolus fluid administration is required due to hypovolemia, then 20 mL/kg of 0.9% saline with 1% to 2.5% dextrose and 10 to 15 mL of 23% calcium borogluconate (or more, depending on plasma ionized calcium concentrations) can be administered over 20 to 30 minutes. After 1 L of fluids, if hyperkalemia is still present, additional saline containing dextrose and sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq/kg) can be administered. Calcium and sodium bicarbonate should not be diluted in the same bag of fluids because microprecipitation can occur. \u2022 Urine removal from the abdomen is an important feature in relieving hyperkalemia and improving ventilation. Peritoneal drainage can be performed using teat cannulas or abdominal drains. These are best placed using ultrasound guidance because plugging with omentum is common. Surgery immediately following completion of abdominal drainage is recommended (once potassium has decreased to <5.5 meq/L). Removal of the teat cannula or drain may result in prolapse of omentum and/or subcutaneous accumulation of urine at the drain site. \u2022 If significant pleural effusion is present and causing respiratory compromise, drain the pleural fluid. \u2022 Broad-spectrum antimicrobials should be given because a high percentage of foals with uroperitoneum are septic. \u2022 Colts with ruptured bladders should have indwelling urinary catheters left in place for 1 to 3 days in the postoperative period, or longer if bladder atony is believed to be present, until normal bladder function returns; otherwise, rerupture may occur.\n\n\u2022 Neonatal isoerythrolysis: foals present with icterus, hemolysis, anemia, and hemoglobinuria.\n\nNEO managing the hypoperfusion, including the use of inopressors, need to be considered. \u2022 Note: Dextrose-containing fluids alone are not indicated or appropriate for rapid volume expansion unless hypoglycemia is present. Five percent dextrose in water is not a replacement fluid and should not be used as a fluid bolus treatment. \u2022 The foal should be reevaluated after each bolus and before administration of the next. The goal is volume resuscitation but not overhydration or overloading with sodium. \u2022 Maintenance Fluid Therapy: There are a minimum of two ways of providing maintenance fluid therapy:\n\n\u2022 One: Based on the fluid intake of normal neonatal foals and studies of fluid physiology, the maintenance fluid requirement in the neonatal foal is 4 to 6 mL/kg/h. \u2022 Two: An alternative means of maintenance fluid therapy is using the Holliday-Segar formula, regarded as a \"dry\" or more conservative means of fluid therapy. The minimum \"dry\" maintenance fluid rate is calculated as follows: \u25cb 100 mL/kg per day for the first 10 kg of body mass plus \u25cb 50 mL/kg per day for the second 10 kg of body mass plus \u25cb 20 to 25 mL/kg per day for the remainder of the body mass \u2022 The Holliday-Segar formula provides the volume needed for a recumbent foal not consuming a milk diet for water maintenance and is approximately 94 mL/h for a 50-kg foal. This rate needs to be adjusted upward accordingly to meet losses incurred by the foal because of increased insensible (increased respiration, fever, physical activity) or sensible (increased urine output, gastric reflux, diarrhea) losses. Most foals actually begin at 1.5 to 2 times the calculated \"dry\" rate. \u2022 If the foal is not receiving milk or total parenteral nutrition (PN) as an energy source, then dextrose can be added and the concentration or rate adjusted to provide 4 to 8 mg/kg per minute until dextrose needs are met. \u2022 Normal sodium need for a growing neonatal foal is approximately 1.5 to 3 mEq/kg per day based on milk intake of normal foals and is generally met by the administration of a single liter of plasma or crystalloid containing 140 mEq/L. \u2022 Monitor blood pressure, CVP (goal, 2 to 10 cm H 2 O), urine output, heart rate, peripheral pulses, and respiratory function. There is no \"magic\" number for mean blood pressure in foals, but a mean pressure between 45 and 50 mm Hg is usually adequate if the pulse pressure difference is >30 to 40 mm Hg and clinical signs of perfusion are adequate, especially adequate urination. Other recommendations are to maintain mean arterial pressure at 60 mm Hg or greater. \u2022 The physical examination and clinical condition are the most critical indicators of adequate perfusion:\n\n\u2022 Is the foal warm in its periphery?\n\n\u2022 Are peripheral pulses easily found?\n\n\u2022 Is the foal making urine, and what is the mental status of the foal? \u2022 If the answers to these questions are yes or adequate, then perfusion is acceptable regardless of the blood pressure readings. \u2022 A foal that is ambulatory and rises on its own likely has adequate perfusion. \u2022 Adjunctives to Fluid Therapy: Plasma may be needed to maintain oncotic pressure and intravascular fluid volume.\n\n\u2022 Minimum volume to administer is 20 mL/kg (1 L for an averagesized foal) over 60 minutes, but foals with adequate fluid volume should be administered plasma at a slower rate.\n\n\u2022 Affected foals should be managed with strict biosecurity; 20% or more of the infections may be due to the \"neurovirulent\" strain of EHV-1. \u2022 Fescue toxicosis: Foals born to mares with fescue toxicosis are often dysmature or postmature as a result of prolonged gestational periods and abnormal placentation.\n\n\u2022 They are often large, thin, and have long hair coats, with behavior consistent with peripartum asphyxia. \u2022 Affected foals are treated with supportive care as described for foals with hypoxic-ischemic injury. \u2022 Because agalactia usually develops in the dam, foals must be fed alternative sources of colostrum and milk replacer. \u2022 Treatment of mares exposed to endophyte fungusinfested (Neotyphodium coenophialum) fescue antepartum consists of domperidone, 1 mg/kg PO q24h. Vitamin E supplementation of mares in the last 30 days of gestation may result in higher serum concentrations of IgG in foals nursing affected mares. , and is not associated with metabolic alkalosis (i.e.,\n\n\u2022 One liter of plasma provides the equivalent sodium load of a normal milk diet in a normal foal in a single day. \u2022 Hetastarch or VetStarch may also be used by clinicians at an initial dose of 3 to 10 mL/kg body mass. Note: It is recommended not to use hetastarch at the higher doses until further safety studies are performed because of concerns in the human literature with the use of hetastarch products. Larger doses (more than 10 mL/kg) may cause or exacerbate coagulation abnormalities because they induce a von Willebrand's-like condition. \u2022 Volume expansion alone usually is sufficient to correct mild to moderate metabolic acidosis. Severe metabolic acidosis, especially when caused by a strong ion acidosis (i.e., hyperchloremia or hyponatremia) may necessitate sodium bicarbonate supplementation. This is very common in diarrhea cases with ongoing bicarbonate losses, but be aware that for each milliequivalent of bicarbonate administered, a milliequivalent of sodium also is administered and the subsequent increases in pH decrease plasma potassium. Step 3: Pressor therapy: Norepinephrine, 0.01 to 3.0 \u00b5g/kg per minute \u25cb Norepinephrine is an alpha-agonist pressor agent. \u25cb Norepinephrine should always be used with dobutamine to minimize splanchnic hypoperfusion and to ensure maximum cardiac function. \u25cb Norepinephrine is one of the least offensive pressor agents in terms of GI hypoperfusion in other species. \u2022 Step 4: Vasopressin, 0.25 to 0.4 U/kg per minute \u25cb At this low dose, vasopressin provides support for adrenergic pressors without inducing renal effects, particularly in septic patients. \u25cb A potential concern with vasopressin in foals and other species is GI and splanchnic hypoperfusion. \u25cb Vasopressin should therefore not be used in primary GI cases until studied further, and is reserved for use after norepinephrine has been tried first.\n\n\u2022 If GI function is a concern, begin enteral feeding cautiously at 5% to 10% of the foal's body weight per day or less with gradual advancement of volume as it is tolerated. Supplement with PN if <10% of body weight in milk is fed daily for 2 consecutive days. Do not allow stuporous foals to nurse or drink from a bottle. Always feed foals standing or in sternal recumbency and maintain them in that position for at least 10 minutes after feeding is completed to prevent aspiration. \u2022 Important: Never feed a cold, severely hypotensive foal. Make sure initial fluid replacement, glucose supplementation, and warming occur before the first feeding. \u2022 Parenteral nutrition (PN): These solutions are hypertonic and must be administered continuously through large peripheral veins (e.g., jugular or cranial vena cava) and long catheters (>5 inches [12.5 cm] long) at precise flow rates. Central venous lines (20 cm) with 2 to 3 ports and lumens are ideal for administration of PN. One of the lines can be dedicated to PN administration. Use an infusion pump, dial-a-flow regulator, or a Buretrol 3 solution set to administer PN. \u2022 Monitoring PN:\n\n\u2022 Target Recent studies have shown doxapram to be a safer treatment for perinatal asphyxia and postanesthetic hypoventilation than once believed. It can have side effects such as increased pulmonary pressure and respiratory alkalosis, which should be avoided in foals with lung immaturity and cerebral injury, respectively. \u2022 Caffeine administration has also been used to manage abnormally slow respiratory rate, hypoventilation, and respiratory acidosis resulting from central respiratory center depression. Administer 10 mg/kg PO or per rectum as a loading dose, followed by 2.5 to 3 mg/kg PO once daily as a maintenance dose. Therapeutic trough serum concentration is 5 to 25 \u00b5g/mL. Toxicity (CNS signs) is associated with concentrations greater than 40 to 50 \u00b5g/mL, but these concentrations are rarely achieved in foals. \u2022 Practice Tip: Caffeine is not as effective as doxapram for the treatment of hypoventilation.\n\n\u2022 Hypoglycemia is managed initially with a glucose infusion best administered as a constant infusion at a rate of 4 to 8 mg/kg per minute. This is accomplished by administration of dextrose in fluids as a 5% to 10% solution in maintenance fluids or as a 50% dextrose solution administered through a separate syringe piggy-backed into the maintenance fluid line. The 50% solution should not be administered without diluting in fluids because it is hypertonic and potentially injurious to the endothelium. \u2022 Clinical Example: At this rate, a 50-kg foal would receive 120 to 240 mL of 10% dextrose per hour diluted in crystalloids. Do not give foals bolus infusions of 50% dextrose. \u2022 Caloric requirements: A healthy foal consumes 15% to 25% (or higher) of its body weight daily in milk, which equals 81 to 135 kcal/ kg per day. Sepsis and fever are believed to increase caloric requirements to 150 kcal/kg per day in ambulatory or active foals; however, this may not be true in all cases, and foals that are recumbent and weak likely have reduced caloric requirements even when septic. Many ill foals gain weight on 10% body weight equivalent feeding (~50 to 54 kcal/kg per day) likely because of decreased energy requirements associated with recumbency and lack of normal activity. Studies have suggested the energy requirement of recumbent, sick foals is as low as 43 to 55 kcal/kg/day. \u2022 Enteral feeding: Use mare's milk, foal milk replacer, goat's milk, or a combination. \u2022 Gentamicin: 6.6 mg/kg IV q24h, and up to 10 mg/kg IV q24h in foals <7 days of age. Peak and trough concentrations should be monitored; ideally peak should be \u226510 times the MIC and trough <1 \u00b5g/mL at 20 to 23 hours after administration. If MIC data are not available, the 1-hour postadministration peak should be \u226520 \u00b5g/mL. Note: Gentamicin is believed to be potentially more nephrotoxic than amikacin in very young foals; use with caution and only in well-hydrated foals. Serial monitoring of plasma creatinine should be performed while foals are treated with gentamicin. Note: Many gram-negative organisms may be resistant to gentamicin. \u2022 Ceftiofur sodium: 2 to 10 mg/kg IV q12h; 5 mg/kg IV q 12 h for most uses; may also be administered SQ (Hall et al, 2011) . In foals with renal insufficiency, longer treatment intervals are recommended because of reduced clearance. One can use ceftiofur in combination with aminoglycoside (i.e., amikacin) coverage for increased gram-negative and Staphylococcus spectrum. \u2022 Recently the continuous rate infusion (CRI) of ceftiofur has been described (Wearn et al, 2013) . CRI administration is an alternative administrative method for ceftiofur in foals. Because it is a time-dependent antimicrobial, maintenance of plasma concentrations above the MIC of the microbe for the entire dosing interval is optimal. The recommended dose to achieve plasma steady-state concentrations of 2 \u00b5g/mL, based on experimental data (Wearn et al, 2013) is: \u25cb Bolus loading dose of 1.26 mg/kg \u25cb Follow immediately by a CRI of 2.86 \u00b5g/kg/min to maintain plasma concentrations of desfuroylceftiofur (DCA) \u22652 \u00b5g/mL (total daily dose, approximately 5.4 mg/kg/day). For more resistant bacteria (MIC >2 \u00b5g/mL), higher dose rates are required. \u2022 Ceftiofur crystalline-free acid 4 can also be used in foals. The labeled dose of 6.6 mg/kg, administered subcutaneously (SQ) q72h is effective against only 79% of bacterial isolates obtained from foals (it is expected to be effective against bacteria with a MIC \u2264 0.5 \u00b5g/mL (Hall et al, 2011) . To increase the spectrum of activity, the dose needs to be increased and the administration interval may need to be decreased; requires additional pharmacokinetic studies. Swellings at the injection site are common. \u2022 Ticarcillin/clavulanic acid: 50 to 100 mg/kg IV q6h; indicated for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections susceptible to the drug.\n\n\u2022 Lipids should contribute approximately 50% nonprotein calories. \u2022 To ensure the amino acids are used for structural protein and not catabolized for energy, the ratio of nonprotein calories to grams of nitrogen should be maintained between 100 and 200. Caloric density:\n\n\u2022 Lipids, 9.0 kcal/g \u2022 Carbohydrate (glucose), 3.4 to 4.0 kcal/g \u2022 Protein (amino acids), 4.0 kcal/g \u2022 Starting formula of PN for short-term use <3 days:\n\n\u2022 A lipid-free formula: Use a 1 : 1 solution of 50% dextrose and 8.5% amino acids can be used in foals, with a caloric content of 1.02 kcal/mL. \u2022 Target a caloric rate of 50 kcal/kg/day for recumbent, sick foals.\n\n\u2022 Begin with 25% of target rate, and increase every 4 to 6 hours until target is reached in 24 hours. During this 24-hour period, dextrose is supplemented at 4 mg/kg/min initially; a decrease by 25% of the rate occurs every 4 to 6 hours as the PN formula is increased. \u2022 Supply B and C vitamins separately; dilute in crystalloids.\n\n\u2022 Starting formula of PN for longer-term use (\u22653 days):\n\n\u2022 Potassium chloride is added to the parenteral formula if needed.\n\n\u2022 When first starting PN with lipids, begin at one fourth the desired flow rate. Check blood for lipemia and check blood and urine for hyperglycemia (blood glucose concentration, >180 mg/ dL) at 3-to 4-hour intervals, and increase flow rate by one fourth until the final rate is achieved. \u2022 Clinical Example 1: Sample calculation for 50-kg foal:\n\n\u2022 Dextrose: 10 g/kg per day = 500 g = 1 L of 50% dextrose \u2022 Amino acids: 2 g/kg per day = 100 g = 1 L of 10% amino acids or 1.2 L of 8.5% \u2022 Lipids: 1 g/kg per day = 50 g = 0.5 L of 10% lipids \u2022 Total volume: 2.5 L of PN. Caloric content is approximately 1.14 kcal/mL. \u2022 Clinical Example 2: Another formula commonly used for \u22653 days in 50-kg foal:\n\n\u2022 1 L of 50% dextrose \u2022 1.5 L of 8.5% amino acids \u2022 0.5 L of 20% lipids \u2022 Total volume: 3.0 L of PN. Caloric content is approximately 1.13 kcal/mL. \u2022 To provide 50 kcal/kg to a 50-kg foal, approximately 2200 mL of this latter formula is required per day, equating to 91 mL/h. As tolerated, the PN can be increased to provide approximately 75 kcal/kg per day, or 140 mL/h. \u2022 Begin PN at 35 mL/h. Slowly increase the rate every 3 to 4 hours by 35 mL, frequently checking glucose concentrations of plasma/serum, until 90 to 140 mL/h is reached for an averagesized foal. \u2022 Note: Human critical care studies suggest lipids may be proinflammatory in sepsis.\n\n\u2022 Broad-spectrum, bactericidal antimicrobials are indicated. Treatment should be based on culture and sensitivity results whenever possible. \u2022 Administer antimicrobial therapy for a minimum of 10 to 14 days in foals with documented bacteremia, provided that no localized areas of infection develop requiring more prolonged treatment. \u2022 Specific sites of infection (e.g., pneumonia, meningitis, arthritis, and osteomyelitis) require prolonged antimicrobial therapy for 30 days or longer. Penicillin and aminoglycoside antimicrobials constitute a \u2022 Pharyngeal paresis associated with peripartum asphyxia or selenium deficiency is usually a transient disorder and resolves with time and selenium supplementation if deficient.\n\n\u2022 Treat the underlying cause, if known.\n\n\u2022 Affected foals need to be fed through a nasogastric tube if too weak to voluntarily drink, or muzzled and allowed to drink milk from a bucket held in a dependent position to minimize the potential for aspiration. Most have a good prognosis with time, unless there is an irreparable congenital defect. \u2022 Treat aspiration pneumonia. \u2022 Foals homozygous for the HYPP gene are usually dysphagic and dysphonic as neonates.\n\n\u2022 Nasal regurgitation of milk, ptyalism, and stridor are common.\n\n\u2022 A DNA test for HYPP is available.\n\n\u2022 Many foals improve as they grow.\n\n\u2022 Severe cases need to be managed with acetazolamide (2 mg/kg PO q12h) and/or phenytoin (2.8 to 10 mg/kg PO q12h). Therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed for phenytoin (goal: 5 to 10 \u00b5g/mL). Important: Phenytoin minimizes clinical signs but does not prevent hyperkalemia, while acetazolamide modulates plasma potassium levels and aids in preventing hyperkalemia.\n\n\u2022 Poor nursing behavior: \"milk face\" from milk streaming down the foal's face \u2022 Rolling, treading \u2022 Abnormal posture while recumbent \u2022 Abdominal distention \u2022 Teeth grinding \u2022 Tachycardia, tachypnea \u2022 Tenesmus\n\n\u2022 Meconium impaction: This is generally confirmed with abdominal palpation and digital examination. Abdominal radiography or ultrasonography is used to visualize more orad impactions. Overzealous treatment for meconium impaction with repeated enemas can result in colic or straining because of proctitis or perineal irritation. \u2022 Ileus: Associated with GI hypoxia from peripartum asphyxia or septic shock \u2022 Intussusception: This is seen with ultrasonography (\"target\" lesion of intussusceptum invaginating into the intussuscipiens) and associated with intestinal hypoxia and resultant dysmotility. \u2022 Enteritis/peritonitis: Frequently caused by clostridial microorganisms or viruses and accompanying bacteremia. Foals are often colicky before development of diarrhea. \u2022 Gastroduodenal ulceration: This is uncommon as a primary cause of colic in the neonate but may be a primary problem\n\n\u2022 Apply sterile ocular lubricant to the eyes of foals that spend most of their time in lateral recumbency to prevent exposure keratitis and ulceration. Carefully evaluate both eyes daily for corneal ulcers. \u2022 Gastroprotectants can be administered if warranted. Gastroduodenal ulcers in these patients may be associated with GI hypoperfusion rather than gastric pH. Critically ill foals may have an alkaline gastric environment and a blunted response to inhibitors of acid production; thus the use of histamine-2 (H 2 )-antagonists may be of little use in the care of these patients. Milk in the stomach is alkalinizing to the gastric contents, and frequent feeding is protective if the foal is tolerant of enteral nutrition. \u2022 A report (Furr M et al, 2012) described the use of antiulcer medications in hospitalized neonatal foals and an associated increased risk of diarrhea. Omeprazole, ranitidine, cimetidine, and sucralfate were all associated with an increased odds ratio of diarrhea.\n\n\u2022 Gastroprotectant options include: \u2022 Ranitidine, 6.6 mg/kg PO q8h, 1.5 mg/kg IV q8h, also a mild prokinetic, and/or \u2022 Famotidine, 2.8 mg/kg PO q12h or 0.3 mg/kg IV q12h or \u2022 Omeprazole, 2 to 4 mg/kg PO q24h +/\u2212 \u2022 Sucralfate, 20 mg/kg PO q6h Dysphagia \u2022 Dysphagia in foals is common and can manifest as:\n\n\u2022 Nasal regurgitation of milk \u2022 An inability to prehend (suckle) \u2022 Aspiration pneumonia \u2022 Differential diagnoses for inability to prehend include:\n\n\u2022 and none of the above possibilities defines the problem. Most of these affected foals drink successfully from a pan/bucket placed on the ground. There may be a breed predisposition for this problem.\n\n\u2022 The foal is usually sedated for the procedure (e.g., diazepam \u00b1 butorphanol). \u2022 Use Mucomyst or powdered N-acetyl-L-cysteine. If Mucomyst is used, add 40 mL of 20% solution to 160 mL water to make a 4%\n\nsolution. If using the powder, add 8 g of powder and 1 1 2 tbsp (\u223c22.5 g) of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to 200 mL of water. Gently insert a lubricated Foley urinary catheter (30F with 30-mL balloon in most average-sized foals) with a balloon tip approximately 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) into the rectum (as long as it passes without resistance) and gently inflate the balloon. Slowly infuse 4 to 7 oz (120 to 200 mL) of acetylcysteine solution by gravity flow into the rectum. Occlude the catheter end for a minimum of 15 minutes (ideally 45 minutes). Deflate the balloon and remove the catheter. The retention enema can be repeated. \u2022 Administer N-butylscopolammonium bromide 9 (0.3 mg/kg body weight slowly IV or SQ once)\n\n\u2022 Proximal (high) impactions require oral laxatives in addition to enemas. The safest, least irritating laxative is mineral oil (120 to 160 mL) administered through a nasogastric tube if the foal is >12 to 18 hours of age. Mineral oil lubricates around the impaction and reduces the risk of complete obstruction, which can rapidly result in severe and painful gas accumulation and abdominal distention. Practice Tip: Milk of magnesia (60 to 120 mL) is an oral laxative that must be used conservatively. \u2022 Do Not Use: Castor oil or DSS administered orally is not recommended because of excessive mucosal irritation and increased risk of severe diarrhea and colic.\n\n\u2022 Intravenous fluid therapy is useful in cases of refractory impaction. Dextrose supplementation is recommended if nursing is curtailed because of increasing abdominal distention and colic. \u2022 In general, foals should not be allowed to nurse until the meconium begins to pass. Dextrose supplementation should be provided (4 mg/kg/min) and PN should be instituted if the colic and distention lasts longer than 24 hours.\n\n\u2022 Bowel trocarization should only be used in rare cases. If severe abdominal distention develops before the impaction resolves, enough to cause severe, life-threatening respiratory compromise, consider the technique described for cecal trocarization if cecal dilation is present (see Chapter 18, p. 160, and p. 548). Trocarization often provides immediate pain relief without excessive medication and allows time for medical therapy and potential presurgical stabilization. Be aware of the risk of causing potentially fatal septic peritonitis. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials should be administered.\n\n\u2022 Surgical exploration and relief of the impaction may be indicated in foals with severe abdominal distention resulting in respiratory and cardiovascular compromise (intraabdominal hypertension with abdominal compartment syndrome).\n\n\u2022 Analgesics and sedatives may be needed to prevent self-trauma in foals that are recumbent and rolling. \u2022 Flunixin meglumine: 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg IV q24 to 36h provided that renal function is normal; avoid repetitive doses because of its in the older foal. Many gastric ulcers are clinically \"silent\" in neonatal foals. \u2022 Intestinal volvulus: Important: A true surgical emergency.\n\nDiagnosis is suspected based on clinical signs of severe pain, reflux, and abdominal distention. Ultrasonographic evaluation of the abdomen can confirm the presence of multiple loops of turgid, distended small intestine with minimal to no motility. Abdominal distention is often rapid and severe. \u2022 Chlyoabdomen: Often transient and no cause identified.\n\n\u2022 Practice Tip: Meconium impaction is more common in colts than in fillies. It is not unusual for the foals to also have FPT of immunity; perhaps colostrum ingestion aids in meconium expulsion, or failure to absorb ingested IgG indicates intestinal malfunction. \u2022 In addition to colic, abdominal distention, and poor nursing behavior, affected foals may have tenesmus, tail flagging, and an arched-back posture. If obstruction is complete, abdominal distention can develop rapidly.\n\n\u2022 Palpation of firm meconium in the rectum and pelvic canal on gentle digital examination \u2022 A history of unsuccessful straining to defecate \u2022 Firm fecal material in the pelvic inlet detected with abdominal palpation, plain radiography, or contrast radiography after a barium enema examination \u2022 Sonographic detection of echogenic material in the distal colon and rectum\n\n\u2022 Use a soft urinary catheter or small rubber feeding tube and enema bucket with 75 to 180 mL of the solution. If repeated enemas are needed, alternate soapy water with warm water or water mixed with J-lube or rectal lubricant to minimize excessive mucosal irritation. Practice Tip: Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS) enemas should not be used because of irritation and secondary proctitis. If repeated enemas are needed, the solution can be diluted to half-strength sodium chloride (a 1 : 1 ratio of 0.9% saline and water) made into a soapy water enema. This avoids excessive free water enemas and subsequent hyponatremia. \u2022 Sodium phosphate 8 enemas made for humans can also be used in foals. However, no more than one \"adult\" sized or two \"pediatric\" sized enemas are used per day because of the potential for hyperphosphatemia. \u2022 Note: Repeated enemas may lead to pathologic tenesmus and rectal edema!\n\n\u2022 High, retention enemas are indicated in foals with high (orad) meconium impactions and in those with impactions that do not resolve with soapy water or sodium phosphate enemas."}
