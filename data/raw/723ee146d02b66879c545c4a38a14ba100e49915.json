She was admitted to the intensive care unit for respiratory failure and septic shock ( Figure 1A) . She was treated for community-acquired pneumonia and septic shock, with antibiotics and intravenous hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) for 6 days. She improved clinically (defervesce, extubated, blood pressure stabilized) and The American Journal of Medicine (2007) 120, e7-e10 radiologically ( Figure 1B) . However, fever returned 3 days after steroid cessation and she required re-intubation 1 week later ( Figure 1C ). The diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis was subsequently confirmed by high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax and open lung biopsy (granulomata with acid-fast bacilli). She improved with antituberculous therapy plus a short course of corticosteroid.\n\nThe second patient was a 24-year-old Chinese man who presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea (Table) . He was initially treated for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and prednisolone 80 mg daily. He improved promptly clinically and radiologically, but deteriorated again upon steroid withdrawal (Figure 2A-C) . Later, miliary tuberculosis was confirmed by open lung biopsy.\n\nAlthough transient resolution of fever is commonly observed, we further show that prompt (albeit partial and transient) radiological improvement is possible with corticosteroid administration without antituberculous agents in miliary tuberculosis. Although other possible explanations for the initial improvement (eg, treatment of co-existing bacterial pathogen, mycobactericidal effect of levofloxacin) cannot be ruled out. The observed associations are striking, and subsequent deterioration following corticosteroid withdrawal strongly supports its role. The partial improvements may mislead clinicians to attribute clinical responses to concomitant antibacterial therapy, thus delaying diagnosis \n\nThe American Journal of Medicine, Vol 120, No 12, December 2007 of tuberculosis. 3 Similar diagnostic pitfall has been reported with the empirical use of fluoroquinolone in pneumonia. 4 Therefore, given its diverse clinical (including acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction) 1 and radiological (eg, air-space consolidations, ground-glass appearances, lower lobe involvements) 1,3 features, it is prudent to investigate for tuberculosis in the context of unex-plained sepsis 1,3 or severe pneumonia when corticosteroid is administered, 5 and to avoid empirical fluoroquinolone treatment 4 when tuberculosis cannot be safely excluded, particularly in areas with a moderate-to-high tuberculosis burden. Corticosteroid has been used as \"adjunctive\" therapy in severe tuberculous infections (eg, meningitis, pericariditis, fulminant pneumonia) to reduce complications. 1 Prompt clinico- radiological responses also are observed for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and varicella pneumonia, where immunopathogenesis is important. Skewed Th2 cytokine responses (eg, elevated interleukin-4, interleukin-10, and interleukin-13) are demonstrated in extensive/cavitatory pulmonary and miliary tuberculosis. 1 Hyper-production of tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 and interleukin-1\u2424, stimulated by lipoarabinomannan, also triggers acute lung injury. Corticosteroids can inhibit expression of these cytokines, suppressing symptoms. 6 It is important for clinicians to be aware that corticosteroid may mask the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Delay in antituberculous treatment may lead to higher mortality. 1 "}
