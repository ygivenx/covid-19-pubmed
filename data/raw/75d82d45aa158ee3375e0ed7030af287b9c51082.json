{"title": "Pairwise coupling analysis of helical junction hydrogen bonding interactions in luteoviral RNA pseudoknots \u2020 NIH Public Access Author Manuscript", "body": "proteins (P1, P2) from a single ribosomal initiation site while regulating the relative ratios of gene products (P1 vs. P1-P2) as dictated by the efficiency of the frameshift. Maintaining a proper ratio of gene products has been shown to be important for viral propagation and infectivity in retroviruses and yeast retrotransposable elements (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) .\n\nFor efficient frameshifting to occur, several elements must be present in the mRNA (10) . The first is a slip site, which in most cases conforms to the sequence X XXY YYZ, where X is any nucleotide, Y is A or U, and Z is any nucleotide except G (11) . The slip site is positioned in the A and P sites of the ribosome at the time frameshifting occurs. Also required for efficient frameshifting is an RNA structural element, which in many cases is an RNA pseudoknot. This RNA structural element is separated from the 3\u2032 edge of the slip site by a 6 to 8 nucleotide linker. The linker length is likely required for optimally positioning the pseudoknot at the mRNA entry tunnel of the ribosome where the RNA helicase activity is thought to be localized (12) (13) (14) . \u22121 PRF is responsible for the production of the genomically encoded P1 and P1-P2 fusion proteins in plant luteoviruses (15) . The stimulatory RNA structure in luteoviral mRNAs is a hairpin (H)-type RNA pseudoknot, which contains two helical stems (S1, S2) connected by nonequivalent loops (L1, L2). Luteoviral RNA pseudoknots are characterized by an intricate collection of stabilizing tertiary structural loop-loop and loop-stem hydrogen bonding interactions (16) (17) (18) (19) . A C + \u00b7(G-C) L1-S2 major groove trans Watson-Crick/Hoogsteen base triple has been observed in all luteoviral pseudoknots thus far investigated and protonation has been shown to be stabilizing by 2-3 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 at 37 \u00baC (20) . Further, this interaction is essential for the efficient frameshift stimulation by these pseudoknots (16, 17, 21, 22) . Two L2-S1 minor groove interactions at the helical junction have also been shown to be important for pseudoknot stability and maintenance of frameshifting efficiency (20) .\n\nThe solution structure of the P1-P2 frameshifting mRNA pseudoknot from sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) is unique since the L2-S1 minor groove base triple closest to the helical junction is formed by an L2 cytidine (C27) rather than an adenosine, which is found in this position in all other luteoviral RNAs (16) (see Fig. 1A,B) . Surprisingly, substitution of C27 with adenosine resulted in a nearly complete abrogation of ScYLV pseudoknot-stimulated frameshifting in a simple in vitro assay (from 15% to 1.8%, or \u22482-fold above slip-site alone), with virtually no change in the global structure of the RNA (16, 23) . The major structural difference was found at the helical junction (23) . Formation of the C27\u00b7(C14-G7) minor groove triple in the WT ScYLV pseudoknot at the helical junction ( Fig. 1B) allows for the rearrangement of the immediately adjacent major groove C8 + \u00b7(G-C) base triple on which it is stacked, so that C8 moves \u22482.3 \u00c5 relative to the accepting base pair (G12-C28) when compared to the C27A ScYLV RNA (23) (Fig. 1C ). This rearrangement likely contributes to a global destabilization of the C27A RNA by \u22481-1.5 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 (\u0394\u0394G 37 ) relative to the WT RNA (16) .\n\nThe relationship between global stability and frameshift stimulation is not entirely clear. The global stability of the downstream structural element, per se, cannot be fully responsible for frameshifting since an RNA hairpin of a global stability similar to that of an RNA pseudoknot does not induce comparable levels of frameshift stimulation (24, 25) . This suggests that there is some feature encoded in the pseudoknot topology itself that is capable of modulating frameshift stimulation. Since structure is unlikely to play a major role (23), one possibility is that a small localized destabilization of the helical junction itself is a major contributor to a decrease in global stability and this, in turn, might account for functional differences between structurally similar RNA pseudoknots. We reasoned that such a destabilization in the C27A ScYLV RNA relative to the WT RNA may well originate with distinct energies of pairwise coupling, \u03b4 AB i , of the two stacked hydrogen bonds that cross the helical junction in these two RNAs (16,23) (see Fig. 1 ). In this paper, we employ thermal melting experiments carried out as a function of pH with site-specific deoxycytidine (dC)-substituted RNAs to elucidate \u03b4 AB i of the C8 + H3-G12 O6 and C27 N3-C14 2\u2032-OH (\u03b4 AB WT ) or A27 N1-C14 2\u2032-OH (\u03b4 AB C27A ) hydrogen bonding interactions at the helical junction of the WT vs. C27A ScYLV RNAs and compare these findings to previous studies of the related frameshifting mRNA from beet western yellows virus (BWYV) (see Fig. 1D ) (20) . We find that both WT RNAs are characterized by a \u03b4 AB i consistent with cooperative hydrogen bond formation. In contrast, the C27A ScYLV RNA is characterized by a pairwise coupling indicative of non-additive hydrogen bond formation, despite the fact the helical junction regions of the weakly functional C27A ScYLV and wild-type BWYV RNAs are quite similar (23) . The implications of these findings on pseudoknot-mediated frameshift stimulation are discussed.\n\nThe WT and C27A ScYLV RNAs were synthesized by in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA Polymerase as described previously (16) . The dC14 and dC14/C27A ScYLV RNAs were purchased from Dharmacon (Boulder, CO) and deprotected according to the manufacturers recommendations. All four RNAs were purified by denaturing PAGE, electroeluted, and desalted using C18 chromatography. The RNA samples were prepared for melting experiments by extensive dialysis (over \u22489 h) against several changes of buffer for a total of 2 L of the appropriate buffer containing 0.5 M KCl. The first buffer change contained 5 mM EDTA to remove adventitiously bound divalent metal ions. The following buffers were used at a final concentration of 10 mM: acetate (pH 5.0), MES (pH 5.5 and pH 6.0), MOPS (pH 6.5 and pH 7.0), EPPS (pH 7.5, pH 8.0, and pH 8.5), and CHES (pH 9.0) (26) .\n\nAll samples were prepared for NMR spectroscopy by multiple rounds of ethanol precipitation. The final NMR buffer was 10 mM potassium phosphate, 100 mM KCl and 5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 6.0, with a final sample concentration of ~2 mM for WT ScYLV, ~1 mM for C27A ScYLV, and ~0.5 mM for dC14 and dC14/C27A ScYLV RNAs. The proton resonances were referenced to an internal standard (100 \u03bcM DSS). The jump-return echo 1D spectra were recorded at a proton resonance frequency of 500 MHz. For each spectrum, 512 transients were collected with a spectral width of 12.5 kHz and 2048 complex points. Watergate 1 H-1 H NOESY spectra (\u03c4 mix =200 ms) were collected with 1024 complex points in the direct dimension and 512 complex points in the indirect dimension with spectral width of 12.5 kHz in each dimension in order to obtain imino proton and 2\u2032-OH proton resonance assignments.\n\nOptical melting experiments were performed on a Cary 1 spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller. The temperature range was increased from 5 to 95 \u00b0C at a constant ramp rate of 0.3 \u00b0C/min. Absorbance data were acquired at 260 and 280 nm and both sets of derivative data (dA 260 /dT and dA 280 /dT) were subjected to a simultaneous nonlinear least squares fit to a multiple (i) sequential interacting two-state transition model that optimizes \u0394H i and t m,i for the unfolding of each ith unfolding step as implemented by the algorithm tmelt assuming \u0394C p \u00ba=0 (27, 28) . The criteria used to determine the number of unfolding transitions is described in the text and elsewhere (16) . The final RNA concentration for the UV melting experiments was 2 \u03bcM in a 600 \u03bcL cuvette. Three or more useable melting profiles were collected for each solution condition and analyzed individually to extract \u0394H i and t m,i with the resulting parameters obtained from multiple experiments averaged (see Tables S1-S4, Supporting Information). The unfolding entropies were obtained from \u0394S i = \u0394H i /t m while \u0394G 37 = \u0394H i -310.15*\u0394S i . Folding parameters assume microscopic reversibility where \u0394G 37 (unfolding) = \u2212\u0394G 37 (folding) and \u0394H vH (unfolding) = \u2212\u0394H vH (folding). Here, we report \u0394G 37 (folding). Melting experiments performed at higher and lower RNA concentrations were used to establish unimolecular unfolding behavior of all RNAs studied here. Additionally, extensive NMR investigation of the WT and C27A RNAs at concentrations as high as 3 mM showed no signs of aggregation (data not shown) (16) .\n\nIt was first important to establish the degree to which the dC14 substitution influences the structure of the WT and C27A ScYLV RNAs. The downfield regions of jump-return echo 1D NMR spectra acquired at 10 \u00baC, pH 6.0 for each of the four RNAs are shown in Fig. 2 . The resonance assignments shown for dC14 and dC14/C27A ScYLV RNAs were confirmed by a 200 ms Watergate 1 H-1 H NOESY spectrum collected at 10 \u00b0C (data not shown). The 1D spectra of the WT and dC14 ScYLV RNAs clearly show that both RNAs are stably folded and that the C8 + imino and amino protons are present; both features are diagnostic for the trans Watson-Crick/Hoogsteen C+\u00b7(G-C) interaction between C8+ and the G12-C28 base pair (29) (see Fig.  1B ,C). Although the imino proton chemical shift of C8+ is degenerate with that of G30 in the C27A RNA and G6 in the dC14/C27A RNA, both RNAs are stably folded since the amino protons are clearly present (Fig. 1C,D) . As expected, the 2\u2032-OH of C14 is absent in the dC14/ C27A ScYLV RNA (Fig. 2D ). Since the WT C14 2\u2032-OH resonance (\u2248 8.5 ppm) (16) is in a crowded region of the 1D spectrum, a 200 ms NOESY spectrum was used to confirm the absence of this 2\u2032-OH proton in the dC14 ScYLV RNA (data not shown).\n\nThe unfolding of luteoviral RNA pseudoknots has been investigated previously by thermal unfolding as monitored by UV spectroscopy at 260 and 280 nm and differential scanning calorimetry (16, 20, 26) . These RNA pseudoknots are composed of a 5 base pair S1 (4 in the case of potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) (19)), a 3 base pair S2, a 2 nucleotide loop L1, and a 7 to 9 nucleotide loop L2. A coupled equilibrium model comprising three sequential, two-state unfolding transitions (Scheme 1) previously established for the BWYV pseudoknot (26) was applied to other wild-type and variant pseudoknots when sufficient resolution of individual unfolding transitions was observed on the temperature coordinate (20) . Each equilibrium unfolding step is characterized by a van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding, \u0394H vH , and a melting temperature, t m , (see Schemes 1,2). In the 3-step unfolding profile, the first unfolding step is assigned to disruption of the loop-stem (L2-S1 and L1-S2) interactions in the fully folded (F) RNA pseudoknot to form PK, which is followed by the unfolding of the weaker stem S2 (S1 HP), and subsequently stem S1 (U). In cases where the first two unfolding steps were coincident on the temperature axis and sufficient unfolding enthalpy was recovered under this transition, Scheme 2 was used to analyze the melting profiles. In this scheme. the disruption of the tertiary structural interactions and S2 occurs during the first unfolding transition giving rise to a single S1 HP intermediate (16) .\n\nThermal melting profiles (dA/dT) monitored by UV spectroscopy were obtained for the WT, dC14, C27A and dC14/C27A ScYLV RNAs at pH values ranging from 5.0 to pH 9.0 at 0.5 M KCl, the latter used to facilitate comparison with previous studies with the BWYV RNA (see Figs. 3-4) (20) . Inspection of these melting profiles reveals that the t m 's for all transitions excepting the last one are strongly affected by the pH; since the last unfolding transition is reporting on S1 melting, the t m is as expected, independent of pH (data not shown) (16) . This is consistent with the unfolding models shown (Schemes 1 and 2) and with protonation of C8 N3 only in the folded RNA (16, 20, 26) . It is interesting to note that the dC14 RNAs, which destroy single C27 N3-C14 2\u2032-OH and A27 N1-C14 2\u2032-OH hydrogen bonds in WT and C27A ScYLV RNAs, respectively, break the coincident unfolding of S2 and tertiary structural interactions that characterize both WT and C27A ScYLV RNAs.\n\nThe pH-dependence of folding, \u0394G 37 as calculated in Materials and Methods, is plotted in Figure 5 , filled circles, for the indicated luteoviral RNA with data analyzed by two independent pH-dependent folding models. The first model is a simple binding model (eq. 1) that attributes the entire change in \u0394G 37 as a function of pH to protonation of a single group in the folded RNA according to the function [1] where \u0394G 37 unprotonated and \u0394G 37 protonated represent the \u0394G 37 values for the fully unprotonated and fully protonated state of the folded RNA molecules, respectively (20) . Here, pK a is an apparent pK a where K a is equal to the acid dissociation equilibrium constant that governs C8 + deprotonation. This may not reflect the intrinsic pK a , since this analysis ignores differential H + binding to the unfolded state relative to the folded state outside of this titratable group, and linkage to acid-induced or alkaline-induced unfolding (see below) (30) . The fits to the data are displayed in Figure 5 (continuous line) with the resolved thermodynamic parameters from the fits compiled in Table 1 . As was previously shown, the C27A RNA is destabilized with respect to the WT ScYLV RNA due to the rearrangement of the helical junction by \u22481.2 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 over the entire pH-range (16) . The \u0394G 37 protonated of the dC14 RNA is 0.6\u00b10.2 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 less than the WT ScYLV RNA with \u0394G 37 unprotonated the same within experimental error. Interestingly, the downward shift for C27A in the apparent pK a is only 0.4 units, which is much smaller than the 1.6 unit shift previously observed for the dC14 BWYV RNA (20) . In contrast to the dC14 ScYLV RNA, the \u0394G 37 protonated for dC14/C27A ScYLV RNA is approximately equal to \u0394G 37 protonated for the reference C27A RNA (\u0394\u0394G protonated =0.2 \u00b10.3 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 ), with the \u0394G 37 unprotonated more positive by 0.7 (\u00b10.3) kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 ; here, there is a negligible shift in apparent pK a .\n\nThe second model used to fit the \u0394G 37 vs. pH data is a linkage model that accounts for linkage of a single protonation site in the folded state to acid-induced denaturation that occurs on protonation of all cytidine N3 and adenosine N1 groups in the unfolded state (30) . The data were fit to the equation [2] where is the ligand free U to F reaction (conceptually analogous to \u0394G 37 unprotonated in the binding model), and [3] [ 4] where n A and n C , respectively, equal the number of adenosines and cytidines in the molecule.\n\nThe pK a values for and were fixed to 3.7 and 4.4, respectively, and represent the intrinsic pK a of the N1 of adenosine and the N3 of cytosine, respectively (30) . This leaves just two fitted parameters, pK a, f and . The two terms, \u03a3 f and \u03a3 u reflect the sum contributions of protonation in the folded and unfolded states of the RNA. Best-fit curves to the linkage equation are superimposed (dashed lines) on the experimental data ( Figure 5 ) with the pK a, f and values given in Table 1 . As can be seen, the \u0394G 37 unprotonated and are in reasonably good agreement for all of the RNA molecules. Note that the calculated pK a values predicted from the linkage model are significantly higher than those from the binding equation, as expected (30) . The linkage equation should better resolve the microscopic pK a for protonation of C8 + in the folded state, provided data are obtained at pH lower that 5.0, since this is when the two functions strongly diverge from one another; however, this point was not investigated here (30) .\n\nTo obtain insight into the effect of pH on the unfolding of the dC14 RNAs relative to the WT and C27A RNA counterparts, \u0394\u0394G 37 was calculated for the binding model (eq. 5) and linkage model (eq. 6) and the simulated curves, derived from the parameter values compiled in Table  1 , superimposed on the experimental data, \u0394\u0394G 37 exp ( Figure 6 ).\n\n[5]\n\nAlthough there is significant scatter given the small \u0394\u0394G 37 values, the simulated curves generated from the binding model capture the general trends in the experimental data reasonably well (Fig. 6A ). In contrast, the simulated curve generated from the linkage model approximates the data less well (Fig. 6B) . The reason for this is embodied in the function (eq. 2) itself which reduces to [7] where provided . This is a reasonable assumption since the two RNAs are the same length and have the identical base compositions (the same number of A and C residues), and differ only by a single oxygen atom. When mutant and WT RNAs have identical pK a values, the second term in eq. 7 vanishes, reducing to , i.e., a straight line. In the case where pK a mut \u2260pK a WT the function is strictly monotonic, i.e. always increasing or decreasing.\n\nA standard double mutant cycle strategy was next employed to obtain \u03b4 AB WT and \u03b4 AB C27A using the WT\u00b7H+ as the overall system reference state (see Fig. 7 ). \u03b4 AB WT is the pairwise coupling free energy that defines the extent to which elimination of both C27 N3-C14 2\u2032-OH (via the deoxyC14 substitution) and C8 + H3-G12 O6 (via raising the pH) hydrogen bonds in the WT ScYLV RNA (\u0394G AB WT ) differs from the sum of the loss of each hydrogen bond individually (\u0394G A WT and \u0394G B WT , respectively) (31). Likewise, \u03b4 AB C27A defines the analogous free energy difference for the C27A ScYLV pseudoknot, i.e., loss of the A27 N1-C14 2\u2032-OH (\u0394G A C27A ) and C8 + H3-G12 O6 (\u0394G B C27A ) hydrogen bonds individually or in combination (\u0394G AB C27A ). \u03b4 AB i is therefore defined as [9] \u0394G A i , \u0394G B i and \u0394G AB i are obtained by manipulation of \u0394G 37 protonated for WT\u00b7H+, dC14\u00b7H +, C27A\u00b7H+ and dC14-C27A\u00b7H+ ScYLV RNAs, i.e., the RNA species on the left side of the thermodynamic cube (Fig. 7) . and \u0394G 37 unprotonated for the same four deprotonated RNAs, i.e., those on the right side of the thermodynamic cube (Fig. 7) . These \u0394G 37 protonated and \u0394G 37 unprotonated values are compiled in Table 1 and reproduced on the thermodynamic cube in Fig. 7 (in italics) . For example, \u0394G A WT = \u22125.9 \u2212 (\u22126.5)=0.6 kcal mol \u22121 , \u0394G B WT = \u2212 3.5 \u2212 (\u22126.5)=3.0 kcal mol \u22121 , and \u0394G AB WT = \u22123.6 \u2212(\u22126.5)=2.9 kcal mol \u22121 . Thus, \u03b4 AB WT = 2.9 \u2212 (3.0 +0.6) = \u22120.7 kcal mol \u22121 reflecting a favorable pairwise coupling free energy and indicative of positive cooperativity of hydrogen bond formation (\u03b4 AB i <0) (see Table 2 ). Note that if \u03b4 AB i =0, then \u0394G AB i = \u0394G A i + \u0394G B i . In this case, formation of each hydrogen bond is additive or non-cooperative, and the loss of the A or B interaction is not influenced by the loss of the remaining interaction at site B or A, respectively. If \u03b4 AB i >0, the pairwise coupling is unfavorable and formation of both hydrogen bonds is non-additive. \u0394G A i , \u0394G B i , \u0394G AB i and \u03b4 AB WT and \u03b4 AB C27A values calculated in this way are compiled in Table 2 , as are the corresponding values obtained from a similar analysis of the closely related BWYV and dC14 BWYV pseudoknots published previously (20) . Interestingly, both \u03b4 AB WT and \u03b4 AB BWYV are significantly negative, indicative of positively cooperative formation of these two hydrogen bonds that straddle the helical junction. In contrast, \u03b4 AB C27A has a positive sign, indicative of non-additivity of hydrogen bond formation across the helical junction. This finding is consistent with the free energy cycles that yield \u03b4 AB C8+ and \u03b4 AB C8 (Fig. 7 , left and right). \u03b4 AB C8+ and \u03b4 AB C8 are equal to \u22120.8 and +0.8 kcal mol \u22121 , respectively (see Table 2 ), and reflects the extent to which perturbation of the H-bond donor (dC14) and acceptor (C27A) sides of the same C27 N3-C14 2\u2032-OH hydrogen bond, individually and in combination, is influenced by protonation of immediately adjacent C8. At low pH, this coupling is favorable (\u03b4 AB C8+ <0), i.e., the folding free energy of the double mutant is less negative then the sum of each of the underlying single mutants, with the opposite true at high pH in the deprotonated forms of the RNA (\u03b4 AB C8 >0). Finally, using the WT\u00b7H+ conformation as the reference state for the thermodynamic cube, and denoting \u0394G C WT as \u0394\u0394G protonated for the C27A vs. WT ScYLV RNAs and \u0394G ABC WT as \u0394\u0394G protonated for the dC14/C27A vs. WT RNAs (and \u0394G A WT and \u0394G B WT defined as above) one can also calculate the three-way coupling in this system, \u0394G 3 , according to: [10] where \u0394G 3 is equal to the folding free energy of the triple substitution mutant dC14/C27A RNA at high pH, \u0394G ABC WT , minus the sum of the folding free energies of the single mutants and each of the six pairwise couplings, \u03b4 AB i ( Table 2) . \u0394G 3 is \u22121.8 kcal mol \u22121 , which is indicative of a strong coupling network in the WT ScYLV RNA.\n\nThis coupling analysis is completely independent of pK a since the states selected were derived from \u0394G protonated and \u0394G deprotonated measured at low and high pH, respectively. To understand the effect of pH on the three pairwise couplings \u03b4 AB i (\u03b4 AB WT , \u03b4 AB C27A and \u03b4 AB BWYV ), the coupling scheme was modified to correct for the concentration of reference state molecules, i.e., WT\u00b7H + , C27A\u00b7H + or BYWV\u00b7H + , at each pH. Here, the equations change to [10] [11]\n\n[12] [13] for the binding model, allowing us to define a new term, \u03b4 AB i,eff (pH), the effective pairwise coupling as a function of pH, according to: [14] Exactly analogous expressions were derived for the linkage model (see eqs. 2-4), using pK a and parameters resolved from the linkage model fits (Table 1 , italicized parameters). Plots of \u03b4 AB i,eff as a function of pH are presented as simulated curves using parameters derived from the binding model (Fig. 8A) and linkage model (Fig. 8B ). As expected, at low pH, \u03b4 AB i,eff (pH) = \u03b4 AB i (from Table 2 ) for each RNA; this occurs as a result of taking the WT\u00b7H + , C27A\u00b7H + or BYWV\u00b7H + as the reference state in each case. In Fig. 8A , \u03b4 AB i,eff first goes more negative or favorable for the WT ScYLV (continuous line) and BWYV (dotted line) RNAs; the depth of this trough is essentially determined by the difference in binding pK a 's between the WT and dC14-containing RNAs, which is greater for the BWYV RNA (see Table  1 ) (20) . As the pH is further increased, \u03b4 AB i,eff becomes less negative and vanishes altogether at pH\u22658.0, fully expected since the concentration of protonated RNA molecules becomes very small at high pH. The situation is dramatically different for the C27A ScYLV RNA, where \u03b4 AB i,eff is positive or unfavorable at all pH values, until vanishing as expected at high pH (Fig.  8A, dashed line) . Roughly similar trends in the simulated curves are obtained with the linkage model-derived parameters (Fig. 8B) , except that there are no troughs since eq. [7] is monotonic, and \u03b4 AB i,eff vanishes at significantly higher pH values due to the higher pK a 's derived from this analysis (Table 1 ). Fig. 8C shows the results of plotting \u0394\u03b4 AB i,eff , defined as \u03b4 AB WT\u03b4 AB C27A , derived from the binding (solid line) and linkage (dashed line) model parameters compared to the experimental global \u0394\u0394G 37 measured as a function of pH (16) . This is a measure of the degree to which the relative differences in pairwise coupling free energies across the helical junction measured for the wild-type and C27A RNAs track with global differences in stability between the two RNAs. Although the trends in \u0394\u0394G 37 do not show a simple pH-dependence, the average value of \u0394\u0394G 37 (\u22121.1 \u00b10.3 kcal mol \u22121 , dashed line) is of the same sign and magnitude, and well within the simulated values of \u0394\u03b4 AB i,eff over the entire pH range, with \u0394\u03b4 AB i,eff more negative than \u0394\u0394G 37 at pH<7, and less negative at higher pH values. This is particularly so considering a conservative estimate of \u00b10.5 kcal mol \u22121 uncertainty in the experimental values of \u0394 \u03b4 eff i particularly at low pH (see Table 2 ). These data are therefore generally consistent with the idea that much of the global \u0394\u0394G 37 can be traced to an altered pairwise coupling of these two cross junction hydrogen bonds between functional (WT) and poorly functional (C27A) ScYLV RNA pseudoknots. This is fully consistent with the structures of these two RNAs (16, 23 ).\n\nIn this paper, we have determined the extent to which two key adjacent tertiary structural hydrogen bonds that cross the helical junction form cooperatively in three H-type RNA pseudoknots for which structures and frameshift stimulation activities (at pH 7.0) are known. The most striking finding from this study is that in the context of the two most conservative substitutions that can be introduced, i.e., the loss of the H-bond donor in each of the two hydrogen bonds (C14 2\u2032-OH to 2\u2032-H; C8 N3-H+ to N3) individually or in combination, the WT ScYLV (\u03b4 AB WT ) and WT BWYV (\u03b4 AB BWYV ) RNAs exhibit favorable pairwise coupling free energies (Table 2) indicative of cooperative hydrogen bond formation while the poorly functional C27A ScYLV RNA (\u03b4 AB C27A ) is characterized by an unfavorable coupling, or nonadditive hydrogen bond formation. This is the case despite the fact that the helical junction region of the C27A ScYLV RNA is more like that of the BWYV RNA relative to the wildtype ScYLV RNA (see Fig. 1 \n\nThis result reveals that the energetics of pairwise hydrogen bond coupling is not well predicted by the global structure alone, but it is instead strongly influenced by the context in which these interactions are made. An implicit assumption in any pairwise coupling experiment is that the structures of the molecule lacking one or both hydrogen bonds are essentially identical and all that is missing is the hydrogen bond itself and the energetic consequences that derive from deleting it. Since hydrogen bond strength is influenced by hydrogen bond geometry (length and angle), the extent to which formation of two hydrogen bonds is pairwise coupled could also be influenced by small structural differences among all four RNAs at low vs. high pH. Very high resolution structures of these RNAs under a variety of solution conditions would be required to address this. In fact, introduction of a single deoxyribose substitution in an otherwise all-RNA context may also perturb the sugar pucker from C3\u2032-endo (N-type) to C2\u2032endo (S-type) (32), albeit to varying degrees, which might indirectly influence the magnitude of hydrogen bond coupling by perturbing the local structure. However, this is clearly not the case here since NMR data clearly reveal that the dC14 sugar pucker adopts a C3\u2032-endo conformation, like C14 in the WT RNA (16) . 1 In general, the measured pairwise coupling free energy may not be direct and the presence or absence of specific interactions in the BWYV vs. C27A ScYLV RNAs may play a role in determining the magnitude and sign of the pairwise coupling free energy. One way to establish whether a measured pairwise coupling free energy is direct or indirect is to introduce a mutation or substitution into a third site and i be re-evaluated (31) . If the two values of \u03b4 AB i are not equal, then the AB pairwise coupling is indirect, thus providing evidence for a more complex network of thermodynamically coupled or cooperative interactions. In this regard, it is important to further consider the structural differences between the C27A ScYLV and BWYV RNAs. Comparison of Figs. 1C and 1D reveals that the helical junction of the C27A ScYLV RNA is more strongly over-rotated than the BWYV RNA, which results in poorer stacking of the two junction triple base pairs; this in turn, might influence the degree of pairwise coupling of junction hydrogen bonds in these two RNAs. However, this cannot be the sole reason for the different \u03b4 AB i since the WT ScYLV RNA is even more poorly stacked than in the C27A RNA (see Fig. 1B-C) .\n\nThe other structural difference between the BWYV and C27A ScYLV RNAs is that the ScYLV pseudoknot contains an extrahelical nucleotide, C25, which is not present in the BWYV RNA. The presence or absence of this nucleotide might influence the magnitude of \u03b4 AB i via a next nearest neighbor influence on the packing of A26 into the minor groove triplex, as well as the adjacent A24\u00b7(G6-C15) base triple; clearly, the integrity of the nucleotide analogous to A26 in the ScYLV pseudoknot is important for luteoviral pseudoknot stability (19, 20, 33) . Interestingly, deletion of C25 in ScYLV RNAs consistently increases frameshift stimulation by \u22482-fold in a variety of structural contexts; simultaneous deletion of C25 with one other L2 nucleotide increases frameshift-stimulation by the C27A RNA 3-fold, resulting in a functional activity indistinguishable from the wild-type BWYV RNA (16) . If the magnitude and sign of \u03b4 AB i track with frameshifting activity, this makes the prediction that the \u0394C25 and this BWYVlike ScYLV mutant would yield very different \u03b4 AB i relative to the C27A and WT ScYLV pseudoknots. These experiments are currently in progress.\n\nUpon encountering a programmed mRNA frameshift signal, the decoding ribosome is thought to pause and shift reading frames without dissociation, and continue decoding in the new reading frame. The pseudoknot has to be stable enough to resist mechanical unwinding by the elongating ribosome in a kinetically relevant rate, but not too stable as to induce dissociation 1 A NOESY spectrum (\u03c4 m =120 ms) acquired in D 2 O was used to assign the H1\u2032 (5.67 ppm), H2\u2032 (2.70 ppm), and H2\u2033 (3.36 ppm) protons of dC14. Only the sequential dC14 H2\u2032-C15 H6 NOE is clearly observed in this spectrum with the dC14 H2\u2033-C15 H6 NOE not readily detected. In addition, there are no detectable dC14 H1\u2032-H2\u2032 or H1\u2032-H2\u2033 correlations in the TOCSY spectrum under conditions where sugars with known C2\u2032 endo puckers give intense correlations, e.g., U19 (spectra not shown). All of these data are fully consistent with the conclusion that the dC14 sugar adopts a C3\u2032 endo conformation in the dC14 RNA.. of the translation elongation complex. In this way of thinking, the pseudoknot provides a kinetic barrier to ribosome-mediated unfolding (and/or refolding). The studies reported here extend our previous structural work on this system, and support the hypothesis that those helical junctions with favorable \u03b4 AB i may well resist ribosome-mediated resolution of the pseudoknot more effectively than those characterized by less favorable or unfavorable \u03b4 AB i since these would likely lower the kinetic barrier to ribosome-mediated unwinding. In this regard, it will be of interest to investigate hydrogen bond coupling throughout the molecule. For example, although deletion of the 2\u2032-OH protons of C15 or A16 riboses might be predicted to have a significant impact on global stability (20) , it would be of interest to determine how the magnitude of \u03b4 AB i is affected by deoxynucleotide substitutions further from the C8 + \u00b7(G12-C28) major groove base triple. This would provide insight into the cooperativity of the loopstem interactions in frameshifting RNAs. Finally, we note that the magnitude of the pairwise coupling as operationally defined here is dependent on pH, making the prediction that the efficiency of frameshifting induced by luteoviral pseudoknots might also be influenced by the pH. Experiments along these lines are currently in progress.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
