{"title": "Coupling to the surface of liposomes alters the immunogenicity of hepatitis C virus-derived peptides and confers sterile immunity", "body": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes persistent infections in more than half of infected patients which often lead to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [1] . Pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy, although beneficial in about half of treated patients, are expensive and associated with significant side effects [2] . In this clinical context there is an urgent need for the development of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic HCV vaccine [3] . It is well documented that major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted, CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a major role in the immune control of various virus infections. In the case of HCV infection, spontaneous resolution of acute HCV infection was associated with vigorous HCV-specific CTL responses in chimpanzees [4] and humans [5, 6] . Hence, HCV-specific CTLs are likely to be crucial to eradicate HCV.\n\nWe have previously demonstrated that antigens chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes consisting of unsaturated fatty acids were cross-presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs) to CTLs [7] . When we coupled liposomes to immunodominant CTL epitope peptides derived from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) they exhibited highly efficient antiviral responses in immunized mice [8] . Single immunization of as low as 280 ng of liposomal peptide along with CpG conferred complete protection to the immunized mice which was also effective against a highly virulent mutant strain, clone 13. In addition, a long-term memory induction was achieved in the absence of CD4 + T cell help. This form of CTL-based liposomal vaccine was also developed for SARS coronavirus [9] and influenza virus which was effective enough to protect mice from heterosubtypic influenza viruses [10] .\n\nPreviously, we have evaluated 24 HLA-A \u00c3 0201-restricted, HCV-derived epitopes by examining peptide-binding affinity for HLA-A \u00c3 0201 molecules, the stability of peptide-HLA-A \u00c3 0201 complexes, killing activities of CTLs and frequencies of intracellular interferon-gamma (IFN-c)-positive CD8 + T cells induced in mice immunized with HCV protein-expressing recombinant adenoviruses [11] . On the basis of those results, 24 peptides tested were classified into six groups. In this study, we chose 14 out of the 24 peptides from the five groups and coupled them as well as one murine MHC-restricted HCV CTL epitope peptide on the surfaces of liposomes. We also emulsified these peptides in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) and compared their immunogenicity by analyzing the cytolytic activity and the number of IFN-c-producing cells induced in the immunized mice. All of the liposomal peptides were tested for their protective efficacy by the challenge experiments.\n\nC57BL/6 mice were purchased from Tokyo Laboratory Animals Science Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). CD4 knockout (KO) mice on a C57BL/6 background were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Transgenic mice, HHD (a kind gift from Dr. F. A. Lemonnier, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France) express a transgenic HLA-A \u00c3 0201 monochain in which human beta-2 microglobulin (b2m) is covalently linked to a chimeric heavy chain composed of HLA-A \u00c3 0201 (a1 and a2, domains) and H-2D b (a3, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains) [12] . Six-to 12-week-old mice were used for all experiments. The mice were housed in appropriate animal care facilities at Saitama Medical University (Saitama, Japan), and handled according to international guidelines. Experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Research Committee of Saitama Medical School.\n\nA mouse lymphoma cell line EL-4 (H-2b) was obtained from the ATCC, and African green monkey-derived kidney cell lines CV-1 and BS-C-1 were provided by Dr. T. Shioda (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). These cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (D-10). A mouse lymphoma cell line transfected with the HHD gene, RMA-HHD (H-2b) [12] was maintained in D-10 containing G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at a final concentration of 500 lg/ml.\n\nThe peptides listed in Table 1 and a peptide HBVcore128-140 (TPPAYRPPNAPIL) [13] were synthesized by Operon Biotechnology (Tokyo, Japan). Synthetic CpG ODN (5002: TCCATGACGTTCTT-GATGTT) was purchased from Hokkaido System Science (Sapporo, Japan) and phoshorothioate protected to avoid nuclease-dependent degradation.\n\nOleoyl liposomes consisted of dioleoyl phosphatidyl choline, dioleoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine, dioleoyl phosphatidyl glycerol acid, and cholesterol in a 4:3:2:7 M ratio. Each peptide was coupled to the surface of liposomes via disuccinimidyl suberate as described previously [7] . The final preparations contained 0.7 mg or less of the peptide and 10 mg of the liposome per ml.\n\nGeneration of a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the HCV core (VV-core) was described [14] . Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the HCV C-E1 (VV-C-E1), E2 (VV-E2), NS3 (VV-NS3), NS4 (VV-NS4) or NS5 (VV-NS5) were generated as described [15] . In brief, the HCV C-E1, E2, NS3, NS4 and NS5 genes corresponding to amino acid residues 1-380, 381-810, 1027-1657, 1658-1972 and 1959-2872, respectively, were amplified from the plasmid pBRTM/HCV1-3011con which contains the entire DNA sequence derived from the HCV H77 clone [16] (kindly provided by Dr. Charles M. Rice, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY) by PCR and inserted into the transfer vector, pNZ68K2. Then, recombinant vaccinia viruses were generated by homologous recombination between wild-type vaccinia virus (VV-wt) (WR strain) and the transfer vector, purified in C143 cells, and propagated in CV1 cells.\n\nEach mouse was subcutaneously (s.c.) immunized with either a liposomal peptide of the indicated amount together with 5 lg of CpG in 50 ll of PBS, or a peptide (50 lg) emulsified in 250 ll of IFA with the peptide HBVcore128-140 (100 lg).\n\nCr-release assays were carried out as described [8] . In brief, spleen cells of immunized mice were cultured for seven days with irradiated (40 Gy) syngeneic naive spleen cells pre-pulsed with 10 lM of a relevant peptide, and employed as effector cells in standard 51 Cr-release assays. Target cells were pulsed with or without 10 lM of each peptide for 2 h, and then labeled with Na 51 2 CrO 4 for 1 h. The labeled target cells were plated with effector cells at an effector to target (E/T) ratio of 100. After a 4-h incubation, the radioactivity of the supernatant was counted. Percent lysis was calculated as [(cpm sample \u00c0cpm spontaneous )/(cpm maximum \u00c0cpm spontaneous )] \u00c2 100. Maximum 51 Cr release was determined from supernatants of cells that were lysed by addition of 2% Nonidet P-40. Spontaneous release was measured in supernatants from target cells incubated without effector cells. Percent specific lysis was calculated by subtracting the percent lysis with unpulsed targets from that with peptide-pulsed targets.\n\nDetection of IFN-c secreting cells was performed by using a mouse IFN-c enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) set (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) as described [8] . Abbreviations: NA, not applicable. a Classification of HCV-derived CTL epitopes determined in our previous study [11] . Type I: High or medium in the affinity, high or medium in the lysis, and high or medium in the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for IFN-c. Type II: High or medium in the affinity, high or medium in the lysis, and low or ND in the ICS. Type III: Low in the affinity, and high in the lysis. Type IV: High in the affinity, low or ND in the lysis, and medium in the ICS. Type V: High or medium in the affinity, low or ND in the lysis, and low or ND in the ICS. Type VI: Low in the affinity, ND in the lysis and ICS. ND, not detected.\n\nAfter immunization, mice were challenged i.p. with 2 \u00c2 10 6 pfu of VV-core, VV-NS3, or VV-NS4, and five days later, mice were sacrificed, and the titer of the homogenate of two ovaries from each mouse was determined on BS-C-1 cells as described [14] . All titrations were performed in duplicates, and the average PFU per mouse was calculated.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed with Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nWe observed that a murine MHC (D b )-restricted HCV CTL epitope 603 [17] showed much higher immunogenicity than human HLA-A \u00c3 0201-restricted HCV CTL epitopes in (C57BL/6 \u00c2 HHD) F1 mice when they were infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing HCV NS3 (unpublished data). Therefore, at first, we chose peptide 603 and made two vaccines: a surface-linked liposomal peptide (Lip-603) and a peptide emulsified in IFA with a MHC class II pan T helper peptide, HBVcore128-140 [13] (P-603). The immunogenicities of these two forms of peptide 603 were compared by analyzing spleen cells from the immunized mice for their cytotoxicity and IFN-c production by 51 Cr-realse assays (Fig. 1A) and ELISPOT assays (Fig. 1B) , respectively. We noticed that Lip-603 induced significant and higher responses in both assays than P-603.\n\nWhen the immunized mice were challenged by a recombinant vaccinia virus, VV-NS3, only Lip-603 was found to induce sterilizing immunity to mice whereas P-603 did not show significant effects (Fig. 1C) . The sterilizing immunity conferred by Lip-603 could be observed even at 12 weeks after immunization (Fig. 1D ) and long-term memory was confirmed by strong recall responses observed at 12 weeks postimmunization by ELISPOT (IFN-c) assays (Fig. S1 ). Memory induction by Lip-603 was also observed in CD4 KO mice (Fig. 1D) suggesting that it was carried out without CD4 + T cell help as had previously been shown for liposomal LCMV GP33 (Lip-GP33) [8] and ovalbumin257-276 [18] peptides. The dose-response ELISPOT (IFN-c) assay revealed that as low as 56 ng of Lip-603 could induce significant IFN-c responses (Fig. 1E ). This highly efficient induction of IFN-c-producing cells by Lip-603 was very similar to that observed for Lip-GP33 [8] .\n\nAmong 24 HLA-A \u00c3 0201-restricted HCV CTL epitope peptides which had been characterized for their immunogenicity and classified into six groups in our previous study [11] , 14 peptides (A2-1 to A2-14) ( Table 1) were chosen and coupled to the surfaces of liposomes (Lip-A2-1 to Lip-A2-14) or emulsified in IFA (P-A2-1 to P-A2-14). We immunized (s.c.) HHD mouse with each peptide twice, and one week after the second immunization, spleen cells were tested by 51 Cr-realse assays ( Fig. 2A) and ELISPOT assays (Fig. 2B) . The type of each peptide (I-V, Table 1 ) determined by the immunogenicity in mice that endogenously expressed HCV proteins during infection with recombinant adenoviruses [11] is shown in Fig. 2 for comparison. Considerable variability in the immunogenicity was observed between the peptides and also be-tween the modes of antigen delivery. The accordance of the three assay results for each peptide was observed only for A2-1, A2-3, and A2-14 ( Fig. 2A and B) .\n\nInduction of anti-viral activity was tested for all of the 14 liposomal peptides by challenge experiments with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing corresponding epitopes. Among them, only Lip-A2-8, Lip-A2-11, and Lip-A2-12 exhibited complete protection that was reproducible in at least three independent experiments. The others showed insignificant, partial, or nonreproducible protection (Fig. 2C) . Notably, all of the three liposomal peptides that conferred perfect protection, L-A2-8, L-A2-11 and L-A2-12, belonged to the highest inducers of IFN-c against CD8 + T cells (Fig. 2B) . Lip-A2-5, which induced high cytolytic activity but poor IFN-c responses by CD8 + T cells, showed only partial and non-reproducible protection.\n\nLip-A2-8, Lip-A2-11 and Lip-A2-12, which showed excellent anti-viral effector CD8 + T cell induction, were also analyzed for the ability of long-term memory induction. The memory at 12 weeks postimmunization induced by the three strong inducer of IFN-c completely protected mice from VV-NS3 or VV-NS4 challenge, while the poor inducer of IFN-c, Lip-A2-5, did not exhibit significant titer reductions against VV-E2 (Fig. 3A) . The memory induction was confirmed by recall responses by ELISPOT (IFN-c) assays (Fig. 3B) , which correlated well with the results of the challenge experiments (Fig. 3A ).\n\nIn this report, we demonstrate that HCV-derived antigenic peptides coupled to the surface of liposomes serve as efficient vaccine vehicles for the induction of anti-viral immunity mediated by CD8 + T cells as had previously been shown for LCMV-derived peptide GP33 [8] . Immunization with Lip-603 induced significant levels of cytotoxicity and IFN-c-producing cells and sterile immunity in the immunized mice ( Fig. 1A-C) . The dose-response ELISPOT assays revealed that Lip-603 could induce significant responses at less than 56 ng of the peptide (Fig. 1E) which was similar to that observed for Lip-GP33 [8] . Long-term memory induction was also confirmed at 12 weeks after immunization, and it seemed to be independent of CD4 + T cell help (Fig. 1D, Fig. S1 ).\n\nHowever, this study showed clearly that both the qualitative and quantitative immune responses induced by peptides coupled on the surface of liposomes may differ from that of the same peptides emulsified with a MHC class II pan T helper peptide in IFA. P-603 induced lower responses in 51 Cr-release (Fig. 1A) and ELISPOT assays (Fig. 1B) compared to Lip-603, and did not show significant protection in the challenge experiments (Fig. 1C) . HLA-A \u00c3 0201-restricted HCV epitope peptides also showed considerable differences in immunogenicity between the liposomal and emulsion forms ( Fig. 2A and B) . A2-5 peptide in IFA induced both cytolytic and IFN-c responses whereas the same peptide on the surface of liposomes predominantly induced cytolytic activity. On the other hand, A2-11 and A2-12 showed opposite results: P-A2-11 and P-A2-12 mainly induced cytolytic responses, and L-A2-11 and L-A2-12 induced strong IFN-c responses rather than cytolytic responses. A2-8 on liposomes showed strong responses in both assays whereas that in IFA induced only cytolytic responses. A2-7 was found to be a strong inducer of cytolytic activity when emulsified in IFA, but on the surface of liposomes, induced neither cytolytic nor IFN-c responses.\n\nWhen these HLA-A \u00c3 0201-restricted HCV epitope peptides on the surface of liposomes were tested for their efficacy to induce protection against virus challenges, only A2-8, A2-11, and A2-12 exhibited perfect and reproducible protection (Fig. 2C) . Interestingly, these three liposomal peptides were the strongest inducer of IFN-c responses (Fig. 2B) . In contrast, Lip-A2-5 was found to induce only non-reproducible protection with a titer reduction of less than two logs although it was a strong inducer of cytolytic activity. These lines of evidence suggest that the anti-viral activity induced by liposomal peptides is mediated by non-cytolytic mechanisms related to IFN-c responses. Similar observations were obtained in our previous study [8] . LCMV-derived D b -restricted epitope peptide NP396, on the liposomes, induced strong IFN-c responses but no cytolytic responses, and the mice were highly protected against LCMV challenge. Both LCMV and HCV have been reported to be susceptible to non-cytolytic anti-viral mechanisms [19] [20] [21] . Taken together, the peptides on the surface of liposomes may have an advantage in application for therapeutic use in that virus-infected cells may be eliminated without tissue damages. Further studies are needed to clarify this issue.\n\nWe speculate that the mechanisms underlying the induction of different immunogenicities of the peptides by coupling to the sur-face of liposomes are associated with the differences in the antigen presentation mechanisms. Peptides emulsified in IFA are thought to fit into the pockets of MHC class I molecules on APCs replacing the original endogenously synthesized peptides and presented to CD8 + T cells [22] . On the other hand, we have shown that antigens chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes consisting of unsaturated fatty acids (oleoyl liposomes) are cross-presented by APCs [7] . Our further study has shown that oleoyl liposomes might be taken up by APCs via at least two pathways: fusion with and penetration of plasma membranes, and pinocytosis [23] . These unique antigen presentation mechanisms may be responsible for the unique immunogenicity and anti-viral potency of the peptide antigens. The 14 HLA-A \u00c3 0201-restricted epitope peptides have been characterized for their immunogenicity in our previous study by analyzing the immune responses of mice immunized with recombinant adenoviruses that expressed HCV proteins [11] . The immunogenicity profiles in response to the adenovirus-vectored c-producing cells responding to a relevant peptide were detected by ELISPOT assays. The group number (I-V) in which each epitope was classified in our previous study [11] ( Table 1) immunization were quite different from any of those obtained from the two types of peptide vaccinations ( Fig. 2A and B) . In adenovirus vaccination, the peptides were endogenously synthesized and presented by MHC class I molecules on virus-infected cells. Therefore, the immunogenicity profile induced by this third antigen presentation mechanism may also support our hypothesis that these different immunization systems result in different antigen presentations and therefore different immune responses.\n\nIn conclusion, coupling peptide antigens on the surface of liposomes consisting of unsaturated fatty acids seems to give rise to unique immune response profiles to peptides. HCV peptide/liposomes may be useful as prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. "}
