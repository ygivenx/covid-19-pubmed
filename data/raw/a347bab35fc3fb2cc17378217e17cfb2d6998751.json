{"title": "Principles of Soil and Plant Water Relations", "body": "C H A P T E R Introduction 1.1 WHY STUDY SOILePLANTeWATER RELATIONS?\n\nOf the four soil physical factors that affect plant growth (mechanical impedance, water, aeration, and temperature) (Shaw, 1952; Kirkham, 1973) , water is the most important. A classic analysis was done by Boyer (1982) to determine the reasons for crop losses over a four-decade period in the United States. He found that drought causes 40.8% of crop losses and excess water causes 16.4%. Insects and diseases amount to 7.2% of the losses. Thus, soils that are too dry or too wet are the major reasons for lost productivity.\n\nPeople depend upon plants for food. Because water is the major environmental factor limiting plant growth, we need to study soile plantewater relations to provide food for a growing population. What is our challenge?\n\nThe earth's population is growing exponentially. The universe is now considered to be 13,000,000,000 (13 thousand millions or 13 billion) years old (Zimmer, 2001) . The earth is thought to be 4.45 billion years old (All\u00e8gre and Schneider, 1994) . The earth's oldest rock is 4.03 billion years old (Zimmer, 2001) . Primitive life existed on earth 3.7 billion years ago, according to scientists studying ancient rock formations harboring living cells (Simpson, 2003) . Human-like animals have existed on earth only in the last few (less than 8) million years. In Chad, Central Africa, six hominid specimens, including a nearly complete cranium and fragmentary lower jaws, have been found that are 6e7 million years old (Brunet et al., 2002; Wood, 2002) . The earliest fossil in Europe, which belongs to the genus Homo, was found in Spain and has been dated to 1.1e1.2 million years ago, which suggests that the first settlement of Western Europe was related to demographic expansion out of Africa (Carbonell et al., 2008 ). 4,469,934,000. In 1985 , it was 4.9 billion and in 1987 it was 5.0 billion (New York Times, 1987 . In 1999, the world's population reached 6 billion (National Geographic, 1999) . On October 31, 2011, the United Nations Population Fund estimated that the seventh billion person was born in the world (McGurn, 2011) .\n\nNote that it took more than six million years for humans to reach the first billion; 120 years to reach the second billion; 32 years to reach the third billion; and 15 years to reach the fourth billion (New York Times, 1980) . It took 12 years to add the fifth to sixth billion (1987e1999), and 12 years to add the next billion (sixth to seventh billion; 1999e2011). The population is projected to reach 9.3 billion by 2050 (Chin et al., 2011) . If fertility rates drop until women have about two children each, the population will stabilize at 10.8 billion (National Geographic, 1998b) .\n\nThe population may also fall due to plagues (Weiss, 2002) , such as the one that devastated Europe in the fourteenth century. Current potential plagues may result from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, thought to be caused by a virus; influenza, another viral infectiondfor example, there may be a recurrence of the 1918 pandemic (Gladwell, 1997); sudden acute respiratory syndrome, a deadly infectious disease caused by a coronavirus (Lemonick and Park, 2003) ; hospital infections, which cannot be treated with any known antibiotics; and mad-cow disease, which is formally called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). BSE is called Creutzfeldt-Jakob (also spelled as Creutzfeldt-Jacob) disease, when it occurs in humans (Hueston and Voss, 2000) . It is thought to be caused by prions, which were discovered by Stanley Prusiner (born in 1942), director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases at the University of California, San Francisco (the discovery won Prusiner both the Wolf Prize (1996) and the Nobel Prize (1997) in medicine). Prions are a new class of protein, which, in an altered state, can be pathogenic and cause important neurodegenerative diseases by inducing changes in protein structure. Prions are designed to protect the brain from the oxidizing properties of chemicals activated by dangerous agents such as ultraviolet light.\n\nThe population is limited by the productivity of the land. There is a space limitation that our population is up against. Many of us already have heard of this limitation, which is a space of two square yards per person. The sun's energy that falls on two square yards is the minimum required to provide enough energy for a human being's daily ration. Ultimately, our food and our life come from the sun's energy. The falling of the sun's energy on soil and plants is basic. We want to make as many plants grow on those two square yards per person as possible, to make sure we have enough to eat.\n\nLet us do a simple calculation to determine how much food can be produced from two square yards, using the following steps:\n\n1. Two square yards is 3 ft by 6 ft or 91 cm by 183 cm. 91 cm \u00c2 183 cm \u00bc 16; 653 cm 2 or; rounding; 16; 700 cm 2 :\n\n2. The solar constant is 2.00 cal/cm 2 /min, or, because one langley \u00bc 1 cal/cm 2 , it is 2.00 langleys/min. The langley is named after Samuel Pierpoint Langley (1834e1906), who was a US astronomer and physicist who studied the sun. He was a pioneer in aviation.\n\nThe solar constant is defined as the rate at which energy is received upon a unit surface, perpendicular to the sun's direction in free space at the earth's mean distance from the sun (latitude is not important) (Johnson, 1954) . The brightness of the sun varies during the 11-year solar cycle, but typically by less than 0.1% (Lockwood et al., 1992) . 3. 16,700 cm 2 \u00c2 2.00 cal/cm 2 /min \u00bc 33,400 cal/min. 4. 33,400 cal/min \u00c2 60 min/h \u00c2 12 h/day \u00bc 24,048,000 cal/day, or, rounding, 24,000,000 cal/day. We multiply by 12 h/day, because we assume that the sun shines 12 h/day. Of course, the length the sun shines each day depends on the day of the year, cloudiness, and location. 5. There is 6% conversion of absorbed solar energy into chemical energy in plants (Kok, 1967) . This 6% is for the best crop yields achieved; 20% (Kok, 1967) to 30% (Kok, 1976) conversion is thought possible, but it has not been achieved; 2% is the conversion for normal yields; and under natural conditions, 1% is converted (Kok, 1976) . The solar energy reaching the earth's surface that plants do not capture to support life is wasted as heat (Kok, 1976) . Let us assume a 6% conversion: 24; 000; 000 cal=day \u00c2 0:06 \u00bc 1; 440; 000 cal=day:\n\n6. The food \"calories\" we see listed in calorie charts are in kilocalories. So, dividing 1,440,000 cal/day by 1000, we get 1440 kcal/day, which is not very much.\n\nWe recognize that the earlier calculation of productivity from two square yards is simplified, and more complex and thorough calculations of productivity, which consider geographic location, sky conditions, leaf display, and other factors, have been carried out (e.g., De Wit, 1967). Nevertheless, the 1400 kcal/day is a useful number to know. It would be a starvation diet. One could live on it, but the calories probably would not provide enough for active physical work, creative intellectual activity, and reproduction. Women below a minimum weight cannot reproduce (Frisch, 1988) . Civilization would advance slowly with this daily ration. People begin to die of starvation when they lose roughly a third of their normal body weight. When the loss reaches 40%, death is almost inevitable.\n\nTriage is a system developed during World War I. It is the medical practice of dividing the wounded into survival categories to concentrate medical resources on those who could truly benefit from them and to ignore those who would die, even with treatment, or survive even without it. This practice has been advocated to allocate scarce food supplies. If we can grow more food, then this system does not need to be put into effect. In this book, we seek a better understanding of movement of water through the soileplanteatmosphere continuum, or SPAC (Philip, 1966) , because of the prime importance of water in plant growth.\n\nWe focus on principles rather than review the literature. Many references are given, but no attempt is made to cite the most recent papers. Articles explaining the principles are cited. They often are in the older literature, but we need to know them to learn the principles. No knowledge of calculus is required to understand the equations presented.\n\nIn this book, we divide the movement of water through the SPAC into three parts: (1) water movement in the soil and to the plant root; (2) water movement through the plant, from the root to the stem to the leaf; and (3) water movement from the plant into the atmosphere. We then combine all parts when we look at electrical analogues for water movement through the soileplanteatmosphere continuum (Chapter 22). However, before we turn to principles of water movement in the SPAC, let us first consider plant growth curves.\n\nThe world population growth curve (Figure 1.1) is an exponential curve. What do plant growth curves look like? Because water is the most important soil physical factor affecting plant growth, it is important to quantify plant growth to determine effects of water stress. In any experiment dealing with plantewater relations, some measure of plant growth (e.g., height, leaf area, biomass) should be obtained. Plant growth curves also exemplify quantitative relationships that we seek to understand basic principles of plantewater relations. If we can develop equations to show relationships, then we can predict what is going to happen. Equations describing plantegrowth curves demonstrate how we can quantify, and thus predict, plant growth.\n\nWe first consider the growth of the bacterium Escherichia coli. In the early nineteenth century, when plants and animals were being classified, the bacteria were arbitrarily included in the plant kingdom, and botanists first studied them (Stanier et al., 1963; pp. 55e56) . Even though bacteria are not plants or animals, we can follow their growth to understand plant growth curves.\n\nUnder ideal conditions, a cell of E. coli divides into two cells approximately every 20 min; for the sake of simplicity we assume that it is exactly 20 min. Let us consider the propagation of a single cell. Our purpose is to find a relation between the number N of cells at some moment in the future and the time t that has elapsed. At the start of our observations, at the time 0 min, there is one cell. When 20 min have elapsed there are two cells. When 40 min have elapsed there are 2 \u00c2 2 \u00bc 2 2 cells. When 60 min have elapsed there are 2 \u00c2 2 2 \u00bc 2 3 cells; that is, when three time intervals of 20 min each have passed, there are 2 3 cells. We observe a pattern developing: when m time intervals each of 20 min have passed, at the time t \u00bc 20m min, there are 2 m \u00bc 2 t/20 cells. Thus, if N denotes the number of cells present at the moment when t minutes have elapsed, then the relation we seek is given by the equation\n\n(1.1)\n\nBecause the time t appears in the exponent of the expression 2 t/20 , this equation is said to describe exponential growth of the number N of cells (De Sapio, 1978, pp. 21e23) .\n\nA famous book called On Growth and Form by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson contains the following statement (Thompson, 1959; vol. 1, p. 144) : \"Linnaeus shewed that an annual plant would have a million offspring in twenty years, if only two seeds grew up to maturity in a year.\" Linnaeus is, of course, Carolus Linnaeus (born Karl von Linn\u00e9) (1707e1778), the great Swedish botanist. We can show that what Linnaeus said is true by adapting the preceding equation, as follows:\n\nwhere X is the number of offspring from the plant in 20 years.\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to use logarithms. John Napier (1550e1617), a distinguished Scottish mathematician, was the inventor of logarithms. (See the Appendix, Section 1.3, for his biography.) To solve equations using logarithms, we need to know the fundamental laws of logarithms, which are as follows (Ayres, 1958, p. 83 ):\n\n1. The logarithm of the product of two or more positive numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the several numbers. For example,\n\nThe logarithm of the quotient of two positive numbers is equal to the logarithm of the dividend minus the logarithm of the divisor. For example, In calculus, the most useful system of logarithms is the natural system in which the base is a certain irrational number e \u00bc 2.71828, approximately (Ayres, 1958, p. 86) . The natural logarithm of N, ln N, and the common logarithm of N, log N, are related by the formula ln N \u00bc 2:3026 log N:\n\n(1.7)\n\nTo solve our equation, we take the logarithm of each side: log \u00c0 2 20 \u00c1 \u00bc log X \n\nThe S-shaped, or sigmoid, curve is typical of the growth pattern of individual organs, or a whole plant, and of populations of plants (Figure 1.2) . It can be shown to consist of at least five distinct phases: (1) an initial lag period during which internal changes occur that are preparatory to growth; (2) a phase of ever-increasing rate of growth; (because the logarithm of growth rate, when plotted against time, gives a straight line during this period, this phase is frequently referred to as the log period of growth or \"the grand period of growth\"); (3) a phase in 1.2 PLANT GROWTH CURVES which growth rate gradually diminishes; and (4) a point at which the organism reaches maturity and growth ceases. If the curve is prolonged further, a time will arrive when (5) senescence and death of the organism set in, giving rise to another component of the growth curve (Mitchell, 1970, p. 95 ).\n\nSince about 1900, people have used growth curves to analyze growth. Significant relationships of a mathematical nature, however, are difficult to apply to such a complex thing as growth (Hammond and Kirkham, 1949) . One well-known theory of plant growth is the compound interest law of Blackman (1919) . He related plant growth to money in a bank. When money accumulates at compound interest, the final amount reached depends on:\n\n1. The capital originally used; 2. The rate of interest; and 3. The time during which the money accumulates.\n\nComparing these factors to plants 1 \u00bc the weight of the seed; 2 \u00bc the rate at which the seed material is used to produce new material; 3 \u00bc the time during which the plant increases in weight. Blackman related the three factors into one exponential equation,\n\n(1.8)\n\nwhere W 1 \u00bc the final weight W 0 \u00bc the initial weight r \u00bc the rate of interest t \u00bc time e \u00bc the base of natural logarithms (2.718.). (1970, p. 95) . Reprinted by permission of Roger L. Mitchell.\n\nThe Blackman equation works best for early phases of growth (the log phase of growth in the sigmoid growth curve). In the later growth stages, the decreasing relative growth rate has appeared to make impossible the application of this theory to the entire growth curve. Blackman attempted to do this, nevertheless, by using the average of all the different relative growth rate values as the r term in Eqn (1.8) . He called this term the \"efficiency index\" of plant growth.\n\nHammond and Kirkham found that the growth curves (dry weight versus time) of soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and corn (Zea mays L.) were characterized by a series of exponential segments, which were related to the growth stages of the plants. The exponential equation for all segments had the form:\n\n(1.9)\n\nwhere w \u00bc weight of the plant at time t w o \u00bc weight of the plant at an arbitrary time t o r \u00bc relative growth rate e \u00bc base of natural logarithms (2.718.).\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of each side, we get\n\nConverting to common logarithms by dividing each term by 2.303, we get log w \u00bc log w o \u00fe \u00bdr\u00f0t \u00c0 t o \u00de=2:303:\n\nWe get y \u00bc a \u00fe bx, which is the equation of a straight line. The differential form of Eqn (1.9), w \u00bc w o e r\u00f0t\u00c0t o \u00de ; is\n\nwhere r, the relative growth rate, is the increase in weight per unit weight per unit time. It is obtained by multiplying the slope, b, of the line by 2.303. Hammond and Kirkham (1949) plotted the common logarithm of dry weight versus time and found that soybeans have three growth stages, I, II, and III. The analysis showed that the plants produce dry matter at the greatest relative rate during period I; at a smaller rate during period II; and at a still smaller rate during period III. That is, the slopes declined with age (slope \u00bc r/2.303). They saw that the dates of change in the growth curves from period I to period II were also the dates when the plants began to bloom. The dates of the second change in the growth curve, or the change from period II to period III, were the dates when the plants reached maximum height. The soybeans grew on two different soils, Clarion loam and Webster silt loam. The soybean plants in the Clarion soil bloomed and reached maximum height about a week earlier than the soybeans on the Webster silt loam soil. The growth curves clearly showed this difference (Figure 1.3) . Growth curves, therefore, can be used to see the effect of the soil environment on plant growth. Hammond and Kirkham (1949) did not give a reason for the difference in rate of growth on the Webster and Clarion soils, but it probably was related to one of the four soil physical factors that affect plant growth: water, temperature, aeration, or mechanical impedance. For corn, they found four periods of growth (Figure 1.4) . The additional period in corn apparently was related to the difference in time of appearance of male and female flowers in corn. The physiological changes associated with the breaks in the curves were connected with tasseling, silking, and cessation of vegetative growth. The last break occurred after the corn plants had reached maximum height. In sum, the data for soybeans and corn showed that a quantitative analysis FIGURE 1.3 Logarithmic dry matter accumulation curves of soybeans grown in the field in Iowa on Webster and Clarion soils. From Hammond and Kirkham (1949) . American Society of Agronomy, Madison, Wisconsin. Reprinted by permission of the American Society of Agronomy.\n\nof the complete growth curve can be accomplished if the overall growth is partitioned into segments based on the growth stages of the plants.\n\nThe equations for plant growth show that we can develop significant mathematical relationships for a quantitative analysis of plant growth. This is probably because plant growth is governed by basic chemical and physical laws. From these relationships, we can predict plant growth.\n\nJohn Napier (1550e1617), a distinguished Scottish mathematician, was the inventor of logarithms. The son of Scottish nobility, Napier's life was spent amid bitter religious dissensions. He was a passionate Protestant. His great work, A Plaine Discouery of the Whole Reuelation of Saint John (1594), has a prominent place in Scottish ecclesiastical history as the earliest Scottish work on the interpretation of the scriptures. He then occupied himself by inventing instruments of war, including two kinds of burning mirrors, a piece of artillery, and a metal chariot from which a shot could be discharged through small holes. Napier devoted most of his leisure to the study of mathematics, particularly to developing methods of facilitating computation. His name is associated with his greatest method, logarithms. His contributions to this mathematical invention are FIGURE 1.4 Logarithmic dry matter accumulation curves of Iowa 939 corn in 1938 and 1939 . From Hammond and Kirkham (1949 .

Although Napier's invention of logarithms overshadows all his other mathematical work, he has other mathematical contributions to his credit. In 1617, he published his Rabdologiae, seu numerationis per virgulas libri duo (English translation, 1667). In this work, he describes ingenious methods of performing the fundamental operations of multiplication and division with small rods (Napier's bones). He also made important contributions to spherical trigonometry (Scott, 1971 )."}
