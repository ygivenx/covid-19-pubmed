{"title": "", "body": "Amino-peptidase N (APN/CD13; EC 3.4.11.2) is a zinc-dependent metalloproteinase that cleaves neutral or basic amino acids from the N-terminus of oligopeptides. Scientist found that outside the hematopoietic system, APN was widely expressed on various kinds of cells. For example, epithelial cells of the intestine and kidney, hepatocytes, osteoclasts, endometrial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, bone marrow stromal cells and on neuronal synaptic membranes. APN is involved in many physiology and pathology processes such as hydrolysis of nutrients, inactivation of bioactive peptides, binding of corona viruses, mediating cytomegalovirus infection and antigen presentation. Furthermore, APN has been a target for anti-tumor agents due to its important functions in ECM degradation, tumor cells invasion and tumor angiogenesis. [1] [2] [3] In the past two decades, several APN inhibitors have been found. For example, Bestatin, Probestin, Amastatin, Actinonin, Phebestin, Lapstatin, AHPA-Val, Leuhistin, Curcumin and Pasmmaplin A. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Among them, bestatin has been launched and is now widely employed clinically as an anti-tumor agent. 14 In 2006, the 3D structure of APN has been studied according to the co-crystal complex of APN and bestatin by Kiyoshi. 15 Our group has studied the binding site and catalytic domain of APN based on this co-crys-tal complex. The binding sites of APN with bestatin can be divided to three parts. Part 1 is a hydrophobic pocket (S 1 ); part 2 is the zinc binding group (ZBG); part 3 is another hydrophobic pocket in the other side (S 0 1 ). With the help of computer-aided molecular design, in 2008, our group designed and synthesized a series of L-lysine derivatives and found that some compounds exhibited potential APN inhibitory activities 16 (Fig. 1) . Also in 2008, the crystal structures of Escherichia coli amino-peptidase N (e PepN) in complex with L-arginine, L-lysine, L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine and L-tryptophan have been determined to understand the structural basis for APN's hydrolysis pattern. The result showed that all these amino acids bind with their backbone atoms close to the active-site zinc ion and their side chain occupying the S 1 pocket of e PepN. And the specificity of the S 1 -binding pocket suggest that the preferred amino acid is, in decreasing order, arginine, lysine, tyrosine and phenylalanine. 17 Additionally, arginine is similar with lysine in structure except the guanidinium group and the longer carbon chain. According to the former reasons, we choose L-arginine as the starting material in order to get more efficient and potential APN inhibitors. The compounds designed are showed in Figure 1 .\n\nAll the target compounds were designed and synthesized via the route shown in Scheme 1. The guanidinium group of 0968-0896/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.bmc.2009.04.056 compound 1 was protected by nitro group to get compound 2. Compound 2 was then esterificated with methanol under HCl atmosphere to get compound 3. The acylation of compound 3 with acyl chloride, carboxylic acid or sulfochloride led to compounds 4a-w, 6a,b. Finally the ester groups of 4a-w, 6a,b were treated with NHOK in anhydrous methanol to get the target compounds 5a-w, 7a,b.\n\nAll the inhibition results were listed in Table 1 . Similar to APN, MMP-2 is also a zinc-dependant metalloproteinase that involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. Thus the assay was performed on both of APN and MMP-2 so as to identify the compounds selectivity. Bestatin was used as the positive control.\n\nAlmost all the compounds except 5a, 5c, 5i, 5v and 7b showed better activities against APN than MMP-2. For example, 5q with an IC 50 (MMP-2)/ IC 50 (APN) ratio equals to 65.8, while 5s equals to 46.3. The result, to a certain extent, confirmed our strategy for designing APN inhibitors. This possibly descript from the differences between the structures of two enzymes, leading to different requirements for their respective inhibitors. APN is a membranebound zinc exopeptidase that catalyzed the removal of NH 2 -terminal amino acid from the peptide, while MMP-2 is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase that could cut the peptide to parts from the specific amino acid residue of the peptide. The former L-lysine derivatives and 3-phenylpropane-1, 2-diamine derivatives designed by our group to inhibit APN all showed better activities against MMP-2. 16, 18 So L-arginine derivatives are more suitable for APN inhibitors.\n\nComparing 5a-d and 5e-w, we could find that the compounds contained substituted phenyl groups have better activities than those contained unsubstituted phenyl groups.\n\nAmong compounds 5e-w, we can conclude that the compounds contained two substituted groups on phenyl group have more potent activities than others. The most active compounds 5q and 5s both contain bi-substituted phenyl group. It is worth mentioning that the 2,4-dichlorobenzyl moiety of 5q was also effective in the precious L-lysine derivatives. 16 The possible reason might be that the 2,4-dichloro substituted benzene ring could accommodate the hydrophobic site of APN suitably, suggesting it is a potential moiety for APN inhibitors.\n\nFrom compounds 7a,b, we could confirm that the compounds contained sulfonyl groups showed equal activities against APN and MMP-2. That coincides with the fact that some sulfonyl groups containing compounds our group had synthesized before showed better MMP-2 inhibitory activities. 19, 20 The most active compounds are 5q and 5s (IC 50 = 5.3 and 5.1 lM), which have comparable activity with bestatin (IC 50 = 3.8 lM). 5o, 5t and 5l also have considerable activities (IC 50 = 15.9, 14.6 and 16.5 lM, respectively).\n\nIn order to investigate the interaction of our compounds with APN, the most active compound 5s was constructed with Sybyl/ Sketch module and optimized using Powell's method with the Tripos force field with convergence criterion set at 0.05 kcal/(\u00c5 mol), and assigned with Gasteiger-H\u00dcckel method. performed using Sybyl/FlexX module, the residues in a radius of 7.0 \u00c5 around Bestatin in the co-crystal structure (PDB code: 2DQM) were selected as the active site. Other docking parameters implied in the program were kept default. From Figure 2 , we can see the backbone of 5s inserted to S 1 pocket, the hydroxymate of 5s interacted with the zinc ion of APN and the 4-bromo-3-nitro benzamide side chain extended to S 0 1 pocket. For a further and detail understanding of the binding mode of 5s with APN, a 2D picture was also created with the program LIGPLOT. In Figure 3 , we can see the backbone of 5s could form hydrophobic contacts with Glu 121 , Met 260 and Tyr 376 of S 1 pocket and form hydrogen bond with Glu 121 by the imine of guanidinium group. The two oxygen atoms of hydroxymate chelated with the zinc ion of APN. The carbonyl of amide in R position could form hydrogen bond with Gly 261 and Ala 262 of S 0 1 pocket. The R substituted side chain of 5s could form hydrophobic contact with Gly 261 of S 0 1 pocket. While, the nitro group at the aromatic ring could form hydrogen bonds with Arg 783 and Arg 825 .\n\nAlthough the computed information partially supported our assumption, the exact binding mode of the L-arginine derivatives with APN should be obtained from further X-ray crystal studies.\n\nIn all, we have synthesized a new series of L-aginine derivatives as APN inhibitors. Most of the compounds showed potent activity and selectivity against APN, in which 5q and 5s were comparable to bestatin and could be used as lead compounds for the develop- ment of future low molecular-weight peptidomimetic APN inhibitors as anticancer agents.\n\nAll the material were commercial available.
