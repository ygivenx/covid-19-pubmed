If the repeat Ct was undetectable, the 76 specimen was considered negative. 78 Quantification of hypoxia and lung injury was carried out as previously reported 9,10 . 79 In brief, the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) in arterial blood taken from the patients 80 at various time-points after hospitalization was measured by the ABL90 blood gas \n\nPatients and sample profile 99 Altogether, 866 respiratory specimens from 213 patients were collected, including 100 All rights reserved.

Both 151 them had a travelling history to Wuhan. The CT scan of the two cases showed 152 multiple ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs. The PiO2/FiO2 and Murray score 153 were 188 and 2 for case 02, 306 and 1.5 for case 07, which indicated a lung injury. found that only a small portion (28%) of NCP cases showed sputum production 7 . As 173 a result, nasal swabs may be the most widely applicable samples for virus detection. 174 On the contrary, throat swabs were not recommended for the viruses detection, 175 All rights reserved.

Although the sample size was small, it also suggests that the viral distribution is 203 associated with diseases severity. More importantly, why the viruses in some 204 individuals retained in the upper respiratory tract merits further elucidation. 205 Our study also has some limitations.
