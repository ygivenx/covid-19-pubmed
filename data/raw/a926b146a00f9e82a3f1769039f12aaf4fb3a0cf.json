{"title": "Enantioselective syntheses of carbocyclic nucleosides 5 0 -homocarbovir, epi-4 0 -homocarbovir, and their cyclopropylamine analogs using facially selective Pd-mediated allylations", "body": "Carbocyclic nucleosides have been extensively targeted due to their potent antiviral and anti-cancer activities. 1 Naturally occurring deoxynucleotides are needed to synthesize viral DNA. Carbovir (\u00c0)-1 and related compounds are analogs of natural deoxynucleotides and compete for incorporation into the growing viral DNA chain. 2 Incorporation of dideoxynucleosides such as carbovir results in chain termination and disruption of the viral replication process. 3 In particular, carbovir (\u00c0)-1 has shown significant in vitro anti-HIV activity through its triphosphate analog by inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. 2 Its congener, abacavir (\u00c0)-2, has a considerably improved toxicity profile and higher oral bioavailability. 4 Abacavir is metabolized to the triphosphate of carbovir by a unique mechanism that circumvents formation of carbovir itself. 5 Consequently, abacavir has in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy against HIV. It has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of HIV infection under the brand name Ziagen. 6 Due to the important activity of carbocyclic nucleosides, there is continued interest in the syntheses of new analogs. One approach has been to extend the 4 0 -carbon side chain. 7 Although the enantioselective syntheses of 5 0 -homocarbovir (\u00c0)-3a and 5 0 -homoabacavir (\u00c0)-3b have been reported 8 (Fig. 1) , only 5 0 -homocarbovir (AE)-3a 9 has been evaluated in antiviral assays and showed poor activity in limited testing. 9a To further investigate the activity profiles of (\u00c0)-3a as well as the previously untested (\u00c0)-3b, we developed a new synthetic route from an acylnitroso-derived hetero DielseAlder cycloadduct, which utilizes decarboxylative rearrangements of allyl 2,2,2-trifluroethylmalonates to install the 4 0hydroxyethyl side chain. The modification of a single step in the sequence allowed for access to the unprecedented epi-4 0 analogs (\u00fe)-4a and (\u00fe)-4b.\n\nOur research group's continued interest in the syntheses of diverse carbocyclic nucleosides 10,11 has led to the development of a reliable method for the synthesis of cyclopentenol (\u00c0)-7. 12 We recently reported the Cp 2 TiCl-catalyzed reduction of Boc cycloadduct (AE)-6. 13 The reaction was performed on large scale (50 mmol) and an isolated yield of 79% was obtained after the resultant silylated alcohol was deprotected with a simple acidic work-up with 1 M HCl (Scheme 1). Kinetic enzymatic resolution of (AE)-7 was achieved with commercially available immobilized Candida antarctica B lipase to ultimately form the enantiopure alcohol (\u00c0)-7. 12 Cyclopentenol (\u00c0)-7 was coupled with 3-oxo-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)propanoic acid 8 to form allyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl malonate (\u00c0)-9 in high yield (Scheme 2). As previously reported, malonate (\u00c0)-9 underwent facile decarboxylative rearrangement in the presence of Pd(dba) 2 and dppe to provide homoallylic ester (\u00c0)-10 with complete diastereo-and regio-control. 14 Formation of the p-allyl palladium complex proceeded on the less hindered face and anti attack by the in situ generated nucleophilic alkoxy ethenolate species afforded the product with retention of configuration. Reduction of (\u00c0)-10 with 2 equiv of diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) yielded the desired alcohol (\u00c0)-11. 14 We then turned our attention to construction of the chloroguanine base. 2, 15 Upon deprotection of the Boc group with 12 M HCl, aminoalcohol (\u00c0)-11 underwent nucleophilic aromatic substitution with 2-amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine to afford alcohol (\u00fe)-12 in 50% yield over two steps (Scheme 3). Azo coupling of (\u00fe)-12 with 4chlorobenzenediazonium chloride followed by reduction of the resulting aryl azo compound with Zn in acetic acid afforded triaminopyrimidine (\u00c0)-13. 2-Propanol was selected as the co-solvent over ethanol due to the formation of side products from reaction with ethanol. 16 Cyclization of (\u00c0)-13 with triethyl orthoformate in the presence of catalytic acid provided chloroguanine (\u00c0)-14. Careful monitoring of the reaction time was necessary to prevent substitution of the 6-Cl group with ethanol, which formed an inseparable byproduct. 17 Chloroguanine (\u00c0)-14 was refluxed in 0.33 M NaOH for 2 h to produce 5 0 -homocarbovir (\u00c0)-3a in 60% yield (Scheme 4). Alternatively, (\u00c0)-14 was stirred in 2-propanol at 70 C in the presence of excess cyclopropylamine to form 5 0homoabacavir (\u00c0)-3b in 80% yield.\n\ntrans-Carbocyclic nucleosides have been reported in the literature. 18 The synthetic routes towards these molecules were specifically designed around formation of the necessary anti-1,4aminocyclopentene. We envisioned a route that required minimal modification from our method to (\u00c0)-3a and (\u00c0)-3b. Cyclopentenol (\u00c0)-7 was treated with 3-oxo-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)propanoic acid 8 under Mitsunobu conditions to form allyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl malonate (\u00c0)-15 in high yield with the expected inversion of configuration at C-4 0 (Scheme 5). Pd(0)-mediated decarboxylative rearrangement of allyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl malonate (\u00c0)-15 proceeded with complete diastereo-and regio-control. The retention of configuration during this process is again noteworthy. Reduction of (\u00fe)-16 with 2 equiv of diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) yielded the desired alcohol (\u00fe)-17. With the new C-4 0 Scheme 1. Synthesis of aminocyclopentenol (\u00c0)-7. stereochemistry established, construction of the chloroguanine base proceeded as described for the synthesis of the syn-1,4-disubstituted cyclopentene derivative. Chloroguanine (\u00fe)-20 was synthesized in five steps from alcohol (\u00fe)-17.\n\nChloroguanine (\u00fe)-20 was refluxed in 0.33 M NaOH for 2 h to produce epi-4 0 -homocarbovir (\u00fe)-4a in 60% yield (Scheme 6). Alternatively, (\u00fe)-20 was stirred in 2-propanol at 70 C in the presence of excess cyclopropylamine to form epi-4 0 -homoabacavir (\u00fe)-4b in 90% yield. The epi-4 0 derivatives proved to be slightly more polar compounds than (e)-3a and (\u00c0)-3b but were amenable to purification by column chromatography.\n\nCompounds (\u00c0)-3a, (\u00c0)-3b, (\u00fe)-4a, and (\u00fe)-4b were subjected to comprehensive screening for antiviral activity. They were tested for antiviral activity in human embryonic lung (HEL) [herpes sim- \n\nThe decarboxylative allylations of allyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl malonates were the key steps en route to 5 0 -homo-carbocyclic nucleoside core structures. Inversion of the C-4 0 stereochemistry at the appropriate stage allowed for the synthesis of new epi-4 0homo-carbocyclic nucleoside analogs without an increase in the number of synthetic transformations. Compounds (\u00c0)-3a, (\u00c0)-3b, (\u00fe)-4a, and (\u00fe)-4b were evaluated for antiviral activity.\n\nCommercially available reagents and anhydrous solvents were used without further purification unless otherwise specified.

Flash chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (230e400 mesh). 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature on a Varian DirectDrive 600 MHz instrument with the residual solvent peaks as internal standards.
