{"title": "The immune vulnerability landscape of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, SARS- CoV-2", "body": "In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China (1) . SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to other regions of China along with more than 150 other countries, at a speed that is much higher than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (2) . Despite the lower mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the scale of the SARS-CoV-2 contagion has already caused more casualties than either of the previous outbreaks. Early research into SARS-CoV-2 has mostly described its epidemiological features (1, 3) , case reports (4), structural characterizations (5), basic genomics features (6, 7) , etc.\n\nScant works have reported on the immunological features of SARS-CoV-2, which could have significant bearing on our understanding of how this virus interacts with its host. Such analyses could also inform antiviral immuno-therapeutic development, which can be either T cell-based or B cell-based. Antibodies can neutralize viral infectivity in a number of ways, such as interfering with binding to receptors, blocking uptake into cells, etc. For SARS-CoV, the human ACE-2 protein is the functional receptor, and anti-ACE2 antibody can block viral replication (8) . On the other hand, previous studies have indicated a crucial role of both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells in SARS-CoV clearance (9, 10), while Janice Oh et al also observed that development of SARS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies requires CD4 + T helper cells (9) . In fact, there are examples of vaccines for influenza that contain both antibody and T cell inducing components (11, 12) .\n\nIn this work, we performed a bioinformatics profiling of the class I and class II MHC binding potentials of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, and also a profiling of the potential for linear epitopes of the viral proteins to induce antibodies. We correlated the immune vulnerability map of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins with its genomic mutations, compared against those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and generated several interesting observations. We made the analyses publicly available as a resource to the research community, in the form of the SARS-CoV-2 Immune Viewer: https://qbrc.swmed.edu/projects/2019ncov_immuneviewer/.\n\nTo explore the immune vulnerability landscape of SARS-CoV-2, we used the netMHCpan software (13, 14) to predict the MHC class I and class II binding peptides of all SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which could elicit CD8 + and CD4 + T cell responses for viral clearance (Fig. 1a) . The counts of the MHC binders were weighted by the allele frequencies of the Chinese population (15) , since most, if not all, samples analyzed in this study were obtained from Chinese patients. We found that there are a small number of genomic regions that showed high peaks of immunogenicity corresponding to a large number of MHC binders in a small neighborhood, which could be better potential vaccine targets (Sup. Table 1 ). The MHC binding peptide profiles of a different racial population, i.e. European ancestry (16) , are shown in Sup. Fig. 1 . Interestingly, the total T cell epitope intensities, calculated as the sum of the number of binders weighted by allele frequency, are slightly higher in the European population than the Chinese population ( Fig. 1b and individual alleles shown in Sup. Fig. 2) , which indicates that different susceptibility to this virus may exist between differential populations. The above analyses were performed for the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The viral strains that have been sampled and sequenced so far are highly similar to each other overall, with a segment of multiple alignment shown in Sup. Fig. 3 .\n\nWe also examined the potential of the viral proteins to encode linear epitopes that can elicit antibody responses using BepiPred 2.0 (17). We focused on linear epitopes, rather than conformational epitopes, because linear epitopes are more suitable for vaccine design (18, 19) and bioinformatics predictions are more feasible. Similar to T cell epitopes, contiguous stretches of >10 epitope-encoding residues, which are more representative of the usual length of B cell epitopes, are located in small genomic regions (red bars in Fig. 1c , and Sup. Table 2 ). We also focused on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which attaches to the ACE-2 protein for entry into the human cell (20) . We used BLAST to align the RBM sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with that of SARS-CoV, and found there is a relatively poor conservation between the two S proteins (Fig. 1d) . This was supported by Wrapp et al (5) , which reports no binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBM by any of the three SARS-CoV RBMdirected antibodies. Therefore, antibody-based therapeutic design should start with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein de novo.\n\nFor comparison, we also computed the immune vulnerability maps of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1e) and MERS-CoV (Fig. 1f) , which are the two other coronaviruses known to have caused past outbreaks. We found that the B cell epitope profiles seem to be more consistent among the three viruses, while the T cell epitope profiles are more distinct.\n\nCoronaviruses are RNA viruses (21) , which generally have very high mutation rates (22). Therefore, we examined the effect of host immune pressure on genetic drifts in SARS-CoV-2. We showed the mutational rates in the viral genomes for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV ( Fig. 2a-c) . SARS-CoV-2 only emerged a short time ago, which likely explains the lack of significant amount of genetic variation (Fig. 2a, n=114) . In comparison, SARS-CoV (Fig. 2b , n=19) and MERS-CoV (Fig. 2c, n=519 ) have both accumulated significant variation among the different strains. However, in SARS-CoV-2, the genomic regions with higher mutational rates can already be discerned (Fig. 2a) , which are roughly 0-9kb and 21kb-30kb, and they largely overlap with the highly mutated regions of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 2bc) . This indicates that we may expect a similar level of genetic variation for this virus in the future, which might also occur in these same regions.\n\nInspired by this observation, we examined whether we can detect any correlation between host immune pressure and genetic drifts of SARS-CoV-2, even at the early stage of viral evolution. We examined individual mutations in each SARV-CoV-2 isolate with respect to the reference genome. We predicted the T cell epitopes and B cell epitopes that would be lost and gained due to the mutations in each strain. For T cell epitopes, we take a sum of the lost/gained epitopes weighted by the Chinese HLA allele frequency, to generate an overall \"lost\" immunogenicity score, and an overall \"gained\" immunogenicity score. Fig. 2d (CD8 + T epitopes) and Fig. 2e (CD4 + T epitopes) show that the gained and lost immunogenicity scores are very comparable for most strains, which is just an effect of random change in the epitope profiles due to mutations. But strikingly, the strains that showed a large difference in the lost and gained immunogenicity almost all have dramatic net loss, rather than net gain, of immunogenicity ( Fig. 2d and 2e) . Similarly, we calculated the number of amino acid residues that could encode B cell epitopes predicted from the protein sequences of each SARS-CoV-2 strain (Fig. 2f) , and also found that there is an overall decrease of the number of B cell epitopes in the isolates compared with the reference genome (Pval=0.001). We limited this analysis to amino acid residues in stretches of >10 epitope-encoding residues, and made the same observation (Pval=0.038, Sup. Fig. 4a) . Furthermore, we grouped the SARS-CoV-2 strains by their collection times in Dec/2019, Jan/2020, and Feb/2020, and compared the changes in T cell and B cell immunogenicity (Sup. Fig. 5) . We confirmed the latter appearing strains are indeed less immunogenic than earlier strains. Taken together, these observations show that the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is subject to immune pressure, and SARS-CoV-2 may be using this mechanism to evade immune surveillance by the host.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is still in the early stages of genetic drifts, which has brought difficulty to capturing the correlation between immune pressure and genetic drifts, given the low signal/noise ratio and low granularity of data. To further corroborate our observation, we performed the same analyses for SARS-CoV (Fig. 2g-i and Sup. Fig. 4b ) and MERS-CoV (Fig. 2j-l and Sup. Fig.  4c) . We observed similar phenomena that the viral strains with large immunogenicity changes almost all have net loss, rather than net gain, of immunogenicity, for both T cell epitopes and B cell epitopes. This suggests that the immune pressure-induced genetic drifts are common to coronaviruses during human circulation, and further supports our conjecture that future genetic drifts can happen in SARS-CoV-2 under this mechanism.\n\nTo facilitate immunological studies of SARS-CoV-2, we created the SARS-CoV-2 Immune Viewer (Sup. Fig. 6 ) to openly share the viral immunogenicity data of SARS-CoV-2, and also SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The Viewer displays a phylogenetic tree with annotations of the strains overlaid (Sup. Fig. 6a) . The tree allows the users to highlight the strains of virus according to the annotations. Upon clicking the node of each tree, the user will be able to download a small data packet for that strain of SARS-CoV-2, which can be directly visualized on the desktop JBrowse software (23) (https://jbrowse.org/blog/). The JBrowse visualization demonstrates the genomic sequence, protein annotations, and T cell and B cell epitopes of each viral isolate (Sup. Fig. 6b) . In addition to downloading of the JBrowse data, we also provided user-friendly visualization functionality for researchers to examine immunogenicity strength of different genomic regions of each of the three viruses online (Sup. Fig. 6c) . Users can either zoom in or zoom out to focus on specific genomic regions or examine the global pattern of T cell/B cell epitope profiles. We also showed the mutational rates of the viral genome along with the immunogenicity maps.\n\nIn summary, we characterized the immune vulnerability landscape of SARS-CoV-2, and compared it with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We reported the viral genomic regions that encode high density T cell epitopes and B cell epitopes in each strain of SARS-CoV-2, which could be more suitable for peptide vaccine and anti-viral antibody development. Similar to a previous report (17) , we also found that the amino acid sequences of the S protein RBMs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 diverge in a manner that may reflect unique immune epitopes. To disseminate our research, we created a publicly accessible database, the SARV-CoV-2 Immune Viewer, for easy exploration and downloading of results. The database is under continuous development, and will be updated when new strains of SARS-CoV-2 are made available.\n\nWe found evidence that the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are more than merely random genetic drifts, by showing some strains of SARS-CoV-2 have immunogenicity loss for T cell-based and/or B cell-based host immune surveillance, and the latter appearing strains are less immunogenic than earlier strains. We found the same phenomenon in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which further supports the validity of this observation. Curiously, for all three coronaviruses, more viral strains showed large immunogenicity loss in class II MHC presentation, than class I MHC presentation. This suggests that the CD4 + T cell-class II MHC axis, compared with the CD8 + T cell-class I MHC axis, may be more important for viral recognition and clearance by the host immune system, in alignment with recent research showing the critical antiviral roles of CD4 + T cells (24-27).\n\nGenetic variations can modify the immunogenicity landscape of the virus, and impact its survival fitness.

The low level of genetic variation in SARS-CoV-2 could merely be a sampling issue due to the short time this virus has circulated in humans. However, the domains of genomes that are highly mutated in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are already more highly mutated in SARS-CoV-2, which means that sustained mutations could happen in these same regions of SARS-CoV-2 in the future.\n\nOverall, our work provides a window into the immunological features of SARS-CoV-2, and have yielded curious insights into the evolution of this virus. We hope our work could aid therapeutic development against this virus to stop this pandemic earlier and to prevent future outbreaks.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences and meta data were downloaded from the https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov database, before the data lock of March 6 th , 2020. The reference genome was acquired from NCBI, which is one of the first few isolates of SARS-CoV-2 collected in late December of 2019: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947. The complete genome SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV sequences are also downloaded from NCBI: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=txid694009%5BOrganism%3Anoexp%5D+and+c omplete+genome and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=txid1335626%5BOrganism%3Anoexp%5D+and+ complete+genome.\n\nEach isolate's genomic sequence was aligned to the reference genome sequence using EMBOSS needle with the gap opening penalty of 20 and the gap extension penalty of 0. The sequence differences were identified as genomic variants and they were annotated using Annomen. In Fig.  2a -c, the semi-transparent boxes mark the regions of high mutational rates due to artefacts of incomplete sequencing. These regions are shielded from calculations of genomic variants. The protein sequences of the isolates were determined based on the sequence differences and the reference gene annotations. The isolate protein sequences were then aligned to the reference protein sequences using EMBOSS needle and the strains whose protein alignments do not cover >90% of the reference protein sequence were ignored.\n\nNetMHCpan (v4.0) (28) and NetMHCIIpan (v3.2) (14) with default threshold options were used to predict T cell peptides from the viral proteins that bind to human MHC class I and II proteins for all the available HLA alleles. The HLA allele population frequency for the Chinese population was acquired from Kwok et al (15) and population frequency for the European population was from Mack et al (16) . The B cell epitope predictions were made by the BepiPred 2.0 software (17) , with default parameters. Amino acids with B cell epitope prediction scores >0.6 are regarded as having high likelihoods of generating linear antibodies.\n\nThe command-line version of MUSCLE (v3.8.31) (29, 30 ) was used to perform multiple genome sequence alignment with diagonal optimization (-diags). The default number of iteration and the default maximum number of new trees were applied during the alignment. The protein sequence alignment between the S proteins, YP_009724390.1 (SARS-CoV-2) and NP_828851.1 (SARS-CoV), was performed using EMBOSS needle (31) with the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix.\n\nThe Immune Viewer is a dynamic website. It is developed using HTML (HyperText Markup Language), JavaScript and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Specifically, we used the D3.js library to allow users to interactively explore the mutation rates or immunogenic scores across the viral genomic regions. We also used the D3.phylogram.js to visualize the phylogenetic tree and the Select2 library to facilitate users' query for different SARS-CoV-2 strains across multiple geographic regions. The data packet downloaded for each viral strain can be directly visualized in the desktop JBrowse software, which can be downloaded from https://jbrowse.org/blog.\n\nAll computations and statistical analyses were carried out in the R and Python computing environment. For all boxplots appearing in this study, box boundaries represent interquartile ranges, whiskers extend to the most extreme data point which is no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range, and the line in the middle of the box represents the median. For the line plots, the viral genomes were binned by every 60 nucleotide, and the number of T cell and B cell epitopes falling into each window is calculated. For T cell epitopes, a sum of the number of epitopes weighted by the corresponding ethnic population's HLA allele (A, B, C, and DRB1) frequency is calculated to form the T cell immunogenicity strength for that population. The genetic variation rate at each nucleotide is calculated by examining all viral strains and counting the proportion of strains with a different nucleotide or with an insertion/deletion, with respect to the reference genome. The genetic variation rates are also binned by the same length of windows and averaged. \n\nJ.Z. and X.Z. performed statistical analyses of the immune vulnerability landscape of the viruses.
