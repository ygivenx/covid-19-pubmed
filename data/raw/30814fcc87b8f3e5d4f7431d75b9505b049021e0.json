ZIKV infection did not induce weight 30 loss compared to mock-infected controls and accordingly only low levels of viral RNA were 31 detected in serum. Only a subset of mice developed neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV, likely due to 32 growth medium (DMEM containing 2% FBS and 20 mM HEPES) were applied to Vero cells in 96-106 well plates and incubated at 37 o C with 5% CO 2 for 1 hr. Cells were then overlaid with 1% 107 methylcellulose in minimum essential medium Eagle (MEM). Infected cell foci were detected 42-108 46 hpi. Following fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr at room temperate, plates were 109 incubated with 500 ng/ml of flavivirus cross-reactive mouse MAb E60 (19) for 2 hr at room 110 temperature or overnight at 4 o C. After incubation at room temperate for 2 hr with a 1:5,000 dilution 111 of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), foci were detected by 112 addition of TrueBlue substrate (KPL). Foci were quantified with a CTL Immunospot instrument. 113 114 Measurement of viremia. Blood was collected in serum separator tubes (BD) and serum was 115 separated by centrifugation at 8000rpm for 5 min. Serum was stored at -80 o C until RNA isolation. 116 RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (tissues) or Viral RNA Mini Kit (serum) (Qiagen). 117 ZIKV RNA levels were determined by TaqMan one-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR 118 (qRT-PCR) on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad) using standard 119 cycling conditions. Viral burden is expressed on a Log 10 scale as viral RNA equivalents per ml 120 after comparison with a standard curve produced using serial 10-fold dilutions of RNA extracted 121 with 1000 FFU of ZIKV (or diluent alone) by subcutaneous inoculation in the footpad. We 154 evaluated 3 ZIKV strains ( Table 2 ) with distinct virulence phenotypes in immunodeficient mice. 155 All rights reserved.

MR766 is the prototype ZIKV strain and has been passaged ~150 times through suckling 157 mouse brains, which could result in mouse-adaptive mutations (14-16). However, the MR766 158 variant used in these studies contains a 4 amino acid deletion ablating an N-linked glycosylation 159 site in the viral envelope protein, resulting in a virus that is less virulent in Ifnar1 -/mice compared 160\n\nto H/PF/2013 (2, 17). Dakar-MA was generated by passaging a ZIKV strain isolated from 161 mosquitos in Senegal in the 1980s (Dakar 41525) serially in Rag1 -/mice, resulting in a virus with 162 enhanced pathogenesis in mice (4). Mice were weighed daily after infection, as weight loss is a 163 sign of ZIKV disease in immunocompromised mouse models and typically precedes lethality (2). 164\n\nIn contrast to IFN-deficient mice (and similar to WT C57Bl/6J mice) (2), none of the CC lines 165 tested lost weight following infection with any ZIKV strain (Figure 1) . Indeed, most lines exhibited 166 modest weight gain over the 14 day experiment, and the rate of weight gain was no slower in 167 infected mice than in mock-infected controls. None of the mice exhibited disease signs consistent 168 with those observed in IFN-deficient mice (e.g. hunching, ruffled fur, paralysis, or encephalitis). 169 CC051 and CC059 share more genetic similarities than average pairs of CC mice, so phenotypes 170 that differ between these two lines may be especially easy to map by quantitative trait locus (QTL) 171 analysis. Because 5-week-old CC059 mice exhibited slightly slower weight gain after ZIKV 172 infection compared to mock-infected mice, whereas ZIKV infection had no effect on the rate of 173 weight gain in CC051 mice, we tested ZIKV infection in weanlings of these 2 lines. We reasoned 174 that because 3-week-old mice gain weight at a faster rate than 5-week-old mice, they may reveal 175 phenotypes that are not evident in 5-week-old mice. However, while we found that 3-week-old 176 mice indeed gained weight at a faster rate than 5-week-old mice, there was no difference in the 177 rate of weight gain in mice infected with ZIKV Dakar-MA compared to mock-infected, for either 178 CC051 or CC059 (Figure 2) . Altogether, these observations indicate that ZIKV does not induce 179 significant disease in any of the 13 CC lines tested. 180 181 All rights reserved.

RNA per mL of serum) was detected at 1 dpi but it was greatly diminished by 3dpi (Figure 3) equivalents of viral RNA per mL of serum at 1dpi, which diminished by 3dpi and was undetectable 204 by 5dpi (Figure 4) . Altogether, these results show that while some ZIKV replication does occur in 205 CC mice, the virus is cleared rapidly, consistent with the lack of disease signs observed in CC 206 mice. Importantly, we did not observe robust differences in viremia between CC lines, indicating 207 that this is not a suitable phenotype for QTL mapping studies. 208\n\nZIKV produced only transient low-level viremia in CC mice, we tested whether this was sufficient 211 to elicit the production of neutralizing antibodies.

Mice offer significant advantages in terms of cost, scale, speed, 232 and genetic tractability, enabling mechanistic studies that are not feasible in non-human primate 233 models. A significant disadvantage of mouse models is that ZIKV replicates poorly in 234 immunocompetent mice and thus does not exhibit the tissue tropism and disease phenotypes 235 characteristic of human infection. Mice lacking type I IFN production or responses succumb to 236 ZIKV infection and exhibit broad tissue tropism, implying that the innate antiviral response is a 237 key barrier to ZIKV replication and pathogenesis in mice (2, 36).

The restriction of ZIKV replication in mice 241 results in part from an inability of ZIKV NS5 to degrade murine STAT2 and therefore ZIKV cannot 242 inhibit IFN signaling in mice by the same mechanism used in human cells (5, 6). However, NS5-243 mediated antagonism restricts antiviral signaling only in infected cells whereas these responses 244 are sustained in uninfected cells responding to paracrine IFN signaling. Thus, Stat2 -/mice 245 succumb to ZIKV infection, but transgenic mice expressing human STAT2 only exhibit disease in 246 the context of ZIKV strains with additional mouse-adaptive mutations (4, 44). In addition, the ZIKV 247 NS2B-NS3 protease targets human but not murine STING, resulting in sustained IFN production 248\n\nand diminished viral replication in mouse cells (3). However, mice lacking STING were not more 249 susceptible to ZIKV than wild-type mice (2, 3), implying that STING is a contributing but not susceptibility defined in mice. Over 80 years ago, flavivirus resistance was shown to be inherited 254 in a single gene autosomal dominant manner (22, 45, 46) , and more than 15 years ago the 255 resistance phenotype was mapped to the Oas1b gene (47, 48). More recent studies used F1 256 hybrids of CC mice to define genetic determinants of WNV pathogenesis and found that the QTL 257 with the largest effect mapped to Oas1b (12, 49). The antiviral activity of Oas1b restricts all 258 flaviviruses (>13 viruses tested) and appears to act exclusively against flaviviruses. Other 259 members of the Oas gene family restrict viral replication by sensing dsRNA and synthesizing the 260 second messenger 2'-5' oligoadenylate, which activates the cytoplasmic RNA degrading enzyme 261\n\nRNaseL. However, Oas1b is not catalytically active and does not activate RNaseL (50). The 262 flavivirus restricting activity of Oas1b is cell intrinsic and restricts viral replication in a post-entry 263 manner, but its mechanism is unknown (50, 51). OAS orthologs in other species also restrict viral 264 All rights reserved.

Thus, we sought to determine whether CC 280 mice might provide a useful model system for ZIKV. We found that, although ZIKV viremia was 281 detectable at 1dpi, the amount of viral RNA detected in serum was very low and cleared rapidly, 282 and infected mice exhibited no signs of disease including weight loss. Based on these results, the 283 tested CC lines are unlikely to be useful as models of ZIKV disease or as tools to map host factors 284 that control ZIKV pathogenesis. This was true even of CC lines carrying non-functional alleles of 285\n\nOas1b, which would be expected to be the most susceptible to flavivirus infection (12). 286 287 It is possible that additional approaches could reveal experimentally useful ZIKV phenotypes in 288 CC mice. These could include administering virus by an intravenous, rather than subcutaneous 289 route, or infecting with a higher dose of virus, although the 1x10 5 FFU dose we used for infections 290 All rights reserved.

Another approach would be administering an IFNAR-blocking 291 monoclonal antibody (MAR1-5A3) prior to ZIKV infection. In C57Bl/6J mice, MAR1-5A3 treatment 292 results in elevated viremia and relevant clinical phenotypes such as transplacental transmission, 293 though it is not sufficient to produce weight loss or lethality. Furthermore, our study tested only a 294 subset of CC lines; additional lines not tested here may reveal more robust pathogenesis 295 phenotypes. The overall lack of disease in CC mice highlights the species-specific restriction 296 factors that limit ZIKV infection in mice. CC mice remain a valuable system for studying host 297 factors that control flavivirus pathogenesis, but are likely to be more revealing for flaviviruses that 298 are able to cause more robust infection in mice than ZIKV.
