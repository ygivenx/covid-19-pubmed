{"title": "", "body": "For each virus, Section H (Map Credits) gives the general source of documenta tion. Appendix \u0392 gives the more specific documentation. Wherever possible the best geographical review containing specific citations for individual countries will be presented first. This will be followed by the names of the countries (boldfaced) not mentioned in the review article with their individual documenta tions.\n\nSome of the reviewers have access to unpublished data and they are cited in many cases. The OIE has annual summary reports available and therefore exact volume and page numbers are not presented for the countries reported in the OIE bulletins. To conserve space only the abstract number and the year from the Animal Disease Occurrence (ADO) will be presented for some references. Occa sionally, for certain foreign articles, the volume and page number will be cited from the Veterinary Bulletin (Vet. Bull.) along with the translated citation.\n\nAdditional information is provided to help clarify the interpretations of the individual maps where necessary.

The suspected areas include those regions where both the warthog and the princi pal vector (Ornithodoros moubata) have been reported.

The documented areas were derived from the reviewers, Agrimi, P. (1974) . Since the virus is thought to be worldwide, an in-depth literature search was not attempted and instead of recording the documentation, the AHY 1979 and 1980 was used as a basis for this map except for China (personal communication with Hu Hsiang-Pih).\n\nMost of the areas can be found in OIE reports. Beginning in 1982 sheeppox and goatpox were not separated in the OIE reports. Therefore, some of the shaded areas may result from that fact (see Sheep pox map, Fig. 93 The documented areas were from OIE reports (1979 to July 1982) except for Philippines [Gatapia, S. L. Proc.

The information presented was supplied by the reviewer. Albania, Lebanon, and Israel all should be blank. The documented areas were supplied primarily by the reviewers. Since the virus is thought to be ubiquitous, it is doubtful that any country which received breeding pigs from the developed countries would be free of the virus.

A very recent publication is World Health Organization (1982) The documented areas were derived from OIE reports (1978 ( to July 1982 except for India [Singh, G., and Baxi, \u039a. K. (1980). Indian Vet. Med. J. 4, 25-27] . The reviewers were not in agreement with the map. Those countries reported positive in the AHY for 1979 or 1980 which may not be readily discern ible are Guinea Bissau, Togo, Djibouti, and Vietnam. Kuwait and United Arab Emirates are documented. Gambia should be blank. The suspected coun tries were those with no documentation or reports in the AHY, but there was evidence to indicate the use of rinderpest vaccine occurring within their borders. Perhaps \"high risk\" countries would be better than \"suspected.\" The documented areas were from material supplied by the reviewer or cited in Kurstak, E. et al. (1981) .

The documented areas were derived from a USD A map entitled \"Scrapie Eradication. Scrapie, as of September 30, 1980\" supplied by the reviewer. On this map Somalia was mislabeled as Djibouti. The disease was reported in imported sheep, but eradicated from both Australia and New Zealand. Because of the nature of the agent (no detectable antibodies discovered as yet and latent clinical manifestations), the geographical distribution is uncertain. There is anec dotal evidence to suggest that the disease exists in the USSR (personal commu nication with the reviewer). Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates were both listed as documented. The documented areas were from OIE reports. Beginning in 1982 sheep pox and goatpox were not separated in the OIE reports. Therefore, some of the shaded areas may result from that fact (see Goatpox map, Fig. 52 ). Not listed in the OIE reports were Nigeria [Asagba, M. O., and Nawathe, D. R. (1981) .

Areas labeled Teschen strain were from OIE reports or personal communica tion with the reviewer. Those areas labeled Talfon are from the reviewer except for Switzerland [Zindel, F. etal. (1980) . Vet. Bull. 51, No. 3172] . Belgium is documented for the Talfon strain. The small part of southern Zaire listed as positive for the Teschen strain may not be readily apparent on the map. The areas shaded were adopted entirely from a map supplied by the reviewer except for the area in north Peru ). Bull. Off. Int. Epizoot. 92 (10), 1169 -1170 . Good geographical reviews are available [Lord, R. D. (1974) . Pan Am. Health Organization Bull. 8 (2), 100-105, Trapido, H. (1972) . \"Geo graphical Distribution and Ecological Setting,\" Sci.

Maps of the subtype distribution are available [see Monath, T. P., and Trent, D. W. (1981) . In \"Comparative Diagnosis of Viral Diseases\" (E. Kurstak and C. Kurstak, eds.), Vol. IV, pp. 351-354, Academic Press, New York]. The specific virus is not thought to occur naturally. (Preserved specimens may be maintained in certain laboratories.) The map delineates the presumed distribu tion of the closely related San Miguel sea lion virus. The areas demarked were adopted from Hanson, R. P. (1982) . In \"Virus Diseases of Food Animals\" (E. P. J. Gibbs, ed.), Vol. 2, pp. 527-532. Aca demic Press, New York, and Mason, J. et al. (1975) . Proc. 80th Annu. Meet. U.S. Anim. Health Assoc. pp. 234-253. These areas indicate the range of the virus in the past. The occurrence in the temperate portions of the range is uncommon. The areas demarked were adopted from Hanson, R. P. (1982) .
