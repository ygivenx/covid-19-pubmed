{"title": "", "body": "Frequency of PRRS live vaccine virus (European and North American genotype) in vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs submitted for respiratory tract diagnostics in North-Western Germany\n\nPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus emerged in Europe in the early 1990s and rapidly spread over the continent, thus becoming one of the major causes of economic losses for swine producers. Simultaneously, the disease emerged in the USA with a similar impact on pig production (Cho and Dee, 2006) . Genetic and antigenic comparisons of viruses in Europe and North America showed that PRRS virus segregates into the European (EU) and the North American (NA) genotypes (Allende et al., 1999) . A high degree of variability has been demonstrated within both genotypes (Stadejek et al., 2008) . Historically, EU and NA genotype viruses have been restricted to the respective continents.\n\nSince 1996, when the first modified live vaccine of the NA genotype (Ingelvac 1 PRRS MLV, Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany) was introduced in Denmark and Germany, this virus was increasingly being detected in these countries. However, it has also been reported to have appeared in other countries such as Italy, Austria, Poland and Hungary, where the NA genotype vaccine is not authorised (Botner et al., 1997; Storgaard et al., 1999; Martelli, 2002; Indik et al., 2005; Oleksiewicz et al., 2005; Balka et al., 2008; Lillie et al., 2008) . Although a basic requirement of live vaccine virus strains is that natural transmission of vaccine virus is minimal or non-existent (Mateu and Diaz, 2008) , this widespread appearance of NA vaccine viruses across\n\nThe frequency of PRRSV corresponding to live vaccines and wild-type was determined in 902 pigs from North-Western Germany submitted for post-mortem examination. Overall, 18.5% of the samples were positive for the EU wild-type virus. EU genotype vaccine virus was detected in 1.3% and the NA genotype vaccine virus in 8.9% of all samples. The detection of the EU vaccine was significantly higher in pigs vaccinated with the corresponding vaccine (OR = 9.4). Pigs vaccinated with NA genotype had significantly higher detection chances for the corresponding vaccine virus when compared to nonvaccinated animals (OR = 3.34) animals, however, NA vaccine was also frequently detected in non-vaccinated pigs. Concluding, the dynamics of NA genotype vaccine and EU wildtype virus corresponds with studies on PRRSV spread in endemically infected herds. The potential of spontaneous spread of the NA genotype vaccine should be considered in the planning of eradication programs.\n\n\u00df 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n\nEurope raises the suspicion that it is spreading independently from vaccination (Botner et al., 1997; Oleksiewicz et al., 1998) . In 2001, a live EU genotype vaccine from the Lelystad phylogenetic cluster (strain DV; Porcilis 1 PRRS, Intervet, Boxmeer, The Netherlands) was authorised in all EU member states. To date, only limited information concerning the ability of spontaneous spread of this DV vaccine strain is available (Astrup and Riising, 2002; Voglmayr et al., 2006) .\n\nThe objectives of this study were (1) to determine the frequency of the EU and the NA genotype PRRS vaccine viruses in a large sample of pigs from North-Western Germany, (2) to assess the association between vaccine isolate detection and vaccination history and (3) to characterise the identified vaccine isolates considering their origin.\n\nThe pigs in the study predominately (71%) originated from 10 counties in the Western part of Lower Saxony and North-West of North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany. These counties have a pig density ranging between 543 and 1371 pigs per 100 acre of area used for agriculture (B\u00e4 urle and Windhorst (2005) ). Together they harbour about 8.1 million pigs, which is approximately 30% of the German pig population (Gatzka et al., 2005) . A further 15.4% of the pigs were from neighbouring counties with a pig density between 300 and 500 pigs per 100 acre of area used for agriculture. The remaining 13.6% of the pigs were from various regions with lower pig densities.\n\nThe study was carried out between January and December 2007. During that period 1970 pigs were submitted to the Field Station for Epidemiology for postmortem examination. Since on-farm necropsies are not allowed in Germany, the Field Station is the only institute offering post-mortem examinations in the Northwest of Lower Saxony. Nine hundred and two of these pigs aged between 1 and 25 weeks of life had a history of respiratory disease and/or emaciation and were included in the study. The 902 pigs belonging to 488 submissions originated from 439 herds and were submitted by 141 different veterinary practices. Almost 21% of the pigs submitted were sent as a single pig from one farm on any one day, 47% from a submission with two pigs and 32% from submissions with three to five pigs per herd.\n\nLung tissue from these pigs was subsequently frozen at \u00c020 8C and later tested for PRRSV by a nonaplex RT-PCR in an accredited diagnostic laboratory (IVD GmbH, Hannover, ISO 17025/2005, AKS-P-20320-EU). Samples positive for PRRSV by nonaplex RT-PCR were selected for further examination and genetic typing of PRRSV.\n\nThe vaccination history of the 902 pigs was obtained from the veterinary surgeons who had submitted the pigs for examination. Telephone interviews were conducted by one of two investigators that followed a standardised questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of six closed (predefined range of answers or yes/no) questions on PRRS vaccination management/history of the herds of origin. It was hypothesised that these variables were related to the detection of the vaccine and/or wild-type viruses. The questionnaire was pre-tested on three veterinarians by the corresponding author to assess the clarity of questions.\n\nThree binary (positive/negative) diagnostic outcome variables were defined: pig (sample) detection status of (a) PRRS wild-type virus, (b) PRRS EU genotype vaccine virus and (c) PRRS NA genotype vaccine virus.\n\nAll potential risk factors (with coding) that were examined for their association with the above listed outcome variables are described in Table 1 .\n\nThe initial analysis of the samples was performed in an accredited commercially operating diagnostic laboratory using a nonaplex RT-PCR. Targeting by a two-tube randomprimed RT-PCR protocol six viral and two mycoplasmal Table 1 Explanatory variables used to identify risk factors for the occurrence of PRRS EU and NA genotype live vaccine virus in pigs from North-Western Germany (2007).\n\nThe age of the pigs, which was usually not available, is described by the production stage. ''Suckling pigs'' are up to 4 weeks old. ''Weaning pigs'' usually are 4-10 weeks of age. ''Growing pigs'' have entered the finishing barns and are 11-15 weeks of age. ''Fattening pigs'' cover the time from 16 weeks to slaughter. The information was cross-checked with the body weight of each pig.\n\nPigs could have been vaccinated with an EU genotype modified live vaccine (Porcilis 1 PRRS), a NA genpotype modified live vaccine (Ingelvac 1 PRRS MLV) or they were non-vaccinated.

Sow vaccination scheme Sow herds were vaccinated at a regular interval of 3-5 month or were vaccinated at the 60th day of each gestation and the 6th day after each birth (6/60 scheme).

It also includes an internal positive control based on detection of transcripts of a porcine single-copy gene. Evaluation is performed using standard agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nEstimates of sensitivity and specificity exceed 90% since for both viral and bacterial targets no unspecific amplificates have been obtained with reference material of closely related pathogens and detection limits measured for PCV-2, PRRSV, and SIV ranged from 50 to 500 DNA plasmidbased copies per assay in combined, multiplex amplifications.\n\nAll samples positive for the ORF7 fragment of the EU genotype by nonaplex RT-PCR were re-examined by a conventional DV-specific ORF5 RT-PCR. The primers DV-Orf5-FW-221 (5 0 -GCG GGC GGT ATG TAC TCT G-3 0 ; position 313-332; ATg orf5 = 1) and DV-Orf5-RV-531 (5 0 -GTG ACG AGG TTG CCG TCG A-3 0 ; position 531-512; ATg orf5 = 1) were used for cDNA amplification after random-primed reverse transcription employing the Superscript II polymerase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). PCR was carried out with HotStar taq (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) after denaturation for 15 min at 95 8C and 35 cycles of 20 s at 95 8C, 15 s at 56 8C, 20 s at 72 8C and a final elongation (10 min at 72 8C).\n\nSamples positive for PRRSV by nonaplex RT-PCR were further processed for genetic typing. For reverse transcription, 8 ml of RNA were added to 18 ml of a mixture containing 1\u00c2 RT buffer and 2.5 mM of each dNTP (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and heated to 80 8C for 5 min. Immediately thereafter the mixture was transferred to an ice bath. Then 25 ml of a master mix consisting of 0.1 mM DTT, 100 mM random hexamers (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , and 10,000 U of Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) were added. The samples were incubated for 5 min at 25 8C, 60 min at 55 8C, and 5 min at 99 8C. After cooling to 4 8C, the cDNAs were either used directly for PCR or stored at \u00c020 8C.\n\nThe primers Forward 322 (5 0 -CGG TTG CTI CAT TTC ITG AC-3 0 ) and Reverse 323 (5 0 -CAC CTT IAG GGC ITA TAT CA-3 0 ) flanking the ORF5 were used for amplification and sequencing. These primers amplify a product of 777 bp from the EU genotype strain Lelystad, and 788 bp from the NA genotype strain VR 2332.\n\nThe PCR reactions were performed in a volume of 50 ml. The PCR mix consisted of 1\u00c2 PCR reaction buffer, 200 mM of each dNTP (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 pmol of each primer and 1 IU of taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), and 4 ml of cDNA.\n\nAmplification was performed for 39 cycles: denaturation at 94 8C for 45 s, annealing at 50 8C for 45 s, and elongation at 72 8C for 1 min. After this, the samples were incubated for additional 10 min at 72 8C and then cooled to 4 8C until further processing.\n\nIn the case of negative reactions for samples considered to be positive as shown by the results of the nonaplex RT-PCR, the PCR products were subjected to a second round of amplification using previously described genotype-specific primers (Oleksiewicz et al., 1998) . For this PCR, the annealing temperature was set to 60 8C.\n\nAfter verifying the success of RT-PCR by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels followed by ethidium bromide staining, the amplicons were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified products were cycle-sequenced in both directions by MWG (Ebersberg, Germany) using the corresponding PCR primers.\n\nNucleotide sequences were edited and analysed using BioEdit 7.0.9 (Hall, 1999) , and aligned using ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1997) . The % identities were calculated using the menu alignment, sequence identity matrix as implemented in BioEdit. The sequences of the EU genotype strains Lelystad (M96262) and Porcilis 1 PRRS-DV (DQ324710) and of the NA genotype strains VR-2332 (AY150564) and Ingelvac 1 PRRS MLV (AF535152) were included in the phylogenetic analyses. Sequences from the Eastern European subgroups EU-2, EU-3 and EU-4 (Stadejek et al., 2006) were downloaded from GenBank (DQ324677; DQ324686; DQ324696; DQ324694; DQ324671; DQ324682; DQ324667).\n\nQuestionnaire and laboratory data were entered into a spreadsheet program (Excel for Office 2007; www.microsoft.com) and further analysed using the statistical packages NCSS 2007 (www.ncss.com) and STATA 10 (www.stata.com).\n\nThe population studied consists of pigs submitted for routine diagnostic of respiratory disease and/or emaciation to the Field Station for Epidemiology. Patently, one cannot expect data from one, or even a few, animals from one farm to be representative of herd status. For this reason the present analyses are based on individual pigs as the statistical unit. The occurrence of PRRSV at the individual pig level was combined with data to facilitate statistical extrapolation.\n\nAfter demonstrating a high agreement between results of the differentiating DV PCR and the sequencing of the detected EU genotype virus isolates (details not shown) it was decided to use the DV PCR results for EU genotype vaccine isolate identification.\n\nIn a first analysis step, the survey tab module of STATA 10 was used to derive sample (PCR positivity) prevalence estimates with exact confidence limits for the presence of each of the outcomes in (a) non-vaccinated, (b) EU genotype vaccinated and (c) NA genotype vaccinated pigs. The analysis was adjusted for survey design structure, i.e. the potential clustering effect of farm of origin when multiple pigs per farm had been submitted for examination during the study period. Wald adjusted P-values were derived to assess the association between vaccination status and PRRS virus detection for each outcome.\n\nIn order to assess whether, within each outcome group, the prevalence of EU wild-type virus or vaccine isolate, respectively, and NA vaccine isolate detection differed, the observed isolate detection frequencies were compared to those expected under the null hypothesis (no difference). These expected frequencies were adjusted for the fact that, in the sample, the proportion of piglets vaccinated with either vaccine isolate differed substantially (standardisation).\n\nIn a final analysis, the robust logistic and Poisson regression routines of STATA 10 with farm as a cluster variable were employed to derive odds ratios (OR; logistic regression model) and incidence risk ratios (IRR, Poisson regression model) with exact confidence intervals for the association between the specific PRRS isolate detection and possible risk factors. The models always contained (a) pig vaccination status (no vaccination, EU genotype vaccination, NA genotype vaccination) and (b) age of the animal when submitted for diagnostics (4 categories). The variables (c) own breeding sows (yes, no) and (d) sow-level vaccination status (no vaccination, EU genotype vaccination, NA genotype vaccination, inactivated EU genotype vaccination) were tested for (i) their statistical significance in the model and, if non-significant, their confounding effect on the factors (a) and (b). Confounding was defined as a change in the parameter estimates of the remaining risk factors in the model of >20%. Factors that were neither significant nor confounders were dropped from the respective models. Due to the low frequency in some outcomes, interactions between risk factors were not included. The alpha level of statistical significance was set to 0.05.\n\nOverall, 18.5% (95% CI: 16.7-21.7%) of the examined samples with valid results (n = 902) were positive for the PRRS EU wild-type virus by nonaplex RT-PCR. The EU genotype vaccine virus was detected in 1.3% (0.76-2.3%) and the NA genotype vaccine virus in 8.9% (6.9-11.4%) of all samples ( Table 2) .\n\nThe production stage-specific detection rates for EU wild-type virus and NA genotype vaccine virus showed the highest values in weaning and growing pigs (Fig. 1) .\n\nDetection prevalence of the EU wild-type virus was independent of the vaccination status (P = 0.3159). However, the detection of EU genotype vaccine virus was significantly higher in pigs exposed to the corresponding vaccine virus (P = 0.0302), and the detection of NA genotype vaccine virus was significantly higher in pigs vaccinated with the NA genotype vaccine (P = 0.0349).\n\nWithin each vaccination class, the detection prevalence of the PRRS NA genotype vaccine virus was significantly higher than the detection prevalence of the PRRS EU genotype vaccine virus (Table 2, FET P-values in last column).\n\nThe results of the logistic regression models (with OR) and the respective Poisson regression models (with RR) Table 2 Prevalence with 95% exact confidence intervals (CI) of the detection of (a) PRRS EU wild-type strain, (b) PRRS EU vaccine strain and (c) PRRS NA vaccine strain in non-vaccinated, EU genotype vaccinated and NA genotype vaccinated animals in a sample of 902 pigs collected between January and December 2007 in North-Western Germany. strongly agreed; we therefore only presented the OR derived from the logistic regression models (Table 3) . With both the vaccination status and animal production class (as a proxy parameter for age) in the model, neither sow vaccination status nor the presence of sows on the farm were statistically significant or acted as influential confounders; those two variables therefore were omitted from the models. Detection of the PRRS EU wild-type virus did not depend on vaccination status (P > 0.19). Weaning pigs had a borderline higher chance (OR = 2.3, P = 0.10) of EU wildtype virus detection when compared to suckling pigs, and for growing pigs the difference to suckling pigs was statistically significant (Table 3 , Model 1). Fattening pigs showed a slightly increased OR, however, this was not significant.\n\nThe detection of the PRRS EU vaccine virus (Table 3, Model 2) was significantly higher in pigs vaccinated with the EU genotype vaccine when compared to non-vaccinated animals (OR = 9.4). Due to the low number of positive pigs (n = 12), estimates for the age classes were either invalid or associated with very large confidence intervals, and should be interpreted with caution. The pattern, however, was similar to that seen in Model 1 in that weaning and growing pigs had higher virus detection odds when compared to suckling and fattening pigs.\n\nAnimals vaccinated with the NA genotype vaccine had significantly higher detection chances/rates for the PRRS NA genotype vaccine virus when compared to nonvaccinated animals (OR = 3.34, P = 0.001). A similar pattern in the association between age class and virus detection as in Models 1 and 2 was seen (Table 3 , Model 3). Table 3 Odds ratio (OR) estimates from a logistic regression model with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and robust P-values for the association between vaccination status and animal age and three different outcomes, the detection of PRRS EU wild-type strain (Model 1), PRRS EU vaccine strain (Model 2) and PRRS NA vaccine strain (Model 3) in a sample of 902 pigs collected between January and December 2007 in North-Western Germany.\n\nOdds ratio (OR) 95% CI limits Robust P-value \n\nMaterial from 168 of the 259 samples found positive in the diagnostic laboratory was available for genetic typing by amplifying and sequencing the ORF5. Of these, 104 were of the EU genotype, and 64 of the NA genotype. The ORF5 nucleotide sequence of 11 of the EU genotype isolates had 99.1-100%, identity with the corresponding ORF of the Porcilis 1 PRRS DV strain. The agreement of the results obtained by sequencing and DV PCR was substantial (kappa index 0.797, 95% CI 0.604, 0.989; 9 samples DV PCR positive and nucleotide identity >98%; 2 samples DV PCR negative and nucleotide identity >98%; 2 samples DV PCR positive and nucleotide identity <98%; 91 samples DV PCR negative and nucleotide identity <98%).\n\nNucleotide identities of the remaining EU genotype isolates with the Porcilis 1 PRRS-DV strain were between 85.3 and 91.7%, allowing their classification as EU wildtype virus.\n\nNucleotide identities of the ORF5 of the NA genotype isolates with the Ingelvac 1 PRRS MLV vaccine strain were between 96 and 100%.\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate how often PRRS wild-type virus and/or vaccine virus could be detected in pigs either vaccinated against PRRSV or not. The data was analysed in the light of the vaccination history on farm in order to determine any spontaneous spread of PRRS vaccine virus. However, a full description of the herd factors and practices which might have influenced vaccine spread was not in the scope of this paper. Due to the hierarchical nature of the data (one or several pigs submitted per farm), the expected clustering effect had to be corrected for both the prevalence estimation and the regression analysis. This was achieved by using the respective modules offered by the software package (STATA). Without such adjustment, confidence intervals might have been too narrow and P-values too low, leading to effect overestimation. We therefore consider our results to be less biased and rather conservative.\n\nTwelve years after authorisation of Ingelvac 1 PRRS MLV, NA genotype vaccine virus is widespread in the pig population of North-Western Germany. The average detection rate revealed by nonaplex RT-PCR was 8.9% for NA genotype vaccine virus, while the detection rate for EU wild-type virus was only twice as high (18.5%). As expected, highest detection rates (17.6%) for the NA genotype vaccine virus could be observed in pigs vaccinated with the corresponding vaccine. However, the NA genotype vaccine virus was also found in 8.5% of pigs originated from herds where only the sows received the Ingelvac 1 PRRS MLV and in 5.6% of the pigs from herds with no recent history of vaccination. Given the imperfect sensitivity of the nonaplex PCR the true prevalence is assumed to be underestimated.\n\nThe spread of vaccine virus within herds has been demonstrated in several studies (Botner et al., 1997 Kiss et al., 2006) . The detection of NA genotype vaccine virus in non-vaccinated piglets may be due to both horizontal and vertical transmission either from sows to their offspring or between weaning and growing pigs. Our results suggest that the latter case is most likely because the statistically significant highest detection rates have been found in growing pigs. This peak in the detection rate in growing pigs was also found for EU wild-type virus.\n\nThe highest detection rates for NA genotype vaccine virus in growing pigs were unexpected, due to the fact that piglets were usually vaccinated at 2 or 3 weeks of life. Therefore, the peak in the detection rate was expected in suckling, or at the latest, in weaning pigs. The dynamic of NA genotype vaccine and EU wild-type virus shown by the data in this study corresponds with several studies on PRRS wild-type virus spread in endemically infected herds (Houben et al., 1995; Nodelijk et al., 1997; Larochelle et al., 2003) .\n\nThe detection of NA genotype vaccine virus in pigs from herds with no recent history of Ingelvac 1 PRRS MLV vaccination is in accordance with studies performed in Denmark (Botner et al., 1997; Mortensen et al., 2002) . However, the Danish studies were performed shortly after the vaccine was released for use in the national pig population, and not in a country were both NA and EU vaccines have been in use for several years, as is the case in this report.\n\nTo our knowledge, data on age-dependent detection rates of live PRRS vaccine virus have not been published. The evident similarities in the dynamics of the NA genotype vaccine virus and the EU wild-type virus strongly support the contention that spontaneous transmission of the Ingelvac 1 PRRS MLV is a common occurrence.\n\nIn the present study, the detection of the EU genotype vaccine virus was limited to 12 pigs (1.3%). Nine of these pigs had been vaccinated with the EU genotype vaccine, one pig originated from a herd where sows were vaccinated with the EU genotype vaccine and only two pigs had no history of corresponding vaccination. These findings agree with the outcome of an experimental investigation where only a limited and spontaneous terminating transmission of EU genotype vaccine virus to fully susceptible sentinel pigs could be demonstrated (Astrup and Riising, 2002) .\n\nThe classification of the positive results obtained by nonaplex RT-PCR and DV PCR, respectively were mostly approved by sequencing. The nucleotide identity with the corresponding ORF of the Porcilis 1 PRRS strain in 12 samples was 99.1 to 100%. For PRRS virus isolates it is generally accepted that if two isolates have a nucleotide identity in the ORF5 gene !98% they are closely related (Collins, 1999) . Therefore it can be assumed that these isolates are derived from the Porcilis 1 PRRS strain. The marked differences in sequence identity between isolates categorised either as DV vaccine (!99.1%) or wild-type ( 91.7%) showed that misclassification of recombinant or mutated vaccine strain isolates probably not have impaired the results of this study.\n\nSequencing of 64 isolates classified as NA genotype virus isolates by nonaplex RT-PCR showed that the virus in 55 samples had a nucleotide identity of 98-100% to the corresponding ORF of Ingelvac 1 PRRS MLV. As NA genotype PRRS virus was not indigenous in Germany until introduced with the vaccine, the high nucleotide identities with the Ingelvac 1 PRRS MLV suggest that they are derivatives of this vaccine. Interestingly, 9 of the isolates had nucleotide identities only between 96.0 and 97.8% with the ORF5 of Ingelvac 1 PRRS MLV. This reflects the continuous mutations of the viral genome (Allende et al., 2000; Goldberg et al., 2003) . It is likely that divergence of the nucleotide sequences of these isolates will continue with time.\n\nIn conclusion, the eradication of PRRSV from infected herds requires a more fundamental knowledge of the dynamics of PRRS virus infection and epidemiology (Cho and Dee, 2006) . The results of this study show that this is not only needed for the PRRS wild-type virus but also for live vaccine viruses. Obvious differences in the potential of spontaneous spread of different PRRS vaccine viruses should be considered when choosing vaccines to be used in an eradication program."}
