Diarrhea in most of these children is caused by a mere handful of infectious agents (Kirk et al., 2015; Kotloff et al., 2013) . In particular, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) is responsible for over 81 million cases of diarrhea per year of which 17 million cases are diagnosed in children (Kirk et al., 2015) . Typical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (tEPEC) is a common bacterial cause of diarrhea in children and, compared to other common enteropathogens, is associated with the highest hazard of death (Kotloff et al., 2013) . While tEPEC is largely undisputed as a cause of diarrhea, the pathogenicity of atypical EPEC (aEPEC), which lack the plasmid responsible for expression of bundle forming pili, is confounded by frequent observation in children with and without signs of diarrhea (Barletta et al., 2011; Enserink et al., 2014; Estrada-Garcia et al., 2009) . A rising incidence of aEPEC infection in both developing and developed countries has renewed controversy over the pathogenicity of aEPEC in children (Hu and Torres, 2015) .\n\nSimilar to children in developing countries, there exists a high mortality rate associated with diarrheal disease in young kittens residing in animal shelters across the United States and elsewhere (Ghosh et al., 2013; Murray et al., 2008) . We recently identified that shelter kittens have a high prevalence of aEPEC carriage (Ghosh et al., 2013; Watson et al., 2017) . The kitten carriage mirrors observations of aEPEC carriage in children by being observed in both sick and healthy individuals but with a significantly higher bacterial burden in individuals with diarrhea as compared to those with asymptomatic infection (Barletta et al., 2011; Watson et al., 2017 (Glotfelty et al., 2014; Hu and Torres, 2015; McNamara et al., 2001; Thanabalasuriar et al., 2010) . While the cellular mechanisms have been well characterized in vitro, the pathogenesis of the infection in vivo is less well understood. Kittens with diarrhea-related death which test positive for aEPEC have more severe inflammation and epithelial injury within the small intestine and more often require parenteral fluid therapy compared to kittens with diarrhea-related death and negative test results for aEPEC (Watson et al., 2017) .\n\nWe have previously demonstrated, in an autopsy study of kitten mortality, that aEPEC colonize the intestinal epithelium and this is associated with changes in the predominant species of the mucosa-associated enterococci (Ghosh et al., 2013) . Specifically, prevalence of a major\n\ncommensal species, Enterococcus hirae, was replaced by Enterococcus faecalis. Experimental animal models of EPEC infection similarly suggest a strong influence of the microbiome and specific members of the microbiome on disease outcome (Vong et al., 2015; Walsham et al., 2016; Wlodarska et al., 2011) . Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to determine if aEPEC is sufficient to cause diarrhea or intestinal dysfunction in kittens with experimentally-induced infection and the influence of a disrupted intestinal microbiota on disease susceptibility. We additionally examined the effect of a probiotic formulation of feline Enterococcus hirae on the observed manifestations of aEPEC-induced disease. Our rationale was that identification of aEPEC as a primary cause of intestinal disease in kittens could provide a unique opportunity for development of life-saving treatment strategies for both kittens and possibly children with aEPEC infection. In particular, demonstration of a positive impact of commensal bacteria in treatment or prevention of aEPEC-associated disease would be of immediate benefit to improving the burden of diarrhea in infected kittens.\n\nSix-week-old kittens of either sex were obtained from a commercial vendor. A fecal sample was obtained from each kitten and sent to a commercial laboratory (IDEXX Laboratories Inc, \n\nTo determine the impact of an altered gut microbiota on susceptibility to aEPEC-associated intestinal disease, two separate groups of kittens were studied a shown in Figure 1 . Group A included eight kittens that did not receive antibiotics prior to experimental infection with aEPEC.\n\nAfter completion of the study in Group A kittens, a second group (Group B) of eight kittens were administered oral antibiotics prior to experimental infection with aEPEC. The antibiotics administered were amoxicillin/clavulanate (12.5 mg/kg twice daily) (Zoetis, Parsippany, New Jersey) and pradofloxacin (7.5 mg/kg once daily) (Bayer, Shawnee Mission, Kansas) given orally for 5 consecutive days followed by a washout period of 2 days prior to experimental infection.\n\nThese antibiotics were selected to broadly disrupt the native gut microbiota by providing\n\nbroad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nAs this study was an exploratory study on a bacterium of unknown pathogenicity in cats, we included 3 serologically and genetically distinct isolates of feline aEPEC in our experimental infection. Our rationale for selecting these 3 aEPEC was that they were each isolated from a kitten that died with diarrhea (Watson et al., 2017) \n\nGenomic DNA from each aEPEC isolate was examined by PCR for the presence of virulence-associated genes spanning the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). Included were genes that encode proteins of the T3SS, including an ATPase (escN) and a translocated protein (escV) and the LEE regulator (ler). Also selected for PCR was the non-LEE gene lymphocyte inhibitory factor (lifA) (otherwise known as enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) factor for adherence (efa1)). All conventional PCR assays were performed using previously published primer sequences and reaction conditions (Hazen et al., 2013; Kyaw et al., 2003; Narimatsu et al., 2010; Sharma and Zuerner, 2004 \n\nAn inoculum of 10 8 cfu for each aEPEC used in experimental infections was chosen based on estimated burden of aEPEC in kittens with diarrhea, survival of aEPEC under simulated gastric conditions, and previously published inoculum sizes. We used qPCR data obtained from amplification of eae from the fecal DNA of naturally infected kittens and its application to a previously developed standard curve for the relationship between the cycle threshold (Ct) of eae and CFU of aEPEC (Watson et al., 2017) to estimate the burden of aEPEC carriage in kittens with diarrhea. To determine the influence of the gastric environment on survival of aEPEC, growth of the aEPEC isolates was quantified under conditions designed to simulate the volume, acidity, ion composition, and pepsin concentration of feline gastric contents (Chandler et al., 1997) . Briefly, a mixture of all 3 aEPEC isolates was inoculated into each of two 50 ml conical tubes containing 5 milliters of buffer. The buffer consisted of 2 solutions (0.2 M KCl and 0.2 M HCl) that were combined to achieve a target pH of 2 followed by the addition of 0.05 mg/ml pepsin. To replicate the vehicle intended for use in delivery of the experimental aEPEC inoculum, \u00bc teaspoon of canned cat food (Hill's \u00ae Science Diet a/d) was included in each tube. The solution was incubated in a shaking water bath (30 RPM) at 37\uf0b0C for 2 hours to simulate gastric temperature and emptying time (Chandler et al., 1997) . Serial dilutions of the original inoculum and aliquots obtained after \"infection\" of the simulated gastric environments were plated and bacteria colonies counted to establish the CFU/ml of aEPEC prior to and after incubation in the gastric environment. Isolates obtained post-incubation were not identified by pulsotype or serotype.\n\nKittens were examined daily for clinical signs of illness including measurement of body weight, food consumption, and fecal consistency. Rectal temperature and heart rate were obtained\n\nevery other day. Fecal consistency was scored using published criteria (Nestl\u00e9-Purina, St. Louis, Missouri) with scores ranging from 1 (very hard and dry) to 7 (watery with no texture). Fecal wet weight, a quantifiable measurement of fecal water content, was determined by obtaining an initial fecal weight followed by desiccation of feces at 60\u00b0C for 24 hours. Dried feces were weighed and the equation \u2212 100 ( = initial fecal weight and = dried fecal weight) was used to calculate a % fecal wet weight.\n\nEach kitten had a fecal culture performed every other day for detection of aEPEC shedding.\n\nFecal material was diluted in sterile PBS and plated on MacConkey agar. Eight morphologically representative E. coli colonies were subcultured onto LB agar plates and biochemical tests including indole, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase, and oxidase (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were used to presumptively identify bacteria as E. coli. Each of the eight E.\n\ncoli isolates was frozen in 50% LB-glycerol freezing media and stored at -80\u00b0C. The DNA was evaluated for eae using qPCR with previously published primers and reaction conditions (Franck et al., 1998) . Three EPEC isolates obtained from each kitten on day 3 post-infection were further characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Molecular detection of aEPEC, by means of qPCR amplification of eae from fecal DNA, was performed every other day prior to infection and daily for 7 days post-infection. DNA extractions were performed using a commercial kit (Zymo Research Corp. Irvine, CA) and stored at -80\u00b0C prior to use.\n\nPulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed according to the PulseNet protocol. Briefly, overnight cultures of aEPEC were equilibrated in cell suspension buffer solution to an absorbency of 1.08-1.1 at a wavelength of 610 nm and mixed with 1% Seakem gold agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for plug formation. The plugs were sectioned to an equal size with a width of 2-mm and then individually digested with restriction enzyme XbaI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Plugs were embedded into an agarose gel and restriction fragments were separated by electrophoresis at 6 volts/cm for 19 hours. Standardization across gels was accomplished by including Salmonella enterica serotype Braenderup H9812 digested with XbaI in each gel. Gels were stained with a commercially available DNA stain (GelRed, Biotium, Fremont, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol and imaged with a UV imager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Gel images were subsequently inserted into and analyzed by BioNumerics software (Applied Maths, Inc., Austin, TX).\n\nIntestinal function testing was performed on each kitten on day 6 of acclimation and again on day 4 post-infection with aEPEC as shown in Figure 1 . At each time, kittens were lightly anesthetized by mask inhalation of isofluorane gas and then orogastrically intubated for administration of a mixture of iohexol (Klenner et al., 2009 ) and D-xylose (Eberts et al., 1979) .\n\nDoses used for iohexol and D-xylose were extrapolated from previously published studies (Klenner et al., 2009; Nix et al., 1993) . The final mixture contained 2 ml of a 350 mg/ml solution of iohexol (Omnipaque, GE Healthcare, Princeton NJ), 0.5 g of D-xylose (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.,\n\nSt. Louis, MO), and sufficient sterile water to achieve a total solution volume of 11 ml. At 1.5\n\nhours post-gavage, kittens were again lightly anesthetized by mask inhalation of isofluorane gas\n\nand a 1 ml whole blood sample was collected by jugular venipuncture. Blood samples were allowed to clot for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7 g for 20 minutes to separate the serum from the red blood cells. Serum was stored at -20\u00b0C prior to batch assay.\n\nSerum D-xylose concentrations were measured using a phloroglucinol assay as previously described (Eberts et al., 1979) . The colorimetric reagent was composed of 0.25 g phloroglucinol (Sigma-Aldrich, Corp., St. Louis, MO), 50 ml of glacial acetic acid, and 5 ml HCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Twenty microliters of serum from each kitten was mixed with 2 ml of the color reagent and maintained at 100\u00b0C for 4 minutes and then absorbency at 554 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer (BioTek Synergy 2, Biotek US, Winooski, VT). Standard dilutions of D-xylose in feline serum (Immunoreagents, Raleigh, NC) ranging from 3.125 mg/dl to 100 mg/dl were used to create a standard curve for each reaction. The direct effect of aEPEC bacteria on D-xylose concentration was examined by co-culture of aEPEC (10 8 CFU each) in fresh LB containing D-xylose (5 mg/ml) at 37\uf0b0C for 2 hours in triplicate. D-xylose remaining after incubation with aEPEC was measured using the phloroglucinol assay. The effect of glucose on the D-xylose assay was determined by performing the assay on feline serum with standard dilutions of glucose. A commercially available ELISA (BioPhysics Assay Laboratory Inc. Worcester, MA) was used to determine serum iohexol concentrations following the manufacturer protocol (Frias et al., 2012; Klenner et al., 2009 ).\n\nAfter a 1 week duration of post-infection observation, kittens were treated with oral pradofloxacin (7.5 mg/kg) (Bayer, Shawnee Mission, Kansas) once a day for 7 days to eliminate aEPEC carriage. At the end of the antibiotic treatment, absence of shedding of aEPEC was established by negative results of fecal culture for aEPEC.\n\nFor each experimental group of 8 kittens, individuals were randomly and equally divided into two separate rooms containing 4 kittens each. Kittens in one room received a probiotic while those in the other received placebo/vehicle. The investigators were blinded as to which room of kittens received the vehicle versus the probiotic. The administered probiotic was manufactured from a single, well-characterized isolate of feline Enterococcus hirae. The isolate (1002-2) was cultured from the mucosa-associated flora of the ileum from a healthy kitten in which histological evidence of E. hirae attachment to the intestinal epithelium was documented. The isolate lacked all virulence characteristics, the results of which were previously reported (Ghosh et al., 2013) .\n\nThe selected isolate of feline E. hirae was prepared for use as a probiotic by culturing in Biostat B-plus reactors fed with MB medium containing 20 g/L glucose using a variable speed pump (Bruno-Barcena et al., 1998) . The dilution rate (D=0.17 h -1 ), temperature (37\u00b0C), and pH were confirmed by plating on M17 agar and incubating at 37\u00b0C for 72 hours. For each sample, three plates were prepared from each dilution and recorded as the average of three independent counts. Finalized probiotic and vehicle (bacteriological peptone) were stored at -80\u02daC.\n\nAliquots containing 10-15 mg of probiotic powder (2.85 -4.28 \uf0b4 10 8 CFU of E. hirae) or vehicle were prepared under sterile conditions on a single day and stored at -80\u00b0C until needed.\n\nOne extra aliquot was prepared and plated to confirm CFU count. To confirm survival in a gastric environment, 2 additional aliquots were incubated in a simulated gastric environment as described for aEPEC. On each morning of administration, the aliquots were thawed, mixed with 100 \uf06dl of sterile water, and inoculated into \u00bc teaspoon of canned cat food. The timing of administration of E. hirae or vehicle in relation to other interventions in the study of each experimental group is shown in Figure 1 .\n\nFecal culture for isolation of enterococci was performed every other day over the duration of the study. Fecal material was mixed with sterile PBS and plated on m-Enterococcus (BD Difco\u2122, Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA) plates. Five individual isolates of enterococci were subcultured and each isolate was frozen in 50% LB-glycerol and stored at -80\u00b0C. DNA from each isolate was liberated from bacteria by heating at 100\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Enterococci were identified as E. hirae by means of PCR using primers targeting the transglycosylase gene sequence specific to the species (murG) (Arias et al., 2006) . Quantitative PCR for murG was performed to determine the amount of E. hirae DNA present in fecal DNA from each kitten. Amplifications were performed with an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 2 minutes, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 3 minutes.\n\nData were tested for normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and equal variance (Leven median test) and analyzed using parametric or nonparametric statistics as appropriate.\n\nSignificant differences in proportion of observations between groups was analyzed using Chisquare and Fisher exact tests. Differences in the mean or median values of continuous data between groups of kittens were analyzed using Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney rank sum test, respectively. Changes in absorption of D-xylose, permeability to iohexol, and % fecal wet weight between baseline and post-infection measurements were analyzed using Student's paired t-test.\n\nAnalyses were conducted using commercially available software (Sigmaplot 12, Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA or Prism 7, GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) and significance was assigned a p-value of < 0.05.\n\nUsing previously reported qPCR cycle threshold values for amplification of eae from the feces of 18 kittens with aEPEC carriage (Watson et al., 2017) , we estimated that naturally infected kittens shed a range of 3.5 x 10 3 CFU to 2.0 x 10 8 CFU (median of 1.8 \uf0b4 10 6 CFU) of aEPEC per 100 mg feces. Based on these findings, an inoculation dose of 10 8 CFU per aEPEC isolate was chosen for use in experimental infections. A mixture containing all 3 experimental aEPEC isolates maintained bacterial quantity over a 2 hour incubation time in the simulated gastric environment (average CFU pre-incubation = 3.3 10 7 , post-incubation = 2.95 \uf0b4 \uf0b410 7 ).\n\nDuring pre-experimental screening, 4/8 (50%) kittens in Group A were identified with preexisting (vendor-origin) aEPEC carriage based on results of fecal culture and in an additional 2 kittens based on PCR amplification of eae in fecal DNA. In effort to eliminate pre-existing aEPEC carriage in Group B kittens, queens and their litters were proactively screened by PCR to confirm absence of eae in fecal DNA prior to purchase from the vendor. Despite obtaining kittens from only eae-negative queens, 2/8 (25%) Group B kittens were confirmed to be culture positive for aEPEC on arrival (Supplementary Table 1 ). \n\nFollowing experimental infection, all kittens shed aEPEC, as determined both by direct isolation of aEPEC colonies from feces and by qPCR amplification of eae from fecal DNA ( Figure   3 ). Using the cycle threshold values for eae to estimate CFU of aEPEC, Group A kittens shed significantly higher CFU of aEPEC in feces on day 3 post-infection (median, 1.25 \uf0b4 10 7 ; range,\n\n7.64 \uf0b4 10 5 -6.31 \uf0b4 10 7 ) compared to Group B kittens (median, 2.74 \uf0b4 10 5 ; range, 6.64 \uf0b4 10 4 -2.04 \uf0b4 10 6 ) (P=0.002; Mann-Whitney rank sum test).\n\nAlthough three different pulsotypes of aEPEC were administered to each kitten for induction of experimental infection, only one of these pulsotypes (isolate 53-1, Figure 2 ) was subsequently shed. Among the 6 kittens in Group A that also harbored a vendor-origin aEPEC \n\nGroup A kittens did not receive antibiotics prior to aEPEC infection ( Figure 1A ).\n\nExperimental infection of Group A kittens with aEPEC did not result in significant changes in food consumption, body weight gain, rectal temperature, or heart rate (Supplementary Figure 1) .\n\nNo significant changes in fecal consistency score or percent fecal wet weight were observed in Group A kittens following experimental aEPEC infection ( Figure 4A ).\n\nDespite an absence of changes in fecal consistency score or wet weight, experimental aEPEC carriage in Group A kittens was associated with a significant decrease in intestinal absorption of D-xylose and a significant decrease in intestinal permeability to iohexol ( Figure 5A and 5B). Importantly, direct culture of aEPEC with D-xylose (5 mg/ml) for 2 hours in vitro did not result in a decrease in D-xylose concentration (post-aEPEC incubation D-xylose, 4.7 and 4.8 mg/ml) and serum glucose concentration had no significant impact on D-xylose assay results (Supplementary Figure 2) .\n\nTo determine if perturbation of the resident intestinal microbiota increases susceptibility of kittens to aEPEC-associated clinical disease, Group B kittens were treated with antibiotics for 5 days followed by a 2-day washout period prior to experimental infection with aEPEC ( Figure   1B ). Fecal aerobic cultures performed during antibiotic administration confirmed an absence of any Gram-negative bacteria and diminished numbers of enterococcus bacteria were observed when feces were cultured on m-Enterococcus agar. During treatment with antibiotics, significant increases in both fecal consistency score and percent wet weight of feces were observed. These measurements returned to normal over the 2-day antibiotic washout period prior to introduction of experimental aEPEC infection ( Figure 4B ).\n\nSimilar to Group A kittens, infection of kittens in Group B with aEPEC had no significant effect on food consumption, body weight gain, rectal temperature, or heart rate (Supplementary Figure 3) . However, significant increases were observed in both fecal score and percent wet weight of feces after administration of aEPEC ( Figure 4B ). Group B kittens also had decreases in\n\nabsorption of D-xylose and permeability to iohexol after administration of aEPEC, however these changes were not statistically significant ( Figure 5C and 5D ).\n\nWe have previously shown that E. hirae is the dominant member of the mucosa-associated enterococci in the small intestine of healthy kittens (Ghosh et al., 2013) . To determine the specific influence of E. hirae on susceptibility of kittens to aEPEC-associated disease, both groups of kittens were randomized to receive either a probiotic formulation of E. hirae or vehicle. Prior to administration of the probiotic, each kitten's feces were determined to be culture negative for E.\n\nhirae but qPCR positive for the presence of the species-specific murG gene of E. hirae. In Group A kittens, probiotic or vehicle were administered orally once a day for 5 days prior to aEPEC infection ( Figure 1A ). Kittens that received the probiotic shed cultivable E. hirae in feces and had a significantly greater quantity of murG in feces compared to kittens that received only the vehicle ( Figure 6 ). On day 5 of probiotic administration, 3 of the 4 kittens receiving the probiotic were fecal culture positive for E. hirae with an average of 4 (range 0 to 5) out of 5 enterococcus isolates confirmed as E. hirae. In comparison, none of the kittens receiving the vehicle were fecal culture positive for E. hirae. In Group B kittens, probiotic or vehicle were administered orally once a day for 9 days beginning immediately after antibiotic-induced disruption of the intestinal microbiota and continuing throughout the period of aEPEC carriage ( Figure 1B) . Results of murG qPCR and fecal culture for E. hirae in these kittens was highly variable (Supplementary Figure 4) . On day 5 of probiotic administration, 3 of the 4 kittens receiving the probiotic were fecal culture positive for E. hirae with an average of 2 (range 0 to 4) out of 5 enterococcus isolates confirmed as E. hirae.\n\nIn comparison, 2 of the kittens receiving the vehicle were culture positive for E. hirae with an average of 1 (range 0 to 3) out of 5 enterococcus isolates confirmed as E. hirae. No adverse health effects such as changes in food intake, body weight, rectal temperature, or heart rate were observed to differ between kittens administered E. hirae compared to those that received vehicle.\n\nKittens that were administered E. hirae had either a significantly greater decrease in intestinal permeability to iohexol (Group A; Figure 7A ) or lower permeability to iohexol at the post-infection time-point (Group B; Figure 7B ) compared to kittens that received only the vehicle.\n\nNo differences were observed in the absorption of D-xylose after infection with aEPEC between kittens receiving E. hirae versus vehicle. In Group B kittens that were pretreated with antibiotics to disrupt the intestinal microbiota prior to aEPEC infection, those that received the E. hirae probiotic had a non-significantly lower fecal wet weight (mean \u00b1 SD = 67 \u00b1 2%) on day 3 postinfection compared to kittens that received the vehicle (70 \u00b1 3%) (P=0.055; Students't-test) ( Figure   7C ). The effects of E. hirae on intestinal permeability and fecal wet weight were not associated with any change in the apparent burden of aEPEC carriage based on estimated CFU in feces ( Figure 3 ).\n\nOn day 8 following aEPEC infection, all kittens were treated orally once a day with the fluoroquinolone pradofloxacin (7.5 mg/kg, Bayer, Shawnee Mission, Kansas) for a duration of 7 days. Pradofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, was selected based on antimicrobial susceptibility of all 3\n\naEPEC isolates to fluoroquinolones (i.e. enrofloxacin and marbofloxacin)(supplementary Table   2 ). On the 7 th day of antibiotic treatment, fecal aerobic cultures were negative for presence of aEPEC. Likewise, no eae was amplified from the fecal DNA of any kitten at this time point.\n\nResults of this study have demonstrated that kittens experimentally-infected with aEPEC have sustained shedding of aEPEC and in quantities similar to that observed in naturally infected kittens (Watson et al., 2017) and children (Barletta et al., 2011) with diarrhea. A major objective of this study was to determine the pathogenicity of aEPEC in kittens. In the absence of an imposed disruption of the intestinal microbiota, healthy purpose-bred kittens (Group A) remained clinically asymptomatic after experimental aEPEC infection. In contrast, kittens pretreated with antibiotics to disrupt the intestinal microbiota (Group B) demonstrated significant increases in fecal scores and wet weights consequent to administration of aEPEC. These observations suggest an important role of the intestinal microbiota in influencing susceptibility to disease associated with aEPEC administration. These findings are similar to those observed in mice infected with the EPEC related pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium, where pretreatment with antibiotics increases the severity of infection and this is associated with greater numbers of bacteria adhering to the epithelium (Wlodarska et al., 2011) . We have previously shown that aEPEC adhere to the intestinal epithelium of kittens that have died from diarrhea (Ghosh et al., 2013; Nicklas et al., 2010; Watson et al., 2017) . However, we did not examine adherence of aEPEC in the kittens in this study because they did not undergo euthanasia. Increases in intestinal water loss by these kittens could reflect a nonspecific effect of E. coli administration, or alternatively the instigation of diarrheal mechanisms dependent on bacterial attachment. These mechanisms include inactivation of SGLT-1, inhibition\n\nof both NHE3 and the Cl -/HCO3exchanger SLC26A3, and internalization of aquaporins, resulting in impaired sodium, chloride, and water absorption by intestinal epithelial cells (Dean et al., 2006; Gill et al., 2007; Guttman et al., 2007; Hodges et al., 2008) .\n\nIn addition to an impact of the intestinal microbiota in determining disease susceptibility, it is noteworthy that only one experimental isolate (53-1; O153:H21) established carriage in these kittens. Additionally, in a subset of kittens identified as harboring their own \"vendor-origin\" aEPEC, that isolate (K5-1; O88:H-) could outcompete the experimentally-introduced strains. In comparing the presence of conserved genes spanning the locus of enterocyte attachment and effacement (escN, escV, ler) or previously associated with diarrhea pathogenesis (efa1/lifA) (Cepeda-Molero et al., 2017; Slinger et al., 2017) , we observed no unique differences between the experimental isolates involved in this study. The lack of molecular detection of escN and ler in the \"vendor-origin\" aEPEC may indicate that the T3SS is not functional in these isolates. Further genomic and phenotypic analysis of the experimental and vendor-origin isolates could provide further insight into virulence attributes (e.g. colicin production, T3SS functionality) capable of influencing carriage of some isolates and not others.\n\nIn an effort to gain further mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of aEPEC carriage in kittens, but within the confines of a non-terminal study, we quantified intestinal absorptive and barrier function in vivo in kittens before and after experimental infection with aEPEC. These studies were conducted by oral administration of D-xylose and iohexol followed by measurement of their appearance in serum. The results demonstrated a significant effect of aEPEC administration on intestinal absorption and permeability. D-xylose is an exogenous monosaccharide whose oral absorption requires transport across the intestinal epithelium transcellularly via the sodium-glucose transporter SGLT-1 (Alvarado, 1966) or via passive (Ohkohchi et al., 1986) . The concentration of D-xylose in serum following oral administration reflects the absorptive capacity of the intestinal epithelium. Therefore, our measurement of lower serum concentrations of D-xylose after, compared to before, aEPEC infection supports the onset of significant intestinal malabsorption. While we did not perform a histological examination of the intestines of kittens in this study, intestinal malabsorption could reflect a non-specific effect of E. coli administration, or alternatively the functional consequence of a number of cell-based mechanisms of EPEC pathogenesis including effacement of microvilli (Moon et al., 1983) , villus blunting due to loss of epithelial cell numbers (Fagundes-Neto et al., 1997) , or a specific inhibitory effect of EPEC effector proteins on SGLT-1 (Dean et al., 2006) . It is also possible that aEPEC promoted changes in intestinal motility or in the host microbial community composition that negatively influenced the absorption of D-xylose. This study also demonstrated that kittens experimentally infected with aEPEC had significantly decreased intestinal permeability to iohexol. Iohexol is a nonionic, water-soluble, radiocontrast agent whose oral absorption requires passive diffusion through paracellar pathways between adjacent intestinal epithelial cells (Frias et al., 2012; Gerova et al., 2011) . Our observation that intestinal permeability to iohexol decreased following aEPEC infection in kittens was somewhat unexpected as cell culture studies show that tEPEC increases tight junction permeability by injecting effector proteins (e.g. EspF, EspG1/G2, NleA and Map) into host cells in vitro (Glotfelty et al., 2014; McNamara et al., 2001; Thanabalasuriar et al., 2010) . It is possible that the decrease in intestinal permeability observed in vivo in these kittens reflects a non-specific effect of E. coli, or the presence of additional influences of aEPEC on epithelial surface area. For example, children with attaching and effacing E. coli often have villus blunting which reduces the overall surface area of paracellular pathway (Fagundes-Neto et al., 1997; Hyun et al., 1995) . Recent studies of infants with\n\nenvironmental enteropathy demonstrate that total epithelial surface area has a greater influence on translocation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) than does the presence of overt epithelial defects and tight junction leakage that were documented using confocal laser endomicroscopy (Kelly et al., 2016) .\n\nA final objective of this study was to explore the potential benefit of a member of the healthy intestinal microbiota on intestinal defense against the adverse effects of aEPEC administration in these kittens. We have previously established that Enterococcus hirae is the predominant mucosa-adherent enterococci species residing in the small intestine of healthy kittens (Ghosh et al., 2013; Nicklas et al., 2010) . Moreover, in kittens with terminal illness, in which aEPEC colonization of the epithelium is prevalent, E. hirae is replaced by increases in mucosal colonization with genotypically diverse, virulent, and antimicrobial-resistant E. faecalis (Ghosh et al., 2013) . This observation is strikingly similar to studies of C. rodentium in interleukin 22\n\nreceptor knockout (IL-22ra1 -/-) mice where opportunistic mucosal colonization by virulent E.\n\nfaecalis promotes a greater burden of attachment of C. rodentium to the intestinal epithelium (Pham et al., 2014) . Results of this study demonstrated that a probiotic formulation of E. hirae was highly effective in promoting intestinal colonization and fecal shedding of live E. hirae during administration. In kittens with experimental aEPEC carriage, E. hirae appeared to exert its most significant influence by promoting a decrease in intestinal permeability. This decrease in permeability may indicate an enhancement of the barrier function promoted by E. hirae. While the specific mechanism of this observation was not established by this study, others have shown that the lipoteichoic acid of E. hirae is able to protect against loss of epithelial tight junction function induced by TNF-\uf061 (Miyauchi et al., 2008) . Additionally, E. hirae can limit the secretion of inflammatory mediators induced by LPS (Arokiyaraj et al., 2014; Miyauchi et al., 2008) and exerts\n\nbactericidal effects against numerous pathogens including E. coli and E. faecalis (Miyauchi et al., 2008) .\n\nA number of limitations of this study are worthy of discussion. Most importantly, we did not include a control group of kittens infected with non-pathogenic E. coli at a similar dose (i.e. 3\n\nx 10 8 CFU). Including this control group would have allowed for differentiation between the specific influences of aEPEC and possible nonspecific effects of ingesting a relatively high dose of similar bacteria. Additional studies will be needed to answer this question. Our study utilized a relatively small sample size (n=8) of kittens in each group. These samples sizes were further diminished by inclusion within each group of a subset of kittens receiving either an E. hirae probiotic or placebo. Despite these conservative numbers, statistically significant differences were disclosed for each of the major objectives of the study. Kittens pretreated with antibiotics had decreases in intestinal absorption and permeability of D-xylose and iohexol, respectively.\n\nHowever, these measurements were not significantly different due to a higher variability in the data collected from kittens that had received treatment with antibiotics. Differences in the baseline values between the kittens in Group A and Group B made it difficult to assess a comparison of severity of intestinal barrier dysfunction between kittens with a \"normal\" versus disrupted bacterial flora prior to aEPEC infection, respectively. Nonetheless, these studies support that a \"normal\"\n\nintestinal microbiota may be a strong contributing factor to maintaining an asymptomatic aEPEC carriage. To limit the number of animals used, we did not measure intestinal function in an uninfected group of kittens to control for any extraneous effect of time (11-12 days) between the pre-and post-infection measurements of intestinal absorption or permeability. Despite attempts to screen fecal samples from queens and kittens for aEPEC prior to their purchase, a subset of kittens in each experimental group was determined to be carrying a \"vendor-origin\" aEPEC prior to\n\ninclusion in this study. No alternate source of kittens designated as specific pathogen free from aEPEC existed at the time of this study. The impact of preexisting aEPEC on the results of experimental aEPEC infection in these kittens was impossible to ascertain due to the low number of kittens falling into each combination of experimental variables. However, mice infected with C. rodentium can develop an IgG-dependent acquired immunity and decreased colonization upon re-infection (Maaser et al., 2004) . Accordingly it is possible that pathogenic effects of aEPEC in kittens with prior infection was diminished in this study.\n\nIn summary, results of this study identify aEPEC as a potentially influential pathogen in\n\nkittens. An ability of aEPEC to promote intestinal malabsorption may explain the association of the infection with increased odds of mortality in kittens and children with diarrhea (Kotloff et al., 2013; Watson et al., 2017) . The resident intestinal microbiota have an important impact on disease susceptibility, which may in part explain why some kittens and children with the infection remain asymptomatic while others are susceptible to diarrhea (Barletta et al., 2011; Watson et al., 2017) .\n\nFortification of the intestinal microbiota with commensal E. hirae has a potential to ameliorate the effect of aEPEC in kittens and is worthy of further study in susceptible populations.\n\nThe content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the NIH.
