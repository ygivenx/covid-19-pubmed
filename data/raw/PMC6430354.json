{"title": "A SimpleProbe\u00ae real\u2010time PCR assay for differentiating the canine parvovirus type 2 genotype", "body": "Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV\u20102) emerged as a dog pathogen in the late 1970s.1 CPV\u20102 belongs to the Protoparvovirus genus in the family Parvoviridae.2 CPV\u20102 is a nonenveloped, linear single\u2010stranded DNA virus with a genome of approximately 5 kb. This virus is considered to have originated from the feline parvovirus.1 After it emerged, the original type 2 virus develops its antigenic variant through five to six amino acid changes in its VP2 protein. A few years later, a second variant, CPV\u20102b, was discovered,3 and a third variant, CPV\u20102c, was identified in Italy in 20004 and quickly spread through the canine population in that nation,1 as well as in other European,5, 6 Asian7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and American countries.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17\n\n\nClinically diagnosing a CPV\u20102 infection can be difficult due to the various causes of diarrhea from several other canine pathogens. Hence, laboratory tests are essential for confirming the clinical diagnosis. Because a point mutation at the amino acid position 426 in the VP2 protein has been identified to be associated with the different types of CPV\u20102, sequencing analysis by conventional PCR can be utilized to provide details in terms of CPV typing.4 In addition, this amino acid substitution is caused by mutating AAT (2a) to GAT (2b) at nucleotide position 1276 or to GAA (2c) at nucleotide positions 1276 and 1278 in the VP2 gene.4\n\n\nTraditionally, identifying the CPV\u20102 variants has been performed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs),8, 18 PCR\u2010RFLP using enzyme MboII,4 PCR\u2010based methods,19 and sequence analyses. HI testing using MAbs helps to predict CPV\u20102 antigen specificity, which distinguishes the CPV\u20102 variants. Although types 2a and 2b differ in their lack of MAb B4A2 reactivity to CPV\u20102b, this MAb cannot recognize type CPV\u20102c. Thus, a MAb was developed to differentiate the new variant, 2c, from type 2b.8 However, only samples with high HA titers (\u22651:64) can be characterized using MAbs, and several samples containing high viral DNA titers that tested negative or poorly positive by HA have been calculated by real\u2010time PCR.20, 21 In addition, nonhemagglutinating strains have been described.22 The PCR\u2010RFLP assay with enzyme MboII 4 can only identify CPV\u20102c. Both types 2a and 2b are unrecognized by the enzyme and consequently are indistinguishable by utilizing this method; thus, this sequence analysis is often required to definitively characterize the strain, which is more expensive and time\u2010consuming.21 PCR\u2010based methods have been developed to identify type 2, 2a and 2b CPVs 23 by utilizing nucleotide differences between the primers restricted to one base on their 3\u2032 end. However, these mismatches at the 3\u2032 end of the primers would be insufficient to prevent other CPV\u20102 types from amplifying.4 In addition, among the type\u2010specific PCR assays, CPV\u20102c is undetectable, as the Asp426Glu substitution is due to a change (T to A) at the third codon position at nucleotide 1278 of the VP gene, this mutant is recognized erroneously as type 2b using this PCR strategy.4\n\n\nThe minor groove binder (MGB) probe real\u2010time PCR assay was developed to rapidly and unambiguously characterize CPV\u20102 variants.5 The MGB probe assays with two probe designs can recognize single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that exist between types 2b/2b (A1276G) and (T1278A), which determine the presence of amino acids, Asn, Asp and Glu, in types 2a, 2b and 2c, respectively, at residue 426 of the capsid protein.4 Both type 2a/2b and type 2b/2c assays are highly sensitive and specific despite the type 2a\u2010specific probe not discriminating type 2a CPVs from the original type 2. SimpleProbe contains only a single\u2010labeled sensor probe, which can perform the SNP genotyping in human, animal, or plant samples.24, 25, 26, 27 In this study, we compared CPV\u20102 genotyping results obtained by SimpleProbe\u00ae real\u2010time PCR and DNA sequencing analysis.\n\nOne hundred rectal swabs were collected from CPV\u20102 naturally infected dogs from 2015 to 2017 at the Animal Disease Diagnostic Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology. The rectal swab was suspended in a tube containing 1 mL of 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)\u2010treated water. The total DNA was extracted from 300 \u03bcL of the fecal suspension using the Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Geneaid Biotech, New Taipei City, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All clinical specimens were confirmed to be infected with CPV\u20102 by qPCR using SYBR Green.28 DNA sequencing was performed by PCR products, as described by Chiang et al.7\n\n\nTo construct the different CPV\u20102 variants, a partial VP2 gene was amplified as described by Buonavoglia et al.4 Subsequently, the control plasmids were constructed as described by Lin et al.29 The genotypes of all of control clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n\nThe SimpleProbe\u00ae (TIB MOLBIOLGmbH, Berlin, Germany) was designed based on specific features of the CPV\u20102b variant. The primers and probe sequences are listed in Table 1. The 10\u2010\u03bcL reaction mixtures were as follows: 3 mmol/L MgCl2, 3 pmol/L of the probe, 5 pmol/L and 2 pmol/L each of primers Parvo\u2010F and Parvo\u2010A, respectively, 1 \u03bcL of 10\u00d7 Light Cycler 480 Genotyping Master mix and 1 \u03bcL of template DNA. The thermal cycling parameters for the LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) were as follows: one cycle at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 10 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 15 seconds, with a fluorescence reading taken at the end of each 72\u00b0C step. A melting curve was generated at the end of the amplification cycles by increasing the temperature from 40\u00b0C to 75\u00b0C. The sensitivity and performance of the SimpleProbe\u00ae assay were evaluated using 10 replications of 10\u2010fold\u2010diluted control plasmid from 102\u2010106, from which the real\u2010time PCR detection limit was determined. In addition, the specificity of the SimplePrboe\u00ae assay was also assessed by testing nucleic acid extracts of canine circovirus, canine coronavirus, canine distemper virus, calicivirus, and rabies virus.\n\nOne hundred DNA samples were analyzed in this study, including 23, 6 and 71 as genotypes 2a, 2b and 2c, respectively (Table 2). Amplifying the DNA prepared from plasmids, CPV\u20102a, CPV\u20102b, and CPV\u20102c, representing the CPV\u20102 amino acid residues at position 426, yielded three distinct melting curve peaks as follows. Plasmid CPV\u20102b had the highest melting peak of 57.9\u00b0C (95% confidence interval [CI]: 57.5\u201058.5\u00b0C), followed by 2c and 2a at 52.6\u00b0C (CI 95%: 52.45\u201053.2\u00b0C) and 50.1\u00b0C (CI 95%: 49.8\u201050.85\u00b0C), respectively (Figure 1).\n\nThe detection limits of the assay were evaluated using 10\u2010fold dilution replicates of plasmids 2a, 2b and 2c, corresponding to an input equivalent to 102\u2010106 DNA copies/\u03bcL. The 10\u2010fold\u2010diluted plasmid tests showed that the SimpleProbe\u00ae assay detected approximately 104 DNA copies/\u03bcL (Table 3). Moreover, DNA extracted from canine circovirus, canine coronavirus, canine distemper virus, calicivirus, and rabies virus did not interfere with the assay (Figure S1).\n\nIn the SimpleProbe\u00ae assay, amplifying the DNAs prepared from the clinical specimens showed three distinct melting curve peaks: CPV\u20102b had the highest melting peak of 57.8\u00b0C (CI 95%: 57.7\u201058.5\u00b0C) (Figure 2B), followed by CPV\u20102c with a slightly lower melting peak of 52.3\u00b0C (CI 95%: 52.2\u201053.2\u00b0C) (Figure 2C) and CPV\u20102a with the lowest peak of 50.2\u00b0C (CI 95%: 50.1\u201050.5\u00b0C) (Figure 2A) (Table 2). All three CPV\u20102 sample genotypes were correctly identified from the melting curve peaks and DNA sequencing (Figure 2A\u2010C).\n\nAll genotyping results from the SimpleProbe\u00ae assay were identical to the DNA sequencing results (Table S1). The specificity of this SimpleProbe\u00ae assay was 100% in all CPV\u20102 genotypes. We also evaluated ten samples that could not be evaluated by DNA sequencing due to low viral loads (cq>35). The SimpleProbe\u00ae assay identified one samples as genotype CPV\u20102c, and the remaining nine samples were negative (data not shown).\n\nDNA sequencing is the gold standard for identifying the CPV\u20102 genotype, despite the fact that it is time\u2010consuming, costly and subject to artificial contamination. Other methods can be used to genotype CPV\u20102, such as the MGB probe assay,30 multiplex real\u2010time PCR assay31 and the high\u2010resolution melting (HRM) curve method.32 However, multiplex real\u2010time PCR and HRM curve method require two to three primer pairs and take at least 4 hours.31, 32 In addition, due to the very short range of melting temperature (0.2\u20100.6\u00b0C), using HRM analysis to differentiate between different genotypes of CPV\u20102 has its limitation.32 To eliminate those weaknesses, we utilized SimpleProbe\u00ae real\u2010time PCR technology to detect the same mutant sequence. The real\u2010time PCR method with SimpleProbe\u00ae technology developed in this study accurately identified CPV\u20102 and differentiated between CPV\u20102a, 2b and 2c (Figure 3). Both genotyping results obtained from DNA sequencing and SimpleProbe\u00ae real\u2010time PCR techniques were in 100% concordance. Using this technique, CPV\u20102a samples (50.2\u00b0C) were easily distinguished from CPV\u20102b (57.8\u00b0C) and CPV\u20102c samples (52.3\u00b0C), based on the relatively large difference in the melting temperature. Therefore, using SimpleProbe\u00ae real\u2010time PCR technology for CPV\u20102 genotyping should be considered.\n\nBecause SimpleProbe\u00ae are not degraded during PCR, genotyping samples based on nucleotide mismatches between targets and probes can be effectively performed by a melting curve analysis33, 34 where different mismatch patterns yield distinct melting curves to accurately assign CPV\u20102 genotype variants. However, this method has disadvantages, such as that the limitation range must be above 103 per reaction for accurate identification, otherwise those that drop to 103 maybe fail. In contrast, if unusual changes within the probe sequence region occur, then SimpleProbe\u00ae may not identify the CPV\u20102 genotype.\n\nThe SimpleProbe\u00ae assay required less time for genotyping than the conventional sequencing method. Moreover, the large sample size could be tested simultaneously, and the SimpleProbe\u00ae assay was cheaper than DNA sequencing. Overall, the SimpleProbe\u00ae assay offers some distinct advantages for genotyping CPV\u20102: (a) it reduces the cost and time required for DNA sequencing; (b) data are easy to interpret; (c) only a single\u2010labeled sensor probe is used; and (d) it offers excellent specificity.\n\nThis study developed a novel method for genotyping CPV\u20102 strains using the SimpleProbe\u00ae real\u2010time PCR assay. This assay is a reliable and sensitive tool for differentiating between the CPV\u20102a, 2b and 2c. This technique may be useful for molecular CPV\u20102 epidemiology studies."}
