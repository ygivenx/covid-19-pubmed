{"title": "Differential Expression of miR-499 and Validation of Predicted Target Genes in the Testicular Tissue of Swine at Different Developmental Stages", "body": "M iRNAs are classes of small, endogenous, noncoding regulatory RNAs that are *22 nucleotides in length (Ma et al., 2012) . They are widely expressed in eukaryotes and participate in the regulation of a variety of functions, including gene expression, developmental timing, organ development, cells proliferation, apoptosis, cell differentiation, fat metabolism, nervous system, and the biological processes of tumors (Cai et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2004; Smalheiser and Torvik, 2005) . Increasing studies have shown that miRNAs are essential for normal spermatogenesis and male fertility. For example, the lack of synthetic miRNA required by Dicerdeficient mice produces an abnormal elongation in their sperm, which results in male sterility (Brueckner et al., 2007; He et al., 2007; Lujambio et al., 2008) . But research of miRNAs in swine testis is seldom. miR-499 is an important aspect of miRNAs, the major function of which is an important regulatory role in the occurrence and development of a variety of cancers (Chu et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013; Brunotto et al., 2014) . Recent studies suggest that a significant association exists between miR-NA499 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and hepato-cellular carcinoma (Chu and Hsieh, 2014) . The overexpression of miRNA499 alone increased the number of beating cells, suggesting that miR-499 may act as a factor promoting cell proliferation (Pisano et al., 2014) . Significant difference expression of miR-499 in immature and mature Junmu no.1 white swine testicular tissue was found by high-throughput sequencing (Lian et al., 2012) . This result suggests that expression of miR-499 maybe chronological in swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages. miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression by complete or incomplete complementary target genes. But a few reports have investigated the target genes of miR-499. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the expressions of miR-499 and its target genes in swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages, and we sought to provide further verification on the relationship between miR-499 and QKI gene.\n\nTissue samples, cell lines, and cell transfection A total of 24 samples, which included 1-day-old, 1-7 month-old swine testicular tissue, were collected from the College of Animal Science, Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China. DNA AND CELL BIOLOGY Volume 34, Number 7, 2015 \u00aa Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. Pp. 464-469 DOI: 10.1089 /dna.2014 .2728 Jilin University swine farm. Animal experiments were done under the guidance of Jilin university animal care and use committee.\n\nThe swine testicular cells were purchased from a company (Boster). Twenty-four hours before transfection, the swine testicular cells were plated at a concentration of *1 \u00b7 10 6 /well into six-well culture plates with DMEM/ HIGH GLUCOSE (GIBCO) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . The DMEM/HIGH GLUCOSE medium was replaced by Opti-MEM serum-free medium (GIBCO) when the cell fusion level reached more than 80%. For luciferase activity detection, 150 mL Opti-MEM serum-free medium (GIBCO) was mixed with 5 mL of LipofectamineTM2000 (Invitrogen) and 1.25 mL 20 mmol of the miR-499 mimics and 500 ng pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI vectors. For expression of miR-499 and QKI gene detection in cells of overexpression miR-499, 150 mL Opti-MEM serum-free medium (GIBCO) was mixed with 5 mL of LipofectamineTM2000 (Invitrogen) and 1.25 mL 20 mmol of the miR-499 mimics and negative control. Next, the transfection mixture was added to each well containing the cells in Opti-MEM serum-free medium after incubation at room temperature for 30 min. The medium was changed to regular cell culture medium after 3-5 h. Transfected cells were used in further assays or RNA/protein extraction.\n\nThe samples of testicular tissue were soaked in 4% formaldehyde for 3 days and then washed in pure water. Staining was done according to the article explanation (Nagata et al., 2007) . Morphology of testicular tissue was determined by microscopic analysis.\n\nFour kinds of bioinformatics software (microRNA.org, miRDB, miRGen, TargetScan) were used to predict the target genes of miR-499. A fragment of 3\u00a2UTR of QKI (1005 bp) containing the putative miR-499 binding site was amplified using 3\u00a2RACE Kit (Takara). Primers were shown in Table 1 . Next, vectors of reporter gene system were constructed. Primers were shown in Table 2 . All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and digestion. Then, miR-499 was co-transfected with vectors of QKI gene. At 48 h after transfection, luciferase activity was detected using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and normalized to Renilla activity. The experimental groups were shown in Table 3 .\n\nRNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and real-time PCR Testis tissue samples from healthy swine specimens were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and Trizol reagent was used to extract total RNA. The cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription with an RT-PCR Kit (Takara) according to the instructions. Primers of miR-499 and its target genes were designed for quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction according to the sequence of NCBI and miRBase14.0 (Table 4 ).\n\nIn the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments, the expression of miR-499 and genes (CYLC1, DMRT1, QKI, XRN2, ZNF313) in the testis was detected in twenty-four samples with each other and each sample repeated thrice. The qPCR mixture included cDNA (2 mL), PCR-Master Mix (10 mL), PCR-F-Primer (0.5 mL), PCR-R-Primer (0.5 mL), and RNase-free H 2 O (7 mL) in a total volume of 20 mL. qPCR was performed in a reaction under the following procedure: 95\u00b0C for 30 s; 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. The expression of miR-499 and genes was detected using the SYBR Green I (Takara) and was analyzed by Eppendorf AG-5341 fluorescence quantitative instrument. The data were analyzed using the SPSS 13.0 software and 2 -DDCT method was used according to the following formula:\n\nHere, 2 -DDCt refers to the relative expression ratio.\n\nTotal protein was extracted from testicular tissue at different developmental stages using RIPA buffer (Boster) following the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Boster). Total protein (35 mg per sample) was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane (Bio-Red Laboratories, Inc.). Immunoblotting was conducted using the following primary antibodies with the suggested dilutions from the manufacturer: anti-QKI (Abcam); anti-b-actin (Abcam). The antibodies were diluted with 5% BSA (Albumin from bovine serum), and the suggested dilutions were 1:200 and 1:1000. The immunoblots were developed using an ECL Advanced Western Blotting Detection Kit (Invitrogen).\n\nThe cells were cultured and transfected in the earlier section. Then, the cells were harvested at 48h after transfection. Total RNA and total protein were extracted from the cells according to the kit manual (BioFlux). Then, the expression of miR-499 and QKI was detected by qPCR. In a further reaction, the expression of QKI in protein levels was detected by western blot. Experimental methods refer to the earlier experiments.\n\nTesticular tissue growth and development with increasing age of swine Morphology of testicular tissue was analyzed by a microscope, which was shown in Figure 1 . The diameter of seminiferous tubules is advanced with the growth of age of swine. With the increase of age, the interstitial connective tissue gradually reduced, and seminiferous tubule gradually developed into a mature one. Spermatogenic cells and sertoli cells gradually moved closer to the basement section of seminiferous tubules. miR-499 and its target genes differentially expressed in swine testes at different developmental stages Target genes of miR-499 were predicted by bioinformatics software, including DMRT1, XRN2, CYLC1, QKI, and ZNF313. miR-499 and its target genes were detected by qPCR in different developmental stages of testis, which were shown in Figure 2 . The expression of miR-499 displayed an increasing trend at 1 day, 1 month, and 2 months of age. After 2 months of age, the expression of miR-499 began to decrease, reaching a minimum level at 7 months of age.\n\nCYLC1 gene expression was low in the young testes but began to rapidly increase at 5 months of age of the testes, resulting in an upward trend from 5 to 7 months of age; the highest expression levels were detected at 7 months of age.\n\nIn contrast, the DMRT1 gene expression levels displayed an overall downward trend, such that the 1-day-old testes exhibited the highest DMRT1 expression. By 5-7 months, its expression in the testicular tissue was slightly increased, but this increase was not significant.\n\nThe QKI gene expression level in the testicular tissue displayed a decreasing trend during the first 3 months, followed by an increasing trend. There was a slight deviation in its expression at 5 months, but this result did not affect the overall trend. The expression of QKI gene in the testes was highest in the 7 month-old swine testis.\n\nThe XRN2 expression levels decreased from 1 day to 1 month of age of the testis, but at 2 months of age, its expression was restored to nearly the identical expression level at 1 day of age. After 2 months, its expression began to decrease, although its expression was highest at the 6 month. But at 7 months of age of the testis, its expression was again reduced.\n\nThe expressions of ZNF313 at 1 day, 1 month, and 2 months of the testis were very low. They increased rapidly at 3 months of age of the testis and then began decreasing until 6 months of age, on which they rapidly increased to their highest expression. At 7 months, the expression levels of ZNF313 were reduced. Correlation analysis revealed that the expression of miR-499 with its target genes had a relationship with QKI (R = -0.305; p < 0.01), ZNF313 (R = -0.217; p < 0.05), CYLC1 (R = -0.300; p < 0.05), XRN2 (R = 0.251; p < 0.05), and DMRT1 (R = -0.014; p > 0.05).\n\nSince expression of miR-499 had a significant negative correlation with QKI gene, the expressions of QKI gene were analyzed by Western blot in swine testes at different developmental stages. The results of b-actin were uniform. The expression of QKI gene was higher expressed in 1-dayold testes than in 1-4 month testes. And its expression increased at 5-7 months of age in swine testes, as shown in Figure 2 . The results of the western blotting analysis were consistent with the qPCR results.\n\nmiR-499 binding site existed in 3\u00a2UTR of QKI gene Amplification of QKI gene 3\u00a2UTR was done with reference to the manual (Takara). The full length of QKI gene 3\u00a2UTR sequence was amplified from DNA as a 1005 bp fragment (Fig. 3) . The pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-mut vector in QKI gene was introduced by fusion PCR amplification ( Fig. 3) , and pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-WT/si vectors were constructed (Fig. 3) . The vectors were confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 3) . The luciferase reporter gene system was used to validate the correlation of miR-499 and QKI. The results showed that luciferase activity of pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-WT with miR-499 was significantly lower than pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-mut and pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-si with miR-499 (Fig. 3) , indicating a target sequence of miR-499 existed on 3\u00a2UTR of QKI gene.\n\nmiR-499 efficiently suppressed QKI gene in swine testicular cells miR-499 and QKI gene were detected in testicular cells by qPCR; the expression of miR-499 in overexpressing miR-499 group was significantly higher than in the normal cells group and negative control group. However, the expression of QKI was the opposite. And miR-499 and QKI gene in the normal cells group and negative control group had no significant difference expression. The experimental results reveal that miR-499 inhibited the expression of QKI gene (Fig. 4) .\n\nmicroRNAs represent a large class of gene regulatory molecules that control fundamental cellular processes in animals. The rapid progress in miRNAs in the past few years illustrates the huge potential of miRNAs for the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases in the near future. miR-143 and miR-223 levels were significantly lower in the morbidly obese group and obese group than the control group (normal BMI or overweight). Obesity leads to alterations in miRNA expression, and miRNA-143 and miR-223s can be used as biomarkers for the metabolic changes in obesity (Kilic et al., 2015) . Studies have shown that miR-NAs may be involved in the regulation of mitosis and gene expression during spermatogenesis. Subsequently, Yan et al. (Grishok et al., 2001; Yi et al., 2003; Okamura et al., 2007;  FIG. 2. Detection of miR-499 and its target genes. In this Figure, (A) RNA extracted and cDNA synthesized. (B) Primers of genes detected. B1-B5, respectively, represented the CYLC1, DMRT1, QKI, XRN2, and ZNF313 gene PCR amplification results. (C) Primers of miR-499 and U6 detected. C1 represent the miR-499, and C2 represent the U6 PCR amplification results. Then, mRNA and protein of miR-499 and its target genes were detected. But only the protein of gene QKI that had a significant negative correlation with miR-499 in mRNA level was detected.\n\nFIG. 1. Tissue section observations. In this figure, we observed the testicular tissue at different development stages by hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. 1-8, respectively, represent 1-dayold testis, 1-7 months of age of testis observations under 100 times magnification, and 9-16, respectively, represent 1-dayold testis, 1-7 months of age of testis observations under 400 times magnification. Ruby et al., 2007) used gene chip technology to determine the miRNA expression patterns in the relatively immature and mature mouse testis. They found that the expression of 19 miRNAs differed significantly between the immature and mature tissues. Of these, 14 miRNAs were unregulated and five miRNAs were downregulated in the immature mouse testis. This result suggested that these miRNAs may affect testicular development or spermatogenesis.\n\nIn this study, morphology of testicular tissue was determined by microscopic analysis. This study also investigated FIG. 4. Overexpression of miR-499. Expressions of miR-499 and QKI gene in cells overexpressing miR-499 and negative control were detected by qPCR, and QKI gene expression was detected by western blot. Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3, respectively, represent the cells transfected with miR-499, miR-499 negative control, and untreated.\n\nFIG. 3. Luciferase reporter assay. In this figure, luciferase reporter vectors were constructed. The special primers were designed: In the fused area, the primer has a complementary area for the DNA piece and also a complementary area for the second DNA piece; normal primer for the nonfused end. The fusions PCR merged fragment P1 (605 bp) and P2 (400 bp). Restriction endonuclease (XhoI and NotI) digested and sequenced were used to ensure the vectors pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI correctly. Then, luciferase activities were detected about miR-499 and vectors of QKI gene. the expression of the miR-499 and its target genes in swine testes at different developmental stages, and it verified the relationship of miR-499 with QKI gene. Correlation analysis revealed that miR-499 targeted the genes QKI (R = -0.305; p < 0.01), ZNF313 (R = -0.217; p < 0.05), CYLC1 (R = -0.300; p < 0.05), XRN2 (R = 0.251; p < 0.05), and DMRT1 (R = -0.014; p > 0.05). The results showed that miR-499 had a significant negative correlation with QKI gene. Based on morphological analysis, the seminiferous tubules were found to grow with increasing age of the swine. By 7 months of age, these tubules reached maximum size. The highest expression of miR-499 was detected in 2 month-old swine testis. And then its expression began to decrease. In contrast, the expression of its target gene QKI was the lowest at 2 month. This finding suggests that miR-499 may be involved in the development of early testicular tissues, while QKI may play an important role in regulation of mature testis development and spermatogenesis.\n\nThis study had some limitations. Indicators of reproductive traits were difficult to measure. So, it was necessary to find an intuitive way to explore the effects of miRNAs on testicular tissue of swine.\n\ning age. 2. QKI was demonstrated to be a target gene of miR-499. 3. miRNA-499 may be associated with testicular tissue maturation and sperm production."}
