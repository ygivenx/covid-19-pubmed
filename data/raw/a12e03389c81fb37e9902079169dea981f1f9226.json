{"title": "LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Comments on ''The corporate author''", "body": "To the Editor:-Fugh-Berman 1 described the unethical practice of soliciting an author for a review prepared by an undisclosed writer. We agree with Tierney and Gerrity's 2 characterization of the problem as failure to disclose the original author(s) and pertinent financial relationships. We also applaud the World Association of Medical Editors (WAME) for recommending that journal editors expand their Information for Authors to indicate that medical writers can be legitimate contributors to manuscripts and to encourage disclosure of their roles and affiliations. 3 Put into practice, this recommendation empowers biomedical communicators to become part of the solution.\n\nWe believe biomedical communicators are in an ideal position to help solve the problem. More than 5,000 biomedical communicators belong to the American Medical Writers Association (AMWA), an educational organization founded in 1940 to promote excellence in biomedical communication and to recommend principles of conduct for its members. The first principle in AMWA's Code of Ethics 4 states, ''Biomedical communicators should recognize and observe statutes and regulations pertaining to the materials they write, edit, or otherwise develop.'' Principle 4 states, in part, ''[Biomedical communicators] should refuse . . . assignments that require unethical or questionable practices.'' AMWA's recently adopted position statement recommends acknowledgment of substantial contributions to scientific publications with disclosure of pertinent relationships. 5 Biomedical communicators who contribute substantially to manuscripts should join the author-writer team at the inception of the project. Under these circumstances, biomedical communicators can encourage authors to adhere to ethical standards while following a logical process-beginning with identifying the main message to be conveyed, targeting the audience, and determining the most appropriate journal for conveying the message.\n\nOne of us (C.W.H.) recently conducted a pilot survey to identify practices of biomedical communicators who contribute substantially to manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. Seventy-three of 221 eligible advertisers in AMWA's freelance directory (33%) participated. More than half indicated that they followed guidelines from AMWA 4,5 (59%) and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 6 (ICMJE) (56%) and encouraged authors and other contributors to follow guidelines from AMWA (56%) and the ICMJE (54%). We plan to expand this survey to assess the experience of more biomedical communicators, the frequency of practices such as those described by Fugh-Berman, 1 In Reply:-If most medical writers, or biomedical communicators, were hired by bad writers with good ideas, I would have no problem with the suggestions made by Dr. Hamilton et al. However, many medical writers are hired by pharmaceutical companies (or indirectly through medical education companies) to flesh out manuscripts prescripted by pharmaceutical companies as part of a marketing strategy.\n\nCertainly all authors, including medical writers, should be acknowledged. But the term ''author'' applies to those who are in fact responsible for the ideas, facts, and perspectives in a paper. The American Medical Writers Association (AMWA) Code of Ethics seems to acknowledge the limitations under which medical writers toil. 1 The first principle cited by Hamilton et al. means that medical writers should obey the law. Principle 3 states, in part, that biomedical educators ''should attempt to prevent the perpetuation of incorrect information.'' These are hardly stellar standards, which makes it rather disheartening that only 59% of survey respondents observe them.\n\nI'm not just picking on medical writers. The researchers who sign sponsored articles understand that they are being paid for ceding control to the sponsor. A researcher who insists on control of a paper will be allowed to make changes, but if changes do not fit the sponsor's agenda, that version of the manuscript will not be published. And an uncooperative sham author cannot expect future assignments.\n\nWhen a sponsoring company determines not only the ideas, facts, and perspectives in a paper, but additionally determines when, where, and whether to publish it, then the sponsor is also an author. In my ideal world, medical journals would simply list sponsoring companies as primary authors. At an absolute minimum, published disclosures should explicitly state that ''author X was paid to write this manuscript on behalf of drug company Z.''-Adriane Fugh-Berman, MD, Complementary and Alternative Medicine Master's Program, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Medicine, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA."}
