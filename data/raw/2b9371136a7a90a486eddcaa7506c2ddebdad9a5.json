{"title": "Anatomy and Neurophysiology of Cough CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report", "body": "-Peripheral mechanisms of cough. A dual-sensory neuron model subserving cough. Extensive studies in animals and humans support the concept that at least two subtypes of primary sensory neurons can induce coughing when stimulated. C-fi ber nociceptors, which have their terminals in and around the mucosa surface of the airways, are sensitive to a wide variety of inhaled or locally produced chemical mediators, which may either activate or sensitize nociceptor nerve endings. Mechanically sensitive \"cough receptors\" are positioned beneath the epithelium in the large airways and are relatively insensitive to most chemical mediators (with the exception of low pH) but are exquisitely sensitive to punctate stimuli delivered to the mucosal surface (for example, inhaled particulate matter). A number of peripherally acting compounds that block nociceptor and or mechanoreceptor activation to reduce coughing are listed in the gray box. TRPA1 5 transient receptor potential A1; TRPV1 5 transient receptor potential vanilloid 1. forms of infl uenza, TB, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Bordetella pertussis , the gram-negative bacteria responsible for whooping cough. Furthermore, in diseases such as asthma, COPD, gastroesophageal refl ux disease (GERD), and rhinosinusitis, cough may become excessive and harmful to the airway mucosa and adversely impact patient quality of life. 5 , 6 Th ese contrasting functions and consequences of cough highlight the importance of balancing therapy-targeting cough, such that the defensive functions of the refl ex are preserved, while limiting the role of cough in spreading harmful illnesses and adversely impacting patient sense of well-being.\n\nMost of our understanding about the aff erent (sensory) neuronal pathways regulating the cough refl ex comes from studies performed in animals. Th ese studies implicate vagal aff erent nerves innervating the larynx, trachea, carina, and large intrapulmonary bronchi with terminations largely confi ned to the airway mucosa, 7 -10 which we describe, as well as their role in regulating cough. In this article we provide an update to the 2006 Diagnosis and Management of Cough: ACCP Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines by detailing the recent research, including an increasing number of studies conducted in human subjects designed to elucidate the anatomic and neurophysiologic components of cough. In addition, we have attempted to provide a clinical perspective with particular emphasis on what is known about cough in patients as well as mechanisms accounting for the excessive coughing and cough hypersensitivity associated with acute, subacute, and chronic conditions associated with cough.\n\nProperties of Airway Aff erent Nerve Subtypes and Evidence for Th eir Potential Role in Regulating Human Cough Bronchopulmonary vagal aff erent nerves arise bilaterally from the inferior (nodose) and superior (jugular) vagal ganglia and diff er in their chemical and mechanical responsiveness, in addition to their anatomic, embryological, and physiologic attributes. 11 , 12 When evaluated in isolation, these attributes are oft en not suffi ciently specifi c to diff erentiate aff erent nerves. When combined, clear patterns of anatomy and physiology emerge that help distinguish specific nerve subtypes ( Fig 1 ) . Understanding the diff erences in vagal aff erent nerve subtypes is critical to understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of cough, and thus the functional, anatomic, and neurochemical attributes of vagal aff erent nerve subtypes are described below.\n\nTh e majority of bronchopulmonary vagal aff erent nerves are unmyelinated C-fi bers. 13 -16 In addition to their conduction velocity ( , 2 m/s), airway vagal aff erent C-fi bers are distinguished from lung stretch receptors by their relative insensitivity to mechanical stimulation and lung infl ation ( Fig 2 ) . C-fi bers are further diff erentiated from lung stretch receptors by their sensitivity to bradykinin and activators of the ion channels, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) (eg, capsaicin, protons), and transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) (eg, ozone, allyl isothiocyanate). Other infl ammatory mediators and environmental irritants that somewhat selectively activate bronchopulmonary C-fi bers include prostaglandin E2, ozone, nicotine, adenosine, and serotonin. 13 -20 Morphologic studies in rats and in guinea pigs have identifi ed aff erent C-fi ber terminations in the airway epithelium as well as other eff ector structures within the airway wall. 21 -24 Such studies are aided by the unique expression of TRPV1 and substance P in rat and guinea pig C-fi bers. Comparable structures have been identifi ed in human airway mucosa and the airway mucosa of other species, including terminals labeled immunohistochemically for TRPV1, but their identity as C-fi ber terminations has not been proven. 25 -28 Considerably less substance P-containing innervation has been localized to human airways, in comparison with that seen in rats and guinea pigs. 26 Th is makes it unlikely that neurokinindependent axonal refl exes play a prominent role in humans (see later).\n\nBronchopulmonary aff erent C-fi ber subtypes have been described in several species. 13 , 15 , 16 Th ese subtypes are diff erentiated by their ganglionic origin (nodose vs jugular), sites of termination in the airways and lungs, chemical sensitivity, neurochemistry, and the refl exes initiated upon their activation. Whether similar physiologic distinctions between bronchial and pulmonary aff erent C-fi bers can be defi ned in humans is unknown.\n\nC-fi bers are activated somewhat selectively by capsaicin, bradykinin, TRPA1 activators, and protons, and each of these stimuli initiate coughing in patients and awake animals. Th e coughing evoked by these stimuli in animals is prevented by prior capsaicin desensitization (which selectively renders C-fi bers unresponsive to subsequent challenges). In animals, these cough responses are inhibited by neurokinin receptor antagonists. As described above, neurokinins, such as substance P, are uniquely expressed by airway C-fi bers in animals. All of these observations provide compelling evidence for an essential role of C-fi bers in cough. 9 , 10 , 29\n\nMore than one-half a century ago, John Widdicombe described a subtype of myelinated vagal aff erent nerves innervating the trachea, mainstem, and segmental bronchi that played an essential role in cough refl exes evoked from the airways mucosa of anesthetized cats. 30 -32 He called these aff erent nerves \"cough receptors, \" a fl awed term, but a term that has persisted in the literature in the nearly 6 decades since. Th is seminal work by Widdicombe has been substantiated in multiple studies since, and it is now well established that, in addition to C-fi bers, a subset of myelinated, mechanically sensitive, capsaicin-insensitive vagal aff erent nerves plays an essential role in cough. 10 , 33 Cough receptors can be diff erentiated from C-fi bers and lung stretch receptors by their axon conduction velocity (5 m/s), which is considerably faster than C-fi bers ( , 1 m/s) but slower than lung stretch receptors ( \u0546 15 m/s). Th ese mechanically sensitive vagal aff erents do not normally express the ion channels TRPV1 or TRPA1 and are, thus, insensitive to the chemical irritants capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate. Th ese aff erents are, however, activated by protons, perhaps through expression of acid-sensing ion channels. In guinea pigs, the cell bodies of the cough receptors are located in the nodose ganglia, whereas the cell bodies of the C-fi bers regulating cough are located in the jugular ganglia. Cough receptors do not synthesize neuropeptides under normal conditions but use glutamate as their primary transmitter at their central terminals in the brainstem. 33 -35 At various times since his original discoveries, Widdicombe referred to the cough receptors by other terms, including rapidly adapting receptors (RARs) (see later) and irritant receptors. 7 , 12 Because they are myelinated and adapt rapidly to a punctate (touch-like, as opposed to stretch-like) mechanical stimulation, it is tempting to conclude that the cough receptors are merely RARs that innervate the extrapulmonary airways. But unlike RARs, which primarily innervate the intrapulmonary airways, the cough receptor terminations are found exclusively in the extrapulmonary airways (larynx, trachea, mainstem bronchi). Also, unlike RARs, the cough receptors are utterly unresponsive to a wide variety of irritants, spasmogens, and autacoids that induce airway smooth muscle contraction and decrease lung compliance, including methacholine, histamine, leukotriene C4, substance P, neurokinin A, 5-hydroxytryptamine, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and adenosine. 10 All of these stimuli have been shown to activate RARs, and yet none of them reliably evokes coughing in animals or in patients. 36 -39 Th e peripheral terminals of cough receptors have been described in guinea pigs ( Fig 3 ) . Th ese terminals are found in abundance in the airway mucosa, assuming a stereotypical position in the airway wall, with complex dendritic arbors that are invariably arranged along the circumferential axis of the airways. 23 Terminations are confi ned to the space between the smooth muscle and the epithelial cell layers. This location for cough receptor terminations may explain the relative insensitivity of cough receptors to epithelium removal or airway smooth muscle contraction. It is of interest that this location in the extracellular matrix is a site of extensive remodeling in several chronic diseases in patients. 40 Comparable structures have been identifi ed in the airway mucosa of other species, including humans. 12 , 41 Pulmonary Stretch Receptors Lung stretch receptors are characterized by their responses to sustained lung infl ation. Both RARs and slowly adapting receptors (SARs) are activated by sustained lung infl ation, but RARs are active primarily during the dynamic phase of lung infl ation, whereas SARs continue fi ring throughout the distension. RARs are also diff erentiated from SARs by their responses to lung defl ation/lung collapse. 11 , 42 -46 Th e anatomy of RAR terminations in the airway wall is unknown. Functional studies of RARs suggest that they terminate within or beneath the epithelium, primarily in the intrapulmonary airways. 31 , 44 Such terminal sites might explain RAR sensitivity to lung collapse and/or lung defl ation, although their responsiveness to alterations in dynamic lung compliance (and thus their sensitivity to bronchospasm) also suggests an association with the airway smooth muscle. Th e sustained activation of RARs, produced by dynamic lung infl ation, bronchospasm, or lung collapse, indicates that adaptation of RARs is not attributable to an electrophysiological adaptation. RARs may, thus, be better defi ned as dynamic airway mechanoreceptors.\n\nSARs are highly sensitive to the mechanical forces imposed upon the lung during breathing. SAR activity increases sharply during inspiration and peaks just prior to the initiation of expiration. 11 , 43 SARs are, thus, believed to be the primary aff erent fi bers involved in the Hering-Breuer infl ation refl ex, which terminates inspiration and initiates expiration when the lungs are adequately inflated. 43 SAR terminal structures have been identified in the intrapulmonary airways and lungs of rabbits. 47 Th ese terminals assume a complex and varying posi tion within the airway wall but are found primarily in the peripheral airways (associated with alveoli or bronchioles). Occasionally, but not uniformly, SAR dendritic arbors are associated with the bronchiolar smooth muscle, in which case they have been termed smooth muscle-associated receptors. Some species variations in SAR termination patterns (eg, extrapulmonary vs intrapulmonary) have been described. 10 , 43 Despite some imprecise semantics, whereby researchers group cough receptors with the intrapulmonary RARs into a single, heterogenous class of vagal aff erent nerves that are called either \"irritant receptors\" or RARs, there is little evidence to suggest that either RARs or SARs, defi ned here as those aff erents responding to sustained lung infl ation, directly initiate coughing upon activation. Both RARs and SARs are spontaneously active during eupnea, and it would be hard to envision a scenario whereby their action potential patterning could change, such that cough and not eupnea is encoded. Electrophysiologic recordings from the vagus nerve in rabbits suggest that SAR activity does not increase prior to or during evoked cough responses. 48 Conversely, SARs are activated by sustained lung infl ations and RARs are activated by negative intraluminal pressures (such as those produced by inspiratory eff orts against a closed glottis), and neither stimulus reliably initiates coughing in animals or in humans. 49 , 50 Bronchospasm is also an eff ective stimulus for RARs but largely ineff ective at initiating cough. 9 , 10 , 36 -39 Both subtypes of stretch receptors play a critical role in regulating respiratory rate and tidal volumes at eupnea, and their activity likely modulates sensitivity to tussive stimuli. RARs may regulate the duration and magnitude of the inspiratory and expiratory phases of coughing. A primary role in cough initiation for either RARs or SARs seems unlikely. Unlike their role in regulating the duration of inspiratory and expiratory phases during breathing, volume-related feedback from SARs has no eff ect on the duration of breathing phases of tracheobronchial cough. 51 Interactions Between Aff erent Nerve Subtypes Evoking Cough\n\nAlthough C-fi bers and the cough receptors subserve primary roles in cough initiation, other bronchopulmonary aff erent nerve subtypes likely modulate cough pattern and sensitivity to tussive stimuli. Some of these sensory nerve interactions depend upon the peripheral consequences of the refl exes initiated upon their activation. 9 , 10 , 13 Th ese refl exes include changes in respiratory rate and tidal volume and also alterations in autonomic nerve activity in the airways and lungs and throughout the cardiovascular system. For example, SARs and RARs regulate tidal volumes and the timing of inspiration and expiration. 43 , 44 Th e peak expiratory fl ows achieved during cough are directly related to inspiratory volumes, 52 and in this way lung stretch receptors will modulate cough. Lung stretch receptors also indirectly regulate airway caliber and, thus, resistance to airfl ow through airway autonomic pathways. 53 , 54 Although there are confl icting results in the literature, anticholinergics have been shown to modulate cough responsiveness and at least partially reduce cough severity in some patients. 55 Airway sympathetic nerves may also regulate cough by modulating mucosal blood fl ow, which may clear irritants contained in airway surface liquid and thus reduce their concentrations in the biophase, thereby reducing excitation of underlying sensory nerves. 56 Axonal refl exes, which result in the release of neuropeptides from the peripheral terminals of aff erent C-fi bers, independent of any involvement of the CNS, are unlikely to regulate human lung physiology and pathophysiology, given the paucity of neuropeptidecontaining sensory nerves in the human airway mucosa. 9 , 57 Th is contrasts sharply with previous studies performed in rats and guinea pigs, wherein the majority of C-fi ber terminals in the airways mucosa contain the neuropeptides substance P, neurokinin A, and calcitonin generelated peptide. In these species, neuropeptide-dependent axonal refl exes play a prominent role in lung responses to infl ammation and other noxious insults. 58 Comparable nerve terminals lacking neuropeptides have been localized to human airways. 25 -27 However, these nerve terminals have the subcellular machinery for peripheral neurotransmitter release. Perhaps nonpeptide transmitters, including the purine transmitter ATP, may be released peripherally from human airway C-fi bers by axonal refl exes. Administered exogenously, ATP evokes coughing and sensation of dyspnea in patients, and a clinical study described a profound reduction in chronic cough rates upon administration of a potent purinergic/P2X3 receptor antagonist in patients with chronic cough. 59 -61 Central Interactions\n\nVagal aff erent nerves may also interact in the CNS to regulate cough. Anatomic and functional studies have demonstrated convergence of vagal aff erents at sites of brainstem integration, particularly in the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS), a region in the caudal brainstem where many vagal sensory nerves project. 62 , 63 Such convergent projections lead to synergistic regulation of refl ex bronchospasm. 64 Evidence for synergistic interactions between cough receptors and C-fi bers has also been documented in studies of cough. Th us, in anesthetized guinea pigs, C-fi ber activation does not evoke cough but greatly sensitizes the cough refl ex evoked by activating the cough receptors. 65 Th is sensitizing eff ect of bronchopulmonary C-fi ber activation through CNSdependent mechanisms is comparable to the processes of central sensitization described in studies of pain in somatic tissues. 66 , 67 Comparable central interactions may contribute to the enhanced cough responsiveness evoked by allergic infl ammation and associated with gastroesophageal refl ux and upper airway diseases, presumably refl ecting facilitatory central interactions of esophageal or trigeminal aff erent pathways with cough circuits in the brain. 9 , 10 , 68 Not all central interactions among aff erent pathways promote enhanced cough responsiveness. Activation of a subset of pulmonary C-fi bers has been shown to inhibit evoked coughing in dogs, cats, and guinea pigs, and circumstantial evidence suggests a comparable inhibition of cough evoked by pulmonary C-fi ber activation in patients. 10 , 69 , 70 Th ese inhibitory eff ects occur coincident with pulmonary chemorefl exes, which results in profound changes in respiration and dyspnea and almost certainly depends upon inhibitory interactions between respiratory pattern generators and central pattern regulators of cough. Cough may also be inhibited by activation of cold-sensitive/ menthol-sensitive trigeminal aff erent nerves innervating the upper airways and nose (see later). Th e central pathways accounting for these upper and lower airway nerve interactions have not been determined.\n\nComplex and poorly defi ned central (and perhaps peripheral) interactions between cough neural pathways and changes in arterial oxygen and CO 2 can also regulate coughing. Hypoxia depresses cough in animal models and increases capsaicin thresholds in humans. 71 , 72 Repetitive coughing in animal models induces profound hyperventilation and metabolic alkalemia, such that central arterial levels of CO 2 fall well below apneic threshold. 73 Th ese low levels of CO 2 do not depress cough eff orts as they would respiratory muscle activity during breathing. 74 \n\nAff erent nerves carried by the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (Arnold nerve) innervate the external auditory meatus. 75 In a small subset of individuals ( , 5%), several visceral refl exes, including cough, may be evoked by mechanical stimulation of the ear. Tracing studies in cats show that the cell bodies of the aff erent neurons carried by the Arnold nerve are located in the jugular ganglia and terminate in several areas throughout the brainstem, including the nTS. 76 It is interesting that, in guinea pigs, the nociceptors that modulate cough also have their cell bodies in the jugular ganglia and terminate centrally in the same region of the nTS. 9 , 10 It seems likely that the cough initiated by stimulation of the ear involves integration of both ongoing airway vagal aff erent nerve input and the additional aff erent input arising from the ear.\n\nRhinosinusitis and other conditions involving the upper airways are common comorbidities in patients with chronic cough. Precisely why upper airways disease is associated with chronic cough is unclear. Direct stimulation of the nasal mucosa does not initiate cough. Th ere has been speculation that postnasal drip may be responsible for the coughing resulting from upper airways disorders, but there seems to be considerable variance in the prevalence of postnasal drip among patients with chronic cough. 5 , 6 An alternative explanation for cough associated with rhinosinusitis would be a sensitizing eff ect of upper airway aff erent nerves, resulting in enhanced cough responsiveness and thus coughing in a subset of individuals. This hypothetical mechanism assumes that trigeminal aff erent pathways can promote the likelihood of cough by lowering the threshold of the central cough pattern generator to subsequent vagal aff erent input, perhaps to the point where even innocuous or physiologic stimuli arising from the lower airways could promote coughing. Th us, cough refl ex sensitivity is enhanced by upper airways disease, and an additional lower airway trigger for cough results in a clinical presentation that is responsive to aggressive medical therapy targeting upper airway disease. Th ere is precedent in animals and in patients for enhanced cough sensitivity evoked by upper airway irritation. Acute allergic infl ammation, challenges with mediators associated with allergic infl ammation, or stimulation of TRPA1-or TRPV1-responsive upper airway sensory nerves increases responsiveness to tussive challenge. 77 -80 A subset of upper airway aff erent nerves may also reduce cough frequency and responsiveness to tussive challenge. Menthol has been in use clinically for centuries for its soothing eff ects on mucosal surfaces and is commonly formulated in cough remedies. Menthol and components of eucalyptus and camphor may potentially work, in part, to produce their cooling and soothing eff ects by activating the ion channel transient receptor potential M8 (TRPM8). Unlike TRPV1 and TRPA1, which evoke painful and noxious sensations and refl exes, TRPM8 activation is soothing, a counterirritant to eff ects evoked by nociceptors. Th ese opposing eff ects of TRPA1/TRPV1 and TRPM8 suggest diff erential expression by sensory nerves. Molecular and functional studies fi nd little, if any, expression of TRPM8 in nerves innervating the lower airways (where C-fi bers comprise the majority of vagal aff erent innervation) but fi nd a prominent expression of TRPM8 by trigeminal nerves innervating the upper airways. Molecular analyses confi rm that a subset of TRPM8 1 nasal aff erent nerves do not coexpress TRPV1 or TRPA1. Activation of these upper airway aff erents reduces cough responsiveness in animals and humans and may reduce cough frequency in patients with acute cough. 81 , 82 Cough Initiated From the Pharynx Infusion of fl uid into the pharynx or pharyngeal stimulation with air puffs in awake or anesthetized human subjects can initiate coughing or the urge to cough under certain circumstances. 83 -86 Th e pharyngeal aff erent nerves regulating cough are either vagal in origin or arise from the glossopharyngeal nerves or from nerve branches emanating from the trigeminal ganglion. 87 Th e physiologic properties of the pharyngeal aff erent nerves regulating cough are poorly defi ned, but they may be similar to the cough receptors innervating the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. Th us, mechanical stimulation, postnasal drip, and a water bolus placed into the pharynx evoke vigorous coughing in human subjects and in animals, whereas capsaicin may be unable to initiate coughing when applied selectively to the pharynx. 83 -86 Cough Initiated From the Esophagus Th ere are confl icting reports regarding the ability of esophageal aff erent nerve activation to initiate coughing. 87 In animals, neither distension nor luminal challenge of the esophagus with acid or capsaicin evokes coughing. 9 , 10 Comparably negative studies have been reported in humans. However, there are also reports of cough evoked from the esophagus in humans. Moreover, the association between chronic cough and GERD is quite clear, and the ability to markedly reduce coughing in at least a subset of patients with GERD, by eff ective medical or surgical treatment of the refl ux disease, argues strongly for the hypothesis that refl ux initiates coughing in susceptible patients. 5 , 6 , 88 Studies combining cough monitoring with impedance measurements also implicate refl ux as a driver of cough in a subset of patients ( Fig 4 ) . 89 Th e easiest explanation for these results is that refl uxate is aspirated into the airways and directly activates the airway vagal aff erent nerves regulating cough. 87 , 90 But pH/impedance monitoring in patients with GERD provides little evidence that refl uxate needs to reach the proximal esophagus, much less the airways, to initiate pulmonary symptoms or coughing. 87 , 89 Th e available evidence suggests that locally or centrally mediated airway refl exes (promoting mucous secretion, bronchospasm, cough) can be initiated directly from the stomach or the esophagus. 91 -93 For example, many species have neuronal projections between esophageal and airway autonomic ganglia that, when activated, produce physiologic eff ects in the airways (including mucous secretion or bronchoconstriction) that could promote coughing. 93 Alternatively, the interactions between the GI tract (GIT) and airway aff erent pathways 89 ) may occur in the central nervous system. Although untested directly, and thus unproven, esophageal and airway aff erent nerves are known to project to similar brainstem regions and could converge centrally to regulate and initiate parallel and overlapping refl ex eff ects in the airways and GIT. 94 , 95 Alternatively, portions of the GIT and airways share a common blood supply and, as such, it is conceivable that infl ammatory mediators or cells arising from the esophagus as a consequence of refl ux could impinge upon airway sensory pathways to produce cough.\n\nStudies in patients with GERD provide evidence that refl uxate may also sensitize the cough refl ex. 94 -96 Acid challenges to the esophagus markedly reduce the concentration of inhaled capsaicin required to evoke cough or directly result in coughing. Ing and colleagues 95 reported that this sensitizing eff ect of the esophageal challenge could be prevented by inhalation of atropine, suggesting that a CNS-dependent refl ex, initiated from the esophagus, resulted in bronchospasm and/or mucous secretion in the airways that initiated coughing. Medical treatment of GERD has also been reported to greatly reduce sensitivity to tussive stimuli. 88 Th is sensitizing eff ect of refl uxate or experimental acid challenges likely depends on CNS integration and amplifi cation of parallel vagal sensory inputs controlling cough. 68 \n\nOur current understanding of the central regulation of cough can be separated into three main areas: (1) brainstem processing of aff erent information, (2) organization of the brainstem control network, and (3) higher brain (encompassing subcortical and cortical) circuits that support the role of consciousness, perception, and emotion in the expression of cough.\n\nVagal aff erent fi bers enter the brainstem via the nTS, where they synapse on second-order interneurons. 97 Th e nTS cough-related interneuronal circuit has been proposed to have a \"relay\" function for transmission of information to populations of neurons in the brainstem that regulate breathing. 98 -101 Th e core of the cough network is located in the ventrolateral region of the medulla and is hypothesized to participate in breathing and rhythm regulation for cough . 98 , 100 -102 However, there are no studies of the response patterns and functional interactions of nTS neurons during cough. Studies have used transneuronal tracing with herpes simplex virus to map central circuits from the extrathoracic trachea. 103 Th ese studies showed that a broad network of neurons in the nTS participated in central processing of tracheal aff erent information. Th is work supports the idea that the role of the nTS in generating cough has been signifi cantly underestimated. What is clear is that this area of the brainstem does not simply relay vagal sensory aff erent information through to the rest of the nervous system.\n\nCough and breathing can be diff erentially regulated by primary aff erent inputs to the brainstem. 51 , 104 , 105 Th is supports the concept that the regulation of cough is not an extension of our understanding of that for breathing but rather it is customized to the function of the behavior. In particular, the lack of an important role for hyperventilation in the control of cough is consistent with the fact that ventilation increases signifi cantly during this behavior. Th is alteration in the regulatory system is necessary to prevent a loss of respiratory muscle excitability as CO 2 falls during coughing. Th e depression of cough induced by hypoxia is less well understood. Th is eff ect may be related to a transition in priority of the respiratory muscle control system from maintaining blood gasses under normal conditions while allowing episodes of coughing to clear the airways to a focus on maintaining ventilation during hypoxia, which is a signifi cant threat to normal gas exchange. Th e specifi c importance of the permissive/facilitatory effect of SARs on cough is also not well understood but may help optimize respiratory muscle performance 106 and facilitate expulsive airfl ows that occur when cough is elicited at higher lung volumes. 52\n\nA network of neurons that includes the ventrolateral medulla, raphe nuclei, and pons is responsible for controlling the duration of the inspiratory, compressive, and expulsive phases of coughing as well as the magnitude of motor activation of the respiratory muscles during this behavior. 98 , 99 , 101 , 102 , 107 -109 Th is network also regulates respiratory muscles to produce breathing. 102 Evidence supporting the concept of an anatomically distributed, but shared, network for both cough and breathing comes from a variety of preclinical studies showing that brainstem neurons in these locations alter their activities during both behaviors. 98 , 99 , 101 , 102 , 108 -110 Th ese neurons are synaptically connected in ways that can explain motor drive to respiratory muscles during both behaviors. 98 , 99 , 101 Th e process by which selected populations of this distributed brainstem network alter their activities to account for both behaviors is known as reconfi guration. 98 , 101 , 102 Although complex, the reconfi gured brainstem network hypothesis for cough does not yet account for the diff erential regulation of this behavior relative to breathing. Furthermore, this network cannot account for the phenotype of response to cough-suppressive drugs, fi rst shown by May and Widdicombe 111 . 50 years ago . Centrally active antitussive drugs suppress cough in a dose-dependent manner at doses that have no eff ect on breathing. 111 , 112 By defi nition, there must be some \"neural module\" in this brainstem network that is not required for breathing but is important for the full expression of cough. Some investigators have approached this problem using microinjection methods to apply antitussive drugs and/or neurotransmitter agonists and antagonists to various brainstem regions. 113 -117 It is clear that familiar brainstem areas, such as the nTS, could participate in the actions of antitussive drugs. It is also clear that other areas not currently believed to have a command function for cough could be substrates for cough suppressants. 113 , 115 These studies support the concept that there may be no single anatomic brainstem area or \"center\" that is susceptible to antitussive drugs but that these compounds may act at multiple sites when administered systemically. Th e extent to which these sites may contain undescribed elements of the brainstem network for cough is unknown, but these fi ndings do support the idea that, even though our current conceptualization of the brainstem cough network is complex, it probably represents an underestimate of its true complexity.\n\nCoughing, like swallowing, belching, urinating, and defecating, is unique in that there is higher brain (cortical and subcortical) control of this visceral refl ex ( Fig 5 ) . 118 -120 Higher brain control of coughing can manifest both as inhibition (eg, coughing that is suppressed until a break in a live performance or activity) and also as voluntary cough. Patients with persistent cough typically experience a recurrent need to cough or clear their airways (ie, an urge to cough) 118 and are acutely aware of the ongoing sense of irritation in the airways (which can present, for example, as an itch or scratch in the throat or chest). Perceptual awareness requires cortical processing of the sensory information originating in the airways, and this promotes behavioral coughing in an attempt to clear the airways and satiate the urge. Th e implications of this conscious control of cough are severalfold. First, behavioral cough, rather than refl ex cough, may contribute signifi cantly to chronic cough in disease, and this could have implications for antitussive therapies. For example, Vertigan and Gibson 121 , 122 reported that 49% of a patient cohort diagnosed with chronic refractory cough reported coughing deliberately in response to perceived irritations in the throat. Perhaps related to this, placebos can have a profound eff ect on coughing, the urge to cough having been studied experimentally. 123 , 124 As such, any study of a novel or existing cough treatment should include a blinded (preferably double-blinded) placebo arm. Furthermore, speech therapy is proving benefi cial in a subset of chronic coughers, 122 which may refl ect regulatory processes in this higher-order cough circuitry. It is also clear, however, that cough on occasion may be unrelated to a physiologic disease (eg, GERD, asthma), and thus a psychologic issue needs to be considered (\"psychogenic cough\"). 125 Addressing the psychologic impact of coughing on a patient's sense of well-being should therefore be a component of any treatment regimen for chronic cough, whether an underlying cause is identifi ed, because many patients with cough present with symptoms of anxiety, sleep disturbance, and/or depressive illness. 126 Because of this, it may be diffi cult to resolve whether the behavioral symptoms are due to the impact of intractable and unexplained cough or somehow the cause of the cough itself.\n\nTh e sensory and motor pathways composing the higher brain regulation of coughing in humans have received considerable attention. 118 -120 Uniquely, more is known about the higher brain control of cough in humans than in animals, which is not the case for other aspects of cough physiology. Th ese processes are complex, but nevertheless it is of value to provide a summary of the major points. Th e urge to cough evoked by capsaicin inhalation in healthy volunteers is encoded in a brain network that includes the primary sensory, insula, prefrontal, and posterior parietal cerebral cortices. 118 , 120 Th e activity patterns in these regions suggest that the primary sensory cortex is principally responsible for encoding urge-to-cough intensity, whereas the insula cortex encodes the magnitude of the incoming sensory input from the airways, and the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices likely contribute to attention and localizing the site of irritation. 120 Voluntary cough suppression requires brain regions similar to those needed for inhibiting other types of motor patterns, including activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior mid-cingulate cortex, insula cortex, and supplementary motor area, 119 , 127 , 128 although it is presently unclear where in the cough refl ex pathway these suppressive circuits act. Not surprisingly, voluntary cough is associated with activity in premotor and motor cortices and in the cerebellum. Of particular interest, voluntary cough may Projections from the nTS can refl exively induce coughing by modifying activity of the respiratory CPG, a collection of neurons that generates respiratory rhythm in the VRG of the brainstem. Output from the CPG via MNs provides the drive to respiratory muscles needed to elicit the cough motor pattern. Superimposed on this refl ex pathway is a complex higher brain network that also receives inputs from the nTS in the brainstem. Higher brain processing gives rise to respiratory sensations and emotions associated with airway irritation as well as enabling a higher level of motor control over the basic refl exive cough pathways. Centrally acting antitussive agents likely aff ect both brainstem and higher brain processes to modify coughing. CPG proceed without input to the brainstem cough circuits described above, presumably relying on direct higherbrain control of respiratory motor neurons in the spinal cord. 119 , 128 Th is is obviously in stark contrast to cough evoked by airways irritation. Placebo suppression of cough is correlated with activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 97 a region known to be necessary for placebo analgesia. 129 Th e limbic brain and, in particular, the orbitofrontal cortex contribute to the aff ective components (such as the sense of unpleasantness) associated with airways irritation and cough. 118 , 119 , 130 Th e Clinical Perspective Th e anatomic and neurophysiologic processes responsible for the initiation and regulation of cough are complex 131 and may not be considered immediately relevant by the clinician managing his/her patient with troublesome cough. However, the body of literature devoted to this area should be viewed as a valuable resource to help the clinician understand how and why his/her patient coughs and provide rationale for a targeted and systematic approach to treatment. In its simplest form, clinical cough is a refl ex event beginning with activation of vagal aff erent sensory nerves located in pulmonary and extrapulmonary sites that project the \"signal\" centrally, where it undergoes modulation, resulting in the generation of the appropriate eff erent motor response. Th is concept of distinct aff erent sites has provided the rationale for the use of the \"anatomic diagnostic protocol\" to evaluate and manage patients with cough. 132 , 133 Th is approach of directing investigations and trials of therapy at various anatomic sites has now become embedded in clinical practice, leading to a broad recognition that asthma, GERD, and upper airways disease are, at least in adult patients, the most common causes of chronic cough. 5 , 134 -136 However, why the vast majority of patients with these common conditions do not develop chronic cough remains unclear. Adequate treatment of one or more of these causes is eff ective in the majority of patients, although a signifi cant minority remains troubled with an unexplained, refractory chronic cough, despite extensive investigation and trials of therapy. 136 , 137 Much of what is known about the regulation of cough by neural structures within the lung and at extrapulmonary sites, such as the nose, pharynx, and esophagus, has been obtained from experiments involving the mechanical probing and chemical stimulation of laboratory animals. 138 , 139 Although these models, particularly those involving anesthetized animals, may not faithfully reproduce the human condition, they have provided clinically important information. Th e most sensitive regions of the airways for mechanically eliciting cough are the larynx and the tracheal and bronchial bifurcations. 9 , 10 , 138 Th e idea that \"mechanosensitive\" receptors are located proximally within the airways seems entirely logical and consistent with the principal role of cough in protecting the lungs. When these processes are impaired, important clinical problems arise. Th e extension of the original animal experiments on mechanical activation of the airway to human studies has provided some important information of how cough and airwayprotective refl exes may be modifi ed in various clinical scenarios. Th ese include studies designed to determine the impact of premature birth, 139 aging, 140 and disease 141 , 142 on the integrity of the cough refl ex. Cough can also be initiated with chemical stimuli. In experiments conducted in cats, Widdicombe 30 -32 reported a more vigorous response to chemical stimulation when delivered to distal bronchi, compared with the trachea and more proximal larger airways. Th e regional sensitivity of human airways to chemical activation was studied . 30 years later by Hansson and colleagues. 143 Using single-breath aerosols of capsaicin in healthy human subjects, they noted that coughing was more readily induced by small droplet particles (deposited more distally in the airway) than by large droplet particles (deposited more proximally). 143 Th e notion that \"chemosensitive\" receptors are present in the distal airways, a region of the lung considered to be sparsely innervated, 144 provides some rationale for cough as a prominent symptom in clinical conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis and bronchiolitis, both characterized by disease distributed more peripherally in the airways.\n\nCoughing in response to experimental airway challenge with a range of physical and chemical irritants, including cold air and aerosols of capsaicin, citric acid, histamine, and charcoal dust, has been reported in both healthy subjects and patients with disease. 145 -149 A number of clinically relevant observations have emerged from these studies. First, subjects undergoing tussive challenge oft en report a \"tickle\" sensation at the top center of their chest, accompanied by the \"urge\" or desire to cough. Th ese sensory symptoms are also commonly described by patients with chronic cough. 150 Second, it has consistently been observed that female subjects exhibit heightened cough responses to chemical tussive stimuli. 151 , 152 Whether this explains the predominance of female patients among those seeking help for chronic cough is not known. Th ird, patients typically report triggering of their cough by low-level physical (mechanical and thermal) and chemical stimuli (eg, scents, odors). Th is feature can oft en be the most troublesome cough-associated adverse occurrence to patients and contributes to their impaired health status. 153 , 154 Th e notion that the cough refl ex may be sensitized is central to current understanding of clinical cough. 150 Th is hypersensitive state may exist transiently, as typically seen with a respiratory viral infection, where the accompanying cough is termed \"acute\" if it diminishes in , 3 weeks. For the majority of patients with cough, however, their cough and associated sensitivity last . 8 weeks, termed \"chronic\" by defi nition. It is not yet clear whether this \"hypersensitive state\" occurs directly from the eff ects of inflammatory mediators arising from disease in relevant anatomic sites \"sensitizing\" receptors expressed on aff erent nerves. Alternative possibilities include the central amplification of otherwise normal afferent signals or the failure of descending inhibitory pathways in the higher center to exert their suppressing eff ect. Irrespective of the exact mechanism, a resolution of this sensitization, by whatever means (eg, the natural resolution of the viral infection, the withdrawal of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or the eff ective treatment of the underlying cause), is critical to the improvement of the cough. On the other hand, it is also unclear why a hypersensitive state is transient in some patients, whereas it becomes permanent in others.\n\nTh e maturational and developmental aspects of the cough refl ex have important clinical implications. 139 Chemical and mechanical activation is eff ective at initiating protective refl exes, including apneas and swallowing in the newborn. As the infant matures, these responses become less pronounced. Th e age at which the cough refl ex in children becomes fully matured is not known, but aging per se can impact cough to varying degrees. Th e effi cacy of coughing may be reduced, as respiratory muscle strength decreases with age. 155 However, the threshold for initiating coughing does not change. 156 -158 By contrast, the elderly's capacity to suppress cough is diminished, 158 as is the sensation of the urge to cough following airways irritation. 157 Whether these characteristics have a bearing on the likelihood of coughing in the elderly is unclear, although aspiration pneumonia is more common in old age.\n\nCoughing is directly evoked by stimulation of a subset of bronchopulmonary C-fi bers and a mechanically sensitive, acid-sensitive subtype of myelinated airway mechanoreceptors. Th eir activation may result directly in coughing, whereas their coincident activation greatly increases responsiveness to tussive stimuli. Cough can also be modulated by other bronchopulmonary, vagal aff erent nerve subtypes and aff erent nerves terminating in extrapulmonary locations, including the upper airways, pharynx, and esophagus.\n\nEvidence for extensive remodeling of airway aff erent innervation in diseases associated with cough has been confl icting. 159 -163 Perhaps chronic coughing occurs, not because of a hyperinnervation of the airways, but because there are more triggers for coughing in the airways or in other organs associated with coughing. Consistent with this notion, infl ammatory mediators are elevated in the BAL fl uid of patients with asthma and chronic coughers without asthma , and therapeutics that target identifi ed triggers of coughing or infl ammation have proven eff ective in treating cough in several patient populations. 164 -173 Th e precise terminal locations of the aff erent nerves driving chronic cough are not yet known.\n\nAlthough eff ects in animals have been reported, 174 it is unknown whether any meaningful changes in aff erent nerve excitability or ion channel expression occur in chronic cough in patients. Th erapeutic strategies targeting the interactions between the aff erent nerves regulating cough at the level of the CNS, the mechanisms underlying action potential generation, and the encoding mechanisms of cough are all viable therapeutic strategies for cough suppression ( Fig 5 ) . Emerging therapeutic research strategies based on these rationales are priorities to advancing the fi eld at this time and include blockers of TRPV1 and/or TRPA1, voltage-gated sodium-channel blockers (selectively targeting the sodium channels [eg, voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7] expressed by airways sensory nerves), N -methyl-D-aspartate-receptor/channel blockers, and other therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing aff erent nerve excitability within the airways. 175 Financial/nonfi nancial disclosures: Th e authors have reported to CHEST the following confl icts of interest: Dr Canning chairs a scientifi c advisory board for Cerecor Inc , a company that has sought development of new drugs for treating cough, including therapies protected by patents held jointly by Cerecor Inc and by Dr Canning.
