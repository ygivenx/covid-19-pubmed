Rabbit anti\u2013ACE, anti\u2013ACE2, and anti\u2013p65, and mouse anti\u2013phospho\u2013p65 and anti\u2013I\u03baB\u03b1 antibodies were procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Delaware, CA, USA). Rabbit anti\u2013p38 MAPK, anti\u2013phospho\u2013p38 MAPK, anti\u2013ERK1/2, anti\u2013phospho\u2013ERK1/2, anti\u2013stress\u2013activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK, anti\u2013phospho\u2013SAPK/JNK, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u2013conjugated secondary antibody goat anti\u2013rabbit IgG, and horse anti\u2013mouse IgG antibodies were all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). TNF\u2013\u03b1 and IL\u20131\u03b2 kits were purchased from Invitrogen (Eugene, OR, USA). AngII and Ang\u2013(1\u20137) enzyme\u2013linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits came from Kamiya Biomedical (Seattle, WA, USA). Mas receptor blocker A779 was obtained from AbBiotech (San Diego, CA, USA). SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK), PD98059 (a specific inhibitor of ERK1/2) and SP600125 (a specific inhibitor of JNK) were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Delaware, CA, USA).\n\nSprague\u2013Dawley rats weighing 200\u2013250 g were obtained from the Department of Laboratory Animal Science of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. All animals were handled in accordance with the protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of Animal Research at the College of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China.\n\nIsolation and culture of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were performed as described previously3. Briefly, the rats were euthanized after intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium. Thoracotomy was performed and the lung circulatory system was perfused by injection of 50 mL ice\u2013cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) via the right ventricle. The lungs were removed and washed with 30 mL ice\u2013cold serum\u2013free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\nThe pleura were carefully cut away and discarded, and then sections (1 mm) were cut from the outer edge of the remaining lung tissue and trimmed into small pieces. These lung tissue pieces were then inserted into the glass pellets (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and rinsed in endothelial cell medium (ScienCell Research, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 2.5 g/mL amphotericin B. The glass pellets were incubated in humidified air with 5% CO2 for 60 h, and the culture media were replaced every 3 days.\n\nThe cells at 80\u201390% confluence were harvested by treating with 0.25% trypsin\u2013 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and subcultured at 1:2 ratios. Cobblestone morphology and immunostaining with rabbit anti\u2013human factor VIII, anti\u2013rat CD31 (Boster, Wuhan, China), and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)\u2013Bandeiraea simplicifolia isolectin (BSI; Santa Cruz, Delaware, CA, USA) were used to identify the endothelial cells. The third to fifth cell passages were used for the following experiments.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from rat PMVECs and reversely transcribed into cDNA using M\u2013MLV reverse transcriptase (Takara BIO, Japan). The cDNA was used to amplify the Ace2 coding sequence with the following primers: forward, 5\u2032\u2013GCTCTAGAGCCACCATGTCAAGCTCCTGCTGGC\u20133\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032\u2013 CGGGATCCTTAGAATGAAGTTTGAGC. Three shRNA sequences targeting the rat Ace2 coding region (homologous to nt 1089\u20131107, 1152\u20131170, and 1582\u20131600 of Ace2 mRNA, respectively) were designed: small interfering RNA (siRNA)1\u2013Ace2 (5\u2032\u2013GGTCACAATGGACAACTTC\u20133\u2032); siRNA2\u2013Ace2 (5\u2032\u2013GCATATGCCAAGCAACCTT\u20133\u2032); and siRNA3\u2013ACE2 (5\u2032\u2013GCTCTTTGTCAAGCAGCTA\u20133\u2032). An invalid RNA interference (RNAi) sequence (5\u2032\u2013GAAGCCAGATCCAGCTTCC\u20133\u2032) was used as the negative control. The corresponding oligonucleotide templates of the shRNAs were chemically synthesized. The Ace2 PCR products were purified and ligated to a lentiviral pcDNA\u2013CMV\u2013copGFP cDNA vector and the synthesized shRNA\u2013Ace2 to pSIH1\u2013H1\u2013copGFP shRNA (System Biosciences, CA, USA). Each ligation mixture was transformed into competent E. coli strain DH5\u03b1, and the resultant plasmids were confirmed by sequencing.\n\nIn accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, the vectors carrying Ace2 or Ace2 shRNA and lentivirus package plasmids were co\u2013transfected into 293 T producer cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The supernatants were collected 48 h later. Total RNA and protein were extracted to determine ACE2 mRNA and protein and to select a recombinant shRNA lentivirus with the most sufficient siRNA. Viral titer was evaluated by gradient dilution. The recombinant lentiviruses were named LV\u2013Ace2 and LV\u2013shRNA\u2013Ace2.\n\nOne day after seeding, PMVECs cells were infected with LV\u2013Ace2 or LV\u2013shRNA\u2013Ace2 and diluted at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 in endothelial cell medium, which was refreshed 24 h later. The infection efficiency was assessed by fluorescence microscopy 96 h after infection.\n\nOne hundred microliters of PMVECs, normal or lentivirus\u2013infected (LV\u2013Ace2 or LV\u2013shRNA\u2013Ace2), were seeded into 96\u2013well plates (1 \u00d7 104 cells/well) and incubated with serum\u2013free DMEM for 24 h. PMVECs, whether normal or infected, were then pretreated (or not) with 100 nM A779 for 2 h and then stimulated (or not) with 1 mg/mL LPS for 48 h as follows: (1) normal cells in PBS and untreated (control); (2) normal cells, treated with A779, without LPS (A779); (3) normal cells, treated with LPS only (LPS); (4) normal cells, treated with A779 and also LPS (A779 + LPS); (5) cells infected with the empty control virus, receiving LPS only (Lv\u2013control + LPS); (6) cells infected with RNAi (negative control or NC) receiving LPS only (Lv\u2013NC + LPS); (7) cells infected with shRNA\u2013Ace2, receiving LPS only (shACE2 + LPS); (8) cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2, receiving LPS only (ACE2 + LPS); and (9) cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2, receiving A779 prior to LPS (ACE2 + A779 + LPS).\n\nFor further experiments using the specific MAPK inhibitors, normal cells and cells infected with shRNA\u2013Ace2 or LV\u2013Ace2 were pre\u2013incubated with either 10 \u03bcM SB203580, 20 \u03bcM PD98059, or 20 \u03bcM SP600125, for 2 hours before exposure to LPS.\n\nApoptosis was determined using an annexin V\u2013FITC apoptosis detection kit (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, the cells were harvested, washed 3 times with PBS, centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7 g for 5 min, and resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of binding buffer (0.1 M Hepes/NaOH, 1.4 M NaCl, 25 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mL. After incubation with 5 \u03bcL of annexin V\u2013FITC for 10 min and 5 \u03bcL of propidium iodide for 5 min at room temperature, the cell suspension was subjected to flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and detected at excitation wavelength 488 nm. Data were analyzed using CellQuest Pro software (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).\n\nThe culture supernatants of each group were collected and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C, and IL\u20131\u03b2, TNF\u2013\u03b1, AngII and Ang\u2013(1\u20137) concentrations in the supernatants were assayed by sandwich ELISA. Briefly, 96\u2013well plates were coated with the monoclonal antibody specific to IL\u20131\u03b2, TNF\u2013\u03b1, AngII, or Ang\u2013(1\u20137) supplied in the ELISA kit. ELISAs were performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a micro\u2013plate reader (Bio\u2013Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The concentrations were extrapolated from the standard curve obtained from the same plate.\n\nTotal protein was extracted from the cells using M\u2013PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce, IL, USA). The protein concentration was determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce, USA), and equal amounts of protein (25 \u03bcg) were run on a 12% SDS\u2013PAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris\u2013buffered saline (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH7.4)/0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 2 h. The blots were probed with a primary antibody against rat ACE (1:400), ACE2 (1:500), ERK1/2 (1:400), SAPK/JNK (1:500), p38 MAPK (1:600), I\u03baB\u03b1 (1:500), phosphorylated P65 (1:300), P65 (1:500) and \u03b2 actin (1:1000). After 3 washes with TBST, the blots were incubated in secondary HRP\u2013conjugated anti\u2013mouse/rabbit IgG. After washing with TBST 3 times, the membranes were developed with a chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit and imaged with X\u2013ray films. Beta actin was used as an endogenous reference for normalization.\n\nAll data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were performed with the Prism software package (GraphPad v5, San Diego, CA, USA). Data were analyzed using one\u2013way ANOVA and then the Newman\u2013Keuls test for multiple comparisons. A P\u2013value less than 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.\n\nThe rate of apoptosis of PMVECs in the LPS group (exposed to LPS for 48 h; 55.07%), was significantly higher than that of the PBS control group (6.43%; P < 0.05; Fig. 1A). For cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 receiving LPS (ACE2 + LPS group) the rate of apoptosis was 37.60% (P < 0.05), but this was significantly lower than that of PMVECs infected with shRNA\u2013ACE2 treated with LPS (shACE2 + LPS group; 85.85%; P < 0.05).\n\nIn normal PMVECs stimulated with LPS, the apoptosis rate of those given the A779 pretreatment (A779 + LPS group; 89.55%) was significantly higher than that of the cells treated with LPS only (LPS; 55.07%; P < 0.05; Fig. 1B). However, the apoptosis rate of cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 that received pretreatment of A779 prior to LPS (ACE2 + A779 + LPS group; 53.80%) was significantly lower than that of the A779 + LPS group (P < 0.05), although there was no significant difference between the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group (53.80%) and the LPS group (55.07%).\n\nThe IL\u20131\u03b2 and TNF\u2013\u03b1 levels in the supernatants of cultured PMVECs that were exposed to LPS for 48 h were significantly higher as compared with control group. (Fig. 2A, 2C). LPS\u2013induced IL\u20131\u03b2 and TNF\u2013\u03b1 secretions were significantly inhibited by ACE2 overexpression, but further promoted by ACE2 knockdown.\n\nIn PMVECs exposed to LPS, pretreatment with A779 caused a significant increase in IL\u20131\u03b2 and TNF\u2013\u03b1 secretions, which were markedly attenuated by ACE2 overexpression (Fig. 2B, 2D). However, there was no significant difference between ACE2 + A779 + LPS and LPS\u2013treated cells in the levels of cytokines in the supernatants. These results indicate that ACE2 suppressed the LPS\u2013induced inflammatory response in PMVECs, and the Mas\u2013receptor antagonist effectively prevented this protective effect.\n\nThe AngII levels in supernatants of the LPS group (20.04 \u00b1 1.92 ng/mL) were significantly higher than that of the PBS control group (10.99 \u00b1 4.03 ng/mL; P < 0.05), but the Ang\u2013(1\u20137) levels in the LPS group were only slightly higher (15.49 \u00b1 3.41 ng/mL) than that of the PBS group (12.30 \u00b1 2.40 ng/mL; P > 0.05).\n\nFor cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 receiving LPS (ACE2 + LPS group), AngII secretion (12.79 \u00b1 2.42 ng/mL) was significantly less than that of the normal cells receiving LPS (LPS group; 20.04 \u00b1 1.92 ng/mL), but AngII levels were significantly higher in PMVECs infected with shRNA\u2013Ace2 treated with LPS (shACE2 + LPS group; 27.29 \u00b1 3.97 ng/mL) compared with the LPS group (P < 0.05).\n\nIn contrast, Ang\u2013(1\u20137) levels in PMVECs infected with LV\u2013Ace2 receiving LPS (ACE2 + LPS group; 31.20 \u00b1 4.75 ng/mL; P < 0.05) were significantly higher than that of the LPS group (15.49 \u00b1 3.41 ng/mL), and also that of the shRNA\u2013ACE2 + LPS group (14.81 \u00b1 2.55 ng/mL; P < 0.05; Fig 3A, 3C).\n\nIn normal PMVECs exposed to LPS, the AngII levels of those pretreated with A779 (A779 + LPS group; 31.87 \u00b1 4.69 ng/mL) were significantly higher than that of the cells treated with LPS only (20.04 \u00b1 1.92 ng/mL; P < 0.05). The AngII levels of cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 that received pretreatment of A779 prior to LPS (ACE2 + A779 + LPS group; 15.50 \u00b1 0.60 ng/mL) were significantly lower than that of the A779 + LPS group (31.87 \u00b1 4.69 ng/mL; P < 0.05).\n\nHowever, the levels of Ang\u2013(1\u20137) in normal PMVECs treated with A779 and LPS (A779 + LPS group; 10.12 \u00b1 2.80 ng/mL) were slightly less than these levels in the LPS group (15.49 \u00b1 3.41; P > 0.05), and those of the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group (16.23 \u00b1 5.17 ng/mL) were only slightly higher (P > 0.05; Fig 3B, 3D).\n\nRelative to the normal PMVECs in PBS (control group), in those stimulated with LPS for 48 h (LPS group) the ACE levels were higher and the ACE2 levels were lower, and therefore the ACE2/ACE ratio was significantly lower (Fig. 4A). However, in cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 receiving LPS only (ACE2 + LPS group), the ACE2/ACE ratio was comparable to the control group (P > 0.05). In contrast, cells infected with shRNA\u2013Ace2 receiving LPS only (shACE2 + LPS group), the ratio of ACE2/ACE ratio was lower than that of the LPS group.\n\nCompared with the ACE2/actin and ACE/actin levels of the LPS group (0.2924 and 0.6918, respectively), both of these were significantly lower in normal PMVECs treated with A779 prior to LPS (A779 + LPS group; 0.2187 and 0.5462; P < 0.05 for both). The ACE2/ACE ratio was also notably lower in the A779 + LPS group compared to the control group, but was not significantly different from that of the LPS group (Fig. 4B). In addition, compared with the ACE2/actin and ACE/actin levels of the normal cells treated with A779 and LPS (A779 + LPS group; 0.2187 and 0.5462, respectively), in the cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 and treated with both A779 and LPS (ACE2 + A779 + LPS group), ACE2/actin was significantly higher (0.3733; P < 0.05) while ACE/actin (0.4707) was similar (P > 0.05). As a result, the ratio of ACE2/ACE was much higher in the A779 + ACE2 + LPS group.\n\nThe western blot results showed that after normal PMVECs were incubated with LPS for 48 h (LPS group), phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, p38, and SAPK/JNK were significantly higher compared with the untreated control group (Fig 5A, 5C, 5E). Compared with the LPS group, PMVECs transduced with Ace2 and incubated with LPS (ACE2 + LPS group) had lower levels of phosphorylated p38 and SAPK/JNK, but levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation were not markedly less. In contrast, compared with the LPS group, PMVECs transduced with shRNA\u2013Ace2 and incubated with LPS (shACE2 + LPS group) had significantly higher ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels, but levels of phosphorylated p38 and SAPK/JNK were similar.\n\nPretreatment with A779 in LPS\u2013exposed cells (A779 + LPS group) was associated with significantly higher phosphorylation levels of all three MAPK pathways relative to cells of the LPS group. Whereas compared with the A779 + LPS group, the levels of phosphorylated p38 and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation in the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group were markedly lower (P < 0.05), there was no obvious difference in these levels between the ACE2 + A779 + LPS and LPS groups (P > 0.05; Fig. 5B, D, F). Furthermore, compared with the A779 + LPS group, the ERK1/2 phosphorylation level was only slightly less in the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group (P > 0.05), but significantly higher than that of the LPS group and the phosphorylation level in the A779 + LPS group was still more enhanced than in LPS group (P < 0.05).\n\nIn addition, the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the A779 + LPS group were approximately the same as that of the shACE2 + LPS group (P > 0.05), while the levels of phosphorylated p38 and SAPK/JNK were significantly higher (P < 0.05).\n\nThe phosphorylation of NF\u2013\u03baB p65 and expression of I\u03baB\u03b1 were examined by western blot (Fig. 6). LPS stimulation resulted in significantly increased level of NF\u2013\u03baB p65 phosphorylation and decreased level of I\u03baB\u03b1 expression in normal PMVECs. In the cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 and stimulated with LPS (ACE2 + LPS group), the NF\u2013\u03baB p65 phosphorylation level was significantly lower and I\u03baB\u03b1 expression level significantly higher than that in PMVECs stimulated with LPS only. In contrast, compared with the LPS group, PMVECs transduced with shRNA\u2013Ace2 and stimulated with LPS (shACE2 + LPS group) had significantly higher NF\u2013\u03baB p65 phosphorylation levels and lower I\u03baB\u03b1 expression levels.\n\nThe phosphorylation levels of NF\u2013\u03baB p65 were significantly higher and the I\u03baB\u03b1 levels lower in the cells stimulated with LPS and pretreated with A779 (A779 + LPS group) compared with the LPS group. The phosphorylated NF\u2013\u03baB p65 levels in the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group were significantly higher than that of the LPS group, but were not significantly different from the ACE2 + A779 + LPS and A779 + LPS groups. The I\u03baB\u03b1 levels in the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group was approximately similar to that of the LPS group, but was significantly increased compared with the A779 + LPS group.\n\nTo clarify whether inhibition of MAPK activation influences the effects of ACE2 and the Mas\u2013receptor antagonist on LPS\u2013induced PMVEC apoptosis, the cells were pre\u2013incubated with MAPK signaling pathway specific inhibitors SB203580, PD98059, or SP600125 before LPS stimulation (Fig. 7). Compared with the apoptosis level of 55.07% in the LPS group, only pretreatment with SP600125, with or without A779 pretreatment, significantly inhibited LPS\u2013induced apoptosis in normal, ACE2, or shACE2 transduced PMVECs, with apoptosis levels of 15.33%, 22.97%, 22.60% and 23.20% in the ACE2 + LPS + SP600125, shACE2 + LPS + SP600125, A779 + LPS + SP600125 and ACE2 + A779 + LPS + SP600125 groups, respectively (P < 0.05).\n\nThe apoptosis of cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 and stimulated with LPS was not significantly increased by SB203580 or PD98059 pretreatment (37.60% in the ACE2 + LPS group compared to 49.64% and 48.08% in the ACE2 + LPS + SB203580 and ACE2 + LPS + PD98059 groups, respectively, P > 0.05). The apoptosis levels of cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 and pretreated with both A779 and SB203580, or PD98059 prior to LPS stimulation were significantly higher than that of the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group, with 87.46% and 85.68% in the ACE2 + A779 + LPS + SB203580 and ACE2 + A779 + LPS + PD98059 groups, respectively, compared with 53.80% in the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group (P < 0.05).\n\nSB203580 or PD98059 pre\u2013treatment did not affect the apoptosis of cells infected with shACE2 or the normal cells pretreated with A779 before LPS stimulation, with 79.35% in the shACE2 + LPS + SB203580, 77.40% in the shACE2 + LPS + PD98059, 85.85% in the shACE2 + LPS, 89.87% in the A779 + LPS + SB203580 and 84.03% in the A779 + LPS + PD98059 groups, compared with 89.55% in the A779 + LPS group (P > 0.05).\n\nIn cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 and stimulated with LPS (ACE2 + LPS group), pretreatment with specific MAPK signaling inhibitors did not affect LPS\u2013induced IL\u20131\u03b2 or TNF\u2013\u03b1 secretions (Fig. 8A, 8B). In contrast, pre\u2013treatment with MAPK signaling inhibitors, especially the pretreatment with SP600125 in the PMVECs transduced with shRNA\u2013Ace2 and stimulated with LPS (shACE2 + LPS group), significantly suppressed cytokine secretion (Fig. 8C, 8D).\n\nIn PMVECs exposed to LPS, pretreatment with A779 significantly increased, but SB203580 and PD98059 slightly reduced and SP600125 significantly attenuated, IL\u20131\u03b2 and TNF\u2013\u03b1 secretions (Fig. 8E, 8F). In addition, pre\u2013incubation with SB203580 or PD98059 did not affect LPS\u2013induced IL\u20131\u03b2 or TNF\u2013\u03b1 secretions in the cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 and pretreated with A779 prior to LPS stimulation (ACE2 + A779 + LPS group). LPS\u2013induced IL\u20131\u03b2 and TNF\u2013\u03b1 secretions in the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group were significantly inhibited by pre\u2013incubation with SP600125 (Fig. 8G, 8H).\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the effect of overexpressed or shRNA\u2013inhibited Ace2 on LPS\u2013induced injury in lentivirus\u2013transduced PMVECs. We found that ACE2 overexpression attenuated apoptosis and IL\u20131\u03b2 and TNF\u2013\u03b1 secretion caused by LPS stimulation. Both Ace2 deletion and Mas receptor inhibition exhibited almost similar deteriorating effects on LPS\u2013induced damage and cytokine secretion, by blocking ACE2 overexpression. Therefore, the protective effects of ACE2 overexpression on LPS\u2013induced apoptosis and the inflammatory response may be through regulation of the ACE2/ACE/AngII/Ang\u2013(1\u20137)/Mas receptor.\n\nIn fact, ACE2 acts as a counter\u2013regulator of ACE in regulating the production of AngII and Ang\u2013(1\u20137)33. In addition, SARS\u2013CoV infections caused a downregulation of ACE2 expression in lungs, while ACE2 treatment protected mouse lungs from severe acute injury13. It is also noted that ACE2 expression in lung tissue was downregulated in a mouse ARDS model induced by acid aspiration, endotoxin, and peritoneal sepsis14. In the same study, loss of ACE2 expression in mutant mice resulted in more severe lung injury, enhanced vascular permeability, increased lung edema, and worsened lung function.\n\nWe found that AngII levels in cell supernatants were higher after LPS stimulation than before LPS stimulation. In addition, ACE2 overexpression reversed the imbalance of ACE2/ACE, and significantly reduced AngII and increased Ang(1\u20137) levels, thus reducing LPS\u2013induced apoptosis and inflammation. In contrast, the shRNA\u2013inhibited ACE2 expression aggravated the imbalance of ACE2/ACE, markedly increased AngII and decreased Ang(1\u20137) levels, to promote apoptosis and the inflammatory response caused by LPS exposure.\n\nThe Mas receptor blocker effectively abolished the protective effects of Ace2 transgenesis but the imbalance of ACE2/ACE was not affected. Treatment with Mas receptor blocker A779 before LPS stimulation also significantly increased AngII but had no obvious influence on Ang(1\u20137) levels. This may be ascribed to the significant suppression of ACE2 expression by the Mas receptor blocker. Therefore, the protective effect of ACE2 on LPS\u2013induced PMVEC injury may be via regulation of the ACE2/ACE/AngII/Ang\u2013(1\u20137)/Mas receptor. In fact, many reports suggest that AngII exerts pro\u2013inflammatory effects by inducing the release of cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species through AT1 receptors3435. AngII can also significantly induce apoptosis of pulmonary endothelial cells through the AT1 receptor, leading to damage in epithelial barrier function and increased permeability36.\n\nOn the other hand, Ang\u2013(1\u20137) binds to the specific G\u2013protein\u2013coupled receptor Mas to counteract AngII function (i.e., vasodilatory, anti\u2013growth, and anti\u2013proliferative effects). Overexpression of Ang(1\u20137) prevents bleomycin\u2013induced lung injury, and blockade of the Mas receptor abolishes the beneficial effects of Ang(1\u20137) against monocrotaline\u2013induced pulmonary hypertension37. Ang(1\u20137) attenuates ventilator\u2013 or acid aspiration\u2013induced lung injury and barrier failure of PMVECs, but this effect is again blocked by Mas receptor blockers38.\n\nMoreover, experimental results also indicate that unbalanced AngII/Ang(1\u20137) is associated with the development of ARDS, and a change in AngII/Ang(1\u20137) is closely related to the ratio of ACE2/ACE. In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of ventilated animals exposed to LPS, ACE2 activity is reduced, whereas ACE activity is enhanced, and these changes are in accord with enhanced BALF levels of AngII and reduced levels of Ang(1\u20137)32. After hind\u2013limb ischemia\u2013reperfusion, an imbalance in ACE2/ACE in local lung tissue is accompanied by changes in AngII/Ang(1\u20137)31. Thus, we believe that an imbalance in ACE2/ACE/AngII/Ang\u2013(1\u20137)/Mas receptor mediates lung injury, and regulation of RAS homeostasis by ACE2 may improve LPS\u2013induced lung injury.\n\nThe activation of MAPKs pathways has a key role in progression to acute lung injury but has not been fully elucidated in PMVECs after exposure to LPS1516. In the present study, we found that ACE2 overexpression significantly blocked LPS\u2013induced activation of the p38 and JNK pathways, which was strikingly prevented by administration of the Mas receptor blocker. This suggests that ACE2 is protective against LPS\u2013induced apoptosis of PMVECs and inflammation, perhaps through the Ang\u2013(1\u20137)/Mas pathway to modulate p38 and JNK phosphorylation. On the other hand, shRNA\u2013ACE2 enhanced LPS\u2013induced ERK phosphorylation but had no influence on p38 and JNK phosphorylation, whereas LPS\u2013mediated increased ERK phosphorylation was not affected by ACE2 overexpression in cells pretreated with the Mas receptor blocker. These results suggest that inhibited ACE2 aggravated LPS\u2013induced PMVEC apoptosis and inflammation mainly through the AngII/AT1 pathway to enhance ERK phosphorylation. In fact, activation of p38 MAPK and ERK is associated with TNF\u2013\u03b1\u2013induced increase of permeability in pulmonary endothelial cells, and the proliferation and survival of lung endothelial cells to maintain endothelial monolayer integrity may be by way of activating p38 MAPK39. Bleomycin induces cell apoptosis through the JNK phosphorylation pathway in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs)40. In addition, ACE2 regulates the balance of AngII/Ang(1\u20137) to inhibit apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells through blockade of JNK phosphorylation41.\n\nWe also performed additional experiments to determine whether the ACE2/Ang\u2013(1\u20137)/Mas axis prevents the LPS\u2013induced inflammatory response and apoptosis of rat PMVECs via inhibition of p38 and JNK phosphorylation. We found that the protective effect of ACE2 overexpression on LPS\u2013induced apoptosis was enhanced by the JNK inhibitor and deteriorated by p38 and ERK inhibition. The JNK inhibitor markedly reduced apoptosis and cytokine secretion in PMVECs with Ace2 deletion and pretreatment with the Mas receptor antagonist. The Mas receptor antagonist abolished the protective effect of ACE2, which was aggravated by p38 and ERK inhibitors but was reversed by JNK inhibition. Therefore, these data suggest that ACE2/Ang\u2013(1\u20137)/Mas may have a protective effect on LPS\u2013induced apoptosis and inflammation in PMVECs, mainly through inhibition of the JNK pathway.\n\nIn the present study, we found that ACE2 overexpression significantly inhibited LPS\u2013induced activation of the NF\u2013\u03baB and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 protein, which was strikingly reversed by the Mas receptor antagonist. In addition, both the ACE2 downregulation and A779 pretreatment enhanced NF\u2013\u03baB phosphorylation and further degraded I\u03baB\u03b1 protein, suggesting that the NF\u2013\u03baB pathway is also important in the prevention of ACE2/Ang\u2013(1\u20137)/Mas from LPS\u2013induced PMVEC apoptosis and inflammation. In fact, NF\u2013\u03baB binds to I\u03baB\u03b1 in the cytoplasm, but once dissociated from I\u03baB\u03b1, NF\u2013\u03baB is activated and translocates into the nucleus to upregulate transcription of several inflammatory genes4546. The NF\u2013\u03baB cascade is pivotal to the intracellular signaling pathway involved in apoptosis and the inflammatory response, and activation of NF\u2013\u03baB is central to the regulation of pulmonary inflammation and involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS424344. LPS\u2013induced lung injury is associated with activation of MAPKs and NF\u2013\u03baB signaling pathways47; the inhibition of ERK or p38 protects against LPS\u2013induced lung injury by inhibiting the NF\u2013kB pathway2848. Pretreatment with Ang\u2013(1\u20137) prevents AngII\u2013induced lung fibroblast apoptotic resistance by inhibiting the MAPK/NF\u2013kB pathway49.\n\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that abnormal activation of RAS with unbalanced AngII/Ang(1\u20137) levels, induced by the imbalance of ACE2/ACE expression, is closely related to LPS\u2013mediated apoptosis and inflammation in PMVECs. Furthermore, ACE2 exerts protective effects on LPS\u2013induced apoptosis and inflammation in PMVECs through suppression of the JNK/NF\u2013kB signaling pathways. Our findings imply that ACE2 may be applied to improve LPS\u2013induced lung injury via regulation of the ACE2/ACE/AngII/Ang\u2013(1\u20137)/Mas receptor, by inhibiting the JNK/NF\u2013kB signaling pathway, and that upregulation of the ACE2/Ang\u2013(1\u20137)/Mas axis and inhibition of JNK/NF\u2013kB activation may be an effective therapeutic strategy against ARDS in clinic.\n\nA limitation of this study is that the results did not address the crosstalk between MAPK and NF\u2013kB signaling pathways. Further studies are necessary to investigate possible crosstalk among the intracellular signaling pathways involved in the effects of Ang(1\u20137)/Mas receptor on LPS\u2013induced PMVEC apoptosis by administration of Ang\u2013(1\u20137) in ACE2\u2013deleted PMVECs exposed to LPS in vitro. In addition, whether Ang(1\u20137)/Mas receptor leads to the prevention of acute lung injury through MAPK/NF\u2013kB signaling pathways in vivo should be addressed.\n\nL.Y.C. proposed the hypothesis, designed the experiments and wrote the manuscript.
