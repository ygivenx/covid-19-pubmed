{"title": "Nelfinavir was predicted to be a potential inhibitor of 2019-nCov main protease by an integrative approach combining homology modelling, molecular docking and binding free energy calculation", "body": "In December 2019, cluster of patients with pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 1, 2 Shortly, a new coronavirus, temporally named 2019-nCov, was identified to be the cause of the disease, which is the seventh member of the family betacoronavirus. 1 More than 2,700 infection cases and 80 deaths were reported as of 27\n\nJanuary 2020 from China. In addition, infection cases have been reported from Thailand, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, France, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Vietnam, Canada and Nepal, indicating that the disease is a potential threat to the global health. 3 Sadly, the number is still growing rapidly and no drug has been approved to be effective. Therefore, it is urgent to discover and develop drugs to cure the disease.\n\nBased on its function, the main protease (M pro ) or chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ) 4 is suggested to be a potential drug target to combat 2019-nCov, which is highly conservable among coronaviruses. Sequence alignment revealed that the M pro of 2019-nCov shares 96% similarity with that of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) (Figure 1 ). Studies for identifying the inhibitors of 2019-nCov M pro were quickly performed for discovering and developing drugs against the disease. For example, Hualiang Jiang and collaborators identified 30 drugs and compounds as the M pro inhibitors via protein modelling and virtual screening, which is a rapid progress in the way to cope with the crisis. In addition, one of the 30 drugs/compounds, remdesivir, was also suggested to be potential inhibitor against 2019-nCov by Liu et al, 5 For finding more potential drugs as inhibitors of the protein, we modelled the 2019-nCov M pro structures using SARS M pro (PDB ID: 2GTB) as template and docked 1903 approved drugs against the model in this study. Fifteen drugs were selected based on the docking score and three dimensional (3D) similarity to available M pro inhibitors against other coronavirus. For validation, we modelled 10 additional new models of 2019-nCov M pro and docked the 15 drugs against the new models, which revealed that 6 drugs (nelfinavir, praziquantel, pitavastatin, perampanel, eszopiclone, and zopiclone) have good binding modes with the new models. Binding free energy calculation were then performed for 4 of the 6 drugs using MM/GBSA and SIE methods. Nelfinavir was identified as the best one with predicted binding free energies of -24.69\u00b10.52 kcal/mol by MM/GBSA and -9.42\u00b10.04 kcal/mol by SIE, respectively. Taking into account its high 3D similarity of binding mode to the known M pro inhibitor, we proposed that nelfinavir should be a potential inhibitor against 2019-nCov M pro .\n\n2.1 Homology modelling. 43 M pro complexes with ligands were downloaded from protein data bank 6 (PDB IDs: 1WOF, 2A5I, 2A5K, 2ALV, 2AMD, 2GTB, 2GX4, 2GZ7,   2GZ8, 2OP9, 2QIQ, 2V6N, 2ZU4, 2ZU5, 3SN8, 3SND, 3SZN, 3TIT, 3TIU, 3TNS,   3TNT, 3V3M, 4F49, 4MDS, 4TWW, 4TWY, 4WY3, 4YLU, 4YOG, 4YOI, 4YOJ,   4ZRO, 5C5N, 5C5O, 5EU8, 5N5O, 5N19, 5NH0, 5WKJ, 5WKK, 5WKL, 5WKM, author/funder.

The hydrogens were added to 2019-nCov M pro model by pdb2pqr (--ff=amber --ffout=amber --chain --with-ph=7). 13 Then the model was converted to pdbqt format by prepare_receptor4.py script in MGLToos version 1.5.6. 10 The ligand in 2GTB was used to define the grid and the buffer space was set to 6.0 \u00c5 (autobox_add). The random seed was explicitly set to 0 (seed). The exhaustiveness of the global search was set to 32 (exhaustiveness) and at most 1 binding mode was generated for each drug (num_modes). MolShaCS, which utilized Gaussianbased description of molecular shape and charge distribution, was used to calculate the 3D similarities between approved drugs and available M pro inhibitors. 14 2.4 Molecular dynamics simulation. Each simulation system was immersed in a cubic box of TIP3P water that was extended by 9 \u00c5 from the solute, with a rational number of counter ions of Na + or Clto neutralize the system. General Amber force field (GAFF) 15 and Amber ff03 force field 16 were used to parameterize the ligand and protein, respectively. 10,000 steps of minimization with constraints (10 kcal/mol/\u00c5 2 ) on heavy atoms of complex, including 5,000 steps of steepest descent minimization and 5,000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization, was used to optimize each system. Then each system was heated to 300 K within 0.2 ns followed by 0.1 ns equilibration in NPT ensemble. Finally, 5 ns MD simulation on each system at 300 K was performed. The minimization, heating and equilibrium are performed with sander program in Amber16.\n\nThe 5 ns production run was performed with pmemd.cuda.\n\nBased on the 5 ns MD simulation trajectory, bind author/funder.

After visualizing the docked complexes carefully, we selected 15 drugs (Table 2) for further analysis. There are some differences between the conformations of the protein in the 3D similarity reference and 2GTB model. Therefore, we modelled 10 new homology models using the proteins in 3D similarity reference as templates and we redocked the 15 drugs to the 10 new homology models. 6 drugs (nelfinavir, pitavastatin, perampanel, praziquantel, zopiclone, and eszopiclone) show good docking scores and binding modes (Table 3) . Because eszopiclone and zopiclone was used to treat insomnia in a low dosage which may not be suitable to treat pneumonia, we carried out further binding free energy calculation for the rest 4 drugs. author/funder.

To provide insight into their binding mechanisms, the binding free energies were calculated by MM/GBSA and SIE approaches. In results of the MM/GBSA approach, the calculated binding free energies of nelfinavir-2GX4, pitavastatin-2GTB, perampanel-5NH0, and praziquantel-3V3M, are -24.69\u00b10.52, -12.70\u00b10.38, -14.98\u00b10.34, and -6.51\u00b10.21 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 4) , which highlight nelfinavir as the most active one. In pitavastatin-2GTB, perampanel-5NH0, and praziquantel-3V3M, the van der Waals interaction (E vdw ) makes a more significant contribution than the electrostatic interaction (E ele ) ( \n\nAs shown in Figure 2 , the binding model of nelfinavir in its docking complex turned out to be very similar with that of the original ligand (TG-0205221) 25 author/funder.

However, there is no approved drug to treat the disease.\n\n2019-nCov M pro is a potential drug target to combat the virus, which shares 96% sequence similarity with the corresponding one in SARS. We built 11 homology models of 2019-nCov M pro and docked 1903 approved small molecule drugs to the 2GTB model. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of binding mode to 39 known M pro binders, 15 drugs were selected for further evaluation. The 15 drugs were then docked to all the 11 homology models, leading to 4 drugs for binding energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE calculations voted for nelfinavir, a HIV-1 protease inhibitor to treat HIV. Therefore, we suggested that nelfinavir might be active against 2019-nCov M pro .
