{"title": "Broad Spectrum Antiviral Agent Niclosamide and Its Therapeutic\nPotential", "body": "Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped and nonsegmented positive-sense RNA viruses with\nvery large genome size ranging from approximately 27 to 34 kb. Infections with human\nstrains HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause mild, self-limiting\nrespiratory infections such as the common cold.2,24 Nevertheless, in the past 17 years, three beta\ncoronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and this year\u2019s SARS-CoV-2) have caused severe\nhuman disease pandemics associated with high morbidity and mortality. The outbreak of SARS\nin southern China between November 2002 and July 2003 eventually resulted in 8098\nconfirmed cases and 774 deaths reported in 17 countries with a mortality rate of 9%, while\nMERS, first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, has caused a total of 2519\nlaboratory-confirmed cases including 866 associated deaths with a fatality rate of nearly\n34% at the end of January 2020.25,26 The lack of effective treatment for coronavirus infections poses a\ngreat challenge to clinical management and highlights the urgent need for new drug\ndiscovery. Wu et al. found that niclosamide was able to inhibit SARS-CoV replication and\ntotally abolished viral antigen synthesis at a concentration of 1.56 \u03bcM after\nscreening a small marketed drug library.27 Niclosamide suppressed the\ncytopathic effect (CPE) of SARS-CoV at a concentration of as low as 1 \u03bcM and\ninhibited SARS-CoV replication with an EC50 value of less than 0.1 \u03bcM in\nVero E6 cells.28 SARS-CoV 3CL protease plays an important role in\nreplicase polyprotein processing and serves as a key target for anti-SARS drug\ndiscovery.29\u221231 A series of\n2-chloro-4-nitroanilide derivatives was discovered as potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV\n3CL protease. Interestingly, niclosamide showed no obvious inhibitory activity against\nSARS-CoV 3CL protease up to 50 \u03bcM, and mechanistically, it may exert its anti-SARS\nactivity via other modes of action.32\n\nGassen et al. revealed that E3 ligase S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) executes\nlysine-48-linked polyubiquitination of Benclin 1 (BECN1), resulting in its proteasomal\ndegradation. SKP2 inhibition increases the BENC1 level, enhances autophagy, and\nefficiently reduces MERS-CoV replication.33 Niclosamide was reported to\ninhibit MERS-CoV replication by up to 1000-fold at 48 h p.i. at a concentration of 10\n\u03bcM, while it enhanced the BENC1 level and ATG14 oligomerization, increased the\nnumber of autolysosomes by >2-fold, and affected the autophagic flux in the\nMERS-CoV-infected cells.33 Since niclosamide is a multifunctional drug,\nwe cannot exclude the possibility that it exerts its anti-MERS activity by regulating\nother targets besides SKP2 inhibition.\n\nFlavivirus, a genus of viruses in the family Flaviviridae, includes the\nZika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus four serotypes (DENV 1\u20134), West Nile virus (WNV),\nyellow fever virus (YFV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Many of these viruses are\nsignificant human pathogens. Among these viruses, ZIKV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that\nis transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. ZIKV infection can cause\ninfants to be born with microcephaly and can trigger neurologic conditions in adults such\nas Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, neuropathy, and myelitis.34\u221238 Outbreaks of ZIKV infection have been recorded several\ntimes (2015 in Brazil, the latest one), and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared\nZIKV to be a global public health emergency. Xu et al. used caspase-3 activity as the\nprimary screening assay and discovered niclosamide as a potent inhibitor of ZIKV\ninfection, displaying an IC50 value of 0.37 \u03bcM against the intracellular\nZIKV RNA level.22 The time-of-addition studies indicated that\nniclosamide inhibits ZIKV infection at a postentry stage, probably in a viral RNA\nreplication step. Our research team also identified niclosamide as a potent anti-ZIKV\ninhibitor through an independent quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) campaign\nand found that niclosamide directly inhibits flavivirus NS2B-NS3 interactions.14 Protease complex NS2B-NS3 is essential for flaviviral polyprotein\nprocessing.39\u221241 Our team also found that\nniclosamide is a broad-spectrum inhibitor against other flaviviruses including DENV-2,\nWNV, JEV, and YFV, with potencies similar to that for ZIKV.14\n\nIn addition, Fang et al. developed a CPE-based HTS assay to screen 1280 pharmacologically\nactive compounds and identified niclosamide as a potent JEV inhibitor with micromolar\npotency.42 The time-of-addition studies showed that niclosamide\ninhibits JEV at the stage of replication.\n\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped positive-sense single-strand RNA virus of the\nfamily Flaviviridae which is transmitted mainly through blood infection.\nHCV can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis, and hepatitis C is a major cause of liver\ncancer. It was estimated that about 71 million people have chronic HCV infections\nworldwide.43 At present, there is no effective vaccine against\nhepatitis C, although clinically approved therapeutics are available. Niclosamide was\nreported to show very promising activity against HCV replication with an EC50\nvalue of 0.16 \u03bcM.44 It likely inhibits HCV replication via\nmodulation of the host cell process similar to that of its derivatives nitazoxanide and\ntizoxanide.45\u221247 However, chronic HCV\ninfection requires long-term (several months) antiviral treatment, which may make a\nhost-targeted approach less attractive.\n\nEbola virus (EBOV) is an enveloped negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs\nto the genus Ebolavirus of the family Filoviridae. EBOV\nis introduced into humans from wild animals and spreads in the human population through\nperson-to-person transmission. Ebola virus disease (EVD), known as Ebola hemorrhagic\nfever, has a high fatality rate, ranging from 25 to 90% in past outbreaks. Through a\nsystematic screen of FDA-approved drugs, niclosamide was identified as one of the most\npotent EBOV inhibitors with an EC50 value of 1.5 \u03bcM, although its\nin vivo efficacy has not yet been evaluated in animal models.48\n\nHuman rhinoviruses (HRVs) are nonenveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses\nthat belong to the genus Enterovirus of the family\nPicornaviridae. There are more than 100 different HRV strains\nclassified into three species (HRV A\u2013C). HRVs are widespread among humans and the\nprimary cause of the common cold, posing serious health risks for patients with asthma,\nchronic pulmonary disease, and severe bronchiolitis in infants and children.49 Niclosamide is a weak lipophilic acid and was reported to inhibit\npH-dependent HRV infection with low micromolar IC50 values; it suppresses HRV\nentry by blocking the acidification of the endolysosomal compartments, acting as a proton\ncarrier.50\n\nChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the\ngenus Alphavirus of the family Togaviridae. CHIKV causes\nfever and joint pain, is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes, and is cataloged as a\nrisk group-3 pathogen. Currently, there is no effective antiviral therapy approved for\nChikungunya. Niclosamide was discovered as a potent anti-CHIKV inhibitor with a low\nmicromolar EC50 value; it not only affects CHIKV entry via blocking\nlow-pH-dependent virus fusion but also inhibits the cell-to-cell transmission of CHIKV\ninfection.51\n\nHuman adenoviruses (HAdVs) are nonenveloped double-stranded DNA viruses with icosahedral\ncapsids. HAdVs comprise more than 70 different serotypes classified into seven species\n(HAdV A\u2013G). HAdV infections can cause severe and often life-threatening diseases in\nimmunosuppressed patients. Currently, no specific antiviral therapy is available to treat\nthese infections. Three salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs including niclosamide were\nscreened out as potent anti-HAdV inhibitors. Niclosamide showed very promising anti-HAdV\nactivity with an EC50 value of 0.6 \u03bcM in the plaque assay. Subsequent\nmechanistic studies indicated that niclosamide inhibits the transport of the HAdV particle\nfrom the endosome to the nuclear envelop.52\n\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4, has a toroid-shaped\nprotein core containing a linear double-stranded DNA genome of 184 kb in size which is a\nmember of the gamma subfamily of herpes viruses. EBV is widely spread in humans and\ninfects over 95% of humans in the first decades of their life, resulting in a\nlymphoproliferative disorder known as infectious mononucleosis. EBV infection was also\nfound to be associated with the development of several types of cancer such as\nBurkitt\u2019s lymphoma, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.53 Huang et al. demonstrated that niclosamide inhibits EBV lytic replication\nin lymphoma cells and epithelial cells and causes irreversible cell cycle arrest in lytic\nEBV-infected cells via disrupting mTOR activation, offering the potential to treat acute\nEBV-associated infectious diseases.54\n\nNiclosamide has traditionally been used to treat tapeworm infections for many years, and it\nis inexpensive and well tolerated in vivo with an extremely high acute oral\nLD50 value of >5000 mg/kg in rats (niclosamide ethanolamine salt).10 In human medicines, single oral doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 g of niclosamide are\nrecommended for children under 2 years, children between 2 and 6 years, and children older\nthan 6 years and adults, respectively, to treat infections with Taenia\nsolium, T. saginata, and Diphyllobothrium\nlatum.10 Human infections with rat tapeworm\nHymenolepis diminuta were eliminated by 5\u20137 daily doses of 2 g of\nniclosamide each, while the treatment of Hymenolepis nana infection\nrequires one or several 5\u20137 day courses of niclosamide treatment. One 7 day course\nregimen for adults is 2 g of niclosamide on day 1 followed by 1 g daily for 6\ndays.10,55 When\ntreating human volunteers each with a single oral dose of 2000 mg of niclosamide, the\nmaximum serum concentration of niclosamide was equivalent to 0.25\u20136.0 \u03bcg/mL\n(0.76\u201318.3 \u03bcM). The wide concentration range was caused by the intraindividual\nabsorption differences. Niclosamide is only partially absorbed from the intestinal tract,\nand the absorbed part is rapidly eliminated by the kidneys with no cumulative toxic effects\nin human.10 Through a series of drug repurposing screening campaigns,\nniclosamide was found to be effective against a variety of human conditions such as cancer\nand viral infections. Currently, there are four ongoing human clinical trials of niclosamide\nin ulcerative colitis, prostate carcinoma, and colorectal cancer in the ClinicalTrails.gov\nclinical trials registry.56 Of note, niclosamide has several weaknesses\nsuch as unneglectable cytotoxicity and limited aqueous solubility as well as relatively low\nabsorption and oral bioavailability (F = 10%), which may hamper its\nextensive clinical development as an antiviral agent.57 Our group has\nmade substantial efforts in medicinal chemistry based on niclosamide as a lead compound and\ndiscovered a series of O-alkylamino-tethered derivatives as potent and\norally bioavailable anticancer agents with improved aqueous solubility16\nand diversified salicylamide derivatives as potent anti-HAdV inhibitors with increased\npotency (submicromolar IC50s) and significantly decreased cytotoxicity likely by\ntargeting different steps in the HAdV life cycle.58 The ester derivative\nprodrug of niclosamide was also reported to increase its systemic drug exposure and extend\nthe duration of exposure.59 The development of nanobased formulations is\nanother useful strategy for improving the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of\nniclosamide and maximizing its therapeutic potential for clinical\napplications.60\u221262\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared to be a public health emergency of international\nconcern by the WHO, and the development of effective therapies for fast-spreading fatal\nCOVID-19 is in an urgent need. 3CL protease is a key enzyme that is responsible for\nproteolytic processing and is indispensable for viral replication and the infection\nprocess.6 Recently, the high-resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2\n3CL protease has been solved by Zihe Rao and Haitao Yang (PDB ID: 6LU7, Figure 2), and this may significantly facilitate the discovery of potent\nsmall-molecule inhibitors of COVID-19 by targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease via\nhigh-throughput virtual screening of compound libraries or existing drug libraries for drug\nrepurposing. In addition, Wrapp et al. have determined a cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2\nspike (S) glycoprotein trimer in the prefusion conformation that will also facilitate\nvaccine development and the discovery of antiviral therapeutics for COVID-19.63 Although these crystal structures may provide new insights and helpful\ninformation for future drug discovery, extensive efforts are needed to identify effective\nbinding pockets for small molecules and validate the drug targets.\n\nIt is reported that some existing drugs or drug candidates such as remdesivir, an\nRNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor, and lopinavir/ritonavir (protease inhibitors)\nagainst Ebola or HIV may be repurposed through fast-track human clinical trials as effective\ntherapies to combat deadly COVID-19 and save hundreds of patient lives.7,64,65 Very recently,\nthrough screening the existing antiviral drugs, three broad antiviral agents (nitazoxanide,\nremdesivir, and chloroquine) were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar\nconcentrations in Vero E6 cells with EC50 values of 2.12, 0.77, and 1.13\n\u03bcM, respectively.66 Nitazoxanide is a prodrug of tizoxanide, which\nshares considerable structural similarity with niclosamide as a salicylamide\nderivative.47 Notably, niclosamide displays promising inhibitory\nactivity against SARS-CoV replication with an EC50 value of less than 0.1\n\u03bcM in Vero E6 cells and inhibits MERS-CoV replication by up to 1000-fold at 48 h p.i.\nat a concentration of 10 \u03bcM in Vero B4 cells.28,33 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus\nBetacoronavirus, the same as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sharing 79.5%\nsequence identify to that of SARS-CoV.67 These findings, together with\nits broad antiviral properties, indicate that niclosamide, an inexpensive and well-tolerated\nold drug, may be repurposed with therapeutic potential applications to combat COVID-19. We\nenvision that once its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity is validated in animal models or human\nclinical trials, niclosamide and its optimized analogues may be developed as effective\nantiviral therapeutics with the potential to benefit numerous infected patients in this\noutbreak of COVID-19."}
