{"title": "Letters to the Editor Characterization of three clade 2.3.4.4 H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses isolated from wild birds", "body": ". Isoelectric focusing for VZV IgG. Isoelectric focusing of paired CSF and serum ( A and B ) stained for IgG in CSF, showing prominent oligoclonal bands in CSF, but absent from serum (consistent with local or intrathecal synthesis). The patterns have been aligned against the prominent band in the centre of the pattern on CSF to allow easy comparison. Although the distribution of bands appears slightly different between CSF samples this just reflects inter-assay variability in the analytical system (each sample pair was run on a different gel). The anode ( + ) electrode is on the left. The paired CSF and serum in images A and B are from samples taken approximately two months apart during acute illness episodes. temporaneous serum VZV DNA PCR was mostly negative except once when it was positive at a very low level (63 copies/ml of VZV DNA). Repeat isoelectric focusing and immune-blotting revealed an intrathecal oligoclonal IgG response, together with a VZV-specific monoclonal IgG response ( Fig. 2 ).\n\nFurther treatment with oral valacyclovir (10 0 0 mg TDS for 7 days) followed by a suppressive dose (valacyclovir, 500 mg BD) for three months was then tried. However, the patient continued to experience meningitis symptoms on this medication. Treatment was continued with oral valacyclovir (10 0 0 mg BD), but now in combination with monthly VZV hyper-immune globulin (VZIG, IM, 400 units). Although there was some improvement, the meningitis symptoms recurred every 3 weeks.\n\nSeveral years later, we received an update from the patient. He had been on holiday in South Africa, during which he had mistakenly received 3 doses of the paediatric varicella vaccine instead of the regular VZIG. His symptoms improved for 4-5 weeks. On returning to The Netherlands, on this basis, his neurologist suggested zoster vaccine (which contains at least 19,400 PFU -plaque forming units -of VZV, per dose) for longer-term symptom relief. As this was not yet available, he was given 18 doses of paediatric varicella vaccine (which contains at least 1350 PFU, per dose) instead. This resolved his symptoms. He then received a depot corticosteroid injection for shoulder pain, after which his meningitis symptoms returned 3 weeks later. After a further 18-dose course of paediatric varicella vaccine, he has remained symptom-free.\n\nVaricella-zoster virus remains latent in the neurons of cranial nerves and dorsal root ganglia for the entire life of the host after primary infection (chickenpox). 3 Herpes zoster or shingles is the most common form of VZV reactivation and is characterised by a dermatomal rash and radicular pain. Rarely, VZV spreads to the spinal cord and brain. When this occurs, CNS complications may develop without concomitant zoster rash. 4 . This pattern is also just visible in the serum samples. The ladderpattern is characteristic of a monoclonal antibody. Due to the strong staining, the anodic (left-most) bands have merged. The absence of any bands in the control immunoblot (using a cell-line without VZV, B ) shows that the IgG in the patient's CSF and serum is highly VZV-specific.\n\nto VZV is seen in both immunocompetent as well as immunocompromised patients. 6 The diagnosis is usually confirmed by a positive CSF VZV DNA PCR result, or less commonly, by the intrathecal detection of VZV-specific IgG. 7 The repeated failure to detect CSF VZV DNA in this case during acute episodes may be due to the chronic course of the disease. A similar decrease in the percentage of CSF HSV PCR-positive cases can be seen within 2 weeks for HSV encephalitis, 8 which may also be true for VZV. The onset of symptoms in this patient was 2 years before the first CSF VZV PCR was performed. His symptoms were also limited to viral meningitis rather evolving into encephalitis, which may have also explained the negative VZV PCR results. 9 However, the extensive intrathecal VZV IgG production confirmed the diagnosis of VZV aseptic viral meningitis.\n\nThe finding of a distinctly monoclonal intrathecal VZV-specific IgG is unusual and atypical ( Fig. 2 ) . Normally, an oligoclonal response is required to clear the virus efficiently. Therefore, the patient may have a defect in his VZV-specific antibody affinity maturation, i.e. a partial 'immunological scotoma' to VZV, explaining his inability to clear (i.e. 'neutralise') the virus efficiently, allowing recurrent episodes of meningitis. Note that this case does not meet Bruyn's diagnostic criteria for Mollaret's meningitis, 10 as the patient was not completely symptom-free between episodes.\n\nTo our knowledge, such chronic-relapsing varicella zoster viral meningitis of such periodicity has not been previously described. The remarkable response to multiple doses of paediatric varicella vaccine was both fortunate and serendipitous. This patient likely suffers from a VZV-specific antibody maturation deficit that appears to have been overcome by the massive immune stimulation provided by multiple doses of paediatric varicella vaccine. Whilst such cases are rare, this report may assist in their management.\n\nTo the editors , We would like to take the opportunity to comment on the systematic review by Alene et al. 1 The authors pooled data of prevalence in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). However, we found that prevalence differed extremely among a Only the total number of psychosis and depression was reported ( n = 33). b Only baseline information before treatment initiation was reported. c For diverse tools were applied in prevalence estimate of depression and diagnosis standard was not uniformed, we did not extract some event numbers in this Table. studies, ranged from 3% to 79%, leading to a high statistical heterogeneity ( I 2 = 98%).\n\nAfter checking, we surprisingly found that only four studies reported the prevalence of depression after MDR-TB treatment, one study reported the prevalence at baseline, while the others reported the incidence of depression as an adverse effect of MDR-TB treatment ( Table 1 ). The authors may not carefully distinguish the conception of prevalence and incidence. In addition, for those studies adopting different scales and diagnosis criteria, the prevalence rate may change according to the criteria. It is not recommended to pool these data into meta-analysis. We hope future studies can adopt a unified standard of depression in the research, to better estimate the prevalence of depression after MDR-TB treatment.\n\nThe we conducted a meta-analysis by STATA 15.1, to calculate the incidence of depression as an adverse effect of MDR-TB treatment. The results showed an incidence rate of 11% (95% Confidence Intervals: 8-14%, I 2 = 77.5%) ( Fig. 1 ) . We consider that this result may provide more reference to clinical doctors.\n\nThe authors have discussed that the cause of psychosis may be cycloserine. 1 In addition, several studies mentioned that depression might also be an adverse effect of cycloserine. 2, 3 To summarize, we appreciate the authors' hard work, but there were some mistakes in data pooling. We estimated the incidence rate of depression as an adverse effect of MDR-TB treatment by performing a meta-analysis. Future studies are needed to estimate the prevalence.\n\nNone. \n\nDear editor , We previously reported in this Journal that, 1 in early 2016, the public authority of China enforced the detection of imported zika cases in international airports regarding to the continuing global transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV). During February to September, 2016, 28 imported ZIKV infection cases were detected in China, of which 15 were imported from Venezuela, Suriname and Guatemala to Enping County, Guangdong, China ( Fig. 1 ) where is the hometown of more than 450,0 0 0 Guangdong residents work and live in South America and South Pacifica countries. Most of these residents maintain their permanent home and travel frequently between Enping County and ZIKV endemic countries in South America or South Pacifica. Therefore, Enping was considered as the most threaten area by ZIKV in Guangdong, China due to high incidence of importation of zika cases. Additionally, Guangdong Province is a hyper-endemic areas of arboviruses located in Southern China, where both Aedes albopictus and aegypti mosquitoes are encountered simultaneously. Dengue occurred annually. Chikungunya were also occasionally imported and caused an local outbreak in 2010. 2 , 3 However, whether there were previously importation of ZIKV within returned ex-patriot Chinese in Enping, Guangdong, China and result in unware local transmission before 2016 in na\u00efve population is still remained unknown.\n\nDuring February to October 2016, a community based serological surveillance study of returned ex-patriot Chinese and na\u00efve population was conducted in Enping County, Guangdong Province, China to address whether those populations have been exposed to ZIKV before the importation in 2016. The 227 ex-patriot Chinese were randomly selected from 1161 Guangdong residents work and live in South America and South Pacifica countries returned to Enping County. The information of returned ex-patriot Chinese (travelers in total, 227; male, 129; female, 98; range 1-76 years old) were informed by entry-exit inspection and quarantine bureau of Guangdong Province. All these travelers showed no symptoms of ZIKV infection, either fever ( > 38 \u00b0C), rash, arthralgia or conjunctivitis. Local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff contacted these travelers at the time of their arrival in Enping County by phone or household visits. Blood sample were taken at the local hospital upon their arrival, and transferred to the Guangdong Provincial CDC for serum separation and ZIKV RNA testing. The na\u00efve population were choosed from the communities in Enping County where the 15 imported zika cases detected, and in a neighbors Heshan County (fifty kilometers away from Enping) where most of the oversea Chinese live in non ZIKV endemic areas of Southeast Asia ( Fig. 1 ) . The na\u00efve population was recruit from the local residents who have no travel history to ZIKV endemic areas of South America and South Pacifica countries, and without any contact history with imported zika cases. Finally, a total of 665 na\u00efve residents (male, 278; female, 387; range 1-95 years old) were recruit, of which 330 and 335 came from Enping and Heshan County, respectively. The blood samples of these 665 residents were taken from each of them, and transferred to the local CDC. A total of 892 serum samples were collected and transferred to Guangdong Provincial CDC for further ZIKV RNA and neutrality antibody detection.\n\nThe quantity of ZIKV RNA Envelope gene was determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) as we previously reported. 4 No ZIKV RNA were detected among all the 892 serum samples which indicated no acute stage infection of ZIKV. Although cross-reactive binding antibodies are commonly detected in flavivirus-immune serum, neutralization assays are more specific and can distinguish the antibodies response to various flaviviruses exposure previously, 5 thus, serum antibodies against to ZIKV in both 227 returned and 665 na\u00efve residents were determined to make sure whether those persons exposed to ZIKV or not by a Vero cell based micro-neutralization assay against to ZIKV, CHIKV, DENV 1, and DENV 2. The results indicated that ZIKV could be neutralized by serum samples of 32 (No. 1-32) (14.1%, 32/227) returned persons (IC 50 range from 1:8 to 1:1024) who had travel history in South America and South Pacific areas ( Table 1 ) . Twenty one of these 32 ZIKV antibody positive serum samples showed across-neutrality effects against to DENV-2 but not DENV-1. Four of these 32 samples showed minor cross-neutrality effects against to CHIKV (IC 50 range from 1:8 to 1:32). Moreover, 18 serum samples from returned persons showed minor cross-neutralization against to CHIKV (No. 33-50, IC 50 range from 1:8 to 1:32) but not ZIKV or DENV. Surprisingly, one serum samples (No. 51) from one na\u00efve resident in Enping County showed significantly neutrality ability against to ZIKV (IC 50 = 1:1024) and CHIKV (IC 50 = 1:1024), while the remained 664 of 665 na\u00efve residents samples showed no any neutrality effects against to ZIKV, CHIKV, as well as DENV.\n\nTransmission of infection through international travel is a growing health issue, and the frequency of imported infection is increasing in China. The recently studies report the profile of travel-related infections among arriving travelers in mainland China, and highlight to increase public awareness of the potential risk of imported infections. 6 Indeed, the global transmission of ZIKV has been suspected through international travelers between endemic areas and local countries, and addressed by recently phylodynamic analysis. 7, 8 In Guangdong, China, the airport active screening system found 18 imported zika cases which indicate Guangdong is under a high risk of zika transmission due to wide distribution of competent vector of ZIKV, Aedes albopictus and aegypti . Although the present community based follow-up serological survey found 14.10% (32/227) of ex-patriot Chinese returned from ZIKV endemic countries were ever exposed to ZIKV, none of them were ZIKV cases at acute stage according to the results of ZIKV RNA detection. In contrast, we found most of na\u00efve residents were not exposure to ZIKV. In addition, ZIKV antibody positive serum samples from returned population showed minor crossneutrality effects against to DENV-2 and CHIKV but not DENV-1.\n\nIt is not surprising because of continuously circulation of DENV-2 and CHIKV in South American countries, 9, 10 therefore, those travelers may have been infected by DENV-2 or CHIKV before they returned to China. However, we did not observed any crossneutrality effects against to ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV among the 665 na\u00efve residents except for the unique suspect asymptomatic ZIKV and CHIKV case who do not want declare his travel history.\n\nIn conclusion, this report indicated that although numbers of zika case had been imported to a hyper endemic area of arboviruses in Guangdong, China, the community based surveillance of na\u00efve populations showed ZIKV was only tentatively imported to Guangdong, whereas no local transmission has been established in Guangdong, China before 2016. It highlight the control strategies taken by public health authorities in Guangdong 2016 probably prevent the onward transmission of ZIKV in these areas. In recent years, pathogenicity and transmissibility as well as increasing potential human infection ability of H5N6 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been documented in this journal. 1,2 Since 2003, H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) have become enzootic in many countries and pose a serious challenge to the poultry industry and public health. 3 As of 2013, H5N6 HPAIVs have emerged and circulated in poultry, causing sporadic human infections in China. 4 Since 2014, H5N8 HPAIVs have been circulating in Asia, North America, and Europe. 5 Wild birds are considered a natural reservoir for AIVs and play an important role in viral transmission. 6 In this study, we have presented a brief characterization of three H5 HPAIVs with different NA subtypes (H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8) isolated from wild birds.\n\nDuring AIV surveillance in wild birds in 2015-2016, we isolated three strains of H5 HPAIVs, designated A/Anser cygnoides/Jiangxi/ P126/2015(H5N1) (P126/H5N1), A/Anser fabalis/Jiangxi/P560/2015 (H5N6) (P560/H5N6), and A/swan/Shanxi/ST/2016(H5N8) (ST/ H5N8), from Poyang Lake of Jiangxi Province and Shengtian Lake of Shanxi Province. To clarify their genetic characteristics, we sequenced all gene segments of the three viruses and compared them with influenza virus sequences in GenBank. The pathogenicities of the three isolates were additionally determined in chickens, ducks and mice.\n\nFor virus isolation, feces samples were resuspended in PBS solution with antibiotics and subsequently inoculated into specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs as described previously. 7 RNA was extracted using the Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full genomes of the viruses were sequenced and deposited in GenBank under accession nos. MK6160 6 6-MK616089.\n\nTo characterize the three isolates, we determined clade distribution based on the HA gene sequences. P126/H5N1, P560/H5N6, and ST/H5N8 isolates belonged to clade 2.3.4.4 ( Fig. 1 ) . Sequence analyses further showed high nucleotide identities of HA genes of the three H5 viruses with A/chicken/Tong Hai/ 302/2014(H5N1), A/oriental magpie robin/HK/6154/2015(H5N6), and A/chicken/Uganda/17RS115-15/2017(H5N8), which are currently circulating in Asia ( Fig. 1 ) .\n\nTo assess the risk of likelihood of transmission from avian to mammalian species, genotypic markers were evaluated based on their genome sequences. The receptor binding sites in the HA gene of three H5 HPAIVs contained Q226 and G228 (H3 numbering), suggesting binding preference for avian-like receptors. 8 The H5 viruses shared four to six amino acid changes within the receptor binding site (RBS) of HA, specifically, S133L (ST/H5N8), and S137A in the 130-loop, D187N, K193N , and Q196K in the 190-helix, and S227R (ST/H5N8) in the 220-loop (Table S1) . Remarkably, HA genes of the three H5 isolates lacked an N-linked glycosylation site at position 158, whose absence is considered to promote receptor binding affinity in guinea pig transmission. 9 Mutations within the RBS and loss of the glycosylation site at residue 158 suggested that these H5 isolates confer receptor preference changes.\n\nMutations related to pathogenicity in mammals, 10 such as E627K and D701N in PB2, were not detected in the three avian isolates. However, substitutions in internal genes were identified, including nine in PB2 (T63I, L89V, G309D, T339K, Q368R, H447Q, R477G, I495V, and A676T), eight in PB1 (A3V, L13P, R207K, K328N, S375N, H436Y, L473V, and M677T), two in PA (H266R and S/A515T), three in MP (V15I, N30D, and T215A), and six in NS (A/P42S, T/D92E, L98F, I101M, V149A, and N200S), that potentially enhanced polymerase activity and increased virulence in mammals. These mutations appeared to confer not only increased receptor binding properties but also greater virulence of H5 HPAIVs, thus posing an increased threat to public health.\n\nTo evaluate the pathogenicity of the three H5 isolates in chickens, groups of ten 6-week-old SPF chickens were intravenously inoculated with 0.1 mL (1/10 dilution) of the allantoic fluid of each virus and mortality observed over a 10-day period. The characteristics of P126/H5N1, P560/H5N6, and ST/H5N8 viruses, which were highly pathogenic in chickens, are presented in Table S2 .\n\nTo evaluate the pathogenicity of the H5 isolates in ducks, we inoculated groups of 10 3-week-old SPF ducks intranasally with 10 6 EID 50 of each virus and observed mortality over a 10-day period. The characteristics of P126/H5N1, P560/H5N6, and ST/H5N8 viruses are shown in Table S2 . Our data clearly indicated high pathogenicity of these viruses in ducks.\n\nTo determine the pathogenicity of the viruses in mammalian hosts, we inoculated BALB/c mice intranasally with 10 6 EID 50 of each virus in a total volume of 50 \u03bcL. Five inoculated mice were euthanized on day 5 post-inoculation (p.i.) for virus titration in the lungs, nasal turbinate, liver and brain. The remaining 10 mice were monitored daily for weight loss and mortality for a total of 2 weeks. After intranasal administration of P126/H5N1 and P560/H5N6, high virus titers were detected in lung, nasal turbinate and liver, but not brain, while the virus was identified in lung and nasal turbinate, but not liver or brain of the ST/H5N8 group. Mice showed signs of illness. Over the 14-day observation period, all mice in groups inoculated with P126/H5N1 and P560/H5N6 isolates died ( Fig. 2 ) . However, no mortality was observed in the ST/H5N8 group ( Fig. 2 ) , suggesting that P126/H5N1 and P560/H5N6, but not the ST/H5N8 strain, were highly pathogenic in mice.\n\nIn summary, we characterized three H5 HPAI viruses with different NA subtypes isolated from apparently healthy wild birds in 2015-2016. All three isolates were highly pathogenic in chickens and ducks while the H5N1 and H5N6 subtypes showed high pathogenicity in mice. Many species of wild birds have longdistance dispersal and migration capacity. This behavior increases the likelihood of HPAIV spread, which presents a serious threat to poultry and human health. \n\nThere are no potential conflicts of interest. The NA gene of F352 showed the highest similarity to A/duck/Zhejiang/727042/2014 (H6N2) between nucleotide positions 101 and 583 and 700 and 1301, except for 583 \u2212700, which was most similar to A/duck/Hunan/S2046/2011 (H4N2) and A/muscovy_duck/Vietnam/LBM201/2012 (H3N2). These findings indicated that the NA gene of F352 was mainly derived from the N2 segments of the major parent A/duck/Zhejiang/ 727042/2014 (H6N2), but underwent reassortment with A/duck/ Hunan/S2046/2011 (H4N2) and A/muscovy_duck/Vietnam/LBM201/ 2012 (H3N2) ( Fig. 2 D) .\n\nTo estimate the rates of nucleotide or codon substitutions, we gathered sequences of currently available H3N2 subtype AIVs from NCBI and GISAID from January 2015 to March 2018 and divided them into two groups (isolates of 2015-2016 and 2017-018) for analysis by the uncorrelated relax-clock Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method using BEAST v1.8.4. 8 BEAST analysis showed that the mean rates of HA and NA gene nucleotide substitutions during 2017-2018 were decreased when compared with 2015-2016 ( Table 1 ). In addition, the mutation rates of second nucleotide of each codon within the open reading frame (ORF) of the HA gene was 0.188 during 2015-2016, but the rates were 0.454 during 2017-2018, which confirmed that the mutation rates had doubled ( Table 1 ) . Interestingly, most of the H3N2 subtypes of AIVs belonged to the Eurasion lineage and contained six potential N-glycosylation sites, including positions 24 NST 26 , 38 NGT 40 , 2.393 2.507 * HPD: highest probability density. * Position: the three nucleotides of each codon. E: scientific notation. 54 NAT 56 , 181 NVT 183 , 301 NGS 303 , and 499 NGT 501 in the HA protein; however, mutation of amino acids at the position 24N \u2192 S resulted in 24 NST 26 N-glycosylation sites of some strains disappearing and a new 22 NDS 24 site appearing in the HA1 protein since 2010. Strikingly, the codon of amino acids at position 24 had a one nucleotide (AAC) difference from the nucleotide (AGC) that leads to the mutation of 24N \u2192 S. This might have been related to the mutation rates of second nucleotide of each codon doubling with time, thereby changing the N-glycosylation sites of F138 and F352, which indicated viral replication and adaptation of H3N2 subtypes AIVs might have evolved substantially in the hosts.\n\nIn conclusion, AIVs with the H3N2 subtype will be ignored because of their low pathogenic and isolation rates. Our findings revealed that the HA and NA gene of F138 and F352 reassortant with the H3N2, H3N3, H4N2, H6N2 subtypes AIVs and the mean rates of second nucleotide of each codon of the HA gene had doubled. However, although the mean rates of the HA and NA gene nucleotide substitutions decreased, the reassortant process might have been affected by the frequent changes in antigenicity of other prevalent AIV strains so that better conditions are needed for the reassortant process in H3N2 subtypes of AIVs to proceed. In addition, consistent with Gao' research, 9 the binding affinity for the \u03b1(2-3)-linked sialic acid receptor of H7N9 subtype AIVs in 2013 was decreased, mainly due to the lack of N-glycosylation sites at amino acid position 150 in the HA protein. The H3N2 influenza virus has a wide host range and new N-glycosylation sites of F138 and F352 have been found, indicating that the H3N2 subtype AIVs might have attempted to adapt to different hosts. Importantly, H5N1 and H7N9 subtype AIVs have adapted to mammals and now pose a public health concern to mammals and humans. Hence, ongoing surveillance of H3N2 subtypes of AIVs in birds is warranted.\n\nThe author declare no competing financial interests.\n\nWe read with great interest the recent publication by Xie et al., addressing the issue of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for diagnosis of severe pneumonia in China. 1 They suggested that NGS might lead to more rapid and accurate diagnosis with better clinical prognosis than conventional detection methods in severe pneumonia in ICU. NGS is a novel method to DNA/RNA sequencing. Due to its high-throughput capacity and fast turnover time, NGS technology has been widely applied to the field of medical microbiology in recent years. NGS has been reported in the application for pathogen detection from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue and intraoperative samples. [2] [3] [4] However, no studies have been reported from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients with immuno- suppression. Compared with the immunocompetent host, CAP can be potentially fatal and present significant challenges in immunocompromised host (ICH). In addition to common pathogens, some unusual organisms can cause severe infection in ICH. Besides, multiple concurrent infections are also common in ICH. 5 These characteristics pose a severe challenge to establish a specific diagnosis to guide therapy. A diagnostic tool should be pursued aggressively for favorable outcomes in this population. We recently explored the utility of NGS of bronchoalveolar lavage on the diagnosis of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Thirteen immunocompromised patients with a diagnosis of communty-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were recruited from critical care department of Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. The diagnosis of CAP is based on the presence of select clinical features (e.g., cough, fever, sputum production, and pleuritic chest pain) and is supported by imaging of the lung, usually by chest radiography. Immunosuppression, defined as chemotherapy or neutropenia < 10 0 0 \u03bcL during the past 28 days; treatment \u2265 20 mg corticosteroids daily for \u2265 14 days; human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunosuppressive therapy after organ or bone marrow transplantation; and active tuberculosis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed under local anesthesia with topical lidocaine for patients. BALF specimens using three aliquots of 20 mL of 0.9% saline were obtained. The first was discarded as recommended. The others were pooled and separated into two aliquots. One aliquot was sent to the microbiology lab for direct examination with Gram stain and culture. The other one was sent for DNA extraction and sequencing.\n\nStandard procedures (SP) of BALF microbiologic testing were performed in all patients, which included quantitative cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi. In addition, multiplex PCR for influenza A/B, parainfluenza 1/2/3/4, coronavirus OC43, coronavirus 229E/NL63, respiratory syncytial virus A/B, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, enterovirus and Human bocavirus was performed on BALF and nasopharyngeal. CMV, EBV, HSV-I, and HSV-II serology for IgG and IgM antibodies were measured.\n\nClinical characteristics including sex, age, APACHE II score at the time of diagnosis of CAP were demonstrated in Table 1 . All patients were considered to be immunocompromised due to corticosteroids therapy or other immunosuppressive drugs. 6 SP identified pathogens in 6 patients (6/13), four of which were bacteria, one fungi and one virus detected by clinical respiratory viral PCR panels ( Table 2 ) . It is worth noting that two samples positive for Acinetobacter baumannii by SP were considered co-infected Table 2 Next-generation sequencing of BALF for the patients with pneumonia.\n\nwith PJP or CMV respectively by NGS. NGS detected pathogens in 12 patients (12/13) and one sample with non-infectious etiologies was confirmed by NGS ( Table 2 ) . Importantly, five PJP infections and one Aspergillus fumigatus infection were recognized by NGS. Moreover, among the six fungi-positive samples, CMV was also identified in three of them (two PJP and one Aspergillus fumigatus ). Being relatively uncommon pathogens among the immunocompromised, PJP were identified in 5 cases and CMV in 4 cases by NGS. However, CMV serology for IgM were negative in these patients. No methenamine silver staining was performed in these cases, for the detecting item has not been carried out in our hospital. Overall, four bacteria, one fungus and one virus were detected by SP. By comparison, four bacteria, seven fungi and five viruses were identified by NGS ( Table 2 ).\n\nIn terms of bacteria detection, NGS showed no significant advantages in this study. It is noteworthy that our study demonstrated NGS has a distinct advantage in the field of fungi and viral testing, especially PJP and CMV detection.\n\nThe definitive PJP diagnosis usually requires demonstration of fungus in tissue, BALF, or induced sputum samples. Methenamine silver staining and PCR in BALF samples have good sensitivity and specificity and is an emerging modality for diagnosis in the correct clinical setting. 7, 8 There are a few laboratory tests to detect CMV infection. 7 Histopathologic analysis or viral culture from tissue, blood, urine, or respiratory specimens is less utilized because of poor sensitivity and longer time-consuming. CMV serology for IgG and IgM antibodies is another diagnostic tool but may be negative and inconclusive in immunocompromised hosts. The other methods such as PCR and pp65 antigenemia assays have not been carried out widely. 7 , 9 NGS technology showed its remarkable advantages in terms of opportunistic pathogens in patients with immunocompromised states.\n\nIn recent years, clinicians have been increasingly aware of the problem of mixed infection in immunocompromised hosts. 10 However, to diagnosis the co-occurrence of two commonly seen opportunistic infections is difficult in immunocompromised patients with lung infiltrates. It is worth noting the distinct advantage of NGS in concurrent detection of bacteria, fungi and viruses. In our study, standard procedures performed poorly in detecting mixed infections, whereas five cases with coinfection of bacteria, fungi or viruses were identified by NGS. This advantage may help clinicians more comprehensive evaluation of patients and make effective treatment.\n\nIn conclusion, our study explored the application of NGS in the microbiologic diagnosis in CAP patients with immunosuppression. NGS technology showed its remarkable advantages in detecting opportunistic pathogens and mixed infection in those patients.\n\nThe study protocol was approved by the Ruijin Hospital Ethics Committee, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, China. Formal consent was obtained from the patient or the next of kin.\n\nThis study was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China ( 2017YFC1309700 , 2017YFC1309705 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 81772040 , 81770 0 05 , 81801885 ) and Shanghai Sailing Program ( 18YF1413800 ).\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest."}
