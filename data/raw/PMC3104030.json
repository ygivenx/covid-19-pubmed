{"title": "A New Approach to Monitoring Dengue Activity", "body": "Among the world's most vexing emerging infectious diseases, dengue continues to\nspread, and in its many endemic areas is a major public health problem [1]\u2013[3]. There is no\nvaccine available, and the immunology of dengue, whereby immunological\n\u201cpriming\u201d can result in extremely severe manifestations (e.g., dengue\nhemorrhagic fever) complicates vaccine development [4]. Thus dengue control is\ndependent on controlling the mosquito vector, and resistance to insecticides,\nenvironmental and social disruption, climate change, and global movement of goods\nand people (and incidentally, vectors) provide ongoing hurdles to effective vector\ncontrol [5],\n[6].\n\nAccurate risk analysis and allocation of resources for dengue control depends on\ndisease surveillance. Dengue surveillance is similarly complex and depends in most\nareas on formal surveillance systems that capture case counts (or via syndromic\nsurveillance at sentinel sites) [7], [8]. Laboratory reporting of\nserology can confirm not only individual cases but identify the viral serotypes\nfound in a given area at a point in time [9]. Analysis of mosquito\npopulations can also confirm dengue circulation and provide information on viral\ntypes [10]\u2013[12]. Formal surveillance has many advantages: precise counts\nof case numbers, good geographic localization and the potential to identify precise\ndisease etiology among them.\n\nHowever, formal infectious disease surveillance systems have important limitations,\nincluding lags between case occurrence and reporting. Sentinel sites may report\ncases only periodically or fail to report altogether for a variety of reasons.\nDelays in reporting may occur when governmental organizations charged with\nsurveillance aren't able to adequately collect and analyze data or publish\nreports in a timely manner. These problems may be particularly daunting in\ndeveloping countries with limited resources to devote to strengthening surveillance\nsystems: robust formal public health surveillance is expensive, requiring major\ninvestments in trained personnel, communications, buildings and equipment. Indeed,\nthe economic conditions that prevent development of robust surveillance systems may\nalso be those that potentiate dengue transmission: for example, a seroprevalence\nstudy performed in a city straddling the Texas-Mexico border found marked\ndifferences in dengue seroprevalence on the Mexican side of the border in\nassociation with economic disadvantage [13].\n\nThe hierarchical nature of formal public health surveillance also poses challenges to\nsurveillance. Hierarchical reporting structures can lose data at any point of\ninteraction, for example when a regional authority fails to report to a national\none. Finally, in some situations there can be short-term disincentives for the\ntimely and transparent reporting of disease activity: governments may fear that\nsurges in disease activity may chase away tourists or visitors, or may undermine\ngovernment credibility [14].\n\nTo address these drawbacks, a complementary system of informal surveillance tools\nhave been developed, some by governmental agencies, but many by non-governmental\norganizations and/or researchers. Event-based surveillance systems such as ProMED,\nGPHIN HealthMap and BioCaster rely on unofficial reports of disease, for example\nfrom clinicians or web-based healt-related news media, to report on disease\noutbreaks [15]\u2013[17]. Such systems have proven\nreliable and timely and informal sources of information were even recognized in the\n2005 revision of the International Health Regulations as important sources of\nepidemic intelligence [18], [19]. The rapid and accelerating growth of the Internet has\nimproved the usefulness and sensitivity of these systems and they have likely\nimproved the timeliness of outbreak reporting [18], and the ever-expanding\navailability of electronic information has also led to the discovery of other types\nof analyses that detect disease outbreaks. \u201cWeb-crawlers\u201d (software\nprograms that search internet sites for specific terms, and then use these search\nterms to generate reports or maps of disease activity) can provide important\ninformation on disease outbreaks that may be published on nongovernmental websites,\nin online newspapers, and in blogs, and this approach powers the widely-used\nHealthMap system mentioned above [20]. In the context of the recent cholera outbreak in Haiti,\nthere were inconsistencies in initial accounts of regional disease activity, but\ninformation from HealthMap proved useful in the construction of a mathematical model\nthat predicted disease spread on the island [21].\n\nThe analysis of real time search queries\u2014the so-called\n\u201csearchstream\u201d\u2013 has been shown to be a sensitive and timely means\nof evaluating geographically-specific trends in influenza; both Yahoo and Google\nsearch engines have proven to be powerful tools for influenza surveillance [22], [23]. More\nrecently, evaluation of data from the microblogging website Twitter has been shown\nto provide useful information about both disease activity and\ndisease concern related to the 2009 influenza pandemic [15]. Finally, the widespread\navailability of smartphone technologies makes it possible to interact with\npopulation members to elicit information on illness (so-called\n\u201ccrowdsourcing\u201d), and also (by using cellphone or smartphone network\ndata) to evaluate the movement of populations, which may be a key predictor of how\nepidemics spread [24]\u2013[26].\n\nReaders unfamiliar with these approaches may wish to try a simple experiment using\nthe Google Insights for Search tool, which provides a graphical depiction of both\nsearch term volumes and online media reports of disease (http://www.google.com/insights/search/#). Searches on terms such as\n\u201cnorovirus\u201d or \u201cpneumonia\u201d produce seasonally oscillating\npatterns of searches as one might anticipate in diseases with strong wintertime\nseasonality (Figure 1), and\nwhich is presumably generated by individuals who have, or know someone who has, this\ndiagnosis seeking to learn more about it online. However, the pitfalls of this\napproach can be appreciated in a similar manner: a search on the term\n\u201cinfluenza\u201d produces a graph with a tremendous spike in 2009 (Figure 2); indeed a spike so large\nthat it obscures influenza activity in all other years. This reflects the\ndifficulties that searchstream-based surveillance methods may encounter when\nevaluating diseases that generate extreme public concern or media attention.\n\nChan et al., in this edition of PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases\n[27], apply\nsearchstream surveillance techniques to the monitoring of dengue. In this case,\nsearch queries appear to closely track (rather than lead) dengue activity as\nmeasured by traditional systems. The authors have limited their model to certain\nlocations defined in part by the extent of Internet use in these areas (Bolivia,\nBrazil, India, Indonesia and Singapore). Their findings are exciting: when evaluated\nin a \u201ctesting set\u201d of data not used to derive initial models, they found\nextremely strong correlation between dengue-related query volumes and case counts\nreported by traditional surveillance systems, but their approach has the advantage\nof both timeliness and transparency (including the availability of the system on the\nGoogle.org website).\n\nAs with any prediction-oriented surveillance tool, a major concern relates to model\n\u201cover-fitting\u201d such that the prediction model performs well in the\ndataset that was used in its creation but fails to work well in the \u201creal\nworld\u201d. Reassuringly the authors divided their data into a derivation set and\na testing set (or \u201choldout set\u201d as they call it), with the former used\nfor model construction. As can be seen in the table and figure they present, their\nderived models perform extremely well in both sets in all countries, in the\nderivation set as expected, but also in the testing set. Perhaps less\nstraightforward is the authors' decision to \u201csmooth out\u201d unusual\nspikes in search volumes in candidate queries; as demonstrated by the influenza\nexample above, extreme surges in public interest in a disease can cause surges in\nquery volumes, as can surges in interest related particular subject that is\nunrelated to the disease under surveillance but shares attributes that would be the\nsubject of searches. By smoothing search volumes, the authors may have incorporated\ninto their models terms that have the potential to \u201cmisbehave\u201d in the\nfuture. For example, one imagines that if a novel (and frightening) new hemorrhagic\nfever unrelated to dengue emerges in one of these countries in coming years, one\nwould imagine that the correlation between the search term \u201chaemorrhagic\nfever\u201d and dengue volumes would decline. As we don't have access to the\nprecise query terms that were included in each country-specific model, it is\ndifficult to know whether or not the terms included in the model would be vulnerable\nto such effects. The authors note that the expanding range of a clinically similar\nillness (Chikungunya) may confound the utility as well [28].\n\nIt would also be helpful to see to what extent there is overlap in components of\nmodels across countries, as this may help us understand whether these models can be\napplied to other jurisdictions or whether they are applicable only in the country\nfor which they were constructed. As dengue is a disease whose range may change under\nthe influence of climate change, it is important to know whether such an approach is\napplicable in the face of novel emergence of dengue in a new region or jurisdiction,\nor whether it is only applicable in countries like these in which dengue is\ncurrently endemic.\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge for the use of the approach described here is the same\nthat applies across surveillance modalities: the same geographic locations that lack\npublic health resources to control dengue, and to perform traditional surveillance,\nare likely to lag in access to the Internet as well. Nonetheless, the application of\nweb-query based monitoring to a major and growing health threat in the developing\nworld represents an important step forward. The ability to inexpensively and\nreliably maintain situational awareness of dengue activity will be welcomed by those\ncharged with the public health response.\n\nDoes the development of web-based surveillance tools represent a revolution in how we\nconceptualize surveillance? We think not: current high-quality public health\nsurveillance already utilizes multiple sources of information to gain a more\ncomplete picture of the incidence and distribution of disease. For example,\ninfluenza surveillance may include laboratory-based virological surveillance,\nsentinel syndromic surveillance (e.g., school-based absenteeism reports) and\nevaluation of mortality trends for pneumonia and influenza, which taken together may\nprovide a more complete picture of disease risk and impacts. Searchterm-based\nsurveillance and other modalities mentioned above thus provide an additional tool in\nthe surveillance toolbox, which has advantages over traditional surveillance as well\nas limitations. It should be noted, however, that limitations such as those\ndescribed above are not absent from traditional surveillance systems either:\nestimates of incidence can change markedly with changing case definitions, incidence\nof laboratory-confirmed disease can change markedly with augmentation or restriction\nof clinical testing or changes in diagnostic test methodologies, and syndromic\nsurveillance systems can be subject to poor specificity and frequent false alarms.\nThus supplementary information derived using methods such as the one developed by\nChan and colleagues should be welcomed by public health professionals. The\ntransparency of such systems may also help demonstrate the value of openness in\ndisease reporting, which may have \u201cspillover effects\u201d on traditional\nsurveilance systems."}
