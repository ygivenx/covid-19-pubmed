{"title": "Isolation and characterization of a bat SARS-like coronavirus that uses the ACE2 receptor", "body": "Bats were trapped in their natural habitat as described previously5. Throat and fecal swab samples were collected in viral transport medium (VTM) composed of Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution at pH7.4 containing BSA (1%), amphotericin (15 \u03bcg/ml), penicillin G (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/ml). To collect fresh fecal samples, clean plastic sheets measuring 2.0 by 2.0 m were placed under known bat roosting sites at about 18:00 hours each evening. Relatively fresh fecal samples were collected from sheets at approximately 5:30 to 6:00 the next morning and placed in VTM. Samples were transported to the laboratory and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. All animals trapped for this study were released back to their habitat after sample collection. All sampling processes were performed by veterinarians with approval from Animal Ethics Committee of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and EcoHealth Alliance under an inter-institutional agreement with UC Davis.\n\nRNA was extracted from 140 \u03bcl of swab or fecal samples with Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA was eluted in 60 \u03bcl AVE buffer, then aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. One-step RT-PCR (Invitrogen) was used to detect coronavirus sequences as described previously15. First round PCR was conducted in a 25-\u03bcl reaction mix containing 12.5 \u03bcl PCR 2 x reaction mix Buffer, 10 pmol of each primer, 2.5 mM MgSO4, RNase Inhibitor 20 U, 1 \u03bcl SuperScript III/Platinum Taq Enzyme Mix, and 5 \u03bcl RNA. Amplification of the RdRp-gene fragment was performed as follows: 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles consisting of 94\u00b0C for 15 sec, 62\u00b0C for 15 sec, 68\u00b0C for 40 sec, and a final extension of 68\u00b0C for 5 min. Second round PCR was conducted in a 25-\u03bcl reaction mix containing 2.5 \u03bcl PCR reaction buffer, 5 pmol of each primer, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dNTP, 0.1 \u03bcl Platinum Taq Enzyme (Invitrogen), and 1 \u03bcl first round PCR product. The amplification of RdRp-gene fragment was performed as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles consisting of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 52\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 40 sec, and a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 5 min.\n\nTo amplify the RBD region, one-step RT-PCR was performed with primers designed based on available SARS-CoV or bat SL-CoVs (first round PCR primers:\n\nCoVS1805R-5\u2032-ACATCYTGATANARAACAGC-3\u2032). First round PCR was conducted in a 25-\u03bcl reaction mix as described above except primers specific for the S gene were used. The amplification of the RBD region of the S gene was performed as follows: 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of 94\u00b0C for 15 sec, 43\u00b0C for 15 sec, 68\u00b0C for 90 sec, and a final extension of 68\u00b0C for 5 min. Second round PCR was conducted in a 25-\u03bcl reaction mix containing 2.5 \u03bcl PCR reaction Buffer, 5 pmol of each primer, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dNTP, 0.1 \u03bcl Platinum Taq Enzyme (Invitrogen), and 1 \u03bcl first round PCR product. Amplification was performed as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles consisting of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 41\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 60 sec, and a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 5 min.\n\nPCR products were gel purified and cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega). At least four independent clones were sequenced to obtain a consensus sequence for each of the amplified regions.\n\nDegenerate coronavirus primers were designed based on all available SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV sequences in GenBank and specific primers were designed from genome sequences generated from previous rounds of sequencing in this study (primer sequences will be provided upon request). All PCRs were conducted using One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 genomic ends were determined using 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 RACE kit (Roche), respectively. PCR products were gel purified and sequenced directly or following cloning into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega). At least four independent clones were sequenced to obtain a consensus sequence for each of the amplified regions and each region was sequenced at least twice.\n\nRoutine sequence management and analysis was carried out using DNAStar or Geneious. Sequence alignment and edit was conducted using ClustalW, BioEdit or GeneDoc. Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic trees based on the protein sequences were constructed using a Poisson model with bootstrap values determined by 1,000 replicates in the MEGA5 software package.\n\nSequences obtained in this study have been deposited in GenBank as follows (accession numbers given in parenthesis): full-length genome sequence of SL-CoV RsSHC014 and Rs3367 (KC881005, KC881006); full-length sequence of WIV1 S (KC881007); RBD (KC880984-KC881003); ACE2(KC8810040). SARS-CoV sequences used in this study: human SARS-CoV strains Tor2 (AY274119), BJ01 (AY278488), GZ02 (AY390556), and civet SARS-CoV strain SZ3 (AY304486). Bat coronavirus sequences used in this study: Rs672 (FJ588686), Rp3 (DQ071615), Rf1 (DQ412042), Rm1 (DQ412043), HKU3-1 (DQ022305), BM48-31 (NC_014470), HKU9-1 (NC_009021), HKU4 (NC_009019), HKU5 (NC_009020), HKU8 (DQ249228), HKU2 (EF203067), BtCoV512 (NC_009657), 1A (NC_010437).

Bat ACE2 was amplified from a Rhinolophus sinicus (sample no. 3357). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from bat rectal tissue using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA by reverse transcription with random hexamers. Full-length bat ACE2 fragments were amplified using forward primer bAF2 and reverse primer bAR229. The ACE2 gene was cloned into pCDNA3.1 with KpnI and XhoI, and verified by sequencing. Purified ACE2 plasmids were transfected to HeLa cells. After 24 h, lysates of HeLa cells expressing human, civet, or bat ACE2 were confirmed by western-blot or immunofluorescence assay (IFA).\n\nLysates of cells or filtered supernatants containing pseudoviruses were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). For detection of S protein, the membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-Rp3 S fragment aa 561\u2013666 polyantibodies (1:200), and the bound antibodies were detected by AP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000). For detection of HIV-1 p24 in supernatants, monoclonal antibody against HIV p24 (p24 MAb) was used as the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000, followed by incubation with AP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at the same dilution. To detect the expression of ACE2 in HeLa cells, goat antibody against the huACE2 ectodomain (1:500) was used as the first antibody, followed by incubation with HRP- conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:1000).\n\nVero E6 cell monolayers were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). PCR-positive samples (in 200 \u03bcl buffer) were gradient centrifuged at 3,000\u201312,000 rpm, and supernatant were diluted 1:10 in DMEM medium before being added to Vero E6 cells. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, inocula were removed and replaced with fresh DMEM medium with 2% FCS. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 days and checked daily for cytopathetic effect (CPE). Double dose triple antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin (Gibco) were included in all tissue culture media (penicillin 200 IU/ml, streptomycin 0.2 mg/ml, amphotericin 0.5 \u03bcg/ml). Three blind passages were carried out for each sample. After each passage, both the culture supernatant and cell pellet were examined for presence of virus by RT-PCR using primers targeting the RdRp or S gene. Virions in supernatant (10 ml) were collected and inactivated using 0.1% formaldehyde for 4 h, then concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion (5 ml) at 80,000g for 90 min using a Ty90 rotor (Beckman). The pelleted viral particles were dissolved in 100 \u03bcl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), stained with 2% phosphtungstic acid (pH 7.0) and examined using a Tecnai transmission electron microscope (FEI) at 200 kV.\n\nCell lines used for this study and their culture conditions are summarized in Extended Data Table 5. Virus titer was determined in Vero E6 cells by CPE counts. Cell lines from different origins and HeLa cells expressing ACE2s from human (hACE2), civet (cACE2) or Chinese horseshoe bat (bACE2) were grown on coverslips in 24-well plates (Corning) incubated with bat SL-CoV-WIV1 at MOI=10 for 1 h. The inoculum was removed and washed twice with PBS and supplemented with medium. HeLa cells without ACE2 expression and Vero E6 cells were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. At 24 h post-infection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. ACE2 expression was detected using goat anti-hACE2 immunoglobulin (Ig) (R&D Systems) followed by FITC-labeled donkey anti-goat Ig from PTGLab (Chicago, IL). Virus replication was detected using rabbit antibody against the SL-CoV Rp3 nucleocapsid protein followed by cyanin 3-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG. Nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Staining patterns were examined using a FV1200 confocal microscope (Olympus).\n\nVero E6, A549, PK15, RSKT, HeLa cells with or without expressing ACE2s of different origins were inoculated with 0.1 TCID50 WIV-1 and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After removing the inoculum, the cells were cultured with medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Supernatants were collected at 0, 12, 24 and 48 h. RNA from 140 \u03bcl of each supernatant was extracted with the Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions and eluted in 60 \u03bcl AVE buffer. RNA was quantified on the ABI StepOne\u2122 system, with the TaqMan AgPath-ID\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems) in a 25 \u03bcl reaction mix containing 4 \u03bcl RNA, 1 x RT-PCR enzyme mix, 1 x RT-PCR buffer, 40 pmol forward primer (5\u2032-GTGGTGGTGACGGCAAAATG-3\u2032), 40 pmol reverse primer (5\u2032-AAGTGAAGCTTCTGGGCCAG-3\u2032) and 12 pmol probe (5\u2032-FAM-AAAGAGCTCAGCCCCAGATG-BHQ1-3\u2032). Amplification parameters were 10 min at 50 \u00b0C, 10 min at 95 \u00b0C and 50 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 20 s at 60\u00b0C. RNA dilutions from purified WIV-1 stock were used as a standard.\n\nSARS patient sera were inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and then used for virus neutralization testing. Sera were diluted starting with 1:10 and then serially 2-fold diluted in 96-well cell plates to 1:40. Each 100 \u03bcl serum dilution was mixed with 100 \u03bcl viral supernatant containing 100 TCID50 of WIV1 and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The mixture was added in triplicate wells of 96-well cell plates with plated monolayers of Vero E6 cells and further incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 days. Serum from a healthy blood donor was used as a negative control in each experiment. CPE was observed using an inverted microscope at 2 days post-inoculation. The neutralizing antibody titer was read as the highest dilution of serum which completely suppressed CPE in infected wells. The neutralization test was repeated twice.\n\nFull-length genomic sequences of SL-CoV Rs3367 or SHC014 were aligned with those of selected SARS-CoVs and bat SL-CoVs using Clustal X. The aligned sequences were preliminarily scanned for recombination events using Recombination Detection Program (RDP) 4.019. The potential recombination events suggested by RDP due to their strong P-values (<10\u201320) were further investigated by similarity plot and bootscan analyses implemented in Simplot 3.5.1. Phylogenetic origin of the major and minor parental regions of the 3367 or SHC014 were constructed from the concatenated sequences of the essential ORFs of the major and minor parental regions of selected SARS-CoV and SL-CoVs. Two genome regions between three estimated breakpoints (20,827\u201326,553, and 26,554\u201328,685) were aligned independently using ClustalX and generated two alignments of 5,727 bp and 2,133 bp. The two alignments were used to construct maximum likehood trees to better infer the fragment parents. All nucleotide numberings in this study are based on 3367 genome position."}
