{"title": "Novel NSAID 1-acyl-4-cycloalkyl/arylsemicarbazides and 1-acyl-5-benzyloxy/ hydroxy carbamoylcarbazides as potential anticancer agents and antioxidants", "body": "The novel 1-acyl-4-cycloalkyl/arylsemicarbazides (5aey) and 1-acyl-5-benzyloxy/hydroxy carbamoylcarbazides (8aef) derived from the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen, fenoprofen and reduced ketoprofen were prepared, fully chemically characterized and evaluated for their cytostatic, antiviral and antioxidant activities. Compounds 5 and 8 consist of a region rich in electronegative atoms (five to nine nitrogen and oxygen atoms) framed by aryl or cycloalkyl residues on one or both terminal ends. The synthetic pathways applied for the preparation of the title compounds involved a benzotriazole as a synthetic auxiliary in several steps. Three of the tested compounds, namely 4benzhydryl-1- [2-(3-phenoxyphenyl) propanoyl]semicarbazide (5l), 4-benzhydryl-1- [2-(3-benzylphenyl) propanoyl]semicarbazide (5s), and 4-benzhydryl-1- [2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propanoyl]semicarbazide (5f) showed pronounced antiproliferative activity in vitro against six cancer cell lines (IC 50 \u00bc 3e23 mM). The same compounds highly inhibited soybean lipoxygenase (IC 50 \u00bc 60 and 51.5 mM) and lipid peroxidation as well (99, 88 and 74%, respectively). 4-Benzyloxy-1- [2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propanoyl]semicarbazide (5t) and 5-benzyloxycarbamoyl-1- [2-(3-benzylphenyl) propanoyl]carbazide (8c) exerted complete lipid peroxidation inhibition. Semicarbazides 5wey and carbazides 8def bearing a hydroxamic acid/hydroxyurea moiety showed a modest antiradical activity in DPPH test, while the best radical scavenger was 1-(1benzotriazolecarbonyl)-4-benzyloxysemicarbazide (7) . None of the compounds were inhibitory to a broad panel of DNA and RNA viruses in the cell culture at subtoxic concentrations.\n\n\u00d3 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Inflammation is often accompanied by the excessive formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are potentially damaging to DNA and cell membranes. In addition, the expression of COX-2 in inflammatory and neoplastic cells has an impact on various carcinogenic pathways [1e4] . NSAIDs usefulness in chemoprevention is well-documented. Numerous experimental, epidemiological, and clinical studies have found that long-term use of NSAIDs is associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, and some other types of cancer [5e8] . NSAID chemical modifications were undertaken with the aim of improving the NSAIDs safety profile (increasing the analgetic/anti-inflammatory activity and COX1/COX2 selectivity, reducing the ulcerogenic effect or obtaining dual COX/LOX inhibition) [9, 10] . Many efforts were made to get NSAID derivatives with pronounced cytostatic activity as well [11e19] . Thus, we set to prepare a series of new NSAID derivatives rich in nitrogen/oxygen atoms, related to semicarbazides, carbazides, ureas, hydroxyureas and hydroxamic acids, bearing pharmacophores present in numerous antitumor agents [20e23] . Their synthesis, full chemical characterization, and evaluation of their cytostatic, antiviral and antioxidative potential are reported in this paper.\n\nMelting points were determined on a Stuart Melting Point Apparatus SMP3 and were uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded on a FTIR PerkineElmer Paragon 500 spectrometer. UVevisible double beam spectrophotometer Lambda 20 (PerkineElmer) was used for the in vitro tests. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-600 spectrometer, operating at 600. 13 and 300.13 MHz for the 1 H and 150.917 and 75. 47 MHz for 13 C nuclei. Samples were measured in DMSO-d 6 solutions at 20 C in 5 mm NMR tubes. Chemical shifts (d) in ppm were referred to TMS. CHN analyses were performed on CHNS LECO analyzer and were within AE0.4%. Solvent systems dichloromethane/methanol (9:1 and 9.5:0.5), cyclohexane/ethyl acetate (1:1), petroleum ether/ ethyl acetate/methanol (3:1:0.5 and 1:2:0.1) and precoated silica gel 60 F 254 plates were used for thin-layer chromatography. Spots were visualized by short-wave UV light, iodine vapor, phosphomolybdic acid or ferric chloride solution. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (0.063e0.200 mm), with cyclohexane/ ethyl acetate/methanol (3:1:0.6) or dichloromethane/methanol (9.5:0.5 or 8.5:1.5) as eluents.\n\n2-(3-Benzylphenyl)propanoic acid was prepared by ketoprofen reduction. 1-Benzotriazole carboxylic acid chloride (BtcCl, 1) and NSAID (ibuprofen, fenoprofen, and reduced ketoprofen) benzotriazolides (2aec) were synthesized according to our previously published procedures [24e26] . For preparation of 1-(N-alkyl/ arylcarbamoyl)benzotriazoles (1-benzotriazole carboxylic acid amides) 4aeg our synthetic method was applied as well [27] . The following derivatives were prepared: 1-(N-cyclopentylcarbamoyl) benzotriazole (4a), 1-(N-cyclohexylcarbamoyl)benzotriazole (4b), 1-(N-cyclohexanemethylcarbamoyl)benzotriazole (4c), 1-(N-benzylcarbamoyl)benzotriazole (4d), 1-[N-(2-phenylethylcarbamoyl)] benzotriazole (4e), 1-(N-benzhydrylcarbamoyl)benzotriazole (4f) and 1-(N-benzyloxycarbamoyl)benzotriazole (4g). Benzotriazole (BtH), triphosgene, O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride, cyclopentylamine, cyclohexylamine, cyclohexanemethylamine, benzylamine, 2-phenylethanamine, benzhydrylamine, hydrazine hydrate, triethylamine (TEA) and 10% Pd/C were purchased from Aldrich. Ibuprofen, fenoprofen and ketoprofen were gift samples from Pliva, University of Potchefstroom and Belupo. DPPH, AAPH and NDGA were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Soybean LOX and linoleic acid sodium salt were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. All solvents were of analytical grade purity and dry.\n\nTo a solution of hydrazine hydrate (2.43 ml, 50 mmol) in dioxane (10 ml), a solution of NSAID benzotriazolides 2aec (10 mmol) in dioxane (30 ml) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 1 h and evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (30 ml Method A: A melted mixture of NSAID hydrazide 3aec (1 mmol), 4aef (1 mmol) and TEA (0.418 ml, 3 mmol) was stirred at 75e120 C for 15 min. The residue was cooled to room temperature, dissolved in ethyl acetate (20 ml) and extracted with 0.1% sodium hydroxide solution (20 ml \u00c2 3). The organic layer was washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure. Method B: A melted mixture of NSAID hydrazide 3aec (1 mmol), 4aef (1 mmol) and TEA (0.418 ml, 3 mmol) was stirred at 75e120 C for 15 min. The residue was cooled to room temperature, stirred with acetone/HCl 1:2 solution (30 ml, pH \u00bc 1) and the precipitated product B was filtered off. Method C: A solution of NSAID hydrazide 3aec (1 mmol) and (0.268 g, 1 mmol) 1-(N-benzyloxycarbamoyl)benzotriazole (4g) in dioxane (10 ml) was stirred at 55 C for 6e8 h. Dioxane was evaporated under reduced pressure, the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (20 ml) and extracted with 0.1% sodium hydroxide solution (20 ml \u00c2 3). The organic layer was washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure. Method D: A solution of 1-acyl-4-benzyloxy semicarbazide 5tev (0.5 mmol) in methanol (10 ml) was hydrogenated for 1.5 h in the presence of Pd/C (50 mg). The catalyst was filtered off and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. (6) . A solution of 1-(N-benzyloxycarbamoyl)benzotriazole (4g) (2.683 g, 10 mmol) in 30 ml dioxane was added dropwise to a solution of 0.534 ml (11 mmol) hydrazine hydrate in 10 ml dioxane. The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 1 h and evaporated under reduced pressure. The analytically pure sample was obtained after column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol 9.5:0.5) and triturated with \n\nThe cytostatic activity of the test compounds against murine leukemia L1210 and human lymphocyte CEM and cervix carcinoma HeLa cells was determined as follows: L1210, CEM and HeLa cells were suspended at 300,000e500,000 cells/ml of culture medium, and 100 ml of a cell suspension was added to 100 ml of an appropriate dilution of the test compounds in 200 ml-wells of 96-well microtiter plates. After incubation at 37 C for two (L1210) or three (CEM, HeLa) days, the cell number was determined using a Coulter counter [29] . Whereas L1210 and CEM cells could be counted directly in the Coulter counter, HeLa cells were detached from the microtiter plate wells by trypsin treatment prior to counting. The IC 50 was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%.\n\nThe cytostatic activity of the test compounds against HCT 116 (colon carcinoma), H 460 (lung carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast carcinoma) and HaCaT (human immortalized keratinocytes) was determined as follows: the cells were cultured as monolayers and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 at 37 C. The growth inhibition activity was assessed as described previously [30, 31] . The panel cell lines were inoculated onto a series of standard 96-well microtiter plates on day 0, at 1 \u00c210 4 to 3 \u00c2 10 4 cells/ml, depending on the doubling times of a specific cell line. Test agents were then added in ten-fold dilutions (10 \u00c08 e10 \u00c04 M) and incubated for further 72 h. Working dilutions were freshly prepared on the day of testing. After 72 h of incubation the cell growth rate was evaluated by performing the MTT assay, which detects dehydrogenize activity in viable cells. The absorbance (A) was measured on a microplate reader at 570 nm. The absorbance is directly proportional to the number of living, metabolically active cells. The percentage of growth (PG) of the cell lines was calculated according to one or the other of the following two expressions: If\u00f0mean A test \u00c0 mean A tzero \u00de ! 0; then PG \u00bc 100 \u00c2 \u00f0mean A test \u00c0 mean A tzero \u00de=\u00f0mean A ctrl \u00c0 mean A tzero \u00de:\n\nwhere the mean A tzero is the average of optical density measurements before exposure of cells to the test compound, the mean A test is the average of optical density measurements after the desired period of time and the mean A ctrl is the average of optical density measurements after the desired period of time with no exposure of cells to the test compound. The results are expressed as IC 50 , which is the concentration necessary for 50% of inhibition. The IC 50 values for each compound are calculated from concentrationeresponse curves using linear regression analysis by fitting the test concentrations that give PG values above and below the reference value (i.e. 50%). If however, all of the tested concentrations produce PGs exceeding the respective reference level of effect (e.g. PG value of 50), then the highest tested concentration is assigned as the default value, which is preceded by a \">\" sign. Each test was performed in quadruplicate in at least two individual experiments.\n\nThe antiviral assays, other than the anti-HIV assays, were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect in human lung fibroblast \n\nTo an ethanolic solution of DPPH (0.05 mM) in absolute ethanol an equal volume of the compounds (final concentration 100 mM) dissolved in DMSO was added. The mixture was shaken vigorously and allowed to stand for 20 or 60 min. Absorbance at 517 nm was determined spectrophotometrically, and the percentage of activity was calculated. All tests were undertaken on three replicates, and the results were averaged ( Table 2 ).\n\nThe water-soluble azo compound AAPH is used as a free radical initiator for in vitro studies of free radical production. Production of conjugated diene hydroperoxide by oxidation of linoleic acid sodium salt in an aqueous solution is monitored at 234 nm. This assay can be used to follow oxidative changes and to understand the contribution of each tested compound. An amount of 10 mL of the 16 mM linoleic acid sodium salt solution was added to the UV cuvette containing 0.93 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, prethermostated at 37 C. The oxidation reaction was initiated at 37 C under air by the addition of 50 mL of 40 mM AAPH solution. Oxidation was carried out in the presence of aliquots (10 mL) in the assay without antioxidant, and lipid oxidation was measured in the presence of the same level of DMSO. The rate of oxidation at 37 C was monitored by recording the increase in absorption at 234 nm caused by conjugated diene hydroperoxides. Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate, and the standard deviation of absorbance was less than 10% of the mean.\n\nThe tested compounds dissolved in DMSO were incubated at room temperature with sodium linoleate (0.1 ml) and 0.2 ml of the enzyme solution (1 part of enzyme/9 parts of saline \u00c2 10 \u00c04 , w/v in saline). The conversion of sodium linoleate to 13hydroperoxylinoleic acid at 234 nm was recorded and compared with the appropriate standard inhibitor. Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate, and the standard deviation of absorbance was less than 10% of the mean.\n\nTwo series of nitrogen/oxygen-rich derivatives of the NSAIDs ibuprofen, fenoprofen and reduced ketoprofen 5 and 8 were Table 1 Inhibitory effects of 1-acyl-4-cycloalkyl(or 4-aryl)semicarbazides 5aey, 1-acyl-5-benzyloxy(or 5-hydroxy)carbamoylcarbazides 8aef and intermediate compounds 3aec, 6 and 7 on the proliferation of malignant tumor cell lines.\n\nStructural formula Tumor cell growth IC 50 prepared. They contain a region with five to nine electronegative atoms (three nitrogen plus two or three oxygen atoms or five nitrogen plus four oxygen atoms) framed by aryl, cycloalkyl or hydroxy residue on one or both terminal ends. Therefore, they are closely related to semicarbazides, carbazides, ureas, hydroxyureas and hydroxamic acids. The first series involved semicarbazides bearing a NSAID acyl residue at position 1 and cycloalkyl or aryl (5aes), benzyloxy (5tev) or hydroxy (5wey) substituents at position 4 of the semicarbazide backbone. Compounds 5aev were prepared from NSAID hydrazides 3aec and the corresponding 1-(N-alkyl/arylcarbamoyl)benzotriazoles (1-benzotriazole carboxylic acid amides) 4aeg (Scheme 1). Hydrazide 3a was previously described, while 3b and 3c are new compounds. Here we report a new method for efficient hydrazide preparation from NSAID benzotriazolides 2aec and hydrazine hydrate. 1-(N-Alkyl/arylcarbamoyl)benzotriazoles 4aeg were synthesized from 1-benzotriazole carboxylic acid chloride (BtcCl, 1) and corresponding amine, following our previously published procedure [27] . Benzyloxysemicarbazides 5tev after hydrogenolysis of the benzyl group gave 1-acyl-4-hydroxysemicarbazides 5wey.\n\nThe carbazide series of compounds was prepared by the reaction of NSAID hydrazides 3aec and 1-(1-benzotriazolecarbonyl)-4benzyloxysemicarbazide (7) (compounds 8aec) or by hydrogenolysis of such obtained carbazides (8def). Compound 7 was prepared from BtcCl (1) and 4-benzyloxysemicarbazide (6), which was obtained from 1-(N-benzyloxycarbamoyl)benzotriazole (4g) and hydrazine (Scheme 1).\n\nThe synthetic pathways applied for preparation of the majority of compounds involved benzotriazole as synthetic auxiliary. The benzotriazole moiety in the compounds 2aec, 4aeg and 7 activated the molecules for nucleophilic substitution with hydrazine hydrate or hydrazides, allowing the preparation of hydrazides 3aec, semicarbazides 5aev and 6 or carbazides 8aec under mild conditions. In our reactions, the hydrazides act as acyl donors but also as nucleophiles via the terminal nitrogen atom. Benzotriazole was introduced in the intermediate products by means of 1benzotriazole carboxylic acid chloride (BtcCl, 1), which was first described by our research group and now is commercially available [32] . TEA was used as a catalyst and/or HCl acceptor in several synthetic steps, but not in reactions g and k to avoid possible cyclization. The final step in preparations of 5aes and 8aec was performed in a solvent-free system. The reactions were run at a minimal temperature to afford melting (75e120 C). These reaction conditions allowed completion of the reactions in less than 20 min and in good yields.\n\nStructures of the synthesized compounds are supported by IR, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra and confirmed by elemental analysis. The chemical shifts are consistent with the proposed structures of the novel compounds (detailed NMR data are given in Tables 3e7 in the  Supporting Information) . \n\nThe target compounds 5aey and 8aef, as well as their synthetic precursors, were evaluated for inhibitory activities against proliferation of the following malignant tumor cell lines: murine leukemia (L1210), human T-lymphocyte (CEM), human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), human colon carcinoma (HCT 116), human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and human lung carcinoma (H460) ( Table 1 ). The tested compounds do not discriminate very much between the different tumor cell lines regarding their cytostatic activity, except for the human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells that are generally more sensitive to the antiproliferative activity of the compounds than the other carcinoma cell lines ( Table 1 ). The most active compounds 4benzhydryl-1- [2-(3-phenoxyphenyl) propanoyl]semicarbazide (5l), 4-benzhydryl-1- [2-(3-benzylphenyl) propanoyl]semicarbazide (5s), and 4-benzhydryl-1-[2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl]semicarbazide (5f) inhibited tumor cell proliferation at IC 50 values ranging from 3 to 23 mM. It is striking to observe that those three most active compounds consistently contain the same unique structural motif (i.e. a 4-benzhydryl-1-propanoyl-semicarbazide), whereas lack of any bulky aromatic or cycloalkyl group resulting in a free endstanding eCONHNH 2 or eCONHOH group virtually annihilates the cytostatic activity. Thus, the presence of a bulky lipophilic group, preferably a benzhydryl group, is strictly required at this terminal end. It would be interesting to introduce additional substituents on the benzhydryl moiety (i.e. alkyl, alkoxy, halogene, amine, carboxylic acid and/or hydroxyl groups) to further explore the cytostatic potential and selectivity of these test compounds. The NSAID terminal of these molecules seems to be less important (i.e. isobutyl, phenoxyphenyl, benzyl) to determine the antiproliferative potency. It would be also interesting to explore an additional SAR by modifying the latter part of the molecule.\n\nAdditional testing of the selected compounds on a non-tumor cell line HaCaT (human keratinocytes) showed that the most active derivatives 5l and 5s may exert a slight selectivity toward tumor cells (specifically solid tumor cells), compared to non-tumor cells, having up to two times lower IC 50 concentrations for tumor cell lines. All other compounds generally showed the same inhibitory effect toward tumor and non-tumor cell lines, except toward breast cancer cells MCF-7, which were shown to be slightly more sensitive. Still, these results should be interpreted with caution without detailed experiments and/or specific target identification, because although these cells are not tumorigenic, they are immortalized and have a relatively short doubling time. However, all tested NSAID derivatives show much lower toxicity toward HaCaT, compared to the reference compounds 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin.\n\nNone of the tested compounds were inhibitory at subtoxic concentrations against a broad panel of DNA and RNA viruses in cell culture.\n\nIt has been reported that many NSAIDs act either as inhibitors of free radical production or as radical scavengers [33] , while those showing reduction of lipid peroxidation, also show less ulcerogenic activity [34, 35] . In the present investigation, in vitro antioxidant ability of new NSAID derivatives 5aey and 8aef and precursors in their synthesis was studied and compared to the well-known antioxidant agents such as nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and 6hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox). Two different antioxidant assays were used: (i) interaction with the stable free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) [36] and (ii) interaction with the water-soluble azo compound 2,2 0 -azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH), used as a source of peroxyl radicals [37, 38] . DPPH interaction of the tested compounds was examined at 100 mM concentration after 20 and 60 min. The results are shown in Table 2 . 1-(1-Benzotriazolecarbonyl)-4-benzyloxysemicarbazide (7) showed the best DPPH interaction value (85%), similar to that of the reference compound NDGA (91%) at the same concentration. In the semicarbazide series 5 and carbazide series 8, only compounds with low lipophilicity values bearing hydroxamic acid/hydroxyurea moiety, 5wey and 8def, showed weak interaction with DPPH (23e39%) and their antioxidant activity increased after 60 min (46e66%).\n\nIn our studies, AAPH was used as a free radical initiator to follow oxidative changes of linoleic acid to conjugated diene hydroperoxide. The results showed that 5t, 8c and 5l were almost equipotent and completely inhibited lipid peroxidation (LP). Two other compounds, 5s and 5f, also inhibited LP better than Trolox (88 and 74%, respectively). No significant difference was observed between the other compounds of the series 5. Hydrazides 3aec were completely inactive. Our results, like some reported data [39] , indicate that LP inhibition is not always accompanied by DPPH radical scavenging activity. Thus, compounds that inhibited LP potently, exerted low (if any) DPPH scavenging activity.\n\nCarcinogenesis is a multistage process consisting of at least three separate, but closely linked processes: initiation, promotion and progression. Promotion is closely linked to oxidative and Table 2 Interaction with DPPH, in vitro inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LP), soybean lipoxygenase (LOX), and theoretically calculated C log P values [45] . inflammatory tissue damage. Conversely, substances with potent anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant activities are anticipated to exert chemopreventive effects on carcinogenesis, particularly in the stage of promotion and to act as antitumor promoters. Taking under consideration the above mentioned as well as the antioxidant and cytostatic activities of our compounds, it seems that three out of five of the most active LP inhibitors are the strongest antiproliferative agents as well. These findings support the idea that the cytostatic activity of 5l, 5s and 5f is highly correlated to their antioxidant potential (anti-lipid peroxidation activity).\n\nIn general, information obtained from the antioxidant activity may help to understand the anticancer properties of the compounds. It is known that metals, especially iron and copper, can play a key role in free radical generation and propagation. Therefore, metal chelators can act as protectors. This could be partly a possible mechanism of action of 5l, 5s, 5f. Lipoxygenases (LOXs) play a significant role in membrane lipid peroxidation by forming hydroperoxides in the lipid bilayer from the biotransformation of arachidonic acid catalyzed by LOX [40] . LOX inhibitors have attracted attention initially as potential agents for the treatment of inflammatory and allergic diseases, certain types of cancer, and cardiovascular diseases [41, 42] . In order to diminish the pro-cancerous mechanisms a key treatment strategy is to reduce the free radical load. Antioxidant activity by the scavenging of reactive oxygen species is important in preventing potential damage to cellular macromolecules such as DNA, proteins and lipids. Moreover, it has been found that LOX inhibitors may have chemopreventive activity in lung carcinogenesis [43] . Reports published over the past three decades support a growth-regulatory role of arachidonic acid metabolites in the etiology of mammary carcinogenesis [44] . Studies have demonstrated that levels of several eicosanoids are increased in breast cancer in comparison to benign breast tumors [45] .\n\nIn this context, we decided to evaluate the newly prepared NSAID derivatives for their ability to inhibit soybean LOX. It has been shown that inhibition of plant LOX activity by NSAIDs is qualitatively similar to their inhibition of the rat mast cell LOX and may be used as a simple qualitative screen for such activity [46] .\n\nFrom the tested derivatives, 5s, 5l, and 5j presented interesting IC 50 values (51.5, 60 and 75 mM) in comparison to the IC 50 value of the reference NDGA (28 mM, Table 2 ). Two of them, 5s and 5l, contain benzhydryl and the third one benzyl substituent at semicarbazide position 4, indicating that the presence of a bulky lipophilic group at this terminal end is strictly required for better LOX inhibitory activity. The fact that these compounds have high C log P values (5.80, 5.83, and 4.48, respectively) support the findings that lipophilicity is an important physicochemical property for LOX inhibitors [47] . However, compound 5f with the highest C log P value (6.11) was not the most active and presented 46% inhibition at 100 mM concentration.\n\nSince lipophilicity is a significant physicochemical property determining distribution, bioavailability, metabolic activity, and elimination, we have calculated the lipophilicity values of the prepared compounds as C log P values by the C log P programme of Biobyte Corp. [48] . BtH Scheme 1. Synthesis of 1-acyl-4-cycloalkyl(or 4-aryl)semicarbazides 5aey and 1-acyl-5-benzyloxy(or 5-hydroxy)carbamoylcarbazides 8aef, derived from NSAIDs ibuprofen, fenoprofen and reduced ketoprofen.\n\nTwo series of compounds 5aey and 8aef derived from three selected arylpropionic acids namely, ibuprofen, fenoprofen and reduced ketoprofen, were synthesized and evaluated for their cytostatic potential. The tested compounds varied very much in cytostatic activity. All intermediate products 3aec, 6 and 7 displayed no or very weak inhibitory activity against proliferation of all the tested tumor cell lines. Opposite to some reports [49, 50] , carbazides 8def with the pharmacophore eCONHOH identified in hydroxamic acids and hydroxyureas, where also completely inactive, while their O-benzyl derivatives 8aec showed a slightly better activity with IC 50 values ranging from 19 to 105 mM. Semicarbazides with a free (5wey) or a benzyl protected hydroxy group (5tev) showed no or low activity as well. However, 5-acylsemicarbazides 5aes bearing cycloalkyl or aryl substituents (cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexylmethyl, benzyl, phenylethyl, benzhydryl) at position 4 exerted a cytostatic activity against all examined malignant tumor cell lines, with a slight selectivity to MCF-7. In particular, the benzhydrylsubstituted compounds showed the most pronounced cytostatic potential. Indeed, 5l and 5s, both bearing the highly lipophilic benzhydryl group, showed marked antiproliferative activity in vitro against a variety of cancer cell lines (IC 50 \u00bc 3e19 mM). The same compounds profoundly inhibited soybean lipoxygenase and lipid peroxidase (81e99%). The ibuprofen benzhydryl analog 5f was slightly less active with IC 50 \u00bc 6e23 mM cytotoxicity, 46% inhibition of LOX and 74% LP inhibition, respectively.\n\nThe best antiscavenger activities between semicarbazide and carbazide derivatives showed 5wey and 8def with hydroxamic acid/hydroxyurea functional groups and low calculated lipophilicity value, which is in accordance with the reported findings [51, 52] . However, compound 7 showed the best DPPH interaction value (85%) from all the tested compounds. The highest LP inhibition showed compounds 5t, 8c and 5l, followed by 5s and 5f. Our results indicate that LP inhibitory activity is not always accompanied by DPPH radical scavenging activity. Compounds 5s, 5l and 5j showed as the best LOX inhibitors. The cytostatic activity of 5l, 5s and 5f is highly correlated to their antioxidant potential. The compounds depict the same activity pattern, which may suggest similar mechanisms of action correlated to their antioxidant activities. The results of our biological tests point to compounds 5s and 5l as the leading compounds for further derivatization in our search for effective antiproliferative and LP/LOX inhibitory agents. A further detailed study of antioxidant activity of 5s and 5l, along with the elucidation of specific target(s) and pathway(s) that mediate these activities, especially in a breast cancer model, should be the next steps toward novel antioxidant/chemopreventive compounds discovery."}
