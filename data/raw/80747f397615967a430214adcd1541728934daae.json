{"title": "Estimation of protection for COVID-19 in children from epidemiological information and estimate effect of policy in Japan", "body": "The initial case of COVID-19 in Japan was that of a patient who showed symptoms when returning from Wuhan, China on 3 January, 2020. As of 18 March, 2020, 690 cases were announced as infected in the community, including asymptomatic cases, but excluding those abroad in countries such as China or those infected on a large cruise ship: the Diamond Princess [1] .\n\nEarlier research suggested that children might be less susceptible to COVID-19 for lifestyle-related factors such as lack of smoking and less vigorous immune response than that of adults [2] . Children might have some cross protection from non-novel coronavirus infection. Even though the reasons for it had not become clear, the number of children among patients was quite small. In fact, even in Japan, the incidence rate including asymptomatic cases among children was 0.79 per million population compared to 5.97 for adults and 7.82 for elderly people as of 17 March. Incidence among children was approximately one-tenth that of elderly people. Therefore, this clear phenomenon must be incorporated into the model when predicting the outbreak.\n\nOn that point, we produce a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model with three age classes and search for a protection rate in children as well as the basic production number, R 0 .\n\nIn Japan, school closure (SC) and voluntary event cancellation (VEC) were All rights reserved.

The former was intended to decrease contacts among children. The latter was aimed at decreasing contact among adults. We also examine simulation of these policies as hypothetically changing contact patterns and frequencies.\n\nWe applied a simple SIR model [3] with three age classes: children 19 years old or younger, adults younger than 59 but older than 20 years old, and elderly people 60 years old or older. The incubation period was assumed to be equal for three age classes and following the empirical distribution in the outbreak in Japan.\n\nExperiences of Japanese people living in Wuhan until the outbreak provide information related to mild cases because complete laboratory surveillance was conducted for them. During January 29 -February 17, 2020, 829 Japanese people returned to Japan from Wuhan. All had received a test to detect COVID-19; of them, 14 were found to be positive for COVID-19 [4] . Of those 14, 10 Japanese people had exhibited mild symptoms; the other 4 showed no symptom. Moreover, two Japanese residents of Wuhan exhibited severe symptoms: one was confirmed as having contracted COVID-19. The other died, although no fatal case was confirmed as COVID-19 by testing. In addition, two Japanese residents of Wuhan with mild All rights reserved.

If one assumes that the Japanese fatal case in Wuhan and that the two rejected re-entrants were infected with COVID-19, then 2 severe cases, 12 mild cases, and 4 asymptomatic cases were found to exist among these Japanese residents of Wuhan. We therefore apply these proportions of asymptomatic cases to symptomatic cases in the simulation.\n\nAssuming that the power of infectivity among severe patients and mild patients are equal among asymptomatic cases, half of the symptomatic cases can be assumed. This assumption about relative infectiousness among asymptomatic cases compared with symptomatic cases was also assumed in simulation studies for influenza [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .\n\nWe presumed some fraction of children were immune. No information about it was available ex ante: we searched it in the range of (0,1). Simultaneously, we sought R 0 to fit the number of patients during 14 January -17 March and to minimize the sum of absolute values of discrepancies among the reported numbers and the fitted values. Its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using 10,000 iterations of bootstrapping for empirical distribution.\n\nThe contact patterns among children, adults, and elderly people were estimated in an earlier study [10] . We identified contact patterns as follows: the share of children All rights reserved.

That among adults was 22.2%. We assumed these numbers as a proportion of severe cases to symptomatic cases. Among children, no pneumonia case was reported. Only pneumonia cases were administered. Its length of hospitalization was assumed as 30 days. Of those, 30% of severe cases were assumed to use an intensive care unit and respirator.\n\nWe used data of the community outbreak of patients with COVID-19 who showed any symptom in Japan for 14 January -28 February, 2020. From 2 March, all schools were closed down as social mitigation for COVID-19. Contact patterns among students or between students and adult were thereby altered considerably. Therefore, we do not use data for the period during which schools were closed ad hoc for estimation. We excluded some patients who had returned from abroad, such as from China, and those who were presumed to be infected persons from the Diamond Princess. They were Japan to fit the data of community outbreak before SC and VSC introduce on 27\n\nFebruary. Using the estimated R 0 and protection rate in children, we simulate the effect of SC and VSC assuming hypothetical change in the contact matrix. We assumed that the SC decrease contact frequencies among children to be one-tenth, the rise in contacts of children with adult to be twice, the rise in contacts of adults with children to be four-thirds by 33.3%, and the decline in contacts among adults by 20%. Conversely, VEC was assumed to decrease contacts among adults by 20% and among elderly people by 25%. In the simulation with application of both of SC and VEC, the contact matrix was assumed to change to be the sum of effect of SC and VEC. To evaluate SC and VEC, we compare the total number of patients with any symptoms between the base case and intervention. We calculate 95% CI through bootstrapped distribution of total number of patients with intervention over the total number of patients in the base case.\n\nAll information used in the present study has been published previously.

Figure 1 depicts the empirical distribution of incubation period among 62 cases for which the exposed date and onset date were published by MHLW. Its mode and median were six days; the average was 6.74 days. From this information, we estimated the degree of reporting delay. Those results are presented in Table 1 . The table shows that 1/k, 1/m, and 1/km are all significant. When m is sufficiently large, the effects of 1/m and 1/km converge to zero. Therefore, the estimated degree of reporting delay consists of the term of 1/k and a constant term.\n\nBased on these results, we predict the degrees of reporting delay as 19.3 for k=1, 9.64 for k=2, 6.42 for k=3, and so on.

Therefore, all interventions were found to reduce the number of patients significantly.\n\nWe applied a simple SIR model with three age classes including asymptomatic cases and assuming some proportion of children as protected. An earlier study [11] [12] [13] estimated R 0 for COVID-19 as 2.24-3.58 in Wuhan. Our obtained R 0 was similar.\n\nHowever, we estimated the protection level among children as 40%, even though it had a wide value for 95%CI. Nevertheless, this study was the first to estimate it and to confirm rejection of the null hypotheses that the protection level was very low around 0.1 or very high around 0.9. All rights reserved.

Performed simultaneously, SC and VEC can reduce the total number of patients by 18%. However, one must be reminded that effects of SC and VEC on contact patterns and frequencies were based on assumptions. No evidence was found to verify those assumptions. Therefore, the results must be interpreted as representing one possibility.\n\nSome significant cross protection was found among children for COVID-19.\n\nMoreover, SC and VEC were found to have significant effects on reducing the total number of patients. Actually, on March 10, SC and VEC were extended until March 19.\n\nWe hope that the present study contributes to government decision-making for SC and VEC.
