{"title": "Study of the lymphocyte change between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases suggesting other factors besides uncontrolled inflammation contributed to multi-organ injury", "body": "Since its initial outbreak in the Chinese city Wuhan in early December 2019, the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and globally, with the total number of reported cases approaching 100,000. 1 The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a novel beta coronavirus based on the data from gene sequencing.\n\nAnalysis of clinical data available is in urgent demand for revealing the mechanisms of tissue damage and further devising more specific and efficient treatment strategies. 2 Compared with other beta coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV infection leads to significant differences in clinical symptoms, according to the latest studies [3] , including remarkably higher occurrence of non-fever patients, fewer upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, a different profile of increased blood cytokines, more frequent multi-organ injury, and lower death rate. [3] [4] [5] In this study, we analyzed the clinical and laboratory data of most of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients in the China city Nanjing, aimed at revealing the unique pathological features of COVID-19 cases in comparison with non-2019-nCoV-caused pneumonia cases. Importantly, through correlation analysis of the changes in blood cell subgroups and key blood biochemical indexes of tissue injury, we have discovered unexpected clues of the pathogenic process following 2019-nCoV infection, which may provide valuable information for designing efficient approaches of treatment.\n\nThese differences, along with its unusual high transmission rate, suggest a different pathological mechanism underlying its infection of the human body.\n\nAll rights reserved.

This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Second Hospital of Nanjing, with written informed consent obtained from each patient.\n\nBlood samples from patients were collected for laboratory assessments and flow cytometry according to the doctor's instruction. All patients didn't receive any treatment before blood sampling. Laboratory data were obtained from electronic medical records. Laboratory assessments comprised the following indexes: complete blood count, blood biochemical test, liver, and renal function, electrolytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02. 19.20024885 doi: medRxiv preprint CA, USA) and rinsed with 1*PBS. Finally, the samples were examined by a flow cytometry analyzer (BD FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).\n\nThe results are expressed as means \u00b1 SD. Data were statistically analyzed using Prism SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and assessed for normality or homogeneity of variance. For normally distributed continuous variables, differences between multiple groups were compared using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's tests or, if appropriate, using one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni correction. Continuous variables that were not normally distributed were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test.\n\nSpearman correlation analysis between the blood cell subgroups and the blood biochemical indexes were conducted using SPSS 19.0. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. NS = not significant.\n\nA total of 110 patients were included in the study ( Table 1) The complete blood count results indicated that the number of lymphocytes and platelets were significantly decreased in both grade 2-and grade 3-group COVID-19 patients, in comparison with non-2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients, suggesting All rights reserved.

In contrast, no significant differences in the quantities and proportions of monocytes and neutrophils were observed among these groups. Grade 3-group COVID-19 patients had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), compared with non-2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients. Blood biochemistry detection found that several indices related to organ injuries, including lactose dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and sodium ion concentration, were significantly different between grade 3-group COVID-19 patients and non2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients.\n\nTo further explore the mechanism, and since lymphopenia was observed in COVID-19 patients, we performed flow cytometry to analyze the composition of lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood from patients. As shown in Table 2 \n\nTo examine the role of inflammatory responses in organ injury of COVID-19 patients, we performed Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (\u03c1) analysis between leukocyte All rights reserved.

In COVID-19 patients, LDH, AST, and sodium ion concentration showed significant correlations (P<0.05) with total lymphocyte and all lymphocyte subsets count; meanwhile, creatinine kinase (CK), total bilirubin, eGFR, and potassium ion concentration only exhibited significant correlations with part of lymphocyte subpopulation count (Table   3 ). Among the lymphocyte subsets, CD4+ Th cells count showed significant correlations with most biochemical indices (Fig 1) . In contrast, no significant correlation was found between biochemical indexes and the counts for monocytes and neutrophils. Meanwhile, LDH only negatively correlated with CD3+ T cell count and CD8+ T cell count and AST exhibited with CD8+ T cell count in non-2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients (Table 4 ). In general, correlation analysis implied a significant negative correlation between lymphocyte subsets count and organ injury degree in COVID-19 patients rather than non-2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients.\n\nOur most striking finding is that lymphocytopenia, which is common in acute infections, 9 is particularly significant in 2019-nCoV infections. 3 Others have demonstrated the correlation between the lymphocytopenia and the clinical severity. 10 Most previous reports only compared the severe groups against non-severe patients or heath controls; to further study this clinical feature, in our study, we compared the differences in the subgroups of lymphocytes harvested from COVID-19 patients with those from pneumonia patients not infected by 2019-nCoV. We noticed that lymphocytes also decreased in the grade 2-group COVID-19 patients, suggesting that it might not only be a consequence of the infection but is probably a critical factor All rights reserved.

Among the lymphocyte subgroups, B cell exhibited the most significant differences from the non-2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients. Since B cells are responsible for the humoral immunity against the invaders via producing antibodies, 11 Another new and notable feature discovered is that the change in the proportion of the CD45+ lymphocytes was insignificant, compared with non-COVID-19 patients.\n\nRecently, postmortem results also found the numbers of trilineage in the central immune system (bone marrow) and lymphocytes in the peripheral immune system (spleen and lymph node) were all decreased significantly, indicating the peripheral lymphocytopenia cannot be simply attributed to the change of lymphocyte tissue distribution.\n\nthe impotent response of B cells may fail to restrict the virus expansion and release of free virions in vivo, which promotes the infection. 7 Thses findings, first, demonstrate that the infection impacts on different lymphocyte subgroups evenly, and more interestingly, suggest that abnormality in cells that regulate the adaptive immunity may be responsible for the reduction of lymphocytes. For instance, H5N1 infection causes lymphocytopenia through dendritic cell (DC) dysfunction, 12 suggesting the function of key antigen-presenting cells can be drastically impaired during the infection. According to a study in rats, the myeloid cells also express the 2019-nCoV receptor ACE2; 13 Moreover, recent imaging findings and postmortem biopsies reports indicate that the infection can potentially damage other organs than the lung, including the kidney, heart, liver and the testis. thus, we should consider the possibility of the virus infecting these cells, which is supported by the significant decrease in the platelet counts in both grade 2-group and grade 3-group COVID-19 patients and the reduced count of trilineage in the bone marrow .

In SARS-Cov cases, the multi-organ injury was considered as a result of the inflammatory reaction (inflammatory cytokine storm).\n\nHowever, the early report about COVID-19 cases found that the profile of cytokine in the blood of patients was different from that from SARS-Cov cases: not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, etc.) increased in the COVID-19 cases. 4 Additionally, all recent reports demonstrated that high fever cases (>38 o C) were significantly fewer (even in severe cases) in COVID-19 patients than in SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV cases. 3 These features suggest that the consequences in the COVID-19 patients might not be mainly due to the inflammatory reaction, especially in the non-severe cases. Instead, the damage was likely to be caused by the virus itself. Therefore, we performed a correlation analysis between the number of lymphocyte subgroups and the biochemical indexes. We found that most of the indexes relating to organ injuries were negatively correlated with the number of lymphocytes in 2019-nCoV infected patients but not in non-2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients, further highlighting the virus infection -rather than the inflammatory reaction -as the possible cause of the multi-organ injury. Another supportive finding is that the difference in the number of monocytes, neutrophils, and NK cells is not significant in our analysis; while theoretically, these innate immune cells are the main player in a \"cytokine storm\". Interestingly, the most significant correlation happened between the injury indexes and CD4+ Th cell counts.\n\nBecause CD4+ Th cells are critical for the regulation of both cellular immunity and humoral immunity, 17 it is reasonable that these cells are most sensitive to the total anti-virus immune responses. This finding further suggests that the damage of the tissue is from the virus itself. Consistently, studies on the tissue distribution of ACE2 All rights reserved.

Our results further suggest that the tissue damage to COVID-19 patients might be mainly due to virus infection itself rather than uncontrolled inflammatory reactions. These findings are valuable for the development of more efficient treatments.\n\nHowever, based on our clinical findings, we should seriously consider using immune-activating treatments for COVID-19 patients, which will be helpful to compensate the dysfunctions in the the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02. 19.20024885 doi: medRxiv preprint Data Availability Statement: The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\nAll rights reserved.
