{"title": "Paraneoplastic Limbic Encephalitis: Neuropsychiatric Presentation", "body": "Clinical data have repeatedly illustrated the need for psychiatrists,---especially geriatric psychiatristsmto include etiologically relevant medical disorders in psychiatric differential diagnoses (Hall et al. 1978; Hall et al. 1980; Jenicke 1985; Maricle et al. 1987) . Apparent psychosocial precipitants can sometimes lead to an erroneous or incomplete functional diagnosis when a more complex psychobiological etiology may be involved. This article presents a case report and review of the literature on one such syndrome, paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis.\n\nThe patient was a 76-year-old white married man, a retired typesetter, who was transferred from his local community hospital to the McLean Hospital Geriatric Inpatient Service for his first psychiatric admission. His chief complaint was \"I'm feeling low, but I've been healthy all my life.\" Five weeks earlier, he experienced sudden-onset amnesia following the death of his brother. This was first noticed during the funeral, when he appeared confused, needed help orienting himself, and exhibited no memory of his N.J. Newman et al. brother's death. On initial admission to a community hospital for medical/neurological evaluation, he was ambulatory and able to perform activities of daily living, but was confused, and had poor short-term memory. Evaluation revealed no specific medical etiology for his memory problems; routine laboratory tests, thyroid function studies, carotid noninvasive studies, and liver-spleen scan were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless with a glucose of 91 mg%, protein of 54 mg%, and 7% lymphocytes. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was normal. Brain scans by computer-assisted tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed asymmetric dilation of the left lateral ventricle.\n\nBehaviorally, he exhibited marked deterioration while in the community hospital, with day-night reversal and increasing nocturnal agitation. He became unable to feed or care for himself without constant supervision, struck out at staff, and tried to climb out of bed. Trials of several tranquilizers and sedatives were attempted, including haloperidol (up to 120 mg on 1 day), chlorpromazine, chloral hydrate, nembutal, lorazepam, and thioridazine. He suffered a 45-see period of apnea that was presumed to be secondary to the drugs. Differential diagnoses ranged from Alzheimer's disease to Korsakoff's syndrome, from major depression to psychogenic amnesia.\n\nThe patient had no prior psychiatric illness and no history of substance abuse, head trauma, or seizures. He had smoked in the past. Family history was significant for past alcoholism in one brother and a 3-day anmestic episode after the death of a relative in another brother.\n\nOn transfer to McLean Hospital, he was unable to stand or walk without support, and his gait was described as \"rubbery.\" He was cooperative but oriented only to person. Speech was slow and monotonous. Mood and affect appeared depressed. Thought process was without tangentiality or looseness. Thought content revealed no delusions. He denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. He showed no evidence of auditory or visual hallucinations or illusions. On cognitive testing he could name objects but remembered none of the three objects after 3 mi,~. He was unable to name the president or his own wife. He promptly forgot that his brother had died after he was reminded of the event during the admission interview. He was unaware that he was in the hospital.\n\nAdmission laboratory studies revealed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11,700 and Wintrobe sedimentation rate of 17 ram/hr. Urinalysis, serologic test for syphilis, blood cultures, blood gases, ammonia, and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal; thyroid studies showed elevated T3 uptake at 41%. Alkaline phosphatase was elevated on admission at 124 U/liter, but returned to normal within 3 weeks. Dexamethasone suppression test (1 rag) performed 2 weeks after McLean admission was abnormal, with a 4 PM baseline cortisol of 21.1 ttg/dl and 4 PM postdexamethasone cortisol of 25.2 p~g/dl. Chest x-ray films at admission and 6 weeks later both showed clear lungs. Noncontrast CT scan revealed a dilated left lateral ventrical and atrophy of the right inferofrontal and left parietal cortex. Lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 150 mm water, closing pressure of 120 mm water, with a WBC of 8 (50% lymphoeytes and 50% mono,~ytes), glucose 68 rag%, protein 60 rag%, and negative cultures. EEG demonstrated mild abnormality due to persistent background them slowing.\n\nAfter initial psychiatric evaluation, hypotheses included a toxic syndrome secondary to high doses of neuroleptics or a residuum of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. However, the patient had a normal admi~sion creatine phosphokinase, and, despite several weeks without neuroleptics, there was no change in his condition. He was always disoriented to place, date, and time, usually lethargic and somnolent, difficult to arouse during the day and more agitated in the early-to-late evening. He did not always recognize his wife, although he spoke fondly of her to staff. At times he complained of a frontal headache and said he did not feel well.\n\nOn neurological examinations repeated 12 days and 36 days after admission, shortterm memory remained poor; long-term memory was more variable. He showed no evidence of confabulation. He could count backwards from 10 to 1 but could not do serial 3 subtractions. He could follow a two-step command and perform a heel to shin maneuver without error while in bed. He had frontal release signs including pathological grasp reflexes. There were no demonstrable motor or sensory deficits.\n\nHe underwent successive individual drug trials with lorazepam, clonazepam, benztropine, diphenhydramine, lithium, thiothixene, and low-dose haloperidol with minimal effect on his agitation. His persistent problems of extreme daytime somnolence and episodic hypotension (70-90/palle) even without medications limited pharmacological options. He also exhibited hypothermia throughout his hospitalization, and the usual diurnal variation in temperature was reversed (e.g., 9 AM mean = 97.6\u00b0F; 4 PM --97. I\u00b0F). He required brief interim transfer to a medical hospital for bilateral pneumonia and a subsequent urinary tract infection, both successfully treated with antibiotics.\n\nTwo months after his McLean admission, he was discharged home in the care of his wife and home health aides. Axis I discharges diagnoses were chronic, unspecified organic brain syndrome and status postdelirium secondary to pneumonia and urinary tract infection. His agitation, however, was unmanageable, and within a few days he was admitted to the medical service at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nAt that time, a neurological evaluation revealed orientation only to person and 0/3 recall at 5 rain, but intact reading, writing, repetition, naming, comprehension, praxis, and simple calculations. There was slight left ptosis and anisocoria consistent with a left Homer's syndrome, left-beating horizontal nystagmus on left lateral gaze, a skew dev ation with left eye deviated up and out, and a flattened right nasolabial fold, all suggesting brainstem involvement. Motor, ccrebellar, and sensation functions were intact. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetric, toes flexor, and a snout reflex present. Chest radiograph revealed patchy bibasilar infiltrates.\n\nEEG showed bursts of left temporal sharp slowing superimposed on an abnormally slow background. A subsequent phenytoin trial for possible complex partial seizure activity had no clinical effect. His behavioral abnormalities persisted despite discontinuation of psychotropic medications. He developed cardiac failure, pneumonia, dyspnea, and cystitis with severe protracted hypotension (80/40), but no fever. He died 4 months after the onset of his memory problems. There was no clinical evidence of systemic malignancy.\n\nOn autopsy, the brain weighed i200 g. There was moderate atrophy of the frontal and superior temporal lobes and nioderate dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles. The hippocampal formation was markedly shrunken and discolored bilate~rally tl',roughout the entire anteroposterior extent (Figure 1 ).\n\nOn microscopic inspection, there was diffuse cortical gliosis of anterior cingulate, insular, posterior superior parietal, and temporal cortices. The giiosis was most severe in the temporal lobe, particularly in the amygdala, periamygdaloidai cortex, and hippocampal formation. Intense perivascular inflammation mad scattered microglial nodules accompanied the gliosis. Perivascular inflammatory cuffs consisted of lymphocytes admixed with plasma cells and rare mononuclear cells ( Figure 2 ). There was severe neuronal loss in the hippocampal formation with virtually complete absence of pyramidal neurons in Ammon's horn and moderate neuronal loss in the subiculum. Astrocytosis and perivascular inflammation were found in the mammillary bodies and substantia innominata, but the septal region, basal ganglia, thalamus, and hypothalamus were otherwise unafksted . Although the limbic system was primarily damaged, there were lesions in the pons and medulla with microglial proliferation, perivascular inflammation, and neuronophagia consistent with a more acute phase in the pathological process. The midbrain, cerebellum, spinal cord, dorsal and motor roots, dorsal root ganglia, and cranial nerves were unaffected.\n\nGeneral pathological examination revealed small cell (oat cell) carcinoma of the left lingula with metastases to hilar lymph nodes, and renal cell carcinoma with invasion of renal veins. There was no other gross evidence of either small cell or renal cell carcinoma metastases. Anatomical diagnosis was paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis.\n\nThe paraneoplastic syndromes constitute a diverse group of illnesses affecting 1 wide range of organ systems (Mendelsokn 1987) . By definition, they reflect the remott: effects of cancer rather than direct effects such as metastatic invasion of tissues or other, nonmetastatic consequences of systemic malignancy including metabolic and/or nutritional abncrmalities, infectious or ischemic comp!ications, or side effects of therapy.\n\nIn the nervous system, these syndromes are relatively rare and must be primarily differentiated from local intracranial, spinal, leptomeningeal, or peripheral nerve metastatic involvement (Patchell and Posner 1985; Anderson and Posner 1987) . Approximately 15%-20% of' all patients with systemic mahgnancy may have neurological symptoms at some point in their clinical course, 10% of the neurologic~ morbidity deriving from paraneoplastic syndromes (Henson and Urich 1982; Palma 1985) . The highest incidence with paraneoplastic neurological disorders is in patients with carcinoma of the lung and ovary (Henson and Urich 1982; Anderson and Posner 1987) , These symptoms may appear before systemic evidence of malignancy in as many as tlaif oi' the patients (Anderson and Posner 1987) . Frequently the neurological manifestations are debilitating in their own right.\n\nAlmost all regions of the nervous system are susceptible to a paraneoplastic process, including muscle, neuromuscular junction, root and peripheral nerve, spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebral hemispheres (Henson and Urich 1982; Stefansson and Amason 1987) . Frequently multiple neuroanatomical regions me involved clinically or pathologically. Certain cancer types tend to be associated more frequently with specific anatomical sites (Henson and Urich 1981; Palma 1985; Stefansson and Arnason 1987) . However, every syndrome has been noted, in either individual case reports or sm~! se_,'/es~ to occur in patients without systemic cancer manifested in life or on autopsy (Langston et al. il975; Dubas et al. 1982b; Henson and Urich 1982; Daniel et al. 1985; Palma 1985; Stefansson and Amason 1987) . association of encephalomyelitis with systemic carcinoma. This was amplified 3 years later by Corsellis et al. (1968) , who stressed the connection between pathological involvement of the gray matter of the lin~bic system and clinically predominant signs of memory loss and dementia. Subsequently, this syndrome was clarified and expanded, and the literature was reviewed by Henson and Urich (1982) , Dubas et al. (1982a Dubas et al. ( , 1982b , Glaser and Pincus (1969) , Dorfman and Forno (1972) , Kaplan and Itabishi (1974) , Palma (1985) , Richardson (1985) , and Anderson and Posner (1987) .\n\nThe pathology is frequently striking in its extent of destruction and its anatomic specificity. The exact anatomic boundaries of the limbic system are still a matter of some debate; physiological and molecular studies constantly redefine what constitutes a functional system within the br~n (Levitt et al. 1986 ). Over 100 years ago, Broca (1878) first described the anatomic~ly unified deep brain structures considered to be the core of the limbic system, and 50 years later, Papez (1937) suggested ~*hat this region was essential for human emotions. The main areas include the hippocampus, ~mygdala and other mesial temporal lobe structures, insula, cingulate gyms, pyriform cortex, orbital surface of the frontal lobe, hypothalamus, and occasionally, portions of basal ganglia s~ructures. Animal studies and observations in humans with anatomically localized disease further support the widely held view that the limbic system plays a central role in emotional and affective display and memory, as well as in various aspects of hormonal and visceral control (Himme!hoch et al. 1970; Torrey and Peterson 1974; Koella 1984; Isaacson 1982; Cornelius et al. 1986 ).\n\nThe gross pathology of limbic encephalitis is usually without significant abnormalities. Occasionally there is atrophy of the hippoc~pi and/or mild dilatation of the inferior horns of the lateral ventricles (Briefly et al. 1960; Henson et al. 1965; CorneliUs et al. 1968; Henson and Urich 1982) . Microscopically, however, extensive neuronal loss with reactive gliosis, perivascular monocytic infiltrates, and microglial nodules are seen.\n\nLimbic encephaliti:: is rarely found in isolation. Often characteristic pathological findings and clinical symptomatology are noted in at least one other anatomical region, specific~ly the brainstem, spinal cord, or dorsal root ganglia (Brierly e~ al. 1960; Henson et al. 1965; Corsellis et al. 1968; Dubas et al. 1982a; Dubas et al. 1982b; Henson and Urich 1982; Richardson 1985) .\n\nThe clinical presentation of limbic encephalitis has been outlined in over 40 published case histories and summarized in several brief reviews (Brierly et al. 1960; Henson et al. 1965; Corsellis et al. 1968; Olaser and Pincus 1969; DorYman and Forno, 1972; Kaplan and Itabishi 1974; Langston et al. 1975; Henson and Urich 1982; Dubas et al. 1982a; Dubas et al. 1982b; Daniel et al. 1985; Palma 1985; Richardson 1985; Cornelius et al. 1986; Anderson and Posner 1987; Camera and Chelune 1987; Franck et al. 1987; Stefansson and Amason 1987; Tandon et al. 1988) (Table 1 ). There is approximately equal frequency of both genders, and age of onset is between 50-70 years old (range 39-80). Onset can be insidious, but is freq~ently dran!atic, with prominent changes in the baseline mental status. Affective symptoms and striking difficulties with memory remain the core features. There are usually elements of depression and/or anxiety, personality changes, agitation, hallucinations, distortion of perceptions, paranoia, feelings of depersonalization, and bizarre behavior. Memory, both short and long tee'm, is significantly impaired, whereas other cognitive functions remain relatively intact.\n\nIn light of this predominantly behavioral and affective presentation, it is not surprising that the majority of these patients undergo psychiatric evaluation and even hospitalization. A review of the available case histories in the literature of pathologically proven limbic encephalitis reveals--of a total of 39 cases--only 3 who did not present with prominent mental status abnormalities (Henson et al. 1965; Dubas et al. 1982a; Dubas et al. 1982b ). Indeed, when information is provided on type of initial hospitalization, 10 of 19 patients were admitted to psychiatric services and treated with psychotropic medications and even electroconvulsive therapy (Brierly et al. 1960; Glaser and Pincus 1969; Himmelhoch et al. 1970; Dubas et al. 1982a; Dubas et al. 1982b; Richardson 1985; Cornelius et al. 1986; Camara and Chelune 1987; Tandon et al. 1988 ). However, the history, especially the rapidity of onset in the rn~ddle-aged to elderly patient without previous psychiatric difficulties, combined with formal mental status testing, may suggest an underlying medical etiology.\n\nGeneral and neurological examinations (apart from mental status testing) may be entirely normal. Detailed neurological evaluation, however, may reveal subtle asymmetries or brainstem, spinal cord, cerebellar, or peripheral nerve abnormalities reflecting involvement of another portion of the nervous system. Later in the course, seizures, both psychomotor and grand mal, have been reported. CT and MRI studies are usually with normal limit~. EEGs may be normal early in the clinical course, but eventually show nonspecific abnormalities such as generalized background slowing, occasionally with superimposed unilateral or bilateral temporal slow waves and/or spike foci. Lumbar punctures reveal normal opening and closing pressures, normal C~I~F glucose levels, an elevated protein (greater than 45 mg%) in approximately 75% (range = normal to 480, mean -87), and a mononuclear predominant pleocytosis in approximately 60% of cases (range -0-146, mean -30).\n\nThe course is typically subacute with worsening over weeks or months. Fluctuations have been reposed, but no spontaneous remissions, and the course is generally progressive. Survival from presentation until death ranges from I to 22 months. Initial differential diagnosis includes the infectious encephalitides (especially viral, the slow virus of subacute spongiform encephalopathy, and Whipple's disease), metabolic disorders, KorsakofFs syndrome, degenerative dementias, bilateral infarctions, central nervous system vasculitis, systemic l\u00a2pus erythematosus, and cerebral metastases.\n\nOn autopsy, the associated malignaney is usually oat cell carcinoma of the lung, but primary malignancies in ovary, breast, stomach, uterus, kidney, and colon have been reported (Briefly et aL 1960; Henson et al. 1965; Corselli:; et al. 1968; Himmelhoch et al. 1970; Doffman ~d Fo~o 1972; Kaplan and Itabisbi 1974; Dubas et al. 1982a Dubas et al. , 1982b Henson and Urich 1~82; Richardson 1985; Cornelius et al. 1986; Anderson and Posner 1987; Camara and Chelune 1987; Franck et al. 1987; Janati et al. 1987; Tandon et al. 1988 ). It has been suggested that a similar syndrome can occur with the recurrence of Hodgldn's disease (Cart 1982) , but there have been no pathologically proven cases. The identical clinical and pathological syndrome has also been noted in the absence of cancer on general necropsy (Hin~melhoch et al. 1970; Langston et al. 1975; Dubas et al. 1982b; Delsedime et al. 1984; Daniel et al. 1985) . No distinction among underlying tumor pathologies can be made based on the clinical presentation of this paraneoplastic syndrome. \n\nThe etiology of limbic encephalitis remains unknown. In several other paraneopiastic syndromes of the nervous system, a causal agent or a pathophysiological mechanism has been strongly suspected or proven to exist: for example, progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy due to JC papova virus (no longer considered a paraneoplastic syndrome once the etiological agent was discovered); Eaton-Lambert syndrome secondary to antibodies directed against components of the presynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction; cerebellar degeneration linked with anti-Purkinje cell antibodies (raising the question of common tumor cell and cerebellar antigens and a resultant autoimmune pathology); and paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy associated with antisensory neuronal antibodies (Lang et al. 1981; Jaeckle et al. 198~; Palma 1985; Graus et al. 1986; Greenlee and Lipton 1986; Anderson and Posner 1987) . Similar etiologies have been proposed for limbic encephalitis, the first involving direct viral infection. The pathology suggests an infective etiology, and 2 cases have been reported to exhibit intranuclear (Himmelhoch et al. 1970 ) and intracytoplasmic (Kaplan and Itabishi 1974) inclusion bodies; however, no viral particles have ever been isolated. Laviet al. (1988) have described a mouse model of viral-induced encephalitis, anatomically restricted to the limbic system and its connections, produced by intranasal inoculation of a coronavirus into mice. Intracerebral inoculation of Borna virus in rats and primates produces a clinicopathological entity very similar to human limh~c encephalitis (Sprankel et al. 1978; Narayan et al. 1983; Ludwig et al. 1988) . Interestingly, Borna virds may play an etiological role in affective disorders, as suggested by the increased incidence of Borna vi:ms-specific antibodies in patients with bipolar and unipolar depression (Amsterdam et al. 1985; Rott et al. 1985; Ludwig et al. 1988) .\n\nThe immune-mediated theory suggests either tumor/limbic system antigen cross-reactivity or an underlying host autoimmune disorder. The latter might explain why some cases show no sy~te;aic malignancy on autopsy; they could be either idiopathic or secondary to viral transform~ticn of the immune system. Of relevance to this theory is the recent generation of a monoclonal antibod3 in rats that recognizes an antigen or antigens specific to neurons of the limbic system ~ ,ccitt 1984; Levitt et al. 1986 ). Recently, 3 patients with clinical limbic encephalitis ~ ~,re reported whose serum contained antineuronal IgG antibodies that bound in vitro to ~euronal nuclei of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, brainstem, and dorsal and anterior hor~s and to cerebellar granular, Purkinje, basket, and stellate ceils (Jaeckle et al. 1988 ). All 3 cases had concurrent, paraneoplastic clinical involvement in the peripheral nervous system (1 motor neuronopathy, 2 sensory neuropathies). In 1 patient, plasmapheresis resulted in clinical improvement peripherally, with simultaneous reduction in the antineuronal antibody titer.\n\nIn the present patient~ one might speculate that the psychological loss of his brother precipitated immune compromise, as has been reported in bereavement (Bartrop et al. 1977; Schleifer et al. 1983 ). However, bereavement is unlikely as a primary factor because of the immediate onset of his symptoms at the funeral. Previous studies suggest a lag period of 4-8 weeks between the loss and the development of immune impairments (Bartrop et al. 1977; Schleifer et al. 1983 ).\n\nTreatment of the paraneoplastic syndromes becomes an increasingly important issue as patients survive longer and more comfortably due to more successful therapies against the primary malignancy. Until the etiology of limbic encephalitis is clarified, the options are direct treatment of the underlying cancer ~d symptomatic treatment of the psychiatric manifestations. Supporting this approach are repol\"ts of treatment of malignancy reversing remote effects ~f certain systemic paraneoplastic syndromes such as Trousseau's syndrome with adenocarcinoma, hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy and lung cancer, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and oat cell carcinoma, nephrotic syndrome and the lymphomas, and dermatomyositis and its associated malignancies (Mar'man i986; Anderson and Posner 1~87) . Less frequent are the reports of improvement of the primarily neurological paraneoplastic syndromes. However, case reports and smali series do exist, particularly with the Eaton-La~nbert syndrome due to small cell carcinoma, and with certain neuropathies and neurom~/opathies associated with surgically excisable tumors (Markman 1986; Anderson and Posner 1987) .\n\nPerhaps the lack of plasticity of the adult central nervous system--its known poor regenerative reserve--..m~es the reversal of limbic encephalitis a rare occurrence (Greco 1986; Markman 1986 ). There are 2 reported cases of clinical limbic encephalitis with lalown oat cell carcinoma in which there was documented clinical improvement following systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy (in 1 case, directed at the chest; in the ,~*.her, ~t the chest and cranium) (Markman and Abeloff 1982; Brennan and Craddock ~o83) . Memory loss, personality changes, and hallucinations in a 16-year-old with Hodg-~Jn's disease were entirely reversed with treatment of the lymphoma (Carr 1982). In a case of clinical limbic encephalitis secondary to an adenocarcinoma of the colon, cognition was not restored despite improvement in mood, behavior, and appetite after surgical removal of the cancer (Ianati et al. 1987) . Although there is no pathological verification of limbic encephalitis in these 4 cases, the indication that therapy of the primary malignancy might reverse a syndrome that is highly disabling in its own right has important implications. This is true for both etiology and for early recognition and diagnosis of the syndrome as a marker of an occult but potentially treatable neoplasm.\n\nin conclusion, this patient's case demonstrated a puzzling, precipitous course that suggested an underlying medical disorder despite the lack of definite diagnosis during life. In retrospect, his smoking and occupational history could have contributed risk factors for development of malignancy. However, until autopsy, no laboratory studies revealed carcinoma in either lung or kidney. His initial presentation suggested a possible psychogenic component with grief over his brother's death. However, his persistent disorientation and the extreme hypotension and hypothermia despite the passage of time, treatment for infections, and changes in medication, indicated an atypical syndrome of uncertain medical etiology. His autonomic signs and his delirium on and off psychotropic medications pointed to an etiology other than a degenerative dementia or iatrogenic delirium. Patients with limbic encephalitis can exhibit a prominent impairment of recent memory in combination with behaviors that range from depression and paranoia in a relatively intact sensorium to agitation and atypical bizarre actions with confusion and disorientation.\n\nThis case emphasizes the need to take the full medic~d and psychiatric presentation into account in patients with atypical syndromes. Paradoxical or unusual responses to psychotropic medications or inexplicable autonomic and neurologic~ findings should encourage exhaustive investigation for occult medical disorders. In cases of limbic encephalitis, serial mental status and neurological examinations, EEGs, and lumbar punc-N.J. Newman et al. I990; tures would be most helpful in determining the progressive emergence of the specific etiology.\n\nThe aumors thank Seth Finklestein, M.D. and Ruth Richards M.D., PhD for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this manuscript."}
