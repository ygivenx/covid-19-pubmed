{"title": "Virol. (Insl. Pasteur) 1982, 133 I", "body": "In Kivu (Eastern Zaire), pediatric diarrhoea accounts for more fatalities than any other disease. Pilot studies carried out in several tropical areas have shown that rotavirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in children under two years of age, confirming its world-wide distribution [1, 2, 3] . Thus, large seasonal epidemics of diarrhoea are often reported in regions with a high incidence of rotavirus infection throughout the year. Also, in industrialized countries this agent seems to be highly prevalent at times when the isolation rate of bacterial enteropathogens is 1%. Since most of the studies mentioned above have been performed in hospitalized children, we thought it worthwhile to evaluate the role of viruses in diarrhoeal disease in Kivu, both in rural and urban outpatients.\n\nThis investigation was conducted in the province of Kivu, at the children's hospital of Lwiro which is a centre for the treatment of malnutrition. Temperature in this area is relatively constant (20-25 ~ C), seasons being characterized by an alternation of dry and rainy periods. The study was performed in June 1979, which marks the beginning of the dry season and in November 1979 during the rainy season. All patients studied were less than 15 years of age, each child presenting 3 liquid stools or more a day, being defined as a diarrhoeic patient.\n\nOur study group consisted of 916 patients, of whom 480 were outpatients with a diarrhoeal illness (416 children from rural and 64 from urban origin), 236 were hospitalized children suffering form malnutrition and 200 were healthy controls. \n\nRotaviruses were detected in 4.4 % of rural outpatients during the dry season and in 1.8 % during the rainy season, whereas enteric adenoviruses were found in only one diarrhoeic child (0.4 % in the dry season). Symptomless controls also occasionally excreted rotaviruses in their stools (0.5 %). It is worth mentioning that coronavirus-like particles were equally visualized by electron microscopy, in both diarrhoeie and control patients. A bacterial enteropathogen was isolated in 39.9 % of the patients during the dry season and in 47.2 % during the rainy season. It was also found in 8 % of control eases.\n\nAmong hospitalized patients, rotavirus excretion occurred in one child suffering from diarrhoea whereas no virus shedding could be observed in asymptomatie eases.\n\nThe age distribution of the different enteroFathogenic agents confirms that rotavirus occurs mainly in children under two years of age (92 %). The difference in detection rate between rural (4.4 %) and urban patients (7.5 %) was not statistically significant. Considering the delay between the onset of diarrhoea and the collection of the stool sample, it appears that 90 % of rotavirus isolates are detected during the early stage of the disease, as expected.\n\nTo our surprise only a small number of children excreted viruses in their stools during this study period. These data suggest that the prevalence of viral infections is lower in this region of Zaire than that generally observed in other tropical countries. It must, however, be emphasized that the isolation rate of bacterial agents was high during the two study periods and that, as said earlier, a high prevalence of bacterial infections is usually associated with a low frequency of viral infections.\n\nThese results further indicate the need for longitudinal studies because we feel that this investigation was conducted in a non-epidemic period.\n\nMOTS-CL]~S : Diarrhde, Rotavirus, Addnovirus, Za~re ; Enfant."}
