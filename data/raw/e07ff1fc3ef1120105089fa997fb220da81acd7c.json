{"title": "Functional analysis of the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) on virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells following coronavirus infection of the central nervous system", "body": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a single-strand, positivesense RNA virus that is a member of the family Coronaviradae. Intracranial infection of susceptible mice with neurotropic strains of MHV reproducibly results in an acute encephalomyelitis followed by a chronic demyelinating disease similar in pathology to the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) (Houtman and Fleming, 1996; Lane and Buchmeier, 1997) . The acute stage of MHV infection is characterized by replication of virus in both neurons and glia and widespread distribution throughout the parenchyma. In contrast, during the chronic stage of disease, viral RNA and protein predominate within white matter tracts undergoing demyelination. The T cell response to MHV following infection of the CNS is crucial for optimal host defense and clearance of virus Marten et al., 2001; Williamson and Stohlman, 1990 ). In addition, T cells have been implicated as important effector cells in amplifying the severity of demyelination in MHVinfected mice (Houtman and Fleming, 1996; Liu et al., 2001a; Wu et al., 2000) . Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which these cells traffic and accumulate within the central nervous system (CNS) following MHV infection is important with regard to understanding both host defense and disease progression.\n\nA robust expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors occurs within the CNS of MHV-infected mice during both acute and chronic stages of disease (Lane et al., 1998) . These observations suggest a role for these molecules in both host defense and disease by attracting targeted populations of leukocytes into the CNS. Indeed, a series of recent studies from our laboratory using both chemokine receptor knock-out mice as well as neutralizing antibodies to select chemokines have clearly demonstrated a nonredundant and important role for chemokines and chemokine receptors in participating in clearance of virus from the brain as well as demyelination (Chen et al., 2001; Glass et al., 2001; Lane et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2000 Liu et al., , 2001b . Given the important role for T cells and chemokine receptors in both host defense and disease development following MHV infection of the CNS, we have sought to better understand how these cells traffic into the CNS following viral infection. A recent report from our laboratory demonstrated that the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is important for trafficking of virus-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells into the CNS of MHV-infected mice (Glass and Lane, 2003) . Analysis of the chemokine receptor profile expressed by virus-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells obtained from CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice revealed reduced expression of various chemokine receptors, suggesting that CCR5 signaling regulates expression of additional chemokine receptors that participate in T cell trafficking and accumulation within the CNS of infected mice. To expand our understanding of how CCR5 regulates T cell activation and trafficking within the context of MHV infection of the CNS, CD8 \u03e9 T cells specific for the immunodominant epitope present within the spike (S) glycoprotein spanning amino acids 510-518 (S510-518) were generated from either CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 or CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice and the antiviral and migration activities analyzed. The results presented indicate that CCR5 signaling imparts a downstream effect on IFN-\u2425 production and CTL activity but is not essential for trafficking into the CNS or the development of demyelination.\n\nT cells were isolated from the brains of MHV-infected CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice at Days 7 and 12 p.i. and total numbers of CD8 \u03e9 T cells specific for the S510-518 epitope were determined by intracellular cytokine staining. Such analysis revealed a \u03fe35% decrease in the number of S510-518 responsive CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the CNS of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice at Day 7 postinfection compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice as judged by IFN-\u2425 secretion following S510-518 peptide stimulation (Figs. 1A and B) . However, the number of S510-518 responsive cells within the CNS of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice was \u03fe45% higher compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice at Day 12 p.i. (Figs. 1A and B) . Analysis of total numbers of CD8 \u03e9 T cells indicated a 40% decrease in numbers of cells isolated from the CNS of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice at Day 7 p.i. compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice, which is consistent with earlier studies (Fig. 1C ) (Glass et al., 2001) . However, by Day 12 p.i., both groups of mice had similar numbers of CD8 \u03e9 T cells in their CNS (Fig. 1C) . These data suggested that CCR5 signaling modulates both antigen-specific and nonantigen-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cell accumulation within the CNS of MHV-infected mice. \n\nTo further assess the contributions of CCR5 signaling to virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cell migration into the CNS, S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells were obtained from immunized CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice and adoptively transferred into MHV-infected RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice (Chen et al., 2001; Glass and Lane, 2003) . Recipient mice were injected intravenously (iv) with a total of 2.5 \u03eb 10 6 cells, sacrificed 9 days posttransfer (12 days p.i.), and brains were collected to determine viral titers and infiltration of CD8 \u03e9 T cells into the CNS. Although neither recipient group of mice cleared virus, there was a twofold decrease (P \u0545 0.05) in the viral burden within the brains of mice that received CCR5 \u03ea/\u03eaderived CD8 \u03e9 T cells compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells (Table 1) . Interestingly there were comparable numbers of S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells present in the CNS of RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea recipients, suggesting an enhanced antiviral activity by CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells (Table  1) . The fact that similar numbers of S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells from both CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were present within the brains of infected recipient mice indicated that CCR5 is not required for entry of these cells into the CNS. Chemokine receptor gene expression on S510-518-expanded CD8 \u03e9 T cells from CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice was compared using semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 , a similar chemokine receptor gene profile is detected in antigen-expanded CD8 \u03e9 T cells from either CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 or CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Transcripts for CCR1, CCR2, and CXCR3 are prominently expressed in both populations of cells, while CCR3 and CCR4 are not detected. We have previously demonstrated that CCR2 and CXCR3 signaling enhances T cell trafficking and accumulation within the CNS of MHV-infected mice (Chen et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2000 Liu et al., , 2001b . Therefore, it is likely that S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells are able to utilize these receptors and gain access into the brains of mice.\n\nIn addition to their important role in host defense, T cells also contribute to myelin destruction Wu and Perlman, 1999) . One mechanism by which T cells amplify the severity of demyelination in MHV-infected mice is by attracting macrophages into the CNS . To determine whether S510-518-reactive CD8 \u03e9 T cells contribute to demyelination, spinal cords were removed from RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice following adoptive transfer of either CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 or CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells and the severity of demyelination was determined by Luxol-fast blue staining. Such analysis revealed only focal areas of Table 1 CCR5 is not required for CNS entry of S510 -518 specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells\n\nPosttransfer day\n\nBrain titer a,b (PFU/g) S510-518 reactive CD8 \u03e9 T Cells CD45 high /F480 Demyelination RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea N/A 2.7 \u03eb 10 5 \u03ee 5.9 \u03eb 10 4 (7) c 0 (3) 5.8 \u03eb 10 4 \u03ee 4.6 \u03eb 10 3 (3) 0 (8) CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 (CD8) 3 RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea 9 2.2 \u03eb 10 5 \u03ee 1.8 \u03eb 10 4 (4) 2.2 \u03eb 10 4 \u03ee 6.2 \u03eb 10 3 (3) 2.9 \u03eb 10 5 \u03ee 6.8 \u03eb 10 3 (5)\n\n1.1 \u03eb 10 5 \u03ee 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 (6) d,e 2.6 \u03eb 10 4 \u03ee 2.2 \u03eb 10 3 (3) 5.2 \u03eb 10 5 \u03ee 3.9 \u03eb 10 3 (5) d 0.8 \u03ee 0.2 (8) a All data are presented as mean \u03ee SEM. b Flow data are presented as total number of cells present within the gated population. c Parentheses indicate number of mice used. d P \u0545 0.04 when compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 (CD8)3 RAG 1 \u03ea/\u03ea . e P \u0545 0.01 when compared to RAG 1 \u03ea/\u03ea .

Similar levels of receptor transcript expression is seen from CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells with regards to CCR1, CCR2, and CXCR3. Expression of CCR3 or CCR4 is not found in either cell type. Fig. 3 .

RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea recipients of either CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells both display focal areas of cellular infiltration accompanied by demyelination (denoted by arrows). Each \u03eb40 and \u03eb100 panel was generated by photographing six fields of a single spinal cord at the indicated magnification and aligning images. Spinal cords presented are representative of at least four individual mice per group from two separate experiments. Fig. 4 .

CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells exhibited increased CTL activity compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells. The differences are significant until the effector-to-target ratio reaches 1:5. Data presented are from two experiments with a total of five mice in each group.\n\ndemyelination with accompanying cellular infiltration in RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea recipients of donor CD8 \u03e9 T cells from either CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 or CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice (Fig. 3) . Although there was an approximate 45% increase in the number of macrophages (F480 \u03e9 /CD45 high ) present within the CNS of RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea recipients of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea CD8 \u03e9 T cells compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells, there was no significant difference in the severity of demyelination (Table 1) .\n\nTo further investigate the contributions of CCR5 signaling to antiviral activities associated with CD8 \u03e9 T cells, CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were immunized with MHV and spleen cells were exposed to the immunodominant CD8 \u03e9 T cell epitope and IFN-\u2425 production determined by ELISA. This analysis revealed a significant increase (P \u0545 0.05) in IFN-\u2425 produced by splenocytes obtained from CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice compared to splenocytes obtained from CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice (Fig. 4A) . Moreover, intracellular cytokine staining of S510-518-expanded cells indicated CCR5 \u03ea/\u03eaderived CD8 \u03e9 T cells produced increased levels of IFN-\u2425 as compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells as measured by the MFI of IFN-\u2425 staining (Fig. 4B) . These data indicate that the absence of CCR5 signaling enhances IFN-\u2425 production by CD8 \u03e9 T cells following exposure to the immunodominant CD8 \u03e9 T cell epitope in this model. To determine any differences in killing ability, a 51 Cr-release CTL assay was employed. The results shown in Fig. 4C indicate that S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells from CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice displayed enhanced CTL activity when compared to antigen-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells obtained from CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice.\n\nActivated CD8 \u03e9 T cells increase expression of CCR5 in response to viral infection. For example, Nansen et al. (2002) have reported increased expression of chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5 on CD8 \u03e9 T cells following infection with either lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Expression of these chemokine receptors by CD8 \u03e9 T cells was associated with the ability of these cells to migrate to areas of viral infection, suggesting a functional role following infection with either of these viruses. Fukada et al. (2002) report that CCR5 is expressed on both effector and memory CD8 \u03e9 T cells obtained from HIV-infected individuals. These cells were able to migrate in response to RANTES/CCL5, indicating a role in either host defense or immune-mediated pathogenesis by allowing these cells to traffic to areas of viral infection (Fukada et al., 2002) . Further support for CCR5 in contributing to CD8 \u03e9 T cell antiviral immunity comes from a report that demonstrated CTL clones expressed CCR5 and were able to migrate to areas of viral infection that contained the CCR5 ligands MIP-1\u2423/CCL3 and MIP-1\u2424/CCL4 following infusion into HIV-infected patients (Brodie et al., 2000) . Therefore, the accumulated data indicate that CCR5 is expressed on activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells following viral infection and the contributions of this receptor to either defense or disease appear to be dependent on the challenging virus.\n\nMHV infection of the CNS results in expression of the CCR5 signaling ligands RANTES/CCL5 and MIP-1\u2423/ CCL3 (Glass et al., 2001; Lane et al., 1998) . Expression of both RANTES/CCL5 and CCR5 is important in contributing to demyelination following MHV infection by allowing macrophages to traffic into the CNS and participate in white matter destruction (Glass et al., 2001; Lane et al., 2000) . CCR5 is also expressed on activated T cells following viral infection and we have recently determined that signaling through this receptor enhances MHV-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cell accumulation within the CNS presumably by responding to either RANTES/CCL5 or MIP-1\u2423/CCL3 (Glass and Lane, 2003) . The data presented in this article clearly indicate that CCR5 signaling is not required for CD8 \u03e9 T cells to traffic to and/or accumulate within the CNS following MHV infection. Consistent with our earlier studies (Glass et al., 2001) , there were decreased numbers of CD8 \u03e9 T cells present within the CNS of MHV-infected CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice as compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice at Day 7, and there are increased numbers of CD8 \u03e9 T cells at Day 12 p.i. This may be explained by an impaired ability to rapidly mount an adaptive immune response to virus during acute disease. However, at later stages of infection antigen-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells are able to accumulate within the CNS. RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea recipients of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea -derived S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells displayed lower (P \u0545 0.05) viral titers in the brains compared to recipients of CD8 \u03e9 T cells obtained from CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice. These data are consistent with the demonstrated in vitro enhanced antiviral activities by CD8 \u03e9 T cells derived from CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. However, neither recipient group of mice was able to completely clear virus from the brain, which is consistent with recent reports that CD8 \u03e9 T cells alone are not sufficient for elimination of MHV from the CNS Stohlman et al., 1998) .\n\nWith regards to histological disease, emerging evidence indicates that CD8 \u03e9 T cells can contribute to demyelination in MHV-infected mice Wu et al., 2000) . The results presented in the current study support these earlier studies and demonstrate that adoptive transfer of MHV-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells from either CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 or CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice into MHVinfected RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice can result in focal areas of demyelination with accompanying cellular infiltration . However, the overall extent of demyelination in either recipient group was markedly reduced as compared to RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice that received MHV-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells, which further supports a more prominent role for this T cell subset in contributing to MHV-induced demyelination (Glass and Lane, 2003; Lane et al., 2000) . An interesting observation was the demonstration of an increased numbers of macrophages present within the CNS of RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea recipients of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells as compared to recipients of CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells. The underlying reasons for increased macrophage accumulation but only limited demyelination within the CNS of these mice are not entirely clear but may relate to altered expression of additional cytokines and/or chemokines that are necessary for macrophage activation and myelin destruction to occur.\n\nIn summary, these data highlight the nonredundant nature of chemokine receptor signaling as it relates to T cell activation and trafficking in response to MHV infection of the CNS. CCR5 signaling does not regulate IFN-\u2425 expression by virus-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells but it is important for trafficking of these cells into the CNS of infected mice (Glass and Lane, 2003) . In marked contrast, CCR5 regulates both IFN-\u2425 and CTL activity by virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells, which correlates with both in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities. However, CCR5 signaling is not required for CD8 \u03e9 T cell migration and infiltration into the CNS. Collectively, these data provide evidence that CCR5 signaling differentially regulates CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cell functional activities following viral infection. This is important when considering strategies for targeting this receptor in the treatment of human diseases.\n\nMHV strain J2.2V-1 was kindly provided by Dr. John Fleming, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI. Agematched (5-7 weeks) CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice (eighth generation backcrossed to C57BL/6, H-2 b background, kindly provided by W. Kuziel, University of Texas, Austin, TX) were used for all experiments (Glass et al., 2001) . PCR analysis of DNA obtained from tail preparations confirmed that CCR5 was not expressed in CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice (Glass and Lane, 2003; Glass et al., 2001) . Following anesthetization by inhalation of methoxyflurane (Pitman-Moore Inc., Washington Crossing, NJ), mice were injected intracranially (i.c.) with 1000 PFU of MHV suspended in 30 L of sterile saline. Control (sham) animals were injected with 30 L sterile saline alone. Animals were sacrificed at defined time points and brains and spinal cords were removed for analysis in studies described. One-half of each brain at each time point was used for plaque assay on the DBT astrocytoma cell line to determine viral burden (Hirano et al., 1978; Lane et al., 1998) . The remaining halves were either used for histological analysis, stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C for RNA isolation, or used for FACS analysis.\n\nGeneration of S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were immunized intraperitoneally (ip) with 2 \u03eb 10 5 PFU MHV and animals were sacrificed at Day 8 postimmunization. Spleens were harvested and a population of cells obtained through use of a magnetically labeled antibody specific for the CD4 antigen followed by passage over a magnetic column (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Cells separated with the CD4 antibody are considered CD8-enriched T cells, which was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. The CD8-enriched population of cells was incubated in high-glucose DMEM containing 5 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 M \u2424-mercaptoethanol and 10% FBS at a concentration of 5 \u03eb 10 6 cells/mL. Added was 5 M of the CD8 immunodominant peptide corresponding to the viral spike (S) glycoprotein encompassing residues 510-518 (S510-518) (Castro and Perlman, 1995) . Following 2 days of culture in the presence of peptide, T-stim (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) was added to the culture according to the manufacturer's specifications and the cells were incubated an additional 4 days. Live cells were separated using Lympholyte-M (Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd., Ontario, Canada).\n\nIntracellular staining for IFN-\u2425 was performed on S510-518 peptide-expanded CD8 \u03e9 T cells using a previously described procedure (Chen et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2000) . In brief, following a 6 h incubation at 37\u00b0C in medium containing GolgiStop (Cytofix/Cytoperm kit, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), cells were washed and blocked with PBS containing 10% FBS and a 1:200 dilution of CD 16/32 (Pharmingen). Cells were then stained for surface antigens with either FITC-conjugated CD8 (Pharmingen) or Rat IgG-2b for 45 min at 4\u00b0C. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/ Cytoperm kit and stained for intracellular IFN-\u2425 using PE-conjugated anti-IFN-\u2425 (1:50; XMG1.2, Pharmingen) for 45 min at 4\u00b0C. Cells were analyzed on a FACStar (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Data are presented as the percentage of positive cells within the gated population.\n\nSupernatants from S510-518 peptide-expanded CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea cells were collected following 48 h stimulation and IFN-\u2425 production was determined through use of a Quantikine M Mouse IFN-\u2425 Immunoassay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Samples were measured in triplicate and IFN-\u2425 concentrations were presented as picograms per milliliters.\n\nS510-518-expanded CD8 \u03e9 T cells obtained from either CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 or CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were adoptively transferred (2.5 \u03eb 10 6 cells suspended in 100 L sterile HBSS) via iv injection into the retro-orbital sinus of RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice 3 days following i.c. infection with 1000 PFU of MHV (Chen et al., 2001) . Mice were sacrificed 9 days posttransfer (12 days p.i.) and brains and spinal cords were removed. Onehalf of the brains were used for flow analysis and the remaining half was used to determine viral titers. Spinal cords were removed and stained with Luxol-fast blue (LFB) to assess the severity of demyelination. Control animals included MHV-infected (i.c.) RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice receiving iv sterile HBSS.\n\nMononuclear cells were obtained from brains of experimental groups of mice at defined times postinfection (p.i.) and a single-cell suspension was obtained using a previously described protocol . Antibodies used for flow cytometry in these studies included FITC rat anti-mouse CD4, CD8 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), F4/80 (Serotec), and PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD45 (Pharmingen). In all cases, an isotype-matched FITC-conjugated antibody was used. Cells were incubated with antibodies for 45 min at 4\u00b0C, washed, and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. Following fixation, cells were analyzed on a FACStar (Becton-Dickinson). The data presented represent the number of positive cells present within the gated population.\n\nSpinal cords were removed at 12 days p.i. and fixed by immersion overnight in 10% normal buffered Formalin (NBF) for paraffin. The severity of demyelination was determined by LFB staining of spinal cords and analyzed with a light microscope. LFB-stained spinal cord sections were coded and read blind by two investigators. Demyelination was scored as follows: 0, no demyelination; 1, mild inflammation accompanied by loss of myelin integrity; 2, moderate inflammation with increasing myelin damage; 3, numerous inflammatory lesions accompanied by significant increase in myelin stripping; and 4, intense areas of inflammation accompanied by numerous phagocytic cells engulfing myelin debris . An average of five spinal cords were scored per group with a minimum of six 10-m sections per mouse investigated. Scores were averaged and presented as mean \u03ee SEM.\n\nSpleen-derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells were analyzed for lytic activity following immunization of CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice with 2.5 \u03eb 10 5 PFU of MHV. Spleno-cytes from infected mice were stimulated in vitro with 5 M S510-518 peptide in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5 \u03eb 10 \u03ea2 M \u2424-mercaptoethanol, nonessential amino acids, 10% FBS, and T-Stim (Becton-Dickinson, Bedford, MA) for 6 days before determination of lytic activity. CTL assays were performed with Na 51 CrO 4 (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA)-labeled RMA-s (H-2 b ) target cells preincubated with 1 M S510-518 peptide or 5 M OVA Peptide (American Peptide Co., Sunnyvale, CA) as a control. Cr 51 release was determined after 6 h of incubation. Specific lysis was defined as 100 \u03eb [(experimental release \u03ea spontaneous release)/(detergent release \u03ea spontaneous release)].\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from S510-518-expanded CD8 \u03e9 T cells using Trizol reagent (Gibco) and reversetranscribed using the AMV reverse transcriptase system (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR amplification was performed on resulting cDNA for 30 cycles with specific primers for either CCR1 (forward, 5\u0408 GAATTCGA-CAGCCAGGTTGAACAGGT; reverse, 5\u0408 GCGGC-CGCCTGCTGTAAGAGCCTTTGGG), CCR2 (forward, 5\u0408 GAATTCGATTCCTGGAAGGTGGTCAA; reverse, 5\u0408 GCGGCCGCATTCTCCACACCCTGTTTCG), CCR3 (forward, 5\u0408 GAATTCTCCAAAAATGTGCTGTGGAA; reverse, 5\u0408 GCGGCCGCGATCTTTCCTGCAGTCCTCG), CCR4 (forward, 5\u0408 GAATTCAGAGAGGAGGCAG-GAAGACC; reverse, 5\u0408 GCGGCCGCAGAGGTCA-CAGACACCACCC), CCR5 (forward, 5\u0408 GAATTCGT-TCTCCTGTGGATCGGGTA; reverse, 5\u0408 GCGGCCG-CACACACTGCTGCCTAAACCC), CXCR3 (forward, 5\u0408 GCGGCCGCAACTCTTCCATTGTGG; reverse, 5\u0408 GAATTCAAGGCCCCTGCATAGAAGTT) or L32 (forward, 5\u0408 AACCCAGAGGCATTGACAAC; reverse, 5\u0408 AACGCTCAGCTCCTTGACAT). Amplification was performed on an automated Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, CT) model 480 DNA thermocycler using the following profile: step 1, initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 45 s; step 2, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 45 s; and step 3, extension at 72\u00b0C for 2 min. Steps 1 to 3 were repeated 29 times for a total of 30 cycles and followed by a 7-min incubation at 72\u00b0C. The resulting amplicons were visualized by gel electrophoresis and were of the correct size corresponding to the specific primers used.\n\nStatistically significant differences between groups of mice were determined by Student's t test and P values of \u05450.05 were considered significant."}
