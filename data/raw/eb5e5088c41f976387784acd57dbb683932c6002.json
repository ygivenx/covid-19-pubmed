{"title": "The RZZ complex integrates spindle checkpoint maintenance with dynamic expansion of unattached kinetochores", "body": "Basal mitotic timing was longer and more heterogeneous in RZZ-deficient cells ( Fig.   2A ), suggesting a delay in bipolar attachment and SAC satisfaction. Consistently, KNTC1-null cells rapidly exited mitosis when the SAC kinase Mps1 was inhibited with reversine ( Fig. 2A) . To monitor mitotic chromosome dynamics and SAC signaling, we expressed and imaged H2B-mCherry and FLAP-Mad1 using spinning disk confocal microscopy. At NEBD Mad1 immediately localized at nascent kinetochores, then dissociated as chromosomes congressed at the metaphase plate ( Fig. 2B ; n=10 cells). Congression was less efficient in KNTC-null cells, consistent with the lack of Spindly and dynein at kinetochores ( [17] and Fig. S2 ), with small numbers of Mad1positive chromosomes temporarily at the spindle poles ( Fig. 2C; n=14 cells) . We conclude that RZZ accelerates (but is not strictly required for) chromosome biorientation.\n\nNext we examined Mad1 dynamics in nocodazole-treated cells. Although Mad1 was again targeted to kinetochores at NEBD, without RZZ its localization could not be maintained (Fig. 2D ). To confirm this result for endogenous Mad1, wildtype and KNTC1 -/-RPE cells were treated with nocodazole and MG132 (to block mitotic exit) for 30 min or 4 hours, then fixed and analyzed by IFM. In wildtype cells Mad1 formed crescent-shaped structures that were stable over time (Fig. 2E, left panel) . By contrast, in KNTC1-null cells Mad1 formed small dots that later disappeared from kinetochores \n\nAll rights reserved.

Kinetochore expansion is thought to accelerate mitotic 'search and capture' by promoting lateral microtubule attachment [10] and to enhance SAC signaling [11] . RZZ is closely related to endomembrane coatomers that form oligomeric lattices [18, 19] and has been suggested as a \"building block\" of the corona itself [17, 20] . Consistently two other corona-associated proteins (CENP-E [21] and CENP-F [22] ) also failed to form crescents in KNTC1 -/cells (Fig. 3A) . To obtain definitive evidence, we performed correlative light-electron microscopy in cells that also express CENP-A-GFP as a centromere marker. Serial sectioning revealed circumferential expansion of trilaminar plates and fibrous material in wildtype cells (n=14 kinetochores), whereas the kinetochores of KNTC1 -/cells appeared as compact discs (n=15; Fig. 3B and Fig. S3 ).\n\nKinetochore crescents disassembled when Mps1 was inhibited (Fig. 3C ). We identified two Mps1 phosphorylation sites at the N-terminus of Rod (T13 and S15), upstream of its beta-propeller domain [23] . To test their function, wildtype (WT) and nonphosphorylatable (2A) Rod were expressed in T-Rex FLP-in HeLa cells as LAP (EGFP-TEV-S-peptide) fusions (Fig. S4A ). Both versions were incorporated into RZZ based on co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. S4B) . Thereafter we introduced a KNTC1-specific guide RNA (sgKNTC1) via lentiviral transduction and triggered gene disruption using a Cas9-expressing adenovirus (AdCas9). Endogenous Rod was removed from kinetochores in 75% of cells (Fig. S4C) . We then analyzed transgene-All rights reserved.

While LAP-Rod WT and LAP-Rod 2A both localized to unattached kinetochores, only LAP-Rod WT formed crescents (Fig. 3D) . Thus far the only post-translational modification known to be required for crescent formation is Cterminal farnesylation of Spindly, which enables its kinetochore recruitment via interaction with Rod's beta-propeller domain [17, 20, 24] . In contrast Rod 2A recruited Spindly normally (Fig. 3E) . Despite recruiting less Mad1 to kinetochores, Rod 2A sustained mitotic arrest in nocodazole as effectively as Rod WT (Fig. 3F ). We conclude that Rod's N-terminal phosphorylation activates Spindly-RZZ for kinetochore expansion but is not necessary for RZZ-mediated SAC transduction.\n\nBub1 promotes kinetochore expansion in Xenopus egg extracts [11] but has not been evaluated in human cells. We used doxycycline-inducible CRISPR [25] to delete BUB1 in RPE cells with 60% efficiency as judged by IFM, with 42% of cells exiting nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest in less than 800 min ( Fig. S4D-E) . Large kinetochore crescents containing RZZ, Mad1, and CENP-E (but lacking CENP-F) formed in BUB1 -/cells ( Fig S4D) . We conclude that Bub1 is not required for RZZ-mediated kinetochore expansion or Mad1-Mad2 recruitment, but is needed to localize CENP-F and potentially other corona-associated proteins.\n\nSAC failure in RZZ-null cells correlates with Mad1-Mad2 loss from kinetochores (Fig. 2 ).\n\nHowever this did not exclude the possibility that RZZ has other essential roles in SAC All rights reserved.

To address this issue we expressed mCherry-Mis12-Mad1 [26, 27] from a doxycycline-inducible promoter in cells undergoing acute deletion of KNTC1 (Fig. 4A) , so that Mad1-Mad2 was tethered to kinetochores in an RZZ-independent manner (Fig. 4B ). This caused a longer arrest in KNTC1-null cells (1138 \u00b1 428 min) than wildtype cells (791 \u00b1 285 min; Fig. 4C ), potentially due to the lack of dynein-mediated stripping of SAC mediators from metaphase kinetochores [28] [29] [30] . To eliminate this effect and evaluate the SAC response to unattached kinetochores, we repeated these experiments in the presence of nocodazole and found no significant difference between KNTC1-null and wildtype cells (Fig. 4C) . Thus, Mad1-Mad2 tethering is sufficient to explain how RZZ extends the timeframe of SAC surveillance and mitotic arrest by a factor of 10.\n\nNPC-bound Mad1-Mad2 generates MCC during interphase, thereby increasing the SAC's sensitivity and robustness [3] . This contribution was revealed when cells bearing an NPC-defective Mad1 allele were treated with Aurora B inhibitors, which delay kinetochore recruitment of Mad1 relative to NEBD [31, 32] . Under these conditions, cells entered mitosis without premade MCC and could not generate it quickly enough at kinetochores to prevent mitotic exit [3] . Because RZZ-deficient cells initiate but do not maintain the SAC, we anticipated a similar synthetic interaction with Aurora B inhibition.\n\nTo test this idea, RPE cells co-expressing FLAP-Mad1 and mRuby-CENP-A were All rights reserved.

Hesperadin slowed but did not prevent Mad1 recruitment to unattached kinetochores in wildtype cells (Fig. 4D -E) and did not override nocodazoleinduced SAC arrest [3, 31, 33] . In contrast hesperadin blocked Mad1 targeting to kinetochores in KNTC1-null cells (Fig. 4D -E) and decreased mitotic arrest from 110 \u00b1 20 min to 39 \u00b1 10 min (Fig. 4F ). As the latter corresponds to the basal length of mitosis in RPE cells ( Fig. 2A) , these data imply combined loss of SAC initiation and maintenance at kinetochores, while pre-programmed anaphase delay via nuclear pore-generated MCC remains intact.\n\nThe RZZ complex is conserved in metazoans and other taxa [18, 35, 36] , but its roles in SAC signaling and kinetochore organization remain poorly understood. Our studies define RZZ as a critical SAC maintenance factor, the major Mad1-Mad2 tether at kinetochores, and a key mediator of phosphodependent kinetochore expansion.\n\nGenetic loss of RZZ was tolerated in three different cell lines that vary in tumorigenicity, p53 proficiency, and karyotypic stability. In this regard RZZ differs from core SAC components like Mad1, Mad2, Bub1, BubR1, and Mps1 that are essential for organismal and (with rare exceptions [9, 37, 38] ) somatic cell viability in mammals [3, 34, [39] [40] [41] [42] . It was recently proposed that RZZ and Bub1 both transduce the SAC at unattached kinetochores, whereas only Bub1 monitors improper kinetochore-All rights reserved.

However KNTC1-null RPE cells exhibited severe SAC failure when kinetochore attachments were ablated with nocodazole or when STLC or taxol were used to induce erroneous attachments (Fig. 1D ). We conclude that RZZ is required for SAC transduction in both settings.\n\nThrough live imaging, we obtained evidence that human kinetochores recruit Mad1-Mad2 and transduce the SAC in two distinct steps. The first occurs at NEBD, when Mad1-Mad2 released from nuclear pores is targeted to newly assembled kinetochores by Aurora B [3, 31, 43] . In the second step, Mad1-Mad2 becomes stably tethered to kinetochores by RZZ, extending SAC surveillance and mitotic arrest more than 10-fold.\n\nWhen both steps are abrogated, cells neither initiate nor maintain the SAC and thus exit mitosis with kinetics set by nuclear pore-derived MCC [3] .\n\nCompelling evidence indicates that Bub1 is the kinetochore receptor for Mad1-Mad2 in yeast and nematodes [44, 45] . In contrast, studies in mammalian cells differ as to (1) whether Bub1 recruits Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores and (2) whether and how Bub1 contributes to SAC arrest [4-7, 9, 41] . Recently several groups reported that the SAC in human cells is refractory not only to Bub1 depletion [4, 6] but also stable disruption of the BUB1 locus [9, 46] unless Mps1 is partially inhibited to sensitize the system [9, 47] .\n\nIn our studies, acute deletion of BUB1 induced highly penetrant SAC failure without perturbing the kinetochore localization of RZZ and Mad1-Mad2 ( Fig. S4D-E) . These findings suggest that Bub1 supports SAC transduction by accelerating step(s) in MCC All rights reserved.

Transgenic expression of LAP-Rod 2A and mCherry-Mis12-Mad1 rescued nocodazole-induced SAC arrest but not kinetochore expansion in KNTC1-null cells, implying that the latter is not rate limiting for SAC transduction. This inference is supported by the fact that mitotic arrest following Eg5 inhibition (which generates compact kinetochores with syntelic attachments [50] ) is also RZZ-dependent ( Fig. 1B and 1D ).\n\nAlthough kinetochore expansion is known to depend on mitotic kinases like Mps1 [11] , relevant substrates are not known. We found that Mps1 promotes expansion by phosphorylating Rod on two N-terminal residues upstream of its beta-propeller domain.\n\nRecent studies indicate that Rod and Spindly not only interact via this domain [17, 20] but also inhibit their own self-assembly into polymers [51, 52] . In light of these findings and the fact that Mps1 maximally phosphorylates Rod at unattached kinetochores [23] , we propose that this modification overcomes the barrier to Spindly-RZZ polymerization and kinetochore expansion. Thereafter end-on microtubule attachments reverse this phosphorylation, in part through counteracting PP2A-B56 phosphatases [23] , thus reinhibiting Spindly-RZZ and facilitating kinetochore compaction. In summary, we have identified a key trigger for dynamic kinetochore expansion that involves SAC-All rights reserved.
