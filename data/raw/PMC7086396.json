{"title": "Total Chemical Synthesis of ISGylated-Ubiquitin Hybrid\nChain Assisted by Acetamidomethyl Derivatives with Dual Functions", "body": "Ubiquitin (Ub) is a\n76 amino acid protein involved in many cellular\nevents, e.g., trafficking, transcription, and proteasome degradation.1,2 The covalent attachment of Ub to a Lys residue of a target protein\nrequires three enzymes, E1, E2, and E3, and is known as ubiquitination.3 Repeating this cycle on an ubiquitinated protein\nproduces multiubiquitination either on different Lys residues or on\nthe same site, eventually leading to different cellular signals.4,5 On the other hand, ubiquitin-like modifiers (Ubls) are a family\nof proteins similar in structure to Ub, yet different in sequence.\nThis family includes SUMO 1/2/3/4 (small ubiquitin-like modifier),\nNEDD8 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated\nprotein 8), and ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15).6 ISG15 has a similar structure to di-Ub, with two domains\nconnected by a short linker.7 Additionally,\nthe covalent attachment of ISG15 to a Lys residue of proteins (ISGylation)\ndemands its own set of three enzymes E1, E2, and E3.8,9\n\nISGylation is considered an essential element for neutralizing\ninfections by numerous pathogens including influenza and coronavirus.8,10,11 Moreover, ISGylation is involved\nin various other cellular functions including inhibiting proteasome-mediated\ndegradation and protein translation; it controls actin cytoskeleton\ndynamics and is involved in translesion DNA synthesis.12 Subsequently, researchers are interested in\nstudying ISG15 to acquire deeper insight on the ISG15 role in numerous\ncellular processes. For instance, what is the fate of ISGylated protein\ncompared to diubiquitinated proteins? And the effect of protein ISGylation\non protein stability is unknown. Specifically, the role of ISGylated\nproteins and ISG15 in cancer development is also not yet understood.\n\nRecently, a hybrid chain between Ub and ISG15 was discovered, where\nUb was found to be a substrate for ISG15, which can be ISGylated at\ntwo sites, Lys29 and Lys48.13 Furthermore,\nthe study found that Lys29 was the major site for ISGylation, and\nthis surprising interplay between the two post translational modifications\n(PTMs) can play a role in regulating the turnover of ubiquitinated\nproteins. However, the crosstalk between these two similar but distinct\nPTMs is yet to be investigated.\n\nSince it is hard to isolate\na specific type of this hybrid chain\nin sufficient quantities from the heterogeneous pool of ISGylated-Ub\nchains, there is demand for producing sufficient homogeneous quantities\nof ISG15 and ISG15-Ub hybrid chains. To our best knowledge, there\nare no reports for the chemical synthesis or semisynthesis of ISG15-Ub\nhybrid chains. Producing ISG15 has been done only by expression,14,15 which also turned out to be challenging especially in handling the\nprotein where mutations had to be introduced to enable their expression\nand perform biological studies with the protein.7\n\nHerein, we describe our route toward the chemical\nsynthesis of\nISG15-Ub hybrid chains. Despite the structural similarities of ISG15\nto Ub, the synthesis proved to be extremely challenging. Our initial\nefforts toward the synthesis of the target protein were hampered by\nits hydrophobic nature and high tendency for aggregation. These factors\nheavily affected SPPS leading to deletions and eventually complete\ntermination of the growing peptide chain. In order to overcome all\nthe synthetic difficulties, state of the art chemical methods and\nstrategies have been employed.16 A key\nto our success was the development and application of a new Acm derivative\nto serve for cysteine protection and increase the peptide solubility.\n\nWe envisioned the total chemical synthesis\nof the ISG15-Lys29-Ub\nprotein equipped with a biotin tag, providing a useful tool for further\nstudies. After analyzing the sequence of ISG15, made of 157 residues,\nwe initially decided to divide it into three shorter peptide fragments,\nwhich can be prepared by Fmoc-SPPS. The synthesis of the second and\nthird fragments (ISG15(29\u201359) and ISG15(60\u2013165), Figures S1 and S4) proceeded without complications.\nWe did not encounter problems in the synthesis or in the following\npurification step. Contrary to this, in the synthesis of the first\nfragment, ISG15(2\u201328), we found that after coupling the first\n14 amino acids, the fragment was poorly soluble and the HPLC showed\nbroad, tailing peaks, without a major peak that corresponded to the\nproduct. On the basis of our previous experiences in the synthesis\nof difficult proteins, installing a side chain solubilizing tag (e.g.,\nattached through a phenylacetamidomethyl (Phacm) linker to a Cys residue)\ncould significantly improve protein synthesis.17\u221219 Upon introduction\nof this solubilizing tag onto the temporary Ala11Cys mutation, we\nwere glad to see that the synthesis of this fragment has improved,\nbut to our disappointment, we found that this fragment (even with\nthe solubilizing tag) was tailing in the column, rendering its separation\nand purification very challenging and its final isolation in a very\nlow yield.\n\nTo overcome this issue, we thought to introduce a\nsecond solubilizing\ntag to further improve the solubility and reduce the tailing effect.\nHowever, since there are no additional positions suitable for its\ninstallation, we combined the first and second fragments and introduced\na second solubilizing tag at the Ala40Cys temporary mutation site.\nThe second solubilizing tag somewhat improved the purification step,\nbut the SPPS itself still suffered from deletion and termination of\nthe growing peptide chain possibly due to aggregation on the polymer\nsupport (Figure S2), eventually leading\nto low yielding synthesis. Unfortunately, this issue cannot be strategically\naddressed as the beneficial effect of the used solubilizing tags materializes\nafter the SPPS is completed but not during synthesis. This encouraged\nus to design a new solubilizing tag, which upon its installation would\nhave an immediate effect on the solubility of the hydrophobic fragment,\nleading to a better tracking of the different coupling steps.\n\nWe designed a novel solubilizing-protecting group based on the\nwidely used Acm group (Scheme 1A) modified with dimethylated amine moiety (Acm-NMe2). The positively charged tertiary amino groups can simultaneously\nimprove SPPS by lowering the tendency for aggregation on solid support\nand later in solution phase as well. Furthermore, it can positively\ncontribute to the solubility of the peptide fragments and the later\nintermediates along the synthesis. The major advantage of this novel\nprotecting group, compared to the previously reported side chain solubilizing\ngroups,20 is the immediate observed positive\neffect on the SPPS upon incorporation. Furthermore, the side chain\ndeprotection and coupling steps of the Arg tag can be avoided. Finally,\nthe Acm-NMe2 group is less sterically hindered than the\nPhacm based solubilizing tag; thus the subsequent coupling cycles\nare expected to be more efficient.\n\nWe based the synthesis of the Fmoc-Cys(Acm-NMe2)-OH\nbuilding block on the inexpensive chloroacetamide that was reacted\nin the first step with dimethylamine and subsequently in the next\nstep with formaldehyde, to provide the key intermediate 1 (Scheme 1B). This\nwas attached to l-Cys analogously to the standard Acm protecting\ngroup as in the first reported synthesis.21 Finally, the Fmoc protecting group was installed, which gave upon\npurification the Fmoc-Cys(Acm-NMe2)-OH 2 (Scheme 1B), in four steps\nwith 59% overall yield (Scheme 1B).\n\nWith the newly developed Cys building block in hand\nwe decided\nto assemble the ISG15 from two peptide segments obtained by Fmoc-SPPS\nemploying NCL and ligate eventually the full length ISG15 onto the\nside chain of Lys29 of the Ub via a second NCL, utilizing the \u03b4-mercaptolysine\nmoiety (Figure 1).22 In order to address the extreme hydrophobicity\nof the N-terminal region of the ISG15, we decided to incorporate two\nCys residues (both equipped with Acm-NMe2 groups) instead\nof Ala11 and Ala41. These can be converted back to the native Ala\nresidue upon palladium mediated deprotection and subsequent desulfurization.23,24 The ISG15(61\u2013157) 2 (Figure 2A) could be prepared by standard Fmoc-SPPS\nwithout any major difficulty (Figure S4).\n\nExamining the reported cases for the expression of ISG15, it is\nestablished that Cys78 significantly contributes to the precipitation\nof the full ISG15 protein.7,25 Subsequently, we decided\nto introduce the Cys78Ser mutation in order to avoid the formation\nof the dimer form of the protein. This mutation is located in the\nloop region, connecting the two Ub like domains of ISG15; thus no\nimpact on the biological activity is anticipated. The \u03b4-mercaptolysine\ncontaining Ub was prepared according the previously reported procedures.26\n\nThe incorporation of the new solubilizing\ntags enabled the synthesis\nof the challenging ISG15(2\u201360) 3 (Figure 2A, Figure S3) on multimilligram scale. The peptide was synthesized on\nhydrazide substituted Trt resin, and after resin cleavage the crude\npeptide was subsequently converted with 4-mercaptomethylacetic acid\n(MPAA) to the corresponding thioester according to a modified variant\nof the recently reported conditions by the Dawson group.27 The second fragment of ISG15, 4 (Figure 2A), could\nbe prepared without any synthetic difficulty bearing C-terminal hydrazide,\nusing HCTU/HATU coupling reagents in NMP.28\n\nWith sufficient amounts of the ISG15 fragments in hand, we\nproceeded\nto the first ligation (Figure 2A). During our initial trials, we observed that despite using\nstandard 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (Gn\u00b7HCl) buffer (pH 7.2)\nwith tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP\u00b7HCl)\nand MPAA, the peptide fragments and the ligated product were very\nprone to aggregation and gel formation. This led to slow reaction\ntime and to inhomogeneous concentration of the reactants in the ligation\nmixture. We found that lowering the protein concentration to 1.7 mM\nand adding boric acid (25 mM) significantly improved the solubility\nand minimized the gel formation. Unfortunately, the ligated protein,\nISG15(2\u2013157) 5a (Figure 2A), eluted at the same retention time as\nfragment 4. In order to ensure full conversion, we used\na substoichiometric amount of cysteine-fragment 4 and\nleft the ligation to proceed overnight at 42 \u00b0C. After no more\ncysteine-fragment 4 could be observed by ESI-MS, the\nligated protein ISG15(2\u2013157) 5a, with C-terminal\nhydrazide, was in situ transformed to the MPAA thioester by the addition\nof acetyl acetone (acac), TCEP\u00b7HCl, and MPAA, containing Gn\u00b7HCl\nbuffer (pH 3), and overnight incubation at room temperature.27 The full length ISG15 thioester protein 5b (Figure 2A) was purified on semipreparative HPLC and gave the purified product\nin 28% isolated yield for one-pot NCL and thioester conversion.\n\nWith the ISG15 thioester 5b in hand we proceeded to\nligate it onto the Ub variant bearing \u03b4-mercaptolysine (Lys29),\nand equipped with a biotin tag at it is the N-terminus, 6 (Figure 2A). In our\npreliminary study, we observed extremely poor recovery from HPLC and\nvery low solubility even in 6 M Gn\u00b7HCl buffer of the final, 231\namino acid long ISG15-Ub protein. Thus, we decided to incorporate\nfurther charged residues (6 Arg moieties) between the N-terminus of\nthe Ub protein and the biotin tag. The ligation between the ISG15\nthioester, 5b, and the Ub, 6, was completed\nafter 5 h. Despite the good conversion of the protein fragments to\nthe ligated product, according the analytical HPLC, the full-length\nprotein 7 (Figure 2A) could be isolated only with 27% yield. We reasoned that\nthe moderate yield could be attributed to significant losses during\npurification, due to the hydrophobic nature of the protein which leads\nto tailing and sticking in the column resulting in the loss of material.\n\nNext, we proceeded to remove the Acm-NMe2 protecting\ngroups from the ISGylated Ub and transform the Cys residues to the\nnative alanine moieties by radical desulfurization in a one pot manner.\nThe removal of the Acm-NMe2 solubilizing groups drastically\nworsened the solubility properties of the protein and increased its\nhydrophobicity. The product could only be isolated on an analytical\nHPLC instrument using a heated C4 column. After the deprotection of\nthe Cys residues and the desulfurization steps, all our efforts to\nobtain ESI-MS spectra failed. Similar phenomena were reported in cases\nof some highly hydrophobic proteins.29,30\n\nThe\nisolated final protein was analyzed on SDS\u2013PAGE with\nthe Ub fragment, 6, and the full ISG15-thioester, 5b (Figure 2F). The SDS gel showed that the isolated final protein has a mass\nthat ranged between 25 and 35 kDa, which corresponds to our final\nISG15-Ub hybrid chain molecular weight. Moreover, we did not identify\nany band that corresponds to the presence of the Ub or ISG15 fragments\nalong with the isolated final protein. Consequently, we performed\nWestern blotting against both anti-Ub and anti-ISG15 antibody to further\nprovide evidence for the purity of the final protein and show the\nrecognition of antibodies toward our synthesized ISG15-Lys29-Ub hybrid\nchain (Figure S8).\n\nIn order to prove\nthe identity of the final protein, we performed\nsequence analysis by tryptic digestion and LC\u2013MS/MS analysis\nof the digested fragments (Figure 3). This procedure gave 81.51% coverage of the full\nprotein. The purity of the protein was confirmed by analytical HPLC\n(Figure 2E)).\n\nWith the full-length ISGylated Ub in hand, we proceeded to the\nfolding step. First, the folding precursor was dissolved in 6 M Gn\u00b7HCl\nbuffer (typically 0.1 mg in 2 \u03bcL of buffer) at pH 6.2 and kept\nat 37 \u00b0C for 1 h in order to fully denature the protein. The\nfolding experiments were performed using rapid dilution as well as\nslow dialysis. Several buffers were tested (phosphate buffers with\nvarious additives, at different pH values), but the ISGylated Ub rapidly\nprecipitated from all the buffers (Supporting Information). Subsequently, we found that 40 v/v % glycerol\nis necessary to stabilize the protein in solution. Furthermore, the\naddition of boric acid and low amount of Gn\u00b7HCl into the folding\nbuffer is also required to minimize the protein\u2019s tendency\nfor aggregation. Finally, the protein was folded in 25 mM boric acid\nbuffer with 0.6 M Gn\u00b7HCl at pH 6.2 containing 40 v/v % glycerol\nat 0 \u00b0C for 30 min. Despite all the additives, some precipitation\nwas observed. This was separated by centrifugation. The CD spectra\nwere recorded from the folding buffer. To our best knowledge no CD\nspectra of ISGylated Ub have been reported yet. Expressed ISG15 (Cys78Ser)\nwas characterized by CD to show one distinct minimum at 208 nm, similar\nto our recorded spectra (Figure 2 G).7\n\nIn\nthis study, we described the first, total chemical synthesis\nof ISG15-Lys29-Ub hybrid chain. During the attempted synthesis we\nencountered major handling and purification problems. The key to successfully\novercome these challenges was the development and incorporation of\nour novel Acm based solubilizing-protecting group (Acm-NMe2). This synthetic handle aided the SPPS, the assembly of the peptide\nfragments, and the HPLC purification steps along the protein synthesis.\nThe final ISG15-Lys29-Ub hybrid chain was characterized by trypsin\ndigestion, SDS\u2013gel, and Western blotting, and then the CD measurement\nof the folded native hybrid chain was obtained. The current study\nand our new Acm solubilizing tag establish a straightforward platform\nfor generating a range of ISGylated Ub variants and open new horizons\nfor studying the role of the hybrid chains. Moreover, the characterization,\nfolding, and synthetic lessons learned here could assist in the synthesis\nof other challenging proteins."}
