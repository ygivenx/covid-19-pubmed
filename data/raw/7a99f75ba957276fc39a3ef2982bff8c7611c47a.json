It is based on the metric system, with each unit being approximately 0.33 mm, with a difference of 0.33 mm in diameter between consecutive sizes. Example: 27F indicates a diameter of 9 mm; 30F, a diameter of 10 mm. A convenient conversion table from the French scale to the English and American scales that is sometimes used for certain instruments is given below. \n\nThe fact that the canine and feline criteria recommend triennial vaccination for certain vaccines in no way stipulates that adult dogs and cats should only be vaccinated every 3 years. In fact, annual vaccination does represent a high standard of medical care, as long as the vaccination appointment incorporates a thorough health/wellness examination. Considering the large population of pet dogs and cats and the remarkable spectrum of risk factors for exposure to infectious pathogens, it is quite unreasonable to assume that a single vaccination protocol would be applicable in all patients seen in practice. Two of the most important variables to consider when assessing risk are the age of the patient and the patient's \"lifestyle.\" In implementing a vaccination protocol in clinical practice, it is critical that the clinician consider these factors when recommending core, or non-core, vaccines for an individual patient.\n\nThe following tables exemplify annualized vaccination protocols for dogs and cats at moderate risk (applies to most), high risk, and low risk of exposure to infectious agents while also taking into consideration the recommendations set forth in the canine and feline criteria. \u2022 Dog is ever boarded in a commercial kennel, or \u2022 Dog requires occasional grooming, or \u2022 Dog regularly has supervised walks/runs outside with likelihood of contact with other dogs.\n\n\u2022 NOTE: Parainfluenza vaccine is combined with all intranasal B. bronchiseptica vaccines.\n\n\u2022 The dog is 12 weeks of age or older, and \u2022 Dog has opportunities for unsupervised outdoor activities, or \u2022 Cases of leptospirosis are known to have been confirmed in the area, or \u2022 Dog has access (supervised or otherwise) to areas inhabited by \"reservoir\" hosts (eg: opossum, skunk, raccoon, vole) or other domestic animals such as cattle or pigs (horses).\n\n\u2022 NOTE: risk of exposure is not limited to rural areas.\n\n\u2022 Dog will travel to known endemic areas (Northeastern US or upper Midwest) and will spend time outside, or \u2022 Lyme borreliosis cases have been diagnosed (via IDEXX Snap 3Dx or Western Blot analysis) in the community, or \u2022 Dog is not receiving any form of topical tick preventative (eg, fipronil). *For any vaccine preceded by \"+,\" see defining criteria. \u2020 In some states or municipalities, annual rabies vaccination may be required. \u2021 All intranasal B. bronchiseptica vaccines also contain parainfluenza virus; some also contain canine adenovirus-2.

This document is reviewed annually and revised as necessary. Principles of rabies prevention and control are detailed in Part I; Part II contains recommendations for parenteral vaccination procedures. All animal rabies vaccines licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and marketed in the United States are listed in Part III.\n\nA. Principles of rabies prevention and control 1. Rabies exposure. Rabies is transmitted only when the virus is introduced into bite wounds, open cuts in skin, or onto mucous membranes from saliva or other potentially infectious material such as neural tissue. 2 Questions about possible exposures should be directed to state or local health authorities. 2. Human rabies prevention. Rabies in humans can be prevented either by eliminating exposures to rabid animals or by providing exposed persons with prompt local treatment of wounds combined with the administration of human rabies immune globulin and vaccine. The rationale for recommending preexposure and postexposure rabies prophylaxis and details of their administration can be found in the current recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). 2 These recommendations, along with information concerning the current local and regional epidemiology of animal rabies and the availability of human rabies biologics, are available from state health departments. 3. Domestic animals. Local governments should initiate and maintain effective programs to ensure vaccination of all dogs, cats, and ferrets and to remove strays and unwanted animals. Such procedures in the United States have reduced laboratory-confirmed cases of rabies in dogs from 6949 in 1947 to 117 in 2003. 3 Because more rabies cases are reported annually involving cats (321 in 2003) than dogs, vaccination of cats should be required. Animal shelters and animal control authorities should establish policies to ensure that adopted animals are vaccinated against rabies. The recommended vaccination procedures and the licensed animal vaccines are specified in Parts II and III of the compendium. 4. Rabies in vaccinated animals. Rabies is rare in vaccinated animals. 4 If such an event is suspected, it should be reported to state public health officials; the vaccine manufacturer; and USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Center for Veterinary Biologics (Internet: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/cvb/ic/adverseeventreport.htm, telephone: 800-752-6255, or e-mail: CVB@usda.gov). The laboratory diagnosis should be confirmed and the virus characterized by a rabies reference laboratory. A thorough epidemiologic investigation should be conducted. 5. Rabies in wildlife. The control of rabies among wildlife reservoirs is difficult. 5 Vaccination of free-ranging wildlife or selective population reduction might be useful in some situations, but the success of such procedures depends on the circumstances surrounding each rabies outbreak (see Part I. C. Control Methods in Wildlife). Because of the risk of rabies in wild animals (especially raccoons, skunks, coyotes, foxes, and bats), AVMA, NASPHV, and CSTE strongly recommend the enactment and enforcement of state laws prohibiting their importation, distribution, and relocation. 6. Rabies surveillance. Laboratory-based rabies surveillance is an essential component of rabies control and prevention programs. Accurate and timely information is necessary to guide human postexposure prophylaxis decisions, determine the management of potentially exposed animals, aid in emerging pathogen discovery, describe the epidemiology of the disease, and assess the need for and effectiveness of oral vaccination programs for wildlife. Rabies diagnosis. Rabies testing should be performed by a qualified laboratory that has been designated by the local or state health department 6 in accordance with the established national standardized protocol for rabies testing (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies/ Professional/publications/DFA_diagnosis/DFA_protocol-b.htm). Euthanasia 7 should be accomplished in such a way as to maintain the integrity of the brain so that the laboratory can recognize the anatomic parts. Except in the case of very small animals, such as bats, only the head or brain (including brainstem) should be submitted to the laboratory. Any animal or animal specimen being submitted for testing should be kept under refrigeration (not frozen or chemically fixed) during storage and shipping. 8. Rabies serology. Some \"rabies-free\" jurisdictions may require evidence of vaccination and rabies antibodies for importation purposes. Rabies antibody titers are indicative of an animal's response to vaccine or infection. Titers do not directly correlate with protection because other immunologic factors also play a role in preventing rabies, and our abilities to measure and interpret those other factors are not well developed. Therefore, evidence of circulating rabies virus antibodies should not be used as a substitute for current vaccination in managing rabies exposures or determining the need for booster vaccinations in animals. 8 \n\nParenteral animal rabies vaccines should be administered only by or under the direct supervision of a veterinarian. Rabies vaccinations may also be administered under the supervision of a veterinarian to animals held in animal control shelters prior to release. Any veterinarian signing a rabies certificate must ensure that the person administering vaccine is identified on the certificate and is appropriately trained in vaccine storage, handling, and administration and in the management of adverse events. This practice ensures that a qualified and responsible person can be held accountable to ensure that the animal has been properly vaccinated. Within 28 days after primary vaccination, a peak rabies antibody titer is reached and the animal can be considered immunized. An animal is currently vaccinated and is considered immunized if the primary vaccination was administered at least 28 days previously and vaccinations have been administered in accordance with this compendium.\n\nRegardless of the age of the animal at initial vaccination, a booster vaccination should be administered 1 year later (see Parts II and III for vaccines and procedures). No laboratory or epidemiologic data exist to support the annual or biennial administration of 3-year vaccines following the initial series. Because a rapid anamnestic response is expected, an animal is considered currently vaccinated immediately after a booster vaccination. a. Dogs, cats, and ferrets. All dogs, cats, and ferrets should be vaccinated against rabies and revaccinated in accordance with Part III of this compendium. If a previously vaccinated animal is overdue for a booster, it should be revaccinated. Immediately following the booster, the animal is considered currently vaccinated and should be placed on an annual or triennial schedule depending on the type of vaccine used. b. Livestock. Consideration should be given to vaccinating livestock that are particularly valuable or that might have frequent contact with humans (e.g., in petting zoos, fairs, and other public exhibitions). 9,10 Horses traveling interstate should be currently vaccinated against rabies. c. Confined animals. 1) Wild. No parenteral rabies vaccines are licensed for use in wild animals or hybrids (the offspring of wild animals crossbred to domestic animals). Wild animals or hybrids should not be kept as pets. [11] [12] [13] [14] \n\n2) Maintained in exhibits and in zoological parks. Captive mammals that are not completely excluded from all contact with rabies vectors can become infected. Moreover, wild animals might be incubating rabies when initially captured; therefore, wild-caught animals susceptible to rabies should be quarantined for a minimum of 6 months before being exhibited. Employees who work with animals at such facilities should receive preexposure rabies vaccination. The use of pre-or postexposure rabies vaccinations for employees who work with animals at such facilities might reduce the need for euthanasia of captive animals. Carnivores and bats should be housed in a manner that precludes direct contact with the public. 3) Stray animals. Stray dogs, cats, and ferrets should be removed from the community.\n\nLocal health departments and animal control officials can enforce the removal of strays more effectively if owned animals have identification and are confined or kept on leash. Strays should be impounded for at least 3 business days to determine if human exposure has occurred and to give owners sufficient time to reclaim animals. When an interstate health certificate or certificate of veterinary inspection is required, it should contain the same rabies vaccination information as Form 51. c. Areas with dog-to-dog rabies transmission. The movement of dogs from areas with dog-to-dog rabies transmission for the purpose of adoption or sale should be eliminated. Rabid dogs have been introduced into the United States from areas with dog-to-dog rabies transmission. 15, 16 This practice poses the risk of introducing caninetransmitted rabies to areas where it does not currently exist. 3. Adjunct procedures. Methods or procedures which enhance rabies control include the following: a. Identification. Dogs, cats, and ferrets should be identified (e.g., metal or plastic tags or microchips) to allow for verification of rabies vaccination status. b. Licensure. Registration or licensure of all dogs, cats, and ferrets may be used to aid in rabies control. A fee is frequently charged for such licensure, and revenues collected are used to maintain rabies-or animal-control programs. Evidence of current vaccination is an essential prerequisite to licensure.\n\nc. Canvassing. House-to-house canvassing by animal control officials facilitates enforcement of vaccination and licensure requirements. d. Citations. Citations are legal summonses issued to owners for violations, including the failure to vaccinate or license their animals. The authority for officers to issue citations should be an integral part of each animal-control program. e. Animal control. All communities should incorporate stray animal control, leash laws, and training of personnel in their programs. 4. Postexposure management. Any animal potentially exposed to rabies virus (see Part I. A.1.\n\nRabies Exposure) by a wild, carnivorous mammal or a bat that is not available for testing should be regarded as having been exposed to rabies. a. Dogs, cats, and ferrets. Unvaccinated dogs, cats, and ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. If the owner is unwilling to have this done, the animal should be placed in strict isolation for 6 months. Rabies vaccine should be administered upon entry into isolation or 1 month prior to release to comply with preexposure vaccination recommendations (see Part I.B.1.a.). Protocols for the postexposure vaccination of previously unvaccinated domestic animals have not been validated, and evidence exists that the use of vaccine alone will not prevent the disease. 17 Animals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Dogs, cats, and ferrets that are currently vaccinated should be revaccinated immediately, kept under the owner's control, and observed for 45 days. Any illness in an isolated or confined animal should be reported immediately to the local health department. b. Livestock. All species of livestock are susceptible to rabies; cattle and horses are among the most frequently infected. Livestock exposed to a rabid animal and currently vaccinated with a vaccine approved by USDA for that species should be revaccinated immediately and observed for 45 days. Unvaccinated livestock should be slaughtered immediately. If the owner is unwilling to have this done, the animal should be kept under close observation for 6 months. Any illness in an animal under observation should be reported immediately to the local health department.\n\nThe following are recommendations for owners of livestock exposed to rabid animals: 1) If the animal is slaughtered within 7 days of being bitten, its tissues may be eaten without risk of infection, provided that liberal portions of the exposed area are discarded. Federal guidelines for meat inspectors require that any animal known to have been exposed to rabies within 8 months be rejected for slaughter. 2) Neither tissues nor milk from a rabid animal should be used for human or animal consumption. 18 Pasteurization temperatures will inactivate rabies virus; therefore, drinking pasteurized milk or eating cooked meat does not constitute a rabies exposure.\n\nHaving more than one rabid animal in a herd or having herbivore-to-herbivore transmission is uncommon; therefore, restricting the rest of the herd if a single animal has been exposed to or infected by rabies might not be necessary. c. Other animals. Other mammals bitten by a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. Animals maintained in USDA-licensed research facilities or accredited zoological parks should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\na. Dogs, cats, and ferrets. Rabies virus may be excreted in the saliva of infected dogs, cats, and ferrets during illness and/or for only a few days prior to illness or death. [19] [20] A healthy dog, cat, or ferret that bites a person should be confined and observed daily for 10 days 22 ; administration of rabies vaccine to the animal is not recommended during the observation period to avoid confusing signs of rabies with possible side effects of vaccine administration.\n\nSuch animals should be evaluated by a veterinarian at the first sign of illness during confinement. Any illness in the animal should be reported immediately to the local health department. If signs suggestive of rabies develop, the animal should be euthanized and the head shipped for testing as described in Part I.A.7. Any stray or unwanted dog, cat, or ferret that bites a person may be euthanized immediately and the head submitted for rabies examination. b. Other biting animals. Other biting animals that might have exposed a person to rabies should be reported immediately to the local health department. Management of animals other than dogs, cats, and ferrets depends on the species, the circumstances of the bite, the epidemiology of rabies in the area, and the biting animal's history, current health status, and potential for exposure to rabies. Prior vaccination of these animals may not preclude the necessity for euthanasia and testing.\n\nThe public should be warned not to handle or feed wild mammals. Wild mammals and hybrids that bite or otherwise expose persons, pets, or livestock should be considered for euthanasia and rabies examination. A person bitten by any wild mammal should immediately report the incident to a physician who can evaluate the need for antirabies treatment (see current rabies prophylaxis recommendations of the ACIP 2 ). State-regulated wildlife rehabilitators may play a role in a comprehensive rabies control program. Minimum standards for persons who rehabilitate wild mammals should include rabies vaccination, appropriate training, and continuing education. Translocation of infected wildlife has contributed to the spread of rabies 23, 24 ; therefore, the translocation of known terrestrial rabies reservoir species should be prohibited. 1. Terrestrial mammals. The use of licensed oral vaccines for the mass vaccination of freeranging wildlife should be considered in selected situations, with the approval of the state agency responsible for animal rabies control. 5 The distribution of oral rabies vaccine should be based on scientific assessments of the target species and followed by timely and appropriate analysis of surveillance data; such results should be provided to all stakeholders. In addition, parenteral vaccination (trap-vaccinate-release) of wildlife rabies reservoirs may be integrated into coordinated oral rabies vaccination programs to enhance their effectiveness. Continuous and persistent programs for trapping or poisoning wildlife are not effective in reducing wildlife rabies reservoirs on a statewide basis. However, limited population control in high-contact areas (e.g., picnic grounds, camps, suburban areas) may be indicated for the removal of selected high-risk species of wildlife. 5 State agriculture, public health, and wildlife agencies should be consulted for planning, coordination, and evaluation of vaccination or population-reduction programs.\n\ncaused rabies in at least 40 humans in the United States. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Bats should be excluded from houses, public buildings, and adjacent structures to prevent direct association with humans. 30, 31 Such structures should then be made bat-proof by sealing entrances used by bats. Controlling rabies in bats through programs designed to reduce bat populations is neither feasible nor desirable.\n\nAll animal rabies vaccines should be restricted to use by, or under the direct supervision of a veterinarian 32 except as recommended in Part I.B.1. All vaccines must be administered in accordance with the specifications of the product label or package insert.\n\nPart III lists all vaccines licensed by USDA and marketed in the United States at the time of publication. New vaccine approvals or changes in label specifications made subsequent to publication should be considered as part of this list. Any of the listed vaccines can be used for revaccination, even if the product is not the same brand previously administered. Vaccines used in state and local rabies control programs should have a 3-year duration of immunity. This constitutes the most effective method of increasing the proportion of immunized dogs and cats in any population. 33 No laboratory or epidemiologic data exist to support the annual or biennial administration of 3-year vaccines following the initial series. C. Adverse events Currently, no epidemiologic association exists between a particular licensed vaccine product and adverse events, including vaccine failure. 34 \n\nThe safety and efficacy of parenteral rabies vaccination of wildlife and hybrids have not been established, and no rabies vaccines are licensed for these animals. Parenteral vaccination (trapvaccinate-release) of wildlife rabies reservoirs may be integrated into coordinated oral rabies vaccination programs as described in Part I. C.1. to enhance their effectiveness. Zoos or research institutions may establish vaccination programs, which attempt to protect valuable animals, but these should not replace appropriate public health activities that protect humans. 9 E. Accidental human exposure to vaccine Human exposure to parenteral animal rabies vaccines listed in Part III does not constitute a risk for rabies infection. However, human exposure to vaccinia-vectored oral rabies vaccines should be reported to state health officials. 36 F. Rabies certificate All agencies and veterinarians should use NASPHV Form 51, Rabies Vaccination Certificate, which can be obtained from vaccine manufacturers or from NASPHV(http://www.nasphv.org). It is also available from CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies/professional/ professi.htm). The form must be completed in full and signed by the administering or supervising veterinarian. Computer-generated forms containing the same information are also acceptable. \n\n\u2022 Always use metric units: e.g., g (gram) for solids; ml or mL (milliliter) for liquids. \u2022 Use per instead of a slash (/), which can be interpreted as the number 1.\n\n\u2022 Use units instead of the abbreviation u, which can be interpreted as 0 or 4 or \u00b5.\n\n\u2022 Use once daily instead of sid, which has been interpreted as 5/d or 5 per day!
