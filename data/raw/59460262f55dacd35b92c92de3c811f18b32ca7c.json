{"title": "", "body": "The immune responses elicited by animal viruses are of historical interest as well as current practical importance. The science of im munology can be said to have been founded by Edward Jenner, who in his well known \"An enquiry into the causes and effects of the variolae vaccinia,\" published in 1798, described the inoculation of variolous matter into the arm of Mary Barge, who had previously had cow pox. He noted: \"It is remarkable that variolous matter, when the system is disposed to reject it, should excite inflammation more speedily than when it produces the Small Pox.\" This is the first description of delayed hypersensitivity, and reactions to vaccination and rashes produced by virus infections were taken as examples of allergic reactions by von Pirquet (1907) in his pioneering study of allergy.\n\nSince most virus infections cannot yet be treated by chemotherapy, immunoprophylaxis and isolation of cases have been the only effec tive ways to control virus diseases. The important epidemiologic consequences of the use of vaccines against smallpox, yellow fever, and poliovirus are well known, and it seems likely that vaccines against measles and rubella virus will also reduce the incidence of these diseases. In the veterinary field, vaccines against canine dis temper, canine hepatitis, hog cholera, and Newcastle disease and Marek's disease of chickens have been highly effective. Thus, the immunogenicity of animal viruses is of considerable practical impor-tance, and an enormous amount of information has accumulated on antibody formation in a wide range of animal forms inoculated with viruses or virus vaccines.\n\nAs expected, small viruses with low contents of nucleic acid and relatively simple structures have few antigens while large viruses, with greater contents of nucleic acid and complex structures, such as herpesviruses and poxviruses, have many antigens. With small viruses and viruses of intermediate size, such as adenoviruses or myxoviruses, the relationship between major antigens and the subunits assembled into intact virions is better understood. In this chapter only a few representative examples can be selected for dis cussion, to illustrate certain general principles concerning the immunogenicity of animal viruses and in what way they resemble or differ from responses to other antigens. Brief descriptions of the structures and known antigens of selected viruses will be followed by an account of the humoral and secretory responses elicited by them.\n\nUnexpected results were obtained in the course of studies of im mune responses to influenza viruses sharing some antigens but dif fering in others. It was found that following exposure to one such virus, infection by the second virus often elicited a stronger immune response against the first virus than the second. This phenomenon of \"original antigenic sin\" was one of the first examples of immunologie memory to be studied systematically, and only recently has the un derlying cellular mechanism been investigated. The problem of memory formation in T and B lymphocytes to thymus-dependent and thymus-independent antigens is currently under vigorous investiga tion and observations on the sequential responses to cross-reacting viral antigens may be pertinent to this problem. The thymus depen dence of viral antigens is also under study and results will be pre sented.\n\nThe most commonly studied immune responses to viruses are neutralizing antibodies in serum. The high sensitivity and precision of assays based on neutralization of plaque-forming viruses make this an excellent model system, and much information of general interest has emerged from its use. Neutralization itself has proved to be a complex phenomenon which is not yet fully understood. Among the features that have been studied and will be described are the sequence of appearance and neutralizing capacity of different classes of immunoglobulins, the avidity of antibodies, the additional effects of complement components, and the existence of infectious com plexes of viruses and antibody.\n\nMacrophages are implicated at many points in immune responses, especially in antigen processing and presentation and possibly in B and T lymphocyte interactions. They can interact directly with viruses and microorganisms and can mediate cytotoxic reactions against tumor cells and cells infected with viruses or intracellular parasites. The capacity of macrophages to support virus replication and thus spread infection, or to degrade virus and aid in recovery from infection will be discussed. The ontogeny of this virucidal capacity will be reviewed with emphasis on the influence of the thymus, either hormonally or through T lymphocytes and their prod ucts.\n\nThe interaction of sensitized lymphocytes with infected cells requires cell surface changes recognizable by the lymphocytes. Virus-induced surface changes have been described during infection for most viruses studied. Some of these represent new proteins or glycoproteins encoded in the virus genome, while others result from rearrangement of host material or derepression of host genes. The appearance of \" n e w \" host antigens or receptors (including Fc re ceptors) and the diminution of normally present antigens (including histocompatibility antigens) have been reported. Antigenic modula tion, capping, and other phenomena previously described for nonviral cell surface antigens are also found with viral antigens and will be described.\n\nDelayed hypersensitivity has been observed in many virus infec tions, and more recently in vitro studies have confirmed the exis tence of cell-mediated immune responses to viral antigens. These were regarded as little more than curiosities until children born with selective deficiencies of T cell function were found to be unduly sus ceptible to vaccinia virus, herpesviruses, and measles virus infec tions, while children with severe hypogammaglobulinemia generally are not. Observations of experimental animals confirm this impor tance of cell-mediated immunity in protection against certain virus infections but not others (reviewed by Allison and Burns, 1972; Allison, 1974) . Thus, for some viruses, eliciting a powerful cellmediated response is an important aspect of immunogenicity. A sum mary will be presented of the evidence for cell-mediated immune responses for viral antigens, particularly of observations made in vitro.\n\nThe fact that infections such as measles, varicella, and mumps usually occur only once had been known to medical practitioners for centuries, and when these were identified as caused by viruses it became clear that viruses are able to induce long-lasting immunity.\n\nTwo explanations have been put forward for prolonged antibody production in the absence of reinfection: persistence of virus in the host (Olitsky and Long, 1929a,b) and persistence of clones of immunocompetent cells (Burnet, 1959) . Both explanations are true. The latter phenomenon is well known and evidence for virus persistence will be presented.\n\nThe observations of Traube on lymphocytic choriomeningitis in fections in mice provided some of the evidence that led Burnet to postulate the existence of immunologie tolerance. In mice congenitally infected with this virus, antibody is not demonstrable in the serum, but during the last few years it has been shown that com plexes of antibody and virus-specific antigen accumulate in the kidneys, giving rise to an immunopathological glomerulonephritis. Similar observations have been made with murine leukemogenic viruses. Thus the animals are not completely unresponsive to viral antigens. Cooperative phenomena, perhaps of a hapten-carrier na ture and possibly responsible for some autoimmune phenomena, will be discussed.\n\nIn the same monograph in which he described reactions to vacci nation and rashes produced by virus infections as allergic reactions, von Pirquet (1907) drew attention to the depression of reactions to tuberculin which occur during measles infections, the first report of suppression of an immune response by a virus. Certain virus infec tions (as with LDV, measles virus, the thymic agent) can dramati cally affect the immune system. In addition to having important clinical consequences, these infections should be considered when interpreting laboratory studies of immune responses. Intercurrent virus infections occur in most animal colonies (especially Sendai virus, minute virus of mice, mouse pneumonitis virus). Mouse hepa titis virus can behave much like an endogenous virus, being undetectable until animals are immunosuppressed, and is frequently found in nude mice. Most passaged tumors carry LDV and other viruses. The effects of some of these virus infections on immune responses will be discussed.\n\nViruses vary considerably in their structural and antigenic com plexity. In a few cases their structures are known and their antigens well characterized and related to the virion structure, e.g., with adenovirus and influenza virus described below. With small viruses such as the enteroviruses, the antigenic composition is relatively simple. In each of the three types of poliovirus, for instance, two an tigens are distinguishable by immunodiffusion and complement fixa tion (CF). Infectious virions containing RNA have a D (dense) an tigen whereas noninfectious particles have a C (coreless) antigen (Hummeler et al., 1962) . The D antigen can be converted to C an tigen by denaturation, so that the C antigen can be regarded as a pro tein that has not attained or retained the D configuration brought about in the complete virion by association with the RNA-containing core. A third antigen, the S antigen, can be obtained by guanidine degradation of the virus and is probably a protein precursor of the virus coat (Scharffand Lewinton, 1963) . Humans infected with poliovirus develop type-specific antibodies against C and D antigens, but only the latter neutralize the virus. In the following sections, the structures and antigens of more complicated viruses -adenovirus, influenza virus, paramyxoviruses, togaviruses, rhabdoviruses, and the herpesviruses -will be described.\n\nHerpesviruses form a family of large enveloped viruses of 1800-2000 A size with genomes of double-stranded DNA having G + C contents ranging for different members from 3 3 % to 72% (Plummer et al., 1969) . The herpesviruses naturally infecting man tend to produce latent infections and focal cytopathology and are divided into four groups: (1) herpes simplex (HSV), (2) cytomegaloviruses (CMV), (3) varicellazoster (V-Z), and (4) Epstein-Barr (EB) virus. All of these viruses multiply in the cell nucleus where the naked icosohedral nucleocapsids can be seen and acquire their envelopes when budding through the inner lamella of the nuclear membrane or during their egress through the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. Shortly after infection, host DNA and protein synthesis cease as that of the virus commences. Viral mem brane protein synthesis begins before viral DNA synthesis, and glycosylation of the virus proteins occurs in the membrane and is ac complished by host enzymes. HSV virions contain at least 24 virusspecific proteins and, although earlier studies showed HSV could be agglutinated by antisera made against the uninfected host cell (Watson and Wildy, 1963) , recent studies reveal essentially no host proteins in the virion (see review by Roizman and Heine, 1972) .\n\nMost viral structural proteins, including glycoproteins, are made during the first two hours of infection before the viral DNA replica tion begins. Many structural proteins for HSV and EB virus, and perhaps all herpesviruses, thus represent the products of \"early func tion\" genes, and this situation differs from that usually found with bacteriophages and the papova viruses, where structural proteins are coded for by \"late\" genes that are transcribed after viral DNA repli cation. The protein portions of the membrane glycoproteins are virus-coded (Olshevsky and Becker, 1972) and genetic variants of these proteins determine such membrane phenomena as the \"social behavior\" of HSV, i.e., whether infected cells fuse with contiguous cells or clump. Two types of HSV are recognized and evidence has been presented for a type-specific glycoprotein, present in infected cells and on the virion surface, that can interact with antibody and result in virus neutralization (Cohen et al., 1972; Powell et al., 1974) .\n\nThe adenoviruses are DNA viruses having icosohedral symmetry. There are at least 33 human types (Blacklow et al., 1969) , and Rosen has divided them into 3 subgroups (see Table I ) according to hemagglutination (HA) characteristics (Rosen, 1960) . Norrby (1969a) and Schlesinger (1969) have reviewed the structure and biology of adenoviruses. About 18% of the virus protein is associated with DNA in a central nucleoid (Laver et al., 1967) which is surrounded by an outer protein coat, the capsid. The capsid contains 252 polygonal capsomeres -240 hexons forming triangular facets and 12 apices made up of pentons (Figs. 1 and 2). Each penton consists of a vertex 3,7,11,14,16,20,21,25,28 8,9,10,13,15,17,19,22,23,24,26,27,29,30 1,2,4,5,6,12,18 Hemagglutination\n\nRat\n\na Partial agglutination, enhanced by heterotypic immune sera. capsomere (penton base) and an attached knobbed fiber. Hexons and pentons can be isolated from soluble products of infected cells or after disruption of virions. Originally, three antigens were described: a complement-fixing hexon group antigen (A antigen) common to all adenoviruses except the avian GAL virus, a penton group antigen (B antigen) toxic to cells, and a type-specific fiber antigen (C antigen).\n\nWith the awareness that antigenic sites on the intact virion may differ from some of those determined by immunization with sponta neously occurring soluble components, and that there are subpop ulations of hexons of particular serotypes , detailed analyses of adenovirus antigenic structure have been carried out using purified capsid subunits and specific antisera in absorption and HA studies. The subunits have varying capacities for HA: hexons and vertex capsomeres show no such capacity whereas all pentons and the fibers of subgroups II and III show partial HA. The latter is due to the univalency of these particles since dimers of pentons and fibers (at least in the case of subgroup III) show complete HA. Heterotypic sera, which can react with group or subgroup antigens on the fibers or vertex capsomeres can enhance HA by aggregating fibers or pentons into polyvalent complexes; this is termed the hemagglutination enhancement (HE) test. Vertex capsomeres can be identified by their ability to absorb HE antibody and thus decrease the HA normally found when a standard preparation of pentons is subsequently added; this is termed the HE antibody consumption (HEC) test.\n\nHexons appear to contain several antigens. The a (A) antigen is group-specific and detected in C F tests. The hexon a antigen ap pears to be located on the inner aspect of the capsid since antibody to it lacks HI activity and cannot be seen on ultrastructural examina tion ; moreover, processes that disrupt the virion result in increased C F activity . The presence of a typespecific antigen, e, was suggested by the surprising finding that only anti-hexon sera contain neutralizing antibody (Wilcox and Ginsberg, 1963; Kjellen and Pereira, 1968 ). Antibody to a antigen can be ab sorbed with heterotypic virus or hexons, leaving homotypic (anti-e) antibody which is active in hemagglutination inhibition and neutral ization assays. Using negative staining, this antibody has been shown to attach to the outer surface of hexons in intact virions . Agglutination of virions was prominent and might account for the HI activity of this antibody. Another possible mechanism for this HI activity is steric hindrance of the fiber hemagglutinin by antibody attached to paravertex hexons; this latter mechanism is supported by the finding that the HI activity of different anti-hexon sera was inver sely related to the fiber length of the viruses tested . Serotypes of subgroup III, with the exception of type 4 virus, differ from those of subgroups I and II in that hexons of the latter are considerably more efficient in the induction of neutralizing antibody. Antibodies to subgroup III hexons do attach to the hexons as shown by their ability to sensitize the virus to neutralization by antiglobulin antisera . Absorption tests suggest that hexons possess minor intrasubgroup antigens as well as a and e . Haase and Pereira (1972) have recently demonstrated neutralizing capacity of antibody directed against the hexon e antigen of adenovirus type 2. Crystallized hexons of adenovirus type 5 were coupled to Sepharose and an immunoadsorbent column prepared. Antisera to purified hexons of adenovirus type 2 were then passed over the col umn to adsorb group-specific (anti-\u03b1) antibody. The unbound mate rial possessed neutralizing ability against type 2 virus but not type 5 virus. The subsequently eluted antibody neutralized neither virus. This elegant experiment demonstrates that the type-specific (e) an tigen is the crucial hexon antigen involved in neutralization.\n\nPentons can be separated into their fibers and vertex capsomeres by guanidine treatment. Vertex capsomeres have a group-specific \u00df (B) antigen. Toxin activity is associated with these capsomeres and its neutralization is group-specific. Absorption experiments using H E C test suggested subgroup and some intersubgroup specificity . Recently, studies using antiglobulin to enhance neutralization of virions sensitized with antisera to vertex capsomeres confirmed this and indicated that vertex capsomeres in intact virions have subgroup specificities not found in the monomeric soluble subunits .\n\nAll fibers contain a type-specific y (C) antigen which on ultrastruc tural examination is located at the distal (knobbed) end and can participate in C F and HI reactions. Antibody to the fibers of all serotypes are able to sensitize the virus to neutraliza tion by antiglobulin and perhaps to neutralize directly. Fibers of sub groups II and III also contain an intrasubgroup specific antigen, \u03b4, located proximally; it cannot react with antibody if the vertex capsomere is attached. It is this antigen which is active in HE tests. Some intersubgroup specificity has also been detected . Wigand and Fliedner (1968) observed that some adenovirus strains react differently in HI and neutralization tests, suggesting they might be intermediate strains. The two type-specific antigens, y and e, can be differentiated in HI tests using soluble and virion-associated hemagglutinin, respectively. Such analyses have been reported for two strains, and the HI antigen specificity was related to the fibers and the neutralization specificity to the hexons (Norrby, 1969b) . The latter relationship was not complete, suggesting mutational changes in the hexon after a previous recombination between prototypes. Of practical importance, infection with such mosaic viruses might result in HI tests indicating one prototype but neutralizing antibody and protection would be against another type.\n\nThe structures of influenza virus and the related fowl plague virus have been reviewed recently (Laver, 1973; Schulze, 1973) . Ortho myxoviruses consist of a helical nucleocapsid which contains the nucleic acid (RNA), surrounded by a pleiomorphic lipid envelope with projecting spikes of glycoprotein (Figs. 3 and 4) . The nucleo capsid of influenza virus is unique among myxoviruses in that it is fragmented into at least three nucleoprotein pieces which contain segments of the viral RNA. During virus infection a nonglycosylated viral protein, termed the \"membrane protein\" or M protein, aligns it self under the plasma membrane and viral proteins accumulate in the cell membrane above it to the exclusion of host proteins. These viral proteins thus form discrete domains on the cell membrane before budding of the virus occurs (see review by Choppin et al., 1972) .\n\nInfluenza virions are 900-1100 A in diameter and covered with two types of projecting spikes arranged in hexagonal fashion. After disruption of virus particles with lipid solvents, these spikes can be separated and the subunits of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase isolated. The hemagglutinin spikes (Fig. 5) are 40 by 140 A rods which consist of trimers of a glycoprotein with MW 75,000-80,000 daltons. This molecule can under reducing conditions be dissociated to yield two distinct glycoproteins (HAi and HA 2 ) with molecular weights varying with the virus strain. Hemagglutinin appears to be synthesized as a single protein molecule associated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes where it is rapidly glycosylated Lazarowitz et al., 1971; Stanley and Haslam, 1971; Compans, 1973) . Posttranslational cleavage of hemagglutinin differs for various virus strains, is host-dependent, and occurs in the plasma membrane (Lazarowitz et al., 1971 (Lazarowitz et al., , 1973 Klenk et al., 1972b;  Skehel, 1972; Compans, 1973) . Cleavage does not appear to affect virus infectivity or hemagglutinin titer (Stanley et al, 1973) . The neuraminidase spikes, shorter and distinct from the hemagglutinin spikes, consist of tetramers of subunit glycoproteins having MW 55,000-70,000 daltons (Wrigley et al, 1973) . The subunits of neur aminidase of some strains may consist of two polypeptides.\n\nIn contrast to the virion proteins, almost all of which are coded by the virus (Holland and Kiehn, 1970) , the lipids (Kates et al, 1961) and carbohydrates (Howe et al., 1967) of the virion are host specific and the latter can alter virus antigenicity. The s\u00e9rologie specificities of protein-bound and lipid-bound carbohydrates are different. Treat ment of virus with the proteolytic enzyme bromelin removes the spikes, leaving noninfectious, smooth-surfaced particles containing all of the virion lipid ( Fig. 6) . Concanavalin A, a phytagglutinin from jack beans, was found to react only with intact virions whereas the phytagglutinin from Dolichos biflorus, which reacts with the terminal sugar of blood group A (N-acetylgalactosamine), reacted only with the spikeless particles, the glycolipid moieties of which were exposed by bromelin treatment (Klenk et al., 1972a) . Likewise, antibody to blood group A could be absorbed with the spikeless particles but not with intact virions.\n\nEarly reports, using viral preparations probably contaminated with host cell membrane fragments, indicated that blood group antigens A and B and Forssman antigen could be detected as surface antigens on the virions if grown in cells possessing these antigens (Springer and Schuster, 1964) . However, recent studies indicate that with progressive purification of the virus, Forssman antigen (a glyco lipid) cannot be detected on the virion surface (Haheim and Haukenes, 1973a ), but is found in the viral lipids and is accessible to an tibody only after removal of the virion spikes with bromelin (Haheim and Haukenes, 1973b) . A sulfated glycopeptide antigen found in the chick allantoic cavity (Haukenes et al, 1966; Howe et al, 1967; Lee et al, 1969) and found in liver and bile of adult chickens (Harboe and Haukenes, 1966) is acquired by virus growing in the endodermal cells lining the allantoic cavity . Recent studies reveal this host antigen to be associated with spikes of both hemag glutinin and neuraminidase (Haheim and Haukenes, 1973b) and an tibody to this host antigen reacts with the carbohydrate moieties rather than the peptide backbone of the molecule (Higginbotham et al, 1971) .\n\nThe virus genome determines four major antigens: hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, the membrane or M protein, and nucleoprotein. Dif ferences in the nucleoprotein, termed the \" S \" (soluble) antigen, Fig. 6 . Influenza A 0 /WSN virions from which all glycoproteins have been removed by proteolytic treatment. Particles were negatively stained with uranyl acetate after glutaraldehyde fixation. Morphology suggestive of a double-layered wall and an in ternal strand is seen in some particles. X210,000; marker = 1000 A. From Schulze (1973). divide influenza into three major types (A, B, and C). Although an tibodies to this internal antigen and to the M protein fix complement, they have no neutralizing or hemagglutinating-inhibition (HI) activi ties and are probably unimportant in immunity. The hemagglutinin or \"V\" antigen determines strain specificity and reacts with neutral izing, CF, and HI antibody. There is great genetic stability of the internal antigens while the V antigen, exposed to immunologie selec tion, undergoes frequent minor changes that result in influenza epi demics. Major antigenic shifts in hemagglutinin that result in pan demics are the result of extensive changes in amino acid sequences in HA X and HA 2 as revealed by tryptic peptide analyses, and may in volve recombination of preexisting human strains with animal strains (Laver and Webster, 1973) . Neuraminidase, associated with glyco-protein spikes different from the hemagglutinin spikes, undergoes antigenic changes independently of the V antigen.\n\nThe paramyxovirus genus includes a number of common viruses which have similarities to the orthomyxoviruses as well as some interesting differences. As is true for orthomyxoviruses, host factors determine the composition of the virion lipid coat and the glycosylation of protruding protein spikes. Host glycolipid antigens (e.g., blood group antigens) may be incorporated into the virion (Isacson and Koch, 1965) . However, nucleocapsids are composed of a single protein species and nonsegmented RNA, and viral nucleic acid repli cation occurs in the cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus.\n\nWithin the genus there are at least three distinct virus groups. The parainfluenza viruses -including Sendai virus, simian virus 5 (SV5), mumps virus, and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) -have consider able antigenic cross-reactivity and possess hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and hemolytic and cell-fusion activities. The HA and neuraminidase activities of SV5 , NDV Sendai virus (Tozawa et al., 1973; Scheid and Choppin, 1974) reside in a single glycoprotein of MW 65,000-70,000. The hemolytic and cell-fusion activities of Sendai virus have long been thought to be associated with virus protein and recent studies have confirmed this. Hosaka and Shimiza (1972) showed that isolated virus glycoprotein and virus membrane lipids were inactive separa tely but reconstitution of hemolytic and cell-fusion activities occurred when they were recombined. Scheid and Choppin (1974) recently demonstrated a Sendai virus glycoprotein (MW 53,000), derived from a larger precursor by natural proteolytic activity in vivo or by trypsinization in vitro, which is responsible for the hemolytic and cellfusion activities of the virion and also influences its infectivity. An tibodies to both the hemagglutinin/neuraminidase glycoprotein and to the fusion/hemolytic glycoprotein are probably important in virus neutralization, while antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein or to the internal \" M \" protein are not.\n\nThe measles-rinderpest-canine distemper group of paramyxo viruses are antigenically closely related to one another and lack neuraminidase. Recent studies indicate that the measles virion con tains six polypeptides, two being glycoproteins that form the pro jecting spikes Martin, 1973, 1974) . Norrby and co-workers have correlated certain s\u00e9rologie tests with structural components of measles virus (Norrby and Hammarskjold, 1972) . Antibodies to nucleocapsids fix complement and antibodies that inhibit hemagglutination (HI) or hemolysis (HLI) must react with surface compo nents. The finding that HI antibodies can block hemolysis while HLI antibodies have only slight HI activity suggests that the hemolysin represents a separate entity in the virus envelope. Following natural measles infections nucleocapsid C F antibodies predominate and neutralizing antibodies correlate better with HLI than with HI antibodies (Norrby and Gollmar, 1972) . In subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), oligoclonal IgG antibodies to the various virus components were found, especially in the CSF (Vandvik and Norrby, 1973) . In one case, a population of antibodies with HLI and neutral izing but no HI activities was identified. Patients with multiple sclerosis have increased amounts of antibodies to all measles virion components in sera and CSF (Link et al., 1973; . The pathogenetic importance of these findings in SSPE and multiple sclerosis is uncertain.\n\nRespiratory syncitial virus has been classed temporarily as a paramyxovirus. Although it possesses envelope spikes, it lacks hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and hemolytic and cell-fusion activities.\n\nThis large family of viruses includes what were formerly known as group A arboviruses (now alphaviruses) and group B arboviruses (now flaviviruses after its best known member, yellow fever virus), plus a small number of unclassified but structurally similar viruses, e.g., rubella virus and lactate dehydrogenase virus. There are about 20 alphaviruses and 40 flaviviruses grouped on the basis of crossreactivity in HI tests (Casals, 1957) . Complement-fixation, neutral ization, and cross-protection tests are more specific but show some cross-reactions within each group. The ungrouped togaviruses are not serologically related.\n\nTogaviruses consist of single-stranded RNA enclosed in a coat of core protein rich in lysine and arginine to form a nucleocapsid. A dis tinctive lipid bilayer containing some carbohydrate is applied to the nucleocapsid much as the M protein in influenza virions (Fig. 7) . The peplomers, composed of one or two protein species and rich in hydrophobic amino acids to facilitate attachment, project outward from the lipid coat. The lipid and carbohydrate compositions of the virion are host-determined (Pfefferkorn and Hunter, 1963; Strauss et al., 1970; Renkonen et al., 1971) . The peplomers can be removed with proteases leaving the unchanged lipid-coated nucleocapsids (Compans, 1971) . Treatment of virions with detergents yields nu cleocapsids free of the lipid-glycoprotein envelope (Strauss et al., 1968) . Purified peplomer glycoproteins capable of eliciting neutral izing antibodies and of blocking the neutralizing activity of convales cent sera have been isolated from Chikungunya virus (Igarashi et al., 1970 ), Semliki Forest virus (Appleyard et al., 1970; Ken nedy, 1974) , Sindbis virus (Faulkner and Dobos, 1968; Bose and Sagik, 1970) , and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (Pedersen et al., 1973) . Two distinct envelope glycoproteins isolated from Sem liki Forest virus possess a common antigenic determinant (Kennedy, 1974) . Excision of the carbohydrate moieties with various sugar hydrolases did not remove the antigen, which must therefore be part of the polypeptides.\n\nRhabdoviruses, of which vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and rabies virus have been particularly well studied, are bullet-shaped enveloped RNA viruses about 1700 A long and 700 A in diameter (Fig. 8) . The single-stranded RNA of MW 4 X 10 6 daltons is as sociated with approximately 1000 capsomers of the \"N\" (nucleo- capsid) protein and arranged in a helix of 34 turns; two other pro teins, \" N S \" and \" L , \" are associated with the nucleocapsid. As with influenza virus, a nonglycosylated membrane or \" M \" protein is closely applied to the nucleocapsid, and this protein coat is in turn surrounded by a host-derived lipid coat. The glycolipid of the virion is host-determined and thus may possess antigens of the host cell. Antisera against uninfected cells will react with highly purified virus grown in those cells, and in one study the antigen appeared to be a host hematoside incorporated into the glycolipid portion of the virion (Cartwright and Brown, 1972) .\n\nGlycoprotein peplomers (the \" G \" protein) of MW 69,000 daltons protrude from this lipid coat and can be removed selectively by pro teases; it is the hemagglutinin and neutralizing antigen of the virion (Cartwright et al, 1970; McSharry et al, 1971; Kelley et al, 1972) . The carbohydrate portion of this glycoprotein is largely hostspecified (B\u00fcrge and Huang, 1970; B\u00fcrge and Strauss, 1970; Grimes and B\u00fcrge, 1971) , and may reflect the antigenicity of the host cell membrane (Ansel, 1974) . The virus glycoprotein is easily purified and thus provides a tool with which to study alterations in the glycosylation of membrane proteins induced by cell transformation (Moyer and Summers, 1974) . In mixed infections of VSV and the paramyxovirus SV5, phenotypic mixing occurs and the SV5 peplomers may replace those of VSV on VSV virions without altering their overall morphology (McSharry et al., 1971) ; these virions can then be neutralized with antibody to SV5. It is not known if host glycoproteins can replace virus glycoprotein as peplomers. Nonionic detergents can be used sequentially to dissect the VSV or rabies virions until only the infectious ribonucleoprotein remains (Cartwright et al, 1970) .\n\nThe various murine leukemogenic viruses (MuLV) are morpho logically indistinguishable from one another. They are 1200 A in diameter and consist of a nucleoid core with an outer shell sur rounded by a membrane derived during budding and possessing small surface projections. Initially, rats bearing MuLV-induced tumors were found to produce C F and precipitating antibodies against species or group-specific (gs) antigen. The first such antigen defined was named gs-1, and another shown to be an interspecies an tigen was named gs-3. Both these antigens, as well as type-specific antigens for strains of MuLV from the same species, reside on the same protein, p30. This protein (MW 30,000 daltons) comprises 30% of the total virion protein and is an internal protein since neutra lizing antibodies do not react with it. The gs-1 antigen is widely dis tributed in reticular tissues of normal mice but does not always cor relate with the presence of infectious MuLV.\n\nVirus neutralization tests detect virus envelope antigens (VEA's). Two closely related envelope glycopeptides, gp69/71, have molecu lar weights of 69,000 and 71,000 daltons and contain prominent group-specific (common to many or all MuLV) and type-specific (limited to a particular virus) antigens, and less easily detected inter species determinants. Neutralization studies have led preliminarily to the classification of laboratory MuLV isolates into 5 categories (Table II) . High incidence leukemia mouse strains (AKR, C58) pro duce MuLV serologically identical to Gross virus (with GVEA) (Hartley et al, 1969) . Cell surface antigens (CSA's) of MuLV-infected cells were first defined in tumor transplantation studies. Animals rejecting such tumor grafts possess specifically cytotoxic antibodies which can (in the presence of complement) lyse tumors induced by the same virus. Most antibodies to the CSA's are not neutralizing antibodies since adsorption of virus-neutralizing activity with purified virus leaves the cytotoxic activity of the serum undiminished (Pasternak, 1967; Steeves, 1968) . Also, immunoelectron microscopy studies demon strate VEA's and CSA's in topographically separate regions of the cell surface (Aokiei al., 1970) . Cross-reactive patterns with cytotoxic antibodies define two major subgroups on the basis of CSA's: Gross and Friend -Moloney -Rauscher (FMR). Type-specific CSA deter minants have not been analyzed. The Gross CSA is found on many normal and preleukemic cells of high-leukemic mouse strains (AKR). In contrast, the FMR determinant is not found on normal cells. The FMR antigen appears to be an internal virion protein that differs from p30 (Friedman et al., 1974) . Although they are not the principal CSA's of MuLV-infected cells, both p30 and gp69/71 are found on the surface of infected cells (Ikeda et al., 1974; Yoshiki et al., 1974a) . Expression of the various genes coding for structural proteins of MuLV is regulated by many genes (Lilly and Pincus, 1973; Rowe, 1973) . Multiple copies of some genes coding for virus proteins may be present in each cell and not coordinately linked (Strand et al., 1974) .\n\nReverse transcriptase in the core of MuLV virions carries interspecies and species-specific determinants (Parks et al., 1972) . The interspecies antigen of MuLV reverse transcriptase cross-reacts with that of other small mammals but not with that of primates or chickens.\n\nThe sequence of IgM and IgG responses to viral antigens is usually like that observed with nonviral antigens. Complicating factors in the humoral responses to viruses include a persisting antigenic load while infection continues, cell and tissue destruction by the virus, and influences of the virus on the immune system.\n\nThe responses of rabbits to nonreplicating viral antigens have been studied in detail with poliomyelitis type 1 (PV) (Svehag and Mandel, 1964a,b; Svehag, 1964a,b) and influenza virus (Webster, , 1968a . In both cases with adequate antigen dose after a short inductive phase (8-12 hours in the case of PV) IgM antibodies ap peared, followed later by IgG antibodies (Fig. 9 ). Small doses of PV produced only a transient IgM response, which after 4 days declined at a rate consistent with the metabolic decay rate of this immunoglobulin. Larger doses of PV elicited both IgM and IgG an tibody responses; IgM synthesis continued for 10-14 days, whereas IgG was first detected on the third day and increased until the third week. Thereafter IgG levels remained constant for about 30 weeks and persisted at moderate titers for 2 years. This was not due to chronic infection since poliovirus does not grow in rabbit tissue and UV-irradiated virus gave the same result. Similar findings with an tibodies against the bacteriophage \u03c6\u03a7174 in guinea pigs had been reported by Uhr and Finkelstein (1963) , although the rate of an- Fig. 9 . Production of mercaptoethanol-sensitive (19 S) and mercaptoethanol-resistant (7 S) antibody in rabbits immunized with a large dose of poliovirus. From Svehag and Mandel (1964b) . tibody formation against the bacteriophage was less antigen-depen dent than in the case of PV.\n\nInteresting information on immunologie memory has come from the experiments with PV. With low doses of virus eliciting only IgM responses there was no detectable memory; repeated small doses of PV at monthly intervals elicited only transient and identical IgM responses (Fig. 10) . However, if a second small dose of PV was ad ministered 6 days after the first (2 days after the 19 S antibody had begun to decline), a large secondary response consisting exclusively of 19 S antibody occurred and the titer rose 100-fold. Again, this sec ondary response began the day after inoculation of PV and persisted for only 4 days. These results suggest that an immunologie memory of IgM antibody production does exist but is very short-lived. The early and large secondary response shows that immunocompetent cells in the primary response do not die after 4 days of antibody release but require further antigenic stimulation for continued antibody produc tion. Similar results have been obtained with the \u03c6\u03a7-guinea pig system.\n\nStudies of natural and experimental poliovirus infections of humans (using attenuated virus) have largely confirmed the findings . Production of antibody in rabbits after repeated immunizations with small doses of poliovirus. Only 19 S antibody was produced and the responses were tran sient and almost identical. From Svehag and Mandel (1964b). in rabbits previously discussed. The level of neutralizing IgM an tibody rises rapidly after natural infection, reaches maximum titers in 3-4 weeks, and declines to undetectable levels by 3 months (Svehag and Mandel, 1964b; Ogra et al., 1968) . IgG titers rise over a pro longed period and may not attain peak levels until after 3 months. IgA antibody is not detectable until 4-6 weeks after infection and rises for at least the ensuing 8 weeks. The early neutralizing an tibody is of low avidity (Sabin, 1957) . Although CF antibody (against D and C antigens) attains maximum levels after about 2 months and persists for 1-5 years, neutralizing antibody decreases to one-fourth its peak titer by 2 years and persists near that level for decades. Ogra et al. (1968) have compared the humoral responses to live and inactivated vaccines in infants (see Figs. 11 and 12) . Beginning at 2 months of age, 3 monthly doses of trivalent inactivated virus (subcutaneously), or live virus type 1 and types 2 and 3 on successive months (orally) were administered; a booster was given at 12 months of age. Poliovirus-binding antibody titers were determined by radioimmunodiffusion and neutralizing antibody assays for type 1 virus were performed on sera and secretions. Maternally derived IgG an-\n\nInactivated Vaccine DAYS Fig. 11 .

Production of IgM, IgG, and IgA antibody against poliovirus type 1 in serum and secretions after immunization with live attenuated poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, given sequentially at monthly intervals, beginning at 2 months of age. From Ogra et al (1968). tibody was detected in low titers in one-fourth of the infants aged 2 months; no sera contained IgM. IgM and IgG were detected 3 days after the first vaccine dose. The IgM titers rose more rapidly than those of IgG and became maximal during the second week before declining to undetectable levels by 8-10 weeks. IgM declined more slowly in recipients of inactivated virus as they had repeated antigenic stimulation (3 doses). IgG titers in both groups continued to rise for 7-10 weeks before leveling off. Serum IgA titers were not detected until 2 weeks after initial immunization; they rose slowly over a 3-month period. After the booster at 12 months, IgM titers showed a transient rise to previous levels, thus duplicating the find ings in rabbits (Fig. 13 ). Recipients of live virus had neutralizing IgA in their nasal and duodenal secretions after 16-21 days, which per sisted for at least 90 days (duodenal) and 300 days (nasal); recipients of inactivated virus had no secreted IgA antibody to poliovirus.\n\nStudies of guinea pigs infected with arboviruses (Bellanti et al., 1965) and of humans infected with mumps virus Daugharty et al., 1973) , Coxsackie virus (Schmidt et al., 1968) , influ- (Lehrich et al., 1966) have demonstrated IgM and IgG patterns similar to those following poliovirus infection and suggest that this pattern of antibody response is a general phenome non. The IgM response following natural influenza infection or im munization appears to be unique in one study in that the IgM was exclusively of a 7 S form (Brown and O'Leary, 1973) .\n\nParticular antigens of a virus appear to be capable of eliciting a response of a specific class of immunoglobulin, as do nonviral an tigens (Schirrmacher and Rajewsky, 1970) . Cowan (1970) and Brown and Smale (1970) have shown that IgM and IgG produced in guinea pigs infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus are specific for dis tinctive antigenic determinants on the virus particle, and have described differential reactions of 7 S and 19 S an-tibodies with HSV antigens in infected cells. Most patients with warts produce only IgM antibodies to the human wart virus (Goffe et al., 1966; Pyrhonen and Penttinen, 1972) . Recently, Lee et al. (1974) reported that normal B6C3FJ mouse sera contains 19 S an tibodies that react with antigenic determinants on 3 structural pro teins of MuLV while antibodies in the 7 S fraction react with only one of these proteins, p l 5 .\n\nSeveral explanations can be offered for the preferential elicitation of particular immunoglobulin classes by these viral antigens. A triv ial explanation for not finding IgM against a particular antigen is that the IgM response is transient unless there is continued antigenic stimulation. An exclusively IgM response may occur with small immunogenic stimuli, as discussed above. Thus, wart virus, growing only in the epidermis, does not have ready access to the bloodstream or lymphatics to immunize the host. This has led to the suggestion that susceptibility to recurrent attacks of warts may be related to fail ure of very small doses of antigen to promote an IgG response, the presence of the latter being a good indicator of healing (Pyrhonen and Penttinen, 1972) .\n\nThe genetic control of immune responses to certain antigens has been demonstrated in guinea pigs and mice and appears to be under the control of the Ir genes in the H-2 complex (see Benacerraf and McDevitt, 1972; McDevitt and Landy, 1973) . Nonresponders pro duce only IgM antibody to the specific antigen (Grumet, 1972) unless certain conditions such as an allogeneic stimulus are imposed (Ordal and Grumet, 1972) . Similar situations with viral antigens may also occur, but have not yet been described. However, an increased humoral response to measles virus has been associated with HL-A3 in man (Arnason et al., 1974) . An increased incidence of multiple sclerosis is associated with HL-A3 but there is no such association with optic neuritis, which often evolves clinically into multiple scle rosis. Also, patients with optic neuritis have normal levels of an tibody to measles virus. The association of high titers of antibody to measles virus with multiple sclerosis may thus reflect the prevalence of high titers to the virus in people with the HL-A3 genotype.\n\nMany examples of genetically controlled resistance to infection within a species are known ). Thus, several major genes confer resistance to chickens and chick cells against infection by particular strains of avian leukemogenic viruses or Rous viruses coated by them. The control of murine leukemogenesis is multigenic, with different genes controlling viral expression (Akv-1 and Akv-2 genes), viral replication (Fv-1 gene), and resistance to Gross virus and virus-transformed cells (the Rgv-1 gene) (Lilly and Pincus, 1973; Rowe, 1973) . The Rgv-1 gene is linked to H-2 and influences late disease patterns. It is only by inference, however, that its mecha nism is thought to involve immune responses. The immunopathological disease caused by LCM virus infection of adult mice has been reported associated with H-2 (Oldstone et al., 1973) . This find ing is not universally found in all laboratories (possibly because of virus strain differences), and awaits detailed immunologie analysis.\n\nViruses infecting seromucous surfaces such as the respiratory or alimentary tracts must pass a first line of defense consisting of secre tory antibody and inhibitory mucoprotein secretions. Francis (1942) first noted the presence of anti-influenzal antibody in human nasal secretions and for years it has been thought that virus infections of the mucous membranes could confer specific local immunity. It is now clear that the main antibody in seromucous secretions is IgA, although a compensatory increase in the levels of other immunoglobulins, especially IgM, occurs in the secretions of people with IgA deficiency (see Tomasi and Bienenstock, 1969) . Thus, an tibody in nasal secretions against rhinoviruses , parainfluenza 1 virus (Smith et al., 1966) , and influenza virus Alford et al., 1967) is predominantly IgA. However, the role of IgA antibodies in recovery from virus infections and preven tion of reinfection is less clear.\n\nFazekas de St. Groth and Graham (1954) reported that the immu nity of mice to reinfection with influenza virus is more closely corre lated with the presence of antibody in nasal secretions than with an tibody in serum. Several groups of investigators have reported that parenteral administration of inactivated viruses increases levels of serum IgG and IgM antibodies, but not levels of IgA antibodies in nasal secretions, whereas natural infection results in the formation of IgA secretory antibodies and better resistance to reinfection Smith et al., 1966; Alford et al., 1967) . This does not nec essarily imply that IgA is responsible for the resistance to rein-fection because the natural infection could have other effects, in cluding local stimulation of T lymphocytes. Claims that local IgA production and protection follow aerosol administration of inac tivated influenza virus (Waldman et al., 1970) have not been con firmed in other laboratories (Shore et al., 1973) and further work on the subject is required.\n\nOne of the arguments of Sabin (1959) in support of live poliovirus immunization is that it would stimulate local secretory antibody production, thereby limiting excretion of the virus and transmission in the population. Ogra (1973) has presented evidence that produc tion of IgA antibody is a local reaction. Immunization of selected segments of the large intestine in subjects with double-barreled colostomies induced an IgA antibody response against poliovirus in the immunized segment with little or no response elsewhere. How ever, subcutaneous immunization with killed poliovirus has not only eliminated paralytic disease but also the transmission of the virus in the Swedish population, as shown by large scale examinations of feces of persons admitted to hospital for any reason (Perkins, 1974) .\n\nDeficiency of secretory IgA is not rare, occurring in about 1 in 500 persons in Western Europe and North America. Most such individu als remain healthy, although some have recurrent sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections (Schwartz and Buckley, 1971) . Thus, in some individuals IgG and IgM antibodies appear able to substitute for IgA antibodies in secretions.\n\nAfter the exposure of animals to most antigens the formation of an tibodies by cells of the B lymphocyte lineage requires helper effects of T lymphocytes (Miller et al., 1971 ). This has given rise to the con cept of the \"thymus dependence\" of antigens, some antigens being more dependent than others on T lymphocytes for a normal humoral response. Originally, thymus dependence was defined in terms of the amount of serum antibody formed to an antigen in a T lym phocyte-deprived animal. Later, it was found that IgM responses are less dependent on T lymphocytes than those of other immunoglobulin classes and that humoral responses to certain \"thymus independent\" antigens (pneumococcal polysaccharide type III) are regulated by T lymphocytes. \"Thymus dependence\" is thus a rela tive term and depends on animal species and strain as well as mode of antigen presentation. Generally, \"thymus-independent\" antigens are large, slowly metabolized molecules with repeating antigenic de terminants (epitopes). It might be expected that some viruses, many of which possess antigenic polyvalency inherent in their structures, could have some epitopes in the proper repeating spatial rela tionship to be immunogenically thymus-independent.\n\nUntil the recent availability of the athymic nude mouse, neonatal thymectomy or treatment with ALS was used to deplete animals of T lymphocytes and ascertain the thymus dependence of virus antigens. Although these methods of T lymphocyte depletion are not effective by present standards, the results obtained will be reviewed. Thus, neonatal thymectomy did not abolish the production of HI an tibodies to polyoma virus in mice Mori et al., 1966) or rats (Allison and Taylor, 1967) , or to influenza virus (Svet-Moldavsky et al., 1964) or Coxsackie B5 virus (cited in Mori et al., 1967) in mice. Titers of complement-dependent neutralizing an tibodies (probably IgM) to HSV in CF-1 mice neonatally thymectomized were similar to those of control mice (Mori et al., 1970) . The other method of T lymphocyte depletion, pretreatment of mice with ALS, did not diminish the production of HI antibodies to vaccinia virus (Hirsch et al., 1968b) , C F antibodies to LCM virus (Hirsch et al., 1968a) , or HI antibodies to influenza virus (Hirsch and Mur phy, 1968) .\n\nIn addition to the ineffective methods of T lymphocyte deprivation in these studies, the continuing antigen presentation that occurs in virus infections must be considered. Svet-Moldavsky et al. (1964) have demonstrated that the abrogation of antibody response to sheep erythrocytes observed in neonatally thymectomized mice can be overcome by repeated immunizations. Mori et al. (1970) reported that neonatally thymectomized mice inoculated with Japanese en cephalitis virus had diminished HI titers which, however, rose to normal levels after repeated inoculations.\n\nA few studies have suggested thymus dependence for some virus antigens. Thind and Price (1971) reported markedly depressed levels of neutralizing antibodies to Langat virus (a togavirus) in mice neo natally thymectomized and infected 6 weeks later. Virelizier et al. (1974b) have recently analyzed the role of T cell helper effects in the formation of antibodies against influenza virus hemagglutinin. Two hemagglutinins, each containing a cross-reactive determinant(s) and a strain-specific determinant, were used and antibody formation against each of these could be quantitated independently by immunodiffusion. Immunization of thymectomized, irradiated, and bone-marrow reconstituted (TXBM) mice showed a strong thymus Allison (unpublished observations, 1974) observed that, in neonatally thymectomized mice infected as adults with HSV, levels of serum neutralizing antibodies were much lower than in intact animals; A. C. Allison and W. H. Burns have confirmed this finding in TXBM mice and nude mice (unpublished observations). Discrep ancies between these findings and previous reports concerning HSV and influenza virus probably stem from the use of mice inadequately depleted of T lymphocytes in the earlier reports.\n\nSince mice sham thymectomized, irradiated, and bone-marrow reconstituted make poor responses to some antigens months after reconstitution (Howard et al., 1971; Mitchell and Humphrey, 1973) , lesions in addition to T lymphocyte depletion must be present in TXBM mice. Although nude mice may possess abnormalities in addi tion to those presently recognized, they are probably the best an imals for studying thymus dependence. W. H. Burns (unpublished observations) has compared the humoral responses of nude mice and their normal (nu/+, +/+) littermates to infections with a number of viruses. Insignificant or very low (probably IgM) levels of neutral izing antibodies were found in nude mice infected with Coxsackie Bl virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, West Nile virus, VSV, or HSV. No HI antibodies were detected after infections with influenza or Sendai viruses and no C F antibodies were detected after infection with mouse adenovirus. However, infection with Sindbis virus re sulted in high titers (1:1000) of neutralizing antibody, solely of the IgM class; this titer was comparable to that in control littermates and was sustained for 2 weeks. The antigens of Sindbis virus that react with neutralizing antibody are two membrane glycoproteins. Using rabbit antisera, Kennedy (1974) has demonstrated that the antigenic determinants of Semliki Forest virus (an alphavirus similar to Sindbis virus) are in the polypeptide portions rather than the carbo hydrate moieties of the envelope glycoproteins. It will be of interest to determine if the \"thymus-independent\" antigenic determinants of Sindbis virus similarly reside in the protein part of the molecules. Recently, \"natural\" antibody in sera of nude mice has been detected that neutralizes a xenotropic virus isolated from these mice (S. Cross, H. M. Morse, and J. Hartley, personal communication, 1974) . Pre sumably the antibody (predominantly IgM) is directed against viral envelope proteins and/or glycoproteins.\n\nOn theoretical grounds it might be supposed that vaccination with a series of antigenically related viral vaccines would produce a broad immunity against all the viruses of a group, e.g., type A influenza viruses or flaviviruses. However, this aim is difficult to achieve be cause of a property of immunologie memory that Francis (1955) has called \"original antigenic sin.\" The response of various age groups of the human population to vaccinations with different strains of influ enza A virus showed that the s\u00e9rologie response of an individual is dominated throughout his life by the type jf antibody produced as a result of his first exposure to an influenza A virus (Francis, 1953 (Francis, , 1955 Davenport and Hennessy, 1956) . This type of response is char acteristic of infections of long-lived animals with any virus of which there are several cross-reacting antigenic types, e.g., flavi viruses-group B arthropod-bone viruses (Hearn and Rainey, 1963), paramyxoviruses (van der Veen and Sonderkamp, 1965) , and enteroviruses (Mietens et al., 1964) . It can be reproduced in laboratory animals either by successive infections with cross-reacting viruses or successive vaccination with inactive vaccines made from such cross-reacting viruses. The phenomenon is also observed when mice are immunized with purified cross-reactive influenza virus hemagglutinins (Virelizer et al., 1974a) . Analogous responses have been re ported in animals immunized with cross-reactive serum albumins, HL-A antigens, and haptens. Westaway et al. (1974) recently re ported that, after sequential infections of rabbits with related togaviruses, the cross-reactive antibodies produced after rechallenge were of the IgG class while IgM antibodies were specific for the most recent immunizing virus. In geographic areas where flavivirus infections are common and s\u00e9rologie diagnosis difficult because of cross-reacting antibodies and the recall phenomenon, determination of IgM specificity can permit diagnosis Edelman and Pariyanonda, 1973) .\n\nThus, the original antigenic sin phenomenon is not only of general interest from the theoretical point of view but of practical importance in immunization programs and in s\u00e9rologie epidemiology. It is para doxical, since it implies a qualitative failure in the specificity of im munologie memory. The cellular basis of the phenomenon is un known, and investigations in detail have begun using two purified influenza hemagglutinins, H 0 and \u0397 1? possessing specific as well as cross-reactive determinants (Virelizier et al., 1974a,b) . As mentioned above, formation of antibody against both these determinants is thymus-dependent. However, the thymus dependence of antibody formation against the cross-reactive determinant could be overcome by repeated inoculations of hemagglutinin in TXBM mice, indicating the presence of memory in these animals. Strong, secondary type responses were observed in primed, thymus-deprived mice after reconstitution with syngeneic virgin thymus cells, showing that spe cific immunologie memory is elicited by both determinants despite the absence of detectable antibody secretion. These observations are interpreted as examples of immunologie recognition and memory mediated by B lymphocytes. They suggest that the helper effect of T lymphocytes is exerted at a late stage in the differentiation of specific populations of B cells into antibody-secreting cells.\n\nThese findings are similar to those of Roelants and Askonas (1972) and I. M. Zitron (personal communication) for nonviral antigens. A similar interpretation might explain the results of Yamanouchi et al. (1974b) who reported that acute infection with rinderpest virus de pressed the primary response of rabbits to sheep erythrocytes, but left intact the secondary response after reimmunization 3 weeks later. Rinderpest virus, like measles virus which it closely resembles, may transiently impair T cell helper effects yet allow B lymphocyte proliferation.\n\nSeveral experiments have shown that B lymphocyte memory is responsible for original antigenic sin. Thus, when spleen cells from mice primed with H 0 are transferred to normal or irradiated recipi ents and the latter are challenged with H 1? secondary responses to specific H 0 determinants, as well as cross-reactive determinants, are obtained. Treatment of the spleen cells with anti-0 sera and comple ment does not affect this type of recall. However, similar experi ments using irradiated recipients show that, in addition to the mem ory which is responsible for the special type of recall, there is a T lymphocyte memory that increases specifically the response to the determinant on the first hemagglutinin (H 0 ) which is not cross-reac tive.\n\nThe decrease in infectious titer after mixing antibody and virus is termed neutralization and has been reviewed by Svehag (1968) . Most studies have been carried out in the fluid phase in vitro and each system of virus-cell-antibody-complement components presents unique features. The influence of the host cell was shown by Kjellen and Schlesinger (1959) , who found different levels of residual infectivity of VSV when the same virus-antibody complexes were assayed on chick and human cells. Complexes of virus and mammalian an tibody were more efficiently neutralized when propagated on mam malian cells than chicken cells, whereas chicken antibody was more effective with chicken cells. Philipson (1966) reported analogous findings with poliovirus when assayed on monkey and human cells, and others have made similar observations with various virus-host cell systems (Lafferty, 1963a; Hawkes, 1964) . Thus neutralization is a complex process involving three components: virus, antibody, and host cell. Neutralization in vivo where leukocytes and accessory factors are present may differ in important respects from that ob served in cell cultures.\n\nThe initial interaction between virus and antibody has been exten sively studied. Some workers found the interaction to be reversible, e.g., with influenza virus (Burnet et al., 1937; Fazekas de St. Groth, 1962; Lafferty, 1963a) , while others felt it was essentially irrever sible, e.g., with poliovirus (Dulbecco et al., 1956; Mandel, 1961; Philipson, 1966) , adenovirus (Kjellen, 1962) , NDV (Granoff, 1965) , and HSV (Yoshino and Taniguchi, 1965b) . Philipson (1966) , using a two-phase aqueous polymer system that distributes free and an tibody-bound virus in different phases, examined the interaction of poliovirus with various immunoglobulins. After a short lag, IgM an tibody bound virus irreversibly while IgG antibody, following firstorder kinetics, bound virus rapidly and irreversibly. Using a countercurrent distribution procedure with a total dilution factor of 10 18 , only a small fraction of poliovirus-antibody complexes could be dis sociated. Mandel (1961) showed that such complexes were stable for 50 days when resuspended in media without antibody. However, dissociation can occur and infectious poliovirus recovered after ex posure of the complexes to acid or alkali (Mandel, 1961) , treatment with fluorocarbon (Ketler et al., 1961 ), sonication (Keller, 1965 , or exposure to proteolytic enzymes (Keller, 1968) .\n\nThe Fc part of the immunoglobulin molecule determines many of its biologic properties (complement fixation, placental transfer, binding to certain cells) and its influence on virus neutralization has been examined indirectly by observing neutralization with Fab frag ments. The purity of Fab fragments varied in different experiments, but generally Fab was found to neutralize influenza virus (Lafferty, 1963b) , poliovirus (Vogt et al, 1964) , HSV LDV (Notkins et al., 1968) , but not adenovirus type 5 (Kjellen, 1964 (Kjellen, , 1965 .\n\nAntibody in proper amounts can agglutinate or coat virions and prevent their adsorption, as has been shown for NDV (Rubin and Franklin, 1957) and poliovirus (Mandel, 1962; Keller, 1966) . How ever, virus-antibody complexes can sometimes adsorb to host cells, although complexes containing the larger IgM do so more slowly than those containing IgG perhaps because of greater steric hin drance (Mandel, 1967) . Adsorbed complexes may penetrate more slowly and be more susceptible to further neutralization by added antisera than nonadsorbed free virus (Rubin and Franklin, 1957; Rubin, 1957; Mandel, 1962) .\n\nCorrelations between antigenic structure and neutralization have been made for several viruses, and a few examples will now be con sidered. The neutralization of adenovirus takes place in two steps, with firm initial antibody-virus binding followed by increasing inactivation (Kjellen, 1962) . Although either univalent or bivalent Fab fragments bind to adenovirus and block whole antibody HI activity, neither fragment blocks the neutralizing activity of whole antibody. Since HA is mediated by the fiber y antigen while neutralization requires interaction with the hexon e antigen, this could be ex-plained if Fab fragments bind to y but not to e. Binding of Fab frag ments of antisera prepared against capsid subunits would clarify this. Since antisera against the hexon e antigens neutralize (Wilcox and Ginsberg, 1963; Kjellen and Pereira, 1968; Philipson, 1969) while those against fibers usually do not (Kjellen and Pereira, 1968; Pettersson et al., 1968) , neutralizing antibody may not prevent adsorp tion to host cells but may alter a later step such as uncoating. Intrasubgroup heterotypic antisera neutralize adenovirus type 5 at low pH, and addition of these heterotypic sera to homotypic sera at normal pH enhances neutralization (Kjellen and Pereira, 1968) . It was suggested that low pH or the interaction of homotypic antibody with the outer aspect of hexons might expose inner sites with sub group specificity which then could react with heterotypic antibody and enhance neutralization. According to this view, conformational changes of the hexons are important in adenovirus neutralization, possibly leading to faulty uncoating and degradation in heterophagic vacuoles, as has been described for antibody-complexed NDV and vaccinia (Dales and Kajioka, 1964; Silverstein and Marcus, 1964; Dales, 1969) .\n\nFoot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is an icosohedral particle which has been shown to have three classes of antibody-binding sites (Brown and Smale, 1970) . One is a 12 S protein subunit on the faces of the particles which can be separated from the virus by heat or acid treatment and reacts only with IgG. Both sites at the vertices bind IgG and one, which is trypsin sensitive, is the only site of at tachment of IgM antibody. Neutralization studies with antisera against whole virus and adsorbed with trypsin-treated virus or 12 S subunits indicate that both vertex sites are involved in neutralization while the face site is not (Rowlands et al., 1971) .\n\nVirion glycoproteins appear to be important antigens involved in the neutralization of many viruses. The G protein of VSV is a glycoprotein forming the spikes that protrude from the virus coat and can be solubilized by detergents and purified. Antisera produced against this protein have good neutralizing activity (Kelley et al., 1972) . The envelope glycoprotein of another rhabdovirus, rabies, can also be ex tracted and purified; it can induce neutralizing antibody and protects animals against later challenge with rabies virus and offers a new form of vaccine. Cohen et al. (1972) have reported purification from HSV-infected cell of a virion glycoprotein that is capable of stimulating in rabbits monoprecipitin antisera that neu tralize HSV. Other workers have isolated envelope glycoproteins from HSV types 1 and 2 which react with type-specific neutralizing antibodies (Powell et al., 1974) . Neutralization of influenza virus results primariily from the interac tion of antibody with hemagglutinin although high concentrations of antibody to neuraminidase can neutralize some virus strains (Kilbourne et al., 1968) . Antibodies to hemagglutinin can prevent virion attachment to cells while antibodies to neuraminidase do not. Both antibodies prevent viropexis and in their presence virions remain at the cell surface (Dourmashkin and Tyrrell, 1974) . Antineuraminidase may also interfere with egress of virus from infected cells.\n\nThe capacity of \"natural antibody\" (thought to be IgM) and early immune IgM antibody to neutralize viruses is increased by reaction with the complement system. Normal human sera and rabbit early immune sera require complement to neutralize T coliphages whereas late immune sera of humans and rabbits do not (Muschel and Toussaint, 1962) . After inoculation of rabbits with HSV, early (8-day) sera contained both IgM and IgG antibodies which required complement for neutralization Taniguchi, 1964, 1965a) . Late sera contained both IgM and IgG which could neutralize HSV without complement, but complement increased the IgM neutral izing capacity and raised the neutralization rate constant but not titer of late IgG (Hampar et al., 1968) . Neutralizing antibody against rubella virus, especially IgM and early IgG, also requires comple ment (Rawls et al., 1967; Leerhoy, 1968) . The inefficiency of early and late IgM and early IgG antibody against equine arteritis virus in neutralization was not affected by complement, but an exception to the above findings is the observation that late IgG antibody to this virus is strongly dependent on complement for neutralization (Hyllseth and Pettersson, 1970; Radwan and Burger, 1973) . This finding was noted in sera from five species and is therefore probably charac teristic of the virus rather than the source of antibody.\n\nIt is not clear how complement increases neutralization. Since the antibody in early immune sera often has low avidity for virus, it is possible that the reaction with complement stabilizes the virus-an tibody complex. In the HSV system, however, the complex of virus and early sera is stable and some other mechanism must be operative (Yoshino and Taniguchi, 1965b) . These complexes can be neutral ized by late sera, so that the binding of early serum antibodies must leave crucial sites for infection exposed. The accumulation of com plement proteins on the virion surface may cover these important sites and interfere with adsorption, penetration, or uncoating; ag-gregation of virus particles can also occur .\n\nVirus-antibody complexes of HSV and equine arteritis virus ad sorbed to cell surfaces were found to be susceptible to complement during the early period of cell-complex interaction, suggesting that complement can influence a step later than adsorption (Yoshino and Taniguchi, 1967; Radwan and Burger, 1973) . Since penetration of virus-antibody complexes into cells is known to be prolonged com pared to virus alone, reaction with complement at this stage may be important.\n\nThe sequence of complement component reactions with the virusantibody complex is the same as for other antigen-antibody systems. Studies using purified components of complement and HSV or NDV complexed with early IgM have shown that C l and C4 are required for neutralization and that the effects of suboptimal amounts of C4 can be supplemented by the addition of C2 and C3 (Daniels et al., 1969 Linscott and Levinson, 1969) . Similar findings for com plement enhancement of HI activity of early IgM antibody bound to influenza virus have been reported (Reno and Hoffman, 1972) . Oldstone et al. (1974) found that complement-enhanced neutralization of polyoma virus requires C3 as well as C l , C2, and C4. Enhanced neu tralization occurred primarily by agglutination of virus-antibody complexes.\n\nElectron microscopic studies have demonstrated that avian infec tious bronchitis virus, a coronavirus with a host-derived lipid coat containing 200 A projections, can undergo complement-dependent virolysis similar to complement-dependent erythrocyte lysis (Berry and Almeida, 1968; Almeida and Waterson, 1969) . Antibody from in fected chickens reacted only with the virus-specified projections, recognizing the virion membrane as self (host-derived). However, antibody from rabbits immunized with virus grown in chickens reacted with the virion membrane and projections, whereas rabbit antibody to uninfected chicken cells reacted only with the mem brane. The neutralizing capacity of all three antisera was enhanced by complement, and electron microscopy showed complement at tached to projections when antibody was bound there and 100 A holes in the membrane after complement reacted with antibody at that site. Complement-mediated virolysis has also been described for rubella virus (Almeida and Laurence, 1969), influenza virus (Almeida and Waterson, 1969), Gross leukemogenic (AKR) virus (Oroszlan and Gilden, 1970) , and equine arteritis virus (Radwan et al., 1973) .\n\nThe preceding discussion has considered only the classical com plement activation pathway, which initially requires the conversion of C l to C l and subsequent interaction of C l with C4 and C2 before activation of C3 and the remaining components. Interest has recently turned toward an alternate pathway in which C3 is activated without interaction of the preceding three components (Osier and Sandberg, 1973) . Certain immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, after binding antigen, can activate complement by the alternate pathway. Guinea pig \u03b32 antibodies efficiently activate complement by the classic pathway in which interaction of the Fc portion of the an tibody molecule with C l is essential. However, the F(ab')2 fragments of \u03b32 immunoglobulins activate complement via the alternate path way. A. L. Sandberg (personal communication) has used F(ab')2 frag ments of anti-HSV \u03b32 to determine whether complement-dependent enhancement of HSV neutralization can occur by the alternate path way. She found that the F(ab')2 fragments bound to the virus but were not as efficient in enhancing neutralization as were the parent undigested antibodies. Furthermore, there was only minimal lysis of HSV-infected rabbit kidney cells by the alternate pathway after bind ing of the F(ab')2 fragments to the cell membrane. More viruses must be examined before conclusions can be drawn concerning the impor tance of the alternate pathway in virus neutralization, but there may be a specific requirement for the first complement components in the enhancement of neutralization of some viruses.\n\nThe in vivo consequences of complement reactions with virus-an tibody complexes are often detrimental to the host, producing arteritis, glomerulonephritis, and choroiditis (Oldstone and Dixon, 1971; . In addition, C3 bound to complexes may facil itate their attachment to macrophages, neutrophils, and B lympho cytes, which have C3 receptors. This could enhance their clearance by such cells if viral growth is restricted in them or, conversely, facil itate virus growth and spread if the cells are susceptible.\n\nThe residual infectivity of virus after exposure to excess antibody is called the persistent fraction, the presence and nature of which has been reviewed by Majer (1972) . Burnet et al. (1937) first noted the existence of a nonneutralizable fraction of an animal virus, and studies of many viruses in vitro (picornaviruses, togaviruses, myxoviruses, herpesviruses, poxviruses, and reoviruses) and in vivo (lactate dehydrogenase virus, H-l virus, Visna virus, and Aleutian mink disease virus) demonstrate the generality of the phe nomenon. That the virus in the persistent fraction is not a genetic variant was shown in studies demonstrating similar behavior of non-neutralized virus progeny and the parent population in neutral ization tests (Dulbecco et al., 1956; Notkins et al., 1966b; Hahon, 1970b; Majer and Link, 1970) .\n\nThe persistent fraction has been shown to consist of virus-an tibody complexes by physiochemical methods -density-gradient centrifugation (Kjellen, 1965) , countercurrent distribution (Philipson, 1966) , and ratezonal centrifugation . However, most studies have been based on the use of antiglobulins (Ashe and Notkins, 1966) , when antibody directed against the antiviral immunoglobulin is reacted with the virus-antibody complexes and any increase in neutralization noted. Notkins et al. (1966b) found the per sisting infectious virus in the plasma of mice infected with LDV to be in virus-antibody complexes which could be neutralized by treat ment with antisera against mouse immunoglobulins. With rabbit an tibody against HSV, Ashe and Notkins (1967) found that the persis tent fraction could be markedly reduced with antisera against rabbit immunoglobulins, although such antisera had no effect on virus not \"sensitized. \"\n\nUsing antiglobulins against various immunoglobulin classes, it has been shown that IgM, IgG, and IgA can sensitize virus. Studies of unfractionated antisera demonstrate that the sensitizing antibodies in mice infected with LDV are IgG and IgA; anti-mouse IgM did not neutralize the persistent fraction . Human an tisera to Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus, likewise, had sensitizing IgG and IgA but not IgM antibodies (Hahon, 1970b) . H a m p a r e i al. (1968) could sensitize HSV with IgM antibody from rabbit late immune sera but not from early sera.\n\nThe sites of antiglobulin interaction have been examined. Univa lent antiviral Fab fragments were found to sensitize HSV (Ashe et al., ,1969 and poliovirus (Keller, 1968 ) and anti-Fab could neu tralize sensitized VEE virus (Hahon, 1970b) , indicating that the Fab portion of the sensitizing antibody can bind to the antiglobulin and result in neutralization. The persistent fraction of VEE virus could also be neutralized with anti-allotype antiglobulin for an Fc allotype and with anti-Fc antiglobulin, demonstrating that the Fc portion can also bind the antiglobulin.\n\nVirus sensitization is generally thought to occur when antibodies are attached to noncritical sites on the virion, exposure of which is not required to initiate infection. This may hinder attachment of other antibodies to critical sites. If suboptimal amounts of antisera are reacted with virus, it is found after subsequent addition of an tiglobulin that a large fraction of virus has been sensitized but not neutralized by the antiviral antibody (Ashe and Notkins, 1967; Notkins et al., 1968) . Thus, it was found that for LDV sensitization occurs sooner than neutralization and for both LDV and HSV that as sensitization increases the neutralization constant diminishes. Presumably, antiglobulin binding to antiviral antibody at noncritical sites sterically hinders interaction of virus with cells. Accordingly, univalent antiglobulin Fab fragments neutralize sensitized virus less well than larger whole antiglobulin Notkins et al., 1968) .\n\nRheumatoid factor (RF), a human IgM with specificity for the Fc portion of aggregated or complexed IgG antibodies, has also been found to react with virus-IgG antibody complexes (Ashe et al., 1971) . Rabbit or human anti-HSV IgG antibody was reacted with HSV and then with human RF. No reduction in the persistent fraction of these HSV-IgG-RF complexes occurred unless the preparations were al lowed to react further with complement or anti-human IgM an tiglobulin. Apparently the attachment of RF provides new sites for complement reaction and attachment on the complex. If Fab frag ments of anti-HSV were used to sensitize the virus, no enhancement of neutralization was observed after reaction with complement or anti-IgM, presumably because of the inability of RF to attach to the Fab fragment. Hayashi et al. (1973) have shown that RF can bind to infected cells after they have been exposed to antiviral antibody. Whether RF plays a protective role in vivo by enhancing neutral ization of infectious virus-antibody complexes is unknown. Alterna tively, by enhancing the complement-fixing capacity of complexes it may lead to increased pathology in immune complex diseases. Mims (1964) has summarized evidence that viruses introduced into the lungs or other sites are taken up by macrophages in the local tissues and in lymph nodes, where they are demonstrable by immunofluorescence. Likewise, viruses entering the blood from the primary site of multiplication or introduced into the bloodstream (e.g., by arthropod vectors) are removed by Kupffer cells and other macrophages lining blood sinuses. Usually, the viruses cannot multi ply sufficiently well in the macrophages of adult hosts to spread to other cells which are highly susceptible, such as hepatic paren chymal cells. However, if the macrophage barrier is bypassed by ex posing liver parenchymal cells directly to infection (e.g., by injecting virus into the bile duct) a lethal infection with widespread mul tiplication of virus in parenchymal cells results. Similarly, the brain is a highly susceptible organ, and intracerebral injection of many viruses in adult animals will result in lethal infections.\n\nIf macrophages represent an important barrier to the spread of in fection there should be a relationship between the capacity of a virus to multiply in macrophages and virulence in adult animals. Such a relationship exists, and is most strikingly demonstrated where major genetic factors determine the susceptibility to infection. Bang and Warwick (1960) found that adult mice of the Princeton (PRI) strain are susceptible to lethal infection with the Nelson strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-2), whereas the C3H strain of mice is resistant. Mating experiments show that the susceptibility to infection segre gates as a single Mendelian dominant genetic factor. It was found, moreover, that cultures of hepatic or peritoneal macrophages taken from susceptible hosts support multiplication of MHV with cytopathic effects, whereas macrophages from resistant mice do not. This interesting observation showed that inherited resistance is a property of individual macrophages, manifested in vitro in the ab sence of an acquired immune response. Observations on other MHV strains also emphasize the relationship between virulence and the capacity of viruses to multiply in macrophages. Thus, the avirulent strain MHV-1 does not multiply in macrophages, whereas the viru lent strain MHV-3, which after intraperitoneal injection into adult mice of most strains produces a lethal hepatitis, multiplies readily in mouse peritoneal macrophages with giant cell formation (Fig. 15 ) (Allison and Mallucci, 1965) . Only the A strain of mice resists infec tion with MHV-3 as adults, and cultures of peritoneal macrophages from this strain again show no cytopathic effects after exposure to MHV-3 (J. L. Virelizier and A. C. Allison, unpublished observations, 1974) .\n\nParallelism between inherited resistance of mice to viruses and the capacity of their mononuclear phagocytes to support virus mul tiplication is not confined to the murine hepatitis viruses. Another system that has been analyzed in detail is the inherited resistance against arthropod-borne viruses of the B group. Sabin (1954) found that the striking difference in susceptibility of HSVS and PRI mice to yellow fever virus is determined by a single pair of genes, with resis tance dominant. The PRI mice also show marked resistance to other flaviviruses. This resistance is not a general one to all types of virus; in fact, the PRI mice which are resistant to flaviviruses are highly susceptible to MHV-2, and the two resistance factors segregate in- dependently among the offspring of hybrids (Kantoch et al, 1963) . It was shown by Goodman and Koprowski (1962) that macrophages from susceptible mice support multiplication of flaviviruses very ef ficiently, whereas macrophages from resistant mice do not. Similar observations have subsequently been made in Koprowski's labora tory on mice congenic for the resistance gene. B. Rager-Zisman and A. C. Allison (unpublished observations, 1974) have found that encephalomyocarditis virus, which is virulent in adult mice, can repli cate in macrophages. Hence, there is little doubt that the capacity of a virus to multiply in macrophages is an important aspect of viru lence, but not of course the only one.\n\nIt was also found (Zisman et al, 1969 ) that the resistance of weanling mice to intraperitoneal injection of herpes simplex virus could be broken down by injections of silica particles or of rabbit anti-mouse macrophage serum. Both these treatments lead to rapid mortality beginning 5 days after infection, with high titers of virus in the liver and virus-induced hepatic necrosis. This is the result ex-pected if the Kupffer cell barrier to the spread of virus had been broken down. In contrast, anti-lymphocytic serum resulted in a later mortality with lower concentrations of virus in the liver and no hepa titis, but a higher viremia and encephalitis. This might be expected if there was a slow buildup of virus in the blood, owing to failure of an acquired immune response, with secondary spread across the bloodbrain barrier.\n\nFrom all these observations we conclude that macrophages are im portant in preventing spread of viruses from primary sites of infec tion to highly susceptible cells, such as those of the liver paren chyma or brain. As will be discussed next, macrophages of newborn animals carry out this function very inefficiently, but the capacity to contain virus infections and prevent spread to susceptible cells ma tures rapidly during the first few weeks of postnatal life in mice.\n\nAllison and his colleagues have analyzed the role of the macro phage barrier to the spread of viruses and its development in new born animals. Experiments with herpes simplex virus in mice can be used to illustrate the point, which probably applies also to many viruses as well as to other intracellular infections. Intraperitoneal inoculation of newborn mice with herpes simplex virus is followed by rapid spread of virus to the viscera, encephalitis, and death, whereas similar injections into weanling or adult mice result in no viral spread to the liver or brain and no morbidity or mortality. The resistance to intraperitoneal infection develops rapidly during the first few weeks of life. Transfers of peritoneal macrophages from adult CBA to syngeneic suckling mice were able to confer a large measure of protection against intraperitoneal infection with herpesvirus; similar transfers of peritoneal lymphocytes from adult animals were without any protective effect (Hirsch et al., 1970) . Further studies showed that the adult macrophages, particularly when stimu lated by prior injections of proteose-peptone, were much more ef ficient at taking up and preventing the spread of virus than macro phages from suckling animals, whether stimulated or not. This was reflected in the diminished capacity of infected adult macrophages to establish infectious centers when cultured together with susceptible cells, and similar findings were reported by Johnson (1964) .\n\nIn addition to this diminished capacity of adult macrophages to transfer virus to contiguous cells, which for various reasons was thought not to be due to release of interferon and the basis of which is still not well defined, adult macrophages may replicate the virus less well than macrophages from neonates. This view is reinforced by studies of Stevens and Cook (1971a) showing that herpes simplex virus in adult mouse macrophages undergoes an abortive cycle of replication, with synthesis of virus nucleic acids and antigens, and the formation of nascent capsids lacking dense cores, in the nucleus. Hence, a late stage of herpesvirus synthesis, perhaps involving DNA metabolism or nucleocapsid formation, appears to be blocked in adult mouse macrophages.\n\nThe human counterpart to these experiments is the severe, gener alized infection which herpes simplex virus produces in newborn children (Wheeler and Huffines, 1965; Nahmias et al., 1969) . Usually this is herpesvirus type 2 acquired during childbirth from a maternal genital infection; occasionally it is type 1 infection. The virus dis seminates widely, to the central nervous system, liver and other organs, and administration of antibody has not provided any demon strable protection. The great majority of children die. Immaturity of macrophages in the human newborn may well be an important con tributory factor allowing the dissemination of the infection. That the Kupffer cell barrier is poorly developed in human fetuses and newborns is suggested by involvement of hepatic parenchymal cells in congenital rubella infections; this is not seen in adult cases of rubella (Stern and Williams, 1966) . Rager-Zisman and Allison (1973b) also found that newborn mice could be protected from intraperitoneal inoculation of Coxsackie B virus by syngeneic adult peritoneal exudate cells; the presence of very small amounts of antibody in creased the protective effects.\n\nMaturation of macrophage virucidal capacity during the first few weeks of life may be linked to cell-mediated immunity and stimula tion with bacterial or other antigens. The work of Mackaness (1970) and others suggests that a lymphocyte-mediated immune response increases the capacity of macrophages to kill organisms unrelated to those providing the antigenic stimulus. reported that macrophages taken later from neonatally thymectomized animals support the multiplication of the avirulent virus MHV-1, whereas the virus multiplies to a very limited extent in macrophages from intact adult animals. This work has been continued using the more virulent MHV-3 strain of virus in genetically resistant A strain mice; they suc cumb to MHV-3 if infected soon after birth or if they are neonatally thymectomized and infected as adults (Dupuy et al., 1973; Levy-Leblond and Dupuy, 1974) .\n\nThe latter investigators and J. L. Virelizier and A. C. Allison (un published observations, 1974) have found that peritoneal macro phages taken from neonatally thymectomized mice support the mul tiplication of the virus, with giant cell formation, whereas those from normal mice of the same age do not. Also, TXBM mice of the resis tant A strain when tested 2 weeks after thymus deprivation are resis tant to MHV-3 and no virus replication was observed in cultures of peritoneal macrophages from such animals. However, when similar mice were tested 3 months after thymus deprivation, at a time when most macrophages present probably have developed in an environ ment deficient in T lymphocytes and putative thymic hormones, they were found to be susceptible to MHV-3 infection and peritoneal macrophages replicated the virus in vitro.\n\nMacrophages from thymus-deprived mice have generally been thought to be normal. However, the above observations demonstrate that at least one property of \"mature\" macrophages, virucidal capac ity, depends on the presence of the thymus and/or T lymphocytes during at least some of their development. Other macrophage func tions, such as participation in granuloma formation, are deficient in newborn and neonatally thymectomized mice (Yang and Skinsnes, 1973) . However, transfer experiments with macrophages from these animals are necessary before conclusions can be made concerning the role of T lymphocytes (which is established) and the developmental dependence of these macrophages on the thymus and T cells. Exper iments demonstrating the inability of macrophages from newborn animals to participate in immune responses in vivo (see Hardy et al., 1973) should be reexamined with this possibility in mind.\n\nMany viruses have envelopes derived from host cell membranes and all viruses are intimately related to host cell membranes during adsorption, penetration, and replication. This can lead to profound changes in the cell membrane as well as the basic physiology and behavior of the cell and its relationship to its environment (see review by Allison, 1971) . Infection with most viruses results in cell membrane alterations that can be detected by the appearance of new antigens and sometimes as a change in the ability to bind particular lectins or other materials. Table III lists viruses now known to produce antigenic changes in host membranes as detected biologi cally in transplantation studies or directly by immunofluorescence, immunoradiolabeling, immunoelectron microscopy, and assays em ploying cytotoxic antibody or lymphoid cells. It should be noted that the antisera used in many assays were produced by active infection with the virus, and antigenic changes may represent virus-induced host cell alterations and not antigens the structures of which are en coded in the virus genome.\n\nMost of the surface antigens appear early in infection. Thus, cells infected with influenza virus produce viral protein in 1 hour (Noll, 1962) and virus-specific cell surface antigens are detectable 4 hours after infection (Hahon and Eckert, 1972) . New surface antigens ap pear on cells infected by NDV at 3 hours, VEE and Sindbis viruses at 4 hours, vaccinia virus at 4 hours, HSV at 6 hours, and measles, rinderpest, and canine distemper viruses at 20 to 24 hours. Studies with protein and nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors have demonstrated that new protein must be synthesized before the antigens are detect able (i.e., the antigens are not adsorbed virions) but that nucleic acid synthesis is not usually required. Thus the antigenic changes proba bly represent early functions of the virus genome. An apparent ex ception is the transplantation rejection antigen (TRA) produced by SV40 infection, which does not appear in lytic infection but appears late in the transformation of nonpermissive cells (Smith and Mora, 1972) .\n\nInfection by some viruses produces no detectable surface antigens. Picornaviruses, although associated with cytoplasmic membranes during development, do not bud through membranes and lack mem brane envelopes. Perhaps significantly in this regard, they also lack carbohydrates which, in those viruses containing carbohydrates, are attached to virus proteins while the latter are embedded in host membranes. Cells infected by Coxsackie B5 virus (a picornavirus) have no surface antigens detectable by immunofluorescence or radiolabeling (Hayashi et al., 1973) . A strain of vaccinia virus has been reported which does not produce a major surface antigen normally found early during infection (Ito and Barron, 1972b) .\n\nMost cells transformed by the Moloney variant of murine sarcoma virus (MSC) also produce helper murine leukemogenic virus and possess surface antigens specified by the latter virus. A few MSVtransformed cell lines not producing helper virus are available and Strouk et al. (1972) could not detect virus-specific surface antigens Klein, 1962 Geering et al., 1966 Aoki et al, 1970 Shirai et al, 1971 Stockert et al, 1971 Proffitt et al, 1973 Nishioka et al, 1969 Oshiro et al, 1971 Boone et al, 1973 Gelderblom et al, 1972 Kurth and Bauer, 1972 Gelderblom and Bauer, 1973 Phillips and Perdue, 1974 Duc-Nguyen et al, 1966 Brier et al, 1971 Hahon and Eckert, 1972 Duc-Nguyen and Rosenblum, 1967 Speel et al, 1968 Eaton and Scala, 1969 Holmes et al, 1969 Yamanouchi et al, 1970 Rustigian et al, 1971 Labowskie et al, 1974 Epsmark, 1965 Mantani and Hahon, 1970a Catanzaro et al, 1974 B\u00fcrge and Pfefferkorn, 1967 McFarland, 1974 Catanzaro et al, 1974 Fernandes et al, 1964 Wiktor et al, 1968 Lundstedt, 1969 Oldstone et al, 1969 Wright et al, 1972 Marker and Volkert, 1973 Zinkernagel and Doherty, 1974 Alford, 1969 Vasconcelos-Costa, 1970 Vasconcelos-Costa et al, 1973 O'Dea and Dineen, 1957 Roane and Roizman, 1964 Epsmark, 1965 Nii et al, 1968 Brier et al, 1971 Lowry et al, 1971 Nahmias et al, 1971 Ito and Barron, 1972a Smith et al, 1972 Gershon et al, 1974 Th\u00e9 and Langenhuysen, 1972 Klein et al, 1968 Dunkel and Zeigel, 1970 Chen and Purchase, 1970 Miyamoto and Kato, 1968 Ueda et al, 1969 Brier et al, 1971 Hayashi et al, 1972 Ito and Barron, 1972b Ishimoto and Ito, 1969 Tompkins et al, 1970b Smith et al, 1970 Ting and Herberman, 1970 Wright and Law, 1971 Kedar et al, 1972 Irlin, 1967 Malmgren et al, 1968 Ting and Herberman, 1970 \" Key: CT, antibody + complement cytotoxicity; IA, immune adherence; IEM, immunoelectron microscopy; IF, immunofluorescence; LC, lymphocyte-mediated cyto toxicity; RI, radioimmunoassay. on such cells using hemadsorption and lymphocyte cytotoxicity assays. Stephenson and Aaronson (1972) failed to detect transplanta tion antigens on similar cell lines, but Law and Ting (1970) did find transplantation antigens and the issue is not settled.\n\nSome virus-induced surface antigens are thought to be virus coded but are not found in the virion. Gross leukemogenic virus produces a variety of antigens in infected cells , among which are nonvirion surface antigens (GCSAa and GCSAb). Similarly, the transplantation antigens of adenoviruses, SV40, and polyoma virus have not been identified in virions.\n\nSome recognizable new surface antigens probably result from un masking of antigenic substructure already present or derepression of host genes. Cells of a hamster kidney line (BHK) which normally have no demonstrable Forssman antigen acquired it after transforma tion with SV40, polyoma virus, or Rous sarcoma virus (Fogel and Sachs, 1962; O'Neill, 1968; Robertson and Black, 1969 ).\n\nThe appearance on transformed cells of accessible receptors for lectins, glycoproteins from plants and invertebrates capable of agglu tinating certain cells by binding with particular carbohydrates, may also represent an unmasking phenomenon or rearranging of mem brane components. Burger (1973) has reviewed the subject and it ap pears that lectin receptors on normal and transformed cells may be present in equal amounts. Virus transformation or mild treatment of normal cells with proteases does not lead directly to clustering of lectin-binding receptors, but does increase the mobility of lectinbinding sites which can cluster in the presence of multivalent lectins (Rosenblith et al, 1973) .\n\nEven so, there are demonstrable changes in the concentrations of membrane components and related enzymes during the transforma tion process (Brady et al., 1973) . Sialic acid levels were found to be reduced in SV40 (Wu et al., 1968) and polyoma virus (Ohta et al., 1968) transformed cells when compared to parental cells; there is usually a reduction in higher ganglioside homologues as well (Brady and Mora, 1970) . The higher gangliosides are formed by the sequen tial addition of various hexose moieties and sialic acid and is mediated by transferase enzymes. An examination of one transferase involved has revealed it to be markedly reduced in most SV40 and polyoma virus transformed cells (Brady et al., 1973) . Viral alterations in en zymes concerned with membrane biosynthesis and structure (such as ganglioside transferases) might alter phenotypic expression in much the same way as the lysogenic conversion of Salmonella by e phage (Robbins and Uchida, 1965) .\n\nThe appearance on cells infected with HSV of a receptor that binds the Fc portion of rabbit or human IgG molecules has been reported Yasuda and Milgrom, 1968; Shimizu, 1971; Westmoreland and Watkins, 1974) . The Fc receptor appeared on the surfaces of all infected cells tested, including fibroblasts and epithe lial cells from mice, hamsters, monkeys, and humans. Receptors ap peared on HeLa cells within 4 hours after infection and at 11 hours after infection an estimated 5 X 10 4 molecules of IgG per cell bound to the cell membrane during 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Experiments with actinomycin D and puromycin suggested an early need for RNA syn thesis after infection and for continuing synthesis of receptors. No evidence was obtained to suggest unmasking of Fc receptors already present in a cryptic form. Antisera against uninfected host cells or HSV blocked the subsequent attachment of immunoglobulin to the infected cells. This could be due to steric hindrance or the Fc receptor might contain host and viral antigenic determinants; a viral protein glycosylated by host enzymes and functioning as an Fc re ceptor could have this characteristic. It is not known whether the virus codes for a protein which is the receptor itself or which can be glycosylated by cellular enzymes and resemble the Fc receptor known to be present on macrophages, neutrophils, B lymphocytes, and possibly some T lymphocytes. Alternatively, infection could result in derepression of the appropriate host gene(s) controlling syn thesis of the receptor. This latter possibility is intriguing in view of recent suggestions that the Fc receptor is a product of the Ir gene complex. Since these genes control some immune responses, infec tion of lymphocytes by viruses that activate genes in this complex might affect immune responses or perhaps permit autoimmune responses.\n\nVirus infections can result not only in the appearance of \" n e w \" host antigens, but also in the diminution of normal membrane an tigens. Hecht and Summers (1972) found a 70% reduction in the capacity of VSV-infected mouse cells to adsorb cytolytic antibodies directed against H-2 antigen. This was not due to inhibition of pro tein synthesis as treatment of cells with cycloheximide for a similar time period did not reduce the H-2 concentration, nor did infection with encephalomyocarditis virus which inhibits host protein synthe sis. Whether other cell antigens, particularly tumor antigens, will behave similarly during infection merits examination. At least one tumor antigen is known to cocap and thus to be linked with H-2 an tigen and conceivably may be altered by those factors influencing H-2 density (Gooding and Edidin, 1974) . Recently, Hecht and Summers (1974) reported that NDV-infected L (mouse) cells lose 50% of their H-2 antigen.\n\nThe polar redistribution (capping) of surface immunoglobulins (Taylor et al., 1971) and receptors for immune complexes on lymphocytes and of transplantation antigens on a variety of cell types (Kourilsky et al., 1972) has been reported by many laboratories and much speculation concerning its physiological im portance has arisen. Joseph and have described cap ping of measles virus antigen on infected HeLa cells; it required ac tive cell metabolism and multivalent antibody. Capping has also been observed for mumps antigen on infected cells (K. Hayashi, per sonal communication) and for gs-1 and gs-3 antigens on Gross virusinduced leukemic cells (Yoshiki et al., 1974a) and may be a general phenomenon for virus-specific cell surface antigens.\n\nCapping of viral antigens on the surface of infected cells could have a number of consequences. If viral nucleocapsids must align themselves beneath membrane containing viral proteins before bud ding (e.g., myxoviruses), capping could interfere with viral mor phogenesis and release. Alteration of the density of viral antigens on the cell surface might result in ineffective interaction of the cell with lymphocytes or of the attached antibody with com plement (Brier et al., 1971) . Some nonlytic infections thus protected from effective immune responses might persist.\n\nA phenomenon similar to capping that results in reversible losses of surface antigens, termed antigenic modulation, can also occur. A host antigen, the TL (thymus-leukemia) antigen in mice, is an organspecific allotypic determinant on thymocytes of certain mouse strains with its genetic locus near the D end of the H-2 locus (Boyse et al., 1965; Boyse and Old, 1969) . Leukemias induced by leukemogenic viruses in the TL-positive mouse strains result in the appearance of the TL antigen on leukemic cells. If such leukemic cells are trans planted to TL-negative animals previously immunized with TL an tigen and producing antibody to it, the antigen is quickly lost from the cell surface but can reappear if the leukemic cells are trans planted back to a TL-positive host (lacking antibody to TL). Phenotypic expression of TL was found to markedly reduce the demonstra ble quantity of H-2 antigens, especially those specified by the D region. With loss of TL by antigen modulation, an increase in the H-2 antigens was observed ). An tigenic modulation for the GCSAa antigen of leukemic cells, which appears to be coded by the Gross leukemia virus rather than the host, has also been reported .\n\nRecent experiments by Zinkernagel and Doherty (1974) raise the interesting possibility that some virus-induced surface antigens may be combinations of virus and host material. These investigators re ported that lymphocytes from LCM-infected mice are capable of mediating a cytotoxic reaction only with infected target cells which share similarity at either the K or D region of the H-2 locus. The reactive lymphocytes were sensitive to anti-0 and complement and thus are T lymphocytes. (It should be mentioned that found no such H-2 requirement in a similar system.) R. V. Blanden (personal communication) has obtained similar results using ectromelia virus. One explanation for this phenomenon is that the in teraction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes with somatic cells requires an intimate contact that is strongly dependent on some degree of histocompatibility, as is suggested for the interaction of helper T lym phocytes and B lymphocytes (Katz et al., 1973a,b) . An alternative explanation is that the immune lymphocytes recognize a composite antigen consisting of virus protein and H-2 material, or that the virus infection results in altered H-2 antigens that are no longer recog nized by the lymphocytes as \"self.\"\n\nOver the past couple of decades knowledge of the structure of an tibodies and their protective and pathological roles in immunity have been well defined. Currently, much interest is centered on under standing lymphoid cells and cell-mediated immunity. Various methods have been used to illustrate the presence of cell-mediated immunity against virus-specific antigens. Each has its own advan tages and limitations. Although delayed hypersensitivity to many viruses or viral antigens has been demonstrated, it must be in terpreted with caution. For example, some reactions are elicited by antigens from the heterologous cells in which viruses are grown. An tibody-mediated reactions to replicating antigens may be maximal between 24 and 72 hours after intradermal inoculation; even the histology may be ambiguous. Of the in vitro tests for cell-mediated immunity, M IF production correlates better with delayed hypersen sitivity than does blast transformation (David and Schlossman, 1968; Rocklin et al., 1970) . With peptides of tobacco mosaic virus and glucagon, delayed skin reactions correlated with the production of MIF by lymphoid cells in vitro, but not always with the stimulation of DNA synthesis on the exposure of host lymphocytes to the an tigens (Spider et al, 1970; Senyk et al, 1971) . It seems that MIF production is a particularly good in vitro correlate of delayed hyper sensitivity in guinea pigs, but attempts to obtain MIF production with cells from other species, including man, have not been easily reproducible in all laboratories.\n\nMany studies of lymphocyte stimulation by viruses have been per formed, but for the most part they have been inadequately con trolled to exclude the possible involvement of host cell antigens and to characterize the participating cells. The manner of antigen presen tation-whether infected cells or virus, infectious or inactivated -can determine the type and extent of response obtained. The blastogenic response primarily represents antigenic recognition by lymphocytes, and Gershon et al (1973) have found that for T lymphocytes this may not correlate with the development of recognized T lymphocyte functions. The lymphocyte cytotoxicity assays represent eifector functions as well as antigen recognition (Bach et al., 1973) and may be complicated by factors (such as immune complexes) that influ ence either of these functions.\n\nWhat is considered cell-mediated immunity in the animal is a complex multicomponent phenomenon involving functionally dif ferent lymphocyte populations as well as macrophages, K cells and antibodies, soluble mediators, and other factors. Obviously, to assay one component of this process in vitro is rather artificial, and all in vitro assays must be interpreted with caution. Even so, from these investigations some useful generalizations are beginning to emerge. Sensitization of T lymphocytes in virus infections is an early event, being demonstrable 3 to 7 days after infection, reaching a peak of cy totoxic reactivity at 7 to 14 days and then falling to near background levels. A population of memory cells, not themselves cytotoxic but able to generate cytotoxic eifector cells, then persists for weeks or months. The finding of stimulated DNA synthesis by lymphocytes in the presence of virus antigen does not necessarily imply T lympho cyte sensitization, especially in secondary responses where B lym phocyte proliferation may predominate.\n\nThis section can consider this large subject only in outline form. Evidence for delayed hypersensitivity (DH) to virus antigens will be briefly mentioned and the in vitro correlates summarized.\n\nIn 1907, von Pirquet suggested that hypersensitivity contributes to the local inflammatory lesion of primary vaccinia, and vaccinia virus has continued to be used in studies of DH. Broom (1947) demon strated in humans that prevaccination lesions can occur in the ab sence of specific antibody and Turk et al. (1962) , by injecting virusantiserum mixtures, produced typical DH reactions in guinea pigs without demonstrable humoral antibody. Allison (1967) could pas sively transfer DH against vaccinia in inbred guinea pigs with peri toneal exudate cells but not with serum. Pincus and Flick (1963) used anti-mononuclear cell antisera to inhibit local vaccinia skin lesions in guinea pigs.\n\nIn vitro studies have shown that lymphoid cells from humans im munized with vaccinia can respond specifically to antigenic chal-lenge by generating MIF (Tompkins et al., 1970a) . Spleen and peripheral blood lymphocytes from vaccinia-infected rabbits, when exposed to UV-inactivated vaccinia, were found to incorporate up to thirty times as much thymidine into their DNA as appropriate con trols (Rosenberg et al., 1972a) . This stimulation was observed from 3 to at least 120 days after infection and was at its peak during the sec ond week of infection. Elfenbein and Rosenberg (1973) have sub sequently shown that both T and B lymphocytes participate in this proliferation. Using heat-inactivated vaccinia virus, Epstein et al. (1972) have demonstrated transformation and interferon production by human lymphocytes from immune donors.\n\nThis poxvirus of mice, which cross-reacts with vaccinia virus, pro duces a severe and often fatal disease. Fenner (1949) showed that there is an allergic component as measured by swelling of the foot on challenge with live virus at various times after primary infection. The allergy was first seen on the seventh day and increased in mag nitude thereafter. Since generalized infection of the skin occurs on the sixth day, Fenner considered it unlikely that allergy played an important part in localizing virus in the skin. However, more recent studies by Blanden (1970 Blanden ( , 1971 ) have further defind the role of cellmediated immunity to this virus in vivo. Gardner et al. (1974) have used a chromium-release cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay with infected L cells as target cells to study the generation of immune lymphocytes after infection. Mouse spleen cells showed cytotoxic activity 2 days after immunization and this activity peaked at 6 days before declining to low levels by day 10. This activity was not diminished by the removal of macrophages or the addition of antisera to ectromelia or by exogenous interferon, but was abrogated by prior treatment of the lymphocytes with anti-# an tibody and complement and thus is mediated by T lymphocytes.\n\nWhen inoculated into the skin of adult domestic rabbits, this pox virus induces a rapidly growing tumor that subsequently regresses. Intradermal challenge with virus on the fifth day produced DH reac tions (Allison, 1966; Allison and Friedman, 1966) . In vitro produc tion of MIF can also be elicited from lymphocytes obtained 5 days after virus inoculation (Tompkins et al., 1970a) .\n\nHSV can elicit D H reactions in a large proportion of adults and a lower proportion of children (Nagler, 1944; Rose and Molloy, 1947; Anderson and Kilbourne, 1961) . D H to HSV in guinea pigs was dem onstrated by Brown (1953) and later Lausch et al. (1966) showed that D H could be induced by a single injection of infective HSV. The skin reaction can be elicited by a soluble antigen (Anderson and Kil bourne, 1961; Jawetz et al., 1951 Jawetz et al., , 1955 , and recently Rogers et al. (1972) demonstrated that D H can be induced in guinea pigs with a soluble antigen. It will be interesting to determine if D H can be in duced and/or elicited with the glycoprotein recently shown to be a neutralizing antigen for HSV (Cohen et al., 1972; Powell et al., 1974) .\n\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that inactivated HSV can stimulate DNA synthesis in sensitized lymphocytes (Rosenberg et al., 1972a) and differentiate type 1 and type 2 virus (Rosenberg et al., 1972b) . Gerber and Lucas (1972) have shown that peripheral blood lym phocytes from previously infected subjects are stimulated to incorpo rate thymidine by UV-inactivated EB virus whereas lymphocytes from seronegative subjects are not stimulated.\n\nIt has already been noted that the various in vitro tests purporting to demonstrate cell-mediated immunity may depend crucially on the manner of antigen presentation and may reflect different functions of lymphocytes. The former point is well demonstrated in the report of Thurman et al. (1973) concerning MIF production and transforma tion of lymphocytes from CMV-infected patients after exposure of the lymphocytes to virus or to virus-infected cells. The lymphocytes from CMV-infected patients responded by production of MIF when cultured with purified virus but were transformed only by culture with CMV-infected cell lines. Virus-specific antigens on the virion surface and the membranes of infected cells probably differ quantita tively and qualitatively, and may elicit different lymphocyte responses or stimulate different lymphocyte populations.\n\nBeveridge and Burnet (1944) found skin hypersensitivity of the D H type with influenza virus. Interestingly, they stated that live attenuated virus administered intranasally was more effective in in ducing skin hypersensitivity than killed virus vaccine injected subcutaneously. Mice inoculated with inactivated influenza virus devel oped cell-mediated immunity as shown by in vitro tests (Feinstone et al, 1969) . Hellman et al. (1972) reported the stimulation by PR8 influenza virus of thymidine incorporation into spleen cells of sensi tized mice, beginning 7 days after infection and peaking at 14 days before declining. M I F assays have been employed by Wetherbee (1973) to demonstrate systemic cell-mediated responses in guinea pigs infected intranasally with influenza virus. Gadol et al. (1974) compared MIF production by lymphocytes from bronchial washes or spleens of guinea pigs infected intranasally or by the footpad route. Intranasal infection led to MIF production predominantly by lung lymphocytes whereas parenteral inoculation resulted mainly in sys temic immunity.\n\n1. M U M P S VIRUS Enders et al. (1945) demonstrated dermal hypersensitivity to mumps virus and positive reactions were related to immunity. DH has been produced in guinea pigs with mumps virus (Glasgow and Morgan, 1957) and Speel et al. (1968) showed that spleen cells from mice immunized with mumps virus are toxic to Chang cells persis tently infected with mumps. Lymphocytes from mice infected with mumps virus have been shown to produce MIF in vitro (Feinstone et al., 1969) . Using inactivated mumps virus, Smith et al. (1972) have demonstrated stimulation of DNA synthesis in human lymphocytes after primary exposure and for up to 40 years after primary exposure and correlated this with delayed skin sensitivity.\n\nSkin testing with measles virus has been complicated by contami nating antigens derived from cells used to culture the virus (Isacson, 1968) . A number of in vitro assays have been employed to assess cell-mediated immunity to measles virus and the closely related agent of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). A colony-inhibition assay used lymphocytes from monkeys infected with measles virus and BSC-1 cells persistently infected with the virus (Rustigian et al., 1971) . Labowskie et al. (1974) reported that lym phocytes from seropositive individuals were capable of morpho logical destruction and lysis of cell lines persistently infected with measles. This reaction could be blocked by pretreatment of the target cells with antisera to measles. Thurman et al. (1973) and Ahmed et al. (1974) reported that lymphocytes from seropositive individuals produced M I F and lymphotoxin on exposure to purified measles virus, but interestingly, blastogenic responses did not occur on exposure of the lymphocytes to virus preparations but, as with CMV, were elicited when the lymphocytes were cultured with virusinfected cells.\n\nThere has been much controversy concerning the nature of cellmediated immunity in general and to measles antigens or virus in particular in patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. There are reports of diminished lymphocyte responses to PHA (Kolar, 1968 ) and lack of normal dermal hypersensitivity reactions to common test antigens as well as delayed rejection of skin allografts (Gerson and Haslam, 1971 ). However, Jabbour et al. (1969) found all of eight patients tested to have normal skin responses to Candida and two of three patients could be sensitized to dichloronitrobenzene. J. F. Soothill (private communication) has found normal lym phocyte responses to PHA in eight cases. Normal in vitro cellmediated immunity to antigens other than measles was reported for twenty cases (Moulias et al., 1971) . A generalized defect in cellmediated immunity is therefore not established.\n\nTwo reports on five patients with SSPE confirm normal reactivity of lymphocytes from SSPE patients in M I F and lymphotoxin-release assays using virus preparations of measles or the SSPE agent as the antigen, or in transformation assays using SSPE-infected cells as the stimulant Ahmed et al., 1974) . A blocking factor found in high concentration in the cerebrospinal fluids of SSPE patients and in lesser concentration in their sera was found to block the reactions of lymphocytes from SSPE patients and normal seropositive individuals in the MIF, lymphotoxin-release, and trans formation assays specifically for the SSPE agent and not against other antigens Ahmed et al, 1974) . This factor is heatlabile, larger than MW 150,000, sensitive to the actions of trypsin and neuraminidase, neutralized by rheumatoid factor, and may be an an tigen-antibody complex.\n\nUsing the lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity assay of Labowskie et al. (1974) , J. A. Bellanti and his colleagues (personal communication) have confirmed the normal reactivity of lymphocytes from seven SSPE patients against measles-infected cells. These workers also found specific blocking factors in the sera of these patients. In con clusion it appears that SSPE patients have the capacity to mount cellmediated immune responses in general and to measles-SSPE virus antigens in particular, but reaction to the latter are thwarted by blocking factors, possibly immune complexes, that are found pre dominantly in the CSF.\n\nCell-mediated responses to murine leukemias have been recog nized for years. However, congenital infections by the murine leu kemia viruses formerly were thought to result in tolerance to the virus antigens and only recently has circulating antibody to these viruses been demonstrated. The concept of \"split tolerance\" in which humoral responses are not accompanied by cell-mediated responses was then suggested. Recently, Proffitt et al. (1973) pre sented evidence for cell-mediated immunity in carrier C3H mice for Moloney leukemia virus. Lymphocytes from such animals mediated cytotoxic reactions against syngeneic cells infected with Moloney leukemia virus but not against uninfected cells. Wahren and Metcalf (1970) had reported similar results using C3H carrier mice (for Mo loney MuLV) and embryo cell cultures from these mice as target cells; lymphocytes from normal C3H mice were not cytotoxic for these target cells. The latter investigators also reported cytotoxic reactions of lymphocytes from preleukemic AKR mice for cell monolayers of AKR embryos or of AKR thymic epithelial cells. Many tissues of AKR mice are known to possess Gross MuLV antigens and these target cells probably possessed viral antigens since the cyto toxic reaction was prevented by pretreatment of the target cells with antisera to Gross cell surface antigens. At variance with the above studies, Chieco-Bianchi et al. (1974) have reported no cytotoxic reac tions between spleen lymphocytes from adult C57BL/6 mice in fected neonatally with Moloney MuLV and syngeneic Moloney MuLV-infected target cells. Differences in the production of the virus carrier state and in the cytotoxic assays employed may account for this discrepancy. In this last study a chromium-release assay was used while in the previous studies a microcytotoxicity assay (similar to colony inhibition assays) was used and important differences in these assays are known (Biesecker et al., 1973; Bloom et al., 1973) .\n\nBeginning a few days after footpad inoculation of mice with Sindbis virus, lymphocytes from draining nodes and spleen un derwent blastogenesis after exposure to the virus (Griffin and Johnson, 1973) . This sensitivity peaked 6 days after infection and re turned to control levels by 16 days. Lysis of infected syngeneic mouse embryo cells by immune lymphocytes followed a similar but slightly shorter time course (McFarland, 1974) . This latter function was sensitive to treatment with anti-0 antisera and complement and thus probably represents a T lymphocyte activity.\n\nStimulation of spleen lymphocytes from immune mice by Vene zuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) was reported by Adler and Rabinowitz (1973) . The reactivity of lymphocytes from mice re ceiving one immunizing dose of virus was abolished by treatment with anti-0 sera and complement, while that of lymphocytes from mice receiving two immunizing doses was not. Reactivity of the latter lymphocytes was sensitive to treatment with antisera against mouse immunoglobulin plus complement. These results suggest that after primary immunization antigen recognition and proliferation in the immune spleen cell population are due to T lymphocytes while after secondary immunization the reactive cells are predominantly B lymphocytes. These findings are in agreement with those of Elfen bein and Rosenberg (1973) for vaccinia virus.\n\nA chromium-release assay using persistently infected BHK cells has been described and only peripheral blood lymphocytes from seropositive subjects were cytotoxic in this assay (Steele et al., 1973) . Smith et al. (1973) have described an assay to measure the blas togenic responses of human lymphocytes after exposure to rubella antigen. Using a similar assay Lee and Sigel (1974) examined the influence of immune complexes on the blastogenic responses of blood lymphocytes from immune rabbits after exposure to inac tivated rubella virus. The response was not altered by the presence of complexes of virus and anti-rubella IgG but virus complexes with anti-rubella IgM were markedly inhibitory. Normal IgM mixed with rubella virus or anti-rubella IgM mixed with poliovirus or influenza virus had no effect. In a study with HSV (Rosenberg et al., 1972a) hyperimmune sera mixed with HSV did not inhibit blastogenesis; anti-HSV antibodies in this sera probably were of the IgG class. Examination of the effects on immune responses of virus-antibody complexes with attention to antibody class will be of especial inter est with measles virus and the SSPE agent.\n\nThere is considerable evidence for in vivo cell-mediated responses after infection of adult rodents with LCM virus (Lehmann-Grube, 1971; Cole, 1974) . For example, Tosolini and Mims (1971) described the time course of the development of D H reactions in acutely in fected mice by using the footpad test. In vitro assays have employed persistently infected L cells as target cells for immune lymphocytes. Benson (1962) first showed that immune spleen lymphocytes inhib ited the adherence and growth of infected L cells, and this phenom enon was studied in more detail by Lundstedt (1969) . Similar studies demonstrating cytotoxic effects of immune lymphocytes have em ployed the Hellstrom method (Wright et al., 1972) and chromiumrelease assays (Oldstone et al., 1969; Marker and Volkert, 1973; Zinkernagel and Doherty, 1974) . have demonstrated that the immune lymphocytes responsible for this specific cytotoxicity are sensitive to anti-0 antisera and complement. Effector activity appears a few days after infection, peaks at 10 days, and then falls sharply off-a pattern similar to that after infection with ectromelia virus or Sindbis virus.\n\nRecent reports from three laboratories indicate that the immune spleen cells obtained early during infection differ from late immune spleen cells (Mims and Blanden, 1972; Johnson et al., 1974; Volkert et al., 1974) . The former cells, in addition to being cytotoxic in in vitro assays, possessed antiviral activities and protected mice during acute lethal infections. Late immune cells lacked these properties in re acutely infected mice, but had strong antiviral activity when trans planted to chronically infected mice -a situation in which early im mune cells had little effect. Also, the cytotoxic and antiviral activities of the early immune cells were relatively resistant to X-irradiation, while the antiviral activity (on transfer to chronically infected mice) of late immune cells was radiation sensitive. Functions of both popu lations of cells were sensitive to treatment with anti-0 antisera and complement, and thus T lymphocytes are involved in both popula tions. Perhaps the late immune cells comprise relatively few actively cytotoxic T lymphocytes but many \"memory\" T lymphocytes ca pable, over a period of time longer than that involved in acute infec tion, of producing a large population of cytotoxic cells.\n\nA lifelong immunity against reinfection is produced by many viruses, including smallpox, poliomyelitis, yellow fever, and the acute childhood exanthemas. In 1847 Panum showed that in the Faroe islands, where successive measles epidemics were separated by intervals of 65 and 31 years, each epidemic infected all those who had not been previously exposed but spared those who had been ex posed. Reports of antibodies persisting in the absence of reinfection include those against yellow fever virus for 75 years (Sawyer, 1931) , poliomyelitis among the Eskimos for 40 years (Paul et al., 1951) , and Rift Valley fever for 12 years (Sabin and Blumberg, 1947) . Reexposure to virus may increase the duration of immunity. Thus, Krugman et al. (1966) found rises in neutralizing antibody titers in immune subjects exposed to measles, and similar observations have been made on vaccinated subjects exposed to smallpox (Downie and McCarthy, 1958) .\n\nTwo explanations have been put forward for prolonged anti-viral immunity in the absence of reinfection; according to one there is persistence of specific clones of immunocompetent cells (Burnet, 1959) and according to the other persistence of virus (Olitsky and Long, 1929a,b) . Observations of antibody in rabbits 2 years after innoculation with inactivated poliovirus (Svehag, 1964b) and similar data in man after administration of killed virus vaccines show that immunologie memory exists, but whether it can explain a lifetime of antibody production in the absence of further antigenic stimulation is uncertain.\n\nMany viruses are known to persist after infection, and in 1929 Olitsky and Long (1929a) suggested \"that the immunity in virus diseases may be linked with the persistence in the body of the living virus.\" De Koch (1924) found the blood of a horse recovered from an attack of equine pernicious anemia to be infectious 7 years later. The salivary gland virus of guinea pigs could be recovered any time after infection and in the presence of antibody (Cole and Kuttner, 1926) . Vaccinia virus was isolated from rabbits 4 months after inoculation (Olitsky and Long, 1929a,b) . Measles virus has been isolated from brain and lymph nodes of patients with subacute sclerosing panen-cephalitis (Horta- Barbosa et al., 1969; Payne et al., 1969) and from the lymph nodes and spleens of normal subjects some years after in fection (Enders-Ruckle, 1965) . Adenoviruses are commonly isolated from human tonsillar and adenoidal tissues (Israel, 1962; Strohl and Schlesinger, 1965) , and in rabbits they persist for long periods in splenic and lymph node cells (Pereira and Kelly, 1957; Reddick and Lefkowitz, 1969; Allison, 1970; Faucon et al., 1974) . Mouse cytomegaloviruses can be isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes of chronically infected mice (Henson et al., 1972) . Some viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and lactate dehydrogenase virus often persist for the lifetime of host animals even in the presence of antibody.\n\nThe human herpesviruses are well known for their latency and tendency to establish recurring infections. Human CMV is often isolated from leukocytes of normal persons (Diosi et al., 1969; Perham et al., 1971; Lang, 1972) . EB virus may be induced in lym phocytes years after recovery from infectious mononucleosis (Diehl et al., 1968) . Varicella-zoster virus remains dormant for years after chicken pox and reappears clinically as zoster. Initial HSV infection presents as a childhood stomatitis with subsequent positive titers for C F and neutralizing antibody (Yoshino et al., 1962) . HSV can later be isolated from asymptomatic subjects as well as those with herpetic lesions (Buddingh et al., 1953; Kaufman et al., 1967) . Over 40 years ago Goodpasture (1929) suggested that the virus remains in a dormant state between recurrences in the sensory ganglia. Direct proof for this concept was lacking until recently, when Stevens and Cook (1971b) isolated HSV from the spinal ganglia of mice weeks after recovery from posterior paralysis following virus inoculation of hind footpads, and from rabbit trigeminal ganglia months after recov ery from corneal infection Stevens et al., 1972) . Virus was recovered only from the ganglia and not from prox imal or distal nerve structures except during acute infection. Virus could not be detected in the ganglia by electron microscopy or by in fectious virus assay, and only after the ganglia were explanted and cultured for a period of time in vitro could virus be recovered. Recov ery of HSV from in vitro cultures of human trigeminal ganglia ob tained at autopsy from patients without active herpes infection has now been reported (Bastian et al., 1972; Baringer and Swoveland, 1973) . J. R. Baringer (1974) has recently isolated type 2 (genital) herpes from the sacral ganglia of humans. It appears that the virus is activated by the explantation and culture, probably due to metabolic changes in the neurons subsequent to injury rather than to the re-moval of the tissue to an environment free of immune responses. This interpretation is consistent with the finding that HSV can be ac tivated in dorsal ganglia after sciatic nerve injury (Walz et al., 1974) and with the well-known observation that proximal rhizotomy of the human trigeminal ganglion results in activation of HSV (Cushing, 1905; Carton and Kilbourne, 1952) .\n\nThe work of Traube in the 1930's showed that in mouse colonies vertical transmission from mothers to offspring of lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus establishes a symptomless lifelong infection in which no antiviral antibody is demonstrable in the cir culating blood. Infection of adult mice with LCM leads to an immunopathological disease and antibody formation. The lack of antibody after congenital LCM virus infection was one of the observa tions that led Burnet and Fenner (1949) to postulate the existence of immunologie tolerance. More recently, Oldstone and Dixon (1967) and Benson and Hotchin (1969) have demonstrated in mice congenitally infected with LCM virus the presence of antiviral antibody and the accumulation in the kidneys of immune complexes containing viral antigen and antibody (Oldstone and Dixon, 1971) . Hence, the congenitally infected mice are able to make some antibody against viral antigens. Volkert and Hannover-Larsen (1965) found that, if spleen cells from LCM-immune mice (infected as adults) are trans ferred to syngeneic congenitally infected carrier animals, very high levels of antibody are formed, but no immunopathological disease results.\n\nThe simplest interpretation of these findings appears to be that LCM viral antigens produce a tolerance resembling that occurring with autoantigens in low dose, namely that T lymphocytes specific for viral antigens become unresponsive while specific B lymphocytes remain able to respond to antigen (Allison, 1973) . In the absence of specific helper cells, only a small amount of antibody is produced, and this combines with antigen liberated into the circulation to form immune complexes which accumulate in the kidney, leading eventu ally to immunopathological glomerulonephritis. However, when virus-specific T cells are supplied by adoptive immunization, a helper effect greatly increases antibody formation in the recipients. A helper role of T cells in antibody formation against LCM viral an tigens is demonstrated by the experiments of Cole et al. (1972) .\n\nAdoptive immunization of congenitally infected LCM virus carrier mice with spleen cells from syngeneic immune donors resulted in high antibody levels, as already described, but treatment of the spleen cells with anti-0 serum before transfer virtually abolished this effect. Thus, even in the presence of B cells from immune donors, little antibody is formed unless sensitized T cells are also present. The interpretation of these experiments is complicated by the fact that in the recipients the level of virus is reduced, so that the antigenic load is less and the chances of finding free antibody are increased. However, the levels of antibody in recipients are so high that this is unlikely to be the whole explanation.\n\nFor a long time it was thought that mice congenitally infected with leukemogenic viruses would likewise be tolerant to virus-specific an tigens. However, Aoki et al. (1966) detected antibody to Gross leuke mogenic virus cell surface antigens (GCSA's) in the sera of old C57BL/6 mice. Mellors et al. (1969) found that Gross soluble an tigens, a mixture of virus-specific antigens , in creased in the sera of NZB mice until 9 months of age, after which increasing titers of antibody to these antigens could be detected and immune elimination of the viral antigen occurred while glomerulonephritis progressed; renal eluates contained 7 S antibody to Gross soluble antigen (Mellors et al., 1971) . Previously preparation in mice of antisera to Gross virus had resulted in the production of antibodies against GCSAs but not of neutralizing antibodies directed against virion envelope antigens (GVEA's). This led to the hypothesis that, due to occult infections early in life, mice might be tolerant to VEA's. However, old NZB mice were found to make \"natural an tibody\" to GVEA's . Recently, Yoshiki et al. (1974b) reported that NZB, NZW, and their Fj hybrid mice contain remarkably high concentrations of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp69/71, and that this protein is deposited as immune complexes in the glomeruli of these mice in much greater concentration than the major structural protein of the virion, p30.\n\nStudies of the high-leukemic AKR mouse strain have also provided evidence for antibody responses to endogenous infections of Gross leukemogenic virus. reported glomerulonephritis developed spontaneously in AKR mice and renal eluates contained antibodies to GCSA's and complement-fixing antibodies to internal viral components. Using immunofiuorescence, Markham et al. (1972) found IgG antibody and complement along with the viral antigens gs-1 and gs-3 in the kidneys of 8-to 10-month-old AKR mice. Hollis et al. (1974) eluted from AKR mouse kidneys IgM and IgG antibodies directed against the virion reverse transcriptase; as expected, these antibodies reacted with mouse and feline but not avian reverse transcriptase. Much of the antibody against AKR virus antigen found in the glomeruli may be directed to viral antigens produced in situ by infected cells, especially mesangial cells (Pascal et al, 1973; Yoshiki et al, 1974b) .\n\nOther strains of mice also produce natural antibody to Gross viral antigens. Thus low-leukemic RF mice and C57BL/6 mice (Porter et al, 1973) produce antiviral antibody and develop chronic glomerulonephritis; over half of the antibody eluted from kidneys of the latter mice at 1 year of age reacted with GCSA's. Predominantly IgM antibodies to GVEA's were also deteced in sera and glomeruli of C57BL/6 mice as well as in B6C3Fi, BALB/c, and AKR mice (Ihle et al, 1973; Batzing et al, 1974) . Using a sensitive radioimmune precipitation assay in which serum is reacted with isotopically labeled virus and the complexes formed then precipitated with appropiate antiglobulins, antibodies to GVEA's (mainly IgG) have been detected in the sera of most inbred mouse strains stud ied (Nowinski and Kaehler, 1974) , and some of these antigens have been characterized as virion envelope glycoproteins . Recently, Lee et al (1974) examined the sera of normal B6C3Fi mice and found 19 S antibody which reacted with 3 antigenic components of Gross MuLV-gp69/71, a second viral enve lope glycoprotein with MW 43,000 daltons, and the small virus core protein pl5. Antibody in the 7 S fraction reacted only with the nonenvelope protein, pl5. Only 19 S antibody neutralized the xenotropic BALB:virus-2, which cross-reacts with Gross virus (vide infra).\n\nHumoral responses are also made to other vertically transmitted murine oncornaviruses. Hirsch et al (1969) and Branca et al (1972) found that mice congenitally infected with Moloney leukemogenic and sarcoma viruses have complexes of viral antigen and antibody in their glomeruli. Recently, endogenous murine oncornaviruses, re leased spontaneously from cells of BALB/c and NZB mice and unable to grow in mouse cells but able to grow in cells of other species and thus called xenotropic viruses, have been isolated and designated BALB:virus-2 and NZB-MuLV, respectively. Neutral izing antibodies to these two viruses are cross-reactive and wide spread, being present in high titers in 2-month-old mice of all strains tested except the NIH strain (Aaronson and Stephenson, 1974) . These investigators suggest that previous studies detecting \"natural\" antibody to the Gross viral antigens may have been primarily directed against the BALB:virus-2 class of endogenous viruses but cross-reactive at a lower level with Gross-type virus. Some crossreactivity between BALB:virus-2 and Gross leukemogenic virus does exist since antisera against the latter virus neutralized the former, but normal BALB/c sera which neutralized BALB:virus-2 did not neu tralize viruses of the Gross or FMR subgroups and the antigenic rela tionships of these viruses awaits clarification. Another xenotropic virus has been isolated from athymic nude mice and neutralizing an tibody to this virus, mainly IgM, has been detected in high titers in the nude mice from which the virus was isolated; this sera also neu tralized BALB:virus-2 and NZB-MuLV (S. Cross, H. M. Morse, and J. Hartley, personal communication, 1974) .\n\nMice infected in utero or neonatally or inheriting viral genomes in a Mendelian, chromosomal fashion can make antibody responses to the viral antigens and thus are not tolerant to these antigens in the classic sense. Whether they can also mount cell-mediated immune responses to these viral antigens is less clear. Recently, Proffitt et al. (1973) have found that lymphocytes from C3H carrier mice (carrying Moloney leukemogenic virus) are cytotoxic to cells bearing virusspecific antigens. If these reactions are mediated by T lymphocytes, a lack of tolerance is suggested. Similar observations for Gross leuke mogenic virus (MuLV-G) have been published by Wahren and Metcalf (1970) . Absence of tolerance in mice neonatally infected with polyoma virus has been found by Allison (1970) : lymphocytes from such animals were able to protect immunosuppressed recipients from polyoma tumor formation. Many investigators have described T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity of cell cultures in which LCM virus is replicating (vide supra). It is observed in mice infected with LCM virus as adults but not in carrier mice infected as newborns. This supports the view that the carrier mice do not have T lympho cytes reactive against virus-specific antigens, not necessarily the same antigens that enter the circulating blood. These studies suggest that it is more difficult to induce tolerance to virus-specific antigens than was formerly supposed, although some examples of selective tolerance (e.g., specifically induced unresponsiveness of T lympho cytes after congenital LCM infection) appear to exist. It is not yet known whether this is due to deletion or inactivation of T lympho cytes or temporary inhibition of their responses by antigen or im mune complexes.\n\nExamples of a response to a strong immunogen increasing the response to a second, weaker immunogen coupled to it have been extensively studied, especially carrier effects in which a hapten has been coupled to different carrier proteins (Katz and Benacerraf, 1972; Leskowitz, 1972) . In an analogous way the presence of the highly immunogenic chicken isoantigen B along with the weaker isoantigen A on the same cells will elicit a stronger than normal immune response to the latter (Schierman and McBride, 1967) . Conceivably, highly immunogenic viral coat proteins may increase the response to less immunogenic components. Tumor transplantation antigens are often weakly immunogenic, and the immunogenicity of various tumors has been improved by association of the tumor antigens with stronger immunogens by forming somatic hybrids with more antigenic cells (Watkins and Chen, 1969) , or by virus infection (reviewed by Lin denmann, 1974). Thus, Lindenmann and Klein (1967) prepared viral oncolysates by infecting Ehrlich ascites tumor cells with influenza virus and showed that immunization of mice with such preparations would protect them against 100 lethal doses of the uninfected tumor cells eleven days later. Even if inactivated, partially purified virus from oncolysates was protective, indicating direct viral lysis of the tumor in vivo was not involved. Antisera to the virus (prepared against influenza virus grown in eggs) eliminated the protective ef fect and simple mixtures of virus and tumor cells were not effective, indicating that close coupling of viral and tumor antigens was required. These findings have been confirmed (H\u00e4kkinen and Halonen, 1971 ). Since the virions were not rigorously purified after oncolysis, it cannot be decided from these experiments whether the immunogen was fragments of cell membrane containing virus an tigens or virions containing host material. The latter interpretation is favored in similar experiments with VSV and fowl-plague virus in which the viral oncolysates were immunogenic only when prepared following the appearance of progeny virus, long after the incorpo ration of virus proteins into cell membranes (Lindenmann, 1970) .\n\nImmunizing hamsters with highly purified and inactivated VSV grown in SV40-transformed hamster cells, Ansel (1974) induced transplantation immunity to the same and another SV40-transformed cell line. Although similar immunization with VSV grown in a spon taneously transformed hamster cell line conferred no such immunity, more cell lines transformed by SV40 and other viruses must be stud ied before specificity for the SV40 transplantation rejection antigen (TRA) is established in this system. Also, it is unclear whether the SV40 TRA was incorporated into the virion structure or adsorbed onto its surface as a contaminant; some host material is incorporated into VSV virions (vide supra), but cell surface antigens can be ad sorbed onto the virions (Hecht and Summers, 1972) .\n\nIn other studies virus was not purified from tumor lysates and tumor cell membranes containing virus antigens may be the immunogen. Thus, Eaton et al. (1973) reported increased immunogenicity of a Gross virus lymphoma when syngeneic mice were immunized with lysates of tumor cells infected with NDV or Sendai virus, and membrane fractions were more effective than concentrated virus. Kobayashi et al. (1970) have shown that infection of rat tumors with Friend virus increases their immunogenicity and similar find ings in the hamster for SV40-transformed human cells have been reported using oncolysates prepared by infection with NDV (Axler and Girardi, 1970). A syngeneic system using SV40-transformed 3T3 cells transplanted to BALB/c mice and oncolysates produced by influenza virus or VSV yielded similar results (Boone et al., 1971 (Boone et al., , 1974 Boone and Blackman, 1972) . Boone et al. (1974) found that tumor immunity cannot be induced by viral oncolysates if mice are first made tolerant to the virus by cyclophosphamide treatment. This was considered evidence for a carrier-hapten relationship between the virus and tumor antigens, but interpretation is difficult because of the complexities of cyclophosphamide treatment (Aisenberg, 1973; Lagrange et al., 1974) . The use of viral oncolysates from human tumors to improve the im munizing efficiency of patients to their own tumors following surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy is potentially important, es pecially if inactivation of the virus does not diminish tumor im munogenicity. Infection of cancer patients with various viruses has sometimes been thought to have beneficial effects (Webb and . However, critical evaluation of this approach is required. The cooperative effect in virus infections may also prove useful in the preparation of antisera to cellular isoantigens in allogeneic systems (Lindenmann and Klein, 1964) and of potent antilymphocyte sera in xenogeneic systems (Bandlow et al., 1972 (Bandlow et al., , 1973 .\n\nCooperative phenomena may also help explain the broadening reactivity of late viral antisera, since the immune response to minor viral determinants may be stimulated by response to stronger ones. Certain types of autoimmunity may involve cooperative effects if self-antigens are coupled to strongly immunogenic viral antigens during infection. It has been shown that immunization of chickens with egg-grown influenza virus results in antibody production against an autologous mucopolysaccharide antigen (vide supra) present embryologically in endodermal cells lining the allantoic cav ity and in the liver and bile of adults (Harboe and Haukenes, 1966; Harboe et al., 1966; ; no pathological lesions were reported. Virus particles have been found in NZB mice, which manifest many autoimmune phenomena (Mellors et al., 1969) , in dogs with a lupus syndrome (Lewis, 1974) , and possibly in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (reviewed by Andres et al., 1972) , but the role of viruses in these autoimmune phenomena has yet to be clearly defined.\n\nSeveral viruses are known to influence the activity of the immune system (see review by Notkins et al., 1970) . Many virus infections result in nonspecific immunoglobulin elevation (LDV, VEE, Rauscher leukemia, Aleutian mink disease, equine infectious ane mia) or depression (most leukomogenic viruses). Some infections, as with Aleutian mink disease virus, result in elevated immunoglobulins but a diminished humoral response to unrelated antigens (Porter et al., 1965; Kenyon, 1966; Lodmell et al., 1970) . Mice in fected with murine leukemogenic viruses have diminished circu lating antibody to sheep erythrocytes and bovine serum albumin. The Jerne plaque technique has been used to demonstrate at a cellular level a diminished response to sheep erythrocytes in mice infected with mouse CMV , Rowson-Parr virus (Bendinelli and Nardini, 1973), Friend virus (Salaman and Wedderburn, 1966; Chan et al., 1968) , Rauscher leukemogenic virus (Siegel et al., 1969; Bennett and Steeves, 1970) , and Moloney leukemogenic virus (Salaman and Wedderburn, 1966) .\n\nCell-mediated immunity may also be affected, as shown by pro longed skin-graft rejection in mice following infections with LDV (Dent et al., 1965; Howard et al., 1969) , Marek's disease virus (Pur chase et al, 1968), and NDV (Woodruff and Woodruff, 1974) . Von Pirquet (1908) noted that measles infection resulted in a decreased dermal hypersensitivity to tuberculin, and this phenomenon has been observed during natural measles infection (Nablant, 1937; Beck, 1962) and shortly after vaccination with attenuated virus (Mellman and Wetton, 1963; Brody and McAlister, 1964; Starr and Berkovich, 1964) . Transient diminished skin test responses to an tigens of Candida and vaccinia virus, dinitrochlorobenzene, and poison ivy have also been observed following attenuated measles virus vaccination (Blumhardt et al., 1968; Fireman et al., 1969) . Lymphocytes from subjects recently vaccinated with the attenuated virus showed transient diminished blastogenesis and DNA synthesis in vitro when exposed to measles antigen, tuberculin, and Candida antigens, but not to appropriate concentrations of PHA (Smithwick and Berkovich, 1966; Fireman et al., 1969; Finkel and Dent, 1973) . Yamanouchi et al. (1974b) reported marked suppression of dermal hypersensitivity to PPD in sensitized rabbits for 2 weeks following infection with rinderpest virus.\n\nTransient suppression of tuberculin sensitivity has also been re ported during a few other viral infections. Suppression was observed during the acute phase of paralytic poliomyelitis (Carnevale and Iovino, 1959) and after immunization of tuberculous children with Sabin 1 vaccine (Berkovich and Starr, 1966) . The latter authors re ported one-third of the tuberculous children studied became tuber culin negative 4 to 6 weeks after Sabin immunization, and this state persisted for as long as 2 months. The long delay between vaccina tion and suppression was unexplained. The same authors (Starr and Berkovich, 1964) reported that 8 of 17 tuberculous children with varicella infection became tuberculin negative near the end of the 14-day incubation period and during the exanthem; reactivity re turned to normal in a few days.\n\nNonspecific functions such as clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) may be depressed (LDV, ectromelia, LCM, dengue, Sandfly fever) or elevated (VEE, murine leukemia viruses) by virus infections. Infection by LDV presents a special example of impaired clearance. Following infection, phagocytic activity of the RES as reflected by carbon particle clearance is only transiently impaired (Mahy, 1964) while there is permanent impairment of the clearance of certain enzymes (LDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase) but not others (alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase). Little consideration has been given to the clearance of endogenous enzymes (those enzymes that are useful intracellularly but which, after becoming extracellular due to cell leakage or cell death, have no known extracellular functions). It has long been held that the RES plays a role in clearing proteins gener ally (Hyman and Paldino, 1960) and, based on their studies showing decreased clearance of endogenous enzymes after RES blockade, Wakim and Fleisher (1963) suggested a similar role for the RES in clearing endogenous proteins. Infection by LDV, which replicates almost exclusively in macrophages in vitro, appears specifically to eliminate or impair the function of a subpopulation of macrophages or cells of the RES responsible for clearance of certain endogenous enzymes. The specificity of the clearance cells for certain enzymes is presumably on a nonimmunological basis since there is no evidence to suggest that the extracellular enzymes are structurally (an-tigenically) altered and therefore the animal should be tolerant to them. One can postulate that specific membrane receptors for the en zymes cleared exist on a particular population of cells infected by LDV. Because of its selective tropism, LDV may prove to be a useful tool to define and explore the functions of subpopulations of macro phages, especially in regard to their clearance functions.\n\nThere are many ways in which virus infections influence the im mune system. Lytic infections may affect the thymus. Rowe and Capps (1961) described a virus, recently characterized as a herpesvirus (Parker et al., 1973) which causes transient massive destruction of thymus cortex and medulla in newborn mice. Studies by S. Cross and H. M. Morse (personal communication) demonstrate that this virus (called the thymic agent) replicates in thymocytes of newborn mice and later can be found only in the salivary glands. Several weeks after infection, lymphocytes from thymus, lymph node, and spleen have minimal reactivity in the graft-versus-host reaction; lymph node cells show normal reactivity at 8 weeks postinfection. Mitogenic responses to T lymphocyte mitogens but not to lipopolysaccharide are also depressed for weeks (G. H. Cohen, personal com munication). A human herpesvirus, varicella-zoster, can also grow in the thymus. Cheathem et al. (1956) observed evidence of virus growth in thymuses of children dying of fatal varicella infections. Many intranuclear inclusion bodies were seen in thymus reticular cells and Hassall's corpuscles were necrotic.\n\nMeasles infection of humans can result in thymus changes. White and Boyd (1973) studied autopsy material from eight children less than 3 years of age who died during or shortly after measles infec tion. Beginning 4 days after the onset of illness, there was severe aggregation and syncytial formation of thymocytes in the thymus cortex and subsequent total loss of cortex in some cases. No recovery of cortex was discernible until 3 or 4 months after infection. Exami nation of other lymphoid tissues, including spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, did not reveal similar changes. In tissue cultures a prominent cytopathic effect of measles infection is syncytial forma tion (Enders and Peebles, 1954) . White and Boyd felt the syncytial cell formation in the thymus differed from the Warthin-Finkeldey \"giant cells\" (Warthin, 1931) found in peripheral lymphoid tissue during the prodromal stage of measles. It is difficult to relate these thymus observations to the previously noted suppression of delayed hypersensitivity reactions by measles infection since, in mice at least, the effects of thymectomy on cell-mediated immunity are not seen for weeks. More likely, immunosuppression occurs because of (McCullough et al., 1973) , as did rinderpest virus infections of rabbits (Yamanouchi et al., 1974a) .\n\nInfection of mice with LDV causes transient depletion of thymusdependent areas of lymph nodes and spleen (Fig. 16) (ProfBtt et al., 1972; . Although LDV can grow in macro phage cultures, it does not replicate in lymphocyte cultures and cannot be demonstrated by electron microscopy within the lympho- cytes of infected spleens (Snodgrass \u03b2\u03af \u03b1\u0396., 1972). It is postulated that its toxic effect on lymphocytes is mediated by viral growth in den dritic macrophages near the lymphocytes with disruption of tropic influences or the release of toxic materials. Alterations in T lympho cyte migrations could also result. Peripheral lymphoid necrosis is a common feature of infections by mouse hepatitis virus (Hirano and Ruebner, 1965; Biggart and Ruebner, 1970) as well as the medipest viruses already mentioned. The bursal infectious agent, an avian virus that causes lymphoid necrosis in young chickens resulting in a syndrome termed Gumboro disease, replicates in thymus, lymph nodes, spleen, and the bursa of Fabricius (Cheville, 1967) . A severe inflammatory reaction occurs in the bursa, which is the only lym phoid organ that does not repopulate with lymphocytes after infec-tion. During infection, viral antigen and virus particles can be de tected in macrophages in the bursa but not in the affected lympho cytes. Damage to the lymphocytes may therefore be indirect and pos sibly of an autoimmune nature.\n\nMany viruses are known to replicate in lymphocytes (Mims, 1964; Gresser and Lang, 1966; Edelman and Wheelock, 1967; Wheelock and Toy, 1973) and infections may result in chromosomal abnormali ties (Nichols, 1966) and cell death. Persistent infections may result in more subtle disturbances of cell function. It has been hypothesized that infected lymphocytes may have alterations in protein synthesis, responses to hormones, interactions with other lymphoid cells, mac rophages, or antigens, and in migration characteristics. Migration of lymphocytes in vivo is partly determined by cell membrane charac teristics such as sialic acid content (Woodruff and Gesner, 1969; Berney and Gesner, 1970) . The surfaces of infected cells are often al tered (vide supra) and the appearance on cell membranes of viral neuraminidase after infection with SV5 can result in release of cell membrane sialic acid Klenk et al., 1970) . Woodruff and Woodruff (1974) have reported that inoculation of NDV into rats causes a transient diversion of homing thoracic duct lymphocytes from lymph nodes and spleen to liver with resulting depletion of lymphocytes in thymus-dependent areas of nodes and spleen. This appeared to be due to viral neuraminidase acting on the lymphocyte surface. The importance of this phenomenon in natural infections is not clear.\n\nTheoretically, latent infections in lymphocytes might convert to productive or lytic infections when the lymphocytes are stimulated to divide. Virus activation occurs in graft-versus-host reactions and in mixed lymphocyte reactions (Hirsch et al., 1970 , and the in duced viruses (endogenous leukemogenic viruses) were found pri marily in blastogenic lymphocytes (Andr\u00e9-Schwartz et al., 1973) . Pre sumably, the viral genome is present in the phenotypically normal cells as postulated by the oncogene theory (Todaro and Huebner, 1972) and is activated by processes triggered by an allogeneic stimu lus.\n\nThe importance of immunologie activation of viruses to human disease is suggested by the high incidence of malignancies of the RES found in renal allograft patients (Penn and Starzl, 1972) . Rele vant to this, Hirsch et al. (1973) reported that mice receiving ALS treatment as well as allografts had an increased incidence of ac tivated viruses in their spleens compared to those receiving allo grafts without ALS treatment; no animals receiving ALS alone pro-duced virus. Thus, host-versus-graft reactions can activate oncogenic viruses, especially if the host is receiving ALS therapy. Human lymphocytes stimulated with ALS replicate VSV (Edelman and Wheelock, 1968b) and HSV (Kleinman et al, 1972) to higher titers than untreated cells.\n\nThe activation of nononcogenic viruses from lymphocytes by allogeneic stimulation is suggested by the cytomegalovirus posttrans fusion syndrome. Isolation of CMV from donors or recipients prior to blood transfusion is rare (Mirkovic et al., 1971) and lymphocytelymphocyte interactions may be required. A similar situation may exist for EB virus activation after transfusion . Whether severe or chronic infections may also activate viruses is not known.\n\nSome viruses, such as VSV Wheelock, 1967, 1968a) , yellow fever (Wheelock and Edelman, 1969) , mumps (Due-Nguyen and Henle, 1966) , and HSV (Nahmias et al, 1964) , grow l i t t l e -i f at all -in lymphocytes unless they are stimulated with PHA or antilymphocyte sera (Edelman and Wheelock, 1968b ). VSV appears to grow predominantly in blastogenic T lymphocytes and perhaps preferentially in those with cytotoxic potential (Kano et al, 1973) . Concanavalin A and pokeweed mitogen stimulation of spleen lym phocytes resulted in 33-fold and 17-fold increases in virus plaqueforming cells, respectively, while lipopolysaccharide stimulation re sulted in only a two-fold increase above background. Prior treatment of cells with anti-0 sera and complement or the use of athymic nude mouse spleen cells resulted in no virus plaque-forming cells. Mixed cultures of DBA/2 and CBA lymphocytes produced many cytotoxic lymphocytes and large numbers of virus plaque-forming cells were observed while cultures of BALB/c and DBA/2 lymphocytes resulted in even more blastogenesis but less cytotoxicity, and few virus plaque-forming cells were observed.\n\nInfections by viruses requiring lymphocyte proliferation for their own replication, occurring fortuitously or activated from a latent state at a time of antigenic stimulation, might eliminate a rapidly dividing clone of immunocompetent cells specific for the stimulating antigen. Conceivably, a virus lyrically infecting lymphoid cells at a time when they are responding to the antigenic stimulus provided by the virus itself might eliminate clones of immune cells specific for those virus antigens. Thus, specific states of tolerance similar to those produced by cyclophosphamide treatment of animals after an tigenic exposure or virus infection (Nathanson and Cole, 1970) might arise.\n\nSeveral approaches have been taken to establish which population of lymphocytes is primarily affected by virus infections. The ability of infected cells to participate in graft-versus-host reactions (Pur chase et al., 1968; Howard et al., 1969; Bennett and Steeves, 1970) , reject skin grafts (Howard et al., 1969) , and be stimulated by PHA or an in vitro allogeneic exposure (Hagry et al., 1970) has been used to determine the immunocompetence of infected T lymphocytes, and transfer-reconstitution experiments with infected bone marrow cells have been used to ascertain B lymphocyte competence (Bennett and Shearer et al., 1973) . Interpretation of these experiments is difficult since transfers of infected cells often result in transfer of infectious virus as well. Experiments with Friend virus are particularly complicated by contamination with Rowson-Parr virus, lymphatic leukemia virus, and LDV (Bennett and . In a recent transfer-reconstitution experiment, Shearer et al. (1973) demonstrated that the antibody response to a D-amino acid polypeptide (a thymus-independent antigen) was significantly re duced after infection of bone marrow cells with the SJL/J leukemogenic virus, regardless of whether thymocytes were infected or not. Hence, infection with this virus may result in a decrease in the response of B lymphocytes, but the experiments provide no informa tion on possible effects on T lymphocytes. Peled and Haran-Ghera (1974) found that infection of mice with the radiation leukemia (Gross) virus resulted in depressed responses of spleen cells to sheep erythrocytes but normal responses to the thymus-independent antigens polyvinylpyrrolidine and pneumococcal polysaccharide SIII. They concluded that the immunosuppressive effect of this virus is on T lymphocytes.\n\nThe direct effect of measles virus infection on lymphocytes has been investigated by H. McFarland (personal communication). A mouse-adapted strain of virus was used to infect mice and measles antigen was present in spleen for 6 to 12 days after inoculation, but T lymphocytes were not killed as demonstrated by normal numbers of lymphocytes sensitive to anti-0 and complement. Mice were primed with ovalbumin-DNP (OA-DNP), a carrier-hapten conjugate, or with chicken \u03b3-globulin (CGG), a secondary carrier, and their spleen cells used in combination to adoptively immunize irradiated recipient mice; secondary anti-hapten responses were measured after chal lenge with the appropriate conjugate. The effect of measles virus in fection was ascertained by infecting either the CGG primed donor or the OA-DNP primed donors, and it was found that infection of CGG primed donors resulted in diminished anti-hapten responses while infection of OA-DNP donors had no effect on the response. Sindbis virus infection of the carrier donor did not affect the response. Although these studies demonstrate an effect of measles virus infec tion on the helper cell population of T lymphocytes, impairment of other T lymphocyte activity may be responsible for the observed im pairment of delayed hypersensitivity.\n\nFinally, virus infections can abrogate tolerance. Inoculation of BALB/c mice with subimmunogenic amounts of pneumococcal polysaccharide (SIII), a relatively thymus-independent antigen, results in unresponsiveness to subsequent immunogenic amounts of antigen; this state lasts for months and is specific for SIII (Baker et al., 1974) . Tolerance in this system appears to be mediated by suppressor T cells since it is broken by the administration of ALS along with SIII; also, tolerance to SIII cannot be induced in athymic nude mice. P. J. Baker and W. H. Burns (unpublished observations) have found that infection with LDV will abrogate tolerance, although to a lesser ex tent than ALS administration. This is not due to an adjuvant effect since well-known adjuvants like complete Freund's adjuvant, poly I-C, and lipopolysaccharide do not abrogate tolerance in this system. Figure 16 shows that 48 hours after infection the thymus-dependent areas of the spleen (and lymph nodes) are depleted of lymphocytes and have the appearance of lymphoid tissue following administration of ALS. Whether LDV alters T cell migration or is directly or indi rectly toxic to T cells is not clear. It is doubtful that the virus selec tively impairs the functions of suppressor T cells, but rather impairs the functions of all or most T cells. In this system with SIII as an tigen, the predominant influence of T cells on specific B cells is a suppressive one and destruction or impairment of T cell functions results in a diminution of their suppressive effect. Thus, as demon strated here, virus infections can unbalance the normal regulatory mechanisms of the immune system. The frequency of virus infec tions in all animals, the presence of \"endogenous viruses\" in most or all cells, and the persistent and latent infections by \"exogenous viruses\" in many cells require an awareness by immunologists of the influences of these viruses on immune responses.\n\nDuring the past two decades the science of immunology has ad vanced rapidly. The various classes and subclasses of immuno-globulins have been recognized and their structures and properties elucidated. Interactions of T and B lymphocytes and macrophages in the induction of immune responses have been extensively docu mented. Reactions of receptor immunoglobulins on B lymphocytes and the mechanism of synthesis of immunoglobulins in their prog eny have been analyzed. Products of T lymphocytes activated by anti gens and mitogens have been defined, and their effects on macro phages and other cells studied. Components of the complement system have been isolated and characterized, and the alternate path of activation of the complement system has been recognized.\n\nAt the same time considerable advances have been made in molec ular virology and genetics. The structures of viruses, their nucleic acids, the specific polymerases involved in their replication, and the mechanisms of synthesis of the protein and glycoprotein components of their capsids and envelopes have all been studied in detail. The genetics of animal viruses and the genetic control of immune responses have received increasing attention. Temperature-sensitive mutants of viruses have been used to study their mode of replication and the mechanisms of malignant transformation. Human patients and experimental animals with inherited deficiencies of immunoglobulin or complement component formation and thymus defi ciencies have already provided valuable information about differen tial susceptibility to infections.\n\nFor the most part the developments in immunology, virology, and genetics have been parallel but independent. In the future, the ac cumulated information and powerful analytical methods developed in these disciplines should be pooled for a combined approach to problems that have so far seemed intractable.\n\nSome benefits of this sort of approach are already apparent. Many remarkable features of humoral immune responses came to light during the course of studies of antibodies against viruses. These include some of the earliest analyses of secretory antibodies, later shown to be mainly of IgA specificity, and features of immunologie memory such as \"original antigenic sin\" and IgM memory following repeated exposure to small doses of antigen. The cellular basis of these responses is still imperfectly understood, and with the high sensitivity of the plaque neutralization system, viral antigens offer interesting material for further study. Current studies analyzing at the cellular level the formation of B lymphocyte memory, the response of such B cells to the same or cross-reactive antigens and the influence of T lymphocytes on that recall should provide basic knowledge concerning T and B lymphocyte interactions.\n\nStudies have just begun on the thymus dependence of viral antigens, most of which resemble other proteins in being thymusdependent. However, one (Sindbis envelope glycoprotein) is rela tively thymus-independent and biochemical analysis of this mole cule may provide insights concerning this interesting property. The science of immunology began with observations of Jenner and later von Pirquet on the body's responses, beneficial and patholog ical, to virus infections. The devastating effects on patients with thymus deficiencies of virus infections usually mild in normal humans was the first indication of the biologic importance of cellmediated immunity. Virus infections (as with ectromelia virus) of experimental animals have provided model systems for analyzing in vivo the roles of various lymphoid cells. The recent development of in vitro assays for various lymphocyte functions make feasible correl ative studies with in vivo activities of different lymphocyte popula tions. Interesting information from such studies, particularly those using LCM virus, has already been discussed.\n\nMechanisms of immunity mediated by T lymphocytes and the part they play in protection against some virus infections are still imper fectly understood, but still less is known about the biologic impor tance of the cytotoxic system in which antibody sensitizes virusinfected target cells for destruction by nonspecific effector (K) lymphoid cells. This has recently been shown to occur in vitro with herpesvirus-infected cells and could play a role in immunity and immunopathology (Rager-Zisman and Bloom, 1974; Shore et al., 1974) . Model systems of viral infections should be useful in defining the importance of this phenomenon.\n\nFinally, although first noted by von Pirquet almost 70 years ago, the effects of virus infections on immune responses has only recently received much attention. As already discussed, the presence of viral antigens with less immunogenic antigens may enhance responses to the latter. Viruses that infect or affect particular populations of lym phoid cells, e.g., the thymic agent and LDV, have been reported and the latter can abrogate tolerance to certain antigens. The tropism of viruses may prove to be a useful property for selectively depleting animals of certain lymphocyte populations. The causative role of such viruses in diseases and autoimmune phenomena is still rela tively unexplored."}
