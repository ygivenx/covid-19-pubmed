{"title": "Title: Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) in Malawi: Implementation Gaps and Challenges for Timely Alert Submit journal: PLoS ONE", "body": "After the largest Ebola Viral Disease (EVD) outbreak happened in Western Africa, governments, health authorities in Africa and the world learnt a valuable lesson from the challenges of diseases surveillance systems implementations in countries with limited public health infrastructure [1, 2] .\n\nThe outbreak emerged in 2013, ended in June 2016 and affected 10 countries worldwide with 28,616 confirmed or probable cases, and 11,310 deaths [3] [4] [5] [6] . The feebleness of the public health infrastructure and capabilities, to capture early warning signal of outbreak and provide good timeliness for response, was further exposed during this epidemic and the need for strengthening the surveillance system in these countries and transform it from passive to active surveillance was articulated for actions [2, 7] . Yet the new EVD outbreak emerged in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in April 2018 [8] .\n\nEarly case detection is one of the important approaches to managing future outbreaks [9] . In Africa, although Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was adopted as the regional development approach for member states and technical partners since 1998, still, its implementation in Africa [14, 15] . However, shortcomings of the global health system's capability, lack of virological surveillance in Africa and technologies for vaccine production and implementation and the basic public health system infrastructure were revealed during the same pandemic [16] . At the community level, the Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) are the frontline health care workers (HCWs) responsible for case identification and report. They work under the supervision of attached health facilities to identify case and further refer to the nearest health facility [19] . Most of the health facilities are public, government-owned or non-governmental, non-profit organization under government regulatory in Malawi. The HCWs at each facility, irrespective of ownership (public or private) are responsible for case identification and reporting (weekly and monthly). Each facility has a person responsible for tallying reportable cases using various health information tools, including electronic medical records (EMR) system. In the current guideline, 19 diseases and conditions are required immediately reporting (Table 1) . \uf0b7 Set policies and procedures for analyzing and interpreting data \uf0b7 Analyze and interpret data from a national perspective \uf0b7 Regularly convene a meeting of the technical coordinating committee to review the analyzed and interpreted data before wider dissemination \uf0b7 Carry out special analyse to forecast magnitude and trends of priority disease and public health events.\n\n\uf0b7 Ensure guidelines and standard operating procedures for outbreak investigations are available at all sites \uf0b7 Coordinate and collaborate with international authorities as needed during investigations \uf0b7 Alert and support laboratory participation \uf0b7 Provide logistic support l supplies, equipment, reagents, specimen transport media, health promotion budget \uf0b7 Share information with regional and international networks about confirmed outbreak \uf0b7 Use the decision instrument to decide whether the outbreak is a potential PHEIC \uf0b7 Process specimen from investigation and send timely results as required to each level \uf0b7 Request additional specimen as needed \uf0b7 Take part in epidemic response team Despite existing framework of IDSR system, few nationwide assessments of IDSR system have been done in Africa and none in Malawi [12, [21] [22] [23] . This study aims to explore the differences between the IDSR guideline and practice, specifically looking into the timeliness and completeness aspects, which shall trigger responses.\n\nThis study mixed quantitative and qualitative methods to assess and understand the implementation gaps of IDSR system from each level of the health system in Malawi and focused on two key attributes, timeliness and completeness, of the surveillance system [24] .\n\nWe used the built-in function of the DHIS2 to extract IDSR monthly reporting rate summary data The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/363713 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nQuantitative data were exported from the DHIS2 with the Excel data format and divided by the studied district and one national category. The data were compiled to one dataset and analyzed using tabulation and line charts to illustrate the time series patterns of the IDSR monthly report data quality -completeness and timeliness 1 . According to the national policy, 80% completeness and timeliness is the threshold of good performance.\n\nInterview records were transcribed into text for translating and read by the researchers (TSJW) to find the actual practices of IDSR system. The core functions of each level of health system actors were compared with the expected functions according to the guideline.\n\nWe extracted 168 IDSR reporting rate summary (24 months). The completeness data, exclude the outlier in February 2015, showed average completeness was 94.0% and 76.4% in the studied district and nationwide respectively (Fig 2. The IDSR monthly reports completeness indicator from October 2014 to September 2016 divided by national level and studied district). Only 4.2% of the IDSR monthly reports from the whole country reached the good performance standard.\n\nWe observed very poor timeliness performance of the IDSR monthly report (Fig 3. The IDSR monthly reports timeliness indicator from October 2014 to September 2016 divided by national level and studied district). Good performance was not achieved during any of the 24 months.\n\nNotably in February 2015, the timeliness of IDSR monthly reports all dropped to almost 0% due to server breakdown and also affected the completeness of IDSR monthly report in the studied district.\n\nAt the community level, we interviewed 17 HSAs who run the village clinics to provide health services to the villagers. However, according to all the informants, none of them was practicing community-level case identification using IDSR guidelines. They relied on volunteers from the Village Health Committee (VHC) to report unusual health events. One informant explained the limited logistic support and large catchment area to serve constitute challenges to do active surveillance works. The health volunteers from the VHC hence played critical roles for the community level outbreak or incidence alerts. They initiated preliminary investigations when community rumors emerge and physically walked to the higher-level health facilities to report.\n\nThe main function that HSAs saw for themselves in serving IDSR was to assist their health facilities to compile the IDSR monthly reports, perform community sensitization and education. Through observations, some HSAs were equipped and capable to do simple data analysis ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/363713 doi: bioRxiv preprint interact with the VHC for disease prevention and health promotion. However, the limited supervision and resources affected their performance in this area of work.\n\n\"At first, we are going to each and every household\u2026but this time it's not often.\" HSA,\n\nAt the facility level, we interviewed 12 HCWs from two health facilities. The HCWs picked up unusual health events through their daily services and did not wait until the monthly report to take actions. Lack of comprehensive training was the challenge to enhance the electronic system to capture more data for disease surveillance and decision-making.\n\n\"The challenge is those who are using the computers, it's just a few number of people who are oriented... that's why it's difficult to capture the data and many information.\" DHO,\n\nFinancial constrains were key concerns. This created gaps for IDSR system to be implemented using the updated technical guideline at the community and facility levels.\n\n\"The new IDSR guidelines are in, but due to lack of funds they have not yet called us for orientation on the new guidelines. We are still using the old guidelines, which is having fewer information. \u2026 We are just waiting (fund) so that we can also share the information with our fellow health workers.\" DHO, #RDHO02\n\n.

The constrained resources heavily affect the performance of the IDSR system in the country. The IDSR weekly reporting system paralyzed due to the difficulties for HCWs to cope with the volume of paper-generated reports and lack of internet connectivity. This seemed the main obstacle from national authorities perspective who eagers to enable the system for rapid responses.\n\n\"Of course we told them to do weekly report, but there is no internet. For them to write report and send\u2026 it is just too difficult for them to handle these papers.\" ED, #MOH02\n\nThe data quality of IDSR monthly report submitted through HMIS was the concern for ED to use.\n\nFor instance, there were 31 Viral Hemorrhagic Fever cases recorded in DHIS2 in 2015, but none confirmed by the department.\n\n\"If you look at the data, you will be surprised like: how can we have Ebola cases and we don't know. The data quality is just so poor and we cannot use it.\" ED, #MOH01\n\nThe department expected to use technology to improve timeliness and capability to early response.\n\n\"If it is an immediately notifiable case, we want to know immediately. We don't even want to wait them to report to us, we want to know now. Even it is a rumor or what, we need to know so we can check if it is true. That's why we want to use this SMS or the eIDSR (electronic IDSR) so we can know there is something happening there.\" ED, #MOH02\n\n. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/363713 doi: bioRxiv preprint There is a fundamental difference between the needs of the HMIS and the IDSR systems, where one is looking only for confirmed cases while IDSR is looking for alerts to take fast actions.\n\n\"We want to get confirmed cases. We need to know exactly how many are they so we can do proper planning. That is why we want the data to be complete and accurate.\" CMED #MOH03 \"We need to know if there is something happen in the community. Wait for a month, sometimes three months to get report, it is just too slow. We need to take actions immediately so we are looking for any signal that can trigger us to take actions.\" ED,\n\nWe assessed the differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice in the health system in Malawi for the first time. According to the quantitative data, we observed relatively good completeness of IDSR monthly reports compared to timeliness. Timeliness is a general problem to countries implementing IDSR system across Africa, and this makes the public health authorities unable to take quick action and respond to the suspected health events [12, 25] . Facility level IDSR reports may not be sufficiently timely to pick up the outbreaks from community. The strengthened community level surveillance and verbal autopsy to detect unusual deaths can be a good approach to detect lower level health events and provide timely response [26] . In Malawi, a pilot study conducted in Lilongwe District in Central Region showed that mobile technologies had good opportunities to improve timeliness of HMIS reports [27] . However, concerning the different purposes of HMIS and IDSR system, a more integrated electronic IDSR system is essential for the health authorities to correspond the diverse demands. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/363713 doi: bioRxiv preprint African health ministries are quickly adopting mHealth solutions to improve disease surveillance and health programmes. Tanzania piloted an IDSR reporting system using SMS function and regular phones for report in 2011 [28] and further expanded it to be the national strategy for diseases surveillance using Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) technology linked with DHIS2 for the immediate reporting for IDSR [29] [30] [31] . Zambia tried to use DHIS2 mobile to enhance its malaria surveillance in Lusaka district and to improve case management and reporting [32] . Other mobile technologies including smartphone applications, patient monitoring devices, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), as well as laptops and tablets PCs connected with network service were piloted and implemented in various African countries [33] . Countries and development partners are eager to apply the mobile technology to capture real-time field data for surveillance and case management at the community level health care system [30, [34] [35] [36] [37] . However, notable issues were documented including technical, financial, infrastructural challenges, data security and medical supports during the design and implementation process of mHealth surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa countries [33] . Considering the complexity of public health works and needs of integration services at the community level [38] , the utilization of mobile technologies requires more rigorous studies to evaluate such innovations for programme implementation to become sustainable and scalable [39] .\n\nApart from mHealth solutions, researchers recommended to use syndromic surveillance approach combined with systematic virological testing as early as possible to maintain high quality situational awareness [40] . Several countries have established electronic data based syndromic surveillance systems to capture early warning signals of different diseases and health status especially related to respiratory infections [41] [42] [43] [44] . However, electronic syndromic surveillance systems remain a novel technology for most of developing countries to adopt and implement [45] . Several EMR systems had been developed in Malawi and MOH decided to move towards a national standardized EMR system to support all levels of HMIS [46] [47] [48] . This provides a unique opportunity to utilize existing information technology and infrastructures to strengthen the IDSR system with nationwide . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Yet it is critical to improve the user experiences of EMR users to improve the uptake and usage of the system. Similar countries can consider system synergies and existing infrastructure for IDSR enhancement.\n\nWe only focused on completeness and timeliness, and the accuracy attribute of the IDSR system performance was out of the scope of this study. Further clinical and laboratory data are needed for proper assessment. We only sampled one district to conduct qualitative assessment, however, we are confident that it is relevant for the Malawian context by the fact that the health care system is rather homogeneous in Malawi and the district we selected had a relatively good IDSR performance to generalize the implementation challenges.\n\nLack of timeliness in reporting makes the IDSR system inoperative. Differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice existed in the current Malawian context. Shortcomings were due to financial constraints and poor basic infrastructure. However, the improving information technology infrastructure in Malawi, single country platform EMR system and emerging mHealth technologies can be opportunities for the country to overcome the challenges and improve the surveillance system. . .
