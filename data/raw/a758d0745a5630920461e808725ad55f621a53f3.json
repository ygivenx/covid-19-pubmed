{"title": "Experimental demyelination induced by coronavirus JHM (MHV-4) : molecular identification of a viral determinant of paralytic disease", "body": "JHMV is a murine coronavirus strain which causes encephalitis and demyelination in mice . Along with other virus-induced and immunologically-mediated experimental diseases, JHMV infection has served as a model of human neurological illnesses .` it is reasonable to expect that study of these models may yield important insights and research strategies which may be relevant to human demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis.\" In this regard, a major goal has been to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for experimental demyelination .\n\nOne problem in studying the mechanism of JHMV-induced demyelination has been the difficulty of separating myelin loss from the severe encephalitis which is also 'Author to whom correspondence should be addressed . 0882 -4010/87/070009+12 $03 .00/0 caused by the virus . In an effort to circumvent this problem, very restricted experimental conditions have been employed, such as studying all animals surviving one 50% lethal dose of JHMV . 4 Another approach has been to isolate mutants of JHMV which cause marked demyelination and minimal encephalitis .\"' Although these mutant viruses have yielded much useful and interesting information about JHMV pathogenesis, specific genetic lesions have not been identified in any of these mutants .\n\nWe and others have used monoclonal antibodies to select neutralization-resistant (NR) or antigenic variants of JHMV with altered biological properties .12 Although these viruses have not yet been directly characterized by nucleic acid sequencing, several lines of evidence, including their selection frequency and antigenic properties, and also sequencing data on NR variants of other viruses, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] suggest that the JHMV NR variants contain single point mutations . Thus, NR variants are ideal tools for studying viral pathogenesis, since the resulting disease may be linked to a discrete, definable genetic change in a single virus-encoded protein . 20 Antigenic variants were initially selected with monoclonal antibodies specific for the major JHMV envelope glycoprotein, E2 . E2 has several important biological activities, including virus attachment to target cells, induction of cell fusion, and the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies . 21-24 Thus, it was expected that viruses selected for putative mutations in E2 might have significant alterations in pathogenesis . As we have previously reported, JHMV NR mutants selected with monoclonal antibody J .2 .2 were in fact found to have markedly reduced neurovirulence and to cause a subacute, paralytic demyelinating disease . 12 The J .2 .2-selected variants had little or no tropism for neurons, and this feature may have accounted for their relative avirulence . Similar independently selected NR mutants of JHMV have been described by Dalziel et al.,\" Leibowitz (personal communication), and Wege (personal communication), also indicating a central role for E2 in JHMV pathogenesis .\n\nThe availability of NR variants which predominantly cause a paralytic-demyelinating disease allowed us to study this phenomenon while minimizing the confouding factor of encephalitis . We report here on the sequential selection and pathogenic characterization of additional NR variants which are resistant to two anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies . These double-NR or multisite variants did not cause clinical paralysis, although mild to moderate residual demyelination was found histologically . These studies show for the first time that a putative single point mutation in one viral gene is correlated with the degree of paralysis and demyelination induced by the virus during central nervous system (CNS) infection .\n\nTwo JHMV-specific, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, J .2 .2 and J .7 .2, were used to select JHMV variants resistant to neutralization . These monoclonal antibodies recognize separate sites on the major viral glycloprotein, E2 . 12 Variant 2 .2-V-1, originally selected from parental JHMV-DL for resistance to neutralization by monoclonal antibody J .2 .2, was used to select additional, multisite variants based on the ability to resist simultaneous neutralization with both J .2 .2 and J .7 .2 . Two plaquepurified isolates were studied in detail and designated 2 .2/7 .2-V-1 and 2 .2/7 .2-V-2 . The biological properties of the consecutive or double variant viruses are summarized in Table 1 .\n\nDifferential neutralization experiments (Table 2) showed that these double variants were resistant to neutralization with both selecting monoclonal antibodies . All viruses were sensitive to neutralization with mouse antisera to JHMV, and no virus was found to exhibit a temperature-sensitive phenotype (data not shown) . As we have previously reported, 12 viruses is shown in Table 3 . The single NR variant 2 .2-V-1 produced no encephalitic signs in mice ; however, paralysis was evident in 7 of 10 animals . Paralysis was severe in 2 of the 7 mice . Significantly, neither double NR variant caused clinically evident paralysis, although the double variant 2 .2/7 .2-V-1 caused early, usually mild, signs of encephalitis in 5 of 10 mice . In only one instance did this progress to a fatal outcome .\n\nIn view of the clinical differences in mice given the paralytic single variant or the non-paralytic double variants, it was of interest to compare histological changes in the CNS of mice inoculated with these viruses . Acutely, at days 3-4-post inoculation (p .i), most mice infected with either the single or the double NR variants showed minimal mononuclear cell infiltration of gray and white matter . As noted, these lesions were subclinical, except for the transient early encephalitic signs seen in some mice given 2 .2/7 .2-V-1 .\n\nSubacutely, at days 19-21 p .i ., there were little or no histologic abnormalities in the gray matter of the mice . Preliminary studies indicated that significant subacute pathological changes were limited to white matter regions . Accordingly, quantitative studies were done on coded sections of spinal cords obtained at 19 days p .i . (Fig . 1) . Single variant 2 .2-V-1 caused marked inflammation and myelin loss in 7 of 10 mice (Figs 1, 2(A)) . These mice also showed paralysis clinically . By contrast, both double variant viruses caused only mild or moderate white matter lesions in the majority of mice examined (Figs 1, 2(B), 3(C)) . Although these lesions were evident histologically, it is important to note that they were not of sufficient severity to cause observable paralysis .\n\nAs we have previously reported, NR variant 2 .2-V-1 will cause a fatal, subacute encephalitis when given at high doses, such as 10' PFU i .c . 12 Therefore, additional experiments were performed to evaluate the behavior of the double NR variants when given at 10' to 105 PFU i .c . Under these conditions it was possible to produce a subacute, fatal encephalitis with variant 2 .2/7 .2-V-1, but not with NR variant 2 .2/7 .2-V-2 . Although mice given high doses of either double NR variant continued to show foci of inflammation and myelin loss in the white matter, no mouse showed the extensive and severe demyelinating lesions characteristic of paralytic single variant 2 .2-V-1 (Fig . 2(A) ) . Significantly, neither 2 .2/7 .2-V-1 nor 2 .2/7 .2-V-2 produced clinically evident paralysis at any dose . We conclude that the disease caused by the double NR variants (non-paralytic) is a different type than that caused by single NR variant 2 .2-V-1 (paralytic) ; that is, the diminished demyelination caused by the double NR variants is not a quantitative effect which can be overcome by inoculating greater numbers of viruses . In order to assess the initial target cells of the viruses, the immunohistochemical studies summarized in Table 1 were undertaken at 3-4 days after 1000 PFU of each variant was given i .c . In all cases, viral antigen distribution was multifocal, rather than uniform . Nevertheless, each virus showed a consistent predilection for certain CNS regions and cell types . For example, JHMV-DL antigen was found in both white and gray matter; both neurons and glial cells contained abundant viral protein (Fig . 4(A) ) . By contrast, mice inoculated with single NR variant 2 .2-V-1 showed antigen in glial cells in white matter and, to a lesser extent, in gray matter (Fig . 4(B) ) ; however, as we have reported previously, 12 this variant did not appear to infect neurons . Similarly, the double NR variant 2 .2/7 .2-V-1 also showed marked preference for white matter and glial cells (Fig . 4(C) ) ; however, this variant occasionally infected neurons, although less frequently than the panencephalitic parental virus, JHMV-DL . Variant 2 .2/7 .2-V-1 usually involved neurons only when they were adjacent to heavily- (Fig . 4(D) ) . Inconsistent infection of ependymal cells and meninges was seen with all viruses . Subacutely, at 19 days after infection with any of the three NR variants, low levels of viral antigen could occasionally be found only in the white matter .\n\nIn view of the differing disease patterns and lesions caused by the NR variant viruses, we sought to determine the extent to which each virus replicated and retained phenotypic stability in vivo . Figure 5 shows the kinetics of viral replication in the brains of mice inoculated i .c . with 1000 PFU of each virus . Maximal viral titers in brain were observed at day 3 with the NR variants and day 5 with the parental virus JHMV- We conclude that the relative avirulence of the variants was unlikely to be due to diminished replication, since avirulent variant 2 .2/7 .2-V-1 grew nearly as well as highly encephalitic parental virus JHMV-DL . Similarly, the diminished demyelination shown by the double variants also could not be attributed to reduced replication, since the viral titers in mice given the double variants were usually equal to or greater than those in mice infected with the single variant 2 .2-V-1, which caused severe demyelination and clinically evident paralysis . All three variants showed phenotypic stability upon recovery at day 10 ; that is, they did not revert to the parental antigenic type, as judged by differential neutralizations performed as previously described . 12 19 We have extended the analysis of JHMV pathogenesis by sequentially selecting variants for resistance to neutralization by two monoclonal antibodies recognizing separate antigenic sites on the major glycoprotein of JHMV, the E2 molecule . Two double N R variants, 2 .2/7 .2-V-1 and 2 .2/7 .2-V-2, were compared to the single variant (2 .2-V-1) from which they were selected . While the double variants replicated relatively efficiently in vivo, they caused no clinically evident paralysis, in marked contrast to the paralysis readily produced by single variant 2 .2-V-1 . Histological studies showed that the severity of demyelination was substantially reduced in mice infected with the double NR variants . It is not known why the double NR variants, both selected by the same procedure, have minor pathogenic differences, for example, in relative tropism for neurons . In this regard, sequencing data on other NR variants has shown that a given monoclonal antibody may select several different mutations .\" Alternatively, it is possible that one of the variants has an additional point mutation ; however, in view of the selection frequency of JHM NR variants (approximately 10 -45 ), we believe this explanation is unlikely .\n\nPrevious reports have pointed out that JHMV pathogenesis depends upon multiple host and viral factors .' ,\" Nevertheless, analysis of JHMV antigenic variants suggests that key properties of the virus E2 glycoprotein play important roles in determining disease outcome . For example, our prior study 12 showed that J . The main finding of our present studies is that the double NR variants cause no paralysis clinically and reduced demyelination histologically . Presumably, a single point mutation in E2 distinguishes these variants from the single NR variant from which they were derived . These results imply that J .7 .2 binds to a site on E2 which has a major influence on the process of demyelination . Studies with recombinant viruses 29 with crossovers in the E2 gene (Makino et al., in press) suggest that the J .7 .2 binding site may be near the carboxyl terminus of E2 . Nevertheless, this subregion of E2 clearly cannot be the only viral determinant of demyelination, since the double NR mutants continue to cause low levels of subclinical myelin loss .\n\nIt is not known whether additional viral determinants of demyelination include regions of E2, near or distant from the J .7 .2-binding site, or whether the residual demyelination depends upon additional JHMV gene products . Interestingly, comparative binding studies with available NR variants and monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated that the site recognized by J .7 .2 is part of an overlapping complex in which at least three antigenically distinct subregions can be identified (Fleming, unpublished observations) . Also, as has been shown with other viral proteins, the antigenic determinants of E2 may depend on complex intramolecular steric and conformational effects . These effects may explain the fact that variant 2 .2-V-1 is resistant to monoclonal antibodies J .2 .2 and J .7 .2 when used separately but is consistently neutralized by these antibodies when used simultaneously . In other viral systems it has been demonstrated that the binding of one monoclonal antibody may enhance the binding of a second monoclonal antibody to a distant site on a viral protein .'\"' The possibility that such synergism may underlie the action of J .2 .2 and J .7 .2 is currently under investigation .\n\nIn view of the complexity of the J .7 .2 site, as well as the residual demyelination shown by the double NR variants, it may not be possible to define a single linear locus on E2 which is the necessary and sufficient cause of virus-induced demyelination .\n\nFurther studies, such as the selection of other variants, RNA sequencing of variants, determination of viral tropism for different types of glial cells, and the characterization of cellular receptors for JHMV, may clarify this issue . Finally, these studies of JHMV pathogenesis eventually must be considered in the context of host factors, including the immune system and the intrinsic resistance of different CNS cells to JHMV .\n\nViruses, cells, animals, antibodies . The isolation and characterization of JHMV-DL, from which variant viruses were derived, as well as the derivation of single antigenic variant virus 2 .2-V-1, have previously been described . 12 Viruses were propagated and plaque assayed on DBT or L2 cells .\" Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine), seronegative for murine coronaviruses, were used in all experiments 48-72 hours after receipt . Mice were inoculated i .c . with a 30 yl volume containing various numbers of PFU of virus as indicated in each experiment . Hyperimmune and monoclonal antibodies to JHMV were made in this laboratory . 22 Negative control antibody 7 .16 .17 (anti-H-21 P) was a gift from Dr Jeffrey Frelinger, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill .\" The temperature sensitivity of virus plaque formation was assayed as previously described . 12 Quantitation of infectious virus in brain and spinal cord samples was performed by assay of tissue homogenates on L2 cells as previously described .212\n\nSelection of double antigenic variant viruses. Variant viruses were selected as previously described . 12 Briefly, variant virus 2 .2-V-1 was incubated with an excess of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies J .2 .2 and J .7 .2 . Surviving viruses were isolated and subjected to three cycles of plaque-purification . To neutralize any possible revertant viruses, incubation with the selecting monoclonal antibodies was performed prior to each plaque-purification . Before use, viruses were tested by differential neutralization 12 with the selecting monoclonal antibodies and negative control antibody, 7 .16 .17 ; if the titers of the two assays were within 1 log 10 unit of each other, the virus was considered to be resistant to neutralization . Viruses failing to meet this criterion were considered revertants and were discarded .\n\nClinical observations . The clinical status of infected mice was judged by a modification of the criteria of Brown et al.\" Animals were considered normal if they appeared alert and could turn over within 2 seconds after being placed on their backs . Mice that had a waddling gait and inability to rapidly turn over were scored as having mild paralysis . Mice with frank hindleg immobility were scored as having severe paralysis . Animals with hyperirritability or myoclonus were judged to have mild encephalitic signs ; seizures, persistent turning, or static, hunched postures were considered to be signs of severe encephalitis . Mice were scored by a single examiner after the cages had been coded with randomized numbers .\n\nHistology. Brain and spinal cords were embedded in paraffin or epon and stained as previously described . 12 The severity of histologic lesions was assessed by grading randomized, coded microscopic sections . Gray matter involvement was considered severe if lesions were extensive and there was marked inflammatory cell infiltration and neuronophagia ; lesser degrees of involvement were scored moderate or mild . White matter involvement was considered severe if there was intense, widespread inflammatory infiltrates with rarefaction ; white matter involvement with less inflammation and no tissue rarefaction was scored as moderate or mild, depending on the extent of lesions . Demyelination was evaluated in paraffin-embedded sections stained with luxol fast blue or with epon-embedded sections stained with toluidine blue . For immunohistochemistry, sections of paraffin-embedded tissue were stained by an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase procedure (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California), using monoclonal antibodies to the JHMV N protein 23 as primary antibodies .
