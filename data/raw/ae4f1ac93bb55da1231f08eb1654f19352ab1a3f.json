{"title": "Viral etiology of Acute Respiratory Infections in Hospitalized", "body": "human bocavirus (BoV) are the most common viral agents associated with ARIs, 32 accounting for around 70 % of ARIs [3, 4] . The frequency of mixed respiratory viral 33 detection varies from10%to 30% in hospitalized children [5] [6] [7] . In addition, several 34 new human respiratory viruses have been described in recent years, including human 35 metapneumovirus [8, 9] , human bocavirus, and novel human coronaviruses, 36 including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [10], human 37 coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63), HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) [11] , and Middle East 38 respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) [12] . 39 Although the majority of ARIs are associated with respiratory viruses, antibiotics December 2013 to April 2017 were enrolled in the investigation. There were 824 110 males (52.8%) and 736 females (47.2%), and the patient's ages ranged from 3 111 months to 15 years. The majority of them (43.2%) were between 1 and 3 years old.\n\nThe age distribution is shown in Table 1 .

There was no 122 significant difference in the incidence of respiratory viral infection between boys 123 (601/824; 72.9%) and girls (527/736; 71.6%) (\u03c7 2 = 0.345, p>0.05). The respiratory 124 virus positive rate appeared to decrease with age. The lowest positive rate was 125 observed in the age group of more than 6 years old (167/302; 55.3%), while the 126 positive rates in age groups less than 6 years old were more than 70% (Table 1) .\n\nStatistically significant difference was observed between the age group of more than 128 6 years old and other age groups (\u03c7 2 = 54.113, p<0.01). No statistically significant 129 difference was observed among the age groups less than 1 year old, 1 -3 years, and HBoV with the detection rates higher than 5.0%. The positivity rates of HCoV and 143 HAdV were lower than 5.0% (Fig 2) . Among detected respiratory viruses, HRV, HPIV, HCoV, and HAdV did not have 155 statistically significant difference in the distribution among the different age groups.\n\nHMPV was detected in age group less than 1 year old much more frequently than in 157 children older than 1 year (\u03c7 2 = 6.627, p<0.05). HBoV was significantly more 158 frequently observed in children younger than 3 years old compare with children of 159 4 -15 years old (\u03c7 2 = 28.523, p<0.005). The incidence of RSV decreased 160 significantly with increasing age (p < 0.05) dropping from 35.1% in children 161 younger than 1 year old to 5.3% in the school-age children (7 -15 years old group), 162 while the reverse relationship was observed for IFV (Fig 3) . The data was analyzed with regard to the seasonality. Figure 4 illustrates the monthly [32] . In contrast, we collected samples only during epidemic 241 seasons of ARIs, so the positivity rate in our study was considerably higher.\n\nFurthermore, acute respiratory infections can be caused by viruses that are not yet 243 known, as well as bacteria that have not been included in these studies [13] . 244 We found that the prevalence of respiratory viruses did not differ between boys and under the 5 years of age, that is associated with immaturity of the immune system 291 and, thus, greater susceptibility to infection [44] . In our study, we significantly more 292 frequently detected cases of simultaneous infection with two or more viruses in 293 children under 7 years of age compared with children of school age (12.2% versus 294 3.4%), while there was no significant difference in the incidence of viral co-infection 295 between the age groups of 0 -1 year, 1-3 years and 4 -6 years. .
