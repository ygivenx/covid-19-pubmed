{"title": "A Versatile Bifunctional Dendritic Cell Targeting Vaccine Vector", "body": "Dendritic cells (DC) are the most specialized and potent antigen presenting cells in the immune system. DC plays a critical role in innate and adaptive immune responses, especially in priming and activating T cell and B cell immunity. Several clinical trials have been initiated for human tumor immunotherapy based on ex vivo stimulation of DC; however, the clinical responses have been observed in a minority of patients and the procedure is very costly and laborious. In vivo targeting of DC via surface receptors may present an alternative simpler route for targeted immunotherapy. 1 DC utilize several surface receptors (Gb3/CD77,2 CD40, 3 \u03b22 integrins, 4 Fc receptors, 5 and C-type lectin receptors 6 ) to internalize, process and present antigens to MHC class I and MHC class II pathways. 7 A number of DC receptors have been studied extensively for antigen targeting. 1,7 DEC-205 is a C-type lectin receptor that is present on both immature and mature DC in lymphoid tissues, lymph nodes and spleen. 8-12 DEC-205 targeting of antigens by an antibody along with costimulatory molecules is an efficient strategy to achieve protection of the host against tumor growth, 4 rejection of an existing tumor, 13 protection against a virus airway challenge, 14 as well as enhanced resistance to an established rapidly growing tumor or viral infection. 15 Moreover, DEC-205 targeting of a single protein enables cross-presentation of several peptides more efficiently than CD206 and CD209 16 and induces stronger T cell immunity at much lower doses of protein antigen, plasmid DNA or recombinant adenovirus. 14 In the absence of costimulation, DEC-205 targeting of antigen can be used to suppress the development of autoimmunity, such as type 1 diabetes. 17 Generation of the antibody-mediated antigen targeting system is often complex, costly and a timeconsuming process. In addition, it requires either liposomal encapsulation of the antigen, 4 chemical cross-linking 13, 15, 17, 18 or construction of a new hybrid antibody. 14,16,19 These designs may not be suitable for comparison studies with different antigens such as glycolipids and DNA and also in vivo targeting of multiple antigens.\n\nWe have previously reported the development of a quadroma (hybrid-hybridoma) based full length bispecific monoclonal antibody (bsmAb) for targeting of biotinylated protein antigens to DEC-205. 20 The successful targeting of biotinylated proteins to DC augmented immune responses against the antigen at a \u223c500-fold lower dose; however, quadromas express the bsmAb along with parental and unwanted heavy and light chain combinations. 21 Furthermore, the antibody-based biotin binding is several orders weaker than streptavidin. Consequently, we have now designed a truncated recombinant construct to demonstrate the versatility of this DC targeting vehicle to deliver four categories of antigens: proteins, a peptide, glycolipids and DNA.\n\nA scFv that recognizes DEC-205 receptor of DC was successfully cloned from the HB290 hybridoma, fused with a truncated core-streptavidin domain and expressed in Escherichia coli using the T7 expression system. The monomeric form of the fusion protein was affinity purified and the bifunctional activity was demonstrated by ELISA and Western blot. In vivo DC targeting and immune response studies in mice were initiated with a variety of biotinylated antigens ( Table 2 ). In the presence of bfFp and costimulatory anti-CD40 mAb, both humoral and cell-mediated responses were estimated.\n\nDC 2.4 is a DEC-205 expressing mouse bone marrow DC cell-line transduced with GM-CSF, myc and raf oncogenes. 22 HB290, a rat antimouse DEC-205 hybridoma, was obtained from ATCC.

Biotinylated gangliosides (GM2 and GM3) and BSA conjugates were courtesy of Dr. D. Bundle (University of Alberta, Canada, unpublished data). Anthrax Protective Antigen (PA), extracted from the S-layer of recombinant Caulobacter crescentus, was gift of Dr. J. Smit (University of British Columbia, Canada). Tables 1 and 2 . SARS-CoV spike DNA, SARS-CoV membrane DNA, EBOV GP1,2 DNA were PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplified using primers WP011 and WP012, WP013 and WP014, or WP015 and WP016 respectively (Table 1) . These primers inserted Kozak translation initiation sequence and initiation codon (ATG) into the restriction sites BamHI and EcoRI. The PCR fragments were gel-purified, double digested with BamHI and EcoRI, ligated to pVAX1 mammalian expression vector and transformed into TOP10 cells. The positive clones were screened by restriction digestion fragment mapping (BamHI and EcoRI) and then biotinylated using photobiotin acetate. 25 Core-streptavidin, WEEV E1, WEEV E2 and EBOV GP1 (subfragment D) proteins were prepared based on our published work. 26-29 EBOV GP2, SARS-CoV spike S1, S2, RBD and membrane proteins were produced from E. coli expression system (unpublished data). All antigens for immunization were labeled with commercial biotin derivatives. DNA vectors were biotinylated using photobiotin acetate (B-pVHX-6, B-pEBOV GP1,2, B-pSARS-CoV spike, B-pSARS-CoV membrane) by UV photoconjugation. 25 All proteins were labeled with NHS-LC-biotin (B-OVA, B-SARS-CoV spike RBD, B-EBOV GP1, B-anthrax PA). Synthetic biotinylated glycolipids (B-GM2, B-GM3, B-BSA-GM2, B-BSA-GM3) and the biotinylated cancer peptide (B-MUC-1) were synthetically labeled with biotin. Biotinylation of all antigens was confirmed by dot blot assay probed with streptavidin-HRPO.\n\nThe HB290 scFv was generated from the hybridoma cell lines and DNA sequencing was done using established protocol. 30 The various cloning designs of HB290 scFv and bfFp are diagrammatically shown in Figure 1 . The genes were cloned in different orientations to determine the best expression in E. coli. The heavy and light chain variable regions with or without partial constant regions of anti-DEC205 antibody were amplified from plasmids containing HB290 Fab DNA by PCR and cloned into pET-22b (+) plasmids. The heavy chain variable region gene of HB290 was fused to the 3\u2032 end of the light chain variable region gene with a linker of 15 amino acids from the constant heavy chain region 1 sequence using PCR (PCR primers: WP005 to WP008). Subsequent restriction digest/ligation methods were employed to generate the V H -V L scFv gene ( Figure 1A ). The PCR primers WP005 and WP006 were inserted into the restriction sites EcoRI and SalI; PCR primers WP007 and WP008 were inserted into the SalI and NotI sites. The PCR fragments were gel-purified, double digested to the respective inserted restriction sites, and ligated to pET-22b (+) plasmids. The V L -V H scFv gene was generated by the same methods utilizing PCR primers WP001 to WP004. WP001 and WP002 were inserted into the EcoRI and SalI and WP003 and WP004 were inserted into the SalI and NotI sites. The light chain variable region gene of HB290 was fused to the 3\u2032 end of the heavy chain variable region gene via 15 amino acids of the constant light chain sequence ( Figure 1B ). Both scFv orientations were inserted into pET-22b (+) containing the corestreptavidin gene 31 in 3\u2032 orientation fusion with the core-streptavidin gene ( Figures 1C and  1D ). The V L -V H scFv gene was fused to the 5\u2032 terminus with the core-streptavidin gene by the same method described above ( Figure 1E ). In brief, the core-streptavidin gene was PCR amplified using WP009 and WP010 primers. These primers were inserted into restriction sites NotI and XhoI. The PCR fragment was gel-purified, double digested with NotI and XhoI, and ligated to pET-22b (+) containing the V L -V H scFv gene ( Figure 1E ). All clones were screened and characterized by both PCR and restriction digestion fragment mapping. The positive cloned fragment was sequenced using T7 promoter and terminator primers employing CEQ2000. The positive clones were designated as follows: (a) pWET5 encoding core-streptavidin-V H -V L , (b) pWET6 encoding core-streptavidin-V L -V H and (c) pWET7 encoding V L -V H -corestreptavidin.\n\n2.4.1. Expression of HB290 scFv and bfFp-Expressions of scFv and bfFp were done according to the previously published methods. 31 The pET-22b (+)-scFv or bfFp genes (pWET5-7) were chemically transformed into BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL. The E. coli transformants were cultured, induced for protein expression and the whole-cell bacterial pellets were analyzed by Western blot. The pellets were resuspended in reducing SDS dye (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and heated at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min prior to SDS-PAGE. The pellets were electrophoresed and transferred to a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane using the Trans blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then blocked with 5% skim milk, probed with mouse anti-His 6 mAb and GAM-HRPO, and revealed by ECL according to the manufacturer's protocol. The bfFp gene with the highest protein expression level was selected for medium scale expression in culture flask and affinity purification was performed from E. coli periplasmic extracts using IMAC purification protocol as described previously. 31 The induced periplasm and IMAC purified fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions following staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. The fractions were heated at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min prior to loading on the polyacrylamide gel.\n\nStability of bfFp-IMAC purified bfFp was heated at either 60 or 95 \u00b0C for 10 min under reducing conditions and resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with B-BSA followed by streptavidin-HRPO.\n\nseeded on a 96-well V-bottomed plate (Nunc, Denmark) in quadruplicate (1.0 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well). The plates were washed with PBS (phosphate buffer saline) and blocked with 1% PBS dialyzed BSA (to remove traces of biotin) for 3 h at 4 \u00b0C. After incubation, the plates were washed with PBS, and 100 \u03bcL of bfFp at 40 \u03bcg/mL was added to bind DEC-205 receptors. The plates were incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 3 h, then washed with PBS and B-OVA (20 \u03bcg/mL in 100 \u03bcL volume) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. After the incubation, the plates were washed and then incubated with streptavidin-HRPO (10 \u03bcg/mL in 100 \u03bcL volume) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. Finally, the plates were washed with PBS, and TMB substrate was then added. The OD 650 nm was taken after 15 min using an ELISA V max kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp, CA) and subtracted with control (DC with only streptavidin-HRPO incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h). The DEC-205 receptor binding specificity of bfFp was confirmed by competition study with full-length HB290 mAb. Various concentrations of HB290 mAb (50, 100, 200 , 300 \u03bcg/mL in 100 \u03bcL volume) was added after bfFp binding to DEC-205 at 4 \u00b0C.\n\nThe full length HB290 mAb was incubated for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C to allow for displacement of bfFp from DC. Following a wash with PBS the bfFp was detected using B-OVA, streptavidin-HRPO and TMB as mentioned above.\n\nProtocol-Fifteen groups of female BALB/c mice (5 mice per group, average 6-8 weeks old) were obtained from Health Sciences Laboratory Animals Services of the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. Animal treatment, care and euthanasia were carried out according to the Canadian Council of Animal Care guidelines. Mice were injected subcutaneously near the inguinal lymph node area with 0.1 mL of various formulations of antigens and bfFp in saline. The immunization protocol is listed in Table 3 . Three separate animal experiments were conducted and each design has its own control group. The strategy was to test the versatility of bfFp based delivery of protein, peptide, glycolipids and DNA to DC in generating immune responses. Immunization of B-pVHX-6, B-OVA, B-MUC-1, B-GM2 and GM3 were performed in the first experiment (Groups 2-7). Animals in Group 2-4 were injected with various biotinylated DNA formulations to verify the essential requirement for DC targeting vehicle and costimulatory molecule. Group 2 mice were immunized with B-pVHX-6 and bfFp without the presence of anti-CD40 mAb to verify the essential role of anti-CD40 mAb costimulation. Group 3 mice were coimmunized with anti-CD40 mAb without the bfFp targeting vector to determine the nontargeted immune responses. Group 4 mice were coimmunized with both bfFp and anti-CD40 mAb. Protein antigen delivery was studied in Group 5 mice and peptide delivery was focused in Group 6 mice. Lastly, glycolipid antigens were investigated in Group 7. The second experiment was designed to confirm the versatility of the naked DNA delivery strategy. A variety of infectious disease viral DNA were targeted as a single antigen to DC using the bfFp mediated delivery system (Group 9, EBOV GP1,2 DNA; Group 10, SARS-CoV spike DNA; Group 11, SARS-CoV membrane DNA). Multivalent immune responses against a mixture of different class antigens were studied in the third experiment. Groups 13-15 were designed to evaluate the multivalent immune responses against proteins and peptide, B-OVA, B-EBOV GP1, B-SARS-CoV spike RBD, B-MUC-1 and B-anthrax PA immunized as a mixture in saline. Group 13 mice were coimmunized with anti-CD40 mAb and core-streptavidin without the bfFp to determine the level of nontargeted immune responses. Group 14 mice were coimmunized with bfFp without the presence of anti-CD40 mAb to verify the essential role of anti-CD40 mAb costimulation. Group 15 mice were immunized with antigens, bfFp and anti-CD40 mAb. Groups 1, 8 and 12 were the control groups for the three separate animal experiments. All mice were boosted with the same concentration of antigen(s) in each category in PBS 12 days following primary immunization. Prior to immunization, every reagent (antigens, bfFp and mAb) was checked using LAL PYROGENT Plus Single Test Vials kits to identify lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contamination if any (endotoxin sensitivity at 0.125 EU/mL). The immunization reagents were premixed for 30 min at RT prior to immunization. The mice were sacrificed after 9 days of boost, and the blood and the spleen were collected. The serum was isolated using standard procedures 32 and used to evaluate humoral immune responses. Spleens were used to study IFN-gamma immune responses. The spleens from the 15 different groups of immunized mice were aseptically removed and each group was pooled. The responder cells were isolated using nylon wool columns and the stimulator cells from a separate group of na\u00efve mouse spleens and were treated with mitomycin C as previously described. 20\n\nResponses and IFN-\u03b3-Antibody titers were measured individually in each mouse by ELISA following immunization of the respective antigen ( Table 2 ). The ELISA method was done by overnight coating of the specific antigen in the Nunc 96-well ELISA microplates (10 \u03bcg/mL in 100 \u03bcL volume). After overnight coating, the plates were washed with PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.3) and the plates were blocked with BSA for 3 h at RT. After incubation, the plates were washed with PBST and the 1:1000 diluted serum from each mouse in quadruplicate was added, incubated for 2 h at RT. Plates were then washed with PBST and incubated with GAM-HRPO for 1 h at RT. After 1 h, the plates were washed again with PBST and TMB was then added to each well and OD 650 nm was taken after 10 min using the microplate reader. IFN-\u03b3 activity was determined by the IFN-\u03b3 concentration generated after 3 days of incubation of the responder cells (2.5 \u00d7 10 5 cells) and/ or stimulator cells (3 \u00d7 10 5 cells) with the respective antigens: OVA, SARS-CoV spike RBD, EBOV GP1, EBOV GP2, EBOV GP1,2, SARS-CoV spike S1, SARS-CoV spike S2, SARS-CoV spike RBD, SARS-CoV membrane antigen, anthrax PA, B-MUC-1, B-GM2, B-GM3, WEEV E1 and WEEV E2 (10 \u03bcg of each antigen was separately incubated). IFN-\u03b3 ELISA Ready-SET-Go kit was used to determine the IFN-\u03b3 concentration.\n\ngroups of mice serum were tested against B-BSA, bfFp and core-streptavidin using ELISA method. The serum reactivity was determined by the same method as described in section 2.5.2. The plates were coated with either B-BSA, bfFp or core-streptavidin (10 \u03bcg/well). The rest of the procedures followed the preceding sections.\n\nThe genes encoding HB290 Fab were generated by RT-PCR and TD-PCR. The sequence generated was compared with the known mAb sequences in the NCBI BLAST database indicating the sequence is antibody related. The HB290 V L amino acid sequence from our recombinant clone was 100% identical to a previous report; 33 however, HB290 V H amino acid sequence (EVKLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTFNDFYMNWIRQPPGQAPEWLGVIRNKG NGYTTEVNTSVKGRFTISRDNTQNILYLQMNSLRAEDTAIYYCARGGPYYYSGDDA PYWGQGVMVTVSS) shared only 46% homology. The V H amino acid sequence appears to be unique from other published amino acid sequences in the NCBI protein database; whereas, the amino acid sequence published by Demangel et al. is 99% identical (only a two amino acid difference in the 5\u2032 terminal) with the single chain antibody against rice stripe virus protein P20 (accession: AAG28706). The HB290 V L -V H and V H -V L genes were successfully cloned into separate pET-22b (+) plasmids by PCR, restriction digest and DNA ligation methods. The plasmid vectors pWET5 and pWET6 were constructed by inserting the sequence encoding the HB290 single-chain anti-DEC205 antibody (V L -V H or V H -V L respectively) next to the pelB leader sequence of core-streptavidin containing pET22b (+) plasmids ( Figure 1A-D) . The plasmid vector pWET7 was constructed by inserting the core-streptavidin sequence into HB290 V L -V H scFv containing pET22b (+) plasmids ( Figure 1B and 1E) . The corestreptavidin sequence is at the N-terminus of the scFv in pWET5 and pWET6 constructs; whereas, in pWET7 the core-streptavidin is at the C-terminal. The scFv and bfFp vectors were transformed into E. coli, cultured, induced and the whole-cell bacterial pellets were analyzed by Western blot using the anti-His 6 mAb (Figure 2A) . The optimal scFv and bfFp orientation for expression were determined by Western blot. HB290 V L -V H scFv, pWET6 and pWET7 were successfully expressed and the proteins are shown at the desired molecular weight band either at \u223c30 kDa or \u223c46 kDa (Figure 2A ). pWET7 had a higher level of protein expression compared to pWET6; therefore, pWET7 was subjected to medium scale expression. The bfFp in the periplasmic space was extracted and affinity purified by IMAC column. Both the periplasmic fraction and the affinity purified fraction were analyzed on SDS-PAGE ( Figure  2B ). IMAC purification of the pWET7 bfFp was successful; a clear band was seen at 46 kD in the affinity purified fraction ( Figure 2B ). Approximately 1.0 mg of pWET7 bfFp was affinity purified from a 2 L culture.\n\nE. coli expressed bfFp appeared in 3 isoforms: monomeric, dimeric and tetrameric form. 34 Following affinity purification by either IMAC or iminobiotin column, the fusion protein was subjected to size exclusion chromatography for isolation of the tetrameric fusion protein. 34, 35 Fusion proteins are known to be heat sensitive and heating at 95 \u00b0C dissociates the tetramer completely into monomeric forms. The tetrameric form remains stable at temperature below 60 \u00b0C. 34 The bfFp isoforms and the biotin binding activity of the bfFp were analyzed by Western blot probed with B-BSA. pWET7 bfFp was detected using B-BSA and streptavidin-HRPO in Western blot and the bfFp appear predominantly in monomeric form after heating at either 60 or 95 \u00b0C ( Figure 3A) . The predominant monomeric form may be due to the difference in the linker between core-streptavidin and scFv. 31\n\nThe bispecificity of the bfFp was confirmed by cell ELISA. The anti-DEC-205 activity was demonstrated on DC 2.4 cells employing B-OVA with streptavidin-HRPO for detection. In addition, specific DEC-205 receptor binding activity was also confirmed by competitive displacement of bfFp with increasing concentrations of HB290 mAb ( Figure 3B ). In addition confocal study was done to demonstrate DC binding (unpublished data). Table 2 . The immunization protocol is described in Table 3 , and the results of humoral and cell-mediated responses are shown in Figures 4 and 5 . Humoral responses were measured by the antibody titers against the immunized antigens or its respective proteins from the DNA vectors in each mouse by ELISA method. The magnitude of cell-mediated immune responses was determined by the amount of IFN-\u03b3 secreted from spleen T cells in response to the antigens. The spleen cells from each group were pooled to average the quality of data for IFN-\u03b3 secretion. Responder cells from both immunized and nonimmunized mice without stimulator cells had minimal IFN-\u03b3 secretion (data not shown). The 15 groups of mice were divided into three different experiments to demonstrate the ability and efficacy of DC targeting strategies. Group 1, 8 and 12 were the control groups for the three separate animal experiments and these groups were immunized and boosted with PBS only. In these groups both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were minimal (Figure 4 and 5).\n\nGroups 2-7 were designed to demonstrate the versatility of bfFp based delivery of distinct classes of antigens to DC in generating immune responses. Group 2-4 mice focused on the naked DNA delivery to DC and to verify the essential requirement of bfFp and anti-CD40 mAb. Group 2 mice were immunized with B-pVHX-6 and bfFp without the presence of anti-CD40 mAb. Group 3 mice were coimmunized with anti-CD40 mAb without the bfFp based targeting. Group 4 mice were coimmunized with both bfFp and anti-CD40 mAb. The results indicate that Group 4 had the highest antibody titer and augmented IFN-\u03b3 secretion against the WEEV E1 and WEEV E2 proteins compared to Groups 1-3 ( Figures 4A and 5A) . Immune responses against WEEV E2 appeared to be higher than WEEV E1 in Group 4. Immune responses in Groups 2 and 3 were minimal toward WEEV E1 and E2 protein antigens, and were probably due to LPS, anti-CD40 mAb or bfFp effect (Figures 4A and 5A ). Anti-CD40 mAb and bfFp appeared to be essential for DNA targeting strategy. The similar immunization strategy was applied to the synthetic biotinylated peptide MUC-1 and glycolipids (GM2 and GM3). Ovalbumin was also included in our experiments as a model antigen and control. Humoral responses and cell-mediated immune responses were shown in mice immunized with protein (Group 5), peptide (Group 6) and glycolipids (Group 7) in the presence of bfFp and anti-CD40 mAb (Figures 4A and 5A ). In summary, the results show that anti-CD40 mAb and bfFp are required to achieve good immune responses based on DC delivery of DNA, protein, peptide and even gangliosides.\n\nDirect biotinylated DNA targeting to DC also generated strong immune responses against the respective DNA encoding proteins. The same targeting strategy was applied for a variety of infectious disease DNA. Groups 9-11 were immunized with different naked DNA vectors encoding genes for different viral proteins (Group 9, EBOV GP1,2 DNA; Group 10, SARS-CoV spike DNA; Group 11, SARS-CoV membrane DNA). pEBOV GP1,2 encoded the EBOV GP1 and GP2 proteins, pSARS-CoV spike encoded the SARS-CoV S1, S2, RBD and the transmembrane domain, and pSARS-CoV membrane encoded the SARS-CoV membrane protein. Strong humoral and cell-mediated responses were achieved against the encoded viral proteins by targeting the viral DNA to DC (Figures 4B and 5B) . EBOV GP1 generated the highest immune responses compared to GP2 and GP1,2. The immune responses against mammalian expressed GP1,2 protein were lower than the E. coli expressed fragments (GP1 and GP2) (Figures 4B and 5B) . The immune response against EBOV GP1,2 was relatively lower than its E. coli fragment. This may be due to the glycosylation masking of the epitopes. 48 There was no significant difference in serum titer between SARS-CoV spike proteins, but higher IFN-\u03b3 concentrations were found in SARS-CoV RBD. Figures 4C and 5C ). Groups 13-15 showed minimal immune responses against EBOV GP1 (Figures 4C and 5C ). In Group 15, the highest antibody titer was found against OVA and the lowest against anthrax PA ( Figure 4C) ; however, the highest IFN-\u03b3 secretion was found against anthrax PA ( Figure  5C ). Minimal humoral or cell-mediated immune responses were generated from Groups 12-14 ( Figures 4C and 5C ). MUC-1 and OVA immune responses were compared between the single antigen and multiple antigen targeting strategies. Higher IFN-\u03b3 secretion and serum titer against MUC-1 were achieved in the single antigen targeting strategy of MUC-1 peptide antigen (Group 6) compared to the multiple antigen targeting strategy (Group 15) (Figures 4A, 4C, 5A, 5C). Although the serum titer against OVA was not different between Groups 5 and 15 ( Figures 4A and 4C) , Group 5 had higher IFN-\u03b3 secretion compared to Group 15 ( Figures  5A and 5C ). To summarize, both bfFp and anti-CD40 mAb are required to achieve strong immune responses against protein and peptide delivered to DC. Single antigen targeting appears to achieve strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in comparison to multiple antigen targeting strategy. Immune responses were shifted or selective in the multiantigen targeting method, possibly toward immunodominant antigens.\n\nSerum titer against biotin, bfFp and core-streptavidin were analyzed from every group to evaluate the immunogenicity of the bfFp targeting vehicle. Identical concentrations of bfFp and core-streptavidin were coated onto the plate. Serum reactivity was found to some extent against core-streptavidin (OD \u223c0.25) and bfFp (OD \u223c0.15). However, this level of serum reactivity is not different compare to the control groups ( Figure 6 ). The serum reactivity toward B-BSA was minimal in all groups (OD \u223c0.01).\n\nIn vivo targeting of the DC DEC-205 receptor has been shown to be effective in generating immune responses to protect the host against cancer, viral infection and autoimmune disease. Four types of DEC-205 targeting systems have been reported thus far. These include (a) HB290 scFv coated liposome, 4 (b) chemical cross-linking of HB290 with antigen, 13,15,17,18 (c) HB290 hybrid antibody 14,16,19 and (d) bsmAb targeting system. 20 Several limitations are seen in these systems. Currently, the above strategies have only demonstrated efficient delivery of peptides or proteins to DC. These delivery systems may not be versatile or flexible enough for clinical applications, comparison studies with different antigens, and in vivo targeting of multiple antigens such as DNA and glycolipids. Limitations of the scFv coated liposome targeting strategy include instability of the scFv on the liposome surface (scFv could be lost during circulation), liposome instability, scale-up issues, relative complexity in the encapsulation process and only certain class of antigens can be encapsulated efficiently. Additional issues include batch to batch variation (cross-linking and purification) and Fc domain mediated effects, which are limitations of the chemical cross-linking of the whole mAb with antigen. Hybrid antibody or recombinant antigen fusion protein generation using a mammalian expression system is labor intensive requiring careful monitoring of cell productivity, post-translational chemical modifications, degradation and aggregation of the final product. 49 Furthermore, a new antibody fusion protein is required for each antigen (protein or peptide) and the process is often time-consuming and costly. The bsmAb produced from a quadroma is not ideal for clinical application and the limitations include the yield and purity. 20 The major disadvantage for these systems could be dose-limiting toxicity (prolonged circulation time) and immunogencity against the targeting system, which can alter pharmacokinetics (biodistribution and clearance), block receptor-antigen interactions, and induce hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions. 49 Consequently, a truncated monomeric single-chain antibody-core-streptavidin fusion protein (bfFp) that can form a complex with any biotinylated antigen (K d \u223c 10 \u221215 M) with one paratope and deliver the antigen to the DC via the DEC-205 receptor with its second paratope may be a desired alternative for in vivo DC targeting. This system has several unique properties over the other targeting systems. Almost any class of antigen can be biotinylated by chemical conjugation (for instance, NHS-LC-biotin), photoactivation (photobiotin acetate) or incorporation by synthetic strategies. Biotinylation avoids the need of encapsulation, chemical cross-linking, or construction of a new hybrid fusion antibody. The bfFp lacks the Fc domain and the E. coli based production is consistent and economical. Faster clearance rate (kidney glomerular filtration cutoff is 70 kDa) and lower immunogenicity is expected due to the smaller molecular weight (\u223c46 kDa) of the vector. If required, bfFp stability and half-life can be increased by polyethylene glycol linkage 50 or by isolation of the tetrameric form of the bfFp. Moreover, such a targeting vehicle can be translated into clinical applications. 51, 52 In this communication, we have developed a versatile bfFp that can bind any biotinylated antigen and target them to DC DEC-205 receptors using recombinant antibody technology. DEC-205 receptor binding specificity was also confirmed via competitive binding replacement of bfFp with the full length HB290 mAb study. In vivo studies in mice with biotinylated DNA (WEEV, EBOV GP1,2, SARS-CoV spike, SARS-CoV membrane), protein (OVA), peptide (MUC-1) or glycolipid (GM2 and GM3) have shown that in the presence of bfFp and anti-CD40 mAb as costimulator, both humoral and cell-mediated responses can be augmented. In the multiple antigen targeting strategy, we have also achieved humoral and cell-mediated responses for OVA, SARS-CoV spike RBD, MUC-1 and anthrax PA. Most antigens were administered at the very low doses of 200 ng by our DC targeting strategy. With respect to the above data, an in vivo fluorescence imaging would decisively establish the specificity for in vivo targeting and we propose to do this in the future. Such antigen sparing strategies are important to pandemic disease management if large populations need vaccination. We have made theoretical calculations that suggest that in the event of a SARS or H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in Canada, the DC targeted vaccine needed to cover 33 M subjects require only 7 g (at 200 ng dose) of the vaccine antigen. In comparison, a recent commercial influenza vaccine clinical trial used 90 \u03bcg/patient with modest immune responses requires 3 kg of antigen (450fold more). Our speculation is that DC targeting more efficiently delivers the antigen to the DC than the conventional subcutaneous vaccine that could encounter prolonged exposure to enzymes and uptake by other none DC cells. Another important application is the delivery of multiple pathogen antigens for combination vaccines that could provide sufficient protection for first emergency responders and biodefense applications.\n\nIn summary, our DC targeting approach achieves strong immune responses against all classes of antigen. Single antigen targeting exhibited strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. In comparison, multiantigen targeting strategy likely exhibited immune responses that are shifted toward the most immunogenic antigen. Higher immune responses were achieved for weak immunogens (MUC-1 and OVA) in single antigen targeting strategy compared to multivalent strategy. We have also demonstrated that DEC-205 targeting of bioterrorism agent DNA's (EBOV GP1,2, SARS-CoV spike, WEEV structural DNA) induces strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against the DNA encoded proteins. In this targeting formulation, low concentrations of biotinylated DNA (500 ng) in saline were adequate to achieve a strong immune response in mice. In contrast, conventional DNA vaccine or therapy strategy often requires high concentration and multiple immunizations, and cannot efficiently induce immune responses. More importantly, the widely used experimental viral vector based gene targeting strategies have caused severe adverse side-effects including death. We speculate that in the absence of such viral vector the naked biotinylated DNA targeting could be a safer alternative. In vitro and in vivo neutralization study of SARS-CoV and EBOV and challenge study of WEEV are in progress. The immune responses toward either the hapten biotin (B-BSA) or the carrier bfFp is minimal and can be further mitigated by deimmunization strategies. The slight reactivity toward bfFp appears to be against the core-streptavidin portion of the fusion protein. The bfFp targeting of biotinylated antigens to DC could be a convenient, versatile method to deliver single or multiple antigens to DC. Such formulations could induce immune responses toward peptide, protein, glycolipid, and DNA vaccine based expression products. bfFp targeting of DC may be a potential candidate for the development of vaccine or therapy for cancer (GM3, GM2, MUC-1) and bioterrorism agents (WEEV, EBOV, SARS-CoV, anthrax).\n\nTranslation of the in vivo targeting strategy to humans is likely to be more complex since DEC-205 receptors in humans may also target B cells, NK cells, T cells, monocytes and thymic epithelial cells. In addition, multiple immunizations may be required to achieve adequate immune responses in human. In fact even in our mouse model, the bfFp is only injected once followed by nontargeted booster dose. Analysis of humoral immune responses to biotinylated antigens in vivo. Groups of five mice were immunized with different antigen combinations along with a PBS control. The specific components, amounts, and the schedule of immunizations are outlined in Table 3 . The mice were analyzed individually, and the data was pooled. The humoral response, as quantified by serum antibody titers on day 21 post immunization, was measured by ELISA method against the respective antigens shown in X-axis (listed in Table 2 ). The method involved coating of 100 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcg/mL antigen in microtiter plates followed by addition of 1:1000 diluted serum antibody, and detection using GAM-HRPO. The ELISA measurements were done in quadruplicate for each mouse. The mean ELISA values obtained for each individual mouse were further averaged. The error bars represent the standard deviation in a group of 5 mice. Table 2 and 3) were isolated and purified using a nylon wool column. The five spleens in each group were pooled and mixed in DMEM prior to nylon wool purification. Stimulator cells prepared from na\u00efve mice spleen cells were isolated and treated with mitomycin C. Purified responder cells from both immunized and nonimmunized mice were Analysis of serum reactivity toward biotin, bfFp and core-streptavidin. The mice (5 mice per group) were analyzed individually, and the data was pooled. The mouse groups are listed on the X-axis and correspond to Table 3 . Groups 1, 8 and 12 were the control groups with only PBS immunization. Other groups have been immunized in the presence or absence of the bfFp (according to Table 3 ). The serum reactivity, as quantified by serum antibody titers on day 21 post immunization, was measured by ELISA method against B-BSA, bfFp and corestreptavidin (shown in the figure legend). The method involved coating of 100 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcg/ mL antigen (shown in the figure legend) in microtiter plates followed by addition of 1:1000 diluted serum antibody, and detection using GAM-HRPO. The ELISA measurements were done in quadruplicate for each mouse. The mean ELISA values obtained for each individual mouse were further averaged. The error bars represent the standard deviation in a group of 5 mice.
