These diseases also provoke emotional responses in patients that are different than many other clinical conditions. Compounding this is the constant addition of newly \"discovered\" infections. New infectious disease entities seem to be in the news on a regular basis. As evidenced by the recent global fear surrounding the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 and Zika virus potentially impacting the Olympics. In addition to these widely reported diseases, we have Chikungunya virus, pandemic C difficile, drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus, various tick-borne diseases, and many others. The development of this issue is wide ranging with nearly every major organ system being represented. While you will find several of the topics familiar, there are also updates on infections that have transitioned as diseases that will be managed more frequently in the future by physician assistants. As an example, progressive medical updates regarding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) now have significant implications for both primary and specialty physician assistants. From the dramatic change in pharmacologic options over the last few years for HCV to pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV, physician assistants are now on the frontline of patient management for these infectious diseases.\n\nWhile many infectious diseases are encountered and managed by the primary care provider, many infectious diseases are optimally managed as part of a team with an infectious disease specialist. A recent study has demonstrated infectious disease consultation with lower health care costs and mortality. 1 "}
