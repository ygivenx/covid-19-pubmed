{"title": "SUBJECT AREAS TITLE Discovery of a divergent HPIV4 from respiratory secretions using second and third generation metagenomic sequencing", "body": "Microbial screening -Immunological and PCR based assays All secretions were initially tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using immunological tests including Immunofluorescence or membrane ELISA. As only 36% of the samples collected in the RSV season tested positive, we additionally tested them for a range of viral and bacterial pathogens (see methods). The full results are available upon request. Briefly, the extensive PCR testing revealed that ~46% of the secretions tested positive for RSV, ~20% for various picornaviruses and smaller proportions of a range of other respiratory pathogens (Supplementary Table S1 ). In 75% of secretions a pathogen was found, where in 20% of the samples more than one pathogen was identified. A summary of detected viral and bacterial pathogens using PCRbased-assays in children with one or multiple infections is listed in Supplementary Table S2 . With the exception HPIV4, all viruses identified using deep sequencing in this study had been previously screened using hybridization-based methods (Supplementary Table S1 ). Despite the increased sensitivity of PCR based assays, these results emphasize the limitations of PCR based identification of microbial pathogens in the public health setting. The largest proportion of humanvirus-sequences identified (61%) was taxonomically classified as HPIV4, with most sequences predominating from one high titer sample. The second largest portion of human-virus-reads derived from human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (19%), which also predominately originated from one specimen. All identified coronavirus sequences were identified as the OC43 strain, accounting for 7% of the sequence reads. Finally, small subsets of reads to four known respiratory viruses were identified in some samples, including influenza A (n=1), human parainfluenza virus 3 (n=1), adenovirus (n=2) and human rhinovirus (n=3), two of which mapped to the recently proposed type C species 9 . Efforts in characterizing the HRV-C genomes are currently ongoing.\n\nIn addition to the analysis of sequence reads, contigs were also generated from each sample and classified using BLASTn and BLASTx expectation (E) scores from searches against the entire GenBank, with the highest scoring hit used to assign taxonomy. The assembly of filtered reads generated several contigs, however, few were taxonomically identified as viral (Supplementary   Table S3 ).\n\nThree contigs homologous to hMPV were identified in one sample. Local nucleotide identity to the virus ranged from 97-99% over a minimum alignment of 528-bp, indicating high similarity to known sequence strains. It is unclear why prior PCR screening failed to detect this virus, however, due to the high sequence homology to existing hMPV genomes it was excluded from further analysis.\n\nA number of contigs were also identified as torque teno virus (TTV), a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus of the Anelloviridae 10 . TTV and the related anelloviruses are characterized by their significant genetic diversity and high prevalence in human populations. Although extensively studied, evidence for clinical association to disease is still lacking 11 . The contigs identified to TTV homologs had a nucleotide identity ranging from 86-95% to genomes searched. Given the generally high diversity of the viral family, it suggested significant similarity to characterized strains.\n\nhaving highest homology within the Circoviridae. The contigs had a local amino acid homology ranging between 59-69% (for local alignments covering at least 100 bp) with highest similarity to genomes recently characterized from reclaimed waste-water 12 . Members of the Circoviridae family represent the smallest replicating viral genomes known to infect eukaryotes. They comprise a group of circular ssDNA viruses known to be severely pathogenic in birds and swine 13, 14 . They were recently identified in human plasma and stool 15 ; however, their widespread biological significance remains poorly understood. Lysholm and colleagues also identified various circovirus-like reads, but attributed their presence to reagent-derived extraction kit contamination 5 . The same commercial extraction kit supplier was used in this study (see Methods), and therefore chose to exclude these samples from further analysis. pertussis, N. Pneumoniae, and C.
