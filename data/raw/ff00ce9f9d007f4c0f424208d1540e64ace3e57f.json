{"title": "DIFFERENTIATED CULTURES OF PRIMARY HAMSTER TRACHEAL AIRWAY EPITHELIAL CELLS", "body": "Primary cell culture systems provide a valuable bridge between animal studies and the use of transformed or immortalized cell lines in studies of tissue development and function. It is clear that animal studies provide the best system for studying organ and tissue function; however, the inability to perform real-time observations; precisely control nutrient, toxin, or growth factor concentrations; and difficuhy in assessing direct versus indirect effects limit the experimental parameters that can be tested in vivo. In contrast, cell lines are grown easily and have defined characteristics (inducible gene expression, cell type-specific markers, etc.) but are usually derived from a single cell type and cannot perform all the functions attributed to the original organ or tissue.\n\nThe airway epithelium consists of a variety of cell types: ciliated ceils that propel mucus up through the respiratory tract, secretory cells that are primarily responsible for secreting factors within the mucus layer, and basal cells that are hypothesized to play a structural role and serve as a pool of progenitor ceils that can repopulate a damaged epithelial cell layer (Wu, 1997) . Studies of function and development of airway epithelial cells are important in understanding the basis of diseases such as cystic fibrosis, cigarette smoke-1 To wholn correspondence should be addressed at Campus Box 8230, 660 South Euclid Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.

Many groups have cultured tracheal epithelial cells (TECs) for evaluating airway growth and development (Wu and Smith, 1982; Lee et al., 1984; Kaartinen et al., 1993; You et al., 2002) as well as pathogenhost interactions (Goldman et al., 1982; Look et al., 2001; Sinn et al., 2002; Waiters et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2002) , and protocols have ranged from tracheal ring organ cuhures (Collier et al., 1977) to enzymatic dissociation followed by various culture conditions (Goldman and Baseman, 1980; Lee et al., 1984; Wu et al., 1985; Yamaya et al., 1992) . The most successful techniques have described culturing at an air-liquid interface (ALI) (Whitcutt et al., 1988; 5~amaya et al., 1992; Robison et al., 1993; You et al., 2002) . Specific hormone media formulations and ALI culture conditions have allowed researchers to create heterogeneous cultures that differentiate into a variety of cell types, including the major cell types found in the airways (Wu, 1997) .\n\nThe use of Syrian golden hamsters as a small animal model for a variety of human pathogens has been of particular interest to us. Microbial pathogens ranging from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavims (Buchholz et al., 2004) , West Nile virus (Mon'ey et al., 2004) , Nipah virus (Wong et al., 2003) , South American hantaviruses (Hooper et al., 2001; Milazzo et al., 2002) , human parainftuenza virus 3 (Tao et al., 1999) , Bordetella pertussis (Collier et al., 1977) You et al., 2002 . Lee et al., 1984 Wu et al., 1985; Yamaya et al., 1992; Kaartinen et al., 1993 : You et al., 2002 ' Karp et al., 2002; You et al., 2002 . (Fisher et al., 2003 , eastern equine encephalitis virus (Paessler et al., 2004) , and leisbmania (Melby et al., 2001) have been shown to infect and cause disease in hamsters. Because several of these pathogens interact with the airway epithelium, we sought to optimize and streamline protocols for the isolation and culture of well-differentiated hamster TECs. Our protocol is based on other TEC protocols, using mouse (You et al., 2002) , guinea pig (Robison et al., 1993) , human (Yamaya et ah, 1992 (Yamaya et ah, , 2002 Karp et al., 2002) , and hamster (Lee et al., 1984; Wu et al., 1985; Moiler et al., 1987; Whitcutt et al., 1988) tissue. We achieved a high efficiency of cell isolation per hamster (5 X 10 s to 6 \u2022 105 cells/trachea), resulting in the seeding of 10-15 wells/animal. The cells are initially devoid of significant numbers of ciliated or secretory cells but rapidly differentiate into a heterogeneous culture containing ciliated, seeretm% mucous, and basal cells. Cell types were quantified by immunostaining, characterized by electron microscopy, and possessed secretory and ciliated cell activities. Thus, hamster TECs can provide a faithful in vitro representation of the in vivo tracheal epithelium for studying a variety of systems. Ham~ter TEC isolation. Six-to eight-week-old female Syrian golden hamsters (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were euthanized by isofluorane inhalation and sodium pentobarbital injection (400 mg/kg injected intraperitoneally). Tracheas were excised from below the larynx to the major bronchi. The explanted tracheas were digested for 12-18 h with 0.3% pronase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in Ham's F-12 with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ~xg/ml streptomycin followed by deoxyfibonuclease treatment (0.5 mg/ml in Ham's F-12, Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for 10 rain at 4 ~ C (You et al., 2002) . Cells were resuspended in TEC Basic (Table 1) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and plated in a 3.5-cm cell culture plate for 3 h at 37 ~ C, 5% CO 2 to remove contaminating fibroblasts (You et al., 2002) . The recovered epithelial cells were plated on thin-layer collagen-coated 0.4-lxm pore 0.33 cm 2 Transwell-Clear (Corning Costal, Corning, NY) supported membranes (You et al., 2002) . Collagen coating was performed by applying 50 pg/ml rat tail collagen type I (diluted in 0.02 N glacial acetic acid) to each membrane, incubating overnight at 4 ~ C, and washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before cell plating. Cells were plated at a density of 1 \u2022 105 cells/era 2, and typical yields were 5 X 10 s to 6 \u2022 10 ~ cells/trachea. Cells were grown in TEC Plus (Table 1) , and apical and basolateral media were changed every 2 d (Lee et al., 1984; Wu et al., 1985; Yamaya et al., 1992; Robison et al., 1993; You et al., 2002) . Transepithelial resistance (TER) was measured with the Millipore Millicell-ERS (Millipore, Bedford, MA). On reaching a TER of >1000 t)-cm 2, the apical media was removed to create an ALI (Whitcutt et al., 1988; Yamaya et al., 1992; Robison et al., 1993) , and the basolateral media was then replaced with TEC MM (Table 1 ) (Yamaya et al., 1992; Karp et al., 2002; You et al., 2002) . The cells were routinely infected between days 10 and 14 ALl.\n\nImmunofluorescenee confocal microscopy. At the indicated d relative to ALI, hamster TECs were washed with PBS (GIBCO Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at romn temperature. After fxation, the cells were washed with PBS and penneablized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with PBS containing 3% normal goat serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer) for 30 rain at room temperature, with the primary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed, and incubated with secondary, antibodies for 1 h. Nuclei were then stained with ToPro3 for 15 min at room temperature. All washes were performed with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. The membranes were mounted with Molecular Probes Prolong antifade (Molecular Probes), and the cells were observed using a Zeiss LSM confocal microscope.\n\nMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) cells were infected at the indicated multiplicity of infection with a recombinant influenza A virus, strain A/Udorn/72 (rUdorn courtesy of Robert Lamb, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) (Takeda et al., 2002) . Mucus was renmved by washing twice with warm TEC Basic. Cells were infected through the apical chamber in a total volume of 50 tzl for 1 h at 37 ~ C in the presence or absence of 10 ~g/ml N-acetyl trypsin (Sigma). The inoculum was removed and washed twice with Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM), 10% FBS, to remove and inactivate trypsin, and once with PBS. The apical inoculum was replaced with 50 Ixl DMEM, (GIBCO), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 bLg/ml streptomycin (GIBCO) either with or without 10 Ixg/ml N-acetyl trypsin. The basolateral media was changed at the time of infection to TEC MM. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were infected in the presence or absence of 10 btg/ml of N-acetyl trypsin according to standm'd procedures (Paterson and Lamb, 1993; McCown et al., 2003) . The apical supernatant was collected for plaque assay at the indicated h postinfection (hpi). Plaque assays for hamster TEC infections were performed on MDCK cells as described previously (Paterson and Lamb, 1993; McCown et al., 2003) . loading buffer (Paterson and Lamb, 1993) , run through a 22-gauge needle, sonicated for 15 rain at 42 kHz, and boiled for 15 rain. For blotting of CCSE 13-mercaptoethanol was added to lysates at a final concentration of 144 mM before boiling. Lysates were run on a 15% polyacrylanfide mini gel (BioRad, Hercules, CA) for 3 h at 75 V, and for detection of CCSR proteins were separated on a 17.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 4 M urea. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore hnmobilon-P) at 100 V for 1 h (Mini Transblot, BioRad) and blocked in PBS with 5% dry nfilk. Blots were incubated in primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS supplemented with 1% Tween 20, and developed using the Amersham (Piscataway, NJ) ECL-Plus substrate.\n\nWound repair and matrilysia expression. Air-liquid interface hamster TECs (19 d) were injured by scraping the cell layer with a 200-1xl pipette tip, taking care not to damage the support filter. Loose cells were removed by washing three times with warm PBS containing Mg ++ and Ca ++, and the cells were left at the ALI. Transepithelial resistance was measured at the indicated times after injury by adding 150 ~1 of warm TEC Basic to the apical chamber and incubating for 5 nfin at 37 ~ C in a 5% CO2. Three measurements were taken for each of three random mock and injured samples.\n\nClara cell secretory protein secretion assay. Clara cell secretory protein secretion was monitored at the indicated d before and after ALI by applying 50 txl of TEC Basic to the apical chamber and pipetting 10 times to dislodge the mucus from the cell surface. Clara cell secretory protein secretion was measm~d from the same well for the duration of the experiment. Samples were brought to 1% SDS by addition of 1/10 volume 10% SDS solution. Cell lysates wel~ taken by lysing the cells on the membrane in 100 ~1 of 1% SDS.\n\nScanning electron microscopy. Hamster TECs at various d ALl or hamster tracheal tissue was fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS or 0.1 M cacodylate buffer followed by postfixation with 1% aqueous osmium tetroxide. Tracheal tissues were further processed using the osmium-thiocarbohydrazide-osmiunl method (Kelly et al., 1973) . The samples were dehydrated in a Transmission electron microscopy. Hamster TECs were fixed at 21 d ALI with 2% paraformaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) in a 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in phosphate buffer, the ceils were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Polysciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were then rinsed extensively in dHzO before en bloc staining with 1% aqueous nranyl acetate (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. After several rinses in dH20, cells were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Eponate 12 resin (Ted Pella). Sections of 70-80 nm were cut, stained with 2.5% uranyl acetate and 0.66% lead citrate, and viewed on a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, MA).\n\nHamster TEC polarization and tight junction formation. Isolated epithelial cells were plated into Transwell chambers at a density of 1 x l0 s cells/cm 2, and the formation of tight junctions was monitored by measuring the TER across the cell layer at the indicated d before and after ALI (Fig. 1A) . The TER increased postplating and remained > 5 0 0 l~-cm 2, decreased slightly after ALI, but quickly regained a TER of > 1 5 0 0 t)-cm 2 through 14 d ALI (Fig. 1A) . Tight junction formation was also evaluated by monitoring the subcellular localization of ZO-1, a protein that specifically localizes to the apical tight junctions of polarized ceils (Denker and Nigam, 1998) . Zonular occludin 1 staining showed some cell junction localization in addition to a diffuse localization pattern at -6 d ALI (Fig. 1B) ; however, a typical tight junction pattern predominated by -3 d ALI (Fig. 1C) . This staining pattern remained constant ( Fig.  1D and E) and illustrated the increase in cell numbers that occurred after ALL Hamster TEC morphology and uhrastructure. At 0 and 3 d ALI the apical cell surface remained flat, with few ciliated cells ( Fig.  2A and B) . However, under high-power magnification, the tight junctions and microvilli could be observed ( Fig. 2A) . Figure 2A dem-onstrates the presence of a ciliated cell, which are found at a low frequency (<5%) postplating. After ALI, total cell numbers increased, and it was evident that ciliated cell differentiation was occurring ( Fig. 2C-E) . By 14 d ALI (Fig. 2E) , the cellular morphology resembled that of the adult hamster trachea (Fig. 2F) . Transmission electron microscopy revealed both ciliated and nonciliated cell populations (Fig. 3A-D) that had well-formed tight junctions (Fig. 3E) . Many nonciliated cells contained large apically localized vesicles, characteristic of secretory cells (Fig. 3B) . Cells that morphologically resembled basal cells were detected below the apical cell layer (Fig. 3C) . These data indicate that the hamster TEC culture forms polarized cultures consisting of ciliated, nonciliated, and basal cells, with morphology closely resembling the hamster trachea.\n\nCiliated and secretory cell differentiation. Confocal microscopy with cell type-specific antibodies was used to objectively quantitate the cell populations within the hamster TEC culture during differentiation. The ciliated cell population increased with increasing d ALI (Fig. 4A-D) , as suggested by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, and by 15 d ALI constituted 40% of the total cell population (Fig. 5A) .\n\nTwo cell markers were used to evaluate the secretory cell populations: CCSP that is secreted by Clara cells (Singh and Katyal, 1997; Hermans and Bernard, 1999) and the mucin MUC5AC that is secreted by goblet cells (Hermans and Bernard, 1999; Kim et al., 2004) . Three distinct secretory cell populations were identified during differentiation ( Fig. 4E-P) : CCSP single-positive, MUC5AC single-positive, and CCSP/MUC5AC double-positive populations. Only 15% of the total cell population expressed either secretory cell marker before ALI. Of the marker-positive cells, MUC5AC single-positive cells predominated before ALI but decreased after ALI (Fig. 5B) . The CCSP/MUC5AC double-positive cells increased immediately after ALl but decreased by 15 d ALI to less than 5%. The CCSP single-positive population steadily increased to become the predominant secretory cell type at roughly 30% of the total cell population by 15 d ALI (Fig. 5B) . The basal cells were not identified by immunostaining due to the lack of an appropriate cell differentiation marker. The above data confirms the presence of ciliated, Clara, and goblet cells, as well as the differentiation of these cell types after ALI.\n\nThe secretory activity associated with these cultures was evaluated using a CCSP secretion assay. Apical washes at d relative to ALI were collected, and CCSP expression was monitored by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5C ). The secretion measured in this assay was not cumulative because time points were isolated from a single representative sample well. Clara cell secretory protein secretion into the apical supernatant increased with increasing d ALI. This expression was specific to hamster TECs because CCSP expression was not evident in the polarized canine epithelial cell line MDCK but was present to a small degree in hamster TEC lysates (Fig. 5C ).\n\ncation of influenza A virus requires addition of trypsin to the culture media of virtually all cell lines. Trypsin cleaves the influenza A virus HA precursor protein into disulfide-linked subunits and is required to convert the protein into a fusion competent form (Paterson and Lamb, 1993; Steinhauer, 1999) . Figure 6A demonstrates that exogenous trypsin is not required for infuenza A virus replication in hamster TECs, whereas Fig. 6C demonstrates that HA cleavage occurs in the absence of exogenous trypsin. Because the\n\nhamster TECs at 10 d ALI were infected with influenza A virus rUdorn at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.01 (3000 pfu) in the presence or absence of trypsin, and infectious virus in apical supernatants was measured at 24 and 48 h postinfection (hpi). Hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage was monitored by Western blotting of (B) MDCK ceils at 12 hpi (MOI = 0.1) or (C) hamster TECs at 24 and 48 hpi (MOI -0.01). HA0 is the unprocessed tolm of HA, whereas HA, and HA2 are the subunits produced after cleavage. Viral antigen spread in hamster TEC cultures infected at an MOI = 0.01 was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, using a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the influenza A virus M2 protein at 24 hpi in cells that were (D) mock infected, (E) infected and cultured with trypsin, and (F) infected and cultured without trypsin.\n\ninfluenza A virus life cycle takes approximately 12 h to complete, ceils expressing viral antigen at 24 and 48 hpi most likely represent cells that were not infected with initial virus inoculum but with infectious virus produced from the initially infected cells. This is in contrast to infection of most transformed cell lines, MDCK ceils serving as an example in Fig. 6A and B. A 12-h time point was taken because HA is not detectable at later time points because the infection of MDCK cells in the absence of trypsin is abortive. Finally, infected hamster TECs produced comparable numbers of viral antigen-positive cells in the presence or absence of exogenous trypsin at 24 hpi ( Fig. 6D-F ). Using various cell markers, we determined that viral antigen was present in ciliated and secretory cells (data not shown). These data indicate that unlike most transformed cell lines, hamster TECs produce a trypsin-like enzyme capable of cleaving the influenza A virus HA protein.\n\nWound repair. It has been reported that airway epithelial cells express the matrix metalloproteinase, matrilysin, which functions in wound repair (Parks et al., 2001; Li et al., 2002; McGuire et al., 2oo3; Wieloek et al., 2004}, To determine if hamster TECs were capable of wound repair, the TER as well as matrilysin expression was monitored after injury. At 1 and 12 h postinjury, the cells had a low TER, which was restored to >500 l)-cm 2 by 24 h postinjury, after which a high resistance was maintained (Fig. 7A) . At 12 and 24 h postinjury, the cells were monitored for matrilysin expression using immunofluorescence confoeal microscopy ( Fig. 7B and D) . At 12 h postinjury, matrilysin expression was detected in cells surrounding the injury (Fig. 7B) . By 24 h postinjury, matrilysin expression was still present within the scarred region, but the wound had closed, and this correlated with a high TER (Fig. 7D) . Nuclei staining was used to monitor the migration of ceils into the wound ( Fig. 7C and E) . These data suggest that hamster TECs are capable of wound repair.\n\nIn this study, we defined a primary hamster TEC culture system that produces a well-differentiated cellular population that is grown at an ALI, similar to the environment encountered in vivo. Hamster tracheal cultures have been reported (Goldman and Baseman, 1980; Lee et al., 1984; Niles et al., 1988; Whitcutt et al., 1988; Wu, 1997) , and in this study we modified, updated, and streamlined the methodology. The use of protease dissociation for cell isolation resulted in a high yield of epithelial cells (roughly 5 \u2022 105 to 6 \u2022 1@ cells/trachea), and use of hormone-and serum-supplemented medias led to rapid proliferation and differentiation of the cells at ALL We chose to limit our cell-type analysis to cells that could be identified with antibodies to well-characterized cell markers in order to objectively characterize the cellular makeup of the cuhures and used electron microscopy primarily to assess the uhrastructure of the cultures. We found that our cultures produced a heterogeneous cell population, similar to the trachea in vivo, including ciliated and nonciliated cells. The nonciliated cells were identified as basal (electron microscopy), goblet (MUC5AC-positive), and Clara (CCSP-positive) cells and were capable of producing and secreting mucus and mucus-associated proteins. Interestingly, a high percentage of ceils expressed both MUC5AC and CCSP immediately after ALI. Whether Clara cell differentiation is completely independent of MUC5AC expression, proceeds through a MUC5AC/ CCSP positive intemmdiate cell, or goblet cells themselves can differentiate into Clara cells through the double-positive intermediate remains to be investigated. It is interesting to note the mounting evidence indicating that Clara cells can differentiate into MUC5ACpositive goblet cells, perhaps through a MUC5AC/CCSP doublepositive population, in response to interleukin-13 or antigen challenge in murine models of airway hypelwesponsiveness (Reader et al., 2003; Shahzeidi et al., 2003) . The presence of both cell populations in hamster TEC cultures allows for the study of the interdependence of these two cell populations (Boers et al., 1999; Hayashi et al., 2004) .\n\nAt ALI, there are few differentiated cells, but as d ALI increase, the percentage of differentiated cells increased (Figs. 4 and 5) . Although we have not extensively characterized differentiation in the absence of ALI, it is clear from the literature that ALI is an important stimuli for differentiation of mouse (You et al., 2002) , human (Yamaya et al., 2002) , guinea pig (Robisou et al., 1993) , rat (Kaartinen et al., 1993) , and hamster (Whitcutt et al., 1988) TECs. This differentiation after ALI is consistent with the isolation of a pro-genitor population as seen in other tracheal isolation protocols (Goldman and Baseman, 1980; You et al., 2002) . In vivo, the secretory cells that populate the airways consist of Clara and goblet cells (Wu, 1997) . These cell types were present in our cultures and in roughly similar quantities to that observed in hamster tracheas (data not shown). Secretory cells predominated early, as compared with ciliated cells, consistent with reports that suggest that secretory cells may serve as a progenitor population (Wu, 1997) . The MUC5AC-positive population was found to be a small percentage, whereas the CCSP-positive population predominated as the major secretory cell in the mature hamster TEC culture (Figs. 4 and 5) as well as in vivo (data not shown). Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated the cells morphologically consistent with basal cells (Fig. 3C) , suggesting that this cell type may constitute the remaining 20-30% of the cells in this culture.\n\nHamster TECs are primary ceils and therefore were found to possess many fhnctions that are not found in immortalized cell lines. The hamster TEC cultures produced an enzyme capable of cleaving HA and thereby propagated influenza virus infection. The enzymatic activity may be associated with a trypsin-like protein, tryptase Clara, that was isolated from the airways of rats and localizes to the secretory cells of rat airways (Kido et al., 1992) . This emphasizes the uniqueness of primary trachea epithelial cell cultures, which can simulate the in vivo environment when evaluating virus-host cell interactions.\n\nRepair of the respiratory epithelium is vital for maintaining the integrity of the epithelium after damage. Many cellular factors have been implicated in proliferation and migration of cells during wound repair (Kalinichenko et al., 2001 (Kalinichenko et al., , 2003 Parks et ah, 2001; McGuire et al., 2003) . After injury, hamster TECs quickly regained a high TER, suggestive of establishing cellular tight junction integrity and wound repair (Fig. 7A) . Under light microscopy, the wound was no longer visible at 24 h postinjury (data not shown). Matrilysin expression is upregulated in response to injury in healthy cells that surround an injury (McGuire et al., 2003) , and indeed it appeared to be induced on injury of the hamster TECs. Interestingly, there was a low level of matrilysin expression in mock cells as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis (data not shown). This is consistent with reports that in vivo, matrilysin is constitutively expressed in the airways (Dunsmore et al., 1998) and supports the role of matrilysin in other responses, such as immune modulation and airway homeostasis (Parks et al., 2004) .\n\nThe hamster TEC culture does mimic the in vivo tracheal environment and will be a useful system to evaluate tracheal function. Recently, Syrian golden hamsters have been described as suitable small animal models for many emerging infectious diseases, including SARS coronavirus (Buchholz et al., 2004) , Nipah virus (Wong et al., 2003) , and the South American hantaviruses, Andes and Maporal viruses (Hooper et al., 2001; Milazzo et al., 2002) . These viruses are transmitted through inhalation, result in high morbidity and mortality in human infections, and require high containment facilities (biosafety levels 3 or 4) in which to conduct research (Lopez et al., 1996; Chua et al., 2000; Ksiazek et al., 2003) . The respiratory tract is likely to play an important role in the disease progression of these pathogens, whether as a site of virus replication or simply as a brawler preventing virus access to other organs in the animal. Therefore, the use of in vitro systems, such as the hamster TEC culture, could provide a preferred environment to study virushost interactions, as well as testing of antiviral molecules."}
