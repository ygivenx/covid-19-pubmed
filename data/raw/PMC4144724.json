{"title": "A Versatile PDMS/Paper Hybrid Microfluidic Platform\nfor Sensitive Infectious Disease Diagnosis", "body": "LAMP detection and DNA preparation:\nThe LAMP primers (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) for\nthe target ctrA gene sequence12 from Neisseria meningitidis are shown in Supporting Information Table S-1. Loopamp DNA amplification\nkit and Loopamp fluorescence detection reagent (calcein) were purchased\nfrom Eiken Co. Ltd., Japan. DNA isolation kit containing a lysis buffer\nATL and a ready-to-use proteinase K solution and LAMP product purification\nkit were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA).\n\nMicrofluidic\nplatform fabrication: Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184) was\nobtained from Dow Corning (Midland, MI); Whatman#1 chromatography\npaper and Epoxy glue were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and\nITW Devcon (Danvers, MA), respectively.\n\nAll other chemicals\nwere purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and\nused without further purification, unless stated otherwise. Unless\notherwise noted, all solutions were prepared with ultrapure Milli-Q\nwater (18.2 M\u03a9 cm) from a Millipore Milli-Q system (Bedford,\nMA).\n\nAs shown\nin Figure 1, the microfluidic device comprises\nthree layers, two PDMS layers on the top of a glass slide. The top\nlayer is the PDMS layer used for reagent delivery, including three\nmicrochannels (width 100 \u03bcm, depth 100 \u03bcm) on the bottom\nside of the PDMS layer, and one inlet reservoir (diameter 1.0 mm,\ndepth 1.5 mm). The middle PDMS layer consists of 6 wells as LAMP zones\n(diameter 2.0 mm), 3 outlet reservoirs (diameter 1.0 mm), and microchannels\n(width 100 \u03bcm, depth 100 \u03bcm) at the bottom side of the\nmiddle PDMS layer to connect to outlet reservoirs. The bottom layer\nis a glass slide mainly for structure support. Different LAMP zones\nwere used for negative control (NC), positive control (PC), and N. meningitidis detection, respectively. Both omission\nof LAMP primers and omission of DNA template for negative control\nwere tested and showed the same results. Thus, omission of LAMP primers\nwas adopted as the main negative control herein. PC template DNA and\nits primer mix (PM) were provided by the Loopamp DNA amplification\nkit.\n\nA chromatography paper disk (diameter 2.0 mm) cut by a\nlaser cutter (Epilog Zing 16, Golden, CO) was placed inside each LAMP\nzone, as a 3D storage substrate for LAMP primers.\n\nAfter the\nLAMP mix was prepared\nin a biosafety cabinet, the LAMP reaction mix was introduced to the\nbiochip from the inlet reservoir to fill different LAMP zones. After\nthe inlet and outlets reservoirs were sealed with Epoxy, the microfluidic\ndevice was placed on a heating film at 63 \u00b0C for 45 min for LAMP\nreactions, followed by the termination of LAMP reactions at 80 \u00b0C\nfor 2 min. The heating film was controlled by an inexpensive proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative\n(PID)-based temperature controller devised by our laboratory.\n\nAfter LAMP reactions, a portable UV pen light was applied to shine\nLAMP products. The generated fluorescence was captured by a cellular\nphone camera (e.g., iPhone 5), and the images were processed with\nthe NIH software ImageJ. Results were further confirmed by a high-sensitivity\nNikon Ti-E fluorescence microscope (Melville, NY) that was equipped\nwith a motorized stage and a cooled CCD camera to measure the fluorescence\nintensities, using appropriate FITC optical filters (Ex = 495 nm;\nEm = 520 nm) for calcein and Cy3 optical filters (Ex = 550 nm; Em\n= 570 nm) for Cy3-labeled primers.\n\nArtificial cerebrospinal\nfluid (ACSF) was prepared according to\npreviously published protocol.43 Centrifuge-free\nassay procedures for microorganisms in ACSF were as follows: First,\na couple of bacterial colonies were picked from a pure culture using\na sterile loop and solubilized in a 20 \u03bcL ACSF buffer to prepare\nthe pathogen/ACSF mixture. Next, 2 \u03bcL of this mixture was added\ninto 18 \u03bcL of bacterial lysis buffer that contained 50 mM Tris\nbuffer (pH 7.5), 4 M urea, and 0.1% triton, and incubated at room\ntemperature for 10 min. At last, 2 \u03bcL of the pathogen/pathogen\nmixture lysate was used in the LAMP reaction mixture for on-chip LAMP\nreaction, as performed in the aforementioned on-chip LAMP procedures.\n\nBecause different\nchip substrates have their own advantages and limitations, we previously\ndeveloped a PDMS/paper hybrid microfluidic system for one-step pathogen\ndetection, in which paper facilitated the integration of graphene\noxide-based nanosensors on the chip.37 Although\nthis method can directly measure microorganisms without complicated\nsample preparation due to the use of aptamers, the sensitivity is\ngenerally not as high as DNA-amplification-based methods. In this\nwork, chromatography paper is placed in LAMP zones to form another\nPDMS/paper hybrid microfluidic device (Figure 1), in which paper serves as the 3D substrate for preloading DNA primers\nfor subsequent LAMP reactions to improve detection sensitivity. Paper\nis a highly porous material, which renders it as an ideal 3D storage\nsubstrate for interaction-based assays.44 Paper\u2019s 3D microstructures can also facilitate uniform reagent\ndistribution. It can be seen from Figure 2a\nthat when fluorescently labeled primers were initially loaded into\nLAMP zones, primers were uniformly distributed in LAMP zones either\nwith paper or without paper inside. However, when devices were placed\nin a vacuum desiccator to dry, a necessary step to make a ready-to-use\nPOC device in this work, primers in paper-free LAMP zones accumulated\non the edge of the LAMP zones, while primers in LAMP zones with paper\ninside were still uniformly distributed (Figure 2b).\n\nIn addition, we also investigated and compared\nthe on-chip LAMP\nperformance of the devices with paper inside and without paper inside\nover a period of 2 months at room temperature, as shown in Figure 2c. We precoated LAMP primers of N.\nmeningitidis in LAMP zones with paper inside or without\npaper inside. The two kinds of ready-to-use microfluidic chips were\nstored at the same conditions in dark. LAMP reactions were performed\nwithin 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, respectively. LAMP products were quantified\nby using Nanodrop after each LAMP reaction to evaluate the on-chip\nLAMP performance. As shown in Figure 2c, the\nnucleic acid concentration of LAMP product from LAMP zones without\npaper inside kept decreasing through the whole experimental period.\nA sharp decrease within the first 2 weeks was observed. At week 8,\nthe on-chip LAMP performance decreased by \u223c40%, which implied\nthat the devices without paper inside were not able to provide consistent\nresults over a period of time. Such devices without paper inside needed\nto be used right away. On the contrary, the on-chip LAMP performance\nfrom the device with paper inside remained stable within 2 months.\nOnly a slight decrease (less than 6%) over time was observed. Therefore,\nwe concluded that the introduction of paper in this hybrid microfluidic\nbiochip as a primer storage substrate also enabled stable on-chip\nLAMP performance and longer shelf life than those without paper inside.\nThis is mainly because (1) highly interwoven paper fibers can provide\nDNA primers a 3D protection matrix from harsh environmental elements,\nand thus are commonly used to collect samples for forensic DNA analysis.45,46 (2) DNA primers can be physically adsorbed onto paper fibers, avoiding\nDNA loss in the air in the form of aerosols.\n\nTo offer high-sensitivity detection,\nDNA amplification is usually required. Although PCR is the most commonly\nused DNA amplification method, it requires a carefully controlled\nsequence of heating and cooling cyclers. The fabrication of heaters\nand temperature sensors on a chip is complicated.47 In contrast, the LAMP method that utilizes the Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase, a thermally\nstable enzyme with high strand displacement ability over the template\u2013primer\ncomplex,48,49 is a simple, rapid, specific, and cost-effective\nnucleic acid amplification method when compared to PCR.50 This isothermal LAMP DNA amplification technique\nallows nucleic acid amplification to be carried out under thermally\nconstant conditions, eliminating the use of expensive instrumentation\n(e.g., thermal cyclers) for stringent thermal cycling as in conventional\nPCR, or complicated and costly microfabrication of heating elements\non a chip for on-chip PCR.47\n\nThe\nfeasibility of the PDMS/paper hybrid microfluidic platform for N. meningitidis detection was first tested by using\npurified DNA of N. meningitidis. The N. meningitidis DNA template was isolated and purified\nfrom bacterial culture.\n\nA 26 \u03bcL LAMP reaction mix was\nintroduced through the inlet\nreservoir into different sample test, positive control (PC), and negative\ncontrol (NC) LAMP zones, where the specific LAMP primers for the target N. meningitidis and PC DNA were preloaded, respectively.\nA notable feature of the device design is that the LAMP reaction wells\nin the middle PDMS layer were independent without connections in the\nsame layer, which can effectively prevent cross-talk among the sample\ntest, PC, and NC LAMP zones during the LAMP reactions.\n\nDuring\nthe LAMP amplification process, it was observed that a magnesium\npyrophosphate precipitate was formed as a turbid byproduct of the\nnucleic acid amplification process.51 This\nprecipitate forms only when the targeted DNA is present in the LAMP\namplification process, such that the presence of the pyrophosphate\ncan serve as an indicator of the presence of a pathogen\u2019s target\nDNA by turbidity detection. Turbidity however is challenging for high-sensitivity\nvisual detection. Thus, turbidity detection usually requires a turbidimeter.42 Actually, visual confirmation by the naked eye\ncan be achieved by the addition of a mixture of calcein in the presence\nof manganese ions. The fluorescence of calcein is quenched by manganese\nions before LAMP amplification. When the amplification reaction proceeds,\nthe manganese\u2013calcein complex is deprived of manganese ions\nby generated pyrophosphate, which results in the emission of fluorescence\nunder UV light (Figure 1c).50 As such, clinical diagnosis of the pathogen N. meningitidis can be achieved by visual confirmation\nof the green color with a portable UV light pen, as shown in Figure 3. The fluorescence generated was captured by a cellular\nphone camera, as used in Figure 3a. It was\nobserved that the N. meningitidis sample\nand PC showed bright green fluorescence under a portable UV light\npen, while NC only showed weak background. To quantify the difference\nof the fluorescence between N. meningitidis and NC, the gray value, an indication of the brightness of a pixel,\nof fluorescence images was processed by the software ImageJ, as shown\nin Figure 3c. The cutoff value was determined\nas 3-fold standard deviations of the mean gray value of the negative\ncontrols on the basis of the negative control. Figure 3c clearly shows the difference between NC and PC and N. meningitidis.\n\nThe results were further confirmed\nby high-sensitivity fluorescence\nmicroscopy (see Figure 3b and d). Similar to\nthat observed in Figure 3a, strong fluorescence\nwas observed in N. meningitidis and\nPC LAMP zones, but not in NC zones. The fluorescence intensity of\nthe N. meningitidis LAMP products was\nabout 6 times higher than that of the NC.\n\nBesides, the multiple-layer biochip is designed in a way\nto render\nversatile functions for the N. meningitidis diagnosis. In addition to on-chip LAMP detection, different LAMP\nproducts can be collected separately for further confirmatory tests\nusing conventional gel electrophoresis and quantitative analysis,\nas demonstrated in Supporting Information Figures S-1 and 6 in laboratory settings, respectively. When the\nNC LAMP mix and the N. meningitidis LAMP mix in two PCR tubes were placed under UV light before LAMP\nreactions, neither tube showed notable fluorescence (Supporting Information Figure S-1a). However, after on-chip\nLAMP reaction, similar to on-chip visual detection as shown in Figure 3a, the collected N. meningitidis LAMP products in a PCR tube showed bright green fluorescence under\nportable UV light (Supporting Information Figure S-1b). Conversely, the NC mixture had no difference after\nLAMP reaction. The obvious difference between N. meningitidis tests and NC could be seen even by the naked eye. Subsequently,\nthe results were further confirmed by conventional gel electrophoresis\nof extracted LAMP products, as shown in Supporting\nInformation Figure S-1c, the comparison of LAMP products in\nlane 2 with the DNA sizing ladder in lane 1 verified the success of\nthe on-chip LAMP. As expected, no DNA bands were observed in NC in\nlane 3.\n\nAs reported previously, LAMP is a\nreliable method for pathogen diagnosis with high specificity.52,53 We tested the specificity of our method among N.\nmeningitidis, Giardia lamblia (Giardia), and Bordetella\npertussis (B. pertussis) (data not shown), and among three common types of meningitis-causing\nbacteria, N. meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (See Figure 4). Both tests showed high specificity of our approach. For instance,\nsignals from LAMP zones with H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) DNA templates were observed to be\nsimilar to NC in Figure 4, in contrast to bright\nfluorescence from N. meningitidis,\nwhich confirmed the high specificity of our approach in the detection\nof N. meningitidis.\n\nThe detection discussed above\nwas carried out by using a purified\nDNA template. There have also been reports on rapid PCR detection\nfor clinic samples of pathogenic bacteria by using special lysis reagents\nwithout the inhibition of PCR.47,54\u221257 Yet for LAMP DNA amplification, traditional sample preparation procedures\nsuch as DNA isolation and purification are needed.12,13 These procedures are time-consuming, and require the use of centrifuges\nthat however usually do not exist in the field, making them not suitable\nfor POC detection in resource-poor settings.\n\nIn this work, we\nhave developed a simple microfluidic approach for pathogenic microorganism\ndetection (not just pathogen DNA). This approach combines a simple\nbacteria lysis procedure with on-chip LAMP detection, without using\nany centrifuge and prepurified DNA templates. Because the examination\nof cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) is a cornerstone of current meningitis\ndiagnosis, we spiked N. meningitidis bacteria in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) to mimic the real\nclinic samples for on-chip LAMP detection.\n\nThe first step is to discover a simple method to lysis N. meningitidis microorganisms in a resource-limited\nsetting. More importantly, the method should be fully compatible to\nthe subsequent LAMP reactions (i.e., without inhibition to LAMP reactions).\nWe tried various lysis buffers including some common commercial buffers\nused for PCR (e.g., Buffet ATL from Qiagen, MagNA Pure Bacteria Lysis\nBuffer from Roche Applied Science), but found only this lysis buffer\n(50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 4 M urea, and 0.1% triton) is compatible\nto LAMP reactions, while others completely inhibited LAMP reaction\n(see gel electrophoresis results in Figure S-2 of the Supporting Information). This lysis buffer can\nbe adapted for other microorganism detection using LAMP without problems\nof inhibition.\n\nUpon the success of microorganism lysis without\nthe use of any\ncentrifuges, the lysate without any further preparation was used directly\nfor the on-chip LAMP detection of N. meningitidis microorganisms in ACSF. The results in Figure 5 showed that the LAMP products of the spiked ACSF sample could still\nproduce strong fluorescence as purified DNA samples under portable\nUV light and fluorescence microscope. Figure 5c and d showed good discrimination among a spiked N. meningitidis sample, PC, and NC. Gel electrophoresis\nof on-chip LAMP products from pathogen/ACSF sample further confirmed\nthe success of the LAMP reaction (Figure 5e),\nand the successful detection of N. meningitidis.\n\nThe instrument-free pathogen detection was very simple and\nfully\ncompatible with LAMP reactions, without using any equipment. The success\nof this instrument-free LAMP detection using the microfluidic device\nis significant because it indicates that real samples could be directly\nused for the on-chip LAMP reaction without any laborious and time-consuming\nDNA isolation or purification procedures.\n\nThe visual LAMP fluorescence detection\nis a simple method for rapid pathogen detection, from which a yes\nor no qualitative answer for POC detection can be achieved quickly\nbased on the fluorescence of the LAMP products. During our experiments,\nit was found that the fluorescence intensity was not directly proportional\nto pathogen concentrations, indicating the fluorescence intensity\nof calcein is not suitable for quantitative analysis. Although the\nqualitative analysis was sufficient for most diseases diagnosis, we\ndeveloped an indirect method for quantitative analysis of N. meningitidis, based on the versatile functions\nof the microfluidic chip. Before on-chip LAMP reactions, the DNA concentrations\nof a series of 10-fold diluted pathogen/ACSF lysate solutions ranging\nfrom 6 \u00d7 106 to 6 were quantified to obtain initial\nDNA copy numbers per LAMP zone by Nanodrop. After LAMP amplifications\nin the microfluidic platform, because microwells for samples PC and\nNC were separated from each other in the middle PDMS layer, LAMP products\ncould be simply collected, purified, and quantified. Thus, the calibration\nwas generated by plotting the DNA LAMP product concentration against\ninitial DNA copy numbers, as shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that the product DNA concentration is directly proportional\nto the log of the initial template DNA numbers, with an R2 of 0.98. Therefore, by measuring the nucleic acid concentration\nof the LAMP products from unknown N. meningitidis samples, we can calculate the amount of the bacteria in unknown\nsamples, and thus estimate the seriousness of infection.\n\nBy using a series of 10-fold\ndiluted N. meningitidis DNA template\nsolutions whose DNA copy numbers were determined by Nanodrop, the\nlimit of detection was studied. The top left LAMP zones of the device\nwere used for NC. All other LAMP zones were used for N. meningitidis DNA detection. The initial DNA copy\nnumbers of the template (before LAMP) ranged from 3 \u00d7 106, 3 \u00d7 105, 3 \u00d7 104, ... to\n3 \u00d7 10\u20132 per LAMP zone. After LAMP reactions,\nit was observed from Figure 7a that even the\ninitial DNA templates were as low as 3 copies per LAMP zone; the on-chip\nLAMP products still exhibited strong fluorescence. However, when the\ninitial DNA templates were less than one copy, the fluorescence of\nthe LAMP zones was as dim as the NC. On the basis of 3-fold standard\ndeviations of the mean gray value of the negative controls on the\nbasis of the negative control, we calculated the gray value of the\ncutoff line for N. meningitidis as\n21.5, as shown with the dashed line in Figure 7b. The gray value of the LAMP product from 3 copies of initial DNA\ntemplate was much higher than that of the cutoff line. This was further\nconfirmed by off-chip gel electrophoresis of all LAMP products, as\nshown in Figure 7c. Therefore, the LOD of the\nmicrofluidic approach was estimated to be \u223c3 DNA copies (or\n7.4 fg), which is close to single-bacterium detection sensitivity.\nThis LOD was even 3-fold as low as that of the conventional real-time\nPCR method for N. meningitidis detection\n(9 copies/reaction).58\n\nWe have developed a versatile PDMS/paper\nhybrid microfluidic platform\nfor rapid and sensitive detection of N. meningitidis. Because of the integrated LAMP DNA amplification on the chip, the\nlimit of detection of \u223c3 DNA copies of N. meningitidis has been achieved within 45 min, overcoming lengthy assay time and\nlow-sensitivity issues in conventional methods for the diagnosis of\nmeningitis. This hybrid microfluidic platform incorporates the advantages\nof high performance in liquid control from PDMS and of high porosity\nfrom paper for preloading LAMP primers.\n\nThe function of this\nhybrid microfluidic system is versatile. (1)\nIts on-chip LAMP detection based on calcein under portable UV light\ndoes not require any bulky specialized equipment without the use of\nany centrifuges and cumbersome procedures for DNA isolation and purification.\nThe instrument-free detection makes the microfluidic system highly\ncapable for the diagnosis of meningitis in the field or in other resource-limited\nsettings. (2) The design of the microfluidic biochip allows on-chip\nLAMP products to be readily extracted for more confirmatory tests\n(e.g., gel electrophoresis) and quantitative analysis based on the\ncalibration curve, as demonstrated in this work. This feature is suitable\nto the in-depth analysis and study of patient samples in clinical\nlaboratory settings. Combining features (1) and (2) can provide a\ncomprehensive examination of patient samples in different settings.\nFor instance, after an initial qualitative assay of a patient sample\nin the field or resource-limited settings, the sample tested by the\nbiochip can be sent back to a clinical laboratory for further confirmatory\ntests or quantitative analysis to examine the disease seriousness\nof infection. Moreover, by designing and changing different primers\nspecific to other infectious diseases, this microfluidic platform\ncan have great potential in quick and early diagnosis of a broad range\nof other infectious diseases, such as whooping cough, malaria, H1N1,\nand severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), especially for developing\nnations. By scaling up channels and LAMP zones, our method can be\nused for high-throughput screening of different infectious diseases."}
