{"title": "Get the News Out Loudly and Quickly: The Influence of the Media on Limiting Emerging Infectious Disease Outbreaks", "body": "We implement the social distancing as a fourth compartment () in the  transmission model. Social distancing moves an individual from the susceptible class directly to the social distancing class and they play no role in the disease transmission. However, it is clearly unrealistic for an individual to remain completely isolated for weeks or months: individuals must venture out into the public to buy food and some will require medial care. Our long-lived models explicitly allow individuals to return from the social distancing class to the susceptible class. Our simulations show for a short-lived outbreak, that allowing individuals to return from isolation (stop applying social distancing measures) has little effect on the attack rate and maximal daily prevalence when individuals are allowed to leave for up to 4 hours each day. Therefore we focus on a short-lived outbreak with strict social distance (no return from social distancing) where we can do analytics. This seems to be the first study to address the question of partial social distancing.\n\nThere are other models incorporating the influence of human behavior on epidemics of infectious diseases. A review is provided by Funk, et. al [8], but there is a paucity of data. Several authors [9]\u2013[16] modify the transmission rate in response to some gained information. Our models incorporate a different paradigm and does not change the transmission rate; they instead reduce the number of susceptible individuals. Other authors [10], [17], [18] consider vaccination strategies, which can be considered as a form of social distancing. Our models can be viewed as vaccination models where the number vaccinated is proportional to the number of infections and death reported by the media. In addition, they also accounts for any other social distancing measures.\n\nSome governments are not always initially forthcoming with timely and accurate news of infectious disease outbreaks. We consider two types of time delays in the media reporting of an outbreak. If the media reports current infection data, then even starting to report well into the course of an outbreak can significantly reduce the severity of the outbreak. However, the long-term models indicate that reporting historic infection data can result in more infections than with no reporting at all (Figure S2).\n\nIn the body of the paper, we provide a non-technical description of the models and present the main results for short-term outbreaks. The precise statements and mathematical analysis are all delegated to Text S1. We develop a parallel foundation for long-term outbreaks (Figure S1), which is also in the Supporting Information. Our goal for this organization is to make the results of this paper accessible to non-modelers, while also developing and presenting the mathematical details.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe derive the following formulas for the key epidemiological quantities.\n\n\n\u2022 The maximum daily prevalence (fraction) is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 The attack rate (the total fraction of individuals who become infected) is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe compute the dependence of these quantities on the media influence intensity, . The derivatives of  and  are negative which implies that as the media influence intensity increases these will decrease.\n\n\nFigure 1(a) shows the fractions of individuals in each population compartment during the disease outbreak. Figure 1(b) illustrates the effect of increasing the media influence intensity, that is increasing . The resulting  curves are compared with  for the classical  model. As can be seen, as the media influence intensity increases, the fraction who become infected decreases due to more and more individuals choosing to employ social distancing measures , and the maximum daily prevalence, , and the time of  both decrease, which agrees with our mathematical predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe derive the following formula for the maximum daily disease prevalence.\n\n\n\u2022 The maximum daily disease prevalence is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the more complex form of the media influence function it is not possible to derive a formula for .\n\nWe compute the dependence of the maximum fraction of infected individuals on the media influence intensity, . The derivative of  is negative which implies that as the media influence intensity increases the maximum fraction will decrease. The dependence of  on the media influence intensity can be determined numerically for the parameters corresponding to the 1918 H1N1 pandemic influenza in the United States (Table 1). For the values in Table 1, we verify numerically that  is a decreasing function of . Without a formula, any other set of model parameters would need to be checked individually.\n\n\nFigure 2(a) shows the fractions of individuals in each population compartment during the disease outbreak. Figure 2(b) illustrates the effect of increasing the media influence intensity, that is increasing . The resulting  curves are compared with  for the classical  model. As can be seen, as the media influence intensity increases, the fraction who become infected decreases due to more and more individuals choosing to employ social distancing measures, and the maximum daily prevalence, , and the time of  both decrease, which agrees with our mathematical predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe derive the following formulas for the key epidemiological quantities.\n\n\n\u2022 The maximum daily disease prevalence is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 When  is less than the threshold , the attack rate is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the simplicity of the model, a pathology will occur if the media influence intensity is too high. For sufficiently strong media influence, that is for all  larger than some threshold , so many people employ social distancing measures that the number of susceptible individuals becomes zero in finite time. Since perfect social distancing will not happen even for the most frightening emerging diseases, this case is irrelevant for the purposes of the model.\n\nWe compute the dependence of these quantities on the media influence intensity, . The derivatives of  and  are negative which implies that as the media influence intensity increases these will decrease.\n\n\nFigure 3(a) shows the fractions of individuals in each population compartment during the disease outbreak. Figure 3(b) illustrates the effect of increasing the media influence intensity, that is increasing . Several intensities of media influence, both above and below the threshold value , are shown. The resulting  curves are compared with  for the classical  model. As can be seen, as the media influence intensity increases, the fraction who become infected decreases due to more and more individuals choosing to employ social distancing measures, and the maximum daily prevalence, , and the time of  both decrease as  increases, which agrees with our mathematical predictions.\n\nUp to now, we have assumed that social distancing is strict in the sense that individuals and their families never leave their isolation. Since this is not realistic, we use the model to study the case where individuals are allowed to leave their isolation for some number of hours per day to obtain food, supplies, and medical care. As can be seen (Figure 4, Tables S1 and S2), for a large range of parameters,  from 1.5 to 3.5 and , allowing individuals to return from isolation for 4 hours per day has modest effect on the attack rate or maximal daily prevalence. According to our simulations, in the worst case there is a 12% increase in morbidity.\n\nFor the extended model that includes a return from isolation, formulas for the attack rates cannot be determined. The attack rates must be computed numerically using the formula , where  denotes the final (limiting) fraction of the recovered population.\n\nWe extend our previous models to consider delays in media reporting. Including any such delay, creates a model that is infinite dimensional and seems analytically intractable. We are forced to rely on simulations to make any conclusions.\n\nFor all three types of media influence, we simulate the effect of the two types of delays in media reporting, using the model parameters for the 1918 H1N1 pandemic influenza in the United States (Table 1) and  (Figure 5). In every case, as the media holds back information for longer periods of time, the attack rate increases and the maximum fraction of infected individuals at any one time, , increases, as well as the corresponding time  of . Furthermore, the fraction who choose to employ social distancing measures decreases.\n\nWe have developed a theoretical foundation for studying how the media and public health agencies together can influence the morbidity and mortality of outbreaks of infectious diseases. We begin with the standard compartment model for transmission and include social distancing of immediate families according to three different types of media influence. Our mathematical analyses show qualitatively that the infection dynamics are the same for all three media influence types. Both our theoretical analysis and our simulations for a generic emerging infectious disease outbreak in a small city show that increasing the media influence intensity will reduce the severity of the outbreak. Since this conclusion is robust for a large range of media influence types this provides confidence in the models' conclusions.\n\nWe use our models to study the effect of delays in media reporting and we consider two different types of delays. Simulations show that for all three models the infection dynamics are qualitatively similar for each type of delay. We conclude from our models that media influence can play a significant role in reducing disease prevalence. It will be most effective if started early in the outbreak, but still will reduce prevalence if started late, even if the peak of infection has already been reached. Our models show that if reporting starts late, it is more advantageous to report current data than historical data.\n\nWhen the media influence intensity  is small in any of the models, the media has little influence on the decision of immediate families to employ social distancing measures during the course of an outbreak, while when the media influence intensity is large the media has a greater influence on the decision of immediate families to employ social distancing measures. The smaller the fraction of the population that does employ social distancing measures, the smaller the media influence intensity . For a particular infectious disease outbreak, in locations where governments tightly control the media and decide to under-report the number of infectious and deaths, the media influence intensity will be small.\n\nAlthough it is not easy to measure , it is always true that maximal reporting will be the most effective in reducing the severity of the outbreak. Our models establish that purposely with-holding information on infections and deaths will lead to much unnecessary morbidity and mortality.\n\nStrict social distancing is unrealistic because individuals or family members need to obtain food, supplies, and medial care. Therefore, we extend our model to allow for return from isolation for some number of hours each day. Our simulations of a generic emerging infectious disease show that allowing individuals to leave their isolation for up to 4 hours each day has at most a modest effect on the morbidity, for a wide range of parameter values,  from 1.5 to 3.5 and . In all three models we observe that the excess morbidity increases as  increases and as the media influence intensity  increases. Thus, the outcomes of our models with strict social distancing provide a good approximation to the more realistic case of incomplete isolation. We know of no other study of non-strict social distancing.\n\nWe stress that we did not attempt to construct a predictive model, which likely does not exist. We followed Occum's razor and constructed a simple model which captures the desired phenomena and is highly amenable to mathematical analysis. In particular, the model does not include age structure or heterogeneous mixing, and all social distancing actions are combined into one class. We derive explicit formulas for the dependence of the attack rate and the maximum daily prevalence on the intensity of the media's influence. We do so for all parameter values, and thus obtain a quite general understanding of the media influence on the morbidity and mortality. We conclude that the best policy for limiting infectious disease outbreaks is to get the news out loudly and quickly!.\n\nWe now describe the  model for a short-lived outbreak of an emerging infectious disease. By short-lived we mean an outbreak on the scale of less than one year, where natural births and deaths have negligible effect on the disease dynamics. Susceptible individuals become infected at a rate proportional to the number of infected individuals. Infected individuals recover or die at a constant rate. Susceptible individuals choose to employ social distancing measures at a rate depending on the number of infected and susceptible individuals. The model is illustrated in Figure 6 and the model is a system of differential equations presented in Text S1.\n\nThe quantities , , , and  are the fraction of susceptible, infected, removed, and socially distanced individuals, respectively, in a population;  is the transmission rate;  is the removal rate ( is the duration of infection);  is the disease death rate; and  is the media influence function.\n\nIn this model, we assume that individuals who employ social distancing measures never return from their isolation (stop applying the social distancing measures). A priori, this assumption appears unrealistic. In the Results Section we illustrate (Figure 4) the corresponding short-lived model with return from social distancing. We show in our simulations that the severity of the outbreak (e.g. attack rate) is barely effected when allowing individuals to leave isolation for up to 4 hours each day. For this reason, the outcome of our model without the ability to stop social distancing will provide a good approximation to the more realistic case. In addition, we can determine formulas for key epidemiological characteristics for the strict social distancing model, which cannot be done with return from social distancing.\n\nSusceptible individuals employ social distancing measures at a rate (heuristically probability) proportional to the number of reported infected individuals [14].\n\nIf the number of reported infections is small, then susceptible individuals employ social distancing measures at a rate proportional to the number of reported infections. As the number of reported infections increases, the rate saturates [10].\n\nSusceptible individuals employ social distancing measures at a rate depending on both the number of susceptible and infected individuals. A susceptible looks at how many fellow citizens are susceptible. The fewer there are, the higher the rate that he or she will choose to employ social distancing measures. A mechanism of this type, where individuals follow the behavior of others, is postulated in [13].\n\nThe strength of each type of media influence is controlled by the parameter , called the media influence intensity.\n\nAlthough individuals believe they are immune from infection due to their social distancing actions, in reality they may not be. Masks are not 100% effective in preventing respiratory infections and aerosols can be transported through ducts in apartment buildings. In the model, these and other defects in perfect effectiveness are reflected by choosing a smaller media influence intensity .\n\nThere is no reporting until some later time when the media starts reporting the number of infections starting at the beginning of the outbreak (historic data).\n\nThere is no reporting until some later time when the media starts reporting the current number of infections.\n\nWe illustrate our model with the different media influences by simulating an outbreak of a generic emerging infectious disease in a small city. We have in mind a virulent strain of avian influenza that is well adapted for human-to-human transmission. We select parameter values that mimic the outcome of the 1918 pandemic influenza [19]. In particular, the transmission rate  and disease related mortality, , are selected to ensure 15% mortality for infected individuals and the basic reproduction number is  (see the Results Section). Individuals are assumed to be infectious for five days. We assume that the outbreak occurs in a small city with a population of 50,000 and that the disease is first reported on by health care workers and the media when there are 30 infected individuals. All of the parameters used in the model simulations are in Table 1.\n\nSimulations for the non-strict social distancing were performed with varying  values, with  from 1.5 to 3.5. The disease related mortality and the length of the infectious period were those in Table 1, while the transmission rate was allowed to change.\n\nToward our goal of understanding the effects of social distancing, we derive analytic expressions for several key epidemiological characteristics of the models. We then analyze the dependence of these characteristics on the strength of the media influence intensity. These results are extremely general; the formulas and dependencies hold for all parameter values."}
