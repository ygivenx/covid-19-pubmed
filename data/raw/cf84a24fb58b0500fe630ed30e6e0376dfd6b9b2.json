{"title": "Glomerular Diseases Associated with Infection GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF GLOMERULAR DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH INFECTION", "body": "The histologic patterns and the most typical infectious diseases associated with them are shown in Figure 55 .2. Mesangial proliferative GN is usually acute and self-limited. Microscopic hematuria and non-nephrotic proteinuria are present in association with deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3. Serum complement may be transiently decreased. Diffuse proliferative GN is also acute and self-limited if the infection is eradicated. IgG, IgM, and C3 deposits are prominent in the mesangium and glomerular capillaries, and electron-dense deposits are present in mesangial, subendothelial, and subepithelial locations. The immune complexes deposited in the glomeruli may or may not contain bacterial antigens, and cryoglobulins may be present. Staphylococcal infections, particularly methicillin resistant, may induce diffuse proliferative GN, likely resulting from bacterial wall superantigens that induce a nonspecific polyclonal immunoglobulin response, with crescent formation and exclusive or predominant IgA deposition. The clinical presentation is the acute nephritic syndrome. Membranoproliferative GN (MPGN) is commonly observed with chronic infections. The clinical presentation is usually the nephrotic syndrome with microscopic hematuria and variable degrees of hypertension. Immunoglobulins and C3 deposits are present. In the setting of liver disease (as in Schistosoma mansoni infection), IgA may be a predominant component of the immune deposits. Membranous nephropathy (MN) is associated with chronic infections and presents as the nephrotic syndrome. Finally, vasculitis may develop in association with viral (especially hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus) or bacterial (rarely Streptococcus) infections.\n\nInfection-related GN, especially when it is immune complex associated, occurs more frequently and has a worse prognosis in conditions in which there is difficulty clearing the infection or immune complexes. These conditions include human immunodeficiency virus infection, infections acquired in the neonatal period (when tolerance is often induced, such as is observed with hepatitis B virus infection), chronic liver disease, diabetes, and chronic alcoholism.\n\nInfections may also be associated with renal disease by mechanisms that do not involve immune complexes. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with glomerular collapse (collapsing glomerulopathy) may occur with human immunodeficiency virus or parvovirus B19 infection. The hemolytic-uremic syndrome may result from verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli or Shigella species (see Chapter 28) . Amyloidosis may result from chronic infections such as tuberculosis, leprosy, and schistosomiasis. Interstitial nephritis manifested as acute renal failure may result from several viral (especially Epstein-Barr virus) or bacterial (especially Legionella) infections. Hantavirus can also induce a hemorrhagic fever-renal failure syndrome in which infection of the interstitial capillaries and tubules leads to acute renal failure (see Chapter 66).\n\nPoststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is more common in males (2:1) and usually affects children 2 to 14 years old. Traditionally, only certain nephritogenic strains of group A Streptococcus pyogenes result in GN. In the tropics and southern United States, PSGN usually follows streptococcal impetigo of M types 47, 49, 55, and 57. Throat infections with streptococcus types 1, 2, 4, and 12 are also nephritogenic. 3, 4 More recently, ingestion of unpasteurized milk contaminated with group C streptococcus (Streptococcus zooepidemicus) has caused clusters of cases and at least one large epidemic. 5 The risk of nephritis in epidemics may range from 5% in throat infections to as high as 25% in M type 49 pyoderma. A genetic predisposition is suggested as there is an association of PSGN with HLA-DR4 and DR1 and higher attack rates in siblings than expected for the general population. The risk of PSGN is reduced by early antibiotic treatment.\n\nglomeruli with plasmin-like activity, suggesting a local direct mechanism of glomerular inflammatory damage, but it is not co-localized with complement or immunoglobulin. 8 In contrast, SPEB is co-localized with both complement and IgG, suggesting a participation in the immune-mediated glomerular damage. 9 Furthermore, SPEB is the only putative streptococcal nephritogenic antigen that so far has been demonstrated in the subepithelial electron-dense deposits known as humps (Fig. 55. 3), the most typical histologic lesion of acute PSGN. In studies from Latin America and central Europe, SPEB but not GAPDH is usually detectable in renal biopsy specimens of PSGN patients. 9 In contrast, GAPDH was present in PSGN in a study of Japanese patients. 6 These contrasting results raise the interesting possibility that different streptococcal antigens are capable of inducing acute nephritis in different ethnic groups. Indeed, a study of the group C S. zooepidemicus strain that caused the epidemic outbreak in Brazil revealed an absence of the gene related to SPEB, which documents that this antigen was not involved in that epidemic. 10 PSGN is thought to occur when persistent streptococcal infection results in antigenemia and the development of circulating immune complexes that primarily deposit in the PSGN is becoming less common in industrialized countries and is changing its epidemiologic pattern from one that primarily affects children to one that now occurs more commonly in debilitated elderly individuals, particularly alcoholics, diabetics, and intravenous drug users. 2 Nevertheless, PSGN remains common in developing countries, where it may affect 9.3 to 9.8 cases per 100,000 population, 4 especially in communities with poor socioeconomic conditions. The reduction in incidence of PSGN likely relates to more rapid and frequent use of antibiotics. The common practice of fluorination of water may also be protective as fluoride reduces the expression of virulence factors in cultures of S. pyogenes.\n\nTwo nephritogenic streptococcal antigens have been identified: nephritis-associated plasmin receptor (NAPLr), which was identified as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 6 ; and streptococcal proteinase exotoxin B (SPEB) and its more immunogenic precursor, zymogen. 7 GAPDH and SPEB have been identified in renal biopsy specimens of acute PSGN, and antibody titers to both these antigens are elevated in most convalescent sera. GAPDH has been localized in areas of the 4 Additional manifestations of autoimmune reactivity include the anti-C1q antibodies, particularly in severe cases, and rarely anti-DNA reactivity, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. 4\n\nRenal biopsy shows a diffuse endocapillary GN with proliferation of mesangial and endothelial cells (see Fig. 55 .3). There is glomerular and interstitial infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes. Glomerular accumulation of neutrophils is common and is termed exudative GN. Glomerular immune deposits of C3 (100% of the cases), IgG (62%), IgM (76%), and properdin and the terminal membrane attack complex C5b-C9 (85% of the cases, usually codeposited with C3) are seen in glomerular capillary loops and in the mesangium. A seminal work by Sorger and colleagaues 11 described three patterns of immunofluorescence in the glomeruli and their clinical correlations: the mesangial pattern of irregular and heavy immune deposits, the starry sky pattern of deposits scattered in mesangium and in capillary walls, and the garland pattern formed by gross deposits in the capillary loops (see Fig. 55 .3). The garland pattern is clinically relevant because it is associated with heavy proteinuria and a large number of electron-dense subepithelial immune deposits. Ultrastructural studies demonstrate the subepithelial humps, which are typical although not pathognomonic of PSGN as they may also be observed in postinfectious GN of other causes (classically endocarditis-associated GN secondary to Staphylococcus infection), cryoglobulinemia, and lupus nephritis. subendothelial and mesangial locations to initiate an inflammatory cascade with local complement activation and the recruitment of neu trophils and monocytes-macrophages. Subepithelial immune deposits (humps) develop because of the presence of cationic antigens (e.g., SPEB) or the dissociation of immune complexes in the subendothelial space with transit and re-formation on the outer aspect of the glomerular basement membrane. Cell-mediated immunity is supported by the presence of CD4 (helper) T lymphocytes. Cytokines also contribute to the local inflammation and injury. Urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 correlates with the severity of proteinuria in the acute phase of PSGN. Several issues remain unresolved. For example, immune complex disease generally results in activation of the classical complement pathway, yet in most cases, C4 levels are normal and only C3 is found in the deposits. This could be explained by the presence of antigens (such as GAPDH) that activate the alternative pathway. In some patients, C3Nef IgG antibodies have been demonstrated in sera that are capable of activating the alternative complement pathway. Activation of the lectin complement pathway by bacterial antigens has been postulated (see Chapter 16) , but individuals genetically unable to activate this pathway may still develop PSGN.\n\nFinally, the role of autoimmune mechanisms remains to be clarified. Rheumatoid factors (especially IgG rheumatoid factor) and cryoglobulins are found in the serum of one third of patients in the first week of the disease. Rheumatoid factors (antibody to IgG) have been shown in one third of the renal biopsy specimens and in the eluate from the kidney in a fatal case. Anti-IgG reactivity may result from the loss of sialic acid from autologous IgG penicillin G 250 mg [adults] or 125 mg [children], every 6 hours for 7 to 10 days) or, in persons allergic to penicillin, erythromycin (250 mg every 6 hours in adults and 40 mg/kg in children, for 7 to 10 days). Cephalosporins may be used with equal or even better results. 12 Preventive antibiotic treatment is justified in populations at risk during epidemics and in siblings of index cases. 13 Treatment of the acute nephritic syndrome includes restriction of fluid and sodium intake and the use of loop diuretics to treat circulatory congestion. An oral long-acting calcium antagonist is usually sufficient to control hypertension. Nitroprusside is used in exceptional cases with hypertensive encephalopathy. Dialysis (either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) is required in 25% to 30% of adults but seldom in children.\n\nRare complications of acute PSGN include cerebral vasculitis, cerebral vasogenic edema, and posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy. The last is manifested by mental disturbances, visual hallucinations, headache, and convulsions and may be confused with hypertensive encephalopathy. The diagnosis requires the use of magnetic resonance imaging studies.\n\nAnecdotal reports suggest that the rare patients with crescentic GN associated with PSGN may benefit from pulse methylprednisolone therapy, and if spontaneous improvement is not observed in 2 weeks, this therapy may be tried. The prognosis of crescentic PSGN is significantly better than that of crescentic GN due to other causes, but a complete recovery may be expected in less than half of the cases.\n\nMost children with PSGN recover. In older subjects, there are higher acute complication rates, including a higher prevalence of renal impairment (60% to 70%), congestive heart failure (40%), nephrotic proteinuria (20%), and mortality (25%). 3 After recovery, mild proteinuria (<500 mg/day) and microscopic hematuria may persist for up to 1 year without worsening the long-term prognosis. Nevertheless, some subjects, especially adults, may have persistent impaired renal function, proteinuria, or hypertension. However, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) occurs in less than 1% of the children observed for 1 to 2 decades after the acute attack. 3 Certain epidemics have reported a high incidence of chronicity, perhaps because of a predominantly adult population. 14 Risk factors for the development of chronic kidney disease include an onset with nephrotic-range proteinuria, older age, and coexistent diabetic nephropathy. Certain communities, such as Australian aborigines, also have a worse long-term prognosis. 15\n\nCommunity-acquired native valve endocarditis in the United States and western Europe has an incidence of 1.7 to 6.2 cases per 100,000 person-years, and as determined by populationbased surveys, it is unchanged in the last 3 decades. 16 In the United States, 15,000 new cases of infective endocarditis occur each year. The most common infecting bacteria are Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis; Streptococcus viridans and S. pyogenes; Enterococcus faecalis; and less commonly, E. coli, Proteus, and microorganisms of the Bartonella and Candida species. The more significant changes observed in the epidemiology are the reduction in the proportion of cases associated with rheumatic heart disease and the increase in health care-associated cases. 16 Patients on chronic hemodialysis represent the most important subgroup, with 20 to 60 times the incidence in the general GN resolves by apoptosis of the excess cells. Residual renal injury is common, and biopsy specimens years later show variable degrees of focal glomerulosclerosis and mesangial expansion even in the absence of clinical disease. The clinical significance of these changes is undetermined.\n\nMost patients give a history of a previous streptococcal infection, although it has often resolved at presentation. The incubation period is longer after skin infections (several weeks) than after throat infections (2 weeks).\n\nThe classic presentation is acute nephritic syndrome. Hypertension is found in 80% of patients. Edema occurs in 80% to 90% of cases and is the chief complaint in 60%; yet ascites is distinctly unusual. 4 Primary sodium retention is the cause of expanded intravascular volume, hypertension, and edema. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone are reduced. Hematuria is universal and in 30% of cases is macroscopic. 4 The nephrotic syndrome may occur at the onset in 2% of the children and 20% of adults. Rapidly progressive renal failure, resulting from extracapillary crescent formation, occurs in less than 1% of patients. Impaired renal function occurs in 25% to 40% of the children and in up to 83% of adults.\n\nPositive cultures for Streptococcus are obtained in 10% to 70% of the cases during epidemics and in about 20% to 25% of sporadic cases. Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titers are increased in more than two thirds of patients with PSGN after throat infections, and anti-DNAse B titers are elevated in 73% of the post-impetigo cases. The streptozyme panel (which measures antibodies to four antigens, anti-DNAse B, antihyaluronidase, ASO, and antistreptokinase) is more sensitive, and the result is positive in more than 80% of subjects. Antibody titers to GAPDH and SPEB/ zymogen, although more sensitive and specific, 10 are not clinically available.\n\nSerum C3 levels are depressed in more than 90% of patients in the first week of disease and return to normal in less than 2 months. C4, a measure of classical complement pathway activation, may be normal. Serum IgG and IgM are elevated in 80% of the cases, and in contrast with another poststreptococcal disease, rheumatic fever, IgA is normal. Cryoglobulins, elevated rheumatoid factor, and anti-C1q antibodies are present in up to one third of patients, and rare patients may have low titers of anti-DNA and ANCA.\n\nSubclinical disease, manifested by microscopic hematuria and fall in serum complement, occurs four to five times more frequently than clinically overt disease and often involves siblings of index cases. 7 On occasion, whole families have various manifestations of PSGN; it is thus important to inquire about a history of streptococcal infections and signs of nephritic syndrome among family members.\n\nRenal biopsy is not routinely indicated in PSGN but may be required to confirm the diagnosis when it presents with unusual clinical features, such as nephrotic proteinuria, decreased C3 levels lasting for more than a month (suggests lupus or hypocomplementemic MPGN), or increasing renal dysfunction (suggests crescentic GN).\n\nManagement includes culture and treatment of any remaining streptococcal infection. Early antibiotic treatment is likely to prevent PSGN. Treatment is with penicillin (1.2 million units of benzathine penicillin in adults or half this dose in small children, or alternatively, oral phenoxymethyl or phenoxyethyl population. In this population, synthetic grafts and long-standing venous dialysis catheters are significant risk factors. One third of patients with bacterial endocarditis develop impaired renal function, and the risk increases with age, a history of hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and prosthetic valve infection.\n\nIn a recent survey of 62 patients with infective endocarditis in whom renal tissue was available for study, biopsy and autopsy material demonstrated GN in 26%, of which many cases were pauci-immune renal vasculitis. Other pathologic changes included localized infarcts in 31%, half of which were septic, and interstitial nephritis, mostly attributable to antibiotics, in 10%. Cortical necrosis was found in 10% of the cases. 16 The most common glomerular pathologic change is diffuse proliferative GN. Less commonly, focal GN, MN, and MPGN type I may be found. Crescent formation is found in about half of the proliferative GN forms. Widespread deposition of IgM, IgG, and C3 and electron-dense subendothelial, mesangial, and subepithelial deposits (which resemble poststreptococcal humps) are usually evident. In subacute endocarditis, focal segmental proliferative lesions with fibrinoid necrosis or capillary thrombi and mesangial immune deposits may be present. Tubulointerstitial cellular infiltration and variable degrees of atrophy and fibrosis may be seen. Intense eosinophilic infiltration should suggest another diagnosis, such as acute interstitial nephritis secondary to antibiotics. 17 The pathogenesis of endocarditis-associated GN involves the deposition of immune complexes containing bacterial antigens in glomeruli, a mechanism similar to that proposed for PSGN. Cryoglobulins (of the polyclonal or type III type) are present in 50% of subjects and may be found in glomeruli. Some bacteria (classically methicillin-resistant S. aureus) express superantigens that can also activate T cells directly and lead to a polyclonal gammopathy and immune complex GN (see later discussion).\n\nPatients often present with fever, arthralgias, anemia, and purpura. Infective endocarditis may rarely present as primary renal disease without characteristic systemic symptoms. Classic findings in endocarditis, such as Osler's nodes, Janeway lesions, and splinter hemorrhages, are seldom seen. The renal manifestations usually are microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria (except in cases with membranous GN, which may have proteinuria in the nephrotic range), with or without mild impairment in renal function (except in cases with renal vasculitis, in which renal failure is common). A rapidly progressive clinical course or nephrotic syndrome is unusual. Abnormal serologic test results include decreased C3 and C4 levels (consistent with activation of the classical complement pathway), high titers of rheumatoid factor, circulating immune complexes, and type III cryoglobulins. These serologic findings are observed in 50% of subjects with subacute bacterial endocarditis and in a higher proportion of patients with endocarditis-associated GN, although complement levels may be normal in superantigen-mediated GN. Cytoplasmic ANCA has been reported in rare cases with subacute endocarditis and GN. 18 The differential diagnosis includes antibiotic-associated nephrotoxicity, interstitial nephritis, and embolism. Embolism may originate from the left side of the heart or from the right if the foramen ovale is patent. Microscopic or large emboli may occlude small or large vessels, the latter observed with fungal or Haemophilus endocarditis. Large emboli may produce flank pain, hematuria, and pyuria; microemboli produce local infarcts and microabscesses that give the kidney the classic \"flea-bitten\" appearance. Interstitial nephritis is often associated with fever, eosinophilia, and eosinophiluria (see Chapter 60). Unfortunately, endocarditis-associated GN may also present with fever, and eosinophiluria can complicate crescentic nephritis of any etiology.\n\nAntibiotic treatment for 4 to 6 weeks usually results in complete eradication of endocarditis with correction of serologic abnormalities, but microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, and elevation of serum creatinine may persist for months after eradication of the infection. 19 Normalization of C3 levels during therapy correlates with a good outcome. In cases with crescentic GN, pulse corticosteroid therapy and plasma exchange have been used in addition to effective antibiotic therapy, but the value of these treatments remains undefined. The overall mortality of bacterial endocarditis is 20% and increases to 36% in the patients who develop renal failure. 19\n\nIn 1995, Koyama and coworkers 20 described a novel form of severe GN associated with methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections that presented with renal impairment, nephrotic proteinuria, and variable degrees of crescent formation. There was IgA dominant or codominant deposition in association with other immunoglobulin and complement deposits, and the patients had increased serum IgA levels and specific T-cell receptor V \u03b2 + subsets during the course of the disease (Fig. 55.4) . They postulated that staphylococcal superantigens were involved in the pathogenesis. The frequency of this condition is undefined, but it represents 1.6% of adult kidney biopsies in one institution. 21\n\nThe initial cases all had severe GN with acute kidney injury, heavy proteinuria, and hematuria, but the condition may present with a milder clinical picture. Whereas most cases are associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus infections, they may also occur in infection with methicillin-sensitive bacteria. 21 Diabetic glomerulosclerosis frequently coexists. 22 Complement levels may be low or normal.\n\nRenal biopsy reveals variable degrees of mesangial and intracapillary hypercellularity with or without crescent formation. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy may be mild or severe. Electron microscopy shows electron-dense deposits in the mesangium in the glomerular basement membrane and in subendothelial areas. Large subepithelial electron-dense deposits are reported in some series. IgA deposition may be mild, moderate, or intense and is dominant or codominant with other Ig deposits. C3 deposits are usually present.\n\nThe pathogenesis of staphylococcal infection-related IgA GN is not entirely clear. Koyama and coworkers 20 have implicated staphylococcal superantigens that would bind directly to the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on antigenpresenting cells, which then engage the V \u03b2 T-cell receptor region. The result is an intensive T-cell activation with cytokine production, which activates B cells that produce polyclonal IgG and IgA. They have identified a S. aureus cell envelope antigen that is co-localized with the glomerular IgA deposits. 23 Whether staphylococcus antigens are involved in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (see Chapter 22) is a possibility that deserves further study.\n\nAntibiotic treatment of IgA-dominant staphylococcus-related GN is indicated because recovery of renal function may occur. Corticosteroid treatment is contraindicated, which makes it important to establish its differential diagnosis with IgA nephropathy, in which corticosteroids may be indicated in severe cases (see Chapter 22) . Clinical characteristics that may be helpful in the differential diagnosis are the association with a staphylococcal infection (in contrast with upper respiratory infection in IgA nephropathy), the frequent occurrence of massive proteinuria (rare in IgA nephropathy), and the acute renal failure (uncommon in IgA nephropathy).\n\nAtrioventricular shunts may become infected in about 30% of cases. GN may develop in 0.7% to 2% of those with infected atrioventricular shunts; this may occur 2 months to many years after insertion. The infective organisms are usually S. epidermidis and S. aureus and less frequently Propionibacterium acnes, diphtheroids, Pseudomonas, or Serratia. In contrast with atrioventricular shunts, ventriculoperitoneal shunts are rarely complicated with GN.\n\nPatients present with insidious low-grade fever, arthralgias, weight loss, anemia, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, hypertension, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Microscopic hematuria is present in 90% of subjects, and proteinuria is often in the nephrotic range. Serologic findings include positive rheumatoid factor titers, cryoglobulinemia, and decreased serum C3, C4, and CH50 levels. Raised c-ANCA titers may be found. 24 Renal histology shows MPGN type I in nearly 60% of the cases and non-IgA mesangial proliferative GN in the remainder. IgM, IgG, and C3 deposits are present in the glomerular capillary and mesangium.\n\nTreatment requires antibiotic therapy and the prompt removal of the infected atrioventricular shunt, which is usually replaced by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Delay in diagnosis and in removal of the shunt worsens the prognosis of the renal lesion. In the event that dialysis is required, hemodialysis is the preferred modality because peritonitis complicating chronic peritoneal dialysis carries the risk of meningitis in patients with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Complete recovery occurs in more than half of the patients; persistent urinary abnormalities have been found in 22% and ESRD in 6% of the patients.\n\nOsteomyelitis and intra-abdominal, pelvic, pleural, and dental abscesses can be associated with GN. Infection is usually present for several months before it is diagnosed. Renal disease may vary from mild urinary abnormalities to rapidly progressive GN, but the most frequent presentation is nephrotic syndrome. Unlike with other infection-associated GN, complement levels are often normal. Renal histology reveals MPGN, diffuse proliferative GN, or mesangial proliferative GN. Crescents may be present. Antibiotic treatment may result in recovery of renal function if it is started early.\n\nCongenital and secondary (or early latent) syphilis may be associated with GN. In congenital syphilis, patients present with anasarca 4 to 12 weeks after birth. Nephrotic syndrome occurs in 8% of the patients and may be the primary clinical manifestation (as opposed to the more classic triad of rhinitis, C C3, IgM, IgA, and fibrin deposits is present on biopsy. Response of glomerular disease to treatment of leprosy is variable. Amyloidosis with nephritic syndrome may also rarely occur, especially in lepromatous leprosy. Other renal abnormalities associated with leprosy include interstitial nephritis. Prednisolone (40 to 50 mg/day) has been used in short courses to treat erythema nodosum leprosum associated with GN.\n\nPneumococcal pneumonia may rarely be associated with microhematuria and proteinuria, especially if treatment is delayed. Both diffuse proliferative GN and mesangial proliferative GN have been reported, and pneumococcal antigen is present in the immune deposits. Rarely, pneumococcal pneumonia can also be associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome as a result of unmasking of the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen in glomeruli by pneumococcal neuraminidase, which then allows preformed antibodies to bind and to elicit an immune response.\n\nGastroenteritis due to Campylobacter jejuni may be associated with mesangioproliferative or diffuse proliferative GN. GN may also occur with other bacterial infections, including those with E. coli, Yersinia, meningococcus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\n\n. The most common infections are those associated with HBV, HCV, and HIV. Pathogenetic mechanisms include deposition or in situ formation of exogenous (viral) immune complexes; autoantibody formation directed to endogenous antigen modified by viral injury; virus-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and growth factors; and direct cytopathic effects of viral proteins. 27\n\nRenal failure associated with severe hepatitis A virus infection may be due to interstitial nephritis or acute tubular necrosis. Rarely, immune complex-related diffuse proliferative GN with immunoglobulin and C3 deposits and the clinical picture of nephritic or nephrotic syndrome may develop, at times with impaired renal function. Recovery from GN usually coincides with the improvement of hepatitis.\n\nHBV is a DNA virus of the Hepadnaviridae family; the human is its only known natural host. Hepatitis develops as a result of immune reactivity directed to infected hepatocytes. 28, 29 Acute HBV infection may present with nausea, vomiting, fever, hepatomegaly, and a short-lived serum sickness-like syndrome: urticaria or maculopapular rash, neuropathy, arthralgia or arthritis, microscopic hematuria, and non-nephrotic proteinuria. 28 Renal biopsy, if it is performed, shows a mesangial proliferative GN. The clinical picture resolves spontaneously as the hepatitis improves.\n\nWhereas acute HBV infection may resolve uneventfully, more than 90% of infected infants, 25% to 50% of the children infected between the ages of 1 and 5 years, and 6% to 10% of older children and adults develop chronic infection (defined as osteochondritis, and rash). In acquired syphilis, renal involvement occurs in 0.3% of all patients. Adults present with nephrotic syndrome or occasionally with an acute nephritic picture. Serologic test results for syphilis are positive (rapid plasmin reagin, VDRL, and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test). MN is the most common renal pathologic process, but diffuse proliferative GN with or without crescents, MPGN, and mesangial proliferative GN have also been observed. Treponemal antigens have been identified in the immune deposits. Syphilitic GN responds to antibiotic treatment, although remission may not occur for 4 to 18 months.\n\nAcute typhoid fever from Salmonella typhi is characterized by fever, splenomegaly, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Severe cases may develop shock and acute renal failure as a part of disseminated intravascular coagulation or hemolytic-uremic syndrome, but these complications are rare. Overt mesangial proliferative GN occurs in 2% of the cases (Fig. 55.5 ), but microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria may be present in 25% of the cases. 25 Diagnosis requires the culture of the organisms from blood or stools or rising antibody titers in the Widal test. GN may also occur in patients with schistosomiasis and coexisting Salmonella infection of the urinary tract (see Chapter 54).\n\nLeprosy (Mycobacterium leprae infection) may be associated in autopsy studies with GN (5% to 14% of the cases), interstitial nephritis (4% to 54%), or amyloidosis (4% to 31%). 26 GN is manifested clinically in less than 2% of the patients. It remains controversial whether GN is more common in lepromatous leprosy than in tuberculoid leprosy. Urinary abnormalities consistent with GN often accompany episodes of erythema nodosum leprosum. Clinical manifestations are of nephrotic syndrome, less frequently of acute nephritic syndrome, and rarely of rapidly progressive GN. MPGN or diffuse proliferative GN with IgG, The prevailing view has been that treatment is not required for children with HBV-associated MN because the majority of children undergo spontaneous remission. However, clearance of HBV DNA and HBeAg has been achieved in about half of the children in controlled studies, with a higher incidence of resolution of the proteinuria in the treated group. Because HBVassociated MN may rarely progress to ESRD in children, it is reasonable to treat when proteinuria is severe or there is progression of renal disease.\n\nActive immunization is the most effective prevention measure as shown by the 10-fold decline in the incidence in Taiwan and 67% reduction in the United States 10 years after universal vaccination was implemented in 1991. 27 Polyarteritis Nodosa HBV-related vasculitis (HBV-related polyarteritis nodosa [PAN]) has become progressively rare and is observed primarily in adult men who acquire HBV infection from drug use or transfusion, usually less than 12 months after a mild attack of hepatitis. It is almost never observed in children and is rare in areas of the world where HBV infection is acquired at birth or in childhood, such as in Asia. The typical patient with HBV-related PAN presents with signs of serum sickness preceding and during a mild or asymptomatic attack of hepatitis, unlike HBV-associated serum sickness, which resolves spontaneously with clearing of the HBsAg. In these patients, the disease progresses to involve numerous organs. It typically involves medium-sized arteries and may present with a variety of presentations, including myocardial ischemia, mesenteric angina, cerebral ischemia, and mononeuritis multiplex. Renal vasculitis is manifested by microhematuria, nephrotic or non-nephrotic proteinuria, and renin-dependent hypertension. Manifestations are in general similar to those observed in noninfectious PAN, but patients with HBVassociated PAN more frequently have orchitis and gastrointestinal and renal vessel involvement, whereas pulmonary and cutaneous manifestations are rare. Rapidly progressive GN, as seen in microscopic polyangiitis, is infrequent in HBV-related PAN. 31 The pathogenesis of HBV-associated PAN is thought to be the deposition of HBsAg-antiHBs immune complexes in the arterial wall that results in a subsequent inflammatory reaction with the activation of complement. The vessels often show a predominance of IgM and HBsAg, suggesting that the injury is mediated by HBsAg-IgM complexes. Serologic tests reveal HBsAg and anti-HBc antibodies. Serum complement is usually normal, and ANCA are absent.\n\nDiagnosis requires detection of circulating HBsAg in association with either biopsy or angiographic evidence of vasculitis. Biopsy studies demonstrate vascular lesions, which are typically panmural and in different stages of development. Variable degrees of fibrinoid necrosis, fibrin deposition, and leukocyte infiltration are present. HBsAg, IgM, and occasionally IgG are deposited in the vessel wall. Angiographic studies demonstrating narrow segments and saccular or fusiform aneurysms in celiac or renal arteries have higher diagnostic yield than biopsies do.\n\nLiver biopsy demonstrates chronic active or persisting hepatitis or, rarely, acute hepatitis. The renal biopsy, in addition to the arteriolar lesions, may show relatively preserved glomeruli with variable degrees of collapse in the glomerular tuft likely resulting from ischemic changes. In contrast with idiopathic microscopic polyangiitis, necrotizing lesions with crescent persistence of HBsAg-positive serology but negative for IgM antibodies to HBV core antigen). Vertical (maternal-infant at birth) transmission is usually present in endemic areas, such as China and Southeast Asia. Horizontal transmission occurs through contamination with blood or direct contact with mucous membranes. In Europe and the United States, the prevalence is lower, and most carriers acquire the infection as adolescents or adults by horizontal transmission as a consequence of drug abuse, blood transfusions, or sexual relations.\n\nHBV carriers may present with a variety of renal syndromes.\n\nMN may occur in chronic HBV carriers. Children show a male predominance and often present with asymptomatic proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome, microscopic hematuria, and normal renal function, often with minimal evidence of liver disease. The prognosis is usually good, and spontaneous remission is common in association with the appearance of anti-HBe antibodies in circulation In contrast, adults are also nephrotic but often have impaired renal function and clinically apparent liver disease and are more at risk for progression to renal failure. C3 and C4 levels are decreased in 20% to 50%. Biopsy is consistent with MN, but mesangial immune deposits may also be present, in contrast with idiopathic MN. Virus-like particles have been identified in various areas of the glomeruli. HBeAg can often be demonstrated in the immune deposits by immunohistochemistry. 27, 29 \n\nMPGN is the most common glomerular lesion in adult HBV carriers. Cryoglobulinemia may be present, especially if there is concurrent infection with HCV. Chronic liver disease is usually present but may be clinically asymptomatic. Nephrotic or nonnephrotic proteinuria, often associated with microhematuria, is common. 28 Biopsy shows typical type I MPGN, and HBsAg is occasionally shown in the immune deposits.\n\nThere are several reports of a renal lesion mimicking IgA nephropathy in HBV infection. It is possible that this is a consequence of chronic liver disease with impaired clearance of IgA circulating immune complexes, leading to hepatic IgA nephropathy (see Chapter 22) .\n\nTreatment is aimed at eradication of HBV virus. Interferon alfa (5 million units daily for 6 months) or pegylated interferon alfa may result in remission, especially in HBV-associated MN. Lamivudine (100 mg orally once daily for 52 weeks) has also been reported to clear HBV virus and to induce remission in HBV-associated MN. A reduction of the dose is necessary when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is reduced below 50 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 . If the GFR is 30 to 49 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , the initial dose is 100 mg, and this is followed by 50 mg orally daily; if the GFR is 15 to 29 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , the initial dose is the same and subsequent does are reduced to 25 mg daily. In patients with ESRD, the initial dose is 35 mg followed by 10 mg daily. 30 Lamivudine-resistant strains may arise with prolonged use. Entecavir and adefovir dipivoxil may provide an alternative, but the nephrotoxicity of adefovir is a deterrent, although the risk is low at standard dosing if renal function is normal. Corticosteroid treatment is contraindicated because it is ineffective and may Hantavirus causes hemorrhagic fever with acute interstitial nephritis (see Chapter 66). Severe cases, occurring more frequently in endemic areas, present with acute renal failure. Milder forms are manifested with fever, hepatitis, and mild renal functional impairment. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by coronavirus may cause tubulointerstitial nephritis; acute renal failure, when it is present, is probably associated with multiorgan failure.\n\nMany viral infections, including varicella, mumps, adenovirus, coxsackievirus, and influenza, can be associated with transient microscopic hematuria, non-nephrotic proteinuria, and a mesangial proliferative GN or diffuse proliferative GN in which viral antigens can be identified in the mesangium. Measles may also cause a diffuse proliferative GN but is better known for its unique ability to induce remission in subjects with minimal change disease with nephrotic syndrome.\n\nDengue hemorrhagic fever may be caused by four serotypes of the family Flaviviridae. The clinical manifestations, reflecting increased vascular permeability, include muscle pains, gastrointestinal symptoms, and, in severe cases, bleeding manifestations and shock. Acute renal failure may accompany the severe cases; in some less severely ill patients, acute endocapillary GN with mesangial proliferation may develop and may be manifested by microhematuria and proteinuria. Intense granular deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 in mesangial areas and to a lesser degree in capillary walls are usually present.\n\nMild renal abnormalities can also be observed with acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, with microhematuria and proteinuria in 10% to 15% of cases. Acute interstitial nephritis is probably the most common renal complication, but diffuse proliferative GN and MPGN may also occur. Replicating EBV was localized not only to infiltrating macrophages but also to proximal tubular cells that were shown to express the CD21 receptor for EBV. It was posited that EBV might be a major cause of chronic interstitial nephritis. 27\n\nKidney involvement is fairly common in different parasitic diseases. With the exception of schistosomiasis, malaria, and onchocercosis, such involvement is usually mild and transient and often masked by the manifestations of the primary disease ( Fig. 55.6 ).\n\nSee Chapter 54.\n\nMalaria, caused by the protozoan Plasmodium, is transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes and is a major world health problem (Fig.  55.7) . More than 90% of cases occur in Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. 37 Malaria can also be acquired by blood transfusions, 38 transplantation of infected donor organs, 39 and bite by infected vectors introduced in aircraft (\"airport malaria\").\n\nFour major species are responsible for malaria. P. falciparum is usually associated with heavy parasitemia because it invades red blood cells of any age. Because all red cells can be infected, P. falciparum can be associated with massive infection of the red cells, resulting in acute kidney injury and multiple organ failure. This entity is discussed in more detail in Chapter 66.\n\nAcute glomerular injury may occur with P. falciparum infection. Transient urinary abnormalities, such as mild proteinuria formation are rare. Mesangial proliferative GN, diffuse proliferative GN, MPGN, and MN have all been reported.\n\nTreatment consists of a short course of corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks) and plasma exchange (9 to 12 exchanges during 3 weeks) followed by interferon alfa therapy or lamivudine.\n\nHCV is an RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family that is a common cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatoma. Chronic HCV infection can also be associated with the development of several types of glomerular disease. 32 The most common is MPGN with or without cryoglobulinemia, and this entity is discussed in Chapter 21. HCV may also be associated with MN, especially in renal transplant patients. The clinical and histologic findings are similar to those observed in idiopathic MN except that HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibodies are present in the blood. Other reported associations include fibrillary GN, focal glomerulosclerosis (especially in African Americans), and thrombotic microangiopathy with anticardiolipin antibodies (especially after renal transplantation). 33\n\nHIV infection may be associated with myriad renal complications, one of the most common of which is HIV-associated nephropathy. A discussion of HIV-associated nephropathy and other HIV-associated renal disorders is provided in Chapter 56.\n\nPolyomavirus nephropathy due to BK virus is increasingly recognized in renal transplantation and can be a cause of decreased renal function. It is described in detail in Chapter 101.\n\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) infection commonly is manifested in renal transplant recipients, in whom it can infect tubular cells and macrophages in the interstitium, resulting in the characteristic intracytoplasmic \"owl-like\" inclusions. Whereas there is some evidence that this may be a cause of tubular dysfunction, there is no evidence that this results in glomerular injury. Rarely, however, CMV has been reported in nontransplant subjects to cause a diffuse proliferative GN with immune deposits containing CMV antigens. In addition, a rare report has linked CMV infection with collapsing glomerulopathy and ESRD in patients not infected with HIV. 34 Parvovirus B19 is a single-stranded DNA virus with marked tropism for the erythroid precursor cells. In conditions in which there is increased destruction or decreased production of red cells, parvovirus infection may cause aplastic anemia as in renal transplantation and in sickle cell disease. In patients with sickle cell disease, parvovirus-induced aplastic crises are occasionally followed by nephritic or nephrotic syndrome, assumed to be the result of immune complex deposition. Diffuse proliferative GN, MPGN, and collapsing focal glomerulosclerosis (with similarities to heroin-and HIV-associated nephropathy) have been attributed to parvovirus B19 infection, and some studies but not others have detected viral DNA in kidney biopsy specimens. Granular deposition of C3 and IgG in capillary walls and subendothelial deposits have been found. 35 Studies have also suggested a relationship between renal parvovirus infection and chronic allograft nephropathy. 36 A B C and microhematuria, are encountered in 25% to 50% of patients; a full-blown nephritic syndrome with hypertension, edema, and impaired renal function is uncommon. 40 Serum complement C3 and C4 may be consumed in such cases. Renal biopsy typically shows endocapillary proliferation with mesangial expansion and infiltration with pigment-laden macrophages and parasitized red cells. Platelet-fibrin thrombi and patchy necrosis of the tubules may be associated. Immunofluorescence shows granular deposition of IgM, C3, malarial antigens, and occasionally IgG. 41 Dense immune complex deposits, containing plasmodial antigens, are seen by electron microscopy (Fig. 55.8) .\n\nAnother malarial species, P. malariae, infects only aging erythrocytes and is therefore associated with a less severe form of malaria (quartan malaria). Several studies suggest that chronic quartan malaria may be associated with a corticosteroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, referred to historically as tropical nephritis and more recently as tropical nephrotic syndrome. The disease typically affects children, usually 4 to 8 years old, and only rarely adults. It presents with heavy proteinuria and overt nephrotic syndrome, late-onset hypertension, and progressive kidney insufficiency. Despite the severe hypoproteinemia, the blood cholesterol level is often normal, presumably because of associated nutritional deficiency. Renal biopsy shows MPGN with intramembranous lacunae (due to reabsorption of immune com-plexes). Immunofluorescence shows coarsely granular IgG, IgM, and C3 deposits, and electron microscopy displays subendothelial electron-dense deposits (Fig. 55.9 ). The response to corticosteroids is poor and progression to ESRD frequent, even with eradication of the malarial infection.\n\nThe identity of quartan malarial nephropathy as a specific disease, distinct from other immune complex-mediated GNs, has been challenged in recent years owing to the inconsistency of immunohistochemical evidence. 42 It is unclear why the disease is almost restricted to Nigeria among the West African countries and Uganda in the east, being unknown in most neighboring countries where quartan malaria is endemic. However, failure to detect specific antigens in late glomerular lesions is not uncommon in most infection-related glomerulopathies, and the observation that corticosteroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in Nigeria has significantly declined with the control of malaria is consistent with a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nOnchocerca volvulus is a filarial parasite, also endemic in West Africa, particularly in Cameroon, Burkina Faso, and Ghana, as well as in Central and South America, with foci in southern Arabia and Yemen. It is transmitted by a variety of black flies of the genus Simulium, usually found in the vicinity of rivers.\n\nThe mature parasite lives for many years in the affected host, usually protected from the immune response by hiding in subcutaneous nodules. However, migrating microfilariae are amenable to clearance by the innate immune system, releasing antigens that provoke production of antibodies and immune complexes.\n\nThe clinical syndrome of onchocerciasis includes (1) a variety of skin manifestations, such as papular and lichenified dermatitis, hyperpigmentation or depigmentation, and atrophy; (2) chronic lymphadenopathy, forming large masses, particularly in the inguinal region; (3) obstruction of the scrotal lymphatic drainage, leading to enlargement and progressive stretching under the effect of gravity (hanging scrotum syndrome); and (4) corneal opacities and anterior uveitis caused by microfilarial invasion, respective immune-mediated inflammation, and subsequent scarring (river blindness).\n\nCorticosteroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome with progressive impairment of renal insufficiency is the most common renal presentation. Minimal change may occur, and also mesangial proliferative GN and MPGN, often with immune complexes containing onchocercal antigens. Antifilarial treatment does not halt the disease progression because of involvement of autoimmune mechanisms. Indeed, treatment with the antifilarial drug diethylcarbamazine may exacerbate proteinuria. Onchocercal GN may recur in transplanted kidneys. 43 Other filarial infections, such as Loa loa and Wuchereria bancrofti, may induce mesangial proliferative GN, MN, or MPGN. Visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) frequently presents with microhematuria and interstitial nephritis or diffuse proliferative or membranous nephropathy. Trichinosis may also occasionally present with MPGN, manifested clinically with microhematuria and non-nephrotic proteinuria."}
