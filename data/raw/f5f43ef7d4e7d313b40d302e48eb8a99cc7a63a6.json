{"title": "", "body": "The order Rodentia is subdivided into two suborders (Table 4 .1) (Singleton et al., 2004) . These divisions are based on various morphological differences. The larger of the suborders is Sciurognathi, which includes five families of squirrel-like rodents (including the squirrel family, Sciuridae) and five families of mouse-like rodents. The largest mouse-like rodent family is the Muridae, which includes the pet species of rats, mice, gerbils and hamsters. The Hystricognathi suborder has 16 families, with families seen as pets including the Caviidae (cavies), Chinchillidae (which includes the chinchilla), and Octodontidae (octodonts, such as the degu).\n\nPrinciples of anaesthesia in rodents are discussed at the beginning of this chapter, along with dose rates for anaesthetic agents. Later sections discuss some species differences in anatomy, physiology and pathology that may be relevant when anaesthetising the particular species.\n\nInappropriate husbandry may predispose to disease, for example obesity is common in pet rodents. A full history should be obtained, including any known medical conditions. The extent of the clinical examination may be minimal for smaller species, but larger animals, such as guinea pigs and chinchillas, can be fully assessed. All animals should be accurately weighed to ensure correct dosing with drugs and fluids.\n\nAs for other prey species, a quiet environment away from predator species is conducive to a less stressful (Singleton et al., 2004) Anaesthesia of Exotic Pets hospitalisation. Food should be provided that is appropriate for the species in question, along with water in a source recognised by the patient (a sipper bottle or bowl for most rodents). If the practice does not regularly hospitalise rodents, clients can be asked to bring in some of their pet's usual food.\n\nAdministration of fluids often assists in stabilisation of debilitated patients before anaesthesia. It is possible to administer fluids intravenously, usually accessing the lateral tail vein in rats and mice. As catheterisation and maintenance are difficult, fluids are usually administered as boluses (Table 4 .2). Subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administrations are easier, but less rapidly absorbed.\n\nMost fluids administered to rodents will be as a bolus. Large volumes of cool fluids will rapidly lead to hypothermia; all parenteral fluids must, therefore, be warmed to body temperature before administration. A constant-temperature water bath or incubator may be used to warm bags or bottles of fluids before use. The easiest method of checking fluid temperature is to spray a small volume on to your medial wrist (as you would check the water temperature in a baby's bath).\n\nDue to the small total blood volume of rodents, small volumes of blood loss can be significant. Up to 10% of the blood volume can be lost in a healthy animal without any significant effects. However, many pet animals will not be healthy and smaller amounts of blood loss may prove fatal. Blood transfusions from conspecifics may be possible, using intravenous or intraosseous routes for administration. Glucose, 5% and All species SC 10 ml/kg of 4% Pre-anaesthesia Use routinely in small rodents, 20-50% and for pregnancy toxaemia in guinea pigs Key: IM \u03ed intramuscularly, IO \u03ed intraosseously, IV \u03ed intravenously, PO \u03ed orally, SC \u03ed subcutaneously, q6h \u03ed every 6 hours (Orr, 2002; Redrobe, 2002 , Schoemaker, 2002 Rodent anaesthesia\n\nOral Peri-anaesthetic medication may be given orally to conscious patients. For small volumes of palatable medication, the syringe tip is inserted into the patient's mouth just lateral to the incisors. For larger volumes, the gavage technique may be used. To avoid endotracheal administration, the gavage tube diameter should be greater than the tracheal diameter. The patient is restrained and the dosing tube (metal or rubber) passed into the oropharynx and thence the distal oesophagus. A mouth gag should be used if the tube is not metal and may be bitten through by the patient. An inexperienced technician may cause iatrogenic oral, oesophageal or gastric injuries to the animal using the gavage technique (Bihun and Bauck, 2004) .\n\nAnatomic sites for administration of fluids and drugs may vary between species (Table 4 .3). Due to the small size of many mammals, there are also maximum recommended \n\nvolumes for administration to reduce the risk of inadvertent tissue damage.\n\nSubcutaneous injections are generally the easiest to administer, usually in the loose skin of the scruff (Fig. 4.1) , and large volumes can be given in this site. However, absorption of drugs from the subcutaneous space is slower than other routes.\n\nLarge volumes can similarly be administered intraperitoneally. Due to the large blood supply to viscera, absorption is rapid via this route. Intraperitoneal injections are more technically difficult than subcutaneous injections and some substances (including some anaesthetic agents) are irritant when given intraperitoneally.\n\nThe animal is restrained in dorsal recumbency with the body tilted so the right caudal abdomen is uppermost ( Fig. 4.2 ). This will allow abdominal viscera to fall away from the injection site and reduce risk of accidental penetration. After cleaning the skin, a small (23-25-gauge) needle is inserted in the right caudal quadrant. For most species, injection into the caudal right quadrant of the abdomen should avoid viscera (Bihun and Bauck, 2004) . If aspiration produces any fluid, such as urine or intestinal contents, the needle is withdrawn and the procedure restarted with a fresh needle, syringe and fluids. Placement of the needle through the skin and abdominal musculature causes some discomfort, and is easiest performed in sedated or anaesthetised animals. This also reduces the risk of movement causing inadvertent penetration of viscera.\n\nKey: IV \u03edintravenous, SC \u03ed subcutaneous (Goodman, 2002; Hem et al., 1998; Johnson-Delaney, 2002; Keeble, 2002; Meredith, 2002; Oglesbee, 1995; Orr, 2002; Quesenberry and Carpenter, 2004) \n\nThe intravenous route is often used in other species for rapid induction of anaesthesia or administration of fluids. This route is difficult to access in most small mammals, especially when conscious. The lateral tail vein is useful, particularly in rats. A hairdryer, incubator (35\u00b0C) or warm water (30-35\u00b0C) can be used to warm the tail (taking care to avoid heat loss by convection after removal of the tail from the water) to cause peripheral vasodilation. The site should be aseptically prepared. Insulin syringes with 25gauge needles are selected for ease of injection, although catheterisation is possible using a 24-or 25-gauge bore.\n\nIntraosseous access is an alternative to the intravenous route, although this is only possible in extremely debilitated animals or under general anaesthesia. Analgesia should be administered. In conscious animals, local anaesthetic should be used in the skin and underlying muscle. The proximal femur is commonly used for intraosseous catheter placement (Fig. 4 .3) (Bihun and Bauck, 2004) . Substances may be administered intraosseously as for intravenous access.\n\nWhilst the intravenous route is often inaccessible for injection of anaesthetic agents, particularly in conscious small animals, the intramuscular route is available for rapid drug absorption. The small size of rodent species means that muscle damage is more likely with volumes of agents used. This problem is confounded by the fact that many small mammals have a high metabolic rate and require high doses, and, therefore, larger volumes of drugs compared with other species.\n\nThe quadriceps group of muscles on the anterior surface of the thigh is most commonly used for intramuscular injections. Alternatively, the gluteal muscles of the hip may be used, avoiding the sciatic nerve in the posterior thigh muscles. If irritant substances are injected near the sciatic nerve, self-trauma to the limb may result in severe damage (Bihun and Bauck, 2004) . In larger species, such as the chinchilla, the lumbar muscles may be used for injection of small volumes, but most species have relatively small lumbar musculature.\n\nPre-medication with a sedative (Table 4 .4) may ease induction with volatile anaesthetic agents. Certain drugs will also have an anaesthetic-sparing effect, for example morphine will reduce the MAC ISO in rats but meloxicam will not (Santos et al., 2004) . Care should be taken when calculating and measuring doses, and should always be based on an accurate body weight.\n\nThe first choice for rodent anaesthesia is complete inhalational anaesthesia (Table 4 .5), for example using isoflurane. The main advantages of gaseous anaesthesia are ease of induction and maintenance, including the ability to alter anaesthetic depth rapidly, simultaneous administration of oxygen, wide safety margins with agents currently used, and more rapid recovery compared to injectable agents.\n\nIntubation is not easily possible in these species. If procedures are to be performed on the head or neck, it may not be possible to maintain anaesthesia with gaseous agents without unacceptable leakage into the atmosphere. \n\nMost inhalational anaesthetics (the exception being nitrous oxide) do not provide any analgesia and so additional agents should be administered if a painful procedure is to be performed or a painful condition exists. Rodents may be pre-medicated with one of the protocols above (Table 4 .4), but are often induced without pre-medication. Proprietary induction chambers are available, or they can be constructed from any number of different plastic boxes or bottles (see Fig. 1 .5). Transparent boxes are ideal, as they allow observation and assessment of the animal during induction.\n\nPreoxygenation of the patient will improve circulatory and tissue oxygen saturation, and is particularly useful in patients with pre-existing cardiac or respiratory disease. The addition of anaesthetic agents to the chamber usually causes some irritation to the eyes and upper airways of the animal, causing the animal to rub its eyes and nose. The use of sedation before induction will reduce the stress this causes to the animal. The anaesthetic agent can either be gradually introduced, starting with a low concentration, or a higher level of agent abruptly introduced. In the first instance, the animal is exposed initially to low concentrations of the agent and anaesthesia is reached more slowly. The second technique causes more initial irritation to the patient, but results in more rapid onset of anaesthesia.\n\nInduction concentrations of 3-4.5% are required with isoflurane and halothane anaesthesia, and 5-6% with sevoflurane (Keeble, 2002; Orr, 2002) . Onset of anaesthesia is noted when the righting reflex is lost.\n\nAfter induction the animal is switched to a close-fitting facemask for administration of anaesthetic, which allows access to the body for procedures to be performed. Several options exist for facemasks in small species, including rodent masks with a clear cone and rubber diaphragm or Key: IM \u03edintramuscular, IP \u03ed intraperitoneal, IV \u03ed intravenous, SC \u03ed subcutaneous 1 (Anderson, 1994) ; 2 (Bennett, 1998) ; 3 (Drummond, 1985) ; 4 (Harkness and Wagner, 1995c) ; 5 (Hoefer and Crossley, 2002) ; 6 (Huerkamp, 1995) ; 7 (Ivey and Morrisey, 2000) ; 8 (Johnson-Delaney, 1999); 9 (Keeble, 2002) ; 10 ( Morrisey and Carpenter, 2004) ; 11 (Orr, 2002) (Anderson, 1994) ; 2 (Huerkamp, 1995) ; 3 (Morrisey and Carpenter, 2004) circuits with a flared nose end ( Fig. 4 .5) (both VetEquip Inc, Pleasanton, CA). Impromptu masks can be made from syringe cases attached to the end of the anaesthetic circuit. A significant problem when using masks on rodents is the risk of anaesthetic gas escape from loose-fitting masks into the environment, with attendant risks to staff. Active scavenge is available with some circuits (see Fig. 2 .2, Fluovac\u00ae, International Market Supply Ltd., Harvard Bioscience Inc., Congleton, UK). Concentrations for maintenance of anaesthesia are lower than those required for induction, typically 1.5-3% for isoflurane and 1-3% for halothane (Orr, 2002) . Gerbils appear to require a higher inspired concentration of volatile agents compared to other rodents (Keeble, 2002) .\n\nThe second option for anaesthetising rodents is using injectable anaesthesia. A protocol using only injectable agents can be used, or anaesthesia can be 'topped up' or maintained using gaseous agents after induction with injectables. The advantages of injectable anaesthesia are accessibility to the head and neck during anaesthesia, avoidance of environmental contamination with volatile agents, and a lack of requirement for expensive equipment (although it is advisable to provide supplemental oxygen to all anaesthetised animals). The disadvantages with injectable anaesthetics are difficulty of administration, pain on injection or ensuing tissue damage, individual variation in response to anaesthetic drug doses, and an inability to alter anaesthetic depth rapidly. Inter-species differences in response to injection agents exist and genetic variation intraspecies has also been shown (Simpson and Johnson, 1996) .\n\nWeigh animals accurately before administration of injectable drugs. Digital scales with 1g increments are necessary for small species.\n\nIt is vitally important to have an accurate body weight for the patient before injectable anaesthetics are administered, as it is easy to overdose with these drugs, many of which have narrow safety margins (Table 4 .6). It may be necessary to dilute drugs before injection. Most water-soluble compounds will be soluble in sterile physiologic saline (0.9% sodium chloride) or sterile water for injection. A notable exception is the oily preparation of diazepam, which is immiscible in water. Care should be taken when measuring drugs into syringes, as a small error in volume may be a significant error in dose for a small animal. Remember that a one in ten dilution will require one part of anaesthetic agent mixed with nine parts diluent. It should also be noted that the hub in most needles has a relatively large volume, and the use of insulin syringes with the needle directly attached may be more applicable in tiny animals to aid dosing accuracy.\n\nAfter induction of anaesthesia with injectable agents, oxygen is usually provided via a facemask. If the depth of anaesthesia is insufficient for the procedure to be performed, volatile agents can be added to inspired gases. This is in preference to administration of further injectable anaesthetics, as recovery will be prolonged and the risk of overdose is increased.\n\nKetamine and medetomidine have been used extensively to produce anaesthesia in laboratory rats, with the righting reflex lost within 2-3 min. Both the alphaadrenergic agents xylazine and medetomidine are reported to produce increased diuresis in rats (Waynforth and Flecknell, 1992) . The effects appear to be gender-related, with female rats succumbing to deeper anaesthesia compared with similar doses administered to males (Nevalainen et al., 1989) . In mice, the effects are reversed, with females requiring higher doses of drugs to produce similar effects (Cruz et al., 1998) . As with other anaesthetic agents in mice, this combination produces marked hypothermia (by 4-4.6\u00b0C) (Cruz et al., 1998) . The effects of ketamine and medetomidine in guinea pigs are variable, with many animals requiring anaesthesia to be topped up with inhalational agents (Nevalainen et al., 1989) . Without supplemental oxygen, medetomidine/ketamine combination may produce oxygen saturations as low as 80%.\n\nWhere volatile agents have been used, recovery is usually rapid when the agent is no longer administered. Some injectable agents may be reversed, but recovery is still more prolonged compared to anaesthesia with volatile agents alone.\n\nIn the recovery period, continue to provide heat until the patient is moving around. For rats and mice, the initial environmental temperature should be 32\u00b0C, reducing to 26-28\u00b0C (Orr, 2002) . Until the animal is resting in sternal recumbency, it should be turned once or twice hourly to minimise hypostatic pulmonary congestion (Bennett and Mullen, 2004) . The patient should be closely monitored until it is able to remain in sternal recumbency. Although a companion may speed an animal's recovery from illness, they should be separated during the immediate postanaesthesia period as the conscious companion may injure the recovering animal.\n\nThe cardiovascular system may be depressed by anaesthetics, as may respiratory movements. To aid oxygen saturation, the recovery cage should be oxygen-enriched, if possible, particularly if the patient has respiratory pathology. As discussed above (Pre-anaesthetic assessment and stabilisation section), the cage should also be in a quiet area to minimise stress during recovery.\n\nAppropriate food and a water source should be provided for the animal. In the recovery period, it can be helpful additionally to supply palatable foods, such as warmed baby food, or soak pellets to increase water consumption (Orr, 2002) . Fluids and nutritional support (see Table 4 .2) may be required post anaesthesia, particularly if the animal is not observed to be eating and drinking normally within a few hours.\n\nIt can be difficult to assess if small animals are eating. Weighing food offered to the animal and the remainder the following day is one technique, but does not readily account for food spilt in the kennel. The easiest method of assessing small patients is to reweigh them on a daily basis. Minor fluctuations can be due to urination or defecation, but remember that a few grams weight difference in a 30 g mouse could be a significant 10% weight loss. If any doubt exists over whether an animal is ingesting normal amounts of food and water, supplementation should be given by assist feeding (see Table 4 .2). Key: IM \u03edintramuscular, IP \u03ed intraperitoneal, IV \u03ed intravenous * One part fentanyl/fluanisone (Hypnorm\u00ae, Jannson), two parts sterile water for injection, and one part midazolam (of 5 mg/ml concentration) 1 (Anderson, 1994) ; 2 (Cruz et al., 1998) ; 3 (Eisele, 1007); 4 (Flecknell, 1996a) ; 5 (Flecknell, 2002) ; 6 (Glen, 1980) ; 7 (Harkness, 1993) ; 8 (Harkness and Wagner, 1995c) ; 9 (Henke et al., 2004) ; 10 (Hoefer, 1994) ; 11 (Hoefer and Crossley, 2002) ; 12 (Huerkamp, 1995) ; 13 (Jenkins, 1992) ; 14 (Keeble, 2002) ; 15 (Morgan et al., 1981) ; 16 (Morrisey and Carpenter, 2004) ; 17 (Nevalainen et al., 1989) ; 18 (Quesenberry, 1994) ; 19 (Redrobe, 2001) ; 20 (Redrobe, 2002) ; 21 (R\u00f6ltgen, 2002) Rodent anaesthesia\n\nObservations on the patient\n\nThe respiratory and heart rates are often too high to physically count in small rodents, and most veterinary surgery ECG machines will not register the high heart rate. It is still useful to observe respiratory rhythm and depth. The use of clear drapes allows better observation of the patient's respiratory movements during anaesthesia.\n\nRodents have similar reflexes to other mammals. The pedal withdrawal reflex is the most useful and is lost at a surgical plane of anaesthesia.\n\nAn infant-size bell stethoscope can be used to auscultate the heart and lungs. Alternatively a Doppler probe may be placed over the heart and used to produce a more easily audible heart rate. ECG machines may be of use in larger species, with pads attached to the rodent's feet, but many machines do not register the small electrical deflections in these species. Pulse oximeters may be used on the ears or tongue of guinea pigs and chinchillas, or the feet of most rodent species; however, again they may not register a pulse with smaller animals.\n\nA rectal thermometer can be used to monitor core body temperature. Digital thermometers are most reliable, and those with external probes are easily used during surgery when drapes cover the animal and surrounding area. The thermometer should be periodically checked to ensure correct positioning.\n\nAs rodents cannot vomit, pre-anaesthetic fasting is not required. In fact, prolonged fasting is contraindicated in these small animals, which have low hepatic glycogen stores and high metabolic rates. The administration of fluids containing dextrose peri-operatively will reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia and dehydration. After induction, the oral cavity (including cheek pouches where present) should be checked for the presence of food material, which may be inhaled during anaesthesia, and cleaned if necessary with cotton-tipped swabs.\n\nOxygen should be provided to all anaesthetised patients, usually via a small facemask (Fig. 4.6) . Some rodents can be intubated (see later), but the technique is difficult. Avoid compromising respiratory function by thoracic compression from equipment or abdominal viscera (Redrobe, 2002) .\n\nHypothermia is common in anaesthetised rodents, and care should be taken to reduce heat loss and maintain core body temperature. Supplemental heat should be provided during anaesthesia, ensuring heating devices that may cause burns are not in direct contact with the animal. Electric heat pads, heated operating tables, forced warm air blankets (Bair Hugger\u00ae, Arizant HealthCare, Eden Prairie, MN), heat lamps, or hot water bottles can be used. Towels and bubble wrap can be used to insulate the animal, including extremities such as feet and tails, and are helpful in minimising heat loss. If skin preparation is required, minimise any fur clipped, use warmed disinfectants, and avoid alcohol-based preparations that may cause heat loss by convection. Hypothermia is not just an immediate problem with reduced metabolic rate, but will lead to slower recoveries as drug metabolism and excretion may be reduced (Robinson et al., 1983) .\n\nAs with other animals, care should also be taken not to overheat the patient as hyperthermia may occur. Monitor rectal temperatures during anaesthesia and the recovery period. Chinchillas and guinea pigs are particularly susceptible to heat stress, which can be fatal.\n\nAnalgesics may be used as sedatives in conjunction with anaesthetic agents. In their own right, they aid recovery from painful conditions and speed the return to normal function in patients. Pre-emptive analgesia is preferred, and multimodal therapy is often indicated. Pain is a major cause of anorexia in small animals. Analgesia should be administered if a painful condition is suspected or a painful procedure has been performed. (Flecknell, 2001 ); 2 (Funk, 2004) ; 3 (Harkness and Wagner, 1995c) ; 4 (Heard, 1993) ; 5 (Hoefer, 1999) ; 6 (Johnson-Delaney, 1999); 7 (Morrisey and Carpenter, 2004) ; 8 (Pollock, 2002) ; 9 (Richardson, 1997) ; 10 (Smith and Burgmann, 1997) Rodent anaesthesia EMERGENCY DRUGS (Carpenter, 2005) ; 2 (Harkness, 1993) ; 3 (Harkness and Wagner, 1995c) ; 4 (Harrestien, 1994) ; 5 (Huerkamp, 1995) ; 6 SUBORDER SCIUROGNATHI Family Muridae (mouse-like rodents)\n\nMuridae rodents seen as pets will include those from three subfamilies: Murinae, Cricetinae and Gerbillinae. The Murinae subfamily includes rats (Rattus norvegicus) and mice (Mus musculus). Cricetinae are hamsters (commonly the Syrian hamster -Mesocricetus auratus, but also Russian dwarf hamsters -Phodopus sungorus and Chinese hamsters -Cricetulus griseus). Gerbillanae are the gerbils (also known as jirds, the most common pet being the Mongolian jird -Meriones unguiculatus).\n\nTemperature Rodents do not have many sweat glands and cannot pant. Excess heat is lost via the ears and tails, although mice may also salivate to lose heat. All species are susceptible to heat stress (Bihun and Bauck, 2004) .\n\nThese species are monogastric, usually herbivorous or omnivorous, and are coprophagic to varying degrees.\n\nCoprophagy allows the animals to absorb nutrients including B vitamins. Captive rats, mice, gerbils and hamsters are fed formulated diets (as used in laboratories). These are more balanced than a seed mix and prevent selective feeding (for example, a preference for sunflower seeds from a grain mix). Fatty treats should be avoided as obesity is common in pet animals (Bihun and Bauck, 2004; Orr, 2002) . Obesity may compromise cardiopulmonary function during anaesthesia.\n\nSubfamily Murinae (rats and mice)\n\nThe optimal environmental temperature range for conscious rats is 18-26\u00b0C (O'Malley, 2006b; Orr, 2002) . Rats have a poor tolerance to heat, having few sweat glands and being unable to pant (Bivin et al., 1979) . They reduce their body temperature by radiant heat loss and peripheral vasodilation. The tail is important for thermoregulation and placing it on a warm surface or wrapping it in insulating material will reduce heat loss via convection. Conversely, conscious adult rats are tolerant to cold (Greene, 1962) .\n\nThe heart contacts the left thoracic wall as the left lung is small and cardiac injections (for emergency access) are possible between the third and fifth ribs (Bivin et al., 1979) .\n\nThe rat's blood volume is 60 ml/kg. The commonest site for venepuncture in rats and mice is the lateral tail vein, although the smaller lateral saphenous vein and the ventral tail artery are also available (Fallon, 1996) . Intravenous access to the lateral tail vein is easier if the tail has been warmed, as peripheral circulation is increased by vasodilation.\n\nThe oval-shaped rat trachea is 3 \u03eb 2 mm wide, and bifurcates after 33 mm (Hebel and Stromberg, 1986) . It is possible to intubate rats and mice using an inclined support stand for restraint of the anaesthetised animal, holding the mouth open to increase visualisation of the glottis. An otoscope (used as a laryngoscope), local anaesthetic spray, a stylet and small endotracheal tubes (1.22-1.27 mm for a mouse, 14-gauge 5 cm catheter for a rat) are then utilised as for intubating larger species (Kastl et al., 2004) . Transillumination of the trachea may aid visualisation of the larynx (Remie et al., 1990) . This procedure is only routinely performed in laboratories and not usually in veterinary practice. Small endotracheal tubes may readily block with airway secretions, although this risk may be reduced using positive pressure ventilation (PPV) (preferably via a mechanical ventilator).\n\nRespiratory disease is prevalent in pet rat and mouse populations (Donnelly, 2004b) . Clinical signs are usually obvious on examination, including dyspnoea, respiratory noise, sneezing, nasal discharge and stress-related chromodacryorrhoea (red oculonasal discharge of porphyrins from the Harderian glands). Upper respiratory tract irritation to ammonia or dusty bedding may cause mild signs or predispose to infections. Pneumonia is common in rats. Infectious aetiologies usually cause more severe signs, with Mycoplasma pulmonis being the most common agent in chronic respiratory disease in rats. Often other agents are involved concomitantly, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium kutscheri, Sendai virus and cilia-associated respiratory (CAR) bacillus (Orr, 2002) .\n\nSialodacryoadenitis virus is a coronavirus. Initially, infection causes a rhinitis, before disease progresses to involve the salivary and lacrimal glands. The upper respiratory tract lumen is narrowed due to inflammation, compromising the patient's breathing, and anaesthetic deaths are common (Donnelly, 2004b) .\n\nAs with other rodents, access to the airways is made more difficult by a long narrow oral cavity and the caudal base of the tongue is raised into the lingual torus (Bivin et al., 1979) . The stomach has an acute angle at the lesser curvature that precludes vomition, and so fasting is not required before anaesthesia.\n\nCedar bedding affects microsomal oxidative liver enzymes in rats and mice. Clinical signs have not been associated with these changes, but they may affect drug metabolism (Weichbrod et al., 1988) .\n\nRats concentrate urine well, and normal urine output is 15-30 ml daily. Proteinuria may be normal (Bivin et al., 1979) . Polydipsia and marked proteinuria (10 mg/l) may suggest chronic progressive nephropathy, which is common in aged rats (Orr, 2002) . Assessment of blood urea nitrogen may be required to investigate suspected renal disease.\n\nRats communicate at frequencies outwith the range of human hearing and can hear ultrasonic frequencies up to 60-80 kHz (Koolhaas, 1999) . They are sensitive to highpitched and ultrasound noises from equipment such as computers (Gamble, 1976) , but studies show that the cardiovascular system is not affected by ultrasound noise (20-40 kHz) as it is by audible noise (Burwell and Baldwin, 2006) . A quiet environment is thus important to reduce autonomic changes in hospitalised animals.\n\nThe olfactory system in rats is particularly well developed (Sharp and LaRegina, 1998) . Care should be taken to avoid inappropriate smells (for example, from other animals, including bedding from unfamiliar conspecifics) that may stress the patient in the hospital environment.\n\nGerbils have adapted to great variations in environmental temperature, from \u03ea40\u00b0C in winter to over 50\u00b0C in summer in their wild desert habitat (Keeble, 2002) . Relative humidity higher than 50% will cause them stress (Donnelly, 2004b) .\n\nThe total blood volume of a gerbil is approximately 70 ml/kg (Keeble, 2002) . Venepuncture sites include the lateral tail vein and saphenous vein (Hem et al., 1998) .\n\nWild gerbils eat coarse grasses, roots, seeds and occasional invertebrates (Agren et al., 1989) . In captivity they are mainly fed rodent mix, and fresh fruit and vegetables. Some will eat hay. Occasional treats may be given. Water is provided in a bottle (Keeble, 2002) .\n\nTyzzer's disease, caused by Clostridium piliforme, can cause fatal diarrhoea along with hepatic lesions (Motzel and Gibson, 1990) . Many gerbils become obese when fed on captive rat or mouse mixed diets, with some developing diabetes (Donnelly, 2004b) .\n\nGerbils can be intubated, but the technique requires specialist equipment and is not routinely performed in practice. Tracheotomy may be performed, or specialised laryngoscopes and endotracheal tubes used (Huerkamp, Rodent anaesthesia 1995) . Intravenous catheters (without the stylet) can be used, but are easily occluded by respiratory secretions as in other small mammals (Antinoff, 1999) .\n\nAs desert species, gerbils are highly adapted to conserving water. They produce small volumes of concentrated urine and only require low volumes of water intake. Urine is normally alkaline, and may contain protein, glucose and acetone in low levels (Keeble, 2002) . Polydipsia/polyuria and weight loss may be found with chronic interstitial nephritis, which is common in ageing gerbils (Donnelly, 2004b) .\n\nDiabetes mellitus may occur in obese gerbils (Laber-Laird, 1996) . These animals will have problems with glucose metabolism and are susceptible to hepatic lipidosis if diet is rapidly altered (Keeble, 2002) .\n\nCertain genetic lines of gerbils commonly have spontaneous epileptiform seizures (Laming et al., 1989) . A change in environment or handling may stimulate a seizure (Keeble, 2002) . With these individuals, minimising stimulation (including handling and loud noises) can reduce seizures. Although the zoonotic virus lymphocytic choriomeningitis is often asymptomatic in rodents, it may cause seizures in gerbils (Harkness and Wagner, 1995d) .\n\nA head tilt may be due to otitis media or interna related to bacterial respiratory infections (Keeble, 2002) .\n\nThese rodents are similar to the Mongolian gerbil, but belong to a different group in the Gerbillinae subfamily. However, the fat-tailed gerbil, Pachyuromys duprasi, is more insectivorous, eating some fruit (Johnson-Delaney, 2002; Kingdon, 1997) . Captive diets are similar to that of African pygmy hedgehogs, except feed can be ad libitum unless obesity occurs. Captive animals often suffer from obesity, particularly if fed on grain-based diets.\n\nThe most common pet hamster is the Syrian or golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). Dwarf hamsters, such as the Roborovski (Phodopus roborovskii) and Djungarian (Phodopus sungorus), may also be seen.\n\nThe optimum environmental temperature range for hamsters is 20-24\u00b0C (Bivin et al., 1987) . Below 10\u00b0C, hamsters will hibernate (Goodman, 2002) . They have a high metabolic rate, and are prone to heat and fluid loss. They are particularly stressed in hot and humid environments (Bihun and Bauck, 2004) , and temperatures and relative humidity should be monitored during hospitalisation using a digital thermometer and hygrometer. During recovery from anaesthesia, the environmental temperature for a hamster should be 35-37\u00b0C (Goodman, 2002) .\n\nThe midline heart in hamsters contacts the thoracic wall between the third and fifth ribs. The normal heart rate is 250-500 beats per minute. Blood volume in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) is 78 ml/kg (Bivin et al., 1987) . Atrial thrombosis (Hubbard and Schmidt, 1987) and congestive heart failure caused by cardiomyopathy have been reported in hamsters (Donnelly, 2004b) .\n\nVenepuncture is difficult in hamsters and sedation is required. Sites for injection are restricted to the lateral saphenous, jugular or cephalic veins, although the anterior vena cava or cardiac puncture are options for emergency administration of medication (Goodman, 2002; Whittaker, 1999) . Hamsters have a large amount of loose dorsal skin interscapularly, enabling easy injection of large volumes of fluids (O'Malley, 2006a) . However, fluids are slowly absorbed from this large potential space.\n\nNormal respiratory rate is 30-32 breaths per minute (Bivin et al., 1987) . Pneumonia is common in pet hamsters (Donnelly, 2004b) . Streptococcus spp. causing bacterial pneumonia may originate from their human carers. A poorer prognosis should be given for animals with pneumonia with concomitant purulent rhinitis and ocular discharge (Kuntze, 1992) .\n\nHamsters are mainly herbivorous, normally eating seeds, shoots and root vegetables, but also consuming leaves and flowers (Feaver and Shibin, 2004) . This species feeds in short (5 min) bursts with 2-h fasts between (Bivin et al., 1987) . Food intake is 5-7 g daily (Newcomer et al., 1987) .\n\nThe base of the tongue is muscular (Bivin et al., 1987) . Vomiting is impossible, as the lesser curvature of the stomach is very short, with the cardia near the pylorus (Hoover et al., 1969; Lipman and Foltz, 1996) . Fasting is not required before anaesthesia, but the large cheek pouches should be emptied on induction to reduce the risk of aspiration of stored food material.\n\nNormal hamster urine may vary widely in pH, from 5.1 to 8.4. They drink 10 ml water per 100 g bodyweight daily (Goodman, 2002; Newcomer et al., 1987) . Urine production is usually 7 ml per day (Syrian hamster), but this may increase 10-fold in diabetic individuals (Harkness and Wagner, 1995b) . As is the case with rats, proteinuria may be normal (O'Malley, 2006a) .\n\nThese nocturnal animals have a well-developed sense of smell and acute hearing; including an ability to hear at ultrasonic levels (Feaver and Shibin, 2004) . Efforts should be made to reduce stress on hospitalised individuals by minimising strong odours and loud noises.\n\nMost mouse-like rodents are nocturnal, although to varying degrees. For example, rats are more nocturnal than mice. They should be woken gently to avoid evoking a bite response. The small size of many patients limits clinical examination and history taking may be more important in identifying potential causes or predisposing factors for disease.\n\nObservation of the patient before handling may identify cardio-respiratory disease, for example lethargy, noisy respiration or dyspnoea. It is useful to observe respiratory movements and measure respiratory rate (not possible in smaller species as often too rapid to count) at rest, as the stress of handling may significantly alter the breathing pattern. If dyspnoea is noted, handling should be minimised to avoid stress and possible mortality.\n\nPre-existing disease may well compromise cardiopulmonary function during anaesthesia. The identification of disease in these animals may in itself not be straightforward, although careful history taking and clinical examination may reveal abnormalities. In an ideal situation, urine analysis, blood biochemistry and haematology should be performed prior to anaesthesia. Dipstick analysis and specific gravity can be performed on quite small urine samples collected on to a clean non-absorbent kennel liner (for example, an upturned incontinence pad). However, in most patients even venepuncture will require anaesthesia. Familiarity with the species in question, including knowledge of good husbandry practices, normal body condition and behaviour, aids in clinical assessment of the patient pre-anaesthesia.\n\nAn accurate weight (to the nearest gram in species as small as mice) is essential before the administration of medications, as accidental overdosage is easy.\n\nThe small size of Muridae species precludes some anaesthetic techniques routinely used in larger species and makes others technically difficult.\n\nIntubation is not routinely performed in pet rodents and intravenous access may not be possible. Injectable agents can be administered via the subcutaneous, intramuscular or intraperitoneal routes. The injectable anaesthetic drugs cannot, therefore, be given gradually to effect, and much individual animal variation in response to anaesthetics exists. In most cases, volatile anaesthetics are used for induction and then also maintenance of anaesthesia in rodents (Johnson-Delaney, 2002) . A chamber is used to induce anaesthesia, transferring to a small facemask or nose cone for maintenance. Sevoflurane may be used, but haloalkenes produced by contact with carbon dioxide absorbents are reported to cause nephrotoxicity in rats (Patel and Goa, 1996) . There are instances where injectable agents are required, often in conjunction with volatile agents.\n\nDoses appropriate for hamsters are used in fat-tailed gerbils.\n\nThis family includes the chipmunk (Tamias sibericus) and prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus).\n\nChipmunks are omnivorous, with their wild diet mainly comprising seeds, buds, leaves and flowers. The diet in captivity is commercial dry mixes, along with fresh and dried fruit, vegetables and nuts. Some dog biscuits and animal protein (mealworms, cooked meat, hard-boiled eggs and day-old chicks) may be offered (Meredith, 2002) . Water is usually provided in a sipper bottle.\n\nThis species is less commonly seen as pets than other rodents. Chipmunks are very susceptible to stress, including noise, overcrowding and being caged in a confined space. Prolonged exposure to the electromagnetic and ultrasonic radiation from televisions can result in death. After transportation or other stressful event, a chipmunk may be subdued for 24 h (Meredith, 2002) .\n\nAs many pet chipmunks are not used to handling and become stressed when caught, general anaesthesia is often required for clinical examination. Gaseous anaesthesia is usually easiest, as minimal handling is required prior to placing the animal in an induction chamber.\n\nFew drug doses are published for this species, but many clinicians extrapolate from rat doses. Chipmunks require 75-100 ml/kg of fluid daily for maintenance (Meredith, 2002) .\n\nThe black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) is uncommonly seen in the UK, but some pet animals are present in the USA. These animals like to burrow, so deep substrate, such as shredded paper, should be provided during hospitalisation. Prairie dogs may transmit a variety of zoonotic infections, including Yersinia pestis and Salmonella (Funk, 2004) .\n\nThe optimum environmental temperature for prairie dogs is 20-22\u00b0C, with relative humidity between 30 and 70% (Johnson-Delaney, 1996; Lightfoot, 1999) . Dormancy is induced at temperatures below 16\u00b0C.\n\nAnimals over 3 years of age frequently develop dilated cardiomyopathy (Lightfoot, 1999 (Lightfoot, , 2000 .\n\nVenepuncture may be possible in conscious prairie dogs using the lateral or medial saphenous vein, cephalic vein or jugular vein. The cranial vena cava may be accessed in anaesthetised animals.\n\nVarious environmental conditions predispose to respiratory problems in prairie dogs, including poor ventilation, high humidity and excess dust. Obese animals are often dyspnoeic (Funk, 2004) . Sinusitis, rhinitis, cardiomyopathy and dental disease (such as infection or neoplasia) may cause upper respiratory tract problems. Many wildcaught animals will have pulmonary mites (Pneumocoptes penrosei), which may lead to dyspnoea by occluding the nasal passages. Pneumonia may be caused by bacterial (for example, Pasteurella multocida), fungal (for example, Aspergillus sp.) and mycoplasma (Johnson-Delaney, 2002) infections. Pre-anaesthetic stabilisation of dyspnoeic animals may require oxygen therapy, nebulisation, appropriate antimicrobials and bronchodilation.\n\nPrairie dogs in the wild graze on grasses, and also on leaves, herbs and flowering plants. They will occasionally take some invertebrates and, rarely, carrion (Funk, 2004) . As hindgut fermenters, prairie dogs require adequate roughage in their diet, so captive animals should receive unlimited grass hay. Juveniles can also receive pelleted chows and alfalfa ad libitum. Pellets should be limited if the animal becomes obese or when they reach adulthood. Treats include small amounts of fresh greens. Obesity is common in captivity (Johnson-Delaney, 2002) .\n\nBoth hepatic and renal neoplasias have been reported in prairie dogs (Griner, 1983; Tell, 1995; Woolf et al., 1982) .\n\nInduction and maintenance of anaesthesia are usually performed with isoflurane. A chamber or facemask is used for induction. Usually volatile anaesthetics are administered via a facemask to maintain anaesthesia. Endotracheal intubation is possible and is performed similarly to rabbits using either a blind technique or visualised with a laryngoscope. Endotracheal tubes of 2.0-2.5 mm can be used (Johnson-Delaney, 2002) .\n\nInjectable anaesthetics have been used in prairie dogs. However, care should be taken, particularly in obese animals that may have variable responses to injectable agents.\n\nSupplemental heating is necessary during anaesthesia to prevent hypothermia in chipmunks and prairie dogs. The patient's rectal temperature should also be monitored.\n\nSimilarly to other small species, fluids and nutritional support are often required during hospitalised sciuromorphs.\n\nGuinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), chinchillas (Chinchilla laniger) and degus (Octodon degus) are hystricomorph rodents. These species are monogastric herbivores. Most animals are sufficiently calm to allow a conscious physical examination, although individual animals in a debilitated condition may become too stressed to complete the examination at one time.\n\nGuinea pigs are sociable and housing a companion with the patient may encourage normal behaviour. The use of bedding such as shredded newspaper or cardboard hide boxes will also reduce stress. Dietary provisions should include good-quality hay, a selection of vegetables including leafy greens, proprietary guinea pig concentrate pellets or mix, water in a bowl or bottle (depending on what the individual is accustomed to), with vitamin C supplementation (at 2 g/L of drinking water (Quesenberry, 1994) or 10-30 mg/kg/day orally (Adamcak and Otten, 2000) ).\n\nThis species conserves heat well, but is prone to heat stress. Ideally, the environmental temperature should be 18-26\u00b0C (Harkness and Wagner, 1995c) . However, as with other small mammals, supplemental heat should be provided to guinea pigs during anaesthesia. Careful monitoring of core temperature with a rectal probe (Fig. 4.7) should be performed during anaesthesia and during the recovery period. Guinea pigs are prone to heat stress and care should be taken to avoid overheating animals during hospitalisation.\n\nGuinea pigs have 70-75 ml of blood per kilogram body weight. The short neck of the guinea pig comprises a thick layer of muscle ventrally, making jugular venepuncture difficult. A cut-down technique should be used if a catheter is to be placed in the jugular vein . For administration of fluids, intravenous sites available in this species are the lateral saphenous vein or cephalic vein, although these small veins are difficult to catheterise. A 22-25-gauge needle or 24-gauge or smaller catheter should be used. The ear veins are visible, but very small, and hence difficult to access in guinea pigs. An alternative site for phlebotomy or administration of drugs is the anterior vena cava, for which sedation or general anaesthesia is required. If long-term intravenous access is required, venous access ports can be used. Routinely, fluids are administered subcutaneously (avoiding the interscapular region where the skin is closely apposed to underlying tissues, including the subcutaneous fat pad) or intraperitoneally (Brown and Rosenthal, 1997) .\n\nThe large guinea pig heart lies midline at the level of the second to fourth intercostals space, with a narrow space bilaterally for lungs (Breazile and Brown, 1976) . In immature animals the cranial mediastinum contains the cervical thymus, being replaced by fat in the adult (Harkness and Wagner, 1995a) . These anatomical relationships mean that the lungs are very small in guinea pigs and, hence, any lung pathology may readily cause clinical signs or increase the risk of anaesthesia in this species.\n\nThe opening into the oral cavity is narrow and, as with all rodents, the oral cavity is long. Passage from the oropharynx to the pharynx and thence into the respiratory tract is via the palatal ostium (or interpharyngeal ostium), which is the central opening between the caudal tongue and the soft palate (Timm et al., 1987) . Endotracheal intubation is possible in the guinea pig, but difficult, as the palatal ostium is a small opening, visualisation is poor and lateral deviation when introducing the tube will damage the vascular velopharyngeal folds in the soft palate ). An otoscope can be used to visualise the glottis and insert a guide wire, and the otoscope removed before threading an endotracheal tube (16-12-gauge catheter) over the wire (Flecknell, 1996b) .\n\nPneumonia is common in pet guinea pigs, with damp or humid environments predisposing to bacterial infections, such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Viral pneumonia has also been reported. Primary pulmonary neoplasia, bronchogenic pulmonary adenoma, is common in guinea pigs. Lymphosarcoma, caused by a type C retrovirus, may affect the mediastinal lymph nodes and cause dyspnoea (Collins, 1988) . Supportive care should be administered before anaesthesia is induced in dypnoeic animals, including oxygen therapy, fluid administration and oral vitamin C (O'Rourke, 2004).\n\nGuinea pigs should be fed hay and fresh vegetables, supplemented with a concentrate mix (preferably complete pelleted diet rather than a cereal mix). They have a daily requirement for vitamin C of approximately 10 mg/kg, rising to 30 mg/kg/day during pregnancy. Good-quality food should always be available to hospitalised guinea pigs. Unfortunately, many will become depressed and refuse to eat and drink while hospitalised, so assist feeding (Table 4 .2) is often necessary. Proprietary herbivore formulas (for example, Oxbow\u00ae Critical Care for Herbivores, Petlife International Ltd, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk), softened guinea pig concentrate pellets, or vegetable baby food (dairy-free) can be administered orally . Vitamin C should be given daily to hospitalised animals, either in the drinking water or directly administered by syringe if the patient is not drinking. Housing a companion simultaneously may reduce stress and encourage normal behaviour in these social animals, but can make assessment of appetite and urine and faecal production difficult.\n\nThe gastric emptying time in guinea pigs is normally 2 h and total gastrointestinal transit time 20 h on average, longer if coprophagy is included (Jilge, 1980) . As this species has a very small lesser stomach curvature, they cannot vomit, and fasting is not required before anaesthesia. Guinea pigs feed primarily at dawn and dusk, but often retain food in their oral cavity. For this reason, the oral cavity should be checked for the presence of food material and cleaned with cotton-tipped swabs on induction of anaesthesia if necessary.\n\nGastrointestinal hypomotility is common after anaesthesia or surgery in guinea pigs, or associated with other disease processes or stress. Prokinetics (see Table 2 .3) are usually administered prophylactically when guinea pigs are anaesthetised to reduce the risk of ileus.\n\nDiarrhoea in guinea pigs may be caused by a number of aetiologies, including bacterial overgrowth secondary to oral administration of certain antibiotics, primary bacterial enteritis and endoparasites (O'Rourke, 2004) . The guinea pig should be stabilised before anaesthesia is induced, by correcting fluid deficits caused by diarrhoea and the common concomitant anorexia.\n\nIf hepatic disease is suspected, blood biochemistry may be performed. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is not sensitive or specific for hepatocellular damage in guinea pigs (White and Lang, 1989) . Hepatic lipidosis is common after a period of anorexia, and may result in ketosis and hypercholesterolaemia .\n\nDaily water update is approximately 100 ml/kg in guinea pigs (Manning et al., 1984) . The normal urine pH is 9.0 in these herbivores (Navia and Hunt, 1976) . If an animal has been anorexic for a few days or more, dipstick analysis of urine can be used to assess for the presence of ketones. Ketonuria is produced in ketoacidotic animals, which will require stabilisation of metabolic derangements prior to anaesthesia.\n\nMany guinea pigs older than 3 years of age have chronic interstitial nephritis, which may be associated with other Check the oral cavity after induction and remove retained food if present to avoid aspiration.\n\nconditions, such as diabetes mellitus, or occur secondary to renal amyloidosis. Guinea pigs commonly develop urinary tract calculi. Post-renal azotaemia may result from partial or complete obstruction. Volatile agents, such as isoflurane or sevoflurane, are the anaesthetic of choice for investigation and surgical treatment of such cases (O'Rourke, 2004).\n\nDiabetes mellitus has been reported in some guinea pigs, some responding to insulin while others are noninsulin-dependent (Bowden, 1959; Hartmann, 1993; MacKay et al., 1949; Marlow, 1995) . As is the case with other species, diabetes should be stabilised (with an appropriate diet and/or insulin) prior to anaesthesia. As guinea pigs are not fasted prior to anaesthesia, hypoglycaemia is less likely during the procedure, but blood glucose levels should be monitored throughout the anaesthetic and in the recovery period, and dextrose administered as required.\n\nDystocia is common in guinea pigs, and Caesarean sections are often warranted. The anaesthetic of choice for this procedure is a volatile agent, either isoflurane or sevoflurane. Pre-medication with buprenorphine may be helpful in causing mild sedation before mask induction, and will also provide post-operative analgesia.\n\nAnother common reason for anaesthesia of guinea pigs is surgical excision of mammary neoplasia. A small number of these are malignant, for example adenocarcinomas. Metastasis is rare, but the thoracic cavity should be auscultated and radiographed to assess for pulmonary involvement and function. The abdomen should also be assessed for visceral involvement by palpation and ultrasound.\n\nIt is unwise to anaesthetise a guinea pig suffering from pregnancy toxaemia. The animal will be hypoglycaemic, ketonuric, proteinuric and aciduric (pH 5-6). Hepatic lipidosis also usually occurs. Despite intensive supportive care, many animals die (O'Rourke, 2004) . Treatment is stressful, and restraint and anaesthesia will add to the stress and thereby speed mortality.\n\nAnaesthesia is usually induced in guinea pigs with a volatile anaesthetic in an induction chamber. A period of preoxygenation precedes addition of the anaesthetic agent. Once the righting reflex is lost, the guinea pig is removed from the chamber and oxygenation (for short procedures) or anaesthesia (for longer procedures) maintained via a facemask. It is important to use a small mask to minimise dead space, and for the mask to be closefitting to reduce contamination of the environment with waste gases.\n\nVolatile anaesthetic agents are primarily used for short investigative procedures in guinea pigs. However, there are two scenarios where injectable agents are preferable. It may be difficult to maintain sufficient depth of anaesthesia for surgery using inhalation agents alone, or the procedure to be performed may require access to the head that is restricted by a facemask.\n\nDuring anaesthesia, guinea pigs frequently become apnoeic. This can make maintenance of anaesthesia difficult via volatile agents solely (Flecknell, 2002) . In this scenario, injectable sedatives (see Table 4 .4) may be used to relax the patient so a normal respiratory pattern resumes, or injectable anaesthetics (see Table 4 .6) administered to replace the requirement for inhalational agents. If injectable agents are used alone to provide anaesthesia, oxygen should always be supplemented via a facemask.\n\nTwo common reasons for anaesthetising guinea pigs are for dental treatment, necessitating access to the oral cavity, or the treatment of cervical lymphadenitis. In the former case, it may be possible to intubate the patient, but the endotracheal tube and attached anaesthetic circuit will make the dental procedure difficult. Similarly, when operating on the cervical region, a facemask may intrude on the sterile surgical field. It is easier to use injectable anaesthetic agents and to provide supplemental oxygen via a small mask over the nose (Fig. 4.8 ). If necessary, anaesthetic gases can be administered via the nares, but a good seal between mask and patient may not be achievable, allowing environmental contamination.\n\nGuinea pigs with pregnancy toxaemia are very poor candidates for anaesthesia. \n\nHalothane may cause hypotension and hepatic damage. Isoflurane is safer; however, irritation of mucous membranes during induction may cause lacrimation and salivation in guinea pigs (Flecknell, 2002) . Sevoflurane causes less irritation to the airways. Doses for injectable sedatives or anaesthetic protocols are shown in the tables (see Tables 4.4 and 4.6), but there is much individual variation in response to these drugs.\n\nEpidural anaesthesia has been reported in the guinea pig (Thomasson et al., 1974) .\n\nThe heart rate can be palpated or auscultated using a bell stethoscope over the thoracic wall, but rates up to 300 beats per minute are extremely difficult to count. In larger patients, an oesophageal stethoscope may be used similarly. Echocardiogram (ECG) pads can be attached to the feet (Fig. 4.9 ) or needle probes placed subcutaneously to inhance electrical conduction (Schoemaker and Zandvliet, 2005) , but many machines cannot detect the low signal strengths and high frequencies in these animals (Flecknell, 2002) .\n\nRespiration is usually monitored by observing the patient. If a close-fitting facemask is used, breathing movements may be seen in the reservoir bag. Respiratory monitors can be used, but care should be taken in the choice of equipment so as not to increase dead space within the anaesthetic circuit (see Chapter 1). Pulse oximeters may be attached to the paw, but the high heart rate in guinea pigs may again be greater than the limit on some models (Flecknell, 2002) . Oxygen saturation is improved by administering oxygen via a facemask throughout anaesthesia.\n\nAs guinea pigs are not routinely intubated during anaesthesia, PPV is not usually possible. It can be attempted using a tightly fitting facemask by compressing the reservoir bag with the expiratory valve temporarily closed; however, inadvertent oesophageal insufflation may result in gastric tympany. Alternative methods of respiratory assistance are thoracic compression and the use of respiratory stimulants, such as doxapram (Flecknell, 2002) .\n\nMonitoring and maintenance of body temperature are essential in guinea pig anaesthesia. Supplemental heat can be provided as for other species, and a rectal thermometer (see Fig. 4 .7) used to monitor temperature. These processes should be continued during the post-anaesthetic period, until the guinea pig has recovered sufficiently to be able to thermoregulate.\n\nSince intravenous access is limited in the guinea pig, fluids to support the circulation are usually administered as a bolus subcutaneously (see Fig. 4 .1) or intraperitoneally (see Fig. 4 .2) during anaesthesia. Subcutaneous fluids are more slowly absorbed.\n\nDuring recovery, a facemask can be used initially, moving to a chamber supplemented with oxygen if necessary when the animal becomes more reactive. In the recovery period, supplemental heat should be continued until the patient is able to thermoregulate. If volatile agents have been used, recovery is usually rapid. Injectable agents produce a more prolonged recovery, as will painful procedures. If recovery is unexpectedly slow, body temperature should be checked using a rectal thermometer and analgesia requirements reassessed.\n\nIt is important that these herbivorous animals begin eating soon after anaesthesia, to reduce the risk of ileus. Analgesia (Table 4 .7) may be required if a painful condition exists or surgery has been performed. Opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and local anaesthesia can all be used in guinea pigs (Flecknell, 2002) . Prokinetics may be necessary to stimulate gastrointestinal motility, but often syringe feeding is more beneficial in maintaining hydration and movement of ingesta through the digestive tract.\n\nChinchillas usually occur in large groups in the wild. The more common situation in captivity is a single animal, a pair, or a polygamous group of a single male with two to six females . As shy animals, provision of a cardboard box (as for guinea pigs) or plastic pipe hide will reduce the stress of hospitalisation. Pets should have climbing and jumping space at home, but a single-level kennel is satisfactory for hospitalisation purposes. A dust bath (using commercial chinchilla sand or volcanic ash) should be provided for a short time daily during hospitalisation.\n\nChinchillas are adept at hiding signs of disease and subclinical pathology is often present. It is, therefore, important to question the owner closely regarding husbandry conditions, to identify any factors that may predispose to illness. A full clinical examination is possible on most pet chinchillas, and disease processes that the owner has not noticed may be detected in this manner.\n\nChinchillas are adapted to living in the cold temperatures of the Andes mountains and have thick fur. The environmental temperature range should ideally be 10-20\u00b0C, although chinchillas are adapted to ambient temperatures of between 18.3\u00b0C and 26.7\u00b0C, with relative humidity below 50% (Donnelly, 2004a; Webb, 1991) . Chinchillas do not tolerate damp or wet environments . Although hypothermia is the main concern during Figure 4.9 \u2022 Echocardiograph pads on an anaesthetised guinea pig, Cavia porcellus. The pads are stabilised on the small feet using adhesive tape. anaesthesia, they may easily succumb to hyperthermia when environmental temperatures are above 28\u00b0C (Hoefer and Crossley, 2002) . Environmental and rectal temperature must be monitored closely during anaesthesia and the recovery period.\n\nAs with guinea pigs, intravenous access can be difficult and sedation or anaesthesia is required in most animals. 25-gauge needles or insulin syringes (28-gauge) can be used to access peripheral veins, such as the lateral saphenous or cephalic. Catheters should be 24-gauge or smaller. A cut-down technique is required for jugular access. If long-term intravenous access is required, venous access ports can be used .\n\nCardiomyopathy and valvular disease have been reported in chinchillas (Hoefer and Crossley, 2002) . If clinical signs are present, they are usually of dyspnoea associated with cardiac failure. Cardiac murmurs heard on auscultation may or may not be significant (Hoefer and Crossley, 2002) . Echocardiography and electrocardiography are indicated to investigate any heart murmurs identified on clinical examination before the animal is anaesthetised (Donnelly, 2004a) .\n\nChinchillas are hindgut fermenting herbivores. In the wild they consume a variety of grasses, cactus fruit, leaves and bark of small shrubs and bushes. The vegetation is tough and fibrous, with low energy content. The captive chinchilla diet should predominantly be good-quality meadow grass hay (for example, Timothy grass hay), with a small amount of proprietary chinchilla pellets, and ad libitum water. Occasional treats may include fruit and small amounts of greens (Hoefer and Crossley, 2002) . Chinchillas eat mainly at night, so food should be available constantly. A daily weight check will be a more accurate method of assessing appetite than observations during daylight hours. The mean gastrointestinal transit time is 12-15 h .\n\nDental disease is the most common reason for presentation of pet chinchillas at veterinary practices. Often animals have had a reduced or altered appetite for some time, and many animals are in poor body condition. In these cases, the chinchilla must be assessed and a decision made as to whether the anaesthetic required for dental treatment should be postponed while nutritional support is given, or whether the animal is stable enough to be anaesthetised and receive dental attention, which will relieve oral discomfort and allow the animal to self-feed. In some cases, a staged procedure is used, whereby the use of volatile agents or a short-acting combination allows an initial assessment and perhaps minor dental treatment. After a few days of nutritional support, when the chinchilla is in better body condition, a more prolonged procedure can be performed under a longer anaesthetic. Diarrhoea may be caused by an inappropriate diet, overfeeding, sudden dietary change, bacterial or parasitic enteritis (Donnelly, 2004a) . Hepatic disease caused by metronidazole toxicity and neoplasia (Nobel and Neumann, 1963) have been reported.\n\nAs with other herbivores, ileus can cause significant morbidity (and mortality in some instances) post anaesthesia. Prokinetics are frequently used in chinchillas perianaesthetically (see Table 2 .3). Syringe feeding is also a useful procedure if the patient is not self-feeding soon after anaesthesia.\n\nNormal chinchilla urine has a pH of 8.5, and it is usually concentrated with a specific gravity greater than 1.045 (Merry, 1990) . As is the case with guinea pigs, dipsticks can be used to check for ketonuria.\n\nCalcium oxalate crystals may precipitate in the renal tubules, causing renal dysfunction (Goudas and Lusis, 1970) . Lower urinary tract disorders, such as calculi, may lead to post-renal azotaemia. In animals with suspected urinary tract disease, renal function should be assessed before anaesthesia by analysing urine and blood parameters. If renal dysfunction is found, fluids should be administered before, during, and after anaesthesia to ensure renal circulation is not compromised. Drugs that may be metabolised or excreted via the kidneys should be avoided. Volatile agents, such as isoflurane and sevoflurane, may be used, as their excretion is almost completely via the respiratory tract.\n\nDiabetes mellitus has been reported in a chinchilla (Marlow, 1995) . Glucosuria and ketonuria were present in the case, along with hyperglycaemia. Blood glucose levels should be monitored in diabetic animals perianaesthetically, encouraging them to feed normally as soon as possible when recovered.\n\nPre-anaesthetic clinical examination of chinchillas should include assessment of their demeanour and neurological function. Differential diagnoses for animals with clinical signs consistent with central nervous system disease include infection with viruses (for example, herpesvirus (Goudas and Giltoy, 1970; Wohlsein et al., 2002) ), bacteria (for example, Listeria monocytogenes (MacKay et al., 1949) ), protozoa (for example, Frenkelia microti (Dubey et al., 2000) ), or nematodes (for example, Baylisascaris procyonis in Canada (Sanford, 1991) ). Head trauma could also cause central nervous dysfunction.\n\nAnaesthesia may adversely affect animals with a compromised central nervous system, primarily by reducing blood oxygen saturation and its supply to the brain. Care should be taken with these cases to provide sufficient oxygen, and to maintain the circulation and blood pressure by administering fluids. Volatile anaesthetic agents are used in these cases, as they have the least depressive effects on metabolism and depth of anaesthesia can rapidly be altered if necessary. Midazolam or diazepam can be administered as a pre-medicant to reduce the risk of seizures.\n\nChinchilla sedation may be necessary for phlebotomy or non-painful procedures, such as radiography or ultrasonography. Midazolam can be used to produce mild sedation, or ketamine added to produce deeper sedation. The midazolam and ketamine mix can be used for pre-medication or light anaesthesia prior to induction/maintenance using gaseous anaesthetic agents (see Tables 4.4 and 4.6).\n\nInduction of anaesthesia in chinchillas is commonly performed in a chamber using inhalational agents, often without pre-medication. After preoxygenation for a few minutes, 2-5% isoflurane or halothane is added to induce anaesthesia. Loss of the righting reflex denotes anaesthesia. Usually 2-4% isoflurane or 2-3% halothane is required for maintenance of anaesthesia (Hoefer and Crossley, 2002) .\n\nIn some cases, injectable anaesthesia is preferable to gaseous agents, for example when dental disease necessitates access to the oral cavity. General anaesthesia can be induced using a mix of acepromazine and ketamine. This rapidly results in surgical anaesthesia that lasts for up to 1 h. Ketamine has a wide safety margin. Acepromazine should be avoided in hypovolaemic animals, and the doses listed for both drugs may be reduced for debilitated animals. The combination is not reversible, and sleep time can be up to 5 h (Morgan et al., 1981) . Ketamine can also be used in combination with xylazine or diazepam. The ketamine combinations can be topped up with volatile agents, such as isoflurane, if necessary.\n\nA study comparing three injectable anaesthetic combinations (Henke et al., 2004) showed the combination of midazolam with medetomidine and fentanyl to produce safer anaesthesia. Recovery after xylazine with ketamine anaesthesia was more prolonged. Cardio-respiratory depression was less compared to animals given ketamine with xylazine or medetomidine, and the triple combination protocol allowed complete and rapid reversal using antagonists. Bradycardia associated with alpha-2-agonists appears to be less marked in chinchillas than that seen in other species (Henke et al., 2004) . This shorter recovery phase enables animals to return to normal physiological activity sooner, and reduces the risks of hypothermia and hypoglycaemia post anaesthesia.\n\nOxygen should be provided during all anaesthetics, usually via a small facemask (see Fig. 4 .8). Where oral access is required, the end of the anaesthetic circuit may be held adjacent to the nares (Fig. 4.10 ) or a small nasal catheter used to administer oxygen.\n\nChinchilla anaesthesia is monitored as for other small mammal species. The toe pinch withdrawal is the most reliable tool for monitoring depth of anaesthesia. The eyes should be coated with ocular lubricant (for example, liquid paraffin) to protect them from trauma, particularly when ketamine combinations are used, which result in open eyelids. During recovery, a soft surface, such as a towel, should cover food or bedding material that may be irritant to the eyes.\n\nSupplemental heat should be provided during anaesthesia and in the recovery period until the patient is able to thermoregulate. It is useful to monitor body temperature using a well-lubricated rectal thermometer until the patient is mobile enough to move away from a heat source.\n\nUnless a very brief gaseous anaesthesia has been performed, fluids are administered at the time of anaesthesia to support the circulation. Warmed fluids are usually administered subcutaneously; the intraperitoneal route can also be used.\n\nIf the chinchilla may be in discomfort, analgesia should be administered. Pain is likely to cause anorexia and result in ileus. Nutritional support is provided with prokinetics (see Table 2 .3) and syringe feeds (see Table 4 .2) as for other small mammals. As soon as the chinchilla has recovered sufficiently, good-quality hay is provided to encourage a return to normal appetite.\n\nMost techniques used in guinea pigs and chinchillas are appropriate for degus (see Fig. 4 .3), such as venepuncture, as are doses for drugs and other treatments (Johnson-Delaney, 2002).\n\nPneumonia is commonly seen in pet degus (Donnelly, 2004b) . Primary respiratory tract neoplasia has also been reported (Anderson et al., 1990) . \n\nThe degu is a herbivorous hind-gut fermentor. In the wild, they eat grass, leaves, bark, herbs, seeds, fruits, fresh cattle or horse droppings, and crops. Captive animals eat rodent chow, grass hay and occasional fresh greens. Inappropriate diets may lead to obesity (Donnelly, 2004b) or predispose to dental disease. Hepatocellular carninomas have been reported (Montali, 1980; Murphy et al., 1980) .\n\nDegus do not require much water, but should have water available ad libitum (Donnelly, 2004b) .\n\nAmyloidosis of Langerhans islets may lead to diabetes mellitus in degus. This may be associated with certain viral infections or hyperglycaemia due to an inappropriate diet (Fox and Murphy, 1979; Najecki and Tate, 1999; Spear et al., 1984) . Blood glucose levels should be closely monitored in these animals before and during anaesthesia, and in the recovery period. Intravenous dextrose can be administered if required.\n\nThe easiest option for anaesthesia of degus is complete inhalational anaesthesia (see Table 4 .5). This is relatively safe and good for short, minor procedures, such as oral examination, phlebotomy and radiography. It is less useful for dental treatment or surgery on the head (which may interfere with facemask positioning).\n\nFor these latter procedures, injectable agents should be used as in the other hystricomorphs (see Tables 4.4 and 4.6). Options include sedation with midazolam, and anaesthesia with ketamine combinations (acepromazine, diazepam, or medetomidine). The degu should be accurately weighed on digital scales (see Fig. 1 .9) to reduce the risk of overdose."}
