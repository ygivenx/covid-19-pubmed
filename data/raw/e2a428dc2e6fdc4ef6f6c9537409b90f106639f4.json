{"title": "A Disease Around the Corner", "body": "possible outbreak of DF in Korea by comparison of characteristics of dengue cases with those of Japan. In this study, the authors conducted a comparative observation of the epidemiological characteristics and risk factors of DF between Korea and Japan during 2006 to 2010. To compare the epidemiological characteristics of dengue cases imported by travelers or immigration in both Korea and Japan, the authors concentrated on dengue incidence and related risk factors. During 2006e2010, 367 and 589 imported dengue cases were reported in Korea and Japan, respectively. In Korea, the presumptive origins for the dengue infections were Southeast Asia (82.6%), Southern Asia (13.9%), Eastern Asia (1.1%), South America (0.3%), Central America (0.3%), Africa (0.3%), and other countries (1.6%). In Japan, the origins of the infections were Southeast Asia (69.8%), Southern Asia (20.0%), Eastern Asia (1.7%), South America (2.5%), Central America (1.2%), Africa (1.2%), Oceania (2.4%), and other countries (1.2%). In both countries, more dengue cases were reported for men than for women (p < 0.01), and those aged 20 to 30 years accounted for more than 60% of the total number of cases. The frequency of imported cases in summer and autumn (approximately 70% of total cases) was similar in both countries because of vacation season [13] .\n\nThe authors show that there is a similar pattern of imported dengue cases in Korea and Japan. Accordingly, it leads to a conclusion that there is a risk of an autochthonous dengue outbreak in Korea in the near future, similar to the outbreak that occurred in Japan in 2014.\n\nThe authors present an important perspective on an emerging infectious disease in Korea. We expect a further study with mathematical model once an index case is introduced in the Korean population and transmits the disease to neighbors, so that it can lead to an estimated number of casualties of the outbreak, and thus provide invaluable information to public health policymakers."}
