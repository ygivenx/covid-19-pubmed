{"title": "Evaluation of multiple commercial molecular and conventional diagnostic assays for the detection of respiratory viruses in children", "body": "Acute viral respiratory tract infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children, particularly those with compromised immune systems [1] [2] [3] . Nucleic acid amplification tests have shown their superiority over classical diagnostic methods, such as direct fluorescent antibody detection (DFA) and viral isolation, in identifying a broader range of viruses, with higher sensitivity and specificity [4] [5] [6] . Recently, several studies have demonstrated the advantages of multiplex PCR for simultaneous detection of a panel of viruses in one assay [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In this study we compared (i) the sensitivity and specificity of four commercial multiplex PCR assays with DFA and viral isolation for detection of respiratory viruses in children, and (ii) the sensitivity of two assays, Resplex II Plus PRE and Seeplex Influenza A/B Subtyping, with the Astra influenza Screen & Type assay and DFA for detection of H1 and H3 seasonal and pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus.\n\nMultiplex assays. Seven hundred and fifty nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were selected from children (birth to 17 years) with suspected respiratory tract infection seen at The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada). The first 25 specimens received each week for a 24-week period (November 2007 to April 2008), were selected, for a total of 600 specimens, without knowing results of DFA or viral isolation. An additional 150 specimens were chosen in the same manner (January 2009 to March 2009). Nasopharyngeal swabs (flocked swabs; COPAN Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA) were inoculated into 3 mL of Universal Transport Medium (UTM-RT COPAN Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA). After vortexing, specimens from 2007/2008 (n = 600) were dispensed into four 400-lL aliquots and stored at )80\u00b0C until nucleic acid extraction, whereas specimens from 2009 (n = 150) were submitted to nucleic acid extraction before aliquoting and freezing at )80\u00b0C.\n\nSpecimen selection for comparison of assays to detect seasonal influenza A and pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza. A total of 130 NP swab specimens were selected from aliquots of the original specimens frozen at )80\u00b0C on receipt: 75 influenza A positive specimens by Astra Screen and Type assay (13 seasonal influenza A (INFA)-H1, 12 INFA-H3 and 50 pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A (INFA)-H1N1), and 55 influenza A/B negative specimens by the Astra assay. All specimens were made anonymous and de-linked from all personal health identifiers.\n\nDFA was performed using fluorophore-labelled monoclonal antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (PIV), adenovirus (ADV), INFA/B (SimulFluor \u00d2 ; Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (Diagnostic HYBRIDS, Athens, OH, USA). DFA was carried out for each target as per the manufacturer's protocol. Amplification products were detected using the LiquiChip 200 (Luminex 200) (Austin, TX, USA) for Resplex II v2.0, and the Luminex 100 for RVP and RVP Fast. Qiagen instructs each user to determine appropriate cut-off values for their testing platform and patient population. Cut-off values for Resplex II v2.0 were determined empirically to be the sum of the mean MFI plus \u20215 times the standard deviation of negative specimens (negative in all assays). The cut-off values for RVP and RVP Fast were predetermined by the manufacturer. Each assay had an internal control (IC) included to rule out PCR inhibition. Table 1 shows the targets and characteristics of each multiplex assay.\n\nTo detect amplification products, the Seeplex RV15 assay was coupled with capillary electrophoresis technology (Lab901Screen Tape system; Lab901 Ltd, Loanhead, UK). \n\nTrue positive. For all targets except PIV4, BoV, coronaviruses, enterovirus and rhinovirus, any positive viral culture or a positive result for a single target from any two of DFA and the four molecular assays was considered true positive. Because PIV4, BoV, coronaviruses, enterovirus and rhinovirus could not be detected by DFA or viral isolation, a true positive for these agents was defined as a positive result in at least two of the three or four multiplex PCR assays. \n\nDistribution of respiratory viruses. Virus isolation was performed on 684 specimens. Of 750 specimens tested, 502 (66.9%) were considered true positive results for at least one virus by DFA, culture or PCR; 288/750 (38.4%) specimens were positive by DFA or viral isolation, while an additional 214 (28.5%) were positive by multiplex PCR. A single virus was detected in 420 specimens (83.7%), two viruses in 77 (15.3%), three in four specimens (0.8%) and four viruses in one (0.2%). Table 2 shows the overall distribution of respiratory viral pathogens, indicating the predominance of enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, influenza viruses and RSV. It also shows that parainfluenza viruses, hMPV and coronaviruses accounted for about 7% each, followed by bocavirus and adenovirus at around 4% each. Among dual infections (n = 77) entero/rhinoviruses were most commonly associated with other viruses. Triple virusinfected specimens included ADV + enterovirus/rhinovirus + BoV (n = 1), PIV4 + ADV + enterovirus/rhinovirus (n = 1), RSVB + NL63 + BoV (n = 1) and RSVB + PIV4 + enterovirus/rhinovirus (n = 1). The unique quadruple-agent infected specimen was PIV3 + NL63 + enterovirus/rhinovirus + BoV (n = 1).\n\nComparison of sensitivity and specificity among assays. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each target and assay according to our definition of a true and false positive (Tables 3 and 4) . Some viral targets were lumped together as necessary to perform a sensitivity and specificity analysis (i.e. entero/rhinovirus, coronaviruses). Table 3 indicates that DFA and culture were, as expected, less sensitive than PCR for most targets. However, DFA was more sensitive than PCR for a small number of specific targets and assays (i. Among all the multiplex assays tested, Seeplex RV15 was the most sensitive for detecting all targets except for enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. All multiplex assays had good sensitivity for the detection of influenza A (93.7-98.4%). Influenza B sensitivity was good in all multiplex assays (100%) except for RVP Fast (64.9%). The superior performance of Seeplex RV15 for RSV (100% sensitivity) reflected strong performance for both RSVA and RSVB, whereas the decreased sensitivity of other assays reflected a weaker performance for either target (i.e. Resplex II v2.0: RSVA 90.4%, RSVB 79.3%, and RVP: RSVA 85.5%, RSVB 98.3%). Similarly, variability in the sensitivity of individual targets of the four parainfluenza viruses resulted in variation in the overall sensitivity. Again, Seeplex RV15 showed good sensitivity for all four types (85.7-100%), while Resplex II v2.0 had reduced sensitivity for PIV4 (60%), RVP had reduced sensitivity for PIV1 (71.4%) and 3 (71.4%), and RVP Fast had reduced sensitivity for PIV1 (46.7%), 2 (77.8%) and 3 (42.8%). Sensitivity for detecting hMPV was good for Seeplex RV15, RVP and RVP Fast (92.3-97.4%), and acceptable for Resplex II v2.0 (82%). However, performance for adenovirus, an important respiratory pathogen, was very variable, ranging from 52.4% (RVP Fast) to 100% (Seeplex RV15), probably reflecting the variation in serotype coverage among the assays.\n\nOf the additional viral agents tested in the multiplex assays, the coronaviruses were consistently detected across all assays except for CoV OC43 by RVP (53.8%) and CoV HKU1 by RVP Fast (16.7%). Seeplex RV15 and RVP Fast detected 100% of bocavirus infections, while the sensitivity of Resplex II v2.0 was only 75%. Detection of enterovirus and rhinovirus was the most inconsistent. Although the specific targets for each multiplex assay are proprietary, it is known that the highly conserved regions of the 5\u00a2NTR region of either rhinoviruses or enteroviruses, will also amplify members of the other genus. Thus, some assays, such as the RVP and RVP Fast assays, have combined the enterovirus and rhinovirus targets, because developing specific targets for each genus outside of the 5\u00a2NTR region may compromise sensitivity of detection, especially of the rhinoviruses. This is possibly the case with the Seeplex RV15 assay, which separates enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, but has a lower sensitivity than the other assays. Though the Resplex II v2.0 assay differentiates between enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, the occurrence of 38.4% of positive specimens testing positive for both targets, suggests that there may be cross-reactivity between them.\n\nSpecificity was excellent for all assays, using our composite reference standard. Without using individual single-plex assays to adjudicate the single test positives, we cannot determine whether the slightly lower specificity observed for a few targets in several assays was due to higher sensitivity of detection or detection of false positives.\n\nMultiplexed respiratory panels provide clinicians with more diagnostic and treatment information for managing patients. In the case of influenza A, knowledge of the subtype is important with respect to predicting the activity of antiviral agents such as the adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. In addition to increased sensitivity and number of viruses detected, multiplex assays permit the improved identification of cases of infection with multiple agents, which may be clinically significant, especially in immune compromised individuals. In our study, we found that two or more viruses were present in 10.9% of specimens (16.3% of positive specimens). Bocavirus and coronaviruses were the viruses most commonly associated with multiple agent infection, followed by human metapneumovirus, the parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus and the entero/rhinoviruses. Influenza A/B and RSV were the least likely to be detected in the presence of another virus. The role of multiple viral agents in affecting the clinical course of disease is at present unknown and worthy of further study. With respect to the technical performance of the different multiplex assays, the following issues were identified: Seeplex RV15 was designed as a two-step RT-PCR format necessitating a separate RT (cDNA) assay, though a new one-step procedure has been developed. It was the only assay that required three PCR master mixes with five targets in each one plus the internal control. It was also the only assay that incorporated positive controls for all 15 viral targets, which is considered an additional quality control feature of the assay. Seeplex RV15 was the assay with the shortest post-PCR step, especially for a small number of specimens when using the Lab 901 Screen Tape \u00d2 system (maximum five specimens per run). In contrast, the Resplex II v2.0, RVP and RVP Fast use a 96-well microtitre plate format on the Luminex platform, permitting high throughput analysis.\n\nPractical considerations in most laboratories regarding the feasibility and the direct and indirect costs of introducing multiplex molecular testing for respiratory viruses have led to a relatively slow routine implementation of this methodology. Mahony et al. [15] have shown that RVP employed as the first-line diagnostic tool in children was the least costly strategy, compared with DFA and culture, DFA alone or DFA plus RVP, when the prevalence of infection was \u202111%. The cost of molecular testing is offset by its more efficient use of labour than conventional DFA and culture and by savings to the healthcare system when additional testing and hospitalization can be avoided by knowledge of a test result with high sensitivity and specificity. Operationally, molecular methods also allow virology laboratories to continue to function, even in the event that viral culture cannot be carried out due to biosafety issues.\n\nIn our study, newer assays or versions of the multiplex assays (Resplex II Plus Panel PRE (21 targets) and Seeplex Influenza A/B Subtyping (six targets)) showed good sensitivity and specificity relative to a tri-plex influenza real-time RT-PCR (Astra influenza Screen & Type) for pandemic H1N1 2009 INFA virus detection. This is important, as traditional seasonal H1 subtyping molecular assays will not react with the pandemic strain and it is expected that the 2009 pandemic strain may become the predominant circulating seasonal H1 strain in the immediate post-pandemic period.\n\nWe have shown that multiplex PCR increases the sensitivity of detection of respiratory viruses in children by 74.3% over DFA and viral isolation, while maintaining excellent specificity. However, it will be important to develop more effective clinical and laboratory algorithms for their timely and optimal use and to study their impact on patient care in different populations in different clinical settings. Influenza, RSV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and hMPV have been well established as leading causes of respiratory infection among infants and children [16] [17] [18] . However, the role of rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, bocavirus and coronaviruses as copathogens in upper respiratory tract infection or as agents of lower respiratory tract infection, has been less well investigated, and will be aided by studies using this technology [19] ."}
