{"title": "Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of several ring-contracted amantadine analogs", "body": "1-Adamantylamine (amantadine) and (a-methyl-1-adamantyl)methylamine (rimantadine) have prophylactic and therapeutic activity in influenza A virus infections. 1 Related adamantane derivatives also show antiviral activity. 2 Adamantane derivatives are inexpensive, but resistance against the drugs develops readily and treatment is frequently complicated by central nervous system (CNS) side-effects. In fact, amantadine and its 3,5-dimethyl analogue memantine are NMDA receptor antagonists and are approved for the treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. 3 Thus, the design of new amantadine-related antiinfluenza agents without CNS side-effects is a highly desirable goal. Amantadine, rimantadine, memantine, and related polycyclic amines also possess trypanocidal activity (Fig. 1 ). 4 Biological activity has also been found in other polycyclic cage amines. For example, compounds 1\u00c04 have anti-influenza activ-ity, 5 5 is a MAO-B inhibitor, 6 and 6 is a NMDA receptor antagonist (Fig. 2) . 7 For more than 20 years two of us (P.C. and S.V.) have worked on a project aimed at exploring the structure and the reactivity of noradamantane 8 and bisnoradamantane derivatives. 9 Up to now, our work on this topic has been done from a purely synthetic point of view. For example, we have developed several general entries to these skeletons. However, systematic studies directed towards the synthesis of biologically active noradamantane and bisnoradamantane derivatives have not yet been carried out (Fig. 3) It is well known in medicinal chemistry that when drugs contain cyclic systems, it is generally worth synthesizing analogues where the ring is opened, expanded or contracted by one unit, because these analogues show similar activity to the parent compound. 11 Tricyclo[3.3.1.0 3, 7 ] non-3-ylamine [(3-noradamantyl)amine] and tricyclo[3.3.0.0 3,7 ]oct-1-ylamine [ (1-bisnoradamantyl) amine] may be viewed as ring contracted analogs of amantadine, featuring a skeleton with one and two carbon less than the model, respectively. For this reason, in this paper, we describe the preparation of a series of (3-noradamantyl)amines, (1-bisnoradamantyl) amines and related compounds as well as the results of their antiviral, trypanocidal, NMDA receptor antagonist, and dopamine reuptake inhibitory activities.\n\nStarting from the known amine 7, 10, 12 we have prepared noradamantane amines 8\u00c012 using classical methods in amine chemistry. Thus, reductive alkylation of 7 with several aromatic aldehydes afforded secondary amines 8a-f in moderate to high yields. Dimethylated derivative 10 was prepared as previously described in the literature. 13 Monomethyl derivative 12 was synthesized from 8a by reductive alkylation followed by catalytic debenzylation in good overall yield. Finally, piperidine derivative 11 was prepared by alkylation of primary amine 7 with 1,5-dibromopentane in 51% yield (Scheme 1).\n\nStarting from the known amide 13, 14 a series of 3-(noradamantyl)methylamines were synthesized. Thus, reduction of amide 13 with LiAlH 4 followed by acidic work-up led to the hydrochloride of amine 14 in 90% yield. Reductive alkylation of 14 with benzaldehyde and NaCNBH 3 in methanol gave 15 in 77% yield. Reductive methylation of 15 followed by catalytic hydrogenation led to 19 in high yield. Reductive methylation of 14 with formic acid and formaldehyde furnished dimethyl derivative 17 in 68% yield. Finally, reaction of 14 with 1H-pyrazol-1-carboxamidine led to guanidine 18 in 84% yield (Scheme 2).\n\nOn the other hand, starting from the known acid 20, 9g we have prepared amines 21\u00c023, 25\u00c028, and 30\u00c036 using classical methods in amine chemistry. Although the synthesis of amine 21 from acid 20 was very low yielding using the classical Schmid's or Curtius' reactions (14% and 24% yield, respectively), application of the Yamada's modification of the Curtius reaction allowed us to obtain and fully characterize the hydrochloride of amine 21 in 73% yield.\n\nFrom this amine, reductive alkylation with benzaldehyde led to 22a in 60% yield. Similarly, reductive alkylation with 2-thiophenecarbaldehyde led to 22b in 69% yield. Reductive methylation of 22a followed by catalytic debenzylation furnished secondary amine 28 in high yield. Dimethylated derivative 26 was obtained in 83% yield by treating amine 21 with excess of formic acid and formaldehyde. Finally, dibenzylated compound 27 was prepared by double alkylation of 21 with benzyl chloride in 73% yield (Scheme 3). Moreover, reaction of 20 with methyllithium gave ketone 24 in low yield. Reaction of 24 with hydroxylamine followed by reduction of the obtained oxime with LiAlH 4 gave amine 25, a compound that can be viewed as a ring contracted analog of the antiviral rimantadine (Scheme 3).\n\nFinally, reduction of the amide 29, easily available from acid 20, with LiAlH 4 followed by acidic work-up gave the hydrochloride of amine 30 in 70% overall yield. Following a similar sequence of the previously used with amine 21, amines 31, 32, 33, and 36 were obtained in high yields. Piperidine derivative 34 was obtained by alkylation of amine 30 with 1,5-dibromopentane in 53% yield. Finally, reaction of 30 with 1H-pyrazol-1-carboxamidine led to guanidine 35 in 90% yield (Scheme 4).\n\nThe structure of all new compounds was confirmed by elemental analysis or accurate mass measurement, IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and mass spectral data.\n\nThe tsetse fly-transmitted protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). After a major upsurge of the disease in the late 1990s throughout many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, annual infections have now fallen to 70,000 as a result of major surveillance and treatment programmes. 15 However, over 60 million people remain at risk, and in some areas death rates exceed those from HIV/AIDS and malaria. The drugs currently available to treat HAT require administration under medical supervision and are characterized by limited effi-cacy, toxicity, and resistance. For example, the arsenical drug melarsoprol, which is used to treat late stage disease, can result in a reactive encephalopathy which kills up to 10% of patients. In the absence of treatment, HAT is invariably fatal and new drugs are therefore urgently required. Recently, it was reported that the anti-influenza virus drug rimantadine was active in vitro against bloodstream form T. brucei, and that other aminoadamantane derivatives had enhanced activity. 4, 16 To extend these observations, we have tested several new bisnoradamantanes and related compounds for activity against bloodstream form T. brucei.\n\nThe noradamantylamines and [(3-noradamantyl)methyl]amines described in this paper and the birnoradamantyl derivatives 21, 22a, 23, 27, 28, 32, 34, and 36 were found to have no significant activity against cultured bloodstream from T. brucei at concentrations up to 5 lg mL \u00c01 . Compounds 26, 30, and 31 showed transient effect on growth at 5 lg mL \u00c01 , but cells grew to normal density. Rimantadine analog 25 was the most active of the compounds tested and we established its IC 50 (6.02 \u00b1 0.36 lM) and IC 90 (9.48 \u00b1 2.64 lM) values. Amine 25 was found to be slightly more active than rimantadine (IC 50 = 7.04 \u00b1 0.12 lM; IC 90 = 13.97 \u00b1 1.68 lM) and at least 20 times more active than amantadine (IC 50 > 130 lM).\n\nNMDA receptor antagonists are highly interesting compounds since these receptors have been involved in several neurodegenerative disorders. In fact, memantine is widely used in therapeutics to slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease. 17 The activity of the different new polycyclic compounds was assayed on cerebellar granule neurons loaded with the calcium-sensitive probe Fura-2. 18 Addition of glutamate or NMDA (100 lM) in the presence of glycine (10 lM) produced a robust and stable increase in intracellular calcium that was challenged with cumulative additions of the compounds to be tested. Although all the noradamantyl derivatives and several of the bisnoradamantyl compounds were able to inhibit calcium entry through NMDA receptors, none of the compounds was more potent than memantine against glutamate-or NMDA-induced calcium increase in cerebellar granule neurons (Table 1 ).\n\nIn general, the bisnoradamantane derivatives are more potent as NMDA receptor antagonists than the noradamantane amines. For example, amine 21 is 4 times more potent as NMDA receptor antagonist than 3-noradamantylamine, 7, and the guanidine derivative 35 is 3.5 times more potent than its corresponding noradamantyl analog, 18.\n\nBisnoradamantylamines were usually more active than their corresponding (bisnoradamantyl)methylamine analogs as exemplified by the pairs 21/30, 26/33, and 28/36, and alkyl substitution causes a reduction in the potency (e.g., series 21/28/26 or 30/36/ 33). The guanidine derivative 35 was the more potent compound, being 10 times more potent than amantadine and 5 times less potent than memantine. Attempts to synthesize a guanidine derivative from 21 were not successful.\n\nNone of the synthesized compounds was found to have antiviral activity against the enveloped DNA viruses herpes simplex virus (type 1 or type 2) or vaccinia virus; the enveloped RNA viruses fe-line coronavirus, parainfluenza-3 virus, respiratory syncytial virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, sindbis virus, or Punta Toro virus; or the non-enveloped RNA viruses Coxsackievirus B4 and Reovirus-1. In the influenza virus assays, only compounds 7 and 14, two primary amines, displayed reasonable activity against the influenza A/ H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtypes, secondary and tertiary amines were not active ( Table 2 ). The antiviral data obtained by microscopy were confirmed by a colorimetric cell viability assay (data not shown). The highest selectivity was noted with compound 7 tested against the A/H3N2 subtype. As anticipated, all compounds proved to be inactive against influenza B virus, which is known to be insensitive to amantadine and rimantadine.\n\nIt is known that amantadine increases extracellular dopamine levels by antagonism of the NMDA receptor, 19 although the exact mechanism has not been fully elucidated. As several of our new amines showed NMDA receptor antagonist activity with IC 50 similar or even lower than amantadine, we have determined their effect on [ 3 H]dopamine uptake in rat striatal synaptosomes (Table   3 ). At the concentration tested (100 lM), several of the compounds were able to inhibit [ 3 H]dopamine uptake in some manner, show- ing similar values of inhibition than amantadine or memantine. However, it seems that no correlation exists with their potency as antagonists at the NMDA receptor. Probably, other mechanisms are being involved in the regulation of dopamine release, like different activities at D 2 receptors or through inhibition at the dopamine transporter.\n\nIn summary, we have synthesized and fully characterized several (3-noradamantyl)amines, (3-noradamantyl)methylamines, (3-bisnoradamantyl)amines, and (3-bisnoradamantyl)methylamines. Although these compounds were less potent than memantine against NMDA-induced calcium increase in cerebellar granule neurons, several compounds were more potent than amantadine, the bisnoradamantane amines being more potent than the corresponding noradamantane amines. Interestingly, none of those compounds showed antiviral activity, while compound 14, that displayed reasonable activity against the influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtypes, showed no NMDA receptor antagonist activity. Moreover, none of the compounds were significantly more potent, at the tested concentration, than amantadine or memantine as inhibitors of the dopamine uptake.\n\nAmantadine displays both anti-influenza activity and NMDA receptor antagonism. As selectivity is usually highly desirable in drugs, the amines herein reported open the way for the design of new aminopolycyclic compounds with selective anti-influenza or NMDA receptor antagonist activity.\n\nInterestingly, amine 25, that is 2.5 times more potent than amantadine as NMDA receptor antagonist, also displayed trypanocidal activity, being slightly more active than rimantadine and at least 21 times more active than amantadine.\n\nGuanidine 35 is a polycyclic cage compound with selective NMDA receptor antagonist activity (IC 50 = 7.1 lM) without antiviral and trypanocidal activities. The synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of more polycyclic cage amines is in progress to reach more potent and selective derivatives.\n\nMelting points were determined in open capillary tubes. Unless otherwise stated, NMR spectra were recorded in CD 3 OD in the following spectrometers: 1 H NMR (500 MHz), 13 C NMR (100.6 MHz). Chemical shifts (d) are reported in ppm related to internal tetramethylsilane (TMS). Assignments given for the NMR spectra are based on DEPT, COSY 1 H/ 1 H, and HETCOR 1 H/ 13 C (HSQC and HMBC sequences for one bond and long range 1 H/ 13 C heterocorrelations, respectively) and NOESY experiments for selected compounds. For the MS and GC/MS analyses the sample was introduced directly or through a gas chromatograph. For GC/MS analyses a 30-m column [5% diphenyl-95% dimethylpolysiloxane, conditions: 10 psi, initial temperature: 35\u00b0C (2 min), then heating at a range of 8\u00b0C/min till 300\u00b0C, then isothermic at 300\u00b0C] was used. The electron impact (70 eV) or chemical ionization (CH 4 ) techniques were used. Only significant ions are given: those with higher relative ratio, except for the ions with higher m/z values. Accurate mass measurements were obtained using ESI technic. Absorption values in the IR spectra (KBr) are given as wave-numbers (cm \u00c01 ).
