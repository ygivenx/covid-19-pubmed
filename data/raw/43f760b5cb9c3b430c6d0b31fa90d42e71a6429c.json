We 22 estimated R0 at 3.6 (95% CI, 3.2, 4.2) (generalized growth model) and at 3.58 (95% CI, 1.29, 8.46 .

Since the first two cases were 28 confirmed on February 19, 2020, a total of 593 cases have been reported as of February 29 (2). The virus 29 appears to be spreading rapidly with cases reported among the elite (3). One model estimated that 18,300 30 (95% CI, 3,770 to 53,470) cases would have had occurred by February 24 (4). The Iranian authorities 31 have adopted social distancing measures to slow disease transmission (5). As the epidemic continues, our 32 results call for efforts to minimize COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. 33\n\nTo confront the epidemic, we are interested in evaluating the transmission potential of COVID-19 34 to facilitate outbreak response efforts including the scope and intensity of interventions. The basic 35 reproduction number, R0, represents such a measurement indicating the average number of secondary 36 cases that primary cases generate in a completely susceptible population in the absence of interventions or 37 behavioral changes. R0>1 indicated the possibility of sustained transmission, whereas R0<1 implies that 38 transmission chains cannot sustain epidemic growth. As the epidemic continues its course, the effective 39 reproduction number offers a time-dependent record of the average number of secondary cases per case as 40 the number of susceptible individuals gets depleted and control interventions takes effect. Herein we 41 employed two different methods to quantify the reproduction number using the curve of reported COVID-42 19 cases. 43\n\nUsing a Wikipedia entry as a starting point, Farsi-speaking coauthor SFR double-checked the data 44 of daily reported new cases, from February 19 through 29, 2020, using Iranian official press releases and 45 other credible news sources, and corrected the data as per the official data. Two methods were utilized to 46 estimate the reproduction number. The first method utilized a generalized growth model (GGM) (6) with 47 the growth rate and its scaling factor to characterize the daily reported incidence, followed by simulation 48 of the calibrated GGM, using a discretized probability distribution of the serial interval and assuming a 49\n\nPoisson error structure. See Technical Appendix for detailed description of data and Method 1. 50\n\nThe second method for estimating the reproduction number is based on the calculation of the 51 epidemic's doubling times, which correspond to the times when the cumulative incidence doubles.

To quantify 53 parameter uncertainty, we used parametric bootstrapping with a Poisson error structure around the 54 number of new reported cases in order to derive 95% confidence intervals of our estimates. Assuming 55 exponential growth, the epidemic growth rate is equal to ln(2)/doubling time. Assuming that the pre-56 infectious and infectious periods follow an exponential distribution, R0 is approximately equal to 1 + 57 growth rate \u00d7 serial interval. 58\n\nIn both methods, the serial interval was assumed to follow a gamma distribution (mean: 4.41 59 days; standard deviation: 3.17 days) (7, 8). MATLAB version R2019b and R version 3.6.2 were used for 60 data analyses and creating figures. It was determined a priori that \u03b1= 0.05. 61\n\nUsing Method 1, we estimated a reproduction number of 3.6 (95% CI, 3.2, 4.2) for the COVID-62 19 epidemic in Iran. We estimated a growth rate of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.69, 1) and a scaling parameter of 0.89 63 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.95). The latter indicated a near-exponential growth of the epidemic (Figure) . Using 64\n\nMethod 2, we found that from February 19 through February 29, the cumulative incidence of confirmed 65 cases in Iran had doubled 8 times. The estimated epidemic doubling time is 1.20 (95% CI, 1.05, 1.44) 66 days and the corresponding R0 estimate is 3.58 (95% CI, 1.29, 8.46). 67\n\nOur study has limitations. First, it is based on the number of daily reported cases whereas it 68 would be ideal to analyze case counts by date of symptom onset that are unavailable. Second, case counts 69 could be underreported due to underdiagnosis, given subclinical or asymptomatic cases. The rapid 70 increase in case count might represent a belated realization of the severity of the epidemic and a rapid 71 process of catching up with testing many suspected cases. If the reporting ratio remains constant over the 72 study period, and given the near-exponential growth of the epidemic's trajectory, our estimates would 73 remain reliable; however, this is a strong assumption. Third, while data are not stratified according to 74\n\nimported and local cases, we assumed that they were infected locally, as it is likely that transmission has 75 been ongoing in Iran for some time (4). 76\n\n.

Our mean estimate is at 3.6, which means that on average 3.6 susceptible 78 individuals would be infected by one infectious individual. An epidemic trajectory of near-exponential 79 growth raises serious concern. Our estimates provide further evidence that the epidemic situation in Iran 80 is dire. Social distancing measures and prompt healthcare delivery need to be implemented swiftly. 81 CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.08.20030643 doi: medRxiv preprint Figure.

This model characterizes the growth profile via two parameters: the growth rate parameter ( ) and the 21 scaling of the growth rate parameter ( ). The model captures diverse epidemic profiles ranging from 22 constant incidence ( = 0), sub-exponential or polynomial growth (0 < < 1), and exponential growth 23 ( = 1) (1). The serial interval is assumed to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.41 days and a 24 standard deviation of 3.17 days based on recent reports (2, 3). 25\n\nNext, to estimate the most recent estimate of Rt, we simulate the progression of incident reported cases from 26 the calibrated GGM, and apply the discretized probability distribution ( ) of the serial interval using the 27 renewal equation (4-6) given by 28\n\n. 29\n\nIn the renewal equation we denote the total incidence at calendar time by . Here, the denominator 30 represents the total number of cases that contribute to the incidence cases at time . Next, we estimate 31 from 300 simulated curves assuming a Poisson error structure to derive the uncertainty bounds around 32 our estimate of the reproduction number (7). 33\n\nWe ran simulation to generate 10,000 sets of estimates of epidemic doubling times for a given time series 35 of cumulative number of reported cases, and to compute the arithmetic mean of each set. Then, the harmonic 36 mean of these estimates was calculated across 10,000 sets of simulations and was reported as our estimated 37 epidemic doubling time, with 95% confidence interval (Table S2) . 38\n\nNext, we drew 10,000 random values for the serial interval from a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.41 39 .

We generate 10,000 values for the reproduction number 40 by calculating the reproduction number for each pair of values (arithmetic mean of epidemic doubling time 41 and serial interval respectively) following the equation as in Vynnycky and White (8), Table 4 .1, Equation 42 4.14: 43\n\nReproduction number = 1 + growth rate \u00d7 serial interval 44\n\nWe reported the mean and 95% of the 10,000 estimated values of the reproduction number (Table S2) . 45\n\nIn addition to estimating the reproduction number of COVID-19 across Iran, we further analyzed the data 47\n\nfor Region 1 and Region 3 of Iran, which happened to have higher numbers of cumulative number of cases For Region 1, using Method 1, we estimated a reproduction number of 3.6 (95% CI: 3.1, 4.4) with a growth 54 rate of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.89) and a scaling parameter of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.99). Using Method 2, 55 the estimated epidemic doubling time was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.10, 1.61) and the estimated reproduction number 56 was 3.40 (95% CI, 1.27, 7.91) ( It appeared that whether it was for Iran as a whole, or for its Region 1 or Region 3, the point estimate of the 62 .
