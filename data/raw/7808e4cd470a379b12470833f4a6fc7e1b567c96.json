ASFV was firstly discovered in Kenya in 49 1921 6 . It remained restricted in Africa till 1957, when it was reported in 50 Spain and Portugal. Up to now, the virus has caused ASF outbreaks in 51 more than fifty countries in Africa, Europe, Asia, and South America 4 . 52 The latest reports showed that the virus has caused outbreaks in more 53 than fifteen provinces in China 7,8 . Because of the high lethality of ASFV 54 in domestic pigs, the most commonly used strategies to control the virus 55 were the massive culling campaigns and the restriction of pig movement 5 . 56 Both strategies have resulted in a huge economic loss for pig industry and 57 affected people's livelihoods. Unfortunately, currently there is no 58 available effective vaccine against ASFVs. 59 60 Many efforts have been devoted to developing the vaccine for the ASFV 61 1,5,9-11 , however, most of these attempts failed. One of the most important 62 reasons was the complex composition of the antigenic proteins 5,12 . 63 Previous reports showed that p72, p30, and p54 were the three important 64 antigenic proteins during the infection of ASFVs, but the immunity 65 against them could only provide a partial protection 12, 13 .

Therefore, it is necessary to 68 understand the mechanisms of the antigen diversity of the ASFV virus 1 . 69 \n\nThe genetic diversity of ASFVs has been investigated in many studies. 71 The ASFV genome encodes over 150 proteins, including viral enzymes, Figure 1A ), suggesting the dynamic changes of the viral genomes. Figure S1 ) in most cases. For example, 123 there were 31,833 bp differences between virus Mkuzi79 and BA71V, 78% 124 of which were caused by indels. 125 The size and position of indels in ASFV genomes were also analyzed. 70% 126 of indels were no longer than 10 bp, and about 10% of indels were 50 bp 127 or longer ( Figure S2 ).The occurrence of indels was much more frequent 128 in both ends of the genome, especially in the 5' end ( Figure 1C ). Besides, 129 the size of indels in both ends was also much larger than that in the 130 middle region. Large indels with over 50 bp (above the blue line in Figure   131 1C) were mostly observed in both ends. It should be noted that the 132 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Thirty-one protein groups were observed to have paralogs (duplicated 202 proteins) in at least one virus (colored in Figure S6 ). They were mostly 203 located in both ends of the genome. Thirteen of them belonged to MGFs. 204 In addition, two protein groups, \"DP71L\" and \"DP96R\", belonged to the 205 class of \"Host cell interactions\". The rest protein groups belonged to 206 either the class of \"Proteins with unknown function\" or \"Hypothetical 207 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Most of the paralogs were clustered in adjacent positions. 208 Exceptions were observed for some protein groups which were encoded 209 by the first one to three thousands nucleotides in the plus and minus 210 strands, such as the protein group \"p01990-3L\" (marked with black 211 arrows in Figure S6 ). Further analysis showed that a segment of 200-3000 212 bp was exactly the same in the beginning of the plus and minus strands in 213 most viral genomes (Table S4) .
