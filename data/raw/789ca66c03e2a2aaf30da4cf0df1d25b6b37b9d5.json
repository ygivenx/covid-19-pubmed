{"title": "a systematic analysis of UK funding", "body": "Tuberculosis also represents a substantial challenge to global health, accounting for 2.2% of all-cause DALYs lost world-wide, 1 and an estimated 1.4 million deaths in 2011. 3 The target of the WHO Global TB Plan is to reduce tuberculosis deaths to half of those recorded in 1990 by 2015, but it is thought that both Europe and Africa will fail to meet these goals. Control efforts are hampered by limited vaccine effectiveness, coinfection with HIV, insufficient diagnostic capacity in low income settings, prolonged treatment courses and the emergence of drug resistant strains. 3, 4 Globally an estimated 500,000 deaths annually are attributable to influenza. 5 Viral reassortment can lead to novel strains with pandemic potential, such as H1N1pdm09 strain which emerged in Mexico in 2009 and rapidly spread worldwide. This strain remained the dominant influenza strain across Europe in 2013, and the emerging H7N9 strain provides further cause for immediate concern. 6 .\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) arose in China in 2002 and rapidly caused over 8000 cases with case fatality of almost 10%, 7 and the emergence in 2013 of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus has caused global concern. 8 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is estimated to cause each year 33 million new episodes of RSVassociated acute lower respiratory tract infection worldwide in children younger than five years; and up to an estimated 199 000 deaths per year -almost all of which are in low-income settings. 9 The variable coverage of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is well documented, 10 and measles is still responsible for considerable disease burden globally (14.8 million DALYs in 2010). 1 Amongst other infections, owing to several notable outbreaks, pertussis has received media coverage in highincome countries. 11 Respiratory infections have been implicated in the aetiology of chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma, 12 chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, 13 and cystic fibrosis, 14 as well as acting as a trigger for acute cardiovascular events. 15 UK institutions have received an estimated \u00a32.6 billion of public and charitable funding to carry out infectious disease research between 1997 and 2010, of which around one-third was designated as related to global health, 16 and according to estimates from Policy Cures, the UK ranks second globally in terms of the amount of R&D funding for infectious disease research. 17 Funding covers all types of science along the R&D value chain from pre-clinical to operational and implementation research. We report on the funding for respiratory infection-related research awarded to UK institutions. We identify areas of research strength and possible investment gaps in relation to respiratory global health that will be of relevance to policy-makers, funders and researchers, and briefly discuss how new approaches might help with allocating existing resources and identifying new sources of investment.\n\nWe analysed studies funded over a 14-year period (1997-2010 inclusive) and identified those relevant to respiratory infectious disease. Global health studies were defined as those which investigated diseases not endemic in the UK, or where the study had a clear reference to another country (e.g. tuberculosis in South Africa). The pneumonia category included pre-clinical studies for\n\nWe excluded open-access data from the pharmaceutical industry as it was limited and not representative.\n\nThe methods have been described in detail previously. 18 The overarching dataset was constructed by 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Each study was screened for relevance to infectious disease research and assigned to as many primary disease categories as appropriate. 19 Within each category, topic-specific sub-sections (including specific pathogen or disease) were documented. Studies were also allocated to one of four categories along the R&D value chain: pre-clinical; phase 1, 2, or 3; product development; and implementation and operational research. Funders were either considered in their own right, or were grouped into categories, such as in-house university funding, research charities, and government departments. A total of 26 funder categories were used. 19 This categorisation was carried out by author MGH, with provisional datasets circulated to authors for review and comment, and JRF, MKC and FBW further verified a random sample of 10% of the dataset, with author agreement measured by a Kappa score (0.95) and differences settled by consensus. We excluded studies not immediately relevant to infection, veterinary infectious disease research studies (unless there was a clear zoonotic component), and studies where there were UK collaborators, but the funding was awarded to a non-UK institution. Unfunded studies were also excluded. Grants awarded in a currency other than pounds sterling were converted to UK pounds using the mean exchange rate in the year of the award. All awards were adjusted for inflation and reported in 2010 UK pounds.\n\nWe used fold differences and statistical tests (nonparametric Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test, Ksample test and nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test) to compare total investment, number of studies, mean grant, and median grant according to specific infection, disease system, funding organisation, and cross-cutting categories. Associations between disease burden and research investment were assessed using Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho). A value greater or equal to 0.7 was considered strongly correlated, greater or equal to 0.40 and less than 0.70 was considered moderately correlated, and a value under or equal to 0.40 was considered poorly \n\nFrom a total of 325,922 studies screened, we identified 6165 studies that met the inclusion criteria with a total investment of \u00a32. 6 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y 12 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47 translating into R&D investments. The focus on influenza will also undoubtedly have been at least in part due to the highlighting of emerging strains with pandemic potential. The strong correlation between burden and investment is encouraging with, broadly, the high-burden diseases receiving greater funding (pneumonia being the key exception), and lower-burden infections less funding.\n\nWithin therapeutics research, the proportionately-greater investment for tuberculosis compared with influenza seems appropriate, as does the tuberculosis-related focus within diagnostics.\n\nNew high-impact infection threats to humans are often respiratory in nature. From SARS to influenza to Middle East respiratory syndrome, these have the potential to be highly virulent with rapid transmission and global spread, and with substantial health and economic impact. Although difficult to accurately quantify, in our dataset there was little funding for research to develop predictive epidemiological models for future pandemics -which would be an important part of infection prevention and control. However, caution must be exercised when developing these epidemiological There was limited funding for pneumococcal and pneumonia research. Whilst infections such as meningitis may be in decline in some countries due to successful introduction of new vaccines, 22 there are still many areas globally with weak health systems where pneumococcal incidence is high.\n\nThere is also evidence of respiratory infection transmission at mass gatherings, such as the Hajj. 23 In addition to providing meningococcal and influenza vaccination for travellers, there should be investment in operational research to explore health system responsiveness to emerging threats and efficient ways to provide preventive medicines, as well as measuring the effectiveness of preventive therapies. There was very little funding for translational research relating to pneumonia, a clear gap in the UK portfolio. Other vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis, which are causes of high disease burden globally, also received very limited research funding despite there clearly being the need for translational and operational research. 16 The worldwide burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis is rapidly increasing, with WHO estimates of 630,000 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis worldwide, great variation between countries, and emergence over the last decade of extensively drug-resistant cases. 24 Given the difficulties of developing a more effective vaccine, 25 the need for new diagnostics, therapeutics and targeted use of existing medicines becomes even more important. The reported resistance to antiviral drugs used to treat influenza 26 emphasises the need to for develop effective antivirals and effective vaccines. There is a paucity of research in antimicrobial resistance. 27 This is of concern, and has been highlighted by the UK Chief Medical Officer, 28, 29 with new funding for research related to antimicrobial resistance provided. 30 We believe that other funders should follow this lead. Most countries are under-investing in tuberculosis R&D 31 Our study has several limitations, which have been highlighted and discussed in detail elsewhere. 16 There was little publicly-available data from the pharmaceutical industry. Hence, there is a data gap in relation to funding of clinical trials and development of vaccines and diagnostics, which the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are financing. Beyond disease burden, other measures, such as economic burden should also be utilised when prioritising limited resources, but little information is available regarding the economic impact of respiratory infections. We rely on the original data being complete and accurate, and are unable to take into account distribution of funds from the lead institution to collaborating partners, nor can we assess quantity of each award given to overheads or the impact of the introduction of full-economic costing. Also, assigning studies to categories is a subjective and imperfect process -although we used two researchers to do this to reduce inter-observer error.
