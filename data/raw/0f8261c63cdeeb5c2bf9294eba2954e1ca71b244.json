We \n\nTo our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study to date on quantifying the relative effect of different NPIs and their timings for COVID-19 outbreak containment, based on human movement and disease data. Our findings show that NPIs, inter-city travel restrictions, social distancing and contact reductions, as well as early case detection and isolations, have substantially reduced COVID-19 transmission across China, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. Our findings contribute to improved understanding of integrated NPI measures on COVID-19 containment and can help in tailoring control strategies across contexts.\n\nGiven that effective COVID-19-specific pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines are not expected to be available for months, NPIs are essential components of the public health response to the ongoing outbreaks.\n\n.

Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are therefore essential components of the public health response to outbreaks. 1, [5] [6] [7] These include isolating ill persons, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, travel restrictions, school and workplace closures, and cancellation of mass gathering events. [5] [6] [7] These containment measures aim to reduce transmission, thereby delaying the timing and reducing the size of the epidemic peak, buying time for preparations in the healthcare system, and enabling the potential for vaccines and drugs to be used later on. 5 For example, social distancing measures have been effective in past influenza epidemics by curbing human-to-human transmission and reducing morbidity and mortality. [8] [9] [10] Three major NPIs have been taken to mitigate the spread and reduce the outbreak size of COVID-19 across China. 11, 12 First, inter-city travel bans or restrictions have been taken to prevent further seeding the virus during the\n\nChinese new year (CNY) holiday. People in China were estimated to make close to 3 billion trips over the 40-day CNY travel period from January 10 to February 18, 2020. 12,13 A cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei Province was put in place on January 23, 2020, just two days before CNY's day on January 25. However, Wuhan's lockdown is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before CNY, with around 5 million people likely leaving before the start of the travel ban, departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China. 14 Since CNY's day, travel restrictions in other provinces were also put in place across the country.\n\nThe second group of containment measures involves improving the screening, contact tracing, identification, diagnosis, isolation and reporting of suspected ill persons and confirmed cases. 11 Since January 20, particularly in Wuhan, searches for cases, diagnosis and reporting have sped up across the country.\n\n.

In Wuhan, where the largest number of infected people live, residents were required to measure and report ther temperature daily to confirm their onset, and those with mild and asymptomatic infections were also quarantined in \"Fang Cang\" hospitals, which are public spaces such as stadiums and conference centres that have been repurposed for medical care. 11 The average interval from symptom onset to laboratory confirmation has dropped from 12 days in the early stages of the outbreak to 3 days in early February, highlighting how the efficiency of disease detection and diagnosis has greatly improved. 15, 16 Third, inner-city travel and contact restrictions were implemented to reduce the risk of community transmission. This involved limiting individual social contact, using personal hygiene and protective measures when people needed to move in public, and increasing the physical distance between those who have COVID-19 and those who do not. 11 As part of these social distancing policies, Chinese government encouraged people to stay at home as much as possible, cancelled or postponed large public events and mass gatherings, and closed libraries, museums, and workplaces. 17, 18 Additionally, to fully cover the suspected incubation period of COVID-19 spread before Wuhan's lockdown, the CNY and school holidays were also extended, with the holiday end date changed from January 30 to March 10 for Hubei province, and Feb 9 for many other provinces. [19] [20] [21] The implementation of these NPIs has coincided with the rapid decline in the number of new cases across China, albeit at high economic and social costs. 15, 16 On February 17, the State Council required localities to formulate differentiated county-level measures for precise containment of the COVID-19 outbreak and the restoration of socioeconomy affected by the outbreak. 22 The timing of implementing and lifting interventions is likely to have been and continue to be important, to take advantage of the window of opportunity to save lives and minimize the economic and social impact. 23, 24 The increasing numbers of cases of COVID-19 outside China and establishment of secondary transmission in multiple places highlights its pandemic potential.

Some previous studies have preliminarily explored the lockdown of Wuhan, [25] [26] [27] travel restrictions, 28-30 airport screening, 31, 32 and the isolation of cases and contact tracing for containing virus transmission, respectively. 33, 34 The conclusions of these studies are persuasive, there are still key knowledge gaps on the effectiveness of different interventions. 15 To fully justify the preparation, implementation, or cancellation of various NPIs, policy makers across the World need evidence as to the combination and timings of each, which remains lacking.\n\nBased on near-real time human movement and disease data, here we conducted an observational and modelling study to develop a travel network-based modelling framework. We aimed to reconstruct COVID-19 spread across China and assess the effect of the three major groups of NPIs mentioned above. Given the expanding landscape of epidemics across the World, our findings contribute to improved understanding of the effect of NPI measures on COVID-19 containment and can help in tailoring control strategies across contexts.\n\nA travel network-based stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed \n\nThree population movement datasets, obtained from Baidu location-based services providing over 7 billion positioning requests per day, 35, 36 were used in this study to measure travel restrictions and social distancing across time and .

First, we simulated the COVID-19 spread across a metapopulation, where each population represented a city across China. Within each population, numbers of susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered/removed people were tracked per day. 3 The epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan were used to parameterise the epidemic before widely implementing the NPIs. 41 The number of new people that could become exposed was calculated based on the daily contact rate \u073f and the number of infectious people in the city \u202b\u072b\u202c , and this was turned into a number of newly exposed people after multiplying by the fraction of people in \u0745 who were susceptible (accounting for potential encounters with already-infected people, which did not lead to a new infection).

However, the peak of epidemics across the country quickly appeared through implementing strong and comprehensive NPIs, including dramatic reductions in travel and contact, and significant improvements in the timeliness of case detection and reporting across the country (Figure 1 and appendix Tables S1 and S2). We (Table 1) . However, the apparent effectiveness of different interventions varied (Figure 3 and appendix Figure S1 ). The lockdown of Wuhan might not have prevented the seeding of the virus from the city, as the travel ban was put in place at the latter stages of outbound travel prior to CNY's day ( Figure 3 ).\n\nNevertheless, if inter-city travel restrictions were not implemented, cities and provinces outside of Wuhan would have received more cases from Wuhan, and the affected geographic range would have expanded to the remote .

Therefore, integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect on COVID-19 outbreak containment ( Table 1 ).\n\nThe timings of intervention implementation are also critical. The number of cases could be dramatically reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, if the NPIs could be conducted one week, two weeks, and three weeks earlier than the actual timing across the country ( Figure 5) CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20029843 doi: medRxiv preprint sensitivity analyses of multiple parameters, our results on the relative effects of NPIs are robust to the possibility of changes in parameters. Considering the delay in case reporting, our approach and findings can provide critical and early evidence for outbreak control decision-making.\n\nHowever, our study has several limitations. First, as our simulations were based on the parameters estimated for the cases found in the early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan, , which might not account for the asymptomatic and mild infections, our study may underestimate the total number of infections.\n\nHowever, public awareness and enchanced case searching remained high throughout the study period, and a high proportion of infections was likely to have been detected, with nearly all reported cases eventually subjected to laboratory testing. Second, our findings could be affected by bias and confounding because the modelling is based on observations over a short period. Although we have shown that the apparent fall in incidence of COVID-19 since CNY's day in China is likely to be attributed to the interventions taken, we cannot rule out the possibility that the decrease was caused by varying timings and intensities of various NPIs taken in different areas as well as some other unknown seasonal factors, e.g. temperature and absolute humidity. 43 \n\nWe declare no competing interests. 1 8\n\nThe data of COVID-19 cases reported by county, city, and province across China are availalable from data sources detailed in the Supplementary, and the average days from illness onset to report of the first case by each county used in the modelling are detailed in appendix Tabel S2.
