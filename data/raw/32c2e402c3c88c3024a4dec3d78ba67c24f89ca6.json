{"title": "Accelerated viral dynamics in bat cell lines, with implications for zoonotic emergence 1", "body": "We defined \"induced immunity\" as complete, modeling all cells as susceptible to viral 185 invasion at disease free equilibrium, with defenses induced subsequent to viral exposure through 186 the term . By contrast, we allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the 187 parameter range of > 0, defining a \"constitutive\" system as one containing any antiviral cells at 188 disease free equilibrium. In fitting this model to tissue culture data, we independently estimated 189 both and , as well as the cell-to-cell transmission rate, , for each cell-virus combination. Pathogens can invade a host tissue culture when 0 > 1. Rapid rates of constitutive antiviral 208 acquisition ( ) will drive 0 < 1: tissue cultures with highly constitutive antiviral immunity will 209 be therefore resistant to virus invasion from the outset. Since, by definition, induced immunity is 210 stimulated following initial virus invasion, the rate of induced antiviral acquisition ( ) is not 211 incorporated into the equation for 0 ; while induced immune processes can control virus after 212 initial invasion, they cannot prevent it from occurring to begin with. In cases of fully induced or 213 absent immunity ( = 0), the 0 equation thus reduces to a form typical of the classic SEIR 214 model: 215 12 know a constitutively antiviral cell-receptor incompatibility to be at play). Because constitutive 251 immune assumptions can prohibit pathogen invasion ( 0 < 1), model fits to this time series 252 under constitutive assumptions were handicapped by overestimations of , which prohibited 253 pathogen invasion. Only by incorporating an exceedingly rapid rate of induced antiviral 254 acquisition could the model guarantee that initial infection would be permitted and then rapidly 255 controlled. 256 257\n\nIn fitting our theoretical model to in vitro data, we estimated the within-host virus 259 transmission rate ( ) and the rate(s) of cellular acquisition to antiviral status ( or + ) (Table  260   1 In contrast to Vero cells, the induced immunity model offered the best fit to all RoNi/7.1 274 data, consistent with reported patterns in the literature and our own validation by qPCR (Table 1; infections on RoNi/7.1 cell lines but here recovered higher estimates for rVSV-MARV than for 278 rVSV-EBOV. This reversal was balanced by a higher estimated rate of acquisition to antiviral 279 status ( ) for rVSV-EBOV versus rVSV-MARV. In general, we observed that more rapid rates 280 of antiviral acquisition (either induced, , constitutive, , or both) correlated with higher 281 transmission rates ( ). When offset by , values estimated for RoNi/7.1 infections maintained 282 the same amplitude as those estimated for immune-absent Vero cell lines but caused gentler 283 epidemics and reduced cellular mortality (Figure 1 ). RoNi/7.1 parameter estimates localized in 284 the region corresponding to endemic equilibrium for the deterministic, theoretical model ( Figure  285 4), yielding less acute epidemics which nonetheless went extinct in stochastic experiments. 286\n\nFinally, rVSV-G and rVSV-EBOV trials on PaKiT01 cells were best fit by models 287 assuming constitutive immunity, while rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 were matched 288 equivalently by models assuming either induced or constitutive immunity-with induced models 289 favored over constitutive in AIC comparisons because one fewer parameter was estimated 290 File 4). In reality, we know that NPC1 receptor incompatibilities make PaKiT01 cell lines 328 constitutively refractory to rVSV-MARV infection (Ng and Chandran 2018) and that PaKiT01 329 cells also constitutively express the antiviral cytokine, IFN-. Model fitting results suggest that 330 this constitutive expression of IFN-may act more as a rapidly inducible immune response 331 following virus invasion than as a constitutive secretion of functional Nonetheless, as hypothesized, PaKiT01 cell lines were by far the most antiviral of any in our 333 study-with initial antiviral rates estimated several orders of magnitude higher than any others in 334 our study, under either induced or constitutive assumptions ( We found that R 0 was essentially unchanged across differing immune assumptions for RoNi/7.1 341 16 and Vero cells, for which the initial antiviral rate was low. In the case of PaKiT01 cells, a high 342 initial antiviral rate under either induced or constitutive immunity resulted in a correspondingly 343 high estimation of (and, consequently, R 0 ) which still produced the same epidemic curve that 344 resulted from the much lower estimates for and R 0 paired with absent immunity. These 345 findings suggest that antiviral immune responses protect host tissues against virus-induced cell 346 mortality and may facilitate the establishment of more rapid within-host transmission rates.

In spatial simulations, rates of antiviral 366 acquisition were fixed at fitted values for and derived from mean field estimates, while 367 transmission rates ( ) were fixed at values ten times greater than those estimated under mean 368 field conditions, accounting for the intensification of parameter thresholds permitting pathogen 369 invasion in local spatial interactions (see Materials and Methods; Videos 1-3; Figure 5 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. \n\nAll experiments were carried out on three immortalized mammalian kidney cell lines: run in duplicate on 6-well plates, such that a typical plate for any of the three viruses had two 512 control (mock) wells, two MOI=0.0001 wells and two MOI=0.001 wells, excepting PaKiT01 513 plates, which had two control and four MOI=0.0001 wells at a given time. We justify this 514 PaKiT01 exemption through the expectation that IFN-expression is constitutive for these cells, 515\n\n.

Following incubation, virus was 519 aspirated off, and cell monolayers were washed in PBS, then covered with an agar plaque assay 520 overlay to mimic conditions under which infection trials were run. Plates were then harvested 521 sequentially at timepoints of roughly 5, 10, 15, and 20 hours post-infection (exact timing varied 522 as multiple trials were running simultaneously). Upon harvest of each plate, agar overlay was 523 removed, and virus was lysed and RNA extracted from cells using the Zymo Quick RNA Mini 524\n\nPrep kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions and including the step for cellular DNA 525 digestion. Post-extraction, RNA quality was verified via nanodrop, and RNA was converted to 526 cDNA using the Invitrogen Superscript III cDNA synthesis kit, according to the manufacturer's 527 instructions. cDNA was then stored at 4\u02daC and as a frozen stock at -20\u02daC to await qPCR. 528\n\nWe undertook qPCR of cDNA to assess expression of the type I interferon genes, IFN-529 and IFN-, and the housekeeping gene, -Actin, using primers previously reported in the 530 literature (Supplementary File 6). For qPCR, 2ul of each cDNA sample was incubated with 7ul 531 of deionized water, 1ul of 5UM forward/reverse primer mix and 10ul of iTaq Universal SYBR 532\n\nGreen, then cycled on a QuantStudio3 Real-Time PCR machine under the following conditions: 533 initial denaturation at 94\u02daC for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of: denaturation at 95\u02daC (5 sec), 534 annealing at 58\u02daC (15 sec), and extension at 72\u02daC (10 sec).

This yielded a natural mortality 630 rate, , corresponding to a lifespan of approximately 121, 191, and 84 hours, respectively, for 631\n\nVero, RoNi/7.1, and PaKiT01 cell lines (Figure 1-figure supplement 7) . We then fixed the virus 632 incubation rate, , as the inverse of the shortest observed duration of time from initial infection 633 to the observation of the first infectious cells via fluorescent microscope for all nine cell line -634 virus combinations (ranging 6 to 9.5 hours).

Note that these two systems of equations are equivalent and that parameter values can be used interchangeably across both forms. In the following system, N indicates the total cell capacity of the area modeled: To solve for R0, we adopted a next generation matrix approach, after Heffernan, Smith, and Wahl 2005, which we applied to the proportional system of equations (1-5, above).\n\nStep one of this process necessitated constructing two transition matrices: the F matrix, which describes how new infections are created and the V matrix which represents host transitions between exposed and infected states.\n\nTo build these F and V matrices, we first calculated the value of PS at the disease free equilibrium (DFE, whereby PI and PE are equal to zero. We allow for the presence of antiviral cells (PA) at disease free equilibrium, though their equilibrium quantity (and, by consequence, the extent of constitutive immunity at play in the system) depends on certain parameter values. When 6 = 0, PA will always be 0 at disease free equilibrium. By allowing the extent of constitutive immunity to vary with parameter values, we maintain consistency with the published literature, which suggests that, in constitutively antiviral bat cell lines (i.e. PaKiT01), some interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are perpetually expressed, like their IFN-< precursor, while others still require induction upon infection. At DFE, our antiviral population takes on the following form:\n\nAnd, by extension, our susceptible population can be represented as:\n\nFor cells with either absent or fully induced immunity, for which 6 = 0, this contracts to:\n\n.

No confidence interval is shown for spatial b which was fixed at 10 times the estimated mean for the mean field model fits when paired with equivalent values of e and r. All other parameters were fixed at the following values: b=.025 (mean field), .15 (spatial); a = 1/6; c=0; \u00b5= 1/121 (Vero), 1/191(RoNi/7.1, and 1/84 (PaKiT01)\n\nThere was considerable natural variation in initial cell counts across each trial, resulting from subtle differences in the seeding density and growth duration of time until the trial was initiated (when wells were subjectively deemed to have reached \"90% confluency\"). Baseline cell counts were also different across our three cell lines, which varied substantially in natural size. To correct for this variation, we opted to model the proportion of infectious cell spaces per hour for each well, rather than rely on the raw count data. To this end, we collected the maximum number of live cells counted in susceptible control wells at timepoint 0 and set this count to a rough measure of 100% well occupancy for the cell line in question. Using this method, maximum cell counts were, respectively, 103712, 82308, and 92233 for Vero, RoNi/7.1, and PaKiT01 cell lines, reflecting innate variation in cell sizes. We then converted all cell counts tabulated via our image processing code across the infectious time trials into proportions by dividing the counts by the total number of possible cell spaces for the cell line in question. Though clearly subject to some error, these methods nonetheless maintained internal consistency in our counting methods and generated reasonable time series. We originally experimented with directly tabulating the proportion of infected versus uninfected space in our binary images; however, this approach impaired our ability to generalize across more or less densely seeded trials, as well as trials on cell lines of disparate sizes. As such, we adopted the count-toproportion methods described here.\n\nTo generate an infectious time series of evenly distributed time steps against which to fit our mean field mechanistic model, we next fit a series of statistical models to the proportional data produced from the image processing methods described above. For the GFP-expressing data, we used the mgcv package in R (Wood 2001) to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) in the Gaussian family, with time elapsed (in hours) post infection as a predictor variable for proportion of infectious cells (the response variable). We fit a separate GAM model to each unique cell -virus -MOI combination, incorporating a random effect of well ID (such that each trial was modeled individually), and we fixed the smoothing parameter at k=7 for all trials, as recommended by the package author (Wood 2001). The gam.predict() function was used to return an estimate of infectious proportions per hour across the duration of each time series for each cell-virus-MOI combination.\n\nThe uninfected counts from the Hoechst stain data were much less numerous since each count required termination of the infection trial and fixation of cells; by definition, only one data point could be produced per trial. Due to this relative scarcity, we opted to fit a more standard linear regression model, again in the Gaussian family, to these data, rather than using the datahungry GAM methods employed above. As before, we set time elapsed post infection as the predictor for the Hoechst stain data and produced a unique estimate of the proportion of uninfected cells per hour across the duration of the longest-observed trial. No random effects were included in this model, and the resulting time series were used to estimate natural mortality rates for each cell line, when fit to control well data depicting natural susceptible decline ( Figure  1-figure supplement 7) .\n\n.
