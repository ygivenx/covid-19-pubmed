Although a significant proportion of interindividual variation in disease susceptibility rests on environmental agents such as malnutrition and infection with HIV, a substantial portion is unexplained. Studies of twins and adopted persons suggest a genetic component, 1 and the genes responsible for many primary immunodeficiency states have been identified. Such immunodeficiencies are extremely rare, however, and current understanding of common host genetic factors influencing susceptibility to major infectious diseases at broad population levels is limited.\n\nA principal feature of the host immune response to infection by structurally diverse pathogens is the inflammatory cytokine response. [2] [3] [4] The central pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-2 (IL2) determines the magnitude and duration of the T-cell response immediately following antigen encounter, 5 and assists in the maturation of macrophages, and the proliferation of B cells and natural killer cells 6 in the early stages of the adaptive Khor \n\nEurope PMC Funders Author Manuscripts immune response. IL2 also regulates the evolution of memory T cells after resolution of infection. 7 An excessive cytokine-mediated inflammatory response can be harmful to the host, resulting in severe forms of malaria and sepsis. [8] [9] [10] [11] Control of cytokine signalling in humans is mediated in part via negative feedback by the Suppressor of Cytokine Signalling (SOCS) family of proteins. CISH (cytokine inducible SH-2 domain protein) was the first member of the SOCS family to be described. 12 , 13 CISH has recently been shown to be the gene most consistently up-regulated by IL2 stimulation in humans 14 and appears to be critical for T-cell proliferation and survival 15 in response to infection. CISH controls the signalling of a variety of cytokines, in particular IL2. Unlike the other members of the SOCS family, CISH binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues of cytokine receptors through its SH-2 domain and masks sites at which STAT5 would otherwise dock. 12, [16] [17] [18] [19] Thus, increased CISH activity blocks the cytoplasmic docking and activation of STAT5, and thereby inhibits downstream cytokine signalling.\n\nGiven the central role of CISH in controlling IL2 signaling, we hypothesised that variation in CISH influences susceptibility to common infectious disease in humans.\n\nWe analyzed 8,402 persons, making up seven case-control series (Table 1) . These comprised Kenyan children with bacteremia, 8, 20 persons with tuberculosis from Malawi, 21 Hong Kong 22 and the Gambia, and persons with severe malaria from the Gambia, 23 Kenya, 24 and Vietnam. 8 We obtained written informed consent from the study participants and ethical approval from the relevant national authorities (see Supplementary Appendix) for all study collections. We obtained blood samples from which we extracted DNA (see Supplementary Appendix). Control groups were geographically matched to the cases. Twenty other immune-related genes have been previously studied in one or more of these sample collections (see Supplementary Table 1) .\n\nWe used standard methods, details of which can be found in Supplementary information.\n\nWe purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole blood drawn from human volunteers, cultured these cells, and then stimulated them with IL2 or IL3. We harvested the PBMCs at 0, 0.5 hr, 1 hr and 2 hr time-points after addition of interleukin, extracted RNAusing a standard method and synthesized and assayed cDNA using real time PCR (comparative method). Details can be found in Supplementary information.\n\nPower calculations for all case-control studies can be found in Supplementary Figure 1 .\n\nComparison of allele frequencies between cases and controls was performed with the Pearson's \u03c7 2 test under the different genetic modes of inheritance. The most likely mode of inheritance was determined by best model fit via logistic regression. Detailed descriptions of the statistical procedures, as well as of the various modes of inheritance are presented in Supplementary Information. Analysis of pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (LD) between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed using the r 2 algorithm within HaploView v3.2. 25 Multi-SNP score was analysed as previously described for case-control populations. 26 Individuals were coded accordingly with the number of risk alleles they carry (0, 1, 2, 3, or \u22654). A trend test for association was then performed. 27 Gene expression data analysis is located in Supplementary information. Figure 2) . We identified eight SNPs with a minor allele frequency greater than 5% ( Supplementary  Figure3a ) and did not detect any novel coding changes or predicted splice-junction variants. These eight SNPs were then genotyped in the KB case-control study: four of these SNPs (at positions \u2212639, \u2212292, \u2212163, and +3415) showed evidence of association (P=0.019-1.0\u00d710 \u22123 ; Figure 1 , Table 2a ); the variant alleles at each SNP were associated with increased susceptibility to bacteremia. Adjusting for HIV status, malnutrition and age did not significantly affect these associations.\n\nWe observed low pair-wise LD between SNPs at positions \u2212639 and +3415, between these SNPs and those that lie between them, and between the SNPs that lie between them (r 2 <0.50; Supplementary Figure 3b ). We also observed associations between multiple SNPs and susceptibility to disease and, bearing in mind the low pair-wise LD between these SNPs, hypothesized that risk alleles at these SNPs confer susceptibility independent from one another. To investigate whether risk of disease increased in a dose-dependent manner with respect to number of risk alleles, we performed multi-SNP scoring for the five SNPs. 26 The risk of bacteremia was found to be proportionate with the number of risk alleles carried (P=5.1\u00d710 \u22125 ; Table 2b ). Haplotypic analysis was uninformative due to the low inter-marker LD. We observed no significant evidence of interaction between the five SNPs, and went on to genotype them in the remaining six case-control studies.\n\nIn the Malawian tuberculosis (MTB) study, the minor alleles of three SNPs (-292, +1320, and +3415) were associated with increased susceptibility to TB (P=0.013-5.0\u00d710 \u22123 ; Figure  1 , Table 2a ). For CISH +1320 (overall P=6.0\u00d710 \u22123 ), the effect of the risk allele appeared strongest with a recessive mode of inheritance. Individuals homozygous for the risk allele were significantly more susceptible to tuberculosis compared to matched controls (5.6% of cases were homozygous for the risk allele, in contrast with 1.9% of controls; P=5.0\u00d710 \u22123 ).\n\nAdjusting for the potential confounding effects of age, gender, and ethnicity did not affect the degree of statistical significance and ORs for each SNP. The trend test for increasing disease risk with increasing number of risk alleles was also positive in this study (P=0.030, Table 2b ). In the Hong Kong TB study (HKTB), those with TB were more likely to carry a couple of variant CISH alleles (at positions \u2212292 and +1320) than unaffected persons (P=0.031 and P=2.0\u00d710 \u22123 respectively). In the case-control TB study from the Gambia (GTB), we observed association between the CISH +1320 variant allele (but not the \u2212292 SNP variant allele) and susceptibility to clinical tuberculosis (P=0.033). The positive trend test for TB observed in the MTB study was replicated in both HKTB (P=0.011) and GTB (P=0.034).\n\nWe genotyped the five CISH SNPs in three severe malaria collections from Gambia (GM), Kenya (KM), and Vietnam (VM). The variant alleles at positions \u2212639, \u2212292, +1320 and +3415 showed significant association with increased susceptibility to disease. In particular, the minor allele of \u2212292 showed significant association with susceptibility to severe malaria in GM, KM, as well as the smaller VM study (Table 2a) . As was observed in the bacteremia and tuberculosis studies, the trend test for increasing disease risk with increasing carriage of CISH risk alleles replicated across all three malaria studies (Table 2b) . Khor To investigate the possibility that the associated SNPs might be in LD with a true causative variant elsewhere we performed exclusion mapping by genotyping 28 additional evenlyspaced SNPs spanning 2,000,000 base-pairs in the Chr3p21 region surrounding CISH in the Malawi TB study population. None of the additional SNPs typed displayed evidence of association with TB ( Figure 1 ), suggesting that the observed associations are specific to CISH.\n\nOn pooled analysis, carriage of CISH risk alleles at \u2212639, \u2212292, \u2212163, +1320, and +3415 associated with increased susceptibility to the infectious diseases studied (Table 2a) , with \u2212292 accounting for the majority of the association signal (P=4.58\u00d710 \u22127 , Table 2a and Figure 2 ). Multi-SNP scoring of the five SNPs in each case-control study revealed that carriage of \u22651 CISH risk allele is accompanied by increasing risk of disease in each study (trend P=3.8\u00d710 \u221211 , Table 2b ).\n\nWe studied the functional effects of the CISH promoter variants because these SNPs showed the strongest associations with disease status and they are more likely to affect gene expression than intra-genic SNPs. We genotyped the promoter SNPs, To test for an interactive effect between CISH \u2212292 or CISH \u2212163, we determined two-SNP (\u2212292 and \u2212163) diplotypes (with chromosomal phase determined via subcloning and sequencing for individuals whose phase was uncertain) for the subjects analysed for CISH gene expression, and CISH expression was then compared between the \u2212292 genotypes in response to IL2 stimulation using \u2212163 as the conditioning locus. For individuals who were wild-type at \u2212163 (C/C), carrying the variant \u2212292T/T genotype resulted in markedly lower overall gene expression in response to IL2 stimulation at all time points (Figure 3b ). We observed no significant differences in CISH expression following stimulation by IL2 or IL3 when comparing the other CISH diplotypes with one another (data not shown).\n\nWe identified a panel of five CISH SNPs associated with increased susceptibility to bacteremia, tuberculosis and malaria in human populations, and estimated that the overall risk of having one of these infectious diseases was increased by 18 percent in persons carrying a single \"risk\" CISH allele, increasing to 81 percent in those with four or more risk alleles (Table 2b) .\n\nTwo important considerations in genetic association studies are population stratification and multiple testing. To assess the presence of population stratification, we examined 28 Khor \n\nEurope PMC Funders Author Manuscripts independent markers in the 2-Mb region flanking CISH and did not detect significant inflation of test statistics (\u03bbgc = 1.03). Furthermore, the consistency of the association across multiple ethnicities argues against the results being a product of population stratification. Regarding multiple testing, we evaluated CISH in the context of 20 other immune-related genes (analyzing a total of 187 SNPs) previously tested in one or more of these sample collections (Supplementary Table 1 ); the single-point observation with CISH \u2212292 (P=4.58\u00d710 \u22127 ) remains significant following correction for all the genes and SNPs tested (Threshold after correction for multiple-testing: 0.05/500 = 10 \u22124 ; 187 SNPs tested a total of 500 times cumulatively). The false-positive-report-probability 28 for \u2212292 is \u226410 \u22124 even at prior probability levels of \u226410 \u22125 . Further confidence is lent by the very low P-value (<5\u00d710 \u221211 ) observed with the multi-SNP score and the level of replication between study groups.\n\nThe pattern of association with CISH \u2212292 was consistently reproducible across six out of the seven study groups, with the exception being the Gambian TB study. One possible explanation for this heterogeneity is that disease susceptibility was accounted for by more than one SNP within the five-SNP panel, thus rendering single SNP analysis incomplete. A second reason might relate to underlying population structure, where different CISH SNPs may tag the informative variants in each distinct population. A third possibility is that there remain unidentified functional SNPs within the region of association delineated by the five-SNP panel that also account for association with disease. This last possibility is unlikely however, as direct sequencing did not detect additional putatively functional polymorphisms. To explore the first and second possibilities, we utilized multi-SNP scoring for all five associated SNPs. Risk of disease increased markedly with an increase in the number of risk alleles carried in each population. As this multi-SNP analysis was more informative than single-point analysis, the above two possibilities remain plausible explanations. The mechanisms underlying an association between the CISH multi-SNP score and accompanying dose-dependant effect on disease susceptibility likely reflect the potential regulatory effect of these polymorphisms within a 'multi-hit model', whereby each 'hit' affects gene expression cumulatively in aggregate. Such a process is in contrast to structural variants, where the presence of one deleterious mutation may be sufficient to account for disease.\n\nIn the ex-vivo volunteer study, carriage of the \u2212292 allele reduced CISH expression poststimulation with IL2. However, this study lacks power to detect significant differences in gene expression in individuals with 0, 1, 2, 3, and \u22654 risk alleles. Although \u2212292 showed associations with multiple infectious diseases and could be a true functional variant, CISH +1320 showed a stronger association with susceptibility to TB, and showed association in each of the \"TB\" studies. The possibility that variation at +1320 affect transcript expression is possible; this position is located in the untranslated portion of exon 2. 29 Further work is required to document the precise mechanisms whereby reduced CISH expression (and presumably consequential disturbed IL2 signaling) predisposes to increased risk of infectious disease. Stimulation by IL2 may enhance microbial and viral replication, 30 and its effect may be further dependent on the presence of other immune cells: clinical trials of IL2 infusion in HIV-positive patients have shown different effects on individuals depending on their CD4+ counts. 31, 32 Although it is perhaps unexpected that common variation within a single gene influences susceptibility to a diverse range of infectious diseases, there is increasing evidence that disparate infections are recognized by a common host inflammatory pathway. 8, [33] [34] [35] The observation that the risk alleles occur at appreciable allele frequencies in each of the study populations is surprising, given evidence suggestive of evolutionary selective pressure \n\nEurope PMC Funders Author Manuscripts exerted by some infectious diseases. 36, 37 One explanation may be that the variant alleles could have been concurrent modifiers of human susceptibility against other major causes of mortality in these populations. For example immune modulation at the IL-2 receptor axis may protect against Type 1 diabetes mellitus; 38 a possible role of CISH polymorphisms in the development of inflammatory as well as infectious diseases merits further study.\n\nCurrent clinical management of bacteremia, malaria and TB relies primarily on antimicrobials specifically targeted to the likely pathogen. Our findings implicate CISH in multi-pathogen susceptibility and raise the possibility that pharmacological manipulation of the SOCS pathway may impact the treatment of multiple, diverse infectious diseases. CISH variants may also influence responses to existing immunotherapies, such as IL2 therapy in renal cell cancer, which is associated with wide and largely unexplained variations in interindividual response rates. 39 \n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. Forest plots analyses for CISH \u2212292 (rs414171) in all study cohorts. Results of the overall pooled analysis and case-control analyses were generated using the allelic test. Plots include the disease odd ratio for the variant allele in each study. indicating that the pooled odds ratio and accompanying pooled P was applicable across all populations. However, for CISH \u2212292, inclusion of the GTB set causes the tests of homogeneity to be borderline significant (P=0.059). As such, we performed a secondary analysis for \u2212292 which did not include the GTB set (P = 3.9 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , OR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.19-1.34).\n\nc The Tarone and Breslow-Day's test for homogeneity was markedly significant (P<0.001) for CISH \u2212163, and thus pooling should not be performed for this SNP. However, if pooling was performed anyway for the sake of information, P = 3.0\u00d710 \u22127 .\n\nd Risk allele frequency referred to the minor allele frequency for each SNP genotyped. They were the actual allelic frequencies and were not the result of prediction programs. It was calculated as number of mutant alleles divided by total number of alleles.\n\ne As this was an apparently highly significant single-point observation, we confirmed the direct sequencing calls by an independent and blinded person. The concordance rate was absolute, arguing against genotyping error as the cause of this observation."}
