{"title": "Bovine interferon: its biology and application in veterinary medicine", "body": "In 1958 Isaacs and Lindemann [60] discovered the reason for a phenomenon of viral interference in animals, described by a number of investigators as early as the 1930's. The factor was a protein, produced in response to a viral infection, which subsequently inhibited infection with a second, related or unrelated, virus in a non-specific manner. This discovery created great excitement due to the implications of having an antiviral agent with a wide spectrum of antiviral activity for use in viral therapy. During the past 28 years, many aspects of the interferon (IFN) system have been elucidated, including the finding that IFN is not one protein, but a family of proteins with a multitude of biological and physiological functions. Thus, IFNs are not only powerful antiviral agents, but also have anticellular activity (against cancer cells) as well as a plethora of effects on the immune system.\n\nRecently there have been several comprehensive reviews, monographs and book series on the multifarious aspects of IFN biology, including its chemistry, generation, and its in vivo and in vitro biological effects [13, 41, 43, 48, 56, 65, 76, 82, 84, 105, 109] . Hence, this review will be restricted specifically to the bovine IFN system, with brief references to general aspects or other animal species, where appropriate. The reader is therefore referred to the literature cited above for more general information or data specific for other animal species.\n\nThe bovine interferons (BolFNs) probably constitute the animal IFN group on which, apart from the human and murine counterparts, most is known at the present time, regarding the genes coding for the protein and their clinical and immunological effects (summarized in Tables 1 and 2) . When in addition, considerations are given to several important viral infections of cattle, which could be treated with IFN as well as being useful models for human diseases (herpes virus infections, leukosis, neonatal virus-diarrhea; for review see [23] ) there is every good reason to encourage research into the various aspects of the bovine IFN system. Below we will attempt to give a brief account of the present state of knowledge relating to bovine IFN and its application in bovine medicine.\n\nThe genes coding for BolFN-oL can be grouped into two homologous, but distinct classes, class 1 (BolFN-oq) and 2 (BolFN-o~2), respectively [31] . The BolFNet I gene family contains approximately 10-12 members, and sequepce analyses of homology within that family of genes. This family exhibits greater homology in both their coding and flanking regions to members of the class 1 human interferon-a (HulFN-at) gene family than they do to the BolFN-a e gene family. Similarly the BolFN-ot 2 subfamily, which contains 15-20 members, display greater homology to the members of the class 2 HulFN-ot genes than to the BolFN-cxf genes. Further similarities between human and bovine IFN-a~ and -a2 genes are demonstrated by the fact that the class 1 genes code for a mature protein of 165-166 amino acids whereas, the class 2 genes code for a protein of 172 amino acids in length in both species.\n\nBoth classes of IFN-ot genes are coordinately induced in response to a viral infection, and encode polypeptides with antiviral activity. However, whether all of the different IFN-a genes are actually expressed, i.e., translated, at any given encounter between a virus and a cell has not yet been elucidated. The indications are that depending on the virus, as well as on the cell type, BolFN-a genes may be differentially expressed (Czarniecki et al., unpublished data) . These results are in agreement with findings with human macrophage produced IFN [58] , where it ap-pears that the IFNs induced by different viruses differ in their antiviral activities, i.e., antiviral spectrum and potency [16, 116] . This could reflect the ability of different viruses to depress or regulate different IFN-genes during an infection. Further elucidation of these aspects will have to await cloning .and production of more IFN-ot subtypes of either class. Once gene probes are available, it will be possible to quantitate production of the individual IFN-mRNA following infection with different viruses [123] . Furthermore, the availability of purified individual IFN subtypes will also allow investigation into whether any specific subtype has a different mechanism of action.\n\nThe gene-products of the BolFN-oq and -o~ 2 genes do not appear to possess glycosylation sites [31] . At least some of the IFN-proteins encoded by class 2 genes appear to be acid labile (pH 2) (Shepard et al., unpublished data). In contrast, the class 1 gene products fit the original physico-chemical characterization of type I IFNs in that they are not acid labile [109, Shepard et al., unpublished data] . This finding may explain the reported occurrence of partial acid lability of natural BoIFN type I (odl3) induced during a primary infection of cattle, or in cell cultures from non-immune animals, i.e., under conditions where IFN-~ production could be excluded [53, 66, 77, 115] .\n\nThe BoIFN-I3 gene family appears to comprise at least 5 homologous, yet distinct members [79] . This is in contrast to a single IFN-I3 gene so far detected in the human genome. DNA sequence analysis has demonstrated that the BoIFN-I3 exhibits only 55% homology with the HuIFN-[3. This is less than the overall homology between the corresponding gene-sequences in the 2 species, and points to more recent events in gene-evolution [79, 122] . Only limited studies have been conducted on the physico-chemical properties of natural BoIFN-[3 [2] or on recombinant produced IFN-I3 but preliminary data appear to suggest that it is less stable, following purification, than is BoIFN-c~ (unpublished data).\n\nAs in other species, only one gene encoding for IFN-~/has been detected in the bovine. The BoIFN-et gene shares similar properties with IFN-~/ genes of other species in that it contains introns (in contrast to the IFN-a and 13 genes), and the gene product, BoIFN-~/, binds to a cell receptor distinguishable from the IFN-a/13receptor [37, Bielefeldt Ohmann and Babiuk, unpublished data]. Nevertheless, the 3 IFN-types exhibit at least some of the same activities, although their potency or specific activity in each specific biological reaction does vary.\n\nTo date 4 of the BolFN-e~ genes, 2 of the BoIFN-13 genes and the BolFN-~ gene have been cloned and expressed in E. coli by recombinant DNA-technology [31, 32, 79] . The availability of these cloned products has greatly increased the ability to conduct a more thorough analysis of the antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of each of the bovine IFNs. Furthermore, it has allowed clinical trials to be conducted with these products and their potential use as prophylactic and therapeutic compounds is being assessed.\n\nThe first report of IFN-production by bovine cells was published in 1959 [117] . The induction was achieved by infection of calf kidney cells in vitro with human influenza A virus. Since then a multitude of primary cell culture systems, established cell lines and organ cultures of bovine origin, and viruses, homologous as well as heterologous, have been employed for in vitro generation of IFN [1, 50, 51, 52, 53, 73, 78, 85, 95 , see 92 for references prior to 1973].\n\nThe cells which produce the various IFNs in the bovine are not as well characterized as those in man and mice [for review see 65] . However, even in the latter species, the originally clear distinction between fibroblast and leukocyte-IFN, i.e. 13-and a-IFN, respectively, has become more blurred as time has passed and more cell types have been studied. The distinction between IFN-types has also become more questionable since the discovery of several subspecies of IFN within each IFNgroup, some of which may show overlapping physico-chemical characteristics, such as acid-lability. However, using monoclonal antibody and hybridization techniques, it should be possible to improve both the detection and identification of cells producing each class of IFN as well as to identify/classify the protein produced under different conditions [123, Shepard et al., unpublished data] .\n\nIn many studies, the bovine IFN produced has in all likelihood been IFN-13, considering the cell types used, the reported acid-stability as well as other defined characteristics. However, in some cases, especially where organ cultures were employed, the IFN may have been a mixture of IFN-a and -13 due to the presence of 'contaminating' macrophages (Mqb). Bovine Md~s are avid IFN-producers in response to in vitro virus-challenge [24, 26, 77, 100] as well as other acellular and cellular inducers [24] . The IFN produced by bovine Md~s is acid labile, but otherwise has the physico-chemical and antigenic characteristics of IFN-a. Recently, it has been found to belong to the class 2 IFN-a family, which, as previously mentioned, characteristically are acid labile (Shepard et al., unpublished data). When peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from seronegative (with respect to BHV-1) calves are exposed to BHV-1 infected fibroblasts they were found to produce IFN-a 2 (Shepard et al., unpublished data). This may largely be produced by the M~b population (monocytes) present in the PBL. In contrast, Fulton and Rosenquist [53] did not detect IFN-activity in PBL-cultures from non-immunized calves following infection in vitro with BHV-1. Whether this discrepancy is due to challenge dose, the way the virus was introduced into the in vitro system (i.e., as virus-infected cells or as cell-free virus suspension) or the sensitivity of the IFN-assay is presently not known. This latter finding is, however, surprising since infection of M~b with BHV-1 virus has been shown to rapidly induce high levels of IFN [26, 47] .\n\nIn PBL cultures from immune animals the major type of IFN produced upon in vitro re-exposure to the antigen, whether it be a virus, virus-infected cells, or other antigens is IFN--~ [7] . As in other species the producer cells reside in the T cell population, and the production of IFN-~ by this population is, at least partially, dependent on the presence of Mqbs as accessory cells [7] .\n\nBovine leukocytes, other than M+s and lymphocytes, may also produce IFN or IFN-like substances in response to virus exposure. Rouse et al. [99] reported that that bovine PMNs produced an IFN-like substance upon contact with BHV-1 infected cells. The finding apparently has passed rather unrecognized, and to our knowledge similar findings have not been reported for other species. Considering the potential importance of PMNs in antiviral immunity [98] it warrants further investigations regarding both the conditions for induction and secretion as well as the physico-chemical charcaterization of these antiviral molecules.\n\nIn vitro systems for IFN-production are liable to many variables including temperature [78] , the age of the cells or their passage level, serum-factors including contaminating endotoxins and contamination with other, non-cytopathic, viruses or with mycoplasma, as well as the host cell and inducer. The influence of some of these factors on bovine IFN production has been investigated by several groups; however, no consistent results have appeared [1, 42, 51, 73, 95] . The results of Fulton and Pearson [51] suggest that considerable differences exist between bovine continuous cell lines in their ability to produce IFNs in response to viruses. In addition, the passage level of the specific cell line may also influence the results [96] . This may reflect the continuous evolution of cells in culture and alteration of gene expression or possible infection with exogenous agents. A common contaminant of bovine cells and serum is the bovine pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea-virus (BVDV). Diderholm and Dinter [42] found that an infection with non-cytopathic BVDV significantly suppressed the IFN-response to a secondary viral infection. In contrast, Rossi and Kiesel [95] found that BVDV did not affect IFN production by polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly rI.poly rC). Thus, it may be that different inducers and contaminants may affect different genes or gene families differently. This could be especially important if some viral proteins or glycoproreins of BVDV affect host cell gene expression. If one isolate of BVDV is more active in this regard than another, this could easily explain the discrepancies reported. It is probable that exposure to a virus such as BVDV, which could induce various levels of IFN itself may alter subsequent IFN responses. Thus, care should be taken to insure that cultures are free of exogenous agents before they are used for the analysis of IFN responses.\n\nThe phenomenon of 'priming', which involves pretreatment of cells with IFN, to enhance the IFN-production by subsequent viral or non-viral stimulation [59, 108] , does also occur in bovine cells. Priming has been demonstrated to occur for all 3 IFN-types [63, 95] . It is generally found that low, rather than high doses of impure IFN cause priming [108] . However, if pure interferon is used, priming can be observed at high doses [41a] . High doses of impure interferon can also induce a phenomenon designated 'blocking'. This latter phenomenon has been observed in bovine alveolar Mqb (AM) pretreated with pure rBolFN-a and subsequently challenged with BHV-1 [26] . These observations may have implications in the clinical use of IFNs, where the timing and doses of IFN application may alter the efficacy of its activity.\n\nCirculating and/or tissue IFN can be detected in cattle following natural or experimental virus infection or following stimulation with various chemical compounds. The latter group comprises poly rI.poly rC [5, 62, 91, 111] , natural double stranded or chemically modified RNA [62, 112] and statolon [93] . Unfortunately, these compounds as well as other synthetic IFN-inducers, are toxic and, therefore, have not been investigated extensively in cattle [62, 91, 92, 93] . These and other disadvantages of using synthetic IFN-inducers in preventive veterinary medicine were recently discussed by Werenne [119] .\n\nNumerous viruses have been reported to induce IFN in cattle. These include Newcastle disease virus, vaccinia virus, bovine parainfluenza-3 virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine adenovirus, bovine enterovirus (strain LCR-4), BVDV, bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) (s. IBRV/IPV) and bovine rotaviruses [20, 34, 35, 36, 44, 67, 75, 88, 91, 92, 94, 101, 110, 113, 118, 126] . However, the role of IFN in limiting virus replication has not been established for most of these infections with the exception of BHV-1. Several groups have found a clear relationship between replication of BHV-1 in the nasal passage and IFN-titers in nasal secretions [20, 75, 113] . In contrast, IFN levels in serum are usually negligible following a respiratory tract infection with BHV-1, even though BHV-1 is believed to produce systemic infections [20,113, and u~apublished data] . Locally induced IFN, following an aerogenic BHV-1 infection, can confer at least partial protection against a secondary infection with either BHV-1 or an unrelated virus [34, 35, 36, 110, 113] . Whether locally produced IFN can have systemic effects and alter the outcome of the infection remains to be determined. Pretreatment of calves with cortisone enhances the IFN-generation upon BHV-1 challenge [33] , probably due to a corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression with subsequent unrestricted viral replication. Experimental (oral) infection of colostrum deprived calves with bovine rotavirus, results in the production of IFN which is detectable in the intestinal content and the gut mucosa as well as in the serum [67, 118] . The presence of IFN in the serum is rather surprising since the virus infection is believed to be a strictly local gut infection. This must indicate that adsorption of IFN through the mucosal surfaces is an efficient process. Following rotavirus infection, several waves of IFN production are usually detected, which correlates with virus multiplication in the gut. An inverse relationship between virus dose, IFN production and clinical disease seems to exist. With high doses of virus (5-20 x 109 PFU), IFN is produced very early (within the first 24 h p.i.) with no clinical symptoms of infection. In contrast, with a lower dose of virus (2-20 x 10 4 PFU), IFN production is delayed and the virus induces a transient diarrhea [118] . However, the role of IFN in limiting infection in the former instances must be interpreted with caution since rotavirus may, under such dose levels produce defective interfering particles which may be excellent IFN inducers, but unable to induce disease.\n\nIntestinal IFN produced in response to enteric virus infection is partially sensitive to pH 2, suggesting that it is a mixture of IFN-13, produced by enterocytes, and IFN-a2, produced by leukocytes in the lamina propria/mucosa. This sugges-tion corroborates the antigenic characterization of gut-IFN [67] . It was suggested that the serum-IFN detected in calves challenged orally with rotavirus primarily originates from adsorption of intestinal (enterocyte-produced) IFN, because the weak viremia, if occurring, seems unlikely to be able to stimulate such a pronounced IFN response [67] . However, it is also possible that blood leukocytes, which are very avid IFN-producers may produce the IFNs. It should be possible to test these alternatives by a more thorough characterization of the intestinal and serum-IFN, respectively, as well as their specific roles in preventing virus replication either directly or indirectly, in enterocytes.\n\nDespite the abundance of reports on possible mechanisms of antiviral activity of IFNs, no unequivocal explanation has been accepted for their action. There is no single mechanism by which treatment of cells with IFN inhibits the replication of all viruses. However, whatever the mechanism(s) at work in any particular cell type and with any particular virus type, it is generally accepted that IFNs act on the cells and change their biochemistry in such a way that virus replication is either no longer possible or, at least, significantly reduced. IFN induces a number of enzymes [14] and thereby 'prepares' the cell to resist an infecting virus, but the specific antiviral mechanism may not be activated until a virus attaches to or enters into the cell.\n\nOne of the best characterized antiviral mechanisms induced by IFN is the 2'5'oligo(A) synthetase-RNase pathway [13, 15, 76] . Virus replicative intermediates such as dsRNA (viral replicative intermediates) first activate at least 2 and possibly as many as 4 synthetases, that synthesize a series of 2'5'-linked adenylate oligomers, also designated 2-5A. This activates a latent cellular endo-RNase (2-5A-dependent RNase, RNase L or F) which cleaves mRNA and rRNA. Constitutive levels of all of the enzymes in this cascade are present in variable amounts in a variety of cells and tissues, but in response to IFN the level of the 2-5A synthetase may increase 10-104 fold. Thus, this enzyme can be used as a biochemical marker for the sensitivity of a cell system or animal to IFN-treatment. This has recently been applied to the bovine system [55] . Only dsRNAs containing 50 or more base pairs are effective activators of 2-5A [14] . Since dsRNA of this size is not normally found in the cell cytoplasm, the strict size-requirements ensure that the IFN-induced enzymes are not accidentally activated in uninfected cells.\n\nThe second well known mechanism of action involves an IFN-induced dsRNAdependent protein kinase capable of phosphorylating the alpha-subunit of the eucaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor eIF2, with the subsequent inhibition of protein synthesis [72, 89, 125] . Whether these pathways of inhibition of protein synthesis are involved in other, or additional, mechanisms of virus inhibition such as inhibition of viral penetration [121] , of glycosylation of viral glycolipids and glycoproteins [81] and, of viral assembly and/or release [27, 61] is presently not known.\n\nIn addition to direct antiviral mechanisms of IFN action, the in vivo antiviral effects of IFN may be mediated partially by the host. Thus, activation of cellular components of the immune system, such as Md0, natural killer (NK) cells or T cells for killing of virus-infected cells, antibody producing cells etc. can play an extremely important role in limiting virus infection and viral pathogenesis [28, 41, 70, 102, 106] . As a result of these numerous effects of IFN on cells of the immune system, it is difficult to design in vivo experiments to answer one specific question regarding the mechanism(s) of IFN action, and to verify the importance of endogenous IFN in antiviral resistance. Gresser et al. [57] demonstrated that injection of anti-IFN-serum could reduce the resistance of mice to a variety of viruses. More recently it has also been found that genetically determined resistance of mice to herpesvirus infection correlated positively with the magnitude of the early local IFN-response [45, 124] , thus adding substantial support for the hypothesis that IFN does play an important role in limiting virus replication in vivo and thereby altering the cause and effects of a viral infection.\n\nRegarding in vitro antiviral potency of BolFNs, many discrepancies are apparent. This applies both to the sensitivity of the cells to the antiviral effect, and to the sensitivity of the various viruses in any given cell system [4, 8, 29, 38, 42, 44, 52, [67] [68] [69] 87, 88, 96, 104, 107, 116] . However, as no standard procedure for the IFN assay has been followed by the various groups and no standard reference IFN was employed in their investigations, a direct comparison is not possible at present. This emphasizes the need for investigators to incorporate an international standard IFN in all their assays.\n\nIn most studies where a comparison of the in vitro sensitivity of bovine viruses to IFN has been performed, a relative insensitivity of BHV-1 to BolFN, regardless of the IFN-type, has been observed [4, 37, 101, 116] . Thus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is at least 1000 fold more sensitive than is BHV-1. Recently some variability in sensitivity of different BHV-1 strains was observed but none of them were nearly as sensitive as was VSV [49] . These findings corroborate the in vivo findings, where maximal IFN-titers in nasal secretion of BHV-1 challenged calves occur simultaneously with maximal virus-titers [20, 75, 113] , and exogenous BolFN applied intranasally prior to nasal challenge with BHV-1 does not reduce replication to any significant degree, indicating the insensitivity of BHV-1 in vivo to the direct antiviral effects of BolFN [4, 11] . Most other viruses, reputedly involved in respiratory disease in cattle, show moderate to high sensitivity to natural and recombinant BolFNs in vitro [4, 49] . However, the in vivo results of Cummins and Rosenquist [35, 36] suggest that care must be exercised when extrapolating in vitro results to what might be expected in vivo. This is probably a result of the direct and indirect effects which occur in vivo.\n\nSeveral reports describe restricted activity of crude BolFN od13 in porcine cells [3, 8, 35, 50] . In contrast, both purified rBolFN-etl, and rBolFN-132 have antiviral activity in porcine cells which equals that in bovine cells [4] and BoIFN-~ t was shown to be more active in porcine cells than in bovine cells [8] . However, in this context it should perhaps be reiterated that the properties of the challenge virus may influence the assay in different cell systems, as well as the cellular specificity of the IFN [83] . Rinaldo et al. [88] reported that in vivo BVDV-induced IFN had higher activity in ovine cells than in bovine, whereas rBoIFN-a has an activity in ovine and caprine cells which is slightly inferior to that seen in bovine cells [4] .\n\nIndependent of the relative antiviral potential of BoIFN-~I, -[3 and -% the kinetics of development of the antiviral state (in vitro) in sensitive cells appears to be similar [Babiuk, unpublished data, 37] . Brief exposure (1-1 5 h) of cells to BolFN at /> 102 units/ml results in low but reproducible levels of virus-yield inhibition. Maximum inhibition is reached after 8-24 h of treatment, depending on IFN-concentration. After removal of the BoIFN from an in vitro cell system, the antiviral state decays completely within 48 h (Babiuk, unpublished data).\n\nProminent among the non-antiviral effects of IFNs are those exerted on cells of the immune system. The majority of the studies in this area have been conducted using in vitro systems [41, 65] . With the advent of pure cloned IFN in a variety of species as well as the initiation of clinical trials employing IFN, its in vivo immunomodulatory effects are now being intensively investigated both in experimental systems and clinical settings. Using these systems, it will be possible to determine whether those effects observed in vitro in isolated systems also occur in vivo where various parameters of the immune system interact and counteract [18, 19] . However, valuable information must still be retrieved from the in vitro systems, where the single components of the intricate web of the immune defence can be dissected and evaluated separately as well as in combination. These in vitro studies will help us to more judiciously design in vivo experiments to produce the desired effect for specific application, i.e. specific disease situations. Once these are conducted, final confirmation of any conclusion must eventually be based on in vivo findings.\n\nBefore the advent of recombinant DNA-technology, only impure preparations of bovine IFNs were available for in vitro studies. Why this kept most laboratories concerned with veterinary immunology from conducting studies on the immunomodulatory effect of IFNs in the bovine species, when it did not do so in the murine and human field seems somewhat curious. However, up until 1983 only few reports on the immuno-modulating properties of BolFNs emerged [9, 98] . When it was found that preventive treatment of calves with rBoIFN had a very beneficial effect on the clinical performance in experimental Shipping Fever without significantly reducing virus replication in the nasal cavity [10] , studies were initiated to elucidate the non-antiviral effects of BoIFNs, which might potentially contribute to these observations.\n\nIn most organ systems the first line of cellular defence against extraneous microorganisms is exerted by cells of the monocyte-macrophage (M+) lineage and polymorphonuclear leukocytes [neutrophils (PMN) or eosinophils (PME)]. The efficiency whereby they can combat the intruders may depend on such functions as migration, generation and release of reactive oxygen species, e.g. hydrogen peroxide (H202) and superoxide anions (o~), lysosomal enzymes, expression of surface receptors for immunoglobulin (Fc-R) and complement (C-R), secretion of IFN and prostaglandins (PG), phagocytosis and cellular cytotoxicity. Most of these activities of bovine cells can be modulated by in vitro treatment of the cells with rBolFN-a 1 or -~/ ( Table 2) , and those functions so far examined are also subject to in vivo modulation (Table 1) . However, the effect of the IFN-exposure appears to be very dependent on dose, exposure time and the health status of the animal, i.e. whether clinically healthy or infected with virus (or virus plus bacteria [17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25] . The influence of the latter is so dramatic as to give completely opposite results when, for example, migration and O~-generation by PMN are evaluated [18, 22] . At the present time, there are no explanations to these discrepancies, but most likely a plethora of endogenous factors, released during a virus infection, will somehow change the effect of the exogenous IFN. Another explanation could be that what we consider beneficial with respect to the in vitro situation may not be beneficial in vivo. For example, although production of oxygen reactive species may be important in killing bacteria it may also lead to tissue damage and enhanced pathology. Furthermore these molecules may be a reflection of the severity of disease and therefore, there should be an inverse relationship between cellular activation and disease. No influence of age of the donor animal has so far been detected regarding sensitivity to IFN-modulation. Neither has an influence of the animals genetic make-up [40] been observed with certainty in the bovine species, although it has been suspected to play a role on some occasions (unpublished data). Further insight into this aspect may have to await better characterization of the immune response genes in the bovine species [39] or other genetic factors influencing the expression of IFN or IFN induced proteins.\n\nNatural cell-mediated cytotoxicity is a non-specific immune defence mechanism exerted by a still unclassified effector cell (subset or subsets) which is antigen and antibody independent. The indications are that this defence-mechanism may be of importance in antiviral defence [28] . In the bovine species, cells exerting natural cytotoxicity against xenogeneic tumor cells as well as against BHV-1 infected bovine fibroblasts reside within or are more closely related to the M+-lineage [24] . As in other species, their activity is highly susceptible to in vitro and in vivo modulation by IFNs [19] with responses being increased upon exposure to rBolFN. The exact mechanism whereby IFNs modulate NC activity and whether in vitro and in vivo modulation occurs by the same mechanisms remains to be determined. Thus, endogenous in vivo factors which are not present in vitro may modulate the effect of the exogenous BoIFNs. The in vivo enhancing effect of rBoIFNs on NC-activity may involve a direct or indirect influence on the bone marrow, i.e., the development and recruitment of effector cells [19] . Thus, although both rBoIFN-u 1 and -~/in vitro have a dose-dependent suppressive effect on the proliferation of bone marrow cells of the Mqb-lineage, there seems to be a partially selective expansion of a certain subset of bone marrow Mob, which share phenotypic (i.e., antigenic) characteristics with the NC cells in peripheral blood [19, and unpublished data] .\n\nWhen healthy calves are treated intravenously or intramuscularly with rBoIFNoq or -% the mitogen proliferative-response of PBL is reduced 24 h later. Addition of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to the in vitro cultures can partly or completely prevent this suppression [22] . In contrast, at later times (2-4 days after treatment) the proliferative response of PBL to Con A and PHA is actually enhanced. Although the in vivo effect of the two IFNs is similar, their effect differs when they are added to in vitro PBL cultures from normal non-treated animals. Thus, over a concentration range of rBoIFN-~/the modulation of the Con A and PHA responses varies from enhancement (low doses) to suppression (high doses). The suppressive effect can be completely reverted by addition of exogenous IL-2, which could indicate that the suppressive effect is exerted by either inhibition of mitogen stimulated IL-2 production in the cultures or by stimulating cells which compete for IL-2 binding, but without exhibiting a proliferative response. In contrast, BoIFN-~1 if used at the same dose range as BoIFN-~/only suppresses the PHA and Con Aresponses of PBL, but as with rBoIFN-~/suppression, this can be overcome by addition of IL-2 [22] . The difference between the two IFN-types may illustrate their different physiological roles. Thus, since IFN-~ is actually produced in mitogenstimulated lymphocyte (T cells) cultures, it is tempting to speculate that IFN serves as an initial enhancer, but later as a feed-back control mechanism to shut off proliferation to prevent overreaction of the immune response. Recombinant human IFN has also been found to suppress proliferation of bovine PBL, but the effect seems somewhat capricious and dependent on serum source and the individual animal [30] . Using cloned or bulk bovine T cells, we have demonstrated that c~ 1 interferon can inhibit their proliferation and responsiveness to IL-2 (unpublished data).\n\nIn exploration of the mechanism(s) involved in IFN-suppression of mitogenstimulated lymphocyte proliferation, the effect of rBoIFN-~ or --y on the Con A induced IL-2 generation was investigated. Although these results are preliminary there appeared to be enhanced IL-2 generation following in vivo exposure. In contrast, no consistent effect could be seen after in vitro exposure (unpublished data). Activation of suppressor cells by IFNs has been reported in other animal systems [6] and this possibility was therefore considered. In vitro treatment of bovine M+ with either BolFN-a or --\u00a2 did not endow them with suppressive activity. On the contrary, it enhanced their accessory cell activity, at least as applied to the mitogen response [25] . In contrast, a suppressor cell with lymphocyte characteristics was induced by high doses of rBolFN-a 1, or -~/within a few hours of exposure [22] . It remains to be elucidated how this suppressor cell exerts its activity. Although no inhibitory effect of rBolFN-treatment on the antibody response to viral antigens has been detected [10] , both rBolFN-eh, and -[3 have a profound effect on the in vitro secondary antibody response (Filion et al., unpublished data) (Fig. 1) . The mechanism of suppression has not yet been studied in the bovine system, but in the human system it was shown to be due to a direct anti-proliferative effect of IFNs rather than via an intermediary suppressor cell mechanism [41] . It remains to be investigated what effect BolFN-~/ might have on the bovine antibody-producing cell responses. In the murine system IFN-~/was found to enhance the response by acting as a cofactor in driving the maturation of resting B cells to active immunoglobulin secretions [74, 106] . If this mechanism also occurs in vivo the implications for a beneficial effect of combined immunization (vaccination) and IFN-~/treatment are considerable.\n\nAs already mentioned above, both in vivo and in vitro exposure of bovine alveolar M~b modulates their expression of immune receptors and ecto-enzymes, either positively or negatively ( Table 2 ). In addition, surface antigen expression is affected [21, 25] , most notably the expression of a MHC-II product (Ia-like antigen). rBolFN-~ in particular is most active in this regard. The activation of an Ia-like antigen in combination with enhancement of the accessory cell activity may be of considerable significance for the specific immune response in animals and may actually be one of the major factors in the enhancement of immune responses following vaccination [80, 114] or allowing recovery from infection.\n\nThe use of IFNs in the control of bovine viral diseases was considered at a time when IFN research was still in its infancy [92] . It was suggested at that time that bovine respiratory disease, especially Shipping Fever, might be the model of choice for evaluating the usefulness of IFN in disease control of cattle [85, 92] . This model is especially attractive because of its experimental reproducibility, its predictable yearly recurrence in the field, the number of viruses (conjecturally) involved and last, but not least, its economic importance for the cattle industry and the consumers.\n\nThree different strategies for IFN-therapy can be employed: induction of endogenous IFN by (1) an avirulent viral agent, or (2) a suitable non-toxic, chemical compound, or (3) local or systemic application of IFN from an exogenous source. As previously mentioned, it has proven virtually impossible to optimize a system using chemical/synthetic inducers, because of problems with toxicity, individual variations in responsiveness, etc. [92, 120] . The studies conducted to date on the endogenous IFN-induction by challenge with an avirulent virus have also been equally discouraging. Thus, although some protection has been obtained after in vivo IFN-induction with a supposedly avirulent BHV-1 strain (vaccine strain) against food and mouth disease virus [110] , virulent BHV-1 [113] bovine rhinovirus, parainfluenza-3 and adenovirus [34, 35, 36] , protection was only partial.\n\nThe use of exogenous IFN seems to be the strategy of choice for treatment of animals. However, until the advent of recombinant DNA-technology, and the cloning of IFN-genes into bacteria with subsequent large scale production and refined purification methods, the production of BolFNs for clinical use in cattle appeared to require almost heroic efforts and certainly was not economically feasible [85] . The present availability of recombinant E. coli-derived IFNs, should insure their evaluation and application, as a control measure against bovine viral disease within the foreseeable future [11, 119] .\n\nRecombinant HulFN-% has been tested in cattle against experimental vaccinia virus infection [103] and against BHV-1 induced respiratory disease [90] . In both instances multiple injections of IFN were given and although some protection was obtained, individual variations in sensitivity to the treatment were notable. Moreover, in respiratory disease models, toxic effects, such as CNS-depression and hyperthermia, resulting from IFN-treatment were evident, though the authors tended to neglect this aspect [90] .\n\nIn contrast to the effects seen with the HulFN, cattle appear to tolerate extremely high doses of rBolFN-%, with the only detectable 'toxic' effect being hyperthermia of brief duration (less than 8 h). Doses of 106 units/kg body weight of rBoIFN-~ may induce diarrhea in some animals in addition to the hyperthermia and transient changes in blood leukocyte numbers [22] . However, this dose far exceeds the dose necessary for a prophylactic effect of rBoIFN-y against bovine respiratory disease (unpublished data). This dose may be further reduced if it is found that different BoIFNs act synergistically. Thus, this adverse effect can be easily avoided under therapeutic or prophylactic situations.\n\nPharmaco-kinetically the 2 rBoIFNs also differ, in that maximum serum levels of IFN obtained with rBoIFN-~ are less than 20% of that seen with rBolFN-~ regardless of whether it is administered intravenously or intramuscularly. Whether this reflects the kinetics of binding to cells remains to be elucidated. If so, then BolFN-y may prove to be effective more rapidly than BolFN-%. Preliminary results suggest that this may indeed be the case (unpublished data). Based on these observations, studies need to be conducted with respect to timing of treatment as well as dose or dose combinations. This may be especially important in such infections as bovine respiratory diseases where different effects would be needed for induction of activity to the viruses, and bacteria that are involved in this disease complex. This is especially true when BHV-1 is employed as in vivo test virus, because of the apparent negligible effect of IFN on viral replication in the nasal cavity [10,11,34--36,110,113] . Thus, other parameters such as the overall clinical performance (i.e., severity and duration of symptoms) of the animal may prove a better measure of the value of IFN-therapy [11] , at least as it applies to bovine respiratory disease.\n\nA single treatment with either rBolFN-eq or -y appears to be just as effective as multiple applications in prevention of Shipping Fever symptoms, providing the treatment is given 36-48 h prior to virus-exposure [11 and unpublished data]. More effective and longer protection may be required under field conditions where timing of infection may not always be known. It is possible that various delivery systems, including slow release mechanisms may have to be developed. Whether this will lead to a refractory state or have an adverse effect on the overall immune system needs careful consideration.\n\nA second economically important disease where active immunization is not feasible is in neonatal diarrhea. In this instance the disease occurs within the first 2-3 wk of life. This disease is caused by a wide variety of different agents including rotavirus, coronavirus, breda virus, astroviruses, caliciviruses, parvoviruses, and possibly other unidentified viral agents, as well as enterotoxigenic E. coli. The only feasible methods of controlling these agents involve oral feeding of specific antibody containing milk or monoclonal antibodies against either the bacteria or the specific viruses [6b]. Since there are so many different viruses presently identified as agents involved in induction of neonatal diarrhea, specific chemotherapeutic methods do not appear to have any potential role in inhibiting virus replication. Thus IFN, with its broad spectrum of antiviral activity, appears to be the ideal candidate for making cells refractory to virus infection and therefore, could dramatically reduce economic losses due to neonatal diarrhea. At present there is at least one report [120] wherein intramuscular treatment of calves with human IFNet decreased symptoms of rotavirus diarrhea, but did not alter virus excretion. These initial observations appear promising and hopefully improvements in efficacy could be achieved by better administration methods and doses. Since all of the agents causing neonatal calf diarrhea are generally restricted to the intestinal epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract, it is possible that administration of the IFN into the intestinal tract to provide a refractory antiviral state, would even prove to be more efficacious than systemic administration. This is especially important since all of these viruses produce diarrhea very rapidly and the disease process is very localized. However, before these types of studies can be accepted in the field, considerable experimentation will have to be conducted to determine whether IFN application locally in the intestine will alter gut physiology and whether replication of the crypt cells will be affected [86] . If this occurs, IFN may itself induce diarrhea or alter adsorption as well as influence the immune system. Another consideration that must be taken into account in the treatment of calves with IFN against enteric infections, is that the refractory state will have to be maintained for approximately 3 wk, until a time when most calves have reached an age where their susceptibility to these enteric infections is reduced. In order to achieve this continued refractory state, sufficient levels of IFN will have to be maintained in the gut for extended periods. It also remains to be determined whether the IFN can withstand the proteolytic enzymes within the jejunum and ileum, the site where the majority of the viruses replicate. If the proteolytic enzymes do degrade IFN, then novel approaches of systemic release and transport to the intestinal surface over extended periods will be required. Thus, it is evident that many questions still need to be addressed before the application of IFN in neonatal diarrhea can be used with guarantee for efficacy and security.\n\nThe majority of enteric viruses which cause neonatal diarrhea in calves are not easy to cultivate in vitro; therefore, very little information regarding their potential susceptibility to IFN is available. At present, there is evidence that bovine rotavirus show little susceptibility to the direct antiviral effects of IFN [4, 38, 69] .\n\nHowever, it appears that in vivo treatment of calves with IFN is efficacious against rotaviruses. Thus, there may not always be a direct correlation between in vitro sensitivity of viruses to IFN and the clinical effect of IFN. This has already been clearly demonstrated with BHV-1 [11] . Hence, it appears that all of these individual viruses will have to be tested in in vivo situations before any concrete statements can be made about the potential value of IFN treatment in reduction of the wide spectrum of viruses causing neonatal diarrhea in calves. However, the availability of sufficient quantities of IFN and animal model systems reproducing neonatal diarrhea in calves, should make such studies feasible in the near future.\n\nInvestigations covering all aspects of the bovine IFN system are now well under way, and the results obtained within the last few years with respect to the use of rBolFNs in the control of some diseases appear encouraging. However, these trials should now also be extended to include other important infections of cattle. In ad-dition to the viral infections, with or without secondary bacterial infections, rBoIFNs may prove useful against infections due to chlamydia, rickettsia or other intracellular parasites [63, 64, 97] . Infections in cattle with these agents also have potentials as animal models for corresponding human diseases. The studies of the mechanisms whereby the rBoIFNs confer protection, including the immuno-mod-u|ating effects, should of course continue in parallel with clinical evaluations and could by themselves contribute significantly to the knowledge concerning IFN activity in general.\n\nOther therapeutic strategies may also be considered for evaluation. In vitro it has been shown that IFN and virus-specific antibody (VAb) can act synergistically to inhibit various virus types [71] . The effect is probably related to 1) the ability of VAb to retard extracellular spread of virus and to reduce the multiplicity of infection, thus allowing more time for IFN to act, and 2) the ability of IFN to protect uninfected cells and reduce virus yields from infected cells, thus making even low levels of VAb protective. Different virus types may differ in their sensitivity to the VAb-IFN combinations, depending on the IFN type [71] . However, with the two new tools, monoclonal antibodies and recombinant DNA produced IFNs, investigations of various permutations should be possible. Thus, this strategy certainly lends itself for exploitation not only for prevention, but also for therapy of virus infections.\n\nThus, we are probably far from having tapped all the resources of the IFN system. Other potentials may still await discovery, and exciting and useful results may be ahead of us in the control of infectious diseases in man and animals which we have not envisaged at present."}
