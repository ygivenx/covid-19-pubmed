Predicting the public health impact of pathogens with recently acquired human-tohuman transmissibility is a challenge. Currently, the fate of COVID-19 remains unclear;\n\nunderstanding the likely age and seasonal profiles of infection risks will be critical to inform effective surveillance and control strategies.\n\n.

The infection incidence and levels of severe illness associated with COVID-19 remains unclear. In this instance, epidemiological data on seasonal human coronaviruses (sCoVs) may provide valuable information about individuals and seasonal conditions favored by an invading coronavirus.\n\nTo date, emergent zoonotic human coronaviruses associated with high case-fatality ratios have not achieved persistence in the human population. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and spread rapidly around the globe before being successfully contained in 2003 [2] . Conversely, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has continued to cause sporadic cases predominantly in healthcare settings since its discovery in 2012, but has not demonstrated sustained community transmission [3] . In contrast, CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, CoV-OC43 and CoV-HKU1 are common cocirculating sCoVs predominantly associated with mild infection of the upper respiratory tract [4] .\n\nA key determinant governing the invasion and persistence success of a new pathogen is the abundance of susceptible hosts. Such population susceptibility may be difficult to define due to pre-existing cross-protective immunity in individuals previously exposed to antigenically related pathogens, as demonstrated for pandemic influenza A H1N1 in 2009 [5] . Furthermore, the potential for heterologous interactions among taxonomically broad groups of respiratory viruses is also recognized [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . A good epidemiological understanding of cocirculating viruses will provide valuable information on the potential for immune, or otherwise mediated, virus-virus interactions and consequences for population susceptibility.\n\nTo date, epidemiological knowledge surrounding sCoVs has been limited for many settings owing to their historic association with mild illness. However, some laboratories have adopted .

We previously reported on the comparative epidemiologies of acute viral respiratory infections, and the potential for virus-virus interactions, based on multiplex RT-PCR testing in the West of Scotland [6, 16] . Here we provide further detail on sCoVs differentiated at the species level (sCoV types) over an extended timeframe and discuss key potential implications for COVID-19 virus emergence in Scotland, United Kingdom (UK).\n\nRoutine molecular testing for CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63 using multiplex real-time episodes of respiratory illness, 10,438 were not tested for coronavirus (98% during the three major waves of pandemic influenza) and thus were excluded from analyses centered on sCoVs [18] . Among the remaining 74,519 episodes of illness, a further 278 were either tested for CoV-HKU1 or the coronavirus was untyped; these episodes were excluded from analyses differentiating sCoV type. See Figure 1 for a summary of the data subsets.\n\nOf 74,241 patient episodes of respiratory illness with sCoV subtyping, 8,912 patients experienced multiple episodes over the study timeframe. In such cases, we retained the first observed episode to remove patient-level clustering, leaving 56,276 patient observations for analysis ( Figure 1 ). We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate associations between each sCoV type (CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63) and patient age (categorical), season (categorical). Statistical interactions between patient covariates and healthcare service were assessed. An alpha level of 5% was used to determine statistical significance of all model coefficients. The fitted models, incorporating age-healthcare service interactions were used to generate average predicted probabilities of virus detection by age and healthcare setting.\n\nIn addition, we used multivariable logistic regression to investigate interactions between each sCoV and other groups of respiratory viruses at the within-host scale. These analyses were based on 16,991 virus-positive episodes of respiratory illness, retaining the first observed episode of illness for patients with multiple episodes. Virus-negative patients were excluded to .

Specifically, these analyses tested whether the odds of a given virus ('exposed') coinfecting with a given sCoV differed from the average odds among the remaining groups of viruses ('non-exposed'), thereby assessing non-random mixing among the virus population.\n\nThree models were fitted, one for each of CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63 (response variables). The analyses adjusted for patient age, sex, primary or secondary/tertiary healthcare service, time period with respect to pandemic influenza (as above), and the monthly background prevalence of the sCoV (response variable) to eliminate spurious virus-virus associations owing to unrelated sources of seasonality. Holm's method was used to correct pvalues for multiple comparisons (ten virus-virus interaction hypotheses per model).\n\nAll analyses were conducted in R software version 3.4.4 [20] . Logistic regression modelling was conducted using the 'glm' function and predicted probabilities were computed using 'ggaverage' from the 'ggeffects' package [21] .\n\nAmong 84,957 episodes of respiratory illness, 79.0% were sampled at secondary/tertiary healthcare services (hospital inpatients and outpatients), and 21.0% from primary healthcare services (general practice [GP]). The sex distribution was approximately equal, with 51.6% of patients' female, and the median age was 33.1y (IQR; 1 st quartile -3 rd quartile=5.6y-59.1y).\n\nSeasonal coronaviruses (sCoVs) were detected in 4.0% (2,958/74,519) of tested patients overall, contributing to 10.7% (2,958/27,734) of all respiratory virus detections. Figure 2 summarizes the contribution of sCoVs to the total viral detections in the patient population .

The most prevalent detection was CoV-OC43, both pre-and post-pandemic (supplementary Table S1 ). CoV-HKU1 was present at a very low prevalence of 0.3% overall (124 out of 36,652 episodes tested until the assay was discontinued in 2012) and was therefore excluded from further analyses.\n\nDespite a greater number of sCoV detections among patients admitted to hospital, the prevalence among those tested was greater among patients attending GP's (5.3%; 673/12,670) than hospitals (3.7%; 2,285/61,849). Figure 3 summarizes age distributions. Cases of sCoV in children under five and the elderly were disproportionately represented among patients admitted to hospital, compared to a more uniform distribution among GP attendees, closely following the overall tested population ( Figure 3A) . A different sex bias was found among adults depending on the healthcare setting; more female cases (primary care) versus males (secondary/tertiary care) ( Figure 3B ). This pattern was consistent when comparing % detections among positive patients across sCoV types: 59.2% (CoV-229E), 55.6% (CoV-OC43) and 59.8%\n\n(CoV-NL63) of cases detected in primary care were female, whilst 54.7% (CoV-229E), 51.1%\n\n.

The age-specific prevalences of sCoVs among the tested population are summarized in supplementary Tables S3-S4; a greater variation across ages was found for CoV-229E (Coefficient of Variation\n\n[CV]=40.4%) and CoV-NL63 (CV=33.8%) compared to CoV-OC43 (CV=13.6%) for primary care, with less variation for secondary/tertiary care (CV=29.96% for CoV-229E and CV=28.0%\n\nfor CoV-NL63, compared to CV=17.10% for CoV-OC43).\n\nStatistical modelling analyses further confirmed differences in age and sex associations according to sCoV type, and a greater chance of sCoV detection among GP attendees than patients admitted to hospital (supplementary Tables S5-S7). No evidence of significant effect modification between patient age or sex and healthcare service setting was found (statistical interaction terms p>0.05; results not shown). Figure 4 summarizes average age-specific predicted probabilities with statistical interactions incorporated. In summary, we observed a trend towards increasing probability of CoV-229E with age ( Figure 4A ), greater probabilities of CoV-OC43 at the extremities of age ( Figure 4B ), and decreasing probability of CoV-NL63 with age ( Figure 4C ). These age patterns were broadly consistent across patient sex and healthcare settings; although we note that 95% confidence intervals overlapped across all ages except for the hospital setting. A borderline significant sex effect was found for CoV-229E, with detections more likely among males (supplementary Table S5 ).\n\n.

Figure 5 shows the monthly prevalences of sCoVs detected among the patient population.\n\nThese are winter pathogens in the UK, on average peaking between January and March.\n\nHowever, there were notable variations between sCoV types and between years. Overall, CoV-OC43 was the most prevalent detection among the tested population in each influenza season.\n\nDifferences were also observed in periodicities; prior to the first wave of pandemic influenza in 2009, CoV-229E peaked biennially, but subsequently exhibited longer inter-peak periods, particularly between 2013 and 2016.\n\nIn contrast, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63 generally exhibit annual periodicity of varying magnitude.\n\nA considerable degree of synchrony is observed in the timing of the peak prevalence of CoV- \n\nThe cocirculation of sCoVs with other common respiratory raises the potential for ecological interactions, altering infection risks and the dynamics of population transmission. Our data did not permit analysis of potential within-host interactions among different sCoVs because of an absence of sCoV coinfections. We did, however, evaluate the potential for within-host interactions between sCoVs and other common respiratory viruses.\n\nTo do so, we analyzed the non-random mixing of respiratory viruses among virus-positive patients using multivariable logistic regression. We found a greater propensity for CoV-OC43 to coinfect with RSV (OR=1.68, 95% CI=1.05-2.63, uncorrected p=0.027), AdV (OR=2.93, 95%\n\n.

The associations with AdV and PIV3 were supported following correction of p-values for multiple comparisons (p<0.001 and p=0.036 respectively).\n\nNo evidence of interactions with other respiratory viruses was found for either CoV-229E or CoV-NL63. Assessment of parainfluenza virus (PIV) types was limited by small numbers of coinfections; these viruses were aggregated at the genus level for the CoV-229E analysis, and PIV2 was excluded from the CoV-NL63 analysis. See supplementary Tables S9-S10 for details.\n\nThe finding for PIVB must be treated with caution owing to 95% CI overlapping 1. Average agespecific predicted probabilities of sCoV coinfection for individuals with and without coinfection with each specific respiratory virus is given in Table 1 .\n\nThe likely long-term impact of the recently emerged COVID-19 is a topic currently shrouded in uncertainty for countries worldwide. At the time of writing, global cases are mounting, with evidence of community transmission for a growing number of countries. In the absence of setting-specific data, an epidemiological understanding of related and unrelated co-circulating pathogens is prudent to guide preliminary estimates of who is at risk and when, and to develop research priorities pertaining to population susceptibility. Epidemiological knowledge of seasonal human coronaviruses (sCoVs) is lacking for many settings due to an absence of inclusion in routine diagnostic testing. Here, we described several key features of sCoVs based on a unique dataset derived from multiplex PCR diagnostic testing of a large, well-defined population over a thirteen year period.\n\nIt is well known that sCoVs cocirculate endemically with other common respiratory viruses, and coinfections are frequently observed [11, 12, 16] . In the West of Scotland, sCoVs typically peak .

The common occurrence of sCoVs during periods of high influenza activity highlights the importance of considering these viruses in the differential diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. This is particularly pertinent in the context of COVID-19 emergence; cocirculating viruses are associated with a broad spectrum of clinical presentation overlapping that of COVID-19, raising the potential for a large number of undiagnosed or misclassified cases in settings lacking the capacity for multiplexed testing. Currently in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Scotland, the majority of COVID-19 testing is being conducted in the hospital setting, where all cases of respiratory illness are simultaneously tested for influenza, RSV, adenovirus and mycoplasma pneumoniae using a multiplex panel, and severely ill patients receive a full multiplex that includes sCoVs.\n\nSex-specific numbers of sCoV differed by healthcare setting; we observed a trend towards female sCoV cases for primary care, but male sCoV cases for secondary/tertiary care. This finding may reflect sex differences in healthcare seeking behaviors and/or illness severity. In terms of sex differences in detection odds (a proxy for infection risk), a statistically significant sex effect was found for CoV-229E, with a greater odds among males than females. This finding is consistent with previous reports of a male bias for CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63 among the hospital setting [12] , and in relation to influenza hospitalizations and mortality in the context of acute respiratory infections more generally [22, 23] . It has been proposed that differences in sex hormones may explain variation in respiratory infection susceptibility, with testosterone exerting an immunosuppressive effect in males, and with estrogen playing a protective role in females [24, 25] . We note however our analyses do not control for potential confounding factors such as smoking or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n.

This pattern is consistent with overall testing trends, and may therefore reflect the healthcare seeking behavior of concerned parents, clinician testing practices, and/or the burden of other respiratory agents, rather than a greater risk of infection. However, it should be borne in mind that these analyses were based on a patient population; the true community burden of mild and/or asymptomatic infections is likely to be much higher [26] . When aggregated into epidemiological groupings, age-specific probabilities of virus detection varied across sCoV types.\n\nIn contrast to that observed for sCoVs, there are relatively few COVID-19 cases thus far in children [27] . In the context of our study population, COVID-19 is closely related to CoV-OC43 (both betacoronaviruses), the most prevalent sCoV detection among patients under five. It is possible that pre-existing cross-immunity confers protection and/or attenuates the severity of COVID-19 leading to fewer tested/hospitalized children. The comparatively lower proportion positive and detection odds for school-aged children compared to younger children may potentially reflect a sustained level of CoV-OC43 immune-mediated protection, whereas waned immunity is expected to leave adults more vulnerable to coronavirus infections [27] . Assuming some degree of cross-immunity with COVID-19, our data are consistent with an expected fewer cases of COVID-19 in children but more cases among the adult population. Immunosenescence may exacerbate low levels of protective immunity in the elderly [29, 30] .\n\nThree key features of our data seemingly support the proposition of cross-immunity. Firstly, the contrasting age patterns of detection probabilities between closely related CoV-229E and CoV-NL63 (both alphacoronaviruses) may reflect niche segregation. Secondly, closely related CoV-229E and CoV-NL63 also displayed asynchronous seasonality, in contrast to CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63, supporting a competition dynamic. Although our data did not permit in depth .

Thirdly, coinfections among sCoVs were not recorded in this study population, although detected by others albeit at a very low frequency [12] . More work is needed to establish whether low coinfection frequency among sCoVs supports an immune-mediated competition for hosts, or whether this reflects a limitation of diagnostic data which only captures a snapshot of an individual's infection.\n\nTo our knowledge, evidence of immunological cross-protection between human coronaviruses is lacking, and reports of antigenic cross-reactivity are inconsistent. The potential for serological cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and sCoVs has been shown by some [28, 29] but not others [30] . And although confinement of cross-reactivity at the coronavirus genus level is possible, consistent with the greater genetic relatedness of these viruses [31, 32] , more general cross-reactivity between CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E has also been found [33] . Population serological surveys will be critical for establishing the true burden and age distribution of sCoV infections in the community and the potential for cross-protective immunity.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that the implications of population levels of cross-immunity are likely to vary according to the local epidemiological context. We note the predominance of CoV-OC43 detections previously observed in a comparatively urban but different Scottish patient population [14], a pattern more generally consistent at the Scottish national level [27] . Other trends observed within our study population are consistent with the Scottish national level, such as peak levels of CoV-229E detection in 2010 coinciding with low levels of CoV-NL63 and CoV-OC43 [27] . A predominance of CoV-OC43 has also been observed in Sweden [16] , suggesting a potential consistency in sCoV dominance over wider geographical areas. However, differences are also apparent; for example, the relatively common detection of CoV-HKU1 in a .

In previous extensive analyses of virus-virus interactions, we found a strong signal of positive interactions at the within-host scale between human coronaviruses overall and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (AdV) and parainfluenza viruses (combining types 1 and 3; human respirovirus genus) [6] . Here, our more in-depth analysis corroborates positive interactions at the sCoV type level. For CoV-OC43, the most prevalent in this study population, our results support our earlier findings of a higher propensity of coinfection with RSV, AdV and PIV3 than with other respiratory viruses. Note, these analyses were based on routine diagnostic testing and therefore the directionality of effects could not be determined. The association with RSV was not supported following a correction for multiple comparisons, although previous studies also report a high proportion of sCoV coinfections with RSV [12, 34] . The role of viral coinfections in the severity of acute respiratory illness remains a controversial topic [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] .\n\nFurther work is needed to establish the role of viral coinfections in COVID-19 severity.\n\nThe public health impact of COVID-19 is likely to vary according to the epidemiological context and healthcare infrastructure of the population. Our findings suggest continued monitoring of cocirculating respiratory viruses will be important for guiding accurate case ascertainment, research priorities surrounding population susceptibility, and for assessing the comparative population and healthcare burden of COVID-19 in the context of multiple cocirculating respiratory pathogens. Further work is needed to identify the mechanism of interactions between human coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses, and the role of viral coinfections in COVID-19 severity and burden.\n\n.
