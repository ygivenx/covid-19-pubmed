{"title": "Vulnerabilities in coronavirus glycan shields despite extensive glycosylation", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped pathogens responsible for multiple respiratory disorders of varying severity in humans 1 These trimeric S proteins mediate host cell entry with the S1 and S2 subunits responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and facilitating membrane fusion, respectively [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . MERS S binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) 18 , whereas SARS S 19 and 2019-nCoV 20 utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host cellular receptor. CoV S proteins are the largest class I viral fusion proteins known 15 , and are extensively glycosylated, with SARS and MERS S glycoproteins both encoding 69 N-linked glycan sequons per trimeric spike with 2019-nCoV containing 66 sites. These extensive post-translational modifications often mask immunogenic protein epitopes from the host humoral immune system by occluding them with host-derived glycans 21, 22 . This phenomenon of immune evasion by molecular mimicry and glycan shielding has been observed and well characterised across other viral glycoproteins, such as HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) [23] [24] [25] , influenza hemagglutinin (HA) [26] [27] [28] and Lassa virus glycoprotein complex (LASV GPC) [29] [30] [31] .\n\nPrevious analyses of viral glycan shields have revealed the presence of underprocessed oligomannose-type glycans that seemingly arise due to steric constraints that prevent access of glycan processing enzymes to substrate glycans 29, 32, 33 , especially when the viral glycoprotein has evolved to mask immunogenic epitopes with a particularly dense array of host-derived glycans 31, 34 . Restricted access to these glycan sites or interference with surrounding protein surface or neighbouring glycan residues can render glycan processing enzymes ineffective in specific regions 32, 33, 35 . Glycan processing on soluble glycoproteins has also been shown to be a strong reporter of native-like protein architecture and thus immunogen . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Molecular evolution analysis of SARS and MERS S genes also reveals a higher incidence of amino-acid diversity on the exposed surfaces of the S proteins that are not occluded by N-linked glycans. Additionally, we compare the structures of the respective glycan coats of SARS and HIV-1 envelope proteins using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and computational modelling, which delineate a sparse glycan shield exhibited on SARS S compared to other viral glycoproteins. We therefore undertook a comparative analysis of viral glycan shields from characterized class I fusion proteins to highlight how glycosylation density influences oligomannose-type glycan abundance, and the relationship between effective glycan shields and viral evasion ability. Together, these data underscore the importance of glycosylation in viral immune evasion.\n\n. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

SARS, MERS and HKU1 S genes encode a large number of N-linked glycan sequons 23, 23 and 29, respectively (Fig. 1A) . We initially sought to quantitatively assess the composition of the carbohydrate structures displayed on the S glycoproteins. To this end, N-linked glycans were enzymatically released, fluorescently labelled, and subjected to hydrophilic interaction chromatography-ultra-performance liquid chromatography (HILIC-UPLC). Cleavage of the fluorescently labelled glycans by endoglycosidase H (Endo H) revealed a population (SARS 32.2%; MERS 33.8%, HKU1 25.0%) of under-processed oligomannose-type glycans (Fig. 1B) . This observation of both complex and oligomannose-type glycans reveals that the majority of N-linked glycans are able to be processed, although there is limited processing at specific sites across the S proteins. It is also interesting to note that the distribution of oligomannose-type glycans was broad, with\n\nMan5GlcNAc2 to Man9GlcNAc2 glycans all present, without one particular dominant peak, as is the case for some viral glycoproteins, such as HIV-1 Env 36 In order to ascertain the precise structures of N-linked glycans from the released pool, the glycans of each coronavirus S protein were analysed by negative-ion ion-mobilityelectrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (IM-ESI MS) ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Consistent with the UPLC data, IM-ESI MS confirmed an array of complex-type glycans ranging from mono-to tetra-antennary, but also oligomannose-and hybrid-type glycans. The glycan compositions characterised in the spectra were largely invariant among the coronaviruses with no major structural differences observed. Oligomannose-type glycans (M5 to M9; Man5GlcNAc2-Man9GlcNAc2) (green) and complex-type glycans (magenta) were identified by Endo H digestion, with quantification of major glycan types summarised as a pie chart. Oligomannose-type glycans are schematically annotated with mannose residues as green circles and GlcNAc residues as blue squares.\n\nFollowing UPLC and IM-ESI MS analysis of released N-linked glycans, we performed glycopeptide analysis to ascertain the compositions of glycans present at all of the potential Nlinked glycosylation sites (PNGs). MERS, SARS and HKU1 recombinant S proteins were reduced, alkylated and digested with an assortment of proteases to yield glycopeptides, which were subjected to in-line liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This analysis revealed that each site presents differential levels of oligomannose, hybrid, and complex-type glycan populations ( Fig. 2A & 2B ). Using structures of the trimeric MERS and SARS S proteins (PDB ID: 5X59 and 5X58, respectively), we generated models of fully glycosylated coronavirus spikes using our experimentally determined glycan compositions ( Fig. 3A and   3B ). This analysis revealed that underprocessed oligomannose-type glycans on MERS S colocalize to a specific cluster on the head of the S protein, consisting of glycans at Asn155, Asn166, and Asn236 (Fig. 3A) . We hypothesized that the fully oligomannose-type glycan . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

As such, we performed mutagenesis to knock out glycosylation sites with N155A, N166A, and N236A mutations. Site-specific analysis of these glycan-KO mutants revealed enhanced trimming of mannose residues, i.e. increased processing, when clustering of glycans was reduced (SI Fig. 4) . The presence of clustered oligomannose-type glycans is reminiscent of that found on other viral glycoproteins, including HIV-1 Env and LASV GPC 29, 36, 46 .\n\nInterestingly, SARS and HKU1 (SI Fig. 2 ) S proteins did not exhibit a specific mannose cluster that contributes to the overall mannose abundance, but rather only isolated glycans were underprocessed. We would speculate that the oligomannose-type glycans here arise from protein-directed inhibition of glycan processing, as opposed to the glycan-influenced processing observed on MERS. The presence of oligomannose-type glycans has also been implicated in innate immune recognition of coronaviruses by lectins 47,48 that recognise these underprocessed glycans as pathogen-associated molecular patterns.\n\nGiven that the receptor binding domain is the main target of neutralising antibodies 12 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.957472 doi: bioRxiv preprint The modelling of the experimentally observed glycosylation is illustrated on the pre-fusion structure of trimeric MERS S (PDB ID 5X59) 17 and SARS S (PDB ID 5X58) 17 glycoproteins. The glycans are colored according to oligomannose content, as defined by the key. DPP4 receptor binding sites and ACE2 receptor binding sites for MERS and SARS, respectively, are indicated in light blue. The S1 and S2 subunits are colored light grey and dark grey, respectively.\n\nWe hypothesized that solvent-accessible, amino-acid residues on S proteins would be undergoing higher rates of mutations compared to buried residues and regions that are occluded by glycans, which are unable to be targeted by host immune responses. To that end, we performed an evaluation of amino-acid diversification on a residue-specific level, using publicly available gene sequences of SARS and MERS S. Firstly, we found that amino-acid diversity was elevated at known epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies, such as the N-. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Buried residues on SARS had mean dN/dS ratios of 0.31 compared to 2.82 for exposed resides. Likewise, the buried residues on MERS had a calculated dN/dS ratio of 0.10 compared to exposed residues with a value of 0.45. Furthermore, when per-site aminoacid diversities were mapped onto the fully glycosylated structural model of the respective CoV S proteins (Fig. 4C) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.957472 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nHIV-1 Env is a prototypic viral class I fusion protein that exhibits extensive surface glycosylation, resulting in an effective glycan shield to aid evasion from the host adaptive immune response 25, 52 . In order to visualize the structure of the respective glycan \"shields\" of HIV-1 and SARS coronavirus, we used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), as recently described 53 . The results for HIV-1 Env were reproduced from Berndsen et al. 53 while the previously published SARS 2P dataset 54 was reprocessed for this study. Although cryo-EM datasets of fully glycosylated MERS S 41 and chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) 55 are also available, only the HIV and SARS data were of sufficient quality (Fig. 5) . Using combination of low-pass filtering and thresholding, along with 3D variability analysis, we can reveal the previously hidden structure of the SARS glycan shield and compare it with the HIV-1 Env glycan shield 53 (Fig. 5) . We observe the nearly all-encompassing glycan density on HIV-1 Env and evidence for extensive glycan-glycan interactions, especially in the oligomannose patch regions, whereas the glycans on SARS S are more isolated and lack the wide-ranging glycan networks that are the hallmark of an effective glycan shield 56, 57 . The high variability around the S1 receptor binding domains is indicative of their flexibility, which is necessary for the spike to engage its receptor 58 ; however, this intrinsic property complicates the analysis of the signal from glycans in this region.\n\n.

However, given the significantly larger protein surface area and volume of coronavirus S proteins, coverage of the glycan \"shield\" over the proteinaceous surface is considerably sparser in comparison to the smaller LASV GPC, which occludes a far greater proportion of the protein surface with fewer glycans. To demonstrate that the presence of glycosylation plays a major role in the immune response to these different glycoproteins, we studied the glycome of several biomedically important coronaviruses and compared their glycan compositions in a structural context.\n\nWe then investigated the glycan shield densities of seven viral class I fusion proteins using a global structural approach which was calculated by dividing the number of amino-acids that interact with glycans by the number of solvent-accessible amino-acid residues of each respective glycoprotein and plotted this against oligomannose abundance. A strong correlation was observed (Fig. 6 ) and viruses historically classified as \"evasion strong\" 59 had significantly elevated glycan shield densities and oligomannose abundance, which underscores the importance of glycan shielding in immune evasion. Fig. 5 ). The number of amino-acid residues interacting with N-linked glycans was divided by the number of solventaccessible amino-acid residues of the glycoprotein as a measure for global glycan shield density. All viral glycoproteins analysed were expressed as trimers in HEK 293F cells apart from LASV GPC, which was derived from virus-like particles from Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells.\n\nWhether the restricted glycan shielding observed on coronaviruses is linked to the zoonosis of the pathogens is unknown. However, it is tempting to speculate, for example, that MERS has not evolved a dense shield since it would not offer as much of a protective advantage against camel nanobodies (also known as single-domain antibodies) which could more easily penetrate it. Investigation of the host immune response to viruses in their natural reservoirs may offer a route to understanding why coronavirus glycosylation does not reach the density of other viruses such as HIV-1. Additionally, it may be that functional constraints, such as maintaining flexibility of the receptor binding domains, limit the accretion of glycans on .

This phenomenon has been observed on other viral glycoproteins, including influenza HAs, where there is a limit to the accumulation of glycosylation sites that can be incorporated in vivo 64, 65 , compared to in vitro 66 , with H3N2 and H1N1 HAs replacing existing PNGs rather than continually adding them upon the glycoprotein 26, 65 .\n\nMore topically, it is interesting to note the conservation of N-linked glycosylation sites on S proteins from the novel coronavirus found in the Wuhan in 2019 and SARS (SI Fig. 6 ).\n\nThe Wuhan 2019-nCoV possesses a total of 22 N-linked glycan sites compared to 23 on SARS, with 18 of these sites being in common. As such, it is likely that these glycans on this novel coronavirus would shield similar immunogenic epitopes that are observed on SARS S. As expected, most of the differences between the two viruses are observed on the S1 subunit, due to its amenability to substitutions whilst still remaining functionally competent. Furthermore, likely targets for the majority of antibodies targeting the spike are located on S1, resulting in greater levels of immune pressure upon this subunit. This notion is further reflected in terms of glycosylation, with all of the glycan sites conserved on the S2 subunit between SARS and 2019-nCoV, whereas the S1 subunit exhibits glycan site additions and deletions (SI Fig. 7) .\n\nAlthough it is difficult to directly compare viruses in terms of immunogenic responses, on the one hand, SARS and MERS coronaviruses readily elicit neutralizing antibodies following infection or immunization [67] [68] [69] [70] . Indeed, many potential MERS CoV vaccine candidates are able to elicit high titres of serum IgG upon immunization but fail to produce sufficient mucosal immunity 70 . In contrast, the high mutation rate 71 and the evolving glycan shield of HIV-1 24 , which firmly exemplifies it as \"evasion strong\" virus, hinders the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies 72 .Viruses classified as \"evasion strong\" 31, 59 may then differ due to varied efficacies of protein surface shielding by glycans.\n\nOverall, this study reveals how the extensive N-linked glycan modifications of SARS and MERS CoV S proteins do not constitute an effective shield, which is reflected by the overall structure, density and oligomannose abundances across the trimeric glycoproteins. We also demonstrate that amino-acid diversification indeed occurs at antibody accessible regions on the trimer, which confirms that glycans play a role in occluding specific regions if vulnerability on the glycoprotein.

H3N2 Victoria 2011 hemagglutinin was also expressed in the HEK 293F cells. Cultures were harvested 6 days after transfection, filtered and purified by nickelaffinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex TM 16/600 75 pg column (GE Healthcare).\n\nExcised coronavirus S gel bands were washed alternately with acetonitrile and water before drying in a vacuum centrifuge. The bands were rehydrated with 100 \u03bcL of water and incubated with PNGase F at 37 \u00b0C overnight. Aliquots of released N-linked glycans were also fluorescently labelled with procainamide, by adding 100 \u03bcL of labelling mixture (110 mg/mL procainamide and 60 mg/mL sodium cyanoborohydrate in 70% DMSO and 30% glacial acetic acid) and incubating for 4h at 65 \u00b0C. Labelled glycans were purified using Spe-ed Amide 2 columns (Applied Separations), as previously described 33 .\n\nLabelled glycans were analysed using a 2.1 mm x 10 mm Acquity BEH Glycan column (Waters) on an Acquity H-Class UPLC instrument (Waters), as performed previously 33 , with fluorescence measurements occurring at \u03bbex = 310 nm and \u03bbem = 370 nm. Quantification of oligomannose-type glycans was achieved by digestion of fluorescently labelled glycans with Endo H, and clean-up using a PVDF protein-binding membrane (Millipore). Empower 3 software (Waters) was used for data processing.\n\nIon-mobility electrospray ionisation MS and tandem MS of released N-linked glycans were performed on a Synapt G2Si instrument (Waters) as previously described 46 .

Proteins were proteolytically digested with trypsin (Promega), chymotrypsin (Promega), alpha-lytic protease (Sigma-Aldrich) and Glu-C (Promega). Reaction mixtures were dried and peptides/glycopeptides were extracted using C18 Zip-tip (MerckMilipore) following the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid prior to analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using an Easy-nLC 1200 system with the same amino-acid sequence, were compared to determine the relative quantitation of glycoforms at each specific N-linked glycan site.\n\nStructural models of N-linked glycan presentation on SARS, MERS and HKU1 S were created using electron microscopy structures (PDB ID 5X58, 5X59, and 5I08, respectively) 15,17 , along with complex-, hybrid-, and oligomannose-type N-linked glycans (PDB ID 4BYH, 4B7I, and 2WAH).

Final alignments for SARS-and MERS-CoV corresponded to 70 and 100 sequences, respectively.\n\nFor the dN/dS analysis, we first estimated Bayesian molecular clock phylogenies for SARSand MERS-CoV independently using BEAST v 1.8.4 75 . For both viruses, we assumed an uncorrelated log-normal distributed molecular clock 76 , Bayesian Skyline coalescent prior 77 and a codon-structured substitution model 78 Multiple independent MCMC runs of 10-20 million steps were executed to ensure stationarity and convergence had been achieved. Empirical distributions of time-scaled phylogenies were obtained by combining (after the removal of burnin) the posterior tree distributions from the separate runs, which were subsequently used to estimate dN/dS ratios using the renaissance counting approach 79,80 implemented in BEAST v 1.8.4. We also estimated per-site amino-acid diversity, which was calculated as the average number of amino-acid difference between two sequences at an amino-acid position in all possible pairs in the sequence alignment.\n\nSingle-particle cryo-EM data analysis of BG505 SOSIP.664 in complex with RM20A3 Fab was reproduced from Berndsen et al. 53 .
