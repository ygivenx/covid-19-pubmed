{"title": "Origins and Evolution of the Global RNA Virome", "body": "required for polymerase activity (21) (22) (23) . RdRps belong to the expansive class of polymerases containing so-called Palm catalytic domains along with the accessory Fingers and Thumb domains (24, 25) . In addition to viral RdRps, Palm domain polymerases include reverse transcriptases (RTs) of retroelements and reverse-transcribing viruses and the DNA polymerases that are responsible for genome replication in cellular organisms and diverse DNA viruses. Within the Palm domain class of proteins, RT and the \u03e9RNA virus RdRps are significantly similar in sequence and structure and appear to comprise a monophyletic group (22, (24) (25) (26) . More specifically, the highest similarity is observed between the \u03e9RNA virus RdRps and the RTs of group II introns. These introns are widespread retrotransposons in prokaryotes that are thought to be ancestral to the RTs of all other retrotransposons as well as retroviruses and pararetroviruses (recently jointly classified as the order Ortervirales) of eukaryotes (27) (28) (29) (30) .\n\nA phylogenetic analysis of the \u03e9RNA virus RdRps revealed only a distant relationship between the leviviruses and the bulk of the eukaryotic \u03e9RNA viruses, leaving the ancestral relationships uncertain (31) . The origin of eukaryotic \u03e9RNA viruses from their prokaryotic counterparts is an obvious possibility. However, given the dramatically greater prevalence of \u03e9RNA viruses among eukaryotes compared to the narrow spread of leviviruses and \"levi-like viruses\" in bacteria, an alternative scenario has been proposed. In this scenario, RdRps of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic \u03e9RNA viruses independently descended from distinct RTs (11, 31) . Among eukaryotic \u03e9RNA viruses, phylogenetic analysis of the RdRps strongly supports the existence of picornavirus and alphavirus \"supergroups,\" which are further validated by additional signature genes (7, 15) . However, both the exact compositions of these supergroups and the evolutionary relationships among many additional groups of viruses remain uncertain. Some RdRp phylogenies suggest a third supergroup combining animal \"flavi-like viruses\" and plant tombusviruses, but this unification is not supported by additional shared genes and thus remains tenuous (7, 15, 21) .\n\nThe similarity of RdRps among dsRNA viruses is limited, but these RdRps are similar to various degrees to \u03e9RNA virus RdRps. Therefore, different groups of dsRNA viruses might have evolved from different \u03e9RNA viruses independently, on multiple occasions (15, 32) . Although it is not entirely clear how prokaryotic dsRNA viruses fit into this concept, evidence of an evolutionary affinity between cystoviruses and reoviruses has been presented (33, 34) .\n\nFor a long time, the evolutionary provenance of \u03eaRNA virus RdRps remained uncertain due to their low sequence similarity to other RdRps and RTs (23) . However, recent protein structure comparisons point to a striking similarity between the RdRps of \u03eaRNA orthomyxoviruses and those of \u03e9RNA flaviviruses and dsRNA cystoviruses (35) . All these findings notwithstanding, the overall evolutionary relationships among the RdRps of \u03e9RNA, \u03eaRNA, and dsRNA viruses and RTs remain unresolved. In particular, whether the RdRps of \u03e9RNA and \u03eaRNA viruses are mono-or polyphyletic is unclear.\n\nMany deep evolutionary connections between RNA virus groups that were originally thought to be unrelated have been delineated using the results of pre-metagenomicera evolutionary studies. These discoveries culminated in the establishment of RNA virus supergroups (7, 9, 36) . However, the evolutionary provenance of many other RNA virus groups remained unclear, as did the relationships between the RNA viruses of the 3 Baltimore classes and retroelements and their ultimate origins. The prospects of substantial progress appeared dim because of the extreme sequence divergence among RNA viruses, which could amount to irrevocable loss of evolutionary information.\n\nRecent revolutionary developments in virus metagenomics (metaviromics) dramatically expanded knowledge of the diversity of RNA viruses and provided an unprecedented amount of sequence data for informed investigation into RNA virus evolution (11, 17, 37) . The foremost development was the massive expansion of the known invertebrate virome, which was achieved primarily through meta-transcriptome sequencing of various holobionts. The subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed previously unknown lineages of \u03e9RNA and \u03eaRNA viruses and prompted reconsideration of high-rank virus unifications, such as \u03e9RNA virus supergroups (14, (38) (39) (40) (41) . The RNA viromes of fungi and prokaryotes also underwent notable expansion, albeit it was not as extensive as that of invertebrates (13, 42, 43) .\n\nHere we reexamine the evolutionary relationships among and within the 3 Baltimore classes of RNA viruses through a comprehensive analysis of the available genomic and metagenomic sequences. In particular, to build a phylogenetic tree of thousands of viral RdRps, we designed an iterative computational procedure that alternates phylogeny construction with refinement of the underlying multiple alignments. Although RNA viruses have relatively short genomes (\u03f33 to 41 kb), the combined gene repertoire (pangenome) of these viruses includes numerous genes that are shared, to various degrees, by related subsets of RNA viruses. To obtain further insight into virus evolution, we therefore attempted to reconstruct the history of gain and loss of conserved proteins and domains in different virus lineages. We also investigated evolution of the single jelly-roll capsid protein (SJR-CP), the dominant type of capsid protein among \u03e9RNA viruses. Our analysis revealed patterns that are generally congruent with the RdRp phylogeny and provide further insights into the evolution of different branches of RNA viruses. Finally, we analyzed a bipartite network in which RNA virus genomes are connected via nodes representing virus genes (44, 45) to identify distinct modules in the RNA virosphere. The results shed light on the evolution of RNA viruses, revealing, in particular, the monophyly of \u03eaRNA viruses and their apparent origin from dsRNA viruses, which seem to have evolved from distinct branches of \u03e9RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions.\n\nComprehensive phylogeny of RNA virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases: overall structure of the tree and the 5 major branches. Amino acid sequences of RdRps and RTs were collected from the nonredundant National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database and analyzed using an iterative clustering-alignmentphylogeny procedure (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) (see Materials and Methods for details). This procedure ultimately yielded a single multiple alignment of the complete set of 4,617 virus RdRp sequences (see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material) and 1,028 RT sequences organized in 50 \u03e9 2 clusters (50 clusters of RdRps and 2 clusters of RTs; see Materials and Methods for details). This sequence set did not include RdRps of members of the families Birnaviridae and Permutatetraviridae, distinct groups of RNA viruses that encompass a circular permutation within the RdRp Palm domain (46) and therefore could not be confidently included in the alignment over their entire lengths.\n\nThe phylogenetic tree of RdRps and RTs ( Fig. 1 ; see also Data Set S2) was assembled from a set of trees that represent three hierarchical levels of relationships. At the lowest level, full complements of sequences from each cluster were used to construct clusterspecific trees. At the intermediate level, up to 15 representatives from each cluster were selected to elucidate supergroup-level phylogeny. At the highest level, up to 5 representatives from each cluster were taken to resolve global relationships (Data Set S3A and S4). The final tree (Data Set S2) was assembled by replacing the cluster representatives with the trees from the previous steps.\n\nThe large number and immense diversity of the viruses included in our analysis create serious challenges for a systematic, phylogeny-based nomenclature of the identified evolutionary lineages of RNA viruses. Many such lineages consist of viruses newly discovered by metaviromics and are not yet formally classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and therefore cannot be assigned formal names. For the purpose of the present work, we adopted a semiarbitrary naming scheme using the following approach. (i) We use taxon names that had been fully accepted by the ICTV as of March 2018 (47) whenever possible. These names are recognizable through their capitalization and italicization and rank-specific suffixes (e.g., -virales for orders and -viridae for families). As is the common practice in virus taxonomy, the officially classified members of each ICTV-approved taxon are referred to via vernacular designations (recognizable through their lack of capitalization and italicization). For instance, the members of the ICTV-approved order Bunyavirales are called bunyaviruses, whereas those of the family Tombusviridae are called tombusviruses. However, in this work, both taxon and vernacular terms are to be understood sensu lato: if our analysis indicates certain viruses to be members of or very closely related to an ICTV-established taxon, we consider them members of that taxon despite the lack of current ICTV recognition. As a result, the order Bunyavirales has more members in our analysis than in the official taxonomy. (ii) We use vernacular names in quotation marks for viruses/lineages that are clearly distinct from those covered by the official ICTV framework. Whenever possible, we use names that circulate in the literature (e.g., \"hepeliviruses,\" \"statoviruses\"). In the absence of such unofficial names, we name the lineage reminiscent of the next most closely related lineage (e.g., \"levi-like viruses\" are a clearly distinct sister group to Leviviridae/leviviruses). (iii) Monophyletic clusters that transcend the currently highest ICTV-accepted rank (i.e., order) are labeled according to terms circulating in the literature (i.e., \"alphavirus supergroup,\" \"flavivirus supergroup,\" and \"picornavirus supergroup\"). (iv) Lineages represented by a single virus are labeled with the respective virus name.\n\nRooting the phylogenetic tree, generated using PhyML (48) , between the RTs and RdRps resulted in a well-resolved topology of RNA viruses in which the tree splits into 5 major branches, each including a substantial diversity of viruses (Fig. 1) .\n\nBranch 1 consists of leviviruses and their eukaryotic relatives, namely, \"mitoviruses,\" \"narnaviruses,\" and \"ourmiaviruses\" (the latter three terms are placed in quotation marks as our analysis contradicts the current ICTV framework, which classifies mitoviruses and narnaviruses as members of one family, Narnaviridae, and ourmiaviruses as members of a free-floating genus, Ourmiavirus).\n\nBranch 2 (\"picornavirus supergroup\") consists of a large assemblage of \u03e9RNA viruses of eukaryotes, in particular, those of the orders Picornavirales and Nidovirales; the families Caliciviridae, Potyviridae, Astroviridae, and Solemoviridae, a lineage of dsRNA viruses that includes partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses; and several other, smaller groups of \u03e9RNA and dsRNA viruses.\n\nBranch 3 consists of a distinct subset of \u03e9RNA viruses, including the \"alphavirus supergroup\" along with the \"flavivirus supergroup,\" nodaviruses, and tombusviruses; the \"statovirus,\" \"w\u00e8ivirus,\" \"y\u00e0nvirus,\" and \"zh\u00e0ovirus\" groups; and several additional, smaller groups.\n\nBranch 4 consists of dsRNA viruses, including cystoviruses, reoviruses, and totiviruses and several additional families.\n\nBranch 5 consists of \u03eaRNA viruses. Each of these 5 major branches of the tree is strongly supported by bootstrap replications (Fig. 1 ). Assuming the RT rooting of the tree, branch 1, which consists of leviviruses and their relatives infecting eukaryotes, is a sister group to the rest of RNA viruses; this position is highly robust with respect to the choice of the phylogenetic method and parameters. This tree topology is compatible with the monophyly of the RdRps and, by inference, of RNA viruses and the origin of eukaryotic RNA viruses from a prokaryotic RNA virus ancestor shared with leviviruses. The deeper history remains murky. We have no information on the nature of the common ancestor of retroelements and RNA viruses, let alone on whether the ancestor was an RNA virus or a retroelement. However, parsimony considerations suggest that a retroelement ancestor is more likely given that capsids first appeared in the virus part of the tree rather than having been lost in retroelements.\n\nThe next split in the tree occurs between branch 2 and the short stem that formally joins branches 3, 4, and 5. However, the unification of branch 3 with branches 4 and 5 is weakly supported and might not reflect actual common ancestry.\n\nArguably, the most striking feature of the RNA virus tree topology is the paraphyly of \u03e9RNA viruses relative to dsRNA and \u03eaRNA viruses. Indeed, according to this phylogeny, \u03eaRNA viruses evolved from within dsRNA viruses, whereas dsRNA viruses are polyphyletic (Fig. 1 ). One major group of dsRNA viruses that includes partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses is firmly embedded within \u03e9RNA virus branch 2, whereas another, the members of a larger dsRNA virus group that includes cystoviruses, reoviruses, totiviruses, and viruses from several other families comprise a distinct branch, branch 4, which might be related to \u03e9RNA virus branch 3 (Fig. 1 ). This placement of the two branches of dsRNA viruses is conceptually compatible with the previous evolutionary scenarios of independent origins from \u03e9RNA viruses. However, the presence of a strongly supported branch combining 3 lineages of dsRNA viruses that infect both prokaryotes and eukaryotes suggests a lesser extent of polyphyly in the evolution of dsRNA viruses than originally proposed (15, 32) .\n\nAn alternative phylogenetic analysis of the same RdRp alignment using RAxML yielded the same 5 main branches, albeit some with weak support (Data Set S3B). Furthermore, although the dsRNA viruses are split the same way using RAxML as in the PhyML tree, the nested tree topology, in which branch 4 (the bulk of dsRNA viruses) is lodged deep within \u03e9RNA viruses and branch 5 (\u03eaRNA viruses) is located inside branch 4, is not reproduced (Data Set S3B). Instead, branches 4 and 5 are separate and positioned deep in the tree, immediately above the split between branch 1 and the rest of the RdRps. Given the poor resolution of the RAxML tree and a strong biological argument, namely, the absence of identified \u03eaRNA viruses in prokaryotes or protists (with the exception of the \"leishbuviruses\" infecting kinetoplastids [49, 50] ; see also Discussion below), we believe that the tree topology presented in Fig. 1 carries more credence than that shown in Data Set S3B. Nevertheless, these discrepancies emphasize that utmost caution is due when biological interpretation of deep branching in trees of highly divergent proteins is attempted.\n\nThe RdRp is the only universal protein of RNA viruses. Accordingly, other viral genes must have been gained and/or lost at different stages of evolution. Thus, after performing the phylogenetic analysis of RdRps, we assigned the proteins and domains shared by diverse viruses to the branches of the RdRp tree. Multiple alignments and hidden Markov model (hmm) profiles were constructed for 16,814 proteins and domains encoded by RNA viruses, and a computational pipeline was developed to map these domains on the viral genomes (Data Set S5). The resulting patterns of domain presence/absence in the branches of the RdRp tree were used to reconstruct the history of the gains and losses of RNA virus genes (or proteins and domains, for simplicity), both formally, using the ML-based Gloome method (51) , and informally, from parsimony considerations. These reconstructions reveal a high level of branch specificity in the evolution of the gene repertoire of RNA viruses. The only protein that is likely to have been gained at the base of the eukaryotic virus subtree (branches 2 to 5) (which also includes the bacterial cystoviruses) is the single jelly-roll capsid protein (SJR-CP) (Fig. S2A ). Retroelements lack capsid proteins, and therefore, there is no indication that SJR-CP was present in the hypothetical element that encoded the common ancestor of RdRps and RTs. Furthermore, reconstruction of the evolution of branch 1 (leviviruses and their relatives) argues against the ancestral status of SJR-CP in this branch.\n\n(ii) Branch 1: leviviruses and their descendants. The current RdRp tree topology combined with gene gain-loss reconstruction suggests the following evolutionary scenario for branch 1 ( Fig. 2A) : a levivirus-like ancestor that, like the extant members of the Leviviridae, possessed a capsid protein unrelated to SJR-CP (19, 52) gave rise to naked eukaryotic RNA replicons known as \"mitoviruses\" and \"narnaviruses.\" These replicons consist of a single RdRp gene (Fig. 2B ) and replicate in mitochondria and in the cytosol of the host cells of fungal and invertebrate hosts, respectively (the latter hosts were identified in metaviromic holobiont analyses) (14, 53) . Recently, the existence of plant \"mitoviruses\" has been reported although it is not known whether these viruses reproduce in the mitochondria (54) . The \"narnavirus\" RdRp is also the ancestor of the RdRp of the expanding group of \"ourmiaviruses\" (Fig. 2A) . \"Ourmiaviruses\" were originally identified in a narrow range of plants, and genomic analysis revealed the chimeric nature of these viruses, with a \"narnavirus\"-like RdRp but SJR-CPs and movement proteins (MPs) which were apparently acquired from \"picorna-like\" and \"tombuslike\" viruses, respectively (55) . Use of metaviromics has led to the identification of numerous related viruses associated with invertebrates, many of which encode distinct SJR-CP variants and some of which acquired an RNA helicase ( Fig. 2B and S2 ) (14) . Thus, the evolution of this branch apparently involved the loss of the structural module of leviviruses, which yielded naked RNA replicons that reproduced in the mitochondria of early eukaryotes. A group of these replicons subsequently escaped to the cytosol, which was followed by the reacquisition of unrelated structural modules from distinct lineages of eukaryotic viruses inhabiting the same environment (Fig. 2B ). This complex evolutionary scenario emphasizes the key role of modular gene exchange in the evolution of RNA viruses.\n\n(iii) Branch 2: picornavirus supergroup. Expansive branch 2 generally corresponds to the previously described \"picornavirus supergroup\" (Fig. 1 and 3) (7, 31) . Some of the virus groups that were previously considered peripheral members of this supergroup, such as totiviruses and nodaviruses, were relocated to different branches in the present tree (branches 4 and 3, respectively), whereas the viruses of the order Nidovirales were moved inside branch 2 from an uncertain position in the tree. Nevertheless, the core of the supergroup remains coherent, suggestive of common ancestry. Within branch 2, 3 major clades are strongly supported (Fig. 3A) ; however, many of the internal branches are less reliable, so that the relative positions of partitivirus-picobirnavirus, potyvirusastrovirus, and nidovirus clades within branch 2 remain uncertain.\n\nThe largest and most coherent of the branch 2 clades includes the cornerstone of the picornavirus supergroup, the \u03f3826 viruses-strong order Picornavirales (56), expanded with caliciviruses, solinviviruses, and a multitude of unclassified viruses infecting invertebrates, vertebrates, fungi, protists, and undefined hosts (for viruses discovered by metaviromics) (Fig. 3) (11, 14, 17, (57) (58) (59) . The second largest, deep-branching clade consists of two lineages that include, respectively, \u03e9RNA and dsRNA viruses (Fig. 3 ). The \u03e9RNA virus lineage combines astroviruses and potyviruses, the evolutionary affinity of which is well recognized (31, 60) . The dsRNA lineage includes the members of the families Amalgaviridae, Hypoviridae, Partitiviridae, and Picobirnaviridae, with each of these families greatly expanded by unclassified affiliates. Finally, the \"middle\" clade is smaller and less diverse; it encompasses nidoviruses, including the longest of all \u03e9RNA virus genomes (61) , and solemoviruses with much shorter genomes (Fig. 3) . Notably, some members of the family Luteoviridae and Heterocapsa circularisquama RNA virus, the only known alvernavirus (62) , are nested within the solemovirus clade. Given the lack of support beyond the phylogenetic affinity of the RdRps and the dramatic differences in the genomic architectures of nidoviruses and solemoviruses, the possibility that this unification was caused by a tree construction artifact is difficult to rule out (the branch support notwithstanding).\n\nHypoviruses, representing a group of fungal capsidless RNA replicons, have been traditionally viewed as dsRNA viruses. However, comparisons of genome architectures and phylogenetic analyses suggested that hypoviruses are derivatives of potyviruses (Continued on next page) Global RNA Virome \u00ae that have lost the capsid protein (63, 64) . In the current RdRp tree, hypoviruses cluster with the dsRNA viruses of the partitivirus-picobirnavirus clade rather than with potyviruses (Fig. 3 ). Whether this position is an artifact of tree construction or whether hypoviruses actually share the RdRps with dsRNA viruses is unclear.\n\nThe partitivirus-picobirnavirus clade within branch 2 represents a transition to the bona fide dsRNA Baltimore class (Fig. 3) . Typical partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses have minimalist genomes that consist of two dsRNA segments encapsidated separately into distinct 120-subunit T\u03ed1 capsids (65) (66) (67) (68) . These genome segments encode, respectively, RdRps and CPs that are clearly homologous between the two families. The CPs of the partitivirus-picobirnavirus clade have been suggested to be distantly related to those of other dsRNA viruses that belong to branch 4 (33, 69) . Notably, this clade also includes some naked RNA replicons that reproduce in algal mitochondria or chloroplasts, use a mitochondrial genetic code, and, in terms of lifestyle, resemble \"mitoviruses\" (14, 70, 71) . By analogy, the origin of the partitivirus-picobirnavirus group in an as-yet-undiscovered lineage of prokaryotic RNA viruses seems likely. More specifically, this group of dsRNA viruses could have evolved through reassortment of genomic segments encoding, respectively, a \u03e9RNA virus RdRp of branch 2 (possibly a naked RNA replicon) and a dsRNA virus capsid protein related to those of branch 4 viruses. The most recently evolved branch of partitiviruses is characterized by larger, 4-to 6-partite genomes, in contrast to the mono-or bipartite genomes in the deeper branches (14) . This observation emphasizes a major tendency in virus evolution: increases in genome complexity via gradual acquisition of accessory genes (72) .\n\nApart from the SJR-CP, an apparently ancestral protein that is likely to represent a shared derived character (synapomorphy) of branch 2 is a serine protease that is present in members of the order Picornavirales (with the diagnostic substitution of cysteine for the catalytic serine), members of the potyvirus-astrovirus clade, solemoviruses, alvernavirus, and nidoviruses ( Fig. 3B ; see also Fig. S2B ). As demonstrated previously, this viral protease derives from a distinct bacterial protease, probably of mitochondrial origin, which is compatible with an early origin of branch 2 in eukaryotic evolution (31) .\n\nThe reconstruction of protein gain and loss, together with the comparison of genome architectures in this branch, revealed extensive rearrangements as well as gene and module displacement ( Fig. 3B ; see also Fig. S2B). Branch 2 includes viruses with relatively long genomes and complex gene repertoires (nidoviruses, potyviruses, and many members of Picornavirales) along with viruses with much shorter genomes and minimal sets of genes (astroviruses and solemoviruses). Clearly, evolution of branch 2 viruses involved multiple gene gains. Of special note is the gain of 3 distinct helicases in 3 clades within this branch: superfamily 3 helicases (S3H) in members of Picornavirales, superfamily 2 helicases (S2H) in potyviruses, and superfamily 1 helicases (S1H) in nidoviruses ( Fig. 3B ; see also Fig. S2B ). This independent, convergent gain of distinct helicases reflects the trend noticed early in the study of RNA virus evolution, namely, that most viruses with genomes longer than \u03f36 kb encode helicases, whereas smaller ones do not. This difference conceivably exists because helicase activity is required for the replication of longer RNA genomes (73) . Another notable feature is the change of virion morphologies among potyviruses (replacement of ancestral SJR-CP by an unrelated CP forming filamentous virions) and nidoviruses (displacement by a distinct nucleocapsid protein). The dramatic change in virion morphology and mode of ge-\n\nWhere a conserved domain comprises only a part of the larger protein, the rest of this protein is shown in light gray.

Distinct hues of same color (e.g., green for MPs) are used to indicate cases where proteins that share analogous function are not homologous.\n\nWolf et al. ) that most likely were acquired independently of the capping enzymes of other RNA viruses. Nidoviruses also gained ribonucleases and other accessory proteins that are involved in genome replication, virulence, and other aspects of the infection cycle of these largest known RNA viruses (61, (74) (75) (76) .\n\n(iv) Branch 3: \"alphavirus supergroup\" and \"flavivirus supergroup\" and the extensive diversity of \"tombus-like viruses.\" Branch 3 is the part of the \u03e9RNA virus RdRp tree that underwent the most dramatic rearrangements compared to previous versions. This branch consists of two strongly supported clades of \u03e9RNA viruses: (i) the assemblage that originally was defined as the \"alphavirus supergroup\" (7, 15) joined by several additional groups of viruses and (ii) flaviviruses and related viruses (\"flavivirus supergroup\"; Fig. 1 and 4 ). In the former clade, the alphavirus supergroup encompasses an enormous diversity of plant, fungal, and animal \u03e9RNA viruses and consists of 3 well-supported lineages, namely, tymoviruses, virgaviruses/alphaviruses/endornaviruses, and hepeviruses/benyviruses, each accompanied by related viruses that often form as-yet-unclassified lineages (Fig. 4A ). Within the \"alphavirus supergroup\" alone, the genome lengths range from \u03f36 to \u03f320 kb. Despite this length variation, all supergroup members harbor a conserved RNA replication gene module encoding a CapE, S1H, and RdRp; the conservation of this module attests to the monophyly of the supergroup (Fig. 4B) .\n\nIn contrast, virion architectures differ dramatically even within each of the three lineages of the \"alphavirus supergroup.\" The major structural themes include variants of icosahedral capsids formed by SJR-CP (e.g., bromoviruses and tymoviruses); unrelated icosahedral capsids enveloped in a lipoprotein bilayer (togaviruses); flexuous filamentous capsids formed by a distinct type of CP (alphaflexiviruses, betaflexiviruses, gammaflexiviruses, and closteroviruses); and rigid rod-shaped capsids assembled from another distinct CP (benyiviruses and virgaviruses). It was traditionally thought that the latter capsid type is specific to viruses of flowering plants (20) . However, the recent discovery of a virgavirus-like CP in invertebrate viruses (e.g., B\u011b ih\u01cei charybdis crab virus 1 [ Fig. 4B ]) (14) suggests that the emergence of this unique CP fold antedates land colonization by plants at \u03f3100 million years ago (Mya). Yet another \"structural\" theme is offered by endornaviruses, naked RNA replicons which, similarly to the hypoviruses in branch 2 (see above), originally were classified as dsRNA viruses. However, endornaviruses possess all the hallmarks of the alphavirus supergroup and are clearly derived from \u03e9RNA viruses of this group. They seem to have been mislabeled dsRNA viruses due to the accumulation of dsRNA replication intermediates in infected cells (18, 77) . A parallel loss of the CP genes apparently occurred in the deltaflexiviruses, which, in RdRp phylogenies, form a sister group to the flexible filamentous gammaflexiviruses (78) , and in the umbraviruses that are included in the family Tombusviridae based on the RdRp phylogeny. Notably, unlike most other capsidless viruses that are vertically inherited, umbraviruses can hijack capsids of coinfecting luteoviruses for aphid transmission (79) .\n\nWithin branch 3, the phylogenetically compact alphavirus supergroup is embedded within the radiation of diverse virus groups, including the well-known tombusviruses and nodaviruses, along with several newcomers discovered via metaviromics, such as the \"statovirus,\" \"w\u00e8ivirus,\" \"y\u00e0nvirus,\" and \"zh\u00e0ovirus\" groups (14, 80, 81) (Fig. 4A ). Our RdRp analysis revealed remarkable phylogenetic heterogeneity within and among these groups and split the \"tombus-like viruses\" into 5 lineages with distinct evolutionary affinities (groups \"Uncl.\n\n[unclassified] inv. [invertebrates]\" and subsets of \"tombus-like viruses\" and \"nodaviruses\" in Fig. 4A ). This subdivision is also supported by the analysis of the CPs of these viruses (see section on SJR-CP evolution) (Fig. 7) . Therefore, in contrast to the alphavirus supergroup, nodaviruses, and the flavivirus supergroup, the term \"tombus-like\" loses its evolutionary and taxonomic coherence. Accordingly, we use the term \"tombusviruses\" (without quotation marks) only for one lineage that includes the members of the current family Tombusviridae along with a broad variety of related plant and invertebrate holobiont viruses (14) .\n\nThe previously suggested, tenuous Flaviviridae-Tombusviridae affinity is gone in the present tree, although members of both families belong to the same major branch, branch 3. Plant tombusviruses (and members of closely related plant virus genera), representing the only group of \"tombus-like viruses\" that was available at the time of previous analyses (7, 21) , now form but a small twig deep within the large assemblage that we refer to as tombusviruses. Tombusviruses are affiliated with \"statoviruses\" (80) and with a subset of unclassified viruses from invertebrate holobionts rather than with flaviviruses (Fig. 4A) . Flaviviruses now form a separate clade within branch 3, the flavivirus supergroup that includes members of four recognized flaviviral genera (Pegivirus, Hepacivirus, Flavivirus, and Pestivirus), the newly discovered \"j\u0131 ngm\u00e9nviruses\" with segmented genomes (38) , and a variety of unclassified, extremely divergent \"flavi-like viruses\" of animals and plants. This clade is split into two well-supported lineages; one includes pegiviruses and hepaciviruses, and the other consists of the rest of flaviviruses (Fig. 4A ). Flaviviral virions are enveloped, with the envelope proteins forming an external icosahedral shell, whereas the core nucleocapsid is apparently disordered; the evolutionary provenance of the core protein, with its distinct fold, is unclear (19, 82, 83) . Notably, flaviviral envelope proteins are class II fusion proteins that are closely related to alphavirus envelope E1 proteins (84) . The theme of gene swapping between these distantly related virus groups of branch 3 is further emphasized by the homology between the alphavirus CPs that form icosahedral capsids under the lipid envelopes and the flavivirus nonstructural NS3 proteases that share a chymotrypsin-like fold (84) . Because the RdRp tree topology implies that the alphavirus ancestor is more recent than the ancestor of flaviviruses (Fig. 1) , such adoption of the NS3 protease for a structural role is suggestive of emerging alphaviruses borrowing their structural module from preexisting flaviviruses (19) .\n\nThe hallmark of branch 3 is the capping enzyme (CapE), which is present in the entire \"alphavirus supergroup\" and in flaviviruses ( Fig. 4 ; see also Fig. S2B). A highly divergent version of CapE has been identified in nodaviruses (85) and, in our present analysis, in the additional subset of viruses that grouped with nodaviruses, as well as in a few viruses scattered throughout the clade. Formally, CapE is inferred to be ancestral in the entire branch 3. However, CapEs of \"alphavirus supergroup\" members, nodaviruses, and flaviviruses are related only distantly to one another, and at least the latter have closer eukaryotic homologs, namely, the FtsJ family methyltransferases (86, 87) . Furthermore, tombusviruses, statoviruses, y\u00e0nviruses, zh\u00e0oviruses, w\u00e8iviruses, and members of the Pegivirus-Hepacivirus lineage of flaviviruses lack CapE, putting into question its presence in the ancestor of this branch ( To an even greater extent than in branch 2, the apparent routes of virus evolution in branch 3 involve lineage-specific gene capture that resulted in evolution of complex CP-Spro, capsid protein-serine protease; E, envelope protein; fCP, divergent copies of the capsid protein forming filamentous virions; Hsp70h, Hsp70 homolog; MP, movement protein; NS, nonstructural protein; nsP2 to nsP3, nonstructural proteins; Ppro, papain-like protease; prM, precursor of membrane protein; rCP, capsid protein forming rod-shaped virions; RiS, RNA interference suppressor; S1H, superfamily 1 helicase; S2H, superfamily 2 helicase; SJR2, single jelly-roll capsid proteins of type 2; Spro, serine protease; vOTU, virus OTU-like protease; NS, nonstructural protein. Distinct hues of same color (e.g., green for MPs) are used to indicate the cases when proteins that share analogous function are not homologous.\n\nGlobal RNA Virome \u00ae genome architectures (Fig. 4B) . The most notable cases are the closteroviruses and divergent flaviviruses that have genomes of up to 20 to 26 kb, rivalling coronaviruses in terms of genome length and the complexity of the gene repertoire (38, (88) (89) (90) .\n\nThe lack of genes assigned to the common ancestor of branch 3 (with the obvious exception of the RdRp) prevents development of a coherent evolutionary scenario for the entire branch. In the case of the clade encompassing the \"alphavirus supergroup\" and related viruses, a potential common ancestor could be a simple virus that encoded only an RdRp and a SJR-CP, a CP fold most broadly represented in this clade, including diverse tombusviruses, nodaviruses and members of Bromoviridae, and Tymoviridae within the \"alphavirus supergroup.\" Proposal of such an ancestor for the flavivirus clade is challenged by the lack of viruses with short and simple genomes among flaviviruses. Indeed, the lengths of the genomes in this clade range from \u03f39 kb to \u03f326 kb, with even the shortest ones encoding at least three of the flavivirus signature genes (serine protease [Spro], S2H, and RdRp). One potential clue, however, is provided by \"j\u0131 ngm\u00e9nviruses,\" with tetrapartite genomes in which the protease-helicase modules and the RdRps are encoded by separate genome segments; two other segments apparently encode structural proteins of unclear provenance (38) . This genome architecture could hint at an ancestral flavivirus genome that was assembled from genes borrowed from preexisting viruses, one of which possessed a divergent \"tombus-like virus\" RdRp. Although the origins of branch 3 are murky, major trends in its subsequent evolution clearly included lineage-specific gene capture, starting with helicases and CapEs in the ancestors of the major lineages and followed by diverse genes in smaller groups (Fig. 4B) .\n\n(v) Branch 4: dsRNA viruses. Branch 4, which joins branch 3 with weak support, includes the bulk of the dsRNA viruses ( Fig. 1 and 5 ). All dsRNA viruses in this branch share a unique virion organization and encode homologous CPs. In particular, the specialized icosahedral capsids of these viruses, involved in transcription and replication of the dsRNA genome inside cells, are constructed from 60 homo-or heterodimers of CP subunits organized on an unusual T\u03ed1 (also known as pseudo-T\u03ed2) lattice (69, 91) . The only exceptions are the chrysoviruses, which encode large CPs corresponding to the CP dimers of other dsRNA viruses and form genuine T\u03ed1 capsids (92) . The icosahedral capsids of partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses, which encode RdRps belonging to branch 2, are also constructed from 60 homodimers (66, 67, 93) and have been suggested to be evolutionarily related to those of the dsRNA viruses from RdRp branch 4 (94) despite little structural similarity between the corresponding CPs. Totiviruses, many of which have \"minimal\" genomes encoding only RdRps and CPs, comprise one of the two major clades in branch 4, whereas cystoviruses, the only known prokaryotic dsRNA viruses, together with members of the vast family Reoviridae, which consists of multisegmented dsRNA viruses infecting diverse eukaryotes, comprise the second clade (Fig. 5) . The concept of the closer phylogenetic affinity between cystoviruses and reoviruses appears to be corroborated by the fact that the inner T\u03ed1 icosahedral capsid is uniquely encased by the outer icosahedral shell constructed on a T\u03ed13 lattice in both families (34) . Both cystoviruses and reoviruses appear to have gained many cladespecific genes, in particular, RecA-like packaging ATPases of the former (95) and the CapEs of the latter that are only distantly related to CapEs of other RNA viruses and likely were acquired independently (96, 97) ( (vi) Branch 5: \u060aRNA viruses. Branch 5, the 100% supported lineage combining all \u03eaRNA viruses, is lodged within branch 4 as the sister group of reoviruses, and this position is upheld by two strongly supported internal branches in the RdRp tree ( Fig. 1  and 6 ). The \u03eaRNA branch splits into 2 strongly supported clades. The first clade encompasses the 348 viruses-strong membership of the order Mononegavirales (98), along with the members of the distantly related family Aspiviridae (99), 3 groups of \u03eaRNA viruses discovered through metaviromics (\"ch\u01d4 viruses,\" \"q\u00ednviruses,\" and \"yu\u00e8viruses\") (14, 39) , and a group of unclassified fungal viruses (Fig. 6A) (42, 100) . In contrast to the members of the Mononegavirales, most of which possess unsegmented genomes, the remainder of this clade is characterized by bi-, tri-, or even tetraseg-mented genomes (Fig. 6B) . The second clade combines the family Orthomyxoviridae, the genus Tilapinevirus (101), and the large order Bunyavirales (394 viruses) (102) . The latter order consists of two branches, one of which is the sister group to the orthomyxovirus/tilapinevirus clade (albeit with weak support). The numbers of negativesense or ambisense genome segments in this clade range from 2 to 3 in most of bunyaviruses to 8 in viruses of the genus Emaravirus and the orthomyxovirus/tilapinevirus group (10, 99, 101, 103) . A notable acquisition in the first clade is a CapE, whereas members of the second clade share \"cap-snatching\" endonucleases (En) (10) .\n\nPatterns of the single jelly-roll capsid protein evolution. The SJR-CP is the dominant type of CP among \u03e9RNA viruses and is also found in members of one family of dsRNA viruses (Birnaviridae). Structural comparisons indicate that SJR-CPs of RNA viruses form a monophyletic group and likely were recruited from cellular SJR proteins on a single occasion during the evolution of RNA viruses (19) . The short length and high divergence of SJR-CPs preclude adequate resolution in phylogenetic analysis; thus, we performed profile-profile sequence comparisons and clustering of all viral SJR-CP sequences in our data set (see Materials and Methods for details). Analysis of the resulting network reveals patterns that are generally congruent with the RdRp phylogeny and provides further insights into the evolution of different branches of RNA viruses. At conservative P value thresholds (P \u03fd 1e \u03ea10 ), the majority of SJR-CPs segregated into two large clusters, both of which contained representatives from RdRp branch 2. Cluster 1 included the members of Picornavirales and Caliciviridae and diverse \"picornalike viruses\" of invertebrates, whereas cluster 2 consisted of the members of the families Astroviridae, Luteoviridae, and Solemoviridae and \"sobemo-like viruses\" (Fig. S3 ). In addition, cluster 2 contained members of several families from RdRp branch 3, namely, Tombusviridae (and diverse \"tombus-like viruses\"), Hepeviridae, a subgroup of Nodaviridae, and \"statoviruses.\"\n\nAt less-restrictive P value thresholds (P \u03fd 1e \u03ea03 ), all SJR-CPs were interconnected, largely through making contacts to the core of cluster 2. Only \"ourmiaviruses\" had stronger affinity to picornaviruses in cluster 1 (Fig. 7) . This pattern of connectivity is consistent with the radiation of SJR-CPs from a common ancestor, likely resembling sequences from cluster 2 of branch 2. This analysis also reveals high CP sequence divergence among members of some families (e.g., Bromoviridae) and numerous cases of apparent CP gene replacement. For instance, the CPs of nodaviruses fall into two groups; one is related to the turreted CPs of tetraviruses, and the other is similar to CPs of tombusviruses, mirroring the RdRp phylogeny (Fig. 7) . At a greater phylogenetic distance, CPs of astroviruses and hepeviruses are closely related despite their affiliation with branches 2 and 3, respectively, suggesting CP gene replacement in the ancestor of one of the two families. Given that the CPs of hepeviruses connect to SJR-CPs of other viruses through astroviruses, CP gene replacement most likely occurred in the ancestor of hepeviruses (Fig. S3) . Notably, the CPs of \"zh\u00e0oviruses,\" \"w\u00e8iviruses,\" and \"tombus-like\" and \"sobemo-like\" viruses (representing a diverse virus assemblage within the solemovirus branch, to the exclusion of bona fide Solemoviridae) did not form discrete clusters but rather were affiliated with diverse virus groups, suggesting extensive recombination in these viruses, with multiple CP gene exchanges (Fig. 7) . In the case of unclassified \"narnaviruses\" and \"ourmiaviruses,\" the CP genes apparently were acquired on more than 3 independent occasions from different groups of viruses, emphasizing the impact of recombination and gene shuffling in the evolution of RNA viruses. Previously, a similar extent of chimerism was also observed among singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses (104, 105) , highlighting the evolutionary and functional plasticity of short viral genomes.\n\nThe modular gene-sharing network of RNA viruses: gene transfer and module shuffling. The pronounced structural and functional modularity of virus proteomes and the pervasive shuffling of the genomic regions encoding distinct protein modules are key features of virus evolution (11, 15, 17) . Therefore, a productive approach to the study of the virosphere that complements phylogenetics is the construction and analysis of networks of gene sharing. Bipartite networks, in which one type of node corresponds to genes and another to genomes, have been employed to investigate the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) domain of the virosphere (45) . This analysis revealed hierarchical modular organization of the network, with several modules that included Global RNA Virome \u00ae nonobvious connections between disparate groups of viruses (44, 106) . Although this type of analysis is less informative for RNA viruses due to the small number of proteins encoded in each viral genome, the \"pan-proteome\" of RNA viruses is large (Data Set S5), prompting us to experiment with bipartite gene sharing networks for RNA viruses. The initial search for statistically significant modularity identified 54 distinct modules, most of which included a single virus family (Fig. 8A and B) . Remarkably, the family Reoviridae has been split into 5 modules, highlighting the vast diversity of this family, comparable to that seen in order-level taxa. Among the exceptions, the most expansive module included the viruses of the order Picornavirales (module 29), together with those of the family Caliciviridae (module 47), which are linked through the conserved suite of genes that includes those encoding SJR-CP, chymotrypsin-like protease, S3H, and the RdRp (Fig. 8A and C) . Viruses of the order Bunyavirales were also recovered in a single module characterized by the presence of a conserved nucleocapsid (with the exception of the families Nairoviridae and Arenaviridae) and the cap-snatching endonuclease (module 51; Fig. 8A and C) .\n\nThe next stage of the network analysis aimed at detecting the supermodules that are formed from the primary modules via connecting genes. The results of the analyses of the supermodules of RNA viruses failed to attain statistical significance due to the small number of shared genes; nevertheless, some notable connections were revealed by this analysis. Specifically, 8 overlapping supermodules were identified (Fig. 8C) . The largest and, arguably, most remarkable is a supermodule that combines \u03e9RNA, dsRNA, and \u03eaRNA viruses that share the capping enzymes, S1H (with the exception of Reoviridae and Mononegavirales), and additional connector genes (e.g., the OTU family protease) that link some of the constituent modules. The second largest supermodule combines large subsets of viruses from RdRp branches 2 and 3 that are connected through the SJR-CP and the chymotrypsin-like protease. Another supermodule encompasses enveloped \u03e9RNA viruses of the families Flaviviridae and Togaviridae and \u03eaRNA viruses of the order Bunyavirales (except for Arenaviridae) that share homologous envelope glycoproteins (except for flaviviruses) and class II fusion proteins.\n\nInformation from gene sharing is inherently limited for RNA viruses due to the small number of genes in each genome. Nevertheless, the bipartite network analysis revealed prominent \"horizontal\" connections that are underlain either by actual gene exchange or by parallel acquisition of homologous genes by distinct RNA viruses.\n\nHost ranges of RNA viruses: evolutionary implications and horizontal virus transfer (HVT). RNA viruses have been identified in representatives of all major divisions of eukaryotes, whereas in prokaryotes, members of two families of RNA viruses are known to infect only a limited range of hosts (11, 13, 15, 31) . For branch 1 in our phylogenetic tree of RdRps, the route of evolution from leviviruses infecting prokaryotes to eukaryotic \"ourmiaviruses\" of plants and invertebrates is readily traceable and involves a merger between a levivirus-derived naked RNA replicon that eukaryotes most likely inherited from the mitochondrial endosymbiont with the SJR-CP of a eukaryotic \"picorna-like virus.\" Notably, such a merger seems to have occurred on at least three other independent occasions in branch 1 because several groups of invertebrate holobiont \"narnaviruses\" and some \"ourmiaviruses\" encode distantly related SJR-CPs that apparently were acquired from different groups of plant and animal viruses (Fig. 7) .\n\nThe case of cystoviruses is less clear given that this clade is sandwiched between eukaryotic viruses in branch 4 and therefore does not seem to be a good candidate for classification as the ancestor of this branch. It appears more likely that the ancestor was a toti-like virus, whereas cystoviruses were derived forms, which would imply virus transfer from eukaryotes to prokaryotes. However, an alternative scenario might be considered. No known prokaryotic viruses are classified in branch 2, but it has been proposed that the picobirnaviruses, for which no hosts have been reliably identified, actually are prokaryotic viruses. This proposal is based on the conspicuous conservation of functional, bacterium-type, ribosome-binding sites (Shine-Dalgarno sequences) in picobirnavirus genomes (107, 108) . Should that be the case, viruses of prokaryotes might be lurking among totiviruses as well. Then, branch 4 would stem from a prokaryotic ancestor, obviating the need to invoke virus transfer from eukaryotes to prokaryotes to explain the origin of the cystoviruses.\n\nWe made an attempt to quantify the potential horizontal virus transfer (HVT) events in the RNA viruses that represent the 5 major branches of the RdRp tree. The leaves of the tree were labeled with the known hosts, the entropy of the host ranges for each subtree was calculated, and the resulting values were plotted against the distance from the root (Fig. 9 ). By design, for all branches, entropy (host diversity) drops from the maximum values at the root to zero at the leaves. All branches show substantial host range diversity such that, for example, at the half-distance from the root to the leaves, all branches, except for branch 1, retain at least half of the diversity (Fig. 9 ). Furthermore, the differences between the branches are substantial, with the highest entropy observed in branch 4 (dsRNA viruses) and branch 5 (\u03eaRNA viruses). With all the caveats due to potential errors and ambiguities in host assignment, this analysis strongly suggests that HVT played an important role in the evolution of all major groups of RNA viruses.\n\nRNA virus evolution coming into focus. This work was prompted by the advances of metaviromics, which have dramatically increased the known diversity of RNA viruses (11, 13, 17, 37, 57) . We reasoned that this expansion of the RNA virosphere could provide an improved understanding of virus evolution. Although further progress of metaviromics and enhanced phylogenomic methods will undoubtedly change current ideas, we believe that some key aspects of RNA virus evolution are indeed coming into focus.\n\nThe expanded diversity of RNA viruses, combined with the iterative procedure for phylogenetic analysis, allowed us to obtain a tree of all RdRps and the most closely related RTs in which the main branches are strongly supported and thus appear to be reliable (Fig. 1) . To our knowledge, the picture of RNA virus evolution emerging from the tree has not been presented previously. The tree seems to clarify the relationships between the 3 Baltimore classes of RNA viruses by revealing the nested tree structure in which dsRNA viruses evolved, on at least two occasions, from \u03e9RNA viruses, whereas \u03eaRNA viruses evolved from a distinct group of dsRNA viruses.\n\nThe derivation of \u03eaRNA viruses from dsRNA viruses is, arguably, the most unexpected outcome of the present analysis, considering the lack of genes (other than the RdRp gene) shared by these virus classes. Clearly, given that the primary evidence behind the derivation of \u03eaRNA viruses from within dsRNA viruses comes from deep phylogeny, extreme caution is due in the interpretation of this observation. However, the pronounced similarity between the three-dimensional (3D) structures of the RdRps of \u03eaRNA influenza virus A and bacteriophage 6 dsRNA cystovirus (35) is compatible with our findings. Further, because virtually no \u03eaRNA viruses are known in prokaryotes or unicellular eukaryotes (with the single exception of the \"leischbuviruses\" in parasitic trypanosomatids [50] , which were likely acquired from the animal hosts of these protists), their later origin from a preexisting group of \u03e9RNA or dsRNA viruses appears most likely.\n\nThe \u03e9RNA to dsRNA to \u03eaRNA scenario of RNA virus genome evolution also makes sense in terms of the molecular logic of genome replication-expression strategies. Indeed, \u03e9RNA viruses use the simplest genomic strategy and, in all likelihood, represent the primary pool of RNA viruses. The dsRNA viruses conceivably evolved when a \u03e9RNA virus switched to encapsidating a replicative intermediate (dsRNA) together with the RdRp. Naked replicons similar to those of \"mitoviruses,\" hypoviruses, and endornaviruses might have been evolutionary intermediates in this process. This switch does not seem to be as \"easy\" and common as previously suspected (15, 32) but, nevertheless, appears to have occurred at least twice during the evolution of RNA viruses. The Global RNA Virome \u00ae origin of \u03eaRNA viruses is the next step during which the plus strand is discarded from the virions, perhaps simplifying the processes of transcription and replication. Conceivably, the evolution of dsRNA and \u03eaRNA viruses, in which transcription and replication of the viral genomes were confined to the interior of virions or nucleocapsid transcription/replication complexes and no dsRNA accumulated in the infected cells, was driven by the advantage of escaping some of the host defense mechanisms, in particular, RNA interference (RNAi) (109, 110) . The membrane-associated replication complexes of \u03e9RNA viruses could represent an initial step in this direction (9) .\n\nObviously, evolution of the RdRp does not equal evolution of viruses; other genes, in particular, those encoding capsid and other structural proteins, are crucial for virus reproduction, and these genes often have different histories. The reconstruction of gene gain and loss sheds some light on these aspects of RNA virus evolution. The ancestors of each of the major branches of RNA viruses (except for branch 1) appear to have been simply organized \u03e9RNA viruses resembling tombusviruses (Fig. 10) . Thus, these types of viruses encoding RdRps and SJR-CPs might have been ancestral to the bulk of eukaryotic RNA viruses (apart from those in branch 1 that derive directly from prokaryotic leviviruses). The subsequent parallel capture of different helicases enabled evolution of increasingly complex genomes via accumulation of additional genes (Fig. 10) . Notably, similar levels of complexity, with a complete coding capacity of 20 to 40 kb, were reached independently in 4 branches of the RdRp tree, namely, branch 2 (coronaviruses), branch 3 (closteroviruses and flaviviruses), branch 4 (reoviruses), and branch 5 (filoviruses and paramyxoviruses) (Fig. 3 and 6) .\n\nGene exchange and shuffling of gene modules are important factors of RNA virus evolution. For example, it appears that all dsRNA viruses in the two major clades within Fig. 1 legend. Only the genes corresponding to RdRp, CP, and helicases (S1H, S2H, and S3H for the helicases of superfamilies 1, 2, and 3, respectively) are shown systematically. The helicases appear to have been captured independently and in parallel in 3 branches of \u03e9RNA viruses, facilitating the evolution of larger, more complex genomes. Additional genes, namely, the Endo and Exo genes (for endonuclease and exonuclease, respectively) and the Hsp70h gene (heat shock protein 70 homolog), are shown selectively, to emphasize the increased genome complexity, respectively, in Nidovirales and in Closteroviridae. The virion architecture is shown schematically for each included group of viruses. Icosahedral capsids composed of unelated CPs are indicated by different colors (see the text for details). The question mark at the hypothetical ancestral eukaryotic RNA virus indicates the uncertainty with regard to the nature of the host (prokaryotic or eukaryotic) of this ancestral form. The block arrow at the bottom indicates the time flow and the complexification trend in RNA virus evolution.\n\nWolf et al. branches 2 and 4 share homologous structural modules that combine with distinct RdRps. At least in the case of partiti-picobirnaviruses in branch 2, the dsRNA virus (\"toti-like virus\") CP apparently displaced the ancestral SJR-CP. However, this particular protein structure does not seem to be essential to encapsidate a dsRNA genome; birnaviruses, whose provenance is uncertain due to the permutation in their RdRps, retain SJR-CP, which is most closely related to SJR-CP of nodaviruses and tetraviruses (19) . An even more striking example of module shuffling is presented by amalgaviruses, dsRNA viruses that group with partitiviruses in the RdRp tree but encode a distant homolog of the nucleocapsid protein of \u03eaRNA bunyaviruses (111) (112) (113) (114) . More generally, structural and replication modules have been repeatedly shuffled during the evolution of \u03e9RNA viruses. Examples include displacement of the ancestral SJR-CP by a filamentous CP in potyviruses and by a helical nucleocapsid protein in nidoviruses and multiple cases of displacement with rod-shaped-like CP and unique nucleocapsid proteins in branch 3. Thus, exchange of genes and gene modules among RNA viruses is pervasive and can cross the boundaries of Baltimore classes.\n\nAnother recurring trend in RNA virus evolution is the loss of the structural module, resulting in the emergence of naked RNA replicons such as \"narnaviruses\" and \"mitoviruses\" in branch 1, hypoviruses in branch 2, and endornaviruses, umbraviruses, and deltaflexiviruses in branch 3 (18) . On some occasions, broad horizontal spread of a gene led to a major shift in the lifestyle of viruses, such as adaptation of viruses to new types of hosts. The primary cases in point are the movement proteins (MPs) of plant viruses that are represented in all 5 branches of the RdRp tree and, outside the RNA part of the virosphere, in plant caulimoviruses and badnaviruses and in ssDNA viruses (115) .\n\nThe prevalence of HVT and the overall course of RNA virus evolution. Arguably, the most striking realization brought about by metaviromics analyses concerns the diverse host range of numerous groups of viruses, even tight ones that occupy positions near the tips of the RdRp tree. Extending early observations on the highly unexpected similarities between viruses of animals and plants, recent metaviromic analyses revealed numerous clusters of indisputably related viruses infecting animals and plants or plants and fungi or, in some cases, animals or plants and protists. The results of the analyses of evolutionary relationships between viruses with distinct host ranges are supported not only by the phylogeny of the RdRp but also by the fact that these viruses share additional conserved domains, such as, for example, SJR1, S3H, and 3C-Pro in the case of Picornavirales members infecting protists, plants, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates (Fig. 3) .\n\nInvertebrates are particularly promiscuous hosts for viruses, often sharing the same virus group with distantly related organisms. Certainly, much caution is due in the interpretation of host range assignments from metaviromics, especially those resulting from holobiont studies. Viruses identified in holobiont samples of (for example) invertebrates could actually infect protists associated with these animals (50) or could represent contamination from fungal or plant or even prokaryotic sources. These uncertainties notwithstanding, the extensive diversity of hosts even within small branches of the RdRp tree is undeniable. A coevolution scenario in which the ancestors of all these viruses originated from the common ancestor of the respective groups of eukaryotes and coevolved with the hosts implies an enormous diversity of RNA viruses in early eukaryotes. This scenario appears to be highly unlikely given the apparent paucity of RNA viruses in the extant protists (although new metaviromic studies might substantially expand the range of protist viruses). The pervasive HVT alternative seems much more plausible, especially given that arthropods, nematodes, and other invertebrates are well known as virus vectors and thus fit the role of RNA virus reservoirs (11) .\n\nIn addition to invertebrates, which appear to be the dominant HVT agents, fungi could also play an important role in HVT within the global RNA virome. Indeed, fungi that are tightly associated with plants and insects often share closely related viruses with these organisms (116) (117) (118) . Furthermore, an indisputable case of cross-kingdom transfer of an insect iflavirus to an entomopathogenic fungus has been recently described (119) .\n\nThese findings appear to be most extensively compatible with a grand evolutionary scenario (Fig. 10) in which the ancestor of the eukaryotic RNA virome was a levi/ narnavirus-like naked RNA replicon that originally reproduced in mitochondria and then combined with a host carbohydrate-binding SJR protein (19) or a preexisting SJR-CP from a DNA virus to form a simple ancestral virus. Given that viruses of branches 2, 3, and 4 are present in modern protists, it appears likely that these branches emerged in early eukaryotes. However, because of the apparent dominance of the viruses of RdRp branch 2 (members of the \"picornavirus supergroup\" in general and of the \"aquatic picorna-like viruses\" clade in particular) in protists, this branch likely diversified first, whereas the diversification of branches 3 and 4 occurred later, after ancestral protist viruses were transferred to marine invertebrates during the Cambrian explosion. Results of the recent analysis of the viromes of ctenophores, sponges, and cnidarians suggest that substantial diversification of RNA viruses had already occurred in these deeply branching metazoa (120) . Invertebrates brought their already highly diverse RNA virome to land at the time of terrestrialization and subsequently inoculated land plants. In land plants, RNA viruses, particularly those of branch 3, dramatically expanded, perhaps in part because of the exclusion of competing large DNA viruses. Finally, it seems plausible that, given the high prevalence of \u03eaRNA viruses in metazoa and their virtual absence in protists (with the exception of the recently discovered \"leishbuviruses\" that likely invaded their parasitic protist hosts via HVT from an animal host [49, 50] ), the viruses that comprise RdRp branch 5 evolved in animals via mixing and matching genes from reovirus-like and flavivirus-like ancestors.\n\nThe impending overhaul of RNA virus taxonomy. The expansion of the global RNA virome thanks to the advances of metaviromics, combined with the phylogenomics results, seems to call for an overhaul of the current virus taxonomy on multiple levels. Most importantly, creation of a coherent, hierarchical system with multiple taxonomic ranks seems to be imminent. This process has already started with the proposal of a phylum rank for \u03eaRNA viruses, for which monophyly is unequivocally supported by the present analysis ( Fig. 1 and 6 ). This phylum could consist of two subphyla with multiple classes and orders. At least 4 additional phyla of RNA viruses can be confidently predicted to emerge, including the dsRNA viruses of branch 4 and the \u03e9RNA viruses of branches 1, 2, and 3. Each of these phyla will undoubtedly have a rich internal structure. In addition, some of the current families do not seem to be compatible with the expansive RdRp trees presented here and in a previous analysis (14) . For instance, the families Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Rhabdoviridae are likely to be split into two families each.\n\nWhile the present study was in preparation, a major attempt at a comprehensive virus classification was published (121) . This work analyzed a dendrogram that was produced from matrices of distances between viruses derived from sequence similarity scores combined with measures of gene composition similarity. Unlike our present analysis, this approach presupposes monophyly of each of the Baltimore classes. Furthermore, given that their analysis was based on measures of similarity rather than on phylogenetic analysis proper, this approach is best regarded as producing a phenetic classification of viruses rather that an evolutionary reconstruction as such. Some of the groups delineated by this method, particularly those among \u03e9RNA viruses, are closely similar to those reported here. Others, however, are extensively different; for instance, the order Mononegavirales is not classified as monophyletic in their dendrograms. We did not attempt a complete comparison; such an exercise could be useful in the future for better understanding the routes of RNA virus evolution.\n\nConcluding remarks. Through metaviromics, many aspects of the global RNA virome evolution can be clarified. Certainly, reconstruction of the deepest events in this evolutionary history is bound to remain tentative, especially because the RdRp gene is the only universal gene of the RNA viruses and is hence the only one that can serve as the template for evolutionary reconstructions. At the depth of divergence characteristic of RdRps, the relationship between the major branches in the tree cannot be established with confidence. Nevertheless, monophyly of several expansive groups, in particular, the 5 main branches in the RdRp tree, is strongly supported. Because of the stability of these branches, biologically plausible scenarios of evolution emerge under which dsRNA viruses evolved from different groups of \u03e9RNA viruses whereas \u03eaRNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses.\n\nEvolutionary reconstructions suggest that the last common ancestors of each major lineage of eukaryotic \u03e9RNA viruses were simple viruses that encoded only the RdRp and a CP, most likely of the SJR fold. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of distinct helicases which apparently facilitate replication of larger, more complex \u03e9RNA genomes. The helicase-assisted replication of \u03e9RNA genomes created the opportunities for parallel acquisition of additional genes encoding proteins involved in polyprotein processing and virus genome expression, such as proteases and capping enzymes, respectively, and proteins involved in virus-host interactions, such as MPs or RNAi suppressors of plant viruses. In addition to these processes of vertical evolution of RNA viruses, the results from phylogenomic analyses reveal multiple cases of gene module exchange among diverse viruses and pervasive HVT, often between distantly related hosts, such as animals and plants. Together, these processes have shaped a complex network of evolutionary relationships among RNA viruses.\n\nThe much-anticipated comprehensive exploration of the RNA viromes of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes, such as free-living excavates, chromalveolates, rhizaria, amoebozoa, and choanoflagellates, as well as deeply rooted metazoa, will undoubtedly help in developing better-supported evolutionary scenarios for each of the 5 major branches of the RNA virus tree. Nevertheless, it is already clear that the current taxonomy of RNA viruses is due for a complete overhaul.\n\nPhylogeny of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Protein sequences belonging to RNA viruses (excluding retroviruses) and to unclassified viruses were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database in April 2017 (122) . Initial screening for RdRp domains was performed using PSI-BLAST (123) (E value of 0.01, effective database size of 2 \u03eb 10 8 sequences) with position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) produced from the available RdRp alignments. The sources included group-specific alignments for \u03e9RNA viruses and dsRNA viruses (12, 31) and the 4 PFAM alignments for the \u03eaRNA viruses (pfam00602, pfam00946, pfam04196, and pfam06317) from the NCBI conserved domain database (CDD) (124) . Additionally, a set of RTs from group II introns and non-long-terminal-repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons was extracted from GenBank as an outgroup.\n\nExtracted RdRp footprints were filtered for the fraction of unresolved amino acids (at most 10%) and clustered using UCLUST (125) with a similarity threshold of 0.9. One representative from each cluster was selected for further analysis. The resulting set contained 4,640 virus RdRps. This set went through several rounds of semimanual curation whereby sequences were clustered using UCLUST, aligned using MUSCLE (126) , and cross-searched against each other and their parent sequences (often representing complete viral polyproteins) using PSI-BLAST and HHSEARCH (127) . Upon obtaining the results of these searches, the boundaries of the RdRp domain were expanded or trimmed to improve their compatibility with each other.\n\nThe RdRp and RT sequences were subjected to an iterative clustering and aligning procedure, organized as follows. Initially, sequences were clustered using UCLUST with a similarity threshold of 0.5. The clustered sequences were aligned using MUSCLE, and singletons were converted to pseudoalignments consisting of just one sequence. Sites containing more than 67% gaps were temporarily removed from alignments, and pairwise similarity scores were obtained for clusters by the use of HHSEARCH. Scores for a pair of clusters were converted to distances as follows: the d A,B \u03ed \u03ealog[s A,B /min(s A,A ,s B,B ) formula, in which d A,B is the distance between cluster A and cluster B and s A,B is the HHSEARCH score for the comparison of these clusters, was used to convert scores s to distances d. The matrix of pairwise distances was used to calculate the mean by the unweighted pair group method using average linkages (UPGMA) (128) . Shallow tips of the tree were used as the guide tree for a progressive pairwise alignment of the clusters at the tree leaves using HHALIGN (127) , resulting in larger clusters. This procedure was reiterative, ultimately resulting in the single alignment of the whole set of 4,640 virus RdRp sequences and 1,028 RT sequences.\n\nDuring the clustering procedure, 50 virus RdRp clusters, consisting of 1 to 545 sequences, were defined. These clusters represented either well-established groups of related viruses (roughly comparable to the ICTV family rank) or, in case of poorly characterized and unclassified viruses, groups of well-aligned RdRps that were clearly distinct from others. In all cases, uncertainties were treated conservatively, i.e., favoring placing sequences with questionable relatedness into separate clusters. Additionally, RT sequences were placed into two clusters consisting of group II intron RTs and non-LTR retrotransposon RTs. For each cluster consisting of three or more sequences, an approximate maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was constructed from the cluster-specific alignment using the FastTree program (129) (Whelan and Goldman [WAG] evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site rates) with sites that contained more than 50% gaps removed from the alignment. Trees were rooted using a variant of the midpoint rooting procedure such that the differences between the (weighted) average root-to-tip distances in the subtrees on the opposite sides of the root were minimized.\n\nTo resolve the structure of the global relationships, up to five representatives from each cluster were selected using the within-cluster trees to ensure the diversity of the selected sequences. This procedure resulted in a set of 228 virus RdRps and 10 RTs. The alignments of the selected sequences were extracted from the master alignment and filtered for sites containing more than 50% gaps. A ML phylogenetic tree was reconstructed for the resulting alignment using PhyML (48) (Le Gascuel [LG] evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site rates and empirical amino acid frequencies; support values were calculated using aBayes method implemented in PhyML). Another form of branch support, i.e., bootstrap support provided by the transfer (BOOSTER) phylogenetic bootstrap method (130) , was also used to assess the reliability of the major tree divisions. Alternatively, the same RdRp alignment was used as the input for ML phylogenetic analysis using RAxML (LG evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site rates and empirical amino acid frequencies).\n\nRdRps in the global tree were divided into 5 major branches (supergroups). Up to 15 representatives from each cluster were selected to form supergroup-level alignments. The respective trees were reconstructed from these alignments using the same procedure (PhyML tree with LG evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site rates and empirical amino acid frequencies).\n\nThe overall tree was assembled manually by first replacing the supergroup representatives in the global tree with the supergroup trees and then replacing the cluster representatives with the cluster trees. The lower-level trees were rooted according to the arrangement of the representatives in the upper-level tree.\n\nIdentification of protein domains. Protein domains were identified using a representative set of RNA virus genomes, including representative members of ICTV-approved virus families and unclassified virus groups. This set was annotated manually using sensitive profile-profile comparisons with the HHsuite package (127) , and hmm profiles for annotated proteins or their domains were generated by running one iteration of HHblits against the latest (October 2017) uniclust30 database (131) . Each annotated profile was assigned to a functional category (e.g., \u0409capsid protein_jelly-roll,\u0409 \u0409chymotrypsinlike protease\u0409). These profiles were used to annotate the genomes of all of the viruses that were included in the RdRp phylogenetic analysis and for which complete (or near-complete) genome sequences were available. Profiles for the latter proteins were generated by running one iteration of Jackhmmer (132) against the UniRef50 database. Protein regions that did not have significant hits were extracted and clustered with cluster analysis of sequences (CLANS) (133) , and groups containing at least three members were identified, annotated (if possible), and added to the manually annotated profile database. The last step of the domain identification procedure was then repeated using the updated RNA virus profile database. Highly similar viruses (with identical domain organizations and \u03fe94% identical RdRps) were removed from the data set. In addition, only one representative genome was retained for some members of overrepresented species (e.g., Hepacivirus C). Many genomes (e.g., alphaviruses, tombusviruses, and nidoviruses) encoded readthrough proteins, resulting in domains from the shorter protein contained within the longer readthrough protein. Such redundancies were removed by filtering out the shorter of the two proteins sharing \u03fe80% identity. The final set of annotated genomes included 2,839 viruses.\n\nReconstruction of the history of gene gain and loss. The protein domains identified in the 2,839 virus genomes were mapped onto the composite tree of virus RdRps. A set of 500 representatives was chosen among the (mostly complete) genomes. The domain complement data and the respective tree were analyzed using the GLOOME program (51) . Domain gains and losses were inferred at each tree branch using the difference of posterior probabilities for the domain occurrence in the nodes at the proximal and the distal ends of the branch (differences with values above 0.5 imply gain; differences with values below \u03ea0.5 imply loss).\n\nClustering analysis. The SJR CP network was generated by performing all-against-all comparisons of the SJR CP profiles. To generate hmm profiles, SJR CP sequences were extracted from the total proteome of RNA viruses and two iterations of HHblits were performed against the uniprot20_2016_02 database. The resulting profiles were compared to each other with HHsearch (127) . Their similarity P values were extracted from the result files and used as an input for CLANS program (133) . Clusters were identified using a network-based algorithm implemented in CLANS. Resulting clusters were manually inspected and refined.\n\nAnalysis of bipartite gene-genome networks. A bipartite network was built to study the patterns of gene sharing among viral genomes (44, 106) . After removal of genomes with fewer than 2 domains and of domains that appeared in less than 3 genomes, the network consisted of 2,829 nodes, of which 2,515 corresponded to genomes and 314 to domains. Genome and domain nodes were connected by links wherever a domain was present in a genome. A consensus community detection approach was used to identify the modules of the network (134, 135) . First, we ran 500 replicas with Infomap (136) (bipartite setting, using domains as factors) and built a similarity matrix by assigning to each pair of nodes a similarity value equal to the fraction of replicas in which both nodes were placed in the same module. Then, hierarchical clustering was performed on the similarity matrix, setting the number of clusters equal to the median number of modules obtained in the 500 replicas. Order statistics local optimization method (Oslom) software (137) was subsequently used to filter significant modules with a P value threshold equal to 0.05. To detect higher-order (super)modules, we first identified connector domains as those present in at least 2 modules with prevalence greater than 0.65. The second-order network, composed of 54 modules and 34 connector domains, was searched for second-order modules with Infomap (500 replicas, bipartite setting with connector domains as factors). Due to the small size of the second-order network, consensus community detection did not qualitatively improve the results of the search, and therefore we took the replica with the best Infomap score and skipped hierarchical clustering for this and subsequent steps of the higher-order module search. After assessing statistical significance with Oslom, 4 second-order modules were recovered, encompassing 12 of the original modules associated with closely related virus families. A third-order network was built by pooling the 4 second-order modules with the 46 modules that remained unmerged. The third-order network was analyzed in the same manner to obtain the 9 supermodules. None of these supermodules was assessed by Oslom as significant.\n\nQuantification of virus host range diversity. Known hosts or, in case of viruses isolated from holobionts, virus sources were identified for 3,456 viruses. The host taxonomy (analyzed to the phylum level) was mapped to the leaves of the combined tree. The tree was ultrametrized, and the weights were computed for all leaves as described in reference 138. Each internal node of the tree therefore defines a set of leaves with assigned hosts; the distribution of (weighted) relative frequencies of hosts can be characterized by its Shannon entropy. Each leaf has one host defined such that the entropy of the host range distribution is 0 whereas the host diversity is maximal at the root. The entropy generally declines along the tree because viruses that belong to relatively shallow branches tend to share their host ranges. The node depth versus node host range entropy data were averaged for each major branch separately using a Gaussian kernel with a bandwidth equal to 10% of the total tree depth.\n\nSupplemental material for this article may be found at https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio .02329-18.
