{"title": "Major reduction of rotavirus, but not norovirus, gastroenteritis in children seen in hospital after the introduction of RotaTeq vaccine into the National Immunization Programme in Finland", "body": "Rotaviruses (RVs) and noroviruses (NVs) are the two most common causative agents of acute gastroenteritis (GE) in children <5 years of age in Finland [17, 27] . In all resourcerich countries combined, RVs and NVs cause annually an estimated 1,500,000 episodes of GE requiring a hospital visit [22] .\n\nA major reduction in severe RVGE has already happened or is expected to happen in countries with extensive use of vaccines against RV [21] . As a consequence, while overall severe GE is expected to decrease, the proportional role of NVs in childhood GE is likely to increase for NV to become the leading cause of GE requiring in-hospital admission [10, 12] .\n\nIn Finland, RV vaccines were licensed in 2006, and the vaccination coverage rose from 0 to about 30 % between 2006 and 2008. In this pre-National Immunization Programme (NIP) period, we conducted a 2-year prospective study on RVs and NVs as causative agents of GE in children and found RVs to account for 52 % and NVs to account for 25 % of GE seen in hospital [27] .\n\nIn the season 2008-2009, no prospective surveillance was ongoing. RV vaccination with exclusive use of bovine-human reassortant RV vaccine RotaTeq\u00ae (RV5, Merck & Co. Inc.; in Europe, Sanofi Pasteur MSD) was included into the Finnish NIP on 1 September 2009. The coverage of vaccination rose quickly to over 90 % and reached a level 95-97 %, similar to other vaccines in NIP (source: National Institute for Health and Welfare [THL] , Finland). The present study, following the same methodology as the pre-NIP study, was started at the same time with the introduction of RotaTeq into the NIP and continued for a 2-year period 2009-2011. This enabled us to compare the absolute numbers and proportions of RVs and NVs in acute GE (AGE) seen in the hospital before and after universal RV vaccination.\n\nThe prospective study was conducted at Tampere University Hospital from September 2009 to August 2011. The hospital is the pediatric referral center for the Pirkanmaa Hospital District, a mainly urban area with a birth cohort of approximately 6,000 children. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Pirkanmaa Hospital District.\n\nAll children under 16 years of age seen in the emergency room (ER) or admitted to a pediatric ward with AGE were eligible for enrolment. Prior to enrolment, a parent or legal guardian provided a written informed consent for participation.\n\nParents were interviewed about their child's symptoms before the hospital visit and about their child's RV vaccination. A study nurse confirmed the vaccination status from the records of the respective well baby clinic. A stool specimen was collected during the hospital visit in the ER or at the hospital ward.\n\nIf the child had required more than one ER visit or hospitalization due to AGE during the study period and if there were more than seven symptom-free days between them, they were considered as two separate episodes.\n\nAll stool specimens were tested for the presence of RV and human caliciviruses (including NVs and sapoviruses [SaVs]) using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, as described previously [8, 15, [25] [26] [27] .\n\nAfter the detection of RV, the G and P genotypes were determined by nucleotide sequencing of the gene segments encoding for the VP7 and VP4 antigens. The gene segment encoding for VP6 protein was also sequenced to determine the presence of vaccine-derived virus [13] .\n\nAfter the detection of human caliciviruses, RT-PCR typing targeting region C at the beginning of the NV capsid region in open reading frame 2 was done with primers JV21, JV24, and JV24mod [3, 35] . The NV genotypes were defined as the polymerase region A/capsid region C genotype.\n\nRV-positive and NV-positive PCR products were sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA).\n\nNucleotide sequences read from the chromatograms were aligned to published sequences from GenBank (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and from the Food-borne Viruses in Europe network (http://www.rivm.nl; National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, The Netherlands).\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the age distributions of RVGE and using the chi-square test to calculate the reductions in RVGE between the two study years and two reference years; both tests were performed in SPSS, version 20.0 (SPSS). All tests were two-tailed and a p value <0.05was considered to be statistically significant.\n\nThe results were compared to reference years of 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 (both seasons from September to August), during which prospective surveillance for RV AGE had been conducted in the same setting using the same methodology [27, 29] . In the second study year in late 2007, an extensive waterborne AGE outbreak occurred in the town of Nokia caused by massive contamination of drinking water by sewage water [27, 28] . We excluded 65 patients associated with this outbreak from the comparative NV analysis to better reflect a normal situation of endemic NVGE [7, 16, 20, 36] . For the RV analysis, those patients were not excluded. \n\nIn 2009-2011, of the 330 cases with AGE with a stool specimen, 86 (26 %) were found to have a wild-type RV in stools; 34 of those were treated as outpatients and 52 were hospitalized. Compared to reference years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 (combined) , this means an 81 % reduction of RV AGE in the outpatient clinic (34 vs. 177 cases) and a 76 % reduction in hospital ward admissions (52 vs. 219 cases) (Fig. 1) .\n\nThe total reduction of all RVGE cases was 80 % during the study years and the proportion of RVGE cases of all AGE cases was decreased from 52 % (421 cases) in the two reference years to 26 % (86 cases) in the two study years combined. The total reduction was statistically significant with p<0.001.\n\nRV was found in 43 cases each (27 and 25 %, respectively) of 160 and 170 stool samples obtained in the first and the second season after NIP, respectively. In the first RV epidemic season, the majority of RV-positive AGE cases were seen relatively late between March 2010 and May 2010, whereas in the second season, the most active months were between January 2011 and March 2011 (Fig. 1) .\n\nThe age distribution of the children with RVGE was from 7 months to 14 years 6 months. The predominant RV types in the two seasons 2009 to 2010 and 2010 to 2011, combined, were G1P [8] (n=38, 44 %) and G4P [8] (n=30, 35 %). In the first season, genotype G4P [8] (n=18, 42 %) was slightly more common than G1P [8] (n=15, 35 %), but in the second season, genotype G1P [8] was more predominant with 53 % (n=23) over G4P [8] (n = 13, 30 %). Other common RV genotypes G2P [4] , G3P [8] , and G9P [8] were all seen to a lesser extent (n=9, n=1, and n=6, respectively, counted from all RVpositive AGE cases in the two seasons combined). In two cases, more than one RV type was found in stools simultaneously: in one case, G1P [8] with G3P [8] and, in the other, G3P [8] with G9P [8] . Other than the predominance of G9P [8] genotype in the season of 2006-2007, no great changes in the genotype distribution were observed during the study years compared to the reference years (data not shown).\n\nAmong the 86 wild-type RV-positive cases, there were 4 children who had received at least 1 dose of RotaTeq\u00ae and 1 child who had received Rotarix\u2122 before the introduction of NIP. Three of those who had received RotaTeq\u00ae were fully vaccinated (two were detected with G4P [8] in the stools and one was detected with G9P [8] in the stools) and one had received only one dose and was detected with G4P [8] RV. The child who had received Rotarix\u2122 was also fully vaccinated with two doses and was detected with the G4P [8] genotype. Two of the four breakthrough cases, 9-and 10month-old fully vaccinated boys (RotaTeq\u00ae), were admitted to the pediatric ward and the other two were seen in the ER only.\n\nWe identified three cases of GE in young infants shedding a human-bovine double reassortant G1P [8] vaccine virus. This human-bovine double reassortant was also detected from one patient infected concomitantly with NV. Furthermore, one patient was detected with RotaTeq\u00ae vaccine virus G6P [8] and 16 patients were detected to shed the original vaccine virus G1P [5] or just the VP7 G1 part of it separately or detected with several VP4 proteins. No patients were detected with Rotarix\u2122 vaccine strain after 2006-2008. The vaccine-associated cases have been reported separately [13] . (Fig. 4) .\n\nCompared to the reference years, the proportion and the absolute number of SaV-positive GE increased from 1.6 % (12 cases) to 7.0 % (23 cases). A clear seasonality was seen in the NVGE both in the study years and in the reference years (Fig. 3) . The most active months when the majority of NVpositive cases were seen were between January and April in each year.\n\nOf all 111 NV-positive cases, 108 (97 %) were genogroup GII strains and 72 (65 %) were genotype GII.4 (37 (71 % of 52 cases) and 35 (59 % of 59 cases) in the first and the second study years, respectively). In the reference years, genotype GII.4 was even more common with 89 % proportion (175 of 196 cases). The other genotypes detected were GII.b (14 %, n=15), GII.7 (13 %, n=14), GII.g (5 %, n=6), The absolute number of GE cases due to other pathogens decreased from 191 cases in the reference years to 108 cases in the study years. Of 108 cases, 53 % (57 cases) detected in the two study years was admitted to a pediatric ward and 47 % (51 cases) was treated as outpatients. RV, NV, or SaV could be detected in the stools in 70 % of all 186 cases admitted to a pediatric ward due to GE and, conversely, 30 % was negative for these viruses (Fig. 4) . The absolute number of children who were admitted due to GE and were negative for RV, NV, or SaV decreased from 101 cases in the reference years to 57 cases in the study years. Even though a systematic search for other GE viruses was not performed, some of these patients were found to have other viral agents such as human bocavirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, and coronavirus in their stools [30, 31] . In the emergency department, 35 % (51 of 144 cases) of the children seen for GE symptoms were negative for RV, NV, or SaV. All hospital admissions due to all AGE decreased by 57 % from 434 cases in the reference years to 186 cases in the study years, and the proportion of outpatient clinic visits decreased by 62 % from 375 to 144 cases.\n\nIn this study, we examined the impact of the National RV Immunization Programme (NIP) on hospitalizations and outpatient clinic visits due to GE in one hospital. The coverage population of the Tampere University Hospital is about one tenth of Finland, and the results may be generalized for the whole country.\n\nWe detected a significant reduction in outpatient AGE visits and hospital admissions due to RV (81 and 76 %, respectively) in the 2-year post-NIP period in the entire children population. Similar reductions with the exclusive use of RotaTeq have been observed previously from the USA [32, 33, 37] and from countries using both two available RV vaccines [2, 4, 23] .\n\nWe did not observe further reduction in RVGE between first Our study supports the evidence of herd protection in children too old to be vaccinated that have been observed in three studies from the USA after the widespread use of RV vaccines [5, 9, 37] . We observed that the reduction in RVGE cases was statistically significant in every age group. The decrease in hospitalizations in children too old to be vaccinated was 72 %, similar to the findings from the USA (70-79 %) [5, 9, 37] . We found no cases of wild-type RVGE in children <6 months of age. In contrast, in the USA, no reduction in infants <3 months of age, who had been too young to be vaccinated, was observed [5, 9, 37] . Additionally, we observed that the median age distribution of RVGE cases had shifted toward older children.\n\nThe high level of herd protection in our study probably resulted from high vaccine coverage. In Austria, no evidence of herd protection was found with vaccine coverage of 57 % in 2007 (RotaTeq) [2] . The reason for herd protection is probably interruption of RV transmission among all children. Exposure of unvaccinated children to vaccine virus shed in the stools of vaccinated infants is possible but unlikely to explain herd protection. Such transmission of vaccine-acquired virus resulting to a symptomatic RVGE has been reported in several countries [24] . In our study, we detected shedding of vaccine virus in a number of children, but all were recently vaccinated and none was unvaccinated.\n\nAfter the introduction of the RV vaccine into the vaccination program, several studies have detected unusual nonvaccine-included RV strains, such as G8 or G12, or changes in the genotype distribution [14] . However, none of these changes were observed in our study.\n\nIn addition, we observed that the impact of RV vaccination was reflected as decreased hospital admissions and outpatient clinic visits for GE of any cause. Compared to the pre-NIP period, there was a 57 % reduction in cases admitted to the hospital ward for all GE. The reduction was higher than the reduction rates observed in previous studies from the USA (29-52 %) [5, 6, 37] .\n\nIn addition, we observed a reduction of 62 % in all outpatient clinic visits for GE of any cause. Interestingly, such a reduction in all outpatient clinic visits has not been reported from countries where the protective effect of RV vaccination in unvaccinated children has been observed [10, 12] .\n\nThe important role of NV as a causative agent of endemic (not outbreak-associated) GE in children was first discovered in Finland in connection with an efficacy trial of RotaShield vaccine [18] . In the same study, it was observed that RV vaccine (RotaShield) did not have any effect on NVGE. In that sense, the present findings on the impact of universal RV vaccination on NVGE are (only) confirmatory, and we conclude that the RotaTeq vaccination program does not reduce NVGE. The slight decrease observed in the study vs. reference years may well be explained by natural annual variation. In a decade, there has been considerable year to year variation of NVGE, although the winter epidemic has occurred every year [26] .\n\nIn reverse, other viruses and notably NVs could theoretically replace RV after its elimination by universal vaccination and fill the available niche as a major causative agent of AGE in children. Our results strongly suggest that such a replacement is not happening. Overall hospitalizations have been reduced according to the share of RV, and NV has become a leading cause of GE only in relative terms, without any increase in absolute numbers.\n\nThe reduction of all hospitalizations (57 %) and outpatient clinic visits (62 %) due to GE is well in line with what was observed in the prelicensure efficacy trial (REST) of the RotaTeq vaccine in Finland. RotaTeq reduced all-cause GE requiring medical intervention by 65 % over a period of 3.1 years [34] . To compare the numbers, it should be noted that the present population-based study also includes children who were eligible for vaccination but did not receive it (initially about 10 %, decreasing to 5 % over time).\n\nThe present study focused on NV and was not intended as a full etiological examination of GE. Hospitalizations due to GE not associated with RV or NV seemed to decrease somewhat in comparison with the reference years. This observation should be viewed with caution, and a detailed etiological study of GE viruses should be performed before conclusions. However, even though the RV vaccine had no effect on NVGE, it is nevertheless possible that RV vaccination might have a \"nonspecific\" effect on non-RVassociated GE. Some suggestive evidence of RV vaccine (RotaShield) effect on adenovirus GE was seen in the study in the 1990s [19] .\n\nThe new leading role of NV as the main causative agent of AGE in children supports the concept of developing an NV vaccine for use in children [11] . Such a vaccine is foreseen and being developed [1] .\n\nRV in the NIP of Finland had an immediate and major impact on RVGE cases seen in hospital, i.e., severe RVGE. The age distribution of children with RVGE has shifted upwards at the same time as a statistically significant decrease in every age group was observed as an evidence of herd protection. The impact of RV vaccination was reflected in a decrease of all hospital admissions and outpatient clinic visits for GE, while NV has become the leading cause of AGE in children seen in hospital."}
