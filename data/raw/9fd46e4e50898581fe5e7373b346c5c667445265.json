{"title": "I P103q Activity of Penciclovir (PCV) in vitro against Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Wild Strains (WS) and against Strain AD169", "body": "The pooled ICsos of PCV (all CMV strains) were significantly higher than those of ACV, GCV, and FOS (P < 0.0001 for each comparison). However, the ICs0 values obtained must also be considered in the context of the pharmacokinetic and toxicologic properties of the drugs tested, and the activity of PCV against CMV should be further investigated in vivo. Twelve patients with different forms of haematological malignancies underwent autologous (n = 6) or allogeneic (n = 6) BMT were tested. The materials (blood sera and nasal swabs) were collected each 2 weeks during 6 months in pre-and post-transplantation period. Nasal swabs were washed with l ml PBS and the material was subjected to sedimentation. The sedimented nasal epithelium cells were used for direct immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy, which was performed with fluorescein-conjugated antibodies (Abs) to respiratory viruses and Mycoplatma pneumoniae (Mp). The supernatant was used for detection of mucosal Abs. The detection of these Abs as well as Abs in blood sera was performed in Indirect Haemagglutination Test (IHA) with viral (Injuenra fypes 1, 2 and 3, Adenovinrs, Rezpirntory syn6tial virus, Coronavincc) and Mp antigens. Bacterial and fungal infections were diagnosed microbiologically In all 56 episodes of infection were diagnosed. In 54 of these episodes mixed Mp-viral infection was demonstrated. Twenty five (45%) episodes were detected in immunosuppressed patients during the period of profound neutropenia immediately after BMT. The clinical manifestations of invasive bacterial infections caused by Eschm'chia coli, Mebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomom amginosa were more severe 111 the episodes of preexisting respiratory viral-Mp infection. So the viral-mycoplasmal respiratory infection decreases the resistance to bacteria in immunosuppressed patients. The immune response in the patients was characterized by dramatic decrease in blood Abs level whereas the mucosal Abs changed similarly to those in immunocompetent patients. We conclude that viral-mycoplasmal infection enhances the immunodepression in immunosuppressed patients especially the general immune response rather than the local one and these infections must be caremy controlled.\n\nU. Jacobs, D. Niese, H.-U. Klehr. Medical Dept, Univenify Hosp, Bonn, Germ Objectives: Enhanced allogenity by CMV may induce acute rejections as well as chronic transplant (TP) damage via endothelial and mitogenic lesions.\n\nMethods: In a subset of 113 renal allografted patients (P) we analysed CMV incidence, onset, risk profile and evaluated earliness and sensitivity of cytoimmunological (lymphocyte subsets by FACS) and viral diagnostic work-up weekly after TX (pp65-early antigen (EA) (+ PCR) + CMV-IgM-titer (ELJSA techn.) + virus isolation in urine and throat swab), as well as the impact of early virustatic intervention on acute and long-term TP function and suMval. CMV disease defined as combination of one viral parameter plus organ deterioration.\n\nResults: Incidence of CMV disease was 31% posttransplant, 58% of all associated with monoclonal antibody therapy (OKT3) for acute rejection. Independently of recipient status pretransplant positive donor CMVIgG increased risk of disease up to 70%. In addition to earliness diagnostic sensitivity of CD4/CD8 inversion (93%) was > pp-65 early antigen (56%) > IgM seroconversion (33%) > virus isolation (10%). In P with recurrent CMV disease PCR was more a marker for lnfection regardless of disease. Leucocytes decreased from 8.6 f 1.4 to 4.2 f 1.8/nl. Clinally the predictive value of a characteristic nocturnal hyperhidrosis all P with CMV disease complained about was accompanied with the CD4/CD8 inversion-decrease of CD4-lymphocytes and increase of CD8-lymphocytes resulting in a ratio <1-even preceding acute organ deterioration. The degree of inversion reflected severity of CMV disease course and the diagnostic value of this parameter was not impaired even in P on monoclonal antibodies. Consequent virustatic therapy contributed to improvement of transplant function with decrease of serum-creatinine &om 3.2 f 1.2 to 1.6 f 0.5 mg/dl. There were no adverse effects associated with ganciclovir and no drug resistance. One year graft suMval was improved up to 97% without any CMV complication. Statistical analysis after 2.7 f 1.2 yrs follow-up period excluded any remaining impact of previous CMV disease on longterm TP function (actuarial creatinine and proteinuria). \n\nObjective: Renal transplant survival rate could be improved up to 96% throughout the last 3 years in our transplant care unit due to efficacy of OKT-3 in steroid resistant acute rejection episodes and early intervention in CMV infection often knked to this strong immunosuppressive regime. But there is only small experience with reactivation of HHV-6 infection in transplantation esp. for its treatment.\n\nCase Report: We therefore report on a 66 y old male patient @) sufTering from a severe dection with fever up to 4loC, leucopenia, fatigue and transplant dysfunction 13 weeks after allografang. He had overcome 3 rejection episodes treated with cortisone, ATG and OKT-3 twice resp.. A primary CMV infection transmitted by positive donor transplant manifestated after the hrst OKT-3 course requiring ganciclovir. Now by weekly wal work-up CMV reactivation could be excluded. But there was evidence for a strong viral infection from conthously decreasing CD4/CD8 inversion within lymphocyte subsets. By means of standardued weekly viral monitoring HHV-6-IgM antibodies were detected fluorescenceserologically to a high degree for the first time. Up to that date the p was only known to be HHV-6-XgG positive.\n\nSirmkr to CMV infection there is strong serological evidence of wide-spread HHV-6 lnfection in the general population, but, so far, the only disease definitely h k e d to HHV-6 is exanthema subitum in chlldhood and therapeutic effects of antiviral agents have been tested only in vim. In our p by the onset and consequently virustatic treatment with gancidovir the allograft function could be improved after IgM-seroconversion was overcome. Serum-creatinine decreased h m 448 to 131 wmol/L and leucocytes recovered. In the one year follow-up now a stable renal transplant function under conventional thempy with cyclosporine, steroids and azathioprine is maintained.\n\nConclusions: Repeated dosage regime of OKT-3 may trigger severe HHV-6 infection reactivation resulting in transplant damage. Daerential bgnosis should focus on rhu, virus in transplantation esp after exclusion of CMV Ganciclovir revealed to be a potent antiviral agent in HHV-6 infection in vivo. Methods: DNA h m leukocytes was isolated by glass beads. A semiquantitative nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with two sets of primers to M E region was used. The sensitivity of PCR was 5-10 copies of viral genom. IgM were determined by ELISA.\n\nResults: Samples (blood, saliva and urine) of 16 patients after transplantations (1-3 months) were investigated. These patients had no acute symptoms of CMV-disease, but had minor unclear c h c a l symptoms. 8 patients had CMV DNA in blood by PCR <lo0 copies in lo5 leukocytes. 6 (75%) h m these had CMV DNA in urine and 5 (62%) also in saliva. 2 of these fell in CMV-disease later with rising of CMV DNA level. Among 8 others PCR-negative in blood patients 4 had CMV DNA in urine and in saliva. 3 of these 4 padents were after effective ganciclovir therapy. Others 4 had no CMV DNA neither in urine nor in saliva. That patients, who had no or very low DNA signal in blood, had intensive DNA signal Recipients in urine or saliva, if it was. IgM positive were 2 patients, who had anti-CMV drug therapy early.\n\nThe results obtained by PCR in blood of patients without acute onset of CMV-disease, don't coincide with that in urine and saliva. CMV DNA present in Werent biological materials. In urine and in saliva the amounts of viral DNA were essential, but in blood the levels of CMV DNA without symptoms of CMV-base in patients were very low. The semiquantitative detection of CMV DNA in blood is more successful for &ease diagnosis than in urine and in saliva. Methods: DNA from leukocytes was isolated by glass beads. A semiquantitative nested PCR with two sets of primers to M E region was used. The sensitivity of PCR was 5-10 copies of viral DNA. IgG and IgM were determined by ELISA.\n\nResults: 72 patients (67-renal, 3-heart, 2-BMT) were investigated 29 patients were CMV-positive by PCR. The quantity of CMV DNA correlated with clinical manifestations. 9 patients with more than 1000 copies of viral DNA in lo5 leukocytes had acute CMV disease. The blood samples h m patients with active CMV-infection were drawn in intervals 4-14 days after transplantation. 6 from 8 patients with 100-1000 copies had subfebrile temperature andlor gastrointestinal symptoms. After effective ganciclovir therapy wal DNA cleaned as a rule. But in 4 patients without clin~cal symptoms CMV DNA was detected 2 4 months after. IgM and IgG antibodies correlated with CMV disease badly. Among anti-CMV IgM-positive samples 42.3% were PCR-positive, and among IgM-negative samples 31.8% were PCR-positive @ > 0.05). IgM antibodies and CMV DNA in blood of the patient with BMT were detected during 2 months after finish of drug therapy without rise of IgG antibody titres and without clinical symptoms. These IgM antibodies also appeared 4 weeks later, than CMV DNA at the onset of disease.\n\nConclusions: PCR is direct and very sensitive method for diagnosis of active CMV mfection. The amount of CMV DNA >lo00 copies in lo5 leukocytes correlated with CMV disease. IgM and IgG detection had low &agnostic value. Objectives: To estimate the incidence rate of HCV infection and to analyze the HCV genoeypes in three-year-follow-up study of cMdren with leukemias and lymphomas undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nMethods: The studied group consisted of 148 children, without HCV antibodies (HCVAb) at the time of the diagnosis. HCVAbs were estimated with EIA test of IInd generation (Organon Tekmka) Presence of HCV-RNA partides and their genotypes were detected by nested PCR method and line probe assay (Inno-Lipa HCV 11).\n\nResults: The appearance of HCVAb during therapy was observed in 42 patients (28.4%), in median time 14 months after dmgnosis.\n\nAmong 42 children with positive HCVAb, in 36 patients (85.7%) RNA-HCV was confirmed by PCR result in every examination. 34 of HCV-FWA positive cases were infected with HCV with a slngle genotype, includmg type la in 31 chddren and type l b in 2 patients. Coinfection with two genotypes of HCV was observed in two patients (la+lb). None of the HCV-RNA positive childsen has became negative during 3-year-follow-up study.\n\nConclusions: Persistence of viremia in the HCV-mfected patients can be explained by the therapy-induced immunosuppression. The same HCV genotype in almost 90% of analyzed children strongly suggest the common source of HCV lnfection The infectivity of those children should be seriously considered during chemotherapy.\n\nThis work has been sponsored by KBN grant No 4POSE 029 08. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) lnfection remains the most frequent mfection after allogeneic bone marrow transplant (ABMT). Demonstration of CMV in clinical samples is the principal approach for the diagnosis of CMV infection. Objective: To determine whether the use of prolonged antiviral prophylaxis affect the detection of CMV by shell vial assay (SVA) and conventional cell culture (CC) in surveillance specimens after ABMT.\n\nMethods: A total of 72 patients with ABMT (CMV sero+ and/or donor sero+) were prospectively monitored during 22 weeks for the detection of CMV in blood, urine, throat and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) by SVA and CC in MRC-5 cell line. Of these, 42 received high dose acyclovlr (HD ACV) (500 mg/8 h) from day -5 to +30 after BMT (Group A); and 30 received HD ACV from day -5 to +30 and then, or dadclovir (2 g/6 h) or ACV oral (800 mg/6 h) up to the week 18 post BMT (Group B). These 30 patients were enrolled in a prospective trlal to compare both antiviral prophyhs. Major problem after renal allohansplantations are both, rejection crises and infectious complications, requiring rather a e r e n t therapeutical behaviour. The infections could be of various origin; however, those with wal etiology are bigger problem for transplantologists, nephrologists, immunologists and of course for the patients themselves. The authors of present study examine dynarmcally 78 recipients of renal allografts by using the method of immunologic monitoring, also microbiologic, virologic and biologic tests, as well as the inhence of immunomodulation and antiviral therapy. Altogether 64 infectious complications are registered during the first 3 months after transplantation \u20acor all patients. 38 of 64 (59%)\n\ninfections have viral origin and their etiology is as follows: 13 (of 38) hepatitis, 11 d u e n z a , 6 CMV, 2 adenovd, 2 ECHO, 2 herpes, 2 HIV (1 seropositive and 1 virus-carrier). It is worth-mentioning that our long-term study covers a period of recent 10 years and the 2 patients with HIV etiology of their viral mfectious complications are registered in the first period of investigation, in the time when AIDS-testing had just been considered as obligatory examination in haemodialysis centers. The immunoreactivity type of 38 patients with viral mfections after renal allotransplantation shows lower activity whlch could explain the easy-to-develop lnfectious process h m one hand, but fiom the other hand, it is obvious that those recipients show considerably less number of rejection episodes, compared to other patients with preliminary higher immunoreactivity status. Our model of immunologic monitoring allows a reliable prediction and differentiative magnosis of both, rejections and infections after renal allotransplantation.\n\nF! Reusser, R. Attenhofer, G. Cathomas, M. Tamm, G. Thiel University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland CMV-specific HLA class I-restricted CD8' CTL are thought to play an important role in controlling CMV mfection and disease. PCR-based detection of CMV DNA in blood specimens permits recognition of CMV infection at an early stage. We studied 20 patients (pa) during the first 3 months after RTx who were CMV-seropositive before RTx (18 pts) or seronegative with a seropositive kidney donor (2 pts). The CMV-specific CTL response in peripheral blood was assessed at 1, 2, and 3 months after RTx. Blood mononuclear cells were co-cultured with CMV-infected autologous fibroblasts for 2 weeks, and then tested by C?'-release assay for cytotoxicity against CMV-infected or d e c t e d autologous or HLA-mismatched fibroblasts. The PCR was used for detection of CMV DNA in blood leukocytes once a week. The assay was considered positive if 2 2 consecutive blood specimens were PCR-positive.\n\nIn the first 3 months after RTx, a CMV-specific CTL activity was demonstrable in 11/20 pts (55%), and CMV DNA was detectable in the blood of 18/20 pts (90%) at a median (range) of 23.5 days (8-46). There was no association between the presence of CMV-specific CTLs and of CMV DNA in blood during the month of first CTL detection (P = 0.2). CMV ctsease developed in 7/20 pts (35%). There was an inverse correlation between the presence of a specific CTL response and of CMV &ease after RTx (P = 0.04).\n\nIn conclusion, CMV-specific CTLs do not appear to suppress CMV lnfection as detected by PCR in peripheral blood during the first 3 months after RTx. By contrast, a CMV-specific CTL response mediates protection h m CMV disease during this period after RTx.
