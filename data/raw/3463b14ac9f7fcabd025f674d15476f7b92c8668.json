{"title": "Review Host-directed therapies for infectious diseases: current status, recent progress, and future prospects", "body": "Infectious diseases are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 1 In high-income countries, mortality from respiratory tract infections remains high despite access to quality health services and availability of antibiotic therapy. 1 The intermittent emergence of new zoonotic pathogens and the increasing incidence of treatment-resistant infections draws attention to the limits of the current antimicrobial treatment portfolio and the urgent need for alternative management strategies.\n\nIn evolutionary terms, host-pathogen interactions are dependent on the microbe surviving without causing harm to the host. The host's innate and adaptive immune surveillance mechanisms govern whether the infection will be contained or progress to clinical disease with either recovery or death. Several host factors aff ect antimicrobial treatment outcome and are responsible for progression of disease after infection, poor treatment response, tissue damage, long-term functional disability, and increased mortality. These factors include immune dysregulation from any cause (aberrant or excess host infl ammatory response to infection, stress, immunosuppressive drugs, poor living conditions, socioeconomic factors, micronutrient defi ciencies, HIV, malnutrition, and alcohol or substance misuse) and comorbidity with non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, smoking, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 1 During the past 4 years, a renaissance of scientifi c research strategies targeting host factors, rather than pathogen components directly, has opened up novel treatment approaches termed host-directed therapies. A host-directed therapy is any product that can augment host defence mechanisms or modulate excessive infl ammation, or both, leading to improved clinical treatment outcomes as shown by reduced morbidity, mortality, and end-organ damage, and long-term functional recovery. A range of host-directed therapies have been identifi ed with diff erent mechanisms of action (fi gure 1), and they are now regarded as viable adjuncts to standard antimicrobial treatment. Host-directed therapies can improve host cellular responses to pathogens, target disease-causing virulence factors (fi gure 2), and activate innate and adaptive immune responses and immunological memory (fi gure 3). 2\n\n\u2022 Despite the availability of antimicrobial drugs, infectious diseases are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. \u2022 The widespread emergence of antimicrobial resistance calls for novel interventions in addition to new antimicrobial development. \u2022 A range of host factors are responsible for development of disease, poor treatment response, and increased mortality. These include immune dysregulation from any cause and comorbidity with non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, smoking, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \u2022 During the past 4 years, a renaissance of scientifi c research strategies targeting host factors-rather than pathogen components directly-is leading to development of a wide range of host-directed therapies that target and modify biological pathways to achieve a positive clinical treatment outcome. \u2022 Host-directed therapies can augment host cellular responses to pathogens, target disease-causing virulence factors, activate innate and adaptive protective immune responses, or modulate excessive infl ammation, leading to reduced morbidity, mortality, and end-organ damage. \u2022 Host-directed therapies include commonly used, safe, and cheap drugs for non-communicable diseases; biologics; nutritional products; and cellular therapy, using the patient's own immune or mesenchymal stromal cells. \u2022 The broad spectrum effi cacy of host-directed therapies could also be useful for treatment of infectious diseases with epidemic potential, which are associated with high mortality. \u2022 Host-directed therapies have the additional unique benefi t of preventing or reducing the development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nExamples of host-directed therapies include commonly used and aff ordable drugs for non-communicable diseases with good safety profi les, immunomodulatory agents, biologics, nutritional products, and cellular therapy using the patient's own immune or mesenchymal stromals cells (table 1) . See appendix for discussion of potential host factors for targets of host-directed therapy against infectious disease. Studies of host-directed therapies also enable new insights into underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis, infl ammatory pathways, and the host's innate and acquired immune responses. In this Review we discuss clinically relevant examples of progress in identifi cation of candidate host-directed therapies as adjunct treatment options for bacterial, viral, and parasitic infectious diseases.\n\nTuberculosis is the most common cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide. 89 Since the declaration of tuberculosis as a global emergency in 1993 by WHO, there has been a major focus on development of new drugs that target Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative pathogen. For decades, the notion that M tuberculosis is the sole cause of the continuing worldwide tuberculosis pandemic has led to a focus on treatment of patients with tuberculosis with WHO-recommended combination antituberculosis antibiotic therapy. This focus still thrives, although there are about 2 billion people in the world with latent tuberculosis infection who do not develop active disease. 89 Furthermore, the substantial decline in tuberculosis in Europe and North America in the fi rst half of the 19th century occurred well before the antibiotic era. In 2014, an estimated 1\u00b75 million people died of tuberculosis and there were an estimated 450 000 cases of multidrugresistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, 89 suggesting that host factors have an important role in achieving anti-M tuberculosis immune responses. M tuberculosis is largely intracellular in nature, and intact T-cell responses (T-helper-1 [Th1] CD4 cytotoxic lymphocytes, CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes, and natural killer T cells) and interferon-\u03b3 production are needed to restrict M tuberculosis growth. 90 Pulmonary tissue pathology, substantial tissue destruction, and subdued protective anti-M tuberculosis immune responses are noted in patients with tuberculosis who are predominantly aff ected by tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-mediated infl ammation. 91 Improving treatment for both drug-sensitive and MDR tuberculosis is a high priority. Few new anti-M tuberculosis drugs are in clinical assessment and some have substantial safety concerns. Furthermore, resistance is Host-directed therapies focus on ameliorating the severity of disease and improving treatment outcomes. Host-directed therapies constitute a range of therapeutic agents such as repurposed drugs, small molecules, synthetic nucleic acids, biologics (such as monoclonal antibodies), cytokines, cellular therapy, recombinant proteins, and micronutrients.\n\nwww.thelancet.com/infection Vol 16 April 2016 e49 Review likely to develop against new tuberculosis drugs. The greatest clinical needs for tuberculosis treatment are interventions that could reduce the lengthy duration of tuberculosis therapy (currently 6 months in patients with drug-sensitive tuberculosis and 18-24 months in patients with MDR or XDR tuberculosis), thus improving patient compliance and reducing long-term toxicity; invigorate immune responses to eradicate or contain M tuberculosis; dampen excessive infl ammation and repair tissue damage to prevent long-term pulmonary damage and functional disability; and reduce the high mortality from MDR and XDR tuberculosis.\n\nThere is an expanding portfolio of host-directed therapies for use as adjunct treatments to tuberculosis therapy for improving treatment outcomes, shortening the duration of therapy, and reducing lung pathology and long-term functional disability for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis (table 2) . 91, 133 Other host-directed therapies may decrease local infl ammatory tissue pathology, including that caused by tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution infl am matory syndrome. Examples of hostdirected therapies currently being developed are cellular therapy using the patient's own bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells; 133 repurposing commonly used drugs for diabetes, epilepsy, peptic ulcers, hypercholesterolaemia, asthma, cancer, and arthritis; micronutrients and other immune-modulators; antimicrobial peptide inducers and checkpoint inhibitors; specifi c immune-based therapies; and therapeutic vaccines. Multinational consortia have been established to take these therapies forward in controlled clinical trials.\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive bacterium that remains a major cause of childhood and adult morbidity and mortality worldwide, 134 despite the availability of eff ective antibiotic therapy. It is largely associated with community-acquired pneumonia, and often causes invasive pneumococcal disease, aff ecting any organ in the body. 135 Both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses operate in preventing disease in human beings. 136 The pathogenesis of pneumonia is associated with overt infl ammatory responses that eventually cause lung damage and death. 137 Thus, several adjunctive host-directed interventions are being investigated.\n\nThe use of corticosteroids in pneumonia remains controversial, and data to support the use of cortico steroids in cases of community-acquired pneumonia are limited. In a prospective randomised clinical study of 785 patients with community-acquired pneumonia, prednisolone led to overall improved survival after treatment, concomitant with slightly shorter hospital stay and reduced need for mechanical ventilators, compared with placebo. 3 Corticosteroids can also prevent hearing loss and other neurological sequelae in bacterial meningitis. 138 Although the clinical use of macrolide antibiotics specifi cally targets the causative bacteria, macrolides might have an additional host-directed eff ect in treating community-acquired pneumonia. Preclinical assessment of azithromycin in mice after secondary S pneumoniae infection following primary exposure to infl uenza A virus potentiated anti-infl ammatory eff ects marked by reduction in neutrophil infl ux, and promoted dampening of immunopathological outcome in the lungs. 21 Retrospective and prospective studies [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] have shown that macrolidecontaining antibiotic regimens decrease mortality in patients with community-acquired pneu monia, although other studies [28] [29] [30] have shown no signifi cant benefi t from these regimens. Addition of a macrolide to a fl uoroquinolone seems to provide some improvement in Figure 2 : Host-directed therapies as a means to counteract antimicrobial resistance Pathogens develop resistance to antimicrobial therapy via various factors, including modifi cation of cell-surface proteins and intracellular enzymes (bacteria and parasites), modifi cation of envelope proteins (viruses), secretion of toxins (bacteria and parasites), sporulation and dormancy (bacteria, viruses, and fungi), activation of effl ux pumps (bacteria, fungi, and parasites), and decreased permeability of cell wall (bacteria and fungi). These virulence factors impede cellular functions (solid blockade), which are required to successfully eradicate the pathogen. Host-directed therapies can counter these mechanisms by targeting impaired intracellular processes in aff ected host cells (blue arrow), by mechanisms such as activation of autophagy and apoptosis, induction of oxidative and nitrosative stress, and increased antigen processing and presentation, which in turn trigger necessary adaptive immune responses. Novel host-directed therapeutic strategies target host surface receptors, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; involved in immune exhaustion) and sialic acid-containing receptor (SAR; enhances entry of pathogens into host cells). Histone modifi cation is done by targeting genes involved in pathogen replication and induction of apoptosis, autophagy, and antigen processing and presentation. Fatty-acid metabolism might have a role in maintenance of memory CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte pools in the host. Responses induced by host-directed therapies might counteract microbial virulence factors (dotted blockade), in addition to neutralising tissue damage. 31 suggesting a host-directed eff ect. Analyses in patients with com munity-acquired pneumonia with bacteraemia of all causes 32 or community-acquired pneumonia with severe sepsis 24 showed that benefi t specifi c to macrolides was not only restricted to pneumococcal bacteraemia but was also shown for Gram-negative bacterial infections. 24, 32 Findings suggest that macrolides provide benefi t mainly to patients with more severe illness. 4, 22, 24, 26, 27 The use of non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of pneumonia in people has yielded confl icting results. 5,6 A study investigating the Review eff ects of ibuprofen in patients with sepsis (50% had pneumonia) showed some improvement in gas exchange, 7 albeit without any eff ect on mortality. 139 Statins (3-hydroxyl-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors) might have a role as adjunct treatment of community-acquired pneumonia via their pleiotropic antiinfl ammatory, anti-oxidative, and immuno modulatory eff ects; however, their eff ects need to be defi ned in randomised controlled trials. Observational studies of patients on statins before development of pneumonia or other infection were less likely to develop sepsis, die from sepsis, or have complications leading to intensive care unit admission. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] No study has examined the addition of statins as an adjunctive therapy once pneumonia has developed.\n\nOral hypoglycaemic agents, such as glitazones, may have anti-infl ammatory eff ects similar to corticosteroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and glyburide has been associated with signifi cantly lower mortality in patients with severe melioidosis than in patients without diabetes or patients taking other diabetes agents. 140 These fi ndings warrant clinical investigation to establish whether oral hypoglycaemic agents are potential host-directed therapies for severe com munity-acquired pneumonia.\n\nHelicobacter pylori has emerged as a major human pathogen because of its role in gastric cancer (classifi ed as a type 1 carcinogen) 141 and gastric ulcers. More than 50% of the world's population is infected with the pathogen, which has co-evolved with human beings for almost 60 000 years. 142 Raised concentrations of interleukin 1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 in the gut of individuals with H pylori infection have been postulated as risk factors for infl ammatory tissue transformation and damage, and carcinogenesis. 33 Eff orts to develop host-directed therapies against H pylori infection have focused on neutralisation of these proinfl ammatory cytokines with mono clonal antibodies (eg, anti-interleukin 1\u03b2, gevokizumab, anti-TNF\u03b1, and adalimumab) during the course of antibiotic treatment to clear the infection. 33 Vitamin D3 also has potential for use as a host-directed therapy for H pylori infection. In a preclinical study 34 with a gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1) infected with H pylori, vitamin D3 supplement augmented killing of intracellular bacteria via induction of cathelicidin and \u03b2-defensin 4.\n\nBordetella pertussis remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Antibiotics do not substantially aff ect the course of whooping cough disease unless treatment is started early after symptom onset. Many patients develop long-term pulmonary damage. Immunotherapy with antipertussis toxin antibodies might confer protection against more severe forms of whooping cough. Halperin and colleagues 36 investigated the use of multiple doses of intravenous antipertussis immunoglobulin in 25 infants with pertussis infection and noted an increase in serum antipertussis antibody titres, a decline in lymphocytosis, and a reduction in paroxysmal coughing compared with baseline; however, fi ndings from more recent studies 37 of antipertussis immunoglobulin were not promising. Manipulation of the sphingosine-1-phosphate signalling pathway, involved in several immunological processes including lymphocyte traffi cking, might have therapeutic benefi ts in reversing the pathological outcome in pertussis disease (appendix). 35 The number of infections with antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae is increasing worldwide. The histone deacetylase inhibitor sulforaphane, which induces expression of antimicrobial peptides (eg, secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor and \u03b2-defensin 2), has been shown to augment the activity of antibiotics against multidrug-resistant N gonorrhoeae, thus showing potential as a host-directed therapy. 39, 40 Supernatants from human endocervical carcinoma cells pre-treated with sulforaphane potentiated better bacterial killing in combination with sublethal doses of ciprofl oxacin and cefi xime 40 compared with antibiotics alone. 39 Furthermore, sulforaphane treatment in N gonorrhoeae-infected female mice resulted in better control of bacterial load and reduced infl ammation. 39 Treatment of cervical cells with sulforaphane in combination with antibiotic therapy might reduce the amount of antibiotic needed to eradicate N gonorrhoeae. 40 See appendix for discussion of host-directed therapies for bacterial sepsis.\n\nHIV targets and infects human CCR5-positive T cells 143 and causes AIDS, impeding CD4 T-cell-mediated responses to a wide range of microbes. 144 In 2014,\n\nPharmacological activation of autophagy or apoptosis, or both, drives improved intracellular killing of pathogens and enhanced antigen presentation. Activation and recruitment of antigen-presenting cells (ie, dendritic cells and macrophages) via therapy with the pro-infl ammatory cytokines interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and IFN\u03b3-induced protein (IP-10), among others, could amplify the antimicrobial immune response. Several anticancer drugs (ie, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel) can potentiate antigen-specifi c CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses in patients by inducing production of interleukin (IL) 12, tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), and IL 6. Immune checkpoint inhibition by blocking the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway activates antigen-specifi c T cells. In-vitro selection and expansion of pathogen-specifi c autologous T-cell subsets (antigen-specifi c CD4 T cells and CD8 CTLs) can allow for reinfusion into the patient after confi rmation of activity. Blockade of cell surface-bound signalling molecules, such as the receptors for IL 6 and neuropilin 1 (NRP-1), may potentiate specifi c T-cell responses. Removal of excess infl ammatory cytokines by use of monoclonal antibodies, or depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) with cytotoxic agents (eg, cyclophosphamide and etoposide) dampens destructive infl ammation in the target organs, and might re-orientate Mycobacterium tuberculosis-targeted immune responses (T-helper-1 [Th1] and CD8 CTLs). Histone deacetylase inhibitors, valproic acid, and vorinostat, might reprogramme non-productive Th2 cells to antigen-specifi c Th1 cells. Infusion of autologous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) could neutralise the local cytokine milieu, promote tissue repair, and orchestrate antigen-specifi c T-cell responses, in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Host-cell surface receptors used by pathogens for entry could be targeted by host-directed therapies. AMP=antimicrobial peptide. BCR=B-cell receptor. M-CSF=macrophage colony-stimulating factor. PGE2=prostaglandin E2. TCR=T-cell receptor. TGF=transforming growth factor. TGF\u03b2=TGF \u03b2. VD3=vitamin D3. VEGF=vascular endothelial growth factor.\n\nMechanism of action Developmental stage\n\nRepurposed drug* Imatinib, verapamil, metformin, ibuprofen 148 The encouraging results of early-phase clinical trials of histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment of latent HIV infection could revolutionise ART. 148 Since PD-1 expression on HIV-specifi c CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes is a barrier to eff ective antiviral immune responses in patients with AIDS, 44 timely blockade of the PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway could be a viable option to pursue. 45 In-vitro blockade of PD-L1 has already been shown to improve anti-HIV CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses, marked by increased proliferation and production of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules. 149 Faster recovery of immune competence in lymphopenic hosts has been seen in HIV-positive patients after treatment with recombinant interleukin 7. 150 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus, which is ubiquitous and remains largely latent in nature; at least 95% of the world's population is infected with the virus. EBV has tropism for B cells. It causes a wide range of clinical syndromes, from self-limited infectious mononucleosis to lymphoproliferative syndromes and B-cell lymphomas. Chimeric antigen receptors designed against the B-cell surface antigen CD19 are currently approved for eliminating latent viral reservoirs in the patient to decrease chances of developing B-cell lymphomas. 48 This approach is also feasible for patients with EBV-associated B-cell lymphoma. Alternatively, transfer of EBV-specifi c CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes initially isolated from patients, and cultured and expanded ex vivo, has been clinically tested with much success. 49, 50 Not only CD8, but also CD4 T-cell responses have been shown to mediate control of EBV-infected cells. Interleukin 21, produced by CD4 T cells, has been shown to be involved in the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2)-independent expression of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) in EBV-carrying type 2 cells. 151 Cytomegalovirus is another ubiquitous human herpesvirus that infects the lungs, eyes, CNS, and gastrointestinal tract, but can cause serious disease in adults and children. In particular, patients who have recently undergone haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) are at increased risk of developing clinical cytomegalovirus disease 53 associated with the cytomegalovirus status of the donor and the recipient of of HSCT. Immune control is largely attributed to antigenspecifi c CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes, although cell activation is noticeably subdued after HSCT as a result of immunosuppressive therapy. 53 For host-directed therapies, transfer of autologous or allogeneic antigenspecifi c CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes has been investigated, mainly in HSCT settings. 49, 50 The timing of this strategy is crucial to avoid cytomegalovirusassociated immune reconstitution infl ammatory syndrome.\n\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) causes at least 3% of liver diseases worldwide, and is the leading cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 152 Acute and chronic stages of HCV infection of the liver promote T-cell exhaustion, which, as in HIV infection, is characterised by PD-1 expression on virus-specifi c CD4 and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 153 Another immune checkpoint, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), is also expressed on exhausted T cells and reduces the immune reactivity of anti-HCV eff ector T cells to virus-infected Cytokine therapy 85, 86 Interferon \u03b3, interleukin 2, TNF\u03b1 (early stage)\n\nMonoclonal antibody 85, 86 Anti-TNF\u03b1 (late stage) Cytokine neutralisation to reduce tissue-destructive infl ammation Not yet tested in trypanosomiasis Recombinant protein or cytokine therapy 85, 86 Interferon-\u03b3-induced apolipoprotein 1 Cytokine-induced protein that can directly engage and kill trypanosomes Preclinical Cellular therapy 85, 86 MSCs (late stage) Neutralisation of tissue-destructive infl ammation and enhancement of organ repair Not yet tested in trypanosomiasis Schistosomiasis Cytokine therapy 87 Interleukin 2, interferon \u03b3 (early stage) Induction of pro-infl ammatory immune responses and intracellular antimicrobial activity Not yet tested in schistosomiasis Review tissue in patients. 154 The current fi rst-line treatment for HCV infection is a combination regimen of direct-acting antiviral drugs, which mandatorily includes the nucleotide analogue sofosbuvir. 155 Despite their high effi cacy, the high fi nancial cost of direct-acting antiviral drugs is a barrier to provision of HCV treatment. The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab has been shown to induce productive clinical responses in patients with HCV infection, marked by pronounced viral load reduction. 60 \n\nIpilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) 118 Review mellitus and was receiving metformin treatment, had an increase in blood glucose concentrations, requiring insulin therapy. Anti-PD-1 therapy has been used for treatment of melanoma and other solid cancers, 156 including HCV-induced hepato cellular carcinoma in combination with anti-CTLA-4 (NCT01658878). HCVinfected hepatocytes secrete newly formed viruses bound to apolipoprotein B (apoB), 157 thus making increased apoB expression a risk factor for infection and progression to active hepatitis, and a potential target for host-directed therapy. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is highly expressed in the liver and has an important role in fatty-acid metabolism. Notably, increased levels of circulating miR-122 in serum samples from patients with HCV infection (genotypes 1 and 3) qualifi es it as a disease biomarker and target for host-directed therapy. 56 A phase 2 clinical trial of miravirsen (SPC3649; Santaris Pharma, H\u00f8rsholm Municipality, Denmark), an antisense oligonucleotide targeting miR-122, in patients with chronic HCV infection, has recently been completed (NCT01200420), and previous preclinical assessment showed promising antiviral eff ects. 57 Infl uenza virus has caused several pandemics with millions of deaths worldwide. Many patients with infl uenza succumb to extensive lung pathology or secondary bacterial pneumonia, and resistance to current neuraminidase inhibitors presents a major hurdle to management of future pandemics. Immunosuppressive treatment with etoposide to dampen the cytokine storminduced lung pathology was clinically benefi cial in patients with severe infl uenza infection. 108,109 DAS181 (fl udase; Ansun Biopharma, San Diego, CA, USA) is a sialidase fusion peptide that cleaves off the sialic acid residues on host epithelial cell-surface receptors. Following approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), DAS181 has been used in two HSCT recipients with parainfl uenza infection; the fi rst patient died whereas the second recovered. 66 Clinical benefi t and reduction of viral load has been reported from a phase 2 clinical trial of DAS181 in patients with pneumonia caused by either infl uenza B or the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain. 67 Several immuno modulatory drugs, 62,63 statins, 62 angiotensin-II-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and PPAR\u03b1 agonists (glitazones and fi brates, respectively), and adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase agonists (eg, metformin) have been suggested to modify the host response to severe infl uenza to improve survival, 62 since these interventions have been shown to reduce mortality in mice infected with infl uenza virus. In an observational study of more than 3000 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confi rmed infl uenza, statins reduced the number of deaths in hospital and within 30 days of discharge by 41%. 64 An observational study showed that inpatient treatment with angiotensin-II-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins reduced 30-day pneumonia mortality by 53%, 42%, and 32%, respectively. 158 In the 2014-15 epidemic of Ebola virus disease, this disease caused more than 28 639 cases and 11 316 deaths in three west African countries. 159 Clinical trials of experimental antiviral agents, antibody preparations, and vaccines were completed. The clinical success of treating patients with Ebola virus infection with convalescent plasma from individuals who survived the 1976 and 1995 disease outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo prompted use of this strategy in the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa. 160 Although this intervention provided some survival benefi t, acute kidney or lung injury were reported; however, these adverse eff ects could not be directly attributed to convalescent plasma transfusion. 160 New treatment strategies targeting host factors in Ebola virus disease are in development. Recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2), an anticoagulant with FDA approval for treatment of thrombosis, has shown promising preclinical data in Ebola virus-infected monkeys, 72 although no clinical trials are currently listed. Endothelial dysfunction causes the fl uid and electrolyte imbalances seen in patients with Ebola virus infection; in-vitro studies have shown that statins and angiotensin-II-receptor blockers preserve or restore endothelial barrier integrity. 62, 68 These drugs could be considered for treating the host response in these patients. In Sierra Leone, about 100 patients with Ebola virus infection were treated with this combination, and reports suggest substantial extension of survival. 69 Dengue virus belongs to the genus of fl aviviruses, which also includes yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Zika virus; all are arthropod-transmitted infections. 161 Four diff erent serotypes of dengue virus exist, and infection with one serotype does not protect against the other. Dengue virus infection can lead to establishment of severe haemorrhagic disease, and in some cases leads to shock syndrome, which is fatal. 162 As a host-directed therapy, lovastatin, a known modulator of cholesterol metabolism, was shown to inhibit replication of dengue virus in A549 human epithelial cells. 73 Other repurposed drugs have also been clinically tested: ivermectin, dasatinib, and ciclosporin. 73 Additionally, use of type 1 interferon (\u03b1 or \u03b2) and interferon \u03b3 has shown promising results in animal models (non-human primates). 75 rNAPc2 could also be useful in managing vasculopathy during dengue haemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome, but this approach requires clinical investigation.\n\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was fi rst isolated in June, 2012, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from a patient who died of severe respiratory infection and multiorgan failure. 78 MERS-CoV is associated with high mortality in patents with comorbidities and there are no eff ective anti-MERS-CoV antiviral agents or therapeutics. The lung pathology seen Review in patients with MERS probably represents the end result of a fi ne balance of host immune and MERS-CoV interactions. In-vitro laboratory investigation identifi ed the membrane-bound form of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 to be the cardinal host-cell receptor for virus entry. 76 Pneumonia is a common feature in patients with MERS and the high mortality caused by MERS-CoV is attributable to acute lung injury or development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is associated with leaky alveolar-capillary interfaces with pulmonary oedema, hypoxia, poly morphonuclear leucocytes or lymphocytic cellular infi ltrates, and an aberrant immune response, with upregulation of proinfl ammatory cytokines, including interferon \u03b3, which results in further tissue damage and deterioration of lung function. Analysis of serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid samples from patients who died from MERS-CoV infection showed non-productive infl ammatory immune responses and induction of interleukin 6 and interleukin 17A. 76 Patients with acute lung injury or ARDS died from the disease. Blockade of the proinfl ammatory cytokines interleukin 17A and interleukin 6 during severe disease might be useful as adjunct therapy and needs to be assessed in clinical trials. Additionally, reinfusion of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells might also help ameliorate lung pathology in critically ill patients. 78 Potential host-directed therapies to improve treatment outcomes of MERS are shown in table 1.\n\nPlasmodium falciparum malaria kills up to 1 million people worldwide every year. Individuals with P falciparum infection often develop severe clinical symptoms such as brain damage and multiple organ failure. Up to 25% of cases of severe clinical malaria are fatal even with access to the best health care, partly because the parasite triggers infl ammation that damages vital organs. Case fatality rates for severe malaria remain high even in the best clinical settings because antimalarial drugs act against the parasite without alleviating life-threatening infl ammation. 163 Drug resistance now threatens effi cacy of artemisinin-based therapies. 164 Ferrochelatase, an enzyme important for haem biosynthesis in human erythrocytes, has been reported to be instrumental in parasite survival. Human erythrocytes defi cient for ferrochelatase (from patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria) are more resistant to P falciparum growth, and pharmacological inhibition of host ferrochelatase in vitro abrogated parasite replication in healthy human erythrocytes. 79 Desferrioxamine is a potent inhibitor of ferrochetalase, 165 and could be considered for repurposing in human malaria.\n\nExcess TNF\u03b1 production is involved in the pathogenesis of severe malaria. 166 In a clinical study that included 20 Gambian children in malaria-associated coma, treatment with an anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody reduced parasite load in a dose-dependent manner and had noteworthy anti pyrogenic eff ects. 167 The use of anti-TNF\u03b1 drugs (eg, adalimumab, etanercept) in severe malaria need to be further investigated in clincial trials.\n\nA small synthetic peptide known as innate defence regulator (IDR)-1018 seems to have broad therapeutic potential, including in-vivo activity in murine models by enhancement of wound healing and protection against Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant M tuberculosis, herpes simplex virus, and infl ammatory disorders, including cerebral malaria. 80 Recent studies of the Plasmodium berghei ANKA model of experimental cerebral malaria showed that IDR peptides prevented CNS infl ammation and protected mice from experimental cerebral malaria, improving survival. 81 IDR peptides enhance the benefi cial aspects of the initial immune response, while dampening harmful tissue damage by downregulating the secretion of pro-infl ammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1 and interleukin 1\u03b2. Coadministration of IDR-1018 with standard fi rst-line antimalarial drugs (pyrimethamine and chloroquine) increased survival in infected mice. Thus, IDR peptides could serve as adjunctive host-directed therapy for severe disease in combination with antimalarial treatment. 80, 81 Leishmania spp cause a range of clinical disease including cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral involvement. 168 Like most intracellular pathogens, Leishmania spp parasites are diffi cult to kill because their localisation protects against immune responses and chemotherapy. Drug treatments have limited effi cacy, have to be used for lengthy periods of time, and the systemic side-eff ects sometimes outweigh any clinical benefi ts. Thus, successful treatment of diseases caused by intracellular pathogens might need combination therapies and eff ective delivery systems. Imiquimod and resiquimod are currently used for treatment of leishmaniasis; both trigger Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7-mediated innate immune responses, inducing production of interleukin 6, type 1 interferons, and TNF\u03b1, 82 and thus act in a host-directed manner. Overproduction of TNF\u03b1 in Leishmania braziliensis infection contributes to mucosal tissue damage, consequently leading to development of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. 84 In this case, a com bination of antileishmanial drugs and anti-TNF\u03b1 (adalimumab) during active L braziliensis infection might yield a clinical response. In preclinical studies, delivery of nanocapsulated doxorubicin (in a formulation that included chondroitin sulfate) to hamsters increased killing of leishmanial promastigotes via augmentation of Th1-mediated immune responses via induction of interferon \u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and interleukin 2 release in addition to direct antiparasitic activity. 83 Sequential chemoimmunotherapy, with a single low dose of liposomal amphotericin B and a novel T-cell-epitope-enriched DNA vaccine candidate (LEISHDNAVAX; Mologen AG, Germany) was tested as host-directed therapy. The vaccine candidate boosted the effi cacy of a single suboptimal dose of liposomal amphotericin B in C57BL/6 mice. 169 Polyhexanide is a cationic polymer, which is able to directly www.thelancet.com/infection Vol 16 April 2016 e59 Review kill Leishmania major and to enhance host-directed killing by improving the delivery of immunomodulatory nucleic acids. Polyhexanide spontaneously binds CpG ODN (short synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides comprising cytosine triphosphate [C] and guanine triphosphate [G] residues in sequential order), forming stable nano polyplexes that enhanced uptake of CpG ODN, potentiated antimicrobial killing, and reduced host-cell toxicity of polyhexanide. 170 These fi ndings warrant further investigation.\n\nTrypanosoma spp cause human trypanosomiasis, two important vector-borne diseases: human African trypanosomiasis (also known as sleeping sickness; caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T brucei rhodesiense) and Chagas disease (caused by Trypanosoma cruzi). 171 Severe pathology in patients with human African trypanosomiasis can lead to fatal meningoencephalopathy and in many cases coma. 172 In Chagas disease, patients are prone to infectious myocarditis or meningoencephalitis, or both, which are often life-threatening, and progressive damage of the autonomic nervous system occurs with organ enlarge ment and failure. 171 In mouse models of T brucei infections, equilibrium between early onset of Th1 responses (interferon \u03b3, TNF\u03b1) and late Th2 responses (interleukin 4, interleukin 10) can control parasitaemia and associated pathology. 85 Additionally, interferon-\u03b3-driven nitric oxide, MHC-I antigen processing and presentation, and CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation have a role in eliminating parasite reservoirs in macrophages. 85 In human beings, cytokine analysis of cerebrospinal fl uid specimens showed that patients with late-stage human African trypanosomiasis have raised levels of pro-infl ammatory cytokines, including TNF\u03b1, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1; also known as CCL2), and macrophage infl ammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1, among others. 85 This destructive infl ammation might be amenable to cellular therapy in late-stage human African trypanosomiasis, whereas immunostimulatory treatment with vitamin D3, interferon \u03b3, and interleukin 2 could be useful at early stages. Interferon-\u03b3-induced apolipo protein 1 is a known host factor with antitrypanosomal activity. Thus, activating the immune system at an early stage with interferon \u03b3 could help control burden of parasitaemia via diff erent eff ector mechanisms. Since the immune response profi le in Chagas disease is similar to that in human African trypanosomiasis, 171 host-directed therapies relevant to human African trypanosomiasis might also benefi t patients with T cruzi infection, in addition to antiparasitic therapy.\n\nSchistosomiasis aff ects more than 250 million people in 78 countries, 173 and is caused by the trematode parasites of the genus Schistosoma. Major clinical manifestations arise from pathology due to granulomatous reaction around the ova in all major organs of the body, especially the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts. 173 The antischistosomal immune response milieu mainly consists of Th1 cytokines (interferon \u03b3, TNF\u03b1, interleukin 12p40) and interleukin 17. Interleukin 6 and interleukin 1\u03b2 also seem to have an important role early after infection with Schistosoma spp cercariae. 87 In interleukin-10-defi cient mice repeatedly infected with Schistosoma mansoni, CD4 T-cell activity was more pronounced, targeted, and effi cient, upon exposure to schistosoma antigen preparation. 174 This fi nding, if extrapolated to human beings, would suggest that multiple exposures to S mansoni might reduce T-cell responsiveness in an interleukin-10-dependent manner and hence, weaken productive cellular immune responses. Use of interleukin 2 and interferon \u03b3 might help to recover T-cell responses in patients in endemic countries. Notably, the use of Th2 cytokines such as interleukin 25 and interleukin 33 in a mixture with schistosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and peroxiredoxin in a post-exposure vaccination attempt resulted in immense reduction of migrating cercariae in S mansoni-infected mice. 88\n\nHost-directed therapies targeting host immune and infl ammatory pathways to enhance immune responses and alleviate immunopathology could benefi t treatment outcomes in a range of bacterial, viral, and parasitic diseases. The variability in the potential of adjunct hostdirected therapies to deliver clinically meaningful benefi t for each pathogen demands defi nition. This defi nition will in part depend on how eff ective the standard antimicrobial therapy is, and whether tissue damage or other events represent therapeutic targets that otherwise are not addressed by conventional treatment. The focus on host-directed therapeutic strategies across various infectious diseases will require more investment for multidisciplinary research col laborations between academic and industrial partners to develop and take forward the assessment of hostdirected therapies.\n\nWe searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Google Scholar for articles published in English between Nov 15, 2000, and Jan 15, 2016, with the terms \"infectious diseases\", \"parasitic diseases\" and combined with the terms \"host\", \"host-directed therapy\", \"host-directed treatment\", \"adjunct therapy\", \"adjunct treatment\", \"immunotherapy\", \"cellular therapy\", \"repurposed drugs\", \"therapeutic advances\", \"treatment\", \"treatment regimens\", \"trials\", \"clinical trials\", and \"animal models\".
