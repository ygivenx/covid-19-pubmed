{"title": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus nonstructural protein 2 contributes to NF-\u03baB activation", "body": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows, and respiratory distress in piglets and growing pigs, and continues to be the most economically significant disease in the swine industry [1,2]. The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is an enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA virus containing a genome of approximately 15 kb [3]. The 5\u2019 two-thirds of the viral genome is occupied by overlapping open reading frames 1a (ORF1a) and 1b, which encode nonstructural polyproteins (Nsp), pp1a and pp1ab, respectively [4,5]. These polyproteins are proteolytically processed into 14 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1\u03b1, Nsp1\u03b2, and Nsp2 to 12) [6-8]. In 2006, an atypical PRRS outbreak in China was caused by an emerging highly-pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strain with a discontinuous deletion of 30-amino acid in the Nsp2 coding region in comparison with classical PRRSV strains [9,10]. Since then, the HP-PRRSV strain, which caused a more severe pneumonia and higher mortality than the classical PRRSV, has become the dominant strain found in China [11,12]. The immense genetic variability in the coding region of Nsp2 suggests that Nsp2 may play a limited role in viral replication but likely to play a very important part in modulating virus pathogenesis and the inflammation response in pigs during infection [13-16].\n\nNF-\u03baB is a family of inducible transcription factors involving pathogen- or cytokine-induced immune and inflammatory responses, as well as cell proliferation and survival [17-20]. The members of the NF-\u03baB family in mammalian cells include p50/p105 (NF\u03baB1), p65 (RelA), p52/p100 (NF\u03baB2), c-Rel, and RelB. All of these proteins share a conserved 300-amino acid region known as the Rel homology domain that is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. In most cells, Rel family members form hetero- and homodimers with distinct specificities in various combinations [21,22]. Classical NF-\u03baB exists as heterodimers consisting of a 50-kDa subunit (p50) and a 65-kDa subunit (p65) [23]. Under normal physiological conditions, NF-\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes by its interaction with a member of the inhibitory kappa B (I\u03baB) family. When stimulated with a wide range of proinflammatory stimuli, the I\u03baB proteins are phosphorylated by I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and degraded in proteasomes [24]. The subunit of NF-\u03baB p65 is then phosphorylated while exposing its nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS), leading to nuclear translocation and subsequent binding of NF-\u03baB to DNA regulatory elements of the target genes involved in various biological functions [6,21-23,25].\n\nMany viruses encode proteins that activate or modulate NF-\u03baB signalling pathways for their own advantage [26]. For example, UL37 tegument protein, encoded by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) interacts with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), resulting in the NF-\u03baB activation [27]. Similarly, NF-\u03baB activation induced by Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein and Epstein\u2013Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is important for infected cell survival and persistent viral infection [28,29]. Previous studies of PRRSV have demonstrated that the nucleocapsid (N) protein was a NF-\u03baB activator [30-32]; however, it remains unclear whether the PRRSV Nsps contribute to NF-\u03baB activation. The current study demonstrated that PRRSV Nsp2 alone could activate the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway and the potential molecular mechanism(s) for NF-\u03baB activation were also investigated.\n\nTo identify the specific PRRSV Nsp(s) involved in NF-\u03baB activation, all non-structural genes of PRRSV strain WUH3 [33] were screened for their capacities to activate NF-\u03baB using a luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Figure 1A, overexpression of Nsp2 in HeLa cells potently induced NF-\u03baB activation, while this activation was not observed in cells overexpressing other viral nonstructural proteins. To further confirm the effect of Nsp2 on NF-\u03baB, HeLa cells were transfected with increasing amounts of Nsp2 expression plasmid and NF-\u03baB luciferase activity was monitored at 36 h post-transfection. As shown in Figure 1B, a dose-dependent increase in luciferase reporter activity was observed. These data clearly indicated that Nsp2 was responsible for the induction of NF-\u03baB activation among PRRSV nonstructural proteins. Similar results were obtained using MARC-145 cells overexpressing Nsp2 (data not shown).\n\nActivation of NF-\u03baB is usually characterized by degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 after phosphorylation by IKK in response to many extracellular stimuli, which is followed by the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB subunit p65 (RelA) and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB [19,22]. To investigate the potential mechanism(s) of NF-\u03baB activation by Nsp2, we first examined the I\u03baB\u03b1 expression level in the cytoplasmic extracts using a western blot assay. As shown in Figure 2A, the I\u03baB\u03b1 protein degraded in a dose-dependent manner in Nsp2-transfected cells. To further characterize the mechanism, the phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit, as well as the total p65 in Nsp2 expression cells were determined. As shown in Figure 2A, the amount of phosphorylated p65 and nuclear p65 protein increased in a dose-dependent manner, while the amount of total p65 was unaltered. To further validate NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation after Nsp2 overexpression, HeLa cells co-transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-p65 and red fluorescent protein (RFP)-Nsp2 fusion expression constructs were used to monitor the translocation of p65 by confocal fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Figure 2B, the p65 protein accumulated in the nucleus when co-expressed with Nsp2, while it was retained in the cytoplasm when co-expressed with the empty vector or expressed alone.\n\nOverall, these results clearly demonstrated that Nsp2 induced NF-\u03baB activation characterized by I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and p65 nuclear translocation, which is consistent with a recent publication showing that PRRSV infection modulates NF-\u03baB activation through I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in vitro[31]. The observation that Nsp2 induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation raised the possibility that Nsp2 may have affected upstream processing for I\u03baB phosphorylation from which the dissociation of the NF-\u03baB-I\u03baB complex and subsequent p65 nuclear translocation was dependent.\n\nNF-\u03baB is a critical transcription factor regulating the transcription and expression of many pro-inflammatory molecules, including certain adhesion molecules (ICAM-1), critical enzymes (for example, COX-2), most cytokines (for example, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1), and chemokines (for example, IL-8 and RANTES) [19,34]. Previous studies have shown that PRRSV infection can induce several cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, RANTES, and TNF-\u03b1, in porcine macrophages involved in the pulmonary inflammatory response [34,35]. To further investigate the possible biological impact of Nsp2 on pro-inflammatory molecules, a promoter luciferase reporter assay was used to determine if Nsp2 enhanced NF-\u03baB-regulated target gene expression, including IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES. As shown in Figure 3A, overexpression of Nsp2 enhanced the promoter activities of IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES to varying degrees. To further confirm these results, the mRNA expression of these cytokines was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). As shown in Figure 3B, gene expression data were consistent with the promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay. Interestingly, as a result of treatment with the NF-\u03baB inhibitor, BAY-117082, Nsp2 exhibited reduced ability to upregulate IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES expression in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). These observations suggest that Nsp2 stimulated cytokine expression via the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway.\n\nCompared with the classical PRRSV strains, animals infected with HP-PRRSV typically show a more severe pneumonia. It is well known that NF-\u03baB is an important transcription factor for mediating virus-induced inflammatory responses, such as severe lung inflammation and diseases [19,36]. Thus, we assessed the ability of Nsp2 from different PRRSV strains to activate NF-\u03baB using a luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Figure 4A, Nsp2 of HP-PRRSV strains (WUH3 and 07HBEZ) could induce a higher level of NF-\u03baB compared with that of the classical PRRSV strain CH-1a (P < 0.01).\n\nAmino acid sequence alignment revealed that the Nsp2 of WUH3 and 07HBEZ possessed the same 30 amino acid discontinuous deletion [37]. Thus, we investigated whether these deletions have any effect on NF-\u03baB activation. To test this hypothesis, we constructed several insertion mutants in Nsp2 expression plasmids based on the Nsp2 of PRRSV strain WUH3, which were denoted as Nsp2(+1), Nsp2(+29), and Nsp2(+1/+29). These mutants were then analysed for their capacities of stimulating NF-\u03baB in HeLa cells. These assays showed that NF-\u03baB activation by these Nsp2 insertion mutants was equivalent to that of the wild-type Nsp2 (Figure 4B) (P > 0.05). Additionally, insertions within this region did not result in the loss of the ability to activate NF-\u03baB, suggesting that the 30 amino acids discontinuous deletion in the Nsp2 coding region is not related to NF-\u03baB activation.\n\nTaken together, the variable effect on Nsp2-induced NF-\u03baB activation might be a factor contributing to the different levels of viral pathogenesis between different PRRSV strains. However, the underlying mechanism may be due to the different capacities of replication or the alternative strategies in NF-\u03baB activation by different PRRSV strains. Using a series of chimeric viruses where the deletion region was substituted with corresponding regions of low virulence strains, Zhou et al. elucidated that the 30-aa deletion was not the primary determinant of virulence of HP-PRRSV. These findings are consistent with those in the current study that found there was no direct association between NF-\u03baB activation and the 30-aa deletion in Nsp2. In addition, our investigation showed that Nsp2 specifically localized to the mitochondria (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that the mitochondria played an important role in the activation of NF-\u03baB and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3 mediated by mitochondrial antiviral signalling (MAVS) in response to viral infection [38]. Whether the localization of Nsp2 in the mitochondria is essential for its capacity for NF-\u03baB activation requires further investigation.\n\nSince the 30-aa deletion in Nsp2 is not associated with its ability to activate NF-\u03baB, we attempted to further map the domain responsible for in NF-\u03baB activation. To this end, six truncated mutants of Nsp2 were constructed (Figure 5A) and a NF-\u03baB reporter assay was performed to determine the functional region responsible for NF-\u03baB activation. As shown in Figure 5B, several mutants, including the HV (hypervariable region), \u2206PL2 (the putative enzyme domain truncated mutant), \u2206TM (the transmembrane region truncated mutant), which all contain the HV domain, showed a significant increase in NF-\u03baB luciferase activity. However, luciferase activity was significantly reduced in other mutants that did not contain these regions compared with wild-type Nsp2 (P < 0.01). This suggested that the functional domain responsible for NF-\u03baB activation might be located in the middle HV of Nsp2.\n\nPrevious studies performed by Sun and co-workers [39] showed that the PRRSV Nsp2 OTU domain inhibited NF-\u03baB activation by interfering with the polyubiquitination process of I\u03baB\u03b1. These findings are consistent with our result that show the PL2 domain of PRRSV Nsp2 failed to activate NF-\u03baB when expressed independently; however, the HV region of Nsp2 could activate NF-\u03baB to similar levels as the full-length of Nsp2. This suggested that PRRSV Nsp2 is a multi-functional replicase subunit with different domains involved in different functions in viral replication and pathogenesis. In addition, the activation of NF-\u03baB has been previously described in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages [31,32]. However, recent studies have reported that several PRRSV Nsps, including Nsp1\u03b1, Nsp1\u03b2, Nsp11, could function as negative regulators of NF-\u03baB to escape the host innate immune response [14,40]. Furthermore, studies from our laboratory showed that the N protein of PRRSV could induce NF-\u03baB activation [41]. Taken together, these studies suggest that PRRSV might have developed sophisticated strategies for either activation or inhibition of NF-\u03baB pathway to survive in host cells. Further investigation is required to evaluate the exact mechanisms involved in PRRSV-induced modulation of the NF-\u03baB pathway.\n\nIn summary, our data clearly demonstrated that the PRRSV Nsp2 alone, in the absence of other PRRSV proteins, could significantly activate the NF-\u03baB pathway. Overexpression of PRRSV Nsp2 induced the NF-\u03baB-dependent pro-inflammatory molecules, IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES. The 30-aa deletion in the Nsp2 of HP-PPRSV was not associated with NF-\u03baB activation; however, the hypervariable region of Nsp2 was essential for NF-\u03baB activation. This study not only helps clarify the molecular mechanisms of NF-\u03baB activation during PRRSV infection but also helps explain the ability of PRRSV Nsp2 to modulate the inflammatory response by regulating the NF-\u03baB pathway. Understanding the relationships between PRRSV Nsp2 and the host inflammatory responses should help develop more effective strategies for the control of PRRS.\n\nHeLa and MARC-145 cells were cultured and maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 10 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin sulfate and then incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. HP-PRRSV strain WUH3 (GenBank Accession No.: HM853673.2), a virulent strain, was isolated from the brain of a pig with the \u201chigh fever\u201d syndrome in China at the end of 2006 and identified as a highly pathogenic North American type PRRSV [33]. PRRSV strain CH-1a (GenBank Accession No.: AY032626), the first field isolate in China, was kindly provided by Dr. Guangzhi Tong (Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute, Shanghai, China) [42]. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-HA was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Polyclonal antibodies (pAb), anti-\u03b2-actin, p65, p-p65, I\u03baB\u03b1, were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology (Jiangsu, China).\n\nPlasmids were constructed by standard methods. Expression plasmids of PRRSV nonstructural proteins used in this report were constructed by RT-PCR amplification from the genomic RNA of PRRSV strain WUH3. Mutagenesis of 1 or/and 29 amino acids in Nsp2 was performed using the Overlap Extension Polymerase Chain Reaction. Six truncated mutants of Nsp2 were generated by PCR from WUH3 cDNA. All PCR amplification reactions were performed by PrimerSTAR\u2122 HS DNA Polymerase system (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China). The details of the specific primers used in PCR steps are available on request.\n\nGene fragments were cloned into the pCAGGS-HA vector in-frame that was constructed using the pCAGGS vector (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) to generate a series of PRRSV nonstructural protein constructs and Nsp2 mutants for expression in mammalian cells. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing and the expressions of the interested protein were verified by western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody (data not shown). The expression plasmid of Nsp2 of PRRSV 07HBEZ strain (GenBank Accession No.: FJ495082.2 and HM595639) was kindly provided by Dr H. X. Li [43]. Full-length Nsp2 of CH-1a strain was amplified from the cDNA of CH-1a. The luciferase reporter plasmid pNF-\u03baB-Luc contains four repeats of \u03baB binding motifs followed by the luciferase reporter gene (Luc) and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK were purchased from Stratagene. Other reporter plasmids, such as IL-6-Luc, IL-8-Luc, RANTES-Luc, and COX-2-Luc, were constructed as previously described [34,44]. The p65 gene was derived from human RelA cDNA and cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector. The DNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame (ORF) of Nsp2 was excised from pCAGGS-HA-Nsp2 and inserted into the pDsRed-C1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), resulting in the expression construct pDsRed-Nsp2.\n\nTransient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). HeLa or MARC-145 cells were seeded on 24-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at a density of 2\u20134 \u00d7 105 cells/well and cultured until the cells reached approximately 70\u201380% confluence, and were then transfected with the indicated plasmids. For each transfection, 0.2 \u03bcg of the reporter plasmid (NF-\u03baB, IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, RANTES-Luc) along with 0.05 \u03bcg of pRL-TK for normalization and 0.6 \u03bcg of various expression plasmids or empty control plasmid (pCAGGS-HA) were used. In addition to serving as a negative control, the empty vector was also used to adjust the total amount of transfected DNA to 1.05 \u03bcg in dose-dependent experiments. Cells treated with 20 ng/mL of TNF-\u03b1 (Sigma) for 6 h prior to harvest were used as a positive control. Cell extracts were collected at the indicated time points. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) in a MicroBeta TriLux liquid scintillation and a luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nCytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts from HeLa cells after transfection with Nsp2-expression plasmid were prepared with the Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent (100 mM HEPES [pH 8.0], 1% NP40, 15 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 2 mM Sucrose, 1% Cocktail) and Nuclear Extraction Reagent (200 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 15 mM MgCl2, 4.2 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Cocktail), respectively. Protein concentration was determined by Micro BCA Protein Assay (Thermo, Rockford, IL) with bovine serum albumin as a standard following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. The extracts were boiled in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) protein sample buffer (2% SDS, 60 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 6.8], 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromophenol blue, and 0.33% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol), then resolved by 10% acrylamide sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The separated proteins were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) dried skim milk in tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST). Western blotting was performed using a standard techniques, using anti-HA monoclonal antibody, anti-p65, p-p65, I\u03baB\u03b1 and \u03b2-actin polyclonal antibodies at a dilution of 1:1,000. Secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibody, were used at a dilution of 1:2,500, and protein bands were visualized using SuperSignal West Pio Luminol kit (Pierce).\n\nHeLa cells were seeded on microscope coverslips placed in 24-well plates at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 105 cells/well until the cells reached approximately 70\u201380% confluence. The pEGFP-p65 was co-transfected with pDsRed1-Nsp2, as well as the empty vector pDsRed-C1. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature (RT). After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with DAPI for 5 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, fluorescent images were performed using confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 Meta; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany).\n\nTo determine the effect of Nsp2 on IL-6, IL-8, COX-2 and RANTES, HeLa cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 1 \u03bcg of plasmid encoding Nsp2. The empty vector served as a negative control. Total RNA were extracted from the transfected cells 36 h post-transfection using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green Real Time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo Biologics, Osaka, Japan) with primer pairs described in Table 1 in the LightCycler 480 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Individual transcripts in each sample were assayed three times and normalized with human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA level as an endogenous control. Primers were designed using the Primer Express software (version 3.0; Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).\n\nAll experiments were performed at least three times with reproducible results.
