{"title": "Occupational Hazards in Nursing", "body": "\nDear editor,\n\n\nNurses continue to report high levels of job-related injury and illness. Working environment, responsibilities, and duties of nurses put them in the frontline of numerous occupational hazards. Some common occupational hazards that nurses might face are listed here:\n\nThese occupational hazards along with many other problems such as night shifts and sleep deprivation have changed nursing to a dangerous occupation that may explain the high rate of stopping the work in nursing. Some interventions including greater access to patient lifting and transfer devices and more use of safe needle devices can improve the situation. Every healthcare setting should address this important issue and give priority to the safety of nurses."}
