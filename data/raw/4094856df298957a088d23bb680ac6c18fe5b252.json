{"title": "Project Phoenix: A Benchmark for Reputation Management in Travel and Tourism", "body": "It struck suddenly. And it struck with devastating consequences. In 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -SARS, as it quickly became known -swept across the globe at frightening speed. Within weeks it spread from southern China, through parts of Asia, to North America and Europe, on a journey that was at first characterised by confusion and denial; subsequently fuelled by fear and sensationalism, finally to be stopped by decisive action and global co-operation.\n\nThe death toll, while severe at more than 900 fatalities (WHO, 2004 ; see also Chapter 4), was not large by comparison with other major disasters. The tsunami, which hit several Indian Ocean countries on Boxing Day 2004, claimed the lives of more than 170,000 people (WHO situational reports issued daily). However, the outbreak of SARS was indisputably the most damaging crisis in the relatively short history of international tourism.\n\nIn the crucial first 6 months of 2003, destinations in South East and North East Asia suffered a decline of close to 14 million visitor arrivals. Even after medical authorities had the disease in check, the fear of travel to affected destinations continued unabated, taking a heavy toll on the economies of the region, and particularly on the travel and tourism sector. By the end of 2003, international visitor arrivals to South East and North East Asia had fallen by more than 15 million, stripping US$11 billion from tourism receipts (PATA, 2004) .\n\nSome estimates put the global economic impact of SARS as high as US$30 billion (Roach, 2003) . Whichever way you look at it, SARS destroyed the lives and livelihoods of millions of people across the world.\n\nIn this Chapter, we review the impact of SARS on the travel and tourism industry and how one organisation, the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), responded to the crisis with a programme called Project Phoenix. In many ways, it was a first of its kind, and today stands as a benchmark in reputation management for the travel and tourism industry. We will also look at some of the larger issues which emerged as result of SARS, and some of the lessons learned.\n\nThe first few years of the new millennium were not kind to tourism. In 2001, an epidemic of Foot and Mouth disease ravaged much of the United Kingdom and Europe. In October 2002, a bomb blast tore through the heart of Bali, Indonesia's famed holiday island. And in March 2003, United States-led forces landed in Iraq, marking the start of a violent conflict which continues to this day. All three events, along with the increasing incidence of terrorist activity, hurt the tourism industry in various parts of the world as people chose not to stray too far from home. But nothing could prepare the industry for the turmoil that would be caused by SARS.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the outbreak may have started as early as November 2002 when a case of atypical pneumonia was reported in Foshan City in Guangdong Province in southern China (see the Appendix). However, it was not until February 2003 when the Chinese Ministry of Health advised WHO of an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome, with five deaths from 300 cases, that the world began to take notice.\n\nWithin weeks, similar cases of respiratory disease were being reported in Hong Kong, Hanoi, Singapore, Taipei and Toronto. On 15 March 2003, WHO named the mysterious illness SARS after its symptoms -Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -and declared it 'a worldwide health threat'.\n\nThe rapid spread of the disease and the lack of knowledge about its origins, its genetic code and its forms of transmission sparked a media frenzy of speculation and misinformation. This included alarmist reports of highly contagious 'super infectors' and even suggestions, although unsubstantiated, that international aircraft could be spreading the virus through their ventilation systems.\n\nNot surprisingly, travel into and within Asia virtually stopped overnight. It was as if the taps were turned off. Corporations banned staff travel. Conventions were cancelled. Leisure travellers stayed at home or went elsewhere. In many cases, airlines, hotels and tourist attractions lost more than 50 per cent of their business within a few days, and were down by as much as 80 per cent within weeks.\n\nThe impact was not restricted to those countries afflicted with SARS -it was felt across Asia Pacific, as nervous long haul travellers, particularly from the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States, chose to avoid travel to the whole region. In the April-June quarter of 2003, international visitor arrivals into Asia Pacific declined 34.6 per cent. In the July-September quarter, they fell a further 5.1 per cent (PATA, 2004) .\n\nOf course, in those destinations with SARS, the impact was even more dramatic. In Hong Kong, for example, hotel occupancy rates plummeted to just 12 per cent in May 2003, with Revenue per Available Room across the hotel sector falling to under US$10 per night (Deloitte & Touche, 2003) . In Taiwan, visitor arrivals for the 3 months of April, May and June were down by more than 70 per cent over 2002 (PATA, 2004) . Table 18 .1 shows the impact on international visitor arrivals.\n\nThe suddenness of the impact was such that many small operators had to close their doors. Larger companies, such as the big hotel chains were able to keep operating, but most were forced to scale back their operations, introducing compulsory unpaid leave, lower wages, and in many cases, laying off staff.\n\nAnd it was not just traditional tourism operators who were hit hard. So many businesses, and indeed economies throughout Asia Pacific, now rely on tourism. The flow-on effects were felt by restaurants, shopping malls, dry-cleaning operators, photo processors, not to mention the black market or cash economy. It was later established that as many as 3 million frontline tourism-related jobs were lost as a result of SARS (World Travel & Tourism Council, 2003) .\n\nAnd much of this destruction was caused by fear. Fear that was often unwarranted but, in the absence of more definitive information from the likes of WHO, highly understandable. In the heat of the moment, many in the tourism industry turned on the media, blaming global networks, such as CNN, for fuelling a climate of fear by running constant images of Asian people in masks and stories highlighting the spread of disease. Yet, this was really a case of shooting the messenger. The media were only reporting what was known at the time -and that was precious little! Governments had little idea what they were dealing with, and accurate information was in short supply. In this information vacuum, the media had little choice but to fill in the gaps in what BBC presenter Nik Gowing once described as 'the race for space'. They invited experts to speculate on likely outcomes, to answer the 'what if' questions that lead to great headlines but rarely give a balanced picture of the situation.\n\nIn fact, it was not until April 16 that WHO announced a conclusive identification of the causative agent of SARS: an entirely new strain of the corona virus family.\n\nBy May 2003, the tourism industry had realised not only the severity of the crisis but also its likely longevity. This was a problem that was going to stick around for months, possibly years, to come. It was time for action.\n\nFounded in 1951, PATA is the region's leading travel-trade association. A not-for-profit organisation, it provides leadership and advocacy to the collective efforts of nearly 100 government, state and city tourism bodies, more than 55 airlines and cruise lines, and hundreds of travel industry companies throughout Asia Pacific. PATA defines its mission as enhancing the growth, value and quality of Asia Pacific travel and tourism for the benefit of its membership. So, it was well placed to lead the industry's fight back against SARS.\n\nIn May 2003, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), with PATA's support, called a meeting of industry leaders in Singapore to assess the situation. \"The atmosphere was highly charged,\" recounts PATA Director, Communications Ken Scott. \"Everyone was hurting and they desperately wanted someone to step up and show some leadership\" (Scott, 2005) .\n\nPATA was ready to rise to the challenge. President and CEO Peter de Jong had recently reshaped the organisation's strategic agenda with a stronger focus on advocacy, to position PATA as the leading authority on travel and tourism in Asia Pacific. Here was a chance to bring the new direction to life.\n\nOver the next 3 weeks, PATA Vice President, Development, Peter Semone, worked closely with Ian Lancaster and Michael de Kretser of leading regional PR agency, MDK Consultants, to develop the blueprint for the recovery plan.\n\nIn June 2003, PATA launched Project Phoenix, a 3-month project to restore consumer and business confidence in travel to and within Asia Pacific. Given the focus on recovery, the image of the Phoenix, rising from the ashes, was a logical one. MDK was hired to manage the project and Hong Kong-based tourism specialist (and author of this chapter) Michael Yates of Taramax Consultants, was appointed Executive Director.\n\nFrom the outset, Phoenix was essentially a communication programme. The objective was clear -to persuade consumers and travel agents that it was time to put Asia Pacific back on their shopping list of travel destinations.\n\nBecause PATA knew that until Asia Pacific's reputation as a warm, welcoming and relatively safe region for travellers was restored, no amount of price discounting would lure scared and skeptical travellers back on to planes.\n\nThe first challenge was to collect a fighting fund from PATA members around the region. Initially, the fund raisers were greeted with predictable responses such as: 'We don't have SARS so it's not our problem'. Or they were rebuffed by the more opportunistic operators who were working on the theory that another destination's pain could be their gain.\n\nBut the Phoenix team had a strong counter argument. SARS, and the fear of SARS, knew no borders. And it was not long before countries without SARS soon learnt the harsh truth of this reality. When Phoenix launched at the Shangri-La Hotel in Bangkok in early June, occupancy levels had been hovering around 20 per cent for weeks, despite the fact that Thailand had been virtually SARS free. It was the same story across the region.\n\nThe outcome of the funding drive was an unprecedented show of support from governments across the region. Virtually every major National Tourism Office came on board. Plus there were contributions from six key industry players. In a matter of weeks, more than US$350,000 had been raised, with many more pledges of in-kind support.\n\nWhile the level of support was heartening, it still left the Phoenix team with a major marketing challenge: how to overturn consumer perceptions about travel to and within Asia Pacific with a budget that, in global marketing terms, amounted to a jar of peanuts?\n\nThe first response was a proactive public relations blitz, which had the advantage of speed, low-cost and high credibility. Through an intensive burst of releases, interviews and backgrounders, PATA managers tackled the SARS myths and misperceptions. They also worked behind the scenes with contacts at CNN, BBC and CNBC to position PATA as the authority for comments and reliable statistical information.\n\nPhoenix achieved a good deal of 'free ink', across both TV and press. But it was still struggling to get global reach and impact. More needed to be done. Fortunately for PATA, it was about to receive a major boost from its Premier Partners, CNN International, TIME and Fortune.\n\nKeen to contribute to the recovery process, CNN pro-actively approached PATA with an offer to jointly develop a campaign to help restore confidence in the region, backed by significant chunk of free airtime and advertising space. The generous offer resulted in a powerful campaign widely acclaimed by the travel industry. Called 'Welcome Back', it was a pitch to the hearts and minds of global travelers, not their wallets.\n\nThe 60-s TV commercial, which was launched on 18 August, tapped into the hearts of travellers everywhere by recalling memories of past travels and the warmth of Asian people met along the way. It reached an estimated 130 million households in Europe and Asia Pacific.\n\nThe 2-month campaign included two print advertisements which were rotated in TIME (US and international editions) and Fortune Magazine (Europe and Asia editions). CNN, TIME and Fortune donated airtime worth in excess of US$1.4 million, and Kuala Lumpurbased advertising agency, TBWA donated their time to make the commercial.\n\nInspired by the success of \"Welcome Back\", the Phoenix team began to negotiate free or heavily discounted ad space from other global and regional media players, who relied on a healthy tourism sector for much of their ad revenue. The strategy worked brilliantly, with the launch of four other major campaigns, as follows:\n\nPATA partnered with BBC World to produce a series of eight, 60-s vignettes called Asia Pacific Guides. The Guides showcased the best holiday attractions of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan -representing the top supporters of Project Phoenix. Launched on 17 September, the 2-month campaign was broadcast to 74 million households on BBC World's Asia Pacific and Europe feeds.\n\nNational Geographic Channel and PATA combined forces to produce an exciting 30-s TV ad to drive consumer traffic to PATA's new consumer web site, TravelWithPATA.com. The US$400,000 campaign launched on 24 September ran through to the end of December. It was seen by an estimated 12 million households on the National Geographic Channel and its new Adventure One (A1) Channel.\n\nPATA produced its own campaign to encourage travellers back to the region, as well as recognising the National Tourist Offices and travel companies which supported Project Phoenix.\n\nThe campaign featured:\n\n\u2022 A 20-s TV spot which promoted PATA's new web site.\n\n\u2022 A consumer print advertisement which welcomed return travellers and gave brand recognition to Phoenix contributors. \u2022 A trade print advertisement focusing on Project Phoenix and thanking the contributors.\n\nRegional trade publications such as TTG Asia, Travel Weekly and Travel Trade Reporter provided free ad space to support the SMILES campaign.\n\nTo reach consumers around the world, Project Phoenix needed to take its message online. So a critical element of the project was the creation of a new consumer web site. The Phoenix team worked overtime with web designers, Open World, to create an exciting new site called TravelWithPATA.com.\n\nBuilt and launched in less than 6 weeks, TravelWithPATA.com went live in mid-August. It offered travel news and features, travel advice and comprehensive guides to 48 destinations in the region, with content provided by Lonely Planet. There were also special travel deals and offers from PATA members, as well as updated weather reports, maps and currency exchange guides.\n\nThe web site played an important role in helping to position PATA with global travellers as a source of reliable and accurate information about travel in Asia Pacific, particularly at a time when this was in short supply.\n\nOf course, once Project Phoenix campaigns were underway, individual destinations began their own campaigns to win back tourists. They were generally more tactical in nature, often with special discounts and value-added offers. The value of Phoenix was that it created a more receptive environment for these campaigns in key source markets.\n\nIn September 2003, Singapore's Ministry of Health called a snap press conference to announce that a 27-year-old Singaporean laboratory worker had become the first new SARS case in 5 months. The news sent shudders throughout the Asia Pacific region.\n\nWithin hours of the press conference, the Straits Times Index had fallen 2.6 per cent, wiping millions of dollars from the value of listed companies, particularly travel stocks such as Singapore Airlines and Shangri-La Hotels. The anger emanating from boardrooms across corporate Asia was palpable. The laboratory worker had returned positive blood tests, indicating the presence of SARS, but he did not meet WHO criteria for the official confirmation of a new SARS case. Why did the Ministry not wait until x-ray tests -the WHO standard -proved conclusively that the worker had SARS, before going to the media? Surely, it realised the pronouncement -no matter how many qualifying comments accompanied it -would only trigger unwarranted fears of a return of the SARS epidemic and a blood-letting on regional stock markets? The Ministry, for its part, argued there were much bigger issues at stake. Quick action and public awareness were critical factors in preventing the spread of deadly, highly contagious diseases, it argued. As soon as there was sufficient evidence to suggest SARS had reemerged, it was time to go public. Plus, the Ministry said, it was made clear at the conference that this was an isolated case. Quarantining 25 of the worker's colleagues and friends was merely a precautionary measure.\n\nSo who was right -the business community or the Government? The answer lies in the resolution of a conflict between notions of public duty and realpolitik. In short, it requires a delicate balancing act between (a) the Government's obligation to act quickly and decisively to safeguard public health versus (b) the risk of exacerbating the problem by generating unwarranted widespread concern.\n\nThis is not to question the need for government transparency and accountability. China's stubborn refusal to recognise the outbreak of SARS for several months was catastrophic in its consequences. Similarly, Thailand's initial reluctance to acknowledge the outbreak of bird flu -out of concern for its billion dollar poultry export business -was totally counter-productive. Not only did it cost lives, but it also jeopardised the country's improving reputation as a regional leader.\n\nRather, what this demonstrates is the need to 'manage' the public release of potentially explosive information. To ensure that facts and not conjecture -not even conjecture based on sound scientific hypotheses -are delivered to the public. Contagious disease is a scary topic. By its very nature, it breeds fear which can be deadly for tourism.\n\nIf SARS was a stark reminder to tourism industry leaders about the importance of the relationship between the health and tourism sectors, then the more recent outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza, better known as bird flu, has driven home the message.\n\nOf course, health and tourism are not strangers. Many who travelled internationally through the 1960s and 1970s would recall, without much fondness, the mandatory immunisations for cholera and typhoid required before travel visas to many destinations could be issued.\n\nIn more recent times, the relationship has developed from regulatory to opportunistic. 'Health tourism' has taken off in a huge way, with services ranging from spas, wellness and detox resorts to full-blown surgery at five-star hospitals. It is big business, and correctly managed, can be a win-win for both health and tourism development.\n\nOver the past 2 years, however, the relationship has been tested by crisis and, at times, found wanting. Both sectors simply had not developed the strategic alliances and personal contacts that form the basis of meaningful co-operation.\n\nDuring SARS, destinations experienced for the first time, the brutal impact of healthbased travel advisories. On 2 April, when WHO warned against all but essential travel to Hong Kong and Guangdong, it was the first time in WHO's 55-year history that it had issued such an advisory. And the consequences were immediate, as global travellers were quick to heed the advice.\n\nThroughout April and May, WHO issued further advisories against travel to other destinations, including Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei and Toronto, with similarly immediate impacts on travel flows.\n\nWhile the travel industry does not challenge WHO's right to issue such advisories, it does seek to be part of the decision-making process. With advisories issued by either WHO or by the Foreign Affairs departments of governments around the world, PATA is leading an industry drive to establish consultative forums, whereby the travel sector can offer constructive input on the scope of the advisory and its likely impact.\n\nPATA's closer relationship with WHO and the health community was particularly evident in the way both organisations co-operated in making public statements to the media on the threats posed by bird flu. \"The simple fact is that the risk to travelers (posed by bird flu) is minimal unless they come into direct contact with livestock or eat raw or undercooked poultry,\" says PATA's Ken Scott (2005), \"however this message will always appear more credible coming from a health authority as opposed to a travel authority with vested interests. So every time we make public statements on this issue, we do so in consultation with WHO\".\n\nScott (2005) says PATA is starting to forge links with health authorities, not just in times of crisis, but also to understand the key issues, and to recognise the symbiotic nature of the two sectors.\n\nOn almost any measure, Project Phoenix achieved a great deal. Let's look first at its primary objective: to restore confidence in travel to the region. The combined impact of the Phoenix campaigns was enormous. In the 6 months after its launch in June 2003, they delivered free airtime worth in excess of US$2.2 million. Campaigns were running continuously from mid-August to end December -reaching 216 million high-end consumer households worldwide.\n\nDid the campaigns succeed in motivating people to travel again? Qualitative feedback indicates they were well received. \"Well done, and you HAVE succeeded in making people travel again!\" said UK-based publisher Mary Gostelow (2003) (2003), told PATA that he circulated the Welcome Back TV commercial to his Disneyland colleagues in the US and asked for their candid assessment. \"The feedback has been very good, so I thought I'd share this comment from cast member Derric Cheung who wrote \u2026.. 'Roy, this is very well done, it makes me want to pack my suitcase right now'\".\n\nStatistical evidence also points to a recovery in tourism arrivals in the second half of 2003, accelerating into 2004. While it is impossible to make direct correlations between the campaign activity and the upturn in tourist traffic without tracking research surveys, there is no doubt that the campaigns contributed to the rebound in business, particularly when viewed in concert with the individual destination campaigns.\n\nGiven that Phoenix campaign activity ran from mid-August through to end December 2003, it would be reasonable to expect the impact on travel behaviour to be reflected in the last quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. So what happened in those two periods? After 6 months of decline, international visitor arrivals into Asia Pacific increased by 2.9 per cent in the last quarter of 2003 and 8.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2004 (Table 18 .2).\n\nAmong the worst-affected Asian destinations, Taiwan (which was the last destination to be removed from WHO's danger list) and Singapore (which had a second SARS alert in September 2003) were predictably the slowest to recover. However, by March 2003, just 3 months after the final Phoenix campaigns went to air, all but one of the worst-affected destinations were recording positive growth. By April 2003, all were rebounding strongly (Table 18 .3). According to the Head of PATA's Strategic Intelligence Centre, John Koldowski, much of the rebound, particularly for Hong Kong (see Table 18 .4), can be attributed to the flows generated from mainland China, as a combination of pent-up demand and a relaxation of the rules governing cross-border movements into Hong Kong and Macau. \"Mainland China has grown to the point where it now accounts for more than 56 per cent of all inbound travel into Hong Kong SAR,\" observed Koldowski (2005) .\n\nAs a reputation management programme, Project Phoenix has received wide acclaim from both public-and private-sector leaders. Canadian Tourism Commission President and CEO, Doug Fyfe (2003) , summed up the views of many when he said of Project Phoenix, \"In all my years associated with the travel industry, I have never seen such professional expertise. Quick, cogent, informative ... this is damn fine. Thanks\".\n\nCertainly, the travel and tourism sector learnt lessons from Project Phoenix. There is now a much better understanding of the different nature of threats to travel and tourism. While global consumers are becoming more inured to security threats, they are still terrified of undiagnosed health threats. One of the biggest lessons learned is the importance of co-ordinated communications. Truth is an early casualty in many crises, and professional reputation management tools are required to dispel myths and misperceptions before they take root in the public consciousness. Ideally, Phoenix would have started earlier. By June, when the project launched, much of the damage had been done, resulting in a focus of recovery rather than prevention, or at least damage control. Ideally, PATA would have built an earlier relationship with key external influencers like WHO. But of course it is easy to be wise in hindsight.\n\nIn an effort to be better prepared to deal with future crises, PATA has established a sector-wide consultative group, called the Pacific Asia Coalition for Travel or PACT. Members of PACT include senior management representatives of international airports, airlines, hotels and restaurants, national tourism offices, distribution companies and dutyfree operators. In the event of crisis, the group has two core objectives: to ensure accurate information is distributed as quickly and effectively as possible, with PATA acting as 'one voice' for the tourism and travel in Asia Pacific; and to share best practices in dealing with the crisis. PATA has also established a database of Tourism Communicators, comprising the marketing communications managers of its various member organisations, thereby ensuring a fast, amplified and consistent flow of messaging. One of the most valuable outcomes of Phoenix was PATA's increased focus on continuous monitoring and scanning of developments likely to impact tourism flows. \"Our heightened vigilance, post-SARS, enabled us to respond rapidly and vigorously to the tsunami crisis,\" says PATA's Koldowski (2005) , \"on December 26, within hours of the disaster, PATA was already issuing public statements on the impact of the tsunami and referring people to our website for the latest developments\".\n\nIn the following weeks, PATA's Strategic Intelligence Centre issued comprehensive twice-daily updates on the tsunami, monitoring the availability of hotel rooms, air services and other vital travel data.\n\nHopefully, an enduring legacy of Project Phoenix will be recognition of the value of global and regional co-operation, across both the private and public sectors. Phoenix triggered an unprecedented display of regional unity, with highly competitive destinations and brands working together for the common good. Ultimately, this may prove to be the most potent weapon in dealing with the challenges that inevitably lie ahead of us.\n\nIn Taiwan, a 54-year-old businessman with a travel history to Guangdong is hospitalised with respiratory symptoms.\n\nDr Urbani flies to Bangkok to give a presentation on tropical illnesses. He is sick on arrival and immediately hospitalised.\n\nWHO issues global alert about severe typical pneumonia outbreak.\n\nSARS is named. WHO names the mysterious illness after its symptoms -severe acute respiratory syndrome -and declares it a 'worldwide health threat'. WHO also issues a rare travel advisory, warning about the dangers of international air travel.\n\nCases are now being reported in Canada, Germany, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom, as well as in Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore.\n\nFirst cases reported in the US.\n\nHong Kong closes schools, with more than 1000 people in quarantine. WHO issues more stringent travel advice, including recommendations for airport screening.\n\nDr Urbani dies of SARS in Thailand.\n\nHealth authorities in Hong Kong issue an unprecedented isolation order to prevent further spread of SARS, after it is known that 213 residents of a housing estate have been hospitalised.\n\nWHO issues a travel advisory against all but essential travel to Hong Kong and Guangdong. It is the first such advisory in WHO's 55-year history.\n\nMorgan Stanley estimates the global economic impact of SARS at US$30 billion.\n\nA cumulative total of 2671 cases and 103 deaths are reported from 17 countries.\n\nWHO announces conclusive identification of the SARS causative agent: an entirely new conavirus.\n\nThe Mayor of Beijing and the Minister of Health, both of whom had downplayed the SARS threat, are sacked. Chinese authorities report more than 2000 cases and 92 deaths. Schools are closed.\n\nWHO extends it travel advisories to include Beijing, Shanghai and Toronto.\n\nOutbreaks in Hanoi, Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto show signs of peaking, following intensive quarantine measures.\n\nTravel advisory applied to Taiwan, after an outbreak of 100 cases.\n\nReported cases of SARS exceeds 8000 worldwide.\n\nAs the outbreak enters its 100th day, the number of new daily cases dwindles to a handful.\n\nWHO removes the last country with recent transmission -Taiwan -from its list, effectively signalling the end of the outbreak."}
