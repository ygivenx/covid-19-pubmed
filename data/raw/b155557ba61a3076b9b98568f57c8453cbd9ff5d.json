{"title": "An Investigation into the P:ossib|e Role of the Family Unit in the Transmission of Rotavirus Infections of Chiltdren", "body": "Human infantile gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus infection is well documented?\"-\" Although the faecal-oral route is a likely .candidate for the way in which the virus is transferred from person to person, in terms o f virus shedding little notice has been taken of potential contacts o r children and other members of .the family with gastroenteritis. The object o f the st:udy reported here was to perform a survey o f children admitted to hospital with gasteroenteritis and where possible to investigate the family as it is probable lhat young children may be infected by older siblings and/or their parents.\n\nFaecal samples were :obtained during a 9-month period, October .to May, from 20 successive cases of gastroenteritis admitted to one ward of the Children's Hospital, Sunderland. The ages of the children ranged from 2 weeks to 5 years. Samples from patients with gastroenteritis were screened for the absence o f bacterial pathogens before virological examination, and control samples were obtained from patients hospitalized .for reasons other than suspected infection, for example, treatment for hernia or circumcision. Specimens w e r e coded by a third party, transported from hospital t o laboratory in ice, and were stored for not more than 48 h r at 4 \u00b0C before processing. Where .they were obtainable, samples from members of the patient's family we're obtained as soon as confirmation was made that the original infection was viral in origin.\n\n0038--3506/78/060285 + 06 $01:00/0 (~-) I 978 The .Society of Community Medicine\n\nScreening of the samples was carried out by electron microscopy. Twenty per cent (~v/v) suspensions were prepared from each specimen in phosphate-buffered sa.line (PISS)and mixed gently. These suspensions were then centrifuged for 15 rain at low speed (800~< g) to sediment gross debris and the supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 12,090 \u00d7 g for 45 rr~in a~ 4\u00b0. the resulting pellet lhen being washed in PBS and the ultracenttifugation repeated. The pellet from this second spin was resuspended in a small volume(0.1-0-2 ml) ofdistilled water, one drop mixed with an equal volume of 3\"0 ~ phosphotungstic acid, pH 6.0 and transferred to a carbon-formvar coated grid, which was dried and examined in a Sie~llens Elmiskop I A electron microscope. When virus particles were present they were usually detected quite quickly, within 4-5 minutes of examining the specimen, although in s0raqe instances more prolonged examination of the grid was necessary.\n\nThe 30 children with gastroentefitis comprised 18 (60~',~) boys and 12 (40~o) girls, si~nilar to a survey by Carr, McKendrick & Spyridakis. 3 Seventy per cent of the chi]dreaa were under 6 months of age. All the children were admitted to hospital between the second arid fourth day o f their illness with a history of diarrhoea. The stools were mainly loose, ydlo~,v motions,. A few children passed explosive watery stools. Nineteen (63~) children had upper respiratory tract symptoms and/or signs such as snuffles, cough, otitis media o r pharyngitis.\n\nNone o f the children was seriously ill. Only one patient was modera:tely dehydrated and required intravenous fluid therapy; the remaining 29 patients were treated with soya bean (Velactin) feeds for 48 hours and then infants were given their usual dried milk preparation, whilst older children were recommended on their normal diet. The average length o f stay in hospital was seven days.\n\nOf the 30 children with gastroenteritis, 23 (77 ~o) had rotavirus in their stools. One child had cozonavirus and another a pathogenic E. coil N o viruses or pathogenic bacteria were found in the stools o f the remaining five patients.\n\nThere were 15 control children, none of whom had diarrhoea and no rotavirus or pathogenic organisms were detected in the stools. However, coronavirus was found in the faeces of one control child. For contact studies, samples o f faeces were obtained from members of five families.\n\nIn the first family, the father and a 5-year-old brother of the patient, and a sister aged 2 were all found to be shedding rotavirus in large amounts, although father and brother were symptom-free.\n\nThe second family comprised the patient aged 3 months, and her mother; both .had rotavirus in their stools, whilst a 4-year-old brother was excreting adenovirus.\n\nThe third family with rotavirus in the stools consisted of a 2-month-old baby and a symptom-free mother. The fathers in the second and third families showed no rotavirus.\n\nIn the fourth family, the patient, a 2-year-old girl, and her two older s~sters aged 4 and 6, all had rotavirus in their stools. T h e two older girls had slight diarrhoea but were not admitted to hospital. Mother and father's stool examinations were negative ,for rotavirus.\n\nIn the fifth family, twins aged nine months were both found to be positive for r.otavirus. Whether one twin contracted the infection from the other, or whether both acquired it from a parent is not clear. Specimens from both parents were negative.\n\nInfection with rotavirus as a cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis is now well established, particularly in very young children although other viruses are clearly involved as well? \"s In the present study, rotavirus was found in 23 o f the 30 patients, an incidence of 77 ~o. This is higher than most reports, e.g. Chrystie et al. 6 and Davidson et al. 7 both reported 48 ~ infection rate in their studies. However, higher infection rates have been reported in the winter period, -\".8 which was the time during which our study was conducted.\n\nThe means whereby rotavirus gastroenteritis is contracted is still not conclusive. The most likely explanation seems to be direct contact from infected :to uninfe~ed individuals. Murphy, A~lbrey & Crewe 9 suggested environmental spread from neonate to neonate in the study o f babies in newborn humans. As most clinical reports are o f young chfldren with gastroentefitis, direct contact would appear to be important. In 1976 Zissis a\u00b0 and his colleagues reported transmission of rotavirus gastroenteritis from a 5-year-old boy to his mother.\n\nAlthough the present study is not large, we have been able to study potential means o f spread of rotavirus within families, a subject which has hitherto been largety a matter o f conjecture. In each of the five unrelated families studies, one or more members were found to be Shedding rotavirus, though not necessarily showing symptoms of infection. It is therefore quite likely that a parent-to-child or sibling-to-sibling-spread is the principal means by which rotavirus is disseminated."}
