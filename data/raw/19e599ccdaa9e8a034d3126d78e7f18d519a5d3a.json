{"title": "", "body": "The schedules provided in this appendix are guidelines for immunization of dogs and cats against major viral and bacterial agents. These assume the availability of (1) client resources and (2) suitable products for immunization. The schedules are based on guidelines written by the WSAVA, AAHA, AAFP, and ABCD 1-11 and on information available at the time of writing. These are general guidelines, because the vaccine types recommended and the frequency of immunization vary depending on the lifestyle of the pet being immunized-that is, indoor versus outdoor pets, shelter animals, travel plans, kennel/boarding plans, and underlying disease conditions such as immune-mediated diseases or preexisting infections such as FIV infection. Because these factors may change over time, the vaccination plan for individual pet animals should be decided by the owner at routine annual examinations, after a discussion between the veterinarian and the client regarding the animal's lifestyle in the year ahead and the advantages and disadvantages of vaccination. This discussion should be documented in the medical record. A previous history of vaccine reactions in an individual pet will also affect recommendations for immunization. Considerable research is still required to generate optimal recommendations for vaccination of dogs and cats.\n\nGuidelines for vaccination of individual pet dogs and cats are summarized in Tables A-1 and A-2, respectively. Noncore. * Only for FeLV-negative cats.\n\nFeLV testing before administration mandatory before first administering the vaccine to kittens and if exposure was likely before, booster immunization is required. Can provide strong protection. 13 \n\nFor shelter animals, attenuated live core vaccines apart from rabies should be given before or immediately on entry to the shelter. Optimally, immunization for CPV and CDV should occur at least 3 days before entry to a shelter environment, but immunization even hours before entry has the potential to make a difference. When outbreaks of known parvovirus disease or canine distemper are present, vaccines can be administered as early as 4 to 5 weeks of age, but they should not be administered earlier than this because of the possibility of vaccine-induced disease and immunosuppression. In the absence of an outbreak situation, immunization for these pathogens should be performed no earlier than 6 weeks of age. In a shelter situation, the benefits and risks of vaccination of individual pregnant animals with attenuated live vaccines must be carefully assessed. Immunization with an inactivated vaccine is probably better than no vaccine for pregnant animals that enter a shelter, but inactivated vaccines should not be administered to other animals in the shelter environment, because the onset of immunity is slower than with attenuated live vaccines. Attenuated live vaccines should be administered if ovariohysterectomy is to be performed during pregnancy. If pregnant animals are not immunized, they should be strictly isolated from the rest of the shelter animal population. The use of rapid in-house serologic tests that determine the immune status of pregnant animals may be helpful in this situation (see Chapter 12) .\n\nRevaccination should be performed no more frequently than at intervals of 2 to 3 weeks, because vaccine administration that occurs within 3 to 14 days of another immunization attempt with attenuated live vaccines can interfere with development of immune responses. Further study is required to determine optimum revaccination intervals in shelter environments. Revaccination is most important for pups and kittens younger than 16 weeks of age and is performed to maximize the chance of immunization as soon as possible after the disappearance of maternal antibody interference. Puppies and kittens should also be physically separated from the rest of the shelter animal population and handled with strict attention to quarantine protocols.\n\nIntranasal vaccines are preferred for management of upper respiratory tract disease in shelter environments because of the potential for improved local immunity, the possibility of administration to very young animals, more rapid onset of protection, and improved protection in the face of maternal antibody. However, they also have been associated with vaccine-induced upper respiratory disease, which may be more severe in debilitated animals and can be difficult to distinguish from natural infection. In addition, field studies have yet not shown benefit of intranasal over parenteral vaccines for prevention of respiratory disease. 14 Intranasal Bordetella bronchiseptica vaccines should never be given parenterally. This is an emergency situation that requires immediate treatment. See Chapter 12 for specific instructions for how to manage accidental parenteral administration of these vaccines.\n\nIn endemic areas, if possible, a rabies vaccine could be administered at the time of discharge from the facility. 1 Administration of a 3-year product is preferred, but regardless of the product used, booster immunization must be performed no later than 1 year after the initial immunization. Rabies immunization must be properly documented, and a veterinarian must usually be present at the time of immunization. Otherwise, the number of vaccines should be limited to those that can assist control of disease that is confirmed to exist within the shelter. This will avoid excessive immune suppression that may worsen the severity of illness due to other pathogens in the shelter for which vaccines are nonexistent. "}
