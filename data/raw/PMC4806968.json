{"title": "Exportations of Symptomatic Cases of MERS-CoV Infection to Countries\noutside the Middle East", "body": "We calculated the expected annual number of exportations of symptomatic cases of\ninfection with MERS-CoV and the likelihood of exportation from the Middle Eastern\ncountries where additional cases have been detected (KSA, Jordan, Qatar, and the United\nArab Emirates [UAE], which we refer to as source countries) to countries outside the\nMiddle East. We defined exportation as the arrival of a person infected with MERS-CoV in\na country other than KSA, Jordan, Qatar, and UAE as a result of MERS-CoV infection in\nthose source countries and subsequent outbound travel (not including medical\nevacuation). Because it is unclear whether MERS-CoV cases in Middle Eastern countries\nother than the source countries resulted from importation or a local outbreak, those\ncountries were excluded from the analysis. Exportations can occur by visitors returning\nto their home countries or source country residents traveling abroad. We produced\nexample calculations for destination countries outside the Middle East where exportation\nof MERS-CoV infection cases has been confirmed (Algeria, Austria, France, Greece, Italy,\nMalaysia, Netherlands, Tunisia, United Kingdom, and the United States) as of January 16,\n2015 (Table 1).\n\nTo calculate exportations, we used a simple multiplier model whereby MERS-CoV incidence\nrates among source country residents were extrapolated to rates among visitors. In\nparticular, for each source country, the expected number of cases among travelers was\ncalculated by multiplying the infection rate among residents in the affected countries\n(total number of cases divided by number of residents) by the number of travelers and\nthe days travelers spend, on average, in the affected countries (9). To calculate incidence rates in destination\ncountries, the number of symptomatic cases was considered to be 10 times greater than\nthe reported number of cases (8).\nCalculations were made by using Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA).\nThe probability of exportation was calculated while assuming the number of exportations\nwas Poisson distributed, with the mean equal to the expected exportations (Technical Appendix 1, and Technical Appendix 2). \n\nExpected annual exportations of symptomatic MERS-CoV infection cases among visitors to\nthe Middle East source countries were highest among visitors to KSA (Table 2). For visitors returning from KSA, expected\nexportations were higher among visitors returning to Algeria, where the number of\nexpected exportations was 1 (95% CI 0\u20135) and the likelihood of\n>1 exportation was 58%; and Malaysia, where the number of\nexpected exportations was 1 (95% CI 0\u20135) and the likelihood of\n>1 exportation was 47%.\n\nExpected exportations among residents from the Middle East source countries traveling\nabroad also were estimated to be higher for visitors from KSA (Table 3). Expected exportations among residents in KSA visiting\nabroad were highest for the United States, where the number of expected exportations was\n1 (95% CI 0\u20135) and the likelihood of >1 exportation was\n51%.\n\nMore complex models have been developed to characterize exportations of infectious\ndisease cases via infectious travelers (10,11). The main advantage of our approach is its simplicity\nand reproducibility within short timeframes. This model also complements previous work\non the risk for MERS-CoV exportation by global air travel, which attempted to quantify\ntravel volume to the affected areas and calculate exportations among Hajj pilgrims in\nKSA (12,13). In our calculations, however, the visitor data\nincluded persons traveling by air, land, and sea and distinguished between visitors to\nthe Middle East and persons from the Middle East traveling abroad over the period of 1\nyear. Unlike Khan et al. (12),\nwe accounted for the rate of infection in the source countries by calculating source\ncountry\u2013specific MERS-CoV incidence rates. Furthermore, by accounting for the\ndifferent travel volume of visitors to the Middle East compared with Middle East\nresidents traveling to non\u2013Middle Eastern countries, we suggested the mode of\nexportation (visitor to the Middle East vs. Middle East resident visiting abroad). For\nMalaysia, estimated expected exportations were higher among visitors to source countries\nthan among source country residents visiting abroad, consistent with the number of\nexportations detected by surveillance. However, the opposite was true for the United\nStates, where 2 source country residents were found to have MERS-CoV infection during\ntheir US visit (7).\n\nOur findings have limitations. The estimates are based on historical incidence data.\nThus, they are especially applicable for periods in which the incidence of the disease\nremains stable. For outbreaks characterized by a highly transmissible pathogen, the\nmodel might severely underestimate exportations if incidence rates are not projected to\nthe period for which exportations are calculated. In addition, our small multiplier only\ntook into account exportations of symptomatic cases. Given that most of the detected\nexportations resulted in hospitalization of the infected case-patient, the number of\nexportations calculated here likely refers to exportations of severe symptomatic cases.\nRecent results from a serologic survey performed during December 2012\u2013December\n2013 indicate that there might be as many as 44,951 (95% CI 26,971\u201371,922)\npersons infected with MERS-CoV in KSA (14). During that period, there were 125 reported\nconfirmed cases; thus, the ratio of asymptomatic to reported cases might be much higher,\npossibly in the hundreds. This finding suggests that exportations of asymptomatic cases\nmight be several orders of magnitude higher than those of severe symptomatic cases.\n\nThe upper bound of exportations for the countries least likely to receive symptomatic\ncase importations was 4, suggesting that small numbers of importations are largely\nstochastic events. Although every country is at risk, as illustrated by the recent\noutbreak of MERS-CoV infections in South Korea that was triggered by just 1 importation\n(15), our model can be used\nto assess risk level. Combined with other indicators, our model can help determine the\nlevel of additional public health measures (e.g., border screenings) required for\ninfectious diseases threats from abroad.\n\nNo exportations of symptomatic cases were detected in some of the top travel volume\ncountries for trips originating in KSA, Jordan, UAE, and Qatar. Travel volume to Egypt,\nIndia, and Pakistan was several times higher than that for other countries where\nMERS-CoV has been detected. However, only 1 case of MERS-CoV infection has been detected\nin Egypt (in a KSA resident) (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_05_01_mers), and no MERS-CoV cases have\nbeen detected in India or Pakistan. This finding suggests that MERS-CoV introductions\nmay have already occurred in these countries but have not been detected.\n\nIn summary, by adapting a simple model of disease spread, we estimated the expected\nnumber of MERS-CoV symptomatic case exportations during a 1-year period among visitors\nto the Middle East and visitors from KSA, Jordan, Qatar, and UAE to non\u2013Middle\nEastern countries where case exportations have occurred. Our estimations suggest that\nthe risk for repeated exportations of severe symptomatic MERS-CoV cases is low, although\nthe number of asymptomatic case exportations might be higher."}
