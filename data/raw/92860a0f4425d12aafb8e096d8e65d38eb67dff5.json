{"title": "Mutation of Ebola virus VP35 Ser129 uncouples interferon antagonist and replication functions", "body": "Ebolaviruses are non-segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses (NNSVs) within the order 19\n\nMononegavirales that possess the multifunctional virion protein 35 (VP35), a major determinant 20 of virulence and pathogenesis that is indispensable for viral replication and host innate immune 21 evasion. VP35 is functionally equivalent to the phosphoprotein (P) of other mononegaviruses 22\n\nsuch as rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses. Phosphorylation of the P protein is universally 23 regarded as functionally important however, a regulatory role(s) of phosphorylation on VP35 24 function remains unexplored. Here, we identified a highly conserved Ser129 residue near the 25 homo-oligomerization coiled coil motif, which is essential for VP35 functions. Affinity-purification 26\n\nMS followed by post-translational modification (PTM) analysis predicted phosphorylation of 27\n\nSer129. Co-immunoprecipitation, cross-linking, and biochemical characterization studies 28 revealed a moderately decreased capacity of VP35-S129A to oligomerize. Functional analysis 29\n\nshowed that Ser-to-Ala substitution of Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35 did not affect IFN inhibitory 30 activity but nearly abolished EBOV minigenome activity. Further coimmunoprecipitation studies 31 demonstrated a lost interaction between VP35-S129A and the amino terminus of the viral 32 polymerase but not between viral nucleoprotein (NP) or VP35-WT. Taken together, our findings 33 provide evidence that phosphorylation modulates VP35 function, supporting VP35 as a NNSV P 34\n\nprotein and providing a potentially valuable therapeutic target. suppression, VP35 also functions as an essential cofactor of the viral RNA-dependent RNA 82 polymerase (named L for large polymerase protein). The functional viral polymerase complex is 83 comprised of nucleoprotein (NP) and VP30 in addition to L and VP35 (Muhlberger et (1976 Yambuku-Mayinga strain) was constructed as previously reported (Cannas et al., 2015) .\n\nThe VP35-S129A substitution was introduced in the pcDNA3-EBOV VP35 plasmid using the 156\n\nQuikChange mutagenesis kit by following the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies 157\n\nInc., Santa Clara, CA).

The precursor mass tolerance threshold was set 10 ppm 208\n\nfor and maximum fragment mass error was 0.02 Da. Qualitative analysis was performed using 209 PEAKS 8.5 software. The significance threshold of the ion score was calculated based on a 210\n\nfalse discovery rate of \u2264 1%. 211\n\nHeLa cells (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells) were transfected with the indicated plasmids using 3 \u00b5L of the 213 transfection reagent jetPRIME (Polyplus) per 1 \u00b5g DNA per manufacturer's instructions. The 214\n\ntotal amount of DNA for each transfection was kept constant in each experiment by 215\n\ncomplementing with empty vector. Twenty-four h post-transfection, cells were lysed in a 216 modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.25% 217 Na-deoxycholate) containing protease and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific, 218\n\nWaltham, MA, USA). Approximately 10% WCL was reserved for IB analysis before performing 219 co-IPs. To immunoprecipitate indicated proteins, lysates were incubated with EZview Red ANTI-220 FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) or EZview Red Anti-HA Affinity Gel (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. Beads 221\n\nwere washed 4 to 5 times with TBS, re-suspended in 2X Lane Marker Reducing Sample Buffer 222 (Thermo Scientific), and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, as indicated below. 223\n\nCell lysates were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred onto PVDF 225 membranes. Blots were probed with indicated primary antibodies either 1-2 h at RT or overnight 226 at 4\u00b0C. Secondary incubations were performed for 1-2 h at RT using either goat anti-rabbit HRP 227\n\nor goat anti-mouse HRP. Radiance chemiluminescence substrate (Azure Biosystems; Dublin, 228 CA, USA) was used to visualize protein on an Azure c600 imaging system. 229\n\nHeLa cells were transfected with VP35-WT or VP35-S129A plasmids as previously indicated. hours. Proteins were purified by affinity on a 1 mL complete HisTag Purification Column (Roche) 246\n\nand by size-exclusion on a Superose 12 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) column, respectively. 247\n\nNanoDSF was performed by using a Prometheus NT. 48 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were seeded in 6-well plates, pre-treated with 500 \u00b5l 317\n\nof Poly-D-lysine hydrobromide 100\u00b5g/ml for 1 h. After 24 h cells were transfected with 2500 ng 318 of plasmid (pcDNA3 vector control (VC), pcDNA3_VP35-WT, or pcDNA3_VP35-S129A) using 319\n\nLipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent, as per manufacturer's instruction. Twenty-four h after 320 transfection, cells were stimulated with 2500 ng of IAV-RNA, pre-mixed with the transfection 321 reagent in reduced serum medium Optimem, and incubated for 24 hours at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . 322\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from transfected cells with TRIzol\u00ae Reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was 323 then reverse transcribed and amplified using Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR kit (New reserved from a representative replicate and subjected to immunoblotting as described below.\n\nTo account for potential differences in transfection efficiency, firefly luciferase activity was 353 normalized to Renilla luciferase values and plotted as fold activity calculated relative to the no L 354\n\ncontrol. Mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) values and paired, two-tailed t tests were 355 calculated using GraphPad Prism 7.05 software. 356\n\nEBOV VP35 homo-oligomerization domain contains a putative regulatory serine 358 phosphorylation site 359\n\nGiven that VP35 is analogous to the phosphoprotein of rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses, we 360 first sought to examine EBOV VP35 for sites of phosphorylation by mass spectrometry (MS). 361\n\nAffinity-tagged VP35 was over-expressed in HeLa cells and isolated by immunoaffinity 362\n\npurification. Among predicted phosphorylation sites identified by MS analysis, Ser129 was 363 chosen to evaluate for regulatory phosphorylation function due to its position, which lies just 364 outside the coiled-coil region responsible for VP35 homo-oligomerization ( Figure 1A and C). 365\n\nMoreover, multiple sequence alignment of all ebolavirus species revealed conservation among 366 all ebolavirus species except BOMV ( Figure 1B ). BOMV is a newly identified ebolavirus species 367 and has not yet been shown to be pathogenic in humans. All other ebolaviruses except RESTV 368 are pathogenic in humans, thus we reasoned the conservation of Ser129 may be functionally 369\n\nimportant. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that Ser129 plays an important regulatory role for 370\n\nVP35 as a NNSV P protein. VP35-S129A has moderately diminished oligomerization capacity 372\n\nSer129 impacts the ability of VP35 to oligomerize. Using a non-phosphorylated mimic of VP35 375 generated by alanine substitution at Ser129 (VP35-S129A), we first evaluated the ability of 376\n\nVP35-S129A to interact with VP35-WT. HeLa cells were transfected with HA-VP35-WT or His-377 VP35-S129A alone and in combination with FLAG-VP35-WT. After 24 h, proteins were 378 extracted and immunoprecipitations (IPs) using anti-FLAG beads were performed. IP samples 379\n\nand whole cell lysates (WCLs) were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and products were analyzed 380 by immunoblot. As expected, HA-VP35-WT was shown to be pulled down only in the presence 381\n\nof FLAG-VP35-WT, demonstrating specificity of binding (Figure 2A, top panels) . Similarly, His-382 VP35-S129A was also pulled down in the presence of FLAG-VP35-WT, indicating that the 383 VP35-S129A mutant retains the ability to self-associate. Appropriate protein expression was 384 confirmed by WCL analysis (Figure 2A, bottom panels) . 385\n\nTo next evaluate VP35-S129A oligomerization ability, we performed cross-linking experiments, 386\n\nalong with a series of biochemical studies. VP35-WT and VP35-S129A were separately over-387 expressed in HeLa cells for 24 h. Following cross-linking with Dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) 388\n\n(DSP), the oligomeric forms of VP35 were analyzed by immunoblot under non-reducing, 389\n\nunboiled conditions. After cross-linking with DSP, VP35-WT had a marked increase in higher 390\n\noligomeric forms, as well as a modest decrease in monomeric form, relative to that of the non-391\n\nDSP treated VP35-WT isolate ( Figure 2B ). Notably though, cross-linking of VP35-S129A 392 resulted in a modest reduction in the formation of higher oligomeric forms compared to VP35-393\n\nWT. This indicates that while decreased, VP35-S129A can still oligomerize. 394 (residues 75-185). WT and S129A VP35 oligomerization domains both eluted in one distinct 403 peak with an average molecular mass of 51.8 and 51.6 kDa, respectively ( Figure 2C ).\n\nCorresponding to roughly 3.9 folds in stoichiometry compared to their monomeric molecular 405 weight, these masses are consistent with the presence of a homo-tetramer in solution for both 406\n\nWT and S129A VP35. We then wondered if the defective oligomerization phenotype observed 407 by the cross-linking immunoblot was due to any difference in stability between the homo-408 tetrameric oligomerization domain of the WT and the S129A mutant. To address this question, 409\n\nwe performed thermal stability analysis by miniaturized differential scanning fluorimetry 410 (nanoDSF). As shown by their thermal denaturation curves, WT and S129 VP35 oligomerization 411 domains displayed melting temperature (Tm) values of 72.1\u00b0C and 70.6\u00b0C, respectively ( Figure  412 2D). Although both these inflection points are reminiscent of a stable tertiary structure, the lower 413\n\nTm displayed by the S129A mutant suggests that a higher degree of flexibility exists at the level 414 of the VP35 oligomerization domain. 415 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/726935 doi: bioRxiv preprint Therefore, in order to assess if the S129A mutation could cause structural perturbations 416 sufficient to locally affect the oligomerization domain folding, we tested it by circular dichroism 417\n\n(CD) spectroscopy. In agreement to what has been previously observed for the WT VP35 418 oligomerization domain (Luthra et al., 2015; Zinzula et al., 2019), the CD spectra of the VP35 419 S129A mutant was typical to that of a protein mainly consisting of -helices. Moreover, the 420 value of the 222/208 nm ellipticity ratio was close to 1 for both proteins at all three temperature 421 values tested (4\u00b0C, 23\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C), indicating that the coiled-coil motif -through which the -422\n\nhelices interactremains in place in the S129A mutant. However, the difference in the ellipticity 423\n\nprofile of S129A suggests that this mutation introduces some local conformational change 424\n\n( Figure 2E ). Consistent with this hypothesis, deconvolution of CD spectra and analysis of the 425 secondary structure content showed that the VP35 S129A oligomerization domain has a lower 426 -helical percentage with respect to WT at all temperature values tested, and that this content 427 diminishes as temperature increases ( Figure 2F ). This result indicates that a more flexible and 428 relaxed conformation is applied at the level of the VP35 coiled-coil superhelix upon the 429 substitution of Ser-to-Ala at residue 129. 430\n\nWe further investigated the effect of S129A on VP35 oligomerization domain conformation by 431 computational modeling. Starting from the available WT crystal structure, a Ser-to-Ala 432 substitution was made and the oligomerization domain was subjected to energy minimization. 433\n\nThe resulting structure was then compared to WT ( Figure 3A and B). Conformation was 434 unaffected but did cause a loss of hydrogen bonds between Ser129 and the neighboring Ala125 435\n\n( Figure 3C ). The implicated biological effect may contribute to protein-protein interaction or 436 modulatory phosphorylation ( Figure 3D ). Taken together, these data indicate that VP35-S129A 437 has reduced capacity to oligomerize relative to VP35-WT and suggests a biological effect. 438\n\nTo assess a role of Ser129 in VP35 function, we examined IFN antagonist function, including 440 VP35 inhibition impact on the RIG-I-mediated signaling cascade and subsequent impairment of 441 the interferon stimulated-gene (ISG) expression. Using a luciferase reporter gene assay, we first 442 evaluated VP35-WT and VP35-S129A inhibition of dsRNA-induced RIG-I activation of the IFN-\u03b2 443\n\npromoter. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with pGL-IFN-\u03b2-luc, pRL-TK, and various 444 dilutions of a vector control, VP35-WT, or VP35-S129A. Twenty-four h post-transfection, cells 445\n\nwere stimulated with influenza A virus (IAV)-RNA. After 24 h, reporter activity was measured to 446 assess IFN inhibition. IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation was significantly inhibited by both VP35-WT 447 and VP35-S129A at comparable efficiencies ( Figure 4A ). Next, we tested the effect of VP35-WT 448\n\nand VP35-S129A on expression of ISGs upon stimulation by viral RNA or poly I:C. Using RT-449 qPCR, we analyzed gene expression of two well characterized ISGs, ISG15 and 2'-5'-450 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS 2'-5'). Expression of these ISGs induced by stimulation with 451 vRNA was significantly reduced by the presence of either VP35-WT or VP35-S129A, relative to 452 the vector control. Specifically, ISG15 expression was inhibited 87% by VP35-WT and 90% by 453 VP35-S129A, and OAS 2'-5' expression was inhibited 87% by VP35-WT and 95% by VP35-454 S129A ( Figure 4B) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/726935 doi: bioRxiv preprint Both VP35-WT and VP35-S129A were able to inhibit ISG56 protein expression, with levels 458\n\ncomparable to that of the non-stimulated vector control ( Figure 4C) . Collectively, the data show 459 that VP35-S129A retains IFN antagonist activity, indicating that VP35 Ser129 does not impact 460 IFN antagonist function. 461 VP35-S129A abrogates EBOV minigenome activity and interaction with L 1-505 462\n\nSince VP35 is an essential polymerase cofactor, we next evaluated the effect of VP35-S129A 463 on EBOV minigenome activity. Plasmids encoding EBOV minigenome assay components NP, 464 L, VP35, VP30 and the 3E5E-luciferase minigenome, along with Renilla luciferase to control for 465 transfection efficiency variability, were co-transfected in HeLa cells. Forty-eight h post-466 transfection, a dual-luciferase assay was used to measure reporter activity. Notably, the 467 presence of VP35-S129A nearly abolished minigenome activity relative to VP35-WT, with 468\n\nactivity level close to that of the no L control ( Figure 5A ). Additionally, representative lysates 469 from the minigenome assay were subjected to immunoblotting to confirm appropriate 470 expression of the WT and mutant ( Figure 5B ). While both VP35-WT and VP35-S129A 471\n\npredominantly expressed one major species of the same migration (~38 kD), other bands were 472\n\nobserved. Specifically, VP35-WT contained modest upper bands at ~45 kD and ~85 kD), 473\n\nwhereas VP35-S129A contained a modest lower band at ~35 kD. This may be representative of 474\n\ndifferential PTMs between VP35-WT and VP35-S129A, such as differing phosphorylation 475\n\nstates. Overall, these data suggest that Ser129 impacts VP35 transcription and replication 476 function. 477\n\nTo further investigate the role of Ser129 on VP35 replication function, we next examined 478\n\nwhether VP35-S129A retains the ability to interact with NP and L by co-IP experiments. HeLa VP35-S129A alone to keep total DNA amounts constant. After 24 h, proteins were harvested 484 and applied to IP using HA-tagged beads. After IP, WCLs and IP samples were subjected to 485 SDS-PAGE and products were analyzed by immunoblot. Both VP35-WT and VP35-S129A were 486 pulled down only in the presence of HA-NP, demonstrating specificity of interaction and 487\n\nindicating that VP35-S129A retains the ability to interact with NP ( Figure 5C ). Notably, VP35-488\n\nWT was pulled down with HA-L 1-505 whereas VP35-S129A was not, indicating that the 489 substitution of Ser129 to Ala results in the loss VP35-L interaction ( Figure 5D ). Collectively, 490\n\nthese data show that Ser-to-Ala substitution at residue 129 of VP35 abolishes minigenome 491 activity through loss of interaction between VP35-S129A and L but does not affect IFN 492\n\nantagonist function, effectively uncoupling IFN antagonist and replication functions. This is the 493 first report to suggest phosphorylation contributes a regulatory role in VP35 function and 494 presents a potential therapeutic target. 495\n\nThe most highly phosphorylated protein of NNSVs is generally the P protein, with 497 phosphorylation universally regarded as important to P protein function. While phosphorylation 498 has been shown to modulate the function of several NNSVs including VSV, RSV, CHPV, BDV, 499 RABV, RPV, MV, MuV, and NDV, evidence to support this is lacking for filoviruses 500 (Chattopadhyay and Banerjee, 1987, Barik and Banerjee, 1991, Barik and Banerjee, 1992a, 501\n\nBarik and Banerjee, 1992b, Gao combination of cell-biological, biochemical, and computational studies described here suggests 507 that phosphorylation plays a modulatory role in EBOV VP35 function, thus supporting 508 phosphorylation of the EBOV P protein as functionally significant. Specifically, we identify a 509\n\nhighly conserved Ser129 as a key regulatory residue, showing by Ala substitution that Ser129 is 510 important for VP35 replication function, but not IFN antagonist function. NanoDSF results 511\n\nindicate that the S129A mutant possesses a higher degree of flexibility at the level of the VP35 512 oligomerization domain, with secondary structure content analysis indicating that a more flexible 513\n\nand relaxed conformation is applied at the level of the VP35 coiled-coil superhelix. We further 514\n\nshow that while interactions with VP35-WT and NP remain intact, VP35-S129A exhibits 515\n\nimpaired ability to interact with the viral polymerase. . It has been shown that 523 VSV P protein must undergo phosphorylation-dependent homo-oligomerization to become 524 transcriptionally active (Gao and Lenard, 1995) . Consistent with these findings are the nanoDSF 525 results in this study which indicate that the VP35-S129A mutant possesses a higher degree of 526 flexibility at the level of the VP35 oligomerization domain, and severely decreases EBOV 527 minigenome activity. In addition, the oligomerization domain of MuV and hPIV3 P proteins has 528 been shown to have an enhancing effect on the P-L interaction, which further supports the 529 findings here (Choudhary et al., 2002 , Pickar et al., 2015 . 530 VP35 has been shown to be phosphorylated by IKK\u03b5 and TBK-1 in vitro, which suggests the 531 possibility that its function may be modulated by these kinases (Prins et al., 2009) . In this case 532 VP35 exerts IFN-antagonist function by preventing TBK-1 and/or IKK\u03b5 from activating 533 IRF3/IRF7. It has yet to be determined whether VP35 becomes phosphorylated in EBOV-534\n\ninfected cells, though, and whether that modulates its function. The extent to which VP35 is 535 phosphorylated by these kinases in EBOV-infected cells would be influenced by the extent to 536 which VP35 acts as a decoy substrate for IKK\u03b5 and TBK-1 relative to the extent VP35 merely 537\n\nprevents kinase activation via steric inhibition (Prins et al., 2009 ). Even so, in our study here the 538 VP35-S129A mutant impaired replication function but did not affect VP35 IFN antagonist 539 function. Given the high virulence of EBOV infection and the multifunctional nature of VP35, it 540 seems unlikely that VP35 phosphorylation by IKK\u03b5 and TBK-1 would detrimentally affect virus 541 .
