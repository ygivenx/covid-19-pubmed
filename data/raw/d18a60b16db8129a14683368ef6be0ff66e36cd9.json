{"title": "Modelling the skip-and-resurgence of Japanese encephalitis epidemics in Hong Kong", "body": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic and mosquitoborne virus that is the major cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. The annual total confirmed human cases has decreased substantially from 12,594 cases to 3429 cases between 2006 and 2012, and then resurged to 5399 in 2016 ( Fig. 1 ) . The case-fatality ratio and the rate of permanent neurologic or psychiatric sequelae of patients with encephalitis can be 30% ( Arai et al., 2008; Centers for Disease Control, 2017; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017; Libraty et al., 2002; Mackenzie et al., 2004; Solomon and Winter, 2004; World Health Organization, 2017 ; Lam et al., 2005 ) and over 35% in children ( Kumar et al., 1990 ) . JEV persists in a transmission cycle of pigs, Ardeid birds and mosquitoes. It could infect humans through mosquito bites by Culex tritaeniorhynchus species ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017; Center for Health Protection, 2017; World Health Organization, 2017 ) . Humans are dead-end hosts where they cannot develop viremia to infect mosquitoes. Population sizes of farm pigs and the size of rice land, which favors the Culex mosquitoes' growth, are the two key factors affecting local transmission ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017; Impoinvil et al., 2018; World Health Organization, 2017 ) . * Corresponding author.\n\nE-mail address: daihai.he@polyu.edu.hk (D. He).\n\nVertical transmission of JEV in mosquitoes and pig-to-pig transmission are the major determinants of the following year's transmission. Vertical transmission exists between mosquitoes and their e.g. Rosen et al. (1989 Rosen et al. ( , 1978 ; Takashima and Rosen (1989) . Mosquito population increases during spring, peaks in summer and decreases during fall annually ( Riley et al., 2007 ( Riley et al., , 2012 . According to a recent study by Ricklin et al., pig-to-pig transmission is also present ( Ricklin et al., 2016a ) .\n\nJEV transmission via blood transfusion has recently been found in Hong Kong, which was probably the first case worldwide. The transmission was reported to come from an asymptomatic viremic donor to two hospitalized patients ( South China Morning Post, 2017 ) .\n\nSero-prevalence of JEV antibodies varied by season among swines and among human population groups in Hong Kong. During rainy season between May and July, the sero-prevalence among swines reached 91% compared with 34% that is reported in dry season ( Scientific Committee on Vector-borne Diseases, 2017 ). It was approximately 80%-90% among swines in July and August from 20 0 0 to 20 04 ( Riley et al., 2007 ) . Another local serological survey found that 23.5% of pig farmers and 5.9% of abattoir workers are seropositive to JEV antibodies, in contrast to 0% reported among 30 blood donors ( Scientific Committee on Vector-borne Diseases, 2017 ) .\n\nJEV vaccine protection rates has been investigated. The vaccine was reported to have a high effective protection rate of 93.3% by five years and a predicted protection rate of 85.5% by 10 years ( Desai et al., 2012 ) . A recent study by Cao et al. investigated the current JEV vaccine derived from G3 JEV genotype against the emerging G5 genotype in mice, and found that the lethal challenge protection rate was 50%. The same study also reported that neutralizing antibodies against G5 JEV were detected in 35% of vaccinated healthy children ( Cao et al., 2016 ) . Riley et al. examined the skip-and-resurgence patterns of JEV from 1969 to 2004 in Hong Kong ( Riley et al., 2007 ) . They suggested that the skip from 1990 to 2002, except for one case reported in 1996, was likely due to the lack of rice production, as Culex species breed principally in rice fields ( Tian et al., 2015 ) . They proposed that the resurgence from 2003 to 2004 was likely due to the heightening of infectious disease notification system after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (i.e., SARS) outbreak in 2003 in Hong Kong ( Riley et al., 2007 ) .\n\nIn Hong Kong, no locally-acquired JEV case was reported between 2006 and 2010, but 17 cases were reported between 2011 and June, 2017. Considering the declining local live pig population from 350,0 0 0 to 60,0 0 0 between 20 04 and 2017 ( Hong Kong, 2017; Legislative Council of Hong Kong, 2017a; The Government of Hong Kong, Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, 2017a; 2017c ) , the disappearance of local JEV cases between 2006 and 2010 are expected, but the resurgence of local cases is intriguing.\n\nOur work aims to identify the mechanism underlying the JEV skip-and-resurgence patterns between December 2003 and May 2017 in Hong Kong. We hypothesized such behavior could be due to the surrendering of pig licenses during a pig rearing policy change in 2006 and/or a new JEV strain invasion around 2011. These hypotheses are tested using mathematical modelling and likelihood-based inference techniques.\n\nThe monthly JEV cases between December 2003 and May 2017 were retrieved online from the Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong ( Scientific Committee on Vector-borne Diseases, 2017; The Government of Hong Kong, Center for Health Protection, 2017 ). The regional monthly mosquito ovitrap index from December 2003 to December 2016 were retrieved online from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department in Hong Kong ( The Government of Hong Kong, Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, 2017 ) . The annual pattern of reported JEV cases and regional mosquito ovitrap index are shown in Fig. 2 . We present the time series of JEV cases and regional mosquito ovitrap index in Fig. 3 .\n\nThe population sizes of live pigs in Hong Kong ( Fig. 4 ) were obtained from local government reports, local news articles, and reports from Department of Agriculture in the United States ( Hong Kong, 2017; Legislative Council of Hong Kong, 2017a; Ta Kung Pao, 2017; The Government of Hong Kong, Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, 2017a; 2017c; FEHD, 2017a; United States Department of Agriculture, 2017 ) . Since the pig rearing license surrendering policy was implemented in May 2006, the number of local live pigs has rapidly declined. 243 out of 265 pig farms owners had surrendered their licenses ( Legislative Council of Hong Kong, 2017b ).\n\nRicklin et al. recently reported that pig-to-pig transmission of JEV can also occur without the mosquito vectors ( Ricklin et al., 2016a ) . After the infectious period in pigs where JEV in swine serum are infectious to mosquitoes, there is also a convalescent period in which pig sheds JEV virus in their oronasal secretions. Thus, the pig population could be classified into five compartments: susceptible, exposed, infectious, convalescent and recovered which are denoted as S p , E p , I p , C p and R p respectively. We considered pigto-pig transmission and vector-borne transmission. Fig. 5 shows the model diagram considering pigs, mosquitoes and humans. JEV transmission can be described by the following system of equations ( Eq. (1) ).\n\n(1) \n\nwhere N p is the observed live pig populations in Hong Kong and is a time-dependent parameter (see purple dashed line in Fig. 4 ) . B p ( t ) is the time-dependent birth rate of local live pigs. Humans are dead-end hosts and cannot further transmit the disease ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017; Impoinvil et al., 2018; World Health Organization, 2017 ), thus we model human cases using a variable spill-over ratio ( \u03c1) in week i \u03c1 i (see Eq.\n\n(2) ):\n\n(2) Please see S.2.2 for more reasoning on model structure.\n\nJEV cases were modelled as a Partially Observed Markov Process (POMP), also known as Hidden Markov model, using R pack- Table 1 Model input parameters. We denote JEV transmitted from vectors to pigs as \"v \u2192 p\", and from pigs to humans as \"p \u2192 h\" respectively. Please see S.2.1 for more information of the initial proportions. (2017) ; Konno (1969) ; Riley et al. (2007) age \"POMP \" ( King, 2017 ) . The iterated filtering and plug-and-play likelihood-based inference frameworks were employed to fit the time series He et al., 2010; King et al., 2016 ) . Furthermore, the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) was used to estimate the model parameters. To quantify the tradeoff between the goodness-of-fit of a model and its complexity ( Schwarz, 1978 ) , Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used for model comparison. Simulations were performed by implementing the Eulermultinomial integration method with a fixed time-step of one day ( Allen et al., 2008; He et al., 2010 ) . The model was first validated with the observed JEV cases in Hong Kong, based on information about the size of pig popula- tion. Mosquito abundance is a time-dependent parameter, which was smoothed over time based on the ovitrap index ( \u03c9). The force of infection ( \u03bb vp ) from vectors to reservoirs is another timedependent parameter. The spill-over ratio ( \u03c1) is estimated through \u03c9.\n\nThe monthly observed cases, C i , were assumed to follow a Poisson distribution (Poi), with a mean Z i , the underlying monthly cases modelled by Eq. (2) . Hence, we have:\n\nThus, the overall log-likelihood function, l , was given by:\n\nwhere denotes the parameter vector being estimated, f (C i | C 1:(i \u22121) , ) was the posterior probability measurement function for C i given C 1:(i \u22121) , which were then numerically computed by Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, also known as particle filtering) ( He et al., 2010 ) , and n denotes the total number of months during the study period. Using the profile likelihood method, the confidence intervals (C.I.) of the model output parameters were estimated based on the model input parameter ranges as described in Table 1 . Parameters estimation and statistical analyses are conducted using R (version 3.4.1) ( R, 2018 ) .\n\nWe can express \u03bb vp as \u03bb\n\nwhere a is the mosquito biting rate; \u03d1 vp is the transmission probability of JEV per mosquito bite; and I v is the number of infected mosquitoes. However, in this study, we simplify \u03bb vp as a function of ovitrap index over time, since we are employing a vector-free modelling framework. This is justifiable by assuming that a and \u03d1 vp are constant, while I v N p is roughly proportional to the ovitrap index. Briefly, we assume:\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the time series of ovitrap index in Hong Kong, k and b are model parameters under estimation. Constant b represents the contribution of the vertical transmission from adult mosquitoes to their eggs. The vertical transmission ratio of Culex tritaeniorhynchus is varied from 12% to nearly 100% Takashima and Rosen, 1989 ) . By using Eq. (3) , we also incorporate the case that despite the ovitrap index is close to zero during a dry season, the transmission rate can still be positive due to vertical transmission of vectors.\n\nTo investigate the mechanism of the observed resurgence of JEV after 2011 in Hong Kong, we partitioned the force of infection into time segments based on the hypothesis that the re-emergence was due to the invasion of a new JEV strain. This hypothesis is then validated using statistical approaches. We assume the force of infection ( \u03bb vp ) takes the following form:\n\nwhere T 0 is the time when the new JEV strain invaded.\n\nBiologically, the force of infection ( \u03bb vp ) under the new strain invasion scenario is higher than the no-invasion scenario, since the pig population is immunologically naive in the first few years after invasion. Thus, under the new-strain invasion hypothesis, we have k 2 > k 1 > 0. The average spill-over ratio \u03bb vp after invasion should be much higher than that before invasion. Without new strain invasion, we have the special case where k 1 = k 2 in Eq. (4) .\n\nIn Eq.\n\n(2) , we assume that humans are dead-end hosts ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017; Impoinvil et al., 2018; World Health Organization, 2017 ). Thus, the reported JEV human cases are proportional to pig infections according to the timedependent spill-over ratio( \u03c1). Since the number of human cases are related to the total number of vectors, we can further assume the spill-over ratio as a function of ovitrap index:\n\nwhere \u03be is the strength of infectivity parameter under estimation and \u03c4 is the sum of incubation period of mosquitoes (i.e. 6-12 days) ( Konno, 1969; Takashima and Rosen, 1989; Van den Hurk et al., 2009 ) , latent period in humans (i.e. 5-13 days) ( Centers for Disease Control, 2017; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017; Center for Health Protection, 2017 ) and case-reporting delay.\n\nFor simplicity, we fix \u03c4 to be 15 days for this study.\n\nTo investigate the mechanism of the observed resurgence of JEV after 2011 in Hong Kong, we partitioned the spill-over ratio into time segments based on the hypothesis that the re-emergence was due to the invasion of a new JEV strain. This hypothesis is then validated using statistical approaches. We assume the spill-over ratio ( \u03c1) takes the following form from Tien et al. (2010) :\n\nwhere T 0 is the time when the new JEV strain invaded.\n\nBiologically, the spill-over ratio ( \u03c1) under the new strain invasion scenario is much higher than the no-invasion scenario, since the pig population is immunologically naive in the first few years after invasion. Thus, under the new-strain invasion hypothesis, we have \u03be 2 > \u03be 1 > 0. The average spill-over ratio \u03c1 after invasion should be much higher than that before invasion. Without new strain invasion, we have the special case where \u03be 1 = \u03be 2 in Eq. (6) . \n\nBy averaging the above, we computed the average lifespan of pigs \u03bd \u22121 p to be approximately 234 days.\n\nGiven that the average local living pig consumption is 650 live pigs per day in 2007 ( Legislative Council of Hong Kong, 2017b ), we approximate the total number of pigs ( N p ) to be 234 \u00d7 650 = 152 , 100 . The sudden drop in the number of live pigs between 2006 and 2007 was due to the surrendering of pig rearing licenses in early 2006, which result in 243 out of 265 pig farm owners turning over their licenses ( Legislative Council of Hong Kong, 2017b ). Although the daily live pig consumption is not included as a modelling parameter, given the pig's average lifespan, we could infer the total number of live pigs from the amount of daily consumption.\n\n\u03b7 can be computed as: \n\nIn addition to the simulated median, we also present the simulated annual means of the model prediction using the approach described in Camacho et al. (2014) , since simulated means demonstrated fitting results more consistently when the data are being restricted as integers and are subject to stochastic noise.\n\nThe model fitting results under the new JEV strain invasion scenario are shown in Fig. 6 . The estimated model parameters are summarized in Table 2 . Although the long-term fitting suffers from severe stochastic noise (i.e. zero, one or two cases per month), the 95% simulated quantile interval covers all observed data, and the simulated average annual pattern is consistent with the observed pattern.\n\nBIC reduces more than 28 units when we went from the baseline (i.e. no invasion, see S.1.1) scenario to the new strain invasion scenario (see Fig. 6 and explanation I3 in Table 3 ). We modelled another new strain invasion scenario where only the force of infection \u03bb vp is partitioned (see explanation I2 in Table 3 and S.1.3).\n\nThe BIC increases approximately 1.0 unit which implies an almost equivalent fitting performance to the main results (see Fig. 6 and explanation I3 in Table 3 ). The partitioned force of infection with no partition on spill-over ratio is presented in S.1.3 (see explanation I2 in Table 3 ). Another invasion scenario with time-dependent \u03bb vp and \u03c1 are investigated in S.1.2 (see explanation I1 in Table 3 ) , and BIC increases 4.55 unit. The detailed model performance and explanation of are in Table 3 and Supplementary Information.\n\nUsing the next generation matrix method ( Brauer et al., 2016; Van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002 ) , the basic reproduction number, R pp , of pig-to-pig transmission is computed as:\n\nWe consider that imported infections are rare ( \u03b7 \u2248 0 + ), and both incubation period and infection period of JEV in pigs are negligible (i.e., \u03c3 \u22121 p \u2248 0 + and \u03b3 \u22121 p \u2248 0 + ). Then, it could be seen that R pp \u2248 \u03b2p \u03b4p + \u03bdp , which is consistent with the standard SIR compartmental model ( Allen et al., 2008 ) . We estimated R pp to be 0.0013 (95% C.I.: [0.00,0.31]) under the invasion scenario (see Fig. 7 ). Furthermore, the range of effective contact rate, Table 3 . (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Tables 1 and 2 ) is set corresponding to R pp \u2208 [0 . 0 , 1 . 0] . The range of R pp could be inferred as follows: JEV sero-positive rates among pigs quickly decreases in winter ( Riley et al., 2007 ) . Mosquito abundance is almost zero during the same time period. Thus, this indicates the vector-free transmission of JEV among pigs cannot persist. Therefore, R pp is less 1.0 and positive (i.e., greater than 0).\n\nThe critical community size (CCS) is defined as \"the minimum size of a closed population within which a host-to-host, non-zoonotic pathogen can persist indefinitely \" ( Bartlett, 1960 ) . N\u00e5sell (2005) presented a method of approximating the CCS from simple compart-mental models of directly-transmitted diseases. This is relevant to our study concerning pig-to-pig transmission. CCS can be formulated (obtained from Eq. (12.1) in N\u00e5sell, 2005 ) as:\n\nwhere \u03b1 p = \u03b3p + \u03bdp \u03bdp denotes the ratio of average lifespan of pigs ( \u03bd \u22121 p ) to the average duration of infection. The basic reproduction number of pig-to-pig transmission, R pp in Eq. (9) is relatively small compared to that of vector-borne transmission, R v p . A modelling study by Khan et al. estimated R v p to be 1.2 among pigs ( Khan et al., 2014 ) . Also, R v p is believed to be greater than 1.0, as JEV does spread during every rainy season. Applying the parameters under the new strain invasion scenario in Table 2 Table 3 . (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) (explanation I3 in Table 3 ) to Eq. (9) , R pp is merely 0.0013, which is much smaller than R v p . By using the next generation matrix approach ( Brauer et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2016 ) , the basic reproduction number is:\n\nIf we ignore the effects of R pp (i.e., R pp \u2248 0 + as in Gao et al., 2016 ) , we have R 0 \u2248 R v p . If we fix \u03bd \u22121 p = 234 . 0 (see Eq. (7) Moreover, for the invasion scenario, we found that the force of infection, \u03bb vp , could increase after the introduction of new JEV strain while assuming a fixed spill-over ratio, \u03c1. The fitting results of the partitioned force of infection, which did not partition on the spill-over ratio, are presented in the S.1.3 (see explanation I2\n\nin Table 3 ). The goodness-of-fit is almost equivalent to the previous scenario. We modelled the partitioned \u03bb vp and \u03c1 scenario in S.1.2 (see explanation I1 in Table 3 ). Although the fitting results are not as good as in the invasion scenario,(i.e. the main results in Fig. 6 and explanation I3 in Table 3 ) , it is still a significant improvement from the baseline (no invasion) scenario. The estimated force of infection, \u03bb vp , also increases after introducing a new JEV strain (see S.1.2 and explanation I1 in Table 3 ). With an increased R 0 due to an increased \u03bb vp , the CCS level could become lower than the local live pig's population level (see Fig. 8 ), which explains the resurgence of JEV cases. Further discussion on R 0 and CCS can be found in S.2.3\n\nIn this study, we argue that the resurgence of JEV after 2011 was likely due to new strain invasion that has a higher transmissibility. some indirect overseas evidence does exist: (i) JEV genotype 1 (G1) strain since 20 0 0: In Southeast Asia, studies reported that Genotype 3 was predominant during the late 20th century, and then genotype 1 started to replace genotype 3 around 20 0 0 and become dominant thereafter ( Gao et al., 2015; Mackenzie et al., 2004; Pan et al., 2011 ) . One genetic study found that the genotype 1 strain was not observed until 2008 in the regions of Mainland China surrounding Hong Kong ( Gao et al., 2013 ) . Thus, it is very likely that there is a newly introduced JEV strain from pigs imported from these Mainland Chinese regions ( The Government of Hong Kong, Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, 2017b ); (ii) JEV genotype 5 (G5) strain: Similar JEV resurgences were observed in South Korea in 1998 and 2010 ( Sunwoo et al., 2016 ) . The resurgence in 1998 was likely due to the introduction of G1 strain in the mid-1990's ( Gao et al., 2013; Mackenzie et al., 2004 ) . The first isolated local G5 strain was reported in 2010 in South Korea, which coincided with the resurgence of JEV in 2010 ( Takhampunya et al., 2011 ) , where the average number of annual JEV cases increased approximately six-to eight-fold ( Sunwoo et al., 2016 ) . This is also consistent with our results of explanation I1 and I3 in Table 3 .\n\nWe achieved almost equivalent goodness-of-fit under the two invasion scenarios. There are three potential explanations for the JEV resurgence since 2011: ( I1 ) The newly introduced JEV strain has slightly increased the transmissibility from vectors to pigs, and considerably increased the spill-over ratio from pigs to humans; ( I2 ) The newly introduced JEV strain has considerably increased the transmissibility, but the spill-over ratio is held constant; ( I3 ) The main results: the newly introduced JEV strain has increased both the transmissibility and the spill-over ratio. Please also see the summary of I1 -I3 in Table 3 .\n\nThe symptomatic ratio of JEV could be further used to refine the mathematical model. As the majority of JEV infections are asymptomatic, and the mortality ratio for clinical JEV cases are approximately 30% ( Table 4 ) . We assume the symptomatic ratio of JEV among pigs are the same as that of humans, and asymptomatic pigs have negligible JEV transmissibility to vectors due to low within-host viral loads.\n\nOur main results are derived from I3 ( Fig. 6 ) . In Table 2 Basic Reproduction Number In I1 , we assumed the force of infection (i.e., \u03bb vp ) unchanged but only change the value of spill-over rate before/after the new JEV invasion. However, with the force of infection in I1 , the JEV epidemic is unlike to maintain according to the estimation results of CCS (i.e., in this case, the pig population is lower than the CCS). On the contrary, with increased force of infection in I3 , the JEV epidemic is very likely to come back (i.e., resurgent) since 2011. Further work is needed in order to identify the biological evidences and mechanisms of I3 . In this work, we only investigated the scenarios of new JEV invasion, more possible causes (or scenarios) due to various other factors can be further explored.\n\nWe developed a simple mathematical model to investigate the mechanisms behind the skip-and-resurgence patterns of JEV human cases in Hong Kong. The critical community size (CCS) estimated through the model indicates that the pig rearing license surrender policy on May 2006 could be responsible for the disappearance of JEV human during 2006-10, assuming that other factors remain unchanged. Compared with the results of baseline (no invasion) scenario (see S.1.1), our fitting results in the hypothetical scenario imply that the resurgence of JEV in 2011 was likely due to the introduction of new strains which has a higher transmissibility and/or a spill-over ratio.\n\nThe basic reproduction number ( R pp ) of pig-to-pig transmission is estimated to be 0.0013 (95% C.I.: [0.00,0.30]). Although the vector-free JEV transmission route exists ( Ricklin et al., 2016a ) and it could increase the epidemic size and prolongs the outbreak, JEV is unable to spread among pigs without vectors.\n\nThus vector control remains the most important and effective measure in mitigating JEV outbreaks in Hong Kong. Apparently, the reduction in local farm pig did not lead to elimination of JEV in Hong Kong. But monitoring JEV among pigs is still very important. This work shed light on the understanding of JEV epidemic in the other parts of Asia."}
