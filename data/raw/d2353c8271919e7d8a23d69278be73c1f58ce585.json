{"title": "Serology characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection since the exposure and post symptoms onset", "body": "In the early December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported to cause lethality pneumonia in human and person-to-person transmission had been demonstrated soon in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, China. [1] The virus rapidly spread through China and then many other countries globally. Up to March 17, 2020 , the virus had resulted in over 190,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 and more than 7800 deaths in 163 countries. [2] The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared Covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern and given a \"very high\" risk assessment on global level. [3] A recent report from China showed that the median incubation period of Covid-19 infection was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). [4] Fever, cough and fatigue are the most common symptoms. [1] Severe cases could rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. The abnormalities on chest computed tomography, particularly the ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing, were found in over 80% of patients. [5] Over 80% of patients had lymphopenia, and about 60% of patients had elevated C-reactive protein. Currently, the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection almost solely depends on the All rights reserved.

[8] Unfortunately, the sensitivity of RNA test in the real-world is not satisfied, particularly when sample collected from upper respiratory tract is used. [9] [10] [11] [12] In Wuhan, the overall positive rate of RNA testing is estimated to be around 30-50% in Covid-19 patients when they come to hospital.\n\n[13] Furthermore, the overall throughput of available RNA tests are highly limited by their nature of requiring high workload, needing skillful operators for testing and sample collection, and needing costly instrument and special operate places. [14] As a result, a convenient serological detection is expected to be helpful. However, current knowledge of the antibody response to SAR-CoV-2 infection is very limited. The diagnosis value of antibody test remains to be clearly demonstrated. How many patients would raise antibody response and how long will the antibody convert to be positive since the exposure?\n\nAre there any meaningful differences between patients with short and long incubation period? What are the sensitivities of antibody detection for patients in different illness stages? Is there any temporal association between the antibody response and the decline of viral load? In order to answer some of the questions, we investigated the characteristics of antibody responses in 80 Covid-19 patients during their hospitalization periods, through detecting total antibody, IgM and IgG using immunoassays.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The degree of severity of patient was categorized as critical case if any of the bellowed clinical scenes appeared: 1) with ARDS or oxygen saturation < 93% and needing mechanical ventilation either invasively or non-invasively; 2) shock; and 3) complication of organ functional failure and need intensive care unit support. A Covid-19 patient did not meet the above criteria was defined as non-critical case.\n\nThis study enrolls a total of 80 cases of COVID-19, where all patients were admitted to the hospital between Jan 19 and Feb 9, 2020, and were willing to donate their blood samples. All enrolled cases were confirmed to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 through real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) testing. The date of illness onset, clinical classification, RNA testing results during the hospitalization period, and the personal demographic information were obtained from the clinical records. A total of 300 healthy people were enrolled from the local community. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the first affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University (approval number 2020-IIT-47).

The median age of patients was 55 years (IQR, 45-64 years) and 38.7% were females. The critical patients were significantly older than non-critical patients (p<0.001). The time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure before onset in 45 patients (15 were critical cases) had been determined according to the unambiguous close contact with a confirmed Covid-19\n\npatients through the epidemiological inspection when admission to hospital. The incubation period was ranged from 0 to 23 days with a median of 5 days (IQR, 2 -10 days). By February 15, a total of 32 patients (40%, all were non-critical cases) were recovered and discharged from hospital and none died.\n\nA total of 80 Covid-19 patients and 100 to 300 healthy people were tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using different immunoassays. The seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG in patients was 98.8% (79/80), 93.8% (75/80) and 93.8%\n\n(75/80), respectively ( Table 2 ). The last blood sample of the only patient who had not seroconverted was collected on the 7 days post onset (d.p.o). For Ab, IgM and IgG test, the performance of ELISAs seems the best, although the differences are generally not significant. Therefore, the following serological analyses were all based on the results of ELISAs unless specifically noted.\n\nThe seroconversion was sequential appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median All rights reserved.

There was no significant difference on age, viral load in the early stage of illness and the risk of critical status between the groups. However, the median seroconversion time was shorter for the short incubation period group than for the long incubation period group (13d.p.e v.s. 21d.p.e, p<0.001). In contrast, the median seroconversion day post onset was longer for the short incubation period group than the long incubation period\n\nThe present study showed that near all (98.8%, 79/80) Covid-19 patients converted to be seropositive during the illness course. Seroconversion was first observed on 7d.p.e (2d.p.o). The first detectible antibody is total antibody and followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15d.p.e (9d.p.o), 18d.p.e (10d.p.o) and 20d.p.e (12d.p.o). It is very similar as that observed in SARS-CoV-1 infection. [16, 17] Interestingly, the rising of antibody levels accompanied with the decline of viral load.\n\nCurrently, the quarantine period is set as 14 days since close contacting with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection case. The proportion of infection could not be screened out through RNA test during the quarantine period remains unknown.\n\nHowever, it had been documented that some close contactors presented symptoms and causing transmission after de-isolation [18] . It is believed that antibody test might improve the sensitivity to find infections, but the evidence had not been shown before. All rights reserved.

It indicated that about half of the carriers could be screened out if antibody were tested before de-isolation.

Another reason for the relatively high RNA positive rate in our study is that we used the deep sputum sample for RNA test, in contrast to the more convenient and popular throat/nasal swabs in many other hospitals. It suggests that the lower respiratory samples such as deep sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage might be more reliable for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.\n\nSimilar as the RNA test, the negative antibody finding in the early stage of illness could not exclude the possibility of infection. Our study showed that the seroconversion rate on 7d.p.o reached 64.1% and then increased to over 90% in the next week. The relative long window period of seroconversion indicates that, for searching previously exposed patients or subclinical carriers, the specific serology should not replace RNA detection but could be an important complement.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that near all patients will convert to antibody positive and the titer increased rapidly underlines the usage of antibody test in confirming or excluding diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection if the convalescent sample were tested. 1 5 The present data showed that the sensitivity of total antibody detection was higher than that of IgM and IgG (p<0.001) while the specificities are overall comparable when In our study, antibody tests based on ELISA, CMIA and LFIA were validated and showed good performance overall.
