{"title": "A model of bi-mode transmission dynamics of hepatitis C with optimal control", "body": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the common cause of liver diseases worldwide and a major public health problem (Bisceglie 1998). The disease hepatitis C was first recognized in 1975 and the causative agent HCV was identified in 1989. Hepatitis C is characterized by an acute, often asymptomatic stage, followed in most cases by chronic infection that can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. HCV, which causes hepatitis C in humans, is a small, enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. Replication of the RNA-based virus involves the use of the enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that has a high error rate. Consequently, the virus mutates very rapidly and has no single genotype. Currently, there are seven known genotypes of HCV (Jawaid and Khuwaja 2008; Torresi et al. 2011). According to World Health Organization, nearly 3 % of the world population has been infected with HCV. An estimated 170 million people globally are infected with chronic HCV and are at risk of developing liver cancer/cirrhosis, while nearly 350,000 people die worldwide as a result of hepatitis C-related liver diseases each year (Waheed et al. 2009; Jiwani and Gul 2011).\n\nHepatitis C is characterized by an acute and a chronic stage. Initial infection by HCV results in acute hepatitis C, which is largely asymptomatic. Only about 15 % of cases display mild symptoms such as decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, muscle or joint pains, and weight loss. The infection resolves spontaneously in 20% of the cases. About 80% of the people exposed to HCV, however, eventually develop a chronic infection, thus progressing to the chronic stage of the disease. This stage can last for decades. Most people experience minimal or no symptoms during the initial few years of the infection. After several years of living with the disease hepatitis C becomes the primary cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Nearly 5\u201320 % of chronic hepatitis C patients develop cirrhosis over 30 years and 1\u20135 % die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. Those who develop cirrhosis have a 20-fold greater risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, a rate of 13 % per year. It is estimated that hepatitis C is the cause of 27 % of cirrhosis cases and 25 % of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide (Bisceglie et al. 1991; Fattovich 1997; Kiyosawa 1990; Hutin 2004).\n\nThe standard treatment of infected individuals comprises a combination of pegylated interferon alpha (Peg IFN-\u03b1) and the potent antiviral drug Ribavirin for a period of 24 or 48 weeks, depending on the HCV genotype (Jawaid and Khuwaja 2008). The response to treatment also varies by genotype and ranges from 70\u201380 % for genotypes 2 and 3 to almost non-existent for genotype 6. Also, recent treatment advances of genotype 1 infection using directly acting antiviral agents are encouraging; there is still a need to develop an effective vaccination strategy capable of preventing infection. The vaccines used in clinical and pre-clinical trials include recombinant proteins, DNA-based proteins, synthetic peptide vaccines, etc. The implementation and success of the above-mentioned vaccines along with future designs of vaccine strategies have been discussed in detail by Toressi et al. (2011). Furthermore, the high cost of the therapy results in low clinical usage. In USA, the median HCV health care expenditure of Interferon therapy exceeds \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\$ 2470$$\\end{document}$2470 (Armstrong and Charland 2004). Recovery from infection with HCV does not result in long-term immunity. Therefore, any model for hepatitis C must reflect this lack of acquired immunity by allowing recovered individuals to become susceptible again.\n\nHCV is primarily spread by blood-to-blood contact through blood transfusions, the use of poorly sterilized medical equipment and intravenous drug use (IDU). Screening at blood transfusion has resulted in a significant decline in HCV transmission, especially in the developed world. However there are countries lacking resources where screening costs have posed a hinderance to blood screening for HCV (Alter 2007). The primary route of transmission in the developed world is IDU, while in the developing world HCV is predominantly spread through unsafe blood transfusions and therapeutic procedures (Maheshwari and Thuluvath 2009). The HCV prevalence among IDUs is greater than HIV [67, 72.5 and 73.4 % among the IDUs in China, Russia and the USA, respectively (Nelson et al. 2011)]. The World Health Organization declares IDUs as an important target group for HCV treatment and prevention (Nelson et al. 2011). Among IDUs in USA and Europe, transmissions occur via sharing injection equipments such as syringes, needles and other paraphernalia (Mathei et al. 2006). Both modes of HCV transmission (unsafe blood transfusion and IDUs) are significant for certain communities [studies indicate prevalence percentages of 48.67 \u00b1 1.75 % and 57 \u00b1 17.7 %, respectively, in Pakistan (Waheed et al. 2009) see also Ali et al. (2009)].\n\nDeveloping countries of South Asia (especially Pakistan) have high HCV prevalence rates. Pakistan is a highly populated, developing country with low health and education standards and therefore the population is particularly vulnerable to infection with the hepatitis C virus. In Pakistan 10 million people are presumed to be infected with HCV. Percentage prevalence of HCV in the adult population of Pakistan is estimated to be about 4.95 \u00b1 0.53 % (Waheed et al. 2009). It was estimated that there were about 5 million drug users in Pakistan, out of which 15 % were regular IDUs. In contrast to the US, where the majority of HCV infections are caused by genotype 1 of HCV, an overwhelming majority of hepatitis C patients in Pakistan are infected with genotype 3a of the virus. In 2004, a panel of gastroenterologists reported that 75\u201390 % of HCV patients in Pakistan had genotype 3a (Waheed et al. 2009; Jiwani and Gul 2011). The therapy of the genotype 3a HCV is more expensive than other genotypes of the virus which poses a great threat of affordability in a developing country such as Pakistan.\n\nOther HCV transmission modes, though less efficient (and not included in the current model), include occupational exposures where HCV prevalence among healthcare workers is roughly 1\u20132 % (Alter 2007) [about 5.2 \u00b1 0.63 % in Pakistan (Waheed et al. 2009)] with an average transmission rate of 0.5 % to patients (Alter 2007); perinatal exposure with a transmission rate of 4\u20137 % per pregnancy (Alter 2007), which increases with HIV co-infection; sexual exposure, where the transmission rate is controversial with inconsistent results reported by various studies (Alter 2007). However the risk increases with unsafe, high risk sex practices, multiple sex partners, etc. as this increases the probability of a sexual relationship with an HCV positive partner (Alter 2007). Other human activities, least rarely associated with HCV transmission, include percutaneous exposure to blood such as during tattooing, body-piercing, intranasal drug use, and acupuncture (Alter 2007).\n\nSeveral studies on modeling epidemics in populations already exist (Hutin 2004; Dontwi et al. 2010) and they are pertinent to our work. Most of these papers classify individuals in the population into different states and then formulate a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) to analyze the time evolution of each of these population states. Reade et al. (1998) has discussed an ODE model of infections with acute and chronic stages. Similarly, Luo and Xiang (2012) analyzed a four state system with exposed, acute and chronic states. Suna et al. (2012) has analyzed an SEIRS model where it was assumed that recovered individuals lose their infection-acquired immunity. Martcheva and Castillo-Chavez (2003) have formulated a model for hepatitis C lacking an exposed class and have discussed the stability of the equilibrium states. Dontwi et al. (2010) considered the transmission of hepatitis C through IDUs in an acute, chronic and recovered model. Other deterministic models pertinent to our work have also been proposed and analysed (Busenberg and Hadeler (1990);  Esteva and Vargas (1999); Hadeler and Castillo-Chavez (1995); Hethcote and Thieme (1985); and Hethcote et al. (2002)).\n\nWe present a deterministic model with two distinct susceptible population groups comprising IDUs and those getting blood transfusion (unsafe needles in healthcare setting etc.), respectively. So we are considering the transmission of hepatitis C among these two population groups (representing two distinctive modes of transmission). Individuals in each group are classified as susceptible, acute, chronic, quarantined and recovered. The acute and chronic states represent the individuals in the acute and chronic stage of the infections, respectively. The quarantine state represents the chronically infected individuals getting quarantined. The isolation of those with disease symptoms is among the first infection control measures ever recorded (Hethcote 2000). Over the course of time, quarantine strategy has been used to combat the spread of many emerging and re-emerging human diseases such as leprosy, plague, cholera, typhus, yellow fever, smallpox, diphtheria, tuberculosis, measles, Ebola, pandemic influenza and, more recently, SARS (Chowell et al. 2004; Yan et al. 2007; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2003). Luo and Xiang (2012) has performed a global analysis of a four-state \u2018susceptible\u2019, \u2018exposed\u2019, \u2018acute\u2019 and \u2018chronic\u2019 model and proven certain theorems regarding the stability of the steady states of the model. However, almost no analysis of the effects of a quarantine class on a disease with a chronic stage has been done and therefore, our paper will be one of the first attempts to study the effect of quarantine (education campaigns, self quarantine etc.) on the spread of a disease with a chronic stage. It should be pointed out that quarantine or isolation here is not being considered in the traditional sense. Quarantine involves only the isolation of individuals who have been exposed to the disease. Since hepatitis C is largely asymptomatic, and chronically infected individuals can live for years without being identified, a quarantine class can be used to consider individuals who have been clearly identified as being infected with HCV. Such individuals can then undergo treatment for HCV and take extra precautions while interacting with the people around them (self quarantine). The notion of quarantine introduced also includes the educational campaigns to spread awareness about HCV, its transmission modes and how to proceed if infection is identified, free supply of needle to intravenous drug users. Such quarantine strategy can potentially play a significant role in hepatitis C control by decreasing the effective contact rate.\n\nSection 2 of the paper presents the mathematical formulation of the model, its basic important properties and the analysis of a reduced model (of one mode, as the dynamics of the two modes are identical). Section 3 includes the rigorous mathematical analysis of the full model. The effect of using quarantine on population is discussed using a threshold quantity along with sensitivity and uncertainty analyses presented with simulations to investigate the dependence of the reproduction number on some crucial parameters. In Sect. 4, we design an optimal control strategy and numerically solve the optimality system to illustrate the effects of an optimal control strategy. Finally Sect. 5 presents the conclusions drawn from the analysis.\n\n\nThe variables of the model (1) are non-negative for all time\nt > 0. In other words, solutions of the model (1) with positive initial data will remain positive for all\nt > 0.\n\nProof is presented in the \u201cAppendix\u201d.\n\n\nThe closed set\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{aligned} D &= \\left\\{(S_1, A_1, C_1, Q_1, R_1, S_2, A_2, C_2, Q_2, R_2) \\in R_+^{10}\\right.\\\\ &\\quad :S_1+A_1+C_1+Q_1+R_1+S_2+ A_2+C_2+Q_2 \\\\ &\\quad\\left.+R_2 \\leq {\\frac{\\Uppi}{\\mu}}, {\\rm where}\\ \\Uppi = \\Uppi_1 + \\Uppi_2\\right\\} \\end{aligned}$$\\end{document}D=(S1,A1,C1,Q1,R1,S2,A2,C2,Q2,R2)\u2208R+10:S1+A1+C1+Q1+R1+S2+A2+C2+Q2+R2\u2264\u03a0\u03bc,where\u03a0=\u03a01+\u03a02\nis positively invariant and attracting.\n\nIf we add all the equations of the above model (1) we will have,\n2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{{\\rm d}N}{{\\rm d}t}&= \\Uppi - \\mu N - (\\delta_a A_1+ \\delta_cC_1 + \\delta_q Q_1+ \\delta_a A_2 \\\\ &\\quad+ \\delta_cC_2 + \\delta_q Q_2) \\leq \\Uppi - \\mu N \\end{aligned}$$\\end{document}dNdt=\u03a0-\u03bcN-(\u03b4aA1+\u03b4cC1+\u03b4qQ1+\u03b4aA2+\u03b4cC2+\u03b4qQ2)\u2264\u03a0-\u03bcNSince N(t) \u2265 0, a standard comparison theorem can be used to show that \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$N(t) \\leq N(0)e^{-\\mu t} + { {\\Uppi}\\over {\\mu}}(1-e^{-\\mu t}).$$\\end{document}N(t)\u2264N(0)e-\u03bct+\u03a0\u03bc(1-e-\u03bct).

To ensure that the disease elimination is independent of the initial sizes of sub-populations, it is necessary to show that the DFE is globally asymptotically stable if R\nc < 1. This is explored below. Since R\nc is calculated with \u03b8\n21 = 0, we continue with this assumption.\n\n\nThe disease-free equilibrium DFE of the model (1), given by (4) is globally asymptotically stable whenever\nR\nc < 1.\n\nThe epidemiological implication of the above result is that the disease can be eliminated from the population if the basic reproduction number R\nc can be brought down to (and maintained at) a value less than unity (that is, the condition R\nc < 1 is sufficient and necessary for disease elimination). Figure 2 depicts numerical results by simulating the model (1) using various initial conditions with R\nc < 1. It is evident from the simulation that all solutions converge to DFE, \u21350, in line with Theorem 2.

Solving the optimality system (9), using an iterative method, will result in the optimal quarantine strategy. First solve the state equations with a guess for the control pair (\u03b1\n1(t), \u03b1\n2(t)) over the simulated time using a forward fourth order Runge\u2013Kutta scheme. The adjoint functions have final time conditions. Because of this transversality conditions on the adjoint functions (9), the adjoint equations are then solved by a backward fourth order Runge\u2013Kutta scheme using the current iteration solution of the state equations. Then, the controls are updated using a convex combination of the previous control and the value from the characterizations (8). This process is repeated and iteration is stopped if the values are converging.\n\nNumerical solutions to the optimal system (9) are carried out using MATLAB and are presented here. The parameter values are used from Table 2 and the initial conditions are given in the \u201cAppendix\u201d. The parameter values used have R\nc > 1 when the model without time dependent control is considered. Thus, the disease is not expected to die out without intervention strategies.\n\nFigure 7 represents the optimal quarantine strategy to be employed to minimize the cost and the infected population. Considering the practical constraints, an upper bound of 0.5 was chosen for the optimal quarantine control pair (\u03b1\n1(t), \u03b1\n2(t)).The optimal control \u03b1\n1 is at its upper bound value at the start of time before reaching the minimum value at a slower rate. On the other hand, \u03b1\n2 is at the maximum value initially and then it sharply decreases before getting to the minimum value of 0. In fact, at the beginning of simulated time, the optimal controls are staying at the upper bound to quarantine as many chronically infected individuals as possible to prevent the infected population from increasing. The steadily decreasing of the control pairs is determined by the balance between the cost of the infected individuals and the cost of the control facilities. Also the assumption of \u03b8\n21 = 0 appears to be reasonable as a positive value of \u03b8\n21 does not change the optimal control strategy.\n\n\nFigure 8a shows the total infected population for the optimal control and constant control l. It is clear that with the use of an optimal control strategy disease epidemic can be prevented and disease remains under control at all times. Figure 9 shows the cost associated with the optimal and constant control strategy. It is clear the costs of optimal strategy are much less than the cost of relatively low (but practically feasible) constant control and in fact differ by order of magnitude of tens. It is important to note that high constant quarantine rate (\u03b1\n1,\u03b1\n2 = 0.4) incurs almost the same cost as of optimal control. However, practically it is highly unlikely to implement these high constant controls primarily due to the lack of required resources and facilities.\n\n\n\nFigure 10 captures the effect of change in effective contact rate over the optimal control strategy. It is clear from the simulation that an increase in the contact rate will lead to higher rates of quarantine. This result is in line with the sensitivity analysis where it was shown that contact rate \u03b2\n1 have a positive correlation with R\nc (which determines the disease prevalence).\n\n\nIn this paper we have discussed an ODE-based deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of the Hep C virus. The main contributions of this work are the inclusion of two distinct susceptible population groups; individuals associated with the unsafe blood transfusions and intravenous drug users (IDUs) along with looking at the effects of quarantine on the dynamics. The two different susceptible groups were considered as these are the major transmission pathways for Hep C, in developing countries such as Pakistan. Further in the absence of an effective vaccine against all known genotypes of hepatitis C formulating optimal quarantine strategies would provide insight to public health officials.\n\nDynamical system techniques were used to analyze the model. We observed the following points The disease-free equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable whenever the basic reproduction number R\nc is less than unity;The disease persists uniformly if and only if R\nc > 1, in which case the model has an endemic equilibrium;The infected population corresponding to the mode (blood transfusions or IDUs) with the higher basic reproduction number surely persists;\n\n\nTo ascertain the relative importance of various parameters, sensitivity analysis was performed, this would help epidemiologists and public health officials to focus on the more important parameters in formulating a disease control policy. Our analysis led to the following observations The model is most sensitive to the control variables \u03b1\ni (proportion of infected population being quarantined), \u03b2\ni (effective contact rate) and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\zeta_i$$\\end{document}\u03b6i (relative infectiousness of quarantined individuals);Given the nature of the disease, controlling quarantine parameter (i.e. devising an effective quarantine strategy) seems to the most workable solution;Quarantining of the chronically infected individuals has a positive population-level impact if a certain condition is met;\n\n\nFinally we considered control strategies to prevent the spread of the disease. In our analysis we assumed a quadratic cost function due to obvious non linearity of the cost as briefly discussed in the optimal control section, and the fact that convexity of the function allows one to apply established results from optimal control theory, as has been done in similar work in the literature. Using techniques from optimal control theory we concluded that An optimal control (rather than a high constant control) is preferable, where quarantining rate of chronically infected individuals is a function of time. That is, the proportion that is quarantined optimally with respect to time has a higher favorable impact (as compared to implementing a high but constant quarantine rate) in keeping the cost of disease control low.However, it should be pointed out that the ideal time-varying optimal strategy might not be applied easily. Still, it does provide a basis on which to design practical quasi-optimal control strategies\n\n\nThere are several directions in which to extend the present work, we outline some of these here. In our analysis we took the modification parameter for cross infectiousness, \u03b8\n21 = 0, this was justified as the numerics showed no qualitative difference between the zero and non-zero \u03b8\n21 case. It would be interesting to analytically verify this numerical observation. We considered two modes of transmission of the disease, one can also look at a third important mode of transmission, the spread of virus via facilities such as the dentists or barber shops. Finally an interesting extension of this work would be looking at a Markov Chain based stochastic model, involving the two transmission pathways.\n\nWhile early diagnosis and treatment of HCV might be able to reduce the progression of disease, the majority of infected individuals are asymptomatic and most infected persons are unaware of their exposure to the virus. Increase in the public awareness of HCV can play a significant role in increasing the recovery from acute and chronic stages of the disease. Therapy along with an effective quarantine strategy can greatly reduce the prevalence of hepatitis C."}
