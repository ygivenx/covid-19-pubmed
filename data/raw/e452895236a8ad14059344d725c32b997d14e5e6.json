{"title": "TRAVEL AND ANIMAL CONTACT", "body": "\u2022 Consider recent foreign travel in human beings or other animals as a risk factor for unexplained cases or outbreaks of infectious disease in the community. \u2022 Collaborate with agriculture officials on the regulation of animal movement of public health importance.\n\n\u2022 When providing pretravel screening and counseling, inquire about whether the person is traveling with pets and provide counseling about health risks from animal contacts while traveling. See the CDC's \"Your Survival Guide to Safe and Healthy Travel,\" available online at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/contentSurvival Guide.aspx. \u2022 If a patient is planning to travel with a pet, advise him or her to consult a veterinarian for pretravel risk assessment and preventive care. \u2022 When evaluating the returning traveler with illness, inquire about animal contacts as well as the health of any pets that have accompanied the traveler or that the traveler has acquired overseas.\n\n\u2022 Provide appropriate pretravel risk assessment and vaccination of pets and documentation of animal health status. \u2022 Counsel owner about signs of illness to monitor in his or her pet and quarantine regulations. \u2022 In the evaluation of an ill animal after travel, consider risks of imported diseases. \u2022 Advise clients regarding the health risks of adopting a pet overseas (e.g., documented cases of rabies, leishmaniasis, and leptospirosis have been reported in imported pets).\n\nTravel medicine is a medical discipline that deals with prevention of infectious diseases during international travel as well as the personal safety of travelers and the avoidance of environmental risks during travel. 3 Medical providers who care for human beings traveling to other countries need to be aware of the principles of travel medicine and be able to perform the functions of pretravel risk assessment and 10 Peter M. Rabinowitz and Lisa A. Conti\n\npreventive counseling, vaccination, and posttravel evaluation of illness. A complete discussion of the many travel-related health risks is beyond the scope of this book. However, Table  10 -1 shows the key elements of travel medicine practice. Veterinary providers who care for animals that are either traveling internationally or arriving from another country also need to be aware of the principles of travel medicine and be able to perform similar functions of pretravel risk assessment and counseling, vaccination, and posttravel assessment on animals.\n\nIn a pretravel risk assessment, clinicians consider both the medical status of the traveler as well as the infectious and other environmental risks related to the countries they plan to visit and the activities they plan to undertake (see Table 10 -1). Risks of travel-related animal contact may be overlooked during such visits. Table 10-2 summarizes these risks and provides the basics of counseling on risk reduction for particular animal contact situations.\n\nAnimal bites and other animal-related injuries can be a significant hazard during travel (Color Plate 10-1). Although an attack from a wild animal, including snakes, crocodiles, large felids, and elephants, can cause dramatic injuries, falls from horseback or attacks by bulls or other large domestic animals can also maim and kill (Figures 10-1 and 10-2; Color Plates 10-2 and 10-3). A review of animal-associated injuries reported to the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network found that dog bites were the most common animal-associated injury to travelers, followed by bites from monkeys and cats. Threequarters of the exposures occurred in countries where rabies is endemic, with the majority occurring in Asia. Fifty percent of bitten travelers had a travel duration of 1 month or less, and traveling for tourism was associated with an increased risk of an animal injury. Males were more likely to receive a dog bite, whereas monkey exposures were more common for females. Children were also at increased risk of exposure. 4 Despite the risk of rabies from such exposures (fatal cases of human rabies have occurred in U.S. travelers from dog bites received during international travel 5 ), a study of returning travelers with animal injuries found that most had not had pretravel rabies vaccine 6 and two thirds of persons with injuries did not receive postexposure prophylaxis (which may not be routinely available in some countries). Rabies vaccine should be considered for all travel to rabies-endemic countries, especially for children, although a minimum travel duration of 6 weeks in an endemic area is recommended by some experts as an indication for vaccine. The strength of that recommendation should be influenced by the availability of medical care and rabies immunization products locally.\n\nOther reported diseases related to bite and scratch exposures in travelers include bacterial infection from Pasteurella or other agents, rat-bite fever from rodents (see Animal and Human Bites below), and Bartonella infection from cats, the most common animal-associated infection reported in the GeoSentinel study.\n\nExposure to nonhuman primates can occur during travel; monkey temples are a popular tourist site in Asia. Simian foamy virus infection has been reported in a visitor to a monkey temple. 7 Bites from Old World monkeys also carry a risk of herpes B infection that can cause fatal disease in human beings (see Animal and Human Bites later in this chapter). Herpes B infections in human beings have been mostly observed in occupational settings (see Chapter 12) , and to date no known cases have been reported in travelers. 8 Travelers should never try to pet, handle, or feed unfamiliar animals, domestic or wild, particularly in areas of endemic rabies. Because children are at greatest risk of animal bites, including severe injuries, and may be less likely to report a bite incident, 8 they need to be counseled to avoid petting or handling dogs, cats, or other animals and should be supervised \n\naround animals at all times. If an exposure occurs, clean the wound thoroughly and immediately seek medical care for possible rabies postexposure prophylaxis (see Chapter 9) . Tetanus prophylaxis is also indicated if the traveler is not up to date with tetanus vaccination. In the case of an Old World monkey bite, medical care should be sought as soon as possible for prophylactic treatment against herpes B infection. Envenomations from snakes, scorpions, and spiders represent another animal-associated injury risk to travelers; medical care should be sought immediately. The treatment of snakebites and other venomous animal bites usually depends on the species of animal responsible (see Chapter 8) .\n\nAgricultural tourism is the experience of visiting a working farm or related operation for enjoyment and is a growing type of tourism both nationally and internationally ( Figure  10 -3). 9 Specialized tour operators offer package tours to farms in a number of countries. During such visits tourists may come in contact with both farm animals and contaminated soils and dusts that may contain infectious pathogens. Q fever is considered to be underdiagnosed in travelers, who can acquire it by exposure to farm animals or contaminated aerosols. 10 Travel to a farm in Guyana was associated with a cluster of human cases of Q fever, presumably from contact with a parturient goat and dog on a farm. 11 If the farm contains poultry, risks include exposure to Chlamydophila, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and avian influenza virus. Brucellosis is another potential farm-related exposure, either through direct contact with animals or consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. Brucellosis has been termed a \"travel-associated foodborne zoonosis\" in Germany, where a recent rise in cases has been traced to consumption of unpasteurized cheese from brucellosis-endemic countries. 12 In a series of brucellosis cases in San Diego, travel to Mexico was a risk factor for infection. 13 \n\nAn increasing amount of international travel is related to religious and cultural festivals. Each year several million Muslims participate in the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Although local agricultural authorities have taken steps to reduce animal contact risks to pilgrims, 14 the end of the Hajj is marked by the festival of Eid al-Adha, which may involve increased exposure to animal slaughtering activities. For example, a suspected outbreak of anthrax was linked to slaughter and distribution of infected meat from a camel during the festival. 15 Similarly, the Lunar New Year festivals in Asia often involve increased slaughtering and consumption of poultry, with an attendant increased risk of avian influenza. The CDC has issued travel advisories for U.S. travelers visiting Asia during the Lunar New Year festival. These recommendations include handwashing; avoidance of bird farms or live bird markets; not touching live or dead birds, including chickens, ducks, and wild birds, even if they do not seem sick; and not touching surfaces contaminated with bird feces, blood, or other body fluids. 16 \n\nAt any time of year visits to live animal markets, present in many cities and villages in a large number of countries, carry a risk of infection with zoonotic agents. In such markets numerous species of wildlife and domestic animals may be housed in close proximity, creating an increased opportunity for disease transmission. Color Plate 10-4 shows a typical scene from a live animal market in Asia. Human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus has been linked to visits to live bird markets, even for individuals who denied direct contact with sick or healthy-appearing poultry. 17 Avian influenza has been found on surfaces and dusts in such markets, and exposure may occur by touching contaminated surfaces as well as breathing contaminated dusts. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is another infection linked to live animal markets in Asia. Travelers wishing to reduce risk of zoonotic diseases while traveling should avoid visiting live animal markets, especially if a country is experiencing an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza. 18 A current list of countries is maintained at http:// www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/outbreaks/current.htm.\n\nWilderness travel overseas increases the risk of exposure to a number of pathogens as well as injuries from snakes, crocodiles, and other wildlife. Visitors on safari to game parks in Africa have become infected with African tick fever and other rickettsial infections that may have a reservoir in the local wildlife populations. 19 Although most forms of malaria, one of the most common causes of fever in returning travelers, are not zoonotic, certain monkey malaria species such as Plasmodium knowlesi have been described in human beings and may be underdiagnosed. 20 Other zoonotic arthropodborne infections such as trypanosomiasis, yellow fever, and Chikungunya fever have been reported in safari and wilderness travelers. 21, 22 Sleeping in huts and shelters that may also be home to local rodent populations can increase risk of infection with hantaviruses and various hemorrhagic fevers, including Lassa fever. 23 Swimming in fresh water in areas frequented by wildlife has led to outbreaks of leptospirosis in adventure travelers. 24 Wilderness travelers may be exposed to bats when visiting caves or sleeping outside in areas frequented by bats, where they could come in contact with bat droppings or sustain bat bites. In addition to rabies risk, bats are reservoirs for a wide range of other viral pathogens, including other lyssa viruses, Nipah virus, SARS-like coronavirus, and Marburg virus. 25 Exposure to aerosolized bat guano has also been associated with the development of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis in travelers. 26 \n\nMany local delicacies that travelers encounter may involve animal products from domestic or wild animals. Meat and dairy products may be served raw or undercooked and may be a source for zoonotic infections such as brucellosis, trichinosis, and salmonellosis in returning travelers. 27 Raw chicken sashimi from an island in Japan is known to be contaminated with Campylobacter. However, local residents do not appear to become ill, suggesting a role for acquired protective immunity that a traveler would presumably not enjoy. 28 Travelers to Southeast Asia and Africa have become infected with parasites, including Paragonimus, trematodes Clonorchis sinensis or Haplorchis pumilio, and gnathostomes. Paragonimiasis is acquired by eating raw freshwater crabs or crayfish. Gnathostomiasis is a nematode infection acquired by ingestion of various intermediate hosts in addition to fish. 29, 30 Eating unwashed produce and undercooked foods such as mollusks in some countries poses risks of numerous infectious diseases, including viral hepatitis, bacterial enteritis, and eosinophilic meningitis from rat lungworm. 31 There is increasing awareness of the infectious risks of improperly cooked poultry products. Such practices have been linked to cases of avian influenza. 32 Bovine tuberculosis transmission to human beings can involve consumption of uncooked meat as well as raw milk (see Chapter 9). 33 Bushmeat (wild game killed for food) is an important source of animal protein for communities in many parts of the world. It has been estimated that in Central Africa alone more than 1 billion kilograms of meat from wild animals are consumed each year (Figure 10-4). 34 Table 10 -3 shows the diversity of species that may end up being sold for human consumption, especially during times of civil unrest. 35 Emerging pathogens linked to bushmeat consumption include simian immunodeficiency viruses, anthrax, and hemorrhagic fever viruses. 36 Although the risk of infection from bushmeat exposure may be greatest to persons who butcher carcasses, travelers to areas where bushmeat is an important part of local diets may be at risk if they consume improperly cooked bushmeat.\n\nTravelers should avoid going barefoot on beaches frequented by animals. Many beaches that travelers visit during international vacations are frequented by dogs and cats. Walking barefoot on beaches contaminated with their feces is a risk factor for acquiring zoonotic hookworm infection (cutaneous larva migrans, also known as creeping eruption (see Chapter 9 and Color Plate 9-33). 37 Another beach-related zoonosis is tungiasis, a skin infestation caused by the sand flea Tunga penetrans (jiggers). Walking barefoot on beaches also carries risks of stings from jellyfish and other marine organisms (see Chapter 8) . Sandboxes and play areas are another source of contact for hookworms, roundworms (Toxocara), and Toxoplasma.\n\nPersons purchasing souvenirs while traveling should be aware that improperly processed hides used for drums and other souvenirs may be a source of exposure for cutaneous anthrax (see Chapter 9). 38 However, this risk is considered to be low. Where a taxon is composed of multiple species, allocation of that taxon to either one of these groups depends on the relative proportion of protected and unprotected species; if at least half of the species is protected, the taxon is placed in the protected group. \n\nIn the returning traveler with illness, a careful history of animal-related exposures should be obtained in addition to the standard questions (Box 10-1). If the response to any of these questions is affirmative, further evaluation is warranted.\n\nTraveling with pets is becoming increasingly popular. There are a number of reasons why people travel with a pet. These include emotional, economic, gene transfer, and seeking specialized veterinary care. 39 Emotional reasons include companionship, treating an animal as a member of the family, and reluctance to leave an animal behind. Economic factors can include the cost of arranging care for the animal while traveling. Gene transfer involves activities such as taking a pedigreed animal to another location to breed with another animal. Finally, owners may take an ill animal to another location for specialized veterinary care. 39 Veterinarians should go through similar steps as their human health counterparts in evaluating animals that are traveling. These include pretravel risk assessment and owner counseling, vaccines and other preventive care as necessary, and evaluation of returning and newly imported animals after travel.\n\nMany of the infectious disease risks to traveling companion animals are shared with human beings. Even travel to different regions in the same country can expose an animal to new health risks. Pets that travel also face potential exposure to animal diseases that are not zoonotic in nature, such as canine parvovirus, canine viral hepatitis, and feline panleukopenia virus.\n\nParticular zoonoses associated with dog travel include rabies, leishmaniasis, and roundworm infection. 40-43 A case of a rabid puppy imported illegally from Morocco to France by a traveling couple resulted in the prophylactic treatment of 21 persons, the euthanasia of a contact animal, and legal action against the travelers. 44 In 2007, a puppy rescued from an animal shelter in India by a veterinarian who brought the animal into the United States at 11 weeks of age was found to be positive for rabies by the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services. 45 Such introduction of rabies from animal travel can involve foreign rabies virus variants. As a result, the CDC is considering strengthening federal regulations regarding the importation of companion animals. 2 Vector-borne diseases are a documented risk to traveling dogs. For example, leishmaniasis has been reported in dogs traveling in high-incidence countries, leading to the introduction of disease upon returning home.\n\nAnimals may cause allergic reactions if they come into contact with sensitized travelers or airline, train, or other transportation personnel. Animals with allergy may also be exposed to a variety of allergens during travel.\n\nToxic risks to traveling animals include contaminated pet food, 46 water, pesticides, and accidental ingestion of rodenticides (see Chapter 8) .\n\nAnimals risk physical injury from being shipped in containers or otherwise restrained, heat stress and cold exposures, and fights with other animals. Other potential stressors include unfamiliar surroundings, disruption of circadian schedules, noise, and other noxious stimuli.\n\nTravelers wishing to travel with pets will need to identify the logistic requirements for transporting and housing the animal during travel. Airlines may vary in their rules regarding whether an animal can be carried in a pet container that can be placed under a seat, or whether all animals need to be placed in cargo. There have been instances of companion animals dying from heat and cold stress and other trauma while being shipped in cargo, and owners should be aware of the risks to animals undergoing air travel. 47 There may be restrictions on the number of animals allowed. Rental car companies, trains, buses, and hotels may also have restrictive policies about pets. These policies should be clarified in advance of travel.\n\nAnimals that travel often need documentation of vaccination status, tick or other prophylactic treatments, and a statement from a veterinarian that they are free of communicable disease and able to travel safely. Such documentation may be necessary for the animal to enter another country. Owners should contact the embassies of countries they plan to visit to go through the required entry processes as well as determine the U.S. clearance processes upon return. 48 Policies of some countries may require an animal to be quarantined or destroyed without proper documentation. Additional information is available at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_ export/animals/animal_exports.shtml. Many countries limit movement of dogs and other animals based on rabies status. Dogs and cats generally cannot pass from a rabies-endemic country to a rabies-free country without a process of quarantine and/or vaccination documentation. A number of federal agencies are involved with regulation of animals entering the United States. The CDC regulates the importation into the United States of dogs, cats, turtles, bats, monkeys, and other animals as well as animal products capable of causing human disease (see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/ travel/yellowBookCh7-AnimalImport.aspx). 48 Pets taken out of the United States are subject to the same regulations when returning to the country as are newly imported animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates a number of species being imported based on their disease risk to plants and animals of agricultural concern.\n\nNo single agency regulates entry of dogs into the United States. Although the CDC does not require a general certificate of health for dogs, dogs with evidence of illness may not be allowed entry. Documentation of rabies vaccination at least 30 days before entry is required, although dogs younger than 3 months and dogs without proof of rabies vaccination may be allowed to enter if the owner completes a confinement agreement and certifies the animal will be vaccinated and kept confined at least 30 days after vaccination. Unvaccinated dogs from countries considered rabies free (see Table 10 -4) may also be allowed entry. 49 In addition to CDC regulations, the USDA regulates the importation of dogs potentially carrying diseases of agricultural importance, including screwworms or some Taenia species of tapeworm. 2 For cats, a general certificate of health is not required to enter the United States, but some states and air carriers may require such documentation. Rabies vaccination is also not required, but some states may require proof of rabies vaccine documentation. All pet cats entering Hawaii and Guam are subject to local quarantine requirements. 49 Importation of birds is regulated by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. 50 The USDA currently restricts importation of pet birds from countries where highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 is present in poultry. To import a pet bird of non-U.S. origin, the importer or owner must obtain a USDA import permit, 51 have a certificate of health from a veterinarian in the exporting country, and allow the bird to be quarantined for 30 days in a USDA animal import center at the owner's expense. Pet birds arriving from Canada are not required to be quarantined. 52 Entry into the United States of birds that are covered by endangered species conventions is regulated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThe CDC periodically issues embargoes on specific animals associated with disease risk, including civets (SARS), birds from specific countries (avian influenza), and African rodents (monkeypox).\n\nCDC regulations do not apply to horses not known to be carrying diseases infectious to human beings, but the USDA may regulate horse import due to risks of diseases of agricultural importance such as screwworm.\n\nImportation of fish into the United States is not regulated by the CDC, but U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regulations may apply.\n\nFinally, importation of certain animals and animal products is regulated by other federal agencies such as the U.S. Customs Service. 53 If animals are traveling, they should have a veterinary evaluation for pretravel risk assessment and administration of necessary vaccines and other preventive treatments. Box 10-2 outlines the elements of such a visit.\n\nThe veterinarian should determine whether travel is medically advisable for the animal. Travel is riskier for immunocompromised animals, including young animals and animals with underlying illness. Certain species, such as snakes, may not be allowed entry by other countries. Animals with behavioral problems may attack other animals or people or present other travel risks.\n\nThe veterinarian should ensure that animals with ongoing illnesses have an adequate supply of medications and that plans for emergency veterinary medical care while traveling are discussed with the owner. \n\nAnimals imported into the United States are required to be healthy. However, if illness develops, evaluation should involve the steps outlined in Box 10-3. If infectious conditions are identified, the possibility of zoonotic transmission to the animal's owner should be considered, and there should be rapid communication to either a human health care provider, public health department, or both. Further steps should be based on the results of this preliminary evaluation.\n\nHealth and Appropriateness of Animal \n\n\u2022 Did the animal go through a quarantine process before reentering the country? \u2022 Is there documentation of rabies vaccination status, and did the animal travel to or originate from a rabies-endemic country? \u2022 Is the animal otherwise up to date on necessary vaccinations and preventive treatment (see Box \n\nAnimal and human health clinicians need to understand the scope of the exotic and wildlife pet trade, the related health risks, and ways to reduce such risks. Driven by popular demand, trade in live animals for pets has been increasing both in the United States and worldwide. 1 More than 200 million animals, representing thousands of individual species, are estimated to be legally imported into the United States from more than 160 countries. The majority of these imports were for the pet and aquarium trade. 2 The number of animals illegally imported each year is unknown but is also believed to be considerable. 3 As a result, the United States is the world's largest importer of live animals. 2 At the same time, many potential pet owners are unaware of the health risks of such nontraditional pets. 4\n\nPublic Health Professionals \n\nMuch of the pet trade involves traditional pets, species that have been bred and maintained over multiple generations for human companionship and have acknowledged popularity as pets. Examples include dogs, cats, and horses. Caged birds such as parakeets and canaries and pocket pets such as gerbils and hamsters are also popular and are bred for the pet trade. Another large segment of the pet trade involves tropical fish, which have generally been associated with fewer zoonotic diseases than other animals. Much of the remainder of the pet trade, however, is in nontraditional pets, or species that are not domesticated and are captured from the wild or captive-bred to meet an increasing demand for unusual pets. Nontraditional pets include exotic species that are nonnative to the local ecosystem and native wildlife, which are local wildlife species. The number of wild animals, including reptiles and amphibians, captured in the United States for the pet trade each year is not precisely known but appears to be in the range of millions of animals. 7 This segment of the pet trade is extremely lucrative and mainly uses the Internet, specialty newsletters, swap meets, auctions, and private sales rather than pet shops. Such settings are largely unregulated and lack disease prevention and control methods such as quarantine or veterinary care and may contribute to species reduction. Currently, 22 states ban or regulate certain exotic pets.\n\nReptiles such as turtles and iguanas are popular pets ( Figure 10-5) . However, as subclinical carriers of Salmonella, they have been the source of many human illnesses. 8 A 1975 FDA ban on the sale of turtles with a carapace less than 4 inches is estimated to have prevented more than 100,000 infections.\n\nThe importation, trade, and ownership of wild-caught and exotic animals for pets enhances the risk of dissemination and transmission of novel, rare (hantavirus, rabies, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus), emerging, and exotic (depending on species) envenomation. Discourage exotic or wild pet ownership among immunocompromised persons and families with children younger than 5 years. Discourage contact with mammals at high risk of transmitting rabies (e.g., bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes).\n\n\u2022 Ensure that local pet stores, pet swap meets, petting zoos, schools, and other venues with human-animal contact are aware of the recommendations of the NASPHV for reducing risk of transmission in such settings, including adequate handwashing facilities, separation of animal and nonanimal areas, and avoidance of high-risk species. 5 \u2022 If a human health clinician reports a zoonotic disease associated with an exotic or wildlife pet, coordinate a response with agricultural and wildlife veterinarians. \u2022 Form interdisciplinary networks and working groups to address exotic and wild animal pet issues that arise locally and regionally. Groups should consist of veterinarians, public health professionals, wildlife agencies and rehabilitators, zoologic park staff, university representatives, physicians, and environmental health professionals.\n\n\u2022 Ask patients about ownership and contact with exotic or wild animals. If they report such contact, list the species, origin, and types of interactions. Consider consulting the patient's veterinarian about the health risks (zoonotic and injury potential) of particular species. \u2022 Discourage acquisition, contact with, and maintenance of exotic and wildlife pets, particularly for families with children or immunocompromised persons. \u2022 If patients report ownership of venomous animals, ensure they are aware of the steps to take if envenomation occurs and that local emergency treatment (such as appropriate antivenin) is available locally (see Chapter 8). \u2022 If zoonotic disease is suspected or identified in a person in contact with exotic or wild animals (pets, recreational or occupational exposure) or works in a pet shop or other animal handling facility, notify the local and state public health department.\n\n\u2022 Support efforts of state and national agencies to regulate or license ownership of exotic or wild pets. \u2022 Counsel clients to refrain from owning wild-caught animals, about disease transmission routes, and the risks of ownership and contact with wildlife and exotic animals as pets. 6 \u2022 Assist prospective pet owners in appropriate pet selection. \u2022 Counsel owners on techniques to avoid high-risk contact with exotic or wild animals. (Ebola, monkeypox, Nipah virus) pathogens. Human beings, domestic animals, and native wildlife are at risk. 9 Serious injuries are also a risk when handling wild or exotic animals because captivity and human companionship do not change natural behaviors or tame these animals. Many nonhuman primate pets have all their teeth removed but can still injure handlers. 10 In addition to the zoonotic disease risk, some exotic and native wildlife species kept as pets are venomous and pose envenomation risks to other animals and pet owners (see Chapter 8) . 11 Exotic venomous reptiles may produce venom for which antivenin may be not widely available.\n\nNot surprisingly, the international trade in animals and the use of wildlife as pets have been linked to a number of zoonoses and other animal diseases. Table 10 -5 shows documented examples of exotic and wildlife pets and diseases associated with them. Clearly the potential exists for injuries (trauma, envenomation), infections (viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi) and allergies, although not specifically documented in the literature as a pet encounter.\n\nThese cases of reported disease illustrate the complexity of the issues surrounding nontraditional pets. The 1994 outbreak of Salmonella associated with African pygmy hedgehogs (Figure 10-6) involved captive-bred animals. Importation of hedgehogs from Africa had been banned since 1991 because of concern about possible importation of foot and mouth disease. 23 Other exotic animals linked to salmonellosis include a komodo dragon at a zoo that infected 65 persons, mainly children, with contact to a temporary barrier around the exhibit. 24 Spurred and leopard tortoises imported to Florida from Africa have been found to be infested with ticks of the genus Amblyomma, which can be a vector for heartwater, a serious livestock disease caused by the bacterium Cowdria rumi nantium. 25 As a result, these African tortoises are currently banned in the United States. More recently, African vipers have been diagnosed with severe and even fatal tickborne disease related to a Cowdria-like organism. 26 The 2003 multistate outbreak of monkeypox has received significant scientific and media attention and has a number of instructive points about imported zoonotic pathogens of wildlife. The outbreak was traced to the importation of wildcaught giant Gambian pouched rats (Cricetomys gambi anus; Figure 10 -7) and other rodents that had been recently imported from Africa for the pet trade.\n\nSome of these exotic rodents were carriers of the monkeypox virus. When housed in dealer facilities, they were caged close to a susceptible native wildlife animal species, black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). These prairie dogs then were sold as pets, and in the process 71 human beings, including pet owners, pet store workers, distributors, and veterinarians, contracted infection through contact with sick animals or their secretions (Figure 10-8) . [27] [28] [29] Figure 10 -9 shows the complex web of contact and distribution that resulted in human cases. The outbreak did not produce human fatalities but clearly showed the potential for a novel pathogen to cause outbreaks in the United States as a result of the global pet trade.\n\nExamples of native wildlife used as pets and infecting their owners include a wild-caught prairie dog transmitting tularemia to an owner. 18 In Brazil, a new rabies virus variant was identified in human cases associated with pet marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). 20 \n\nThe magnitude and diversity of animal species being maintained as pets and the ongoing potential for novel and rare zoonoses present challenges to health care providers and public health professionals. It appears that reduction of the rate of introduced pathogens can only be achieved by everyone at every level working on some aspect of the prevention and control-from local awareness of the problem to policy changes on a national or international level that restrict the trade in live animals. 2 NASPHV has joined with CSTE in developing position statements requesting a federal interagency work group to address the risks posed by the exotic animal trade (see Developing Importation and Importation Restrictions on Exotic and Native Wildlife with Potential Adverse Impact on Public Health, available online at http:// www.cste.org/PS/2003pdfs/03-ID-13%20-%20FINAL. pdf). 30 In particular, NASPHV has called for the creation of an \"approved species\" list to reduce the threat of disease importation, more extensive inspection and quarantine of imported animals, and tracking of animals that have been imported. The AVMA is also on record discouraging exotic animals and wildlife as pets. 31 Although CDC regulations govern the importation of dogs, cats, turtles with a carapace of less than 4 inches, monkeys, bats, civets, birds from countries with H5N1 influenza, several species of African rodents, and animal products capable of causing human disease, 32 only a small number of species (including the African rodents linked to the importation of monkeypox) are currently banned. In addition, most of the animals that are imported, with the exception of avian species, are neither quarantined nor tested for infectious disease agents before entering the country. NASPHV has developed guidelines titled \"Compendium of Measures to Prevent Disease Associated with Animals in Public Settings\" to prevent spread of infections at public settings where animal contact could take place, including animal displays, petting zoos, animal swap meets, pet stores, zoological institutions, nature parks, circuses, carnivals, farm tours, livestock-birthing exhibits, county or state fairs, schools, and wildlife photo opportunities. 5 Key recommendations of these guidelines, as well as other recently published recommendations to reduce the risk of diseases related to nontraditional pets, are shown in Box 10-4. \n\nAvailable evidence continues to suggest that the psychosocial support value of companion animals, particularly for the elderly or infirm, 1-3 outweighs the risk of acquiring a serious infection from such animals. Nevertheless, issues regarding hygiene and common sense practices must be addressed to support a healthy human-animal bond, especially among immunocompromised people or pets.\n\n\u2022 Provide public health guidance to reduce opportunistic infections among immunocompromised persons.\n\n\u2022 Stress general hygiene principles, including handwashing, and ensure proper food preparation and safe water supplies.\n\n\u2022 Understand the risks and considerable benefits of companion animal ownership among immunocompromised persons. \u2022 Ensure that a thorough history is taken to best manage the patient's potential exposure to zoonotic disease.\n\nOppor \n\n\u2022 Provide consultation about zoonotic disease risk reduction. \u2022 Provide guidance on maintaining the health of immunocompromised animal patients, including a healthy environment. \u2022 Maintain confidentiality of information regarding immunocompromised persons.\n\nMillions of people and companion animals in this country are living with less than a robust immune system. Immunosuppression can result from a number of etiologies, either from a primary or genetic malfunction (rare) or, more commonly, as a result of a secondary or acquired factor such as debilitation, immunosuppressive chemotherapy ( Figure  10 -10), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in human beings, or feline leukemia virus (FeLV) in cats (Table 10-6 ). In general, defects in humoral immunity (B-cell lines) can lead to increased susceptibility to bacterial infections; cell-mediated immunity (T-cell lines) defects to viral, fungal, or protozoal infections; and defects of phagocytosis or the complement system to disseminated infections.\n\nA large proportion of American households include pets, 7 and pet ownership among immunocompromised persons is common. For example, studies of patients with HIV infection have reported rates of pet ownership similar to that of the general population, with approximately half owning or living with pets. 8 In addition, on a global level, the HIV/ AIDS pandemic has created large populations of individuals with compromised immune systems, many of whom may also be exposed to zoonotic diseases. 9,10 Human and veterinary clinicians are quite likely to encounter situations in which they may provide appropriate guidance for reducing animal sources of infectious diseases for human beings and vice versa by educating themselves and staff to provide the best available information. There are at least three possible effects of human immunodeficiency on animal-human disease transmission:\n\n1. An immunocompromised host is more susceptible to infection with opportunistic disease. 2. An immunocompromised host may transmit opportunistic disease to others. 3. A disease may be more severe in an immunocompromised host (e.g., toxoplasmosis, which causes asymptomatic or mild disease in most immunocompetent patients but can cause severe and even fatal systemic disease in immunocompromised individuals).\n\nThe knowledge level among immunocompromised persons and their health care providers about the risk of acquiring infections from pets could be increased with an appropriate educational strategy. In one study in which more than 400 patients with AIDS were interviewed-half of whom owned pets-only about 10% who were living with pets were given any information about zoonotic diseases from their health care provider, and one quarter of this information was incorrect or misunderstood (e.g., \"fleas can give you rabies\" or \"cats can give you AIDS\"). 8 Because pet ownership is as common (and understanding of zoonoses as uncommon) among persons living with HIV as in the general population, human health care providers must be prepared to discuss with immunocompromised patients the risks of living with pets. Overly conservative approaches, including physician recommendations for their patients to relinquish pets, have largely been unheeded as owners often have strong bonds with their animals. 11 Armed with complete and accurate information, patients and their care providers can weigh these risks against the often substantial benefits of love, touch, social support, and companionship that accrue to pet owners. Zoonotic disease prevention is a shared responsibility among human, veterinary, and public health professionals. Improving communication among these persons will enhance zoonotic disease prevention. 12 \n\nPet-owning human health care providers must be vigilant regarding nosocomial zoonoses, particularly if they are working with immunocompromised patients. In one situation, a common yeast pathogen of canine otitis externa ( Figure 10-11 ) was introduced into a neonatal intensive care unit by a dog-owning health care worker, causing colonization in infants, some resulting in serious infections. 13, 14 In another case, a cat on a geriatric ward was the likely suspect of staphylococcal infections (see Chapter 5). 15 \n\nHand and food hygiene is vital (Figures 10-12 and 10-13). Pets are not likely to be the most common source of zoonotic disease infection. More likely, contact with raw or undercooked meat or from an environmental infectious source is implicated in transmission. Unequivocally, immunocompromised individuals should avoid raw meat and eggs and unpasteurized dairy products. For example, although cats are the definitive host for Toxoplasma gondii, undercooked meat (less than 165\u00b0 F) and inadequately washed, contaminated fruits and vegetables are likely the source for infection. See USDA food safety fact sheets: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/Keep_Food_Safe_ Food_Safety_Basics/index.asp and http://www.fsis.usda. gov/Factsheets/At_Risk_&_Underserved_Fact_Sheets/ index.asp.\n\nSerologic or fecal evaluation of healthy cats for Toxo plasma infection is not recommended. Oocysts are shed transiently and are easily missed, and serologic evaluation does not predict cats shedding oocysts. Instead, prevention \u2022 Review guidance to reducing exposure to selected opportunistic diseases among persons with HIV (see http:// www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5108a1.htm). \u2022 Encourage questions about healthy living with companion animals and discourage kissing or face-to-face contact. \u2022 Pet vaccines, including live attenuated strains, should be recommended and given as needed; they are not believed to present a human health hazard. 17\n\n\u2022 Avoid contact with wild animals to reduce the risk of enteric disease, such as acquiring Cryptosporidium from wild birds. \u2022 NEVER touch the feces of any animal. \u2022 Avoid farm animals and petting zoos to decrease exposure to Escherichia coli in ruminants, Bordetella bronchiseptica in swine, and Salmonella in chicks and ducks. \u2022 Occupational health care workers working with high-risk personnel such as veterinarians, veterinary staff, zookeepers, and pet shop workers should counsel immunocompromised workers about the risk of occupational of zoonotic disease infection and possible work restrictions to reduce risk for those with significant impairment of immunity.\n\n\u2022 Select healthy, well-mannered dogs or cats 6 months or older to decrease the likelihood of exposure to enteric diseases and Bartonella from kittens. \u2022 Avoid petting or handling free-roaming animals; when selecting a pet, choose one with a documented veterinary health history and current vaccinations. \u2022 Avoid exotic or wild animals to reduce the likelihood of exposure to emerging infections (i.e., monkeypox in rodents) and known diseases such as herpes B infection from macaque monkeys and Salmonella from reptiles ( Figure 10-15) . Cockatoos, like pigeons, may shed Cryptococcus in their feces. Transmission of this infection from a cockatoo to its owner who was chronically immunocompromised because women and immunosuppressed patients can be at greater risk in acquiring foodborne illness and need to take additional precautions when handling raw food products. Cook meat, poultry, and eggs thoroughly. Using a thermometer to measure the internal temperature of meat is a good way to be sure that it is cooked sufficiently to kill bacteria. For example, ground beef should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 \u00b0 F. Eggs should be cooked until the yolk is firm. (From Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Image Library. Photo courtesy James Gathany.) of a renal transplant has occurred. 18 Therefore some authors have recommended that immunocompromised patients not own cockatoos (Figure 10-16) . 19 A fatal outbreak of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in solid-organ transplant recipients was traced back to a pet hamster acquired by the organ donor 17 days before donation (Figure 10-17) . The prevalence of this virus in rodent populations has led to recommendations that immunocompromised individuals (as well as pregnant women) should avoid owning pet rodents or having contact with wild or pet rodents. 20 Have a veterinarian conduct a physical examination and fecal analysis on a new pet.\n\n\u2022 Seek veterinary care early in the course of clinical disease of pets to limit chances for zoonotic disease exposure.\n\n\u2022 Keep pets indoors or leashed on walks to decrease the likelihood of engagement with other animals. \u2022 Because of occasional cases of Bordetella bronchiseptica among immunocompromised persons, 21, 22 avoid exposing dogs or owners to situations in which dogs are congregated, such as boarding kennels, grooming parlors, off-leash dog parks, or dog shows. \u2022 Do not allow pets to hunt, scavenge, or eat feces to reduce the likelihood of exposure to enteric infections. \u2022 Do not feed pets raw meat or egg diets or provide unpasteurized dairy products to limit exposure to enteric infections. \u2022 Do not allow your pet to drink from the toilet. \u2022 Keep animals and litterboxes out of food preparation areas. \u2022 Avoid exposure to pet urine, feces, and saliva (don't allow your pet to lick your face or open lesions). \u2022 Have a nonimmunocompromised household member remove a pet's solid waste and dispose daily by flushing down a toilet or discarding in the garbage or in a compost area (not to be spread on fruits or vegetables). \u2022 Avoid animals with diarrhea. Have an immunocompetent household member clean soiled areas in the house of organic debris, followed by a 1:10 household bleach solution. \u2022 Avoid rough play with the pet that could result in being bitten or scratched; keep pet's nails trimmed short. \u2022 Remove and dispose of bird cage linings daily and use \"wet\" cleaning for the cage and utensils on a weekly basis.\n\nWear gloves when handling items that are contaminated with bird droppings. \u2022 Have a helper clean the fish tank ( Figure 10-18) or wear disposable gloves during such activities, followed by washing hands thoroughly by rubbing hands together vigorously for 15 to 20 seconds with running water and soap. \u2022 If assistance is required to care for your pet, contact local volunteer groups who may be willing to provide exercise, food, or foster care (e.g., during hospitalization). \n\nAlthough any zoonotic disease that occurs in immunocompetent individuals can also affect immunocompromised patients, the U.S. Public Health Service has highlighted a number of animal agents that pose a significant risk to HIVinfected persons. These include causes of enteritis (especially Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Cryptosporidium), and Bartonella, Toxoplasma, Histoplasma, and Mycobacterium marinum.\n\nThe evidence-based recommendations of the U.S. Public Health Service and the Infectious Diseases Society of America are listed in Table 10-7 .\n\nAlthough these guidelines recommend that human health care providers counsel their immunocompromised patients about zoonotic disease risk reduction, surveys of physicians have indicated that many believe that veterinarians are best equipped to provide such counseling and should therefore be involved in patient education of immunocompromised individuals. 12 Some authorities have stated that veterinarians are more qualified than physicians to advise pet owners and persons in high-risk professions about zoonotic risks. 23 \n\nIn the veterinary setting, pet owners may be more willing to request information regarding safer pet ownership for immunocompromised persons if there are, for example, posters and handouts encouraging such client education or information in practice newsletters. Veterinarians can address high-risk persons during general discussions about zoonotic disease diagnosis, control, and prevention. Veterinarians should also emphasize among their staff the need for strict confidentiality regarding any personal information an animal owner happens to disclose about his or her own medical status (it is not recommended, for example, to document human medical information in the veterinary record).\n\n\u2022 Neuter pets. \u2022 Provide strict adherence to strategic deworming protocols and maintenance of appropriate vaccinations. \u2022 Be prepared to discuss end-of-life planning for the pet's continued care (http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/guidelines_ for_finding_a_responsible_home_for_a_pet.html). *System used to rate the strength of recommendations and quality of supporting evidence is as follows: Rating strength of recommendation A, Both strong evidence for efficacy and substantial clinical benefit support recommendation for use; should always be offered. B, Moderate evidence for efficacy or strong evidence for efficacy but only limited clinical benefit; supports recommendation for use; should usually be offered. C, Evidence for efficacy is insufficient to support a recommendation for or against use, or evidence for efficacy might not outweigh adverse consequences (e.g., drug toxicity, drug interactions) or cost of the chemoprophylaxis or alternative approaches; use is optional. D, Moderate evidence for lack of efficacy or for adverse outcome supports a recommendation against use; should usually not be offered. E, Good evidence for lack of efficacy or for adverse outcome supports a recommendation against use; should never be offered. Rating quality of evidence supporting the recommendation I, Evidence from \u22651 correctly randomized, controlled trials. II, Evidence from \u22651 well-designed clinical trials without randomization, from cohort or case-controlled analytic studies (preferably from more than one center), or from multiple time-series studies, or dramatic results from uncontrolled experiments. III, Evidence from opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of consulting committees.\n\n\u2022 Keep these animals indoors; do not allow pets to hunt, scavenge, or consume raw meat or egg diets or unpasteurized dairy products. \u2022 Wash hands before and after handling the pet. \u2022 Provide appropriate endoparasite and ectoparasite control. \u2022 Avoid exposure to other ill animals.\n\nA public health veterinarian working as an AIDS surveillance coordinator received a number of questions for which the humananimal bond was never more poignant. Indeed, one was from a gentleman who was recently diagnosed with AIDS and who owned a 4yearold neutered male Golden Retriever. His family practitioner, concerned about any increased risk for opportunistic infections, advised him to find another home for his beloved pet. This man was heartbroken, trying to gather as much information as possible about what specifically he would face if he ignored his doctor's advice. Fortunately, with his permission, the veterinarian was able to contact his physi cian to discuss the relatively low risk as well as the benefits of owning a healthy pet (one that was receiving regular veteri nary care) and encouraged the doctor to continue to contact public health practitioners for information as well as this pet owner's veterinarian (with permission) about the animal's preventive health care. Additionally, this pet owner happened to live in an area with an active volunteer organization that assisted with walking and feeding pets of persons living with AIDS. Armed with these resources, the patient was able to maintain a healthy pet.\n\nA public health veterinarian who was also a relief clinical veter inarian was presented with a 7yearold neutered female cat for toxoplasmosis serologic testing and (reluctant) possible eutha nasia of the cat. The cat's owner was the spouse of a cancer patient and was concerned that the spouse was on immunosup pressive chemotherapy and therefore at great risk for toxoplas mosis from their pet. The veterinarian explained the life cycle of toxoplasmosis, the epidemiology in people and cats, and that if the serology was positive it could actually be protective. The owner declined both serologic testing and euthanasia because the cat had never hunted in its lifetime, was indoors only, and was fed an exclusively commercial diet. There was no evidence of mice or rats in the house, decreasing the cat's likelihood of exposure to the parasite. However, the spouse enjoyed garden ing-a much greater potential for exposure to toxoplasmosis. Fortunately the patient always wore gloves when doing so and thoroughly washed afterwards. The veterinarian and the cat owner discussed additional toxoplasmosis exposure reduction, including proper handling of raw meats and washing raw foods. The veterinarian and cat owner agreed that the owner would be the person cleaning the litterbox, schedule overall wellness examinations of the cat every 6 months, and would bring the cat in for evaluation and zoonotic disease prevention if diar rhea or signs of respiratory disease developed.\n\nEach year in the United States several million persons are bitten by animals. Although up to 80% of bites may never be reported, more than 300,000 emergency department visits occur each year for dog bites alone. 1 Approximately half of reported animal bite victims are children. Dogs are responsible for the majority of reported animal bite injuries to human beings in the United States, followed by cats and rodents. 2 Bites from human beings are rarer. With the increasing popularity of exotic pets, patients may present to emergency departments with bites from a wide range of species. In addition to trauma, infection (Color Plate 10-7) and envenomation (see Chapter 8) can be major concerns with animal bites. Animal bites can also result in allergy and anaphylaxis, which might be immediate or delayed (e.g., anaphylaxis has been reported after rodent bites and horse bites, even when the patient had a history of only mild allergic symptoms in the past 3, 4 ). In addition, the victim and/or animal owner might experience psychological trauma associated with either the bite incident itself or the consequent decisions that must be made regarding the biting animal. Animal (especially dog) bite fatalities in human beings are uncommon but occur at the rate of 1 to 2 dozen each year in the United States. 5 Animal bites are common in companion animals and livestock as well (Figure 10-19) , and fatalities in animals can occur if they are not systematically reported. The initial care and treatment of animals bitten by other animals is similar to that for animal bites in human beings.\n\nThe optimal prevention and treatment of animal bites require good communication among veterinary, human health, and public health professionals. Often the veterinarian (and sometimes a zoologist) must provide critical information about the animal source of the bite, such as rabies risk status, whereas the public health professional may become involved in issues such as rabies prophylaxis and animal quarantine. As discussed in Chapter 12, animal bites are a major occupational risk of veterinarians, their staff, and other animal workers. This section covers key aspects of management and prevention of animal bites as well as bites by human beings.\n\n\u2022 Be aware of rabies risk in the community and be available for consultation with clinicians on postexposure prophylaxis. \u2022 Provide public education to avoid feeding or handling wild or stray animals. \u2022 Support community animal control efforts.\n\n\u2022 Educate families to never leave a child alone with an animal. \u2022 Be aware of educational resources for animal bite prevention, such as:\n\n\u2022 Humane Society of the U.S. (HSUS): http://www.hsus. org/pets/pet_care/dog_care/stay_dog_bite_free/index. html \u2022 CDC: http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/biteprevention. htm (Box 10-5) \u2022 AVMA: http://www.avma.org/press/publichealth/dogbite/messpoints.asp. \u2022 US Postal Service: http://www.usps.com/communications/community/dogbite.htm.\n\n\u2022 Provide information on bite prevention to patients with animals and families with children.\n\npersons to avoid contact with rodents. \u2022 Counsel patients on first-aid procedures to be taken in the event of a bite injury and to seek medical care for all bites. \u2022 In caring for animal bite injuries, take a complete history regarding the animal, circumstances of the bite, history of allergies, and rabies and tetanus risk. Documentation that includes a drawing or photograph of the wound may be helpful because of legal implications. \u2022 Systematically evaluate the need for antibiotic, rabies, and tetanus prophylaxis, consulting with veterinary and public health professionals as necessary. \n\n\u2022 Counsel pet owners to appropriately socialize and train pets to be well mannered. \u2022 Counsel clients and staff on proper handling precautions to minimize the risk of animal bites to human beings (see . \u2022 Counsel clients and staff on proper first-aid to minimize the risk of animal bite infection. \u2022 When dealing with animal behavioral problems such as aggression, fears, and phobias, assess risk of bites to human beings and whether modifications to the animal environment or handling practices are indicated or whether animal should be euthanized. \u2022 Assist human health care providers in indentifying specific zoonotic disease risks from particular animal species. \u2022 Neuter pets and practice preventative medicine (e.g., ensure all dogs, cats, and ferrets are current with rabies vaccination). \u2022 Counsel cat owners to keep their pets indoors and dog owners to disallow their pets to hunt or garbage feed. \u2022 Provide booster rabies vaccine to pets with animal bite wounds from known or suspected rabid animals and work with local public health officials concerning management for potential rabies exposure. \u2022 Test pet cats with bite wounds for FeLV/FIV at time of presentation and again 6 months later. 6\n\nMany animal bites can be prevented through avoidance of high-risk situations. Table 10 -8 lists some risk factors for human animal bites from dogs and cats. These include factors affecting animal aggressiveness, characteristics of bitten human beings, and characteristics of injury events. Risk factors for animal aggressiveness include female gender in cats and male gender (especially unneutered) in dogs as well as particular dog breeds. Human victims of dog bites tend to be younger than victims of cat bites. Bite injuries are often associated with particular types of aggressive behavior in the biting animal. These include dominance aggression, in which an animal assert its social dominance over another animal (such as a child) that it perceives as being weaker (e.g., members of a wolf pack) and possessive aggression, in which an animal attacks to prevent an object such as a toy or food being taken away. Education about reduction of animal bite risk can be incorporated into preventive health care counseling by both human health clinicians and veterinarians. Dog bite prevention recommendations by the CDC are summarized in Box 10-5. Other preventive steps include avoiding feeding or handling wild or stray animals (see Exotic and Wildlife Pets in this chapter), and keeping companion animals indoors except for daily, accompanied exercise.\n\nThe clinician caring for a human victim of an animal bite should determine and document in the chart how, where, and when the bite occurred; the species and distinguishing characteristics of the animal; whether the bite was provoked or\n\nFrom Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Dog bite prevention. http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/biteprevention.htm.\n\n\u2022 Consult a professional (e.g., veterinarian, animal behaviorist, or responsible breeder) to learn about suitable breeds of dogs for your household. \u2022 Dogs with histories of aggression are inappropriate in households with children. \u2022 Be sensitive to cues that a child is fearful or apprehensive about a dog and, if so, delay acquiring a dog. \u2022 Spend time with a dog before buying or adopting it. Use caution when bringing a dog into the home with an infant or toddler. \u2022 Spay or neuter virtually all dogs (this frequently reduces aggressive tendencies). \u2022 Never leave infants or young children alone with any dog. \u2022 Do not play aggressive games with your dog (e.g., wrestling). \u2022 Properly socialize and train any dog entering the household. Teach the dog submissive behaviors (e.g., rolling over to expose abdomen and relinquishing food without growling).\n\n\u2022 Immediately seek professional advice (e.g., from veterinarians, animal behaviorists, or responsible breeders) if the dog develops aggressive or undesirable behaviors.\n\n\u2022 Teach children basic safety around dogs and review regularly.\n\n\u2022 Do not approach an unfamiliar dog.\n\n\u2022 Do not run from a dog and scream.\n\n\u2022 Remain motionless (e.g., \"be still like a tree\") when approached by an unfamiliar dog. \u2022 If knocked over by a dog, roll into a ball and lie still (e.g., \"be still like a log\"). \u2022 Do not play with a dog unless supervised by an adult. \u2022 Immediately report stray dogs or dogs displaying unusual behavior to an adult. \u2022 Avoid direct eye contact with a dog. \u2022 Do not disturb a dog who is sleeping, eating, or caring for puppies. \u2022 Do not pet a dog without allowing it to see and sniff you first.\n\n\u2022 If bitten, immediately report the bite to an adult. unprovoked; whether the animal is available for observation; its current location; and relevant veterinary information about the animal, including rabies vaccination status or any other known illnesses. It is also necessary to determine the date of the human patient's most recent tetanus vaccination and any history of medical conditions placing them at increased risk of infection, such as immunocompromised conditions (e.g., HIV), cancer, diabetes, splenectomy, or immunosuppressive drugs. A history of prosthetic joints or heart valves is also an important risk factor for complications in human beings. 1 The human patient should be asked about any allergies to animals or medications. Finally, for both human beings and companion animals, if considering rabies postexposure prophylaxis, determine whether the patient has previously received rabies vaccination, including where and when.\n\nTable 10-9 lists risk factors for animal bite infections. If these risk factors are present, antibiotic prophylaxis appears reasonable. If none of these risk factors is present, antibiotics may be withheld in many cases and the wound rechecked in 48 hours.\n\nA careful head-to-toe physical examination should be performed looking for other signs of trauma. The wound should be carefully explored to assess damage to deeper structures, including joints and bones. A detailed neurovascular examination should be performed to assess damage to nerves and blood vessels. For human beings bitten by an animal, it may be worthwhile to draw a diagram or take a photograph of the wound because many animal bites result in litigation. Children bitten on the neck or head should have cervical immobilization until cervical fractures can be ruled out by radiological studies. 7\n\nFor fresh bite wounds, routine cultures are not necessary. However, if a wound later shows signs of infection such as redness, swelling, or discharge, cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria should be obtained (Figure 10-20) .\n\nFirst-aid for an animal bite should involve control of bleeding and initial cleansing. Bleeding should be controlled with local pressure. Adequate cleaning and irrigation of a bite wound is critical to its management. Initial cleaning can be done immediately after the bite with soap and water. As soon as possible, copious irrigation of the wound with saline solution with an 18-or 19-gauge needle or catheter tip and large syringe should be performed. Many bite wounds involve damage to tissue at the wound edges. Therefore wound tissue that appears devitalized or necrotic should be carefully debrided. 1 In human patients, significant bites to the hand may require reconstructive surgery, and a detailed examination for possible injury to tendons, nerves, and other deeper tissues is warranted. A hand surgeon may need to be consulted, especially if there is any evidence of infection. If there are significant facial lacerations, a plastic surgeon consultation is appropriate.\n\nIf there is concern about involvement of joints and other bony structures, including facial bones and the skull, take radiographs ( Figure 10-21 ) and obtain orthopedic consultation for possible surgical intervention. \n\nWhether to close an animal bite wound with sutures or other technique is controversial. Considerations include risk factors for infection and cosmetic impact of the injury. Dog bites to the face rarely become infected and are often closed to reduce the possibility of disfiguring scars. Wounds that are at high risk of infection (e.g., from a high-risk species, in a high-risk area such as the hand, or in an immunocompromised patient), are more than 24 hours old, or that are already infected generally should not be closed. Lowrisk wounds can be closed, after thorough irrigation, with sutures, staples, or other techniques and observed closely for signs of infection. 8\n\nWhether prophylactic antibiotics are indicated for an animal bite is also controversial, and data regarding the bites of many species are limited. A Cochrane review of antibiotic prophylaxis in uncomplicated dog and cat bites found no clear evidence of benefit. 9 Clinical decision making regarding antibiotic prophylaxis involves assessing the risk of infection. Risk factors include the species responsible for the bite, any information about the health of the animal, the severity and location of the bite, and whether the patient is immunocompromised or has other conditions that increase the risk of infection. High-risk bites include crush injuries that involve devascularized tissue and puncture wounds, hand involvement, significant edema, possible involvement of joints or bones, and proximity to genitalia or prosthetic joints nearby. Patients with very high-risk bites or evidence of tenosynovitis or deep infection should be admitted for parenteral antibiotics and hospital observation. Immunocompromised individuals and those with asplenia or compromising medical conditions should receive prophylactic antibiotics for most animal bites. Table 10 -10 provides recommendations for empiric antibiotic dosing for animal bites to human beings. Dog bites usually do not become infected. Reported infection rates range from 5% to 15%. 10 Cat bites often involve deep puncture wounds that are prone to infection. Infection rates from cat bites may be as high as 80%. 11 The choice of antimicrobial prophylaxis for cat bites and high-risk dog bites should cover Pasteurella, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus. A 5-to 7-day course of antibiotics should be administered. Ferret bites are increasing in frequency with their popularity as pets and their tendency to bite. Little is known about their microbial flora. Pig bites are considered to carry a high risk for infection. 12 Alligators and related species tend to inflict severe bites and have polymicrobial flora that can lead to infection. 13 Many snake bites do not become infected. 7 Two controlled trials of prophylactic antibiotics for pit viper envenomation did not show a clinical benefit. 14, 15 Nevertheless, snake bites should be monitored for potential infection. 16 Iguana bites can be severe and infection has been reported. 17 Human bites to another human are considered high-risk bites for infection. In addition to bacterial pathogens (see Table 10 -10), risk of infection with bloodborne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis B should be considered.\n\nThe risk of rabies should be assessed in every animal bite situation in a human or pet, with rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for high-risk bites provided. 18 However, studies have shown that rabies PEP is often given inappropriately by clinicians treating bites in emergency care settings, such as when the biting animal is low risk or available for observation or testing (see Chapter 9) . 19 The biting animal should be captured and monitored for 10 days for signs of rabies if it is a dog, cat, or ferret; for 14 days if livestock; or euthanized and tested if a rabies vector species (e.g., bat, raccoon, skunk, fox) or other wild carnivore such as a river otter ( Figure  10-22 ). If animal rabies testing is positive or if the animal is not available for observation or testing and is a high-risk rabies species, PEP should be provided to the patient.\n\ntetanus Tetanus status should be determined in all human bite patients. A booster should be provided for a low-risk bite if the patient was not vaccinated within the past 10 years and for a high-risk bite if the patient was not vaccinated within the past 5 years. If there is not a history of at least 3 tetanus vaccinations in the past (for an adult), tetanus immune globulin should also be given. Table 10 -11 details these recommendations. \n\nClinicians should be familiar with a number of specific biteassociated infections.\n\nPasteurella multocida is the most common agent isolated from infected dog and cat wounds (Figure 10-23) . It causes cellulitis and can cause bacteremia with sepsis, meningitis, and hemorrhagic complications. Pasteurella wound infections tend to develop rapidly, producing swelling, redness, tenderness, and discharge at the wound area within 12 to 24 hours after the bite. 20 Tenosynovitis and osteomyelitis can develop and should be aggressively treated with parenteral antibiotics.\n\nRat-bite fever from Streptobacillus moniliformis in human beings was traditionally a disease of inner-city children bitten by peridomestic rodents. With the popularity of rats as pets and the use of rats in laboratories, cases now occur in pet store employees, pet owners, and laboratory animal workers. The disease causes a rash (Color Plate 10-8) that may be petechial, hemorrhagic, or purpuric, as well as fever, and systemic symptoms including arthralgias. Without treatment, the case fatality rate can be 10%. Most domestic and wild rats carry the causative agent, S. moniliformis, in their oral flora. Up to an estimated 10% of rat bites can become infected. 21 Patients with rat bites need to be counseled about the signs and seriousness of this disease, and prophylactic antibiotics should be considered for infectionprone bites. S. moniliformis in guinea pigs causes cervical lymphadenitis or granulomatous pneumonia; in mice, purulent lesions and acute septicemia; and endocarditis or septic arthritis in nonhuman primates. \n\nCapnocytophaga canimorsus is found in dog and cat saliva (especially the former). In asplenic and immunocompromised human beings, it can produce septicemia with meningitis, endocarditis, and eye involvement. 22 Serious infections have also been reported in persons with no apparent risk factors. 23 The first known animal with a Capnocytophaga-infected dog bite wound, a pet rabbit, was successfully treated. 24\n\nHerpes B infection causes an often fatal viral meningoencephalitis that can be transmitted to human beings from Old World monkeys of the genus Macaca ( Figure  10 -24; see Chapter 12). 25 Although there have been no controlled trials of prophylaxis, the B Virus Working Group recommends antiviral prophylaxis for high-risk bites (or other exposures) from these monkeys. The recommended prophylactic regimen is 1 g valacyclovir three times a day for adults, excluding pregnant women. An alternative regimen is 800 mg acyclovir five times a day. Prophylaxis should begin as soon as possible after exposure. If signs of herpes B infection appear, systemic treatment with antivirals and hospitalization are necessary. 26 Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis LCMV can be present in the saliva of rodents, especially mice, and can pose a risk after a bite (see Chapter 9) . Fetal complications can occur in pregnant women and severe disease in immunocompromised persons. Therefore pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals should avoid rodent exposure.\n\nSporotrichosis is a fungal disease (Color Plate 10-9) that can produce ulcerating skin nodules and systemic infection (rare). It is usually acquired from contact with plants or soil but has been reported in association with cat bites and scratches (with an outbreak of more than 1000 cats and 500 persons in Brazil 27 ) and after a squirrel bite. 28 Veterinarians are at increased risk of occupational infection. Sporothrix schenckii has also been reported in horse and dog lesions.\n\nBartonella infection can be transmitted by cat bites and scratches (see Chapter 9).\n\nAs in human beings, immunocompromised conditions (such as FIV/FeLV in feline patients) predispose an animal to bite-related infection. Pet dogs, cats, and ferrets that are bitten by potentially or known rabid animals should be managed according to their rabies vaccination status. If they are currently vaccinated, a booster vaccine should be immediately administered and the pet should be observed for 45 days for signs of rabies. If the pet is unvaccinated, it should be euthanized or held in strict isolation for 180 days and provided a rabies vaccine 1 month before release from quarantine. Certain domestic animals such as rabbits are at risk of wildlife rabies if caged outside or allowed to roam outside. 29 Table 10 -12 provides recommended antibiotic therapy for animal bite infections in dogs and cats. Depending on the severity of the bite, other treatment modalities, including physical therapy, may be required for rehabilitation of the animal (Figure 10 "}
