Continuous variables were expressed as medians with their inter-quartile ranges (IQR).\n\nThe associated factors influencing the consumption of bat meat and visitation of caves were assessed by entering all variables that were significant at p < 0.1 from the bivariate analysis into an unconditional multiple logistic regression model. A backward stepwise approach was used for selection of significant variables from the model. All results were expressed as adjusted odd ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI). For all analysis, a twosided p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The proportions of respondents who reported either Yes or No for each categorical variable were compared across the three communities using Fischer's exact test or Chi-square test (X 2 ) where appropriate. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All p-values less than 0.001 were abbreviated to \"< 0.001\". \"df\" denotes degrees of freedom. "}
