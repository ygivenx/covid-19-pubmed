{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Lower respiratory tract infection in the community: associations between viral aetiology and illness course", "body": "From the few studies describing the aetiology of acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in 62 primary care patients, we know that most LRTIs in the general community are caused by viral 63 pathogens, in particular rhinovirus, influenza virus, coronavirus (CoV), respiratory syncytial virus 64 (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and parainfluenza virus (PiV)(1,2). The illness course of LRTIs in adults presenting in this setting -a relatively healthy, working population -is mostly self-66 limiting and complications are rare(3). However, with an average of 3.5 days sick leave per year,\n\nLRTIs cause a substantial socio-economic burden (3, 4) . In adults, influenza virus, bacteria, and 68 viral-bacterial coinfections are assumed to cause the most severe illnesses, with most systemic 69 symptoms, longest illness durations, and most complications(5-7). However, evidence on 70 associations between aetiology and severity are mainly derived from hospital care settings with 71 vulnerable patient populations (8) (9) (10) . In this setting, a focus on pathogens with the highest 72 complication rates is obvious. Quite often, however, this focus is also applied in the general 73 community, with public health interventions as the annual influenza vaccinations targeted at the 74 most vulnerable people with the aim of reducing the risk of complications and death(11). Although 75 data on the impact of respiratory viruses in the primary care setting are limited due to restricted 76 microbial testing and absence of a standardized, validated outcome measure to evaluate illness 77 severity(12), there are studies suggesting that the burden of disease from infections due to 78 respiratory viruses other than influenza -i.p. rhinovirus, coronavirus and RSV -may be greater 79 overall(13). In this study, we aimed to explore the associations between respiratory viral 80 pathogens, including viral load, and illness course in the adult primary care community, thereby 81 opening up possibilities to base the public health focus on the impact of respiratory viruses in 82 primary care, rather than on extrapolated data from hospital settings. This study was conducted in\n\nThis prospective study in primary care is part of the GRACE study (Genomics to combat between November 2007 and April 2010 by general practitioners (GPs) from 16 primary care 90 networks in 11 European countries (Supplementary Figure 1) . Patients aged \u226518 years presenting 91 with acute cough (duration of \u226428 days) and/or suspected LRTI, were asked to participate in this 92 study, i.e. to fill out study materials and provide written informed consent(14). Exclusion criteria 93 were pregnancy, breast-feeding, any serious immunocompromised condition and antibiotic use in 94 the previous month (14). About one third of these patients agreed to being randomised to either the 95 intervention (amoxicillin) or placebo arm of the original randomized controlled trial (14). Remaining 96 patients were not randomly assigned, but were included in the observational part of the study(1). In 97 the current study, both trial and observational patients were analysed together, but patients without 98 PCR and/or serology results on viral aetiology (all due to practical reasons) were excluded. Ethical 99 approval was obtained for all participating networks.\n\nClinical measurements\n\nFor the collection of clinical data on the day of presentation (baseline), standardized case report forms (CRFs) were used. GPs completed the CRF on the following 12 symptoms rated by the 104 patients using a 4-point Likert-scale (1=no problem, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe): cough, At baseline, two nasopharyngeal flocked swabs were taken by trained staff within 24 hours after 116 recruitment and before any antimicrobial treatment had started. Swabs were placed in universal 117 transport medium immediately, frozen locally, and transported on dry ice to the central laboratory performed either as four multiplex and RSV; \n\np=0.02) were not detected more frequently in symptomatic patients than in controls, they were not 127 considered pathogenic respiratory viruses and therefore excluded from our analyses(1). A cycle 128 threshold (Ct) value -an inverse, logarithmic, quantitative measurement of viral load -below 45 129 was chosen as cut-off for a positive result. We adjusted our analyses for bacterial infections, which 130 were defined as having at least one of the following pathogens detected in a sputum or 131 nasopharyngeal sample: Streptococcus species, Gram-negative species, or Aspergillus (fungus).\n\nCommensals and Candida species were considered contaminants for which analyses were not 133 adjusted. Microbiologists who determined the results were blinded to clinical information.\n\nOutcome parameters\n\nWe focused on two main outcome parameters: symptom severity at presentation and illness 137 duration. Symptom severity was measured as the mean CRF score for all 12 symptoms (scored 1-138 4) at baseline (14, (17) (18) (19) . Illness duration was defined as the duration until absence of any 139 symptoms rated moderately bad or severe (score 3 or above) in the symptom diary following initial\n\nSymptom severity at baseline was analysed with linear regression models and expressed as 146 differences in mean symptom severity with a 95% confidence interval (CI). In an additional step, \n\npresentation was 2.09 (95%CI 2.07-2.11). Respiratory viruses (1,411) Table 2) . Among patients in 180 whom a virus was detected, a ten cycles lower Ct value -i.e. a higher viral load -measured at 181 presentation, was associated with a 0.11 (95%CI 0.06-0.16) point higher mean symptom severity 182 as compared to patients without detected virus. After stratification for viral aetiology, we only 183 observed an association between viral load and symptom severity for rhinovirus (increase of 0.12 184 per 10 cycles reduction in Ct value, 95%CI 0.04-0.20) and for RSV (increase of 0.16 per 10 cycles symptoms of these viruses (Figure 3) , influenza virus was independently associated with severe generally unwell (OR 2.5, 95%CI 1.8-3.5), and interference with daily activities (OR 2.5, 95%CI 190 1.8-3.5). RSV was associated with severe headache (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.2-3.5), disturbed sleep (OR 191 1.7, 95%CI 1.1-2.5) and a runny nose (OR 2.9, 95%CI 1.9-4.4). hMPV was associated with severe 192 dyspnoea (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.0-3.7) and headache (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1-3.7). Rhinovirus was 193 associated with severe wheeze (OR 1.6, 95%CI 1.0-2.6), a runny nose (OR 1.6, 95%CI 1.2-2.1) 194 and negatively associated with severe cough (OR 0.8, 95%CI 0.6-0.9). CoV was associated with a \n\nFinally, a higher viral load was associated with a higher symptom severity at presentation. Looking 266 at specific viruses we only found this association for RSV and rhinovirus, which confirms previous technique, they also rise and drop rapidly and it is known that symptoms mostly follow the viral load(30,31).\n\nIn conclusion, in this study among relatively healthy adult patients presenting in a primary care "}
