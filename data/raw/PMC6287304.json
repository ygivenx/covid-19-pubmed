{"title": "Xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonates with potent antiviral activity against varicella-zoster virus and human cytomegalovirus", "body": "The concentration and ratio of purine nucleotides and deoxynucleotides in the nucleotide pool is highly regulated in order to maintain the proper function and genetic stability of mammalian cells.1 Imbalances in (deoxy)nucleotide pool may have mutagenic consequences2 and may lead to various diseases, such as combined immunodeficiency (loss of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) function),3 hyperuricemia (loss of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) function)4 or cancer (uncontrollable activity of inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase, IMPDH).5\n\nXanthosine monophosphate (XMP, 1, Figure 1) is an important intermediate in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and its concentration is essential for the maintenance of guanine nucleotide pool,6 where XMP serves as a substrate for guanosine monophosphate synthase,7 that produces guanosine monophosphate (GMP). XMP is formed either from inosine monophosphate (IMP) by IMPDH or via salvage pathway using hypoxanthine or xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase. The XMP level is regulated by 5\u2032-nucleotidase that hydrolyzes XMP to xanthosine.\n\nIn contrast, the corresponding deoxyribonucleotide analogues, dXMP (2, Figure 1) and dXTP, are catabolic products of dGMP and dGTP enzymatic hydrolysis, or can be formed by defective purine nucleotide metabolism (involving deaminase enzymes),8 or by chemical hydrolysis9 of dGMP/dGTP via NOx-mediated nitrosative stress.10 These processes can lead to a substantial incorporation of xanthine nucleotides into DNA and/or RNA,8 and subsequently to RNA miscoding and mutagenesis.11 Moreover, deaminated nucleotides can interfere with RNA editing12 and with functions of noncoding RNAs.13\n\nUnder cell physiological homeostasis, the concentration and ratio of potentially mutagenic nucleotide intermediates, such as (d)IDP/(d)ITP/(d)XTP, is maintained by housekeeping enzymes,14 especially those from nudix family such as ITPases/XTPpases,15,16 NUDT16 or ITPA,17 that can hydrolyze corresponding nucleoside di- or triphosphates. The main function of housekeeping enzymes is to prevent or minimize the incorporation of noncanonical nucleotides into DNA/RNA. Unfortunately, the literature on housekeeping enzymes hydrolyzing dXDP/dXTP has been quite rare up to date.\n\nHerpesviruses18 are DNA-containing enveloped viruses from large Herpesviridae family and include herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Although current anti-herpetic therapy uses powerful antivirotics such as nucleoside analogues (acyclovir (ACV), penciclovir, vidarabine, and ganciclovir (GCV)), acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (ANP) cidofovir (CDV) (3, Figure 1),19 or diphosphate mimic foscarnet,20 many drug insensitive viruses have been identified in the clinics. The origin of virus resistance for HSV, VZV or CMV comes mostly from treatment using DNA polymerase inhibitors, such as ACV and GCV, where various alterations in the viral thymidine kinase gene [UL23 (HSV) and ORF36 (VZV)], protein kinase [UL97 (CMV)] and/or viral DNA polymerase gene [UL30 (HSV), ORF28 (VZV) and UL54 (CMV)] may occur.21\u201323 As recent literature has shown,24 the presence of resistant herpesviruses should be considered seriously not only in the case of immunocompromised individuals. Evidently, there is an urgent need for novel potent anti-herpetic agents with high barrier of resistance development.\n\nANPs,25 mimics of natural nucleotides (avoiding the first phosphorylation step), represent a potent group of antiviral agents. ANPs are converted inside the cells to their diphosphates (ANPpp) that target DNA polymerase \u2013 viral and/or cellular.19 These nucleoside triphosphate analogues act as competitive inhibitors and/or alternative substrates of the respective enzymes, in the later case leading to termination of DNA chain elongation.19 Although some ANPs derived from xanthine were studied before as potential antiviral agents (namely the 9-[3-fluoro-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] derivative, FPMPX),26 the general lack of interest in such compounds was probably caused by their relatively complicated synthesis, since simple alkylation of xanthine base was expected to give a mixture of several regioisomers as well as polyalkylated products. Recently, we have reported27 a simple and high-yielding synthesis of xanthine ANPs exploiting the MW-assisted hydrolysis of the corresponding 2,6-dichloropurine derivatives. Here, we report the synthesis and antiviral evaluation of a series of xanthine-based ANPs (compounds 4\u20139, Figure 1), designed as non-hydrolyzable analogues of dXMP/XMP.\n\nThe synthesis of 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]xanthine (PMEX, 4, Scheme 1), a xanthine analogue of the well-known antiviral agent adefovir (PMEA),28 has been reported by our group earlier.27 The microwave-assisted hydrolysis of 2,6-dichloropurine derivative 1029 in aqueous HCl afforded the desired xanthine compound 4 in a 85% yield.\n\nFor the synthesis of other target ANPs, compounds 5\u20139 (Scheme 2), previously reported26,30\u201334 guanine containing ANPs 11\u201315, have been exploited as a starting material. Standard diazotization of compounds 11\u201315 followed by 2-hydroxy-dediazoniation afforded the desired xanthine-based ANPs 5\u20139 in moderate to good yields (36\u201382%).\n\nSince PMEX (4) exhibited promising antiviral properties, we decided to prepare several PMEX prodrugs in order to improve the compound permeability which might be limited for this negatively charged compound. At first, N6-cyclopropylaminopurine derivative 17 (Scheme 3) was prepared in a 75% yield from the corresponding N6-cyclopropyl-2,6-diaminopurine derivative 16,35 using the above mentioned diazotization/2-hydroxy-dediazoniation procedure. Compound 17 was expected to be enzymatically converted (deaminated) to PMEX in an analogy to compound GS-9219 (an acyclic nucleotide analogue with potent antineoplastic activity),36 and abacavir (a carbocyclic nucleoside used for the treatment of HIV infection).37\n\nNext, PMEX hexadecyloxypropyl (HDP) monoester 18 (Scheme 4), a prodrug approach developed by Hostetler et al. as a mimic of natural lipids,38 was prepared from PMEX (4) and hexadecyloxypropyl alcohol via DCC-mediated coupling in a 23% yield. Similarly, phosphonate ester 19 (Scheme 4) bearing a perfluorinated-C12 chain was prepared by the same procedure in a 30% yield. Finally, the bisamidate prodrug 20 (Scheme 4) was obtained in a 13% yield starting from PMEX (4) and isopropyl ester of L-phenylalanine using the previously described procedure developed in our lab.39\n\nIn order to confirm the expected mode of action of PMEX (4), i.e. viral DNA polymerase inhibition, the corresponding phosphonodiphosphate 21 (Scheme 5), as an analogue of natural nucleoside triphosphate, was also prepared. The two-step synthesis via a morpholidate intermediate40 afforded, after the HPLC purification, the desired triphosphate mimic 21 in a low (3%) yield.\n\nThe synthesized xanthine-based ANPs (compounds 4\u20139) were evaluated for inhibitory activity against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses: in human embryonic lung (HEL) cells (herpes simplex virus-1 (KOS strain), herpes simplex virus-2 (G strain), thymidine kinase deficient (ACV resistant) herpes simplex virus-1 (TK\u2013 KOS ACVr), vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (AD-169 strain and Davis strains), VZV (TK+ VZV strain and TK\u2013 VZV strains)), in HeLa cell cultures (vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie virus B4 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)), in Vero cell cultures (para-influenza-3 virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, Punta Toro virus, yellow fever virus), in CrFK cell cultures (feline corona virus (FIPV)), and in MDCK cell cultures (influenza A virus (H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes) and influenza B virus). GCV, CDV, ACV, brivudin (BVDU), zalcitabine, zanamivir, alovudine, amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, dextran sulfate (molecular weight 10000, DS-10000), mycophenolic acid, Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA), and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) were used as the reference compounds. The antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50, i.e. compound concentration required to decrease virus plaque formation (VZV) or virus-induced cytopathogenicity (other viruses) by 50%. While none of the compounds showed any activity against RNA viruses, compounds 4, 5 and 6 were able to inhibit the replication of herpesviruses (Tables 1 and 2). PMEX (4) emerged as the most active compound against VZV and HCMV, being as active as the reference drug ACV against the TK+ Oka strain (EC50 = 2.62 \u00b5M (PMEX) versus 3.42 \u00b5M (ACV)). In contrast to ACV, compound 4 remained active against the TK\u2013 VZV 07\u20131 strain (EC50 = 4.58 \u00b5M). PMEX also inhibited the replication of HCMV with EC50 values of the same order of magnitude as the reference anti-HCMV drug GCV, while PMEX had a 50% cytostatic concentration of 111 \u00b5M for HEL cells. Thus, compound 4 was not only potent but also selective as the calculated selectivity indices (ratio CC50/EC50) were of 24 and 42 (VZV 07\u20131 and Oka strains, respectively) and of 11 and 13 (HCMV AD-169 and Davis strains, respectively). Compounds 5 and 6 were, respectively, 6 to 12 folds and 3 to 8 folds less active than PMEX against VZV and HCMV. However, compounds 4, 5 and 6 inhibited the replication of HSV-1, HSV-2 and TK-HSV-1 at equivalent EC50 values in the range of 16 to 39 \u00b5M. PMEX (4) lacked activity against vaccinia virus, while HPMPX compounds (both S-isomer 6 and racemic mixture 5) were weak inhibitors of this poxvirus (EC50 = 39 \u00b5M, Table 2).\n\nANPs, including PMEX, are polar compounds, showing severely limited bioavailability. To increase the likelihood of good cell wall permeability, several different prodrug approaches were tested for PMEX (Tables 3 and 4). Compound 17 was completely inactive in all assays. Phosphonate ester 19 and biamidate prodrug 20 did not display any potent anti-herpesvirus activity which might be explained by insufficient prodrug activation in these cells. The HDP-PMEX prodrug 18 proved to be 7 to 26 folds (VZV), 52 to 170 folds (HCMV) and 6 to 12 folds (HSV) more active compound than the parent compound 4, although a concomitant increase in its cytostatic activity of 11-fold was also observed indicating successful increase in the cell uptake.\n\nIn order to determine whether the DNA polymerase was the actual target of action of PMEX (4), the compound was evaluated against well-characterized HSV-1 mutant viruses. Alike all ANPs, PMEX remained active against viruses bearing mutations in the viral TK (Figure 2). Importantly, an increase in the EC50 of PMEX of the same magnitude as that measured for the ANP adefovir28 was found for DNA polymerase mutant viruses indicating that the target of action of the active form of compound 4 (i.e. PMEXpp) is the herpesvirus DNA polymerase.\n\nThe inhibitory activity of the diphosphate form of PMEX (PMEXpp, 21) was evaluated in an enzymatic assay against herpes (VZV and HCMV) DNA polymerases compared to cellular (\u03b1 and \u03b2) DNA polymerases (Table 5). The inhibition of ACV triphosphate and the pyrophosphate analogue of foscarnet (PFA) were determined in this study for comparison. Compound 21 was not inhibitory towards cellular DNA polymerases, while it inhibited VZV DNA polymerase when dGTP was used as the competitive radiolabeled substrate (IC50 = 7.4 \u00b5M). However, no activity at the highest concentration of 21 (100 \u00b5M) could be detected against HCMV DNA polymerase when either dGTP or dTTP were used as the competitive radiolabeled substrates. These data suggest that compound 21 is a poor inhibitor of HCMV DNA polymerase or that the compound may require the HCMV DNA polymerase interact with other proteins of the replication complex to be active. It is also possible that PMEX or its metabolite targets another viral enzyme. To confirm that the compound targets the viral DNA polymerase, PMEX-resistant herpesviruses should be selected under the pressure of PMEX and characterized both genotypically and phenotypically.\n\nStarting compounds and other chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers or prepared according to the published procedures. Solvents were dried by standard procedures. Solvents were evaporated at 40 \u00b0C/2 kPa. Analytical TLC was performed on plates of Kieselgel 60 F 254 (Merck). Column chromatography was performed on silica gel 230\u2013400 mesh, 60 \u00c5 (Merck). Reverse phase HPLC separation was performed on a Waters Delta 600 instrument with a Waters 486 Tunable Absorbance Detector using column Phenomenex Gemini C18 (10 \u03bcm, 250 \u00d7 21.2 mm, flow 10 ml/min preparative column). NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 500 (1H at 500 MHz, 13C at 125.8 MHz, 31P at 202.4 MHz,) spectrometer with TMS or 1,4-dioxane (3.75 ppm for 1H, 67.19 ppm for 13C NMR) as internal standard or referenced to the residual solvent signal. HR MS spectra were taken on a LTQ Orbitrap XL spectrometer. The purity of the tested compounds was determined by HPLC (H2O-CH3CN, linear gradient) and was higher than 95%.\n\nSynthesis of compound 4 was performed from compound 10 (2.0 g, 4.86 mmol), using previously described procedure.27 Microwave-assisted heating (130 \u00b0C, 20 min) of compound 10 in aqueous HCl (1.0 M), followed by solvent removal and precipitation form a water/methanol mixture gave 4 (1.2 g, 85%) as a white solid.

Then, a solution of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (825 mg, 4.0 mmol) in t-BuOH/H2O (48 mL, 5/1, v/v) was added dropwise to the boiling reaction mixture over a period of 1 h. The mixture was heated to 100 \u00b0C overnight. After cooling down, solids were filtered off, and the mixture was concentrated up to half of the volume, and diluted with water (200 ml). The aqueous solution was extracted with diethyl ether (3 \u00d7 10 mL) and the organic layer was dried (Na2SO4) and evaporated to dryness. Crude morpholidate was used directly for the pyrophosphate coupling.\n\nPyrophosphate coupling: Prepared morpholidate (0.2 mmol) was carefully dried over P2O5 and treated with (NHBu3)2H2P2O7 (0.5 M solution in DMF, 3 ml) at room temperature for 48 h. The product was precipitated with diethyl ether (10 ml) and the solid was washed with diethyl ether (10 ml). The precipitated product was dissolved in 0.05 M TEAB (4 ml) and purified on a column packed with POROS\u00ae 50 HQ (50 ml) with use of a gradient of TEAB in water (0.05\u20130.5 M). The product was co-evaporated several times with water and converted into a sodium salt form (Dowex 50 in Na+ cycle).

HRMS(ESI\u2013) m/z (C8H11O12N4NaP3) [M-H]\u2013: calcd. 470.9489; found 470.9488.\n\nThe compounds were evaluated against different herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) strain KOS, thymidine kinase-deficient (TK\u2013) HSV-1 KOS strain resistant to ACV (ACVr), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) strain G, VZV strain Oka, TK\u2013 VZV strain 07\u20131, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strains AD-169 and Davis as well as vaccinia virus, adeno virus-2, vesicular stomatitis virus, para-influenza-3 virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, Punta Toro virus, RSV, FIPV and influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 (A/PR/8), H3N2 (A/HK/7/87) and influenza B virus (B/HK/5/72). The antiviral assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey kidney cells (Vero), human epithelial cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa), Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells (CRFK), or Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 PFU, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or compound concentration required reducing virus-induced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.\n\nCompound 4 was evaluated against several TK and DNA polymerase mutants derived from the reference Kos strain by CPE reduction assay using as reference drugs ACV, GCV, BVDU, foscavir, CDV and adefovir (ADV).\n\nCytotoxicity of the tested compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology. Alternatively, the cytostatic activity of the test compounds was measured based on the inhibition of cell growth. HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 \u00d7 103 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After three days of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC50, or the compound concentration required reducing cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls.\n\nThe inhibitory effects of PMEXpp on human (\u03b1 and \u03b2) and viral (VZV and HCMV) DNA polymerases were determined as previously described using activated calf thymus DNA, 100 \u00b5M of each of the three unlabeled dNTPs, and 0.5 \u00b5M of the rate limiting tritium-labeled dNTP, and serial dilutions of PMEXpp (21). Foscarnet pyrophosphate and acyclovir triphosphate (ACV\u2013TP) were included as the reference compound. The 50% inhibitory concentration or compound concentration required to inhibit the polymerase-catalyzed DNA synthesis by 50% was then determined.\n\nA series of novel ANPs bearing xanthine as a nucleobase was prepared and evaluated for their potential antiviral properties. Two synthetic approaches were exploited for the synthesis of the target compounds: (a) recently developed MW-assisted hydrolysis of 2,6-dichloropurine derivatives and (b) well-established diazotization/2-hydroxy-dediazoniation of the corresponding guanine analogues. All prepared ANPs were tested against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses. Two compounds exhibited antiviral activity. PMEX (4) was active against VZV, HCMV, HSV-1, and HSV-2 (with EC50 values between 2.6 and 25.6 \u00b5M), while HPMPX (both as S-isomer 6 and as a racemic mixture 5) exhibited moderate to weak activity (EC50 in the range of 17\u201343 \u00b5M) against VZV, HCMV, HSV-1, HSV-2, and Vaccinia virus. PMEX (4) was the most active compound against VZV in the series (EC50 = 2.62 \u00b5M, TK+ Oka strain) and was equipotent to the reference drug ACV (EC50 = 3.42 \u00b5M). In contrast to ACV, PMEX (4), as ANP which activity is independent of the first phosphorylation step, remained active against the TK\u2013 VZV 07\u20131 strain with EC50 = 4.58 \u00b5M. The hexadecyloxypropyl monoester derivative of PMEX, compound 18, slightly improved the anti-HSV potency of the parent compound (EC50 values between 1.8 and 4.0 \u00b5M). Further studies of PMEX (4) and of its diphosphate analogue PMEXpp (21) suggested that the compound acts as the inhibitor of herpesvirus DNA polymerases (HSV-1 and VZV). This study represents the first report of xanthine containing ANPs with potent antiviral properties and urges further studies of various xanthine nucleotide analogues as potential antiviral agents."}
