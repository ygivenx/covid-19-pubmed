To date, no agents have been reported to be effective After viral entry to the host cells, the coronavirus messenger RNA is first translated to yield the 94 polyproteins, which are subsequently cleaved by two viral proteinases, 3C-like protease (3CLP, aka 95 nsp5 or Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLP, or nsp3), to yield non-structural proteins essential for 96 viral replication. 21 Inhibitors that suppress the activity of these proteases may inhibit viral replication 97 and offer a revenue for the HCoV-19 therapy. inflammation and promotes mucosal healing. 32 Third, as a pan-PDE inhibitor, DIP may prevent 105 acute injury and progressive fibrosis of the lung, heart, liver, and kidney. 33 Here we provide three 106 levels of evidence advocating DIP as a therapy. In silico and in vitro, we demonstrated that DIP 107 possessed anti-HCoV-19 effects. In a VSV-induced pneumonia model, we also confirmed that DIP 108 elicited potent antiviral immunity and significantly improved the survival rate. In a small clinical 109 cohort, we found that DIP adjunctive therapy led to increased circulating lymphocyte and platelet 110 counts and lowered D-dimer levels, and markedly improved clinical outcomes.\n\nFree energy perturbation and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay 114 We virtually screened an FDA-approved drug database using the HCoV-19 protease Mpro as a target 115 and validated the binding affinity by the SPR assay. DIP (PubChem CID: 3108, Figure S1 ) was 116 identified as a lead drug. In order to obtain the binding pattern and calculate the binding free energy 117 .

To add the restraints, 12 \u03bb values were used.\n\nTherefore, a total of 28 windows for complex and 16 windows for ligand systems were employed, The pGEX4T1-Mpro plasmid was constructed (Atagenix, Wuhan) and transfected the E. coli strain 132 BL21 (Codonplus, Stratagene). GST-tagged protein was purified by GST-glutathione affinity 133 chromatography and cleaved with FXa. The purity of recombinant protein was greater than 95% as 134 judged by SDS-PAGE. The binding of DIP to Mpro was measured by the Biacore 8K system (GE CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\n(which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20027557 doi: medRxiv preprint at 10 \u00b5L/min for 3 min (1800 response units), which followed by a blocking step using ethanolamine 140 (1 M, pH 8.5) at 10 \u00b5L/min for 7 min.

Hydrophobic and hydrogen bond (H-bond) interactions are the main 231 driving forces for the binding between DIP and Mpro. According to the free energy perturbation 232 calculation, the binding free energy of \uf044Gpred was -6.34 kcal/mol. An SPR assay was carried out to 233 validate the in silico result. This has revealed that DIP bound to Mpro with an experimentally 234 confirmed affinity of 34 \u00b5M (KD,eq) ( Figure 1A-B) .\n\nTo demonstrate directly that DIP suppresses HCoV-19 replication, we measured the viral titers using 245 Published studies have shown that DIP possessed broad spectrum activity to a wide range of viruses, 246 indicating that it may elicit antiviral immunity from the host cells. We examined these using two Table 2) .\n\nThe baseline temperature was higher and the oxygenation status was worse in the DIP-treated group 285 than those in the control group, however, temperature and oxygenation were stabilized in the mild 286 and severe patients from both groups after one day of treatment ( Figure S2) . Furthermore, we 287 observed a continuously increased trend in lymphocyte counts and significantly increased platelet (Table 1) . We measured dynamic 293 .

A 70-year-old 298 man with very low oxygen saturation and has suffered from hypoxia and multiorgan dysfunction at All patients had chest CT scans and showed typical multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the 310 lungs before the treatment. In the DIP treated patients, the lesions had varied degree of absorption.\n\nTypical findings following DIP treatment was illustrated in one of the severe COVID-19 patient who 312 had taken sequential CT scans (Figure 4) .
