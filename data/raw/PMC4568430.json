{"title": "H1N1 Influenza Pandemic in Italy Revisited: Has the Willingness to Get Vaccinated Suffered in the Long Run?", "body": "There is already a broad body of research that addresses the influence of various factors on a vaccination decision. A review of 60 international empirical studies on population reactions to recent pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian flu (H5N1) and H1N1 finds that the elderly adopt more protective behaviours including vaccination than younger people.25 Further, women adopt more protective behaviours other than vaccination but are less willing to get immunised than men.25 The variables perceived susceptibility to an infection, fear of severe consequences and trust in the effectiveness of a vaccine are also positively linked to the likelihood of adopting preventive measures including vaccination.25 The same goes for anxiety, trust in authorities and past protective behaviours.25 Kwon et al. pronounce also that beliefs about the safety of a vaccine play a paramount role in predicting behaviour.26\n\nAs can be seen, most research focuses on socio-demographic, perceptual, psychological or attitudinal predictor variables and thus makes this a well-studied field.27-29 Psychological variables include character traits such as anxiety or self-efficacy; an attitudinal variable can for instance be trust in government. A chief interest also lies with the perceptual variables. However, in most of the research the perceptual and behavioural predictors as well as the consequences refer to the same disease. The finding that past vaccination against the seasonal flu predicts an intention to get vaccinated against the new flu is an exception to this.24,30 Another exception are studies that attempt to predict vaccination behaviour with regard to a future hypothetical influenza pandemic. So far, there is not much research investigating this aspect. Only a few studies used hypothetical influenza pandemics to examine predictors of precautionary behaviours, ranging from personal measures such as wearing face masks, taking antiviral drugs and finally getting vaccinated to precautionary social behaviour like avoiding crowds.12,31-33 The investigated perceptual predictors in these studies refer, however, to the same hypothetical situation, not to any real experiences with actual threats. To date, there is only one study that links the specific real experiences and perceptions in living through a pandemic threat (H1N1) to a future hypothetical pandemic infection in order to study secondary effects of the past threat on willingness to seek vaccination in the future.34 Yet, this study compares the public threat perception and the anticipated response to a future pandemic before and shortly after the H1N1 pandemic.34 Therefore, no conclusions about potential long-term secondary effects of the 2009/10 pandemic can be made. Moreover, the authors did not take into account the public\u2019s perception of the institutional performance in handling the pandemic. Further, results from Italy are scarce. Prati et al.35 indeed examined the perception of the pandemic threat on recommended behaviours in Italy but did not include vaccination. As immunization is by far the most efficacious protection against an influenza virus, the present article is concerned with the willingness to get vaccinated when the next influenza pandemic hits. To our knowledge this is the first study to assess the long-term secondary effects of personal experience with the H1N1 pandemic of 2009/10 and the perception of the institutional reaction to it on people\u2019s readiness to get vaccinated during another influenza pandemic in an European country.\n\nThe first research question therefore asks: How high is the readiness to get vaccinated against a novel pandemic influenza virus more than two years after the H1N1 pandemic?\n\nIn line with earlier research on behavioural and perceptual variables we expect the willingness to get vaccinated against a future influenza pandemic will be higher among those who got vaccinated against H1N1 (Hypothesis 1a) and those who are normally vaccinated against the seasonal flu (Hypothesis 1b), as compared to those who did not get vaccinated. It will also be higher among those who were afraid to be personally infected with the H1N1 virus (Hypothesis 2a) and those who feared life-threatening consequences (Hypothesis 2b), as compared to people who did not share these beliefs. Hypothesizing an effect of assessments of institutional performance on the intention to get vaccinated is difficult. A person might think institutions performed poorly in dealing with H1N1 and therefore not be willing to adhere to calls for vaccination issued by the very same institutions. Another person with the same negative assessment of institutional performance might conclude vaccination, in the face of incompetence or carelessness, is reasonable, provided it does no harm. As both ways of thinking appear to be realistic, we formulate research question 2: What is the effect of the assessment of institutional performance in the H1N1 pandemic on the intention to get vaccinated during a new influenza pandemic?\n\nPotential participants were approached in the waiting room of the Registry Office of the Municipality of Milan, Italy, that keeps record of the resident population of the city. Three medical doctors, trained for the purpose of conducting the interviews, asked incoming persons to take part in the survey. After the respondents gave their informed consent they were immediately administered the questions face-to-face. Only persons without command of Italian were excluded. An interview lasted from ten to 30 minutes, depending on the comprehensiveness of the participants\u2019 answers and his or her memory of the H1N1 pandemic. Approximately 60 percent of approached persons agreed to participate, leading to a sample size of n=140. Eleven people could not remember the H1N1 pandemic and were therefore not asked any questions for which one needed at least some memory of the pandemic. Sampling took place from October to December 2012.\n\nThe questionnaire was specifically designed for the purpose of this study. In order to assess the comprehensibility and clarity of the questionnaire it was pre-tested with Italian native speakers. The feedback obtained on single mistakable expressions led to a revision of the instrument and was subsequently incorporated into the final version of the questionnaire. As most lay people refer to the H1N1 pandemic as swine flu, this term was used in the questionnaire.\n\nReadiness to get vaccinated in case of a new influenza pandemic was measured in a block of eight protective behaviours. Figure 1 in the results section displays the question wording as well as the distribution of answers.\n\nTwo questions measured past behaviour. One asked whether respondents usually get vaccinated against the seasonal flu (usually I do, in some years, usually not). Vaccination against H1N1 was asked with Have you been vaccinated against the swine flu? (yes, no, don\u2019t know). Further, there were two questions on the personal experience regarding H1N1: In 2009/10, when the swine flu was discussed, were you afraid you might catch it? and Did you think that your life was in danger if you had been infected? Answer options for the two latter questions were again yes, no, don\u2019t know. For analysis, all questions were dichotomised into yes/in some years and no/don\u2019t know or yes and no/don\u2019t know, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, respondents were asked to assess the institutional performance in handling the H1N1 pandemic. The question wording was What do you think of the performance of experts and institutions that had to do with the swine flu? Think of government, administration, physicians, pharmaceutical industry, and the media. In general, did they react adequately to the swine flu or did they not? Answers were possible on a scale from 1 = completely adequately to 5 = completely inadequately. The first two and two last answer options were summarised for purposes of the analysis. There were also open questions that asked respondents to qualitatively assess the single institutions\u2019 behaviour. The results of this part of the study are not part of this article and will not further be discussed here. The interview ended with a range of socio-demographic questions such as gender, age, level of education or level of effort put into one\u2019s own health.\n\nChi-square tests were used to investigate possible associations between past behaviour, experience or performance assessment and future willingness to get vaccinated. Additionally, binary logistic regression was applied to test the effects of the independent variable categories on the outcome variable. All calculations were done using IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 21.\n\nTable 1 gives an overview of the study sample\u2019s socio-demographic characteristics as compared to the Italian population.36,37 When comparing the percentages one can see that the sample is quite similar to the national population with regard to the distribution of age and gender. When considering the educational level it appears that the respondents are better educated than one would expect in a national sample. This might be due the circumstance that the data were collected in Milan, one of Italy\u2019s most important industrial sites.\n\nWhen participants were asked how much effort they routinely put into their own health 11.4% reported to invest nothing at all or hardly anything. More than one third of respondents (36.4%) claimed to put not so much effort into their health and 45.7% estimated their effort as much. Only 6.4% of the sample considered themselves to invest very much in order to stay healthy. When it comes to the adoption of preventive behaviours, 40.0% of respondents report to be willing to seek vaccination during the next influenza pandemic (Table 2). Thus, vaccination is the second most frequently chosen protective behaviour after avoiding larger gatherings of people, as Figure 1 shows. This contrasts rather impressively with 3.1% in our sample who affirmed to have received vaccination against H1N1 back in 2009/10. If those who could not remember whether they were vaccinated against H1N1 are added, the share of vaccinated persons is still not larger than 5.5%. This rather small percentage of people who received the H1N1 vaccine is in line with the share of vaccinated persons on a national level. In sum, there was a national coverage of 4.0% of first and second doses among the Italian target population consisting of healthcare workers, pregnant women, people at high risk under the age of 65, and institutionalised children and adolescents.7\n\nConsidering the seasonal flu vaccinations, 10.1% say they normally receive them, and another 6.2% in some years. This reflects quite well the seasonal influenza vaccination rates on a national level: according to data of the Italian Health Ministry 14.9% of all Italians and 11.4% of residents in Lombardy, the region where Milan is located, received a vaccine against the seasonal influenza virus in 2012-2013.38\n\nThe small number of people who received vaccination against the H1N1 virus in 2009/10 (N=4) created a minor difficulty in testing the relationship between past and future vaccination behaviour: as expected cell counts were very low, the calculation of a Chi-square test was not possible. Instead, Fisher\u2019s exact test was used and yielded an exact significance value of 0.148 (one-sided). This result indicates that past vaccination behaviour during the H1N1 pandemic is not related to the willingness to get vaccinated during a future pandemic. Hypothesis 1a does not receive support although one has to interpret this finding with caution due to the very small N of vaccinated people.\n\nIn contrast, receiving vaccination against the seasonal flu is significantly associated with the future acceptance of pandemic vaccination (Chi-Square=16.045; df=1; P<0.001) and Hypothesis 1b is clearly supported. 76.2% of people who usually or at least in some years get vaccinated against the annual influenza virus would also seek vaccination in case of a new pandemic. In contrast, only 29.9% of respondents who normally do not get immunised against the seasonal flu would change their mind during a pandemic outbreak.\n\nEvery fifth respondent was afraid to catch a H1N1 infection in 2009/10 but only 34.6% of those are willing to get vaccinated if another pandemic influenza occurs. People who were not scared by the last pandemic or cannot remember to have been afraid (79.7% of the sample) are slightly more ready to seek vaccination in case of a new influenza pandemic (38.2%), but the difference is not significant (Chi-Square=0.116; df=1; P=0.734). Hypothesis 2a is therefore not supported. The perception whether one\u2019s own life was in danger in case of a H1N1 infection has an impact on the intention to get vaccinated in future. One third of participants assessed an infection as life threatening, and 57.1% of these would seek vaccination during a novel pandemic. In contrast, only 27.9% of people who did not share this belief would seek vaccination in case of a future influenza pandemic. This difference is significant (Chi-Square=10.291; df=1; P=0.001). Thus, Hypothesis 2b receives support.\n\nThe second research question can be answered that the assessment of the institutional performance during the H1N1 pandemic is not related to willingness to get vaccinated during another one (Chi-Square=3.779; df=2; P=0.151). Most people regarded the handling of the pandemic by institutions as adequate (45.2%) or differentiated between institutions and said that some institutions acted adequately and some did not (40.3%). In both groups majorities would not seek vaccination next time (58.9%, vs. 60.0%). Only 14.5% of respondents assessed the institutional performance as inappropriate. Among those, 83.3% are not willing to get immunised during a new pandemic.\n\nA logistic regression analysis was performed to test whether the univariate relationships hold in multivariate analysis (Table 1). All variables that were significant at a P<0.15 level in the univariate analysis were entered in the binary logistic regression model.15 The regression confirmed the results of the Chi-square tests: the best predictors of future readiness to get vaccinated were having been vaccinated against the seasonal flu in the past (OR=5.18; 95% CI: 1.40 to 19.13) and fear of losing one\u2019s life in case of an infection with H1N1 (OR=4.09; 95% CI: 1.68 to 9.97). Having received vaccination against the H1N1 virus also has a quite large odds ratio of 5.17, but fails to reach significance due to small N (95% CI: 0.30 to 88.36). Again, the willingness to get immunised when a new pandemic emerges was untouched by the assessment of institutional performance. Moreover, socio-demographic variables such as educational level, age, or gender did not have any significant impact on the results.\n\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, the sample is not representative and therefore no generalization to the whole population of Italy is possible. Further, one cannot draw conclusions about people\u2019s willingness to get vaccinated based on other variables than the ones studied such as attitudinal or psychological ones. Nevertheless, this is the first study to examine possible secondary effects of the H1N1 pandemic on future willingness to get vaccinated in a European population as Schwarzinger et al.\u2019s study was conducted in Australia.15 Besides, it would have been fruitful to include more participants in the study who were vaccinated against the H1N1 virus. As only four respondents indicated that they had received the vaccine, the results building on this variable have to be interpreted with caution. However, the low number of vaccinated participants is in line with the generally low H1N1-vaccination rates in Italy and worldwide and thus reflects the actual situation. On the other hand, caution is also called for with regard to the high willingness to get vaccinated next time as respondents might possibly have overestimated their intention due to a mixture of social desirability and a sponsorship effect, the latter having been produced by the fact that the face-to-face interviews were conducted by physicians. As this study could only investigate the effects of the past pandemic on the willingness to get vaccinated during a future hypothetical one it would be interesting to compare our findings with data collected by the time a novel influenza pandemic actually hits."}
