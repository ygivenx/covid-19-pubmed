{"title": "siRNA targeting the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV inhibits virus replication", "body": "SARS-CoV (the SARS-Associated Coronavirus), which is the pathogen of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 1,2 was reported to be a novel member in the coronavirus family. [3] [4] [5] [6] Coronaviruses belong to a family of enveloped viruses containing a single-stranded plussense RNA genome about 30 kb in length with a 5 0 cap structure and a 3 0 polyadenylation tract. 7 In addition to the genomic RNA, virus-infected cells possess subgenomic mRNAs that form a 3 0 coterminal nested set with the genome. The genomic and the subgenomic mRNAs of coronaviruses include an identical 5 0 Leader sequence and common 3 0 -ends, which is a unique characteristic in coronavirus and arterivirus replication. 8 In the process of coronavirus replication, the Leader sequence (from the subgenome) is fused to the mRNA body sequence. The mechanism by which these subgenomic mRNAs are made is not fully understood. However, recent evidence indicates that transcriptionregulating sequences (TRSs) at the 5 0 -end of each gene represent signals that regulate the discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs. 9, 10 Nevertheless, the Leader sequence and the TRSs play critical roles in the gene expression of coronavirus during its replication. 9, 10 By analysis and comparison of the genome sequences of SARS-CoV [11] [12] [13] [14] and other coronaviruses, authors predicted 11, 12 and confirmed 15 a putative 5 0 Leader sequence with similarity to the conserved coronavirus core Leader sequence, 5 0 -CUAAAC-3 0 , 9,10 at the 5 0 -end of the genome. Putative conserved TRS sequences AAAC GAAAC were determined through manual alignment of sequences upstream of potential initiating methionine codons with the region of the coronavirus genome sequence containing the Leader sequence. These predictions suggested that SARS-CoV possessed a similar genome structure and underwent similar replication processes to those of other typical coronaviruses. 11, 12 Therefore, it is of interest to search for a way to block virus replication based on this common feature of the coronavirus.\n\nRNAi technology 16 has been approved as a potential tool 17 to inhibit infectious virus in host cells because siRNA can target and silence important genes required by the virus. 18 In an attempt to inhibit virus replication, authors have demonstrated that siRNA could effectively inhibit poliovirus and Rous sarcoma virus replication. 19, 20 Furthermore, to block HIV replication and infection, siRNAs were designed to target critical genes in the HIV life cycle including p24 (the HIV longterminal repeat), 21, 22 vif, nef, 23 tat and rev. 24, 25 The results showed a very promising inhibition effect on the virus both in cell culture and in mouse models. Using the same methodology, siRNAs were used to inhibit hepatitis C (HCV) or hepatitis B (HBV) replication by targeting the critical genes required for virus replication. [26] [27] [28] [29] These combined results are very promising since they showed inhibition of viral replication in cell cultures as well as in mouse models.\n\nRecent studies have shown that siRNAs could inhibit gene expression and thereby inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in cultured cells. [30] [31] [32] However, these reports focused on the specific genes in the SARS-CoV genome, where there would be a high probability of single nucleic acid changes, 14 leading to reduced effectiveness of siRNA targeting. Therefore, choosing a unique sequence in the SARS-CoV genome will be critical for the successful inhibition of the virus. In this report, we propose to target the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV, which is identical in all SARS-CoV and plays a pivotal role in the gene expression of the virus. We demonstrate the siRNA we generated could effectively and specifically silence gene expression and inhibit SARS-CoV replication in cultured mammalian cells. Our data provide a possible way of using gene therapy for SARS.\n\nCloning of the Leader sequence and design of siRNA Based on the high homologies between genome sequences of BJ01 SARS-CoV (GenBank accession number AY278488) and mouse hepatitis virus and the identification of the Leader sequence from HKU-39849, 11, 12 we predicted the identical Leader sequence of BJ01 SARS CoV (data not shown). To clone the Leader sequence predicted from BJ01 SARS CoV, we performed 5 0 -RACE experiments to confirm the Leader sequence. We then used RT-PCR to obtain the cDNA of the transcripts of different genes of BJ01 SARS-CoV from infected Vero E6 cells. After sequencing, we observed the identical Leader sequence upstream of the ATGs in the different genes ( Figure 1a , GenBank accession numbers AY539954, AY536757, AY536758, AY536759, AY536760), suggesting that the transcripts of different genes in BJ01 SARS-CoV recruited the identical Leader sequence, which is consistent with the report from HKU-39849. 15 The data indicated that the transcript of the S protein contained the Leader sequence directly upstream of the ATG, while the transcripts of other proteins had different nucleotide bases between the ATG and the conserved Leader sequence (eg M protein has 44 more base pairs) ( Figure  1a ). Intriguingly, this Leader sequence was highly conserved between different strains of SARS-CoV, while the other sequences coding for the specific proteins such as S, N, M and E contained various mutations between the different strains (Table 1) . According to this information, the sequence of CCAACCAACCTCGATCTC was selected and designed as the siRNA target for the proper GC/AT ratio and CC structure. To generate the dsRNA based on this sequence, we employed the U6 promoter vector 33 and constructed a 22 bp siRNA through the hairpin (Figure 1b) . The expected hairpin RNA is depicted in Figure 1c .\n\nwith the Leader sequence To test if the vector-based siRNA we designed could silence the expression of genes with the Leader sequence, we used GFP and RFP as reporter genes. We inserted the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV upstream of the first ATG of GFP after the EF-1a promoter (Figure 2a . These data indicate that we can generate GFP or RFP mRNAs with the SARS-CoV Leader sequences from vectors with either the EF-1a or CMV promoter. The RT-PCR results show that the EF-1a or CMV promoter initiated the transcription of mRNA of GFP or RFP with a SARS-CoV Leader sequence (Figure 2b ). We questioned whether these mRNAs could be translated into GFP or RFP proteins. To test this probability, we directly tested the expression of GFP and RFP using a fluorescence microscope in cells transfected with the vectors. The data show that all four vectors could express GFP or RFP properly (Figure 4b) , suggesting that the Leader sequence ahead of the ATG of GFP or RFP did not affect the translation of proteins. Therefore, we directly observed the proteins produced by the mRNA with the Leader sequence. These vectors therefore provided us a model to study degradation of mRNAs using a Leader sequence of SARS-CoV targeting by siRNA. . These data suggest that siRNA targeting the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV specifically led to a decrease in mRNA levels of L-GFP or L-RFP generated by the pEFBos or pDsRed1.1 vectors, implying that siRNA targeting the Leader sequence mediated degradation of mRNA produced by the transfected vectors.\n\nThe advantage of using GFP and RFP is that it facilities the direct observation of the proteins by fluorescence microscopy. To demonstrate that decreased L-GFP mRNA produced less protein, we applied fluorescence microscopy to view the cells cotransfected with pEFBos/ \n\nWe used PCR to verify the clones containing the U6/L-RNAi cassette (Figure 6a ). The cell clones were named Vero E6 (U6/L-RNAi), Vero E6 (U6) and Vero E6 (U6/ GFP-RNAi), respectively. To demonstrate if the siRNA could reduce mRNA abundance of different genes from SARS-CoV in the cultured cells, we infected the cell clones with SARS-CoV (BJ01) with 1 \u00c2 10 6 PFU/well for 2 h. After 24 h, we harvested the cells and detected the different gene transcripts using RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 6b , SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6, Vero E6 (U6) and Vero E6 (U6/GFP-RNAi) cells showed equal amounts of mRNAs, whereas SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 (L-RNAi) cells showed a significant decrease of mRNAs (Figure 6b ). To quantify the results, we scanned the densities of the bands and the data presented in Figure 6c . These figures clearly demonstrate that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence significantly inhibited gene expression of all the detected genes including the S, E, M and N genes of SARS-CoV.\n\nTo further confirm the RT-PCR results, we performed Northern blot analysis using total RNA isolated from infected cells (two titers of SARS-CoV infection). We successfully detected five major transcripts (Figure 7a) , which was consistent with the expected result. 11 We quantitated these five transcripts using the Phosphor-Imager program (Figure 7b) . The data indicate that the mRNAs from cells with the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence were significantly decreased (Figure 7a , comparing lane 4 to lanes 1, 2 and 3, and lane 9 to lanes 6, 7 and 8) as expected. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the siRNA we designed could effectively decrease the expression of genes of SARS-CoV in cultured cells.\n\nTo determine whether the vector-based siRNA could efficiently prevent SARS-CoV replication and infection, we plated the cells in a 24-well plate at a density of 1 \u00c2 10 5 cells/well and infected the cells with 1 \u00c2 10 6 PFU of SARS-CoV (BJ01). After 72 h of culture, to demonstrate the inhibition of SARS-CoV, we stained the cells with crystal violet (Figure 8a ). The results show that the cells infected with SARS-CoV exhibited greater resistance to virus infection, because the Vero E6 (L-RNAi) cells were stained as strongly as the noninfected cells were ( Figure  8a , plates 1 and 3), while the Vero E6, Vero E6 (U6) and Vero E6 (U6/GFP-RNAi) cells stained equally weakly (plates 2, 4 and 5) demonstrating cell destruction.\n\nFurthermore, we viewed the cells for morphological changes (Figure 8b ). Significant cytopathic effects were seen in the plates with the Vero E6 wild-type cell, Vero E6 (U6) cells and Vero E6 (U6/GFP-RNAi) cells (Figure 6e siRNA targeting the Leader sequence is more effective to inhibit SARS-CoV replication than the siRNAs targeting the S gene or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides\n\nWe previously reported that siRNAs targeting the S gene could inhibit SARS-CoV replication; 31 therefore, we questioned whether the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence was more effective than targeting a specific gene. To compare the effectiveness, we used the same amounts of plasmids to transfect Vero E6 cells and measured the virus titers in the supernatant of the cells infected by the same amounts of SARS-CoV. The data (Figure 9a) \n\nreplication dramatically. Interestingly, comparing with the control (U6/GFP-RNAi), the virus titers in cells transfected with U6/S-RNAi1 and U6/S-RNAi2 was 9.4 and 10.9%, while that with U6/L-RNAi was 1.8%, suggesting that U6/L-RNAi had a much stronger inhibitory effect on the virus replication than U6/S-RNAi1 or U6/S-RNAi2 did.\n\nTo address whether the antisense has any effect on the virus replication, we generated antisense oligodeoxynucleotides by directly synthesizing oligodeoxynucleotides. We transfected the same amounts of oligodeoxynucleotides as pBS/U6-L-siRNA (1 mg of DNA each in 24-well plates) in each data culture. The data (Figure 9b) show that one of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (A2) could inhibit the virus to 61.9%, while the other two (A1 and A2) had no effect. Again, the pBS/U6-L-siRNA inhibits the virus to 2.2%. These data clearly indicate that targeting Leader sequences could strongly inhibit SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells.\n\nSARS has emerged as one of the newest severe infectious diseases threatening global travel and having a significant economic impact on various countries. Caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS cannot be treated by the traditional antivirus drugs, although interferons may be useful in therapy. 31, 34, 35 Additional strategies for the control of this disease have been postulated 36 with vaccines potentially being the best approach, but vaccine development will take at least one to several years. 3, 37 Even though we can expect vaccine development, 38, 39 alternative therapeutic methods need to be investigated. 36 In this report, we investigated the possibility of applying siRNA targeting the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV to treat SARS. We demonstrated that this method was powerful in inhibiting SARS-CoV replication by inhibiting gene expression of the virus in cells. Our report, together with others in HIV, HCV and HBV, 20, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] 28, [40] [41] [42] provide hope of directly blocking virus replication in cells.\n\nSARS-associated coronavirus has been classified as a novel number in the coronavirus family. 4, 11, 12 The structure of the virus is similar to the other coronaviruses, which contain S, M, E and N proteins playing important roles in viral entry, replication and pathogenesis. 43 The common feature of the coronaviruses is the similar discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs, regulated by the pretranscribed Leader sequence and the specific TRSs in the genome of the virus. 9,10 The Leader sequence contributes to the regulation of virus gene expression. Therefore, targeting the Leader sequence present in the mRNA of SARS-CoV structural genes, should be a powerful way to control virus replication. Interestingly, we analyzed all the strains of SARS-CoV identified to date and found that the Leader sequence remained almost identical (see Table  1 ). With these advantages, we designed the siRNA to target this Leader sequence of SARS-CoV. Our data show that the siRNA could not only block the expression of a reporter gene fused with the Leader sequence but also inhibited the expressions of SARS-CoV genes in Vero E6 cells, and thereafter inhibited the replication of the SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. We proposed that this would be a powerful tool to prevent SARS-CoV infections in vivo.\n\nIt was previously suggested that coronavirus used the core Leader sequence, 5 0 -CUAAAC-3 0 . [9] [10] [11] [12] 15 In this report, we cloned the transcripts of the four genes from SARS-CoV BJ01 and confirmed the SARS-CoV Leader sequence as CCAGGAAAAGCCAACCAACCTCGA TCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTCTAAACGAAC, which is in line with the report on the HKU-39849 strain. 15 Our observations revealed that this Leader sequence was identical and present in the different genes of SARS-CoV. Our data further indicated that the sequence between the identical Leader sequence and ATG in different transcripts was variable. The S gene has no space between the common Leader sequence and ATG, and the M gene has the longest spacer sequence. This implied that the common Leader sequence had different merging sites to the sequence of different genes in SARS-CoV. Importantly, we observed that this Leader sequence was identical in different strains of SARS-CoV identified to date (Table 1) , while the other sequences of SARS-CoV showed variations. 11, 12, 14, 44, 45 To evaluate the efficiency of the siRNA, we used the GFP and RFP reporter genes fused with the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV. We proved that the mRNA fused with the Leader sequence did not affect the translation of the GFP and RFP proteins in the cultured cells. As expected, our data showed that the siRNA could block the expression of the reporter genes with the Leader sequence, while it had no effect on those without the Leader sequence. Consistent results were obtained by direct observation of the GFP and RFP proteins using fluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis. This simple observation model can be used to show the effects of siRNA on the transcription of genes with Leader sequence in other laboratories.\n\nPreviously, we reported the use of siRNA targeting the S gene of SARS-CoV to inhibit virus replication. 31 The probability of gene variation in the S gene might cause randomly selected targeting sequence changes, which would reduce the effectiveness of the designed siRNA. While the Leader sequence of the coronavirus remained identical, we postulated generating siRNA targeting the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV, which is necessary for the transcriptions of various genes of the virus. We considered that this targeting site was more powerful than targeting individual genes and would overcome the various mutations of the other genes in SARS-CoV.\n\nIn theory, completely knocking out one of the genes should lead to the blockade of virus replication. However, empirically, siRNA could only knock down the expression of the targeted gene expression. Therefore, designing an siRNA targeting several genes should provide better inhibition of virus replication. To this aim, the Leader sequence in SARS-CoV provided a very useful target because it is part of the mRNAs of each gene critical to SARS-CoV replication. Indeed, our experiments showed that siRNA targeting the Leader sequence was more effective than siRNA for the S gene. Also, our data indicated that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence was powerful compared to antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. There might be several reasons for the lower effectiveness of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides including lower transfection efficiency, di-\n\nT Li et al gestion by DNAse and lower transcription of antisense mRNA in the nucleus.\n\nIn conclusion, we reported that siRNA targeting the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV could effectively inhibit gene expression and replication of the virus in cultured cells. This work provided a base for gene therapy of SARS. Whether an adenovirus delivery system could be used for the therapy of SARS in animal model and human needs to be further investigated.\n\nThe sequence of SARS-CoV BJ01 clone (GenBank accession number AY278488) was used to predict the Leader sequence based on the Leader sequence similarity in the coronavirus family. Based on the information of prediction, primers were designed to amplify the cDNA of the transcripts of different genes of SARS-CoV by RT-PCR and the products were sequenced. The primers used were: forward (located upstream of common Leader sequence of SARS-CoV): CCAGGAAAAGCCAAC CAAC; reverse (located on the different genes of SARS-CoV): S gene -CCATGCATAGACAGAAGGGAA; M gene -TTACTGTACTAGCAAAGCAA; E gene -TTA GACCAGAAGATCAGGA; N gene -TGCCTGAGTT GAATCAGC; N gene 3 0 common genome sequence -GCTATTAAAATCACATGGGGA.\n\nThe 5 0 -end of the S gene RNA transcript was identified by using an end-switching 5 0 -RACE commercial kit (SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit). Total RNA (1 mg) extracted from virus-infected Vero E6 cells was used for the 5 0 -RACE reaction in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Specific primer (5 0 -GCT GACGTGCCCCAAGTGTCTTGAG-3 0 ) located near the 5 0 -end of the possible S gene was used for PCR and primers (forward: 5 0 -CCAGGAAAAGCCAACCAAC-3 0 ; reverse: 5 0 -TAGAAACAGCAAAGAAAGGG-3 0 ) were used for nested PCR.\n\nTo locate the target site of siRNA in the SARS-CoV leader sequence, we selected those sequences of 22 bp with the structure of AGN 18 TT. As an empirical design, 17, 33 we chose the sites with GC/AT ratios between 30 and 60%. In matching for those criteria, a uniquely specific target sequence CCAACCAACCTCGATCTC was determined.\n\nThis sequence was further confirmed for the specificity by Blasting against Nr and human Genome databases. The synthesized oligos were: forward -5 0 -CCAAC CAACCTCGATCTCTTCAAGAGAGAGATCGAGGTTG GTTGGCTTTTTG-3 0 ; reverse -5 0 -AATTCAAAAAGC CAACCAACCTCGATCTCTCTCTTGAAGAGATCGAG GTTGGTTGG-3 0 .\n\nVectors, vector construction and antisense RNA synthesis pBS/U6, a backbone vector with a U6 promoter, kindly provided by Dr Yang Shi, was used for the construction of the siRNA vector. The hairpin cDNA was generated through annealing of the complementary oligos synthesized above and directly inserted into the pBS/U6 vector through ApaI and EcoRI sites. The correct clones were verified by KpnI and XhoI cutting. Finally, the clones were confirmed by sequencing. This vector was named pBS/U6/L-RNAi.\n\nFor the construction of the reporter vectors with a SARS-CoV Leader sequence, pEFBos/GFP or pDsRed1.1/RFP vector was used as backbone and subcloned through KpnI and BamHI sites by inserting the SARS-CoV Leader sequence cDNA, which was generated through annealing of the complementary oligos synthesized as sense: 5 0 -CCCAGGAAAAGC CAACCAACCTCGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTCTAA ACGAAC-3 0 and antisense: 5 0 -GATCCGTTCGTTTAGA GAACAGATCTACAAGAGATCG AGGTTGGTTGGCTT TTCCTGGGGTAC-3 0 . The correct clones were verified by KpnI and BamHI cutting, which generated a 60 bp insert. The clones were sequence confirmed. The two reporter vectors with the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV were named pEFBos/L-GFP and pDsRead1.1/L-RFP, where L stands for Leader sequence. The correct expression of the mRNA by the construct was examined by RT-PCR using the primers as shown in Figure 2a : a, SARS-CoV leader sequence forward primer, CCAGGAAAAGCCAAC CAA; b, GFP forward primer, ATGGTGAGCAAGGGC GA; c, GFP reverse primer, TTACTTGTACAGCT CGTCCATG; d, RFP forward primer, ATGGTGCGCTC CTCCAA; and e, RFP reverse primer, CTACAGGAA CAGGTGGTGG.\n\nThe other vectors used in this paper included, pBS/ U6/S-RNAi, constructed by our lab; 31 and pBS/U6/ GFP-RNAi, kindly provided by Dr Yang Shi. For the establishment of the stable cell lines based on Vero E6 cells, pcDNA3 was used as backbone to subclone the insert, through SpeI and EcoRI sites, from the pBS/U6, pBS/U6/GFP-RNAi or pBS/U6/L-RNAi vector with the U6 promoter with GFP-RNAi or L-RNAi sequence. The three new constructs were named pcDNA3/ U6, pcDNA3/U6/GFP-RNAi and pcDNA3/U6/ L-RNAi.\n\nThe antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting the different regions of SARS-CoV Leader sequence were directly synthesized and thio-modified. The sequences used are: A1 (5 0 -GGTTGGTTGGCTTTTCCTGG-3 0 ), A2 (for 5 0 -AGAGATCGAGGTTGGTTGGC-3 0 ) and A3 (5 0 -GATCTACAAGAGATCGAGGT-3 0 ). Three wells of repeats were used in each experiment.\n\n293T and Vero E6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. 293T cells were plated into six-well dishes at a density of 4 \u00c2 10 5 cells/ well and cultured overnight before transfection. A total of 2.5 mg DNA/well was used for the transfection with the CalPhos s (ClonTech) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. In the case of large-scale transfection, 293T or VERO E6 cells was plated in 60 mm dishes at a density of 11 \u00c2 10 5 cells/dish and a total of 6 mg DNA/well were used for transfection with Cal-Phos s (ClonTech). The transfected cells were cultured for at least 48 h or longer for further experiments. The antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were transfected in 24-well plates at a density of 1 \u00c2 10 5 cells/well and a total of 1 mg DNA/well with Lipofectamine 2000.\n\nThe construct pcDNA3/U6/L-RNAi, pcDNA3/U6 or pcDNA3/U6/GFP-RNAi was transfected into Vero E6 cells and selected with G418 (1.5 mg/ml) for 4 weeks. In all, 20 single-cell clones for each of the transfected constructs were selected and amplified. The correct clones were examined by PCR using the genomic DNA of cloned cells. The PCR primers used were: forward, 5 0 -CCTGCCCCGGTTAATTTG-3 0 ; reverse, U6, 5 0 -AGAAC TAGTGGATCCCCCGG-3 0 . In the final experiment of SARS infection, at least three clones were mixed as a pool to represent the clone of the recombinant fragment of U6, U6/GFP-RNAi or U6/L-RNAi, which was also the name of the cell lines established.\n\nGenomic DNA or total RNA from the cells was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen), respectively, with the addition of RNAase or DNAase. The PCR reaction was performed using the primers indicated in each experiment. The PCR reaction conditions are described in the figure legends. RT-PCR was carried out using One Step RNA RT-PCR kit (Takara, Japan) with 1 mg of the total RNA for each sample, according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nSARS-CoV (strain, BJ01, GenBank accession number AY278488), provided by the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, AIMMS, China, was propagated on Vero E6 cells. The virus was released from the infected cells by three cycles of freezing and thawing. For the test of inhibition of the virus by siRNA, 3 \u00c2 10 5 cells (U6, U6/GFP-RNAi or U6/L-RNAi stable cell line) in 24well plates were infected with 5 \u00c2 10 5 PFU of SARS-CoV (BJ01), in a final volume of 0.2 ml of DMEM with 2% FBS for 2 h at 371C. Cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) added, 0.5 ml complete media was added to allow growth for 72 h at 371C with 5% CO 2 . For different SARS-CoV infection experiments, the same ratio of cell/virus was used. All those operations were performed in a bio-safety P3 level lab.\n\nThe Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates were challenged by a series of dilutions of sample virus. The virus was allowed to infect the cells for 2 h and then was completely withdrawn by washing with PBS. After incubation for 72 h, the cells were stained and the dilution of the most infected cells (with no staining) was regarded as the titer of the virus (PFU).\n\nFor the detection of the GFP protein fused with a SARS-CoV Leader sequence, cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection and lysed with 0.2 ml of cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 m Na 2 VO 3 , 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM b-glycerol-phosphate, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mg/ml aprotinin and 5 mg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5). In all, 10 mg of total cell lysis protein per sample was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybone ECI, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 100 V for 1 h, followed by Western blot analysis.\n\nAntibodies directly to GFP and b-actin were obtained from Santa Cruz, CA, USA. The signals were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham).\n\nTotal RNA (10 mg) from different cells infected by SARS-CoV was subjected to a 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The probe from SARS-CoV were labeled with 32 P using a Prime-a-Gene kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hybridization was performed at 681C for 2 h in Hybridization Butter (Promega). Membrane was washed in 2 \u00c2 SSC with 0.1% SDS at 501C three times and autoradiographed by PhosphorImager (DNA Storm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probe used was generated by digestion of N gene cDNA using EcoRI, which corresponds to the 3 0 -end of SARS genome (BJ01, AY278488, 29458-29692).\n\nAt 2 days after transfection with the reporter constructs, cells were harvested and analyzed with the aid of a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Deerfield, IL, USA) using objective \u00c2 20, and the data were acquired with a Sony digital charge-coupled device camera and processed by Adobe PHOTOSHOP software. The cells infected with SARS-CoV were stained for 30 min with 50 ml of violet staining solution (50 mg crystal violet in 20 ml ethanol plus 100 ml dH 2 O) and washed for 5 min with 100 ml of destaining solution (50% ethanol, 0.1% acetic acid in dH 2 O). The cell morphology was observed using a microscopy. For the experiments of reporter gene expression, cells were directly observed by Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope. Pictures were taken with a CCD camera (SPOT, Diagnostic Instrument Inc., USA) equipped with a computer-based, image acquisition system."}
