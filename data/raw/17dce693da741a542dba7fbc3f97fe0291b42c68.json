{"title": "Evaluation of acutE DiarrhEa", "body": "The incubation period from ingestion until onset of symptoms is 1 to 7 days. Symptoms include diarrhea (often bloody), abdominal pain (can be confused with appendicitis on occasion), malaise, headache, and fever (sometimes high). With or without antibiotic therapy, most patients recover within 5 to 7 days. However, diarrhea can persist for 2 to 3 weeks and relapse may occur. The rectosigmoidoscopic findings of Campylobacter diarrhea may be indistinguishable from those of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. The identification of comma-shaped, gram-negative bacteria on stool Gram stain suggests the diagnosis of Campylobacter infection. A rare, extraintestinal complication of Campylobacter infection is Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Up to a third of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 cases in the United States are caused by Campylobacter infection.\n\nSalmonella sp. are gram-negative, aerobic, and facultative anaerobic bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Using O and H antigens, 2500 different serotypes have been identified. The term \"nontyphoidal salmonellosis\" is used to denote disease caused by serotypes other than S. typhi. S. enteriditis and S. yphimurium are the serotypes most commonly isolated in the United States.\n\nInfection can be acquired by ingesting food contaminated with Salmonella or through contact with infected animals (includes reptiles). Ingestion of raw or poorly cooked animal products such as chicken, beef, and eggs can lead to infection. Cooking a meat thoroughly will kill the bacterium. Recent outbreaks have also been attributed to vegetables and unpasteurized milk. Salmonella is the leading cause of mortality from foodborne illness.\n\n\u2022 Acute gastroenteritis (The degree of colonic involvement determines the extent of the dysentery-like symptoms. Treatment for those at-risk patients should last 2 to 5 days or until the patient is afebrile.\n\nTyphoid fever (S. typhi) is best treated with antibiotics for 5 to 7 days for uncomplicated cases and up to 10 to 14 days for a severe infection. Unfortunately, antibiotic resistance is rapidly emerging (fluoroquinolones, 42%; trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), chloramphenicol, ampicillin, streptomycin, and sulfisoxazole, 12% to 13%).\n\nShigella sp. is a gram-negative rod and member of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Most (90% to 95%) infections are caused by one of four species: S. sonnei (most common in the United States), S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, and S. boydii. There are no nonhuman hosts for this organism. The organism is highly infectious, having a fecal-oral route of transmission. Infection can occur with the ingestion of as few as 10 to 100 organisms. Intestinal damage results primarily from direct invasion of the organism into the colonic epithelium and, to a lesser extent, from the production of an enterotoxin. The Shigella toxin is composed of an A subunit, which is catalytic, and a B subunit, which is responsible for binding. Stool volume is typically low and the diarrhea may be bloody, mucoid, or watery. The endoscopic appearance of shigellosis shows intense involvement of the rectosigmoid with variable proximal involvement. Approximately 15% of cases present with pancolitis. In children, Shigella infection has been associated with seizures. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for all cases of shigellosis: a fluoroquinolone may be used or, if susceptible, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or ampicillin.\n\n19. What diarrheogenic illnesses are caused by E. coli? E. coli belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae, a facultative anaerobic, gram-negative bacteria. The organisms are common inhabitants of the human GI tract, and most strains do not have the virulence factors necessary to cause disease. The primary pathogenic strains of E. coli and the syndromes that they cause are listed next.\n\n\u2022 Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) accounts for most cases of travelers' diarrhea but is relatively rare in the United States.\n\nFecal-oral transmission through the ingestion of contaminated food or water is the primary means of spread. Disease is produced by the adherence of ETEC to the mucosa, followed by the production of toxins (heat-labile cholera-like toxins). Invasion of the mucosa does not occur. The illness is usually self-limited, lasting 3 to 5 days. Symptoms include watery diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Occasionally associated with this illness is low-grade fever and, rarely, bloody diarrhea.\n\n\u2022 Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) lacks invasive properties. Disease results from its enteroadherent properties. Illness caused by EPEC affects primarily young children (younger than age 3 years) and must be considered as a probable cause of nursery and pediatric outbreaks of diarrhea. Profuse watery diarrhea, which may become chronic, is the usual presentation. As with ETEC-caused illnesses, those caused by EPEC rarely result in bloody diarrhea.\n\n\u2022 Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) can invade the intestinal mucosa and cause acute dysentery. EIEC strains share characteristics with Shigella sp. and are not commonly found in the United States. Infants under age 1 are most susceptible to EIEC strains in developed countries.\n\n\u2022 Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) was identified in the 1980s and is responsible for diarrhea in children in developing countries, prolonged diarrhea in HIV infection in developing countries, and travelers' diarrhea.\n\n\u2022 Shiga-toxin E. coli (STEC; also known as enterohemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC] ) has a number of serotypes, but E. coli O157:H7 is the most important. E. coli O157:H7 is acquired primarily from the ingestion of contaminated beef, although outbreaks have also been associated with contaminated water, raw milk, unpasteurized juices, and person-to-person transmission among household members. Drinking water contaminated with farm waste has been implicated in several recent large outbreaks. The typical clinical presentation begins with severe abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea followed by rapid progression to bloody diarrhea. The organism is not invasive but produces a Shiga-like toxin, which is cytotoxic to vascular endothelium. The disease can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (less than 10% of cases). The very young and very old are the most susceptible to fatal complications. The most common cause of acute renal failure in North American children is O157:H7 infection. This is the only E. coli species that will be tested when a stool culture is referred to a lab. Typically, the lab does not evaluate for ETEC, EPEC, EIEC, and EAEC.\n\nAntibiotic therapy for O157:H7 should be avoided. Early therapy with antibiotics has been implicated in the development of hemolytic uremia syndrome. Supportive care, correction of fluid and electrolyte disturbances, and hemodialysis for acute renal failure are the mainstays of therapy. Antimotility agents should be avoided.\n\nThe most common presentation includes diarrhea, abdominal pain, and low-grade fever. Microscopic examination of the stool usually shows red and white blood cells. Approximately 25% of the cases are grossly bloody. The clinical presentation of children and young adults may resemble that of appendicitis (right lower quadrant abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis). Findings at surgery show mesenteric lymphadenitis and terminal ileitis. On rare occasions, a patient may progress to fulminant enterocolitis with intestinal perforation, peritonitis, and hemorrhage. Pharyngitis is common in children with Y. enterocolitica infection and is seen in up to 10% of adult cases. Patients with iron overload (hemochromatosis) are more susceptible to yersinial sepsis. Postinfectious manifestations of reactive arthritis, erythema nodosum, Reiter syndrome, thyroiditis, myocarditis, and glomerulonephritis have been reported.\n\nVibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus , all members of the Vibrio genus, are halophilic organisms (i.e., it grows only in media containing salt) that have been isolated in fish, crustaceans, and shellfish. The diarrhea is characteristically watery, but bloody diarrhea may be seen in up to 15% of patients. Patients with liver disease have a high rate of mortality if infected with V. vulnificus. Other causes of seafood-induced diarrhea include norovirus, Plesiomonas shigelloides , Campylobacter, scromboid fish poisoning (fish contains high levels of histamine and heat stable amines), and ciguatera fish poisoning (toxin found in reef fish produced from a dinoflagellate).\n\nEntamoeba histolytica, Balantidium coli, Dientamoeba fragilis , and Schistosoma spp. The most common cause of parasitic dysentery in the United States is amebiasis ( E. histolytica ). Although parasitic dysentery is uncommon in the United States, it is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.\n\nTravelers to and immigrants from endemic areas, institutionalized patients, and homosexual men. Complications include liver abscess, toxic megacolon, intestinal perforation, peritonitis, intussusception, obstruction, and ameboma (mass of granulation tissue in the terminal ileum/right colon). Amoebic dysentery should be considered in any patient who has persistent travelers' diarrhea (longer than 2 weeks).\n\n\u2022 Microscopic examination of the stool for cysts and/or trophozoites or a colon ulcer biopsy yields positive results in only 50% of cases .\n\n\u2022 Monoclonal antibody-based EIA stool assays for E. histolytica antigens have a sensitivity of 95%.\n\n\u2022 Detection of circulating antibodies to E. histolytica by the indirect hemagglutination (IHAA) test. Approximately 80% to 90% of patients with amebic dysentery have a positive IHAA serology. A positive IHAA test in a patient with presumptive inflammatory bowel disease should raise the possibility of amebiasis.\n\nAcute amebic dysentery is treated with metronidazole, 500 to 750 mg three times a day for 5 to 10 days, followed by an agent to treat intraluminal cysts such as iodoquinol 650 mg three times a day for 20 days . Consumption of alcohol during metronidazole therapy may induce an Antabuse effect (e.g., abdominal cramps, nausea, emesis, headache, flushing). Peripheral neuropathy is a potentially severe and chronic side effect of metronidazole. Other possible symptoms include a metallic taste and GI distress manifested by nausea, flatus, and diarrhea. Metronidazole is teratogenic and should not be taken during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nGiardia, Cryptosporidiosis , and Cyclospora spp. typically cause self-limited nonbloody diarrhea. Contaminated water is the primary source for community outbreaks. Giardia sp. is a frequent culprit after consumption of water from mountainous lakes and streams. The lack of secretory IgA correlates with chronic giardiasis. Cyclospora sp. should be considered in travelers from Nepal. Cyclospora infection has also been implicated from imported fruit. Cryptosporidiosis is a significant cause of HIV-related diarrhea.\n\nThe number one cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea is C. difficile infection. It is rare that another bacterial agent is the cause of diarrhea in patients, unless part of a foodborne or waterborne outbreak.\n\nNoninfectious causes of hospital-acquired diarrhea include enteral nutrition and hyperosmolar liquid medications (which commonly contain sorbitol). Other medications that can cause diarrhea include antacids, magnesium supplements, antibiotics, antineoplastics, cholinergics, theophylline, and prostaglandins.\n\nFor more information on pseudomembranous colitis (PMC), the reader is referred to Chapter 50.\n\nSee Table 55 -1.\n\nAntibiotic therapy in patients with O157:H7 can precipitate the hemolytic uremia syndrome and, in patients with Salmonella, can prolong the chronic carrier state and increase relapse. Most patients with acute diarrhea do not require antibiotic therapy. Bacterial resistance is a significant problem in treating the bacterial organisms that cause diarrhea. Many of the diarrhea-causative bacterial organisms are resistant to the penicillins, tetracycline, and TMP-SMX. On the average, significant resistance is noted approximately 10 years following the introduction of an antibiotic.\n\nHistorically, treatment of dysentery with antimotility agents, such as diphenoxylate-atropine (Lomotil) and loperamide (Imodium), has been contraindicated. It was believed that reduced intestinal motility would worsen dysentery by slowing pathogen clearance. Recent studies of patients with shigellosis dysentery who were given a combination of loperamide and antibiotic therapy had a shortened duration of diarrhea without adverse effects. Antimotility agents continue to be contraindicated in children with dysentery because of recurrent adverse case reports. 32. Several members of a family develop nausea, emesis, and watery diarrhea 2 to 6 hours after a picnic. Food at the picnic included ham, rice, and custard pie. What type of bacteria is likely to be the cause? Enterotoxin-producing bacteria must be considered because the symptoms began soon after ingestion of the food. Two enterotoxin-producing bacteria that cause symptoms with such a short incubation are Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Coagulase-positive strains of S. aureus are responsible for many cases of food poisoning in the United States. S. aureus enterotoxin is heat-stable. The incubation period from ingestion to symptoms (nausea, emesis, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea) is approximately 3 hours (range, 1 to 6 hours). S. aureus favors growth in foods with high sugar content (e.g., custard) and high salt intake (e.g., ham). Recovery is generally complete in 24 to 48 hours. B. cereus is a spore-forming, gram-positive rod that produces a diarrheogenic, heat-labile enterotoxin. Vomiting can occur within 2 hours of ingestion of contaminated food. Almost all persons with B. cereus develop diarrhea. Meat and rice are the most common food vehicles for infection. Clostridium perfringens also produces an enterotoxin. However, the time of onset of symptoms is usually 8 to 16 hours after ingestion of contaminated food. \n\nSafe foods include steaming hot food and beverages, acidic foods such as citrus, dry foods, foods with high sugar content such as syrups and jellies, and carbonated drinks. Bottled, uncarbonated water is not always safe. Avoid uncooked vegetables and unpeeled fruits. Also consume only safe foods on airplanes that are departing from high-risk areas. Chemoprophylaxis with bismuth salicylate (2 tablets with meals and at bedtime) or with the poorly absorbed (less than 0.4%) antibiotic rifaximin (200 mg twice a day) is effective in reducing diarrhea. Probiotics have also been shown to be efficacious although less so than bismuth or rifaximin. Chemoprophylaxis should be given to persons with prior gastric surgery, those taking acid-blocking medicines (H 2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors), or those who are debilitated and immunosuppressed. Travelers who cannot risk or afford a short illness while traveling may opt for chemoprophylaxis.\n\nFluid replacement is the initial and primary therapy for any diarrhea. Bismuth subsalicylate is effective for mild diarrhea although large doses are required. Rifaximin (200 mg three times daily) is effective for treatment of moderate to severe illness. Ciprofloxacin and azithromycin are also effective in reducing symptoms. Ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of Campylobacter are common in parts of the developing world. Antimotility drugs can be used alone or with antibiotic therapy in adults but should be avoided in children.\n\nCholera is a severe diarrheal disorder caused by V. cholerae, a gram-negative, comma-shaped bacteria. The illness is characterized by massive watery stool output, at times in excess of 1 L/hr. Dehydration, hypovolemic shock, and death occur rapidly if fluid replacement is not provided. The cholera organisms colonize the upper small bowel and release an enterotoxin that binds to and activates mucosal cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which, in turn, activates chloride channels in mucosal crypts and leads to the massive secretory diarrhea. A second toxin, called the zonula occludens toxin (ZOT), increases intestinal permeability. The intestinal mucosa is not altered by the organism.\n\nFluid replacement with either intravenous fluids or oral rehydration solution is the mainstay of therapy. A 2-day course of tetracycline is also beneficial.\n\nOral rehydration solution (ORS) is composed primarily of water, salt, and glucose (1 L of purified water combined with 20 g of glucose, 3.5 g of sodium chloride, 2.5 g of sodium bicarbonate, and 1.5 g of potassium chloride). Glucose enhances sodium and water absorption across the small bowel villi, even in the presence of cholera enterotoxin. Rice starch can be substituted for glucose.\n\nBRAT stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. This diet, with its avoidance of dairy products, because a transient lactase deficiency may occur, is often recommended to patients with gastroenteritis and diarrhea.\n\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy is the mainstay of diagnosis for ischemic colitis. The rectum is usually spared because of its collateral blood flow. Above the rectum, the mucosa becomes friable and edematous, and there may be hemorrhagic areas and ulcerations resembling those of Crohn's disease. Angiography is not generally helpful in the evaluation of ischemic colitis; ischemic colitis is a small-vessel disease (nonocclusive) compared with mesenteric midgut ischemia of the small bowel, which involves thrombosis or embolism in the superior mesenteric artery (occlusive). A barium enema is contraindicated in patients with suspected ischemic colitis, because colonic expansion during barium instillation may promote further ischemia."}
