{"title": "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome as an Organ Phenotype of Vascular\nMicrothrombotic Disease: Based on Hemostatic Theory and Endothelial Molecular\nPathogenesis", "body": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by severe pulmonary vascular\ndysfunction characterized by acute onset of dyspnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia associated with\nnoncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and systemic inflammation. Although the exact\npathophysiologic mechanism causing pulmonary vascular dysfunction has not been determined\nyet, it is a circulatory dysfunction often associated with moderate thrombocytopenia1\u20133 and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).4\u20136 Because its pathogenetic mechanism is not clearly recognized, no effective\ntherapeutic agent targeting the underlying pathologic disease has been procured to date.\nVentilator support, fluid and electrolyte balances, and cardiopulmonary monitoring with the\nbest supportive care have marginally improved the outcome of ARDS in several decades.\nMortality rate is still very high. It increases with disease severity. In a multicenter,\ninternational, prospective cohort study of 3022 patients with ARDS, unadjusted hospital\nmortality was reported to be 35% among those with mild ARDS, 40% for those with moderate\ndisease, and 46% for patients with severe ARDS.7\n\n\nRecently, two proposed hemostatic mechanisms have opened the door in the understanding of\nARDS from molecular pathogenesis associated with endotheliopathy that promotes inflammation\nand coagulation disorder in sepsis and other critical illnesses8\u201311; one is \u201ctwo-activation theory of the endothelium\u201d in which endothelial pathogenesis\nactivates inflammatory pathway and microthrombotic pathway and the other is a novel\n\u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d of hemostasis in which hemostasis initiates thrombogenesis and\npromotes microthrombogenesis, leading to vascular microthrombotic disease (VMTD).8,10,12,13 These two theories are congruous each other since the endothelium contributes to\ninitial hemostasis and triggers molecular mechanism for thrombogenesis. In endotheliopathy,\nthe pathologic nature of inflammation promoting inflammatory response12 is recognized and the character of \u201cmicrothrombi\u201d leading to multiple hematologic\nphenotypes is identified.9 In addition, the true mechanism of in vivo hemostasis in vascular injury and three\ndifferent thrombogenetic mechanisms within hemostasis are uncovered.8,10 Through the recognition of endothelial molecular pathogenesis, enough evidences have\nbeen accumulated that ARDS is one of the phenotypes of MODS occurring as a result of\ndisseminated intravascular microthrombosis (DIT), which is the underlying pathology\ncontributing to endotheliopathy-associated VMTD (EA-VMTD).1,9\u201311\n\n\nThe objective of this article is to analyze the clinical, pathological, and\nhematopathological features of ARDS and to account for involved pathophysiological\nmechanisms associated with endothelial dysfunction based on two hemostatic theories. In the\nend, this author will look into potential therapeutic option for the treatment of ARDS\naccording to \u201ctheory-based medicine\u201d instead of \u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d since clinical\ntrials for ARDS have completely failed to find an effective therapeutic regimen.\n\nThe clinical features of ARDS are characterized by (1) acute onset of noncardiogenic\nrespiratory distress, (2) bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and (3) evidence of diffuse\ncirculatory obstruction of pulmonary vasculature. In addition to acute respiratory\ndistress, hematologic features of ARDS include thrombocytopenia,2,3,38\u201340 MODS,1,4\u20136,9\u201312 DIT,1,3,9,11 \u201cDIC,\u201d25,26,41\u201343 and TTP-like syndrome,22\u201324 as presented in Tables\n1 and 2. These\nmanifestations seemed to be consistent with a hemostatic disorder, which is now\nrecognized as EA-VMTD.9,10,12 Until recently, it was debated whether ARDS was the cause of thrombocytopenia,\ninflammation, MODS, and \u201cDIC,\u201d or was rather the result of another pathological\ncondition producing those hematologic phenotypes. In later discussion, this dilemma will\nbe further explored once the pathophysiological mechanism of ARDS is established.\n\nThe pathological features of ARDS are characterized by (1) diffuse alveolar damage\nassociated with injury to alveolar lining and endothelial cells (ECs), (2) exudative\npulmonary edema, and (3) hyaline membrane formation.44\u201346 These pathologic changes are very similar, if not identical, in each ARDS caused\nby different pathogens and insults, including pneumonia-initiated SARS and MERS.46,47 One unique abnormality is hyaline membrane formation/deposits. This pathologic\nfeature appears to be similar to that of VMTD associated with TTP and TTP-like syndrome,\nwhich microthrombi are characterized by hyaline thrombi composed of unusually large von\nWillebrand factor multimers (ULVWF) and platelets.48\n\n\nEven though ARDS develops in association with divergent etiologies from sepsis to envenomation,49 its pathologic and clinical features are remarkably similar among different\nunderlying diseases.50\u201352 Diffuse alveolar damage was the histologic changes in most patients with ARDS and\nits progression included 3 phases of exudative, proliferative, and fibrotic changes that\ncorrelated with the time rather than its specific causes.52 These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that pathogenesis of ARDS is\nnot due to multifactorial processes primarily involving the lungs, but is the result of\none pathophysiologic mechanism affecting the lungs and multiorgans.\n\nAs in other critical illnesses, thrombocytopenia commonly occurs in ARDS during the\ncourse of the disease.1\u20133 Even after the known causes of thrombocytopenia such as heparin-induced\nthrombocytopenia, transfusion and drug-related thrombocytopenia, bone marrow\nsuppression, and other identifiable thrombocytopenia are excluded, the mechanism of\nundetermined thrombocytopenia cannot be clearly accounted for in most of the cases.\nThus, this has been designated as thrombocytopenia in critically ill patients (TCIP).1,53,54 Recently, in critical illnesses such as sepsis and trauma, thrombocytopenia is\nsuspected to be associated with endotheliopathy that initiates microthrombogenesis and\nforms microthrombi. The platelet consumption occurs when ULVWF released from\nendotheliopathy recruit platelets to form platelet-ULVWF complexes,1,9,12 which become microthrombi strings and platelets are consumed. This concept of\nTCIP is direct and unequivocal evidence that endotheliopathy promotes in vivo\nhemostasis. Thrombocytopenia in critically ill patient usually presents with mild to\nmoderately decreased platelet count, and bleeding has not been a significant issue in\nthe care of critically ill patients. According to hemostatic principles (Table 3), blood vessel damage\nlimited to ECs in endotheliopathy activates ULVWF path, but TF path is not activated if\nsubendothelial tissue (SET)/extravascular tissue (EVT) illustrated in Figure 2 is not compromised.8,10,12 As the hemostatic nature of microthrombosis associated with critical illnesses\nhas not been recognized to date, TCIP has been benignly neglected although Bone et al22 in late 70s had observed thrombocytopenia was a significant component when he\ndescribed thrombocytopenia in ARDS. Now, TCIP is found to be consumptive\nthrombocytopenia caused by microthrombogenesis that leads to EA-VMTD/DIT.9\n\n\nMore recently, the significant role of the platelet has been recognized in the care of\npatients with critical illnesses and ARDS. The degree of thrombocytopenia in sepsis was\nassociated with increased severity and higher mortality54,55 and thrombocytopenia was an increased risk and predictive for patient mortality\nin ARDS.2\n\n\nWhen mild to moderate thrombocytopenia was present in ARDS, this author often found\nmasked microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) in hematologic evaluation.23,24 Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia was less prominent in ARDS with fewer\nschistiocytes than that in acquired immune TTP, and also with mild to moderate anemia.\nIf, however, the evidence of hemolysis were evident with reticulocytosis,\nhypohaptoglobinemia, increased lactic acid dehydrogenase, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia,23,24,56 it was called atypical MAHA, which is more common in TTP-like syndrome (ie,\nEA-VMTD). In the literature, case reports described the association between ARDS and\nTTP-like syndrome.22\u201325,56\u201361 In this author\u2019s experience, ARDS with coexisting TTP-like syndrome responded\ndramatically when therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was employed in very early stage of ARDS.23,24\n\n\nThe reasons why the diagnosis of TTP-like syndrome has been masked in ARDS were due to\ninconspicuous schistocytosis and unsuspected diagnosis as well as major attention for\nthe patient care directed to respiratory distress in real-time clinical practice. More\nlikely, it was also due to diametrically different pathogeneses between TTP and TTP-like\nsyndrome, in which clear distinction has not been recognized until recently.9 It was also caused by the fact that ARDS has never been considered to be a\nhemostatic disease, and further TTP-like syndrome was unknown to be caused by endotheliopathy.9 In clinical medicine, all patients with ARDS should be evaluated with a high\nindex of suspicion to look for atypical MAHA as well as thrombocytopenia. Unexplained\nthrombocytopenia and firm evidence of hemolysis even with minimal or no schistocytes in\nrepeated blood film examination may still be consistent with TTP-like syndrome.13\n\n\nIn late 1980s, Vesconi et al62 suspected that ARDS was caused by pulmonary vascular microthrombosis following\nvery elegant investigation demonstrating pulmonary microvascular occlusive lesions in\nballoon occlusive pulmonary angiography in 31 patients with severe adult respiratory\ndistress. In the study, multiple pulmonary artery filling defects were detected, which\nfindings were interpreted to be consistent with vascular microthrombosis. However, the\nconcept of microthrombosis was not defined yet in coagulation community. Nonetheless,\nthe thesis of microvascular thrombosis or vascular microthrombosis can explain the\ncompromised vascular circulatory function of the lungs and occlusive lesions in\npulmonary angiography better than any of other propositions. Proposed theories for the\npathogenesis of ARDS have included pulmonary vascular endothelial injury leading to\nendothelial dysfunction due to inflammatory cytokines or activated immune cells,63 upregulation of adhesion molecules such as soluble vascular adhesion molecule 1\nand E-selectin, underexpression of vascular endothelial cadherins,64,65 interactions between neutrophils and cytokines promoting transendothelial\nmigration of cytokine-primed neutrophils,66 and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) provoking coagulation and\nmicrocirculatory failure.67\u201369 However, these theories could not define how and what molecular changes occur to\nlead to ARDS and produce increased capillary permeability that was considered to be the\nhallmark of ARDS.70 More importantly, these theories cannot answer why inflammation in ARDS is\nfrequently associated with simultaneous hematologic syndromes and MODS.5,71,72\n\n\nThe proposition of microthrombosis was a very important thesis because for the first\ntime the potential hemostatic nature of ARDS was suggested.62 Vascular microthrombosis or microvascular thrombosis has been well recognized as\nthe underlying disease of TTP and more recently as that of TTP-like syndrome, which\noccurs in EA-VMTD as well as \u201cDIC.\u201d Although the molecular mechanism of ARDS has\nremained elusive, later Khadaroo and Marshall5 correctly understood that vascular microthrombosis could contribute its clinical\nexpression not only as ARDS in the lungs but also as MODS in other vital organs. In\naddition to common association of ARDS and MODS, the similar, if not the same, pulmonary\npathologic changes from different pathogens and noninfectious critical illnesses support\nthe mechanism that each of clinical phenotypes of MODS occurs as a result of the same\nsystemic disease of VMTD,12 as displayed in Figure 3.\nFor example, similar to the organ phenotype of hemolytic uremic syndrme (HUS) in the\nkidneys, the organ phenotype of ARDS in the lungs is caused by microvascular thrombosis,\nwhich is also characteristic of TTP, TTP-like syndrome, \u201cDIC,\u201d and thrombotic\nmicroangiopathy. In this context, it can be concluded that ARDS, HUS, and every organ\nsyndrome in MODS are also the manifestations of EA-VMTD/DIT, as illustrated in Figure 1 and further elaborated in\nFigure 3. Indeed, ARDS is just\none phenotype among MODS associated with increased microvascular permeability due to\nVMTD involving multi-organs.5,9,12,24,34 This is also true for the current biorgan designation syndromes such as\nhepatorenal syndrome, cardiopulmonary syndrome, pulmonary\u2013renal syndrome, hepatic\nencephalopathy, cardiorenal syndrome, and others.\n\nIt should be emphasized that ARDS is not the cause of MODS, but all the organ\nphenotypes of MODS as well as ARDS are collateral syndromes provoked by VMTD. Next\nimportant question is how clinical expression of VMTD can be so variable in the\ndevelopment of MODS among every individual patient as shown in Figure 3. This will be discussed in the heading of\ntropism and endothelial heterogeneity within pathophysiological mechanisms involved in\nARDS.\n\nThe American College of Chest Physicians and the Society of Critical Care Medicine\nintroduced definitions for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis,\nsevere sepsis, septic shock, and MODS in early 1990s.73 The idea proposing the term SIRS was to recognize it as a clinical response to a\nnonspecific insult of either infectious or noninfectious origin. However, SIRS couldn\u2019t\nbe defined as a disease entity and thus has remained to be just as a complex clinical\nsyndrome associated with sepsis and noninfectious critical illnesses because the\npathogenesis of SIRS has not been clearly established. It generally has been considered\nto be expression of self-defense mechanism against overwhelming pathologic insults.\n\nOver the past decades, it has become evident that endotheliopathy plays a major role in\nsepsis with inflammation and coagulation. In generalized endotheliopathy, SIRS commonly\noccurs in association with ARDS, which is manifested by combined severe inflammation via\ncytokine release and microthrombosis via microthrombogenesis that often leads to MODS.8\u201312 In severe ARDS, inflammation coexists with other organ phenotypes such as\nencephalopathy, acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, fulminant\nhepatic failure, adrenal insufficiency, and others.1,12,13 Thus, SIRS can be best defined as combined syndrome of severe inflammatory\nresponse from activated inflammatory pathway and organ dysfunction from activated\nmicrothrombotic pathway as a result of generalized systemic endotheliopathy.\n\nHowever, we have to understand that inflammation and microthrombosis in endotheliopathy\nare two separate processes, although their crosstalk mechanism has been popularized.\nTheir molecular pathogeneses are independent, which is illustrated in two-activation\ntheory of the endothelium (Figure\n1). This is the very reason why clinical trials based on anti-inflammatory\nregimens have had no impact on coagulation system and has failed to improve the outcome\nas demonstrated in the management of sepsis-associated coagulopathy. In clinical\npractice, inflammation alone is not the major factor causing poor outcome of the\npatient, but clinical severity of MODS caused by VMTD is the main culprit for the demise\nin severe sepsis.\n\n\u201cDisseminated intravascular coagulation\u201d has occurred with ARDS with or without sepsis.26,27,41\u201343 It has been considered be the most serious coagulopathy not only in sepsis but\nalso in other human diseases, which is estimated to occur in about 30% to 50% of\npatients with sepsis. A 1996 study in Japan found that a diagnosis of DIC complicated\nabout 1.0% of admissions to university hospitals.74\n\n\nAccording to NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, DIC is a condition in which\nblood clots form throughout the body\u2019s small blood vessels. These blood clots can reduce\nor block blood flow through the blood vessels, which can damage the body\u2019s organs.75 Generally clinicians and pathologists defined DIC as a widespread hypercoagulable\nstate that can lead to both microvascular and macrovascular clotting and compromise\nblood flow, ultimately resulting in multiple organ dysfunction and MODS.74 The truth is the coagulopathy of \u201cDIC\u201d couldn\u2019t be precisely defined because the\nconcept of microthrombosis and its thrombogenesis had not been identified yet. It is\nbecause the physiological mechanism of in vivo hemostasis has been incompletely\nunderstood. For example, what is the role of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in the\nthrombogenesis and coagulation? Also, what is the role of the platelet in coagulation cascade?76 What is the difference between fibrin clots of activated TF path and thrombosis\nof deep vein thrombosis (DVT)? What is the difference between microthrombi and\nmacrothrombus? Why is microthrombosis disseminated, but is DVT localized? What is\ncoagulation? and how is it different from thrombogenesis? All of these questions seem to\nbe philosophical ones but are urgently needed practical questions in the patient care.\nThere is no simple answer on the difference between DVT and DIC. The former responds to\nanticoagulation, but the latter does not. Why is it?\n\nCurrent dilemma is that \u201cDIC\u201d is found to be incorrect in its character and also in\naccepted contemporary pathogenetic mechanism according to this author\u2019s interpretation.8\u201312 The reinterpretation of \u201cDIC\u201d based on \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d of hemostasis\nand the mechanism of thrombogenesis clearly support that it occurs as a result of\nactivated ULVWF path.8\u201312 The credibility of \u201cDIC,\u201d which coagulopathy has been blamed to microthrombi\ncomposed of platelet-ULVWF complexes via microthrombogenesis by some and to fibrin clots\nmade of fibrin, platelet, and coagulation factors through uncontrolled activation of\nTF-initiated path by others, is seriously undermined because of the irreconcilable\nconflict between microthrombi and fibrin clots.8\u201312 In in vivo hemostatic process, microthrombi and fibrin clots can be easily\ndifferentiated as illustrated in Figure\n4A and B. The true character of blood clots in \u201cDIC\u201d is the same microthrombi\noccurring in VMTD as seen in TTP and TTP-like syndrome.9 Also, the pathophysiological mechanism of \u201cDIC\u201d is not TF/FVIIa complex-activated\ncoagulation cascade but instead is partial hemostasis due to lone activation of ULVWF path.8 Since \u201cDIC\u201d (ie, microthrombosis) occurs as the result of endotheliopathy alone\nwithout the damage of SET/EVT,8,10,12 TF path is not activated. This author has derived two theories of \u201ctwo-activation\ntheory of the endothelium\u201d and \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d of hemostasis from the\nanalysis and interpretation of pathological, clinical, laboratory, and molecular\ncharacteristics between \u201cDIC\u201d and \u201cTTP-like syndrome\u201d and elaborated these hypotheses in\nprevious publications.8\u201312 Therefore, I shall not repeat them again. In short, it can be affirmed that \u201cDIC\u201d\nis exactly the same to EA-VMTD/DIT, which hematologic phenotype is TTP-like syndrome.9\n\n\nIn summing up, the concept of \u201cDIC\u201d has been built on the following faulty\npathophysiologic mechanism of hemostasis. Comments are followed after each\nstatement.\u201cDIC\u201d is uncontrolled \u201cTF path\u201d initiated coagulation disorder occurring in\nsepsis and other critical illnesses.(Instead, it is \u201cULVWF path\u201d initiated microthrombotic disorder.)\u201cDIC\u201d is triggered by inflammation, leading to pathologic \u201cfibrin clots\u201d through\n\u201ccrosstalk\u201d between inflammation and coagulation.(Instead, it is triggered by microthrombogenesis, leading to pathologic\n\u201cmicrothrombi strings\u201d and \u201cno crosstalk\u201d is involved.)\u201cDIC\u201d is caused by microvascular thrombosis initiated by \u201cTF/FVIIa complex\u201d.(Instead, it is caused by vascular microthrombosis initiated by \u201cplatelet-ULVWF\ncomplex.\u201d)\u201cDIC\u201d \u201cconsumes coagulation factors and platelets in clotting process.\u201d(Instead, it is the result of \u201creleased ULVWF from injured ECs that consume\nplatelets in formation of microthrombi strings.\u201d)Acute \u201cDIC\u201d is characterized by thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, and severe\nhemorrhagic syndrome associated with \u201cconsumption coagulopathy\u201d with depletion of\nFVIII and FV.(Instead, acute \u201cDIC\u201d is characterized by \u201chepatic coagulopathy\u201d with markedly\nincreased FVIII, markedly decreased FVII, and decreased FII, FV, FIX and FX.)Chronic \u201cDIC\u201d is characterized by thrombocytopenia, MAHA, and MODS without\ncoagulopathy.(Yes, the statement is true, but then it is the same picture to \u201cTTP-like\nsyndrome.\u201d)\u201cDIC\u201d, TTP, HUS, TTP-like syndrome, and thrombotic microangiopathy are similar\nbut \u201cdifferent diseases.\u201d77\u201382\n(Instead, all of them are the same disease called \u201cTTP-like syndrome\u201d except TTP\n[GA-VMTD and AA-VMTD].9)\u201cDIC\u201d did not respond to any therapeutic agent utilized in clinical trials. But\nthe reason is unexplained.(Yes, the statement is true. The reason was the clinical trials were designed\nbased on incorrect pathogenetic mechanism. But it is expected to respond to\nantimicrothrombotic therapy.)\n\n\nOn the other hand, EA-VMTD/DIT occurs due to microthrombogenesis as a result of lone\nactivation of ULVWF path of hemostasis.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude as follows:\u201cDIC\u201d is incorrect in its concept but is consistent with EA-VMTD/DIT.8,10\u201312\nChronic \u201cDIC\u201d is incorrect term, which should be EA-VMTD/DIT without hepatic\ncoagulopathy.Acute \u201cDIC\u201d is incorrect term but is consistent with EA-VMTD/DIT with hepatic\ncoagulopathy.\n\n\nTraditionally, DIC has included (1) \u201cDIC\u201d that is associated with sepsis, trauma, and\nother critical illnesses and (2) true DIC that occurs in acute promyelocytic leukemia\n(APL) and rare cases of certain snake venom bite.83 The former is microthrombotic disease due to microthrombi strings (TTP-like\nsyndrome) and the latter is hemorrhagic disorder due to fibrin clots (fibrin clot\ndisease). Since \u201cDIC\u201d has been reappraised as TTP-like syndrome (ie, EA-VMTD/DIT), once\nwe move \u201cDIC\u201d to the column of DIT, the leftover is true DIC that occurs in APL in which\nfibrin clots are formed by fibrinogenesis via extrinsic coagulation cascade from\nactivated aberrant TF path.8,10 Finally, sepsis-associated coagulopathy (ie, microthrombopathy) seen in ARDS can\nbe readily understood as EA-VMTD/DIT, which clinical phenotype is TTP-like syndrome with\nor without hepatic coagulopathy. On the other hand, APL-associated coagulopathy via\nfibrinogenesis can be understood as true DIC (disseminated fibrin clot disease).\n\nThis brief note on DIC and \u201cDIC\u201d seems to be a very complex conceptual issue at this\ntime for readers, but the comprehension would become simple and clear once two theories\n(Figures 1 and 4A and B) are understood with the\nhelp of Figure 2. It is no\nwonder why we could not unmask the true identity of \u201cDIC\u201d term used more than 60 years\nto date.\n\nSuccinctly speaking, ARDS is an organ phenotype of hemostatic disease occurring as a\nresult of generalized endotheliopathy (ie, EA-VMTD/DIT), leading to lone activation of\nULVWF path that promotes microthrombotic pathway (ie, microthrombogenesis) and\norchestrates consumptive thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, and TTP-like syndrome.8,11,12 Generalized endotheliopathy also activates inflammatory pathway independent of\nmicrothrombotic pathway. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in ARDS can be\nsummarized as follows.\n\nComplement activation in ARDS has been well recognized more than 3 decades.84\u201386 However, its relationship between ARDS and complement activation has not been\nexplored even though the role of C5b-9 was suspected to contribute to its pathogenesis86 and C5a in highly pathogenic viral infections was also implicated in acute lung injury.87\n\n\nThe activation of complement system is one of the key events in defense mechanism against\nsepsis. Its protective function for host rapidly identifies and eliminates invading\npathogen. Opsonization of foreign surfaces by covalently attached C3b fulfills 3 major\nfunctions: cell clearance by phagocytosis, amplification of complement activation by the\nformation of a surface-bound C3 convertase, and assembly of C5 convertases. Cleavage of C5\ninduces the formation of a multiprotein pore complex C5b-9 (ie, membrane attack complex\n[MAC]), which leads to cell lysis.88\n\n\nEven though its major role is protective function for host through innate immune defense,\ncomplement activation could promote destructive action to innocent bystander of the\nendothelium of the host, leading to endotheliopathy and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis),89 which may impact the course of sepsis and other critical illnesses. Membrane attack\ncomplex exerts deleterious effects to host\u2019s ECs90 unless CD59 glycoprotein is adequately expressed in ECs and protects them by\ninhibiting C9 polymerization from MAC.91,92\n\n\nIf CD59 is downregulated due to either gene mutation or acquired disease,93 perhaps activated complement could more readily exert destructive effect to the\nhost\u2019s ECs causing endotheliopathy in critical illnesses. When MAC attacks the membrane of\nECs, channel (transmembrane pores) formation develops on the endothelial membrane90 and triggers endotheliopathy.8\u201311 Considering the role of the complement in ARDS as well as in sepsis, endothelial\ndysfunction via activation of complement cascade is suspected to be the major component\ncontributing to pathologic hemostasis of ARDS.\n\nThe endotheliopathy in ARDS activates 2 major molecular mechanisms; one is severe\ninflammation caused by inflammatory cytokines released from the endothelium and the other\nis hypoxic organ dysfunction caused by partial hemostasis via microthrombogenesis as\nillustrated in Figure 4B.\nEndothelial dysfunction has long been known to be the key modulator in the pathogenesis of\nARDS as well as sepsis and critical illnesses.69,94\u201397 The markers such as various cytokines and coagulation participants indicating\nendothelial damage were significantly altered in patients with critical illnesses compared\nwith controls, which included VWF, FVIII and endothelial procoagulants.94 Recently, in view of the role of endotheliopathy and concept of VMTD based on novel\nin vivo \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d of hemostasis, ARDS pathogenesis has been assured to be\nthe result of pathologic hemostasis.8\u201310,12,69,96\n\n\nIn ARDS, heterogeneous expression of cell adhesion molecules by ECs was also noted in\nhuman pulmonary vasculatures. Although E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule were\nnot expressed on ECs of normal lungs, immunochemical studies showed strong expression of\nboth molecules on the larger vessels of the lungs supporting induction or upregulation in ARDS.64,98 Perhaps adhesion molecules could play a secondary role through endothelial\nheterogeneity and NETosis in the phenotypes of ARDS-associated MODS.\n\nIt is now confirmed that ARDS is not the primary disease causing various organ\ndysfunction syndromes but is the secondary syndrome due to one of hypoxic organ\ndysfunction resulting from microthrombosis caused by endotheliopathy just like other MODS\nas illustrated in Figure 3. This\nconcept of MODS promoted by one pathogenetic mechanism (ie, microthrombogenesis) provoked\nby generalized endotheliopathy bespeaks of the following 4 important implications in the\nunderstanding of ARDS and MODS:Acute respiratory distress syndrome is not the primary disease but is secondary\nclinical syndrome associated with one of different underlying causes (eg, sepsis,\ntrauma, complication of pregnancy, surgery and transplant, cancer, drug/toxin,\nautoimmune disease, and others).Both ARDS and other MODS occur as a result of the same underlying\npathophysiological mechanism, which is now identified to be microthrombogenesis due\nto generalized endotheliopathy, leading to VMTD.Both ARDS and other MODS are the phenotypes of EA-VMTD/DIT.Both ARDS and other MODS would respond to the same treatment based on the same\npathophysiological mechanism.\n\n\nCertainly, the conceptual relationship between ARDS and MODS guides us to the better\nunderstanding of endothelial molecular pathogenesis because the endothelium is distributed\nto the entire organ system and tissue of human body and protects from internal disease and\nexternal bodily injury through hemostasis and circulatory homeostasis.8\n\n\nIn endothelial pathogenesis of VMTD, the organ phenotype expression is variable among\ndifferent hosts by the same pathogen or toxin as well as different pathogens or toxins,\nwhich variable expression in turn produces unusual exotic manifestations of MODS. These\nphenotypes are likely to develop due to two main endowed biological mechanisms:\nendothelial heterogeneity of host97\u2013103 and organotropism of pathogen or toxin.104\u2013107 Variable clinical organ phenotypic syndromes occur as seen in the same type of the\npathogen. Examples are hanta virus, causing cardiopulmonary syndrome in the heart and\nlungs, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, presenting with\nencephalopathy and HUS in the brain and kidneys, and Neisseria meningitides, inciting\nWaterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome and meningitis in the adrenals and meninges. Of course, a\nsame organ phenotype can occur due to different types of pathogen.\n\nOne of the interesting observations in ARDS is the common occurrence of combined syndrome\nof ARDS and acute necrotizing pancreatitis.37,108\u2013110 The character of this biorgan attraction of VMTD in a particular patient is similar\nas seen in combined syndromes of hepatic encephalopathy, cardiopulmonary syndrome,\nhepatorenal syndrome, pulmonary\u2013renal syndrome, and others. The circulatory dysfunction\nand pathologic findings of diffuse alveolar damage in ARDS and necrotizing pancreatic\ndamage in acute pancreatitis certainly support that biorgan syndromes are caused by the\nsame pathogenetic mechanism associated with vascular microthrombosis. Endothelial\nheterogeneity and/or tropism select the organ localization of microthrombi, but vascular\nmicrothrombosis inflicts physical damage to the organs.\n\nIn clinical practice, oversimplified designation of organ phenotypes such as\nencephalopathy and rhabdomyolysis as well as ARDS might have interfered detecting the\nunderlying etiology and mechanism of multi-organ syndromes as well as VMTD. Some authors\nhave claimed one organ phenotypic syndrome such as ARDS has caused several other organ\ndysfunctions, including pancreatitis, encephalopathy, renal failure, or hepatic failure.\nHowever, it should be understood that ARDS and additional organ syndromes begin with an\nequal footing in systemic VMTD, but the severity of selective organ damage is determined\nby the localization through selectivity of endothelial heterogeneity and tropism. Since\nARDS is not the primary disease, the term extrapulmonary manifestations or extrapulmonary\nphenotypes of ARDS are misrepresentation. It is this author\u2019s opinion that this conceptual\nmisunderstanding has contributed to the delay in recognizing the pathophysiological\nmechanisms of ARDS as well as that of other MODS such as HUS, fulminant hepatic failure,\nacute pancreatitis, biorgan syndromes, and others.\n\nBoth TTP and TTP-like syndrome are characterized by DIT involving the vital organs. So\nis true with \u201cDIC,\u201d thrombotic microangiopathy, HUS, and ARDS. Therefore, all of them\nshould be classified as VMTD. As discussed earlier in the reinterpretation of \u201cDIC\u201d,\n\u201cDIC\u201d is the same disorder as EA-VMTD/DIT, which hematologic phenotype is TTP-like\nsyndrome. Contemporary theory of TF/FVIIa-initiated coagulation cascade or cell-based\ncoagulation theory cannot explain how microthrombi strings composed of platelet-ULVWF\ncomplexes is the same as fibrin clots within intravascular space. This conceptual\nconflict between activated TF path and activated ULVWF path has alerted this author with\nthe insights that there must be at least two different paths of hemostasis.\n\nThe existence of two utterly different characters of blood clots\u2014microthrombi and\nfibrin clots\u2014have contributed to the redrawing of the framework on two different\nthrombogenetic mechanisms: microthrombogenesis of ULVWF path and fibrinogenesis of TF\npath. The former assembles microthrombi strings as seen in VMTD such as TTP, TTP-like\nsyndrome, \u201cDIC\u201d, HUS, ARDS, and the latter generates fibrin clots as seen in APL and\ncertain envenomation. Then, next question is what is the character DVT and arterial\nthrombus seen in aortic aneurysm since they are neither microthrombi nor fibrin clots.\nInstead, they are obviously macrothrombus, containing fibrin clots and platelets.111 Therefore, it has to be concluded that both ULVWF path and TF path must be\ninvolved in the formation of macrothrombosis such as DVT and arterial thrombosis.\nThrough this elucidation, two-path unifying theory is borne out to explain not only\n\u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d of hemostasis but also three paths of thrombogenesis, which\nincludes microthrombogenesis, fibrinogenesis, and macrothrombogenesis (Figure 4A and B).8 Finally, in vivo hemostatic mechanism, including the additional role of NETosis\nat the unifying stage of activated ULVWF path and activated TF path, has been indirectly discovered.12\n\n\nThe present hallmark of ARDS is vascular microthrombosis (ie, VMTD) as seen with\nsepsis. Sepsis is characterized by generalized endotheliopathy without compromise of\nSET/EVT, which is also the same in ARDS. Hemostatic involvement in sepsis is lone\nactivation of ULVWF path on ECs, leading to formation of microthrombi, but bleeding does\nnot develop because SET and EVT damage do not occur and TF path is not activated. Unlike\nlocalized macrothrombosis (eg, thrombus of aortic aneurysm, acute ischemic stroke, and\nDVT), disseminated microthrombosis (ie, DIT) presents with many intriguing features such\nas ARDS and HUS as well as a variety of hematologic syndromes, including\nthrombocytopenia, MAHA, TTP-like syndrome, and \u201cDIC.\u201d23\u201325,57,60,61\n\n\nAccording to \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d of hemostasis,8,10 two thrombotic/coagulation pathways, which are ULVWF and TF paths, are initiated\nin normal hemostasis but later the two paths must unify to conclude normal hemostasis\nwith passive role of NETs. Hemostasis stops bleeding in external bodily injury but\nproduce thrombosis in intravascular injury. In the different level (depth) of\nintravascular injury as presented in Tables 3 and 4, different paths of thrombogenesis take place\ndepending upon what component(s) of vascular wall is damaged (Figure 2). If the intravascular damage is confined\nto the ECs (level 1), lone ULVWF path becomes activated and causes microthrombosis (ie,\nVMTD such as TIA, TTP-like syndrome, ARDS, and MODS) because TF path is not activated.\nOn the other hand, if the intravascular damage extends from the ECs to SET (level 2),\nboth ULVWF path and TF path become activated and cause macrothrombosis (eg, DVT; acute\nischemic stroke) as illustrated in hemostatic theory (Figure 4A and B).10,12 In addition, if the damage extends from the ECs to beyond vessel wall including\nSET and EVT (level 3), both ULVWF path and TF path become activated and form\nmacrothrombosis with additional EVT bleeding (eg, thrombohemorrhagic stroke), which is\nsummarized in Tables 3 and\n4. For example, for\nstroke, this concept is very important in the understanding of thrombogenesis, not only\nin making the diagnosis but also in planning for the treatment. Also, in another\nsituation, if the ECs, SET- and EVT are damaged by obtuse external trauma, bleeding\noccur into EVT in smaller vessels, but without bleeding into the damaged vascular lumen.\nTissue factor is released and mixed with blood in EVT to activate FVII to trigger the\nactivation of TF/VII path. It causes only \u201chematoma\u201d without significantly breached ECs\nbecause ULVWF path is not activated. This logic is based on \u201ctwo-path unifying theory.\u201d\nPlease see Figure 4B, showing\nthree different thrombogenetic processes: microthrombogenesis, fibrinogenesis, and\nmacrothrombogenesis, which are annotated in bold/shaded face. Each thrombogenesis occurs\nwhen ULVWF path, TF path, or combined paths are activated depending upon the levels\n(depth) of damage in intravascular injury. The characters of microthrombi, fibrin clots,\nand macrothrombus from different paths are very different and produce distinctly\ndifferent clinical thrombotic disorders.10 Among these characters, ARDS is a hemostatic disease made of \u201cmicrothrombi\nstrings.\u201d\n\nThe endothelial molecular pathogenesis triggering inflammation has been well known and\ndocumented in medical literature, but its molecular pathogenesis promoting\nmicrothrombogenesis has not been understood until recently. Although the underlying\npathology of ARDS is VMTD, the pathophysiological mechanism of endotheliopathy causing\nVMTD has remained in mystery, which is the very reason why progress has not been made in\nthe treatment for ARDS. Nor is the comprehensible pathogenesis of microthrombosis\norchestrating hematologic expressions, including thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, and\nTTP-like syndrome. Since sepsis is the initiating cause of microthrombosis and ARDS is\nthe manifestation of organ phenotype of microthrombosis, sepsis and ARDS often coexist.\nFurther, thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, TTP-like syndrome, and SIRS may occur\nsimultaneously in both sepsis and ARDS. The \u201ctwo-activation theory of the endothelium\u201d12,13 succinctly explains this pathogenesis of EA-VMTD/DIT and identifies DIT as a\ndisease promoting all the clinical and hematologic syndromes.\n\nThe proposed thesis of endothelial molecular pathogenesis in ARDS is endotheliopathy\nthat initiates two important molecular events: (1) release of inflammatory cytokines\n(eg, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, adhesion molecules, and others)94,95,112\u2013114 and (2) activation of the platelet3 and exocytosis of ULVWF.115\u2013121 The former triggers inflammation, which process is called \u201cactivation of\ninflammatory pathway,\u201d and the latter mediates microthrombogenesis, which triggers\n\u201cactivation of microthrombotic pathway.\u201d These two independent pathways are the essence\nof the \u201ctwo-activation theory of the endothelium.\u201d The manifestation of activated\ninflammatory pathway is fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise, but that of activated\nmicrothrombotic pathway produces microthrombi strings composed of platelet-ULVWF\ncomplexes leading to VMTD.\n\nThe activation of endothelial inflammatory pathway occurs due to cytokines in both\nseptic and nonseptic critical illnesses. In sepsis-associated ARDS, the inflammation is\naccentuated, perhaps through additional loop of activated circulating immune cell\npathway (eg, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) interacting with\nactivated ECs.122 This pathway further upregulates the expression of inflammatory response,\nsometimes causing \u201ccytokine storm.\u201d This additional mechanism may explain why more\nsevere inflammation occurs in sepsis than in trauma. On the other hand, the activation\nof the microthrombotic pathway is promoted by excessively exocytosed ULVWF from injured\nECs. Following the endothelial release, ULVWF become anchored to injured ECs as long\nelongated strings.119\u2013121 If in addition to the excess of ULVWF, the protease ADAMTS13, which cleaves ULVWF\nto smaller molecular weight VWFs, is underexpressed due to additional underlying\nheterozygous gene mutation,123\u2013125 it is more likely to promote EA-VMTD/DIT. This endothelial molecular pathogenesis\nthrough activation of inflammatory pathway and microthrombotic pathway clearly explains\nevery hematologic feature and organ phenotypic syndrome occurring in ARDS.\n\nIn the past several decades, many proposals for redefinition of ARDS have been forwarded to\nidentify the pathophysiological mechanism and to improve the outcome of the disease with\nbetter classification and therapeutic design.126\u2013131 However, medical community\u2019s task finding the answer on the pathogenesis of ARDS has\nbeen far from over.\n\nNow, the recognition of ARDS as an expression of hemostatic disease that is characterized\nby VMTD has widely opened the door not only in the understanding of this life-threating\nphenotype organ syndrome but also in redefining other clinical MODS. Additionally, with the\nidentification of different thrombogenetic mechanisms of microthrombosis, fibrin clot\ndisease, and macrothrombosis, various thrombotic disorders could be more precisely defined\nthrough the submechanisms of in vivo hemostasis.8,10 Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most prominent organ phenotype syndromes\ndeveloping in sepsis and other critical illnesses among MODS. Thus, once we understand ARDS\nas an organ phenotype syndrome of the lungs in VMTD, we should be able to understand the\norgan syndromes due to VMTD occurring in the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, muscles,\nadrenals, and others. It also affirms generalized EA-VMTD/DIT is the underlying disease, and\nARDS and other organ syndromes are the manifestations of each specific organ phenotype in\nEA-VMTD/DIT. To make the matters simpler, the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic approach\nare the same in every phenotype of MODS. Finally, we should be able to treat all the\npatients with every organ phenotype syndrome, combined biorgan syndrome and MODS due to\nEA-VMTD/DIT with the same regimen focused on microthrombogenesis.\n\n\nTable 5 summarizes the identity\nof ARDS defined through clinical, etiologic, pathogenetic and phenotypic features of\nEA-VMTD. The pulmonary physiologic alteration of hypoxemia, increased capillary permeability\nand circulatory failure, pathologic changes of diffuse alveolar damage, exudative pulmonary\nedema, and hyaline membrane formation are the result of pulmonary vascular microthrombosis.\nThus, the therapy for ARDS should directly target the pathogenesis producing VMTD.\n\nIn addition to cardiopulmonary evaluation for physiological changes due to respiratory\ndistress as well as assessment of the underlying disease, the proper diagnostic approach\nof ARDS should start with hematological evaluation.\n\nFirst of all, every patient with ARDS should be evaluated for the potential of\nunrecognized TTP-like syndrome, which had been previously defined as \u201cDIC\u201d.9,11,12 Unexplained thrombocytopenia, after the exclusion of known causes of\nthrombocytopenia, should be an initial clue suggesting ongoing microthrombogenesis,\nleading to EA-VMTD/DIT. An additional finding of MAHA even with minimal degree of\nschistocytosis, if present, should confirm the diagnosis of TTP-like syndrome.9,12 To look for schistocytes and evidence of hemolysis, blood films should be examined\ndaily for several consecutive days by an experienced hematologist. Unlike\nantibody-associated TTP (AA-VMTD, acquired TTP), schistocytes are fewer in ARDS,23,24 perhaps due to difference in force of shear stress in the pulmonary vasculature. In\ncritical care settings, in the past, its hemostatic nature could have been missed due to\ninattention to blood films and low index of suspicion even though an evaluation for\nunexplained thrombocytopenia and anemia could have been attempted.23,24,132 In ARDS, thrombocytopenia and intravascular hemolysis (ie, anemia, reticulocytosis,\nincreased lactic acid dehydrogenase, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and hypohaptoglobinemia\nwith negative Coombs tests) might be the sufficient criteria to establish the diagnosis of\nTTP-like syndrome to begin life-saving TPE at the earliest possible time.\n\nTo solidify the concept that the underlying pathology of ARDS is EA-VMTD/DIC, this author\nrecommends to determine (1) ADAMTS13 activity and its autoantibody status, (2) ADAMTS13\ngene mutation study, and (3) fibrinogen quantitation, FVIII and VWF activity in\ncirculation, and coagulation factor assay for liver-dependent factors (ie, FII, FV, FVII,\nFIX, and FX) to determine the cause of coagulopathy (ie, hepatic coagulopathy). The\ndiagnostic assessments are summarized in Table 6. Since ARDS is one of MODS, clinicians\nshould stay vigilant with close clinical monitoring for developing additional organ\nphenotypes of MODS as illustrated in Figure 3.\n\nMore than a half century since the term ARDS coined, extensive controlled clinical\ntrials have conducted for ARDS to evaluate the effects of pharmaceutical agents, such as\nstatins, \u03b22 agonists, anti-inflammatory agents, and corticosteroids,133\u2013136 nutritional supplementation, such as glutamine, selenium, omega-3 fatty acid,137\u2013139 and antioxidant therapy such as N-acetyl cysteine140,141 in prevention and treatment. Unfortunately, all of the trials failed to\nsignificantly benefit the patient with ARDS.\n\nThe fact that the pathophysiologic mechanism of ARDS has not been clearly recognized\nand the failure of therapeutic regimens to restore the physiologic alteration of ARDS\nfrom endotheliopathy certainly indicates that the pathogenesis of ARDS is yet to be\ndiscovered. This author is confident that novel hemostatic \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d\nand \u201ctwo-activation theory of the endothelium\u201d uncover this long hidden mystery of the\npathogenesis of ARDS and should yield effective therapeutic regimens sooner than\nlater.\n\nIn addition to the best supportive care with proper antibiotics, ventilator support,\nand appropriate fluid and electrolyte balance for ARDS, it is obvious that therapeutic\napproach should target the pathogenesis itself. Since this newly recognized concept of\nthe pathogenesis is a hemostatic disease called pulmonary vascular microthrombosis (ie,\nTTP-like syndrome as a result of EA-VMTD/DIT) that is caused by the lone activation of\nULVWF path, the therapeutic design should be utilizing the inhibition of vascular\nmicrothrombogenesis.\n\nAt present, the only available antimicrothrombotic regimen is TPE. The rationale is\nmicrothrombosis produced by excessive production of ULVWF from endotheliopathy and\nrelative insufficiency of ADAMTS13 perhaps due to unsuspected gene mutation should\nrespond to additional supply of ULVWF-cleaving ADAMTS13 from exchange of normal donor\nplasma. Indeed, TTP-like syndrome associated with ARDS has shown excellent response to\nTPE when employed in very early stage.23,24,56 Since the lungs are the very organ responsible for oxygen supply to other organs,\nARDS is the most important organ phenotype among MODS that could hasten the demise of\nthe patient due to severe hypoxemia. At this time, the earliest intervention utilizing\nTPE is the only potentially effective treatment to save lives. Otherwise, once the\npatient is entrenched in mechanical ventilation with volume overload following\nintravenous fluid and blood transfusions, the recovery from ARDS may become remote even\nwith TPE.\n\nJust as in sepsis and septic shock,12 TPE has been used sporadically in ARDS even without understanding of the concept\nof microthrombogenesis and VMTD and has shown significant benefit with safety in case\nreports and limited clinical series.142\u2013147\n\n\nBoth TTP and TTP syndrome, including \u201cDIC,\u201d have shown the beneficial effect with TPE,12 which is a surrogate for replacement therapy of ADAMTS13 despite its technical\nlimitations and inconvenience. Theoretically, the most efficient therapeutic regimen\nwould be antimicrothrombotic agents, which could include recombinant ADAMTS13 and\npossibly N-acetyl cysteine.9,148\u2013150 Both agents are neither approved nor utilized for human use as defined\nantimicrothrombotic agents, although ADAMTS13 is in clinical trials for GA-VMTD. If we\ncan prove their benefit for ARDS, the therapeutic potential to save so many lives for\npatients with EA-VMTD/DIT in critical care medicine would be immeasurable.\n\nThe worsening thrombocytopenia (ie, TCIP) is the most important laboratory sign\nsuggesting progression of ARDS. In this situation, platelet transfusion might be\ntempting, but it is contraindicated in EA-VMTD/DIC because platelet transfusion would\nfurther promote microthrombogenesis and intensify MODS associated with DIT as well as\nMAHA and also may provoke TRALI syndrome. If hepatic coagulopathy coexist with ARDS, its\ncoagulopathy could rapidly progress to combined microthrombo-hemorrhagic syndrome, which\nwill demand a specialized care of coordination with a coagulation specialist.\n\nAt last, the pathogenesis of ARDS is identified to be a hemostatic disease occurring due to\nlone activation of ULVWF path of hemostasis as a result of endotheliopathy in critically ill\npatients. Its underlying pathology is EA-VMTD/DIT and clinical phenotype is TTP-like\nsyndrome. Generalized endotheliopathy activates the inflammatory pathway and microthrombotic\npathway, triggering EA-DIT/VMTD. The former provokes inflammation, and the latter promotes\nconsumptive thrombocytopenia, TTP-like syndrome, and hypoxic MODS. Systemic inflammatory\nresponse syndrome is combined syndrome from two independently activated endothelial\nmolecular pathogeneses. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the pulmonary organ phenotype\namong various TTP-like syndromes. Acute respiratory distress syndrome responds to the TPE if\ninitiated in very early stage of the disorder. Potentially effective targeted therapeutic\nstrategy should be explored with antimicrothrombotic agents at the earliest possible time to\nsave lives."}
