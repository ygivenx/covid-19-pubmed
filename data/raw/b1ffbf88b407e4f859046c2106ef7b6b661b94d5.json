{"title": "Inflammation Induced by Infection Potentiates Tau Pathological Features in Transgenic Mice Address reprint request to", "body": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia, afflicting \u03fe35 million individuals worldwide. The AD brain displays several characteristic pathological features, including the buildup of amyloid plaques composed of amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424), which can also accumulate intracellularly, and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. 1 Neuronal loss, dystrophic neurites, and dendritic spine loss are other critical changes that are well documented in AD. In addition, inflammation, as evidenced by reactive glial cells surrounding amyloid plaques, is consistently observed in the AD brain. [2] [3] [4] The factors and molecular mechanisms that affect the pathogenesis of AD still remain largely unknown, although it is widely accepted that this disorder is multifactorial. Certain factors and insults, such as hypoxia, brain ischemia, and stress, that dysregulate brain homeostasis and physiological functions may increase the susceptibility of developing AD (as comorbid factors). 5, 6 Thus, decades of research in epidemiology and postmortem AD brains has suggested that viral or bacterial infections may contribute to the onset of AD. 7, 8 With improved quantitative and analytical methods, several viral and bacterial genes, including herpes simplex virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Helicobacter pylori, have been isolated from AD brains; in some reports, 9 -11 the presence of these genes in AD brains is statistically significantly higher than in non-AD brains. Evidence from both in vivo and in vitro studies indicates that infections significantly exacerbate AD-like pathological changes, sug-gesting that infection-mediated alterations (ie, altered immune response) in the brain may increase the susceptibility of developing AD later in life. 12, 13 Brain inflammatory responses may contribute to this pathogenic process. 14 -16 Neuroinflammation in the AD brain likely plays both beneficial and harmful roles. 17 For example, chronic inflammation and cytokine up-regulation induce tau hyperphosphorylation in prepathological 3xTg-AD mice. 15 In addition, studies 18 -21 indicate that inflammatory processes are involved in clearing or degrading A\u2424 depositions. The deficiency of CCR2, a chemokine receptor, impairs microglia accumulation and increases A\u2424 deposition in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-transgenic mice, indicating a role for microglia in regulating A\u2424 accumulation. 22, 23 On the other hand, chronic lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation increases intraneuronal A\u2424 load in transgenic mice, 16, 24 possibly through the release of proinflammatory cytokines and other toxic species 25, 26 and the subsequent exacerbation of AD-related pathological features. 27, 28 Collectively, infection and neuroinflammation may well be linked to AD and may play key roles in the accelerated onset and development of the disease.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the role that viral and bacterial infections have on the development of the AD phenotype in the 3xTg-AD mouse model. Viral infection by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) or LPS to mimic a bacterial infection induced robust, but transient, neuroinflammation; exacerbated tau pathological characteristics; and compromised cognitive function in aged 3xTg-AD mice. LPS injection caused an increase in tau phosphorylation and its partition to the detergent-insoluble fraction, indicating a buildup of aggregated tau in neurons; the aberrant activation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u2424 was concomitantly detected in these mice. GSK-3\u2424 appears to be one of the main cellular mediators that is activated by infection-induced inflammation, underlying the increased tau pathological characteristics. To determine whether GSK-3\u2424 was a necessary mediator of the inflammation-induced changes in tau, we treated mice with lithium, a potent GSK-3\u2424 inhibitor, and found that its inhibition reversed both the tau hyperphosphorylation and its shift into the insoluble fraction. Significantly, treatment with lithium also led to an improvement in the cognitive phenotype. Together, our data strongly suggest that viral-or bacterial-mediated infections may act as critical comorbid factors and that tau pathological features are accelerated.\n\nAnimals 3xTg-AD and nontransgenic (NonTg) mice were maintained on a 12-hour light-dark cycle and had free access to food and water. In this study, 11-to 13-month-old 3xTg-AD or age-and strain-matched NonTg mice were used.\n\nLPS (from Escherichia coli 055:B5; Sigma, St Louis, MO) was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. LPS was administered i.p. to 12-month-old 3xTg-AD or NonTg mice at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight twice per week for 6 weeks [n \u03ed 9 (four females and five males) for 3xtg-AD mice and n \u03ed 12 (six females and six males) for NonTg mice)]. A control group of mice received injections in the same manner with 0.9% saline only [n \u03ed 10 (six females and four males) for 3xTg-AD mice and n \u03ed 9 (four females and five males) for NonTg mice)]. The amount of LPS injected was adjusted according to weight weekly. Mice were euthanized 48 hours after the last injection and perfused with ice-cold PBS, and their brains were isolated. Half of the brain was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and the other half was snap frozen in dry ice and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C.\n\nTwelve-month-old 3xTg-AD mice were divided into four groups: group 1, received standard rodent chow and saline injections [n \u03ed 6 (four females and two males)]; group 2, received standard rodent chow and LPS injections [n \u03ed 6 (four females and two males)]; group 3, received lithium chloride (2 g/kg) containing rodent chow (AIN-76A; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) and saline injections [n \u03ed 6 (four females and two males)]; and group 4, received lithium chloride containing rodent chow (AIN-76A) and LPS injections [n \u03ed 6 (four females and two males)]. LPS (0.5 mg/kg) or saline injections were given twice a week for 6 weeks, as previously described. No obvious weight loss was observed during the 6-week period, and lithium intake was estimated to be 6 to 10 mg/d per mouse based on the assumption that a mouse consumes 3 to 5 g/d of chow. During the last week of injections, mice underwent behavioral testing, as described later. Mice were euthanized 4 days after the last injection and perfused with ice-cold PBS, and their brains were isolated. Half of the brain was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and the other half was snap frozen in dry ice and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C.\n\nTo evaluate the impact of MHV infection on AD pathological characteristics, 11-to 13-month-old 3xTg-AD or NonTg mice were infected with the neuroadapted JHM strain of MHV suspended in HBSS or received an injection of HBSS alone as sham controls. 29, 30 Mice were anesthetized by i.p. injection of ketamine (80 to 100 mg/kg; Phoenix, St. Joseph, MO) and xylazine (5 to 10 mg/kg; MP Biomedicals, LLC, Aurora, OH), diluted in sterile HBSS. Anesthetized mice were injected intracranially with 500 plaque-forming units of the neurotrophic MHV strain J2.2-V.1 (provided by John Fleming, M.D., University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), diluted in 30 L of sterile HBSS (n \u03ed 34 to 37). [31] [32] [33] Sham control animals were injected with 30 L HBSS alone and did not develop any behavioral deficits.\n\nnophenotyped by fluorescence-activated cell sorted staining to define the surface antigens using established methods. 29 Brains were removed and stored on ice in 5 mL Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media until processing. The tissue was transferred to a sterile Petri dish and mashed into a single-cell suspension. The cell suspension was transferred to a 15-mL conical tube, and a medium (Percoll; GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) was added for a final concentration of 30%. The medium (70% Percoll), 1 mL, was underlain; and tubes were centrifuged at 1100 \u03eb g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Live cells were collected from the interface, washed twice, and stained for flow cytometric analysis. \n\nIntracellular staining for interferon-\u2425 was performed in cells isolated from the brains of MHV-infected control mice and transgenic mice. Cells were stimulated with 5 mol/L peptide from a control antigen or from the MHV spike glycoprotein (S510, residues 510 to 518). Stimulated cells were incubated for 6 hours at 37\u00b0C in media containing Golgi/Stop (Cytofix/Cytoperm kit; BD Biosciences), at which point cells were Fc blocked with anti-CD16/32, 1:200 (BD Biosciences). Cells were then stained with fluorescent antibodies (BD Biosciences) for the following cell surface markers: CD4 (L3T4), CD8a (53-6.7), and CD45 (30-F11; eBiosciences).\n\nSpinal cords were obtained from experimental groups at day 14 post infection (p.i.) and fixed by immersion overnight in 10% normal buffered formalin, after which portions of tissue were embedded in paraffin. Spinal cords (7-m sections) were stained with Luxol fast blue and analyzed by light microscopy. Demyelination was scored as follows: 0, no demyelination; 1, mild inflammation accompanied by loss of myelin integrity; 2, moderate inflammation with increasing myelin damage; 3, numerous inflammatory lesions accompanied by a significant increase in myelin stripping; and 4, intense areas of inflammation accompanied by numerous phagocytic cells engulfing myelin debris. Slides containing stained spinal cord sections were blinded and scored.\n\nFrozen brain halves were homogenized in tissue protein extraction reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL), protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mmol/L sodium fluoride and 50 mol/L sodium orthovanadate). Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were collected as the detergent-soluble fraction. Pellets were resuspended in 70% formic acid and homogenized. After centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C, the resulting supernatants were saved as the formic acid fraction. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. Equal amounts of protein (20 to 50 g, depending on the protein of interest) were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), transferred to 0.45-m polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blocked for 1 hour in 5% (v/v) nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20. Fractions were immunoblotted with antibodies that recognize APP, total tau (HT7), total endogenous tau (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), phosphorylated tau [AT8, Ser202/Thr205; AT180, Thr231/ Ser235; AT100, Thr212/Ser214; and paired helical filament (PHF-1), Ser396/Ser404 (Pierce)], p35/p25 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), cdk5 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), total GSK-3\u2423\u2424 or phospho-GSK-3\u2424 (Ser9) (both from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), or total GSK-3\u2424 (BD Biosciences). Antibody against \u2424-actin was used as a loading control. Formic acid fractions were neutralized by mixing equal amounts of sample, 10N NaOH, and neutralizing buffer (1 mol/L Tris base and 0.5 mol/L Na 2 HPO). Equal amounts of protein in the neutralized sample were separated on SDS-PAGE gels in the same manner as the soluble fractions. Quantification of band intensity was measured using software (Scion Image) and was normalized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, \u2424-actin, or total tau (HT7) levels (for phosphorylated tau analyses).\n\nFixed brain halves were sliced on a vibratome at 50 mol/L thickness. Before overnight incubation with primary antibody, sections were quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide plus 10% methanol, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 Tris-buffered saline, and blocked in solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin. After incubation with primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing 3% serum overnight, slices were washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 Tris-buffered saline and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody. The presence of secondary antibody in tissue was revealed by reaction with diaminobenzidine. Certain antigens required special conditions. A\u2424 staining required pretreatment with 90% formic acid. CD45 antigen required removal of detergent during antibody incubations.\n\nImages of stained hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala were acquired by a digital camera (Axiocam) connected to a microscope (Axioskop 50) (Carl Zeiss Mi-croImaging, Thornwood, NY) and software (AxioVision 4.6). A\u2424 plaques with a diameter \u03fe10 m were counted in three to four random fields of the CA1 hippocampus in each animal to quantitatively analyze the plaque number. For the analysis of phosphorylated tau-bearing neurons, AT8-or PHF-1-positive neurons in the subiculum and CA1 hippocampus were counted in each animal.\n\nTo measure A\u2424 levels, equal amounts of protein (200 g) from soluble fractions were loaded directly onto enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. Equal amounts of protein (200 g) from formic acid fractions were diluted 1:20 in neutralization buffer (1 mol/L Tris base and 0.5 mol/L Na 2 HPO) before loading. Before loading, antibody mA\u242420.1 at a concentration of 25 g/mL in coating buffer (0.1 mol/L NaCO 3 buffer, pH 9.6) was coated onto immunoplates (Nunc, Naperville, IL); and plates were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. Synthetic A\u2424 standards of both A\u242440 and A\u242442 were made in antigen capture buffer [20 mmol/L NaH 2 PO 4 , 2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.4 mol/L NaCl, 0.5 g (in 1 L total volume) of 3-([3-cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate, and 1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.0)] and loaded onto ELISA plates, along with soluble and formic acid fractions. Samples and standards were loaded in duplicate, and plates were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Plates were washed and probed with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-A\u242435-40 (MM32-13.1.1 for A\u24241-40) or anti-A\u242435-42 (MM40-21.3.4 for A\u24241-42) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The chromogen used was tetramethylbenzidine, and 30% O-phosphoric acid was used to stop the reaction. The concentration of samples was determined from readings at 450 nm.\n\nTo detect levels of IL-1\u2424 and IL-6 in homogenized brains, ELISA kits were purchased (Pierce) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer was followed. Briefly, samples were incubated with biotinylated antibodies against IL-1\u2424 and IL-6 on precoated plates. After incubation with a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase solution, tetramethylbenzidine chromogen was applied and the manufacturer-supplied stop solution was used. The concentration of samples was determined by reading at 450 nm.\n\nBrain samples were immunoprecipitated with protein G-agarose and GSK-3\u2424 antibody or protein A-agarose and cdk5 antibody. A reaction mixture containing 20 mmol/L 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (pH 7.2), 5 mmol/L MgCl 2 , 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 5 mmol/L NaF, 100 mol/L ATP, 2.5 Ci (\u2425-32 P)ATP, and 0.2 mmol/L cdk5 substrate (Calbiochem) for the cdk5 kinase assay or 0.2 mmol/L GSK-3\u2424 substrate (Calbiochem) for the GSK-3\u2424 assay. After allowing the reaction to proceed for 1 hour at 30\u00b0C, the supernatant was placed on P81 phosphocellulose squares (Upstate, Waltham, MA). After washing in 0.3% phosphoric acid, squares were counted in a scintillation counter to determine the kinase activity.\n\nThe apparatus used for the water maze task was a circular aluminum tank (1.2-m diameter), painted white and filled with water maintained at 22\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C. The maze was located in a room containing several simple visual extramaze cues. To reduce stress, mice were placed on the platform for 10 seconds before the first training trial. Mice were trained to swim to a 14-cm diameter circular clear Plexiglas platform submerged 1.5 cm beneath the surface of the water and invisible to the mice while swimming. The platform location was selected randomly for each mouse but was kept constant for each individual mouse throughout training. For each trial, the mouse was placed into the tank at one of four designated starting points in a pseudorandom order. Mice were allowed to find and escape onto the submerged platform. If a mouse failed to find the platform within 60 seconds, the mouse was manually guided to the platform and allowed to remain there for 10 seconds. Afterward, each mouse was placed into a holding cage under a warming lamp for 25 seconds until the start of the next trial. To ensure that memory differences were not because of lack of task learning, mice were given four trials a day for as many days as were required to train the lithium-untreated and lithium-treated 3xTg-AD mice to criterion (\u03fd20 seconds mean escape latency before the first probe trial was run). To control for overtraining, probe trials were run for each group, both as soon as they reached group criterion and after all groups had reached criterion. Retention of the spatial training was assessed 1.5 hours and again 24 hours after the last training trial. In the probe trials, the platform was removed from the pool and mice were monitored by a ceiling-mounted camera directly above the pool during the 60-second period. All trials were recorded for subsequent analysis. The parameters measured during the probe trial included the following: i) time spent in the target quadrant (the quadrant where the platform was located), ii) latency to cross the platform location, and iii) number of platform location crosses. Target quadrants varied between mice within a group to control for potential differences in the salience of extramaze cues.\n\nAll data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, with a posttest including a Dunnett, Bonferroni, or Newman-Keuls post hoc test or an unpaired t-test. P \u0545 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nWe first examined a temporal profile of central nervous system (CNS) immune responses after an acute viral infection in the CNS of mice. Both NonTg and 3xTg-AD mice were infected with MHV via a single unilateral injec-tion into the hippocampus, and this induced a robust neuroinflammatory response characterized by increased infiltration of macrophages (CD45 High or F4/80 \u03e9 ), activation of microglia (CD45 Low , F4/80 \u03e9 , or major histocompatibility complex class II positive), and infiltration of T cells (CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 ) (see Supplemental Figure S1 , A-C, at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). There was no significant difference in mortality between infected 3xTg-AD (25.4%) and NonTg (20.6%) mice. These infected mice successfully controlled viral replication, and viral titers within the brains were reduced to lower than detectable levels (approximately 100 plaque-forming units per gram of tissue) by day 12 p.i. (see Supplemental Figure S1D at http:// ajp.amjpathol.org). These findings indicate that no differences exist between aged 3xTg-AD and age-matched NonTg mice in limiting viral replication within the CNS. In support of this observation, no differences were detected in interferon-\u2425 secretion by resident cells within the CNS, as measured by major histocompatibility complex class II staining on resident microglia (see Supplemental Figure  S1B at http://ajp.amjpathol.org), and in virus-specific T cell infiltration in the CNS, as measured by interferon-\u2425 secretion by peptide-stimulated T cells (see Supplemental Figure S1E at http://ajp.amjpathol.org).\n\nGiven the evidence that both NonTg and 3xTg-AD mice exhibited the same immune responses against MHV infection, we investigated how the acute CNS insult and subsequent immune responses affected the long-lasting neuropathological changes in the brain and spinal cord. Thus, we examined neuropathological changes at 4 weeks after MHV injection, when no residual short-term immune responses were detected in the brain. We found detectable demyelination in the spinal cord of both NonTg and 3xTg-AD mice that received MHV injection, but not in sham-injected mice (see Supplemental Figure  S2 at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). Some mice also showed phenotypic signs of motor impairments; therefore, no cognitive tests were conducted in MHV-injected mice. Based on these results, we further examined detailed neuropathological changes and underlying mechanisms in 3xTg-AD mice at earlier points.\n\nAt 2 and 4 weeks after the MHV injection in aged 3xTg-AD mice, we analyzed the effect on A\u2424 and tau pathological characteristics. Although we detected a significant increase in \u2424-C-terminal fragment (CTF) (C99 fragment), but not in \u2423-CTF (C83 fragment), 2 weeks after infection ( Figure 1A ; see also Supplemental Figure S3 at http://ajp.amjpathol.org), the overall A\u2424 pathological features, as measured by quantitative ELISA and immunostaining, were not altered at both points (Figure 1 , B and C). However, marked exacerbation of the tau pathological characteristics in the brain was observed in MHV- \n\nNext, we sought to examine how sustained brain inflammation affected AD-like pathological characteristics. Because viral infection into the brain was efficiently cleared within 10 to 14 days, as previously described, we used an alternative approach, systemically injecting LPS repeatedly as a mimic of bacterial infection. This treatment paradigm has induced robust inflammation in the brain of several mouse models, including prepathological 3xTg-AD mice, but not aged mice. 15, 16, 34 Aged 3xTg-AD mice were injected with LPS for 6 weeks, which led to a marked increase in brain inflammation, as indicated by more CD45 \u03e9 infiltrated macrophages and microglia and by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines (see Supplemental Figure S4 , A-C, at http://ajp.amjpathol.org).\n\nDespite evidence of a chronic inflammatory response in the brain, the plaque load appeared similar between the LPS-injected and saline-treated 3xTg-AD mice because we did not detect any difference in the staining pattern for A\u2424 plaque pathological features using antibody 6E10 (Figure 2, C and D) . APP steady-state levels were unchanged in the LPS-treated mice, indicating that APP processing was likely unchanged (Figure 2A) . Fur-thermore, we quantitatively analyzed A\u24241-40 and A\u24241-42 levels in both the soluble and insoluble (ie, formic acid) fractions by ELISA and found that A\u2424 levels were not significantly different between LPS-and saline-treated groups ( Figure 2B ). Based on a previous study 15 in which LPS was injected into prepathological 3xTg-AD mice, and the results previously described, including use of a single MHV infection or long-term LPS injections into aged 3xTg-AD mice, we found that chronic inflammation does not appear to significantly affect the onset or progression of A\u2424 pathological characteristics.\n\nUnlike the effect on A\u2424, chronic inflammation significantly decreased tau steady-state levels in the detergentsoluble fraction by approximately 50% (Figure 3 , A and B). Despite decreases in soluble tau levels, higher levels of phospho-tau were observed in the soluble fraction of the LPS-treated mice (Figure 3, A and B) . Specifically, phosphorylation at the AT100 (Thr212/Ser214) site was significantly increased twofold compared with saline controls. In the LPS-treated mice, phosphorylation at Ser214 was significantly increased by 30%, whereas phosphorylation at Thr212 was decreased. Studies 35 have indicated that phosphorylation at Ser214 may inhibit further phosphorylation at Thr212, producing the pattern of phosphorylation observed herein. Favoring phosphorylation at Ser214 is also consistent with an increase in reactivity with the AT100 epitope because phosphorylation at Ser214 is required for formation of the AT100 epitope. 35 In addition, AT8 \u03e9 neurons were markedly increased (\u03fe10 times) in mice exposed to chronic inflammation (Figure 3, C and D) .\n\nBecause chronic inflammation appears to be exacerbating tau pathological features, and tau may be shifting to the insoluble fraction, we examined tau levels in the insoluble formic acid fraction. In LPS-treated mice, we observed a significant 50% increase in detergent-insoluble tau (Figure 4, A and B) . To determine whether this shift in tau to the insoluble fraction was associated with the development of more advanced tau pathological features, we examined levels of PHF-1-immunoreactive tau, which were significantly increased by 100% in the formic acid fractions of LPS-treated mice (Figure 4, A and B ). In addition, the number of PHF-1-immunoreactive neurons was significantly increased by 2.5 times in LPS-treated mice ( Figure 4C ). However, we were not able to detect any AD-like neurofibrillary tangles in these mice, suggesting that increased accumulation of insoluble tau in LPStreated mice could be pretangle tau, such as protofibrillar or oligomeric intermediates of tau, which may eventually turn into neurofibrillary tangle-like structures.\n\nNext, we investigated whether the exacerbation of tau pathological characteristics was mediated by aberrant activation of GSK-3\u2424 and cdk5. Previously, aberrant cdk5/p25 activation exacerbated tau phosphorylation in prepathological young 3xTg-AD mice. 15 Interestingly, in this study, we observed a significant 50% decrease in levels of p35 and p25 in the LPS-injected aged 3xTg-AD mice ( Figure 5, A and B) . On the other hand, we detected a significant decrease in levels of GSK-3\u2424 phosphorylated at Ser9 in LPS-treated mice ( Figure 5, A and B) . Radioactive kinase assays further confirmed that GSK-3\u2424 activity was significantly increased by 25.2% in mice exposed to chronic inflammation, whereas there was no significant difference in cdk5 activity between saline-and LPS-treated mice ( Figure 5C ). This discrepancy between young and aged 3xTg-AD mice may be the result of a different temporal activation pattern of cdk5 and GSK-3\u2424 in the brain. At least in the 3xTg-AD mouse model, cdk5/ p25 activation was detected at a younger age, peaked at approximately 12 months, and then decreased during aging, whereas GSK-3\u2424 activity increased in an agedependent manner up to the age of 15 months (see Supplemental Figure S5 , A and B, at http://ajp.amjpathol. org). Our findings collectively show that infection-induced inflammatory responses in the brain play a key role in exacerbating tau pathological features through dysregulated kinase activity, particularly mediated by GSK-3\u2424.\n\nTo confirm that increased GSK-3\u2424 activity underlies the enhanced phosphorylation of tau induced by LPS in older mice, we treated LPS-injected mice with lithium, a wellestablished potent inhibitor of GSK-3\u2424. Similar to the previous experiments, LPS (0.5 mg/kg) was injected twice a week for 6 weeks into 12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. One group of mice was maintained on normal feed, whereas another group was given lithium-enriched feed. Previously, this amount of lithium in the feed has inhibited GSK-3\u2424 activity. 36 A cohort of mice was subjected to behavioral tasks, mice were sacrificed after the 6-week period, and their brains were harvested.\n\nTreating mice with lithium reversed several pathological effects of chronic inflammation. In particular, GSK-3\u2424, phosphorylated at Ser9, was significantly increased in lithium-treated mice, indicating successful inhibition of GSK-3\u2424 activity ( Figure 6, A and B) . We observed a significant threefold increase in detergent-soluble tau levels in lithium-treated mice, along with a significant threefold decrease in tau phosphorylated at AT8 in the soluble fraction ( Figure 6, A and B ). In addition, in the insoluble fraction, PHF-1-positive tau was significantly decreased threefold compared with mice treated with LPS only (Figure 6 , C and D). Lithium treatment appeared to reverse the LPS-induced tau pathological characteristics without altering the A\u2424 load or the inflammatory responses, as measured by IL-1\u2424 and IL-6 ( Figure 7 , A-C).\n\nChronic inflammation in the brains of LPS-treated mice induced learning and memory impairments. In the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task, the LPS-treated mice took lon- ger to reach criterion, indicating impairments in learning ( Figure 8A ). Mice with elevated inflammation also exhibited a significant increase in escape latency to cross the platform location and decrease the number of crosses of the platform location at both 1.5-and 24-hour probe trials (Figure 8 , B and C). In comparison, age-matched NonTg mice that received LPS in the same manner also exhibited a delayed latency to cross the platform location at the 24-hour probe trial, yet to a much lower degree than that in LPS-treated 3xTg-AD mice (see Supplemental Figure  S6A at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). The number of platform crosses was, unlike 3xTg-AD mice, not different between sham and LPS treatments in NonTg mice (see Supplemental Figure S6B at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). Endogenous tau phosphorylation and insoluble tau levels were concomitantly increased in LPS-treated NonTg mice (see Supplemental Figure S6C at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). Our data suggested that cognition was much more affected in 3xTg-AD mice, possibly because of the presence of pathological mutant tau and the exacerbation of tau pathological characteristics. These results were, in part, confirmed by the fact that lithium treatment reversed the behavioral impairments induced by chronic inflammation. Mice treated with both lithium and LPS performed comparably to salinetreated animals in the MWM. In contrast, LPS-treated mice perform significantly worse than saline controls. In addition, mice treated with both lithium and LPS have significantly less latency to cross the platform compared with LPStreated mice in the probe trials (Figure 8 , B and C).\n\nThe present study demonstrates that acute or chronic viral or bacterial infections that modulate brain inflammatory responses markedly affect the development of tau pathological features in a mouse model of AD. The inflammationmediated exacerbation of tau pathological features leads to impairments in cognition that are effectively blocked by inhibiting GSK-3\u2424 activity. Previously, young prepathological 3xTg-AD mice exhibited increased tau phosphorylation in CA1 neurons after LPS-induced inflammation, 15 suggesting that sustained brain inflammation triggers tau pathological features. This pathological role of inflammation is further supported by another study 37 showing that inflammation precedes tau tangle formation in a mouse model Acquisition curve during the training of MWM. LPS-treated mice require more training to reach criterion. B: LPS-treated mice have a significantly increased latency to cross the platform location in the 1.5-hour probe trial. LPS-treated mice cotreated with lithium perform significantly better than mice treated with LPS only. *P \u03fd 0.05 or **P \u03fd 0.01 versus the saline-treated group, and ***P \u03fd 0.05 versus the LPS-treated group.

The present study provides novel evidence that chronic inflammation, as triggered by viral infection or LPS injection, initiates and contributes to the progression of tau pathological features and cognitive impairment in aged 3xTg-AD mice. We observed increased tau phosphorylation at several epitopes, including Ser202/ Thr205 (AT8) and Ser396/Ser404 (PHF-1), and increased detergent-insoluble tau accumulation in LPS-injected mice. Interestingly, however, we were not able to detect tanglelike pathological features of tau in these mice at this age. The increase in detergent-insoluble tau or somatodendritic tau accumulation after the administration of infectious agents may be mediated by increased formation of pretangle tau, such as protofibrillar or oligomeric tau intermediates, that may play an important role in neuronal loss, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive impairments. 38 These changes in tau pathological characteristics were associated with dysregulation of GSK-3\u2424 kinase activity, consistent with numerous mouse models that show that GSK-3\u2424 becomes the primary modulator of tau phosphorylation as mice age. 39 -41 Interestingly, in contrast to previous observations in young prepathological 3xTg-AD mice, we find a significant decrease in p35, a coregulator of cdk5, without an increase in the generation of p25; cdk5 activity was decreased in older mice with chronic inflammation. As mice age, cdk5 becomes a regulator of GSK-3\u2424 activity, with studies 39, 41 showing that increased cdk5 activity can induce phosphorylation of GSK-3\u2424 at the Ser9 site, leading to inhibition of GSK-3\u2424 activity. GSK-3\u2424 is not considered a direct substrate for cdk5, but cdk5 may mediate its actions through either up-regulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway or inhibition of protein phosphatases. 41, 42 Thus, the decreased cdk5 activity observed in older mice with chronic inflammation may be partly responsible for the significant increase in GSK-3\u2424 activity observed.\n\nDysregulation of kinase activity and subsequent tau hyperphosphorylation have been implicated to be important in the development of tau aggregates and ultimately the classic tangles observed in the AD brain. 43 We demonstrate that inflammation is, in part, responsible for altered kinase activity in the brain, further exacerbating tau pathological features in neurons. The inhibition of GSK-3\u2424 by lithium and subsequent blockade of tau phosphorylation attenuated detergent-insoluble tau and improved cognitive function in these mice. Previously, no significant rescue effect of lithium was found on cognition of aged (16 months) 3xTg-AD mice. 44 The discrepancy with our present study may be, in part, because of the ages of mice, which significantly affect both AD-like neuropathological and cognitive impairments. The age we used in this study (11 to 13 months) may still be young enough so that cognitive impairments can be reversed by modulating pathological changes. Thus, our data indicate that tau phosphorylation is an important process for the formation of pretangle tau intermediates and tau aggregation or neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, our data suggest that GSK-3\u2424 hyperactivity and the subsequent increase in phospho-tau accumulation may partly contribute to the early cognitive impairment in 3xTg-AD mice. Hyperphosphorylation of tau is known to reduce its stability, which can, in turn, cause axonal transport deficits. 45, 46 The integrity of the axonal transport system is crucial for maintaining proper synapse function. 47 Deficits in synapse function secondary to the hyperphosphorylation of tau may underlie the cognitive dysfunction observed in mice with chronic inflammation. A recent study 48 showed that inhibiting GSK-3\u2424 activity or genetically reducing GSK-3\u2424 levels prevents memory reconsolidation. In contrast, our data show that long-lasting elevated GSK-3\u2424 activity impairs learning and memory, consistent with a study 49 showing memory impairments on short-term hyperactivation of GSK-3\u2424. Thus, although normal activity of GSK-3\u2424 may be necessary for memory consolidation, hyperactive or long-lasting active GSK-3\u2424 and consequent hyperphosphorylation of tau is likely detrimental to learning and memory.\n\nOur study particularly focuses on the pathological involvement of GSK-3\u2424 on tau pathological characteristics after chronic inflammation, and lithium was used as an inhibitor for GSK-3\u2424. Lithium may activate other beneficial pathways to facilitate tau degradation. Lithium is known to inhibit protein phosphatase 2A to maintain the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3\u2424. 50, 51 A recent study 52 demonstrates that lithium also activates autophagy by inhibiting inositol monophosphatase. Autophagy has degraded aberrant protein aggregates in cytosol and attenuated disease conditions. 53, 54 How phosphorylated tau is effectively degraded after lithium treatment is still an open question.\n\nIn conclusion, we find that viral infection or LPS-mediated changes in brain inflammation can exacerbate both tau pathological characteristics and cognitive decline in the aged 3xTg-AD mice. The immune responses are altered and become dysfunctional during aging. 55 Therefore, infectious agents may not be as detrimental in young individuals when the immune responses can be properly regulated, but this becomes more deleterious in older individuals. However, the LPS injection used in our study does not completely mimic bacterial infections, and some of its course of action may be different. For example, the course of duration is much shorter compared with typical bacterial infections, and the lack of bacterial foci may influence the host immune responses. Despite these differences, LPS is still widely used as a surrogate for bacterial infection, and its actions on inflammatory responses are robust and comparable to bacterial infections. Overall, we believe this work is significant because it shows that certain microbial infections may act as comorbid factors for AD, which, based on the evidence we observed herein, appear to act mainly by affecting tau pathological features and exacerbating cognitive decline."}
