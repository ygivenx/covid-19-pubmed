{"title": "In-silico screening for anti-Zika virus phytochemicals", "body": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus that belongs to the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. Other members of the genus include the West Nile virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus [1] . Zika virus was initially isolated from a rhesus monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda [2] . There had been sporadic human infections in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia [3] . However, in 2007 there was an outbreak in Yap Island (Micronesia) and subsequent epidemics in French Polynesia, New Caledonia, the Cook Islands, and Easter Island between 2013 and 2014 [4] . In 2015 the number of human infections with ZIKV showed a dramatic increase in the tropical Americas, particularly Brazil [5, 6] . By the end of 2015, there have been an estimated 0.5-1.3 million cases of ZIKV infection [7] .\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes, including Ae. aegypti, Ae. africanus, Ae. apicoargenteus, Ae. furcifer, Ae. hensilli, Ae. luteocephalus, and Ae. vitattus [3] . However, there is now evidence that the disease can be sexually transmitted; replicative Zika viruses have been found in the semen of an infected man [8] . In addition, there is evidence that the virus can be transmitted replication and virus particle formation. They are essential for viral replication and have been identified as potential drug targets [17] .\n\nThe flavivirus NS5 methyltransferase (MTase) enzyme is responsible for methylating the viral RNA cap structure [18] . Viruses deficient in cap methylation result in attenuated or non-replicative viruses, and therefore, MTase is an attractive target for discovery of antiviral agents [19, 20] .\n\nRNA-dependent RNA polymerases are employed by flaviviruses and are responsible for initiating and catalyzing replication of viral RNA synthesis in the cytoplasm of infected cells. There are no similar enzymes found in the host since host cells do not require RNA replication. This enzyme, then, is considered to be a prime target for antiviral development [21, 22] .\n\nIn this work, we have carried out an in-silico search for potential anti-Zika viral agents from natural sources. We have generated ZIKV protease, methyltransferase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase using homology modeling techniques and we have carried out molecular docking analyses of our in-house virtual library of phytochemicals with these protein targets and with the X-ray crystal structure of ZIKV helicase.\n\nCurrently there is only one protein structure available (helicase, PDB 5JMT [23] ) for Zika virus non-structural proteins. Homology models for each of the other Zika proteins listed in Table 1 were constructed from crystal structure templates found in the Protein Data Bank using FASTA sequences downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) GenBank. Sequences with high sequence similarity in the PDB were identified with NCBI's BLAST utility using the BLOSUM80 scoring matrix. Sequences with high similarity to the reference sequence, as well as having good coverage for the active sites in the protein, were chosen for single reference homology modeling.\n\nThe protein sequences were first aligned to their respective template sequences using the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix and a protein backbone constructed and superposed to the reference structure using the protein alignment tool in MOE 2014.0901. The homology modeling interface in MOE was used to generate a set of putative protein structures by aligning atomic coordinates of the amino acid sequence to those of the template sequence backbone and minimizing permutations of side chain orientations using the AMBER10:EHT force field [24] [25] [26] with reaction field solvation. The candidate structure with the lowest RMSD deviation from the template backbone was selected and optimized using a constrained minimization.\n\nThe homology models for the NS3 protease was generated for the stretch of the whole Zika protein (accession number Q32ZE1) that correspond to the incomplete 257 amino acid NSP3 sequence, AHL16750.1, found in the NCBI GenBank. The closest matching template in the PDB was the combined NSP3 Protease-Helicase from Dengue Virus (2WHX) [27] . The protease binding site in this template is poorly defined in the crystal structure with the highest similarity (2WV9) [28] , so a second template, from the homologous protease in West Nile Virus (2FP7; exp. value 4 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ) [29] with a bound ligand (Bz-Nle-Lys-Arg-Arg-H; (N-benzoyl-l-norleucyl-6-ammonio-l-norleucyl-N-5-[amino(imino)methyl]-N-[(2S)-5carbamimidamido-1-hydroxypentan-2-yl]-l-ornithinamide)) was used to generate a homology model specifically for the protease. Since the sequence similarity with the NS3 protease is much lower for this template, a constrained minimization of the peptidereceptor complex was carried out using the AMBER10:EHT force field and the bound peptide removed prior to docking. The RMSD between 2FP7 and the homology model is 0.753 \u00c5 for all common atoms. The binding interactions for both are shown in Fig. 1 . The GenBank protein sequence A0A0B4ZYV2 was used for the NS5 methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase homology models using the relevant portion of the complete NS5 protein from Japanese Encephalitis Virus (4K6M) [30] . A second homology model for NS5 RdRp was generated using the template structure 2HFZ from West Nile Virus [31] . Protein sequence alignments and Ramachandran plots of the template proteins and the homology modeled ZIKV proteins are available as Supplementary material.\n\nProtein-ligand docking studies were carried out based on homology-modeled structures of Zika virus (ZIKV) NSPB/NS3 protease, based on the crystal structure of Murray Valley encephalitis virus protease, PDB 2WV9 [28] ; ZIKV NS5 methyltransferase (MTase), based on the crystal structure of Japanese encephalitis virus methyltransferase, PDB 4K6M [30] ; and ZIKV NS5 RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), based on crystal structures of West Nile virus RdRp, PDB 2HFZ [31] and Japanese encephalitis virus RdRp, PDB 4K6M [30] . Molecular docking calculations for all compounds with each of the proteins were undertaken using Molegro Virtual Docker (version 6.0, Molegro ApS, Aarhus, Denmark) [32] , with a sphere large enough to accommodate the cavity centered on the binding sites of each protein structure in order to allow each ligand to search. Standard protonation states of the proteins based on neutral pH were used in the docking studies. Each protein was used as a rigid model structure; no relaxation of the protein was performed. Assignments of charges on each protein were based on standard templates as part of the Molegro Virtual Docker program; no other charges were necessary to be set. Overall, 2263 plantderived secondary metabolites have been docked. This molecule set was comprised of 384 alkaloids (158 indole alkaloids, 143 isoquinoline alkaloids, 5 quinoline alkaloids, 18 piperidine alkaloids, 14 steroidal alkaloids, and 46 miscellaneous alkaloids), 670 terpenoids (35 monoterpenoids, 153 sesquiterpenoids, 212 diterpenoids, 83 steroids, 51 limonoids, 42 withanolides, and 97 triterpenoids), 1043 polyphenolic compounds (22 aurones, 72 chalcones, 9 chromones, 111 coumarins, 297 flavonoids, 113 isoflavonoids, 69 lignans, 69 stilbenoids, 29 xanthones, and 172 miscellaneous phenolics), and 166 miscellaneous phytochemicals. This in-house virtual library represents a practical selection of phytochemical classes and structural types. Each ligand structure was built using Spartan '14 for Windows (version 1.1.8, Wavefunction Inc., Irvine, California). For each ligand, a conformational search and geometry optimization was carried out using the MMFF force field [33] . Flexible ligand models were used in the docking and subsequent optimization scheme. Variable orientations of each of the ligands were searched and ranked based on their re-rank score. For each docking calculation the maximum number of iterations for the docking algorithm was set to 1500, with a maximum population size of 50, and 30 runs per ligand. The RMSD threshold for multiple poses was set to 1.00 \u00c5. The generated poses from each ligand were sorted by the calculated re-rank score. In analyzing the docking scores, we have attempted to account for the recognized bias toward high molecular weight compounds [34] [35] [36] [37] . We have used two different schemes to re-evaluate the Molegro docking scores (E dock ): (1) E = 6.96 \u00d7 E dock /MW 1 \u20443 , which accounts for biasing by dividing by a molecular weight function (MW), where 6.96 is a scaling con- \n\nA total of 2263 plant-derived natural products have been docked with Zika virus NS2B-NS3 protease, NS3 helicase, NS5 methyltransferase, and NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Selected phytochemical ligands with notable docking profiles and that adhere to Lipinski's rule-of-five for drug likeness [38] are listed in Table 2 .\n\nThe homology modeled ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease is a small (148 residues) protein. Most low-molecular-weight ligands docked into a small hydrophobic binding site bounded by Gln1572, Thr1664, Asn1650, Lys1571, and Ile1621. Phytochemical ligands with good docking scores with ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease are listed in Table 2 . Only two alkaloids obeyed Lipinski's rule [38] and showed notable docking to ZIKV protease, the bis-indole alkaloids flinderole A and flinderole B. The flinderoles docked with ZIKV protease such that one of the indole moieties occupied the hydrophobic binding site, while the other indole, along with the amide side chain, was places near the active site histidine (His1549) (Fig. 2) .\n\nThe chalcones angusticornin B and kuraridin showed promising docking properties with ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease ( Table 2 ). The lowest-energy pose of the bis-hydroxyprenylated chalcone angusticornin B placed the hydroxyprenylated B-ring into the hydrophobic cavity, with none of the ligand occupying the active site of the protease Ser1633 and His1549 (Fig. 3A) . Kuraridin preferentially docked to ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease placing the diprenyl-substituted A-ring into the hydrophobic cavity and the Bring also not occupying the active site (Fig. 3B) . Although the ligands in Table 2 did show relatively strong docking to ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease, the docking energies are less than those for other ZIKV target proteins, likely a consequence of the small (42 \u00c5 3 ) binding pocket in the protease. Thus, it is unlikely that these ligands will exhibit selective protease inhibition.\n\nThe X-ray crystal structure of ZIKV helicase has recently been determined [23] . There are two binding sites for flavivirus NS3 helicases, an RNA binding site and an ATP binding site [83, 84] .\n\nMost phytochemical ligands showed more exothermic docking energies with the ATP site over the RNA site of ZIKV NS3 helicase. For example, the isoquinoline alkaloid cassiarin D showed very strong docking to the ATP site (E dock = \u2212150.7 kJ/mol). In addition, cassiarin D showed some docking selectivity toward the ATP site of helicase (Fig. 4A) . Similarly, the flavonoids 3 -Omethyldiplacone and exiguaflavanone A, and the sesquiterpenoid lactucopicrin docked selectively with the ATP site of helicase. Several other phytochemical ligands (e.g., the aurones kanzonol V, the chalcones angusticornin B, balsacone B, and kanzonol Y, and the lignans hibalactone and kaerophyllin) also showed remarkably strong interactions with the ATP site of helicase. Interestingly, the bisindole alkaloid 4,4 -dimethylisoborreverine was selective for the RNA site of ZIKV NS3 helicase (Fig. 4B) . The intermolecular interactions between the ligands and the helicase protein are illustrated in Fig. 4 .\n\nNon-structural protein 5 is made up of two domains. The N-terminal domain contains the methyltransferase (MTase) domain, while the C-terminus contains the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. The methyltransferase domain is comprised of two binding sites, the GTP binding site and the SAM binding site [85] . The phytochemical ligands in this study docked preferentially to the GTP site rather than the SAM site.\n\nThe best docking ligands for ZIKV NS5 MTase from this study were polyphenolic compounds with at least two phenolic groups, preferably connected with a flexible linker. Thus, for example, cimiphenol, cimiracemate B, and rosemarinic acid exhibited relatively strong docking energies. Prenyl substituents also decreased docking energies; the prenylated chalcones kanzonol Y and kuraridin showed excellent docking properties. Likewise, the prenylated aurone kanzonol V and the geranylated flavone solophenol D also showed strong docking to ZIKV MTase. Interestingly, the lignan (\u2212)-asarinin showed good docking to MTase (E dock = \u2212126.4 kJ/mol), but its epimer, (+)-sesamin, showed weaker docking (E dock = \u2212101.1 kJ/mol). Key interactions between the phenolic ligands and the MTase binding site are Lys2619, Ile2661, Gly2959, Thr2618, and Glu2625 (see Fig. 5 ).\n\nThe ZIKV NS5 RdRp homology-modeled structure based on the Japanese encephalitis virus NS5 (PDB 4K6M) [30] has a very large binding cavity (\u223c2852 \u00c5 3 ). There were four major docking sites of phytochemical ligands with this protein structure (see Fig. 6 ), site A, with major interactions between the docked ligands and Asp3054, Asp3179, Tyr3123, Arg2987, and Ser3177; site B, with major interacting residues Trp3311, Arg3245, Ser3312, and Ser3226; site C, with residues Arg3245, His3246, His3227, His3228, and Trp3362; and site D, bounded by residues Met2970, Leu3096, Pro2863, and Gln2829.\n\nSmall hydrophobic ligands such as the monoterpenoids and naphthoquinones docked preferentially in sites C (58%) and D (38%). Large hydrophobic ligands, the triterpenoids, on the other hand, tended to concentrate in sites A (20%), B (51%), and C (18%). The best docking ligands to NIKV NS5 RdRp were aromatic ligands, particularly polyphenolics. The prenylated chalcone, 2 ,4,4 -trihydroxy-3,3 -diprenylchalcone, docked preferentially into site A (Fig. 7A) while the bis-indole alkaloid flinderole B docked into site B (Fig. 7B) . The polyphenoic compound 4 ,7digalloylcatechin docked into site C (Fig. 7C) , and the lignan di-O-demethylisoguaiacin docked into site D (Fig. 7D) . Notably, the homology model of ZIKV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase based on the West Nile virus template (PDB 2HFZ) has a much smaller binding cavity than the model based on the Japanese encephalitis virus NS5 template (PDB 4K6 M), 302 \u00c5 3 and 2852 \u00c5 3 , respectively. Because of this, nearly all of the docking ener-gies (2164 of the total 2263 ligands) were lower for the 4K6M model than the 2HFZ model; an average E dock difference of 11.8 kJ/mol per ligand. It would appear, based on these data, that the homology model based on WNV RdRp is a poorer model than that based on JEV. \n\nThe best docking phytochemical ligands were the polyphenolics, which generally docked strongly to several of the protein targets. The poorest docking ligands were the terpenoids, in particular the monoterpenoids, owing to their small size, and the triterpenoids, likely due to their paucity of functional groups.\n\nThere are several phytochemical ligands that had shown good selective docking properties and that are found in relatively common medicinal herbs. For example, balsacone B is found in the buds of balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), kanzonol V is found in licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra), cinnamoylechinaxanthol is found in Echinacea root; cimiphenol is found in black cohosh (Actaea racemosa, syn. Cimicifuga racemosa); and rosemarinic acid is found in several common herbs including rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), and common sage (Salvia officinalis). Hence, there are several common medicinal plants that may serve as antiviral agents themselves or ready sources of potential antivirals. We hope that this study encourages research into antiviral screening of medicinal plants and phytochemicals to identify antiviral agents and lead structures for structure-based design for new chemotherapeutics to treat Zika viral infections as well as other neglected tropical diseases.
