{"title": "General Categories of Cytologic Interpretation", "body": "One use of cytology is to classify lesions so as to assist with the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of a case. Cytologic interpretations are generally classified into one of five cytodiagnostic groups (Box 2-1). A sixth category can be used for nondiagnostic or artifact interpretations. Nondiagnostic samples usually result from insufficient cellular material or excessive blood contamination.\n\nNormal tissue is generally composed primarily of mature cell types, although some organs such as integumentary normally contain immature basal epithelium. Normal cells display uniformity in cellular, nuclear, and nucleolar size and shape. Cytoplasmic volume is usually high relative to the nucleus (Figs. 2-1 and 2-2).\n\nHyperplasia is a non-neoplastic enlargement of tissue that can occur in response to hormonal disturbances or tissue injury. Hyperplastic tissue has a tendency to enlarge symmetrically in comparison to neoplasia. Cytologically, hyperplastic cells may appear similar to normal tissue but have a higher nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio than normal mature cells. Examples of hyperplastic responses include nodular proliferations within the parenchyma of the prostate (Fig. 2-3) , liver (see Fig. 9 -20A), and pancreas ( Fig. 2-4 ).\n\nCystic lesions contain liquid or semisolid material. The lowprotein liquid usually contains a small number of cells. These benign lesions may result from proliferation of lining cells or tissue injury. Examples include seroma , salivary mucocele, apocrine sweat gland cyst, epidermal/follicular cyst (see Fig. 3 -2), and cysts associated with noncutaneous glands such as the mammary gland or prostate ( Fig. 2-6 ).\n\nInflammatory conditions are classified cytologically by the predominance of the cell type involved. Recognition of the inflammatory cell type often suggests an etiologic condition.\n\nPurulent or suppurative lesions contain greater than 85% neutrophils; they are then classified by the presence or absence of nuclear degeneration of the neutrophil. Nondegenerate neutrophils are morphologically normal with mature condensed chromatin and well-segmented purple lobes. These neutrophils predominate in relatively nontoxic environments such as immune-mediated diseases ( Fig. 2-7A ), neoplastic lesions , and sterile conditions caused by irritants such as urine and bile ( Fig. 2-7C ). Degenerate neutrophils display early signs of oncotic necrosis with observable cellular and nuclear swelling with decreased nuclear stain intensity. In cytology, this early recognizable change is termed karyolysis (Fig. 2-8 ). Karyolysis is attributed to decreased mitochondria function to produce ATP that maintains transmembrane ion pumps resulting in an influx of sodium, calcium, and water (hydropic degeneration) as well as to damaged cell membranes that result in release of endonucleases that degrade RNA and DNA. This often indicates rapid cell death in a toxic or injurious environment (Perman et al., 1979) . Degenerate neutrophils predominate in bacterial infections, particularly gram-negative types that produce endotoxins. Cytologically, under conditions of neutrophil degeneration, small infectious agents must be found intracellularly to confidently report it as septic neutrophilic inflammation ( Fig. 2-9 ).\n\nKaryolysis as a histologic term describes cell death in the form of a ghost nucleus or nuclear remnants that precede eventual nuclear loss or dissolution. In contrast to acute cell injury involving cellular and nuclear swelling, cell death may occur more slowly through a shrinkage phenomenon (apoptosis). While apoptosis often occurs in isolated cells during normal n FIGURE 2-1 Normal skeletal muscle. Tissue aspirate. Dog. Numerous threadlike myofibrils compose each cell with small, condensed, and oval nucleus. Cross-striations, characteristic of skeletal muscle, are visible against the dark blue cytoplasm. (Modified Wright; HP oil.) n FIGURE 2-2 Normal salivary gland. Tissue aspirate. Dog. The gland has uniform features of nuclear size, nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and cytoplasmic content. (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.) n FIGURE 2-3 Canine prostatic hyperplasia. Tissue aspirate. Dog.\n\nThe presenting clinical sign in this case involves blood dripping from the prepuce. Cytologically, the nuclear size is uniform; however, the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio is increased as indicated by the close proximity of nuclei to each other. (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.) n FIGURE 2-4 Nodular hyperplasia of the pancreas. Tissue aspirate. Dog. Ultrasound examination revealed a hypoechoic mass in the area of the pancreas. Cytologically, hyperplastic parenchymal organs commonly display binucleation (arrows). (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.) n FIGURE 2-5 Seroma. Tissue aspirate. Dog. Blood-tinged fluid is removed from a swelling on the neck. There is low cellularity (3800/\u03bcL) and low protein content (2.5 g/dL). Cytologically, the direct smear contains a mixed cell population with large mononuclear cells having fine cytoplasmic granularity along with low numbers of erythrocytes. n FIGURE 2-8 Degenerate neutrophils, karyorrhexis. Tissue aspirate. Dog. Mild to moderate karyolysis of neutrophils is evident by the decreased nuclear stain intensity and swollen nuclear lobes. Pyknosis of multiple nuclear segments appears as dark, dense, round structures, termed karyorrhexis (arrows), in this case of bacterial dermatitis. (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.) n FIGURE 2-9 Bacterial sepsis. Tissue aspirate. Dog. Markedly karyolytic neutrophils are present with intracellular coccoid bacteria. Karyolysis is so severe that the cells are barely recognizable as neutrophils. A fragmenting erythrocyte is helpful for size comparison to demonstrate neutrophil swelling. (Modified Wright; HP oil.) physiologic cell aging ( Fig. 2-10A) , it may be found alongside pathologic cell death characterized by widespread nuclear destruction and necrosis.\n\nIncreased nuclear staining (hyperchromia) with coalescence of the nucleus into a single or two dark basophilic round segments characterizes pyknosis (Fig. 2-10B ). If pyknosis is related to a slow, progressive change within a relatively nontoxic environment, an intact cell membrane may be present around the shrunken, more eosinophilic cell as occurs with normal cell aging. An end stage of nuclear breakdown termed karyorrhexis or karyorhexis (Mastrorilli et al., 2013) may be seen as the result of pyknosis of hypersegmented nuclei ( Fig. 2-8 ) or fragmentation of chromatin of an individual dying cell ( Fig. 2-11 ) as seen on both cytology and histology. Histiocytic or macrophagic lesions contain a predominance of macrophages, suggesting chronic inflammation (Fig. 2-12) . Foamy, often vacuolated, and phagocytic cells characterize this type of inflammation.\n\nIn contrast, granulomatous lesions consisting of activated macrophages that morphologically resemble epithelial cells form in response to foreign material or persistent intracellular infectious agents and have a secretory rather than phagocytic activity. These cells are therefore termed epithelioid macrophages and recognized by their abundant basophilic cytoplasm and large polygonal shape (Fig. 2-13A ). Epithelioid macrophages under the influence of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators undergo macrophage fusion to form giant multinucleated forms ( Fig. 2-13B ). Granulomas are often associated with foreign body reactions and mycobacterial infections and may be recognized cytologically by the presence of epithelioid macrophages and/or multinucleate cells.\n\nMixed cell inflammatory lesions contain a mixture of neutrophils and macrophages ( Fig. 2-14 ) that also may include increased numbers of lymphocytes or plasma cells. This type of inflammation is often associated with foreign body reactions, fungal infections, mycobacterial infections, panniculitis, lick granulomas, and other chronic tissue injuries. The term pyogranulomatous should be reserved for a population of neutrophils and epithelioid macrophages with or without multinucleate giant cells ( Fig. 2-13A) . Eosinophilic lesions contain greater than 10% eosinophils in addition to other inflammatory cell types ( Fig. 2-15 ). They are seen with or without mast cell involvement. It is not uncommon to see rust or brown granules in the cytoplasm of eosinophils on cytology in contrast to the pink red cell color. This inflammatory response is associated with eosinophilic granuloma, hypersensitivity or allergic conditions, parasitic migrations, fungal infections, mast cell tumors, and other neoplastic conditions that induce eosinophilopoiesis. This combination of eosinophilic inflammatory conditions has been referred to as \"worms, wheezes, and weird diseases. \"\n\nLymphocytic or plasmacytic infiltration is often associated with allergic or immune reactions, early viral infections, and chronic inflammation. The lymphoid population is heterogeneous, with small or intermediate-sized lymphocytes and plasma cells mixed with other inflammatory cells ( Fig. 2-14) . In contrast, a monomorphic population of lymphoid cells without other inflammatory cells present suggests lymphoid neoplasia.\n\nCytologic samples often contain evidence of tissue injury in addition to cyst formation, inflammation, or neoplasia. These changes include hemorrhage, proteinaceous debris, cholesterol or calcium crystals, necrosis, and fibrosis.\n\nHemorrhage that is pathologic can be distinguished from blood contamination encountered during the cytologic collection: Blood contamination is associated with the presence of numerous erythrocytes and platelets, whereas acute hemorrhage is associated with engulfment of erythrocytes by macrophages termed erythrophagocytosis (Fig. 2-16A ). Care must be taken to evaluate direct smears first prior to reporting the findings of processed materials. For example, the simple act of centrifugation to create a sediment smear from body fluids can activate macrophages to engulf nearby erythrocytes, which is not observed in the direct smear ( Fig. 2-16B ). Chronic hemorrhage is associated with active macrophages containing degraded blood pigment within their cytoplasm-for example, blue-green to black hemosiderin granules (Figs. 2-17 and 2-18) or yellow rhomboid hematoidin crystals (Fig. 2-18 ). Hemosiderin represents an Cat. Clinical presentation of a chronic cough in this cat with suspected pulmonary allergy. Fluid contains 95% eosinophils. Pictured are several eosinophils that stain pale pink to blue-green and adhere to pink mucous material that prevents full stain penetration. (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.) excess aggregation of ferritin molecules or micelles. This form of iron storage becomes visible by light microscopy and stains blue with the Prussian blue reaction. Hematoidin crystals do not contain iron and are often formed during anaerobic breakdown of hemoglobin such as may occur within tissues or cavities. Hematomas often contain phagocytized erythrocytes if the lesion is acute or hemosiderin-laden macrophages if the lesion is chronic.\n\nProteinaceous debris may be seen within the background of the preparation. Mucus stains lightly basophilic and appears amorphous ( Fig. 2-19 ). Lymphoglandular bodies are cytoplasmic fragments from fragile cells, usually lymphocytes, which are discrete, round, lightly basophilic structures (Flanders et al., 1993) . Nuclear streaming refers to linear pink to purple strands of nuclear remnants (Fig. 2-21 ) produced by excessive tissue handling during cytologic preparation or with necrotic material when sampled. Clear to light-pink amorphous strands representing collagen (Fig. 2-22A ) may be admixed with spindle cells and endothelium within a fibrovascular stroma. However, when these collagen fibers undergo damage (as in the collagenolysis associated with mast cell tumor), degranulating eosinophils release collagenase that produces dense, hyalinized pink collagen bands (Fig. 2-22B ). Amyloid is an uncommon pathologic protein found in tissues composed of several types between cells (Woldenmeskel, 2012). It appears amorphous, eosinophilic, and hyaline and may be associated with chronic inflammation, plasma cell tumors (see Fig. 3-54E&F) , or familial amyloidosis (Fig. 2-22C) .\n\nCholesterol crystals represent evidence of cell membrane damage with lipid degeneration that may be found in the background of some cytologic preparations. These rectangular, plated crystals are transparent unless background staining is enhanced-for example, with new methylene blue stain (Fig. 2-23) . The crystals are most often associated with epidermal/follicular cysts.\n\nNecrosis and fibrosis may occur together or separately in some cytologic preparations. The death of cells is represented by fuzzy, indistinct cell outlines and definition of cell type (Fig. 2-24A&B) . A reparative response accompanying tissue injury involves increased fibroblastic activity. It is common to see very reactive fibrocytes (Fig. 2-25A&B ) along with severe inflammation. One must be careful not to overinterpret this reactivity as a neoplastic condition because fibroblasts display anaplastic features such as open and ropy chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios (see Fig.  3 -10A) compared with mature fibrocytes. Mitosis may be evident with increased cell turnover under normal physiologic and reparative influences in addition to a neoplastic proliferation (Fig. 2-26A-I) . Normal appearing mitotic figures are common in hyperplastic lymph nodes and regenerative bone marrow. Differences between normal and abnormal mitotic figures was previously discussed (Tvedten, 2009 ).\n\nNeoplasia is initially diagnosed when a monomorphic or monotypic cell population is present and significant inflammation is lacking. Further division into benign and malignant types is based on cytomorphologic characteristics. Benign cells display uniformity in nuclear and cell size, nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and other nuclear features. Malignant cells often display three or more criteria (Table 2- diagnosis or severe inflammation, histopathologic examination is recommended.\n\nNeoplasms may be divided into four general categories to assist in making the cytologic interpretation by restricting the list of differential diagnoses (Perman et al., 1979; Alleman and Bain, 2000) . The categories listed in Table 2 -2 are NOT based on cell origin or function but rather on their general cytomorphologic characteristics that include their general association to one another (Table 2 -2). The first two terms, epithelial and mesenchymal, are taken from embryologic histology (Noden and de Lahunta, 1985) . High or variable nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio between cells of similar origin ( Fig. 2- \n\nVariation in nuclear size between cells of similar origin ( Fig. 2- \n\nRopy chromatin or clumping of nuclear chromatin is common in immature cells (Fig. 2-29 ) Nucleolar changes Variation in nucleolar size (anisonucleoliosis), enlarged, multiple, or variably shaped nucleoli ( Fig. 2-30 ) Nuclear molding Abnormal nuclear shape related to the rapid growth of cells in which tight cell spacing occurs without normal crowd inhibition (Fig. 2- \n\nTwo or more nuclei occupy the same cell. Binucleation may be found in hyperplasia of some tissues (Fig. 2- \n\nAbnormal chromosomal fragments may appear with uneven length of chromatin strands and as isolated or lag chromatin. Increased numbers may be suggestive but not definitive for malignancy ( Fig. 2- unevenly compared with normal divisions (Fig. 2-26) . Chromosomal fragments are dispersed irregularly with some isolated from the rest, termed lag chromatin. Increased mitotic activity may suggest malignancy, but abnormal division is more diagnostic for malignancy. (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.)\n\nEpithelial neoplasms often originate from glandular or parenchymal tissue and lining surfaces, and they are associated with a clustered arrangement of cells into ball shapes or monolayer sheets. Examples of epithelial neoplasms include lung adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2-34) , perianal adenoma (hepatoid tumor), basal cell tumor, sebaceous adenoma, transitional cell carcinoma (Fig. 2-35) , and mesothelioma. Specific cytologic features of epithelial neoplasms are listed in Box 2-2 ( Fig. 2-36 ).\n\nNeoplasms with a mesenchymal appearance resemble the embryonic connective tissue, mesenchyme. This tissue is loosely arranged with usually abundant extracellular matrix (Noden and de Lahunta, 1985) and individualized spindle, oval, or stellate cells (Bacha and Bacha, 2000) . Benign and malignant mesenchymal neoplasms often originate from connective tissue elements, such as fibroblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes, myocytes, and vascular lining cells. Examples of mesenchymal neoplasms include hemangiosarcoma (Fig. 2-37) , osteosarcoma (Fig. 2-38) , fibroma (see Fig. 3-39) , and amelanotic melanoma (Fig. 2-39) . Specific cytologic features of mesenchymal neoplasms are listed in Box 2-3.\n\nRound cell neoplasms have discrete, round cellular shapes and are associated with hematopoietic cells. Therefore, their nuclear size is roughly two to four times the diameter of an erythrocyte. The five categories of round cell neoplasms include transmissible venereal tumor (Fig. 2-40) , lymphoma (Fig. 2-41) , mast cell tumor (see Fig. 3-53D) , plasmacytoma (see Fig. 3-54A&B) , and histiocytic tumors (see Figs. 3-49C and 3-51A); these can be remembered by the acronym T-LyMPH. Specific cytologic characteristics of round cell neoplasms are listed in Box 2-4.\n\nNeoplasms with a naked nuclei cytomorphology have a loosely adherent cellular arrangement with free nuclei. This cytologic appearance is an artifact related to the fragile nature of these cells. These neoplasms are usually associated with endocrine, neuroendocrine, and neural tumors (Perman et al., 1979) . In addition, anal sac adenocarcinoma frequently displays this pattern when aspirated (see Fig. 3-36) . Typical examples include thyroid tumors (Fig. 2-42) , islet cell tumors, paragangliomas (Fig. 2-43) , and neuropil (see Fig. 14-37) . Specific cytologic features of naked nuclei neoplasms include those listed in Box 2-5. Round to oval nuclei, anisokaryosis, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, prominent and variably shaped nucleoli, and individualized cells with poorly distinct cytoplasmic borders suggest a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm. This lesion is from a gum mass with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma. One cell in the center contains small amounts of melanin pigment granules. (Aqueous Romanowsky; HP oil.)\n\n\u2022 Cells usually exfoliate individually (however, aggregates of cells are seen occasionally bound by an extracellular matrix) \u2022 Cells are oval, stellate, or fusiform with often indistinct cytoplasmic borders \u2022 Samples are often poorly cellular \u2022 Cells are usually smaller than epithelial cells \u2022 Nuclei are round to elliptical BOX 2-3 Cytologic Features of Mesenchymal Neoplasms n FIGURE 2-40 Round cell neoplasm. Tissue aspirate. Dog. Discrete cells with a round shape, distinct cytoplasmic borders, and a very high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio are characteristic of lymphoid cells. This sample is taken from a lymph node effaced by lymphoma cells. (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.) KEY POINT The use of these four cytomorphologic categories may help classify neoplastic lesions by their general cellular appearance and arrangement, thereby suggesting specific tumor types. Remember that these categories may not fit well for some neoplasms, especially for poorly differentiated tumors. It is recommended that biopsy specimens for histopathologic examination be taken to determine the specific tumor type and extent of the lesion under most circumstances.\n\nSometimes it is difficult to differentiate artifact from a pathologic/diagnostic finding. The following examples illustrate some of the more common materials or structures associated with cytologic specimens that may be puzzling or distracting. In some cases artifacts are induced by specimen processing (Fig. 2 -44A-C), rough handling ( Fig. 2-44D ), excess blood with formation of hemoglobin crystals (Fig. 2-44E-F) , presence of ultrasound gel (Fig. 2-44G ), precipitate formation from methanolic Romanowsky stain (Fig. 2-44H) , and talc or starch granules from surgical gloves (Fig. 2-44I ).\n\nBackground material often reflects degenerative changes such as dystrophic calcification (Fig. 2-45A ) or urate crystals in tissues (Fig. 2-45B) . When viewed against a proteinaceous background, crystals such as cholesterol crystal needles may be seen (Fig. 2-45C) . However, these fragments should not be confused with certain bacteria such as mycobacterial species that have thick outer lipid cell walls that do not take up stain well and appear as negative rods against a proteinaceous background (Fig. 2-45D ).\n\nLinear shapes can be confusing within samples. Although commonly associated with respiratory specimens, Curschmann spirals represent inspissated mucus and have been seen rarely Cervical mass in the area of the thyroid from an animal with a honking cough. Cytologically, the sample presents as a syncytium of round nuclei with relatively uniform features. This is characteristic of an endocrine mass. Typically the distinction between hyperplasia, adenoma, and carcinoma is difficult cytologically and sometimes histologically. (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.) n FIGURE 2-43 Naked nuclei neoplasm. Tissue imprint. Dog. Clinical signs include a head tilt and temporal muscle atrophy. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested a mass involving the osseous bulla. Surgery found a mass at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. Cytologically, the preparation contains mostly loose or free round nuclei against a finely granular eosinophilic background. While most nuclei are similarly sized, an occasional cell appears larger. Few intact cells remain with pale cytoplasm at the edges and center. Adjacent to the center intact cell is a nucleated red cell (arrow) suggestive of extramedullary hematopoiesis. The histologic diagnosis is paraganglioma, specifically a malignant chemodectoma in this case, because it metastasized and was thought to involve the chemoreceptor organ in that site. (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.)\n\n\u2022 Cells often exfoliate in loosely attached sheets with many free nuclei present and indistinct cytoplasmic borders \u2022 Occasional cell clusters may be present with distinct cell outlines \u2022 Cells are generally round to polygonal \u2022 Samples are highly cellular \u2022 Nuclei are round to indented, often with none to minimal anisokaryosis BOX 2-5 Specific Cytologic Features of Naked Nuclei Neoplasms in dermal lesions (Fig. 2-46A) . Capillaries lined by endothelium that occasionally contain erythrocytes are common with lymphoid organs and other highly vascularized tissues (Fig.  2-46B&C) . Organic or synthetic fibers may resemble hyphae or hair shafts but are usually distinguished by a refractile or colored feature (Fig. 2-46D ). In contrast, fungal hyphae may appear pigmented or nonpigmented (Fig. 2-46E ) with uniform width and sometimes distinctive septation or presence of a fruiting body (Fig. 2-46F ). Large deeply basophilic thick fibers may indicate skeletal muscle tissue (Fig. 2-46G) . Upon close inspection of the muscle tissue, one often observes surface nuclei along with cross-striations. Fig. 2-46H&I demonstrates the typical location and appearance of keratin bars, which is suggestive of fingerprints.\n\nThe background may contain regular or irregularly shaped materials that stain basophilic or green. Fig. 2-47A&B demonstrates the sulfur granular seen grossly in actinomycosis in which mats of bacterial filaments appear as amorphous junk-like material. Always examine this material and especially around the periphery to find the typical beaded filamentous bacteria. In addition to the yellow bile material found within the abdominal cavity upon rupture of the biliary ducts, amorphous mucus of various size and shape appears pale blue within cells or extracellularly ( Fig. 2-47C) . Plant pollen or spores that are green are often found within the respiratory tract or in areas with easy access to the environment. These should be considered contaminants under most circumstances (Fig. 2-47D) . "}
