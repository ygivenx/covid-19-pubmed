This novel coronavirus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and the pneumonia was designated as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 7 Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that lack the ability to correct errors occurring during RNA replication. This property results in high variability of CoVs and mutations that occur frequently and quickly under environmental and evolutionary stress. Therefore, RNA CoVs are highly prevalent and severe pathogens of viral diseases 12 . The genomic RNA of CoVs is approximately 30 k nt in length with a 5'-cap structure and 3'-poly-A tail, which has the largest viral RNA genome known to date and contains at least 6 open reading frames (ORFs).\n\nThere is an a-1 frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b which are the first ORF, about two-third of genome length, directly translating polyprotein (pp) 1a/1ab. These polyproteins will be processed by a 3C-like protease (3CL pro ), also named as the main protease (M pro ), and one or two papain-like proteases (PLPs) into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps). Subsequently, these nsps catalyze the synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic RNAs which are used as templates to directly translate main structural author/funder. All rights reserved.

Therefore, these proteases, especially 3CL pro , play a vital role in the life cycle of coronavirus 13, 14, 15, 16 .\n\n3CL pro (M pro ) is a three-domain (domains I to III) cysteine protease and involves in most maturation cleavage events within the precursor polyprotein. Active 3CL pro is a homodimer containing two protomers. The CoV 3CL pro features a non-canonical Cys...His dyad located in the cleft between domains I and II 17, 18, 19 . Several common features are shared among the substrates of CoVs 3CL pro , and especially a Gln residue is almost absolutely required for the substrate in the P1 position. 3CL pro is conserved within the group of CoVs. In addition, there is no human homologue of 3CL pro which makes it an ideal antiviral target 20, 21 .\n\nThe substrates of coronaviruses 3CL pro (M pro ) show some similarity, and most 3CL protease inhibitors are peptidomimetic covalent inhibitors derived from the natural substrates. The active sites are highly conserved among all CoV M pro and are usually composed of four pockets (S1', S1, S2 and S4) 22, 23 . The thiol of a cysteine residue in the S1' pocket can anchor inhibitors by a covalent linkage, which is important for the inhibitors to maintain anti-viral activity. In our design of new inhibitors, the aldehyde was selected as a new warhead in P1' to occupy the S1'pocket.\n\nAs the (S)-\u03b3-lactam ring has been proved to be suitable in the S1 pocket of 3C pro and 3CL pro , this ring was expected to be a good choice in P1 of new inhibitors. Furthermore, the S2 pocket of coronavirus 3CL pro is usually large enough to accommodate the bigger P2 fragment. To assess the possibility of \u03c0 -\u03c0 stacking interactions and hydrophobic interaction with the S2 pocket, the aryl and cyclohexyl group were placed in P2 (compounds 11a and 11b) . Finally, the indole or other heterocyclice groups, which are privileged skeletons, were introduced into P3 in order to form new hydrogen bonds with S4 and improve drug-like properties.\n\nSynthetic procedures: The synthetic route and chemical structures of the compounds (11a and 11b) are shown in Scheme 1.

The intermediates 6a and 6b were synthesized from 4 and acid 5a, 5b. After the t-butoxycarbonyl group was removed from 6a and 6b, the intermediates 7a and 7b were obtained. Coupling compounds 7a and 7b with the acid 8 yielded the esters 9a, 9b. The peptidomimetic aldehydes 11a and 11b were approached via a two-step route in which the ester derivatives 9 were first reduced with NaBH 4 to generate the primary alcohols 10a and 10b, which were subsequently oxidized into aldehydes 11a and 11b with Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP). \n\nRecombinant SARS-CoV-2 M pro (3CL pro ) was expressed and purified from \n\nIn order to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 M pro by 11a, we determined the high-resolution crystal structure of this complex at 1.5-\u00c5 resolution (Table S1 ) 18, 26, 27 .

By a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis, two molecules (designated protomer A and protomer B) associate into a homodimer (Figure S2) . The structure of each protomer contains three domains and the substrate-binding site is located in the cleft between domain I and II (Figure S2) .\n\nAt the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M pro , Cys145 and His41 (Cys-His) form a catalytic dyad ( Figure S2) .\n\nThe electron density map clearly showed the compound 11a in the substrate binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M pro in an extended conformation (Figure 2A The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.996348 doi: bioRxiv preprint 11a at P2 enters deep into the S2 site, stacking to the imidazole ring of His41 ( Figure   2B ). The cyclohexyl group is also surrounded by the side chains of Met49, Tyr54, Met165 and Asp187, producing extensive hydrophobic interactions (Figure 2B) . The indole group of 11a at P3 is exposed to solvent (S4 site) and is stabilized by Glu166 through a hydrogen bond (Figure 2B) . The side chains of residues Pro168 and Gln189 interact with the indole group of 11a through hydrophobic interactions.\n\nInterestingly, multiple water molecules (named W1-W6) play an important role in binding 11a (Figure 2B ). W1 interacts with the amide bonds of 11a through a hydrogen bond, whereas W2-6 form a number of hydrogen bonds with the aldehyde group of 11a and the residues of Asn142, Gly143, Thr26, Thr25, His41 and Cys44, which contributes to stabilize 11a in the binding pocket ( Figure 2B ). author/funder.

The difference in binding is probably due to the aryl group of 11b at P2. Compared with the cyclohexyl group in 11a, the aryl group undergoes a significant rotation (Figure 2C) . The side chains of residues His41, Met49, Met165 and Val186 interact with this aryl group through hydrophobic interactions ( Figure   2D ). The side chain of Gln189 stabilizes the aryl group with an additional hydrogen bond ( Figure 2D ). In short, these two crystal structures reveal an identical inhibitory mechanism in that these two compounds occupy the substrate-binding pocket, mimicking the intermediates in the catalytic reaction, which blocks the enzyme activity of SARS-CoV-2 M pro .\n\nTo further substantiate the enzyme inhibition results, we evaluated the ability of \n\nTo explore the further druggability of the compounds 11a and 11b, both of two compounds were evaluated for its pharmacokinetic properties. As shown in Table S2 , compound 11a given intraperitoneally (5mg/kg) and intravenous (5mg/kg) displayed a long half-life (T 1/2 ) of 4.27 h and 4.41h, a high maximal concentration (C max =2394 author/funder.

Metabolic stability of 13a in mice was also good (CL = 17.4 mL/min/mg). When administered intraperitoneal (20mg/kg), subcutaneous (5mg/kg) and intravenous (5mg/kg), compound 11b also showed good PK properties. Considering the danger of COVID-19, we selected the intravenous drip administration to further study. Compared with 11a administrated via intravenous, the half-life (1.65h) of 11b is shorter and the clearance rate is faster (CL = 20.6 mL/min/mg). Compound 11a was selected for further investigation with intravenous drip dosing on rats and dogs. The results showed ( Table S3 ) that 11a exhibited long T 1/2 (rat, 7.6 h and dog, 5.5h), low clearance rate (rat, 4.01 mL/min/kg and dogs, 5.8 mL/min/kg) and high AUC value (rat, 41500 h*ng/mL and dog, 14900 h*ng/mL)).\n\nThose results indicating that compound 11a has good PK properties to warrant further study.\n\nThe in vivo toxicity study (Table S4 ) of 11a have been carried out on SD rats and Beagle dogs. The acute toxicity of 11a was conducted on SD rats, and no SD rats died after receiving 40 mg/kg via intravenous drip administration. When the dosage was raised to 60 mg/kg, one of four SD rats was died. The dose range toxicity study of 11a was conducted for seven days in the dosing level at 2, 6, 18 mg/kg on SD rats and at 10-40 mg/kg on Beagle dogs, once daily dosing (QD), by intravenous drip, all animals were clinically observed once a day at least and no obvious toxicity was observed in each group. The results show 11a with low toxicity on rats and dogs. Discussion author/funder. All rights reserved.
