{"title": "Comparison of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Viruses from Germany and the United States, 2014", "body": "In May 2014, a pig fattening farm in southern Germany (Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg) that continuously houses \u22481,400 fattening pigs reported watery diarrhea in pigs in all age groups (feeders to slaughter animals). The first cases occurred after new feeder pigs from a large piglet producer were brought onto the farm. The incoming animals showed diarrhea 2 days after arrival. Within 1 day thereafter, the disease had spread to pigs in all other age groups. Clinical signs were present for at least 1 week; \u224820 pigs died. Fecal samples from diseased pigs were submitted to the regional laboratory for diagnosis, and coronaviruses were detected by electron microscopy (Figure 1). Additionally, 3 pigs with catarrhal enteritis were euthanized; postmortem examination at the regional laboratory confirmed coronavirus infection in all 3 animals. \n\nSubsequently, PED was diagnosed in a private laboratory (IVD GmbH, Hannover, Germany) by use of a published multiplex reverse transcription quantitative PCR (7). Selected positive samples were submitted to the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Isle of Riems, Germany, for confirmation and further virus characterization. At this institution, 2 fecal samples with high genome load, as determined by 2 independent, published (8,9) reverse transcription quantitative PCRs selective for PEDV nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes, were chosen for routine virologic testing and next-generation sequencing. Sequencing and data analyses were performed as previously described (10). The phylogenetic tree, based on full-length genomes, was constructed by using PhyML (11) in the Geneious software suite (http://www.geneious.com/) with a generalized time reversible substitution model, and the tree was supported by 1,000 bootstrapping replicates.\n\nVirus isolates were obtained after inoculation of cells of different permanent cell lines (pig kidney [PK]-15 and Vero) with clinical material from the pigs. Sequencing of nucleic acids isolated directly from diagnostic samples PEDV/GER/L00719/2014 and PEDV/GER/L00721/2014 resulted in 2 viral genomes (Table) encompassing all typical PEDV coding sequences. Each sequence encodes a large replicase polyprotein, a spike (S) protein, an alphacoronavirus-specific accessory membrane protein, an envelope protein, a membrane protein, and a nucleocapsid (N) protein.\n\nComparative analyses of the full genomes showed that the strains share a very high (99.5%) identity with the new variant OH851 (GenBank accession no. KJ399978) recently reported from the United States (6). A more comprehensive comparison of 21 full-length PEDV genomes from different years and locations revealed lower similarities (\u224898.7%) with currently circulating highly virulent strains from the United States and from China (Technical Appendix Figure, panel A). In contrast, the new isolates from Germany, PEDV/GER/L00719/2014 and PEDV/GER/L00721/2014, are less similar (97.1%) to the isolate from Europe, CV777, which dates back to the 1970s (12).\n\nThe nucleotide alignment of the obtained PEDV genomes and the available references from the database revealed a region with high variability of the first 1,200 nt in the 5\u2032 portion of the S protein\u2013coding sequences (Technical Appendix Figure, panel B). The N terminal S1 domain of the coronavirus S protein is necessary for virus attachment by interaction with host cell receptors (13) and might therefore be highly mutable.\n\nAlthough in-depth analysis of the deep-sequencing data for PEDV/GER/L00721/2014 revealed a genetically homogenous population, this analysis for PEDV/GER/L00719/2014 uncovered a mixed viral population with a total of 8 single-nucleotide variants. One nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variant (variant position G19042U, amino acid substitution S6348I) was detected in the polyprotein coding sequences. Of note, 7 single-nucleotide variants are located in the aforementioned variable region in the S protein coding sequences, 5 of which are nonsynonymous (Table), thereby confirming the high variability in the N terminal part of the S protein.\n\nBecause quite extensive differences (\u224850 aa) were found between the recent N terminal S protein region of the isolates from Germany and the highly virulent PEDV strains from the United States and China, the isolates from Germany described in this article seem to not be directly linked to the highly virulent PEDV strains circulating in the United States (Figure 2). In contrast, the recent isolates from Germany and strain OH851 share not only high identity over the entire genome, including the highly variable 5\u2032 region of the S protein coding sequences, but also their clinical phenotype observed under field conditions.\n\nPEDV infection was confirmed in a pig herd in Germany in 2014. Comparative analyses of full-length sequences revealed that the isolates from these pigs in Germany show very high nucleotide similarity with strain OH851 found in the United States in 2014. However, differences exist that distinguish the strains from Germany from the highly virulent PEDV strains that caused the major losses in the United States. Given the fact that PEDV surveillance has been lacking in Germany, we cannot exclude the possibility that the strains described here have already been circulating in Europe for a longer time or were indeed recently introduced from the United States or Asia to Europe. Therefore, our report provides useful information about recent PEDV strains in Europe, but a comprehensive evaluation is still difficult because of a lack of data about additional strains. Future studies should therefore concentrate on analysis of additional PEDV from different years and locations."}
