{"title": "An Overview of\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u2013Coronavirus\n(SARS-CoV) 3CL Protease Inhibitors: Peptidomimetics and Small Molecule\nChemotherapy", "body": "Coronaviruses\nhave been known for more than five decades since\nthe first prototype murine strain, JHM, was reported in 1947.1,2 Viruses such as porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV),\navian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and bovine coronavirus (BCoV)\nseverely infect animals. The murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus\n(MHV) was studied as a model for the human disease. Although studies\nof the mechanism of replication as well as the pathogenesis of several\ncoronaviruses have been very active since 1970s, this family of coronaviruses\nreceived much attention when it was recognized that a new human coronavirus\nwas responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a contagious\nand fatal illness.3,4\n\nCoronaviruses belong to\none of two subfamilies of (Coronavirinae and Torovirinae) of the family Coronaviridae, which in turn comprise the order Nidovirales (Figure 1).5,6 They\nare classified into four genera (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4),\nand each genus can be further divided into lineage subgroups. SARS-CoV\nbelongs to the Betacoronavirus group (see Figure 1).\n\nIn 2003, a new human coronavirus\nwas identified as an etiological\nagent of the first global pandemic of the 21st century, severe-acute\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS), and the virus was named SARS-CoV. The\nfirst case of \u201can atypical pneumonia\u201d was reported in\nChina during November 2002.7 Its rapid\nand unexpected spread to another 29 countries, mostly in Asia and\nNorth America, alarmed both the public and World Health Organization\n(WHO). Within a few months of this outbreak in 2003, the WHO announced\nin a cumulative report about its emergence that it had caused 916\ndeaths among 8422 cases (fatality rate of 10\u201315%) worldwide,\nas shown in Table 1.8 This incidence indicates how rapidly\na contagious illness can spread in this highly interconnected society.\n\nSARS is\nmainly characterized by a high fever (>38 \u00b0C), dyspnea,\nlymphopenia, headache, and lower respiratory tract infections;9,10 concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhea are also common.11\u221213 With the enormous efforts of the WHO and expert scientists from\nvarious countries, a novel human coronavirus was identified as the\netiological agent for SARS.4,14 The sequence information\non the coronavirus polymerase gene, along with all other previously\ncharacterized strains, demonstrated that this was a previously unrecognized\ncoronavirus in humans.3,15\u221217 Although the\nSARS epidemic was successfully controlled in 2003,18,19 the identification of animal reservoirs for this virus and the recent\nreport of a new virus related to SARS, called Middle East respiratory\nsyndrome (MERS),20 provide strong motivation\nfor the development of anti-SARS agents to treat this potentially\nfatal respiratory illness.\n\nThe recent outbreak of MERS in South\nKorea alarmed the public,\nand the number of patients under quarantine was reported to be 1600.21 After the first patient was diagnosed with MERS\non May 20, 2015, within a period of two months, the total number of\ncases identified had increased to 186 with 36 fatalities and possible\ninfection of 16700 individuals who were subjected to isolation.22,23 By the end of August 2015, a total of 1511 patients were infected\nworldwide with this virus, of which 574 (\u223c39%) had died after\nthe first case was recorded in June 2012 in Saudi Arabia.24\n\nTo date, the FDA has not approved an antiviral\nagent for the treatment\nof SARS, although the clinical treatments are directed toward symptomatic\nrelief. Therefore, the development of effective antiviral chemotherapy\nagainst SARS-CoV is important for future outbreaks. Numerous reports\n(over 3500 publications) have been published on SARS-CoV since 2002.\nRecently, a brief review on the progress of anti-SARS chemotherapy\nwas reported.25 However; no reports have\nbeen published about the substrate selectivity, mechanism of action,\nand SARs of the inhibitors. Therefore, to overcome the drawbacks and\nto enhance the qualitative understanding of the etiology, pathology,\nand possible therapeutic targets against this virus, a comprehensive\nreview is currently needed.\n\nThis perspective focuses on the\nstatus of SARS-CoV 3 chymotrypsin-like\nprotease (3CLpro) inhibitors discovered during last 12\nyears from all sources, including laboratory synthetic methods, natural\nproducts, virtual screening, and structure-based molecular docking\nstudies. Attempts have been made to provide a complete description\nof the structural features (SARs) and detailed mechanisms of action\nof inhibitors. We believe that this perspective will comprise a cumulative\nsource of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors for researchers and\nfurther the understanding of anti-SARS chemotherapy.\n\nCoronaviruses are a family of positive strand,\nenveloped RNA viruses\nthat can cause acute and chronic respiratory, enteric, and central\nnervous system diseases in many species of animals, including humans.26,27 This family features the largest viral genomes (27\u201331 kb)\nfound to date.28,29 The genomic RNA is complexed\nwith the basic nucleocapsid (N) protein to form a helical capsid within\nthe membrane. The membrane of all coronaviruses is comprised of a\nminimum of three viral proteins: (i) a spike protein (S), a type of\nglycoprotein I, (ii) a membrane protein (M) that spans the membrane,\nand (iii) an envelope protein (E), a highly hydrophobic protein that\ncovers the entire structure of the coronavirus (Figure 2).30 The SARS-CoV\ngenome contains two open reading frames, connected by a ribosomal\nframe shift, which encode two large overlapping replicase polyproteins,\npp1a (\u223c450 kDa) and pp1ab (\u223c750 kDa), from which the\nfunctional proteins are produced by an extensive proteolytic process.31,32 While other coronaviruses utilize three proteases for proteolytic\nprocessing, the SARS-CoV is known to encode only two proteases, which\ninclude a papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro)33 and a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease known\nas 3C-like protease (3CLpro).34\u221239 The 3CLpro enzyme, also called Main protease (Mpro), is indispensable to the viral replication and infection process,\nthereby making it an ideal target for antiviral therapy.\n\nThe X-ray crystallographic structure of hexapeptidyl\nchlromethyl\nketone (CMK) inhibitor bound to 3CLpro at different pH\nvalues was solved by Yang et al. in 2003 (see Figure 3).38 It was explained\nthat SARS-CoV 3CLpro forms as a dimer with the two promoters\n(denoted as \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d) oriented almost\nat right angles to each other (Figure 3A,B). The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro, similar those of other 3CLpro, comprises three\ndomains. Domains I (residues 8\u2013101) and II (residues 102\u2013184)\ncontain \u03b2-barrels that form the chymotrypsin structure, whereas\ndomain III (residues 201\u2013306) consists mainly of \u03b1-helices\n(Figure 3).38\u221240 SARS-CoV 3CLpro has a Cys-His catalytic dyad, and the\nsubstrate or inhibitor binding site is located in a cleft between\ndomain I and II. The substrate-binding subsite S1 specificity in protomer\nA of a CoV protease confers absolute specificity for the P1-Gln substrate\nresidue on the enzyme. Each N-terminus residue (N-finger) squeezed between domains II and III of the parent\nmonomer and domain II of the other monomer, plays an important role\nin dimerization and formation of the active site of 3CLpro. The SARS-CoV 3CLpro dimer is highly active, while the\nmonomer is principally inactive.41\n\nIn 2004,\nKua et al. reported the first preparation of the fully\nactive dimeric SARS-CoV 3CLpro with the authentic sequence.42 To screen for inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, they prepared a peptide substrate with a fluorescence\nquenching pair 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (Dabcyl) and\n5-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (Edans) at the N- and C-termini, respectively, which resulted\nextremely sensitive assay and allowed many potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV\n3CLpro to be identified.\n\n3CLpro are cysteine\nproteases, which are analogues to\nthe main picornavirus 3C protease, a family of viruses that also cause\nrespiratory illness. The conservation of specificities within the\n3CLpro family of coronaviruses has been reported with the\namino acid sequence Leu-Gln-Ser or Leu-Gly-Ala as the preferred P2\u2013P1\u2013P1\u2032\nsequence (Table 2).1 Although the functional similarities of 3CLpro have \u201ccleavage site-specificity\u201d to that\nof picornavirus 3C proteases, the structural similarities between\nthe two families are limited.43 The SARS-CoV\n3CLpro cleaves polyproteins at no less than 11 conserved\nsites involving the Leu-Gln\u2193(Ser, Ala, Gly) sequence, which\nappears to be a conserved pattern of the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV.3,37 The active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro contains Cys145 and\nHis41, creating a catalytic dyad in which the cysteine functions as\na common nucleophile in the proteolytic process (Figure 4).39,43,44\n\nThe initial step in the process is deprotonation of Cys-thiol\n(I)\nand followed by nucleophilic attack of resulting anionic sulfur on\nthe substrate carbonyl carbon(II). In this step, a peptide product\nis released that has an amine terminus, while histidine is restored\nits deprotonated form (III). In the next step, the resulting thioester\nis hydrolyzed (IV) to release a carboxylic acid, and the free enzyme\n(V) is regenerated in the final step. Therefore, the functional significance\nof 3CLpro in the viral life cycle makes this protease an\nideal target for the development of drugs against SARS and other coronavirus\ninfections.\n\nIn 2003, the first X-ray structure of the SARS-3CLpro dimer with a peptidic CMK (1; Cbz-Val-Asn-Ser-Thr-Leu-Gln-CMK,\nsee Figure 5) inhibitor\nwas elucidated (Yang, H. et al.).38 The\nunexpected binding mode of the substrate\u2013analogue 1 provides a structural explanation for the P1-Gln entering into the\nspecific pocket and for the decreased P2-Leu specificity of the SARS\nenzyme. However, specificities for P2-Leu and P4-Ser have been observed\nin the structure of 1 bound to TGEV 3CLpro,43 whereas P3-Thr is orientated toward\nbulk solvents. In addition, compound 2 or rupintrivir\n(AG7088)43 shown in Figure 5 has already been clinically tested for common\ncold (targeting rhinovirus 3C protease) binds to human rhinovirus\n3C protease in the same orientation as that observed for the CMK inhibitor\nof TGEV. The X-ray crystal structure of 1 with TGEV 3CLpro and superimposed 2 (AG7088) with HRV2 3Cpro is depicted in Figure 6.\n\nBecause the substrate specificity\nof picornavirus 3Cpro for the P1\u2013P1\u2032 and\nP4 sites is very similar to that\nof coronavirus 3CLpro, compounds 1 and 2 have been proposed as a starting point in the development\nof new SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors (Figure 5).45\u221248 In addition, the HIV-1 protease inhibitor 3 (Figure 5)46,49 was found to have high binding affinity toward SARS-CoV 3CLpro as well. Using the above three molecules as peptidomimetics,\nmany medicinal chemistry studies have been focused on developing a\npotent chemotherapy method for SARS.\n\nDrugs designed to treat\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro can be broadly\nclassified into two types: (i) peptidic inhibitors, which mimic natural\npeptide substrates, and (ii) small molecule-based inhibitors, obtained\nfrom modifications of existing protease inhibitors, virtual screening,\nstructure-based molecular docking studies, and natural products. Additionally,\nmetal-conjugated inhibitors as well as some miscellaneous SARS-CoV\n3CLpro inhibitors are also discussed in this perspective.\n\nPeptidyl\nor peptidomimetic derivatives contain Michael acceptors\nas warheads and are an important class of cysteine protease inhibitors.\nIn general, inhibitor design strategies involve the replacement of\na substrate\u2019s scissile amide bond with an appropriate Michael\nacceptor group. The inactivation of a cysteine protease by a Michael\nacceptor group is depicted in Figure 7. The cysteine residue undergoes 1,4-addition to the\ninhibitor at the Michael acceptor warhead group, and the subsequent\nprotonation of the \u03b1-carbanion results in the irreversible inhibition\nof the enzyme.\n\nThe SAR study of compound 2 indicated\nthat the inhibitory activity was improved by replacing the following\nside chain residues: the P1-lactam with a phenyl group (4) and the P2-fluorobenzyl with a benzyl group (5), as\nshown in Figure 8.50 It was noted that compound 5 had\ntwo P1 and P2-phenylalanine groups and could fit in the S2 and S3\npockets of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, respectively. In addition,\nthe isoxazole moiety of these analogues adopted a conformation different\nfrom that of inhibitor 2 and thus undergoes hydrogen\nbonding with Gln192 in the S4 pocket. However, the conjugated ester\nwas not accessible (>4.5 \u00c5) to Cys145 to allow a Michael addition\nfor covalent bond (C\u2013S bond) formation. Consequently, this\nprocess was achieved by a subsequent strategy using pseudo-C2 symmetric analogues (6\u20139, Figure 8),50 thus exhibiting good inhibitory activity against\n3CLpro. In particular, a compound comprised of Phe\u2013Phe\ndipeptide unsaturated ester and 4-(dimethylaminocinnamic acid) (8) exhibited potent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of approximately 1.0 \u03bcM and a Ki value of 0.52 \u03bcM. The cell-based bioassay gave an EC50 = 0.18 \u03bcM. The presence of a 4-dimethylamino moiety\non the phenyl ring of these cinnamic analogues was found to be an\nimportant structural functionality for activity enhancement.\n\nAnother series of compounds were\nreported based on the modification\nof compound 2 at the P2 side chain by converting the p-fluorobenzyl group to a smaller benzyl (10) or prenyl group (11).51 These inhibitors (10 and 11) possess P1/P1\u2032-Michael\nacceptor groups, which can covalently link to the Cys145 (Figure 8). The resulting\nanalogues are not only potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Kinact values) but are effective in\nSARS-CoV cell-based bioassays. No toxicity was observed up to 100\n\u03bcM. In addition, it was observed that compound 12, which contains a hydroxyethylene isostere (12) in\nplace of the ketoethylene of compound 10, was inactive\ndue to the loss of an important hydrogen bond interaction between\nthe backbone amide nitrogen of Glu166 and the carbonyl oxygen of the\ninhibitor (Figure 8).51 Further replacement of the P4-isoxazole\nunit with a Boc-serine and a P2-benzyl, prenyl, or isobutyl (13\u201315: Figure 7)52 increased\nthe inhibitory activity against 3CLpro to several times\nof that of the lead inhibitor (2) (IC50 =\n800 \u03bcM), which confirmed both the P4-Boc-serine and P2-isopropyl\ngroups as important structural requirements for greater potency.\n\nAlthough the activity of the potent analogue 13 was\nimproved to several times that of compound 2 against\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro, substrate specificity for each site in\n3CLpro could not be identified because the inhibitory activity\nwas absolutely dependent on the other residues in these peptides.\nTherefore, the backbone structure of compound 2 was modified\nin a systematic manner as reported by Yang, S. et al.53 As a result, a five-member lactam ring was found to be\nmore specific for the P1-site, and leucine was used at the P2-site,\nwhich showed much better enzyme activity (>15-fold) than the other\nresidues (Table 3).\nThe strong binding of the five-member ring was evidenced by multiple\nhydrogen-bonds in the X-ray crystal structure (PDB ID 2GX4).53 For the P2-site, replacement of phenylalanine or 4-fluorophenylalanine\nwith a leucine group increased the inhibitory activity of the enzyme\nby 4-fold. This result indicated that the rigid and planar phenyl\nring is not favorable for binding to the S2 hydrophobic pocket (16 and 17). A lipophilic tert-butyl group at the P3 site further enhances the binding affinity\nmore than 10-fold (17 and 18). Furthermore,\nthe benzyloxy group was found to be the best replacement moiety for\nP4-methylisoxazole, resulting in a more than 4-fold increment in enzyme\ninhibitory activity (2 and 16); this group\nwas found to be the best group for this site. On the basis of the\ndocking study, this benzyloxy group has also been observed in a unique\nconformation in the X-ray crystal structure (docking study of 18 with PDB ID 2GX4; see Supporting Information (SI), Figure S1).53\n\nA novel\nseries of keto-glutamine analogues (19\u201326) with a phthalhydrazido group at the \u03b1-position were reported\nas reversible inhibitors against SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Figure 9).54 This discovery originated due to their inhibitory activity\nagainst the human hepatitis A virus 3C protease.55,56 These compounds feature \u03b2 and \u03b2\u2032 functionalities\nadjacent to the keto group as well as intramolecular hydrogen bonding\nto the carbonyl, which makes them more electrophilic and susceptible\nto hemithioacetal formation with Cys145 in the active site of the\nprotease. Compound 25 was recognized as the most potent\nanalogue with an inhibitory value (IC50) of 0.65 \u03bcM.\nSAR studies indicated that both \u03b3-lactam and phthalhydrazide\nmoieties are very important for good inhibition. Specifically, the\nintroduction of the \u03b3-lactam into the inhibitor containing a\nphthalhydrazide moiety greatly enhanced the inhibitory activity against\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro (compare inhibitors 19\u201322 vs 23\u201326). This was further\nsupported by molecular modeling studies of the active inhibitors (24\u201326), which show binding via an extended\n\u03b2-sheet interaction with residues 163\u2013166 of the 3CLpro and formation of hydrogen bonds between the His163 and\nthe P1 side chain.\n\nA recent report disclosed the\nX-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV\n3CLpro complexed with one of the phthalhydrazide (19)-based peptide inhibitors (Figure 10, PDB ID 2Z3C).57 The inhibitor\nforms an unusual thiiranium ring with the nucleophilic sulfur atom\nof Cys145, trapping the enzyme\u2019s catalytic residues in configurations\nsimilar to the intermediate states proposed to exist during the hydrolysis\nof the native substrate.57 Additionally,\nthe data suggest that this structure resembles the proposed tetrahedral\nintermediate during the deacylation step of normal peptide hydrolysis\ncleavage.57 Furthermore, to prove the importance\nof P1-lactam and phthalhydrazide units in inhibitor 23, a series of analogues modified from P1-lactam to P1-phenyalanine\n(27) or from phthalhydrazide to thiophene (28) were reported to have only weak activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro.54\n\nA diverse\nseries of peptide anilides (29\u201335) were reported based on niclosamide (Figure 11).58 Unlike typical\nnitroanilide-based peptides, which are readily hydrolyzed by serine\nand cysteine protease,59 these peptides\nwere not efficiently cleaved by SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Niclosamide\nshowed no inhibitory activity at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM. The\nmost potent inhibitor (29) is an anilide derived from\n2-chloro-4-nitro aniline, l-phenylalanine, and 4-(dimethylamino)benzoic\nacid. This anilide is a competitive inhibitor of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro with a Ki value of 0.03 \u03bcM\nand showed high selectivity toward SARS-CoV 3CLpro (IC50 = 0.06 \u03bcM) rather than other proteases such as trypsin\n(IC50 = 110 \u03bcM), chymotrypsin (IC50 =\n200 \u03bcM), and papain (IC50 = 220 \u03bcM). Because\nof the chlorine atom at the o-position, the 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl\nring and amido group cannot be in a coplanar conformation, thus making\nhydrolysis unfavorable.\n\nModification of compound 29 to a series of analogues\nresulted in reduced potency (30\u201335).58 A docking study (Figure 12, PDB ID 1UK4) showed that the\n2-chloro-4-nitroanilide unit of compound 29 occupies\nthe second preferred pocket. Thus, the nitro group was predicted to\nbe hydrogen bonded with Ala46 and His41, providing a possible key\ninteraction with the catalytic dyad. The (dimethylamino)phenyl group\nfit into the cleft formed by Gln189\u2013Gln192 and Met165\u2013Pro68.58 A docking study also suggested that anilide 29 has the lowest binding energy (\u22129.1 kcal/mol) compared\nto the other derivatives. This experiment supports the observations\nof the enzymatic assay, which revealed the important roles of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline\nand 4-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid residues in effective inhibition.58\n\nIt has been reported that some novel\nclasses of aza-peptide epoxides\n(APEs) act as inhibitors for clan CD cysteine peptidase.60,61 In the compound library screening, compound 36 (Figure 11) showed prominent\nactivity with irreversible inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Kinact/Ki = 1900 (\u00b1400) M\u20131 s\u20131).62 From the kinetic data and crystal structure\nof APEs reported by Lee T-W. et al., the 3CLpro reacts\nonly with the S,S-diastereomer and\nnot its R,R-diastereomer. In addition,\nthe epoxide C3 atom of APE must be in the S-configuration.\n\nA comprehensive screening of various peptides with electrophilic\nbuilding block-attached groups (e.g., epoxides and aziridines) identified\npotential 3CLpro inhibitors. The data revealed that the\naziridine- and oxirane-2-carboxylates are important for the inhibition\nof 3CLpro. A trans-configured compound containing Gly-Gly-aziridine\npeptide 37 (54% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM) was selected\nas a modest active-site directed irreversible SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor (Figure 11).63 This study also revealed that epoxide\nor aziridine building blocks alone, which do not contain an amino\nacid moiety, are not active.\n\nA series of peptide\naldehyde libraries were designed to target the SARS coronavirus, based\non the irreversible inhibitor CMK, and were shown to possess very\nweak inhibitory activity against SARS protease (IC50 >\n500 \u03bcM).64 The inhibitor CMK binds\nin a canonical mode to TGEV 3CLpro and resulted in a binding\nmode with P2, P4, and P5 addressing the respective S pockets, while\nP3 and P6 were exposed to the solvent (Figure 13A). However, in monomer A SARS-CoV 3CLpro, the CMK inhibitor follows a different side chain orientation\n(noncannonical binding mode): P2, P4, and P6 residues were not positioned\nto the respective pockets of the enzyme but remain solvent exposed.\nInstead, P3-threonine associates with the S2 pocket, and the S4 pocket\nis occupied by P5-aspargine (Figure 13B).\n\nOn the basis of these structural\nfindings, it was observed that\nthe sequential variations at the P sites of this initial structure\nproduced potent inhibitors, especially after modifications of the\nP2 and P5 sites, whereas mutations of the P1 and P3 sites yielded\nonly moderately improved inhibitors. Peptides 38 (AcNSTSQ-H)\nand 39 (AcESTLQ-H) were found to be more potent, with\nthe best reversible inhibitors having IC50 values in the\nlow micromolar range (7.5 \u03bcM) (Figure 13C). Interestingly, these inhibitors are\nassumed to bind in a noncanonical mode similar to that of CMK with\nTGEV 3CLpro (Figure 13B). In addition, the SAR suggested that the substrate\nspecificity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro requires glutamine in the\nP1 position and a large hydrophobic residue in the P2 position. Moreover,\nX-ray crystal structures of some pentapeptide aldehydes Ac-ESTLQ-H\n(40, PDB ID 3SNE), Ac-NSFSQ-H (41, PDB ID 3SNA), Ac-DSFDQ-H (42, PDB ID 3SNB), and Ac-NSTSQ-H (43, PDB ID 3SNC), complexed with\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro, revealed that the S2 pocket of the enzyme\ncan accommodate serine and even an aspartic acid side chain in the\nP2 position (see SI, Figure S2).65 However, the cleavage efficiency of serine in\nthe P2-position was 160 times lower than the original substrate (P2-Leu),\nand with aspartic acid, cleavage was not observed at all. Furthermore,\nthe same research group also determined the X-ray crystal structure\nof SARS-CoV 3CLpro in complex with Cm-FF-H (44, Ki = 2.24 \u03bcM, see Figure 14A). From the complex structure\n(see SI, Figure S3, PDB ID 3SN8), compound 44 had a P1-phenylalanine residue located in the hydrophilic\nS1 subsite resulted in hydrophobic interactions with Phe140, Leu141,\nAsn142, and the P3-cinnamoyl group of Cm-FF-H. This result suggests\nthat the stringent specificity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro with\nrespect to the P1 and P2 positions can be overcome by the highly electrophilic\ncharacter of the aldehyde warhead.\n\nA novel potent SARS-CoV 3CLpro peptide\u2013aldehyde\ninhibitor (45: Ki = 53 nM)\nwas developed as an antiviral agent against SARS-CoV and human coronavirus\nHCoV 229E replication, which reduced the viral titer by 4.7 log (at\n5 \u03bcM) for SARS-CoV and 5.2 log (at 1.25 \u03bcM) for HCoV 229E\n(Figure 14A).53 This inhibitor has distinct functional groups\nat the P1 to P4 sites compared to those of reference compound 2. This inhibitor was designed to evaluate the issues of cell\nviability, stability, and drug-like properties based on compound 18. Accordingly, the leucine moiety was replaced with a bulky\ncyclohexylalanine to improve the cell activity, and the ester group\nwas replaced with an aldehyde to avoid hydrolysis by esterase. As\na result, compound 45 (TG-0205221)53 displayed a very stable profile in mouse, rat, and human\nplasma (Table 4). The\nX-ray crystal structure of 45 (PDB ID 2GX4) revealed a unique\nbinding mode comprising a covalent bond, hydrogen bonds, and numerous\nhydrophobic interactions (see SI, Figure S4).53\n\nIn the course of\nstudies on the SARS-CoV 3CLpro and\nits inhibitors,66 it was found that the\nmature SARS-CoV 3CLpro is very sensitive to degradation\nat the Arg188/Gln189 site, which causes a loss of catalytic activity.\nThe stability of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro is dramatically increased\nby mutating the Arg at position 188 to Ile. The enzymatic efficiency\nof the R188I mutant was increased by a factor of more than 1 \u00d7\n106. The potency of the mutant protease makes it possible\nto quantitatively evaluate substrate-based peptide\u2013aldehyde\ninhibitors using conventional high-performance liquid chromatography\n(HPLC). A P-site pentapeptide sequence, Ac-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-NHCH-(CH2CH2CON(CH3)2)-CHO (46: Figure 14B), inhibits the catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro with an IC50 value of 37 \u03bcM. The side chain structures,\nespecially at sites P1, P2, and P4, were then optimized step by step\nbased on X-ray crystallographic analyses of the inhibitor\u2013protease\ncomplex to provide potent tetra peptide aldehyde inhibitors (47 and 48) (Figure 14B).67\n\nA new series of N,N\u2032-dimethyl glutaminyl (49\u201353) or aspartic acid (54) inhibitors with fluoromethyl\na ketone warhead were reported as SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors\n(Table 5).68 These inhibitors were designed based on their\ncaspase inhibitory activities.69,70 Antiviral activity\nassessed by cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition in SARS-CoV infected\nVero cultures revealed that compounds effectively inhibit both FFM1\nand 6109 strains of SARS-CoV replication.\n\nAmong these inhibitors, compound 49 exhibited promising\nactivity with low toxicity in cells, protecting the cells with an\nEC50 value of 2.5 \u03bcM and exhibiting a selectivity\nindex >40.68 In addition, compound 49 showed low toxicity in mice. From the SAR studies, P1-glutamine,\na residue that has been identified as a conservative recognition site\nin SARS-CoV 3CLpro, can be replaced by N,N\u2032-dimethyl glutamine (see 49\u201351). However, compound 54, a potent\ncaspase inhibitor with P1-aspartic acid, abolished activity in this\nseries.68 Furthermore, the P2-leucine can\nalso be replaced by isoleucine (50) and valine (51). The active compounds 49\u201351 were found to be inactive against rhinovirus type-2 in a cell-based\nassay suggested that compounds 49\u201351 are specific against SARS-CoV. Compound 51 was found\nto have low toxicity in mice after administration of a single dose\nat 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg. No weight loss or behavioral changes nor\nany gross pathology of the major organs was observed at the tested\ndoses. This study suggested that compound 51 could be\na promising candidate for animal efficacy studies68\n\nAbeles et al. proposed that trifluoromethyl ketones\n(FMK)71 can also be used as protease inhibitors.72 An interesting feature of these inhibitors is\nthe formation of thermodynamically stable hemiketal or hemithioketal\nthat occurs upon nucleophilic attack by the Ser-hydroxyl or Cys-thiol\ngroups present in the serine or cysteine protease, respectively. On\nthe basis of this observation, Hayashi et al. reported Gln-derived\nCF3\u2013 ketones 55 and 56 as SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors (Figure 15).73 Compounds 55 and 56 showed modest inhibitory\nactivity due to the formation of typical cyclic structures that are\nnot expected to interact effectively with the active site.69 To avoid this problem, the side chain at the\nP1 site was modified in order to block cyclization.74\u221277 As shown in Figure 15, compounds 57(74) and 58(75) showed excellent activities and further optimization provided\ncompounds 59\u201360,76,77 which showed low nanomolar inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.\n\nWhile continuing to explore the SARs based on FMK inhibitors,\na\nseries of trifluoro methyl ketones 61\u201368 were developed, mainly focusing on the P1 and P2\u2013P4 positions\n(Table 6).78 Three different amino acids were demonstrated\nas variable residues at positions P1\u2013P4. The inhibitory activities\nwere observed to range from 10 to 50 \u03bcM. The potent inhibitor,\ncompound 61, which possesses the same moiety as the substrate\nsequence of the peptide at the P1\u2013P4 sites, exhibited comparable\nactivity to other compounds. As shown in Table 6, replacement of the P1-benzyl (62) with a methyl group (64) or hydrogen (66) resulted in a loss of activity. Inhibitor 61 showed\ntime-dependent inhibition, with a Ki value\nof 0.3 \u03bcM after a 4 h incubation.78\n\nIt was previously\nproposed that HIV protease inhibitors could serve as good starting\npoints for the development of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors.\nIn general, reversible inhibitors produce fewer side effects than\nsuicide inhibitors and are thus more suitable for drug development.\nRecently, compound 69, a noncovalent HIV protease inhibitor\n(Ki = 1.5 nM), was used as a lead structure\nand optimized using computational analysis for the development of\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors.79 As shown in the Figure 16, introduction of peripheral Val-Ala residues in place of\nthe Cbz groups or introduction of 3-indolyl groups in place of the\nphenyl groups in compound 69 led to the formation of\ninhibitors (70 and 71) that were potent\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors with Ki values of 0.34 and 0.073 \u03bcM, respectively. In addition,\ncompound 71 is highly selective for the 3CLpro, with no inhibition observed against HIV protease at 100 \u03bcM.\n\nAn HPLC-based\nscreen of electrophilic compounds revealed etacrynic acid derivatives 73 (75% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM and Ki = 45.8 \u03bcM) and 74 (88% inhibition at 100\n\u03bcM and Ki = 35.3 \u03bcM) as effective\ninhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.80 These inhibitors were obtained from the sequential modifications\nof an etacrynic acid (72), a well-known diuretic drug,81 and also showed activity toward the cysteine\nproteases such as papain protease (Ki =\n375 \u03bcM).82 Ester 73 showed\nmore potency toward papain protease (Ki = 3.2 \u03bcM) than SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Ki = 45.8 \u03bcM). However, etacrynic acid amide (74, Ki = 35.3 \u03bcM) was found\nto have more affinity toward SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The SAR studies\nrevealed that chloro substituents on the phenyl moiety were necessary\nfor SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibition (Figure 17). Compounds with an unsubstituted phenyl\nring or methyl substituent were inactive at 100 \u03bcM.80 In addition, it is quite promising that only\nesters or amides display 3CLpro inhibition.80\n\nIt has been established that certain isatin (2,3-dioxindole) compounds\nare potent inhibitors of rhinovirus 3Cpro.83 Because the proteases of SARS-CoV and rhinovirus share\nsimilar active sites and catalytic residues,15 isatin derivatives may also be good candidates for anti-SARS drug\ndevelopment. Accordingly, a series of synthetic isatin derivatives\n(75\u201381) were reported as noncovalent\nSARS protease inhibitors,84,85 unlike rhinovirus 3Cpro, which has a covalent bond binding mode (Table 7). These isatin derivatives\ninhibited SARS-CoV 3CLpro in the low micromolar range,\nand inhibitors 78 and 80 were found to be\nthe most potent. SAR studies revealed that the inhibitory potency\nheavily depended on the hydrophobicity and electron affinity of the\nsubstituents on the isatin core. Moreover, computational analysis\n(docking studies of 78 with PDB ID 1UK4, see SI, Figure S5) of both active compounds showed that\nthey fit very well into the active pocket of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The two carbonyl groups on isatin could form hydrogen bond interactions\nwith the NH groups on Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, and the His41 side chain.\nIn addition, compounds 78 and 80(86) exhibited better selectivity for SARS than for\nother proteases including papain (103, 87.24 \u03bcM), chymotrypsin\n(1 mM, 10.4 \u03bcM) and trypsin (362, 243 \u03bcM).\n\nChemotherapeutic agents that\ntarget viral entry are an important\nclass of antiviral therapy as they can block the propagation of the\nvirus at an early stage, thus minimizing the chance for the virus\nto evolve and acquire drug resistance. Screening of Chinese herbal\nmedicine-based molecules resulted in the discovery of luteolin (82) as inhibitor of wild-type SARS-CoV activity with an effective\nconcentration (EC50) of 10.6 \u03bcM (Figure 18).87 Compound 82 was identified as active using a two-step\nscreening method consisting of frontal affinity chromatography\u2013mass\nspectrometry coupled with a viral infection assay based on a human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV)-luc/SARS pseudotyped virus. This flavone\nanalogue binds with the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV and thus\ncan interfere with the entry of the virus into the host cells. However,\nthe related flavone quercetin (83) and its derivatives\nexhibited modest inhibitory activity against the SARS virus (Figure 18).\n\nQuercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside\n(84) was identified\nas a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV and showed inhibitory activity\nwith an IC50 of 42.79 \u00b1 4.97 \u03bcM in a SPR/FRET-based\nenzymatic inhibition assay.88 The docking\nstudy of 84 with SARS-CoV 3CLpro suggested\nthat the residue Gln189 (Q189) plays a key role in the binding interaction.\nTo confirm this prediction, the binding mode of 84 was\ncompared between the wild-type SARS-CoV 3CLpro and its\nmutated SARS-CoV 3CLpro Q189A. This comparative study was\nconsistent with the docking prediction and the inhibitory potency\nof 84 on SARS-CoV 3CLpro Q189A was significantly\ndecreased to 127.89 \u00b1 10.06 \u03bcM. Besides, the experimental\nevidence showed that the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro was not affected by the Q189A mutation. The l-fucose derivative\n(85) exhibited 2-fold potent inhibitory activity compared\nto 84. The SAR and molecular docking studies of these\nnew derivatives revealed that four hydroxy groups on the quercetin\nmoiety are key determinants for its potential biological activity.\n\nAs part of ongoing investigation of bioflavonoids from medicinal\nplants as potential SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors, a series\nof inhibitors (86\u201390) were reported\nfrom the leaves of Torreya nucifera (Figure 18).89 Among the isolated compounds, biflavone amentoflavone\n(86) was recognized as a potent noncompetitive inhibitor,\nexhibiting an IC50 value of 8.3 \u03bcM. An SAR study\ndemonstrated the three authentic flavones, apigenin (90), luteolin (82), and quercetin (83), showed\ninhibitory activities (IC50) of 280.8, 20.2, and 23.8 \u03bcM,\nrespectively. The activity of amentoflavone (86) was\nconsistent with the binding interactions (docking studies of 86 with PDB ID 2Z3E, see SI, Figure S6), with\nVal186 and Gln192 as one of the key binding modes with the target\nsite. Moreover, the binding energy difference between apigenin (90; \u22127.79 kcal/mol) and amentoflavone (86; \u221211.42 kcal/mol) are consistent with a 30-fold lower IC50 value of 86 toward SARS-CoV 3CLpro than apigenin (90).\n\nA series of\nditerpenoids (91\u201393) from Torreya nucifera were evaluated for their anti-SARS\nactivity (Figure 19).89 However, these terpenoids exhibited\nvery low activity compared to biflavonoids against SARS-CoV 3CLpro at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. One exception was\nferruginol (91, IC50 = 49.6 \u03bcM), which\nexhibited significantly greater activity. Moreover, the quinone-methide\ntriterpenoids celastrol (94), pritimererin (95), tingenone (96), and iguesterin (97)\nwere isolated from the methanol (95%) extracts of Tripterygium\nregelii (Celastraceae) and showed moderate inhibitory\nactivities with IC50 values of 2.6, 9.9, 5.5, and 10.3\n\u03bcM, respectively, whereas the corresponding a semisynthetic\nanalogue dihydrocelastrol (98: IC50 = 21.7\n\u03bcM) reduced the inhibitory potency (Figure 19).90 A SAR study\nsuggested that the quinone\u2013methide moiety in the A ring and\nthe more hydrophobic E-ring assist in producing the potent inhibitory\nactivity. The compounds mentioned above (91\u201398) have been proven to be competitive inhibitors using kinetic\nanalysis.\n\nFurthermore, abietane-type\nditerpenoids and lignoids exhibit a\nstrong anti-SARS-CoV effect.91 In particular,\nbetulinic acid 99 and savinin 100 were shown\nto act as competitive inhibitors against SARS-CoV 3CLpro with the Ki values of 8.2 and 9.1 \u03bcM,\nrespectively (Figure 19).91 On the basis of molecular modeling\nanalysis, it was observed that the competitive inhibition of 99 and 100 on SARS-CoV 3CLpro activity\nwas consistent with the formation of multiple hydrogen bond interactions\nbetween the compound and specific amino acid residues located at the\nactive site of the pocket of the protease enzyme.\n\nStructure-based\nvirtual screening of a chemical database containing 58855 compounds\nfor SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibition produced two hits, sulfone\n(101) and dihydroimidazole (102) (Figure 20).92 The core structures of these two hits, defined by a molecular\ndocking study, were used for further searches of analogues.\n\nAccordingly, 21 analogues\nderived from these two hits exhibited\nIC50 values below 50 \u03bcM, and the two most potent\ncompounds (103 and 104) obtained from each\nhit show IC50 values of 0.3 and 3 \u03bcM, respectively.92 Furthermore, a combination of structure-based\nvirtual screening and three-dimensional quantitative structure\u2013activity\nrelationship (3D-QSAR) studies of compound databases of 59363 compounds\nled to the identification of compounds 105\u2013110, which exhibited modest inhibition with IC50 values of 3, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15 \u03bcM, respectively (Figure 20).93 On the basis of the structure\u2013functional analysis,\na common core structure, N-phenyl-2-(2-pyrimidinylthio)acetamide,\nwas identified. A potential binding mode of compound 105 was predicted by the molecular modeling study (docking study of 107 with PDB ID 1UK4, see SI, Figure S7); the\nstrong interaction of benzene and thiazole units with Glu166, Leu167,\nPro168, and Gln192 at the SARS-CoV 3CLpro active site could\nexplain its increase in potency.\n\nWong and co-workers94 reported a novel\nclass of mechanism-based irreversible inhibitors with activity in\nthe nanomolar range, using combinatorial synthesis in microtiter plates\nfollowed by in situ screening.95\u221297 Instead of the expected amide\nreaction products, a series of benzotriazole esters (111\u2013114) were isolated. Surprisingly, the inhibitory\nactivity of these analogues was much higher than that of the other\nsmall molecules or peptidomimetics. Further SAR optimization yielded\nanalogues 115\u2013118 with nanomolar\ninhibitory activities (Figure 21). An interesting point was found that the esters derived\nfrom the benzoic acid-containing electron withdrawing substituents,\ne.g., NO2, CN and CF3 were susceptible to hydrolysis,\nwhereas esters 111\u2013114 and those\nwith electron-donating substituents were relatively stable in pH 5.0\u20138.0\nsolutions over 24 h at room temperature. Compound 116 (Ki = 7.5 nM) was the most potent among\nthe benzotriazole esters.94 The possible\nmode of action could be acylation of Cys145 at the active site assisted\nby the catalytic dyad; this irreversible enzyme acylation was verified\nby electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the inhibited enzyme\nwith the compound 112 (Figure 22).\n\nIn addition, the recent\nX-ray crystal structure of the SARS-CoV\n3CLpro complex with the benzotriazole ester also confirmed\nthat the active-site cysteine is acylated by the ester ligand which\nacts as a suicide inhibitor.98 It should\nbe noted that the formation of N-hydroxybenzotriazole\nis a very potent inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes. Heteroaromatic ester 119 (IC50 = 0.5 \u03bcM) was also identified as\na potent inhibitor of the SARS coronavirus.99 The 5-chloropyridine moiety in compound 119 proved\nto be the key unit for activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Continuing SAR studies provided the very potent inhibitors 120\u2013123, with inhibitory activities spanning\nfrom the micromolar to nanomolar range.\n\nThe structural biology\nanalysis suggested, in addition to the halopyridyl\nunit, the other aromatic rings are also key factors for potent inhibition\n(Figure 21).100,101 A covalent bond formation mechanism for the enzyme\u2013inhibitor\ncomplex (120) has been proposed on the basis of electrospray\nmass spectrometry investigation (Figure 22).\n\nHowever, another strategy was demonstrated\nby combining key parts\nof the previously mentioned mechanism-based inhibitors (116 and 119) to produce a novel series of 5-chloropyridinyl\nindolecarboxylate inhibitors (124\u2013128) with enzymatic potency in the submicromolar range (Figure 23).102 The SAR study suggested that the positions of the carboxylic acid\nester and free indole hydrogen (NH) are critical for activity. Indole\ncarboxylate 124 with carboxylate functionality at position\n4 was the most potent inhibitor with an enzyme inhibitory activity\n(IC50) of 30 nM and an antiviral EC50 value\nof 6.9 \u03bcM.\n\n5-Halopyridinyl-3-aromatic esters, as described in\na previous section 5.6, act as highly potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CLpro with\nIC50 values in the low nanomolar range. They initially\nbind competitively and strongly to the active site but are then hydrolyzed\nby the enzyme as substrates and released. Despite their potent inhibition\nof SARS-CoV 3CLpro and relatively long half-life in buffer\nat neutral pH values, they are likely to be problematic as drug candidates\ndue to their propensity to be rapidly hydrolyzed by lipase, esterase,\nand other enzyme in the mammalian cells. Moreover, these compounds\ncan also potentially react nonspecifically with other thiols or nucleophiles\nin mammalian cells, thereby leading to toxicity. Therefore, to develop\nstable and noncovalent inhibitors based on pyridinyl esters, a group\nof methylene ketones and corresponding mono and difluorinated methylene\nketones were reported as SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors by\nZhang. J. et al. (Figure 24).103 Compounds 129, 131, and 132 showed the best inhibition,\nand specifically, inhibitor 129 was the most potent among\nthese analogues. The molecular modeling study of these active ketone\nanalogues predicts a binding conformation similar to that of corresponding\npyridinyl esters.100,101 A SAR study suggested that fluorination\ndecreases inhibition despite enhancing the electrophilicity of the\ncarbonyl carbon. Enzymatic analysis and ESI-MS studies indicate that\nthese inhibitors utilize a noncovalent, reversible mechanism of action.\n\nHigh throughput\nscreening identified 3,3-dihydropyrazolidine 133(104) and tetrasubstituted pyrazole 134,105 which displayed 1,3,5-triaryl substitution\npatterns, as SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors. Further exploration\nof SAR produced a series of pyrazolones that demonstrated inhibitory\nactivities against SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Figure 25).106 Among them,\ncompounds 135\u2013137 exhibited potent\ninhibitory activities with the IC50 values of 5.5, 6.8,\nand 8.4 \u03bcM, respectively.\n\nStructure\u2013functionality analysis indicated that the\n4-carboxylbenzylidine-aryl\nring attached to C4-of pyrazolone accompanied by electron withdrawing\ngroups, such as CN, NO2, and F, favors inhibitory activity.\nMolecular modeling studies of the active compound 137 predicted that the N1-phenyl group located in the\nS1 pocket and the carboxyl benzylidene group in the S3 pocket of 3CLpro is crucial for its inhibitory activity. Pyrimidine derivatives\n(138\u2013140) were designed, and their\nanti-SARS activity was reported (Figure 25).107,108 Compound 140 was the most potent inhibitor that showed enzyme inhibitory activity\n(IC50 = 6.1 \u03bcM) against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. SAR studies revealed that the presence of nitro functionality at\nposition 4 on the benzylidene ring was more important for activity\nenhancement. This potent activity was consistent with a molecular\ndocking study (docking study of 140 with PDB ID 1UK4, see SI, Figure S8);38 the\noxygen of the nitro group formed a hydrogen bond with side chains\nof Gly143 and Cys145. In addition, the 4-chloro phenyl ring was predicted\nto fit into the S2 pocket due to hydrophobic inter actions.\n\nStarting from the\npeptide inhibitor 47 (see section 4.5),67 a novel\nnonpeptide decahydroisoquinoline inhibitor\nwas designed and synthesized based on the cleavage site interactions\nat the S1, and hydrophobic interaction at the S2 sites of SARS SARS-CoV\n3CLpro.109 The decahydroisoquinoline\ninhibitors (141\u2013144, Figure 26) showed weak inhibitory activities\nfor SARS-CoV 3CLpro, which confirmed that the fused ring\nstructure of the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold can be accommodated\nin the active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. From the X-ray crystallographic\nstudies (PDB ID 4TWW), it was confirmed that the decahydroisoquinoline inhibitors were\nat the active site cleft of 3CLpro, as observed in peptide\u2013aldehyde\ninhibitors. The decahydroisoquinoline scaffold was inserted into a\nlarge S2 pocket and occupied most of the pocket. The P1 site imidazole\nwas inserted into the S1 pocket as expected. These interactions were\neffective in holding the terminal aldehyde tightly inside the active\nsite cleft, which resulted in the compact fitting of the novel scaffold\nto SARS-CoV 3CLpro.\n\nJacobs et al. conducted a high-throughput\nscreening of NIH molecular libraries (\u223c293000 compounds) by\nevaluating the inhibition of 3CLpro mediated peptide cleavage\nusing a novel FRET-based substrate.110,111 In this screen,\na dipeptide class, represented by 3-pyridyl-based hit 145 (Figure 27) was\nidentified.\n\nOptimization study based\non derivatives (Ugi library) structurally\nrelated to hit compound 145 resulted in a series of 3-pyridyl-based\ninhibitors among which the two compounds, 146 and 147 (Figure 27), were shown to be active against SARS-CoV 3CLpro.\n\nThe X-ray crystal structure of 146 bound to SARS-CoV\n3CLpro (Figure 28) demonstrated that the binding orientation of 146 was similar to that of known covalent peptidomimetic inhibitors\n(for example compound 11) and preferentially occupies\nthe S3\u2013S1\u2032 subpockets of SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme\nas R-enantiomer. The tert-butyl\namide occupies the S3-pocket, the tert-butylanilido\ngroup occupies the deep S2-pocket, and the 3-pyridyl moiety occupies\nthe S1; the furyl amide acts as a P1\u2032 group. Inhibitor 146 lacks a reactive warhead.\n\nOn the basis of the SAR for 146 and related\nanalogues,\nfirst a chemical library focusing exclusively on the P1\u2032 group\nwas synthesized while holding the P1\u2013P3 groups constant. This\nresulted in a series of inhibitors.110 The\nSAR study around P1\u2032 of 146 showed that the five-membered\n\u03c0-excessive heterocycles proved the most successful 148\u2013153 (Figure 29A). Especially, compound bearing imidazole (150) and 5-chlorofuran (152) analogue exhibited equipotent\nto 146 with IC50 values of 6.0 and 5.2 \u03bcM,\nrespectively. Next, the P1 3-pyridyl unit in 146 was\nreplaced with its isosteres in order to identify alternate hydrogen\nbond acceptor groups. This effort led to identify another set of compounds\n(154\u2013156, Figure 29B). Among them, only pyridazine (154) and pyrazine (155) were tolerated, although no improvement\nwas found around the pyridyl ring over 146. Both 2-and\n4-pyridyl (156) analogues were not tolerable and reduced\nthe potency.110\n\nIn a continuing study, the racemic\ncompound 146 was\npurified by chiral supercritical fluid chromatography to separate 146-(R) (ML188)110 and 146-(S) enantiomers (Figure 29C). The evaluation\nof a compound 146-(R) exhibited inhibitory\nactivity with an IC50 of 1.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM against\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro, while the other enantiomer 146-(S) was inactive. The mechanism of inhibition of\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro by 146-(R) was determined to be competitive (Ki, 1.6 \u00b1 0.26 \u03bcM) with noncovalent inhibition. Owing to\nthe excellent 3CLpro inhibition and antiviral activity\n(12.9 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcM) against mock-infected and SARS-CoV infected\nVero E6 Cells, 146-(R) was elected as\na first in class probe candidate from the furyl amide.\n\nFollowing\nthe identification of probe compound 146-(R), the same research group continued their further\nefforts to develop potent, noncovalent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors\nbased upon a chemical class of benzotriazoles from MLPCN screening.112 This resulted in a hit compound 157 (Figure 30A) demonstrating\na SARS-CoV 3CLpro IC50 of 6.2 \u03bcM and good\nselectivity versus PLpro (IC50 > 60 \u03bcM).\n\nThe X-ray crystal structure\nof 157 bound to SARS-CoV\n3CLpro shows the diamide 157 binds into an\ninduced-fit binding site that is formed by a rearrangement of the\nGln189 and Met49 residue side chains (PDB ID 4MDS, Figure 31). This induced fit site accommodates\nthe syn-N-methyl pyrrole and anilido\nacetamide moieties of the inhibitors within subpockets that can be\ncharacterized as S2\u2013S4 and S2\u2013S1\u2032 subpockets,\nrespectively. Figure 30A schematically illustrates the inhibitor-active site interactions\noriented in a similar manner as depicted in Figure 31.\n\nTo improve the activity, first,\nthe SAR study focusing on benzotriazole\nreplacements in 157 for alternate hydrogen bond acceptor\nfunctionality was demonstrated. This resulted the replacement of benzotriazole\nwith 4-phenyl 1,2,3-trizole 158 (IC50 of 11\n\u03bcM, Figure 30A) was tolerable.\n\nSecond, the acetamide modification (P2\u2013P1\u2032\nregion)\nwith a series of cyclic and acyclic congeners yielded many inhibitors\nwhich show activities below 10 \u03bcM (159\u2013162, Figure 30B), specifically, the branched i-propyl derivative\n(159) and cyclobutylamide (160) having the\ngreatest activity below 5 \u03bcM.\n\nThird, the researchers turned\nto P3-truncation for minimum pharmacophore\nto reduce overall molecular weight. This effort led to a series of\nanalogues and SAR proved that truncated amides (163\u2013167, Figure 30C) have comparable activity versus the elaborated amides; for example,\ncompare 163\u2013167 Vs 159\u2013162. The compound 167 represented\nthe first sub-100 nM inhibitor for the series and one of the most\npotent nonwarhead based SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors to date.\n\nFrom the above compounds, one of the potent inhibitors, 165 (ML300)112 was selected for probe declaration.113 The biological profiles of inhibitors 146-(R), 160, and 165 are indicated in Figure 32. Relative to probe 146-(R)\nand the equipotent diamide 160, the compound 165 proved to offer progresses in several areas. Inhibitor 165 is \u223c100 amu lower MW (MW = 431) relative to 160 with moderate ligand efficiency (LE).114 Moderate cLogP value of 165 (cLogP = 3.2) greatly improves\nligand efficiency-dependent lipophilicity (LELP)114 versus 146-(R) and 160. When both probe 146-(R)\nand 165 tested in an in-house in vitro DMPK panel including\nplasma protein binding, P450 enzyme inhibition, and intrinsic clearance\nusing liver microsomes, both 146-(R)\nand 165 possess good free fraction. However, intrinsic\nclearance indicates both 146-(R) and 165 are predicted to be highly cleared. 146-(R) and 165 possess modest P450 enzyme inhibition,\nwith 165 maintaining 5\u201310 \u03bcM activity across\nfour major CYP enzymes (see Figure 32). Probe 165 was found to be highly selective\nin a Eurofins lead-profiling screen,115 with only modest activity (10 \u03bcM) for melatonin MT1 receptor\nin a radioligand binding assay.\n\nMetal ions have been shown to inhibit\nmany viral proteases such\nas 3CLpro of noroviruses, papain-like protease (PLP2) of\nSARS-CoV, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) protease, and hepatitis C virus\n(HCV) NS3 protease.116\u2212120 The screening of 960 metal conjugated compounds allowed inhibitors\nwith potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro to be identified. These include competitive inhibitors phenyl mercuric\nacetate (168, Ki = 0.7 \u03bcM),\nthimerosal (169, Ki = 2.4\n\u03bcM), and phenyl mercuric nitrate (170, Ki = 0.3 \u03bcM) (Figure 33).121,122 However, inhibition\nwas more pronounced using zinc-conjugated compounds (171\u2013174), i.e., 1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc\n(171, Ki = 0.17 \u03bcM)\ncompared to Zn2+ ions alone (Ki = 1.1 \u03bcM).\n\nThe X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro\u2013168 (PDB ID 1Z1I) revealed that phenyl-bound mercury occupied\nthe S3 pocket, which\nis responsible for its enzymatic activity. Hg(II) ions are known to\ncause toxic effects because the affinity of Hg2+ ions to\nthiol groups in proteins leads to nonspecific inhibition of cellular\nenzymes.123 However, regarding the structures\nof zinc-centered complexes, the zinc ion plays a key role in targeting\nthe catalytic residues via binding to the His41\u2013Cys145 catalytic\ndyad to yield a zinc central tetrahedral geometry. This type of inhibition\nwas similar to the zinc-mediated serine protease inhibitor keto-BABIM-Zn2+ for trypsin in that a zinc ion was coordinated to the two\nchelating nitrogen atoms of bis(5-amidino-2-benimidazilyl)methane\n(BABIM) and the two catalytic residues (His-Ser) of trypsin in the\ntetrahedral geometry.124 The safety of\nzinc-containing compounds for human use has been indicated by the\nfact that zinc acetate and zinc sulfate are added as supplements to\ndrugs for the treatment of Wilson\u2019s disease and Behcet\u2019s\ndisease, respectively.125,126 Moreover, the possibility\nof zinc complexes incorporated into cells through the cell membrane\nwas also demonstrated by studies on type-2 diabetic treatment.127\n\nAnalysis of the active site cavity of\nthis SARS\u2013cysteine\nprotease reveals the presence of a subsite contains a cluster of serine\nresidues (Ser139, Ser144, and Ser147) and is an attractive target\nfor the design of high affinity small molecule inhibitors. This cluster\nis conserved in all known coronavirus proteases. In particular, Ser139\nand Ser147 are conserved in all known coronavirus. Because of the\nknown potential reactivity of boronic acid compounds with the hydroxyl\ngroup of the serine residue, a series of bifunctional boronic acid-conjugated\ncompounds (175\u2013177) have been reported\nagainst SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme (Figure 33).128 The greatest\nimprovement in affinity was achieved with an amide type compound (177) with a Ki of 40 nM. Isothermal\ntitration microcalorimetric experiments indicated that these inhibitors\nbind reversibly to SARS-CoV 3CLpro in an enthalpically\nfavorable manner, implying that they establish strong interactions\nwith the protease molecule.\n\nOver the\npast decade, in silico virtual screening (VS), in particular\nstructure-based virtual screening (SBVS), has emerged as a reliable,\ncost-effective, and time-saving technique for the discovery of lead\ncompounds as an alternative to high throughput screening (HTPS).129 The application of VS to the discovery of new\nenzyme inhibitors involves docking, computational fitting of the compound\nstructure to the active site of an enzyme, and scoring and ranking\nof each compound.130 On the basis of the\nstructural information, 361413 structurally diverse small molecules\nwere screened by a \u201cgenome-to-drug-lead\u201d approach. Compound 178 showed modest activity against targeted human SARS-CoV\n3CLpro Toronto-2-strain with an EC50 of 23 \u03bcM\n(Figure 34). Virtual\nscreening of 50240 structurally diverse small molecules allowed 104\ncompounds with anti-SARS-CoV activities to be identified.131 Inhibitor 179 showed potent inhibitory\nactivity with an IC50 value of 2.5 \u03bcM and an EC50 of 7 \u03bcM in a Vero cell-based SARS-CoV plaque reduction\nassay (Figure 34).\nAnother group of researchers, using a quenched fluorescence resonance\nenergy transfer assay, screened 50000 drug-like molecules, resulting\nin 572 hits.99 After applying a series\nof virtual and experimental filters, five structurally novel molecules\nwere identified that showed potent inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.5\u20137 \u03bcM) against SARS-CoV 3CLpro.\n\nAmong them, compounds 180 (IC50 =\n4.3 \u03bcM)\nand 181 (IC50 = 4.3 \u03bcM) (Figure 34) showed good inhibitory activity\nof SARS-CoV 3CLpro and exhibited interesting selectivity\nwith no inhibition against other proteases tested (HAV 3Cpro, NS3pro, chymotrypsin, and papain).99\n\nThe elucidation of the crystal structure of SARS-CoV\n3CLpro provided enormous opportunities for the discovery\nof inhibitors\nthrough rational drug design. As part of an effort to discover small\nmolecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, structure-based\nvirtual screening of 32000 small molecules was screened against the\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme.47 Use\nof knowledge-based filters yielded 27 molecules for follow-up. A biological\nevaluation of the inhibitors in the low micromolar range found two\ncompounds, 182 and 183, with IC50 values of 18.2 and 17.2, respectively (Figure 34). It has been reported that several nucleoside\nderivatives have 6-chloropurine as a nucleobase showed potent antiviral\nactivity against some types of viruses.132,133 Because 6-chloropurine analogues are known to inhibit bacterial\nRNA polymerases, a series of nucleoside analogues with 6-chloropurines\nwere evaluated for anti-SARS-CoV activity by a plaque reduction activity.134 Among them, two compounds, 184 and 185, exhibited modest anti-SARS-CoV activity (IC50 values of 48.7 and 14.5 \u03bcM, respectively) that was\ncomparable to those of mizoribine and ribavirin (Figure 34). This study revealed several\nSAR trends such as a 6-chloropurine moiety, 5\u2032-hydroxy, and\nprotected (benzylated)-5\u2032-hydroxy group are responsible for\nthe potent inhibitory activity.\n\nRibavirin, a broad-spectrum\nof inhibitor of RNA and DNA viruses,\nwas used for the treatment of SARS affected patients135 but it does not inhibit viral growth at concentrations\nattainable in human serum. In contrast, interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 showed\nan in vitro inhibitory effect at concentrations of 1000 IU/mL.136 Interestingly, the combination of ribavirin\nand IFN-\u03b2 synergistically inhibited SARS-CoV replication. The\nHIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir137 and\nthe antimalarial agent chloroquine138 showed\nstrong inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV replication. However,\nno cytoprotective effect was found for nelfinavir in an independent\nstudy.139,140 Structure-based virtual screening of compounds\nwas conducted to identify novel SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors.141 The top-ranked 1468 compounds with free binding\nenergy ranging from \u221214.0 to \u221217.09 kcal mol\u20131 were selected to evaluate the hydrogen bond interactions in the\nactive site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Among them, 53 compounds\nwere selected for their inhibitory activity toward SARS-CoV 3CLpro from Escherichia coli. Two\nof the compounds (186 and 187) were demonstrated\nto be competitive inhibitors of 3CLpro with Ki values of 9.11 and 9.93 \u03bcM, respectively (Figure 34).141 A detailed docking simulation analyses suggested\nthat these inhibitors could be stabilized by the formation of hydrogen\nbonds with catalytic residues and the establishment of hydrophobic\ncontacts at the opposite region of the active site. In particular,\nfor the potent compound 187, the nitrophenyl group was\nlikely to be very crucial in the SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory\nactivity through its formation of H-bonds with Cys145 and Gly143,\nas well as its hydrophobic interactions with His41 and Cys145.\n\nRecently, the combination of virtual screening (VS) and high-throughput\nscreening (HTS) techniques were applied to screen 41000 compounds\nfrom structurally diverse libraries have allowed novel, nonpeptidic\nsmall molecule inhibitors (188, IC50 = 13.9\n\u03bcM) and (189, IC50 = 18.2 \u03bcM)\nagainst human SARS-CoV 3CLpro to be identified (Figure 34).142 Because the newly identified compounds are\nof low molecular weight, they were examined for selectivity against\nthree proteases, namely SARS-CoV PLpro (a cysteine protease),\nhuman UCH-L1 (a cysteine protease), and hepatitis C virus NS3/4A (a\nserine protease), and two nonproteolytic enzymes, Bacillus\nanthracis dihydroorotase and Streptococcus\npneumoniae PurC. Compound 189 displayed\ngood selectivity for SARS-CoV 3CLpro and did not show inhibitory\nactivity (>200 \u03bcM) against other five enzymes, whereas compound 188 showed 20-fold selectivity against the two SARS cysteine\nproteases, 3CLpro and PLpro, over other enzymes.\nBecause low molecular weight compounds typically lack high specificity,\nlack of inhibition of compound 188 for other enzymes,\nespecially the UCH-L1 cysteine protease, is particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe emergence of SARS and\nthe identification of a coronavirus as\nthe causative agent of the disease astounded the coronavirus community,\nas it was the first definitive association of a coronavirus with a\nsevere disease in humans. Because the first crystal structure of the\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro dimer with a peptidic CMK inhibitor covalently\nbound was elucidated in 2003, over 20 crystal structures of the enzyme\nhave been reported. Structure-based design and virtual screens have\nprovided both peptidomimetic and nonpeptidomimetic inhibitors with\npotency in the micromolar to nanomolar range. Yet, to date, there\nis no effective therapy for the treatment of SARS in humans, and to\nour knowledge, no CoV 3CLpro inhibitor has been taken into\nclinical development. In this perspective, we have described the SAR\nfor several classes of inhibitors, highlighting their structural features\nand binding modes. Both peptidomimetic and small molecule SARS-CoV\n3CLpro are largely based on a warhead-based design strategy.\nSo far, only a few inhibitors have been described that exhibit good\nenzymatic and cellular potency, and the majority of these inhibitors\nhave not been followed up with additional studies (such as antiviral\nactivity or in vivo evaluation), likely due to their unattractive\nstructures and/or their nonideal physiochemical properties.\n\nThe reactive warhead groups used in peptidomimetic inhibitors for\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro include Michael acceptors, aldehydes, epoxy\nketones, electrophilic ketones such as halomethyl ketones, and trifluoromethyl\nketones. Although these peptidomimetics are covalent inhibitors with\nthe potential for toxicity, significant improvements have been made\nin enzymatic and cellular potency.\n\nOf the many peptidomimetics\ninhibitors described in the literature,\nthose highlighted in Figure 35 appear to be the most promising for further optimization\nefforts. Compound 2 (Figure 5) is an example of an inhibitor incorporating\na Michael acceptor. It was developed by Pfizer as an inhibitor of\nhuman rhinovirus 3C protease for common cold (targeted rhinovirus\n3C-protease). Although 2 was not active against SARS-CoV\nin cell culture, it served as a good starting point for anti-SARS\ndrug design, leading to inhibitors 8 and 18 (see section 4.1), which are the two most potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV 3CLpro incorporating a Michael acceptor warhead. Specifically,\ncompound 8 exhibited excellent cellular potency with\nan EC50 value of 0.18 \u03bcM and it is a nontoxic anti-SARS\nagent. However, further in vivo studies for compound 8 have not been reported in the literature.\n\nPeptidic aldehydes are promising enzymatic inhibitors, but\nthey\nare unlikely to be effective as therapeutic agents due to their rapid\nin vivo metabolism and low oral bioavailability. In contrast, the\npeptide aldehyde thrombin inhibitor efegatran was well tolerated in\na phase I clinical trial.143,144 Inhibitor 45, a potent peptide aldehyde, showed remarkable activity against SARS-CoV\nand human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E replications, reducing the viral\ntiter by 4.7 log (at 5 \u03bcM) for SARS-CoV and 5.2 log (at 1.25\n\u03bcM) for HCoV 229E. This inhibitor also displayed a stable profile\nin mouse, rat, and human plasma (see section 4.5) and may represent a starting point for\nthe development of an anti-SARS agent.\n\nInhibitor 51 is one of the potent inhibitors in the\nhalomethyl series, exhibiting low toxicity in mice after a single\nip dose at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, no weight loss, behavioral changes,\nor gross pathology of major organs was observed at the tested doses\n(see section 4.6).\nThe low molecular weight of 51 is a potential advantage.\nBecause peptidyl monofluoromethyl ketones have been shown to be effective\nin vivo,145\u2212147 the inhibitor 51 may be a suitable\ncandidate for further in vivo efficacy and toxicology studies.\n\nNumerous small molecules were also discussed in this perspective.\nThe majority of efforts to develop nonpeptide SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors have also relied on warhead-based design strategy, and\nseveral of these nonpeptide inhibitors achieved nanomolar potency.\nThe most interesting inhibitors (78, 116, 119, 124, 129, 146, 160, 165, and 186) are illustrated\nin Figure 36. In the\ncase of pyridyl esters, the potent mechanism-based enzyme inactivator 124 (see section 5.6) achieved cell-based inhibition below 10 \u03bcM in SARS-CoV\ninfected Vero E6 cells. Compounds 146-(R), 160, and 165 are promising examples\nof noncovalent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors of moderate molecular\nweights and good enzymatic and antiviral activity (see section 5.10). These inhibitors\nare potential starting points for the design of more potent 3CLpro inhibitors with a noncovalent mechanism of action. However,\nfurther in vivo studies for above-mentioned small molecules have not\nreported so far.\n\nAlthough many structural and nonstructural\nproteins are known to\nbe potential targets for anticoronavirus therapy, none of them are\nwell-conserved due to their possible role in the viral life cycle,\nthus limiting the potential success of wide-spectrum inhibitors. In\ncontrast, the coronavirus 3CLpro is highly conserved among\ncoronaviruses, making it an attractive target for broad-spectrum inhibitors\n(see SI, Table S1).148 The proteases share 40\u201360% sequence identity and\n60\u2013100% sequence similarity. Therefore, targeting SARS-CoV\n3CLpro is an important approach for the development of\nantiviral therapy that can be applied for broad viral infections.\nRecent reports have revealed that many SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors\nshowed potential activity against the recent outbreak of MERS-CoV.149\n\nA feasible and rapid advancement in the\ndrug discovery for the\ndevelopment of effective chemotherapeutics against SARS-CoV might\nbe achieved by repurposing existing and clinically approved drugs.\nIt was recently reported that screening a library of drugs either\nclinically developed or with a well-defined cellular pathway from\ndifferent classes of therapeutics produced a series of compounds with\ngood activity against SARS-CoV.149 Drugs\nthat inhibit CoV included neurotransmitter inhibitors, estrogen receptor\nantagonists, kinase signaling inhibitors, protein-processing inhibitors,\ninhibitors of lipid or sterol metabolism, and inhibitors of DNA synthesis\nor pair. However, the inhibitors (peptidomimetics or nonpeptidomimetics)\nthat target other serine proteases (e.g., HCV protease, thrombin)\nand cysteine proteases (e.g., calpain, cathepsin K, caspases) have\nnot been tested against 3CLpro. For examples, ketoamides\n(such as A-705253 for calpain),150 nitriles\n(such as odanacatib/MK-0822 and vildagliptin/LAF237 for cathepsin\nK and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4)),151,152 phenyloxymethyl\nketones (such as VX-166 for caspases),153 fused triazole derivatives (such as sitagliptin/MK-0431 for DPP4),154 nonpeptides (such as apixaban/BMS-562247-01\nfor factor Xa),155 and beta lactams for\npenicillin binding proteins such as penicillin.156 Therefore, these structural types should be considered\nin future for the development of anti-SARS therapy.\n\nN-Finger residues (N-finger)\nof SARS 3CLpro play an important role in enzyme dimerization,\nand therefore peptides with N-terminal amino acid\nsequences may act as inhibitors of 3CLpro dimerization,\nsimilar HIV protease, and other viral enzymes.157\u2212163 In 2006, Wei et al. reported that N-terminal octapeptide\nN8 (Ki of 2.20 mM) was the first example\nof inhibitor targeting the dimeric interface of SARS 3CLpro,164 providing a novel strategy for drug\ndesign against SARS and other coronaviruses. However, no peptidomimetic\nor small molecule inhibitor has yet been reported in the literature.\nAlthough it would be a great challenge to explore new inhibitors of\ndimerization, with the current development of computational approaches,\nthe structure-based design of novel inhibitors may be successful.\n\nIn conclusion, although huge efforts have been taken by both academia\nand pharmaceutical industries, no coronavirus protease inhibitor has\nyet successfully completed a preclinical development program. We hope\nthat this perspective will be useful to medicinal chemists targeting\n3CLpro to identify novel anti-SARS CoV inhibitors with\ndrug-like properties and that effective therapy for coronaviruses\nwill be discovered."}
