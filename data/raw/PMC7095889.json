{"title": "Lack of small animal model hinders MERS coronavirus research", "body": "In the meantime, other researchers are working to establish laboratory models with which to study the how the virus takes its toll on the body and to test the efficacy of potential therapeutics. Earlier this year, a team led by Haagmans identified dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as the surface receptor employed by the MERS coronavirus to gain entry into host cells, including human ones3. Using crystallization techniques, George Gao and his colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing on 7 July described the molecular basis of the binding between the virus and DPP4 (ref. 4). And also last month, a group led by Shibo Jiang published a study demonstrating the immunogenic potency of a 286\u2013amino acid stretch on the MERS coronavirus's binding domain5\u2014a first step toward an eventual MERS vaccine.\n\n\u201cOur previous work with SARS helped us find a critical target quickly,\u201d says Jiang, head of the Laboratory of Viral Immunology at the New York Blood Center'. \u201cThe next step is to optimize the immune response.\u201d\n\nBut evaluating such a vaccine will require an animal model. And even though DDP4 has been identified in the lung cells of many rodents, including Syrian hamsters, researchers at the Laboratory of Virology of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in Hamilton, Montana, could not get the MERS coronavirus to replicate in this common infection model6.\n\nThe virus successfully causes illness in rhesus macaques, though. The same NIAID team, led by Heinz Feldmann, showed in April that pneumonia-like symptoms develop in macaques infected with MERS within 24 hours of infection, resulting in a respiratory disease similar to, but less severe than, that found in people with MERS7. The macaque system is not as practical and widely applicable as a small-animal model, and not that many research groups are working with it. But the NIAID team, for one, is now moving ahead with drug tests in the monkeys. Specifically, the researchers are evaluating whether two antiviral compounds\u2014alpha-interferon and ribavirin, both of which are used to treat hepatitis and other infections\u2014can clear MERS coronavirus infections. Both drugs inhibit viral replication in monkey cell lines with synergistic effects when administered together, Feldmann and his colleagues have shown8.\n\nWhether or not drugs like those are ultimately needed in response to a pandemic, NIAID director Anthony Fauci stresses the importance of being prepared. \u201cWe can't take the attitude that we escaped a bullet with SARS,\u201d he told Nature Medicine. \u201cThe MERS outbreak has rekindled the importance of sticking with our study of coronaviruses.\u201d"}
