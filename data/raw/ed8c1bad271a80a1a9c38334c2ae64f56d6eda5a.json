{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Positive result of Sars-Cov-2 in sputum from a cured patient with COVID-19", "body": "To the Editor: After the active treatment, the patient recovered from fever and other 2 respiratory symptoms on February 4. On February 9 and February 10, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was successively negative in his throat swab samples. The CT scan result showed that the inflammation was significantly decreased in both lungs. Both the results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection and CT scans indicated a recovery trend, and the patient was ready for discharge. On February 13, the throat swab and sputum by nebulization were collected before the patient was discharged. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was still detected in sputum from the patient although negative result of throat swab detection.\n\nWHO suggests that both specimens from upper and lower respiratory tracts should be tested to confirm the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 3 . We also found that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid might still be detectable in the lower respiratory tract specimens although negative results of throat swab detection. We hold the opinion that both specimens from upper and lower respiratory tracts must be collected for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection before COVID-19 patient could be discharged from hospital. "}
