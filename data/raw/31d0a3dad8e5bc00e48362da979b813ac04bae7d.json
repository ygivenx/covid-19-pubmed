{"title": "Scarce COVID-19 Testing Capabilities at Urgent Care Centers in States with Greatest Disease Burden", "body": "As of March 22, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. has reached nearly 30,000. 1 While rapid and accessible diagnosis is paramount to monitoring and reducing the spread of disease, COVID-19 testing capabilities across the U.S. remain constrained. For many individuals, urgent care centers (UCCs) may offer the most accessible avenue to be tested.\n\nUsing a phone survey, we describe the COVID-19 testing capabilities of UCCs in states with the greatest disease burden.\n\nWe identified ten states with the highest COVID-19 caseload as of March 19 according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). 2 25 UCCs, defined as walk-in clinics in ambulatory medical facilities, were randomly selected and called from each state using the Urgent Care Association \"Find an Urgent Care\" directory. UCCs were classified into independent, hospital/health network, and academic categories.\n\nUsing a standardized survey script (Figure 1 ), trained investigators asked UCC receptionists about COVID-19 testing ability, testing criteria, time to test results, costs of tests and visits for insured/uninsured patients, and test referrals. All 250 calls were made on March 20 and were limited to 1 minute to minimize occupying clinic resources.\n\nOf 250 UCCs contacted, 57 (22.8%) offered COVID-19 testing. Hospital/health networkaffiliated UCCs were more likely to offer COVID-19 tests compared to independent UCCs (odds ratio 3.69, 95% confidence interval 1.94-7.01, p<0.0001).\n\nOf UCCs that offered testing, 56 (98.2%) required the patient to be symptomatic (typically fever and respiratory symptoms) and 2 (0.4%) required a primary care physician .

The small number of UCCs contacted per state may not accurately represent the state's urgent care climate. Additionally, the rapidly changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may affect these findings. However, this study serves as an important snapshot that highlights the limited COVID-19 testing capabilities at UCCs in the most heavily burdened states.\n\n.
