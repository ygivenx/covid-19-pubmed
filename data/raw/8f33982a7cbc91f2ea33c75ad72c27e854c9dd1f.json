{"title": "", "body": "and packaging of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) are a few examples of this expression system (Furuta, Ogawa, Katsuda, Fujii, & Yamaji, 2010; Negrete, Yang, Mendez, Levy, & Kotin, 2007) .\n\nBombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is one of the most widely employed baculoviruses for gene expression. In the last 3 decades, BmNPV has undergone modifications in many ways to generate recombinant BmNPV that is more convenient and enhances the expression efficiency of foreign genes (Kato, Kajikawa, Maenaka, & Park, 2010; Maeda et al., 1985) . Compared with the AcMNPV-cell expression system, the BmNPV-silkworm system possesses better posttranslational processing and greater expression efficiency (Dojima et al., 2009; Usami et al., 2011 ). Previously, we successfully constructed a reBmBac system for recombinant BmNPV with increased efficiency (Liu et al., 2016) . By utilizing this system, researchers can proficiently and rapidly obtain recombinant baculoviruses and target proteins in silkworms.\n\nInterferons (IFNs) were first discovered in the 1950s, and since then, they have been researched deeply in many fields. Interferons are categorized into three major classes. Type I IFNs are generated by almost any type of cell in response to invading pathogens (Alsharifi, Mullbacher, & Regner, 2008) . They can induce the expression of specific antiviral proteins and related physiological responses by binding with specific receptors on the cell membrane (Levy, Marie, & Durbin, 2011) . Type II IFNs possess strong immune regulation ability and can regulate the activity of lymphocytes (Muller et al., 1994; Platanias, 2005) . Type III IFNs have been recently discovered. They have functions similar to those of type I IFNs (Kotenko, 2011; Sheppard et al., 2003) . Some studies indicate that type I and II IFNs demonstrate synergy in the establishment of an antiviral state (Muller et al., 1994; Platanias, 2005; Sekellick, Lowenthal, O'Neil, & Marcus, 1998) .\n\nChicken IFN-\u03b1 (chIFN-\u03b1) is a type I IFN. Research has revealed its antiviral potential against Rous sarcoma virus, Newcastle disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, and avian influenza virus in vitro and in vivo (Jiang, Yang, & Kapczynski, 2011; Marcus, van der Heide, & Sekellick, 1999; Meng et al., 2011; O'Neill, Livant, & Ewald, 2010) . Chicken IFN-\u03b3 (chIFN-\u03b3) is a type II IFN. It demonstrates avian virus inhibition both in vitro and in vivo and has the capability to prevent poultry coccidiosis (Cardenas-Garcia et al., 2016; Khatri & Sharma, 2008; Shah et al., 2010) . Studies also illustrate that chIFN-\u03b3 enhances the growth performance of reared broilers (Lowenthal, 2001) . These two IFNs have an immune synergism effect. The combination of chIFN-\u03b1 and chIFN-\u03b3 can significantly enhance viral inhibition and elicit an antiviral state (Plachy et al., 1999; Sekellick et al., 1998 ).\n\nIn the current study, recombinant BmNPV simultaneously carrying the chIFN-\u03b1 and chIFN-\u03b3 genes at distinct gene sites was constructed using the reBmBac system. This recombinant baculovirus was employed for the coexpression of two types of IFN and can provide a foundation for the combination of IFNs and their possible future therapeutic application.\n\nA Bombyx mori-derived cell line, Bm5, was cultured in TC100 insect cell culture medium (Applichem) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA) at 27\u00b0C according to published procedures (Summers & Smith, 1987) . DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and \n\nThe reBmBac vector was modified from BmNPV. An E. coli CopyControl origin of replication was inserted into the genome at chi-cat gene site. And tetracycline resistance gene was inserted at polyhedrin gene site. These two make sure the baculovirus DNA can be edited and amplified in E. coli. The essential ORF1629 gene was also partial deleted to make sure the highly recombination efficiency.\n\nAccording to a published protocol (Datsenko & Wanner, 2000; Liu et al., 2016) , the p10 gene of reBmBac baculovirus genomic DNA was replaced by the rpsL-neo cassette by phage \u03bb-Red recombinase in E. coli. Then, the rpsL-neo cassette was replaced by the chIFN-\u03b3 gene. The recombinant baculovirus shuttle vector containing the chIFN-\u03b3 gene at the p10 gene site was named reBmBac-p10C\u03b3.\n\nAccording to published procedures (Liu et al., 2016) , the pVL1393-C\u03b1 or pVL1393-C\u03b3 vector was mixed with the reBmBac vector. The mixture was used to cotransfect Bm5 cells. chIFN-\u03b1 and chIFN-\u03b3 genes were inserted into the baculovirus genome at the polyhedron gene site. The recombinant baculoviruses were named reBm-C\u03b1 and reBm-C\u03b3. A mixture of the pVL1393-C\u03b1 vector and reBmBac-p10C\u03b3 was then utilized to cotransfect Bm5 cells. chIFN-\u03b1 was transferred into the reBmBac-p10C\u03b3 genome at the polyhedron gene site. The recombinant baculovirus, which contained the chIFN-\u03b1 gene at the polyhedron site and the chIFN-\u03b3 gene at the p10 site, was named reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3. The recombinant baculoviruses reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3, reBm-C\u03b1, and reBm-C\u03b3 were purified by plaque screening (Pen, Welling, & Welling-Wester, 1989 ).\n\nFifth instar silkworm larvae or pupae were injected with 5 \u03bcl of cell culture media containing recombinant BmNPV (10 7 -10 8 plaqueforming units (PFU) mL \u22121 ) between abdominal knobs on the backside. Silkworm larvae and pupae were reared at 25 ~ 27\u00b0C and 65% humidity for 108-120 hr. Larval hemolymph was collected by cutting prolegs, and 1-phenyl-2-thiourea was added at 0.1 mM to prevent melanization. Larval hemolymph and pupae were stored at \u221220\u00b0C for subsequent assays.\n\nAccording to published procedures (Rein & Rubin, 1968) , chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were prepared. A CEF cell suspension was isolated from 9-to 11-day-old chicken embryos. The cell concentration was approximately 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells per milliliter. CEF cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a constant cell density of 1 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well for 8-12 hr at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 in air.\n\nA GFP-reduction assay with VSV-GFP was used to assay the antiviral activity of recombinant chicken IFNs in CEFs. Larval hemolymph containing IFN expression product was treated by ultrasonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant of the IFN product was filtered with a 0.22 \u03bcm syringe filter. Interferon supernatant was gradient diluted in DMEM with 7% FBS. After incubation with diluted IFN for 18-24 hr at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 in air, CEF cells were infected with VSV-GFP at 10 TCID 50 per well. After 24 hr, cell cytopathic effect (CPE) and green fluorescence were detected. The antiviral activity of IFNs was calculated according to the CPE reduction method (Ge et al., 2006) .\n\nIFN-\u03b1 is both acid and heat resistant. However, IFN-\u03b3 is easily deactivated by both acid (pH 2.0) and temperature (56\u00b0C) (Ho, Armstrong, & Breinig, 1975) . Thus, the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b1 in the coexpression product was studied. The pH value of larval hemolymph or pupa product was adjusted to 2.0 \u00b1 0.2 using a hydrochloric acid solution (0.1 M). After 24 hr of static incubation at 4\u00b0C and filtration, the pH value was adjusted to 7.0 \u00b1 0.1 using a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M). After 1 hr of static incubation at 4\u00b0C and filtration, the sample was heat treated (56\u00b0C) for 30 min. After filtration with a 0.22 \u03bcm syringe filter, IFN-\u03b3 of the product was deactivated.\n\nThe expression of IFN was detected by western blotting according to the Protein Blotting Guide (Bio-Rad). Relative expression levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in these products were detected by indirect ELISA. \n\nThe expression products of chIFN-\u03b1 and chIFN-\u03b3 were analyzed by Western blotting (Figure 2 ). Figure 2 demonstrates that an approximately 22 kDa protein band that reacted with an anti-chIFN-\u03b1 antibody was detected in reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3 and reBm-C\u03b1 expression samples.\n\nLikewise, an approximately 19 kDa protein band that reacted with an anti-chIFN-\u03b3 antibody was observed in reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3 and reBm-C\u03b3 expression samples. No corresponding immunoreactive protein was detected in the negative control sample from larval hemolymph infected with control BmNPV. Antiviral activity of recombinant IFNs was assayed utilizing a CPE inhibition assay with CEF cells. Recombinant IFN products could inhibit VSV-GFP infection in CEFs (Figure 3 ). The antiviral activity assay results indicated that the antiviral potential of reBm-C\u03b1, reBm-C\u03b3, and reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3 products were 3.26 \u00b1 0.61 \u00d7 10 6 IU/mL, 5.08 \u00b1 0.43 \u00d7 10 6 IU/mL, and 3.27 \u00b1 0.50 \u00d7 10 7 IU/mL in hemolymph, respectively. These recombinant baculovirus expression products were then acid (pH 2.0) and heat treated (56\u00b0C). IFN-\u03b1 is acid and heat resistant, but IFN-\u03b3 is acid and heat labile (Ho et al., 1975) . Therefore, the antiviral activity of the reBm-C\u03b1 product remained almost the same before and after treatment. The antiviral activity of the reBm-C\u03b3 product declined to an undetectable level. The antiviral activity of the reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3 product was still 5.78 \u00b1 0.88 \u00d7 10 6 IU/mL, which was due to IFN-\u03b1 activity. This activity was 2 times greater than that of the reBm-C\u03b1 product. This enhanced expression level of IFN-\u03b1 must be due to p10 gene deletion in coexpression recombinant baculovirus (Hitchman et al., 2010) .\n\nThe ELISA results for chIFN-\u03b3 illustrate that the expression level of chIFN-\u03b3 in reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3-infected larval hemolymph was approximately 2.5 times greater than that in reBm-C\u03b3-infected larval hemolymph ( Figure A1 ).\n\nThe reBm-C\u03b1 and reBm-C\u03b3 products were diluted to 10 \u00d7 10 4 IU/mL and mixed in different proportions. The antiviral activity of the mixtures was detected. The results revealed that chIFN-\u03b1 and chIFN-\u03b3 (at a ratio of 1:2) enhanced the maximum antiviral activity, that is 17.92 \u00b1 1.07 \u00d7 10 4 IU/mL (Table 1 ). This result indicated that an increased ratio of IFN type II caused an obvious synergistic antiviral effect of IFN type I and II.\n\nThe highly oncogenic strain RB1B of Marek's disease virus (MDV) has the ability to replicate and develop plaques in CEFs. Chicken embryo fibroblasts treated with co-or single-expression chIFNs were employed to determine the inhibitory effect on the in vitro replication of MDV. \n\nIn our previous studies, the reBmBac recombinant baculovirus construction strategy was successfully established, and recombinant porcine IFN-\u03b1 was efficiently expressed (Liu et al., 2016) . Then, IFNs from several other species were successively expressed utilizing this system.\n\nIn the present study, the coexpression of type I and II IFNs at different gene sites was successfully achieved using a single recombinant baculovirus. The type I IFN chIFN-\u03b1 gene was introduced at the polyhedron gene site. The chIFN-\u03b3 gene, a type II IFN-encoding gene, was inserted at the p10 gene site. The antiviral potential of the coexpression product was five to ten times higher than that of any single-expression product. After heat and acid treatment, the remaining IFN-\u03b1 antiviral activity of the coexpression product was approximately two times greater than that of the chIFN-\u03b1 single-expression product. This finding indicates that the expression level of IFN-\u03b1 in the reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3 product was significantly higher than that in the reBm-C\u03b1 product. ELISA results further augmented that multi-IFN expression in the coexpression product was higher than that in the single-expression product. This result was consistent with the antiviral assay. The increase in expression level is due to deletion of the p10 gene. Just like polyhedrin gene, p10 is a nonessential gene for baculovirus replication and budded virus production. And also, it is nonessential for recombinant protein expression, but with high expression level (Hitchman et al., 2010) .\n\nIn recombinant baculovirus, polyhedrin promoter is the preference for foreign gene expression. The polyhedrin gene is replaced by a foreign gene. The saved cost of polyhedrin expression provides for the recombinant protein expression. In reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3, the deletion of p10 gene can also save a certain degree of cost of gene expression, even though the p10 promoter is weaker than the polyhedrin promoter. And these saving costs could be used for foreign gene The antiviral activity of the reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3 product was approximately 5-10 times greater than that of the reBm-C\u03b1 or reBm-C\u03b3 product. After acid and heat treatment (pH 2.0, 56\u00b0C), the antiviral activity of the reBm-C\u03b1 product was almost the same as that before the treatments. The antiviral activity of the treated reBm-C\u03b3 product was negligible. The antiviral activity of the treated reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3 product was greater than that of chIFN-\u03b1. It was approximately 1.7 times greater than that of the reBm-C\u03b1 product ily. This multigene baculovirus expression system can be a potential tool in many research fields. The BES is advantageous for antibody expression (Verma, Boleti, & George, 1998) . Previously, heavy-and light-chain genes were inserted in the same gene site (Furuta et al., 2010) . Using the multigene expression strategy in the present study, heavy-and light-chain genes can be introduced into different sites in one recombinant baculovirus, and enhanced expression levels will be achieved. rAAV packaging is another application area of the BES. In preceding studies, rAAV packaging required two or three recombinant baculoviruses, which individually contained cap, rep, and target genes (Aslanidi, Lamb, & Zolotukhin, 2009; Negrete et al., 2007) . By employing our multigene expression strategy, rep, cap, and target genes can be inserted separately into the same recombinant baculovirus at the egt, p10, and polyhedron gene sites, respectively. The packaging efficiency of rAAV would thus be greater than that when using two or three recombinant baculoviruses (Galibert & Merten, 2011) . \n\nNone declared. \n\nNone required.\n\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.
