{"title": "Steroid induced osteonecrosis: An analysis of steroid dosing risk", "body": "Osteonecrosis, otherwise known as ischemic necrosis, avascular necrosis, aseptic necrosis of bone, osteochondritis dissecans or bone death results in collapse of the normal architecture of the skeletal framework, leading to significant clinical morbidity, including progressive joint pain and loss of function [1] . The most common cause of osteonecrosis is trauma, which leads to mechanical interruption of nutrient delivery to the bone, but there are many non-traumatic causes or associations as well. By far the most well known association is related to the use of corticosteroids, but other iatrogenic causes including alcoholism, radiation treatment, bisphosphonate use, and possibly even cigarette smoking, exist. Other etiologies for osteonecrosis include anatomical deformities such as Legg-Perthes-Calves disease, dislocation of a joint and slipped femoral capital epiphyses. Osteonecrosis has also been reported to occur as a result of exposure to hyperbaric conditions, and has been tenuously associated with conditions in which a lipid disorder exists, such as lipid storage diseases and even pregnancy. The list of potential causes is lengthy and beyond the scope of this article, the focus of which is to attempt to navigate the extensive literature on corticosteroid associated osteonecrosis in order to decipher trends in risk related to corticosteroid use.\n\nHarvey Cushing first recognized the adverse effects of hypercortisolism on bone tissue in the early 1930s. Since then, multiple reports of bone death have increased our awareness of the potential for the development of osteonecrosis in patients on corticosteroids [1, 2] . Steroid induced osteonecrosis has in fact been described in numerous publications, ranging from case reports to prospective studies. There is no doubt that there is a real risk of osteonecrosis with steroid use. However, it is often difficult to determine the extent of causality between steroid use and osteonecrosis because many of the conditions they are used to treat can also cause or predispose to osteonecrosis. Indeed, there appears to be a significant difference in the incidence of corticosteroid induced osteonecrosis depending on the underlying condition for which corticosteroids are administered. It is also not clear whether the risk of osteonecrosis is more closely related to cumulative dose, maximum dose or duration of therapy. Topical, inhaled and oral glucocorticoids are some of the most frequently used treatments for eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis, pulmonary diseases, autoimmune disease and other inflammatory diseases, and it is therefore vital to identify those at particular risk for complications.\n\nThe association between corticosteroid use and osteonecrosis was first described in renal transplant patients who were undergoing immunoablation or immunosuppression as part of their transplant regiment [3] . Multiple reports elucidating this connection have been published and a cause-effect relationship is now well established. Early diagnosis has proven to be problematic as the majority of patients are asymptomatic until significant damage to bone has occurred. Osteonecrosis tends to occur in a younger, more active age group and because there are limited treatment options for advanced disease, early identification is vital. Multiple treatment options have been explored for osteonecrosis. Presently, the best option for preventing complete joint replacement is the diagnosis of subjects in earlier stages before the joint becomes compromised. Again, this emphasizes the importance of identifying high-risk patients as early as possible.\n\nThe incidence of steroid induced osteonecrosis is estimated to be approximately 10,000 to 20,000 per year in the United States. Steroid induced osteonecrosis accounts for 10% or more of the 500,000 total joint replacements performed annually in the United States [4] . Approximately 75% of patients with steroid induced osteonecrosis are in their 30's to 60's, with the exception of SLE patients who make up a younger cohort [5] . The average age of steroid induced osteonecrosis is 33 and since the only treatment is surgery, these individuals will require multiple surgeries over their lifetime [6] . Male to female ratio is 7:3 with the exception of patients with underlying systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in which there is a higher female proportion. Early diagnosis is essential as prognosis and treatment options decline as the disease progresses.\n\nCorticosteroid use now falls behind only trauma as the most common etiology of osteonecrosis, with a prevalence ranging between 3 and 38% [1] . It is estimated that 30 million Americans require glucocorticoids for various conditions. The incidence of steroid induced osteonecrosis may reach 40%, depending on the duration, dose or underlying disease [6, 7] .\n\nThe most commonly affected sites of osteonecrosis include the femoral and humeral heads, but osteonecrosis can occur elsewhere as well, including knees (femoral condyles and proximal tibia) [8] , small bones of the foot, ankle, and hands (including scaphoid and lunate), vertebrae and bony structures of the face [9] . The onset of steroid induced osteonecrosis is usually insidious or vague in early stages. Symptoms may not occur for weeks to up to a year after cessation of steroid use. The pain may be referred. For example, in osteonecrosis of the femoral head, unilateral hip pain is usually the presenting symptom, but pain may also be referred to the groin, thigh, knees or buttocks. The contralateral hip will become affected within 2 years in up to 55% of cases [1] . Function may be affected as well, and many patients will present with a painful limp, which is aggravated by weight bearing and partially relieved by rest. Progression of pain is common and in advanced disease, pain is also present at rest. Range of motion and disability are progressive in the late stages, and as hip arthroplasty becomes imminent, pharmacologic intervention is of suboptimal effectiveness and is limited to analgesics. Several classification systems have been proposed to grade the severity of osteonecrosis. In the Ficat and Arlet scheme, stages 1-2 are reversible while stages 3-4 denote end stage disease with irreversible damage.\n\nMedline search of published studies with key words \"osteonecrosis\" and \"corticosteroids\" from 1961 to 2010 was conducted. From this search and their accompanying references a total of 490 studies dated from 1959 to the present were reviewed, and 396 were determined to be pertinent to our discussion. Studies consisted of animal and human studies. The \"human\" literature included case reports, reviews, prospective studies and retrospective studies.\n\nTake-home messages .\n\nManuscripts were reviewed with particular reference to the pathogenesis, clinical presentations, risk factors, and steroid dose association with osteonecrosis.\n\nIt has been reported that those at particular risk of development of osteonecrosis have received high dose, long term and long acting preparations of steroid. Similarly, cumulative dosing has also been reported as having a significant risk in pathogenesis. However, multiple studies have also reflected occurrence in those treated with short courses of high dose steroid, and more rarely, with low dose, short duration courses including inhaled and topical preparations. Animal models have helped to establish a cause and effect relationship to steroid dosing.\n\nThe pathogenesis and immunology of osteonecrosis will be discussed in subsequent articles in this series on osteonecrosis. In 2008, Motomura et al. [10] described the relationship between steroid dosing and osteonecrosis in rabbit models. Rabbits were treated with 1, 5, 20, and 40 mg/kg of methylprednisolone (MPSL), resulting in incidence of osteonecrosis of 0, 42%, 70%, and 96%, respectively. Histologically, reparative tissues around the osteonecrosis sites were observed in the rabbits with 5 mg/kg MPSL, but not observed in rabbits with 20 and 40 mg/kg MPSL. On hematological examination, hyperlipidemia and thrombocytopenia were most apparent in the rabbits receiving 40 mg/kg MPSL. Overall, this study highlights the statistically significant association of dose and osteonecrosis occurrence, and suggests that hyperlipidemia is important in its pathophysiology. Similarly, Yamamoto et al. [11] , examined the effect of pulsed doses of methylprednisolone acetate on bone and bone marrow tissue in rabbits, and observed the formation of osteonecrosis at 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks. Forty-three percent of the rabbits developed osteonecrosis in multiple sites by the fourth week after injection with 20 mg/kg of methylprednisolone. Other factors related to altered lipid metabolism also were found to be present, including fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, and intraosseous fat embolism. In 2009, Yang et al. [137] , studied mouse models of steroid induced osteonecrosis. Interestingly, the authors found discontinuous therapy was less osteonecrotic than continuous dexamethasone treatment, consistent with the possible benefits of a \"steroid holiday\" seen in clinical settings.\n\nThe case reports of corticosteroid induced osteonecrosis are presented first, followed by groupings of larger prospective, retrospective, case series, or cohort studies, which have been divided by underlying disorder. The underlying diseases with a high reported prevalence of steroid induced osteonecrosis include systemic lupus erythematosus, renal transplant, bone marrow transplant, cardiac transplant, lung transplant, liver transplant, acute lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma undergoing chemotherapy, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), multiple sclerosis, and neurosurgical patients. The majority of studies of corticosteroid induced osteonecrosis have been reported in SLE patients or renal transplant patients. In most of these and other studies, the steroid administered differs in name and in properties, such as half-life or relative strength. In order to facilitate comparison, a table outlining the difference between commonly used corticosteroids is shown in Table 1 . The relative potency relates only to drug half-life, not biologic half-life. In other words, the effect of corticosteroids may persist long after the drug has dissipated from the sera or tissues. \n\nInterpreting data from case reports must be undertaken carefully. Gleaning information regarding the effect of exact steroid dose, duration, cumulative dose-risk relationship or preparation on the development of osteonecrosis must be interpreted within the context of confounding factors within a patient. The pathogenesis of osteonecrosis is indeed likely related to a multi-hit theory in a predisposed host. In addition to the type and dosage of steroids, the underlying condition, other concurrent medications, and lifestyle variables such as alcohol and cigarette smoking are likely to be confounding variables. Furthermore, given the volume of prescriptions for intraarticular (IA), intramuscular (IM), topical, oral and inhaled steroids, low numbers of isolated case reports needs to be interpreted within the context of the individual patient's history. Finally, the sheer variety of preparations and dosing, which are potentially prescribed by multiple physicians throughout a patients' lifetime, make calculating and tallying the exact cumulative dose of steroid difficult and fraught with potential error. A list of predisposing risk factors for osteonecrosis is shown in Table 2 .\n\nIn all, 66 case reports consisting of 1 to 6 patients were identified and included in Table 3 . These patients had a wide range of diseases, including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, polycythemia, Addison's, nephrotic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, alcohol abuse, renal transplant, autoimmune inflammatory disease (SLE, MCTD, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis), malignancy (breast cancer post radiation, Hodgkin's lymphoma, bone marrow transplantation, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and bronchogenic carcinoma), asthma, allergic rhinitis, neurosurgical patients, myasthenia gravis, and pregnancy. The femoral head was the most commonly involved site, occurring in 54/85 patients, followed by the knee, humeral head and ankle. The most commonly associated administered route included intravenous (IV) pulse steroids, followed by oral, and rare reports of intramuscular depot (n = 5), topical (n = 5) intraarticular (n = 4), inhaled (n = 4), and enema (n = 1) steroid induced osteonecrosis.\n\nSingle dose steroid (IM or IA) and subsequent risk of osteonecrosis are of particular concern and were examined. This was found to be uncommon with only 2 case reports of isolated IM or IA injection and subsequent osteonecrosis [12, 13] . The remainder of reported IA/IM associated cases includes concurrent or subsequent addition of other steroid routes of administration (inhaled, oral, pulse, topical, and repeated IA/IM injections). Interpretation of case reports of osteonecrosis linked to topical steroids was limited. Of the 5 described cases, 4 were treated with long term topical preparations from 2 to 20 years with rough cumulative doses ranging widely from 1 to 15,000 mg prednisone equivalent. The majority of cases were also treated with additional preparation(s) of oral or inhaled steroids. Thus, osteonecrosis is likely to be an exceedingly rare phenomenon with topical steroids alone and is more likely to occur after prolonged therapy with cumulative doses and concurrent use of additional steroid therapy preparations. The risk of osteonecrosis from inhaled steroids is of concern given the vast number of steroid inhalers prescribed for asthma. In theory, the cumulative dose of inhaled steroid over a lifetime could add up to sizeable amounts. However, conclusions regarding steroid risk are again difficult to draw from the 4 reported cases related to inhaled steroids [14] [15] [16] [17] because all cases were concurrently or subsequently treated with oral steroids prior to the diagnosis of osteonecrosis. Though no studies have been performed, the recent unapproved but commonplace use of swallowed ultra high dose inhaled steroids (specifically fluticasone dipropionate) to treat eosinophilic esophagitis will increase the risk of osteonecrosis in these patients.\n\nThe majority of case reports involved high dose pulse steroids with dexamethasone or methylprednisolone, followed by varying durations of oral steroids on a daily or repetitive basis. The cumulative dose was described in most reports (45/66) , and ranged from 150 to 445,000 mg of prednisone equivalent (average 5969 mg prednisone). Approximately 1000 mg of oral prednisone administered within a short window will place patients at increased risk. Any addition of parenterally administered steroids, further increases this risk significantly. Parenterally administered steroids are often discussed in terms of their serum half-life but one should remember that the biologic half-life of the drug can often significantly exceed its serum half-life.\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus is a multi-organ, multisystem autoimmune disease for which steroids are an essential aspect of therapy. Steroid induced osteonecrosis in SLE is well established [18] [19] [20] and is clinically apparent in 4 to 15% of patients, but rises to nearly 40% when asymptomatic, image-proven osteonecrosis is taken into account [21] . Typically SLE patients have multi-joint onset of osteonecrosis, the hips being the most common site, followed by the knees and shoulders [22] . The goal of this amalgamation of prospective, retrospective and cohort studies is to try and establish a pattern of risk of steroid dosing and development of osteonecrosis in SLE patients. A summary of these studies is presented in Table 4 .\n\nA cushingoid appearance tends to occur with higher or longerterm dosing of steroid therapy. 5/20 studies specifically noted the correlation of cushingoid appearance and development of osteonecrosis. Mont et al. [34] , studied clinical and laboratory factors in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus to identify subgroups at higher risk for developing osteonecrosis. 31 out of 103 (30%) patients studied with SLE developed osteonecrosis and were found to have significant increases in cushingoid body habitus (74% with vs. 42% without, p = 0.002), thrombophlebitis, vasculitis, cigarette smoking, and preeclampsia. Similarly, Gladman et al. [23] , Mok et al. [24] , Massardo et al. [25] and Zizic et al. [22] found a statistically significant correlation between osteonecrosis and cushingoid appearance (OR 3.8 in Gladman study). However, osteonecrosis can exist in SLE in the absence of cushingoid features.\n\nThe dose of steroid influences the risk for developing osteonecrosis. In the studies compiled, 16/20 specifically recorded and addressed daily dosing of corticosteroid. Out of these 16 studies, 6 studies did not find a statistically significant correlation between daily steroid dosing (mean or maximal daily dosing) and the development of osteonecrosis [26, 27] . Interestingly, the majority of the negative association occurred in papers prior to 1978 [19, [28] [29] [30] . In 1960, Dubois et al. [28] was the first to recognize a connection between SLE and development of osteonecrosis. However, he did not find a relationship to steroid dosing and occurrence, probably because patients had received high doses and the study was done before MRI. Similarly, in 1974 and 1976, Bergstein et al. [19] and Smith et al. [30] , respectively, found no correlation between daily steroid dosing and osteonecrosis. In 1978, Diamant et al. [29] failed to find a correlation between peak dose, duration or cumulative dose of steroid and osteonecrosis. However, since then, only 1 further study in 2010 by Nakumura et al. [26] , echoed this negative correlation. The authors of this study concluded that there is no statistically significant difference in the highest daily dose of steroids in osteonecrosis and nonosteonecrosis groups (p= 0.072), though the p-value did approach significance. A major criticism of this study is that methylprednisolone pulse therapy was not reported or included in the data analysis and may have in turn, led to this negative conclusion. Since 1978, the evidence is clear that there is a correlation between mean daily dose, maximal daily dose or high dose steroid therapy and the development of osteonecrosis. Massardo et al. [25] , found a positive correlation with osteonecrosis and the use of prednisone doses greater than or equal to 40 mg/day. He further noted that high dose methylprednisolone therapy was also a risk factor and concluded that patients who developed osteonecrosis received a higher dose of steroid in a shorter period of time compared with those who did not develop osteonecrosis. Clearly, a lower dose of prednisone administered over a longer time would carry comparably increased risks. Statistical significance was reached with the MPSL data, but not the prednisone data. Ono et al. [31] , found that both IV MPSL pulse therapy and prednisone N 30 mg/day for at least a month were risk factors for osteonecrosis. Zonana-Nacach et al. [32] also demonstrated that the risk of osteonecrosis significantly increased with exposure to high dose oral prednisone. He found that each 2 months of exposure to N60 mg prednisone was associated with a 1.2 fold increased risk for development of osteonecrosis. In the meta-analysis by Felson et al. [21] , there was a positive relationship between oral prednisone dose when evaluated at time intervals of 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and the subsequent development of osteonecrosis. The authors suggested that steroid dose is the major factor in predicting the risk of osteonecrosis. The oral dose effect amounts to a 4.6% increase in the risk of AVN for every 10 mg/day rise in oral steroids during the first 6 months of therapy. Interestingly, they found no association if only a single bolus dose of steroids was used. In 2000, Oinuma et al. [27] , found that osteonecrosis development occurred after high dose corticosteroid treatment, but was not related to highest daily dose. Migliaresi et al. [33] did not find an increase in osteonecrosis in methylprednisolone treated patients, even though they accumulated the highest dose. Mont et al. [34] found that SLE patients with osteonecrosis received higher maximal prednisone doses than those without osteonecrosis. Uea-areewongsa et al. [35] found that the use of steroids (recorded as maximum and mean daily dosing) were significantly higher in the osteonecrosis group compared to control. Gladman et al. [36] concluded that osteonecrosis was significantly associated with the use of steroid (OR = 19), and correlated with the maximal dose of steroids per day (OR = 1.02). In a multivariate analysis, only the use of steroids was statistically significant. Finally, the mean daily dose of prednisone for the highest month of therapy was N40 mg/day in 93% and N20 mg/day in 100% of patients who developed osteonecrosis [22] . The mean daily prednisone dose for the highest single month of treatment, as well as, the maximal dose during consecutive 3, 6, 12 months of therapy was significantly higher in patients with osteonecrosis [22] . This study reflects that higher daily dosing has a positive correlation to osteonecrosis development.\n\nThe correlation of higher cumulative dose and development of osteonecrosis has also been studied. In all, 13/20 SLE studies commented on cumulative dosing. Out of these 13 studies, 5 studies did not find an association with cumulative dosing [20, 21, [36] [37] [38] [39] , while 8 studies did [19] [20] [21] 25, 36, 37, 39, 40] . With regard to positive correlation, Mok et al. [20] identified 38/143 subjects with osteonecrosis and found that the cumulative dose at 1 and 4 months was significantly higher in the SLE patients with osteonecrosis vs. without osteonecrosis (1.8 vs. 1.1 at 1 month and 4.5 vs. 2.8 g prednisone at 4 months). Jaovisidha et al. [37] found that the 2 patients who developed osteonecrosis had the longest duration of corticosteroid treatment and higher cumulative dose compared to the patients who did not develop osteonecrosis, but this was a small cohort of patients and limited conclusions can thus be drawn from it. In a retrospective, case control series, Gladman et al. [23] identified 95 patients with osteonecrosis out of a total of 744 SLE patients. Data analysis determined a minimally positive odds ratio of 1.04 for cumulative dose, which did not reach statistical significance. Weiner et al. [39] , found that corticosteroid intake during the first 1.5 years after diagnosis of SLE and during the third year after diagnosis of SLE was significantly greater in the osteonecrosis vs. non-osteonecrosis group. Felson et al. [21] , was the only metanalysis available and looked at 22 different studies with underlying disorders including renal transplant, SLE, BMT, and Hodgkin's disease. Limited conclusions can be deduced with respect to SLE and steroid dose as only 3/22 studies looked at an SLE cohort. When Felson et al. [21] , compared steroid dose and bolus steroids, they calculated that a 9 g prednisone equivalent cumulative dosing given in a month had a 22% incidence of osteonecrosis. Further discussion of this paper will be included in subsequent sections as it applies. Massardo et al. [25] noted a positive correlation with osteonecrosis when patients were treated with a cumulative dose of \u2265 12 g/year. Finally Bergstein et al. [19] , similarly found a positive correlation with cumulative dosing. Overall, the data indicates a correlation between higher cumulative dosing and increased risk for osteonecrosis.\n\nIt is in renal transplant patients that the association of corticosteroid induced osteonecrosis was first described [3] . Those with years of chronic renal failure and osteodystrophy are particularly prone to steroid induced osteonecrosis. Between 3 and 40% of renal transplant patients suffer from osteonecrosis, but fortunately there has been a decrease in the prevalence with improvement in dialysis maintenance care. There have been numerous studies examining the relationship between steroid use in transplant patients and the development of osteonecrosis. Of particular interest is the relationship between daily dosing, high dose pulse therapy, cumulative dose and the risk of osteonecrosis. 24 pertinent studies were reviewed and are outlined in Table 5 .\n\n18/24 studies selected looked directly at daily steroid dosing as a potential risk factor of osteonecrosis. 5/18 found no statistically significant relationship to osteonecrosis risk [41] [42] [43] [44] . Interestingly, as seen with the SLE studies, the negative relationship, was only found in studies that were greater than 25 years old. Since then, there has been repeated and dramatic evidence of a dosing relationship to risk. In 2008, Shibatani et al. [45] , performed a retrospective analysis of 150 renal transplant patients, 37 of whom developed osteonecrosis. The authors found a statistically significant dose-response association at 8 weeks after transplantation. Considerable correlation with cumulative dose was found as will be described in the next section. The finding of significantly higher daily dose and risk was echoed in multiple studies [21, [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . Koo et al. [7] , found that high dose steroid during the first several weeks was more important that total cumulative dose. Patton et al. [49] , noted that the mean linear trend of higher daily prednisone dose was also statistically significant (p b 0.03) for the development of osteonecrosis. In contrast to the SLE data, the majority of studies (17 of 22) in the Felson metanalysis were renal transplant studies. Overall, the general consensus among these studies is that a higher daily dose confers a significant risk for developing osteonecrosis. Unfortunately, due to the variation among studies, a recommendation for a universally \"safe\" steroid dose cannot be made and in all situations, physicians should exercise caution in using steroids and provide appropriate informed consent. Higher incidence with increased daily and cumulative dose of steroid The incidence of femoral head AVN was more than halved with reduction of cumulative steroid from 12 g to 6.5 g (continued on next page) \n\nIn renal transplant patients, the cumulative dose is of special interest as it takes into account the number of renal transplant rejections and the subsequent administration of high dose pulse therapy. Patton et al. [49] , Tang et al. [46] , Hedri et al. [51] , and De Graaf et al. [52] all noted a statistically significant association between acute rejection and the onset of osteonecrosis. In 1992, Tervoven et al. [47] found no statistically significant difference regarding total dose of glucocorticoids, but noted a trend towards higher cumulative dose and occurrence. In fact, prior to 1985, Metselaar et al. [50] , Potter et al. [121] , Levine et al. [42] , and BewickTroche et al. [43] also reported no predictive correlation between cumulative dose and osteonecrosis but again this data must be tempered by the methodology used.\n\nMore recently, Shibatani [45] found a statistically significant association between osteonecrosis and the total dose of steroids in the first 2 months after transplantation. Hedri et al. (p = 0.04) [51] , Lausten et al. [48] , Felson et al. [21] , Morris et al. [55] , De Graff et al. [52] , Pierrides et al. [44] , and Harrington et al. [133] all found similar risk with increased cumulative dose. Several authors demonstrated evidence for increased risk when specifically considering cumulative IV methylprednisolone [21, 46, [53] [54] [55] . Lausten et al. [48] , calculated that the incidence of femoral head osteonecrosis was more than halved with reduction of the cumulative steroid from 12 g to 6.5 g. De Graff et al. [52] , found that a cumulative dose greater than 5000 mg during the first 3 months was a striking risk. Bradbury et al. [53] found a similar association between steroids used during the first year and subsequent risk of osteonecrosis. In 2002, Koo et al. [7] , noted that daily oral dosing was more important than cumulative dose. In summary, the majority of the data on renal transplantinduced osteonecrosis indicates a positive role on cumulative dose and osteonecrosis development. Multiple confounding variables are at play here (i.e. active inflammation during rejection may predispose to osteonecrosis, MPSL vs. oral cumulative dosages may confer different risks).\n\nThe risk of steroid induced osteonecrosis in bone marrow transplant, cardiac transplant, lung transplant, liver transplant, acute leukocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma undergoing chemotherapy, SARS, multiple sclerosis, and neurosurgical patients is noted in Table 6 . This third grouping of studies consists of non-renal transplant patients (bone marrow transplant, n = 6; liver transplant, n = 2; cardiac/pulmonary transplant, n = 2), malignancy (Hodgkin's, n = 3; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, n = 9, multiple myeloma, n = 1), aplastic anemia (n = 3), SARS (n = 2), and neurosurgical disorders (n = 2). Organ transplantation inevitably requires steroids for rejection prevention and subsequent osteonecrosis has been a rare, albeit, well-documented phenomenon found throughout the literature. In cardiac and liver transplant, an incidence of 2-3% is suggested by several authors [53, 56, 57] . This is much lower than the incidence reported in renal transplant patients (3-40%) suggesting again that underlying disease has a distinct influence on the incidence of steroid induced osteonecrosis. Fortunately over the last 10 years, alternative immunosuppressants have been increasingly employed, thereby decreasing the overall need for steroids. Regarding neurosurgical patients, steroids have shown to be beneficial in cerebral edema, malignancy, meningitis, cord injury, among others and short courses of high dose corticosteroid (often dexamethasone) are usually employed. The overall incidence of 0 to 0.6% extracted from the scattered case reports and small studies is considerably lower than the other underlying diseases discussed thus far [58, 59] . With regard to underlying malignancy and steroid induced osteonecrosis, the incidence varies widely between 0.6 and 3.4% [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . It is difficult to make generalized statements regarding steroid dosing with these varied underlying disorders, but patterns are evident.\n\nIn 2 studies of cardiac and liver transplant, Lieberman et al. [56, 57] , found no statistically significant relationship between daily prednisone dosing or IV MPSL and osteonecrosis. The cumulative dosing was also not statistically different. In 2002, Koo et al. [7] , suggested that high dose steroids during the first several weeks seems to be more important that the cumulative dose. The major limitation here is that there was only 1 patient out of 22 that had a solid organ transplant (aside from renal). In 1994, Bradbury et al. [53] performed a retrospective study and found 3% of cardiac/pulmonary transplant patients developed osteonecrosis. The author demonstrated a correlation between cumulative dosing of IV MPSL in the first 1 month after transplant and the onset of osteonecrosis (p= 0.005). In summary, there is no significant data to make concrete statements regarding dosing relationship to osteonecrosis in solid organ transplant, though clearly there seems to be a trend towards higher daily and cumulative dose.\n\nTalamo et al. [60] , found an osteonecrosis incidence of 9% in patients with multiple myeloma treated with antineoplastic therapy including steroids. When he adjusted for body weight, cumulative dose remained significantly associated with osteonecrosis (OR, 1.030; 95% CI, 1.005-1.055, p = 0.02). A logistic analysis further predicted that a cumulative dexamethasone dose of 2880 mg had a 20% chance of inducing osteonecrosis which was a 4.2-fold higher probability than a patient treated with a cumulative dexamethasone dose of 800 mg. In acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients, Arico et al. [61] , found that there was an increased incidence of osteonecrosis with chemotherapy regiments where the cumulative dose was higher. Mattano et al. [63] , studied a pediatric ALL population and found a 1.4fold increase in osteonecrosis in patients treated with 2 dexamethasone pulses as compared to those that received just one. However, the results did not reach statistical significance. Vaidya et al. [67] , also agreed that the high cumulative doses of steroid were noted to have an increased risk of osteonecrosis in acute lymphocytic leukemia patients. In a small cohort of acute lymphocytic leukemia patients, Chan-Lam et al. [72] reported 5/9 patients with osteonecrosis, which he proposes may be explained by their protocol of higher dose steroids (1.5-1.75\u00d7 greater than in convention chemotherapy). Several other studies state that steroids play a role in osteonecrosis development [64, 68, 74] .\n\nIn the 5 bone marrow transplant papers, steroid dosing, including higher cumulative dose, was a significant risk factor for development of osteonecrosis. In a multivariate analysis, Socie et al. [69] , found 5 factors conferring statistically significant risk of osteonecrosis development. These factors include chronic GvHD (OR 3.52), acute GvHD (OR 3.73), age b 16 (OR 5.81), aplastic anemia (OR 3.90), and acute leukemia (OR 1.72.) The exact steroid dosage was not addressed, but patients having complications and who are treated with corticosteroids, are at increased risk for osteonecrosis. Enright et al. [73] and Torri et al. [62] echoed these assertions, also finding an increased risk with acute or chronic graft vs. host disease, higher cumulative steroid dose, or use of intravenous (IV) pulse therapy.\n\nThe incidence of osteonecrosis in neurosurgical patients was lower than those with other underlying diseases. This suggests that the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis involves a \"multi-hit\" theory, which The relatively high incidence of AVN in our series could be explained by the dose of corticosteroids used in the BFM protocol which is 1.5-1.75\u00d7 greater than the doses used in conventional chemotherapy schedules like the MRC ALL \u00d7 protocol. Three out of the four patients who did not develop clinical AVN did not receive the late intensification block which contains high dose dexamethasone and this would further support the role of high doses of steroids in causing AVN.\n\n(continued on next page) [58, 59] , both authors recognize steroids as a risk factor that should be carefully minimized in duration and dose. However, neither found statistically significant association with daily or cumulative dose. Felson et al., also included 1 neurosurgical study out of the 22 others examined.\n\nIn a study of SARS patients, Chan et al. [75] , concluded that cumulative doses of N2000 mg of MPSL and duration of therapy N 18 days were statistically significant risk factors for development of osteonecrosis. Li et al. [135] , also concurred that high cumulative dosing and long duration of therapy conferred the highest risk. With regard to aplastic anemia, Marsh et al. [76] found that osteonecrosis only occurred in the high steroid dose group (5 mg/kg/day vs. 1 mg/kg/day of MPSL).\n\nThe risk of corticosteroids on the development of osteonecrosis is dependent on daily dose, cumulative dose, maximum dose and route of administration, as well as underlying disease states. In addition, there are genetic factors that have not yet been identified. Parenteral or oral steroids are more likely to lead to osteonecrosis. The highest daily dose, or, to a lesser extent, cumulative dose is directly correlated with the risk of developing osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis is rare in patients who are on very short course, low dose protocols. Topical and inhaled steroids have been reported to be associated with osteonecrosis, but these cases were confounded by the use of oral or parenteral steroids as well. No cases of osteonecrosis were found that were associated with the use of topical or inhaled steroids alone. Unfortunately, only the minority of affected cases are ever reported.\n\nDue to the absence of subjective and objective findings in the initial phases of the disease, early diagnosis of osteonecrosis depends on the ability of the physician to maintain a high index of suspicion. Once symptoms have presented, the disease may have already progressed to phases of irreversible damage. Treatment in these later stages of the disease is suboptimal and invariably involves surgical procedures, including total hip replacement.\n\nCurrently there are no guidelines that define a safe threshold dose of steroids. This paper attempts to establish some recommendations for the administration of steroids. In many cases, the use of steroids is unavoidable, but knowing the likelihood of developing osteonecrosis as a complication of steroid use may help in early detection of the condition.\n\nThe risk of osteonecrosis from corticosteroids remains a significant cause of morbidity. Physicians should be aware of this risk and patients should be informed consumers when corticosteroids are prescribed. Indeed, we suggest the following recommendations:\n\n1. Health care providers should be aware of the potential risk for osteonecrosis in patients treated with corticosteroids, especially parenteral or oral preparations, and with certain specific underlying disease states. 2. Patients who receive steroids via other routes, such as IA, inhaled or intranasal, have a low but not zero risk of developing osteonecrosis. There is the potential for developing osteonecrosis when high doses of inhaled corticosteroids are used, such as in severe persistent asthma or eosinophilic esophagitis. 3. Patients should always be informed of the risk of developing osteonecrosis whenever steroids are used.\n\nA more complete understanding of the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis may help us establish more precise guidelines in the future. Until then, the use of a \"therapeutic checklist\", such as that proposed by Weldon et al. [77] , may be a useful means of identifying those patients at particular risk and minimizing, whenever able, the use of steroids at every decision crossroad.\n\n\u2022 Corticosteroids remain a life-saving medication but do carry risk factors, including potential development of osteonecrosis. \u2022 Patients with autoimmune disease have themselves an increased risk of osteonecrosis but carry an increased burden secondary to the use of corticosteroids. \u2022 Physicians should be aware of this complication as earlier diagnosis may lead to a significantly improved outcome. \u2022 The risk of development of osteonecrosis is both dose and duration dependent but there are clearly individual differences that explain different patient susceptibility to development of this complication."}
