The five major themes explored during the interviews included: core competencies, product portfolios and pipelines; capabilities along the product development value chain; alliances and partnerships; barriers and incentives for development; and financial issues. In addition to the primary interviews, data was also collected from relevant documents and company websites. Companies were asked to fact-check the data presented in the tables and boxes prior to publication to ensure the information was up-to-date and accurate. This study was approved by the research ethics board of the University of Toronto."}
