{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Process Characterization and Biophysical Analysis for a Yeast-expressed Phlebotomus papatasi Salivary Protein (PpSP15) as a Leishmania vaccine candidate", "body": "Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania and 45 transmitted to humans by phlebotomine sandflies. There are approximately 2 million new cases each year 1 and 46 70,000 annual deaths from leishmaniasis, 2 and in addition, the infection accrues 3.3 million disability-adjusted life 47 years (DALYs) annually. 1 Alarmingly, approximately 350 million people living in endemic areas are at risk. 48\n\nCutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common manifestation, with the highest prevalence reported in 49\n\nAfghanistan, Iran, Syria, Algeria, Brazil, and Colombia. 3 Some of the highest rates of CL now occur in areas of 50 political unrest and conflict. 4 Lesions caused by CL can leave severe, disfiguring scars often causing social 51 stigmatization. 5 Indeed, emerging evidence indicates that up to 40 million people may be affected by the chronic 52 scarring of CL, 6 of whom a significant percentage suffer co-morbid depression and other psychiatric sequelae. 7 Therefore, current global burden of disease estimates likely fail to capture the full range of human disease and its 54 humanitarian impact. 55\n\nIn order to obtain blood meals, sandflies inject salivary proteins to counteract hemostasis. 8 During this 56 process, parasites, if present, are transmitted to the human host. Some of these salivary proteins are immunogenic 57 in humans, canids, and mice. 9-12 Repeated exposure to sandfly salivary gland homogenate or sandfly bites has 58 been shown the cause delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to salivary components, which has been shown to 59\n\nHowever, PpSP15 formed inclusion bodies in bacteria. Thus, an expression platform using Pichia pastoris X33 80 was investigated. 81\n\nIn this study, we developed a production process to express and purify tag-free recombinant PpSP15 in 82 yeast (P. pastoris), which included improving the fermentation yield and developing a scalable purification 83 scheme. At the conclusion of these studies, the fermentation yield was improved from 779 mg PpSP15 per liter of 84 fermentation supernatant (FS) to 994 mg, an improvement of 27.6%. The purification process is comprised of 85 only two chromatography steps, ion-exchange chromatography (IEX) using SP Sepharose XL resin (SPXL) and 86 hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) with Phenyl Sepharose 6 Fast Flow high sub resin (PS6FF). The 87 dynamic binding capacities for IEX and HIC were determined as 52 mg/mL and 15 mg/mL, respectively. This 88 purification process increased PpSP15 purity from 64.6% to 97.2%. 89\n\nSubsequently, biophysical and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the protein was not only highly 90 pure (>97%) and monomeric, but also maintained a well-defined secondary structure (approximately 63% alpha-91 helix) and tertiary structures similar to that of the related P. duboscqii PdSP15, suggesting the correct folding of 92\n\nPpSP15. pH screening using thermal shift assay also suggested that PpSP15 was stable between pH 4.4 and pH 93 9.0. Collectively, the data from the process characterization and biophysical and biochemical protein 94 characterization indicate that this process is thus ready for upscaling and reproducibility analysis. The material 95 generated from the scaled-up process will be further assessed for long-term stability and stability under stress. 96\n\nThe recombinant expression vector pPICZ\u03b1A containing the DNA sequence encoding PpSP15 (NCBI protein_id 100 = \"AAL11047.1\", GenBank ID: AF335487.1) 20 was first purchased from GenScript (New Jersy, USA), followed 101 by electroporation into P. pastoris X33. Transformants were selected for three days at 30\u00b0C on YPD plates with 102 either 100 or 500 \u00b5g/ml Zeocin. Thirteen colonies from each transformation were selected for small-scale (10 mL) 103 expression in BMGY/BMMY medium, with induction with 0.5% methanol per day at 30\u00b0C for three days. The 104 clone with the highest expression was chosen for generating a research seed stock.\n\nOne milliliter of seed stock was inoculated into 1 L BMG (buffered minimal glycerol) medium and the culture 108 was incubated overnight at 30\u00b0C with constant shaking at 250 rpm until an OD 600 of 9.6 was reached. 109\n\nApproximately 180 ml overnight culture were inoculated into 4 L sterile BSM (basal salts medium; containing 110 26.7 mL 85% phosphoric acid, 0.93 g CaSO 4 .2H 2 O, 18.2 g K 2 SO 4 , 14.9 g MgSO 4 .7H 2 O, 4.13 g KOH, 30 g 111 glycerol, 4.35 ml PTM1 Trace Elements, 4.35 ml 0.02% d-Biotin and 1 mL antifoam per liter) to reach to an 112 initial OD 600 of 0.4. The yeast cells were expanded overnight in batch mode at 30\u00b0C and pH 5 and then, upon 113 glycerol depletion, the glycerol fed-batch phase was initiated at 15 ml/L/hr of 50% glycerol for 5 hours. During 114 the last hour of the glycerol fed-batch phase, the temperature was reduced from 30 to 26\u00b0C and the pH was 115 increased from 5.0 to 5.2. For the induction phase, methanol supply was ramped from 1-12 ml/L/hr over an 8-116 hour period followed by maintenance at 12 ml/L/hr for 21 hours. After that, methanol supply was increased from 117 12-14 ml/L/hr over a 4-hour period followed by maintenance at 14 ml/L/hr until the end of the fermentation 118 process. The total induction time was approximately 72 hours. During the fermentation process, samples were 119 collected at different time points. The fermentation supernatant (FS) was harvested by centrifugation and kept at -120 80\u2070C for later processing. This optimized process was compared with the original process and the major process 121 differences are described in Supplementary Table S1 . 122 123\n\nTwo liters of FS were thawed and filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter. The filtered FS was further concentrated to 125 approximately 650 mL and buffer exchanged against 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6 using a 0.11 m 2 3 126 kDa cutoff Pellicon 3 Ultracel cassette from Millipore (Burlington, MA, USA) until the conductivity equaled that 127 of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6 (~ 9.01 ms/cm); the processed material at this step was denoted as 128 the TFF pool. 129\n\nSince the theoretical pI of PpSP15 is approximately 9.1, cation exchange chromatography using SPXL resin was 130 chosen as the capture step. To determine the binding capacity of the SPXL resin, the TFF pool was loaded onto a 29 mL SP XL column packed in-house (Bed Height (BH) 14.5 cm x ID 1.6 cm) at 149.3 cm/hr with a residence 132 time of 5.8 minutes, until a breakthrough was observed; the column was then washed with 5 column volumes (CV) 133 of binding buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6). A step elution with 30% of elution buffer (100% 134 elution buffer contains 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, 1 M NaCl, pH 6) over 5 CVs was applied to elute 135 the target protein, and this collected fraction was denoted as our SPXL pool. A gradient elution from 30-100% 136 elution buffer over 5 CVs then removed host cell proteins (HCP) and other impurities from the column. 137\n\nAn additional polishing step with Phenyl Sepharose 6 Fast Flow high sub resin (PS6FF) was used to remove the 138 remaining impurities. Two hundred mL of SPXL pool were retrieved and mixed with ammonium sulfate until the 139 molarity of ammonium sulfate reached 2 M. Similarly, to study the binding capacity of the PS6FF resin, the 140 SPXL pool with 2 M ammonium sulfate was then loaded onto a 5 mL HiTrap PS6FF column (BH 2.5 cm x ID 1.6 141 cm; GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 25.6 cm/hr with a residence time of 5.8 minutes. The column was washed 142 with 10 CVs of binding buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, 2 M ammonium sulfate, pH 6) to remove 143 any loosely bound protein. A step elution with 50% of elution buffer (100% elution buffer contains 100 mM 144 potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6) over 10 CVs was applied to elute the target protein, and this collected fraction 145 was denoted the PS6FF pool. Followed by a second step elution of 100% elution buffer over 10 CVs, the 146 remaining impurities were removed from the column. The collected PS6FF pool was further buffer-exchanged by 147 dialysis against 1X PBS, pH 7.4 or other buffers, as needed. 148\n\nOnce the binding capacity had been established, the recovery of each step was determined by not overloading the 149 column to prevent any loss of target protein in the flow-through. For analysis, the in-process samples and purified PpSP15 were loaded on 14% Tris-glycine or 12% Bis-tris gels, 154 and subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue or silver, as described previously, 27 or transferred to PVDF 155 membranes and analyzed by Western blot using in-house mouse anti-PpSP15 antisera (1: 2,000 dilution), or anti-156 with PpSP15 were then extracted, digested by trypsin and analyzed by mass spectrometry at Yale/NHLBI 158 Proteomics Center to confirm the identity for each band. were obtained from 260 to 190 nm with a Jasco J-1500s spectrophotometer set at 100 nm/min and a response time 179 of 1 sec at 25\u00b0C. The obtained CD data were analyzed using CDPro software by comparing to the reference set 180 SDP48 using two data fitting programs (CONTIN and CDSSTR). In addition, the sample was heated from 25\u00b0C 181 to 90\u00b0C to analyze the thermal stability of its secondary structure. 182 pH screening by thermal shift assay 184\n\nPurified PpSP15 was diluted and buffer-exchanged to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 150 mM sodium 185 citrate at different pH-values ranging from 3.1 to 6.0, in citrate-phosphate buffer 28 at pH-values ranging from 7.2 186 to 8.0 and 160 mM sodium borate at pH 9. Deionized water was included as a negative control. A protein thermal 187\n\nshift assay was then performed by heating the sample from 25\u00b0C to 99\u00b0C and monitoring the fluorescence Purification process characterization. During purification, in-process samples were used to characterize protein 202 purity (Figure 1 and Table 1 ). The binding capacity of each chromatographic step was also determined, as this 203 information will facilitate upscaling the process. The low purity of PpSP15 (64.6%) in the FS as determined by 204 densitometry (Figure 1b and Table 1 ) was likely due to heavy contamination with host cell impurities or 205 degraded PpSP15 (Figure 1a, lane 1) . To purify PpSP15 more efficiently, the FS was first filtered through a 0.45 206 \u00b5m filter and then concentrated 3-fold by tangential flow filtration (TFF; Figure 1a , lane 2) in order to reduce the 207 volume and thus processing time. Due to the high theoretical pI of PpSP15 (pI = 9.1), cation exchange 208 chromatography was chosen, and thus, the concentrated FS was further buffer exchanged using the same filtration device. It is noted that only 3.3 to 4 diavolumes were required to reduce the sample conductivity to the level of 210 binding buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6), and 95% of the protein was recovered. After buffer 211 exchange, the FS was loaded onto a cation exchange column (IEX) made from SPXL resin. The binding capacity 212 was determined as 52 mg/mL SPXL at a flow rate of 149.3 cm/hr on a column with a BH of 14.5 cm. In the IEX 213 step, 92% of PpSP15 was recovered from the TFF step; the purity of PpSP15 in the SPXL pool increased to 214 93.4%, suggesting that most of the impurities, i.e., host cell proteins, were removed (Figure 1a, lane 3) . The 215 conductivity of the SPXL pool was then adjusted to ~ 200 ms/cm by adding ammonium sulfate to 2 M and the 216 sample was loaded onto a HIC column containing Phenyl Sepharose 6 Fast Flow High Sub (PS6FF) to remove 217 small impurities from 3 to 14 kDa (Figure 1a, lane 4) . It is noted that even though approximately 486 mg of 218\n\nPpSP15 were bound to the column during loading, it did not bind very tightly to this column and approximately 219 411 mg was being eluted during the wash step, leaving only 75 mg being eluted at the elution step 220 (Supplementary Figures S2a and S2b) . When SPXL pool containing only 75 mg of PpSP15 was loaded, no or 221 very little of PpSP15 was observed in the wash step (Supplementary Figure S2c) . Thus, binding capacity was 222 reported as remaining PpSP15 after the wash step per unit volume of PS6FF resin, i.e., 75 mg/5 mL PS6FF resin 223 or 15 mg/mL PS6FF at a flow rate of 25.6 cm/hr with a residence time of 5.8 minutes. After the PS6FF run, the 224 purity of the product increased to 97.2%, and 91% of target protein was recovered from the IEX step, which led to 225 a high overall process recovery rate of 79%. Bis-tris gel (Supplementary Figure S3) . However, when more than 2 \u00b5g were loaded, a faint band at 233 approximately 4.5-5 kDa was observed under reduced conditions and a light smear at approximately 6-14 kDa 234 under non-reduced conditions. The two distinct bands observed on the overloaded gel (Supplementary Figure S3) were recovered, trypsin-digested and analyzed by proteomic mass spectrometry. The results indicated that the 236 17 kDa protein band contained 99.9% PpSP15 while the 4.5 kDa band contained approximately 52.5% of 237 degraded PpSP15 and 47.5% of HCP (Table S2) . On the silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel, a similar profile was 238 obtained: when more than one \u00b5g of purified PpSP15 was loaded, small molecular weight impurities were 239 observed (Figure 2b ), but no aggregation or dimer formation was observed. DLS indicated the size of PpSP15 240 was approximately 17 kDa, which was consistent with the data shown by SDS-PAGE. The low polydispersity (< 241 8%) further indicated that the protein was monodispersed (Figure 2c ). To further assess the level of any potential 242 aggregation, SE-HPLC was also employed. The results (Figure 2d ) indicated that PpSP15 eluted as a single peak 243 at 20.8 minutes, slightly later than the retention time of the 17kDa protein standard (20.0 minutes) from a well-244 resolved Bio-Rad gel filtration standard, suggesting the size of PpSP15 was likely slightly less than 17kDa. No 245 detectable peak eluted prior to 20.8 minutes again demonstrated that PpSP15 was likely not aggregated. 246\n\nThe identity and purity of the sample were also evaluated using Western blotting with PpSP15-specific polyclonal 248 antiserum (Figure 3a) or P. pastoris X33 HCP-specific antibodies ( Figure 3b ). The PpSP15 antisera were able to 249 recognize the protein band at approximately 16 kDa, thus confirming the identity as PpSP15, of which the 250 theoretical molecular weight was 14.75 kDa. However, the proteomic mass spectrometric data indicated that small 251 molecular weight impurities containing degraded PpSP15 and HCPs were present and that these were not 252 recognized by either PpSP15-specific antisera or P. pastoris X33 HCP specific antibodies, suggesting that the 253 impurities could be low in quantity and required a higher concentration of detection antibodies or that they were 254 not antigenic. 255 256 Structure Assessment using Circular Dichroism. Far-UV Circular dichroism (CD) was performed to investigate 257 the secondary structure of PpSP15. The result indicates that the yeast expressed PpSP15 was rich in alpha-helices 258 (62.6% alpha-helix, 7.5% beta-sheet and 12.7% turn/loop) (Figure 4a) . The thermal stability of its secondary 259 structure was evaluated by heating the sample from 25\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C (Figures 4b, 4c, and 4d ) and the CD melting 260 curves were further extracted at 197 nm, 210 nm and 220 nm (Figures 4c and 4d) since these wavelengths showed the best signal to noise data. Based on the derivative, the onset of structural changes begins at 262 approximately 40\u00b0C (T on1 ) and the average melting temperature (T m1 ) was found to be 55\u00b0C for all three 263 wavelengths (Figures 4c and 4d) . 264 265 Buffer screening using thermal shift assay. pH screening (ranging from pH 3.1 to pH 9.0) for PpSP15 was 266 performed by evaluating the thermal stability of its tertiary structure using thermal shift assays (Figure 5) . Based 267 on the derivative (Figure 5b) , the onset temperature T on for PpSP15 at pH 3.1 could not be determined as it was 268 lower than 25 \u00b0C and the melting temperature T m was approximately 49 \u00b0C, suggesting PpSP15 may denature at 269 room temperature at this pH. When pH increased to between 4.4 and 9.0, T on increased to approximately 45\u00b0C. 270\n\nWithin this pH range, a consistent T m between 61-65\u00b0C was also observed (Figures 5b and 5c) . Interestingly, at 271 pH 3.7, two melting temperatures were detected: with T m1 , 52 \u00b0C, close to T m at pH 3.1, while T m2 , 61 \u00b0C, close to 272 T m at higher pH (Figures 5b and 5c) , suggesting that PpSP15 might either be in a metastable state at pH 3.7 or 273 that it had partially lost its thermal stability; hence, closer monitoring of the protein's tertiary stability overtime at 274 pH 3.7 needs to be considered. Nevertheless, the data suggested that to maintain the tertiary structure stability of 275\n\nPpSP15, a buffer system with a pH between 4.4 to 9.0 should be employed. In previous preclinical studies, a DNA vector encoding PpSP15 and a non-pathogenic L. tarentolae secreting 280\n\nPpSP15 were used to demonstrate protection against L. major infection in mice, [20] [21] [22] suggesting PpSP15 as a 281 promising vaccine candidate against leishmaniasis. In this study, we have generated a recombinant P. pastoris 282 X33 construct for recombinant PpSP15 protein production, developed and optimized an upstream process at the 283 10 L scale and developed a scalable downstream process consisting of IEX and HIC chromatographic steps. The 284 purified PpSP15 was characterized by various biochemical and biophysical assays, and a more suitable pH range 285 to stabilize PpSP15 was determined. Currently, this yeast-expressed recombinant PpSP15 protein is being 286 evaluated for immunogenicity and efficacy against Leishmania infection.\n\nDuring molecular cloning, the E. coli expression platform was first investigated, yet unable to produce soluble 288\n\nPpSP15. Thus, a recombinant yeast construct for the development and optimization of the upstream fermentation 289 process was generated. The optimized process added a glycerol fed-batch step after the initial depletion of the 290 glycerol in the BSM medium, increasing cell density prior to induction. This additional step increased overall 291 protein yield by 27.6%. 292\n\nWith respect to the downstream process development, due to a high protein pI (9.1), cation exchange 293 chromatography was logically selected as the capture step. First, the conductivity of FS was lowered by 294 diafiltration. In order to reduce processing time, a 10 kDa cutoff Pellicon \u00ae 3 cassette was being tested, however, 295\n\nPpSP15 was found to permeate through the cassette, and thus, a 3 kDa cutoff Pellicon \u00ae 3 cassette was selected. 296\n\nHowever, instead of direct diafiltration, the FS was first concentrated 3-fold in order to (1) reduce the processing 297 time required for diafiltration and cation exchange chromatography and (2) lower the volume of buffer required 298 for diafiltration. PpSP15 in this concentrated and buffer-exchanged FS was further purified with a 14.5 cm BH 299 IEX column at a flow rate of 149.3 cm/hr using a step elution at 30% elution buffer. An additional elution step 300 with a linear gradient from 30% to 100% elution buffer was applied to remove the bound host cell protein in the 301 column after the target protein had been recovered. However, since gradient elution is undesirable in large-scale 302 production, we plan to replace this step with a step elution with 100% elution buffer in future scale-up 303 experiments. After the IEX step, it was noticed that approximately 7% of low molecular weight impurities were 304 still present, and these impurities were further removed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). 305\n\nDuring the first few trials of HIC, butyl Sepharose High-Performance resin was tested, but it did not show enough 306 binding affinity to PpSP15. Hence, a stronger HIC resin, Phenyl Sepharose 6 Fast Flow high sub (PS6FF), was 307 chosen. By using PS6FF resin, impurities were reduced by an additional 3% and the purity of PpSP15 reached > 308 97%. It was noted that typically the BH should be maintained while upscaling; however, the PS6FF column used 309 during this development phase had a BH of 2.5 cm, and hence scaling up was not practical and required 310 optimization. For future studies to scale up the process, we intend to pack a column with a BH between 10 and 20 311\n\ncm and maintain the current residence time of 5.8 minutes in order to keep the binding capacity similar. Based on 312 the binding capacity of PpSP15 to SPXL resin (52 mg/mL) and PS6FF resin (15 mg/mL), the minimal column volumes of both resins to purify this antigen and the estimated amount of purified antigen were calculated 314 (Supplementary Table S3 ). For a typical 10 L fermentation process, approximately 4.5 L of FS is obtained. With 315 the initial yield of 994 mg of PpSP15/L of FS, it will require an SPXL column with a CV of more than 86 mL and 316 a PS6FF column with a CV of more than 260 mL to capture all the PpSP15 during purification. With 79% of high 317 overall recovery, we expect to collect approximately 785 mg of purified PpSP15 per litter of FS. When comparing 318 with the purification process for several other reported recombinant protein vaccine antigens at similar 319 fermentation scale 24,27,29-32 , one can find that the process for PpSP15 requires much less volume of resins; 320 additionally, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), a process not ideal for large scale production, had been 321 included in the purification process for some of these recombinant protein vaccine antigens to increase their 322 purity. 24,27,30,31 However, the current purification scheme for PpSP15 does not require an SEC step to improve the 323 purity to >95%, and all the chosen purification steps are scalable, except that dialysis was used to exchange 324\n\nPpSP15 into an appropriate buffer due to the small volumes at this development phase. For future upscaling, we 325 plan to replace the dialysis step with diafiltration using 3 kDa Pellicon \u00ae cassettes. 326\n\nWith respect to protein characterization, several biophysical and biochemical assays were performed to study the 327 characteristics of this protein. It is well known that the recombinant proteins expressed in yeast can potentially be 328 heavily N-glycosylated, 27,33 an N-glycosylation assessment screening for the presence of the consensus sequence 329 for N-glycosylation, AsnXxxSer/Thr/Cys (where Xxx can be any amino acid except proline) was conducted. 34 In 330 the PpSP15 sequence (Supplementary Figure S5) , there are 9 Asn residues, but only Asn22 is followed by Ser24. 331\n\nHowever, the amino acid in between Asn22 and Ser24 is Pro23, thus Asn22 is most likely not glycosylated. SDS-332 PAGE gels and the mass spectrometry also indicated the absence of N-glycans. Other more sensitive and specific 333 assays were also applied to study the purity/impurity, including silver-stained SDS-PAGE and anti-PpSP15 334 western blot and anti-P. pastoris X33 HCP western blot. The results suggested that only trace amounts of HCP 335 and product-derived impurities, degraded PpSP15, were present in the purified PpSP15 sample. Moreover, no 336 detectable aggregation was found, which was also supported by DLS and SE-HPLC. Indeed, its low binding 337 affinity to the HIC column explaining this protein is likely highly hydrophilic. Additionally, when comparing the 338 six cysteine residues in PpSP15 form disulfide bridges, and thus, no free cysteine residue should be present to 340 form intermolecular disulfide bridges. These findings suggest a low tendency for PpSP15 to aggregate, a desirable 341 property for long-term stability. The secondary structure analyzed by far-UV CD indicated PpSP15 as a highly 342 alpha-helical protein (62.6% alpha-helix and 7.5% beta-sheet). This result was consistent with the secondary 343 structure of its homolog, PdSP15 (PDB ID 4OZD), (66% helix), which further validated the assay. Finally, pH 344 screening using a thermal shift assay was conducted to determine the proper pH system to maintain PpSP15 345 stability. It is noted that the onset temperature and melting temperature remained constant between pH 4.4-9.0; 346 however, a lower melting temperature was observed at both pH 3.1 and 3.7, suggesting instability of PpSP15, 347 which further indicates buffer formulations at a pH lower than 4.4 should be avoided. 348\n\nIn conclusion, the production process for recombinant PpSP15 as a leishmaniasis vaccine antigen candidate has 349 been developed. The upstream production process was optimized and generated approximately 1 g PpSP15 per 350\n\nliter of FS. The tag-free recombinant PpSP15 protein was able to be purified by a two-chromatographic-step 351 purification process, which involved an ion-exchange column and a hydrophobic interaction column, and the 352 binding capacities for both chromatographic steps were determined. Even though some minor adjustments will be 353 required, the process is suitable for further upscaling and studies of process recovery and process reproducibility. 354\n\nCharacterization of PpSP15 showed that the protein was highly pure with a well-defined structure. Future studies 355 should be focused on understanding long-term stability and stability under different stresses as these pieces of 356 information along with the ongoing preclinical study will inform whether there is a path forward for 357 manufacturing an economical vaccine for this neglected tropical disease. 358\n\nThis study was supported by a grant from the Department of Defense (Grant number: W81XWH-17-2-0050). 360\n\nWe are grateful to the laboratories of Dr. Jesus Valenzuela at the NIAID and Dr. Naomi Aronson at USUHS for 362 helpful discussions on the development of the PpSP15 process development.
