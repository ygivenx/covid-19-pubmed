{"title": "Cytotoxic effect of myelin basic protein-reactive T cells on cultured oligodendrocytes", "body": "To help clarify effector mechanisms in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), the cytotoxic effects of myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive lymphocytes on oligodendrocytes were studied using a 51Cr release assay. MBP-reactive encephalitogenic T cell lines were cytotoxic to 51Cr-labeled oligodendrocyte target cells derived from Lewis rat fetal brain-dissociated culture, when incubated for 6 h in the presence of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and MBP (percent 51Cr release = 65 + 3% vs. spontaneous release = 22 + 3% vs. normal lymph node cells + APC and MBP = 20 + 3%). This reaction is time dependent, likely MHC restricted, and is not just a nonspecific toxic effect against any Lewis target cells since neither fibroblasts nor astrocytes were affected. Other (tetanus toxoid-reactive) lymphoblasts stimulated by specific antigen were not cytotoxic to the oligodendrocytes. These findings suggest that oligodendrocytes might be target cells for MBP-reactive lymphocytes in EAE if antigen presentation is appropriate.\n\nIntroduction. It has been long considered that cell-mediated immune mechanisms play a pathogenic role in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) induced in rats by sensitization to myelin basic protein (MBP). However, the exact effector mechanisms underlying the clinical EAE manifestation in these animals are still not well defined.\n\nIn rat EAE induced with MBP, some investigators (Hoffman et al., 1973; Lasmann et al., 1979; Panitch et al., 1981) have found little or no pathologic evidence of demyelination or damaged oligodendrocytes, whereas others claim that such damage can be found if appropriate sampling and preparation of the suspect tissues are carried out (Pender, 1987) . Demyelination can be seen in passively induced EAE after repeated transfer of MBP-reactive T lymphocytes (Vandenbark et al., 1986) . Rtiytt~i et al. (1985) have reported damage of oligodendrocytes in organotypic cultures induced by lymphoid cells obtained from rodents with EAE.\n\nThese findings prompted us to investigate the in vitro interaction of MBP-reactive lymphocytes and oligodendrocytes. To investigate this interaction, we carried out cytotoxic tests of MBP-reactive T cell lines to syngeneic oligodendrocytes by a 51Cr release assay.\n\nMaterials and methods. Oligodendrocyte culture: Lewis rat oligodendrocytes were isolated from Lewis rat fetal brain-dissociation culture at 11-14 days in vitro by a modification of the method of Suzumura et al. (1984) . The suspensions of isolated oligodendrocytes were plated on 12 mm diameter poly-L-lysine-coated coverglasses at a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells per coverglass.\n\nThe mean percentage of galactocerebroside (GalC)-positive cells at the time they were used in experiments described below was 72% (range 65-91%).\n\nAstrocytes were also isolated from primary brain cell culture at 21-28 days in vitro after oligodendrocytes had been isolated by mechanical agitation (McCarthy and de Vellis, 1970; Suzumura et al., 1984 Suzumura et al., , 1986 . The mean percentage of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells was 93% (range 89-95%).\n\nT cell line cultures: Lewis rats, 3-4 months old, were immunized with 50 gg of guinea pig MBP and/or tetanus toxoid (TI') (Connaught Laboratories) 1 Lfu/ml emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant, containing 50 mg of Mycobacteriurn tuberculosis H37 RA.\n\nGuinea pig MBP was prepared in our laboratory by a modification of the method of Deibler et al. (1972) . The purity of MBP was confirmed with a single band seen on sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).\n\nNine to 10 days later the draining lymph nodes were removed and homogenized, washed three times and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% of normal rat serum, 5% of NCTC 109 medium (MA Bioproducts), 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO), 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 #g/ml streptomycin, 25 ng/ml Fungizone (Gibco Laboratories, Chagrin Falls, OH), 30 gg/ml guinea pig MBP or 2 Lfu/ml TT.\n\nAfter 5-7 days, lymphoblasts were separated from the small resting lymphocytes at the 1.050/1.065 interface of a discontinuous Percoll gradient. Lymphoblasts were then cultured in interleukin-2 (IL-2)-containing media. IL-2 was derived from conditioned medium of MLA 144 cells (Cohen et al., 1987) . The line cells were restimulated every 7-14 days with MBP or \"IT for 3 days. Irradiated normal thymocytes (1000 R) were added as antigen-presenting cells (APC). After 2-4 weeks the cultured lymphocytes were restimulated as above and then used as effector cells in the cytotoxic assay described below. The lymphocytes in these short-term cell lines were over 90% W3/25 \u00f7 (helper-inducer phenotype) as determined by immunohistochemical assay (Cohen et al., 1987) . They will hereafter be referred to as 'line cells' or 'lymphoblasts'. We have found that intravenous injection of these lymphoblasts (1.6-3.0 \u00d7 107 cells) consistently transferred EAE.\n\nCytotoxicity assay --target cells: After determination of optimal 51Cr labeling conditions in preliminary studies, 1 \u00d7 105 oligodendrocytes grown on 12 mm diameter, poly-L-lysine-coated coverglasses were incubated with 20/~Ci of sodium 5~chromate (New England Nuclear, spec. act. 200-900 Ci/g chromium) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0 C, washed 3 times and placed into 16 mm diameter wells containing medium.\n\nAs control target cell populations, Lewis rat astrocytes, fibroblasts and Brown Norway rat oligodendrocytes were used. Fibroblast cultures (98% fibronectin positive) were obtained from Lewis rat connective tissue.\n\nCytotoxicity assay --effector cells: MBP or tetanus toxoid-reactive lymphoblasts from antigen-stimulated culture were separated by Percoll gradient centrifugation. Freshly isolated normal Lewis rat lymph node cells and TT-reactive lymphoblasts were used as control effector cell populations.\n\nAnalysis of cytotoxic activity: The supernatant medium was removed from the wells containing the target cells on coverglasses and replaced immediately with 1 ml of suspension of the MBP-reactive lymphoblasts or normal lymph node cells in concentrations of 1 \u00d7 106 or 2 \u00d7 106/ml in the oligodendrocyte culture medium. To replicate sets of these wells containing oligodendrocytes and lymphoid cells were added either: (a) irradiated normal Lewis rat thymocytes as APC, (b) APC and MBP, or (c) nothing. When T'F-reactive lymphoblasts were assessed as a control effector cell population, they were added along with APC and 2 Lfu T'I\" to the oligodendrocyte-containing wells. These cell mixtures were then incubated for varying periods up to 6 h at 37\u00b0C, depending on the protocol. Spontaneous 51Cr release was assessed in other wells in which the same cultured oligodendrocytes were incubated without added reactants.\n\nAfter the incubation period, the supernatant fluid was collected completely, centrifuged and the fluid portion was transferred to a test tube for gamma counting (Packard). 1 ml of 1 N NaOH was then added to each well to lyse the cells on the coverglasses. The cell lysate was then transferred to test tubes for gamma counting.\n\nPercent 51Cr release was calculated as follows.\n\nPercent 51Cr release = cpm of supernatant cpm of supernatant + cpm of cell lysate X 100\n\nResults. In all experiments performed, MBP-reactive lymphoblasts were cytotoxic to the labeled oligodendrocyte target cells when incubated for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C in the presence of irradiated thymocytes (APC) and MBP (Table 1 ). This was indicated by significantly greater percent 51Cr release (mean _+ SEM = 65.4 + 3.3%) than the spontaneous 51Cr release from the same target cells (22.1 +_ 2.6%). The differences in individual experiments were highly significant (P < 0.05; Walsh test) (Table 1) . Both MBP and APC were required for this cytotoxic effect, since the percent 5aCr release induced by lymphoblasts alone (29.4 + 3.4%) and that induced by lymphoblasts plus APC alone (25.2 + 2.3%) were not significantly different from the spontaneous release from these target cells (P > 0.109, P > 0.109, respectively in Walsh test analysis of individual experiments). However, the combination of MBP and APC itself was not cytotoxic since the addition of these agents to normal lymph node ceils did not make the latter induce increased 51Cr release from the target cells (20.3 + 2.7%, P > 0.109 when compared to spontaneous release in individual experiments) ( Table 1) .\n\nlymphoblasts on the oligodendrocytes was not just a nonspecific effect on any Lewis target cells, as evidenced by the lack of any increased percent 51Cr release from labeled Lewis rat astrocytes or fibroblasts incubated with these lymphoblasts in the presence of MBP and APC (22.8 5: 1.7% and 12.2 5: 0.8% release, respectively vs. 18.8% and 14.3% spontaneous release) ( Table 2) .\n\nThe cytotoxic effect of MBP-reactive Lewis rat lymphoblasts on labeled oligodendrocytes appeared to be histocompatibility restricted. Such lymphoblasts in the presence of MBP and syngeneic APC did not induce increased 51Cr release from labeled oligodendrocytes obtained from nonhistocompatible Brown Norway rats (28.6 5: 3.6% vs. 32.8 5: 2.5% spontaneous release) ( Table 3) .\n\nThe cytotoxic effect by MBP-reactive lymphoblasts in the presence of MBP and APC was not simply a function of in vitro antigen stimulation of any sensitized Discussion. The findings reported here indicate that MBP-reactive Lewis rat lymphoblasts are cytotoxic in vitro to syngeneic oligodendrocytes. However, several questions about the mechanisms involved and in vivo relevance to the pathogenesis of EAE remain to be answered. The cytotoxic effects of several reported T cell clones is restricted to target cells expressing the same major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens (Moretta et al., 1981; Krensky et al., 1982; Strassman et ai., 1984; Sun et al., 1986) . Although the cytotoxic reaction reported here appears MHC restricted, the oligodendrocytes used in this study expressed neither MHC I nor MHC II at the time they were exposed to the cytotoxic lymphoblasts (preliminary observations).\n\nAnother question relates to the necessity for both MBP and APC in the cytotoxic effect. APC could provide a source of cells expressing MHC. However, such expression is usually required on the target cell itself. Furthermore, we saw no cytotoxic effect by MBP-reactive lymphoblasts in the presence of APC but no MBP. Therefore, it is more likely APC may present MBP for in vitro stimulation of the lymphoblasts. However, the cytotoxic reaction cannot be due simply to any stimulated lymphoblasts or its secreted products (e.g., lymphokines, shed MHC antigen (Hale et al, 1981; Emeesen, 1987) ) because TT-stimulated Lewis lymphoblasts were not cytotoxic.\n\nDuring an initial and modest damage of the oligodendrocytes by MBP-reactive lymphoblasts, products released from the target cells themselves might enhance the cytotoxic effect over the next hours. Vass et al. (1984) have speculated that MHC antigens may be bound to such altered cells rendering them susceptible to further damage."}
