{"title": "Organisation of primary health care in the Asia-Pacific region: developing a prioritised research agenda", "body": "A central feature of the universal health coverage (UHC) agenda is strengthening primary health care (PHC).1 High-functioning PHC systems are considered essential to achieving all 17 goals (Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs) of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda; not just the health-specific SDG3.2 Yet, decades after the Alma-Ata Declaration on PHC in 1978, many communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) still experience limited access to safe, effective and affordable PHC.\n\nThe growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCD), combined with an intensifying risk of infectious disease outbreaks, presents a \u2018double threat\u2019 to fragile health systems of LMICs of the Asia-Pacific region. Here, NCDs account for 80% of all deaths and 50% of premature deaths,3 4 a result of longevity, increasing urbanisation, economic growth and lifestyle factors. At the same time, outbreaks of emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003),5 Influenza A (2009)6 and Zika (2016)7 are likely to continue. A robust PHC system underpins a nation\u2019s ability to promote population health, and remain resilient in times of crisis. Yet PHC systems in many Asia-Pacific LMICs are the \u2018poor cousins\u2019 of the hospital system.8 Designed primarily to provide episodic care for acute disease management, they often struggle to manage long-term conditions, deliver preventive health activities or to integrate care across diseases.9\u201311\n\n\nThe present global movement towards UHC comes with renewed calls for the reorientation of health systems towards PHC.12 13 Yet, a lack of systematically assembled knowledge of what is needed and what works for effective PHC service delivery in Asia-Pacific LMICs may hinder progress for health system planners in this region. To ensure effective investment of limited research resources, it is therefore important to identify evidence-based implementation strategies for the organisation of PHC service delivery, determine where relevant evidence gaps exist and prioritise these gaps for future study. In this analysis paper, we describe an approach to identify such research priorities for optimising the organisation of PHC services in LMICs of the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nWe developed a framework of PHC system inputs and outcomes as the structural basis for our evidence mapping (figure 1). The framework was derived from elements of the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI) Conceptual Framework of High Functioning PHC Systems,14 the WHO\u2019s health system building blocks,15 the Chronic Care Model,16 recently published evidence of primary care models for NCDs in LMIC settings17 and the delivery system domains proposed by Lewin et al.18 We defined PHC system outcome categories as those health system attributes underpinning the principles of UHC: quality, coverage, efficiency, responsiveness and equity.19\u201321\n\n\nDetailed methods for the systematic evidence review have been described elsewhere.22 A final set of 111 articles were included in the review, including 21 reviews (9 Cochrane, 5 other systematic and 7 non-systematic reviews), 12 grey literature publications and 78 peer-reviewed original research studies (online supplementary file 1). The geographic distribution of included literature is displayed in online supplementary file 2.\n\nThe PHC system inputs and outcomes specifically addressed by the research were extracted from each article, alongside key study characteristics (context, geographical scope, research method, study population, disease focus). Each of these elements was summarised and collated in predefined codes based on our conceptual framework using EPPI-Reviewer 4 (EPPI-Centre, Social Science Research Unit, Institute of Education, University College London, UK).23 Two authors (RD, AP) independently coded the first 25 articles, following which coding decisions were compared and assessed for concordance, with discrepancies resolved by discussion and consensus. The remaining 86 articles were then divided between the same two authors for individual coding; coding uncertainties were resolved by discussion throughout the process.\n\nThe populated coding matrix (\u2018evidence gap map\u2019; figure 2) enabled rapid identification of those elements of the organisation of PHC services for which there is a lack of primary research and/or adequate process or impact evaluation to determine effectiveness. An interactive, web-based evidence map provides a visual representation of these gaps incorporating a range of filters (https://www.interactivegeorge.org; EPPI-Centre, Social Science Research Unit, Institute of Education, University College London).\n\nThe gap map identified six major areas of sparse or missing evidence:\n\nMost studies reported only coverage and quality outcomes, with very few focused on responsiveness, equity or efficiency. The majority of research had been undertaken in China and India (52% of original research), followed by other nations in South and East Asia with the notable absence of Cambodia, one of the more populous East Asian LMICs. By contrast, we found almost no peer-reviewed research on PHC in Pacific Island countries over the last decade and very limited grey literature (just three studies from American Samoa and one from Papua New Guinea).\n\nFew studies looked at why an intervention was able to be implemented successfully or examined the context in which the intervention was being tested (just three articles incorporated process evaluation). Most studies narrowly focused on a single dimension of the health system (such as workforce, or community-based service delivery) and did not consider how other system elements might influence the study outcome or the sustainability of recommendations. For example, studies on task shifting often looked at the efficacy of training to improve a health worker\u2019s capacity to perform a particular clinical task. Rarely were implications for broader health system functions considered, such as: How can new skills be maintained? How will the expanded duties of the health worker impact on team dynamics? and What are the implications for the delivery of existing programmes?\n\nIn the area of mHealth or eHealth tools, studies also rarely considered the broader context of implementation\u2014such as provider acceptability, patient literacy levels, telecommunications infrastructure or the regulatory environment. The majority of these studies also failed to consider costs and none evaluated initiatives at a national scale. Further, there was scant attention to the organisational and planning factors needed to support uptake of successful service delivery models. Only a few studies considered the costs or cost-effectiveness of the intervention being trialled and none calculated the upfront capital or ongoing recurrent cost implications for the health budget of introducing the recommended intervention or service.\n\nThe six identified areas of sparse or missing evidence (\u2018evidence gaps\u2019), together with these more nuanced findings from study characteristics, were reviewed and discussed by the research team, who shaped these into an initial list of key research questions (box 1). These research questions were subsequently integrated into a modified Delphi exercise.\n\nAn expert panel was convened via email in April to June 2018. We aimed to recruit stakeholders from government, aid/development organisations, academic institutions and civil society from a broad sample of Asia-Pacific LMICs, to seek their perspectives on, and prioritisation of, PHC research gaps. Stakeholders were identified through the authors\u2019 existing networks and snowball sampling. Despite the authors\u2019 strong network of China stakeholders, we discovered just prior to the initiation of the eDelphi exercise that firewall restrictions would preclude access to the survey website for China-based participants. Because of time constraints in administering the three rounds of the Delphi, we were unable to rebuild the survey using local Chinese online survey software. An iterative prioritisation process was undertaken, involving three rounds of web-based survey using a web-based data collection tool (Research Electronic Data Capture). This virtual method of expert engagement has been successfully applied elsewhere and is applicable where Delphi panel members are geographically dispersed.24 25\n\n\nWe recruited 22 participants to the expert panel (179 email invitations sent; 13% response rate). These included representatives from seven LMICs of the Asia-Pacific region, and seven individuals working across regional PHC programmes (table 1). Panel members were asked to complete each Delphi round within 10 days with automated email reminders prior to each round closing. A copy of the Delphi questionnaire is provided in online supplementary file 3; an overview of the three rounds is outlined here.\n\nIn round 1, panel members were presented with five topics derived from the conceptual framework underpinning the evidence review22 and asked to assign a priority rank (1, least important topic area to 5, most important topic area) based on where they felt more research evidence was needed. Topics included: (1) community engagement; (2) service delivery models; (3) continuity of patient care; (4) specialty services and integration of disease-specific programmes; and (5) partnerships with non-government service providers.22 Panel members could optionally add specific questions relating to their prioritised topic area and any additional research questions in free text format.\n\nThe top three ranked priority topics were: (1) service delivery models; (2) specialty services and integration of disease-specific programmes; and (3) continuity of patient care. Rankings were broadly consistent across professional sectors with one exception: non-government organisation/civil society sector members prioritised \u2018community engagement\u2019 over \u2018speciality services and integration\u2019 more than other panel members. Forty-seven research questions were suggested in free text by panel members; commonly identified research interests are highlighted in figure 3.\n\nIn round 2, following removal of duplicate questions from panel members and comparing/contrasting panel questions with those identified by the research team during the phase I evidence gap analysis (box 1), panel members prioritised a refined set of 29 research questions (see online supplementary file 3) into one of three tiers according to criteria established by the PHCPI (box 2). Fourteen of the original 22 panel members completed this exercise. Non-respondents included panel members from Fiji and Bangladesh (one from each country), two panel members representing regional programmes of the aid/development sector and two stakeholders from India (from academic and aid/development sectors).\n\nNineteen questions received an aggregate ranking within the top two priority tiers and were extracted for presentation in round 3. Top priority issues related to models for the management of chronic disease, strategies to improve coordination between providers, design of an essential PHC package responsive to community needs and use of routine health information to address service inequities. Questions deemed to be of low priority (tier 3) were: (1) digital health: particularly use of mHealth interventions for prevention, use of electronic health records with mobile PHC services and the constraints of mHealth (mobile network coverage, ownership of mobile devices, patient literacy); and (2) support and incentivisation strategies to sustain PHC doctors, particularly in rural/remote communities.\n\nIn the final round, panel members assigned the 19 questions from round 2 a score from 1 to 5 (1 being lowest and 5 being highest priority). Respondents included all 14 panel members from round 2. Questions with a median priority score of 4 or 5 were ranked into a \u2018top 10\u2019 list of priority questions (table 2). Six of these questions received \u226560% agreement among panel members as being high priority.\n\nSix of the top 10 research questions identified by the expert panel reflected a desire for knowledge of how to strengthen service planning and accountability mechanisms to improve PHC system outcomes. These included: sustainable PHC service delivery models for the management of chronic diseases; sustainable models of vertical disease programme integration; projecting healthcare needs of the future; and integrating primary, secondary and tertiary care across the health sector. There was also a clear gap in the literature in this area, with the small number of interventional studies identified being primarily focused on testing \u2018community consultation\u2019 as an approach to optimising coverage and responsiveness in PHC service planning. Research on how to strengthen the systems that support the organisation, management and oversight of services\u2014for example, planning, resource allocation, performance management\u2014was also rare. Notably, questions prioritised by the panel represent a \u2018big picture\u2019 framing of planning and accountability issues yet neglect mechanisms to support planning decisions (eg, use of routine health service data) and health workforce and service accountability. This may reflect stakeholder scepticism that a research study can generate practical insights into issues that essentially require improved management and leadership.\n\nFive of the top 10 research questions prioritised by the Delphi panel addressed the PHC system input category of service delivery models. Questions related to: effective service delivery models for chronic diseases; how to use task shifting (through non-physician health workers (NPHW)) to best support PHC service delivery; addressing barriers to continuity of care; determining an effective package of PHC services; and the optimum mix of health workers at primary care level. While studies on service delivery models did dominate the relatively small evidence base, the majority were narrowly focused on the delivery of a specific intervention. Again, there was a notable contrast between the discrete intervention focus of research to date and the system-focused research priorities of the regional stakeholders. Another prioritised question, on the impact on NPHWs of integrating new programmes into their work routines, also reflected stakeholder interest in determining effective workforce development strategies to optimise team-based PHC functioning. This knowledge gap converged with the findings of the evidence mapping process and has been highlighted elsewhere as a key enabler to successful integration of front-line health services.26\n\n\nDespite the void of evidence relating to improving access to essential medicines, vaccines and technologies, and health promotion, the Delphi expert panel rated only one research question in these areas as high priority: how do we ensure that essential drugs and diagnostics are always available in PHC services? This might reflect the absence of representation of PHC service providers on the expert panel, as well as the small number of government stakeholders completing the Delphi final rounds (2/14 panel members; none of who were health service planners or managers).\n\nSurprisingly, the workforce literature had few studies examining the role of doctors at the PHC level, with issues such as cost-effectiveness of deploying doctors versus other health cadres, professionalism, quality of care and retention relatively neglected. Knowledge gaps relating to strategies for the recruitment and retention of doctors in rural/remote PHC settings were deprioritised in round 2 of the Delphi process; the panel deemed these lower priority research issues than, for example, enhancing the role of NPHWs and models of service integration. It is worth noting that other research questions deprioritised by our panel of regional stakeholders also reflected topic areas for which there are significant gaps in the evidence base, that is, the broader context of implementation for mHealth/eHealth interventions, and integration of electronic health records in mobile PHC services. Once again, the low priority given to these topics may be a result of the lower government stakeholder representation in latter rounds of the Delphi.\n\nWe adopted a pragmatic approach to incorporate stakeholder views in the analysis of knowledge gaps and expand on the systematic review reported by Dodd and colleagues.22 The research team made every effort to recruit a broadly based panel for the Delphi exercise, resulting in a group of 22 experts from seven countries (as listed in table 1), with 14 original panel members completing rounds 2 and 3. We were therefore limited by the small Delphi panel size (only 22/179 (13%) invited participants agreed to join and 14/22 (64%) original panel members completed rounds 2 and 3). The initial response rate is reflective of response rates previously achieved by web-based Delphi research,24 and is a notable drawback of this virtual method of engagement that should be considered alongside benefits of efficiency and geographical reach. We were thus unable to highlight regional variation in priority evidence needs and reliably determine the areas of concordance and discordance between the literature-informed evidence gaps and stakeholder research priorities. The inability to include China stakeholders represents a significant limitation, particularly given the predominance of evidence from China PHC systems. Alternative approaches to engaging China PHC stakeholders in priority setting activities, including roundtable discussions or the face-to-face nominal group technique, are proposed in the future. Lack of expert panel representation from Pacific Island countries in the latter stages of the Delphi process also weakens the geographic relevance of identified research priorities. Clearly, the findings would need to be corroborated with both deeper engagement with panel members (perhaps through in-depth interviews) and broader engagement with a larger number of stakeholders from across the region.\n\nEmbedding research into local health system policy and practice, and fostering a culture of sharing \u2018practice-based evidence\u201927 (including both intended and unintended consequences), will help provide decision makers in the region with contextual examples of service packages and team composition, and the necessary prerequisites for successful implementation. Research endeavours in this area should link epidemiological data of disease burden with sustainability considerations, including community acceptability and cost-effectiveness, to inform public investment. Studies may consider appropriate models of PHC delivered through the formal health system (and involving different cadres of qualified health workers), as well as the potential role of lay health workers and how best to link them into government services.\n\nMethodologies including policy mapping and analysis to understand the regulatory and organisational context, and qualitative enquiry to assess actors\u2019 perceptions of shared roles and responsibilities, as well as barriers and facilitators to successful collaboration, are highly relevant.\n\nStudying complexity in the organisation and delivery of PHC services is critical to identify effective mechanisms of management within dynamic, often unpredictable, systems.28 Interdisciplinary research, for example, bringing together scholars of public health, social science and management science, may help overcome the challenges of research design in this area.\n\nApplying quasiexperimental study designs such as interrupted time series analysis to evaluate longitudinal effects, incorporating codesign principles to ensure the voices of end-users inform context-appropriate interventions and embedding realist evaluation into studies from the outset, will each help to identify and account for health system complexity in future research.\n\nStudies should take a multidimensional approach, looking at the role of training, tools and technologies and at relevant systemic issues such as supportive supervision, medicine supply, appropriate remuneration models and regulatory frameworks (eg, professional recognition, essential medicine prescribing rights), and improving health information systems. Equally, it is important to consider how task shifting or the introduction of new interventions affects team dynamics, both within the formal system and between formal and non-formal workers.\n\nTo ensure interventional strategies are both acceptable and sustainable, there is an important role here for sociology and anthropology expertise, qualitative research methodologies, process evaluation to better identify contextual factors influencing an intervention\u2019s success or failure and novel methods to understand decision-making priorities of health workers and implementers, such as discrete choice experiments.\n\nLack of evidence on the impact of front-line health service integration, as well as the necessary preconditions for achieving it, continues to impair the ability of decision makers and planners to assess integration preparedness in their setting, and limits knowledge of effective strategies to achieve sustainable integration.26 In the Asia-Pacific, there is a particular need for knowledge of how to effectively consolidate existing vertically funded programmes and operationalise the delivery of an integrated package of PHC services, including care for chronic NCDs. Again, embedded research conducted in partnership with policymakers and implementers (including non-government service providers) is necessary to ensure generative learning and allow flexibility to iterate and adapt integration strategies over time.\n\nIncorporating process evaluation is necessary to establish enablers of effective service coordination in different health system settings, taking into account context-specific factors. Sharing and synthesis of case studies that document processes and challenges of service integration efforts, and the roles of different stakeholders, will promote intraregional learning.\n\nWhere possible, equity should be incorporated as a primary outcome of study design (much of the identified evidence that applied an equity lens did so as a peripheral analysis). Equally, looking beyond the economic dimensions of equity, related to income poverty, to include other types of marginalised and vulnerable populations, including those living in remote and underserved areas, would address a key gap in the evidence base. As with future studies on processes related to planning, delivery and accountability, there is scope for research that examines the political/distal determinants of health equity using a multidisciplinary approach and drawing on social science methodologies in particular. The Pacific is clearly an under-represented region in global PHC evidence; given its unique service delivery challenges of small island states and remote populations, further research from the Pacific Island context is especially warranted.\n\nTo progress towards achieving sustainable development in Asia-Pacific LMICs, and UHC, there is a need to identify evidence-based implementation strategies for optimising PHC service delivery and incorporate local system perspectives to identify and prioritise evidence needs. Here, we present a PHC research agenda shaped by regional PHC stakeholder perspectives, and reflect on disparities between the presently sparse evidence base and national evidence priorities. Across each of the five recommended focus areas, a major boost to PHC systems research and research capacity in the Pacific region is critical. The organisation of PHC services is chronically understudied in these small island nations and work across any PHC research domain would represent new knowledge and value add to the evidence base. We encourage a process of codesign between researchers, end-users and decision makers to align PHC research priorities from the outset. We also advocate for use of pragmatic but rigorous research methods that account for PHC system complexity, to accelerate regional learning and transferability of successful interventions. Doing so will help ensure that research investment meets the evidence needs of decision makers, and that findings are both useful and used."}
