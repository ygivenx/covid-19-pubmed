{"title": "Genome and Infection Characteristics of Human Parechovirus Type 1:\nThe Interplay between Viral Infection and Type I Interferon Antiviral\nSystem", "body": "Human parechovirus (HPeV), a small, round-structured, non-enveloped virus with a\nsingle-stranded and positive-sense RNA genome, belongs to the\nPicornaviridae [1]. HPeV is structurally similar to other picornaviruses because of its\nicosahedral symmetry and appearance on electron microscopy [2]. It was first described in\n1961 as echoviruses 22 and 23 of the genus Enterovirus on the basis\nof serology and clinical presentation on identification from an outbreak of diarrhea\namong children [3]. However,\nfurther studies showed that properties of the virus, such as nucleotide sequence in\nreplication and translation elements, differ from other members of the genus\nEnterovirus. So the virus was re-classified into a new genus,\nParechovirus, and the echoviruses 22 and 23 were re-named HPeV1\nand HPeV2, respectively [4,5,6]. During the past decade,\nseveral other HPeV isolates have been reported; to date, we have the full genome\nsequences for eight HPeV types, HPeV1 to HPeV8, and eight other types, HPeV9 to\nHPeV16, are known based on their viral protein 1 (VP1) sequences (http://www.picornastudygroup.com).\n\nFor replication and virus particle formation of HPeV, the open reading frame (ORF),\nflanked by a 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and a 3' UTR, encodes a single\npolyprotein that is processed to three structural or capsid-encoding proteins (VP0,\nVP3 and VP1, encompassing P1) and seven nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C [P2]; 3A,\n3B, 3C and 3D [P3]). Unlike other picornaviruses, HPeV VP0 nucleocapsid is not\nfurther cleaved to generate the capsid proteins VP4 and VP2 [7]. HPeV differs from members\nof the genus Enterovirus by not shutting off host cell protein\nsynthesis during replication; its 2A protein does not likely possess protease\nactivity to prevent normal cellular cap-dependent translation [7,8,9,10].\n\nMany picornaviruses use immunoglobulin superfamily members or integrin of target\ncells as the attachment receptor to enter host cells [2]. The\nArginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) motif at the C-terminus of HPeV1 VP1 binds to\nintegrin on the cell membrane as part of its entry process [11]. However, the RGD motif is\nabsent in HPeV3, associated with neonatal sepsis and infection of the central\nnervous system (CNS), and in at least two types of the recently described HPeV7 and\nHPeV8 [12,13,14]. Mechanisms other than RGD\nbinding to integrin may occur on infection with different HPeVs.\n\nAfter virus entry, the segment located at the 5' UTR, called the internal ribosomal\nentry site (IRES), directs ribosomal binding to a position close to an internal\nstart (methionine) codon [1].\nThere, RNA translates into a polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved by the\ntrypsin-like protease (3C) to produce nonstructural proteins for initiation of the\nreplication cycle of HPeV [10]. The functions of some nonstructural proteins of HPeV can only be\nspeculated by comparison with those of picornaviruses, but 3D is known as an\nRNA-dependent RNA polymerase that copies viral genome during replication [7,15].\n\nHPeV infections may be common in early childhood [16]. A large enterovirus surveillance in the United\nStates from 1983 to 2003 revealed 73% HPeV1 infection and 68% HPeV2 infection in\nchildren < 1 year old [17]. Indeed, we have only a few reports of HPeV infection in patients\n> 10 years old [18,19,20]. The most common genotype\nof HPeV in Europe is HPeV1, followed by HPeV3 [15,21,22]. In Japan,\nHPeVs were isolated from 0.3% of 13,656 clinical samples collected from 1991 to\n2005; the isolated HPeV types were HPeV3 (39%), HPeV1 (34.2%), HPeV6 (24.4%) and\nHPeV4 (2.4%) [18]. HPeV1 may\nbe the most prevalent type worldwide. Serological ELISA revealed the seroprevalence\nfor HPeVs from 22% to 88% in children between 2 and 24 months old, 70% in children\n\u2264 5 years old and 95% in adults [23]. Most infections of HPeVs are asymptomatic or\nclinically mild in severity in children > 5 years old and adults, and it is\nprobably due to the age-dependent established antiviral immunity against widespread\ncirculation and infection of HPeVs [23,24,25].\n\nHPeV1 causes diseases in gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, considered the\nprimary routes of infection [25]. Nosocomial infection or outbreaks in neonate hospital departments\nseem to play a substantial role in both kinds of HPeV infection [26,27]. More severe consequences\nof HPeV infection, such as acute flaccid paralysis, myocarditis, and Reye syndrome,\nhave been reported [13,18]; HPeV3 infection results in\nsevere diseases of the CNS and neonatal sepsis [28]. HPeV3 infection is almost exclusively restricted to\ninfants < 3 months old [29], which may be explained by observations of much lower seroprevalence\nof HPeV3 among women of childbearing age as compared with almost universal\nseropositivity for HPeV1 [28,30];\ntherefore, neonates are at increased risk of HPeV3 infection because of reduced\nmaternal antibody protection [31]. HPeV3 differs from HPeV1 by lacking the RGD motif in VP1, so an\nalternative receptor may exist, thus changing the cellular tropism of HPeV3 and\nleading to enhanced ability to spread and replicate in the CNS [32,33].\n\nAlthough HPeV is a widespread pathogen that plays a significant role in several\ndiseases, it is not routinely detected in most laboratories because it often grows\npoorly in culture, typing reagents are not widely available for new types, and the\ntechnique is laborious and time-consuming [33]. Thus, we have limited information on the actual\nincidence of HPeV infection in clinical illnesses, and more importantly, delayed\ndiagnosis and management in severe conditions.\n\nIn this study, we report the completed genome of a newly isolated, in\nvitro\u2013 propagated HPeV1 strain, KVP6, and its comparison with\nother random selected HPeV isolates with full genome information available in\nGenBank. We also generated a polyclonal antibody against HPeV1 VP0 to detect the\ncell tropism of HPeV1. The HPeV1 replication kinetics and interplay with host innate\nimmunity were investigated. This study delineates adaptable infection systems to\nfacilitate future investigations of the pathogenicity of HPeV.\n\nThe HPeV1 KVP6 was isolated by the Virology Group, Department of Microbiology,\nKaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, and propagated in Vero cells (ATCC: CCL-81)\nby continuous passage, at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. A549\nhuman lung adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC: CCL-185), HeLa human cervical cancer\ncells (Bioresource Collection and Research Center [BCRC]: 6005), and J774A.1\nmouse macrophage cells (BCRC: 60140) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified\nEagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;\nInvitrogen). T84 colon carcinoma cells (BCRC: 60149) were grown in DMEM\nsupplemented with 5% FBS. BHK21 hamster kidney cells (BCRC: 60041) and DBTRG-5MG\nhuman glioblastoma cells (BCRC: 60380) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium\nsupplemented with 5% and 10% FBS, respectively. IFN\u03b1-2a (Prospec) and\nIFN\u03b2 (Peprotech) were used for virus inhibition assay. PolyI:C was from\nInvitrogen.\n\nTo determine virus titers, culture medium from HPeV1-infected cells was harvested\nfor plaque-forming assays. Various virus dilutions were added to 6-well plates\nwith 80% confluent Vero cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. After\nadsorption, cells were gently washed and overlaid with 1% agarose (SeaPlaque;\nFMC BioProducts) containing MEM supplemented with 2% FBS. After 7 days\u2019\nincubation at 37\u00b0C, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde, then stained\nwith 1% crystal violet for further plaque counting. To determine the viral\ngrowth curve, 100 \u03bcl culture medium from HPeV1-infected cells in 12-well\nplates was harvested over time for viral titration.\n\nThe RNA of the HPeV1 KVP6 isolate was extracted by the addition of 500 \u03bcl\nTRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), then 100 \u03bcl chloroform. The emulsion was\ncentrifuged and the aqueous phase transferred to a fresh tube. The RNA was\nprecipitated with 250 \u03bcl isopropanol and pelleted by centrifugation at\n12,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. Gel-like pelleted RNA was washed\nwith 1 ml of 75% ethanol, then centrifuged at 7,500 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for\n5 min. After removal of supernatant, it was air dried for 10 min in a laminar\nflow hood and resuspended in nuclease-free water at 55\u201360\u00b0C. cDNA\nwas synthesized with use of a 50 mM random primer with 1 \u03bcg total RNA in\na total reaction volume of 12 \u03bcl by the Superscript III reverse\ntranscriptase method (Invitrogen).\n\nThe HPeV1 KVP6 genome sequence was accessed by 3\u2019 RACE and then PCR with 8\npairs of oligonucleotide primers (S1 Table), which were designed on\nthe basis of the genome sequences of HPeV1 7555312 (GenBank accession no.\nFM178558). All fragments of PCR products were sequenced directly in both\ndirections and then assembled.\n\nqPCR amplification involved 6 ng cDNA in 10 \u03bcl SYBR green PCR master mix\n(Applied Biosystems) with 3 \u03bcM primers in the ABI StepOne Plus Real-Time\nPCR System (Applied Biosystems). The relative gene mRNA expression was\nnormalized to that of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) as a\nloading control. The primer sequences for qPCR are in supplemental material\nS2\nTable.\n\nThe random selected HPeV genome sequences for phylogenetic and similarity plots\nanalysis were HPeV type 1 strains Harris (accession no. L02971), SH1 (accession\nno. FJ840477), and 7555312 (accession no. FM178558); HPeV type 2 strain\nWilliamson (accession no. AJ005695); HPeV type 3 strains Can82853-01 (accession\nno. AJ889918) and A308/99 (accession no. AB084913); HPeV type 4 strains\nK251176-02 (accession no. DQ315670) and Fuk2005-123 (accession no. AB433629);\nHPeV type 5 strains T92-15 (accession no. AM235749) and CT86-6760 (accession no.\nAF055846) [34]; HPeV type\n6 strains NII561-2000 (accession no. AB252582) and 2005\u2013823 (accession\nno. EU077518); HPeV type 7 strain PAK5045 (accession no. EU556224); HPeV type 8\nstrain BR/217/2006 (accession no. EU716175); and Ljungan virus (accession no.\nEF202833). The nucleotide and translated amino acid sequences of HPeV1 KVP6 and\nother reference HPeV strains were aligned by use of MEGA 5.2.2. The resulting\nphylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method with 1000\nreplication for bootstrapping and pairwise deletion as gap-missing\ndata-processing. Similarity analysis involved the known full-length nucleotide\nsequences of HPeV1 to HPeV8 genomes against HPeV1 KVP6, and plots were generated\nby use of SimPlot 3.5.\n\nThe Pep VP0-21, a 21-amino-acid synthetic peptide, NLTQHPSAPTIPFTPDFRNVD, derived\nfrom the conserved VP0 caspid protein, was found highly antigenic for detection\nof HPeV [23]. New Zealand\nrabbits were vaccinated with Pep VP0-21 peptide in six boosts over 2 months. At\n7 days after the last boost, immunized rabbit serum containing anti-HPeV1 VP0\nantibody was harvested and peptide affinity-purified. The antibodies for\nphospho-IRF3 (pS386) (#2562-1, Epitomics), IRF3 (#sc-9082, Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology), phospho-STAT1 (phospho-Tyr701) (GTX50118, GeneTex), STAT1\n(#9172, Cell Signaling) and \u03b2-actin (MAB1501, Millipore) were used for\nimmunoblotting.\n\nMock- or virus-infected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min,\nwashed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 3 times, then permeabilized with\n0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After three washes with PBS, cells were blocked\nwith 10% skim milk in PBS for 60 min. Cells were incubated with an anti-HPeV VP0\nantibody (1:500) at 4\u00b0C overnight, then secondary antibody Alexa\nFluor-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000, Invitrogen) at room temperature for 2\nh. Cell nuclei were stained with 4',6-diami-dino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1 mg/ml,\n1:100,000 dilution in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. After three washes\nwith PBS, cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope.\n\nCells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40,\n0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]) containing protease inhibitor (Roche).\nHarvested cell extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF\nmembranes, which were incubated with primary antibody, then horseradish\nperoxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory) and\nvisualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo). Images were\nacquired by use of BioSpectrum Image System (UVP, Upland, CA).\n\nWST-1 assay (Roche) was used to monitor cell proliferation; A549 and T84 cells\nwere trypsinized and resuspended in culture medium, then plated at\n5\u00d7103 cells per well in 96-well plates and incubated\novernight, then incubated with 10 \u03bcl WST-1 reagent (Roche) for 2 h. The\ncell viability was quantified by multi-well spectrophotometry (Anthos). The\nabsorbance at 450 nm was monitored and the reference wavelength was set at 620\nnm.\n\nTurboFect transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific) was used for transient\ntransfection following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Cells cultured in\n12-well plates were transfected with IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) Luc\nreporter plasmid before viral infection or IFN\u03b2 stimulation. pRL-TK\n(Promega), encoding Renilla luciferase under an HSV thymidine\nkinase promoter, was an internal control. Cell lysates were collected for\ndual-luciferase assay (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to\nthat of Renilla luciferase.\n\nThe complete genome of the HPeV1 virus contains 7,329 nucleotides, excluding the\n3' poly(A) tail. Flanked by a 681-nt 5' UTR and a 111-nt 3' UTR, the predicted\npolyprotein is encoded by a 6,537-nt single ORF. The genome organization of\nHPeV1 KVP6 is identical to that of other HPeVs [7,15] (S3 Table). The genome sequence of HPeV1 KVP6 has been deposited in\nGenBank (accession no. KC769584).\n\nWe aligned the entire genome nucleotide sequence of HPeV1 KVP6 with the 14\ncompleted genomes of HPeV1-8 and that of Ljungan virus, a rodent parechovirus.\nWe performed a SimPlot analysis on these known HPeV full-length nucleotide\nsequences against HPeV1 KVP6 to identify a possible recombination event between\ndifferent HPeV prototypes. The SimPlot analysis revealed the highest similarity\nof HPeV1 KVP6 with HPeV1 strain 7555312 in the highly variable capsid-encoding\nregions VP0, VP3 and VP1, so HPeV1 KVP6 grouped with HPeV1 [35,36] (Fig. 1A); however, in the more\nconserved regions, such as 2C and 3D, HPeV1 KVP6 had higher similarity with\nHPeV7 PAK5045. Such findings may have resulted from a recombination event during\nHPeV evolution [35]. In\naddition, full genome alignment showed that HPeV1 KVP6 shared the highest\nnucleotide sequence homology, 87%, with the HPeV1 strain 7555312 and a mean of\n77% identity with other HPeV isolates (S4 Table). At the polyprotein\nlevel, all isolates possessed a mean of 88% amino acid identity; however, HPeV1\nKVP6 shared 97% amino acid homology with HPeV1 strain 7555312 (Fig. 1B and S5 Table).\nPhylogenetic analysis of structural regions, in particular of VP1 protein\nbecause of its decisive role in molecular typing of HPeV [34], showed the HPeV1 KVP6\nVP1 sequence close to that of HPeV1 strain 7555312 (Fig. 1C), and HPeV1 KVP6 can\nbe typed to HPeV1 clade 1B [35]. In fact, similar findings were noted in the phylogenetic\nanalysis of nonstructural regions (data not shown).\n\nTo characterize the infection features of this newly isolated HPeV1, we tested\nthe cell type tropism of HPeV1; various cell types were infected with HPeV1, and\ntheir susceptibility to infection was measured by immunofluorescence assay with\nanti-HPeV1 VP0 antibody. Vero cells (monkey kidney epithelial cells) are widely\nused in virology and show susceptibility for HPeV1 infection, which could be a\npositive control for infection. In addition, T84 cells (intestinal carcinoma),\nA549 cells (lung carcinoma cells) and DBTRG-5MG (glioblastoma cells) were\nsusceptible to HPeV infection; BHK21 cells (baby hamster kindney epithelial\ncells), HeLa cells (human cervival cancer cells) and J774A.1 cells (mouse\nmacrophages) were not infected with HPeV1 (Fig. 2). Because HPeV1 infection causes clinical\nsymptoms including respiratory- and gastrointestinal-tract and CNS symptoms\n[25], the cell\ntropism results might reflect in part an association of HPeV1 infection and its\ntarget organs. Our data also support the cell tropism of HPeV1 Harris strain and\nother clinically isolated HPeV1 strains [31,37].\n\nTo understand whether viral features of the cytopathic effect (CPE) and viral\ngenome are changed during viral amplification, we propagated the HPeV1 KVP6\nvirus from the 4th progeny (P4) in Vero cells with serial\nsub-passaging. We found no CPE at post-infection day 10 in P5 infected cells,\nwhich might due to the extremely low virion production. Nevertheless, P6 progeny\nshowed CPE and plaque formation; CPE was accelerated from day 9 to 3 in the\nlater progenies, and viral titer was increased at P9 and P10 (Fig. 3A, left panels). Genome\nmutation during virus passage was reported in hepatitis A and E virus infection\nand severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) infection [38,39,40]. We analyzed the VP1\nsequence from different progenies, because in P9 of HPeV1 KVP6, the nucleotide\nposition 2984 adenosine was replaced by thymine and resulted in a mutation in\namino acid position 768 from Asparagine to Isoleucine (Fig. 3A, right panel). Because\nthe amino acid position 768 is close to the RGD motif (position 763~765),\nwhether this mutation relates to receptor binding might be of interest.\nMutations other than the 2984 positive one may exist in other regions of the\ngenome. These data suggest that HPeV1 KVP6 virulence and viral titer could be\namplified by serial passage in vitro; however, the genome\ninstability would appear during the passages.\n\nWe determined the infection and viral replication activities of P6 to P10 progeny\nof HPeV1 KVP6 in A549 and T84 cells until CPE appeared at 96 h post-infection\n(hpi). In both cell types, these progenies showed similar kinetics of production\nof assembled viral particles, with viral titer amplified approximately 100-fold\nat 24 hpi, then gradually increased in A549 cells during incubation (Fig. 3B). In T84 cells, after\n24 hpi, the virus was sustained at a constant level until 96 hpi (Fig. 3C). The virus\nreplication pattern also suggested that HPeV1 might go through one complete\ncycle during 2 and 6 hpi in A549 cells and 6 and 24 hpi in T84 cells. According\nto the applicable viral titer and genome stability, HPeV1 KVP6 P7 progeny were\nused for further study.\n\nIn A549 cells, for HPeV1 viral RNA replication kinetics, RT-qPCR analyses of\nHPeV1 viral genes showed two peaks of positive- and negative-sense RNA gene\nexpression of VP1. The first peak occurred at 6 hpi and the second but smaller\nsurge at 72 or 96 hpi (Fig.\n3D, upper panels). The two-peaks phenomenon of HPeV1 replication in\nA549 cells was further supported by VP0 immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 3E, upper panels). The\ndata showed the two rounds of viral replication in A549 cells, the first round\nduring 2 to 6 hpi and the second during 72 to 96 hpi. However, the two peaks of\nVP1 replication in A549 cells was not found in T84 cells: the mRNA and protein\nexpression of HPeV1 VP1 peaked at 6 hpi, then decreased over time (Fig. 3D and E, lower panels).\nAs well, the fold increase in VP1 RNA was lower in T84 than A549 cells.\n\nThe kinetics of viral production was assayed by plaque-forming assay. In A549\ncells, the HPeV1 accumulated over time and reached > 105\nPFU/ml at 72 or 96 hpi, approximately 10-fold higher than at 6 hpi, (Fig. 3F, upper panel), with\napproximately 100-fold increase in T84 cells (Fig. 3F, lower panel). Thus, T84 cells might be more\nsusceptible to HPeV1 producing a higher level of virions than A549 cells. These\nviral titer findings also suggested that the virion production kinetics was not\nassociated with the dynamic mRNA and protein expression in infected cells.\nHowever, why the second round of viral gene or protein expression did not\nproceed in T84 cells during 72 to 96 hpi and why the relatively low mRNA level\nin T84 cells is unclear. Whether these phenomena are cell type-dependent\nrequires further investigation.\n\nWST-1 assay demonstrated that increasing culture temperature promoted A549 and\nT84 cell proliferation (Fig.\n4A). Although the abnormal physical temperature 33\u00b0C and\n39\u00b0C did not impair cell viability within 4 days (Fig. 4A), HPeV1 virion\nproduction was inhibited at 39\u00b0C incubation at 24 hpi in A549 and T84\ncells (Fig. 4B). To test the\nHPeV1 virion stability in different temperatures, HPeV1 virus was incubated at\n33\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C between 6 and 48 h before infection of\nA549 and T84 cells. Immunofluorescence assay revealed that HPeV1 infectivity was\nimpaired after 24-h incubation under all incubation conditions. HPeV1 infection\nwith 6-h short-term incubation at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C retained the\ninfectivity of the positive control; nevertheless, 39\u00b0C-treated virus\ncould not efficiently infect A549 and T84 cells (S1A and B Figs.), which suggested\nthe HPeV1 is unstable at 39\u00b0C. HPeV1 virion may be sensitive to elevated\ntemperature.\n\nHost innate immune response is critical against virus; therefore, we examined\nwhether temperature affected viral infection-mediated innate immune activation.\nInterferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) plays a key role in virus triggering\ninnate immunity activation; it coordinates with NF\u03baB p65 subunit and\nc-Jun/AP1 to bind the type I IFN promoter region to induce type I IFN\ntranscription [41,42,43]. Thus, we monitored\nIRF3 phosphorylation to understand the HPeV1-mediated innate immune response\nunder different incubation temperatures. HPeV1 induced high-level and long-term\nIRF3 phosphorylation in A549 cells at 37\u00b0C but not 39\u00b0C culture\n(Fig. 4C, upper panels);\nvirus production failed at 39\u00b0C (Fig. 4B). The findings of 37\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C\nincubation might reflect a typical viral load\u2013dependent response of IRF3\nactivation under normal physical temperature. Additionally, 33\u00b0C is lower\nthan 37\u00b0C, and A549 cells showed defective IRF3 activation, even though\nHPeV1 was produced at 33\u00b0C incubation (Fig. 4B), which suggested the low host response to\nvirus infection at 33\u00b0C. In fact, polyI:C-induced IRF3 phosphorylation\nlevel was lower in 33\u00b0C than 37\u00b0C in A549 and T84 cells (S2 Fig.).\nVirus-mediated IRF3 activation was ambiguous at all three culture temperatures\nin T84 cells (Fig. 4C, lower\npanels); more HPeV1 virions were produced in T84 than A549 cells at 33\u00b0C\nand 37\u00b0C (Fig. 4B).\nWe also detected IRF3 activation in another HPeV1-susceptible cell line,\nDBTRG-5MG glioblastoma cells, which showed a similar IRF3 activation pattern as\nfor HPeV1-infected A549 cells (Fig.\n4D).\n\nThe diversity of HPeV1-mediated IRF3 activation in different cell types was\nsupported by double-stranded RNA polyI:C stimulation inducing greater\nphosphorylation of IRF3 in A549 than T84 cells (Fig. 4E); consistently, HPeV1 and polyI:C induced a\nhigher mRNA level of IFN\u03b11 and IFN\u03b2 in A549 cells (Fig. 4F and G). As compared\nwith A549 cells, T84 cells showed a more torpid innate immune response. Cell\ntype might be a critical factor in viruses triggering antiviral signaling\nactivation.\n\nTo understand the efficiency of type I IFN against HPeV1, A549 and T84 cells were\ntreated with IFN\u03b1-2a or IFN\u03b2 before or after HPeV1 infection, and\ninfectivity was analyzed by immunofluorescence assay (S3 Fig.).\nThe infection rate of HPeV1 was estimated. IFN\u03b1-2a and IFN\u03b2\npretreatment reduced HPeV1 infection, but this effect was not shown with IFN\npost-treatment in A549 cells (Fig.\n5A). Surprisingly, T84 cells showed no anti-HPeV1 activity of type I\nIFN with pretreatment or post-treatment with IFN (Fig. 5B). Viral titration assay also revealed the\neffect of type I IFN against HPeV1 in A549 but not T84 cells (Fig. 5C and D). Therefore, we\nmeasured the level of Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of\ntranscription 1 (STAT1) activation of the type I IFN signaling pathway. As\ncompared with T84 cells, A549 cells showed that IFN\u03b1-2a and IFN\u03b2\ninduced higher levels of STAT1 and phosphorylated STAT1 (Fig. 5E and F). These data\nwould explain in part that pretreatment with type I IFN inhibited HPeV1\ninfection in A549 but not T84 cells and suggested that the efficiency of type I\nIFN against HPeV1 was cell type\u2013dependent. Interestingly, HPeV1 was not\nable to induce STAT1 activation in either cell type (Fig. 5E and F), which may be\nimportant for HPeV1 infection via modulating the IFN signaling pathway.\n\nOur results indicated that type I IFN post-treatment could not inhibit HPeV1\ninfection and HPeV1 failed to activate STAT1 (Fig. 5); HPeV1 might feature a type I IFN evasion\nmachinery, which was described in other RNA virus infection models [44,45,46]. Type I IFN-activated\nSTAT1 phosphorylation was reduced in HPeV1-infected A549 cells (Fig. 6A, left panel), with a\nslight difference in T84 cells (Fig. 6B, right panel), which might due to the low response to type I\nIFN of T84 cells. Another more sensitive assay revealed that HPeV1 attenuated\nthe reporter luciferase activity of type I ISRE (Fig. 6B). Consistently, IFN\u03b2 induced the mRNA\nexpression of antiviral-associated proteins such as Viperin, IRF7, PKR, MxA and\nMAVS, which was significantly inhibited by HPeV1 in A549 and T84 cells (Fig. 6C). These results\nsuggested that HPeV1 infection interfered in type I IFN signaling activation.\nThe evasion of an antiviral mechanism would be important for HPeV1 replication,\nwhich also supported the inefficient anti-HPeV1 activity with type I IFN\npost-treatment (Fig. 5A and\nB, lower panels).\n\nSimPlot analysis showed that KVP6 had high similarity with HPeV1 strain 7555312\nand SH1 but not HPeV1 prototype Harris strain. However, after the VP1 region,\nthe similarity between KVP6 and 7555312 strains decreased, with more similarity\nwith HPeV7 PAK5045 in 2C and HPeV4 K251176-02 in 3D of the nonstructural\nregions, which suggested intertypic recombination events [35,36]. The finding would\nsupport that the most frequent breaking points for recombination flanked the\ncapsid-encoding region [35,36,47]. In addition, HPeV5 and\nHPeV6 showed recombination at the viral genome P2-P3 junction, within the 2C\n[48,49]. The C-terminus of VP1\nof most HPeVs contained the RGD receptor-binding domain, which is critical for\ncell entry [11], and\nrecombination at this position could thus have important evolutionary mechanisms\nin HPeVs [35,36]. Previous reports\nindicated frequent recombination among HPeV1, -4, -5 and -6 but more restricted\namong HPeV3 strains [35];\nof interest, HPeV3 lacks an RGD motif in the VP1 C-terminus [12].\n\nViral replication kinetics indicated that viral genes were highly expressed in\n\u201ctwo-peaks\u201d at 6 and 72 hpi in A549 cells, and\n\u201cone-peak\u201d at 6 hpi in T84 cells; however this phenomenon might be\nnot related to HPeV1 production, which gradually accumulated in a time-dependent\nmanner; whether the difference depends on cell type needs to be investigated\nfurther. In addition, high incubation temperature such as 39\u00b0C,\nconsidered a febrile status in humans, might inhibit HPeV1 virion production.\nSimilar findings were reported in enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24, also\nmembers of the Picornaviridae family, in that replication was\nreduced with increased temperature [50]. In this study, we observed viral gene-expression\nshutdown with high temperature, which suggested that viral RNA replication was\nattenuated at high temperature. A possible mechanism of temperature-regulated\nviral gene replication was described in the infection of influenza A virus, a\nsingle-stranded and negative-sense genomic RNA virus. The viral polymerase is\ndissociated from the viral genome promoter at high temperature (41\u00b0C),\nwhich leads to failed genomic replication [51]. Moreover, we found that HPeV1 infectivity was\nretained at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C but impaired at 39\u00b0C incubation\nbefore cell inoculation, which suggests the instability of HPeV1 viral particle\nin elevated temperature.\n\nFollowing virus infection, antiviral innate immune responses are initiated in\nhost cells. The transcription of type I IFN, mainly IFN\u03b2, is rapidly\ninduced via cooperative binding to its promoter by three families of\ntranscription factors: NF-\u03baB, activator protein 1 (AP1) and IRF [52,53]. The secreted\nIFN\u03b2 acts on neighboring cells and activates the STAT pathway via type I\nIFN receptor to induce IRF7 expression, which may result in amplification of\ntype I IFN induction via such a positive feedback mechanism [54]. Among the members of\nIRFs, IRF3 is critically involved in the initial induction of IFN\u03b2 when\ncells are infected by viruses [54]. Although we found that in A549 cells, HPeV1 induced a sustained\nlevel of total IRF3 at both 37\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C, phosphorylated IRF3,\nthe activated form of IRF3, only emerged and lasted until late infection at\n37\u00b0C, not 39\u00b0C. From the results we just mentioned, high\nincubation temperature inhibited HPeV1 production, especially during late\ninfection. However, at 33\u00b0C, productive HPeV1 did not induce IRF3\nphosphorylation in both A549 and T84 cells. Therefore, the activation of IRF3\nmay be strongly correlated with viral load and also temperature. Our other\ninfection model showed the phenomenon of HPeV-dependent IRF3 activation [41]. Moreover, the effect\nof type I IFN against HPeV1 was inconsistent between A549 and T84 cells in that\ntype I IFN pretreatment inhibited HPeV1 infection in A549 but not T84 cells\nperhaps because of the lower sensitivity of type I IFN signaling in T84\ncells.\n\nTo establish a pathogenic infection, modulation of type I IFN activity occurs in\nmany viruses [41,44,45,55]. In particular,\npicornaviruses, such as poliovirus, enterovirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus,\nhepatitis A virus, rhinovirus, and coxsackievirus B3, can block RIG-I-, MDA5-\nand MAVS-mediated type I IFN production by viral protease activity [56,57,58,59,60,61]. Investigating the\nmechanism of HPeV1-blocked IRF3-mediated type I IFN production in T84 cells\nwould be interesting. Previous study revealed enterovirus 71 2A protease reduces\nIFN receptor 1 activity to disrupt the activation of STAT1, STAT2, Jak1 and Tyk2\n[46]. These data may\nsuggest future investigation of HPeV1 regulating type I IFN activity because we\nalso found the HPeV1 can attenuate type I IFN downstream signaling and antiviral\nprotein expression.\n\nHPeV1 KPV6 is the first isolation from Taiwan. This study supplies information\nfor understanding the genome characteristics and the fundamental infection\nfeatures of this newly isolated virus. Our findings may be beneficial for the\nHPeV1 evolution analysis, viral detection or treatment in laboratory or clinical\npractice. Furthermore, the domestic surveillance and clinical significance of\nHPeV infection in Taiwan remains to be explored. With the advent of diagnostic\ntools, evaluating the impact of HPeV infection in pediatric or even newborn\npopulations is important."}
