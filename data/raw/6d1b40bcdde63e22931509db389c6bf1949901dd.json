{"title": "Title page \u2022 Title A combinatorial biomolecular strategy to identify peptides for improved transport across the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients and the underlying epithelia \u2022 Author names and affiliations", "body": "For successful treatment of mucosal-associated diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), HIV, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it is critical for drug and gene therapies to cross several biological barriers to enter the target cells at therapeutic concentrations. One of the initial and primary barriers is the protective mucus layer lining the epithelia in the eyes, airways, gastrointestinal and cervicovaginal tracts [1] [2] [3] . Mucus is a complex biopolymer composed mainly of water, mucin glycoproteins, lipids, DNA, non-mucin proteins, salts, and cell debris [4] . The mucus layer acts as a transport barrier and can greatly hinder the diffusion of drugs, particles, and other molecules [5] [6] [7] via size filtering, mucociliary clearance, and intermolecular interactions, including electrostatic, hydrophobic, and/or other specific binding interactions [8] . For example in CF, the hyperconcentrated mucus layer traps foreign pathogens, resulting in chronic bacterial infections and concomitantly prevents up to 99% of drugs and particles from penetration needed for successful therapy [9, 10] . As a result, it is a long-standing challenge for drugs to permeate the mucus barrier and reach the underlying epithelia.\n\nConsiderable advancements have been made towards the development of different drug delivery strategies that attempt to overcome the mucus barrier, including use of mucolytic agents [11, 12] , mucoadhesive [13] [14] [15] , and mucus-penetrating [16] [17] [18] [19] delivery systems. It has been demonstrated that the use of net-neutral charge hydrophilic polymers can improve the transport of nanoparticles and minimize interactions with respiratory mucus [17, 20] , gastrointestinal mucus [21, 22] , and cervical mucus [23] [24] [25] . However, it has been estimated changing their permutation, a large molecular diversity can be achieved and leveraged to identify new surface coatings with favorable interactions for mucus-penetrating transport.\n\nIn this work, we identify peptide coatings with the ability to penetrate CF mucus using phage-assisted directed evolution and ultimately, achieve intracellular uptake in mutant CF epithelial cells. Bacteriophage (phage), or viruses that infect bacteria, have been engineered as display systems to express combinatorial libraries of up to 10 9 different peptides or proteins on their viral coat proteins (i.e. different peptide per phage), which function as a collection of surface chemistries with diverse physicochemical properties and functionalities [45] . Iteratively screening of peptide-presenting phage libraries is a powerful high-throughput method for identification of peptide coatings to a variety of targets with no known lead structures or substrates that can favorably interact with mucus for penetration and desired functionalities. The highly diverse libraries are collapsed to a few leads by performing repetitive rounds of selection against the target, or selection pressure (i.e. biopanning) [46, 47] .\n\nHere, we screened peptide-presenting phage libraries against a mucus barrier, used next-generation DNA sequencing to identify the genetically-encoded peptides from a vast sequence space, and then validated their mucus-penetration ex vivo using clinical samples from delivery strategies of drug and gene carriers across mucosal barriers and the dense mucus barrier present in disease states like cystic fibrosis, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, and asthma.\n\nThe constructed T7 phage CX7C library had a diversity (i.e. number of phage displaying unique peptide sequences) of 3.7x10 5 distinct clones, as determined by next-generation sequencing (Supplementary Table 2 ) and a phage concentration of 1.24 x 10 11 plaque forming units per mL (pfu/mL), as determined by standard double-layer plaque assay. To identify peptide-presenting phage that diffuse across the barrier, the T7 phage CX7C library was iteratively screened against a CF mucus model (Fig. 1A) . One hundred microliters of CF mucus were added on the donor side of the transwell system, which contained 600 \u00b5L of 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) on the receiver compartment. In the first round, 4.2 \u00d7 10 9 pfu of the original phage library was added on top of the CF mucus layer, and the number of phage that diffused to the receiver side after 1 hour was quantified by plaque assay. Ten microliter aliquots were also collected after 15 and 30 minutes for further analysis by high-throughput sequencing.\n\nAfter 1 hour, the entire eluate was collected, amplified (i.e. grow more copies), and was incubated on CF mucus for a second round of screening. This procedure was repeated for a total of three rounds of screening.\n\nThere was a significant 232-fold increase in the output to input of phage (C/C0) that penetrated through CF mucus from the third round compared to the first round (Fig. 1B) . This increase under selection pressure of mucus barrier suggests there is possible enrichment for clones with desired properties (i.e. mucus penetration) in CF mucus [47, 53] . Overview of the iterative phage library selection in CF mucus model. (A) A T7 phage peptide library with an initial diversity of 10 5 distinct clones is added on top of a CF mucus layer in a Transwell system (Corning, MA) and incubated in the donating reservoir with 1X PBS. Phage that penetrate through CF mucus are collected, quantified by standard double-layer plaque assay, and amplified by E. coli for use either in the next selection round or subjected to PCR and next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing. (B) Enrichment of phage plaque forming units recovered from the basolateral side over three rounds of screening (R1 to R3, n = 3), quantified by standard double-layer plaque assay (unpaired, twotailed Student's t-test, p<0.01).\n\nNext, the phage DNA from all three selection rounds in replicates was isolated, PCR amplified, and sequenced by high-throughput sequencing. For each of the samples, an average of 635,004 \u00b1 124,391 DNA sequences was obtained. From these sequences, sequences that did not encode for the CX7C peptide sequence or included stop codons before the first cysteine residue were excluded from subsequent analysis and experiments; otherwise, reads would contain a significant fraction of sequences with TAG stop codons or not display any peptide sequence. The number of unique peptide sequences in each sample decreased considerably with each subsequent round of selection (Supplementary Table 2 ), which has been observed by others [53, 54] .\n\nTo determine the distribution and abundance of peptide sequences and reproducibility (i.e. similarity between replicates) with each round of selection, we analyzed density plots of peptide frequencies (i.e. counts) (Fig. S1 ). With each successive round of selection (denoted as \n\nAll rights reserved.

Moreover, from the heat map, there is a convergence of the most frequent peptides. With each successive round of selection, the number of unique sequences decreases, and there is a convergence of abundant peptides (Fig.   S1 ), which suggests there is selection and enrichment for unique peptide sequences [47] .\n\nNext, the amino acid composition of peptide sequences from each round of selection was compared to the original library (Fig. S2) . Here, mostly hydrophobic amino acids had an overall decrease in their frequency during selection compared to the original library. There was an enrichment in glycine (G), serine (S), and in the acidic residues glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) over rounds compared to the original library. Basic residues such as histidine (H), lysine (K), and arginine (R) had an overall decrease in frequency after three rounds of selection against CF mucus.\n\nAfter high-throughput sequencing of DNA isolated from phage eluates, sequences were translated, and the top 20 most abundant peptide sequences and their physicochemical properties (i.e. charge and hydropathy GRAVY score) were calculated (Fig. 2) . The median netcharge was close to -1.0 in the three rounds; however, the interquartile range indicates there is a trend for the distribution to approach neutral charge with each round of selection. The GRAVY score gradually increased with subsequent rounds of selection, but overall, sequences were mostly hydrophilic to neutral. All rights reserved.

Of interest, peptide sequences PEPTIDE-2, PEPTIDE-3, and PEPTIDE-4 had homology to mucin 16 (MUC16), mucin 2 precursor (MUC2), and mucin 19 precursor (MUC19), respectively (Table 1) .\n\nMUC16 is a cell surface associated mucin present in the airways, salivary glands, cervix, and eyes; MUC2 and MUC19 are secreted, gel-forming mucins present either in the airways, salivary glands, intestine, cervix, and/or eyes [2] . Another sequence of interest, PEPTIDE-1, was present in the top 20 most abundant peptide sequences throughout all rounds and in sequenced replicates. The aforementioned sequences possess either slightly negative or close to neutral net charges at pH 7.0 and were close to neutral or hydrophilic as indicated by the calculated GRAVY index score ( To ensure that the frequency of identified sequences was due to screening and not growth bias, these sequences were compared to the na\u00efve library grown without selection [53, 56] . The na\u00efve phage library was amplified without any selection pressure for three rounds, and these samples were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing to identify overrepresented sequences indicative of fast growers. Selected peptide sequences from Table 1 were not amongst the overrepresented sequences present in the amplified rounds of the na\u00efve library. In addition, we compared the selected peptide sequences to databases that have identified sequences with growth bias and/or non-specific affinity, also known as \"target-unrelated peptides\" (TUP) (54, 55) ; the selected peptide sequences (Table 1) were not found in these comprehensive databases. These results indicate that selected peptides are not artefactual and can be further validated for penetrating transport through the mucus barrier.\n\nPermeation assay across CF mucus model. We performed a permeation assay in a transwell system similar to the phage screening to confirm that identified phage-displayed peptides ( Table 1) improve diffusion of phage across the CF mucus model. Each phage clone (2.0 \u00d7 10 9 genomic copies (gc)) displaying PEPTIDE-1, PEPTIDE-2, PEPTIDE-3, or PEPTIDE-4 (denoted as Clones 1-4, respectively), along with a positive charge phage control (Clone (+)) was added on top of a CF mucus layer on the donor compartment of a transwell system. Phage that diffused across the mucus layer were recovered from the receiver compartment, and the amount of phage (Q) in the eluates was quantified by qPCR. As shown in Fig. 3A , phage clones 3 and 4 permeated across CF mucus 9-and 13-fold higher, respectively, compared to the positively charged control clone (+). Clone 1 did not show improved permeation compared to control, and All rights reserved.

These findings suggest that the identified clones 3 and 4 have the ability to facilitate phage diffusion across CF mucus. Each phage clone (2.0 \u00d7 10 9 genomic copies (gc)) was added on top of a CF mucus layer on the donor compartment of a transwell system. Phage that diffused across the mucus layer were recovered from the basolateral side at 2 hours, and phage amounts (Q) in the eluates were determined by qPCR (ns, not significant, p=0.1000 for clone 4 and clone (+) in CF mucus; p=0.1371 for clone 2 and clone (+) in CF sputum). Data represents mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons was used.\n\nPermeation assay of phage-displayed peptides against pooled CF sputum from patients. Based on our permeation studies of phage-displayed peptides against CF-like mucus, we selected the best phage-displayed peptides and validated their ability to improve diffusion of phage across patient samples. Here we performed a permeation assay in a transwell system similar to the CF-like mucus permeation assay but used CF sputum from patients (n = 15) pooled together to minimize patient-to-patient variation. Phage were incubated and quantified similar to the CF-like permeation assay. As shown in Fig. 3B , phage clones 2, 3, and 4 permeated across CF sputum 590-, 375-, and 244-fold more than the positively charged control clone (+), respectively.\n\nTo determine patientto-patient differences in diffusion of phage clones validated in CF mucus, we performed a \n\nAll rights reserved.

Fig. 4 shows the amount of each clone that permeates through the sputum of individual patients. There is considerable variability in phage permeability amongst patients, regardless of phage clone used. In individual patient samples, phage that permeated was independent of the peptide sequence-all tested phage clones either diffused through the barrier or demonstrated poor permeability. This suggests that phage diffusion in CF sputum might be patient-specific and can be governed by different properties in sputum, such as composition, solids content, and pore size. . Phage clones permeation across CF sputum from individual patients. Each phage clone (2.0 \u00d7 10 9 genomic copies (gc)) was added on top of a CF sputum layer on the donor compartment of a transwell system.

Data represents mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3), Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons, not statistically significant.\n\nTo characterize the components of CF sputum that could affect phage permeation, we measured the solids content, disulfide bond (i.e. cystine), mucin, and DNA concentration, and we quantified the porosity (i.e. void area %) of CF sputum samples.

In Fig The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/659540 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nNext, we wanted to measure the diffusivities of our mucus-penetrating peptides out of structural context of phage and compare their transport with poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) chemistries of similar size scale. To compare our peptides with PEG, here we performed multiple particle tracking experiments with fluorescent carboxyl-modified 100 nm nanoparticles either conjugated with mucus-penetrating peptides or 1 kDa mPEG and measured their transport rates in CF sputum at the microscale. Based on our permeation assays using phage, two patient samples CF-00015 and CF-00021 were chosen for comparison using particle tracking.

Nanoparticles are promising carriers as for transmucosal delivery due to their ability to deliver and protect large amounts of therapeutic cargo while minimizing off-target toxicity. However, these nanoparticles must overcome the transport barriers presented by both the mucus and cell surface. The enhanced transport of nanoparticles across mucus barriers using different surface chemistries, such as hydrophilic, net-neutral polymer coatings, has been extensively demonstrated [7, 17, 20, 23, [57] [58] [59] [60] . However, even after penetration through the mucus barrier, nanoparticles must bind and enter cells to deliver their payload. Previous studies have demonstrated that the cellular uptake of nanoparticles depends on their physicochemical properties such as size, shape and surface chemistry [61] [62] [63] [64] . While existing surface coatings on nanoparticles improve mucus penetration, there are All rights reserved.

Consequently, we confirmed that our mucus penetrating peptides as surface coatings could permeate through CF sputum and achieve cell uptake. Towards this end, we incubated 1 mg/mL of fluorescent nanoparticles functionalized with mucus-penetrating peptides or mPEG in a transwell co-culture with CF sputum on the donor compartment and CuFi-1 bronchial epithelial cells in the receptor compartment for 2 hours at 37 o C, and uptake was measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 7A ). Prior to incubation in the co-culture setup, the nanoparticles were monodisperse and stable in 1X PBS and in bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM) (Supplementary Table 3 ). From the transwell co-culture assay of nanoparticle uptake, there was approximately 3-fold higher uptake of PEPTIDE-2 conjugated nanoparticles compared to non-modified, carboxylated nanoparticles and mPEG 1KDa conjugated nanoparticles (Fig. 7B ). PEPTIDE-4 conjugated nanoparticles exhibited 2.6-and 2.2-fold significantly improved uptake compared to carboxylated nanoparticles and mPEG 1kDa conjugated nanoparticles, respectively (Fig. 7B ).\n\nTo confirm that improved uptake was due to cellular uptake and not decreased delivery due to hindered diffusion through CF sputum, we tested the ability of conjugated nanoparticles to enter cells directly without permeation across CF sputum. Here, we incubated the CuFi-1 cells with 25 \u00b5g/mL of each fluorescent nanoparticle suspension for 2 hours at 37 o C and quantified uptake by flow cytometry (Fig. 7C ). As shown in Fig. 7D , CuFi-1 cell uptake of carboxylated, PEPTIDE-2, and PEPTIDE-3 functionalized nanoparticles was approximately 2.1fold higher compared to 1kDa mPEG conjugated nanoparticles. PEPTIDE-4 conjugated nanoparticles exhibited approximately 1.6-fold higher cell uptake compared to 1 kDa mPEG conjugated nanoparticles.\n\nAll rights reserved.

To address these challenges, we have developed a phage transport assay to screen T7 phagedisplayed peptide libraries in CF mucus to identify mucus-penetrating peptides as surface coatings that facilitate transport through mucus and ultimately, penetrate the affected cells. The T7 phage vector can be genetically engineered to multivalently display 415 copies of a peptide on its gp10 protein coat [65] and has size features (~60 nm diameter) on the scale of The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/659540 doi: bioRxiv preprint conventional synthetic nanoparticles. After repeated screening of T7 phage library (~10 5 diversity of random peptides) against CF mucus (Fig. 1A) , we identified phage able to transport through mucus with more than 200-fold increased output in the third round eluates compared to the first round of screening (Fig. 1B) . This increase in output is indicative of enrichment and selection of phage clones with favorable properties [47] , in this case for mucus penetration.\n\nPreviously, using a different M13 phage library against CF mucus-like reconstituted mucin, we identified phage with up to 17.5-fold improved output ratios in mucus in the fourth round of screening, and phage-displayed peptides demonstrated up to 2.6-fold improved transport in mucus compared to wild-type control (i.e. non-recombinant, insertless phage) [66] . However, this low-throughput sample size (20-100 clones) from traditional Sanger sequencing, while providing valuable information, presents a limited repertoire of the complete sequence space (less than 0.01% of available sequences), and as a result, it is likely that better performing peptides are not identified [53] . Second, the low copy display of peptides on the p3 coat of M13 (i.e. 5 copies versus 415 for T7) has a small surface area and does not allow for multiple interactions with the mucus substrate, which is needed to identify peptides that have desired weak but reversible interactions with mucus needed for penetrating transport [67] . Finally, while previous work focused on phage transport through reconstituted mucin, it is necessary to validate transport in sputum samples of CF patients; building insights from patient samples advances translational aspects in therapeutic applications of the mucus-and cell-penetrating peptide carriers.\n\nWe utilized a bioinformatics workflow to count and sort the frequencies of individual phage-displayed peptides in each eluate from the rounds of screening against CF mucus. A large diversity of peptides was observed in the output eluates in the first-round replicates (Supplementary Table 2 ), possibly due to the complexity of the sample. However, there were fewer unique peptides after each round, with a ~12-and 15-fold decrease after the second and third rounds compared to the first round, respectively (Supplementary Table 2 ). This observation All rights reserved.

These findings suggest that mucus acts as a selection pressure for unique mucus-penetrating peptides after each round of screening. From selection, a small set of mostly hydrophilic and slightly negative or close to neutral net-charge peptide sequences were selected for subsequent transport studies in patient samples (Table 1) . Of interest, three of the four discovered peptides presented homology to human mucin proteins in a basic local alignment search tool (BLASTp) database search. Sequence homology of peptide sequences to their targets have been previously reported in phage display biopanning experiments in the human vasculature, collagen, and peanut allergens, among others [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . It is feasible that mucus biomimetic peptides might shield or have less hindered intermolecular interactions with mucins [74] , enabling their diffusion across mucus, although the selected peptide sequences are small in size and may not represent a statistically significant alignment with proteins from BLASTp databases.\n\nThe combination of phage display libraries with high-throughput sequencing provided an in-depth study of the phage selection process and also the identification of the most abundant peptides sequences in each round of screenings. We determined the overall amino acid composition of the peptides from each round of selection (Fig. 3) . There was an increase in glycine, serine, and acidic residues, such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid, and a decrease in hydrophobic and basic residues, such as histidine, lysine, and arginine. The changes in amino acid composition during selection can be attributed due to intermolecular interactions (or lack thereof) between peptide substrates with mucins present in mucus. Mucins, the main nonaqueous component of mucus, are heavily glycosylated proteins with an overall net-negative charge due to high sialic acid and sulfate content [75] . Subsequently, it has been demonstrated that positively-charged molecules typically exhibit low permeability across the mucus barrier due to interactions with the glycoproteins and lipids in the mucus [9, 76] . Furthermore, the diffusion All rights reserved.

These findings suggest that hydrophobicity and charge can influence diffusion in mucus due to intermolecular interactions with mucins. Moreover, we calculated the physicochemical properties (i.e. charge and hydrophobicity) of the most twenty abundant sequences in each round of screening, and the in silico analysis indicated that the peptide pool presented mostly negative net-charge and hydrophilic sequences over rounds of selection. The prevalence of hydrophilic residues is consistent with prior work where hydrophilic polymers provided an inert surface for mucus, or \"muco-inert\", which minimizes mucin interactions for improved particle transport [17] .\n\nWe confirmed that identified phage-displayed peptides improved diffusion of phage in reconstituted CF mucus and sputum from CF patients (Fig. 5) . We pooled samples from patients to minimize patient-to-patient variability and were able to demonstrate up to ~600-fold greater permeation of the phage-displayed peptides in CF sputum, compared to the positively charged control phage clone. Since mucus has an overall negative net-charge due to the presence of carboxyl or sulfate groups on the mucin proteoglycans, it is expected that neutral to negatively charged molecules diffuse faster compared to positively charged molecules due to lack of strong electrostatic-driven binding to mucin fibers [57] . Indeed, previous studies corroborated that neutral and negatively charged nanoparticles have demonstrated higher diffusivities in mucus compared to positively charged particles [23, 78] .\n\nWe also studied transport of the identified phage-displayed peptides in sputum samples from individual CF patients. Transport through samples was dependent of the heterogeneity of mucus. It has been reported that increased solids, mucin, DNA, and disulfide bonds content reduced pore size in the sputum mesh [52, 60, 79] . Surprisingly, patients 17 and 19 showed higher amounts of solids, disulfide bonds, DNA, and mucin content, yet presented larger porosities. Those patients presented highest permeabilities of the tested phage clones. Patient All rights reserved.

Patient 21 presented a greater barrier for phage permeation, which can be explained by the combination between higher solids, disulfide bonds, DNA, and mucin content with low porosities, imposing a challenging barrier for particles and molecules to diffuse through. These findings suggest that the properties governing diffusion of particles in sputum at the microscale are patient-dependent and not controlled only by the mucus composition alone. The permeation of molecules and particles in sputum are most likely governed by a combination of factors, including mesh size, mucin concentration, and physical entanglements between mucin fibers, DNA, and disulfide cross-linking [79] . Patient heterogeneity for CF samples has been previously reported in the literature, with sample variations even between the same patient intra-day, or within the same sample [80] , which suggests that CF sputum properties at the microscale are patient-specific.\n\nOur findings motivate future studies to screen phage-displayed peptide libraries against individual CF patients for personalized medicine strategies.\n\nTo query the transport of the identified peptides in the CF sputum microenvironment, we conjugated synthetic peptides to carboxyl-modified polystyrene nanoparticles of 100 nm diameter and compared their mean squared displacement (MSD) in patient sputum with nanoparticles conjugated to mPEG 1 kDa. Recent studies have shown hydrophilic, net-neutral charge PEG polymer and polymer conjugates can improve transport of particles in CF sputum up to 90-fold compared to uncoated particles and improve therapeutic activity of antibiotics such as tobramycin against bacterial biofilms commonly associated with CF infections [17, [81] [82] [83] .\n\nHere, we used PEG 1 kDa as it is expected that similar molecular weights among peptides and PEG conjugates would experience similar steric hindrance within the mucin fiber mesh network, and potential differences in diffusivities would be mostly attributed to electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with mucus components. Interestingly, we found that the diffusion of carboxylated uncoated nanoparticles was close or sometimes better than the conjugated All rights reserved.

This could be partially attributed to the reduced size compared to the conjugated nanoparticles, since those were uncoated particles. While the addition of peptides and mPEG to carboxylated nanoparticles slightly increased the zeta-potential, the overall net-charge of all the particles remained negatively charged, which could affect diffusion of particles in CF sputum, as previously described. Nevertheless, our findings are in agreement with previous reports in the literature where 40% of uncoated carboxyl-modified polystyrene nanoparticles were able to diffuse in respiratory mucus; those results suggest that particles might be less adhesive to respiratory mucus than they are to cervical mucus, possibly due to interactions with endogenous surfactants present in the airway mucus [20] .\n\nTo measure transport of our peptide conjugated nanoparticles in individual representative patients, we selected two patients that presented similar porosities (Fig. 7E ).\n\nHowever, patient 21 showed much higher solids, DNA, disulfide bonds, and mucin content compared to patient 15, which might partially explain such differences in the MSD results. The probability of potential adhesive interactions between the tested 100 nm nanoparticles with components in sputum via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions might be augmented in patient 21 due to higher concentrations of its components. Moreover, recent studies have found that decreased diffusivity of 100 nm PEGylated nanoparticles in CF sputum correlated with decreased measured forced expiratory volume after 1 second (FEV1), the primary measurement for pulmonary function and lung disease severity in CF [79] . These data suggest that sputum may function as a greater barrier to drug delivery systems in some patients compared to others.\n\nNevertheless, we conclude that the results obtained with multiple particle tracking correlate well with the results from bulk diffusion in those individual patients tested. With patient 15, clone 2 peptide showed best transport compared to carboxylated, PEGylated, and other peptides conjugated to nanoparticles, whereas in patient 21, all tested nanoparticles exhibited transport hindered by the CF sputum.

Cellpenetrating peptides have recently demonstrated the potential to enhance the mucosal delivery of drugs and particles [84, 85] ; however these positively charged peptides form strong interactions with the negatively charged mucin glycoproteins, thereby hindering transport and actually, preventing their ability to achieve cell-penetration [86] . Furthermore, while promising, net-neutral charge polymers and polymer conjugates demonstrate improved mucus transport, they may face hindered cellular internalization and escape [16, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [87] [88] [89] , thereby dampening the enthusiasm for their therapeutic use. Hence, we confirmed the ability of our peptides to achieve both mucus penetration and cellular internalization by measuring transport of the identified mucus-penetrating peptides conjugated to 100 nm nanoparticles in a co-culture assay of CF sputum and lung epithelial cells possessing the prevalent cystic fibrosis homozygous delta F508 mutation. In CF, the three basepair deletion of codon 508 (known as F508del) results in a loss of a phenylalanine residues on chromosome 7 and is the most common mutation amongst several identified CFTR mutations [90] , with approximately 70% prevalence worldwide [91] . From our transport studies, we found that select mucus-penetrating peptides not only improved the bulk diffusion of phage in CF sputum from patients ~600-fold more than a positively charged control phage clone but also achieved up to 3-fold significantly higher cell uptake of conjugated nanoparticles compared to non-modified carboxylated-and mPEG-conjugated nanoparticles. We also found that the PEG coating significantly decreased cell uptake of nanoparticles by up to 2-fold compared to mucus-penetrating peptides-and noncoated carboxylated nanoparticles. Collectively, these results indicate that the identified hydrophilic, net-neutral charge peptides that have sequence similarity to mucins successfully traverse the complex CF sputum barrier and improve intracellular uptake of conjugated nanoparticles to lung epithelial cells.\n\nAll rights reserved.

These peptides may effectively serve as conjugates or surface modifications to potentially increase the amount of drug and drug carriers delivered to the CFTR-mutated epithelia to improve clinical outcomes. Moreover, the combination regimen using different peptide-conjugated drug carriers could be used as an alternative to reduce potential immunogenic responses over long-term, repeated administration of therapeutics [28, 92] .\n\nScreening of peptide-presenting phage libraries against samples from individual patients could be used to identify patient-specific mucus-and cell-penetrating peptides to explore personalized medicine applications. While this work focuses on mucus environment in CF, the use of mucuspenetrating peptides can be extended to develop the next generation of therapeutics to advance gene and drug delivery through various mucosal barriers, including the lung airways, eyes, gastrointestinal tract, and cervicovaginal tract.\n\nLibrary construction. A combinatorial library of heptapeptides flanked by a pair of cysteine residues displayed on T7Select415-1 phage (Novagen, WI) was constructed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, degenerate NNK-oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table 1 [95] , 0.9 mg/mL lactoferrin human [95] , 5 mg/mL sodium chloride, and 2.2 mg/mL potassium chloride to give the concentration of ions found in CF sputum [95] . The solution was adjusted with 0.5 M hydrogen chloride to pH 6.5, which is the estimated pH of CF airway mucus [96] . The reagents were transferred to a sterile tube, mixed minutes, 10 \u00b5L aliquots of the eluates were taken for further quantification. After 1 h, the entire eluate was collected from the basolateral side and titered using standard double-layer plaque assay to quantify phage concentration. The eluted phage library was amplified in BL21 E. coli (Novagen, WI) to make more copies, which was quantified by plaque assay prior to the next round of selection. Two additional rounds of selection were performed with initial amounts of 5.2 x 10 6 pfu and 4.2 x 10 9 pfu, respectively.\n\nAll rights reserved.

After the third round of selection against the CF mucus model, the eluates from 15, 30 and 60 minutes from the three rounds, and two replicates each were amplified in BL21 E. coli (Novagen, WI). In addition, the na\u00efve library (i.e. starting library) was amplified over three rounds without selection for further use as controls to account for bias due to amplification growth. Next, the amplified phage eluates were prepared for next-generation sequencing following a library preparation workflow to the manufacturer's protocol (Illumina, CA); the na\u00efve library was also similarly prepared in order to determine the diversity of the CX7C library (i.e. how many unique clones). Samples were heat for quality control checks on raw sequence data. Next, sequences were converted from fastq to All rights reserved.

For each sample, subsequences corresponding to the phage display variable region (including the C-C constrained library insert) were transcribed and translated into amino acids using a custom Python script, Medicine, Bethesda, MD). In addition, the selected peptide sequences were compared to databases encompassing previously isolated peptides known as \"target-unrelated peptides\"\n\n(TUP) motifs [97, 98] ; peptide sequences that appeared in the search were excluded from subsequent analysis. These databases have identified a large set of sequences with undesired proliferation advantages and false positive target-unrelated peptides.\n\nCloning of selected sequences into T7 phage vector. Oligonucleotides encoding the peptides of interest were designed and obtained from IDT (Supplementary Table 1 The concentration of mucin disulfide bonds (i.e., cystine) was determined as previously described [79, 99] .

Briefly, sputum samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed in a lyophilizer (Labconco, MO) for 24 hours. Samples were weighed before and after lyophilization, and their solids mass ratio was determined as the percent solids content. The data presented is the average of three independent experiments. Fluorescent dextran staining of CF sputum and porosity measurements. The void area in CF sputum (i.e., porosity) was determined as previously described, with slight modifications [79] .\n\nBriefly, 20 \u00b5L sputum aliquots were added to custom microscopy chambers prepared using 13mm diameter adhesive seal spacers (Grace Bio-Labs, OR). Next, 0.3 \u03bcl of a 10 mg/mL stock solution of 3kDa Texas red-labeled dextran (Invitrogen, CA) were added to the chamber and mechanically mixed with a pipette tip to distribute it throughout the sample. The chamber was sealed with a coverslip and equilibrated at room temperature for 1 h before imaging. CF sputum samples were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope at 63x magnification with image resolution of 105 nm/pixel. The area of the dextran-filled void space (VD) was measured using ImageJ and used to determine the porosity, which was calculated as \u03d5 = VD/VT, where VT is total area of the image (140 \u03bcm \u00d7 140 \u03bcm).\n\nDiffusion studies of phage-presenting peptide clones were performed in a 3.0 \u00b5m polyester membrane 24-well transwell across CF mucus or CF sputum from patients at room temperature (25 o C). Briefly, 100 \u00b5L of CF mucus or CF sputum was transferred to the donor compartment in the transwell system containing 0.6 mL PBS in the receiver compartment. An initial phage concentration of 2*10 9 genomic copies (gc) was added to the donor compartment on top of the CF mucus or CF sputum layer. At 15, 30, 45, 60 , and 120 minutes, the entire eluate was collected from the receiver compartment and replenished All rights reserved.

After conjugation, nanoparticles were dialyzed for 24 hours against 1X PBS using 100 kDa MWCO Float-A-Lyzer G2 dialysis membranes (Spectrum Labs, MA). Freshly prepared nanoparticle dispersions were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Zetasizer Nano, Malvern Instruments, MA). Size and zeta potential measurements were performed in water or PBS at 25\u00b0C and BEGM cell culture media at 37\u00b0C, at a scattering angle of 173\u00b0.\n\nmicroscopy experiments were performed to track the motion of nanoparticles in CF sputum.\n\nThirty-microliter sputum aliquots were withdrawn using a Wiretrol (Drummond Scientific Company) and added to custom microscopy chambers. Next, 1.0 \u03bcl of nanoparticles were added to the slide chamber and were mechanically mixed with a pipette tip to distribute the particles within the sample.

To quantify displacement of particles from real-time imaging, MPT analysis was performed using a custom-written script in MATLAB (Mathworks) based on a previously developed algorithm and detailed software package [101, 102] . Briefly, fluorescent nanoparticles had their centroids and x and y positions determined in sequential images with an intensity threshold. Background noise particles above this threshold were discarded based on particles eccentricity. The time-averaged mean squared displacement <MSD(t)> was calculated as previously described [23, 79, 103, 104] , based on particle displacement as <\u0394r 2 Transwell co-culture cell uptake assay. A co-culture diffusion experiment with CF sputum from patients and CuFi-1 cells was performed in 3.0 \u00b5m polyester membrane 24-well transwells at 37 o C and 5% CO2. Prior to co-culture, cells were seeded in the receiver compartment of a transwell at a cell density of 15,000 cells/cm 2 and grown for 24 hours. Next, 100 \u00b5L of CF sputum was transferred to the donor compartment in the transwell system, with 0.6 mL BEGM cell culture media and the CuFI-1 cell monolayer in the receiver compartment.
