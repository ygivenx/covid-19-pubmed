{"title": "Surveillance for Coronaviruses in Bats, Lebanon and Egypt,\n2013\u20132015", "body": "To the Editor: Coronaviruses (CoVs) in bats are genetically diverse, and\nevidence suggests they are ancestors of Middle East respiratory virus CoV (MERS-CoV),\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome CoV, and human CoVs 229E and NL63 (1\u20134). We tested several bat species\nin Lebanon and Egypt to understand the diversity of bat CoVs there.\n\nSamples were collected during February 2013\u2013April 2015. A total of 821 bats were\ncaptured live in their caves; sampled (oral swab, rectal swab, serum); and released,\nexcept for 72 bats that died or were euthanized upon capture. Lungs and livers of\neuthanized bats were harvested and homogenized. Caves were in proximity to\nhuman-inhabited area but not in proximity to camels.\n\nIn Egypt, we sampled 3 bat species (Technical\nAppendix 1). Eighty-two Egyptian tomb bats (Taphozous\nperforatus) tested negative for CoV. We also sampled 31 desert pipistrelle\nbats (Pipistrellus deserti) and detected an HKU9-like betacoronavirus\n(\u03b2-CoV) in the liver of 1 bat (prevalence 3.2%). From 257 specimens from Egyptian\nfruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), we detected \u03b2-CoV in 18\nsamples from 18 different bats (prevalence 7%). A murine hepatitis virus\u2013like CoV\nwas detected in the lung of 1 bat. HKU9-like viruses were detected in 5 oral, 2 lung, 5\nliver, and 5 rectal samples. Overall, 5.1% of the bats tested positive.\n\nIn Lebanon, we sampled 4 bat species. Four Rhinolophus hipposideros bats\nand 6 Miniopterus schribersii bats tested negative. One of 3\nRhinolophus ferrumequinum bats sampled was positive. We sampled 438\nRousettus aegyptiacus bats from 10 different locations and detected\nHKU9-like viruses in 24 rectal swab specimens (prevalence 5.5%). Overall, 5.5% of the\nbats tested positive.\n\nA subset of the samples (696 samples: 516 from Egypt, 180 from Lebanon) were tested for\nMERS-CoV by using the specific upstream of E quantitative reverse transcription PCR; all\ntested negative. Serum samples from 814 bats tested negative for MERS-CoV\nantibodies.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis revealed that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase\n(RdRp) genes of viruses detected in R. aegyptiacus\nbats in Lebanon and Egypt were closely related to the RdRp gene of HKU9\nCoV (Figure). Our viruses clustered in 3 groups: A,\nB, and C. Group A viruses were closely related to HKU9-10-2 virus and included viruses\nfrom Egypt. Group B included viruses from both countries and were closely related to\nHKU9-1 and HKU9-4 viruses. Group C also included viruses from both countries that were\nrelated to HKU9-3 and HKU9-5 viruses. The RdRp fragments sequenced had\n<90% nt similarity among groups A, B, and C. Within-group nucleotide similarity was\n>90%, and amino acid variability was 2%\u20134% (Technical Appendix 2). The phylogenetic tree of the N gene also\nshowed proximity of the viruses detected in our study to HKU9 viruses (Technical Appendix 1). Viruses from Lebanon\nclustered together as did the viruses from Egypt.\n\nMost of the positive samples were detected in Egyptian fruit bats. These are\ncave-dwelling species that inhabit regions of East Africa, Egypt, the Eastern\nMediterranean, Cyprus, and Turkey (5). This species is a reservoir for several viruses,\nincluding Marburg, Kasokero, and Sosuga viruses (6\u20138). The \u03b2-CoVs HKU9 and HKU10 were detected in\nChinese fruit bats (9). All but 1\nof the detected viruses were HKU9-like. However, there was enough genetic variability\nwithin the sequenced RdRp fragments to suggest the circulation of at\nleast 3 diverse groups comprising 3 different CoV species.\n\nOur detection of CoVs in oral, rectal, lung, and liver samples suggests that CoV\ninfection in those bats was systemic, although the bats were apparently healthy. One bat\nhad a murine hepatitis virus\u2013like infection. This bat was captured from a brood\nthat inhabited the windowsills of a historic building in urban Cairo. This infection\nmight have been a cross-species infection from mice to bats in the same habitat.\n\nAlthough bats rarely come in direct contact with humans, humans can come into more\nfrequent contact with bat urine and feces and, in the case of fruit bats, bat saliva\nthrough partially eaten fruits. Bats in the Middle East are not eaten for food but are\noccasionally hunted. In this study, HKU9-related viruses were detected in apparently\nhealthy fruit bat species from Egypt and Lebanon and appear to cause systemic infection.\nHKU9-related viruses are not known to cause human disease. MERS-CoV was not detected in\nbats sampled in this study. More surveillance for bat CoVs in the Middle East is needed,\nand the zoonotic potential for bat-CoVs requires further study."}
