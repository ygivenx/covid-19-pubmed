{"title": "", "body": "Peritonitis \u275a\u275a\u275a CHEMICAL PERITONITIS Chemical peritonitis results from the leakage of bile or urine into the peritoneal cavity ( Figure 62-1 ). Strictly speaking, leakage of pancreatic enzymes secondary to pancreatic inflammation or injury is also a form of chemical peritonitis, although generally it is confined to the tissues immediately surrounding the pancreas. Theoretically, the leakage of stomach or bowel content also may be considered a type of chemical peritonitis, although bacterial peritonitis is probably a more appropriate designation (see later discussion).\n\nLeakage from the abdominal portion of the esophagus, stomach, intestine, or an abscessed prostate is the usual source of bacterial peritonitis. Deep bite wounds are another potential source of bacterial peritonitis, especially in cases in which one or more large dogs attack a smaller one. Likewise, cats often sustain multiple penetrating wounds to both pleural and peritoneal cavities after being mauled by one or more large dogs.\n\nOther sources of bacterial peritonitis include (1) ischemic perforation secondary to prolonged intussusception ( Figure 62 -2), (2) ischemic perforation following bone impaction or another kind of intestinal foreign body, and (3) perforation resulting from mesenteric emboli due to aortic endocarditis.\n\nFeline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal infectious disease of young cats caused by coronavirus, which affects wild cats (cougars, lions, cheetahs, jaguars, bobcats, and lynx) as well as domestic cats. Immune-mediated vasculitis is the core pathology of FIP, which manifests itself systemically in one of two ways: an effusive or \"wet\" form and a noneffusive or \"dry\" form.\n\nThe effusive form of the disease outnumbers the noneffusive form by nearly 3 : 1.\n\nA fibrinous pleuritis or peritonitis characterizes the effusive form of the disease, often accompanied by large volumes of pleural or peritoneal fluid. Pyogranulomas of the abdominal viscera, lungs, nerve tissues, and eyes characterize the noneffusive form of the disease.\n\nThe signs of FIP are nonspecific, including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, pale mucous membranes, and loss of appetite. Medium and large abdominal fluid accumulations cause abdominal distension; similar fluid build-ups in the chest hamper breathing. The pyogranulomatous form of the disease may cause a particular organ or organ system to malfunction, but not in any characteristic way. Histologic examination is the most reliable means available for definitive diagnosis. 1\n\nThe radiology of FIP is nonspecific and highly variable, ranging from normal to massive fluid distension of the abdomen. Sonographically, the effusive form of the disease is characterized by abdominal fluid, fibrin, and adhesions. In some instances, the small intestine becomes tightly bunched, resembling a fixed linear foreign body. 2 Currently, I see very little FIP in my practice.\n\nSteatitis (yellow fat disease) is a comparatively rare dietary disease of cats in which the intraabdominal fat initially becomes inflamed and later becomes necrotic. The disease is caused by diets that contain an excessive amount of fish, particularly red tuna. Clinically steatitis is characterized by fever, lack of appetite, lethargy, abdominal pain (especially on palpation), and an elevated white cell count.\n\nThe radiographic disease indicators of steatitis are nonspecific, resembling a small to medium volume of peritoneal fluid. They include increased abdominal detail (regional or generalized) and increased abdominal density. In general, the fatter the cat, the more pronounced the described radiographic abnormalities. 3 CHAPTER 62 \u275a\u275a\u275a Peritonitis 573 "}
