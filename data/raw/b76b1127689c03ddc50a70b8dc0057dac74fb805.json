{"title": "A nine-month-old girl with respiratory failure and rhomboencephalitis CASE PRESENTATION", "body": "supportive care over the next five days. She was extubated on day 14 of admission and discharged on day 37, with residual impaired mobility of her right arm. She was seen two months after discharge with improved, but ongoing, difficulty lifting her right arm to her face, and was unable to lift her right arm above her shoulder. She is followed by physiotherapy, occupational therapy and pediatric neurology.\n\nTwelve days after admission, the viral culture from the nasopharyngeal aspirate became positive, and partial sequencing of the capsid protein, viral protein 1 gene, identified enterovirus (EV)-A71.\n\nSince the late 1990s, multiple outbreaks of EV-A71 have occurred worldwide, with a predilection for the Asia-Pacific region (1). The first cases in Canada reported to the National Centre for Enteroviruses occurred in 1994, including eight cases from Quebec. From 1990 to 2013, EV-A71 was the 10th most prevalent EV serotype, not including rhinovirus, detected within Canada in samples submitted to the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML, Winnipeg, Manitoba) (2). A combination of active (stool samples for all cases of acute flaccid paralysis) and passive (EV genotyping) samples are used by the NML. Between Jaunary 1, 2005 and December 31, 2011, 0.9% of 941 specimens positive for EV submitted to the Public Health Ontario Laboratory were positive for EV-A71 according to viral culture (3) . Another 20 cases of EV-A71 in one tertiary care pediatric centre were reported in 1998 (4).\n\nEV-A71 produces a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, including asymptomatic infection, mucocutaneous manifestations of hand, foot and mouth disease, and central nervous system (CNS) complications. The combination of rhomboencephalitis and cardiorespiratory symptoms, highlighted in the present case, are characteristic of EV-A71 (5). In a seven-year prospective study from Sarawak, Malaysia (6,7), 10% to 30% of children with EV-A71-associated hand, foot and mouth disease experienced CNS complications. Of these patients, 58% experienced brainstem encephalitis, 35% aseptic meningitis and 4% cardiorespiratory dysfunction (5-7).\n\nThe gold standard for viral detection remains isolation using viral culture. However, viral culture takes time, as illustrated by the present case. Serology for EV-A71 requires that the clinician consider the diagnosis and necessitates collection of acute and convalescent sera, which may delay diagnosis (1). Therefore, PCR has become the standard diagnostic test. Interestingly with the present case, PCR was negative, while the culture successfully led to this virus being detected. Negative PCR and positive viral culture for EV is a rare finding, occurring a few times per year, at most, based on previous experience at the Manitoba Provincial Public Health Laboratory.\n\nCurrently, multiple antiviral targets have been identified; however, there are no licensed therapies for EV-A71. In 2012, a randomized\n\nThis open-access article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (CC BY-NC) (http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), which permits reuse, distribution and reproduction of the article, provided that the original work is properly cited and the reuse is restricted to noncommercial purposes.

The present case depicts the characteristic neurotropism of EV-A71, with a combination of brainstem encephalitis and cardiorespiratory symptoms. Identification of EV-A71 in the present case was unexpected because it occurred during an outbreak of EV-D68, which has recently been linked to focal extremity paralysis (10) . Two hundred eighty-two cases of EV-D68 were confirmed between July 2014 and October 31, 2014, in samples submitted to the Canadian NML (2) . In comparison, from 1994 to 2013, only 101 cases of EV-A71 were identified at the NML (2). However, it is likely that awareness of EV-D68 prompted increased collection and submission of specimens from a wide variety of clinical scenarios.\n\nThe present case highlights the presence of EV-A71 in Canada, and the need to consider nonpolio EVs as a cause of acute flaccid paralysis and other severe CNS manifestations. Further studies are needed to determine the distribution of this emerging neurotropic virus in Canada."}
