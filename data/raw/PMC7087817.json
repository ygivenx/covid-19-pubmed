{"title": "Ten Years on: Generating Innovative Responses to Avian Influenza", "body": "Since 2006, the number of recorded H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks has declined globally, but at mid-2012 the disease was entrenched in north Africa, China, the Indo-Gangetic Plain, the Indonesian archipelago (which reports the world\u2019s highest proportion of outbreaks) and the Mekong River basin (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] 2011). Over the last 10 years there have been a large number of outbreaks, many unreported, and hundreds of millions of poultry birds have died of the disease or through culling to prevent its spread (Alexander 2007; Alexander and Brown 2009; Kawaoka 2012). In 2012, human H5N1 cases continue to be reported from Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam, countries which are either enzootically infected, or have land borders with one (WHO 2012). Sporadic and more persistent spread extends from these areas to Japan and the Koreas eastwards, and to Europe and the Mediterranean westwards (Dubey et al. 2012; Marinova-Petkova et al. 2012; Sakoda et al. 2012). A deadly human influenza pandemic involving H5N1 therefore remains possible, although international concern and funding is falling.\n\nAs of mid-2012, wealthier countries have experienced very few human infections and have contained and eliminated animal outbreaks by rapid disease detection, culling infected flocks, movement restrictions, cleaning and disinfection, and vaccination (Pittman and Laddomada 2008). Membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and avian influenza control are correlated (Pavade et al. 2011). These conventional disease control methods, designed by and for economically developed countries, are encapsulated in the World Organisation for Animal Health\u2019s (OIE) codes, standards, decisions and guidelines (cf. OIE 2012). Underlying them is a set of medicalised \u2018outbreak\u2019 narratives focused on contamination, containment, and eradication (Rosenberg 1992; Scoones and Forster 2008; Wald 2008), a framing which has resonated with national health security concerns and media interests in the developed world. From 2003, when the virus reappeared in southeast Asia, to around 2008, the response to avian influenza was consequently cast as a global emergency, and in the wake of a deadly outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emanating from Hong Kong in 2002\u20132003, manifested in significant international efforts focused on affected geographical areas, which have cost around US$1 billion annually (UNSIC/World Bank 2010). This response has reflected high income country approaches, emphasising disease surveillance, wide area and local culling, vaccination, biosecurity on farms and in supply chains, and behaviour change communications.\n\nAs enzooticity in six countries demonstrates, this approach has had limited success and \u2018unconventional\u2019 approaches to designing and implementing responses have been called for (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] 2011, xi). This paper draws on improved understandings of the epizoosis over the last 10 years to investigate how such innovative approaches might be generated. Accepting that approaches developed in economically advanced countries have proved difficult to replicate with any sustained success in poorer regions, the paper argues that social, economic, and political factors have been primary in disease persistence, and many aspects of its spread, and that these dynamics have been occluded by technically orientated, emergency responses which have focused on disease outbreaks rather than their underlying causes. In order to respond more effectively to avian influenza, it is necessary not only to examine and take into account the dynamic biology of the virus, and the wider ecological systems in which it is in action, but also the social, economic and political environments in which the pathogen and responses to it land.\n\nDoubtlessly a reframing is required in order to provide more holistic understandings and increased space for interdisciplinary approaches, but I argue that in embracing the commonalities of human and animal health, \u2018One health\u2019 concepts that consider health as an outcome of social\u2013ecological systems, and related concerns regarding animal husbandry economics, cultural practices, and the environment (Wilkinson et al. 2011; Zinsstag et al. 2011; Sims and Peiris 2012; Zinsstag et al. 2012), political dynamics, and in particular the negotiations intrinsic to the uncertainty inherent in the virus, the disease, and responses to them, need to be recognised and prioritised. Similarly, if more networked, locally embedded arrangements are to be developed, which will necessarily involve wider expertise (Scoones 2010a), diverse forms knowledge will need to engage (Parkes 2011), and political negotiations to find balances between differing goals and interests will be inevitable.\n\nThe paper first illustrates the prevalence of politics in the international reporting of avian influenza, and then outlines some ways that political dynamics have affected conventional control responses, particularly efforts focused on surveillance, the foundation of any disease understanding. Here potent national level political factors include the livelihoods of poor people, commercial agribusiness concerns, and the state of relations between people and their governments. Internationally, the health security and economic concerns of wealthy nations are also relevant, as are current shifts in global economic power and related conceptions of development. The paper next considers the current configuration of institutions and expertise arranged in response to avian influenza, and finds it ill-equipped to address or engage with the negotiations that are inherent in processes associated with formulating any \u2018unconventional\u2019 responses. In conclusion the paper suggests that it is only by adopting more open and participatory approaches, which encourage rather than suppress negotiation and debate, that any innovative responses will be generated, and that such plural, negotiated approaches offer further benefits related to equity, sustainability, democratic accountability, and managing uncertainty.\n\nAt the national level, the dynamic and often charged processes of relations between people and their governments have also adversely affected response efforts. In some cases, governments have little authority to set or implement credible policy. In Indonesia, for example, small poultry farmers have experience of a catalogue of misguided government interventions dating back over 40 years (Rusastra et al. 1988; Yusdja 1996; Yusdja et al. 2004), and particularly in the context of rising democracy, unpopular centrally determined interventions have been regularly challenged or ignored. In Thailand, as discussed above, policy was unduly influenced by business interests. In other cases, governments can ignore popular opinion and enforce ineffective policies. Few Vietnamese farmers, for example, have been consulted on any policies or plans, and have been coerced into compliance with inappropriate vaccination and culling programmes (Vu 2009). More prosaically, low commitment from some governments is understandable. Many lower income countries face more immediate and dangerous health threats than avian influenza, and building the veterinary, animal production, and laboratory infrastructures required for any effective surveillance and response systems are long-term, politically unrewarding processes.\n\nAt the international level, political dynamics are also influential. These are particularly potent in the case of avian influenza as a result of the mingling of national security concerns and more normative, development-orientated, global public health agendas. Given the human pandemic potential of the virus, and the potential economic effects of such an event, avian influenza surveillance and response efforts are easily perceived as designed primarily to benefit wealthy nations (Calain 2007a, b). Indonesia\u2019s withholding of human H5N1 virus samples between 2007 and 2009, claiming that they would be used to make vaccines unaffordable to Indonesia, made plain the nature, scale, and importance of possible contestations (Fidler 2007, 2008, 2010; Sedyaningsih et al. 2008; Elbe 2010). As global economic orders reconfigure, novel conceptions of international relations and development are emerging, remote from existing centre-periphery models (Appadurai 1996; Sivaramakrishnan and Agrawal 2003; Sassen 2007), and beyond responding to avian influenza, global authority is increasingly fragile, and increasingly subject to negotiation, even given widespread implementation of the 2005 International Health Regulations.\n\nFrom the imperatives of smallholder farming, then, to the provision of global pharmaceuticals, political, economic, and social dynamics can be seen to complicate and often confound conventional disease control methods. Acknowledging these dynamics is vital, and engagement with them is essential, if avian influenza is to be more effectively controlled. Yet, as discussed below, the current configuration of institutions and expertise, internationally and nationally, is poorly equipped to do this. With rapidly expanding, lightly regulated, poultry production sectors now linked with avian influenza incidence and persistence (Gilbert et al. 2008; Hogerwerf et al. 2010), and mixes of different farming systems with inconsistent biosecurity standards in close proximity implicated in inhibiting disease control (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] 2011), which organisations, for example, nationally or internationally, have the authority, credibility or inclination to negotiate with, or even to broker negotiations among, a food and farming industry that ranges from billion dollar turnover transnational corporations to subsistence level smallholders?\n\nSimilarly complex and intensely local negotiations around responsibilities and rewards are required if the interests and concerns of those people involved in the complex supply chains between farms and large, poorly managed live bird markets, which also have been linked with disease spread and persistence, are to be addressed; and the same holds true if more networked, locally embedded arrangements are to be developed, which engage and involve wider expertise, with the intention of encouraging more systemic styles of surveillance, and more responsive control systems better linked to local needs and concerns (Scoones 2010b). Likewise, if public and private actors are to be better co-ordinated, and if any long-term demand for disease control is to be encouraged among poultry producers, traders, governments and, perhaps most importantly, consumers, the competing goals, interests and concerns of different groups need to be recognised, along with the inevitability and importance of wide-ranging, transparent, and equitable negotiations among and between them.\n\nNone of these matters sit easily with the capacities, expertise, and mandates of the technical organisations that are currently directing, funding, and implementing the global response. At the most practical level, few of the veterinarians, virologists, and medical doctors involved at international or national levels are equipped, or inclined, to engage in political negotiations associated with poor peoples\u2019 livelihoods, corporate commercial interests, or the tectonics of geopolitical realignments, for example. More conceptually, the determinedly apolitical stance of the science that underpins the directions and capacities of the current response, which sets knowledge and power (i.e., science and politics) into separate and irreconcilable zones (Latour 1993, 2004), inhibits such considerations. Time and again, across a range of domains highly relevant to the avian influenza response\u2014international relations, science and technology, and international development\u2014misguided policies have been generated, and programmes have failed, as a result of expert technical organisations defining problems in the supposedly neutral language of science, and consequently prioritising technical solutions that exclude political, social, and economic factors (Ferguson 1990; Li 2007).\n\nA technical, science-based configuration is, however, not only challenged in accepting that political dynamics are pertinent, but is also badly positioned to act as a broker in facilitating any negotiations associated with them. Groups with both recognised domain expertise and authoritative claims to policy-relevant knowledge, can collude, even unwittingly, to promote solutions that support a technical, scientific viewpoint, and exclude others (Haas 1989, 1992); and governments, more often than not, are keen to privilege them, especially when faced with open-ended political problems such as those associated with animal and zoonotic diseases (Hinchliffe 2001; Campbell and Lee 2003; Van Zwanenberg and Millstone 2005). With deliberation framed by scientific interests and technical possibilities, and policy objectives determined by politically unaccountable representatives, transparent democratic negotiations toward publicly-orientated objectives can be inhibited, if not precluded (Jasanoff 1990; Wynne 1992, 1996; Jasanoff and Wynne 1998; Jasanoff 2004).\n\nIn the case of avian influenza, these political complexities are exacerbated by the uncertainty that is inherent in the unpredictable genetic dynamics of the virus. This uncertainty is compounded by the variable manifestations of the disease in humans and animals, and embedded and propagated in response efforts (Fish et al. 2011). In these circumstances, the current science-based configuration of the response, which is based on rationalist, reductive-aggregate approaches to risk management, is insufficient (Stirling and Scoones 2009). A risk management-based approach to surveillance, response planning, and disease control that depends on expert authorities assessing hazards, devising rational management strategies, and communicating with lay publics, fails in the face of the uncertainties that the virus and the disease present, and the ignorance that persists regarding aspects of both. Treating ignorance and uncertainty as risk, however, is not just an inadequate response to incomplete knowledge. Such processes also narrow response and policy options, limit the possibility of democratic engagement, and make scientific advice vulnerable to unacknowledged political dynamics (Stirling 2010). Professionally, institutionally, and culturally, then, the current configuration of the response is not just ill-equipped to foster or broker innovative, unconventional approaches, but actually inhibits their development.\n\nNow with ten years experience of responding to the uncertainties surrounding H5N1 avian influenza, I suggest that there are three things we know for sure. First, it is evident that if increasingly prosperous and urbanised populations are to consume increasing amounts of poultry, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 will present us not just with a long-term problem, but a permanent one. Low pathogenicity avian viruses circulate widely in aquatic wild birds and poultry, and some H5 and H7 low pathogenicity viruses have the potential to mutate to highly pathogenic ones. Furthermore, as the 2009\u20132010 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, avian viruses and swine viruses, which are subject to the same drivers of increased meat consumption and mixed farming systems, have a lively affinity. The influenza virus\u2014in birds, pigs and humans\u2014is therefore unlikely ever to be eradicated. No \u2018control at source\u2019 is possible. The best we can do is to learn to co-exist.\n\nSecond, it is now clear that a universalistic, rules-based, global approach is unlikely to generate any globally effective solutions. A science-based, technically driven response doubtlessly is effective in some places\u2014the wealthier, more industrialised nations where it was devised\u2014but the sheer variety of its consequences and effects in different social, economic, and political terrains, along with its variegated and in some cases misappropriated manifestations, suggest that a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approach is insufficient, and that enforcing such an approach is unlikely to be effective, and may even be counter-productive.\n\nThird, I suggest that it is now certain that more open and participatory approaches involving a wider range of perspectives are required, and that the inevitability of the negotiations that accompany such approaches needs to be accepted. It is only by encouraging debate that any \u2018unconventional\u2019 responses will be generated. The benefits of allowing plural, self-determined responses go beyond fostering innovation and the sustainability that accompanies democratic engagement. Accepting, or at least considering, a wider range of viewpoints reduces uncertainty. Surprises are still possible, but if as many options as possible have been considered, surprises are less likely, and in the wake of wide-ranging and open consultations, unpleasant surprises are less politically catastrophic. A more open, participatory stance also increases accountability and makes more explicit the social dynamics and political pressures acting on, and among, scientific policy advice. Opening up rather than closing down negotiations around alternative and complementary responses also brings into focus the distributive effects of any interventions. By considering who gains and who loses as a result of any interventions, or the lack of them, more equitable, and therefore more sustainable, responses can be devised.\n\nAccepting more plural approaches will involve science surrendering some of its purity, superiority and supposedly apolitical authority, but this is an essential step toward enabling more flexible responses that accept a multiplicity of perspectives and concerns, and acknowledge the mutable and contested nature of the H5N1 virus and its effects. If it is not recognised that science presents just one of many perspectives, a dangerous rigidity ensues: alternative ways of understanding are ignored, suppressed or obscured, and iterative processes of deliberation and learning, which are essential for coping with such uncertain and dynamic circumstances as those involving an influenza virus, are precluded."}
