{"title": "Estimation of Severe MERS-CoV Cases in the Technical Appendix Data", "body": "estimated as 5.5 days and travel-associated cases were tested for MERS-CoV an average of 9 days after symptom onset (12) . For durations of stay less than 14 days, we used the midpoint of the trip length categories in calculations (11) . The overall average duration of stay for travelers to KSA was then estimated by summing the durations of stay of all travelers from non-Middle Eastern countries and dividing by the total number of these travelers. Separate estimates of the average duration of stay were calculated for travelers from high-income OECD countries where possible.\n\nThe number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases among travelers to source countries was obtained from publicly available information (13) . When estimating the number of severe cases in source countries, we excluded cases among travelers that occurred among foreign residents or citizens of a source country or that were detected as a result of testing before departure from a source country (14) . We excluded these cases since foreign residents and citizens of source countries likely have different travel patterns to visitors (e.g., they may postpone travel if ill), their length of stay in their destination could be shorter than the incubation period, they may wait to seek care until they return home, and data on their travel frequency were also unavailable. MERS-CoV cases who were transported to another country for medical care were also excluded because they occurred among citizens of source countries and they are not representative of average infection risk since their travel was related to their infection status.\n\nFinally, countries' population sizes were obtained from national estimates (9,10,15-17) (Technical Appendix Table 1 ).\n\nThe cumulative number of severe MERS-CoV cases was estimated by using methods described previously (12) . First, the rate of severe MERS-CoV disease among travelers was calculated by dividing the number of detected cases among this group by their total time at risk in the source countries. Second, the cumulative number of severe cases in each source country was then estimated by multiplying the infection rate among travelers by the total person-time among the resident population according to the following formula:\n\nCumulative number of severe cases in source country X = Severe case rate among travelers to all source countries \uf0b4 Person-time of country X = number of severe cases reported among travelers returning from source countries annual number of travelers to source countries * average trip length \uf0b4 epidemic period \uf0b4 Source country X population size \uf0b4 365 \uf0b4 epidemic period = number of severe cases reported among travelers returning from source countries annual number of travelers to source countries * average trip length \uf0b4 Source country X population size \uf0b4 365\n\nHere, the \"epidemic period\" corresponds to 3.33 years (September 2012 -January 2016). Notably, the length of the epidemic period cancels in the equation and so did not affect calculations. Our estimates of the cumulative number of severe MERS-CoV cases are for the period September 2012, when MERS-CoV was first identified, through January 2016. As described elsewhere, the average rate used by the formula can give appropriate estimates of the cumulative incidence of disease even if the rate of infection varies over time as long as the persontime at risk is uniformly distributed over the outbreak (18) . The calculation assumes that the disease rate is the same across source countries. Analyses using country-specific disease rates could be performed with larger numbers of travel-associated cases. 95% confidence intervals were calculated by using profile-likelihoods (19) . Matlab 2014a was used for statistical analyses.\n\nTo determine whether levels of surveillance for MERS-CoV differed between travelers' home countries, we compared the frequency with which MERS-CoV cases have been identified in high-income OECD countries versus all other non-Middle Eastern countries. We only included cases that were identified by using passive surveillance since these better reflect surveillance capacity than cases that were identified because authorities were alerted to the arrival of a possibly MERS-CoV infected person by officials in a source country. Infections that occurred among residents or citizens of source countries which were identified in non-Middle Eastern countries were included in this analysis since the goal was simply to compare rates of passive surveillance between groups of non-Middle Eastern countries. There were 10 such MERS-CoV importation events identified in high-income countries compared to 8 importation events detected in lower-income countries from September 2012 -January 2016 (Technical Appendix Table 1 ). The total number of air travelers to each group of destination countries from source countries was obtained from published estimates (8) . There was a significant difference in the frequency of detection of cases between groups of countries (p < 0.001 by Fisher exact test).\n\nIt was unclear whether travel-associated cases with unconfirmed infection or who were possibly infected by another traveler should be included. For example, a second Dutch case was found after a contact investigation of an index case (20) , but it was unclear where the second case's infection occurred and whether they acquired it from the index case. Consequently, the second case might not provide independent information on the size of the MERS-CoV epidemic in KSA. Additionally, 2 probable, but unconfirmed, MERS-CoV cases occurred in late 2013 among travelers returning from KSA to Spain (21) , and both belonged to the same tour group making it unclear whether they were potentially separate infections or if one could have infected the other. These persons were included in sensitivity analyses for all high-income countries as well as for estimates calculated by using data from all non-Middle Eastern countries.\n\nWe conducted an additional sensitivity analysis to highlight how the results depend on estimates of travelers' average lengths of stay in the source countries. To do so, we recalculated the expected number of severe MERS-CoV cases across source countries using a range of average durations of stay of travelers from OECD countries and all non-Middle Eastern countries from 2 days below the point estimates obtained from countries' visitor data to 2 days above the point estimates (Technical Appendix Tables 2-3) . (3, 4) . Therefore, we produced conservative estimates of cases by including all travelers in the \"Other Europe\" and \"Other South Asia\" countries for Dubai. For Abu Dhabi, the top 25 countries of origin for travelers were listed in official statistics (4) . Therefore, we conservatively assumed that the number of travelers from each of the unlisted countries was equal to the number of visitors from the 25 th placed country. **An additional case-patient was detected in the Republic of Korea (which was classified as a high-income country) but whose source country of infection was unclear (23). This case was included in the analyses of high-income countries and also of all non-Middle Eastern countries combined.\n\n\u2020 \u2020Travel-associated cases that occurred among residents of the Middle East were included only in analyses comparing the rates of passive detection of importation events between high-income and other countries. Additional such cases were as follows: high-income countries -1 case in Austria (24), 1 case in Greece (25), 2 cases in the United States (24,26); lower-income countries -1 case in Turkey (27) , and 2 cases in Thailand (28,29). A MERS-CoV case was also identified in a person who sought treatment in Germany for a respiratory infection (30) . Our results for the difference in detection rates between high-income vs. lower-income countries were strengthened when this case was additionally included in analyses. "}
