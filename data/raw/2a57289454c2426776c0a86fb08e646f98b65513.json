{"title": "Knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive precautions among Hong Kong students during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic", "body": "Influenza A (H1N1) infection is associated with significant economic costs and deaths. 1 H1N1 transmits from person to person mainly through coughing, sneezing, and close body contact. 2 Staying vigilant by adopting appropriate preventive precautions, such as washing hands and wearing masks, is of crucial importance, especially for vulnerable individuals, such as children and elderly adults. 3 The first confirmed H1N1 case in Asia was identified on May 1, 2009 , in Hong Kong. The first community H1N1 case and first H1N1-related death in Hong Kong were reported on June 12, 2009, and July 10, 2009, 4 respectively. Perceptions and behaviors related to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic have been investigated in the Hong Kong general population, 5,6 but data for students are not available. The present study investigated the knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive precautions of H1N1 in Hong Kong students during the 2009 pandemic.\n\nA convenience sample of 288 Hong Kong secondary school students (aged 14-18 years) was surveyed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (May 12-22, 2009) with a response rate of 98%. The students reported their demographic information (sex and age) and knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive precautions regarding H1N1. All participations were voluntary, and informed consent was obtained from each participant. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the University Ethics Committee.\n\nThe students were provided with a symptom checklist (yes/no answers) on which to indicate the presence of influenza symptoms, including headache, muscle pain, cough, difficulty breathing, dizziness, sore throat, chills, and fever, within the previous 14 days. They were also asked about experiencing influenza in the previous 14 days. Specific questions assessing knowledge of the major routes of H1N1 transmission included the following: (1) \"Do you think H1N1 could transmit via the airborne route?\"; (2) \"Do you think H1N1 could transmit via water?\"; and (3) \"Do you think H1N1 could transmit via body contact?\" with responses of \"agree/ disagree/not sure.\" An indication variable (1 item/2 items/all 3 items) was created to determine the number of correct answer (agreeing with the statements) regarding knowledge of routes of H1N1 transmission. Risk perception assessment included perceived risks of H1N1 infection, perceived risks of H1N1 infection compared with the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic, and perceived risks of H1N1 infection compared with the 2007 H5N1 pandemic.\n\nAdoption of the following preventive precautions during the H1N1 pandemic was investigated: (1) washing hands with soap or alcohol pad, (2) washing hands immediately after sneezing or coughing, (3) washing hands after contacting contaminated objects, (4) covering mouth when coughing or sneezing, and (5) wearing a mask. The number of preventive precautions reported by the student was then recorded (0-1 item/2-3 items/4-5 items). The regression models revealed that adoption of 4-5 preventive precautions was significantly related to female sex (adjusted OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.47-4.16) and correct answers to all questions about knowledge of the major routes of H1N1 transmission (adjusted OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.39-4.17) ( Table 1) . A high absolute perceived risk of H1N1 infection (adjusted OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.10-2.98), but not a comparative perceived risk of H1N1 infection, was significantly associated with adoption of most preventive precautions.\n\nIn general, Hong Kong students have poor knowledge of the major routes of H1N1 transmission. Most students also perceived a lower risk of H1N1 infection compared with the 2003 SARS and 2007 H5N1 pandemics. The prevalence of mask wearing in these students was lower than that in Hong Kong and Singapore university students during the H1N1 pandemic. 7 Female students were more likely than male students to adopt preventive precautions, likely related to the higher perceptions of H1N1 risk reported by females. 8 Furthermore, adoption of H1N1 preventive precautions was associated with better knowledge of transmission and perceived high risks of infection, as found in the Western 9 and Chinese 10 general populations.\n\nThe results of this research should be interpreted with caution. The participating schools might not be representative of the Hong Kong school-age population, and generalizing the results to other countries may not be appropriate. Nevertheless, Hong Kong students represent a unique population that experienced both SARS and H5N1 outbreaks before the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Thus, our findings are of value to those devising and evaluating strategies to combat future global pandemics. Another limitation of this study is the self-reported nature of the data. However, our internal validity test demonstrated a significant and positive correlation between the number of influenza symptoms and experiencing influenza in the previous 14 days.\n\nIn conclusion, our data indicate that most Hong Kong students have insufficient knowledge of H1N1 infection and failed to adopt sufficient preventive precautions during the H1N1 pandemic. Health education programs focusing on prevention of infectious diseases are warranted. "}
