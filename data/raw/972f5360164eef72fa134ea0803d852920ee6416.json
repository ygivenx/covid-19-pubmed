{"title": "Construction of a Large Na\u00efve Human Phage-Displayed Fab Library Through One-Step Cloning", "body": "Since the invention of phage-display technology, phage-displayed antibody libraries have been successfully used as important sources and tools for development of fully human antibodies and antibody-based therapeutics mostly against cancer, and also against other diseases including infectious diseases and immune disorders. The first phage-displayderived antibody drug (Humira \u00ae ) against human TNF-alpha is now in clinical use for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Cohen's disease, and ankylosing spondylitis (1) (2) (3) . Hundreds of other phage-display-derived human antibodies are in preclinical development and dozens in clinical trials. Design and construction of large high-quality phage-displayed antibody libraries, as the one described below, will continue to be of central importance for the successful selection of good high-affinity antibodies. Although the generation of such libraries is a long and labor-intensive process it is still cost-effective in comparison to other methodologies for identification of antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies like, for example, the generation of transgenic mice with human immunoglobulin genes.\n\nIgG isotype. IgM antibody libraries are preferred as non-immune libraries with high diversity, while IgG-based libraries are typically biased to particular antigen(s). An added benefit is that IgM antibody gene repertoire has been also shown to contain self-reactive antibodies (8) , which is important in case of targeting cancer cells overexpressing a given membrane protein. Numerous examples have already shown that high-affinity human antibodies against a panel of antigens ranging from viruses to human self-antigens can be isolated from the phage-display antibody library described below which is based on an IgMderived antibody gene repertoire (9) (10) (11) (12) . This protocol describes the construction of a large na\u00efve phage-displayed Fab library through one-step cloning: SfiI is used as the cloning enzyme, which can keep almost all the antibody gene repertoire intact during the cloning procedure. Simplified procedures for library panning and Fab preparation are detailed when needed.\n\nFull coverage of the antibody gene repertoire and large size are crucial for a high-quality phage-display antibody library. To cover each subfamily of the human antibody genes, carefully selected primers matching the conserved N-terminal and C-terminal region of heavy-chain and light-chain were used for the amplification of each family separately. To avoid the loss of diversity of the gene repertoire, enough of the DNA template input should be used at each overlapping PCR; also limited cycles of amplification should be avoided to prevent from introducing bias in the final library. The efficacy of DNA transformation into bacteria has always been the limiting step for constructing large libraries, electroporation has been frequently used to make large bacterial libraries due to its high efficacy; still the DNA preparation for electroporation should be always optimized to reach high transformation efficiency.\n\nAs the easiest source for antibody gene cloning, peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors can be used. Isolate B lymphocytes from total of 2 l of blood from 10 donors on a Ficoll-Pacque gradient following the Manual of the manufacturer.\n\nDissolve the cell pellet immediately in 50 mL of Qiazol (see Note 1). Isolate total RNA following the instructions from RNeasy Mini Kit with optional step to eliminate the genomic DNA (see Note 2).\n\nFreeze the total RNA in water at \u221280\u00b0C for short-term storage. Vacuum-dried RNA should be prepared for long-term storage.\n\nIn order to completely recover the entire antibody gene repertoire, prepare cDNA with both random hexamer and Oligo dT as primer; 250 \u00b5g of total RNA for each primer with Superscript\u2122 III first-strand Synthesis System from Invitrogen can be used. 3. Mix and concentrate the cDNA from the two reactions by filtering (filter with molecular mass cutoff size 10 kDa) and store in 100 \u00b5l of water at \u221280\u00b0C freezer (see Note 3).\n\nOligonucleotides used for primary PCR amplification of human heavy-and lightchains are described in Table 6 .1 and can be synthesized by any service provider.\n\nFirst obtain IgM-derived heavy-chain variable regions by a primary PCR with a HuIgM Reverse primer and separate VH FOR primers.\n\nRe-amplify the VH fragments with a combination of JHR primers, annealing to the 3\u2032 end of VH, and separate VH FOR primers, annealing to the 5\u2032 end of corresponding purified PCR product; 150 ng of purified DNA fragment can be used as template in a 100-\u00b5l reaction volume (see Note 4).\n\nAmplify CH1 fragment of IgG1 for the overlap PCR from vector pComb3X, using primer CH1F and primer FlagR in the PCR.\n\nTo obtain the Fd fragment, perform overlap PCR with 100 ng of purified VH and CH1 fragments in 5 \u00d7 100 \u00b5l PCR reactions (7 cycles of 30 s at 94\u00b0C, 30 s at 50\u00b0C, and 2 min at 72\u00b0C without primer and another 15 cycles with primer VHF and FlagR) (see Note 5).\n\nAmplify light chains (kappa and lambda families) by PCR with a set of C\u03ba reverse or C\u03bb reverse primer annealing to the 3\u2032 end of the constant domain and Sfi-tagged FOR primers, priming at the 5\u2032 end of the VL-regions.\n\nPerform PCR in a volume of 100 \u00b5l using High-Fidelity PCR Master\u2122 and 500 pM of each primer for 28 cycles (1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 55\u00b0C, and 2 min at 72\u00b0C); nine separate IgM-derived VH amplifications can be generated with 3 \u00b5l cDNA (equivalent to 6 \u00b5g of PBL RNA) as template for each reaction.\n\nFor the light-chain families, six different kappa-chain products and 11 lambdachain products can be obtained and mixed from each family and gel-purified.\n\nFor the preparation of linker between light chain and heavy chain, primer linkerF and primer linkerR should be used. Purify all amplified products from agarose gel with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit and determine the DNA concentration through spectrophotometer measurement.\n\nFuse the heavy-chain and light-chain by three-fragment overlapping PCR using 100 ng of each gel-purified light chain and heavy chain and the same molar amount of linker in 5 \u00d7 100 \u00b5l reactions.\n\nPre-amplify the full-length Fab insert without flanking primers for nine cycles of 30 s at 94\u00b0C, 30 s at 50\u00b0C, and 3 min at 72\u00b0C, and then amplify the full-length Fab insert for another 15 cycles with the flanking primers SfiF and FlagR under the same conditions (see Note 5).\n\nFor the construction of the Fab library, gel-purify the overlapped PCR products containing the light chains and heavy chains prior to and after digestion with SfiI.\n\nDigest the vector with SfiI restriction enzyme and gelpurify it following the instructions of the manufacturers (see Note 6).\n\nLigate gel-purified fragments (8 \u00b5g with kappa light-chain and 6 \u00b5g with lamda light-chain) into 8 \u00b5g and 6 \u00b5g of SfiI-digested and gel-purified phagemid vector pComb3X in 500-\u00b5l reactions, respectively.\n\nChange the DNA buffer system to pure water using Micron filter with a 50 kDaD cutoff size, and further concentrate to appropriate volume through DNA vacuum concentrator (see Note 7).\n\nElectroporate the two desalted ligation mixtures into competent TG1 bacteria with the Gene Pulser System II; mix 100 \u00b5l of the total DNA-ligated preparation with 1.5 ml of TG1-competent cells, distribute into 60 aliquots, and put each one into 0.1-cm cuvette, then electroporate using the pre-set program with setting at 1.8 kV/ 200 ohms/25 \u00b5F. 5 Pre-amplification of the two fragments without flanking primers to fuse the full-length heavy-chain fragment is crucial for the specific amplification with primers later on. And also longer cycles than 15 after the adding of primers could create a lot of unspecific amplification; optimization of the PCR conditions such as DNA input amount and number of cycles at each stage is strongly suggested at this step. 6 Plasmid or gel-purified DNA with high quality is very important for complete digestion with SfiI. Preparation of the vector using plasmid containing full-length Fab insert is essential to monitor the complete digestion on agarose gel and purify the complete cut vector from the uncut. Longer flanking sequences beside the SfiI site on the insert are necessary for efficient digestion and better differentiation of the digested product from the uncut fragment on the agarose gel. 7 Avoiding the regular phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol-salt precipitation at this step can dramatically improve the electroporation efficacy.\n\nSpread transformed bacteria on 16 large 2YT agar plates (24 cm \u00d7 24 cm) supplied with 100 \u00b5g/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose, and incubate at 37\u00b0C overnight.\n\nScrape the bacteria from the plates with 2YT-Amp-Glu medium (2YT medium containing 100 \u00b5g/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose) to get 250 ml of suspension and divide into three parts for library stock preparation (see Note 8).\n\nAdd glycerol to a final concentration of 25% to one part of the bacteria and freeze aliquots of 2 ml at \u221280\u00b0C as bacterial library stock.\n\nGrow the second part of the bacteria to 100-fold larger number of bacteria in 2 l of the 2YT-AMP-GLU medium at 37\u00b0C for several hours until OD at 600 nm reaches 0.8.\n\nAdd M13KO7 helper phage at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 to the bacteria and incubate at 37\u00b0C for another 30 min.\n\nSpin down the bacteria infected with helper phage, resuspend the bacterial pellet into 2 l of 2YT medium supplied with 100 \u00b5g/ml ampicillin and 25 \u00b5g/ml of kanamycin, and grow the bacteria at 30\u00b0C overnight with shaking at 250 rpm.\n\nSpin down the bacteria at 8000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, add \u00bc volume of PEG/NaCl solution into the collected supernatant and incubate the mixture on ice for 1 h. Use 50 ml of PBS per liter of culture to resuspend the phage pellet after centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min. Perform another round of centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min to eliminate the bacterial contamination in the phage pellet.\n\nRepeat the phage precipitation with PEG/NaCl to further purify the phage and resuspend in the same volume of PBS (see Note 9), add glycerol to a final concentration of 50% and freeze at \u221280\u00b0C 1-ml aliquots for long-term storage as phage library stock.\n\nGrow the third part transformed bacteria in 1 l of 2YT-Amp-Glu medium at 37\u00b0C with shaking for 1-2 h to revive the bacteria.\n\nSpin down the bacteria and extract the plasmid using the Maxi plasmid kit for plasmid library stock preparation.\n\nFreeze aliquots containing 50-\u00b5g plasmid DNA library stock at \u221280\u00b0C for longterm storage. 8 Storing the library in different formats is important to preserve the valuable antibody library source for long term. The plasmid stock is the most stable format while the phage library stock can be directly and easily recovered for library panning. 9 Two-time PEG/NaCl precipitations are needed to further purify the phage library from bacterial contaminates and also soluble antibody fragment or bacterial proteins and possible proteinase contamination.\n\nWeigh out the required quantity of beads (15 mg beads is equivalent to 10 9 beads) and wash the beads three times with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Make a homogeneous suspension of the washed beads in the same buffer.\n\nAdd the calculated amount of ligand solution to the bead suspension. Mix the suspension well before adding the calculated ammonium sulfate stock solution (3 M ammonium sulfate).\n\nIncubate for 16-24 h at 37\u00b0Cwith slow tilt rotation (see Note 10).\n\nPlace the tube on the magnet for 4 min for magnetic separation. Carefully turn the magnet (with the tube in place) upside-down twice, to ensure collection of any beads that might remain in the cap. Remove the supernatant.\n\nWash the coated beads four times with PBS or PBS with blocking protein.\n\nBlocking protein like BSA or skimmed milk powder should be added at 0.1%-0.5% when this does not interfere with your downstream application.\n\nIf the downstream application involves elution steps, physically adsorbed ligand can be removed by washing for 10 min in 0.5%-1% (w/v) Tween 20/Triton X-100 or similar nonionic detergent.\n\nResuspend the coated beads to the desired concentration in PBS or PBS with blocking protein. The beads are now ready for use.\n\nPick single colony from the TG1 bacterial plate and grow the bacteria in 3 ml 2YT medium at 37\u00b0C until OD 600 \u2248 0.9 and store at room temperature for phage infection later.\n\nAt the same time, thaw a phage library aliquot. Precipitate the phage library with 250 \u00b5l (1/4 of the phage suspension volume) PEG/NaCl solution (20% PEG8000 and 2.5 M NaCl) and incubate on ice for 30 min followed by spinning the precipitated phage for 10 min at 10,000 g. Discard supernatant and resuspend the phage pellet in 200 \u00b5l PBS.\n\nAdd 100 \u00b5l 4% MPBS to the 200 \u00b5l phage library and then add 150 \u00b5l suspension of antigen conjugated to magnetic beads (~3 \u00d7 10 7 beads with about 7 \u00b5g pure antigen).\n\nIncubate on a rotator at room temperature for 2 h followed by washing the beads 10 times with 1 ml 0.05% PBST (0.05% Tween-20 in PBS).\n\nResuspend the final pellet of magnetic beads in 100 \u00b5l PBS and keep 10 \u00b5L of beads suspension from the panning for long-term storage and monoclonal phage preparation for ELISA screening later on (see Note 11) . Directly mix the rest 90 \u00b5l of the suspension into 2 ml TG1 cells prepared earlier, incubate the mixture at 37\u00b0C\n\n10 Incubation at temperatures down to 4\u00b0C may be used for temperature-sensitive ligands, but be aware that the bond formation is slower and less efficient at low temperatures, and an additional 24 h should be used to ensure covalent coupling. Do not let the beads settle during the incubation period. 11 One of the advantages for panning on beads but not on plates or in immune tubes is that there is no need to elute the phage from the bound antigen on beads; phage bound to beads can stably stay in PBS for long-time storage and also the beads do not interfere with the infection of the bacteria by the phage.\n\nwith shaking for 1 h and then dilute into 10 ml 2YT medium containing 25 \u00b5g/ml ampicillin and 1 % glucose (see Notes 12, 13).\n\nAfter two more hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm, add ampicillin to a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/ml. Let the bacteria grow until OD at 600 nm reaches 0.1, add calculated M13KO7 helper phage into the amplified TG1 cells with MOI of 10 and incubate at 37\u00b0C for another 30 min.\n\nSpin down the helper phage-infected bacteria, resuspend the mixture pellet in 1 ml 2YT medium and remove the beads through magnetic absorption. Dilute the resuspended bacteria into 50 ml of 2YT medium supplemented with 100 \u00b5g/ml ampicillin and 25 \u00b5g/ml kanamycin and incubate at 30\u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm overnight for phage amplification.\n\n8. Refer to Section 3.6.3 for phage preparation; two times PEG/NaCl-precipitated phage is ready for the second round of panning.\n\nPrepare 2YT medium with 0.2% glucose and 100 \u00b5g/ml ampicillin and add 100 \u00b5l medium to each well of 96-well plate.\n\nPick single colony and add to each well from TG1 cells infected with bead-bound phage after panning. Incubate the 96-well plates at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm until OD 600 reaches 0.5. It usually takes about 2 h.\n\n3. Add 10 9 helper phage in 25 \u00b5l 2YT medium per well. For one 96-well plate prepare 10 11 phages in 2.5 ml 2YT medium containing only 100 \u00b5g/ml ampicillin (Do not add glucose at this stage).\n\nAfter adding the helper phage, incubate for 30 min at 37\u00b0C for the infection to complete. Add 50 \u00b5l of kanamycin and ampicillin in 2YT medium to make a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/ml for ampicillin and 25 \u00b5g/ml for kanamycin. Do not add glucose at this stage.\n\nGrow the phage at 30\u00b0C in a shaker overnight -from 12 h to 15 h.\n\nSpin the plates at 3000 rpm for 15 min. Transfer the phage in the supernatant to target antigen-coated ELISA plates for phage ELISA screening; positive binding can be detected by HRP-conjugated anti-m13 phage antibodies.\n\nSelect positive clones for plasmid extraction and DNA sequencing. Select clones with unique sequences for soluble Fab preparation and characterization. \n\nInoculate 200 ml of 2xYT medium containing 100 ug/ml of ampicillin and 0.2% glucose with single colony from the freshly transformed plate. Incubate at 37\u00b0C in a shaker (250 rpm) until OD at 600 nm reaches about 0.5-0.8 (see Note 15) . 12 A volume of 2 \u00b5l of the infected bacteria at this step can be diluted and plated on 2YT agar plate supplemented with ampicillin and glucose to calculate the output number for monitoring the panning enrichment later on. 13 Low ampicillin concentration at this stage allows the antibiotic activity of the infected bacteria to recover while inhibiting the growth of the uninfected bacterial. 14 Whenever possible, always use freshly transformed bacteria for Fab expression, since even overnight storage of transformed bacterial colony at 4\u00b0C can dramatically decrease the production yield.\n\nInduce the culture by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and incubate at 30\u00b0C in a shaker (250 rpm) overnight.\n\nSpin down the bacteria at 9000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Resuspend the bacterial pellet in 50 ml of PBS per liter culture supplemented with 0.5 million units polymixin B (see Note 16) and incubate at room temperature for 30 min with rotation.\n\nSpin down the cellular debris at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube.\n\nPurify the 6-histidine-tagged Fab by using Ni-NTA resin: wash the Ni-NTA with at least 10 ml PBS to eliminate the ethanol. Add 0.3 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazol to the supernatant. Mix well and incubate at room temperature for 10 min before loading onto column. Wash the column with at least 10 ml of PBS containing 0.3 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazol (washing buffer). Elute the Fab with two portions of 1 ml PBS containing 200 mM imidazol from the Ni-NTA resin."}
