{"title": "Effects of awareness diffusion and self-initiated awareness behavior on epidemic spreading -An approach based on multiplex networks", "body": "The outbreaks of diseases can involve the diffusion of information in regard to the diseases, including the risk of infection, rumors, fears and so on, which can stimulate individuals to take spontaneous behavioral responses to protect themselves, thereby bring profound impacts on the spreading of disease [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . For example, recent outbreaks of the H1N1 flu, the bird flu, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have brought the reduction of going out and the plenty of people wearing face masks. For this reason, there has been an increasing focus on the development of formal models aimed at investigating the interplay of epidemic spreading and information-based behavioral responses [7] [8] [9] [10] . Such as, based on the assumption that the probability of susceptible individual going to the alter state is proportional to the number of infected neighbors, Sahneh et al., extended the SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model to a Susceptible-Alter-Infected-Susceptible (SAIS) model [11, 12] , and they found that the way of behavioral response can enhance the epidemic threshold; Meloni et al. studied a meta-population model that incorporates several scenarios of self-initiated behavioral changes into the mobility patterns of individuals, and they found that such behavioral changes do not alter the epidemic threshold, but may produce a negative impact on disease, i.e., the density of infection is increased [13] ; In Refs. [14] [15] [16] , authors investigated the effects of the information-based behavioral responses on the epidemic dynamics by designing the transmission rate as a function of the local infected density or the global infected density.\n\nThough the effects of information-based behavioral responses on the epidemic dynamics have been studied by many authors, most of works assumed the spreadings of information and epidemic are in the same network. As we know, with the development of technology, information can fast diffuse through many different channels, such as, the word of mouth, news media, online social networks, and so on. In view of this, recent well-studied multiplex network theory has been used to mimic the interplay of information or related awareness and the epidemic dynamics [17] [18] [19] [20] . For instance, Sahneh et al., have shown that the information dissemination spread in another network can help boost the resilience of the agents' population against the spreading and found optimal information dissemination for different topologies [21] ; Wang et al., investigated the interplay of the epidemic dynamics and the information dynamics in multiplex network based on the SIR (R-recovery) model, and focused on the two fundamental quantities underlying any spreading process: epidemic threshold and the final epidemic prevalence [22] ; Granell et al., established an SIS-UAU model to investigate the competing effects of the spreading of awareness and the epidemic dynamics in multiplex with the transmission rate of awareness as well as the structure of information network [23] . More recently, they further generalized their model by reducing the probability of infected individuals becoming awareness and including the effect of a mass broadcast of awareness (mass media) on the epidemic dynamics [24] .\n\nIn Refs. [23, 24] , authors assumed that susceptible individuals can only be informed by other aware neighbors. In reality, individuals may become aware (i.e., self-initiated awareness) when they find that their neighbors are infected. Inspired these factors, in the current work, we study the interplay between the diffusion of awareness by incorporating the self-awareness effects and the epidemic dynamics under the framework of multiplex network. In the model, an infectious disease first spreads among population represented by the contact network, and then the outbreak of the disease stimulates some people (infected or susceptible individuals) become aware of the risk of infection, and they take some protections to reduce the probability of infection. Meanwhile, unaware individuals can be informed by other aware individuals through the information network or become self-awareness induced by the infected neighbors in contact network or mass media. The finding indicates that the additional self-initiated awareness mechanism can reduce the density of infection, however, which can not alter the epidemic threshold. Moreover, we show that since the hub nodes in information networks are easier to be informed, which can much lower their infection probability in contact networks. The results are verified by the Monte-Carlo simulations and the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA).\n\nThe layout of the paper is as follows: we introduce the model in Section 2 . The simulation results and theoretical analysis are presented in Section 3 . Finally, Conclusions and discussions are presented in Section 4 . The results for the global information-based self-initiated awareness are given in Appendix A .\n\nIn this work, we generalize the model of Ref. [23, 24] . In that model, a multiplex network includes two layers, one is physical layer representing the spreading of epidemic (contact network), and the other is information layer on where the diffusion of the awareness evolves (information network). All nodes represent the same individuals in both layers, but the connectivity is different in each of them. In the contact layer, a Susceptible -Infected -Susceptible (SIS) model is used to mimic the epidemic dynamics. That is to say, a susceptible node can be infected by one infected neighbor with certain probability, and the infected node can return to susceptible state with probability \u03bc. On the information layer, the dynamical process of awareness is assumed to be similar to the SIS model, that is, an unaware node (U) can be informed by an aware neighbor (A) with probability \u03bb, and the aware node can loss awareness and back to unaware state with probability \u03b4. The interplay of the two processes is modelled as follows: once an individual is infected, s/he will certainly become aware, that is, the probability is \u03c3 = 100% . In addition, to distinguish the protective behaviors between the aware individuals and unaware individuals, let \u03b2 and \u03b2 A = \u03b3 \u03b2 (here 0 \u2264 \u03b3 < 1. If \u03b3 = 0 , the aware individuals are completely immune to the infection.) be the probabilities of unaware and aware susceptible nodes to get infected, respectively.\n\nFrom the description of the model, one can find that, on the one hand, the authors assumed that the infected individuals will automatically become aware and are willing to inform the disease information. As we know, in many cases, infected individuals are unwilling to tell others since they can be discriminated or isolated by others once others know they are infected by one certain disease. For example, if one person is infected by AIDS or hepatitis B, who may be alienated by his friends. So we assume that infected individuals becoming aware with probability 0 \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 1. On the other hand, in the model, individuals can only be informed by their neighbors through the information network, that is to say, one individual has no chance to become aware once their neighbors are unaware. However, individuals can become self-awareness once their friends are infected or they are informed by the mass media, and the probability of becoming awareness increases IU and IA recovers to SU and SA, respectively, with the same probability \u03bc; The left (right) flow is the awareness process for the susceptible (infected) individuals, respectively. SU can go to SA with a probability \u03bb of being informed by an aware neighbor through information network, or induced by the infected neighbors in contact network with a probability \u03ba. SA recovers to SU with a probability \u03b4. IU can go to IA by informed the aware neighbors in information layer with a probability \u03bb, or self-awareness with a probability \u03c3 , which is not related to the neighbor's states. SA and IA can become unaware and return to SU and IU with the same probability \u03b4.\n\nwith the number of infected people [12] . Thus, in our model, we assume that, for a susceptible individual, besides being informed by the aware neighbors in the information network, which can also self-awareness when contacting one infected neighbors in contact network, the probability is represented by parameter \u03ba. Note that, for the original model in Ref. [23] , awareness cannot break out if the probability \u03c3 = 0 , so the roles of awareness cannot be played, however, in our model, the awareness can diffuse among population even though \u03c3 = 0 since susceptible individuals can become aware by their self-initiated responses.\n\nAccording to this scheme, an individual can be in four different states: susceptible and unaware(SU), susceptible and aware(SA), infected and unaware(IU), infected and aware(IA). The flow diagram of the model is given in Fig. 1 .\n\nDenoting a ij and b ij be the adjacency matrices that support the SIS and UAU processes, respectively. The probability of i in one of four states at time t is denoted by p SU\n\nAssuming the probability of susceptible (infect) node i not being informed by any neighbors is \u03b8 i ( t ) ( r i ( t )), and the probability of unaware (aware)\n\n. They are described as [23] :\n\nwhere p A For each possible state at time t , which may give rise to four possible states at time t + 1 with certain probability, the transition probability trees for node i are illustrated in Fig. 2 . According to the scheme in Fig. 2 , one can easily write the Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) equations [25, 26] for each state, for example, along the top branch of the four trees, one can read the probability p SU i (t + 1) of SU at t + 1 as:\n\nSimilarly, the other three MMCA equations can be written as:\n\np IA\n\nwhere p SU\n\nWhen the system goes to the stationary state, we have p SU\n\nfor SU state and equivalently for the SU, SA and IU states.\n\nSince the epidemic threshold determines whether the epidemic can outbreak or die out, it is vital to analyze the effects of the different parameters on the epidemic threshold \u03b2 c . Near the threshold, the probability of nodes being infected is very low, i.e., p I a ji \u03b5 j ) . Further approximate q A i \u2248 1 and q U i \u2248 1 by assuming p I i = \u03b5 i \u2192 0 , and then substitute both of them into Eqs. (5) and (6) , we obtain\n\nCombing Eqs. (8-10 ), then a simple formula is obtained: (11) can be rewritten as:\n\nhere \u03b4 ji = 1 if i = j; otherwise, \u03b4 i j = 0 .\n\nDefining matrix H with elements:\n\nEq. (12) can be read as\n\nwhere \u03b5 = (\u03b5 1 , \u03b5 2 , . . . , \u03b5 N ) T with T be the vector transportation. The non-trivial solutions of Eq. (14) are eigenvectors of H , whose eigenvalues are equal to \u03bc/ \u03b2. Therefore, the onset of the epidemics is given by the largest eigenvalue of H , i.e., max (H) ,\n\nFrom Eqs. (13) and (15) , one can see that the epidemic threshold depends on the structure of contact network ( a ij ), the parameter \u03b3 and the density of awareness \u03c1 A . The value of \u03c1 A is further determined by the structure of information network, the transmission rate \u03bb and the recovery rate \u03b4.\n\nTo verify our theoretical results, as in Ref. [23] , we first build a configuration network with degree distribution P (k ) \u223c k \u22122 . 5 and network size N = 20 0 0 as the contact network, and for the information network, which is generated by adding 800 extra random links in the contact network. a ij and b ij represent the adjacency matrices of the contact network and the information network, respectively. All simulation results are obtained by averaging 20 realizations. We first compare the results from MMCA with Monte-Carlo simulation in Fig. 3 to check the effectiveness of our analysis based on MMCA, from Fig. 3 , one can observe that the results based on the two approaches are in good agreement. So in the next figures, our main results are obtained from MMCA.\n\nThen we investigate the effects of the two main parameters of the model-\u03ba and \u03c3 on the epidemic threshold and the density of infected individuals. Here, we will present the results for \u03b3 = 0 , meaning that \u03b2 A = 0 and q A = 0 . Obviously, once the value of \u03b3 is increased, the epidemic threshold is decreased and the density of infected individuals in enhanced correspondingly. Fig. 4 (b) ] as a function of \u03b2 for different values of \u03ba, respectively. Observing the figure, one can see that though the larger value of \u03ba can cause more individuals become aware and reduce the density of infection. However, one can find that the increasing of \u03bb has no influence on the epidemic threshold. The result is remarkably different from many previous results which claim that the local information-based behavioral response in the single-layer network can alter the epidemic threshold. For instance, Wu et al., [14] compared the roles of the three forms of information-based awareness, i.e., local, global, and contact awareness, in the epidemic threshold, and concluded that global awareness cannot alter the epidemic threshold while both local awareness can enhance the epidemic threshold. Sahneh et al., [11, 12] and us also illustrated that the local information based behavioral responses can effectively increase the epidemic threshold, no matter of SIS model or SIR model [16] . How to understand this nontrivial result? Since the UAU awareness dynamic is the same to the SIS epidemic process.\n\nWhen the epidemic has not broken out, the density of awareness in information network (i.e., \u03c1 A ) is only determined by the transmission rate of awareness, \u03bb, recovery rate \u03b4 and the structure of information network, but is not related to the value of \u03ba. Namely, near or below the epidemic threshold point, increasing the value of \u03ba only means that the initial number of the aware individuals is increased, which cannot affect the density of aware individuals at stationary state. In this case, the value of p A i is independent of the value of \u03ba or \u03c3 , which gives rise to the same value of \u03c1 A [see Fig. 4 (b) ]. Thus, according to Eqs. (13) and (15) , the epidemic threshold \u03b2 c is invariable owing to the same value of \u03c1 A . It is worth noting that, for the case of single-layer network, the local information-based behavioral response directly reduce the transmission rate of epidemic, leading to the change of the epidemic threshold. For our model, the self-awareness behavior first diffuses through the information network, and then play roles in the epidemic dynamics through the contact network. Thus, the effect of the awareness behavior on the transmission rate is indirect .\n\nThe density of infected individuals and aware nodes as functions of \u03b2 for different values of parameter \u03c3 are also shown in Fig. 5 (a) and Fig. 5 (b) , respectively. One can see that, similar to Fig. 4 , varying the value of \u03c3 has no effect on the epidemic threshold. However, differ to the above case, from Fig. 5 (a) we find that the value of \u03c3 also has negligible effect Fig. 3 in Ref. [24] . In order to systematically study the effects of \u03ba and \u03c3 on the \u03c1 I , we further explore the full phase diagram ( \u03bb \u2212 \u03b2) in Fig. 6 . Overall, we can see that \u03c1 I is not influenced by \u03bb when \u03b2 is smaller than the epidemic threshold, since epidemic will die out by itself. Once \u03b2 overpasses the epidemic threshold, \u03c1 I decreases with \u03bb for different values of \u03ba or \u03c3 . More specifically, by comparing Fig. 6 (a) with Fig. 6 (b) (or comparing Fig. 6 (c) with Fig. 6 (d) ), we can see that \u03c1 I is not remarkably influenced by the value of \u03c3 . Likewise, by comparing the Fig. 6 (a) with Fig. 6 (d) (or comparing Fig. 6 (b) with Fig. 6 (c) ), \u03c1 I decreases with \u03ba, especially for the large value of \u03b2.\n\nFinally, the density of infection for different degree k (labeled \u03c1 I k ) and the density of awareness for different degree k (labeled \u03c1 A k ) are plotted in Fig. 7 . From Fig. 7 (a) , one can observe that, when \u03bb = 0 . 0 and \u03ba = 0 . 0 (in this case, the awareness cannot diffuse in information network), the value of \u03c1 I k is very large and increases to a stable value finally. However, when \u03bb is increased, the information can better diffuse in information network (see Fig. 7 (b) ), as a result, the value of \u03c1 I k is totally reduced. Moreover, Fig. 7 (b) suggests that larger value of \u03bb causes that the hub nodes in information networks have higher probability of being informed (i.e., larger value of \u03c1 A k ), which gives rise to the value of \u03c1 I k is not very large even for large degree k (see Fig. 7 (a) ).\n\nIn Fig. 7 , since the information network is constructed by adding 800 edges based on the contact network, thus, if a node is a hub node in one layer which means it is also a hub nodes in the other layer. In this situation, as shown in Fig. 8 , even these hub nodes have more chances to be informed, they still have larger probability of being infected, thus, the effect of the information network cannot be well presented. In the next, we first construct a regular random network with degree k = 8 for each node, which is constructed by random link rewiring from a regular network such that the degree of each node remains unchanged. In particular, a pair of edges, A \u2212 B and C \u2212 D, are randomly selected. They are then rewired to generate new link pairs A \u2212 D and B \u2212 C. Multiple edges connecting the same pair of nodes are prohibited. The process continues for pE steps, where E is the number of edges in the network and p characterizes the randomness of the network.\n\nThe information network is a configuration network with degree distribution P (k ) \u223c k \u22122 . 5 . Fig. 8 reports the values of \u03c1 I k and \u03c1 A k as a function of degree k (Note: here the node's degree refers to the information network rather the contact network, since each node has the same degree in contact network). In this figure, we can clearly find that the nodes with larger degree in information network have larger value of \u03c1 A k , leading to smaller value of \u03c1 I k . That is to say, if a node has more neighbors in information network, who can reduce the risk of infection in contact network.\n\nRecognizing that, on the one hand, outbreak of an epidemic through a physical-contact network can trigger the spreading of information awareness through other different channels, such as on-line social networks, mass media; on the other hand, an individual can not only be informed by other aware neighbors but also can become self-awareness once some friends in contact network are infected. By introducing the self-awareness mechanism for susceptible individuals, we have investigated interplay between the spreading of epidemic and the diffusion of awareness based on the framework of the multiplex networks. We mainly studied the two parameters \u03ba and \u03c3 characterizing the self-awareness probability of susceptible individuals and infected individuals, respectively. Analysis based on the Markov chain approach as well as the extensive computations reveal that the density of infection can be reduced once the two parameters are increased, however, we found that the impact of self-awareness behavior for susceptible individuals on inhibiting the spreading of epidemic is significantly better than the self-awareness of the infected individuals, since self-awareness from susceptible individuals can directly reduce their probabilities of being infected. Meanwhile, we found that the self-awareness behavior cannot alter the epidemic threshold no matter of the local or global information, which are in stark contrast with the results obtained from the single-layer networks. In addition, our findings have shown that the introduction of information layer may cause some individuals has more chances to be informed, which can greatly reduce their risks of infection.\n\nThe challenges of studying the intricate interplay between social and biological contagions in human populations are generating interesting science. In this work, we consider the effects of the self-awareness behavior based on the multiplex networks on the density of infection and the epidemic threshold, our result implies that the conclusions obtained from single-layer networks may need to be re-examined and some new phenomena can emerge when the models are extended to multiplex networks."}
