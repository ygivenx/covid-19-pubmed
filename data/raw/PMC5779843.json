{"title": "Hospitalization due to human parainfluenza virus\u2013associated lower respiratory tract illness in rural Thailand", "body": "Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are a leading cause of respiratory tract infection and hospitalization among children under 5 years.\n1\n, \n2\n HPIV infection causes a spectrum of illness, ranging from the common cold to croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia.\n2\n In the United States, a temperate climate country, the most common HPIV types associated with respiratory illness are HPIV\u20101 and HPIV\u20103, and HPIV\u20102 and HPIV\u20104 are less commonly detected.\n1\n HPIV\u20103 circulates annually with seasonal peaks in spring and summer months, and HPIV\u20101 peaks biennially in the fall during odd\u2010numbered years.\n1\n Little is known about the epidemiology or disease burden of HPIV in countries with tropical climates. In this study, we used molecular and serological methods to describe 4 years of incidence and seasonality of hospitalized HPIV\u20101\u2010, HPIV\u20102\u2010, and HPIV\u20103\u2010associated acute lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) from two provinces in rural Thailand.\n\nAs part of a comprehensive respiratory pathogen study in Thailand,\n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n we prospectively enrolled patients with acute LRTI who were admitted to any of eight hospitals in Sa Kaeo Province from September 1, 2003, to December 31, 2007, and any of 12 hospitals in Nakhon Phanom Province from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2007. Patients were eligible for enrollment at admission to hospital if they had evidence of active infection and at least one sign or symptom of respiratory disease, as described previously\n3\n; had no hospital admission for acute LRTI within the previous 14 days; and had a chest radiograph (CXR) ordered by the physician within 48 hours after admission. Patients (or parents of children aged <18 years) were consented before enrollment. An independent panel of board\u2010certified radiologists in Bangkok reviewed the CXRs using standard criteria as previously described.\n7\n\n\n\nWe collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens from all patients, and during the first 2 years of the study (September 1, 2003, to August 30, 2005), we obtained acute\u2010 and convalescent\u2010phase paired sera three to 6 weeks apart. Specimen aliquots collected during the first two study years were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, where they were tested for HPIV\u20101, HPIV\u20102, and HPIV\u20103 RNA by RT\u2010PCR assays \n8\n, \n9\n and for HPIV\u20101, HPIV\u20102, and HPIV\u20103 IgG antibodies by indirect enzyme immunoassay.\n10\n Serology was used for diagnosis, not to describe immunological characteristics. For the last 2 years, specimens were tested at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Thailand using only real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR (rRT\u2010PCR) assays. We did not test for HPIV\u20104. In addition, during September 1, 2003, to August 30, 2005, virus isolation was performed at NIH using previously described methods.\n11\n\n\n\nTotal nucleic acids were extracted from swab specimens at CDC using the QIAamp Virus BioRobot MDx Kit on a BioRobot MDx Workstation (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA); at NIH, Thailand, extractions were performed manually using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen). Recovered nucleic acids were tested by two different RT\u2010PCR methods: samples collected during the first two study years were tested by GeneScan RT\u2010PCR assays as previously described,\n9\n and samples from subsequent years were tested by newly developed rRT\u2010PCR assays described here. Briefly, multiple primer/probes targeting type\u2010specific conserved regions of each of the HPIV\u20101, HPIV\u20102, and HPIV\u20103 hemagglutinin\u2010neuraminidase genes were designed from alignments of sequences available from GenBank and CDC databases using Primer Express (version 3.0, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Beacon Designer software (version 5.0, Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Primers/probes that gave the best performance in rRT\u2010PCR assays for each virus were selected for the subsequent study (Table 1). Amplification conditions and reagents were identical to those previously described.\n4\n All swab specimens were also tested by RT\u2010PCR for human GAPDH or RNase P housekeeping genes as a control for specimen quality.\n\nWe considered patients as having evidence of a recent HPIV infection if they had a positive RT\u2010PCR/rRT\u2010PCR result or HPIV virus isolation or showed a \u2265fourfold increase in IgG antibody titer to HPIV\u20101, HPIV\u20102, and HPIV\u20103. Because of known serologic cross\u2010reactions among HPIVs,\n2\n we considered samples with a negative RT\u2010PCR result, but positive by serology for more than one HPIV type, to be positive for HPIV but untyped. All swab specimens were also tested for influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus by RT\u2010PCR.\n11\n Detailed descriptions of the detection of these viruses have been published.\n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n\n\n\nWe calculated crude and adjusted age\u2010specific incidence for HPIV\u2010associated hospitalized respiratory illness. Denominators were mid\u2010year population estimates from Thailand\u2019s National Economic and Social Development Board.\n16\n Adjustments were made for enrollment by assuming that the proportion positive for HPIV and CXR\u2010confirmed pneumonia was the same in enrolled and eligible non\u2010enrolled patients. Similarly, for patients whose CXRs were not reviewed by the radiology panel, we assumed that the proportion with radiographic confirmation of pneumonia was the same as for patients whose CXRs were reviewed. We calculated confidence intervals for adjusted age\u2010specific incidence rates using the 95% confidence intervals of the proportion of HPIV\u2010positive tests assuming a binomial distribution. We described seasonal patterns by calculating the proportion of enrolled patients with HPIV detection for each month. We performed all analyses using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Thailand Ministry of Health and an institutional review board of CDC.\n\nOptimized HPIV\u20101, HPIV\u20102, and HPIV\u20103 rRT\u2010PCR assays were specific with high\u2010titer cultures of HPIV\u20101 (C\u201035), HPIV\u20102 (Greer), and HPIV\u20103 (C\u2010243) and were non\u2010reactive with a broad range of other respiratory pathogens, including influenza viruses A and B, RSV, HPIV\u20104A and HPIV\u20104B, mumps virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, and human bocavirus. Pooled nasal wash specimens from healthy persons were also negative by all assays. In direct comparisons with the GenScan RT\u2010PCR assays\n9\n, the rRT\u2010PCR assays showed comparable sensitivity with serially diluted HPIV\u20101, HPIV\u20102, and HPIV\u20103 RNA and gave identical results with a collection of positive and negative specimens of HPIV\u20101, HPIV\u20102, and HPIV\u20103 from CDC archives and the second year of this study.\n\nFrom September 1, 2003, through December 31, 2007, there were 41 761 hospital admissions owing to LRTI in Sa Kaeo and Nakhon Phanom Provinces. Of the 22 857 (55%) patients with CXRs and who were eligible for enrollment, 10 097 (49%) were enrolled, of whom 573 (5%) had evidence of HPIV infection. Of 573 patients with evidence of HPIV infection, 189 (33%) had HPIV\u20101, 54 (9%) had HPIV\u20102, 305 (53%) had HPIV\u20103, and 27 (5%) were untyped; two patients had coinfections with 2 HPIV serotypes (HPIV\u20101 + \u20102 and HPIV\u20102 + \u20103). Of the 404 patients in the 2 years with both RT\u2010PCR and serology results, 76% were detected by RT\u2010PCR only, 7\u00b74% by serology only, and 17% by both methods.\n17\n Five HPIV specimens were detected by only virus isolation. Mixed viral infections were identified in 48 (8\u00b74%) patients with HPIV detection: 4% with influenza viruses, 3% with adenovirus, and 2% with RSV.\n\nOf 468 HPIV patients with CXRs evaluated, 85% had radiographic evidence of pneumonia (interstitial infiltrates 63%, alveolar infiltrates 21%, consolidation 9%). Among the 573 patients with evidence of HPIV infection, the most common signs and symptoms of respiratory infection were fever (69%, 51% with temperature \u226538 and 18% with reported fever only), cough (98%), sputum production (62%), and tachypnea (54%). Other signs and symptoms included rhonchi (48%), rales/crepitation (41%), wheezing (31%), chest pain (6%), and hemoptysis (2%). One hundred and 89 (33\u00b72%) HPIV\u2010positive patients required oxygen therapy, and six needed mechanical ventilation. There was no marked difference in frequency of signs and symptoms at admission by HPIV type. Of the 573 HPIV\u2010positive patients, six (1\u00b70%) died, two aged 68 and 71 years with HPIV\u20101, and four aged 39, 58, 69, and 76 years with HPIV\u20103. Of the six deaths, one also had an influenza virus detected.\n\nFrom January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2007, the proportion of enrolled patients with HPIV was higher for infants aged <1 year (9%) and children aged 1\u20134 years (9%) than for children aged 5\u20139 years (6%) and 10\u201319 years (3%) and adults aged 20\u201364 years (2%) and \u226565 years (3%) (Table 2). Fifty\u2010nine percent of HPIV\u2010infected patients were male. Infants aged <1 year had the highest rate of HPIV\u2010associated hospitalized respiratory disease (486 per 100 000 person\u2010years) and radiographically confirmed pneumonia (229 per 100 000 person\u2010years). Rates decreased among older age groups. Persons aged 10\u201319 years had the lowest rates of HPIV\u2010associated hospitalized respiratory disease (4 per 100 000 person\u2010years) and radiographically confirmed pneumonia (2 per 100 000 person\u2010years). The rate of HPIV\u2010associated hospitalized respiratory disease among males was 15 per 100 000 person\u2010years and among females was 11 per 100 000 person\u2010years.\n\nAmong specific HPIV serotypes, most infections were detected in children 1\u20134 aged years for all three serotypes (Table 3). Among children aged <1 year, infection with HPIV\u20103 [69/118 (58%)] was more common than that with HPIV\u20101 [41/118 (35%)]. Similarly, among children aged 1\u20134 years, HPIV\u20103 [140/243 (58%)] infection was more common than HPIV\u20101 [85/243 (35%)]. HPIV\u20101 and HPIV\u20103 infections were equally represented among children aged 5\u20139 years [HPIV\u20103: 15/31 (48%) and HPIV\u20101: 11/31 (35%)].\n\nHPIV\u20101 and HPIV\u20103 viruses could be detected throughout the year and often cocirculated (Figure 1). HPIV\u20103 was detected more frequently each year from January until May\u2013July. HPIV\u20101 appeared to circulate more frequently from October 2003 through July 2005 and October 2005 through July 2006. However, HPIV\u20101 circulated in low numbers every year.\n\nIn Thailand, HPIV was an important virus associated with hospitalized acute LRTI particularly among young children. HPIV infection was associated with 9% of hospitalized CXR\u2010confirmed pneumonia and 9% of hospitalized LRTI among children aged below 5 years in Thailand. The incidence of HPIV\u2010associated hospitalized LRTI was highest in infants and children aged 2\u20134 years, similar to other reports.\n2\n, \n18\n, \n19\n Targeting HPIV for new interventions in these age groups would have an impact on respiratory hospitalizations in Thailand.\n\nFew published studies report the incidence of hospitalized HPIV infection. The incidence of hospitalized HPIV\u2010associated LRTI in Thailand was slightly higher than that in a report from the United States (age <1 year: 240/100 000, 1 year 150/100 000, 2\u20134 years 40/100 000).\n11\n, \n19\n While the incidence of hospitalized HPIV\u2010associated LRTI was lower than that of RSV\u2010associated LRTI among children aged below 5 years in Thailand,\n11\n, \n14\n HPIV still accounted for a substantial proportion of hospitalizations. Also, the incidence of HPIV\u2010associated hospitalized pneumonia was slightly higher in males compared with females, similar to other reports.\n20\n, \n21\n HPIV\u20103 was more frequently detected than HPIV\u20101 (53% versus 33%), and together these serotypes were responsible for 86% of patients hospitalized with HPIV\u2010associated acute LRTI.\n\nIt is difficult to prove that detection of HPIV from the upper respiratory tract was associated with LRTI. However, a concurrent study only rarely found HPIV from nasal pharyngeal swabs taken from a comparison group of persons without respiratory illness. From August 2004 through December 2007, a sample of patients without fever, diarrhea, or respiratory symptoms in the previous 3 days was selected from the outpatient clinics of the hospitals participating in surveillance (H Baggett, personal comm). Overall, 1647 asymptomatic controls were tested with rRT\u2010PCR for HPIV\u20101, HPIV\u20102, or HPIV\u20103; 12 (0\u00b773%) were positive, 5 were HPIV\u20101, 2 were HPIV\u20102, and 5 were HPIV\u20103. Three (25%) of 12 HPIV\u2010positive controls were aged <5 years. Thus, it seems likely that HPIV detected from hospitalized patients was associated with their current illness.\n\nSimilar to other respiratory viruses in Thailand, HPIV circulated at low levels throughout the year.\n11\n However, the annual periodicity of HPIV types was similar to that in the United States.\n1\n There was a seasonal pattern whereby the proportion of HPIV\u2010positive cases tended to be highest between January and April but not always limited to a single type. Previous studies of HPIV infection in Southeast Asia found seasonal peaks; a 2\u2010year study in Thailand found a February\u2013March peak, and a 4\u2010year study in Singapore found a February\u2013May peak.\n22\n, \n23\n In the United States, HPIV\u20103 prevalence increases in spring and summer months, while HPIV\u20101 prevalence increases in the fall.\n1\n, \n18\n HPIV\u20101 circulates biennially during odd\u2010numbered years, and it is uncommon to have both serotypes cocirculating. It has been proposed that cross\u2010protection of antibodies from previous HPIV infection influences the predominance of circulating HPIV type.\n21\n During our 4 years of surveillance in Thailand, HPIV\u20101 circulated every year, but there appeared to be increased circulation beginning in October of two of three odd\u2010numbered years. Also, it was common for both serotypes to cocirculate, at least at low levels.\n\nOur study had several limitations. Even though prospective enrollment of hospitalized patients in a well\u2010defined population with independent radiographic confirmation of pneumonia provided a robust estimate of HPIV\u2010associated pneumonia incidence, our study included only hospitalized patients with CXR performed, which only represents one part of the severe end of the disease spectrum. As HPIV infection also causes other syndromes that can require hospitalization, such as croup and asthma exacerbation, as well as less severe disease, HPIV infection burden in Thailand likely exceeds our estimates. In the third year of our study, we used only RT\u2010PCR to detect HPIV without serology and likely failed to identify a few patients. However, approximately 90% of infections for each HPIV type were detected by RT\u2010PCR in the first 2 years when both methods were used. We also found that 8\u00b74% of patients with HPIV had coinfection with other viral respiratory pathogens, and it is not possible to conclusively determine which of these pathogens was the primary cause of the pneumonia.\n\nIn Thailand, HPIV infection was an important cause of hospitalized LRTI and pneumonia, especially among infants and children. Most infections were caused by types HPIV\u20101 and HPIV\u20103. As HPIVs contribute to a substantial proportion of childhood pneumonia in Thailand and possibly other tropical countries, improved prevention strategies such as vaccines \n24\n or antiviral agents \n25\n deserve greater attention and economic evaluation in the tropics.\n\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the funding agency.\n\nNo commercial or other conflict of interest declared."}
