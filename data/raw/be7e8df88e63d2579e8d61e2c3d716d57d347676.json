{"title": "CHAP TER 5 Respiratory System", "body": "We gratefully acknowledge the contributions to prior editions of this chapter by Drs. Ken Jubb, Peter Kennedy, Nigel Palmer, and Donald Dungworth. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Of all of the organ systems, the respiratory tract may be unique in its vulnerability to injurious agents. The involuntary nature of ventilation, necessitated by aerobic respiration and the need for oxygen, actively pulls large volumes of air into the lungs (estimated at 5,400 L/day in dogs and 11,400 L/day in horses). Along with this air, there is a variety of potentially injurious materials. In addition, the flow of the entire cardiac output through the extensive and delicate vascular bed of the gas exchange region of the lungs provides a separate avenue for the delivery of potentially harmful substances to the respiratory tract. These dual exposure routes are particularly important in determining the expression of disease in the lung, with distinct patterns of lesions depending on whether the route of entry is airborne (aerogenous) or vascular (hematogenous) . The array of potentially injurious agents includes airborne microorganisms, particulates, and toxic gases in ambient air, and a wide variety of infectious agents and extrinsic or intrinsic toxins delivered via the pulmonary circulation. Together, the injury, inflammation, and reparative responses to these insults compromise the gas exchange functions of the respiratory system.\n\nAir flows through the nares into the nasal vestibule, past the nasal valve, and into the nasal cavity. There, the ventral, middle, and dorsal meatuses are demarcated by the osseous and cartilaginous conchae (turbinates). Air flows past the ethmoid conchae in the caudal nasal cavity, through the choanae and into the nasopharynx. The presence of respiratory turbinates is restricted to mammals and birds, and is assumed to be important in the evolution of endothermy and the high levels of oxygen consumption associated with metabolism in these species; similar structures are not present in ectothermic animals. Functionally, the respiratory turbinates warm and humidify the inspired air to prevent desiccation of the lower respiratory tract, and reclaim moisture and heat from the saturated vapor leaving the lungs. The nasal submucosa is richly supplied with a complex vascular plexus, nerves, and mucosal glands. In addition to the air-warming functions, most species have vascular shunts between the respiratory turbinates and the brain vasculature, suggesting a role in cooling the brain during periods of intense activity in mammals and birds. Stimulation of the parasympathetic innervation in the nasal cavity leads to increased vascular permeability and mucosal gland secretion, which may occlude the nasal airways and increase resistance to airflow. This is countered by the sympathetic nerve fibers, which favor vasoconstriction and decreased vascular permeability.\n\nThe mucosa of the nasal cavity has distinct epithelial types: (1) stratified squamous, (2) transitional, (3) ciliated respiratory, and (4) olfactory. The relative distribution and extent of each of these cell types vary among species. Stratified squamous epithelium is confined to the nasal vestibule at the entrance to the nasal cavity. Separating the squamous epithelium from the more caudal respiratory epithelium is a zone of nonciliated cuboidal to columnar cells, the transitional epithelium. Most of the epithelium lining the nasal mucosa is composed of pseudostratified respiratory epithelium. This is a complex epithelium that includes ciliated, mucous, nonciliated, and basal cells (Fig. 5-1) . Olfactory epithelium is located in the caudal and caudodorsal nasal cavity, lining the ethmoid conchae. This is the most phylogenetically conserved of the nasal epithelium, reflecting the ancient origins of olfaction. The epithelium is composed of olfactory sensory neuronsbipolar neurons that have immotile cilia forming dendritic knobs bearing the olfactory receptors-as well as sustentacular cells and basal cells. Olfactory mucosa is readily recognized by a line of sustentacular cell nuclei at the mid-level of the epithelium, basal cells adjacent to basal lamina, and olfactory neurons scattered between these 2 layers, as well as Bowman's glands and prominent olfactory nerves in the lamina propria (see Fig. 5 -1). Olfactory epithelium is rich in cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. These enzymes are essential for olfaction, and their biotransformation activity confers susceptibility to inhaled or ingested toxins, such as 3-methylindole in horses.\n\nthe right cranial lung lobe of ruminants and pigs arises from the trachea before the primary bronchi bifurcate from the trachea to the right and left lungs.\n\nDepending on the species, further subdivision into individual lobules by connective tissue septa may or may not be grossly visible; when present, these interlobular septa are contiguous with the pleura. In humans, pigs, and cattle, lobulation is highly developed, with individual lobules readily seen on the pleural surface of the lung. Equine, ovine, and caprine lungs are intermediate in lobulation; canine and feline lung are essentially devoid of septation and lobule formation. A bronchopulmonary segment is the area served by a tertiary bronchus that arises from the lobar (secondary) bronchi. Well-developed interlobular septa that nearly completely surround individual bronchopulmonary segments, as in the pig and cow, limit collateral ventilation as well as the movement of cells and molecules between adjacent segments. Functionally, this is important in these species in limiting the extension of inflammation between lobules. Well-developed connective tissue septa can effectively sequester inflammation in affected lobules, leading to the characteristic gross lesions especially common in bacterial bronchopneumonia, with severely affected lobules adjacent to those less affected. The lack of collateral ventilation is also largely responsible for the common, incidental, interlobular emphysema found in cattle lungs at the time of autopsy.\n\nThe terminal acinus is composed of one terminal bronchiole and its associated gas exchange region. The anatomy of the terminal acinus varies among domestic species, especially the length between the terminal bronchiole and the alveoli. This junction is composed of respiratory bronchioles and/or alveolar ducts, depending on the species. Respiratory bronchioles (prominent in dogs, cats, ferrets, and humans, but not in horses, cattle, sheep, or pigs) are lined by cuboidal epithelium that is interrupted by periodic alveolar outpocketings before transitioning into the gas exchange region. Alveolar ducts are cylindrical airways lined by a membranous epithelium and have multiple circumferential communications with alveoli; they may have smooth muscle in their wall.\n\nThe vascular supply to the lung is dual, arriving through both the pulmonary and bronchial circulation. This unique system of perfusing the lung with blood has implications in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease. The pulmonary arterial circulation receives the entire output of the right ventricle and is characterized as a high-flow, low-pressure system. In contrast, the bronchial arterial circulation, being a part of the systemic arterial blood vasculature, is a low-flow, high-pressure system. The bronchial circulation can arise from a variety of sites, including the aorta, intercostal arteries, and subclavian arteries. It delivers nutrition to the bronchi and bronchioles, and in some species also to the blood vessels, pleura, and much of the interstitium. Species vary in their vascular supply. The bronchial artery supplies the airways of dogs, and its obstruction causes bronchiolar necrosis, whereas this does not occur in rabbits because of contributions by the pulmonary artery. In cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses, the bronchial circulation also supplies the pleura, whereas in species with thin pleurae (dogs, cats, rodents), the pulmonary circulation serves this function. The pulmonary circulation nourishes the alveolar parenchyma and delivers blood to the site of alveolar gas exchange.\n\nThe nasopharynx is lined by ciliated pseudostratified epithelium with zones of stratified squamous epithelium. Lymphoid nodules are abundant throughout the submucosa, and are one of the components of the pharyngeal lymphoid (Waldeyer's) ring, a collection of lymphoid tissues that encircle the oropharynx and nasopharynx. The auditory (Eustachian) tubes extend from the nasopharynx to the middle ears. In horses, diverticula of each auditory tube form the guttural pouches, which are located caudodorsal to the caudal pharynx. The function of the guttural pouches is not completely understood, but they may play a role in cooling blood destined for the brain during periods of intense activity and respiration. This respiratory-based cooling mechanism is facilitated by the anatomy of the internal carotid artery as it courses in a crease along the caudal wall up to the dorsal surface of the pouches. As with the pharynx and auditory tube, the mucosa of the guttural pouches is lined by pseudostratified ciliated epithelium.\n\nThe larynx is composed of a complex of cartilage plates lined by stratified squamous epithelium as well as pseudostratified ciliated respiratory epithelium. The larynx is at the boundary between the respiratory system and the pharynx, and communicates directly with the laryngopharynx. The cartilage of the larynx is important in vocalization in animals, and also resists deformation and obstruction from ingesta, external pressure, and the negative internal pressures experienced during inhalation.\n\nThe trachea extends from the terminus of the larynx to the carina, the branch point for the principal bronchi leading into the right and left lungs. With its relatively simple gross anatomy, and seemingly simple function serving as the conduit for air traveling to and from the lungs, the trachea is often overlooked in routine pathology examinations. The upper third of the trachea is arbitrarily considered to be the most distal part of the upper respiratory tract.\n\nThe organization and subdivision of the lower respiratory tract arise as a function of the development of the organ, and vary considerably by species (lung development is reviewed later in the chapter). Many of these gross features are important in the pathogenesis of disease and susceptibility of individual species to a variety of insults, including infectious agents and inhaled toxins and particulate matter. Additionally, proper usage of terminology is important in the gross description of lesions at the time of autopsy.\n\nThe divisions of the lungs, from largest to smallest, include lobe, bronchopulmonary segment, and terminal acinus. In all of the domestic species, the lung is divided into a right and left lung, each of which is served by a single principal bronchus (primary bronchi) arising at the tracheal bifurcation. Each of the 2 lungs is further subdivided into individual lobes. The lung lobe represents the largest subdivision of the right and left lungs. The lobe is defined as the gas exchange region ventilated through the lobar (secondary) bronchus. The numbers and distribution of lung lobes vary by species. All domestic species except the horse have 2 lobes in the left lung (cranial and caudal) and 4 lobes in the right lung (cranial, middle, caudal, and accessory); the horse lacks a right middle lung lobe. The cranial lobe of the left lung is subdivided into a cranial and caudal part in all species except the horse, and the right cranial lobe of domestic ruminants is similarly divided into a cranial and caudal part. The lobar bronchus (tracheal bronchus) of tunica media. Cats, pigs, and cattle have the thickest pulmonary arteries of the domestic species, and in domestic cats, the medial hypertrophy/hyperplasia can be quite pronounced, although usually incidental. Because of the presence of smooth muscle in the small pulmonary arterioles of many domestic species, care needs to be taken in diagnosing pulmonary arterial hypertension based simply on arteriolar histology.\n\nPulmonary veins drain the entire lung except the proximal trachea and lymph nodes. Cardiac muscle is present in the large proximal veins of rodents but not domestic species. The pulmonary veins follow the bronchial tree in most domestic species (in contrast to humans), and have a thin fibrous wall in all of the species except for cattle and pigs, where smooth muscle can be prominent and give a beaded appearance. Thus cattle >3 months of age have thick muscular veins next to airways and in the interstitium that resemble arteries (see . In all species, the larger pulmonary veins are recognized by the presence of an external elastic lamina between the tunica media and the adventitia, but no internal elastic lamina.\n\nThe lymphatic system is the least well understood of the vascular systems in the lung. Lymphatic vessels are present within the visceral pleura and surround airways and blood vessels, but do not extend into the alveolar septa. The morphology of the pulmonary lymphatics varies by their location. Within the pleura and just below it, the interstitial space leading into proper lymphatics can be considered as prelymphatic space. This is a site of fluid accumulation during pulmonary edema and also, given that it collects fluids bathing the entirety of the surrounding tissue, is important in delivering antigens to regional lymph nodes. The prelymphatics in the pleura blend into reservoir lymphatics, which eventually connect with conduit lymphatics. Within the lung, saccular and tubulosaccular lymphatics surround all airways and noncapillary blood vessels (arteries and veins). These lymphatics are large (some >100 \u00b5m) and thin walled. Although they are histologically indistinct and are often overlooked, the lymphatics distend greatly with fluid as a result of pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Metastatic emboli filling lymphatics sometimes reveal the distribution of the pulmonary lymphatic system, and aggregates of inflammatory cells may accumulate around terminal airways and blood vessels in association with the local lymphatics. Thus the lung lymphatic system is important in fluid movement, regulating alveolar hydration, and acting as a conduit for movement of antigens, leukocytes, and metastasizing neoplasms.\n\nThe cellular constituents of the respiratory system are functionally interdependent in relation to organ development, homeostasis, and response to injury. This interdependence is first evident in the close interactions between endodermal and mesodermal components in lung development (see Lung development and growth, later). In the adult lung, this anatomic and functional relationship has been termed the epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit and includes the interactions among respiratory epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, extracellular matrix proteins, and leukocytes during development, health, and disease.\n\nIn all domestic species, the trachea and bronchi are surrounded by rings of hyaline cartilage. These rings resist physical deformation, thereby helping to maintain the patency of the The morphology of the 2 vascular systems in most species can be discerned histologically, at least in their normal state ( Fig. 5-2 ). Both arteries are adjacent to bronchi and bronchioles, but the pulmonary artery is much larger (at least half the diameter of the airway) than the bronchial artery. Further, the muscular pulmonary arteries have an internal and external elastic lamina of similar thickness, whereas bronchial arteries have an internal elastic lamina, but the external lamina is indistinct or absent. At the pulmonary trunk, the arteries of most species have considerable numbers of elastic fibers interspersed with the smooth muscle, whereas the more distal arteries and arterioles do not have elastic fibers. The smaller branches of pulmonary arteries vary considerably between species in their morphology, especially in the thickness of the The pulmonary artery (PA), located in the connective tissue ensheathing the bronchiole (Br), has both internal and external elastic laminae, and is about half the diameter of the bronchiole. B. The bronchial artery (BA) also follows the bronchiole (Br) but is smaller than the pulmonary artery, and has an internal but not an external elastic lamina. C. The pulmonary veins (PV) are most easily seen in the lung parenchyma, and may have an external but no internal elastic lamina. Pulmonary veins of cattle, shown here, have thick smooth muscle in the tunica media. P450-monooxygenase enzymes. Indeed, on a per-cell basis, club cells of some species have greater metabolic capacity than even hepatocytes. Therefore, club cells are extremely sensitive to a variety of xenobiotics; metabolism of these toxins can generate intermediate metabolites that form adducts with macromolecules and lead to cellular injury. Finally, club cell secretory protein (formerly Clara cell secretory protein, CC10, CC16), secreted by these cells in response to adrenergic stimuli, may dampen the inflammatory response by inhibition of phospholipase A 2 . The chemosensory or brush cells are infrequent cells that are thought to detect irritants in the inhaled air. In addition to these cells lining the airway surface, tracheobronchial glands in the lamina propria and/or in the submucosa between the cartilage rings are the major source of mucus in these large airways.\n\nSmooth muscle cells are located around the circumference of the bronchi and bronchioles, and extend to the ostia of alveolar outpocketings in the respiratory bronchioles, and into the alveolar ducts of some species. Historically, the airway smooth muscle cell was primarily seen as the transducer of bronchoconstriction and bronchodilation. However, smooth muscle cells can undergo hyperplasia in response to paracrine signals arising from the airway epithelium in inflammatory diseases, and this doubtless contributes to the accentuation of smooth muscle found histologically in chronic bronchitis and asthma. Further, smooth muscle cells produce a wide array of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix metalloproteases, allowing them to modify the interstitial matrix directly around smooth muscle bundles. These cells also secrete matrix proteins, including fibronectin, elastin, and a variety of laminins and collagens, which then modulates the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of the smooth muscle cells. For example, plasmin can stimulate release of active transforming growth factor-\u03b2 from these cells, which in turn promotes collagen synthesis by the smooth muscle cells. This paradigm may partly explain the increased extracellular matrix found around smooth-muscle bundles in chronically inflamed airways.\n\nThe alveolar parenchyma is the site of the only essential function of the lung, that being gas exchange to support cellular aerobic respiration. Regardless of the media for gas exchange (water or air), the essential design of the gas exchange membrane in animals is remarkably similar, consisting of an epithelial layer exposed to the exchange media, in close apposition to blood-filled capillaries. This relatively simple arrangement belies the complexity of the biology of the region. In mammals, there are 5 major cell types associated with the alveolar parenchyma: type I and type II pneumocytes, capillary endothelial cells, interstitial fibroblasts, and alveolar macrophages.\n\nType I pneumocytes are large, flat, membranous epithelial cells that line ~93% of the alveolar surface. Type I pneumocytes are terminally differentiated and nonmitotic. They are particularly vulnerable to oxidant injury in part because of their large membrane surface area and low levels of important antioxidants, especially reduced glutathione. Irreversible injury to type I cells is quickly followed by sloughing of the cells from the alveolar basement membrane, which triggers a rapid regenerative response orchestrated by the type II pneumocytes. This description of type I cells suggests a passive role in the lung, facilitating gas exchange across the plasma membrane, and poised for injury and loss following any number of insults. Although this is true, they also play a critical part in maintaining normal lung fluid composition, providing a upper airways. In spite of their greater diameter, relative to the bronchioles, ~80% of the resistance to pulmonary airflow resides within the first 4-7 generations of the conducting airways. Partly because of this, any process that results in significant narrowing of the bronchi can result in clinically detectable changes at an earlier stage than a similar process involving the bronchioles.\n\nBronchioles, in contrast to bronchi, have no cartilage in their walls to prevent airway collapse. Bronchiolar airway patency is dependent on the attachment of alveolar septa to the thin connective tissue layer in the bronchiolar wall. The one exception to this rule is marine mammals, both cetaceans and pinnipeds, which possess well-developed cartilage rings around even the smallest bronchioles that prevent airway collapse in the face of supra-atmospheric pressures found at depth within the oceans. In terrestrial mammals, the radially arranged alveolar septa are tethered to and pull on the bronchiolar wall to maximize the luminal diameter during peak lung volume during inspiration. During expiration, as the forces from the alveolar septa decrease, the bronchiolar lumen decreases in diameter. Because of their smaller diameter, collapsibility and thin-walled structure, bronchioles are much more susceptible to disease processes occurring in the surrounding alveolar parenchyma than are bronchi, and they individually have a higher resistance to airflow than individual bronchi. In spite of this, there is less resistance to airflow in the distal airways because of the higher number of bronchioles. Therefore a large percentage of bronchioles must be affected before clinical evidence of disease is detected.\n\nHistologically, there is great cellular diversity within the mucosal epithelium of the conducting airways, the cell populations changing depending on the species and airway generation under consideration. The trachea, bronchi, and proximal bronchioles are lined by pseudostratified epithelium composed of a mix of ciliated, mucous, club (formerly Clara cells, see later), serous and chemosensory/brush cells. In general, the numbers of ciliated and mucous cells decrease within the distal airways, with a greater proportion of nonciliated cells present within the bronchioles (eFig. 5-1). These distribution factors can play an important role in the species-and regionspecific susceptibility of the airway epithelium to specific forms of injury, especially infectious agents, particulate matter, and inhaled or systemic toxins.\n\nThe ciliated cells function mainly in clearance of airwaylining fluid and also have secretory functions. The secretory cells include mucous cells, serous cells, and club cells. The morphologic and functional differences among these secretory cells are not considered immutable, and microenvironmental conditions induce metaplasia from one type to the other. The contribution of these cells to the airway surface liquid includes not only mucus but also the innate defense molecules (see Lung defenses, later), immunoregulatory proteins such as club cell secretory protein and annexin A1, and cellular defense molecules, including antioxidants and trefoil factor. Mucous cells (goblet cells) are a source of mucins that form the mucus layer of the epithelial lining fluid. Club cells (formerly known as Clara cells) are nonciliated non-mucus-secreting cells that predominate in the distal airway of many species. The club cell functions as a progenitor cell for epithelial repair within the airway mucosa, as it has the capacity to divide and differentiate into other secretory cells or ciliated cells. Club cells of many species have abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum that possesses high concentrations of cytochrome 20.0 m in experimental and human cases of pulmonary fibrosis. For example, the presence or absence of Thy-1 on lung fibroblasts is associated with variation in fibroblast adhesion to extracellular matrix, production of cytokines, and ability to produce extracellular matrix proteins including collagen. The array of matrix proteins potentially produced by lung fibroblasts is extensive, and includes collagen types I, III, IV, V, and VI; elastin; laminin; fibronectin; glycosaminoglycans; and proteoglycans.\n\nPulmonary macrophages are an important class of lung cells and are found in a variety of compartments within the organ. Five separate populations have been recognized: alveolar macrophages, interstitial macrophages, pulmonary intravascular macrophages, dendritic cells, and pleural macrophages.\n\nAlveolar macrophages are resident cells in the lung that form a self-renewing pool derived from progenitors in the yolk sac and fetal liver; they are minimally supplemented by, but not dependent on, renewal from marrow-derived circulating monocytes. Inflammation induces massive proliferation of these resident cells as well as eliciting monocytes from the circulation, and it has become apparent that resident and elicited macrophages have considerable differences in function. Resident alveolar macrophages are integral to homeostasis of the alveolar parenchyma, and maintaining a noninflamed environment despite the presence of low numbers of bacteria. The role that pulmonary macrophages play in pulmonary defense is discussed subsequently (see Lung defenses). Less appreciated is the homeostatic role of alveolar macrophages in preventing the accumulation of native proteins, especially surfactant, within the alveolus. Alveolar proteinosis, a condition of alveolar accumulation of surfactant components, can be caused by local deficiency of granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor; this impairs the ability of the alveolar macrophage to clear surfactant, leading to its accumulation in the alveolus.\n\nAlveolar macrophages function as important regulatory cells in the lung, controlling inflammatory, immune, and repair processes through the release of a wide array of cytokines and other regulatory molecules. Inflammation and immunity are promoted by macrophage synthesis and release of cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interferon-\u03b3, as well as by release of inflammatory mediators, such as leukotriene B 4 and C 4 , platelet-activating factor, and thromboxane A 2 . Repair processes are generally promoted or otherwise regulated by release of cytokines that include transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and -\u03b1, fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor.\n\nDendritic cells are ubiquitous immunoregulatory cells found in all tissues. They are motile cells involved in surveillance for antigens at the epithelial and mesothelial surfaces of the respiratory tract. Various subpopulations can be distinguished by means of morphologic characteristics, primary location, and unique surface marker proteins. Morphologically, dendritic cells have numerous long processes and function as antigenpresenting cells, priming na\u00efve T cells and driving the cells into T-helper type 1 (Th-1) or Th-2 effector cells. The ability to present antigen to T cells requires that the dendritic cells themselves mature; this occurs within regional lymph nodes under the influence of appropriate proinflammatory signals. The numbers of dendritic cells can increase markedly in the respiratory tract, given the proper stimuli, and they play an important role in allergic airway disease and asthma. structural basis for preventing movement of fluid into the alveolus, and clearing fluid and protein from the alveolus during pulmonary edema.\n\nType II pneumocytes are the main cuboidal cell lining the alveolus; the brush cell or type III pneumocyte is also cuboidal, but much less numerous. Type II pneumocytes are found most commonly at the intersection of 2 alveolar septa, the so-called \"corners\" of the polygonal alveoli. Ultrastructurally, the type II pneumocyte has apical microvilli and characteristic cytoplasmic osmiophilic lamellar bodies, which are the site of surfactant storage. The primary functions of type II pneumocytes are to synthesize pulmonary surfactant, to serve as progenitor cells for replacement and turnover of alveolar epithelium, and to metabolize xenobiotics.\n\nPulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture that forms a film at the air-liquid interface of terminal bronchioles and alveoli. It consists of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC, which is responsible for much of the surface-tension-lowering function) and other phospholipids, cholesterol, and surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, SP-D). Surfactant lipids are synthesized in type II pneumocytes; some are also produced by club cells. They are initially stored in lamellar bodies, then secreted onto the alveolar surface, where they arrange in a functional surface-active form known as tubular myelin, which adsorbs to the alveolar air-liquid interface. The main function of surfactant in the alveoli is to lower surface tension in the alveolar space to prevent alveolar collapse during expiration. The biology of the system is highly dynamic. With each breath, there is cycling between the subsurface surfactant reservoir and the bioactive surface film. Similarly, tubular myelin is constantly converted to a less functional vesicular form that must be recycled by type II pneumocytes or degraded by alveolar macrophages. SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C are important for secretion and recycling of the surfactant lipid, formation of tubular myelin, and the proper insertion of these lipids into the alveolar surface film. Beyond its role in regulating alveolar surface tension, SP-A and SP-D also have important immunoregulatory and pulmonary defense functions (see Lung defenses, later). The biology of this system is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of interstitial lung diseases.\n\nThe proliferative capacity of type II pneumocytes is important in alveolar development and postnatal lung growth; the lungs of most species are not fully developed, undergoing continued maturation after birth (see Lung development and growth, later). Type II cells can rapidly proliferate to repopulate denuded basement membrane following injury to type I pneumocytes. This process follows a general pattern, consisting of rapid migration to cover the basement membrane, followed by proliferation, and differentiation to the dominant alveolar epithelium. The process is dependent on the ability of the type II pneumocyte to modify the extracellular matrix to facilitate this process. Type II cells synthesize a variety of matrix components, including fibronectin, type IV collagen, and proteoglycans, as well as matrix-degrading enzymes such as metalloproteases.\n\nFibroblasts are found within the alveolar wall associated with a network of extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen and elastin. This network is not uniformly distributed within the membrane, leading to regions of the wall that are \"thick\" and \"thin,\" with gas exchange only occurring in the latter. The fibroblasts of the lung are heterogeneous in terms of morphology, functionality, and expression of surface markers. This heterogeneity is particularly well documented \u2022 Alveolar macrophages recognize foreign invaders, particularly in the presence of opsonins, and engulf and kill these microbes without inducing inflammation. If the infection cannot be contained by these mechanisms, inflammation is triggered in an attempt to control the threat. In these situations, macrophages and airway or alveolar epithelial cells produce cytokines and other mediators that recruit neutrophils and monocytes-macrophages. Inflammatory mediators also induce the production of antibacterial proteins by epithelial cells of the airway surface and tracheobronchial glands. But this response has the potential to do harm. Inflammatory exudates impair gas exchange, leukocytederived enzymes and oxygen radicals cause injury to lung tissue, and repair processes may result in organization of alveolar exudates or fibrosis of alveolar septa that permanently decreases lung compliance and thickens the blood-gas barrier. The significance of these sequelae depends on the extent of lung involvement. The tremendous reserve capacity of the lung means that many animals have localized areas of pneumonia that are of no clinical significance, yet mild changes present throughout the lung can seriously compromise pulmonary function.\n\nInspired air carries a variety of particulates, including infectious agents, allergens, and inert particles. The site of particle deposition in the respiratory tract depends on their size, density, and charge. Particles larger than ~10 \u00b5m are almost completely removed in the nasal cavity, mainly by impaction at sites in the nasal turbinates where the airflow changes direction. Particles that are 3-10 \u00b5m are more likely to impact the mucosa of the trachea and bronchi, where they can be cleared by the mucociliary apparatus. In general, particles <5 \u00b5m have the greatest potential to reach the deep lung (terminal bronchioles and alveoli), although this is most common with smaller particles (1-2 \u00b5m). The velocity of airflow declines precipitously in the terminal airways because the total crosssectional area increases; as a result, particle deposition in the bronchioles and alveoli results from sedimentation, diffusion, and electrostatic charge.\n\nCoughing and mucociliary clearance are the major mechanisms for clearing particles that become entrapped in the airways. Mucociliary clearance of particles from distal airways requires 2-6 hours, and the presence of innate defense proteins within the airway mucus, described in more detail later, probably serves to limit bacterial growth during this time. Mucociliary clearance may be as rapid as 10 mm per minute in the trachea, but the pace in the bronchioles is more languid. The airways are covered by a periciliary liquid layer (formerly known as the sol or hypophase) and a superficial mucous layer. The mucous layer contains abundant glycoproteins that are sticky and tend to trap a wide variety of particles that impact on the airway surfaces. The function of the periciliary liquid layer has long been considered to simply provide an aqueous medium in which the cilia can beat. However, recent evidence indicates that this layer forms a periciliary brush composed of mucins that transiently tether the cilia to the overlying mucus, trap water to maintain hydration, and prevent the mucus and other luminal substances from entering the periciliary layer. The quality of the periciliary liquid layer is also critical for clearance of entrapped particulates, because the low viscosity of this fluid permits the cilia of the epithelial cells to beat effectively. Additionally, clearance of sputum from the larger airways by coughing requires that the periciliary liquid layer be fluid and abundant, allowing the superficial mucous layer Interstitial macrophages are the least well-understood class of pulmonary macrophages. Because of their location within the interstitium of the conducting airways and alveolar parenchyma, they are more difficult to isolate and characterize than other macrophage populations. In mice, interstitial macrophages have less phagocytic activity than alveolar macrophages, and instead are primarily immunomodulatory cells, expressing more major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and producing more cytokines, such as IL-1 and IL-6, than the alveolar macrophage.\n\nPulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMs) are unique mononuclear phagocytes found within the alveolar capillaries of select species, including cattle, sheep, goats, horses, pigs, cats, and cetaceans (eFig. 5-2). PIMs may be recruited into the lungs of rats and humans during inflammatory lung diseases, and this same process seems to occur in dogs. PIMs form membrane-adhesive complexes with the capillary endothelium, which keeps them localized to the vascular bed. These cells are highly phagocytic and play an important role in the clearance of circulating bacteria and particulates from the pulmonary circulation. PIMs release an array of proinflammatory mediators following interaction with particulates and bacterial endotoxin. Because of their proinflammatory properties, they can contribute to the lung injury coincident with acute lung inflammation. Depletion of PIMs can attenuate lung injury following experimental bacterial infections or exposure to endotoxin. \n\nThe necessary function of gas exchange requires that the lung remain exposed to the environment. Thus the lung is continuously challenged by immense quantities of microorganisms and foreign material in inhaled air, and by opportunistic pathogens within droplets that are aspirated from the nonsterile upper respiratory tract. Despite this constant bombardment, the lung must maintain the balance of normal microbiota now documented to reside in the lung and prevent increases in the numbers of noncommensal organisms in the alveoli, as such increases can induce inflammation that impedes gas exchange in the lung. Additionally, because of the tremendous blood flow through the lung, contamination of the lung by bacteria carries a significant risk of bacteremia. Thus the lung requires a multilayered system of defense against infectious agents. This is accomplished by the following:\n\n\u2022 Mucus lines the airways, entrapping particles and microbes, and is propelled by coughing or by ciliary beating to the pharynx, where it is swallowed. \u2022 Antibody and innate defense proteins kill microbes directly, prevent them from colonizing mucosal surfaces, and/or opsonize the microbes to make them more easily ingested by phagocytes.\n\neFigure 5-2 Pulmonary intravascular macrophages in a cat. Alveolar septa are thickened by increased number of macrophages, which contain phagocytosed erythrocytes (arrowheads) and hemosiderin (arrow).\n\nmacrophages are decorated with a variety of cell surface receptors that permit recognition of particles opsonized by antibody, complement, or collectins. In addition, CD14, Tolllike receptors, mannose receptors, and the scavenger receptor permit responses against bacteria that have not been previously encountered by the host. Alveolar macrophages phagocytose most opsonized particles within 2-4 hours, although the ingestion of inert particles such as carbon and silicates is much slower. Alveolar macrophages kill bacteria using reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and enzymes within their lysosomes. In addition, these cells promote an inflammatory response by secreting cytokines, including chemokines that recruit and activate neutrophils and macrophages. These newly recruited phagocytes are important in the clearance of more severe bacterial infections of the lung. Alveolar macrophages are integral to the immune response by presenting antigen, secreting cytokines that activate macrophages and modulate the immune response, and serving as effector cells in delayed hypersensitivity reactions. However, resident alveolar macrophages generally sequester or clear antigens and particulates from the alveoli without stimulating an immunoinflammatory response and without migration to regional lymph nodes. In contrast, when blood monocytes are recruited to the lung during inflammation and differentiate into macrophages, their phlogistic nature further stimulates local inflammation and immune responses.\n\nThe actual physical removal of particulates from alveoli is inefficient, in contrast to their removal when deposited on the mucociliary blanket. Most particles phagocytosed by macrophages are either inactivated or sequestered. Alveolar macrophages are mainly cleared through the bronchioles on the mucociliary blanket. As the particulate load increases, as occurs in pneumoconioses, some particles penetrate into the pulmonary interstitium by endocytosis across the type I pneumocytes, where they are phagocytosed by interstitial macrophages. Particle-laden macrophages often cluster around bronchioles and blood vessels, associated with local lymphatics (well illustrated by the common finding in dogs of carbonladen particles in the walls of terminal bronchioles), with some entering the lymphatics and eventually finding their way to local lymph nodes. In addition to the alveolar and interstitial macrophages, intravascular macrophages are present in the lung of cats, horses, ruminants, and pigs. These cells serve to remove infectious agents and other particles from the blood, and thus serve an analogous role to Kupffer cells in the liver and macrophages in splenic sinusoids.\n\nPulmonary immune responses are initiated when inhaled antigens are taken up by dendritic cells that inhabit the airway epithelium, and migrate to bronchial lymph nodes, where the antigen is presented to lymphocytes. Although bronchusassociated lymphoid tissue (BALT) is often visible histologically, this structure is not present in germ-free animals of most species and may represent a consequence of inflammation and antigenic stimulation. Homing of lymphocytes to BALT depends on \u03b1 4 \u03b2 1 -integrin/vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and chemokine receptor 10 (CCR10)/chemokine ligand 28 (CCL28). In contrast, migration of lymphocytes into alveolar tissue is exceptional because it occurs in capillaries rather than venules, and the homing receptors differ from those in the airways. These mechanisms allow T lymphocytes and natural killer cells to constantly survey the respiratory tissues, where they are most useful in defense against viruses, intracellular bacterial pathogens, and fungi.\n\nto be easily propelled. Finally, effective ciliary function is necessary for mucociliary clearance, and requires coordinated unidirectional ciliary beating at an adequate frequency of around 15 beats per second. The regulation of this system is not well known. However, shear stress on the epithelium both increases the ciliary beating frequency and promotes epithelial secretion to maintain the quality of the liquid and mucous layer. Nitric oxide, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate are other regulators of ciliary beat frequency.\n\nWhen entrapped particles reach the nasopharynx, they have the opportunity to interact with the well-developed lymphoid tissue in the tonsils and nasopharyngeal mucosa before reaching the pharynx and being swallowed. Although this clearance of inhaled particles is normally beneficial, it is a method for the spread of agents such as Mycobacterium bovis and Rhodococcus equi, and is important in the migration of helminth eggs and larvae. Mucociliary clearance may be impaired by infection of the airway epithelium with viruses, mycoplasmas, or Bordetella; exposure to cold air or ammonia; squamous metaplasia resulting from chronic bacterial infection or toxin exposure (cigarette smoke and environmental pollutants being the best-characterized examples); inherited anomalies of ciliary structure or function; or abnormal mucus production in human cystic fibrosis.\n\nThe mucus covering the airway mucosa contains a rich spectrum of antimicrobial factors, which operate by several distinct mechanisms. Some cause direct injury to pathogens, such as the \u03b2-defensins, cathelicidins, lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, the complement membrane attack complex, and anionic antimicrobial peptides. Lactoferrin binds iron and makes it unavailable for use by many bacteria, whereas neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin-secreted by airway and alveolar epithelial cells and by neutrophils-binds the bacterial siderophores that otherwise allow pathogens to scavenge ferric iron. Other components, including immunoglobulin A and polysaccharides within the mucus, block the attachment of bacteria to mucosal surfaces. Infectious agents may be opsonized by immunoglobulin G, the complement component C3b, and surfactant proteins A and D. Two families of antimicrobial proteins, defensins and collectins, deserve particular mention. The defensins are a family of 3-5 kDa, cationic, arginine-rich peptides that are present in neutrophil granules, intestinal Paneth cells, and epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchi. Some defensins are constitutively expressed, whereas others are rapidly induced by proinflammatory cytokines, lipopolysaccharide and other Toll-like receptor agonists, or cytokines secreted by T-helper-17 cells. The defensins are able to kill bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses by forming pores within microbial membranes that are rich in anionic phospholipids, and they also have roles in leukocyte chemotaxis and wound healing. The collectins are a family of calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding lectin proteins that include the surfactant proteins A and D. Both of these proteins are produced by type II pneumocytes; SP-A is also secreted by club cells in the bronchioles. These pulmonary collectins agglutinate and opsonize bacteria, viruses, and fungi, and also maintain surfactant homeostasis, have antioxidant activity, and bind lipopolysaccharide to regulate inflammatory responses.\n\nAlveolar macrophages are critical for defending the lung against particles that are deposited in alveoli, and also play a key role in recycling and removal of surfactant. Alveolar Thus the lung is protected from inhaled bacteria by the filtering effect of the nasal cavity, innate and acquired humoral defenses, mucociliary clearance in the airways, resident alveolar macrophages, recruited neutrophils and elicited macrophages, and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. These defenses can be considered in multiple layers, where most inhaled particles are removed in the nasal cavity or neutralized by innate defense proteins in the airway mucus prior to being cleared by the mucociliary apparatus. The small bronchioles seem to be a site of particular vulnerability, being poorly served by either mucociliary clearance or alveolar macrophages. Pathogens that reach the alveoli may be phagocytosed and killed by alveolar macrophages, particularly if the particles have been opsonized by complement or the surfactant proteins A and D, or by antibody if a previous encounter with the agent has resulted in an immune response. Still greater threats invoke a suppurative inflammatory response, which may be essential to clear bacteria from the lung but also carry the risk of compromised lung function and damage to the pulmonary tissue. \n\nThe responses of the respiratory tract to injury, and the resulting patterns of disease, are largely determined by the structural and functional complexity of the system. Most of the diseases of the respiratory system are caused by agents arriving by either the airborne (aerogenous) or blood-borne (hematogenous) routes, each with its own special pathogenetic considerations.\n\nThe upper respiratory tract comprises the air-conducting structures from the external nares to the upper third of the trachea, including the specialized system of paranasal sinuses, the auditory tubes, and the guttural pouches of horses. The anatomy of the upper respiratory tract is described previously. Functionally, this system conducts and conditions the air moving into and out of the lower respiratory tract during respiration. The upper airways, constantly exposed to materials from the external environment, play an important role in surveying the inspired air for pathogens and are exposed to a variety of potentially toxic particulates and gases.\n\nThe upper respiratory tract accounts for >50% of the airway resistance in the entire respiratory tract. This resistance leads to negative pressure during inspiration, shown to be greatest in the nasal cavity overlying the rostral aspect of the soft palate, the larynx, and the trachea; and indeed these correspond to disease hotspots, such as for dorsal displacement of the soft palate in racehorses and tracheal edema and hemorrhage syndrome of cattle. The anatomy of the upper airways is also important in the generation of species-specific vocalization in animals, and abnormal vocal sounds (stertor, stridor), as well as inspiratory dyspnea, are clinical indicators of diseases involving the upper airways. Jeffrey AM, et al. Nasal \n\nCongenital anomalies of the nasal cavity and sinuses are rare but occur in all species. They are usually part of more extensive craniofacial defects accompanied by various malformations of the mouth and eyes. Animals with absent, underdeveloped, or severely distorted nasal regions are usually stillborn or die immediately after birth because of the severity of the craniofacial defects. Choanal atresia is a failure of formation of one or both of the communications between the nasal cavity and nasopharynx. The condition is relatively common in llamas and alpacas, well recorded in foals, and has been described in dogs, sheep, and cats. The obstruction may be membranous or bony and unilateral or bilateral. Affected animals have partial or complete obstruction of airflow, exercise intolerance, or respiratory distress, or they develop aspiration pneumonia or malnutrition if mouth breathing interferes with suckling. The condition in llamas is often accompanied by other facial malformations.\n\nAs with other mucous membranes, the upper-airway mucosa has an indigenous immune system, the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) . NALT is considered to be a component of the broader mucosal-associated lymphoid system present in a variety of mucous membranes. The nasopharyngeal lymphoid (Waldeyer's) ring is a collection of lymphoid tissues that encircles the oropharynx and nasopharynx of animals. The degree of organization of this lymphoid tissue varies by species. In addition, there are lymphoid follicles and loose aggregates of mononuclear cells within the lamina propria. These lymphoid tissues induce a local immune response, and also stimulate a systemic immune reaction to nasally delivered antigens. This tissue is particularly prominent in foals, and gives a finely nodular appearance to the pharyngeal mucosa.\n\nThe organization of NALT is similar to mucosal lymphoid tissues at other sites. Specialized follicle-associated epithelium, with microfold (M) cells, covers the follicles and transfers antigen to the underlying lymphoid follicles. Within the follicles there are T-cell-and B-cell-rich regions, as well as dendritic cells and macrophages involved in antigen presentation. The formation of NALT is a postnatal event that is at least partly regulated by acquisition of commensal microbes in the nasopharynx. This resident microbial flora is often established by specific adherence of bacterial adhesins to carbohydrates on epithelial cells.\n\nIn addition to the role that nasopharyngeal commensals play in the formation of NALT, they can prevent colonization of the mucosa by more virulent organisms and modulate the immune response during infection. Injury to the nasal mucosa can allow infection of the underlying tissues by certain of the normal flora or, more importantly, affect surface binding sites so that adherence and colonization by pathogenic microorganisms can occur. Finally, disruption of the normal nasopharyngeal flora by prolonged antimicrobial therapy may result in fungal or opportunistic bacterial infections of the nasal cavity, further illustrating the role of these commensals in mucosal defense. Canessa C, et \n\nRhinitis, inflammation of nasal tissue, can be localized or a manifestation of systemic disease. The main causes include viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections; allergens; inhalation of irritant gases; and particulate dusts (Box 5-1). Most cases of significant acute rhinitis begin with serous exudation, which changes in the course of the disease to become catarrhal, purulent, or hemorrhagic. With pseudomembranous rhinitis, fibrinous membranes can be peeled off without leaving gross underlying defects. In contrast, fibrinonecrotic (diphtheritic) membranes adhere firmly to the underlying tissue, leave a raw ulcerated surface when removed, and are most commonly caused by inhalation of epitheliotoxic gases, alphaherpesviruses, or bacteria such as Fusobacterium necrophorum. Histologically, in acute rhinitis, the epithelial cells are normal or show hydropic degeneration, loss of cilia, or attenuation. Goblet cells may be inapparent from having secreted their contents, or may be hyperplastic. The lamina propria is lesions include nasal trauma, severe rhinitis (lymphoplasmacytic, eosinophilic, or suppurative), mycotic infections of the nasal cavity or the guttural pouch, tooth root abscesses, and neoplasms. In contrast, bilateral epistaxis may indicate a severe manifestation of the above, hemorrhagic diatheses such as those causing thrombocytopenia, or lesions in or distal to the nasopharynx. The latter include pulmonary contusions, purpura hemorrhagica in horses, exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage in horses, rupture of embolic pulmonary abscesses in cattle, pulmonary neoplasia or granulomas, pulmonary hypertension, or vasculitis. Animals with epistaxis that swallow the blood may have considerable amounts in the stomach. Mylonakis ME, et sessile or pedunculated polyps that may be mistaken clinically for neoplasms. Nasal/nasopharyngeal stenosis or cicatrix formation occurs in cats and horses, probably as a result of previous erosive rhinitis with fibrous organization of exudates. In horses, the typical lesion is circumferential weblike scarring of the mucosa in the laryngopharynx rostral to the epiglottis, but may be elsewhere in the pharynx, nasal cavity, or trachea. In cats, nasopharyngeal stenosis appears as more uniform membranous narrowing of the opening between the nasopharynx and the caudal nasal cavity. The histologic findings are chronic nonspecific rhinitis and/or granulation tissue with chronic hemorrhage. Clinical signs often include upper respiratory noise or respiratory distress in the absence of much discharge. Rarely, the inspiratory efforts resulting from bilateral nasal obstruction can lead to hiatal hernia and megaesophagus. edematous and contains inflammatory cells that often infiltrate the epithelium and may be visible in the surface exudate.\n\nChronic rhinitis may be classified by the nature of the leukocytic infiltrate, but caution should be exercised in equating this with a specific cause. For example, suppurative rhinitis can result from bacterial infection, aspergillosis, or an inhaled foreign body, but is a common nonspecific response to mucosal injury of other causes. Eosinophils predominate in the lesions of allergic rhinitis but may also be the dominant granulocyte in the tissue adjacent to fungal plaques or carcinomas. Lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis is a common reaction pattern in chronic nasal disease of diverse etiology. The nasal epithelium in chronic rhinitis is often attenuated because of necrosis or may develop squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Other features of chronic inflammation include hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue, fibrosis of the lamina propria with atrophy of the glands, and BOX \u2022 5-1 \n\n\u2022 Salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae \u2022 Oestrus ovis \u2022 Enzootic nasal tumor there appears to be a familial predisposition in Jersey cattle, and to a limited extent in other cattle, the existence of susceptible \"atopic\" animals has been proposed. The condition is therefore sometimes referred to as atopic rhinitis. Specific infectious causes of suppurative rhinitis deserve mention. Salmonella enterica ssp. diarizonae (specifically, serovar 61:k:1,5,[7]) causes flock problems in sheep, with mucoid nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, and granular swelling or sessile polyp formation in the ventral conchae. Histologically, there is polypoid hyperplasia of the mucosa with intraepithelial bacteria and infiltration of neutrophils. Streptococcus canis and Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus cause outbreaks or sporadic cases of rhinitis and sinusitis in dogs and cats, with extension through the cribriform plate leading to fatal meningitis. Aspergillus fumigatus commonly causes nasal disease in dogs and cats, with ulceration and suppurative or eosinophilic rhinitis in which the fungal hyphae are found mainly in plaques on the mucosal surface. However, suppurative rhinitis is also a nonspecific reaction to foreign bodies, neoplasms, bacterial infection, tooth root infections, oronasal fistula, and other causes.\n\nInfectious causes of granulomatous rhinitis, with or without eosinophils, are diverse and are discussed in detail later (see Infectious diseases of the respiratory system). Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gatti are readily recognized by the thick capsule; acapsular strains occur and incite more granulomatous inflammation but are recognized by the narrowbased budding. Conidiobolus spp. and Basidiobolus haptosporus cause granulomatous masses in the caudal nasal cavity of horses and ruminants that may invade surrounding tissues and disseminate to lung or brain. Histologically, granulomas contain macrophages, many giant cells, few eosinophils, central necrosis, and negatively stained fungal hyphae embedded in Splendore-Hoeppli material; silver stains reveal the hyphae to be 8-20 \u00b5m diameter, infrequently septate, with nonparallel walls and bulbous dilations. Although comparable, lesions caused by Pythium insidiosum occlude mainly the rostral nasal cavity, induce eosinophilic inflammation, and have smaller hypha-like oomycetes that are 2-7 \u00b5m diameter and infrequently septate with thick nonparallel walls. Rhinosporidium seeberi causes inflamed polyps with sporangia that are 15-75 \u00b5m or much larger and commonly have endosporulation. Granulomatous rhinitis caused by the yeast Candida parapsilosis is reported in an immunosuppressed cat. Nodular granulomatous rhinitis with eosinophils caused by Pseudallescheria boydii is described in dogs and cattle. Besnoitia spp. causes lesions in many organs, but the characteristic 150-450 \u00b5m diameter thick-walled protozoan cysts are often found in the nares, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, or larynx. Finally, Prototheca wickerhamii and P. zopfii affect the mucocutaneous junction of the nares in addition to the skin, with necrotizing pyogranulomatous lesions containing septated sporangia that are 3-15 \u00b5m and 7-30 \u00b5m diameter, respectively.\n\nA variety of toxic agents cause necrosis of nasal respiratory or olfactory epithelium. These may be direct-acting irritants or toxins. Further, because of the cytochrome P450-dependent biotransformation activity of the nasal mucosa, systemic toxins such as acetaminophen, vincristine, coumarins, naphthalene, polychlorinated biphenyls, methimazole, and 3-methylindole target the nasal epithelium in some species. These are particularly well studied in rodents, but toxic nasal disease is not often investigated in domestic animals.\n\nIdiopathic lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis is an important condition in dogs, and to a lesser extent in cats. In dogs, the clinical disease may be either unilateral or bilateral, although histologic lesions are usually bilateral. Grossly, there is increased mucus production, mucosal inflammation, and turbinate destruction. Histologically, lymphocytes and plasma cells predominate, but neutrophils may be present. Chronic inflammation may lead to diffuse or polypoid thickening of the nasal mucosa and obstruction of nasal passages. The fibrotic stroma is heavily infiltrated by lymphocytes and plasma cells, and the surface epithelium may be hyperplastic, eroded, or undergo squamous metaplasia. The cause and pathogenesis of this disease remain unknown. It seems reasonable to consider that following an unknown initial insult, there develops a selfpropagating cycle that involves dysregulation of the local immune system, resulting in mucosal damage and further infection by normally nonpathogenic commensal flora and self-sustaining inflammation. Nevertheless, lymphoplasmacytic inflammation is a common reaction of the nasal mucosa to injury, and occult causes such as foreign body, bacterial or fungal infection, or neoplasia must be ruled out.\n\nAllergic rhinitis is observed sporadically in most domestic species. The disease in dogs is diagnosed on the basis of chronic and often seasonal oculonasal discharge, sneezing, noserubbing, head-shaking, and perhaps epistaxis, and the presence of eosinophils in nasal exudate . There is no definitive information on either the pathologic or immunologic basis of the condition, but it is assumed to be a type I hypersensitivity. Cattle, and occasionally sheep, develop a seasonal rhinitis that available evidence suggests is an allergic response to pollen antigens. A familial predisposition has been reported, and the disease occurs chiefly in the summertime when pastures are in bloom. Affected animals have nasal discharge, lacrimation, sneezing, and evidence of nasal itching. The nasal mucosa is pale and thick from edema, and mucosal erosions may be visible in the rostral nares. Eosinophils and mucus are a prominent component of the exudate. Histologically, the surviving nasal epithelium is hyperplastic or eroded and is infiltrated by eosinophils. The glandular epithelium can be hypertrophied, and mucus is produced in excess. In more severe cases, in which there is extensive superficial diphtheresis, many of the small mucosal vessels show fibrinoid necrosis.\n\nNasal \"granuloma\" in cattle is generally considered to be a more chronic form of allergic rhinitis. The affected mucosa is mainly in the caudal portion of the nasal vestibule and the rostral region of the ventral nasal cavity but may extend caudally even to the larynx and proximal trachea. Grossly, the hyperplastic epithelium is granular or has multiple nodular projections covered by intact epithelium, and catarrhal exudate may be present. Histologically, the nodules typically consist of hyperplastic epithelium with areas of squamous metaplasia or ulceration, covering a superficial edematous lamina propria with a central core of inflamed granulation tissue. Goblet cell hyperplasia is more pronounced in the ducts of the nasal glands, at the lateral boundaries of the nodules. Eosinophils infiltrate the superficial lamina propria and epithelium, and lymphocytes, plasma cells, and mast cells are increased in number. Vascular proliferation, fibroplasia, and accumulation of mostly lymphocytes and plasma cells in the cores of nodules are features of chronicity. It is believed that the condition is an allergic reaction to plant pollens or fungal spores. Because\n\neFigure 5-3 Eosinophilic rhinitis in a dog. Eosinophils infiltrate the lamina propria and the epithelium. This case was allergic rhinitis, but similar lesions can be found adjacent to carcinomas or fungal plaques. sinusitis. In these chronic inflammatory lesions, mucosal and submucosal hyperplasia may become florid enough to form a discernible mass within the nasal cavity or sinuses. Whereas this change is a nonspecific remodeling response in the nasal cavity, there are 2 specific types of polyps in domestic species, whose clinical features and pathology are distinctive.\n\nProgressive ethmoid hematomas (PEH, hemorrhagic nasal polyp) of horses arise from the ethmoid turbinate region of the equine nasal cavity. These masses usually occur in older horses, and may be more common in the Thoroughbred and Arabian breeds. PEH are usually unilateral hemorrhagic growths arising from the submucosa of the ethmoid turbinates. The cause and pathogenesis of PEH remain to be determined, although it is assumed that it represents an aberrant vasoproliferative response to submucosal hemorrhage. The lesions are progressive and may continue to enlarge until the cylindrical mass extends to the external nares. Grossly, PEH is a mottled, hemorrhagic fibrovascular mass that can fill the ipsilateral nasal meatus, or occasionally grow into the maxillary sinus. Histologically, PEH mostly consists of organizing hemorrhages of various ages with extensive siderosis and mineralization of connective tissue fibers and vessel walls. The inflammatory response is variable, but multinucleated giant cells are usually present within the stroma. The surface is often covered by attenuated epithelium with underlying glands, or squamous metaplasia may occur. Ulceration of the surface epithelium is common.\n\nNasopharyngeal polyps of cats are non-neoplastic inflammatory masses arising within the middle ear or auditory tube . Clinical disease is seen primarily in young cats 1-3 years of age. The clinical signs are dependent on the location of the polyp. Extension of the mass into the pharynx is associated with dyspnea, dysphagia, and gagging; involvement of the nasal cavity may cause sneezing, nasal discharge, and protrusion through the nares, whereas involvement of the middle ear may result in ataxia, Horner's syndrome, and/or facial nerve paralysis. The cause and pathogenesis are not known, although the appearance of the lesions suggests progressive expansion of the mucosa in response to localized chronic inflammation. Histologically, feline nasopharyngeal polyps \n\nInflammation of the paranasal sinuses often goes undetected unless it has caused facial deformity or a fistula in the overlying skin. In acute catarrhal or purulent rhinitis, the mucosal swelling tends to occlude the orifices of the sinuses and impair drainage. The secretions and exudates then accumulate and predispose to bacterial infection and chronic purulent sinusitis. The accumulation of seromucinous secretion is referred to as mucocele, and the accumulation of purulent exudate is known as empyema of the sinus (eFig. 5-4). Sinusitis follows penetration of infection in dehorning wounds, fractures, and periodontitis. It is common in sheep infected with larvae of Oestrus ovis. Sinusitis is of most significance in the horse because of the size and complexity of its paranasal sinuses and the compounding effects of limited drainage and tendency for periodontitis to extend to the sinuses. In horses, primary sinusitis is most frequent in the maxillary sinus, but the exudates in the ventral conchal sinus are more likely to be inspissated and therefore respond more poorly to therapy. Other sinus diseases of horses include dental sinusitis from apical infection of a maxillary cheek tooth, oromaxillary fistula, mycosis, cysts, trauma, or progressive hematoma. Reported equine sinus neoplasms include cementoma, benign fibro-osseous tumor, myxoma, lymphoma, and carcinoma. \n\nSialoceles and nasal glandular mucoceles occasionally expand into the nasal cavity or nasopharynx with similar morphology to those found elsewhere (5) (6) . Polypoid thickening of the nasal mucosa can occur in cases of chronic rhinitis and \n\neFigure 5-4 Chronic suppurative sinusitis with empyema of the sinus (arrows) in a cat.\n\neFigure 5-5 Nasopharyngeal sialocele in a dog. Lakes of mucus (left) are poorly demarcated from the adjacent connective tissue.\n\neFigure 5-6 Nasal glandular mucocele in a dog. The nasal gland is markedly distended by mucus, with no inflammatory reaction.\n\nless of the type, locally invasive growth is the usual reason for euthanasia. Stage I neoplasms have unilateral growth resulting in nasal discharge with or without blood. Stage II neoplasms are bilateral and may cause dyspnea from obstruction of the nasal cavity. Stage III neoplasms invade adjacent tissues, such as nasal, palatine, or facial bones to cause facial distortion or ocular discharge, the retro-orbital space to cause exophthalmos, or the cribriform plate and brain to cause seizures or depression. These consequences of invasive growth are the usual reason for euthanasia, and metastasis occurs relatively late in the course of disease. Median survival time in dogs is ~3 months, and the presence of epistaxis confers a worse prognosis. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type, and the diagnosis is based on identifying an invasive carcinoma, with formation of many or few acini, tubules, or papillary structures . Occasional cases have prominent mucin production. Adenoid cystic carcinomas are formed by nests and cords of neoplastic basal-like cells with scant cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei; these cellular nests have a cribriform pattern with sharply demarcated \"punched out\" centers containing consist of a loose fibrovascular core covered by ciliated respiratory or squamous epithelium. Even when the surface epithelium has undergone squamous metaplasia, ciliated cells are usually visible within nests of epithelial cells buried in the stroma. The stroma is infiltrated by a mixed chronic inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages; surface erosions, when present, elicit neutrophil infiltration of the stroma. Recurrence of the polyps is relatively common when removed by simple traction, if the base of the mass is not excised. A second form of feline nasal polyps arises from nasal turbinate; consists of fibrous tissue, woven bone, and blood-filled spaces; and is covered by columnar ciliated epithelium. These have been termed inflammatory polyps of the nasal turbinates of cats or feline mesenchymal nasal hamartoma.\n\nParanasal sinus cysts in foals or young adult horses are within a maxillary or frontal sinus, and have a thin bony wall lined by respiratory epithelium and filled with fluid. The masses can distort the profile of the maxillary bone sufficiently to cause obstruction of the ipsilateral nasal passage, destruction of the nasal turbinates, distortion of the teeth, and deviation of the nasal septum. Cystic nasal conchae are congenital lesions that cause progressive nasal obstruction with inspiratory and expiratory noise in cattle. They are bilateral or unilateral, and otherwise similar to those of horses. Epidermal inclusion cysts lined by stratified squamous epithelium are described in the nasal diverticulum (false nostril) of horses and have been seen in dogs. Conti MB, et \n\nAlthough primary neoplastic disease of the nasal cavity and sinuses of domestic animals is not common, pathologists frequently examine nasal biopsy specimens to rule out such disease. Primary nasal neoplasia is most frequent in the dog and cat, with fewer reports in horses. Most nasal epithelial neoplasms in sheep and goats are of retroviral etiology (see Infectious respiratory diseases of sheep and goats, later). Interestingly, there is some epidemiologic evidence of a link between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and coalburning and kerosene heat sources, and the development of nasal neoplasms in dogs. Origin from the nasal cavity is usual in dogs and cats, whereas in horses, tumors of the paranasal sinuses are most common. Because of the inflexible osseous encasement, even benign growths can be associated with significant clinical disease. In general, most neoplasms of the nasal cavity and sinuses are carcinomas, followed in decreasing frequency by chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and osteosarcoma.\n\nNasal carcinomas are common in dogs and cats, and are classified as adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, transitional carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, oncocytoma, and undifferentiated (solid) carcinoma. Regard-Olfactory neuroblastoma (esthesioneuroblastoma, esthesioneuroepithelioma) is a rare neoplasm derived from olfactory neuroepithelium and arising in the ethmoid conchae. The neoplastic cells form indistinct serpiginous ribbons, nests, or lobules with delicate fibrovascular stroma, and are epithelioid but have indistinct borders and scant cytoplasm. Rosette formation is a characteristic feature (Fig. 5-7) , more frequent in cats than dogs, and includes pseudorosettes (neoplastic cells palisading around a blood vessel), Homer-Wright rosettes (neoplastic cells arranged around neurofibrillary material), and infrequent Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes (neoplastic cells arranged around an empty space). Neurofibrillary material often separates the cells, mineralization may be present, and necrosis is usually extensive in dogs and cats. Immunohistochemistry for chromogranin and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) may be helpful, although nonspecific background staining can be problematic with NSE, and synaptophysin is often negative. Neuron-specific markers such as microtubuleassociated protein 2 (MAP-2) and NeuN are more specific but less widely available. Because some are cytokeratin positive, this is not useful in distinguishing olfactory neuroblastoma from adenocarcinoma. A grading scheme is proposed, with higher-grade tumors having lack of lobular architecture, fibrillary matrix or mineralization, few or no rosettes, and a greater degree of nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis, and mitotic activity. Penetration through the cribriform plate and into the cerebral cortex is commonly observed.\n\nOf the round-cell neoplasms, lymphoma is most frequent, particularly in cats. Nasal lymphoma in cats is usually primary, arising from the nasal cavity or uncommonly the nasopharynx, and is not associated with retroviral infection. Less often, nasal tissues can be secondarily affected in cases of multiorgan lymphoma. Feline nasal lymphoma is easily confused with carcinoma, because the large neoplastic cells are often arranged as dense sheets, and faint packeting can result from the presence of delicate bands of stroma. The vast majority are of diffuse large B-cell phenotype, but low-grade follicular B-cell lymphoma as well T-cell lymphoma do occur. Epitheliotropism suggests a T-cell phenotype, yet nasal epitheliotropic B-cell lymphoma is reported. Diffuse large B-cell nasal lymphoma can develop in other organs as the disease progresses basophilic mucus. Lakes of this same material are present between the nests of cells. Transitional carcinomas (nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinomas) form nodules or nests of stratified cuboidal epithelium that lack keratinization ; microcysts are sometimes present within the epithelial layers and must be distinguished from the acini seen in adenocarcinomas. Adenosquamous (mucoepidermoid) carcinomas have mucin-filled acinar components and foci with squamous differentiation, and are reported to be more aggressive tumors. Squamous cell carcinomas are similar to those seen in other organs, with nodules or nests of epithelial cells that keratinize to form abundant glassy eosinophilic cytoplasm and occasional central aggregates of keratin. These are frequent tumors in the cat, where most originate from the nasal vestibule, and in the horse, where the maxillary sinus is a common site. Acinic cell carcinomas have a faintly packeted or acinar arrangement of cells that resemble salivary serous cells, with abundant pale cytoplasm containing fine basophilic periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive diastase-resistant granules; this type is invasive, but metastases are not expected. Oncocytomas form cords or nests of large epithelioid cytokeratinpositive cells with angular borders, with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm containing numerous mitochondria that appear as fine phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin (PTAH)-positive granules; the few cases reported had either noninvasive or invasive growth habits. Neuroendocrine carcinomas have delicate septa of fibrous stroma separating nests or packets of neoplastic epithelial cells and express synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and other markers of neuroendocrine differentiation. Because these markers are also expressed by some adenocarcinomas, the morphologic features are essential for the diagnosis. Undifferentiated carcinomas are solid epithelial neoplasms that lack the patterns of differentiation mentioned previously. Differential diagnoses for nasal carcinomas in general include lymphoma, olfactory neuroblastoma, and amelanotic malignant melanoma. The distinction between carcinoma and lymphoma can be particularly difficult in cats, and immunohistochemistry may be needed to resolve uncertainty. Benign epithelial neoplasms are rare but include papilloma (eFig. 5-7), adenoma, and basal cell tumor (of the vestibule). The pharynx, as the site where the respiratory and alimentary systems conjoin, is exposed to both inhaled and ingested materials, some of which may have deleterious effects on the animal. In pigs, a caudal diverticulum of the pharynx lies immediately dorsal to the esophagus. In young pigs, plant awns and similar foreign materials occasionally lodge in this diverticulum, causing pharyngitis and cellulitis that may lead to dysphagia and death from starvation. Iatrogenic pharyngitis, even with perforation of the caudodorsal wall of the pharynx, may occur in cattle during incorrect oral administration of boluses or esophageal intubation.\n\nIn young horses, it is common to find prominent lymphoid follicles within the pharyngeal mucosa. This is usually an incidental finding, as these follicles are part of the normal mucosal immune system in the horse (eFig. 5-9).\n\nThe guttural pouches of equids are ventral diverticula of the auditory tubes. Suppurative inflammation leading to guttural pouch empyema occurs mostly after upper respiratory infections, particularly with Streptococcus equi or other streptococci. Guttural pouch mycosis, generally caused by Aspergillus spp., causes fibrinonecrotic inflammation that extends deeply to invade vessels and other structures . Thus severe complications are much more likely than for guttural pouch empyema. Guttural pouch inflammation can extend to involve nearby vessels, cranial nerves (VII, IX, X, XI, XII), and the cranial sympathetic trunk, or even spread to adjacent bones, middle ear, brain, or atlanto-occipital joint. Thus erosion of the internal or external carotid artery or the maxillary artery causes epistaxis, damage to the glossopharyngeal or vagus nerves causes dysphagia, damage to the cranial sympathetic trunk or cranial cervical ganglion causes Horner's syndrome, or damage to the facial nerve causes facial paralysis. Other complications include laryngeal hemiparesis, or permanent dorsal displacement of the soft palate. Guttural pouch hemorrhage may also result from fracture of the basisphenoid bone. A less common condition is guttural pouch tympany. This (22-67% of cases, depending on the study), but invasion of local tissues, including brain, is the more common clinical problem. Other round cell tumors of the nasal cavity include mast cell tumor, melanoma, and transmissible venereal tumor.\n\nOf the mesenchymal neoplasms, chondrosarcoma is most frequent followed by osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. The appearance is typical of that in other tissues . Paranasal meningioma occurs in dogs and horses, and in dogs appears similar to intracranial meningioma but has a more invasive behavior. Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma in dogs forms a papillary mass composed of loose proliferative fibrous tissue with numerous tiny branching capillaries, with infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Despite the benign histologic appearance, these masses have an aggressive, locally invasive growth habit. Nasomaxillary tumors of young horses, including fibrosarcoma, ossifying fibroma, and fibrous dysplasia, are described elsewhere (see Vol. 1, Bones and joints). Other mesenchymal tumors of the nasal cavity include melanoma, hemangiosarcoma, and fibroma. Brosinski K, et al \n\neFigure 5-9 Pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia in a foal. The nodularity of the pharynx, epiglottis, and larynx are considered normal in young animals.\n\nMicroscopic examination of affected nerve fibers reveals severe loss of myelinated fibers in middle and distal portions of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Ultrastructural features indicate progressive loss of fibers in the left recurrent nerve accompanied by chronic demyelination, remyelination, and abortive regenerative attempts. Similar but milder changes can be detected ultrastructurally in the distal right recurrent nerve. The axons in the left recurrent laryngeal nerve are much longer than those in the right recurrent nerve, and this presumably makes them more susceptible to degeneration. Idiopathic laryngeal paralysis in horses-the most common form encountered-is unilateral, whereas bilateral paralysis is more typical of cases caused by hepatic encephalopathy and general anesthesia.\n\nLaryngeal paralysis in dogs occurs most commonly in older males of large or giant breeds as well as Labrador retrievers. The condition is less common in cats. The disease is usually bilateral, in contrast to that in horses. Although the cause is often not identified, the relationship between recurrent laryngeal axonopathy and denervation atrophy of the laryngeal muscles is usually as described in horses. In dogs, unlike horses, laryngeal paralysis may be a single manifestation of generalized neuromuscular disease. Some breeds of dogs are predisposed to developing laryngeal paralysis, including Bouvier des Flandres and mixed Husky-Malamute puppies, where it is associated with apparent hereditary degeneration of the nucleus ambiguus; Rottweilers, as a manifestation of a polyneuropathy; and white-coated German Shepherd dogs. Occasionally, laryngeal paralysis occurs secondary to hypothyroidism or following general anesthesia. In dogs, laryngeal paralysis predisposes to aspiration pneumonia.\n\nLaryngeal edema may be part of a local or systemic inflammatory process, and can be caused by infections of the laryngeal mucosa or surrounding connective tissues, inhalation of irritant materials, local trauma, anaphylaxis, or hyperthermia. The amount of edema varies, but is most severe in the region of the epiglottis, the aryepiglottic folds, and the ventricles. Mild laryngeal edema is a common incidental finding in many species at autopsy.\n\nLaryngitis accompanies inflammatory diseases of either the upper or lower respiratory tract, or can occur without involvement of other tissues. Laryngitis can occur as a part of oral necrobacillosis (calf diphtheria) caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum in calves and swine. Laryngeal erosions can develop in response to exposure to noxious agents, such as anhydrous ammonia (eFig. 5-10). Laryngeal ulcers occur in feedlot cattle with bronchopneumonia, and probably represent mucosal damage by the repeated trauma of laryngeal closure in dyspneic animals. Laryngeal infarcts with ulceration may overlie lesions of septic phlebitis in calves with Histophilus somni septicemia and pneumonia. Inhalation or aspiration of toxicants is a rare cause of laryngeal and epithelial necrosis (see eFig. 5-4). The nematode parasite Mammomonogamus laryngeus can inhabit the laryngeal surface of cattle.\n\nLaryngeal lesions in racing horses occur commonly. The simplest form is small mucosal ulcers in a variety of locations. Laryngeal chondritis (arytenoid chondropathy) is characterized by ulceration of mucosa at the rostral margin of the arytenoid cartilage, immediately caudal to the attachment of the vocal fold, resulting in deformation of the laryngeal cartilage (eFig. 5-11). The histologic lesions include variable combinations of chronic suppurative inflammation, granulomatous inflammation, granulation tissue, and necrosis of cartilage. The is seen mostly in young animals, and the accumulation of air is presumed to be due to valvular action of the nasopharyngeal orifice of the auditory tube. Tumors of the guttural pouches are rare, but squamous cell carcinoma is most likely. Pharyngeal tumors are discussed with neoplasia of the mouth (see Vol. 2, Alimentary system and peritoneum).\n\nBorges AS, Watanabe MJ. Guttural pouch diseases causing neurologic dysfunction in the horse. Vet Clin North Am Equine Pract 2011;27: 545-572.\n\nIn the horse, subepiglottic cysts are believed to arise from thyroglossal duct remnants. Entrapment of the epiglottis below the aryepiglottic fold is usually associated with congenital hypoplasia or acquired shortening or distortion of the epiglottis. A short epiglottis also predisposes to dorsal displacement of the soft palate, and these conditions sometimes occur together. Persistent frenulum of the epiglottis has been reported in newborn foals, predisposing to oronasal reflux of milk after nursing and aspiration pneumonia. The persistent frenulum of the epiglottis leads to dorsal displacement of the soft palate, which can be assessed endoscopically. Laryngeal paralysis in horses is frequently subclinical but may cause abnormal respiratory noise (roaring) and poor performance. The condition is almost always a left-sided hemiplegia caused by idiopathic degeneration of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The resulting denervation atrophy affects the intrinsic laryngeal muscles supplied by this nerve, but the atrophy is not uniform; the lateral cricoarytenoid muscle is affected first and most severely, followed by the dorsal cricoarytenoid. Grossly, the affected muscles are pale and atrophic ( Fig. 5-9 ). The cricothyroid muscle, which is supplied by the cranial laryngeal nerve, is the only intrinsic muscle not affected. Because the dorsal cricoarytenoid muscle is the main abductor of the larynx, denervation atrophy and dysfunction of this muscle allows the left arytenoid cartilage to sag into the lumen and obstruct airflow during inspiration. \n\nFurther reading Archer RM, et al. Guttural \n\nBrachycephalic airway syndrome is a constellation of lesions occurring in brachycephalic dogs and to a lesser extent in cats. It may include stenotic nares, insufficient pharyngeal space for the soft palate (\"elongation\" and thickening of the soft palate), and tracheal hypoplasia. In this syndrome, tracheal hypoplasia appears as reduced diameter of the lumen resulting from small tracheal rings, with an inapparent dorsal tracheal ligament. Greater negative intraluminal pressures during forced inspiration secondarily cause eversion of laryngeal saccules, hypertrophied and folded pharyngeal mucosa, everted tonsils, laryngeal edema, collapse of the larynx, and/or collapse of the trachea with overlapping of the ends of the cartilage rings . These factors aggravate the problem by further obstructing airflow, as does mucosal thickening or exudates resulting from tracheitis or pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia is often present in fatal cases. A comparable condition resulting from narrowing of the larynx occurs in Norwich Terriers. Tracheal collapse refers to dorsoventral narrowing of the trachea resulting in coughing and exercise intolerance. The disease is most common in middle-aged miniature breeds of dogs and is described in miniature horses. The cartilage rings are abnormally shaped and form shallow arcs, and the dorsal tracheal muscle (tracheal membrane) is widened and flaccid ( Fig. 5-12 ). The condition is not limited to the trachea; bronchoscopy reveals bronchomalacia and collapse in many affected dogs. Earlier descriptions of the histologic and histochemical features associated with tracheal collapse describe foci of hypocellularity of the hyaline cartilage and areas where cartilage is replaced by fibrous and/or fibrocartilaginous tissue. It remains to be determined if these changes are causative or the result of biomechanical changes resulting from the tracheal collapse.\n\nTracheal edema and hemorrhage syndrome of feedlot cattle, in which the lumen is partially obstructed by severe mucosal and submucosal edema and hemorrhage of the dorsal region of the distal half of the trachea, occasionally causes death by asphyxiation in feedlot cattle ( Fig. 5-13 ). The loud inspiratory noise made by severely affected animals has given rise to the clinical term \"honker syndrome.\" The cause is not pathogenesis is not known, but may involve mucosal trauma as the larynx closes forcefully in rapidly breathing animals, with introduction of bacteria that stimulate inflammation and cartilage degradation.\n\nPrimary neoplasms of the larynx are rare in domestic species. Papillomas involving the larynx are usually part of widespread papillomatosis, as may be seen in immunocompromised animals. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor. The laryngeal epithelium has a florid hyperplastic response to underlying inflammation, so care should be taken in differentiating (non-neoplastic) pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia from laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Plasmacytoma is a round cell tumor with eccentric nuclei, abundant glassy cytoplasm, and occasional karyomegaly or multinucleation. As for alimentary plasmacytoma, laryngeal plasmacytoma has a more aggressive course than those arising in skin. Laryngeal neoplasms consisting of cells with abundant granular cytoplasm include rhabdomyoma, oncocytoma, and granular cell tumor. Laryngeal rhabdomyoma occurs in young dogs as a solitary benign raised nodule in or near the lateral ventricle of the larynx (eFig. 5-12). It consists of lobular masses of angular pleomorphic cells with abundant deeply eosinophilic granular or foamy cytoplasm . Although this appearance has been interpreted as an oncocytoma, the diagnosis of rhabdomyoma is confirmed by demonstrating myosin and muscle-specific actin by using immunohistochemistry. Granular cell tumor, probably of Schwann cell origin, is less common in the larynx than in the tongue of dogs. The neoplastic cells have abundant cytoplasm with fine PAS-positive diastase-resistant granules (lysosomes and phagosomes), and are positive for S100 and vimentin. A miscellany of other neoplasms is described in the larynx (eFig. 5-13). Aitken The larynx is hypoplastic, with thickening of the mucosa and a narrow lumen. The trachea could be stretched to normal diameter, but is collapsed from excessively negative inspiratory pressure, causing overlap of the ends of the cartilage rings. Tracheal carcinoma is recognized in cats and rarely in dogs. Tracheal chondroma and osteochondroma is an uncommon condition of young dogs, and may represent a dysplastic cartilaginous mass rather than a true neoplasm. It forms an expansile mass of disorganized cartilage, with ossification of the central core of some lesions. known, but the increased prevalence during hot weather and the frequent presence of concurrent bronchopneumonia suggest that hyperpnea with negative intratracheal pressures during inspiration may cause mechanical injury to the tracheal mucosa.\n\nMiscellaneous lesions occur uncommonly in the trachea. Tracheal froth is normally present (eFig. 5-14), may increase as a result of pulmonary edema, but is abundant in normal sheep and horses at autopsy. Malformations of the cross-sectional shape of the trachea can be found as an incidental finding, especially in cattle. Tracheal trauma, such as during dystocia, causes fracture or collapse of the cartilage. Necrosis of tracheal epithelium occurs after endotracheal intubation if the cuff is inflated with excessive pressure. Squamous metaplasia of tracheal epithelium is a feature of vitamin A deficiency and severe iodide toxicosis. Black discoloration of the tracheobronchial mucosa is seen with smoke inhalation (Fig. 5-14) . Foci of chronic polypoid tracheitis, probably as a result of chronic inflammation, are occasionally observed in dogs and cats and may cause stenosis and dyspnea. Pox viruses (lumpy skin disease and sheep pox) cause hyperplastic nodules in the This cholinergic neural innervation coordinates the fetal airway contractions mentioned previously.\n\nThe coordination of intrauterine and extrauterine lung development and growth is complex and influenced by both local tissue factors as well as influences originating beyond the developing lung. Local epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, outlined previously, are necessary for directing the distal expansion of the lungs; indeed, the formation of the diverticula from the foregut endoderm, branching morphogenesis, and cell differentiation are specifically coordinated by the adjacent lung-specific mesenchyme. In each stage of lung development, a number of diffusible mediators and transcription factors direct organogenesis. Examples include the fibroblast growth factor family, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, and the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. Castleman \n\nCongenital anomalies of the lung are rare and may reflect abnormal development of the lung bud, pulmonary circulation, or both. Major malformations such as pulmonary agenesis are incompatible with life and are often accompanied by malformations in other organs. When investigating congenital masses of lung-like tissue, key observations include the location of the lesion and whether it is contained within the pleura or not, the continuity of the trachea and primary bronchus with the bronchi within the mass, and the nature of the pulmonary and systemic arterial supplies. Pulmonary hypoplasia is defined as reduced lung weight; hypoplastic lungs usually also have reduced numbers of alveoli . In contrast, the airways generally develop normally. Pulmonary hypoplasia may accompany malformations in other organs, and may include anasarca. Its development is closely linked to the presence of lung liquid that is secreted by the pulmonary epithelium, fills the airspaces, and is required for growth of the lung mass. Pulmonary hyperplasia is the result of overdistension of the lung, resulting from tracheal obstruction or laryngeal paralysis. In contrast, pulmonary hypoplasia ensues if the lung volume is not maintained. Pulmonary hypoplasia is caused by conditions that compress the lung, including congenital diaphragmatic hernia, intrathoracic masses, pleural effusions, or malformations of the thoracic cage; by oligohydramnios, in which the reduced uterine volume causes abnormal fetal positioning that compresses the chest and lungs; by impaired fetal breathing movements from abnormalities of the fetal nervous or musculoskeletal systems; by a tracheal fistula; and perhaps by reduced fluid secretion as a result of fetal hypoxemia or high levels of epinephrine.\n\nBronchogenic cysts and accessory lungs probably arise from aberrant (ectopic) outpouchings of the foregut. Bronchogenic\n\nThe lungs develop early in gestation, forming from a ventral diverticulum in the foregut endoderm. The 6 stages of lung development and growth are the embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, alveolar, and vascular maturation stages. Important development continues postnatally in most mammalian species.\n\nDuring the embryonic stage of lung growth (30-50 days of gestation in a bovine fetus), the primordial trachea and right and left primary bronchi develop, growing into the surrounding mesenchyme. The growth of the conducting airways occurs primarily in the pseudoglandular stage; in most species, the airways develop through a series of asymmetrical dichotomous branching. Differentiation of conducting airway epithelial cells begins proximally and extends distally at this stage, with development of ciliated cells, mucous cells, basal cells, and bronchial cartilage. At the end of the pseudoglandular period, all branches of conducting airways have developed and are embedded in mesenchymal stroma. Distal airway branches are lined by cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells that contain abundant cytoplasmic glycogen. During the canalicular stage of growth (120-180 days of gestation), vascular \"canalization\" of the interstitium occurs, with capillaries growing in apposition to the airway epithelium to form the developing air-blood interface. Also during the canalicular stage, there is development of type II pneumocytes and type I pneumocytes within the newly formed terminal airspaces. Fetal lung development to the saccular stage (180-240 days gestation in the bovine fetus) is important for survival outside of the uterus. Lung volume and gas exchange surface increase markedly, and there is further reduction in mesenchyme between airspaces. The terminal branches of the conducting airways extend through the nascent parenchyma, and conditions are set for alveolar development. Small accumulations of elastic fibers, the site of secondary alveolar septal development, are deposited during this stage. During the alveolar stage of lung growth (240-260 days), true alveoli form by ingrowth of septa from intersaccular crests at the sites of elastic fiber deposition. These secondary septa have a doubled capillary layer separated by mesenchymal tissue (eFig. 5-15). The acquisition of a mature air-blood interface, with a single capillary layer, occurs after birth in the final stage of lung development, the stage of microvascular maturation. The end result is a reduction of the interstitium and maturation of the interalveolar wall. Further subdivision of alveolar septa results in continued increases in alveoli and alveolar surface area during a period of rapid postnatal growth. Airways increase in diameter and length through coordinated growth as overall lung volume and weight increase.\n\nMovement of fetal lung fluid is important in directing normal lung development. Fetal respiration and spontaneous contraction of fetal conducting airways facilitate the movement of the fluid. Contraction of fetal airways occurs even in lung explants without central neurologic control because of the phasic contraction of the airway smooth muscle. Neural innervation of the developing lung occurs early in development, arising from neural tissue migrating through the fetal mesenchyme. Studies in the fetal pig show that both developing nerves and ganglia are present within the fetal bronchial tree as early as the pseudoglandular stage of development. eFigure 5-15 Pulmonary immaturity in a full-term neonatal puppy. Alveolar septa are thick and covered by cuboidal pneumocytes. Alveolar septa each contain 2 capillaries, located adjacent to the epithelium. (Courtesy Laura Bourque.)\n\nFurther reading Kimura \n\nLung lobe torsion most often affects the right middle lobe of large deep-chested breeds of dogs as well as cats, presumably because of the narrow waist at the hilus, whereas the left cranial lobe is more commonly affected in small-breed dogs.\n\nUnderlying causes are not apparent in most cases, but a minority have neoplasia, pneumonia, or atelectasis of the affected lobe, congenital dysplasia or hypoplasia of the bronchial cartilage, previous thoracic surgery, or pneumothorax. The clinical signs are variable and include respiratory distress, coughing, and hemoptysis. The affected lobe is twisted at the hilus and deeply congested (Fig. 5-15 ). Pleural effusion is consistently present and may be transudative, chylous, exudative, or bloody. Histologic lesions vary from simple congestion in acute or partial torsions, to diffuse alveolar damage with fibrinous alveolar exudates, to pulmonary infarction with coagulative necrosis of all tissue elements.\n\ncysts are single unilocular cystic masses that do not communicate with the airways. They may be located anywhere in the thorax but are most frequent near the hilus of the lung or in the mediastinum. Their walls contain cartilage plates, and the cystic cavity is lined by bronchial epithelium. Accessory lung (extralobar sequestration, choristoma) is a mass of pulmonary tissue completely separated from the lung (with a separate pleural covering) and found in the pleural space, mediastinum, or abdominal cavity. The term sequestration refers to the lack of connection to the normal airways. Bronchi are absent or rarely connect to the upper alimentary system (bronchopulmonary foregut malformations), and the mass is supplied by systemic but not pulmonary arteries. Various sequelae of bronchial obstruction probably underlie the following malformations, and indeed, several of these can occur together. Bronchial atresia or complete obstruction results in accumulation of secreted mucus in the isolated lung tissue distal to the defect. This excessive lung fluid induces hyperplasia of bronchial tissue (adenomatoid malformation) or alveolar tissue (polyalveolar lobe). Conversely, partial obstruction of a bronchus, such as from maldevelopment of the cartilage or compression by external masses, leads to air trapping within the distal areas of lung after birth (congenital lobar emphysema, described later in Pulmonary emphysema). Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (adenomatoid hamartoma) is characterized by one or more intrapulmonary masses that are swollen, spongy or cystic, fluid-or air-filled, and lobulated (eFig. 5-17). The masses are formed by cysts varying from microscopic to several centimeters in diameter, which are lined by pseudostratified columnar or cuboidal epithelium. In the microcystic form, these give the lung an adenoma-like appearance. Microcystic spaces are separated by loose connective tissue, whereas the larger cysts may have walls of fibromuscular tissue. Bronchi, if present, are hypoplastic and lack cartilage and smooth muscle in their walls.\n\nPulmonary hamartoma (intralobar bronchopulmonary sequestration) is a tumor-like mass of pulmonary tissue within the lung, enveloped by the normal pleura but cut off or sequestered from the normal airways. It may be supplied by anomalous branches of the aorta and drained by pulmonary veins, but lacks communication with the bronchi or with the pulmonary arteries. Histologically, the development of bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, and blood vessels is variable; those formed by excessive amounts of alveolar tissue relative to bronchioles and vessels are termed polyalveolar lobe. These are thought to result from bronchial atresia, with pulmonary hyperplasia in response to trapped secretions. The differential diagnosis includes pleuropulmonary or pulmonary blastoma.\n\nIn anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, the pulmonary veins drain into the right rather than the left atrium. Completely (total) or partially anomalous forms differ in whether all of the pulmonary veins are abnormal or not. Agerholm Enlargement and coalescence of airspaces are apparent histologically, and are most reliably assessed on lungs that have been infused with fixative to a volume approximating the in vivo state. In true emphysema, fragments of alveolar wall may be apparent histologically, in contrast to the more frequent lesion of alveolar overinflation. However, emphysema and overinflation are often difficult to distinguish. Emphysema may affect the terminal bronchioles and adjacent alveoli (centrilobular or centriacinar emphysema), or more uniformly involve the entire lobule (panlobular or panacinar).\n\nCurrent knowledge of the pathogenesis of emphysema is based on investigations of the human disease and of animal models. Emphysema is an important condition in humans, where it frequently coexists with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease attributable to cigarette smoking and is the result of an imbalance between proteases and antiproteases. Neutrophil-derived serine proteases, particularly elastase, and matrix metalloproteinases from a variety of sources are the likely culprits, and their concentrations are enhanced by the neutrophil and macrophage activation induced by chronic bronchitis. Although antiproteases-\u03b1 1 -antitrypsin, secretory leukoprotease inhibitor, and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinasesprotect normal lung from proteolytic damage, their function may be reduced by genetic deficiency or by oxidative stress from cigarette smoke and the resulting inflammation. Unchecked proteases degrade elastin and other matrix proteins in the interstitium, and the weakened alveolar septa are vulnerable to stress-induced failure with the tensions generated by each ventilatory cycle.\n\nThe emphysematous lung is dysfunctional because the loss of alveolar septa reduces the alveolar surface area; although the affected portion of lung may be larger than normal, gas exchange is reduced. Loss of elastic recoil caused by degradation of elastin further compromises lung function. These factors make hyperpnea necessary to maintain lung function, which may exacerbate the disease by placing additional ventilatory stresses on the damaged lung.\n\nOverinflation of alveoli is commonly encountered, although this does not qualify as alveolar emphysema unless it leads to destruction of alveolar septa. Overinflation is mostly the result of airway obstruction or spasm, with air trapping in alveoli and failure of the lung to deflate normally. Distended airspaces can be found at in the apices of the lungs of dogs, cats, and horses with underlying causes of respiratory distress, or along the margin of a consolidated lung (secondary to bronchiolar obstruction by exudate). Lobar overinflation may result from bronchial mucus plugs or lung lobe torsion. Overinflated lobules are a common finding in horses with bronchiolar mucus plugging associated with recurrent airway obstruction (\"heaves\").\n\nCongenital lobar overinflation (congenital lobar emphysema) is rare in dogs, and results from collapse or obstruction of a lobar bronchus, such as by hypoplasia of the cartilage, leading to air trapping in the affected lobe. The right middle or cranial lung lobes are greatly enlarged by alveolar overinflation and/or bullous emphysema, sometimes with bronchiectasis. Pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous edema, or pneumothorax may occur. Affected dogs typically have slowly progressive dyspnea and coughing, and surgical excision is usually curative.\n\nInterstitial emphysema is distinguished from alveolar emphysema by the presence of air in the connective tissues and lymphatics of the lung, including the interlobular septa, Neath PJ, et al. Lung lobe torsion in dogs: 22 cases (1981 \n\nAtelectasis refers to incomplete expansion of the lung. Atelectatic lung is homogeneously dark red and sunken relative to aerated lung, and the texture is fleshy or firmer and nonspongy. Microscopically, simple atelectasis appears as slightly congested alveolar walls lying in close apposition with slit-like residual lumina having sharp angular ends (eFig. 5-18). Atelectasis is a common artifact in immersion-fixed lung tissue. In congenital atelectasis, the lungs appear as in the fetus, but dark red-blue because of dilation of alveolar capillaries, of fleshy consistency and do not float . Obstructive atelectasis is caused by complete airway obstruction. Whether atelectasis follows obstruction depends on the size of airway obstructed and the degree of collateral ventilation. A lobular pattern of atelectasis suggests bronchial obstruction as the cause, prompting a search for the offending exudates or tumors. Compressive atelectasis is caused by pleural or intrapulmonary space-occupying lesions. Examples are hydrothorax, hemothorax, exudative pleuritis, and tumors. In large animals, the atelectasis caused by pleural effusions often occurs below a sharply demarcated fluid line. Abdominal distension, as in severe ascites and ruminal tympany, may cause partial atelectasis, typically in the cranial regions where ventilatory movements are most easily compromised by intra-abdominal pressure. Large animals with prolonged recumbency, such as anesthesia, may develop atelectasis of the down side. Generalized and severe atelectasis is mostly seen as a sequel to pneumothorax.\n\nWhat appears to be total atelectasis is seen in animals that die while breathing 80-100% oxygen during anesthesia or intensive care. Because of the speed with which the oxygen is resorbed into tissues and the lack of nonabsorbable gas (especially nitrogen, as is present within atmospheric air), the lungs are usually completely devoid of gas by the time they are examined after death. Grossly, the lungs are markedly reduced in size, so the heart is especially prominent when the pluck is examined.\n\nEmphysema in its widest sense refers to tissue expansion by air or other gas. In the lung, there are 2 major forms: 1. Alveolar (vesicular) emphysema, which is rare in animals, refers to abnormal and permanent enlargement of alveoli resulting from destruction of alveolar septa, and an absence of obvious fibrosis. Emphysema thus differs from overinflation of alveoli caused by air trapping, which is a reversible lesion that is commonly encountered. 2. Interstitial emphysema is the presence of air within interlobular, subpleural, and other major interstitial zones of the lung. \"Emphysema,\" unless otherwise qualified, should only be used for alveolar emphysema. Emphysematous areas of lung are grossly voluminous, pale, and puffy. The enlarged airspaces are often visible as small vesicles, and in severe cases, coalescence of airspaces can produce large air-filled bullae. Emphysematous bullae occasionally rupture to cause fatal pneumothorax.\n\nFurther reading Guglielmini C, et \n\nThe lung is a vascular organ comprised of hundreds of billions of capillaries organized into hundreds of millions of alveoli whose surface area is estimated, in humans, to be 50-100 m 2 . The entire output of the right ventricle is delivered to the lung with each contraction, delivering mixed venous blood from the peripheral tissues through the alveoli for reoxygenation. Given the anatomy and physiology of the lung, it is not surprising that circulatory disturbances are important in many lung diseases. The color of the lungs at the time of postmortem examination is highly variable, but may or may not reflect any underlying disease. The lungs of animals that die from exsanguination will often be nearly white. Active hyperemia, as part of the acute inflammatory response, is a feature of acute pulmonary injury. Pulmonary congestion may be caused by left heart failure or inflammation. However, pulmonary congestion is a common incidental finding at autopsy, and therefore the color of the lung is often deceptive. Changes in lung texture are a more reliable indicator of underlying disease.\n\nPulmonary edema is a frequent complication of many diseases and is therefore one of the most commonly encountered pulmonary abnormalities. If severe, pulmonary edema has a catastrophic effect on lung function by reducing pulmonary compliance, beneath the pleura, and around vessels and airways. Positivepressure ventilation with excessively high tidal volume is an occasional cause in all species. Interstitial emphysema without alveolar emphysema occurs frequently in cattle, presumably because of their well-developed interlobular septa and lack of collateral ventilation of the alveoli . It is an incidental finding in cattle at slaughter, and is common in recumbent (\"downer\") cows with periparturient paresis or toxic mastitis, where it may develop as cows forcibly exhale or grunt against a closed glottis. Thus the finding of interstitial emphysema in cattle does not necessarily imply primary lung disease. Dramatic interstitial emphysema occurs in cattle with respiratory distress caused by 3-methylindole toxicity, other toxins, or pneumonia caused by bovine respiratory syncytial virus. Interstitial emphysema in such cases may result from abnormally high intra-alveolar pressures caused by increased expiratory effort or bronchiolar obstruction, or perhaps from altered permeability or strength of the barrier between airspaces and interstitium. In animals surviving a sufficient length of time with severe interstitial emphysema, the air can extend along lymphatics to the bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes or along fascial planes of the mediastinum to beneath the skin of the back.\n\nBlebs and bullae are common causes of spontaneous pneumothorax in dogs. They occur mainly in large-breed or deepchested dogs. The respiratory distress may be acute or worsen over a period of weeks, and be continuous or intermittent. Surgical removal of the affected lobe is usually curative. These lesions appear as air-filled \"bubbles\" at the apices of the lung, usually in cranial or middle lobes, with more than one lobe affected in about half of cases ( Fig. 5-17 ). Ruptured blebs and bullae are notoriously inconspicuous at autopsy, but holding the lungs under water and distending the lung by infusing air into the trachea or bronchus usually identifies the pleural leak. This should be done routinely in cases of anesthesia-associated death.\n\nHistopathology distinguishes the 2 lesions: air-filled spaces within the pleural connective tissue are termed blebs (see eFig. 5-20), whereas those arising in the lung parenchyma (by distention of alveoli or rupture of alveolar septa) and bulging into the pleura are bullae (eFig. 5-21). Patchy subpleural areas of alveolar distention are often present within lobectomy samples, and \n\neFigure 5-20 Subpleural air-filled bleb in a cow that died of acute mastitis. This form of edema develops in pneumonia of various causes, diffuse alveolar damage (see Interstitial and bronchointerstitial lung disease, later), sepsis or endotoxemia, anaphylaxis or drug-induced histamine release, and mechanical ventilation causing barotrauma or rapid re-expansion of collapsed alveoli. In the case of diffuse alveolar damage, edema may result from more minor injury than is needed to cause formation of hyaline membranes. Fumonisin toxicity in swine, African horsesickness virus and Hendra virus infection in horses, and bluetongue are specific causes of spectacular pulmonary edema.\n\nSeveral additional causes of pulmonary edema are uncommonly encountered. Hypoproteinemia from glomerular, intestinal, or liver disease, or severe endoparasitism, may cause pulmonary edema, but edema in other tissues is usually more prominent. Obstruction of lymphatic vessels or lymph nodes by neoplastic cells is a rare cause of pulmonary edema. Increased intracranial pressure from trauma to the central nervous system causes \"neurogenic pulmonary edema,\" probably related to catecholamine-induced pulmonary hypertension and increased vascular permeability. Hypoxia resulting blocking ventilation of the alveoli, obstructing gas exchange across the alveolar septa, and reducing the surface area of the air-liquid interface in the alveoli. In addition, proteins present in the edema fluid interfere with surfactant function, further reducing compliance and contributing to pulmonary dysfunction. Edema of the lung is, in many respects, similar to edema of other tissues, and is governed by the permeability of the vascular wall and by Starling forces-the balance of hydrostatic and osmotic pressures between the intravascular and interstitial compartments. Distinctive aspects of edema in the lung include the importance of type I pneumocytes as barriers to fluid movement, the role of type II pneumocytes and club cells in active transport of water from the alveolus, the effect of surface tension on fluid movement, and fluid exchanges between the alveolar and bronchiolar airspaces and the pulmonary interstitium. It is useful to consider separately the means by which the alveoli are kept dry, and the ways in which excessive fluid is removed from the alveoli.\n\nAlveoli are kept \"dry\" by several related mechanisms. Tight junctions between type I pneumocytes are relatively impermeable to fluid and proteins and confer >90% of the barrier to albumin flux across the blood-air barrier. In contrast, in the lung, capillary endothelium is relatively permeable to movement of fluid and small molecules into the interstitium. Complementing the barrier function of the type I pneumocyte are Na + -K + -ATPase channels (sodium pumps) on the basolateral surface and passive sodium channels on the apical surface of type II pneumocytes. The net effect is to actively transport sodium out of the distal airspaces into the interstitium, drawing water along the same pathways by osmosis, thus resulting in a slow but steady flow of liquid from the alveoli to the interstitium. Drainage of interstitial fluid from the interstitium to the lymphatics is facilitated by negative pressure in the lymphatic vessels. In addition, the surface tension in airways may draw fluid out of alveoli into distal bronchioles, where fluid resorption by club cells is driven by a variety of ion channels. The rate at which fluid is cleared from the distal airspaces varies by species, being slowest in dogs, intermediate in sheep, and fastest in rodents and rabbits.\n\nActive transport of alveolar fluid is enhanced by catecholamines (through \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptors) and glucocorticoids; this is probably important in clearance of fluid from the lungs of neonates, and is also used to advantage in the therapy of pulmonary edema. Conversely, active transport mechanisms are impaired by hypoxia, for example, as a result of high altitude, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (as a result of inflammation), halogenated anesthetics, oleic acid, and perhaps lidocaine, suggesting that these factors, in addition to damage to type II pneumocytes or club cells, are additional contributors to development of pulmonary edema.\n\nCauses of pulmonary edema include elevated hydrostatic pressure, increased permeability of the alveolar wall, impaired lymphatic drainage, and several miscellaneous causes (Box 5-2). Elevated hydrostatic pressure (increased pulmonary venous pressure) is commonly caused by left-sided heart failure (cardiogenic edema, see Pulmonary hypertension, later), or less often from hypervolemia caused by excessive fluid administration. In these situations, fluid loss into the alveoli may occur from either the alveolar septa or the peribronchiolar or perivascular connective tissue.\n\nIncreased permeability of the blood-alveolar barrier (noncardiogenic edema) is the second major mechanism of pulmonary edema, and is typified by a rapid onset of high-protein edema. \n\nPulmonary thromboembolism may result from in situ thrombus formation within pulmonary veins or arteries, or embolism to the pulmonary arteries of a thrombus, bacteria, parasites, hair, or foreign material. Clinically, pulmonary thromboembolism often goes undetected, particularly in horses. Reported clinical signs are not specific and include dyspnea, tachypnea, coughing, lethargy, hemoptysis, cyanosis, or sudden death. Because the clinical features may be vague, the branches of the pulmonary arteries must be opened at autopsy in all animals with clinical evidence of respiratory disease.\n\nIn situ development of pulmonary thrombi involves Virchow's triad of underlying mechanisms: increased blood coagulability, damage to endothelial cells or the vessel wall, or stasis of blood flow. The major causes are listed in Box 5-3. Hypercoagulability is of prime importance in most cases. Thrombi that develop in situ within the lung are usually microscopic (eFig. 5-23), whereas grossly visible thrombi are usually emboli from a distant site ; exceptions to this rule do occur. Microvascular thrombi dissolve rapidly after death if the fibrinolytic system has been activated, as is expected in disseminated intravascular coagulation; thus the absence of thrombi does not rule out this condition.\n\nThe lungs are strategically situated to catch emboli carried in venous blood; the most common sources are listed in Box 5-3.\n\nThe significance and sequelae of pulmonary thromboembolism depends on the extent of vascular obstruction, the rapidity of its development, and the presence of sepsis. Because the lung is supplied by both pulmonary and bronchial arteries and has extensive collateral vessels, thromboembolism does not often cause infarction. Ischemia and infarction are more likely if thrombosis or embolism occurs at the periphery of the lung (rather than affecting the large central vessels), or if the from high altitude induces pulmonary edema, an effect of both impaired alveolar active sodium transport and pulmonary hypertension. Postanesthetic pulmonary edema seems to involve multiple mechanisms. Acute upper-airway obstruction from asphyxiation can cause pulmonary edema, likely resulting from the drop in intra-alveolar pressure that leads to a net increase in transmural pressure across the alveolar wall, increasing fluid movement into the interstitium.\n\nOn gross examination, edematous lungs are wet, heavy, and do not completely collapse when the thorax is opened; fluid oozes from the cut surface. The ratio of lung weight to body weight (or to heart weight in ruminants) is a useful measure of pulmonary edema. Edema is prominent in the pleura and the pulmonary interstitium, and may form shallow pools in the hilus of the lung or the mediastinum. In cattle and swine, the interlobular septa are obviously distended by clear fluid . Foam often fills the trachea and bronchi and flows from the nostrils, although this is a common and nonspecific finding in horses and sheep (see eFig. 5-14). The thoracic cavity may contain excess fluid. It is important to understand that the above features occur in severe cases, but pulmonary edema may be functionally significant yet grossly unremarkable.\n\nHistologically, edema is first detected within the perivascular and peribronchial/bronchiolar interstitium, interlobular septa, and pleura, where it is cleared by the lymphatic system. At this stage, the fluid has little impact on lung function. If fluid accumulation exceeds clearance by the lymphatics, then it will accumulate within alveoli, where it can reduce surfactant function, decrease surface tension, and facilitate alveolar collapse; at this stage, decrements in lung function can be expected. Microscopically, edema fluid is often colorless and manifests simply as expansion and separation of constituents of the interstitial extracellular matrix, especially surrounding blood vessels and the bronchovascular bundle. With increased protein content, edema appears acidophilic, especially within alveoli, where it is homogeneous or finely granular except for occasional discrete holes that represent trapped air bubbles.\n\nChronic edema is accompanied by a diffuse increase in the number of alveolar macrophages, and in left -sided heart failure, these may contain phagocytosed erythrocytes or hemosiderin, the so-called \"heart failure\" cells (see Pulmonary hypertension, later). Histopathology is neither sensitive nor specific for detection of pulmonary edema. Low-protein edema must be abundant before it is detected histologically, the protein in edema fluid can leach from sections during processing and be quite inconspicuous, and conversely, pink material often fills the alveoli in autolysed carcasses or those euthanized with barbiturates. Therefore radiographs, measurement of lung weight, and the gross appearance are usually more accurate indicators of the presence and severity of edema. Kaartinen MJ, et al. Post-anesthetic \n\nPulmonary hemorrhage varies from petechiae to extensive filling of large regions by blood. It is usually possible to distinguish hemorrhage from congestion based on gross appearance. Hemorrhages are usually multifocal or patchy splashes of blood, whereas congestion is diffuse within the affected region of the lung. Pulmonary hemorrhages occur frequently in hemorrhagic diatheses, including thrombocytopenia and anticoagulant rodenticide toxicity, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and with severe congestion. They can also be caused by vasculitis, pulmonary hypertension, infarction, ruptured aneurysms, trauma, migrating foreign bodies (eFig. 5-25), hemangiosarcoma, tumors that have undergone necrosis, bronchopneumonia, leptospirosis, or drug reactions. Aspiration of blood is frequent at slaughter, and has a characteristic pattern of multiple, small, bright red foci with feathery borders (eFig. 5-26). In lung biopsies, distention of alveoli with blood suggests pre-existing hemorrhage, whereas the hemorrhage of surgical trauma is more likely accompanied by alveolar collapse.\n\nAbscesses that erode large blood vessels cause massive hemorrhage. Affected animals may develop hemoptysis or be found dead with blood flowing from the nares, and expectorated blood is often detected in the stomach. Liver abscesses in cattle may extend into hepatic veins, spreading to the lungs via the caudal vena cava to cause pulmonary thromboembolism, acute interstitial lung disease, or chronic lung abscesses. Such abscesses occasionally erode pulmonary vessels, leading to epistaxis and sudden death from exsanguination.\n\nEquine exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH). Equine exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage is a common occurrence in strenuously exercising horses. Approximately 75% of racehorses have endoscopically detectable blood in their airways following a single post-race examination, and this increases to 95% following a second examination. The severity of hemorrhage in EIPH-affected horses varies from mild to severe, and may lead to epistaxis. Severe bleeding negatively impacts race performance and length of racing career, but beyond that, there are few reported clinical signs in horses that experience EIPH.\n\nBecause EIPH does not typically lead to the death of the animal, and affected horses can be retired and used for other purposes, for many years, there had been few studies of the pathology. Recent studies have expanded our understanding of the pathology and pathogenesis of EIPH. Most EIPH lesions occur in the caudodorsal lung . The most widely reported gross lesion associated with EIPH is dark brown to blue-black discoloration of the caudodorsal pleura. Pleural and interlobular septal fibrosis may be present, as well as patchy interstitial fibrosis and brown foci in the parenchyma, reflecting hemosiderophage accumulation. In severe cases, discrete mass-like and curvilinear foci are noted in the caudodorsal lung (see and histologically consist of edema and fibrosis. These lesions may be found months after racing, indicating that the changes persist for considerable periods of time.\n\nbronchial or systemic circulation is also impaired, such as by concurrent heart failure. When infarcts occur, they form sharply demarcated, wedge-shaped, or polygonal raised, firm, red-blue hemorrhagic lesions at the periphery of the lung lobes (eFig. 5-24); fibrin may give the pleural surface a dull granular appearance. Pulmonary hemorrhage and pleural effusion are frequent gross findings, even when infarcts are absent. Sublethal ischemia causes histologic lesions of diffuse alveolar damage, whereas infarcts manifest as foci of coagulative necrosis, sometimes delineated by macrophages, fibroplasia, and inflammation of vessel walls. Emboli that obstruct large branches of the pulmonary artery may cause sudden death, or over time lead to cor pulmonale and right heart failure; right ventricular dilation may or may not be present. Large thrombi are detected by dissection of the terminal branches of the pulmonary arteries; these lesions are easily missed if only cross-sections of lung are examined.\n\nSeptic embolism with massive numbers of bacteria, as occurs when an abscess ruptures into a vein, induces acute pulmonary edema or interstitial lung disease. Septic emboli that are less fulminant result in multifocal infarcts, abscesses, or suppurative embolic pneumonia. Fat embolism is rarely important in animals. The fat can originate from bone marrow at sites of fracture, from severe hepatic lipidosis when the hepatocytes rupture, or from subcutaneous fat necrosis caused by pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, or vitamin E deficiency. The emboli lodge in alveolar capillaries and produce sausageshaped distensions that are empty in routine paraffin sections, but special stains of frozen sections reveal the presence of fat. Small numbers of megakaryocytes are frequently found in pulmonary capillaries, particularly in dogs, and are usually of no diagnostic significance. Emboli of brain or spinal cord occur in cattle when improper use of captive bolt guns induce marked increases in intracranial pressure. \n\neFigure 5-24 Hemorrhagic infarcts at the apices of the lung in a puppy dead of parvoviral enteritis. Sepsis and hypotension were the likely contributing factors. Hemorrhages caused by disseminated intravascular coagulopathy could appear grossly similar. eFigure 5-27 Exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage in a racehorse, with red-purple discoloration of the dorsal region of the caudal lobes.\n\nnamely, hemosiderin accumulation and interstitial fibrosis, do not occur without venous remodeling being present, suggesting that venous remodeling is central to the pathogenesis of EIPH.\n\nThe proposed pathogenesis of EIPH can be summarized as follows. Strenuous exercise in horses leads to extremely high vascular pressures and flow preferentially in the caudodorsal lung, leading to the characteristic remodeling of small veins of this region of lung; the venous remodeling reduces wall compliance, resulting in supraphysiologic upstream capillary pressures, during exercise, that cause capillary rupture and bleeding. Equine exercise-associated fatal pulmonary hemorrhage. Massive diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage and edema are among the most common causes of sudden death in racing horses. Because these animals die during or shortly after strenuous exercise, often in the warmer months, there is often considerable autolysis by the time they are examined by the pathologist. Blood may be noted at the nares and often pours forth from the nose when the carcass is shifted. The gross pathology of exercise-associated fatal pulmonary hemorrhage (EAFPH) consists of widespread hemorrhage and edema in both lungs (eFig. 5-28). Raised hemorrhagic foci, suggestive of acute infarcts, are occasionally found along the margins of the lung lobes. The degree of hemorrhage is usually more prominent within the caudodorsal regions but also extends into more cranial regions.\n\nHistologically, hemorrhage is present throughout the alveoli, interlobular septa, and subpleural tissue, and also surrounds airways and vasculature. In addition to the hemorrhage, vasculature is markedly congested throughout the lung. Because of hemorrhage and autolysis, it is difficult to evaluate the integrity of the blood vessels and alveolar septa. Horses affected by EAFPH may or may not have obvious histologic lesions of antecedent EIPH.\n\nThe pathogenesis of EAFPH is not well understood. Acute cardiac failure has been suggested, but this seems unlikely, as clinically apparent or fatal pulmonary edema would be expected before vascular pressures increased sufficiently to cause such widespread vascular rupture and hemorrhage. Because hemorrhage is the dominant feature of EAFPH, some refer to it as \"fatal EIPH.\" Based on the limited descriptions and personal experiences, it is not clear that EIPH is consistently present in horses that die suddenly from EAFPH. Further, the lung involvement in horses dying from EAFPH is much greater than for EIPH, which is mostly a disease of the caudodorsal lung. It is speculated that if, during exercise, horses developed sudden widespread spasm of small postcapillary venules within the lungs, this could lead to a rapid rise in capillary pressures that might be sufficient to cause widespread acute rupture and hemorrhage, as is seen in EAFPH. In rodents, there are smooth muscle sphincters in postcapillary veins that are capable of constricting and regulating local vascular perfusion and pressures through adrenergic receptors. If such structures are present in the equine lung, this might provide a mechanism for the sudden global edema and hemorrhage that occurs in EAFPH. This hypothesis remains to be tested.\n\nDerksen FJ, et al. Regional distribution of collagen and haemosiderin in the lungs of horses with exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage. Equine Vet J 2009;41:586-591.\n\nHistologically, EIPH is characterized by the following constellation of lesions: pleural and interlobular septal fibrosis, pulmonary vein fibrosis, hemosiderophage accumulation, and interstitial fibrosis. The venous fibrosis especially affects the adventitia of small (100-200 \u00b5m) veins; in some veins, fibrosis also involves the intima and can narrow the vein lumen. In severe EIPH, discrete foci of interstitial edema and fibrosis may accompany the aforementioned lesions.\n\nThe pathogenesis of EIPH has been debated for years, leading to diverse hypotheses, from bleeding occurring as a result of preexisting airway inflammation to shock waves being transmitted into the lung from the forefeet striking the ground. The bleeding in EIPH has been postulated to arise from rupture of the alveolar capillary bed as a result of the high vascular pressures achieved within the lung during strenuous exercise. However, the distribution and features of the gross and histologic pathology of EIPH are not explained by simple pressure-induced capillary rupture. The most recent data suggests that the cause of EIPH is regional venous remodeling. This remodeling likely occurs as a result of the high vascular pressures and flow experienced by veins in the caudodorsal lung. It is known that blood flow is preferentially distributed to the caudodorsal lung of horses at rest and increases further to this lung region during exercise, which could explain the regional distribution of the venous lesions in the EIPH lung. Further, data have shown that the other lesions in the EIPH lung, mainly reflect chronic remodeling of pulmonary arterioles. These include thickening of the tunica intima by endothelial cell proliferation and later by fibrosis, hypertrophy of smooth muscle in the tunica media, and more variable fibrosis or edema of the adventitia . Small arterioles at the level of the terminal airway that normally have a thin tunica muscularis may become muscularized. A range of morphologic variants in cases of PAH in humans are recognized: intimal proliferation that may be concentric (in familial PAH), eccentric (as a result of thromboembolism and other causes), or obliterative; thrombosis and recanalization of the lumen; and plexiform lesions. The latter are web-like plexuses of vascular lumens, each surrounded by concentric rings of endothelial cells and matrix, which appear as a branching or outpouching of a larger artery, and are thought to represent chronic attempts to repair damage to the parent vessel wall (Fig. 5-21) . Severe acute PAH results in endothelial degeneration, vasoconstriction, fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall, vasculitis, and \"onion skin\" fibrosis and proliferation of smooth muscle cells .\n\nPulmonary venous hypertension is commonly caused by left-sided heart failure, and may lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Left heart failure causes pulmonary edema as a result of elevated pressure in the lung vascular bed, and varies with the rapidity of onset of venous and capillary hypertension. In animals with long-standing left-sided failure (e.g., mitral valve insufficiency in small-breed dogs), the edema may \n\nThe clinical diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is based on documenting pulmonary arterial pressure >30 mm Hg. In veterinary medicine, this is usually measured using echocardiography rather than direct catheterization of the right heart. Pulmonary hypertension is often classified by the underlying cause (Box 5-4). The pathogenesis of PAH historically had been considered to involve excessive vasoconstriction and thrombosis leading to vascular remodeling. PAH is now understood to be a vasculopathy, characterized by dysregulation of vascular tone, abnormal vascular cell growth, and apoptosis, along with inflammation. The vascular remodeling characteristic of PAH is a cause rather than a result of the disease. The dysregulation of vessel tone in PAH is caused by an imbalance in vasodilatory (e.g., prostacyclin, nitric oxide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate) and vasocontricting (e.g., endothelin, thromboxane A 2 , serotonin) molecules, whereas a number of growth factors and cytokines, such as TGF-\u03b2, bone morphogenetic protein 2, platelet-derived growth factor, and fibroblast growth factors are implicated in the vascular lesions of PAH. Gross lesions in cases of primary idiopathic PAH are often not present within the lungs. In secondary PAH, the gross lesions reflect the precipitating disease, such as interstitial lung disease, canine heartworm disease, or pulmonary thromboembolism. Severe PAH leads to right ventricular and sometimes atrial dilation, and hypertrophy develops with time. Lesions of right heart failure may be present. Irrespective of the cause, PAH has a spectrum of characteristic histologic lesions that results from progressive remodeling of pulmonary veins. We have reviewed the lungs from a series of adult dogs with similar lesions. Clinically, affected dogs experience rapidly progressive respiratory signs that include coughing, tachypnea, dyspnea, and hypoxia; epistaxis and hemoptysis may be reported. The gross pathology of canine PVOD is striking. The lungs are diffusely firm and have widespread, relatively welldemarcated, foci of hemorrhage or congestion (eFig. 5-31).\n\nHistologically, the lesions are patchy rather than diffuse, with extensive remodeling of small-to medium-sized pulmonary veins located in the alveolar interstitium ( Fig. 5-23 ). The lumen of the most severely affected veins is obscured by plump spindle cells and collagen. Within the alveolar parenchyma, alveolar capillaries have segmental lesions of marked congestion and often extensive hypercellularity caused by endothelial proliferation. This lesion is similar to \"capillary hemangiomatosis\" reported in humans with PVOD. The cause of the remarkable venous remodeling in dogs is not known.\n\nbe relatively modest compared to that occurring in an animal experiencing acute heart failure. This difference reflects the ability of the lymphatic system to clear the fluid. Thoracic effusion is also common in acute heart failure, again reflecting the inability of pleural lymphatics to clear the sudden increase in pressure-driven pleural fluid formation.\n\nHistologically, chronic left-sided heart failure results in pulmonary edema, increased numbers of lung macrophages, and remodeling of pulmonary veins. The edema initially forms around airways and blood vessels (see Pulmonary edema, previously), reflecting the location of the lymphatics that expand to clear the edema fluid. As fluid production increases and exceeds lymphatic clearance, fluid is more apparent within the alveolar interstitium and the alveoli. Alveolar macrophages are increased in number and usually have abundant cytoplasm with ruffled cell borders, a feature that is characteristic of chronic alveolar edema. Hemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages, the so-called \"heart failure cells,\" are inconsistently present in chronic left heart failure and absent in acute heart failure . Histochemical stains for iron are helpful for subtle lesions. This lesion affects alveolar macrophages more or less uniformly throughout the section; single or focally intense accumulations of hemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages, or pigment-laden macrophages in the bronchiolar interstitium, are not indicative of heart failure. Conversely, the presence of hemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages is not pathognomonic of heart failure, as pulmonary hemorrhage causes the same lesion. Careful evaluation of pulmonary veins, especially small-to medium-sized vessels, often reveals increased amounts of collagen within the adventitia. In acute heart failure, there is greater and more widespread edema, without \"heart failure cells\" or the aforementioned increases in adventitial collagen around pulmonary veins.\n\nPulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare and serious cause of pulmonary hypertension in humans that eFigure 5-31 Canine pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. The lungs are diffusely congested with multiple discrete foci of congestion and hemorrhage. vascular injury, and drug-induced pulmonary vasculitis are well recognized in humans and probably occur in dogs. Brown PJ, et \n\nMineralization of the pulmonary interstitium is a feature of uremic pneumonopathy in dogs with acute or chronic renal failure, and similar lesions may result from hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D toxicosis, alkalosis, or hyperadrenocorticism. Dogs with uremic pneumonopathy may have tachypnea and dyspnea. The magnitude of respiratory signs and lesions is not related to the severity of renal dysfunction nor to the clinical outcome. There are often no gross lesions, or the lung may be gritty and porous. Mineralization occurs within the smooth muscle and connective tissue fibers in alveolar septa, pulmonary veins, and the walls of bronchioles . Alveoli are edematous and contain increased numbers of macrophages, and giant cells occasionally engulf the mineralized material. Hemorrhage, thin strands of fibrin, and edema may be prominent in acute exacerbations (see . Alveolar septa and pulmonary veins, such as the gastric mucosa, may be predisposed to mineralization because of the alkaline microenvironment resulting from carbon dioxide excretion. Mineral deposits in the lung undergo ossification with time. Papillary adenomas are solitary circumscribed tumors of the bronchi or lung parenchyma, characterized by papillary growth of well-differentiated epithelial cells; these occur in dogs but are rare. Peribronchiolar metaplasia (Lambertosis) is a non-neoplastic condition thought to result from bronchiolar injury, which involves hyperplasia but not dysplasia of the terminal bronchiolar epithelium, and extension of club cells, goblet cells, or squamous cells into adjacent alveoli (eFig. 5-34). The bronchiolar origin of the alveolar cells can be confirmed by detection of specific cytokeratins. Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma in situ (see Table  5 -1) do not cause clinical disease in humans; its occurrence in dogs has not been defined. Minimally invasive, lepidicpredominant, and papillary predominant adenocarcinomas (see Table 5 are the most frequent lung tumors in dogs, forming pale moderately firm masses, usually arising in subpleural or peripheral areas of lung. Some neoplasms have accumulations of eosinophilic secretion within the lumen of the tumor, or mucus secretion is occasionally prominent. Minimally invasive and lepidic tumors in dogs are associated with prolonged survival, whereas papillary predominant tumors behave similarly but occasionally invade adjacent tissues or metastasize. In contrast, acinarpredominant or solid-predominant adenocarcinoma, although less frequent in dogs, carry a higher risk of invasive growth and metastasis. Micropapillary adenocarcinoma seems to occur as an aggressive neoplasm in dogs and cats but has not been formally described.\n\nGrading of adenocarcinoma in dogs (McNiel et al., 1997) has been based on overall differentiation, degree of nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic rate, nucleolar size, tumor necrosis, fibrosis, and demarcation of the mass. Grades were assigned from the sums of the above scores. Of these criteria, degree of differentiation, mitotic rate (with cutpoints of >1 and >3 mitoses per high-power field), necrosis of >50% of the tumor, and nucleolar size were most predictive of outcome. Unpublished data indicate more aggressive neoplasms include his tologic pattern (solid or acinar pattern), disordered or \n\nPrimary pulmonary neoplasms are encountered most often in dogs and cats, and are rare in other domestic animals. A variety of mechanisms explains the clinical effects of lung tumors. Respiratory failure is rare but may ensue if tumors occupy a large proportion of lung parenchyma. More commonly, effects on specific anatomic structures explain the clinical signs: coughing caused by compression of a bronchus, pleural effusion and dyspnea caused by invasion of pleural lymphatics and regional lymph nodes, hemoptysis from erosion of blood vessels, or rarely regurgitation caused by esophageal obstruction. Other sequelae include cytokine production, leading to malaise, anorexia, and cachexia; the distant effects of metastasis; and paraneoplastic syndromes, including hypertrophic osteopathy, hypercalcemia, fever, or adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion. Epithelial tumors are the most frequently encountered type. For primary epithelial lung tumors, hilar or central neoplasms are more likely of bronchial origin, whereas peripheral tumors, which are far more common, are more likely to have arisen from distal bronchiolar or alveolar epithelium. Because the lung is a frequent site for metastatic neoplasms, it is essential to differentiate metastases of a distant tumor from primary lung neoplasms. Features supporting the diagnosis of a primary lung neoplasm include the absence of a primary tumor in a distant organ, the presence of a single large lung mass with or without smaller metastases (eFig. 5-33), detection of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), or mucus production or ciliated cells (neither of which are commonly present even in primary tumors). Because pulmonary carcinomas often form intrapulmonary metastases, the presence of tumor emboli within vessels is not helpful in distinguishing primary from metastatic tumors. Expression of TTF-1 is detected in most (64-95%, depending on the study) primary pulmonary adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas, but is usually absent in pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma, mucinous pulmonary adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma, or nonpulmonary nonthyroid metastatic tumors. Thus peripheral neoplasms of bronchioloalveolar origin are generally TTF-1 positive, whereas central neoplasms arising from large airways are negative. Pulmonary adenocarcinomas are consistently labeled for pancytokeratins (AE1/AE3), and vimentin is co-expressed in the less-differentiated tumors.\n\nThe classification of pulmonary carcinomas in humans has undergone 2 major revisions since the last consensus on classification of these tumors in domestic animals (Box 5-5), and the revised system has a much-improved relationship to clinical behavior. Lung tumors of animals follow similar patterns, so this scheme seems highly relevant, but the existing literature on tumors of animals cannot be directly translated into this current system. Caution is necessary because this scheme has not yet been formally studied in animals, and the prognostic relevance for dogs and cats is unknown. Important changes include abandoning the term bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, highlighting the concept of lepidic growth, and a different definition of invasive growth than what has been used in veterinary pathology ( \n\n\u2022 Adenocarcinoma: see \n\nGeneral points 1. The term \"bronchoalveolar carcinoma\" has been abandoned. 2. The lepidic pattern of growth is an important feature of several neoplasms described later, and is characterized by pre-existing alveoli whose septa are covered by a single layer of neoplastic epithelial cells that do not invade the connective tissue (see eFigs. 5-30, 5-35). Simple finger-like ingrowths may occur, but secondary or tertiary branching indicates a papillary rather than lepidic pattern. Identifying elastic fibers in the walls of alveoli (lepidic pattern) may be useful, as these are absent in papillae. The name lepidic refers to the resemblance to a row of butterflies perched on a branch. In addition to lepidic, other patterns of growth are papillary (see Fig.  5 -25B; see also eFig. 5-36), acinar, micropapillary, and solid. 3. Invasion does not refer to extension of neoplastic cells into lung tissue adjacent to the neoplasm, but instead indicates invasion of neoplastic cells into the tumor stroma (see Fig. 5 -35C, eFig. 5-37), blood or lymphatic vessels, or pleura. Invasion of stroma is recognized by areas of fibroblastic or myofibroblastic stroma (desmoplastic reaction) containing neoplastic cells. In addition, any papillary, acinar, micropapillary, or solid growth pattern is considered invasive growth. 4. Invasive adenocarcinomas often have more than one morphologic pattern in a single mass, and the classification is based on the predominant pattern across the entire tumor. It is recommended to state the percentage of the mass comprising each of the various patterns, in 5% increments.\n\nAtypical adenomatous hyperplasia Small (\u22640.5 cm) solitary lesions in which alveoli are lined by scattered cuboidal bronchioloalveolar epithelial cells with gaps between the peg-like cells (lepidic noninvasive).\n\nIn contrast to carcinoma in situ, crowding or stratification of cells is not present, and there is gradual transition with normal adjacent alveoli. In contrast to alveolar injury, stromal thickening is present only in areas of epithelial proliferation.\n\nAdenocarcinoma in situ Small lesion (\u22643 cm) with neoplastic cells continuously lining the surface of pre-existing alveoli; anisokaryosis or nuclear atypia are absent. There is no necrosis, papillary or acinar growth, neoplastic cells growing in alveolar lumens, or invasion into the tumor stroma, blood or lymphatic vessels or pleura (any of these features indicate invasive adenocarcinoma). These tumors do not cause clinical disease in humans.\n\nMinimally invasive adenocarcinoma Small (\u22643 cm) solitary lesion, similar to adenocarcinoma in situ, but with small foci (\u22640.5-cm diameter in humans) of invasion into the tumor stroma or pleura.\n\nLepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma Similar to adenocarcinoma in situ, with lepidic growth along pre-existing alveoli (see Fig.  5 -25A, eFig. 5-35), but has evidence of invasive growth forming an area >0.5-cm diameter.\n\nPapillary predominant adenocarcinoma Growth of neoplastic cells on stalks containing fibrovascular connective tissue, that project into spaces within the tumor. Note that the aforementioned patterns involve growth of neoplastic cells along pre-existing alveoli, whereas the alveolar architecture is lost in papillary adenocarcinoma, and the cells grow upon stroma of newly formed papillae (see Fig. 5 -25B, eFig. 5-36).\n\nAcinar-predominant adenocarcinoma Neoplastic cells arranged around clearly visible glandular spaces.\n\nSolid adenocarcinoma Sheets of neoplastic cells lacking papillary or acinar growth.\n\nNeoplastic cells form tiny finger-like protrusions into spaces within the mass but, unlike true papillae, these protrusions lack fibrovascular cores. The micropapillae often have clear cystic centers surrounded by rings of neoplastic cells. This pattern has a highly aggressive growth habit in humans.\n\nOther patterns Mucinous variants of each subtype (cells contain abundant mucin in the cytoplasm, correlating with molecular changes and neoplastic behavior in humans), as well as colloid adenocarcinoma (abundant mucin distends the air spaces within the tumor). multilayered arrangement of neoplastic cells lining papillae, invasion of neoplastic cells into intratumoral stroma, poor demarcation of tumors, and filling of alveolar lumens adjacent to the tumor by clusters of neoplastic cells. Tumor grading is not widely used for human pulmonary adenocarcinomas, but mitotic rate and abnormal mitotic figures in addition to tumor subtype provides prognostic information.\n\nStaging of adenocarcinoma, in addition to tumor type, is predictive of outcome in dogs. The presence of more than one tumor (stage T2 in animals), significant invasion of adjacent tissues (T3), or the presence of lymph node (N1) or distant (M1) metastases correlate with progressively shorter survival times. In humans, key elements of staging include the size of the mass, invasion along a bronchus (rare in animals), careful examination of pleural puckers to detect invasion through the elastic layer of the pleura or through the pleural surface, invasion across an interlobar fissure into a different lobe, formation of physically separate additional tumor nodules (only those recognized grossly, not incidental microscopic nodules) of the same histologic subtype in the same or different lobes, and lepidic, papillary, acinar, and adenosquamous patterns (see Box 5-5 and Table 5 -1). Tumors \u22651 cm diameter are more likely to metastasize, but the histologic pattern has not been shown to correlate with clinical outcome; in fact, frequent metastasis is reported for large lepidic tumors. Affected cats develop progressive dyspnea and coughing from the expansile tumor, or there may be intrapulmonary metastasis, or pleural invasion with effusion arising from the intrapleural metastases (eFig. 5-39). However, affected cats often exhibit no evidence of respiratory disease, and the clinical signs result from metastasis to other viscera, brain, muscle, eye, bone, or skin. A peculiar feature of this tumor is the propensity to cause lameness by metastasizing to the digits, especially to the dermis on the dorsum of a distal phalanx and beneath the footpad epidermis (eFig. 5-40). Occasionally, the epithelial hyperplasia associated with feline idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is mistaken for an adenocarcinoma. Unlike true epithelial neoplasms, which have features consistent with their clonal origin, feline IPF is a heterogeneous lesion with evidence of smooth muscle proliferation, fibrosis, and honeycomb lung formation. Conversely, cats with feline IPF can have coincident primary lung carcinomas, so it is important for the pathologist to inspect the pulmonary parenchyma far from the lung neoplasm to identify changes typical of feline IPF.\n\nCarcinoma in situ and lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma are characteristic of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (jaagsiekte), the retroviral lung tumor discussed in the section Infectious respiratory diseases of sheep and goats (see Figs. 5-25A, 5-62; see also eFig. 5-35).\n\nNon-adenocarcinomatous epithelial neoplasms are less frequent in animals. Bronchial gland carcinoma is a rare lowgrade malignancy that shows clear evidence of arising from the wall of a bronchus. The neoplastic cells form acini composed of well-differentiated epithelial cells with prominent mucus production. Squamous cell carcinoma is common in the lung and is histologically similar to that in other tissues, with a usual mix of small basaloid cells and larger differentiated cells that are polygonal, with abundant glassy eosinophilic cytoplasm. Adenosquamous carcinoma forms both acinar/tubular and squamous patterns of differentiation (each forming \u226510% of the tumor), with prominent atypia of neoplastic cells, higher grade, and a particularly aggressive growth habit . Squamous and adenosquamous patterns reflect the pattern of differentiation, and do not imply an origin from squamous epithelium. Large cell carcinoma is a rare and anaplastic variant of pulmonary carcinoma, in which the individual neoplastic cells are large, polyhedral, sometimes separated from one another, and have abundant oftenvacuolated cytoplasm, pleomorphic nuclei with anisokaryosis and multinucleation, but lack keratinization, intercellular bridges, acini, or mucin. Histiocytic sarcoma and large cell neuroendocrine tumor are important differential diagnoses in cases of large cell carcinoma. Carcinosarcoma is a primary pulmonary tumor with both adenocarcinomatous and sarcomatous components, rarely seen in animals, which is thought to represent epithelial-mesenchymal transition of carcinomatous cells.\n\nNeuroendocrine tumors in humans are classified as lowgrade carcinoid, intermediate-grade atypical carcinoid, high-grade small cell carcinoma, and high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. All are rare in domestic animals and mainly affect the young. Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor is the preferred term because the validity of subclassifying these Inset: ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (jaagsiekte) showing detail of the lepidic growth pattern along pre-existing alveolar septa. B. Papillary-predominant pulmonary adenocarcinoma in a cat. A stalk of fibrovascular tissue lined by neoplastic epithelial cells protrudes into a space within the tumor. Lack of the stromal core at the tips of the papillae could be confused with a micropapillary pattern. C. Invasive growth of pulmonary adenocarcinoma into fibroblastic stroma within the tumor, in a dog. Invasion is defined by growth of neoplastic cells into tumor stroma, blood vessels, or pleura. The invasive focus shown is bordered above and below by a papillary pattern of tumor growth (not visible).\n\nA B C micrometastases of neoplastic cells in lymph nodes (cell clusters, but not isolated neoplastic cells).\n\nPulmonary adenocarcinoma is a relatively common neoplasm of older cats. The tumors may be single, multiple, or lobar (eFigs. 5-37, 5-38), and follow the above-mentioned mesenchymal components, although there is much variation in the relative amount of each component between tumors and within different areas of the same neoplasm. The cuboidal epithelial cells are arranged in nests or branching tubules. The mesenchymal component appears embryonal, with loose matrix separating spindle-shaped, stellate, or angular cells with vesicular or hyperchromatic nuclei. Pleuropulmonary blastoma is of similar morphology and is located in pleura, lung, or mediastinum, but the epithelial component is well differentiated rather than atypical. The differential diagnoses include pulmonary hamartoma and mesothelioma.\n\nGranular cell tumor is the most common primary lung tumor in horses, and is thought to originate from Schwann cells in the peribronchial tissue. It is often discovered as an incidental finding in older horses, but can cause coughing or, rarely, dyspnea. Metastasis is not described. Grossly, the mass is white to beige, usually multinodular, and unilateral. Granular cell tumors are associated with large bronchi, and often bulge into the bronchial lumen to cause variable degrees of obstruction. Histologically, the neoplasm is composed of sheets or lobular aggregates of large, round, or angular cells with abundant cytoplasm containing innumerable tiny acidophilic granules ( Fig. 5-27 ). There is minimal variation in cell size, and few mitotic figures are found. The granules usually stain with Luxol fast blue and more variably with periodic acid-Schiff. Immunohistochemical markers for pulmonary granular cell tumors in horses are widely expressed in a variety of other cell types, and so are not pathognomonic for this neoplasm; S100 and vimentin are consistently present, with inconsistent expression of NSE and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).\n\nHistiocytic sarcoma is a malignant neoplasm of myeloid interstitial dendritic cell phenotype (see Vol. 3, Hematopoietic system). Histiocytic sarcoma arises in the lung and spreads to thoracic lymph nodes, or histiocytic sarcoma of splenic origin may secondarily involve lung and other organs. The infiltrate may replace an entire lung lobe, or form multifocal infiltrates throughout the lung. The morphology varies from individualized round cells with scant to abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, to spindle-shaped or dendritic cells with indistinct borders (Fig. 5-28 ). The nuclei are round or cleaved with marked anisokaryosis. Most cases have significant numbers of tumors in animals is unknown. Carcinoids in humans are thought to arise from bronchial neuroendocrine tissue and exhibit the characteristic features of neuroendocrine tumors: arrangement in nests, palisades, or pseudorosettes; expression of chromogranin and serotonin (synaptophysin is weak; neuron-specific enolase [NSE] ) is considered nonspecific); and the presence of dense-core granules visible by electron microscopy. The few cases of pulmonary neoplasms in dogs that resemble carcinoids have developed adjacent to a bronchus and have a neuroendocrine pattern of nests or ribbons of cells separated by delicate vascularized stroma. The cells are uniform, round to polygonal, with abundant pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and relatively small nuclei. Features in humans indicative of an intermediate grade (i.e., atypical rather than typical carcinoid) are mitotic rate >2 per 10 high-power fields and punctate coagulative necrosis of the tumor. Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma has >1 mitosis per high-power field with comedo-like necrosis. In the few cases of neuroendocrine tumors reported in dogs, increasing tumor grade correlates with progression from well-demarcated nodules to infiltrative or metastatic neoplasms. The diagnosis is based firmly in morphology, and immunohistochemical findings alone do not justify the diagnosis. Small cell carcinoma is a rare and poorly characterized neuroendocrine tumor described in dogs and cows. It has a hilar location and consists of loosely arranged packets of small cells (~10 \u00b5m diameter) separated by a thin stroma. The neoplastic cells have scant cytoplasm, and may be round (resembling lymphocytes), fusiform (\"oat cells\") or polygonal. The immunohistochemical staining patterns in domestic animals are not characterized.\n\nPulmonary blastoma, rarely described in animals, is a multinodular lesion that implants in the pleural cavity, metastasizes to lymph nodes, and invades extrapulmonary structures. Blastoma consists, by definition, of malignant epithelial and infiltrate within the affected lobes. Histologically, angiocentric lymphoma is an angioinvasive, angiodestructive, pleocellular infiltrate . A requirement for the diagnosis is a mixed infiltrate of small lymphocytes (mainly T cells) as well as large atypical cells, along with a variable infiltrate of plasma cells and eosinophils. The atypical cells are round with distinct borders, large but variably sized, occasionally binucleate, and often have a high mitotic rate. Characterization of the condition in dogs is limited but suggests that the atypical cells include both T and B cells. Destructive invasion of the pleomorphic cells into the walls of blood vessels is the characteristic feature of the disease, and infarction of adjacent tissue may be present. The infiltrates frequently involve the bronchial lymph nodes and occasionally the liver and other viscera, but it is the progressive involvement of the lung that causes death in most cases. The differential diagnosis includes eosinophilic granulomatosis, anaplastic carcinoma, and pulmonary round cell tumors, such as histiocytic sarcoma, lymphoma, and mast cell tumor.\n\nMetastatic tumors commonly arise within the lung because of the organ's rich capillary and lymphatic network. Criteria for differentiating metastases of nonpulmonary neoplasms from intrapulmonary spread of a primary lung neoplasm are described previously. An important part of the diagnosis of a primary lung tumor is thorough examination of the body to exclude possible nonpulmonary sites of primary neoplasia. multinucleated cells, lymphocytes, and plasma cells intermingled with the neoplastic cells. Definitive diagnosis requires immunohistochemistry on frozen sections to demonstrate expression of CD1, CD11c, major histocompatibility complex class II, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM)-1. However, in formalin-fixed specimens, demonstration of a typical morphology along with expression of CD18 but absence of CD3, CD20, and CD79a provides tentative confirmation of the diagnosis. Dogs with splenic hemophagic histiocytic sarcoma (of macrophage phenotype) may have neoplastic cells within pulmonary blood vessels.\n\nFeline pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare condition of old cats, causing multifocal coalescing masses or diffuse infiltrates within the lung, and may affect pancreas, kidney, liver, and local or distant lymph nodes. The infiltrate targets the bronchioles and extends to adjacent alveoli. The histiocytic cells are pleomorphic, with a moderate amount of homogeneous or finely vacuolated eosinophilic cytoplasm, anisokaryosis, poikilokaryosis, and nuclear hyperchromasia. These cells express CD18 and E-cadherin and have ultrastructurally visible Birbeck granules, consistent with a Langerhans cell phenotype. In addition to this disease, cats with progressive histiocytosis and dogs with cutaneous Langerhans cell histiocytosis or systemic histiocytosis, described elsewhere, may have involvement of the lungs.\n\nAngiocentric lymphoma (also known as lymphomatoid granulomatosis) is a rare and poorly understood disease of dogs, and very rarely of cats. In humans, lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a B-cell proliferation associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Although the disease is discussed here as a pulmonary neoplasm, there is considerable debate as to whether the analogous condition in humans represents a neoplasm or a non-neoplastic lymphoproliferative disorder. No data are available in veterinary medicine addressing the clonality of the lymphoid cells, so the biology of this disease remains enigmatic. Most cases affect young dogs (4-9 years of age), with cases as young as 9 weeks of age recorded. The masses are multiple and usually found within the caudal lung lobes. They are poorly demarcated and pale, or can occur as a diffuse \n\nLesions that specifically target the airways include those that primarily cause epithelial necrosis and those that induce airway inflammation; often, a combination of necrosis and inflammation is present. Diseases may affect the bronchi, bronchioles, or both, and the diagnosis of bronchointerstitial pneumonia, described later, is appropriate when both airway and alveolar epithelial cells are damaged. The major consequences of these diseases are coughing, airway obstruction, and impairment of lung defenses. The flow of air can be obstructed by bronchoconstriction resulting from contraction of airway smooth muscle, by leukocytes or mucus within the lumen of the airway, and by thickening of the airway wall by edema and leukocytes. The consequence is failure of alveolar ventilation that may cause hypoxemia and hypercapnia. As a result of alveolar hypoxia inducing reflex vasoconstriction, there is reduced perfusion of hypoventilated areas of lung that, if widespread, may lead to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary compliance is reduced because of the increased pressure needed to ventilate the alveoli. Clinically important airway obstruction is particularly notable with bronchiolar disease, where it manifests as expiratory dyspnea because the airway obstruction is exacerbated from the slight collapse that occurs during exhalation.\n\nBronchitis is relatively common in domestic animals but receives inadequate attention by pathologists because it is not usually fatal. Bronchitis and/or bronchial necrosis may be caused by viral or bacterial infection, parasitism, allergic disease, or exposure to irritants or toxins.\n\nMorphologic manifestations of acute bronchitis include the same range of inflammation described for upper airways. The Metastatic carcinomas may form acini, solid sheets, lepidic growth along pre-existing alveolar septa, and/or clusters within blood vessels. Some of the most common metastatic neoplasms include lymphoma in all species; uterine adenocarcinoma in cows and sows; malignant melanoma in horses; and osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, oral melanoma, mast cell tumor, transitional cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinomas of mammary, biliary, pancreatic, intestinal, anal sac, or thyroid origin in dogs and cats (eFigs. 5-41, 5-42). \n\nDamage to lung tissue varies according to the nature of the causative agents, their distribution (particularly the route by which they reach the lung), and their persistence. Pulmonary diseases can be classified in several ways:\n\n\u2022 Morphologic pattern, according to initial site of involvement and the pattern of spread of the lesion: bronchopneumonia, interstitial lung disease, airway disease, bronchointerstitial lung disease, and embolic pneumonia ( Fig. 5 -30) \u2022 Histologic character: fibrinous, suppurative, granulomatous, necrotizing, proliferative, fibrosing \u2022 Etiology: viral, bacterial, parasitic, toxic, allergic \u2022 Duration: acute, subacute, chronic \u2022 Functional abnormality: obstructive versus restrictive \u2022 Epidemiologic patterns: shipping-fever pneumonia, enzootic pneumonia The approach described here emphasizes morphologic patterns of pneumonia, for 2 reasons. First, gross and histologic examination is usually sufficient to classify a condition by this scheme, even if the etiology cannot be identified. Second, knowledge of the pattern of pneumonia provides important clues as to the probable etiology, route of exposure to the causative agent, pathogenesis of the lesions, effect on pulmonary function, and the sequelae and complications. Emphasizing the similarities between specific diseases, by grouping them based on morphologic patterns, often enhances our ability to recognize the sometimes subtle differences among these conditions. airway. Bronchitis causes coughing that may be paroxysmal, and airway obstruction manifests in wheezing. However, it is not expected to be fatal unless the lesion induces widespread bronchoconstriction, obstructs a large airway, or leads to secondary bronchopneumonia as a result of aspiration of infected material or impaired mucociliary clearance. Chronic bronchitis in dogs. Chronic bronchitis is a common condition in older, small-and medium-sized dogs, and manifests as chronic productive or nonproductive cough, exercise intolerance, expiratory or inspiratory wheezes, reduced expiratory airflow, and hypoxemia. The etiology is rarely identified. Proposed causes include dry air; airborne pollutants, including sulfur dioxide and particulates; environmental tobacco smoke; chronic gingivitis with aspiration of debris; immune-mediated inflammation; and viral infection. Opportunistic bacterial pathogens are occasionally isolated, but their significance as a primary cause is questionable; similarly, viral and bacterial infections are well recognized to induce acute exacerbations in human patients with chronic bronchitis in which infection is not the primary cause. Many dogs with chronic bronchitis also have chronic left heart failure, suggesting that cardiogenic pulmonary edema may result in chronic coughing that generates airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion.\n\nThe major gross finding in chronic bronchitis is excessive mucus or mucopurulent exudate in the trachea and bronchi. The bronchial mucosa in severe cases is hyperemic, thickened, edematous, and granular rather than glistening, and lymphoid nodules or hyperplastic polyps may project into the lumen. Microscopically, the bronchial mucosa is edematous and contains many lymphocytes, plasma cells, and occasional macrophages and neutrophils. Eosinophils may or may not be present. There is hyperplasia and hypertrophy of bronchial glands, hyperplasia of goblet cells, and variable hyperplasia, ulceration, or squamous metaplasia of the surface epithelium. Intraluminal mucus is commonly mixed with abundant neutrophils. Many cases of uncomplicated bronchitis persist for years, but sequelae in severe cases include bronchiectasis; bronchopneumonia; or alveolar atelectasis, leading to pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and medial hypertrophy of pulmonary arteries. Collapsing trachea and chronic bronchitis are frequent companions. Chronic inflammation is thought to progress to malacia of the tracheobronchial cartilage in some cases and contribute to development of tracheal collapse. Emphysema is not an important sequel to chronic bronchitis in dogs.\n\nEosinophilic bronchopneumopathy is an uncommon, usually steroid-responsive condition of young dogs. It causes chronic gagging, cough, dyspnea, nasal discharge, and variable blood eosinophilia and neutrophilia. The nodular or diffuse lung lesions are not completely described, but include chronic eosinophilic bronchitis with epithelial hyperplasia, ulceration, or squamous metaplasia, which destroys the airway walls and leads to bronchiectasis in ~25% of cases. In addition to bronchial lesions, most cases have extensive involvement of lung parenchyma with diffuse eosinophilic and granulomatous infiltrates, focal eosinophilic granulomas centered on necrotic tissue and densely eosinophilic material (probably masses of eosinophil secretions), and large areas of necrosis and fibrosis . Eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy is perhaps the most common cause of bronchiectasis in dogs (eFig. 5-44). Cases with involvement of the lung parenchyma overlap with eosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis, which is discussed exudates may be catarrhal, mucopurulent, fibrinous, fibrinopurulent, or purulent. Ciliated epithelial cells are most sensitive to a wide array of injurious agents and are often the first to undergo necrosis and slough ( Fig. 5-31 ). Catarrhal bronchitis represents a relatively mild reaction in which the irritation induces both a mild neutrophil-dominated inflammatory response and secretion of mucus by goblet cells and bronchial glands. In purulent bronchitis, the exudate is yellow or white and viscid. Fibrinonecrotic bronchitis resulting from viral or occasionally mycotic infection is characterized by areas of epithelial necrosis with loosely adherent fibrinous exudate. In such cases, gentle removal of the exudate reveals a granular lesion of epithelial necrosis, which differentiates the lesion from the expectorated mucus that is often present in the large airways of animals with chronic bronchopneumonia. Animals with aspiration pneumonia often have extensive necrosis of the bronchial epithelium, with green-brown foul-smelling exudate.\n\nBronchial necrosis can resolve by epithelial regeneration if the offending stimulus is removed or neutralized. More severe or prolonged injury to epithelium results in fibrosis of the lamina propria, as well as accumulation of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells. Epithelial hyperplasia, mucous hyperplasia, and/or squamous metaplasia may also become prominent following mucosal injury of any cause (eFig. 5-43). Chronic infection with damage to the airway wall may result in bronchiectasis, discussed later. Fibrous polyps are a rare response to bronchial mucosal injury.\n\nCommon airway diseases in domestic animals include acute tracheobronchitis (\"kennel cough\") of dogs (discussed in the section Infectious respiratory diseases of dogs, later), chronic bronchitis and eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy of dogs, feline asthma, recurrent airway obstruction (\"heaves\") in horses, and Dictyocaulus spp. in cattle, sheep, goats, and horses. Bronchitis also results from inhalation of bacteria from the upper respiratory tract and, rarely, when the focal lesions of tuberculosis or caseous lymphadenitis erode into a large Acute and chronic bronchitis in cats. Feline asthma is relatively common, and is defined by the clinical findings of reversible airway obstruction with inflammation. Most cases have an acute onset or recurrent bouts of cough, dyspnea, or wheezing that respond to treatment with bronchodilators and corticosteroids, and are mainly the result of bronchial inflammation, airway smooth muscle hyper-reactivity, and bronchoconstriction. Thickening of the bronchial wall may be noted radiographically, and eosinophils are usually numerous in later. Eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy is thought to be immune mediated, but specific causes should be ruled out: the tracheobronchial parasites Crenosoma vulpis, Eucoleus aerophilus (Capillaria aerophila), and Oslerus osleri; the lungworms Angiostrongylus vasorum and Filaroides hirthi; occult Dirofilaria immitis infection (causing eosinophilic granulomas in lung); as well as pulmonary carcinoma, histiocytic sarcoma, lymphoma, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and drug reaction cause similar lesions in humans but have not been identified in dogs.\n\nAspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus rarely cause chronic destructive bronchitis in German Shepherd dogs, with erosion of epithelium, neutrophil infiltration, and formation of granulation tissue in the wall of small and large airways. The lesion can progress to form an aspergilloma or fungus ball, a cavitated mass in the lung composed mainly of fungal hyphae (eFig. 5-45). However, hyphae may be difficult to detect in the chronic bronchial lesions. Progression to invasive systemic aspergillosis is not described in dogs, and excision with antifungal therapy has been curative. \n\nFurther reading Clercx C, et al progressively dilated airways; (3) varicose bronchiectasisrarely identified in animals-forms focal constrictions along dilated airways. The smaller distal bronchi are usually affected by bronchiectasis, and a similar lesion may involve the bronchioles.\n\nDestruction of bronchial walls with luminal obstruction by exudate is the key to development of bronchiectasis, and leads to their permanent dilation. In these situations, neutrophil-or eosinophil-derived proteases and oxygen radicals are thought to damage the bronchial wall. This results not only in weakening of the bronchial wall, but also failure of mucociliary clearance that perpetuates the infection and pooling of exudates in the lumen. The exudates cause obstruction; as a result, the weakened airways can be pulled outward with each inspiration and thus dilate over time.\n\nGrossly, the dilated bronchi are filled with viscid yellowgreen creamy exudate ( Fig. 5-33 ), which may eventually form caseous or inspissated masses in the lumen. The intervening parenchyma may be atelectatic and fibrotic. The bronchi may be so dilated as to be visible from the pleural surface, but are best appreciated when sectioned transversely. They may be confused with abscesses, but form cylindrical tracts, have remnants of cartilage, and are eventually continuous with recognizable bronchi (eFig. 5-47). In severe cases, the dilated bronchi give a honeycombed or cystic appearance to the lobe (see . Microscopically, the lumen is filled with mucus, cellular debris, leukocytes, and occasionally blood. The epithelium often has some combination of attenuation, ulceration, mucous or squamous metaplasia, and hyperplasia. The bronchial wall is infiltrated with leukocytes and may be obscured by granulation tissue, and this destructive and fibrotic lesion may extend to the deeper tissues and destroy cartilage and bronchial glands. Normal bronchi are dynamic structures that actively regulate airflow and defend the lung through mucociliary clearance; those crippled by bronchiectasis are forever dilated and unable to clear their burden of harmful pus and pathogens. Hawkins EC, et al. Demographic, clinical, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Neutrophils or macrophages predominate in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in some cases that are otherwise typical of feline asthma (eFig. 5-46). Other cats have chronic rather than episodic coughing or wheezing; chronic bronchitis is a more accurate diagnosis in these cases if it cannot be demonstrated that the signs are readily reversible. Cats parenterally sensitized then challenged with Bermuda grass allergens develop allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), IgG, and IgA; airway hyper-reactivity; and the following histologic lesions in the bronchi: narrowing of the lumen, smooth muscle hypertrophy, infiltrates of eosinophils in the wall and lumen, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of goblet cells and bronchial glands, and hyperplasia and exfoliation of the surface epithelium. The histologic findings in natural cases are not as well characterized because mortality is uncommon. In addition to smooth muscle hyperplasia and eosinophil infiltration, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates with lymphoid follicles may develop in the adventitia of the bronchi, and bronchioles may contain similar lesions. Chronic bronchitis in cats may be a manifestation of ongoing low-grade allergic reactions, although these do not fulfill the criteria of acute onset of reversible airway obstruction, as is necessary for the diagnosis of asthma. The exudate in airways is dominated by neutrophils, but the histologic lesions have not been defined. The role of infectious agents, including Mycoplasma spp., as causes of chronic bronchitis in cats is controversial. Bronchial parasites are rare in cats. Bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis is defined as permanent dilation of bronchi as a result of chronic bronchial obstruction and infection. Such bronchi become unable to clear the inflammatory exudate and will no longer perform their normal functions. Although most cases are a complication of bronchopneumonia or bacterial bronchitis, bronchiectasis may occur with immune-mediated bronchitis, or rarely as a congenital malformation. Bronchiectasis is relatively common in cattle with chronic bronchopneumonia, because complete lobular septation and lack of collateral ventilation both impair resolution of bronchopneumonia and lead to more extensive atelectasis because of airway blockage. Bronchiectasis is common in dogs. The lesions commonly affect the right cranial or middle lung lobes, and are usually the result of eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy, bacterial infection or occasionally tumors, bronchial foreign bodies, or ciliary dyskinesia. The condition in cats usually affects the caudal or middle lobes, and is often a sequel to chronic bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, or pulmonary neoplasia. Endogenous lipid pneumonia and emphysema are concurrent findings in some cases. Bronchiectasis infrequently develops in pigs, sheep, and goats with severe parasitic bronchitis. There are 3 anatomic forms of bronchiectasis: (1) cylindrical bronchiectasis causes relatively uniform dilation of the bronchus; (2) saccular bronchiectasis is probably a more advanced stage, where there are circumscribed or fusiform cyst-like lesions at the end of \n\neFigure 5-46 Feline asthma. Bronchitis with lymphocytes, macrophages and plasma cells, bronchial epithelial hyperplasia, and lumenal accumulation of mucus and neutrophils, in a cat with chronic episodes of respiratory signs. hyperplasia and lymphocytic bronchitis are common sequelae to viral infections (eFig. 5-48). Airway obstruction occurs more readily in bronchioles than in bronchi because their lack of cartilage rings and small luminal size readily permits collapse and occlusion by exudate. According to Poiseuille's law of frictional resistance, resistance to airflow varies with the fourth power of the radius, so narrowing of the airway by half will increase airway resistance 16-fold. Thus, if it is of diffuse distribution, even minor airway obstruction by bronchoconstriction, intraluminal exudates or mucus, or edema of the wall has profound effects on the work of breathing and on alveolar ventilation. These functional changes manifest as forced expiratory effort, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia in the later stages. Complete airway obstruction causes atelectasis, whereas partial obstruction leads to air trapping and overdistension of alveoli (see Fig. 5 -17). Both of these situations lead either to shunting of non-oxygenated blood past the perfused but hypoventilated alveoli, or arteriolar constriction that reduces perfusion of these hypoventilated alveoli but causes pulmonary hypertension if the airway obstruction is widespread.\n\nBronchiolitis obliterans (also known as bronchiolitis fibrosa obliterans, obliterative bronchiolitis, or organizing bronchiolitis) is a sequel to chronic bronchiolar damage. The term is used here to describe the presence of fibrous polyps occluding the bronchiolar lumen ; bronchiolitis obliterans is occasionally used elsewhere to describe acute lesions in which intraluminal aggregates of neutrophils obstruct airflow. The lesion is distinct from constrictive bronchiolitis, a lesion not commonly identified in animals, in which fibrosis of the bronchiolar wall causes external compression that reduces the diameter of the lumen. Hyaline scars are described in lambs with chronic viral or mycoplasmal pneumonia, and appear as nodular masses of fibrillar eosinophilic matrix and fibroblasts within the wall of bronchioles that bluntly compress the lumen, but do not form the intrabronchiolar polyps seen in bronchiolitis obliterans (eFig. 5-49).\n\nBronchiolitis obliterans is wound healing gone awry. Any agent that severely damages the bronchiolar epithelium-viral Norris CR, Samii VF. Clinical, radiographic, and pathologic features of bronchiectasis in cats: 12 cases (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) Primary ciliary dyskinesia. Cilia are complex structures. The \"9 + 2\" or \"9 + 0\" arrangement of microtubular doublets forms the basic structure, inner and outer dynein arms are the motors that forces the cilium to bend, and nexin links and radial arms provide support. These structures contain hundreds of proteins, so it is not surprising that primary ciliary dyskinesia is a diverse collection of disorders involving mucuspropelling cilia in the nasal cavity and bronchi, sperm flagella, nodal cilia in the developing embryo, water-propelling cilia in the ependyma and epididymis, and cilia in the middle ear and retina. Primary ciliary dyskinesia, or immotile cilia syndrome, is an inherited condition reported infrequently in many dog breeds, which manifests as recurrent or persistent rhinitis and sinusitis, bronchiectasis, bacterial pneumonia, and/or male infertility caused by reduced spermatozoal motility with abnormal tails. About half of affected humans and dogs have Kartagener's syndrome, defined as the combination of sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus. The latter is a left-right reversal of the thoracic and/or abdominal viscera resulting from dysfunction of cilia in the embryologic node. Otitis media or hydrocephalus may occasionally be present.\n\nThe diagnosis of ciliary dyskinesia is based on abnormal ciliary motility in short-term cell cultures, in vivo imaging studies to measure movement of mucus, and/or detection of ultrastructural abnormalities in cilia. Because bacterial toxins or adhesion of Bordetella or perhaps Mycoplasma cause ciliary dysfunction, detection of dysfunction in cilia from more than one tissue is necessary. Ultrastructural studies are also useful in differentiating primary from acquired ciliary dyskinesia. Absence or reduced number of inner and/or outer dynein arms, of the radial spokes that extend from these arms, and/ or of the central microtubules are common ultrastructural lesions in primary ciliary dyskinesia, and other primary and secondary changes are described. The ultrastructural diagnosis depends heavily on the quality of the preparation, and some dogs with the syndrome do not have ultrastructural changes in cilia. \n\nBronchiolitis and/or bronchiolar necrosis are caused by viral infection, inhalation of toxic gases, toxins that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 in nonciliated club (Clara) cells, hypersensitivity reactions, or inflammatory reactions to inhaled irritants. Autoimmune disorders, drug reactions, and reactions to mineral dusts are further causes of bronchiolar injury in humans. In addition, bronchiolar lesions are frequently an extension of bronchitis, bronchiectasis, or bacterial bronchopneumonia. The designation of bronchointerstitial pneumonia is appropriate when necrosis targets both the bronchiolar and the alveolar epithelium, as occurs particularly in viral infections and toxic injury (see Fig. 5 -30). Bronchiolar epithelial Lungs tests induce delayed rather than immediate reactions and do not correlate with airway reactivity, antigen-specific IgE levels are similar to controls, and stimulated bronchoalveolar lavage cells in horses with RAO produce both interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-\u03b3 (in addition to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8) mRNA, suggesting that a pure type 2 immune response is not characteristic of this disease. Alternatively, dysregulation of the normal anti-inflammatory functions of club cells may promote airway inflammation in affected horses. Challenge with molds, mold extracts, or endotoxincontaining dusts has induced airway neutrophilia and obstruction in heaves-susceptible but not normal horses, implying that all of these factors contribute to the airway responses. The disease occurs in stabled horses in northern regions and as a summer pasture-associated form in warm wet climates. Affected horses have chronic cough, increased expiratory effort, wheezing, variable nasal discharge, and exercise intolerance. Increased pulmonary resistance and reduced dynamic compliance are typical functional changes, and the bronchioles are hyper-responsive to agonists. The signs wax and wane depending on exposure to dusts, and a seasonal effect is common, but many cases are slowly progressive over the course of months or years.\n\nThe lesions specifically target the small bronchioles, and alveolar changes are usually minor. Bronchioles contain mucus, neutrophils, and sloughed epithelial cells in their lumens; increased numbers of goblet cells in the epithelium; hyperplasia and/or sloughing of club cells; lymphocytes, plasma cells, and mast cells in the lamina propria and adventitia; hyperplasia of smooth muscle; and inconsistent peribronchiolar fibrosis (see Fig. 5-35 ). Of these, the presence of mucus and neutrophils in bronchiolar lumens and hyperplasia of goblet cells are most infection, neutrophil-mediated injury caused by bacterial pneumonia, toxic gases, toxins metabolized by club cells, lungworms, and rejection of transplanted lung-may lead to fibrin formation in the bronchiolar lumen (see . As in any wound, fibrinous exudates that are not rapidly removed heal by fibroblast infiltration, neovascularization, and migration and proliferation of epithelial cells across their surface. Organization of exudate into granulation tissue can take place in as little as 7-10 days after injury, and regeneration of epithelium over its surface can occur in a similar time period. The presence of fibrous polyps occluding the airways has disastrous and permanent effects on airflow and alveolar ventilation.\n\nBronchiolitis obliterans is commonly identified within lesions of chronic bronchopneumonia in cattle, as a consequence of viral or neutrophil-mediated epithelial damage. Calves with a prior history of viral pneumonia occasionally develop right heart failure with right ventricular dilation, subcutaneous edema, hepatomegaly, and ascites. These lungs may be grossly normal, but histologic examination reveals epithelium-covered fibrous polyps that occlude the lumen of most bronchioles (see Fig. 5 -31) as well as medial hypertrophy of pulmonary arterioles. The latter is a histologic indicator that widespread alveolar hypoventilation has incited pulmonary hypertension, in turn causing cor pulmonale with right heart failure.\n\nScattered subpleural foci of bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia are a common incidental finding in dogs (see Fig. 5 -34). The lesions can be difficult to distinguish from early bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, but the hyperplastic lesions are usually multifocal, line terminal bronchioles, do not enlarge to form masses, are usually associated with fibrosis and lymphocytic inflammation of the adjacent tissue, and have no features of cellular atypia. Fulton RW, et \n\nRecurrent airway obstruction (RAO, or \"heaves\") is a common condition of mature horses. The term chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not appropriate for the equine disease, as the condition is more similar to human asthma. RAO is usually induced or exacerbated by exposure to organic dusts (particularly dusty, poorquality hay) that may contain allergens, endotoxins, fungi, actinomycetes, and particulate irritants. RAO is a nonseptic, inflammatory airway disease of adult horses, characterized by airway hyper-responsiveness and episodes of reversible airway obstruction resulting from bronchospasm. Other factors contributing to the airway obstruction include accumulation of mucus and neutrophils in bronchiolar lumina and thickening of the bronchiolar wall ( Fig. 5-35 ).\n\nAlthough RAO is undoubtedly an inflammatory disease, it remains controversial whether allergy (IgE-and mast cellmediated type I hypersensitivity) is important to the pathogenesis. Evidence supporting a mast cell-dependent or allergic basis includes elevated levels of IgE and histamine in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and enhanced histamine release from pulmonary mast cells of horses with heaves. However, skin \n\nFurther reading Castleman to those in the upper respiratory tract of the same individual, but at 2-4 logs lower number. Aspiration pneumonia (described later) is an obvious situation where pulmonary challenge with massive numbers of bacteria overcomes the lung defenses. Similarly, in cattle, stress leads to increased numbers of Mannheimia haemolytica bacteria colonizing the nasal cavity, with increased numbers of bacteria in inhaled droplets challenging the lung defenses. The causes of impaired lung defenses include stress, viral and mycoplasmal infection, unadapted exposure to cold, toxic gases, and inherited conditions. Agents or conditions that impair mucociliary clearance include exposure to cold, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, a variety of toxic gases, and ciliary dyskinesia. Corticosteroids (stress) and bovine viral diarrhea virus dampen the ability of airway epithelial cells to produce antimicrobial peptides. Alveolar macrophage function is reduced by bovine herpesvirus 1, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, stress, aflatoxin, and T-2 mycotoxin. Conditions that reduce the number or function of circulating neutrophils may also predispose to opportunistic bacterial pneumonia, including parvoviral enteritis, acute bovine viral diarrhea virus infection, chemotherapy, stress, acidosis, uremia, and several mycotoxins. Bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD) is an autosomal recessive disease present in Holstein cattle. Neutrophils in affected animals have abnormal expression of the characteristic, whereas leukocyte infiltrates in the airway wall and smooth muscle hyperplasia are seen in horses without RAO. Lesions are more severe in the caudodorsal lung. Eosinophils are usually infrequent but numerous in some cases; their presence perhaps reflects a different stage of the disease. Mucus spills into the adjacent alveoli in severe cases. Overinflation of alveoli may result from trapping of air distal to the obstructed bronchioles, but true emphysema with destruction of alveolar septa is not expected. Inflammatory airway disease is a term used to describe an RAO-like condition in younger horses. It occurs in 2-to 4-year-old horses, causes no clinical signs at rest, but exercise induces excessive airway mucus production and coughing, leading to exercise intolerance and poor racing performance. Bronchoalveolar lavage cytology reveals mild neutrophilia in some cases, eosinophilia in others, and some with increased numbers of mast cells. The histologic features are not described. Prior viral infection and exposure to airborne environmental allergens, dusts, and/or endotoxins are proposed causes. \n\nThe hallmark of bronchopneumonia is an exudative lesion originating at the bronchiolar-alveolar junction, and an airborne route of entry of the causative agents. The lesions of bronchopneumonia most often affect the cranioventral regions of the lungs, with neutrophils and sometimes fibrin or macrophages filling the air spaces of the bronchioles and alveoli (eFig. 5-50, The terminal bronchioles are the major site of deposition of 0.5-3.0 \u00b5m diameter particles, yet they seem to be particularly vulnerable to bacterial infection. In particular, the terminal bronchioles receive limited protection from the mucociliary clearance that is more active in the larger airways, or from the alveolar macrophages that protect the more distal airspaces. This situation is worsened by the fact that clearance of large volumes of debris from the alveoli requires that this material transits the narrow lumen of the bronchiole, so inflammation of the bronchiole readily obstructs clearance of bacteria and exudates from the alveoli, especially in species that lack collateral alveolar ventilation.\n\nThe characteristic cranioventral distribution of bacterial bronchopneumonia in animals is probably explained by gravitational influences, which result in both increased deposition of inhaled particles and pooling of aspirated secretions in these regions. There is also evidence that intravenous administration of Mannheimia haemolytica also causes pneumonia in cranioventral regions, perhaps suggesting that defenses might be less effective in this area of the lung.\n\nCauses and predisposing factors. Bronchopneumonia is, in most cases, caused by opportunistic bacterial pathogens (Table  5 -2), and development of disease requires increased exposure of the lung to bacteria, impairment of the pulmonary defenses, or both. The bacteria found in the lungs are generally similar \n\nFurther reading Naylor JM, et \n\neFigure 5-50 Lesions of bronchopneumonia. Chronic bronchopneumonia with abscess formation in the cranioventral area of the lung of a calf.\n\nto infiltrate these air spaces about 30 minutes after experimental infection. In early bronchopneumonia, bronchioles and adjacent alveoli are filled with neutrophils and sometimes cell debris, mucus, fibrin, and macrophages, and the wall of the bronchiole is edematous and infiltrated by neutrophils. By the time the bronchopneumonia is clinically apparent, the exudate has usually filled bronchioles and alveoli throughout the lobule (see Fig. 5 -36B). The bronchiolar epithelium is usually normal; extensive bronchiolar necrosis suggests an underlying viral infection. However, bronchiolar necrosis can develop during experimental infection with M. haemolytica and probably with other bacteria, and is thought to represent neutrophil-mediated damage to the epithelium. Suppurative or lymphoplasmacytic inflammation may be visible in the bronchi but, despite the term \"bronchopneumonia,\" this is not always apparent and not a requirement of the diagnosis. Alveoli in mild or early lesions are atelectatic and edematous, but this is obscured by neutrophils in severe lesions. Resolution and sequelae. Resolution of bronchopneumonia is possible if the infectious agent is destroyed by the immune response or antimicrobial therapy. Neutrophils undergo apoptosis within a day or 2, and fibrin may be removed by plasmin and/or phagocytosed by macrophages. Macrophages and extracellular debris are mostly cleared through the airways with the aid of coughing and collateral ventilation. If there is minimal damage to the alveolar septa and blood vessels, catarrhal or mild purulent bronchopneumonia can begin to resolve within 7-10 days and return to normal within 3-4 weeks. In ruminants and swine, the lack of collateral ventilation impedes clearance of alveolar exudates, and these species have a greater propensity to develop chronic suppurative bronchopneumonia.\n\nDeath from fulminant lobar bronchopneumonia may occur with only 20-40% of the lung affected. In such cases, the cause of death is not respiratory failure but rather sepsis, with or without bacteremia, and these animals are profoundly depressed and have grossly apparent petechiae on serosal surfaces and muscles throughout the body. Bacteremia is frequent in animals with severe peracute bronchopneumonia. In mouse models, both the bacterial pathogen and the genetic background of the mouse dictate the frequency of bacteremia and subsequent mortality. The extent of lung involvement in animals with chronic bronchopneumonia-up to 80% of the lung in some calves with chronic Mycoplasma bovis pneumonia-highlights the tremendous reserve capacity of the lung that must be consumed before bronchopneumonia causes death by simple filling of alveoli with exudate, and \u03b2 2 integrin leukocyte adhesion molecule CD11a,b,c/CD18. Affected cattle have persistent marked neutrophilia and develop a variety of chronic bacterial infections, including severe chronic bronchopneumonia with bronchiectasis as a result of ineffective neutrophil function.\n\nMorphology. The typical gross appearance of bronchopneumonia is irregular, somewhat symmetrical consolidation in cranioventral regions (see Fig. 5 -36A), and most cranioventral lung lesions in domestic animals represent bronchopneumonia. There are, however, several exceptions to this rule. First, some viral infections, including bovine respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A virus in swine, typically induce a cranioventral pattern of bronchointerstitial pneumonia that can easily be mistaken for bronchopneumonia. Second, the lesions of bronchopneumonia in swine caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Actinobacillus suis usually affect the caudal lung lobes. Third, whereas the lesions of bronchopneumonia in dogs and cats may be cranioventral, it is not unusual to find a patchy distribution throughout the lung.\n\nConsolidation-an increase in texture or induration-is best detected on a cut section to avoid the pleura, with deep and purposeful palpation of individual lobules. The lesions are dark red-purple, maroon, or pink-gray depending on the age and nature of the process, but a color change without altered texture often represents congestion or hemorrhage rather than bronchopneumonia. The cut surface is usually edematous, and catarrhal or purulent material can be expressed from small airways in subacute cases. In contrast, there is no exudate in fulminant cases because leukocytes are enmeshed in a tangle of fibrin, and the affected lung is discolored, dry, or edematous, and cuts crisply. Lesions of bronchopneumonia have a lobular or lobar distribution. \u2022 Lobular bronchopneumonia involves some lobules in their entirety, whereas adjacent lobules are unaffected, most notably at the border of the lesions. It reflects the slow expansion of such lesions, and is most apparent in species with well-developed interlobular septa, such as cattle and swine. \u2022 Lobar pneumonia is characterized by consolidation of an entire pulmonary lobe. This is usually a fulminating bronchopneumonia, and typical causes are M. haemolytica in cattle, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in swine, and aspiration pneumonia. In many such cases, the pulmonary parenchymal lesions are accompanied by pleuritis, which may vary from a dull granular appearance to a spectacular coating of fibrin with large pockets of edema.\n\nHistologically, the nidus of inflammation in bronchopneumonia is in the bronchiolar-alveolar junction. Neutrophils begin \n\nAnaerobic bacteria some characteristic features . First, they are usually localized or unilateral rather than bilaterally symmetrical. Second, aspiration, especially of anaerobes, incites extensive necrosis, liquefaction, foul smell, and rapid green discoloration of the affected tissue. Third, in herbivores, plant material may be visible microscopically along with an associated inflammatory reaction. In contrast, grossly visible plant material is often absent, and when present is of little diagnostic significance. Ruminants frequently aspirate rumen content at the time of death, but this has no associated inflammatory reaction and is irrelevant to the cause of death. Finally, in cases of septic aspiration pneumonia, bacterial culture yields mixed flora of relatively low pathogenicity, whereas one or a few recognizable pathogens are isolated from cases of opportunistic bronchopneumonia. The above conditions introduce large numbers of bacteria into the lung, in contrast to the aspiration of mostly sterile material, such as milk, mineral oil, radiographic contrast material, (eFig. 5-53) or drugs. These sterile reactions are referred to as aspiration pneumonitis in human medicine.\n\nWidespread distribution of inhaled milk is occasionally observed in pail-fed or tube-fed calves. The course of the disease in these cases can be as short as 1 day. The gross appearance is not characteristic. The lungs remain inflated; they are hyperemic, and excessive fluid may be present in the small bronchi. Histologically, there is acute bronchiolitis with various degrees of acute alveolitis, and the air spaces are filled with deepstaining amphophilic material containing variably sized clear lipid droplets (Fig. 5-38 ).\n\nThe aspiration of vomitus in a simple-stomached animal may be rapidly fatal as a result of laryngeal spasm or acute pulmonary edema, before there is time for much inflammation to develop. Alternatively, acid-induced lung injury can lead to infiltration of neutrophils and diffuse alveolar damage. Disease resulting from aspiration of oil is discussed later (see Lipid pneumonia and alveolar filling disorders, later). emphasizes sepsis as the major mechanism of death in acute disease.\n\nReduced lung function does occur in bronchopneumonia. The obvious reason is the edema and neutrophils that fill alveoli and bronchioles, which impede ventilation of affected alveoli and block gas exchange in the alveolus. Further, filling of air spaces and disruption of the surfactant system reduces the compliance of the lung and increases the work of breathing. Finally, pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction is the natural response to hypoxia in hypoventilated alveoli. However, prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators cause vasodilation and thus maintain perfusion of the pneumonic tissue, resulting in shunting of non-oxygenated blood past the hypoventilated alveoli into the systemic circulation; this ventilation-perfusion mismatching worsens the hypoxemia.\n\nChronic suppurative bronchopneumonia develops if the infection remains active. In many such cases, the lesions are colonized by secondary pathogens, such as Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes in cattle, and the primary cause can no longer be identified. Chronic bronchopneumonia may manifest simply as filling of bronchioles and alveoli with neutrophils, caused by persistent bacterial infection and ongoing recruitment of neutrophils. In other cases, the chronic infection results in pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, abscess formation, or sequestration. Extensive fibrinous exudate or injury to alveolar septa may heal by fibroplasia, which causes thickening of alveolar septa or locally extensive areas of fibrosis. Organization of fibrinous pleural exudate produces pleural adhesions. Abscesses develop within areas of chronic bacterial infection (eFig. 5-51; see eFig. 5-50).\n\nA sequestrum is a mass of necrotic lung parenchyma, often separated from viable lung tissue by purulent exudate, and usually encased in a fibrous capsule. Sequestra commonly develop from the infarcted lung tissue in contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, and in pneumonia caused by M. haemolytica or M. bovis in cattle or Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in swine. The lesions vary in size from several centimeters to large masses that occupy much of one lung (eFig. 5-52), and are firm, gray or red, and may be friable or have a foul odor. Sequestra are permanent and nonfunctional, and act as a nidus of persistent bacterial infection. \"Pulmonary sequestration\" describes quite a different condition in human pathology, wherein a congenitally anomalous mass of pulmonary tissue is not connected to the bronchial tree (see Congenital anomalies, later).\n\nAspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia refers to pneumonia caused by aspiration of foreign material, often in liquid form, reaching the lungs through the airways. This distinguishes it from most bronchopneumonias that are caused by inhalation of tiny droplets or particles. The response to the aspirated material depends on 3 factors: (1) the nature of the material; (2) the bacteria that are carried with it; and (3) the distribution of the material in the lungs.\n\nConditions that cause septic aspiration pneumonia in animals include force-feeding or inadvertent passing of a nasogastric tube into the lungs; vomiting and regurgitation (e.g., megaesophagus, myasthenia gravis, laryngeal paralysis, and parvoviral enteritis in dogs, recumbency or white muscle disease in cattle); anesthesia; cleft palate; neurologic or laryngeal disease; mouth breathing, including choanal atresia; and bronchoesophageal fistula.\n\nThe lesions of septic aspiration pneumonia are similar to those described for other forms of bronchopneumonia, with alveolar septa (such as in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome). The term \"atypical pneumonia\" has been used in the past to describe interstitial pneumonias; we suggest that its use be abandoned because it also denotes unusual forms of bronchopneumonia. Diffuse alveolar damage. The most commonly identified form of interstitial lung disease is diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which represents diffuse injury to type I pneumocytes or endothelial cells in the alveolar septa, and results in pulmonary edema, formation of hyaline membranes, proliferation of type II pneumocytes, and interstitial fibrosis (Fig. 5-39) . Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a clinically defined condition with an acute onset of bilateral pulmonary disease characterized by hypoxemia but no evidence of left atrial hypertension; diffuse alveolar damage is the histologic lesion in many cases.\n\nGross lesions of DAD are widely distributed throughout the lungs, often with greater involvement of caudodorsal regions (see Fig. 5-39A ). This pattern is in sharp contrast to the cranioventral distribution in most cases of bronchopneumonia. The lesions can either be uniformly diffuse, or lobular with a resulting checkerboard appearance throughout the lung. Histologically, most causes of diffuse alveolar damage follow a stereotyped pattern of response, with an acute exudative phase, subacute proliferative phase, and chronic fibrosing phase. Because of the similar histologic appearance irrespective of etiology, identifying the specific cause is often based on clinical investigations and identifying lesions in other organs.\n\nIn the acute exudative phase, alveolar septa are congested, and alveoli contain protein-rich edema fluid with flocculent material or delicate interlacing fibrin strands and variable numbers of neutrophils and macrophages. Although it may be histologically indistinct, alveolar edema is highly detrimental to lung function, and more readily revealed by diagnostic imaging than by histopathology. The characteristic pathologic finding is the presence of hyaline membranes, which are aggregates of fibrin, other serum proteins, and cell debris (see Fig.  5 -39B). These appear in alveoli and/or alveolar ducts as linear masses of discrete, densely eosinophilic material lining the junction between the airspace and the septum. Because type I pneumocytes are 10 times less permeable than endothelial cells, injury to type I pneumocytes causes loss of interstitial fluid into the alveolus. Alveolar type I and type II pneumocytes reabsorb alveolar fluid by active transport, so injury to these cells further promotes alveolar edema. Although type II pneumocytes cover only 10% of the alveolar surface, they are critical in production and recycling of surfactant lipids and proteins, and their damage leads to abnormal intra-alveolar surface tensions that further damage the epithelium. Similarly, production of secretory phospholipase A 2 in the early stages of diffuse alveolar damage degrades phosphatidylglycerol and results in surfactant dysfunction.\n\nType II pneumocytes repair the alveolar epithelium by spreading along the alveolar surface, proliferating to repopulate the epithelium, secreting new basement membrane, and differentiating into membranous type I pneumocytes. Type II pneumocytes rapidly spread to cover the denuded alveolar surface prior to undergoing mitosis. Single type II pneumocytes are impossible to distinguish from alveolar macrophages on hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E) sections; however, type II pneumocytes are more easily recognized when they form a single layer of cuboidal cells lining the alveolus (see \n\nInterstitial lung disease is a broad term that describes damage to, or inflammation involving, the alveolar or interlobular septa, which represent the interstitium of the lung. This contrasts with bronchitis and bronchiolitis, which involve the airways, and bronchopneumonia, which forms exudate in the airspaces of the alveoli and distal airways (see Fig. 5 -30). The terminology used to classify the interstitial lung diseases suffers from a lack of consensus in veterinary pathology. We use the term interstitial lung disease to define a broad range of conditions affecting or arising from the pulmonary interstitium. In addition to diffuse alveolar damage, other forms of interstitial lung disease in animals include granulomatous and eosinophilic pneumonia; mononuclear cell infiltrates targeting alveolar septa and vascular adventitia (e.g., porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, maedi, and metastrongylid nematode infections such as Muellerius and Aelurostrongylus), multifocal lesions dominated by necrosis (e.g., toxoplasmosis or canine herpesvirus infection) or epithelial proliferation and fibrosis (e.g., equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis), and most pneumoconioses. There are many histologic patterns of interstitial lung disease identified in humans, including diffuse alveolar damage, usual interstitial pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia; most of these have little relevance to diseases of domestic animals. The term \"interstitial pneumonia\" is used in 2 different ways in veterinary medicine: as a synonym for interstitial lung disease to describe a broad range of inflammatory (e.g., viral) or noninflammatory (e.g., toxic) diseases affecting the interstitium, or more narrowly to describe increased numbers of leukocytes, usually lymphocytes and macrophages, within the is initially observed at 2-3 days and is extensive by 6 days after insult. It is a dysfunctional stage of epithelial repair because these cuboidal cells block effective gas exchange. Type II pneumocytes are the major source of basement membrane if this structure has been previously damaged. If the injurious stimulus has been removed, then the type II cells differentiate into type I pneumocytes, and surplus cells undergo apoptosis. The cuboidal type II cells may no longer be visible histologically by 5-7 days after a single mild insult, but may remain for prolonged periods if the injurious stimulus persists or in the presence of interstitial fibrosis. In some cases, the remarkable proliferation of type II pneumocytes may be mistaken for carcinoma.\n\nInterstitial fibrosis develops in 2 ways. Fibrinous alveolar exudates may be invaded by fibroblasts and organized into fibrous tissue that resembles granulation tissue in a skin wound; this fibrous tissue is later incorporated into the alveolar wall and covered by type II pneumocytes. Alternatively, fibrous tissue may develop within the alveolar septum itself as a consequence of repetitive, persistent, or severe damage to epithelial or endothelial cells, or induced by fibrogenic cytokines produced by alveolar macrophages (see Fig. 5 -39C). Fibroblasts can appear within alveoli by 3-5 days after fibrin exudation, collagen fibers can be detected histologically by 5-7 days, and fibrosis may be well developed by 14 days. Myofibroblasts or smooth muscle cells are a prominent feature of some interstitial lung diseases, particularly in sheep (maedi) and cats (feline idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).\n\nThe intimate encounters shared by alveolar epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages are crucial to understanding the chronic sequelae of diffuse alveolar damage. Normal type II pneumocytes limit fibroblast proliferation and the development of fibrosis; conversely, repetitively injured type II pneumocytes and macrophages (or those experiencing endoplasmic reticulum stress) secrete transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and other growth factors that stimulate interstitial fibrosis. On the other hand, growth factors secreted by fibroblasts and macrophages promote type II pneumocyte proliferation and may preclude their differentiation to type I pneumocytes, and this possibly accounts for the observation that fibrotic alveolar septa are often lined by cuboidal epithelial cells. Alveolar fibrosis is not necessarily permanent, as fibrous tissue is remodeled and may be removed by matrix metalloproteases. However, because this process occurs over many months, and because the cause of chronic injury to the alveolar septa is often not identified or eliminated, the finding of marked interstitial fibrosis confers a guarded prognosis.\n\nDiffuse alveolar damage causes hypoxemia that is refractory to oxygen supplementation, the difference between alveolar and arterial oxygen tension resulting from the barrier to diffusion of oxygen across the alveolar wall. Carbon dioxide diffuses more readily than oxygen, so hypercapnia is less frequent than hypoxemia in interstitial lung disease. Pulmonary compliance is reduced, which increases the work of breathing and may reduce the functional lung volume. Cardiac function is expected to be normal.\n\nThe causes of diffuse alveolar damage are legion (Box 5-6), and most induce direct injury to alveolar epithelial cells or capillary endothelial cells in the alveolar septa. Many infectious agents infect type I pneumocytes, including respiratory syncytial viruses, parainfluenza viruses, herpesviruses, feline calicivirus, adenoviruses, and Toxoplasma gondii. Many viruses also infect airway epithelial cells and cause bronchiolar The lung is uniformly firmer than normal, with rubbery texture that lacks the sponginess of normal lung. The cause in this dog was not identified. B. Hyaline membranes (arrows) line the alveoli, and there is protein-rich edema that appears as flocculent material in the alveoli (E).

Alveolar septa have marked diffuse thickening by fibrous tissue, with extensive type II pneumocyte proliferation with increased numbers of foamy alveolar macrophages. Chronic interstitial lung disease in a West Highland White Terrier.\n\nA B E E C epithelial cells. The histologic lesions include hyaline membranes, bronchiolar necrosis, and/or neutrophil infiltration into alveoli, but it is often impossible to determine if these lesions are caused by mechanical ventilation or pre-existing lung disease. Pneumothorax, if present, is more suggestive of ventilator-induced injury, if the clinical history is supportive.\n\nSepsis and endotoxemia are well-recognized causes of interstitial lung lesions. Sepsis induces an inflammatory cascade that affects the function of endothelial cells in the alveolar septa, by cytokine-induced retraction of endothelial cells leading to increased permeability, neutrophil-mediated damage to the endothelium or matrix proteins, and/or by promoting capillary thrombosis. Sepsis also causes surfactant dysfunction; in addition to direct injury to surfactant-producing type II pneumocytes, the serum proteins that flood the alveoli inhibit surfactant function. This in turn provokes atelectasis and abnormal surface tensions in the alveoli that physically damage the type I pneumocytes.\n\nSepticemic lung injury has various histologic manifestations ( Fig. 5-40 ). One is a pulmonary interstitial reaction (interstitial pneumonia), in which the alveolar septa appear hypercellular resulting from hypertrophy of pulmonary intravascular macrophages and/or aggregation of neutrophils and mononuclear cells. A second manifestation is marked congestion and serofibrinous exudation into the alveoli, which appears histologically as flocculent or loosely fibrillar material in the alveoli. Third, some cases have hyaline membranes and type II pneumocyte proliferation typical of diffuse alveolar damage. Finally, thrombi may be identified in small venules and capillaries in some cases of septicemia. Apart from severity and chronicity, the reasons for these differing manifestations are not apparent.\n\nAdditional causes of diffuse alveolar damage include massive trauma, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pancreatitis, multi-organ failure, postvaccinal reactions, and uremia. Although these associations are established, the exact mechanisms are poorly described. Neutrophil-induced lung injury contributes to diffuse alveolar damage in several experimental models, but the importance of this effect in natural disease is controversial.\n\nBronchointerstitial pneumonia. Bronchointerstitial pneumonia has 2 meanings in veterinary pathology. Usually, it denotes the presence of both bronchiolar necrosis and diffuse alveolar damage, and is thus a manifestation of injury to both the bronchiolar and the alveolar epithelium (see Fig. 5 -30). In this context, bronchointerstitial pneumonia can be caused by aerogenous viral infections or inhaled or ingested toxins that affect both of these cell types. Alternatively, bronchointerstitial pneumonia has been used to describe diseases in which mononuclear cells encircle airways and infiltrate alveolar septa, such as in Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections of swine or in mild or subacute viral infections. These patterns are not to be confused with bronchopneumonia, which in a sense is the opposite of bronchointerstitial pneumonia. In bronchopneumonia, bronchioles and alveoli are filled with leukocytes as a result of bacterial infection of the airspace, but necrosis of the bronchiolar or alveolar epithelium is not usually present. necrosis; this pattern of damage to bronchioles and alveoli represents bronchointerstitial pneumonia and is discussed later. Noninfectious causes of direct injury to type I pneumocytes include physical forces (as in surface tension in neonatal hyaline membrane disease, or ventilator-induced lung injury); thermal and chemical injury from inhalation of steam or smoke, as occurs in barn or house fires; acid-induced injury from aspiration of sterile vomitus in monogastric animals (associated with vomiting, anesthesia, or seizures); and inhalation of toxic gases, such as chlorine, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, phosgene gas, and high concentrations of oxygen. Other xenobiotics must be metabolized by type II pneumocytes to reactive intermediates that damage the alveolar epithelium. These include 3-methylindole, ipomeanol, perilla mint, Crofton weed, and chemotherapeutic nitrosourea, and are considered in the section Toxic lung injury.\n\nVentilator-induced lung injury occurs when high tidal volumes cause injury to the alveolar septa and/or the small bronchioles. The most intuitive mechanism is overdistension of alveoli with damage to the septa, leading to interlobular emphysema, pneumomediastinum, or pneumothorax. Less obvious is the repetitive trauma suffered by alveoli and small bronchioles as they collapse at the end of expiration and are subjected to the high pressures required for reinflation. This mechanical strain and shear stress damages the type I pneumocytes and endothelial cells, and thus results in alveolar edema, formation of hyaline membranes, and infiltration of neutrophils in the alveoli or terminal bronchioles. Finally, ventilator-induced injury may result in neutrophil influx and increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the alveolar lining fluid, and this inflammatory response may be stimulated by abnormal stretch or strain pressures on macrophages or BOX \u2022 5-6 tic or anaphylactoid is a matter of debate. The onset of disease is typically 2-8 hours after vaccination, whereas IgE-mediated anaphylaxis usually occurs within 5-30 minutes. Histologic lesions include alveolar edema containing macrophages and neutrophils, congested alveolar septa with infiltrates of mononuclear cells and neutrophils, and periarterial hemorrhages. In diagnostic cases, additional testing may be necessary to distinguish anaphylaxis, sepsis, and other mechanisms of postvaccinal reaction. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis in animals occurs mainly in adult cattle reared in confinement, and rarely in horses, and often affects multiple animals in the group. It results from chronic inhalation of spores of thermophilic actinomycetes (especially Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, formerly Micropolyspora faeni) in moldy hay, leading to inflammatory reactions that occur through several mechanisms concurrently. The bacteria directly activate complement by the alternative pathway, and there is solid evidence for immune-complex (type III) reactions, even though the morphology suggests a delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction. In cattle, tiny gray foci may be grossly visible throughout the lung. \n\nAnaphylaxis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Anaphylaxis affects the lungs in cattle, causing bronchoconstriction, pulmonary hypertension, and systemic hypotension. The lungs are congested and contain alveolar and interlobular edema, the trachea and bronchi contain froth, and emphysema may result from the marked dyspnea. Congestion or edema of the larynx is prominent and potentially fatal in some cases. Bronchoconstriction without marked alveolar changes is more typical of anaphylaxis in cats and horses.\n\nOther reactions to injected materials result from administration of products contaminated by bacteria or their toxins, or inadvertent intravenous administration of vaccines or other drugs. These are not mediated by IgE, and may result from activation of complement, coagulation, or pulmonary macrophages. Whether such reactions should be termed anaphylac- Alveoli are flooded with protein-rich edema fluid, which appears as lightly eosinophilic material containing delicate strands of fibrin (asterisk), in a heifer, with sepsis caused by necrotizing colitis. C. An alternative appearance is hypercellularity of alveolar septa, probably corresponding to hypertrophied pulmonary intravascular macrophages, in a cow, with sepsis caused by acute mastitis. D. A third manifestation of sepsis is thrombosis (arrows) of capillaries in the alveolar septa, in a cow, with sepsis caused by periparturient acute mastitis.\n\nC D * horses, and should be distinguished from the eosinophilic granulomas of multisystemic eosinophilic epitheliotropic disease. Other causes of eosinophilic lung disease in dogs and cats include angiotropic lymphoma (lymphomatoid granulomatosis), eosinophil infiltrates associated with carcinomas and lymphomas, other parasitisms, and fungal infections. Drug reactions cause eosinophil-rich lesions in humans, but are not described in animals.\n\nBell Acute interstitial lung disease in feedlot cattle. Interstitial lung disease commonly causes an acute onset of dyspnea and open-mouth breathing in feedlot beef cattle, particularly those approaching slaughter weights, and is most prevalent in the summer and autumn. Heifers are disproportionately affected in many reports, and the case fatality rate is high. The gross lesions are often variegated as a result of a lobular distribution, and are most prominent in the caudodorsal lung. The red, rubbery, edematous, heavy lungs fail to collapse when the chest is opened, and interlobular and subpleural emphysema is frequent (Fig. 5-41 ). Many cases have concurrent gross lesions of acute or chronic bacterial bronchopneumonia in the cranioventral lung, but these cases may represent a separate disease. Hyaline membranes are the characteristic histologic feature of the acute lesions, and type II pneumocyte proliferation is often present. More variable lesions include bronchiolitis obliterans, infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils, and patchy alveolar hemorrhages that possibly arise from emphysematous rupture of alveolar septa.\n\nThe cause is uncertain. Epidemiologic evidence suggests 3-methylindole, melengestrol acetate (fed to feedlot heifers to suppress estrus), high-energy diets, dusty environment, hot weather, and concurrent bacterial infection as possible causes or contributing factors. Although bovine respiratory syncytial Lymphoplasmacytic or granulomatous infiltrates are consistently present in alveolar septa, often around the bronchi and bronchioles, and multinucleated macrophages are occasionally seen. During acute exacerbations, noncaseating granulomas are accompanied by edema and infiltration of eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Proliferation of alveolar type II pneumocytes, fibrosis of the alveolar septa and peribronchiolar tissue, and bronchiolitis obliterans occurs in chronic cases. Hyaline membranes are uncommon but may follow acute challenge. Similarly, the characteristic lesions in humans and in experimentally challenged dogs are airway-centered, with non-necrotizing poorly formed granulomas in the bronchiolar adventitia and extending into alveolar septa, mononuclear cell infiltrates in bronchioles and centrilobular alveolar septa, peribronchiolar fibrosis, and bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia. The airway-centered distribution is a major diagnostic clue. Ramsay JD, et al. Fatal Granulomatous interstitial pneumonia. Granulomatous pneumonia has diverse infectious causes, including Mycobacterium, Rhodococcus, Actinobacillus, Actinomyces, and Nocardia; the fungal pathogens Blastomyces, Cryptococcus, Coccidioides, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis; a wide variety of parasites, including Angiostrongylus in dogs and Dictyocaulus in cattle; occasional viruses, such as porcine circovirus 2, equine herpesvirus 5, and feline infectious peritonitis virus; and rarely protozoa, such as Balamuthia or Acanthamoeba. Noninfectious conditions include silicosis and other pneumoconioses, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, inadvertent inhalation of barium-containing contrast materials, intravenous injection in horses of Freund's complete adjuvant or immunostimulants containing mycobacterial cell-wall extracts, porcine dermatosis vegetans, endogenous lipid pneumonia, and alveolar histiocytosis.\n\nEosinophilic interstitial pneumonia. The eosinophilic interstitial pneumonias are a compilation of pulmonary diseases united by the presence of eosinophils in the alveoli or alveolar septa. The best described are those caused by parasites, which are discussed more fully in later sections but include both adult parasites residing in the lung and migrating larva. Other conditions probably represent hypersensitivity reactions. Those primarily affecting the airways (including eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy) are discussed above. Eosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis is a rare condition in dogs, characterized by chronic cough, variable dyspnea, and blood eosinophilia. The lungs contain nodular necrotizing lesions formed by eosinophils, epithelioid macrophages, and fibrosis, with type II pneumocyte proliferation and eosinophil infiltrates in the surrounding alveoli. Many dogs with eosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis have heartworm disease, although microfilariae are not detected in the granulomas. Less severe eosinophilic pneumonias are poorly described in dogs and cats, in part because the steroid responsiveness of many cases precludes their examination at autopsy. The alveoli contain eosinophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages, and the degree of fibrosis is variable. A similar condition occurs in be discovered as an incidental finding at autopsy or, when there is more extensive lung involvement, may result in chronic respiratory disease and debilitation. Grossly, DPF appears as multifocal and coalescing large foci of visceral pleural fibrosis (without parietal pleural fibrosis) over the dorsal lungs (eFig. 5-55). Histologically, there is pleural and subpleural fibrosis with subpleural intra-alveolar fibrosis and occasional foci of septal and peribronchiolar fibrosis, as well as arterial and venous intimal fibrosis. In the most severely affected regions, fibrosis extends to the ventral lung. Elastin staining of affected tissue reveals abundant elastin fibers within the regions of fibrosis and disruption of the normal pleural elastic fiber architecture. The pathology of DPF shares features with pleuroparenchymal pulmonary fibrosis in humans, a rare form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. The cause of DPF remains unknown. There is no evidence that the development of DPF is related to lung infection with asinine herpesviruses (AHV) as has been reported with AHV-4 and AHV-5 and the development of chronic interstitial pneumonia in donkeys (see Infectious respiratory diseases of horses, later). Interstitial lung disease in dogs. Diffuse alveolar damage manifesting clinically as acute respiratory distress syndrome is occasionally encountered in dogs of various ages. Affected animals develop acute onset of dyspnea with tachypnea, and variable coughing and lethargy, which is usually rapidly progressive and fatal within 3 days. Findings considered secondary to dyspnea include pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema, and gastroesophageal intussusception. At autopsy, the lungs are diffusely firm with a liver-like texture, edematous and heavy, and mottled (eFig. 5-56; see . Hyaline membranes are a nearly consistent feature and often affect alveolar ducts, with proliferation of type II pneumocytes in the less fulminant cases. Epithelial necrosis or attenuation is often present in terminal bronchioles. Diffuse alveolar damage may be considered to result from either direct injury to alveolar epithelium or as a result of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Specific inciting causes include massive trauma, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, septicemia, bacterial pneumonia in other areas of lung, aspiration of sterile gastric acid, smoke inhalation, oxygen toxicity, other toxins, viral infection, near drowning, and strangulation. Many cases are idiopathic. Similar findings, but localized, may be identified in lung lobes that have undergone torsion, or in areas of ischemia resulting from thromboembolism.\n\nWest Highland White Terrier dogs, 6-12 years old, develop a syndrome of interstitial fibrosis with chronic dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or coughing. Histologic lesions include deposition of collagenous matrix in the alveolar septa and around small blood vessels . The interstitial fibrosis is diffuse or patchy in distribution but may be more severe near the pleura or bronchioles, and is quite variable in severity between animals. Mildly affected cases have discontinuous deposition of matrix in alveolar septa that is most obvious when it forms concentric rings around alveolar capillaries. Severe cases have distortion of alveoli with honeycombing.\n\nvirus occasionally causes acute bronchointerstitial pneumonia soon after arrival in feedlots, it seems not to cause the form of interstitial lung disease occurring late in the feeding period. Some more chronic cases, in which eosinophils and granulomas are present, may represent a hypersensitivity reaction. Stanford K, et Interstitial and bronchointerstitial pneumonia in foals. Bronchointerstitial pneumonia in 1-to 4-month-old foals has been recognized as a sporadic disease for many years, yet the etiology remains mysterious. Affected foals may be found dead without premonitory signs or develop acute onset of severe dyspnea, tachypnea, and pyrexia, with profound hypoxemia and variable hypercapnia. Case fatality rates are high and the foals respond poorly to therapy. It remains possible that there is not a single etiology for this disease, but that the reaction pattern may result from any of several infectious and noninfectious insults.\n\nAt autopsy, lesions are present throughout the lungs in a diffuse or lobular pattern. The lungs are firm, heavy, edematous, reddened, and fail to collapse (eFig. 5-54). Concurrent lesions of Rhodococcus equi pneumonia are present in up to 40% of cases, with cranioventral bronchopneumonia or scattered foci of liquefactive pyogranulomatous pneumonia. Histologic lesions reflect the bronchointerstitial pneumonia, and include necrosis of the epithelium lining terminal bronchioles, alveolar hyaline membranes, exudation of fibrin and a few neutrophils in alveoli, and syncytial cells in the bronchi or alveoli (see Fig. 5 -39B). The prevalence of syncytial cells and the extent of bronchiolar versus alveolar lesions are variable.\n\nA viral etiology is possible, as the age of affected foals correlates with waning maternal passive immunity. A respiratory syncytial virus and equid herpesvirus 2 (EHV-2) have been identified in some cases, but attempts to identify viral agents in the vast majority of cases have been unsuccessful. Other proposed causes include an aberrant response to R. equi or other bacterial pathogens, surfactant dysfunction resulting from production of secretory phospholipase A 2 by infected macrophages, a complication of hyperthermia resulting from bacterial pneumonia or treatment with erythromycin; endotoxemia; and xenobiotics, including 3-methylindole, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and pentachlorophenol, that are metabolized by club cells and type II pneumocytes. Pneumocystis carinii infection (see Infectious respiratory diseases of horses) is a differential diagnosis for subacute lesions with extensive type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and foamy macrophages in alveoli. Britton \n\nLakritz J, et al. Bronchointerstitial pneumonia and respiratory distress in young horses: clinical, clinicopathologic, radiographic, and pathological findings in 23 cases (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) \n\nChronic interstitial lung disease is uncommon but not rare in cats, and is usually seen as chronic progressive tachypnea, respiratory distress, and cough in middle-aged to older cats. The disease has been likened to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis) in humans. Lesions are often present throughout the lung, but tend to be patchy or multinodular rather than diffuse (eFig. 5-57). The histologic lesions include multifocal or irregular areas in which alveolar septa are remarkably thickened by smooth muscle, fibrosis, and focal clusters of fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts. Alveoli are lined by prominent cuboidal or columnar epithelial cells, which often contain mucus or occasionally undergo squamous metaplasia. There is variation in the relative prominence of the epithelial proliferation and matrix deposition . Interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes is a variable finding, and concurrent bronchioloalveolar carcinomas are identified in some affected cats. The cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in cats and humans is unknown. Emerging evidence in humans and animal models suggests that apoptosis of type II pneumocytes, resulting from shortened telomere length or from endoplasmic reticulum stress, leads to a failure to maintain and repair the alveolar epithelium. Subsequently, epithelial cell apoptosis is known to stimulate fibrosis in the underlying connective tissue. Thus dysregulation of type II pneumocyte survival and function is a possible mechanism for development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Williams K, et Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Interstitial and bronchointerstitial lung disease is common in neonatal foals and is occasionally encountered in other species. In foals, the Some cases have proliferation of alveolar type II pneumocytes with atypia, cytomegaly, and occasional multinucleation. Other findings may include proteinaceous material in alveoli, increased number of alveolar macrophages, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes, or interstitial infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages.\n\nProgressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease of unknown cause also occurs sporadically in adult dogs of a variety of other breeds. Histologically, the disease differs from what is seen in West Highland White Terriers. In these dogs, the fibrosis is not uniformly dense collagen as in usually seen in Westies, but rather consists of a mix of plump fibroblasts, immature collagen, and mild inflammation. The alveolar epithelial cells overlying the regions of fibrosis vary from plump and cuboidal in some cases, to markedly attenuated with features of atypia in others.\n\nDalmatian dogs, 4-10 months-old, develop an apparently inherited condition characterized by bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia and dysplasia. Affected dogs have a short course of tachypnea, increased respiratory noise, and dyspnea. The lungs are diffusely wet, heavy, firm, and purple-red with scattered hemorrhages. The microscopic findings are multifocal, peribronchiolar, or subpleural, with bronchiolar epithelial cells affected by hyperplasia, atypia, and sometimes squamous metaplasia, as well as alveolar type II pneumocyte proliferation, fibrosis of alveolar septa, and mild infiltrates of mononuclear leukocytes. The adjacent lung tissue is edematous with hyaline membranes. \n\nFurther reading \n\neFigure 5-57 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in a cat, with fibrous tissue causing irregular distortion of the lung tissue.\n\novale. After a few hours, meconium compromises lung function by eliciting an inflammatory response and by interfering with surfactant activity. In contrast, aspiration of squamous epithelial cells elicits little reaction and is a common incidental finding (eFig. 5-59). Familial forms of neonatal respiratory distress seem to occur but are not documented in domestic species. Interstitial lung disease caused by mutation of genes involved in surfactant function are described in humans and rodents, and their manifestations vary between genotypes and species: Deficiency of the phospholipid transporter ABCA3 causes lymphocytic interstitial infiltrates and alveolar proteinosis; SP-A deficiency is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or increased susceptibility to bacterial infection; SP-B mutations result in alveolar proteinosis, failure of formation of tubular myelin, and/or diffuse alveolar damage; SP-C mutations in humans cause fibrosis of the alveolar septa with infiltration of mononuclear cells, similar to that seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; and SP-D-deficient mice develop alveolar lipidosis with type II pneumocyte proliferation. A familial form of neonatal respiratory distress is described in pigs, and may result from pulmonary dysmaturity caused by congenital hypothyroidism. Affected piglets have diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes and bronchiolar necrosis, and features suggesting hypothyroidism, including mildly prolonged gestation, fine hair coat, generalized edema, and thyroid follicular hyperplasia with lack of colloid. Lopez Lipid pneumonia and alveolar filling disorders. Lipid pneumonia is a special form of aspiration pneumonia in which droplets of oil are aspirated into the lung. Spectacular flooding of the lungs occurs when mineral oil is drenched through a stomach tube accidentally placed into the lung, or lesser amounts are aspirated if the oil is carelessly given per os. Oily droplets are noticed in the trachea and bronchi, or when sections of lung are immersed in formalin (eFig. 5-60). The reaction is typically dominated by macrophages, but the appearance depends on the nature of the oil. In general, vegetable oils such as olive oil are not irritating and eventually resorbed with little reaction or fibrosis. Oils of animal origin are irritants and provoke early exudation of serofibrinous fluid and leukocytes. This is later replaced by foamy macrophages and giant cells that fill the alveoli; the alveolar septa are thickened by mononuclear cells and fibrosis. The oil is ultimately resorbed. The purest cellular response occurs to mineral oil, which is the usual offender in animals. Mineral oil can be identified by its permanence and by its failure to stain with osmic acid. The alveolar lipid is both extracellular and intracellular within macrophages. In time, lipid-laden macrophages accumulate in peribronchial and interlobular septal lymphatics, and there is fibrosis of these tissues and of alveolar septa. Pneumonias causes include equid herpesvirus 1, septicemia, hyaline membrane disease, and meconium aspiration. Other causes of respiratory disease in neonates include bronchopneumonia secondary to placentitis or aspiration of ingesta, and persistent pulmonary hypertension. The biology of pulmonary surfactant (see Cellular architecture and cell biology of the lung, previously) is central to the pathogenesis of hyaline membrane disease.\n\nNeonatal hyaline membrane disease is well recognized in premature or full-term foals, and is occasionally seen in premature puppies, calves, lambs, and piglets. A similar condition is prevalent in cloned calves. The pathogenesis in domestic species is assumed to result from a failure of the immature type II pneumocytes to secrete functional surfactant, leading to elevations in surface tension that cause alveoli and small bronchioles to collapse with each exhalation. The tension and shear stress imparted on the lung during reinflation of these collapsed airspaces injures type I pneumocytes and club cells. Abnormalities of surfactant have been documented in premature calves with hyaline membrane disease, but have not been adequately investigated in other species of domestic animals. Fetal hypothyroidism and possibly hypoadrenocorticism are causes of the condition in piglets, because thyroid hormone is necessary for maturation of type II pneumocytes. Other contributing factors in all species are fetal asphyxia, aspiration of meconium in amniotic fluid, reduction in pulmonary arteriolar blood flow, and inhibition of surfactant by fibrinogen, other serum constituents in edema fluid, or by components in aspirated amniotic fluid.\n\nAffected foals have respiratory distress from the time of birth, an expiratory grunt or \"bark,\" hypoxemia, and in some cases heart failure and/or convulsions and opisthotonos. The lungs are diffusely atelectatic, plum-red, rubbery, and sink or become partially submerged in formalin. Histologically, in addition to the thickened hypercellular alveolar septa expected in immature lung (see eFig. 5-15), hyaline membranes line the collapsed alveoli and sometimes the small bronchioles (eFig. 5-58). Alveoli are edematous, and cellular debris is occasionally noted.\n\nPulmonary hypertension results from pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction that may develop in neonatal hypoxia. The elevations in pulmonary arterial pressure can maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale, with right-to-left shunting exacerbating the hypoxemia. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic complication of prematurity, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen therapy in human infants, is characterized by alveolar hypoplasia, thickening of alveolar septa by type II pneumocyte proliferation and fibrosis, bronchiolar damage, and medial hypertrophy of pulmonary arteries; this complication is rare in domestic animals.\n\nMeconium aspiration syndrome is described in human infants, neonatal calves, and rarely in other species. Affected lungs contain variable but usually low amounts of amorphous yellow-orange meconium, keratin, and/or squamous epithelial cells, associated with atelectasis, hemorrhage, and a mild but diffuse alveolar infiltrate of neutrophils, macrophages, and occasional multinucleated cells. When bacterial placentitis is present, pneumonia caused by aspiration of fluids before or during delivery can induce similar lesions and should be ruled out by bacterial culture. Aspirated meconium immediately obstructs airways, thereby inducing hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which leads to pulmonary hypertension and right-to-left shunting across the ductus arteriosus or foramen 516.e1 eFigure 5-58 Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease) in a premature foal. A, B. Eosinophilic hyaline membranes line alveoli, which contain edema, flocculent proteinaceous material, and increased numbers of macrophages.\n\nA eFigure 5-59 Aspiration of squames with minimal inflammatory reaction in an equine fetus, presumed to have resulted from fetal distress during delivery. surfactant lipids and proteins may result when they are produced in excess by type II pneumocytes, as occurs in rabbits and rats following inhalation of silica dust, surfactant protein (SP)-B deficient humans, or SP-D knockout mice. Alternatively, impaired degradation of these lipids and proteins by alveolar macrophages induces a similar lesion, as occurs in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) knockout mice, humans with autoantibodies to GM-CSF, interleukin-10-induced inhibition of GM-CSF function, or inherited absence of the receptor. A similar lesion occurs in goats with pneumonia caused by caprine arthritis encephalitis virus. Pulmonary hyalinosis, which consists of multifocal accumulations of macrophages and giant cells containing hyaline or laminated material, is seen as an incidental finding in the lungs of old dogs. Histologically, the cytoplasm of macrophages and giant cells is greatly distended by amorphous or laminated, amphophilic, strongly PAS-positive material. This finding is in contrast to the extracellular deposits seen in pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis.\n\nPulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is characterized by concentrically laminated PAS-positive concretions that form extracellular deposits in the alveoli and may be incorporated into the alveolar septa ( Fig. 5-44 ). This condition is rare in animals, but may be associated with clinical signs of respiratory disease if the lesions are extensive. An analogous condition in humans has an apparently familial basis in some cases, whereas others are sequelae to heart failure. X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy of the microliths reveals phosphorus and calcium, reflecting their composition of calcium phosphate, calcium hydroxyapatite, or carboxyapatite.\n\nMultifocal osseous metaplasia (ectopic ossification, \"osteoma\") of the pulmonary interstitium is frequently encountered as an incidental finding in dogs and other species (eFig. 5-63). Histologically, this appears as well-demarcated tiny nodules of bone within the lung parenchyma.\n\ncaused by aspiration of exogenous lipid must be differentiated from the so-called endogenous lipid pneumonias described later. The most important distinguishing feature is that, in lipid aspiration pneumonias, there are extracellular globules of lipid. In paraffin-embedded sections, these appear as clear spherical spaces with distinct borders formed by the compressed cytoplasm of macrophages and giant cells. Lipoid pneumonia caused by mycobacteria is a differential diagnosis.\n\nAlveolar filling disorders are a group of conditions characterized by accumulation of abnormal material within alveoli. They are usually incidental findings but are occasionally responsible for clinical disease. In general, material accumulates in alveoli because its clearance is impeded by obstructed airways, it is produced in excess, or its removal is impaired. These conditions are often overlapping, and include alveolar histiocytosis, endogenous lipid pneumonia, alveolar proteinosis, alveolar phospholipidosis, pulmonary hyalinosis, and alveolar microlithiasis.\n\nAlveolar histiocytosis and endogenous lipid pneumonia (foam cell pneumonia, cholesterol pneumonia) are opposite ends of a spectrum characterized by focal accumulations of foamy macrophages in alveoli. The condition is most frequently encountered in laboratory rodents and mustelids but is also seen in cats. Minor lesions of alveolar histiocytosis are common in dogs. Many cases are idiopathic, but some are sequelae to obstruction of airways by exudates, bronchoconstriction, tumors, or anomalous bronchi, with the result that lipids such as surfactant accumulate within alveoli. Drug-induced alveolar phospholipidosis in laboratory rodents is a welldescribed sequel to administration of a group of cationic amphophilic drugs, and is also seen with mutations in the surfactant protein D. Lipid storage diseases and injury to type II pneumocytes by particulates and irritant gases are additional causes described in humans. The lesions should be distinguished from the foamy macrophages encountered in Pneumocystis, Histoplasma, Leishmania, or environmental mycobacterial infections.\n\nGrossly, the lungs have irregularly distributed, often subpleural, yellow-white, firm foci that appear as sharply defined flecks or bulging nodules that rarely exceed 1-cm diameter (eFig. 5-61). Histologically, lesions of alveolar histiocytosis are often subpleural and multifocal, consisting of alveoli filled with foamy macrophages, with only small amounts of interstitial fibrosis and accumulation of lymphocytes and plasma cells (eFig. 5-62). The lesion is considered endogenous lipid pneumonia if lipids can be demonstrated within the macrophages by oil red O or Sudan black stains on frozen sections. In severe cases, there are intracellular and extracellular cholesterol crystals (but no extracellular lipid droplets), more severe interstitial fibrosis, accumulation of neutrophils and mononuclear cells, and type II pneumocyte proliferation. The large cholesterol crystals stimulate development of giant cells and intraalveolar fibroplasia.\n\nAlveolar proteinosis (and lipoproteinosis) is a rare but clinically significant disorder characterized by accumulation within alveoli of acellular granular eosinophilic or amphophilic material consisting of surfactant proteins and phospholipids. The material is strongly PAS-positive and diastase-resistant, particularly at the periphery, and ultrastructurally consists of lamellar and tubular myelin-like arrays. Alveoli may be lined by type II pneumocytes, and foamy macrophages are present, but inflammation and fibrosis are usually minimal. The accumulation of \n\neFigure 5-61 Alveolar histiocytosis. In this ferret, tiny pale nodules have similar texture to normal lung, and are a common incidental finding in mustelids and cats.\n\neFigure 5-62 Alveolar histiocytosis. In this dog, a few subpleural clusters of alveoli contain foamy macrophages, a common incidental finding in dogs that is usually not grossly evident.\n\neFigure 5-63 Osseous metaplasia forming multiple tiny nodules of bone, as an incidental finding in the lung of an old dog. been documented in horses beyond California. Thus the pathogenesis may be more complex than is currently assumed, and may not be the result of silicate inhalation. Toxic lung injury. The lung is the target of toxic injury by several mechanisms: inhalation of gases or fumes that are directly toxic to epithelial or endothelial cells, ingestion or inhalation of toxins that are metabolized to reactive intermediates mainly by club cells or type II pneumocytes, hypersensitivity reactions, effects of inhaled persistent material such as asbestos or fiberglass, and xenobiotic-induced carcinogenicity. Typical lesions include epithelial cell necrosis, hyperplasia, dysplasia, squamous metaplasia, or neoplastic transformation; alveolar histiocytosis; or fibrosis. Inhaled or ingested xenobiotics causing nasal lesions are well studied in animal models, but are rarely encountered in diagnostic veterinary pathology.\n\nSevere lung injury from inhalation of toxic gases is rarely encountered in domestic animals because they do not have the occupational exposures that are usually responsible in humans. The anatomic location of injury by inhaled toxins depends on the dose, chemical reactivity, aqueous solubility, and particle size. Water-soluble gases, such as sulfur dioxide and ammonia, usually cause upper respiratory injury, whereas less soluble gases, such as nitrogen dioxide, are more widely distributed and may cause bronchiolar or alveolar injury. Poisoning of cattle, pigs, and chickens by nitrogen dioxide (silo gas) can cause massive mortality, with lesions of pulmonary edema and congestion, necrosis of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium, and alveolar hemorrhage and/or fibrin exudation. Acute pulmonary injury caused by smoke inhalation is seen in animals trapped in burning buildings (see Fig. 5-14) . When asphyxiation is not immediate, the combined chemical and heat effects of smoke can cause widespread epithelial necrosis and exudation, and death within a few days. Exposure to copper-containing drenches, perhaps by aspiration, causes bronchiolar necrosis in sheep, with elevated copper levels in lung but not liver. Hydrocarbon waterproofing sprays are reported to cause lung disease in dogs, but the lesions or mechanisms are not defined.\n\nExposure to 85-100% oxygen (or perhaps lower levels, in animals with pre-existing lung disease) damages capillary endothelium and type I pneumocytes, and causes serofibrinous exudation in alveoli or diffuse alveolar damage. In intensive care patients, it may be impossible to determine if diffuse alveolar damage was caused by the underlying disease, or hyperoxic or ventilator-induced lung injury. Reactive oxygen species (superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide) are currently favored as the injurious metabolites, causing cellular injury by lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and DNA strand breaks. Neutrophil-dependent lung injury and dysfunction of surfactant are additional proposed mechanisms of hyperoxic lung injury. Pneumoconiosis. Pneumoconiosis-lung disease ensuing from inhalation and retention of inorganic dusts-is uncommon in animals because they lack occupational exposures that are the basis for most human cases. In general, inorganic dusts are engulfed by and persist within macrophages, which secrete mediators that induce the characteristic fibrosis and granulomatous inflammation. Mild pulmonary anthracosis is a common incidental finding in city-dwelling animals or those cohabiting with cigarette smokers, in which carbon particles accrue within macrophages adjacent to airway bifurcations, including the wall of terminal bronchioles. Asbestosis is characterized by asbestos (ferruginous) bodies-asbestos fibers coated with ferritin and hemosiderin that are linear with a beaded appearance and globose ends-within granulomatous and fibrosing lung lesions. The ability to form ferruginous bodies varies by species, thus asbestos-related lung disease in some animals can be difficult to diagnose. Sheep have been used as an experimental model of the disease, but natural cases are rare. Asbestos-associated mesothelioma seems not to occur in domestic animals.\n\nSilicate pneumoconiosis in horses, and rarely dogs, is the only reported clinically important pneumoconiosis in animals. In horses, this disease is occasionally erroneously referred to as \"silicosis\". Silicosis is a disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica-a 3-dimensional arrangement of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) tetrahedra-particles that are largely derived from quartz, and thus most common in people who work with quartz-bearing stone or rocks. Silicates, on the other hand, are common crustal minerals formed when SiO 2 combines with a variety of cations, especially magnesium, calcium, and aluminum. Asbestos is a fibrous silicate whose inhalation may result in asbestosis (described previously), whereas nonasbestos silicate pneumoconioses refers to disease associated with inhalation of a variety of non-asbestos, that is, nonfibrous, silicates. The clinical signs associated with silicate pneumoconiosis in horses include weight loss, exercise intolerance, and dyspnea, and the condition in horses has been associated with osteoporosis. Miliary firm or gritty lesions are distributed throughout the lung. Microscopically, the lesions are mainly centered on bronchioles or, less frequently, target the interlobular septa and consist of multifocal fibrosis with granulomatous inflammation, often with necrosis and mineralization in the centers. Clear, brown, or black crystals are indistinctly visible in the cytoplasm of the macrophages. These are sometimes birefringent, can usually be highlighted by acid-fast stains, and are identified by X-ray spectroscopy. Although the cause of this severe pulmonary disease is reported to be the result of inhalation of silicate particles, based on finding such particles associated with the characteristic granulomatous inflammation, no studies have been performed to confirm the pathogenicity of silicates in horses. Histologically, silicates are commonly detected in the lungs of many species as an incidental finding unrelated to progressive fibrosing lung disease, and pulmonary lesions similar to silicate pneumoconiosis have congestion, emphysema, and rarely eosinophil infiltration, but not hyaline membranes; and extrinsic allergic alveolitis, in which lymphocytes and granulomas form beside bronchioles and within alveolar septa. In contrast to the predominantly alveolar damage in ruminants, experimental 3-MI toxicity in horses causes necrosis of club cells in the bronchioles, probably reflecting the species-dependent distribution of cytochrome P450.\n\n4-Ipomeanol from moldy sweet potatoes induces a comparable condition in calves, of diffuse alveolar damage with or without bronchiolar injury following CYP-induced formation of a reactive intermediate. Perilla ketone toxicity (from perilla mint, Perilla frutescens) in cattle and horses follows a similar pattern, ascribed to the toxin 1-(3-furyl)4-methylpentatone. Other toxins causing diffuse alveolar damage in cattle include stinkwood (Zieria arborescens, a small tree in southeastern Australia), moldy garden beans, Brassica (turnip tops or kale), and rape. Crofton weed (Eupatorium adenophorum, Ageratina adenophora)-specifically, the flowering plant-causes multifocal or diffuse chronic interstitial lung disease in horses, in which proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells and fibroplasia are the prominent features. Similarly, horses chronically ingesting Crotalaria spp. containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids develop interstitial fibrosis with hyperplasia and dysplasia of bronchiolar and alveolar duct epithelium, with or without alveolar type II pneumocyte proliferation. Carbolic dips used to prepare sheep for showing is also reported to cause fatal pulmonary disease 1-3 days later, probably by absorption through the skin, with pulmonary lesions of hyperemia, edema, and type II pneumocyte proliferation.\n\nParaquat is a highly toxic herbicide that can cause acute diffuse alveolar damage if inhaled or ingested. Acute lung injury has been reported in cattle, sheep, pigs, and dogs following ingestion of foodstuffs contaminated with the herbicide. Paraquat is taken up by type I pneumocytes and induces alveolar injury through reduction-oxidation (redox) cycling, depleting the cells of NADPH and glutathione, which results in uncontrolled generation of superoxide anion and oxidant injury. Cases of malicious poisoning are more likely to cause fulminating pulmonary edema and hemorrhage because of the high dosage, whereas in accidental poisonings, there is more often time for hyperplasia of alveolar type II cells and fibroplasia to be superimposed on the earlier exudative changes. In the acute intoxication with survival up to 2-3 days, the lungs are heavy, dark, and rubbery, and alveolar spaces are filled with fluid and blood, with much fluid in the hilar connective tissue. Hyaline membranes are present in alveolar ducts. With longer survival, profuse fibroplasia and type II pneumocyte proliferation thicken the alveolar septa. Extrapulmonary lesions are often present and include patchy necrosis of the adrenal zona glomerulosa and of renal tubular epithelium.\n\nOther toxins cause pulmonary vascular disease. Fumonisin B1, a mycotoxin usually associated with corn, causes massive interlobular pulmonary edema and hydrothorax as well as pancreatic necrosis in pigs. The toxin causes damage to alveolar endothelial cells associated with altered sphingolipid metabolism. Similarly, poisoning by the rodenticide \u03b1naphthylthiourea (ANTU) causes respiratory distress resulting from pulmonary edema and pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascular lesions are also produced in horses, pigs, sheep, and cattle by pyrrolizidine alkaloids (Crotalaria, Trichodesma, Senecio); the resulting vascular lesions are described in the The toxicity of other compounds depends on their conversion to reactive intermediate metabolites by phase I enzymes that include several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. The CYP isozymes have a species-dependent distribution in nasal tissue, club cells, type II pneumocytes, and to a lesser extent in ciliated epithelial cells, type I pneumocytes, endothelial cells, and pulmonary macrophages. Reactive intermediates generated by CYP isozymes are further detoxified by phase II enzymes, including glutathione-S-transferases and glucuronyltransferases, to form water-soluble metabolites that are excreted. However, toxicity may develop when the phase II systems are inadequate (e.g., when glutathione is depleted or glutathione-S-transferase activity is impaired or absent) or overwhelmed by high concentrations of the reactive metabolite. In these situations, the electrophilic metabolite binds to essential proteins or nucleic acids, or leads to formation of oxygen radicals that damage cell membrane lipids. Thus the cellular susceptibility to toxic injury depends not only on cellspecific expression of the appropriate cytochrome P450 isozymes, but also on the adequacy of the antioxidants (glutathione, vitamin E, superoxide dismutase, and others) and phase II enzymes that protect the cell from injury. Inherited polymorphisms in CYP genes and induction of CYP by glucocorticoids or other drugs may also influence the susceptibility of individual animals to pulmonary toxins.\n\n3-Methylindole (3-MI) toxicity causes acute bovine pulmonary emphysema and edema, or fog fever, in cattle. L-tryptophan in grazed pastures is metabolized in the rumen (or the large colon of nonruminants) to 3-MI, and this is converted primarily by CYP to an electrophilic intermediate that alkylates cellular macromolecules, resulting in lipid peroxidation and membrane damage. The early ultrastructural changes are necrosis of nonciliated and ciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells and type I pneumocytes, and transient swelling of endothelial cells. Although type II pneumocytes have high CYP activity, the high levels of glutathione and phase II enzymes are thought to spare these cells from injury.\n\n3-MI toxicity affects adult cattle in the autumn, within 4-10 days after they are moved from dry to lush pastures; younger animals are resistant to the toxic effects of 3-MI. Affected animals have acute onset of dyspnea with expiratory effort, tachypnea, open-mouth breathing, and froth in the mouth. The trachea is filled with foam, and the lungs contain striking alveolar and interlobular edema, resulting in heavy wet lungs that fail to collapse. Interlobular or bullous emphysema is prominent in the caudal lobes in less fulminant cases (see Fig. 5-41) . Histologically, hyaline membranes line the edematous alveoli and alveolar ducts, and type II pneumocyte proliferation is extensive in the subacute stages. The alveolar septa are distended by edema, and may contain eosinophils and/or neutrophils in natural cases. Although bronchiolar lesions are often absent in natural cases, bronchiolar necrosis is described following intentional administration of 3-MI. The differential diagnoses for this histologic picture includes other toxins listed later as well as post-patent forms of Dictyocaulus viviparus infection, for which the histologic lesions are very similar, but recent access to lush pasture would favor fog fever; acute infection with Ascaris suum or Dictyocaulus larvae, which generally occur in younger calves and have many eosinophils with at least a few histologically visible larvae; viral pneumonia, which may be difficult to distinguish without laboratory testing unless viral syncytia or inclusion bodies are present; anaphylaxis, which causes pulmonary edema, erode through the pleura to cause empyema, through blood vessels and into airways to cause massive blood loss, or into a bronchus to cause suppurative bronchopneumonia.\n\nThe relatively simple anatomy of the pleura belies the underlying complexity of the tissue. Mesothelial cells form a thin continuous layer and produce an underlying basal lamina. Although the thoracic mesothelial lining is contiguous, it is subdivided into parietal pleura, covering thoracic wall, diaphragm, and mediastinum; and visceral pleura, covering the lungs.\n\nMesothelial cells are flat cells with surface microvilli on their apex; tight junctions between the cells have an important role in maintaining proper thoracic fluid balance. Mesothelial cells sample materials within the thoracic cavity, using both pinocytosis to take in pleural fluid as well as phagocytosis to engulf particles such as bacteria. The cells participate in inflammation through production of cytokines and deposition of extracellular matrix, and are capable of synthesizing large amounts of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins. Both procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins are produced by the mesothelium, and an imbalance in these proteins, especially plasminogen-activator inhibitor, can promote pleural fibrin deposition.\n\nMesothelial cells normally have little baseline mitotic activity, and their ability to replace themselves following injury is not well understood. In response to pleural injury, mesothelial cells become cuboidal, and during long-standing stimulation often form villus projections into the pleural cavity covering a core of mesothelial-derived extracellular matrix and small capillaries.\n\nThe pleura has limited local defenses. Kampmeier's foci, found within the parietal pleura of the costal surface and mediastinum, are aggregates of lymphocytes and macrophages and are covered by a layer of modified mesothelial cells that are assumed to function similarly to mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues in the surveillance of the pleural fluid. Grossly, these aggregates may be seen as small white foci within the costal parietal pleura.\n\nPleural fluid is present in very small amounts (1-2 mL) in health. It provides for mechanical coupling between the lung and the chest wall in the negative-pressure environment of the thoracic cavity, and acts as a lubricant during respiration. Fluid enters the pleural cavity through stomata in the parietal pleura, following a hydrostatic gradient, and is pulled into the pleural space with the recoil of the lung during respiration. Pleural fluid is removed through stoma in the visceral and parietal pleura, and to a lesser extent by transcellular means through mesothelial cells. Pleural effusion occurs when filtration of fluid exceeds reabsorption. Less commonly, pleuroperitoneal migration of fluid may result in fluid accumulation in the thoracic cavity through microscopic portals in the diaphragm when ascites is present.\n\nCongenital anomalies of the pleura and mediastinum are of little significance. Congenital cysts of branchial pouch origin are rarely encountered, most often in brachycephalic dogs. They are found in the cranial mediastinum, often in close association with thymic tissues, and are lined by a single layer of cuboidal epithelium. Bronchogenic cysts are occasionally identified in the mediastinum. Degenerative changes in the pleura occur in uremia in dogs, with mineralization of elastic sections Pulmonary vasculitis and Pulmonary hypertension, previously. Pimelea spp. (St. George disease), which contains simplexin and dihydroxycoumarin glycoside toxins, is another toxic cause of pulmonary hypertension in cattle and horses in Australia. Sodium selenite and selenomethionine, found in selenium-accumulator plants ingested by lambs, causes mainly myocardial necrosis but also pulmonary edema and hemorrhage resulting from vasculitis of the alveolar septa.\n\nDrug reactions are important causes of acute or chronic pulmonary injury in humans, manifesting as pulmonary edema, asthma-like disease, bronchiolar necrosis, diffuse alveolar damage, eosinophilic pneumonia, pulmonary vascular disease with hemorrhage, or pleural effusion. Pulmonary drug reactions are poorly described and apparently rare in domestic animals. CCNU, a nitrosourea chemotherapeutic used for treatment of lymphoma, causes chronic lung injury with interstitial fibrosis and smooth muscle hyperplasia as well as type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. Botha CJ, et al. Crotalariosis equorum (\"jaagsiekte\") \n\nEmbolic pneumonia results from hematogenous distribution of infectious and/or inflammatory processes within the lung. The pattern of embolic pneumonia is multifocal, and grossly appears as discrete, variably sized, rounded foci of necrosis and inflammation leading to abscess formation (eFig. 5-64). Few forms of embolic pneumonia have characteristic clinical presentations or pathology. An exception is embolic aspergillosis in horses with colic. These animals develop severe hemorrhagic and necrotizing embolic pneumonia associated with disseminated Aspergillus spp. infection in association with a history of antecedent colitis. Pulmonary abscesses may reflect an embolic process but can also arise from chronic bronchopneumonia. A cranioventral location and associated bronchiectasis are evidence of the abscess originating from bronchopneumonia. Multiple widely distributed abscesses usually indicate hematogenous origin, and are often associated with an obvious source of septic emboli elsewhere in the body, such as endocarditis, or hepatic abscesses with phlebitis of the hepatic vein in cattle. The occurrence of abscesses in other tissues supports a hematogenous route of infection. Other causes of pulmonary abscess include aspirated foreign bodies such as plant awns, direct traumatic penetration of the lung, or multisystem diseases such as caseous lymphadenitis and melioidosis. It is often impossible to determine the pathogenesis of isolated abscesses if lesions are not identified in other tissues. Abscesses may eFigure 5-64 Embolic pneumonia in a cow secondary to localized cellulitis. A. The lung contains multiple nodules that are more easily palpated than seen. B. The nodules have purulent centers and a fibrous capsule.\n\nA causes pleural opacity because of reactive hyperplasia of mesothelial cells, which produce fibrous thickening of the underlying pleural connective tissue. Hydrothorax is caused by increased venous pressure, lymphatic obstruction, rarely hypoproteinemia, or by extension from a peritoneal effusion. It is particularly common in cats with cardiomyopathy (with either left-or right-sided heart failure), and occasionally develops from heart failure in other species. Hydrothorax is also a feature of specific diseases such as lung lobe torsion, \"mulberry heart disease\" in swine, black disease in sheep, African horsesickness, and \u03b1-naphthylthiourea poisoning.\n\nChylothorax is the accumulation in the pleural space of lymph, which appears milky and has a high triglyceride and lymphocyte content (eFig. 5-66). The diagnosis is confirmed by measurement of a higher triglyceride concentration in the fluid than in serum, or a reduced cholesterol-to-triglyceride ratio. Chylothorax is seen in cats and occasionally dogs, and most cases are idiopathic. Recognized causes include cardiomyopathy and right-sided heart failure, where increased central venous pressure prevents emptying of lymph from the thoracic duct into the vena cava; vena caval thrombosis; thoracic masses, such as lymphoma, thymoma, or granulomas that cause thoracic duct obstruction; or infrequently dirofilariasis, lung lobe torsion, diaphragmatic hernia, or congenital anomalies in Afghan Hounds. Traumatic rupture of the thoracic duct is a well-known but rarely identified cause. Chylous effusion causes atelectasis and stimulates noninflammatory pleural fibrosis. Repeated removal of the effusion may induce dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, depletion of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins, hypoproteinemia, and lymphopenia.\n\nHemothorax is the presence of blood in the pleural cavity. It is most often the result of traumatic rupture of blood vessels, but it can also be caused by coagulopathies, such as anticoagulant rodenticide toxicity; rupture of highly vascularized tumors, such as hemangiosarcoma; lung lobe torsion; or erosion of a vessel by an inflammatory or neoplastic process (eFigs. 5-67, 5-68). Chronic hydrothorax or chylothorax may lead to the development of well-vascularized papillae on the pleura, and rupture of these may result in a blood-stained effusion. Singh A, et \n\nInfectious agents most often reach the pleura from the blood or from lesions of bronchopneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, or abscesses in the underlying lung. Other routes of infection include perforation of the chest wall or diaphragm, penetrating foreign bodies from the esophagus or reticulum, perforating esophageal ulcers, lymphatic permeation from the peritoneal cavity, or direct extension from a mediastinal abscess. Pleural defenses against microorganisms are much weaker than those of the lung, and even a few organisms reaching the pleural surfaces are apt to have serious consequences. The appearance varies depending on the species affected, cause, magnitude of infection, and chronicity. Fibrinous exudates often form loosely adherent strands or veils of elastic material on the pleural surface (eFig. 5-69). In more florid and collagen fibers in the parietal pleura of the intercostal spaces; this change is grossly most consistently evident in the first 3-4 cranial intercostal spaces. Pleural cysts lined by keratinizing squamous epithelium are described in horses, but their cause is uncertain. Tetrathyridia of the cestode Mesocestoides spp. cause cystic lesions on the pleural surface. \n\nPneumothorax refers to the presence of air or gas in the pleural cavities, and results in atelectasis because negative intrapleural pressure cannot be maintained. In normal animals at the time of autopsy, the diaphragm billows caudally with an in-rush of air reflecting the loss of negative intrathoracic pressure when the diaphragm is pierced; these features are absent in cases of pneumothorax (but may also be lost with significant autolysis of the body). In small animals, where detection of this diaphragmatic movement and in-rush of air in normal animals may be challenging, pneumothorax could be detected by opening the chest under water and observing the escape of air bubbles. Pneumothorax results in atelectasis, but in chronic cases, there may also be hyperplasia or metaplasia of the pleural mesothelium as well as type II pneumocyte proliferation in the adjacent alveoli. Pneumothorax can be spontaneous or traumatic. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax refers to rupture of blebs or bullae in the absence of apparent lung disease. Blebs and bullae are common causes of pneumothorax in dogs (see section Pulmonary emphysema, previously). Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax refers to those cases resulting from an underlying lung disease. The causes include rupture of lesions that form a communication between the airway and pleural space, such as parasitic cysts (e.g., paragonimiasis), abscesses, pyogranulomas, neoplasms, migrating foreign bodies, or infarcts. Other causes lead to emphysematous bulla formation: barotrauma (from forced ventilation during anesthesia), bronchopneumonia, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and thromboembolism. Traumatic pneumothorax is usually the result of accidental puncture of the thoracic wall and/or visceral pleura. Traumatic pneumothorax can also be a complication of cardiac resuscitation or biopsy of the lung. Air that tracks through the pulmonary interstitium to the mediastinum (pneumomediastinum) does not usually escape into the pleural cavities unless there is traumatic rupture of the mediastinum. \n\nFurther reading Davies C, Forrester SD. Pleural effusion in cats: 82 cases (1987 . J Small Anim Pract 1996; 37:217-224. tous pleuritis and mediastinitis contain infrequent aggregates of filamentous bacteria (Fig. 5-46 ). Inhaled or ingested grass awns or florets that migrate into the pleural space are thought to be the source of infection in most cases, although they are usually impossible to find in the copious pleural exudate.\n\nOther causes of pleuritis in dogs include bite wounds, esophageal perforation, or bacteremia. Sparganosis, caused by larval cestodes of the genus Spirometra, result in pleural thickening caused by chronic inflammation, with the presence of 6-mm long rice-grain-like structures (plerocercoids or spargana). The latter have multiple invaginations of the tegument, subtegmental muscle, loose stroma of low cellularity that contains clear \"osmoregulatory canals,\" no coelomic cavity, and no reproductive or digestive tracts.\n\nIn cats, feline infectious peritonitis is a common cause of pleuritis, and multifocal pyogranulomas are visible on the pleural surface. Pyothorax is fairly common in cats, and Pasteurella multocida, various gram-negative enteric bacteria, streptococci, and staphylococci are commonly isolated, often in mixed infection. Although most cases are idiopathic, penetrating bite wounds, extension from bacterial pneumonia, migrating awns, or penetration of a foreign body from the esophagus are likely causes.\n\nfibrinous lesions, the prosector may find voluminous serofibrinous exudate when the chest is opened, and lakes of watery clear yellow fluid alternate with pockets of turbid and foulsmelling exudate (Fig. 5-45 ). Creamy white suppurative exudate fills the pleural space in cases of pyothorax or thoracic empyema (eFig. 5-70). Chronic lesions readily form adhesions between the parietal and visceral pleura, yet the functional impact of adhesions on lung function is usually minimal.\n\nPleuritis in swine may be an extension from obvious lesions of bronchopneumonia caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae or A. suis. Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, and Mycoplasma hyorhinis are common causes of septicemia in swine, and the fibrinous or fibrinopurulent pleuritis caused by these agents is usually accompanied by exudates on other serosal surfaces, joints, or meninges. The causes in cattle include bronchopneumonia, especially from Mannheimia haemolytica or Histophilus somni, direct extension from lesions of traumatic reticuloperitonitis, septicemic H. somni infection (see Fig. 5 -45), and Pasteurella multocida type B.\n\nPleuritis in mature horses often occurs with a recent history of travel, and is described later (see Infectious respiratory diseases of horses). The pleural exudate is unilateral or bilateral, and usually so florid that it masks the causative underlying lung lesion, but nearly all cases have either a focal area of consolidated lung that suggests aspiration pneumonia (eFig. 5-71), or a bilateral lesion of necrotizing bronchopneumonia. Mycoplasma felis is an uncommon cause of pleuritis in horses without underlying lung lesions. Pleuritis occurs in neonatal foals with septicemia caused by Actinobacillus equuli or other gram-negative bacteria.\n\nIn dogs, pyothorax occurs mostly in hunting dogs or those with access to rural environments. The lesions are bilateral or occasionally unilateral, and pneumonia is absent or minor. The exudate is often bloody and opaque, resembling tomato soup, or creamy or darkly serofibrinous (eFig. 5-72). The pleural surfaces are usually thickened and velvety, red or gray-yellow, and fibrotic. Actinomyces, Nocardia, and Bacteroides spp. are the most frequently recovered organisms, and these are commonly associated with the presence of yellow \"sulfur\" granules amid the pus. Histologically, the characteristic pyogranuloma- with the notable exceptions of Australia and Sweden. It is an important cause of reproductive failure and interstitial pneumonia, and a predisposing factor for bacterial pneumonia and septicemia. The disease varies greatly in severity and clinicopathologic presentation, depending on the strain of the PRRS virus (PRRSV), the age of pigs affected, the level and distribution of immunity within the herd, and the presence of other pathogens.\n\nOn initial exposure, infection spreads slowly through the naive herd and causes a variety of clinical presentations: anorexia and lethargy of all age groups; reproductive failure characterized by late-term abortion, stillbirth, mummified fetuses, and weak-born piglets; and interstitial pneumonia causing fatal hyperpnea, dyspnea, and lethargy in suckling pigs infected in utero or in the neonatal period; respiratory disease is also common in weaned and grower-finisher pigs. \"Sow abortion and mortality syndrome\" describes a devastating disease resulting from PRRSV infection of naive herds, in which up to half of the sows may abort and sow mortality may reach 10%.\n\nViral infection often persists and circulates within the herd indefinitely, the result of prolonged viral shedding from individual animals and continuous entry of na\u00efve animals. The disease in endemically infected herds is highly variable. Many herds have stable infections in which virus continues to circulate but does not cause clinical disease; others have endemic respiratory disease or a failure to thrive in nursery and growerfinisher pigs, or a PRRSV-induced increase in susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia and septicemia, and some herds have continuing losses because of abortion in gilts or dyspnea in neonatal or weaned pigs.\n\nThe PRRS virus is an enveloped, 50-65 nm diameter, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus in the family Arteriviridae. The viral genome includes 8 open reading frames (ORFs): ORF 1a and 1b encode proteins necessary for replication and transcription, ORFs 2-4 encode structural glycoproteins of uncertain function, ORF 5 encodes an envelope glycoprotein, ORF 6 encodes the integral membrane protein M, and ORF 7 encodes the nucleocapsid protein N. PRRSV isolates are divided into type 1 (European-like) and type 2 (North American-like) genotypes.\n\nGenomic variability is an important feature of PRRSV, and may be attributed to the high mutation rate associated with the error-prone RNA polymerase and perhaps recombination between viral strains in coinfections. As a result, PRRSV isolates vary in terms of the severity of respiratory disease, reactivity in antigen-and nucleic acid-based diagnostic assays, and possibly in patterns of lesions in other organs, including brain and heart. These differences in virulence have not been shown to correlate with simple alterations in specific genes; rather, the virulence of particular strains is apparently determined by a combined effect of many genetic differences. Highly virulent strains have been associated with greater replication of virus within tissues; higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-\u03b3 (which may lead to systemic disease resulting from \"macrophage activation syndrome\"); more severe lesions within tissues; and greater susceptibility to septicemia from secondary bacterial pathogens.\n\nModified live vaccine strains may rarely cause disease. Vaccine strains of the virus can infect in-contact animals and persist in herds, but do not commonly cause clinical disease. However, as these vaccine strains circulate in swine herds, mutation to a less attenuated form of the virus may result in Further reading Barrs \n\nMesothelioma arises from the pleura, as well as from the pericardium or peritoneum (eFig. 5-73). Histologically, epithelioid, sarcomatous, and biphasic patterns are described. The epithelioid cells form nests, ribbons, acini, or papillary protrusions that resemble carcinoma, and the mesenchymal component may resemble fibrosarcoma. Distinguishing mesothelial hyperplasia from mesothelioma can be a diagnostic challenge. The latter is expected to fully invade collagenous connective tissue within the pleura and usually extends into underlying lung tissue along interlobular or alveolar septa. In contrast, in humans, features suggesting a reactive lesion include abundant pleural fibrin, multinucleated mesothelial cells in the fibrin, capillaries growing perpendicular to the pleural surface into the fibrin, and parallel rather than storiform arrangement of collagen. Immunohistochemical detection of both vimentin and cytokeratin, and detection of acid mucins by Alcian blue stain, are useful in distinguishing mesothelioma from other epithelial or nonepithelial neoplasms. However, pulmonary adenocarcinomas also frequently co-express cytokeratin and vimentin; positive thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) labeling may be useful for differentiation from epithelioid mesothelioma. Calretinin and HBME-1 are used as markers of mesothelioma in humans but have been inconsistent or negative in animals. Pleural mesothelioma spreads and implants within the pleural cavity to cause persistent thoracic effusion, invades the underlying tissue, and may reach the abdominal cavity via lymphatics.\n\nMetastatic neoplasms localizing to the pleura are more common than mesothelioma. Transpleural dissemination of carcinomas and sarcomas may occur by extension from the lungs, chest wall, or mediastinum, and carcinomas from the abdominal cavity can reach the pleura by pleuroperitoneal migration of fluid through the diaphragm. \n\nInfectious respiratory diseases of swine\n\nPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) was first identified in the late 1980s and is now worldwide in distribution,\n\nFurther reading Reggeti F, et moniae exacerbates the clinical signs and lesions of PRRS, possibly because mycoplasma-induced proliferation and activation of macrophages enhance the replication or persistence of PRRSV. In contrast, infection with PRRSV has little effect on the severity of mycoplasmal lesions. This finding is of clinical importance, as control of M. hyopneumoniae is one strategy for minimizing the effect of PRRSV in endemically infected herds. The effect of PRRSV infection on immune responses to other pathogens has not been fully addressed, but a state of generalized immunosuppression is not a likely feature of PRRS. Animals infected with PRRSV develop apoptosis of alveolar and pulmonary intravascular macrophages, and of mononuclear cells in alveolar septa. Because apoptotic cells are more numerous than virus-infected cells, the mechanism of apoptosis may not represent a direct effect of viral infection. Similarly, although interstitial pneumonia is extensive in swine with PRRS, virus-infected cells are relatively infrequent, suggesting a role for host-derived factors such as cytokines in development of lesions.\n\nThe major lesions of the postnatal form of PRRS include interstitial pneumonia, generalized lymphadenopathy, and lymphocytic infiltrates in multiple organs. Gross lung lesions vary from undetectable to affecting the entire lung, and tend to be most striking in younger age groups. The lungs fail to collapse when the diaphragm is incised, occasionally retain impressions of the ribs, and have generalized, patchy, lobular, or diffuse distributions of lesions. Affected areas of lung are discolored tan or red, and have a firm texture reminiscent of thymus, which contrasts with the crisp hard texture of bacterial pneumonia ( Fig. 5-47) . A cut section reveals separation of lobules and oozing of edema fluid. In pigs that develop bacterial bronchopneumonia secondary to PRRS, lesions of cranioventral consolidation may be superimposed on the diffuse interstitial pneumonia. In these cases, the lesions of PRRS may be subtle, yet play a critical role in the development of pneumonia in the herd. Lymph nodes throughout the body-most notably the bronchial, mediastinal, cervical, and inguinal nodes-are enlarged, white or tan, solid, and rarely contain multiple clear cavitations on cut section. Periocular and subcutaneous edema, pulmonary infarcts, myocardial necrosis, renal petechiae, and serous effusions into body cavities are variable findings.\n\nHistologic lung lesions are of interstitial pneumonia. Alveolar septa are thickened because of infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages (see Fig. 5-47B ). This feature is easily obscured by atelectasis in routinely prepared samples, but can usually be confirmed by searching for areas of lung in which alveoli are not collapsed. Alveoli contain a cellular infiltrate of macrophages, lymphocytes, and fewer neutrophils, and scattered clusters of alveoli are filled with necrotic cells with pyknotic nuclei or free chromatin. The finding of necrotic alveolar macrophages and aggregates of free chromatin is highly suggestive of PRRS. Type II pneumocytes are increased in number, but may or may not form a continuous layer of cuboidal epithelium lining the alveolus. Bronchiolar epithelium is not affected by PRRSV, and a finding of bronchiolar necrosis should incite a search for an alternative or additional diagnosis.\n\nHistologic examination of lymph nodes, tonsils, and spleens of pigs with PRRS may reveal follicular and paracortical hyperplasia, and apoptosis of follicular lymphocytes. Multinucleated cells, probably of histiocytic origin, may be present. Although this lesion is also common in porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) disease caused by vaccine-derived strains. Extra-label intranasal administration of modified live PRRSV vaccine has induced clinical signs and lesions typical of PRRS.\n\nThe common mode of transmission of PRRSV is direct nasal, oral, or coital contact with saliva, oropharyngeal mucus, urine, semen, serum, mammary secretions, or perhaps feces of infected pigs. Transmission of PRRSV by artificial insemination has been documented, and transmission by contamination of pharmaceutical preparations or needles with infected serum is a potential risk. Transmission by fomites may occur, but because the enveloped virus is rapidly inactivated in most environmental conditions, disinfection procedures should be effective. Aerosol transmission is apparently of limited importance, but can occur at low frequency over short distances.\n\nThe pathogenesis of PRRS centers on infection of macrophages at the site of nasal, tonsillar, or pulmonary infection, extension to associated lymphoid tissue, rapid viremia, and infection of macrophages throughout the body. Following experimental intranasal challenge, viral antigen is expressed within 12 hours of infection in nasal and tonsillar macrophages and epithelium; pulmonary alveolar, intravascular, and interstitial macrophages; bronchiolar epithelium, and endothelial cells of pulmonary arterioles. Viremia occurs rapidly, in some cases within 12 hours of infection, and leads to widespread infection of monocytes and tissue macrophages. Viral antigen may be detected in myocardial macrophages and endothelium, follicular macrophages and dendritic cells in lymph node, interdigitating cells in the thymus, macrophages and dendritic cells in the spleen and Peyer's patches, and macrophages in hepatic sinusoids, adrenal gland, interstitium of the kidney, and choroid plexus.\n\nPersistent infection is a key feature of PRRSV. Virus has been detected in serum for 3 weeks; in nasal mucosa, pulmonary macrophages, and spleen for 4 weeks; and in oropharyngeal mucosa for up to 22 weeks after infection. Animals remain infectious for in-contact naive pigs for at least 22 weeks after infection. Persistent infections are of epidemiologic importance in the maintenance of PRRSV infection in endemically infected herds; yet the reasons for failure of the immune response to clear the infection and the role of cellmediated immunity in protection and viral clearance are unknown. Following experimental PRRSV infection, serum antibody detectable by ELISA and virus-neutralizing tests are first detectable at 7-14 days and 9-28 days after infection, peak at 5 weeks and 10 weeks, and remain detectable for 46 weeks and >1 year, respectively. Antibody responses are directed against all proteins encoded by ORFs 2-7; the products of ORF 3, 4, and 5 may represent protective epitopes.\n\nInfection with PRRSV impairs host defenses, and increases susceptibility to infection with Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis, and other opportunistic pathogens. Experiments to investigate this effect have been conflicting, and the ability of PRRSV to predispose to other agents is probably dependent on the viral and bacterial strains examined and on the specific experimental conditions. The ability of PRRSV to infect and reduce the function of pulmonary intravascular macrophages is one mechanism whereby PRRSV predisposes to septicemia; a similar impairment of alveolar macrophage functions, including phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and cytokine secretion, may reduce lung defenses against bacterial bronchopneumonia. Subclinical or clinical infection with Mycoplasma hyopneu-interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary arteritis, lymphocytic myocarditis and encephalitis, and retroperitoneal and mesocolonic edema.\n\nDiffusely firm lungs and histologic lesions of interstitial pneumonia are common findings at autopsy. In addition to PRRS, a major differential diagnosis is septicemia. Lesions of lymphadenopathy and mild proliferation of type II pneumocytes favor a diagnosis of PRRS, but differentiation requires ancillary testing. PCV-2 may cause a similar pattern of bronchointerstitial pneumonia, but granulomatous infiltrates and inclusion bodies are often present in lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. Proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia causes a similar alveolar lesion to PRRS, but bronchiolar necrosis is a feature of this disease that is absent in PRRS.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry have become mainstays for the diagnosis of PRRS in tissue specimens although other assays may be of value: virus isolation, fluorescent antibody tests, and in situ hybridization. Detection of viral nucleic acid by PCR is a rapid technique that is as sensitive as virus isolation and has become widely used. In addition to tissue samples, PCR assays are performed on serum, oral fluids obtained with cotton ropes, or semen. Serology is useful on a herd level to identify prior exposure to PRRSV in unvaccinated herds. Immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of lung and tonsil is an economical approach to diagnosis, but because these assays are less sensitive than PCR, multiple sections should be examined. Virus isolation on chilled or frozen samples of lung, lymphoid tissues, serum, EDTA-treated blood, or pulmonary alveolar macrophages is a highly sensitive but slow method of diagnosis, but is necessary for further sequence analysis.\n\nResults of diagnostic assays must be interpreted with caution in herds vaccinated with modified live viruses, as vaccine strains of PRRSV may circulate and persist in these herds and cause positive tests. An advantage of using PCR or virus isolation is the use of subsequent molecular analyses that assist in differentiating field and vaccine strains of virus in vaccinated herds. Identification of patterns of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) in ORF 5 is commonly used to monitor patterns of PRRSV infection in large herds, and to differentiate vaccine strains from some field strains. However, the RFLP pattern of vaccine strains may change to an intermediate pattern as they circulate in herds. A second strategy distinguishes vaccine and field strains by identifying glycine and arginine, respectively, in residue 151 of ORF 5.\n\nObtaining a diagnosis of PRRS in aborted fetuses can be frustrating, because lesions are usually absent or nonspecific, and the agent often cannot be identified. Two techniques-the use of PCR assays on fetal lung and lymphoid tissue, and identification of antibody to PRRSV in precolostral sera-are currently recommended, but the low diagnostic rate remains a problem considering the importance of reproductive failure in infected swine herds. Gauger PC, et al. Genetic infection, it has been described in PRRSV-infected pigs that have no evidence of PCV-2 infection. Perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells occur in many organs in PRRS. Commonly affected sites include the nasal mucosa, heart, kidney, and brain. Severe neurologic disease occasionally occurs in association with other manifestations of PRRS, possibly related to the infecting viral strain, and lesions of the central nervous system include lymphocytic meningoencephalitis, lymphocytic perivascular cuffs, and focal gliosis. PRRSV may cause vasculitis in the lung and other organs, manifesting as necrosis of the walls of large and small blood vessels in addition to perivascular and mural infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells.\n\nAborted fetuses usually lack gross or histologic lesions, and, when present, the lesions are often not specific for PRRSV. Infection may progress from one fetus to another, resulting in live, stillborn, and mummified fetuses in the same litter. Fetal lesions that suggest PRRS include segmental or diffuse hemorrhage of the umbilical cord resulting from fibrinoid necrosis and suppurative inflammation of the umbilical artery, mild Identification of influenza A virus subtypes is important because there is limited cross-protection between subtypes; thus it is imperative that vaccines in current use are representative of circulating field strains. Subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 are common in swine in North America, but infection of swine is documented with many other subtypes, including reassortants of swine, avian, and human viruses. Influenza virus is transmitted by infected droplets, aerosol, or contact with infected secretions. After experimental infection, serum antibody titers are detectable in many pigs by 7 days and peak 2-3 weeks after infection, and mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG are maximal at 1 and 4 weeks after infection, respectively. Pigs shed virus for 5-7 days after infection, although viral antigen is often cleared from the lung in as little as 72 hours after infection. Virus infection is probably maintained in swine populations by continuous infection of naive swine, as there is no evidence of a long-term carrier state or significant wildlife vector.\n\nThe gross lesions of swine influenza include a cranioventral lobular distribution of atelectasis, which is often sharply demarcated from normal lung tissue (eFig. 5-74, Fig. 5-48 ). Affected lobules are red, firm, and collapsed. Adjacent lobules are occasionally emphysematous. Generalized pulmonary edema may occur. Mediastinal and bronchial lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, but usually not congested. The mucosa of the trachea and bronchi is often hyperemic and edematous. The development of secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia may obscure the gross lesions of swine influenza and cause red, firm, raised, lobular lesions in the cranioventral lung.\n\nThe histologic lesions reflect necrosis of airway epithelium and, to a lesser extent, alveolar epithelium, and include attenuation of bronchiolar epithelial cells; necrotic debris and neutrophils in bronchiolar lumens; atelectasis; and peribronchiolar, perivascular, and interstitial infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells (see eFig. 5-74, Fig. 5-48 Swine influenza. Orthomyxoviruses are pleomorphic, spherical to filamentous, 80-120 nm viruses containing negative-sense single-stranded RNA. Transcription of viral genes occurs in the nucleus, viral proteins are produced in the cytoplasm, and virions bud from the plasma membrane. Three genera of orthomyxoviruses are described based on variation of the nucleocapsid proteins: (1) influenza A viruses cause influenza in swine, horses, humans, and other species; (2) influenza B viruses represent human isolates only; and (3) influenza C viruses are rare and cause mild or subclinical infections in humans and swine. Orthomyxoviruses readily develop genomic variants, because of genetic drift caused by point mutations and genetic shift caused by recombination of genomic segments. Identification of viral strains is based on antigenic variation of the 15 hemagglutinin (H) and 9 neuraminidase (N) envelope glycoproteins, which mediate virus entry into cells and release of virus from infected cells, respectively. Analysis of viral strains is of practical importance in epidemiologic tracking of outbreaks and changing disease patterns, and to ensure that vaccine strains are representative of those in the field to ensure protective immunity.\n\nInfluenza viruses are usually host specific, and although several strains are known to cross species barriers, transmission rates are generally low, and most foreign strains are not maintained in the population. Although the direct zoonotic potential is of only moderate consequence, this phenomenon is important in the evolution of new viral strains. Because swine possess cell-surface receptors for both avian and human viral strains, swine may act as hosts for reassortment among avian, porcine, and human strains of influenza viruses, with the potential for human pandemics resulting from the introduction of novel pathogenic strains into immunologically naive human populations. However, it is now recognized that such reassortment can also occur in other species.\n\nInfluenza viruses are transmitted by aerosol or by contact with secretions. Infection is usually restricted to the respiratory tract, although myocarditis, myositis, and encephalitis are more frequent in carnivores and occasionally seen in horses and humans. Such non-respiratory lesions may be a consequence of viremia, or an effect of \"cytokine storm\" with dysregulation of cytokine production in the respiratory tissues.\n\nSwine influenza is an important form of respiratory disease, manifesting as rapidly spreading outbreaks of severe nonfatal disease or as endemic disease as part of the porcine respiratory disease complex. Disease outbreaks are most common in the winter in cool climates, or late summer in warm climates. Disease severity may be enhanced by stresses, seasonal change in climate, PRRSV infection, or concurrent disease. Vaccination may enhance the disease that results from subsequent challenge with heterologous strains of the virus. Outbreaks of disease have a characteristic clinical presentation: The disease appears acutely and spreads rapidly to affect all ages of pigs, and despite severe clinical signs of coughing, fever, and stiffness, most pigs recover in 5-14 days, and the mortality rate is low. An endemic form of disease is also common, in which pigs develop bacterial bronchopneumonia secondary to subclinical infection with influenza virus. In this form of disease, the clinical picture is not specific for influenza and differentiation from other causes of porcine respiratory disease complex requires laboratory testing. \n\neFigure 5-74 Swine influenza.

Vincent, USDA-ARS.) circular single-stranded DNA. Porcine circovirus 1 (PCV-1) is a nonpathogenic virus that was discovered as a cell culture contaminant. Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) is pathogenic and was first isolated in 1997 from pigs with a novel disease, postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Three genogroups-2a, 2b, and 2c-are recognized. Since its original identification in 2004, PCV-2b has become the predominant genogroup, but the associated spectrum of lesions appears comparable among the 3 genogroups.\n\nPMWS was originally described in high-health herds, but many herds with PMWS are infected with PRRSV or other pathogens. Serum antibody to PCV-2 is widespread in swine herds, and PCV-2 infection is common in herds with no clinical evidence of PMWS. PMWS usually progresses slowly within the herd, with most cases developing in 5-to 12-week-old pigs. Morbidity is typically 5-10% but may be up to 20%, and most affected animals die or are euthanized. Pigs with PMWS lose weight or gain poorly, and have a variable combination of tachypnea, respiratory distress, diarrhea, pallor, and jaundice. Although uncommon, the finding of jaundice in swine should suggest a diagnosis of PMWS.\n\nPorcine circoviral antigen and nucleic acid are most consistently present in the cytoplasm of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells throughout the body, and less often in the nuclei and cytoplasm of epithelial cells in bronchioles, pulmonary alveoli, liver, renal tubules, stomach and intestine, and pancreas. Vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells occasionally express circoviral antigen. Transmission is poorly characterized.\n\nPCV-2 is sufficient to cause PMWS, as experimental infection of gnotobiotic or cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived pigs induces mild clinical signs and lesions of PMWS in the absence of other demonstrable pathogens. However, coinfection with PCV-2 and other pathogens, including parvovirus or PRRSV, results in more severe disease. Immunostimulation itself, either as a consequence of viral infection or vaccination, precipitates more severe disease. Thus activation of the immune response may encourage replication of PCV-2, resulting in more severe manifestations of PMWS. The role of PCV-2 in other swine diseases, termed PCV-associated diseases (PCVAD), remains controversial, in part because the virus can be isolated from many healthy pigs. In particular, although many pigs with dermatitis-nephropathy syndrome, proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia, sow abortion and mortality syndrome, congenital hypomyelination, and abortion with fetal myocarditis have evidence of PCV-2 infection, definitive proof of their causal association is lacking.\n\nThe spectrum of gross lesions and their severity are highly variable. Swine with PMWS are often thin, pale, and may be jaundiced. Lymph nodes throughout the body-particularly the inguinal, mesenteric, and bronchial nodes-are enlarged, soft, and white or gray-tan, and this lymphadenopathy is the most consistent feature of PMWS. Lung lesions, which are common, consist of interstitial pneumonia with generalized firm or rubbery texture, failure to collapse, and mottled color (see Fig. 5-47A) . Cranioventral bronchopneumonia is a frequent concurrent lesion. The liver may be atrophic and discolored yellow-orange. Kidneys may contain patchy pallor or obvious white foci. Lesions resembling dermatitis-nephropathy syndrome may also occur, including swelling and edema of the kidneys, and cutaneous hemorrhages and necrosis. Infrequent lesions include splenic and cutaneous infarcts, cerebellar hemorrhages, renomegaly and pallor, or necrotizing colitis.\n\nlumens and, to a lesser extent, alveoli contain neutrophils, and alveoli are atelectatic and edematous. Mononuclear cell infiltration occurs by 48 hours after infection. Alveolar injury, manifesting as exudation of neutrophils and scant fibrin with thickening of alveolar septa, is described in experimental cases at 48 hours after infection, but is often inapparent in pigs experiencing natural disease, or obscured by bacterial pneumonia. Later lesions include hyperplasia of airway epithelium as regeneration occurs, and peribronchiolar and perivascular aggregation of lymphocytes and plasma cells as immune responses develop. Infection is, in most cases, restricted to the respiratory tract and associated lymph nodes, although viremia has been infrequently described in neonates.\n\nThe diagnosis of swine influenza is suggested by the characteristic clinical signs of severe rapidly spreading disease with high morbidity and low mortality, and by the characteristic histologic lesions of bronchiolar necrosis or bronchiolar targeting of the neutrophil infiltrate (eFig. 5-75). Differential diagnoses for bronchiolar necrosis include porcine circovirus 2 infection, proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia, pseudorabies, Nipah virus infection, and airway injury caused by inhaled toxic gases. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR testing of fresh lung tissue, antigen-detection ELISA on nasal or bronchial swabs, or immunohistochemistry on fixed tissues using monoclonal antibodies to conserved type A nucleoproteins. Initial PCR testing can target the conserved matrix gene, followed by subtype-specific testing or sequencing of the hemagglutinin gene. Virus isolation using embryonated eggs or cell lines is advantageous for subtyping, characterization of isolates, and partial sequencing to compare current and past isolates in a herd. Sample selection is critical for the diagnosis of swine influenza. Viral titers are highest 24 hours after infection, before gross lesions are obvious, and virus often cannot be identified by 72 hours after infection. Consequently, selecting tissue from the cranioventral areas of the lung, from pigs early in the course of the disease, is critical for both histologic and virologic diagnosis. Pigs with a high fever are the most suitable subjects for diagnostic investigation. The transient nature of the infection may complicate an investigation of the role of swine influenza in herds with endemic respiratory disease. In these cases, herd-level serology may be useful. Herd-level PCR testing is also of value, using nasal swabs or oral fluids collected with cotton ropes. obliterans in chronically affected pigs. Peribronchiolar fibroplasia with relatively mild lymphocytic inflammation is suggestive of PCV-2 infection. Liver lesions are highly variable, progressing from mild aggregates of lymphocytes in portal tracts, to single-cell necrosis of hepatocytes, periacinar necrosis, or widespread hepatocellular loss with condensation of hepatic stroma. Granulomatous enteritis with multinucleated cells may be prominent in the ileum, or infrequently in the colon. Perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes and macrophages may be present in other organs, including kidney, myocardium, leptomeninges, pancreas, adrenal, stomach, and intestine. These lesions may be associated with renal tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis, or necrosis of cardiac myocytes. Vasculitis, with necrosis of tunica muscularis accompanied by lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, and exudative glomerulonephritis are less common lesions. Lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis with or without vasculitis are reported.\n\nInfection with PCV-2 is usually identified using immunohistochemistry or PCR. Assessing the viral load by PCR may be of value, as this is higher in wasting than in subclinically infected pigs. The virus may be isolated in PK15 cells or identified by in situ hybridization, but these find more use in research than as diagnostic techniques. Serologic assays, including indirect immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase tests, have been developed, but the high prevalence of antibodies to PCV-2 in healthy pigs limits the diagnostic usefulness of these tests.\n\nA diagnosis of PMWS is mainly based on the demonstration of consistent clinical findings and gross and histologic lesions, and is supported by the demonstration of active PCV-2 infection by immunohistochemistry or PCR. PRRS is the major differential diagnosis for lesions of interstitial pneumonia and lymphadenopathy in pigs. The following are helpful differentiating features, but the lesions of PMWS and PRRS may be difficult to distinguish, and many pigs are coinfected with PCV-2 and PRRSV:\n\n\u2022 Multiple basophilic inclusion bodies in macrophages are a diagnostic feature of PCV-2 infection, and support the diagnosis of PMWS. \u2022 Bronchiolar necrosis is present in some cases of PMWS (and swine influenza), but is not a lesion of PRRS. \u2022 Lung lesions of PMWS tend to be dominated by macrophages, whereas lesions in PRRS are more lymphocytic, although there is much overlap in the morphology of these diseases. \u2022 Granulomatous infiltrates and multinucleated macrophages in lymphoid organs are more typical of PMWS than of PRRS, although both lesions may be present in PRRS. The histologic lesions of PMWS include lymphoid depletion and granulomatous lymphadenitis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, enteritis, interstitial nephritis, myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, and vasculitis. Inclusion bodies were commonly observed when the disease initially emerged in the 1990s but are less common in contemporary cases. The inclusions are in macrophages, intracytoplasmic, usually multiple in a single cell, and basophilic. Inclusion bodies are most numerous and obvious in lymphoid tissues, including lymph nodes, Peyer's patch, tonsil, splenic periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths, and thymus ( Fig. 5-49 ). In these tissues, there is depletion of lymphocytes from B-cell follicles, with striking infiltration of macrophages into follicles and, to a lesser extent, T-cell-rich paracortical areas. Multinucleated histiocytes may be present amid the granulomatous infiltrates. Widespread necrosis of lymphocytes in follicles is described but rare.\n\nHistologic examination of the lungs of pigs with PMWS reveals diffuse or patchy granulomatous interstitial pneumonia. Epithelioid macrophages, multinucleated macrophages, lymphocytes, and fewer eosinophils or neutrophils infiltrate alveolar septa and may fill the alveoli. Lymphocytes and macrophages often encircle bronchioles and blood vessels. Bronchiolar necrosis is a variable finding, and may progress to bronchiolitis A B Inclusion body rhinitis. Suid herpesvirus 2 (SuHV-2; cytomegalovirus) infections are ubiquitous and occur throughout the world, but clinical disease is much less frequent. Inclusion body rhinitis, which is caused by SuHV-2, is typically an acute to subacute disease of 3-to 5-week-old suckling piglets. Piglets exhibit fever, sneezing, catarrhal nasal exudate, shivering, and occasional dyspnea. Morbidity is high and mortality is low unless secondary bacterial infections develop. Systemic cytomegalovirus infections usually affect piglets <3 weeks of age. Such animals may be found dead without premonitory signs, or exhibit sneezing, lethargy, and anorexia, subcutaneous edema of the jaw and tarsal joints, and dyspnea. Infection of naive pregnant sows induces mild lethargy, anorexia, and delivery of stillborn or weak piglets.\n\nPiglets commonly shed the virus soon after weaning at 3 weeks of age, suggesting that infection is usually acquired by contact with nasal secretions of infected cohorts. Other pigs, particularly those that develop generalized disease, are probably infected from the sow in the neonatal period. The virus replicates in nasal submucosal and lacrimal glands. Viremia develops 5-14 days after infection, depending on the age of the pig, and leads to infection of epithelial cells in renal tubules, liver, duodenum, and elsewhere. Pulmonary alveolar and splenic macrophages may be additional sites of viral replication. Virus is shed in nasal and ocular secretions, in the urine, and in vaginal secretions of sows.\n\nGross lesions in pigs infected with cytomegalovirus are usually only seen in piglets <3 weeks of age with generalized disease, and may include catarrhal rhinitis, hydrothorax, hydropericardium, pulmonary and subcutaneous edema, and renal petechiae. Histologically, large 8-12 \u00b5m basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies are numerous in the epithelial cells of the nasal mucosal glands and their ducts (Fig. 5-50 ). Affected glands are not diffusely distributed but tend to occur in irregular clusters. As the inclusion forms, cytomegaly and karyomegaly develop. The nuclear membrane becomes indistinct, the inclusions appear as blue-gray smears, and the necrotic epithelium sloughs into the lumen. The developing immune response incites a lymphocytic infiltrate in the lamina propria, macrophages and lymphocytes cluster within degenerating glands, and there is squamous metaplasia of the surface epithelium.\n\nSystemic lesions develop following viremia, with intranuclear inclusion bodies in epithelial cells of renal tubules and glomeruli; lacrimal, Harderian, and salivary glands; and less commonly in hepatocytes and sinusoidal lining cells, adrenal gland, esophageal glands, lymph nodes, spleen, renal medulla, lung, and elsewhere. Inclusions are most numerous in epithelium but also occur in macrophages and endothelial cells; this vascular disease accounts for the petechiation and edema. Inclusion bodies are often accompanied by cytomegaly, lymphocytic infiltrates, and occasionally focal necrosis. Focal gliosis with intranuclear inclusions in scattered glial cells occurs throughout the central nervous system. The viremic phase may last Proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia. Proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia is a severe acute disease of weaner and grower pigs. Affected animals have acute onset of severe dyspnea, tachypnea, and fever. Gross lesions usually affect the entire lung, but may be restricted to the cranial and middle lobes. Lung lesions include remarkably increased firmness, failure to collapse, reddening, and edema. Generalized lymphadenopathy is usually present. Histologically, alveoli are edematous, contain macrophages and abundant necrotic cellular debris, and are lined by cuboidal type II pneumocytes. Alveolar septa are thickened by mononuclear cell infiltration (eFig. 5-76). Although many of these lesions may be present in severe cases of PRRS, bronchiolar necrosis is often present in proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia but absent in PRRS.\n\nThe understanding of the cause of this lesion is made difficult by the presence of multiple viruses. When the lesion was first reported in the early 1990s, it was associated with an H1N1 influenza virus that was genetically and antigenically distinct from common North American swine influenza virus isolates. Later publications associated proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia with PRRSV infection, PCV-2, and H3N2 influenza virus. It remains uncertain whether this lesion is caused by particular strains of PRRSV or by combined infection with several agents, or if it represents a pattern of reaction shared by more than one pathogen. Drolet R, et \n\nAmerican isolates of PRCoV differ, and apparently developed independently from TGEV. Following experimental challenge, neonatal pigs develop viremia and respiratory infection, whereas in 5-week-old pigs, viral antigen is limited to the respiratory tract, particularly alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. Lesions of naturally infected pigs are not described. In experimental cases, there is necrosis of bronchiolar epithelium, mild proliferation of type II pneumocytes, mononuclear cell infiltrates in alveolar septa, and lymphocytes and macrophages in alveoli. Most field cases are subclinical, although coinfection with Bordetella or PRRSV appears to exacerbate the disease. The major importance is that antibodies to PRCoV cross-react with those to TGEV, leading to false-positive serologic tests in swine herds that are expected to be free of TGEV. Diagnosis is based on isolation of the virus or indirect fluorescent antibody tests. Newer blocking ELISAs differentiate these coronaviruses.\n\neFigure 5-76 Proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia in a pig, in this case associated with PRRSV infection. A. The lung is atelectatic and hypercellular. B. Alveoli are lined by cuboidal type II pneumocytes and filled with necrotic cellular and acellular debris, including characteristic darkly basophilic masses of chromatin. Alveolar lesions include multifocal necrosis; sloughing of necrotic alveolar epithelium; fibrinous exudate in alveoli; hemorrhage; infrequent inclusion bodies; and infiltration of lymphocytes, macrophages, and fewer plasma cells and neutrophils. Experimentally, necrotizing lesions develop within 3-6 days of infection, infiltration of lymphocytes is prominent by days 5-8, and repair occurs during days 6-10. The disease also affects dogs and cats, and horses and goats develop an antibody response. Nipah and Hendra viruses are the lone members of the genus Henipavirus (family Paramyxoviridae). Pteropus fruit bats (flying foxes) are the reservoir and major source of infection; pigs are considered a major source of infection for humans and other pigs, whereas human-tohuman transmission appears to be rare.\n\nGross lesions are nonspecific, but the characteristic histologic findings are lymphocytic and/or fibrinoid vasculitis; lymphoid necrosis; syncytial cells within lymphoid tissues, endothelium, and perivascular cells; and intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies. The lesions include lymphocytic meningitis and, to a lesser extent, encephalitis that is present throughout the brain but most severe in the olfactory bulb; necrotizing, lymphocytic, and/or hyperplastic rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis (see Fig. 5 -31); lymphohistiocytic bronchointerstitial pneumonia; necrosis of lymphoid tissues, particularly tonsil and submandibular and bronchial lymph node; and lymphocytic infiltrates in multiple organs.\n\nNipah virus is readily isolated from blood, tonsil, nasal mucosa, lung, and other lymphoid tissues. Viral antigen is demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in epithelial cells in tonsil, trachea, bronchioles, and alveoli; alveolar macrophages; meningeal connective tissue and possibly astrocytes; endothelium and muscularis of inflamed blood vessels; and areas of lymphoid necrosis. Other viral respiratory diseases of swine. Porcine rubulavirus (family Paramyxoviridae) causes \"blue-eye disease,\" an important condition of pigs in Mexico. Clinical manifestations include neurologic disease, respiratory disease, and less frequently, corneal opacity or reproductive failure. Lesions in experimentally infected pigs are of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia with cuffs around bronchioles. Porcine genogroup 1 torque teno virus (family Anelloviridae) is not considered important as a primary pathogen, but it may exacerbate other infections, such as with PCV-2. Challenge of gnotobiotic pigs induced interstitial pneumonia, thymic atrophy, glomerulopathy, and lymphocytic hepatitis. for 2-3 weeks and is followed by persistent infection in pulmonary macrophages.\n\nInclusion bodies, cytomegaly, and karyomegaly are pathognomonic when present. Adenovirus is the only viral agent likely to cause similarly large basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies, but adenovirus does not induce cytomegaly and is usually restricted to intestinal epithelium in swine. The intranuclear inclusions of pseudorabies are eosinophilic, less obvious than those of cytomegalovirus, focal necrosis is more prominent, and lesions are most prominent in brain, respiratory tract, and lymphoid tissue. Confirmation of cytomegalovirus infection may be achieved by electron microscopy to search for herpesviral particles, or by virus isolation, immunofluorescence, or PCR on nasal scrapings, lung wash cells, or kidney homogenates. Pseudorabies. Pseudorabies (Aujeszky's disease), caused by suid herpesvirus 1, is described in more detail in Vol. 1, Nervous system, for neurologic signs predominate in most cases of pseudorabies in young swine. However, certain strains of pseudorabies virus tend to cause respiratory disease, particularly following aerosol exposure of older pigs. The respiratory form is typified by high morbidity and low mortality, unless secondary bacterial pneumonia develops. Affected pigs are depressed, febrile, and display episodes of sneezing, coughing, and dyspnea. Gross lesions in the upper respiratory tract are most common, and include necrotizing rhinitis and laryngotracheitis, with foci of necrosis in the tonsils. Lung lesions are less consistent, but patchy areas of reddening and consolidation may be scattered throughout the lung, or target the cranioventral lung. Histologically, bronchointerstitial pneumonia is characterized by necrosis and sloughing of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium, with frequent intranuclear eosinophilic or faintly basophilic inclusions in the early stages of disease. \n\nFurther reading Corner AH, et by factors that cause ciliary stasis. The interaction between PRRSV and APP infections is controversial. Following inhalation, APP rapidly binds to the epithelium lining terminal bronchioles and alveoli. Neutrophil infiltration and alveolar exudate develop as early as 90 minutes after infection. Neutrophil recruitment is primarily due to secretion of neutrophil chemoattractants by macrophages in response to infection, for bacterial products themselves do not directly induce neutrophil chemotaxis. Leukocyte necrosis is a prominent feature of the histologic lesions, and is presumably mediated by the Apx cytotoxins.\n\nImmunity to APP is conferred by mucosal IgA and serum IgG antibody responses, particularly to the Apx cytotoxins. However, heterologous infections impart only partial immunity, and this effect is not dependent on patterns of Apx toxin expression, implying that antibody against other bacterial antigens also contributes to protection. Antibody against surface components, such as capsular polysaccharide, greatly enhances phagocytosis of APP by neutrophils and macrophages, and neutrophils but not macrophages effectively kill these opsonized bacteria in vitro. In endemically infected herds, maternal antibody declines over the first 12 weeks of life, and active immune responses contribute to increasing titers thereafter. In experimental infections, serum antibody titers are detectable at 2 weeks and maximal at about 5 weeks after infection.\n\nGross findings in pigs that die of contagious pleuropneumonia are typified by fibrinosuppurative, hemorrhagic, and necrotizing lobar pneumonia or pleuropneumonia. Identical gross lesions may be caused by Actinobacillus suis and, less frequently, by Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis; these are important differential diagnoses in minimal-disease herds expected to be free of APP. The lesions commonly affect the middle or caudal lung lobes, and may be unilateral or bilateral (Fig. 5-51 ). Lesions are deep red, firm to hard, protrude above the surrounding lung, and cut crisply. The cut surface often exhibits sharply demarcated, irregularly shaped, 1-10 cm foci of coagulative necrosis that are friable and pale. In peracute cases, interlobular septa are expanded by fibrin and edema, and fibrinous exudate on the pleural surface ranges in appearance from a haze resembling ground glass to mats of fibrin. Krakowka \n\nActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) causes contagious pleuropneumonia, an important cause of severe, often fatal, pneumonia in growing pigs. The disease is most common in 6-week-old to 6-month-old hogs. Disease severity is highly variable, but case fatality rates of 20-80% are common in acute outbreaks. Clinical signs in severely affected swine include fever, lethargy, severe dyspnea, cyanosis, bloody discharge from the nose, and occasionally vomiting or diarrhea. Convalescent pigs with chronic pneumonia may fail to thrive and display exercise intolerance and coughing.\n\nAPP is a gram-negative coccobacillus of the family Pasteurellaceae. Twelve serotypes are defined by antigenic variation in capsular polysaccharide and cell-wall lipopolysaccharide. Serotypes 1, 5, and 7 are most common in North America; serotypes 2 and 9 are prevalent in Europe; and serotypes 1, 7, and 12 are frequent in Australia. Serotypes 1, 5, 9, and 11 secrete both Apx I and II toxins and tend to cause more severe disease than other serotypes. Immunity to heterologous serotypes is only partially protective.\n\nAPP has a rich spectrum of virulence factors important in pathogenesis. Three cytotoxins, named Apx I, II, and III, are members of the RTX (repeats in toxin) family of secreted toxins that includes Mannheimia haemolytica leukotoxin and Escherichia coli hemolysin. A fourth Apx toxin gene expressed in vivo but not in vitro is of uncertain significance. The Apx toxins are potent inducers of cytolysis in porcine neutrophils, alveolar macrophages, erythrocytes, and epithelial cells. Low concentrations induce an oxidative burst in porcine neutrophils. These toxins appear critical to development of disease, as Apx toxin-deficient mutants have reduced virulence that is restored when the toxin genes are reintroduced. Lipopolysaccharide induces macrophage activation and secretion of neutrophil chemoattractants, procoagulant activity, and complement activation, similar to that described for M. haemolytica. The capsule impairs phagocytosis by macrophages and may prevent complement activation. Isolates with thin capsules may be less pathogenic. APP produces superoxide dismutase, catalase, and hydroperoxide reductase, which may protect against oxidative killing by neutrophils and macrophages. Other virulence factors include fimbrial adhesins, outer-membrane proteins, iron-binding proteins, metalloproteinase, and urease.\n\nInfection is acquired by direct contact with infected pigs or by spread of aerosol droplets over short distances. The bacteria may be carried in the nasopharynx of apparently healthy animals, and these carriers are the principal method of introduction onto a naive farm. In contrast to Pasteurella multocida and Bordetella bronchiseptica in pigs and M. haemolytica of cattle, APP often causes disease in the absence of predisposing factors. Nevertheless, disease severity is enhanced by Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae or pseudorabies infections, and \n\nStephano HA, et al. Encephalomyelitis, reproductive failure and corneal opacity (blue eye) in pigs, associated with a paramyxovirus infection. Veterinary Record 1988;122:6-10.\n\nagents. Important contributing environmental factors include elevated levels of dust and ammonia, temperature fluctuations, and extremes of temperature and humidity. In temperate climates, the incidence of swine pneumonia is maximal in the autumn and early winter, in part caused by fluctuating temperatures and the impact of cold weather on barn ventilation and air quality. Immunity to respiratory pathogens is dependent on patterns of pig flow through production units, vaccination practices, and alterations in innate resistance caused by social and environmental stresses, nutrition, and management practices. Against this background of host and environmental factors, interactions between multiple pathogens are commonly identified in swine pneumonia. Thus effective control of disease requires that diagnostic investigations identify not only the immediate causes of fatal disease, but also the underlying infectious and noninfectious factors. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, influenza A virus, and porcine circovirus 2 all cause primary lung disease. In addition, each of these agents impair the normal pulmonary defenses against inhaled bacterial pathogens by, among other mechanisms, impairing mucociliary clearance and suppressing alveolar macrophage function. Swine are commonly exposed to the opportunistic pathogens Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus suis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Haemophilus parasuis, and failure of lung defenses caused by viral or mycoplasmal infection, poor air quality, and stresses are key factors in development of disease caused by these bacterial pathogens.\n\nP. multocida serotypes A and D are important causes of fatal pneumonia in weaner and grower-finisher pigs. The massive doses of P. multocida needed for experimental induction of disease suggest that the predisposing causes listed above are necessary components of the natural disease. Bordetella is particularly noteworthy as a cause of fatal pneumonia in piglets <3 weeks of age, but may also cause bronchopneumonia in older swine. The pathogenesis of bordetellosis is described in the section Infectious respiratory diseases of dogs, later.\n\nGross lesions of bronchopneumonia, in which cranioventral areas of lung are swollen, consolidated, reddened, and sharply demarcated from more normal lung, are typical of infection with these opportunistic bacterial pathogens. In many cases, but not all, mucopurulent exudate may be expressed from airways on cut section. Fibrinous pleuritis may be present but is usually minor. Bronchial lymph nodes are often enlarged and mottled red and white. The predominant histologic findings are numerous neutrophils and macrophages filling alveoli and bronchioles. Fibrin exudation may occur but is usually minor. These lesions contrast with those of A. pleuropneumoniae and A. suis, where fibrinous exudate in airspaces and on the pleural surface is often prominent, most of the neutrophils are necrotic and have streaming basophilic chromatin, and focally extensive coagulative necrosis is often present. In cases of bronchopneumonia, the bronchiolar epithelium is generally normal or mildly hyperplastic, but bronchiolar necrosis is usually absent unless there is underlying swine influenza virus or PCV-2 infection. M. hyopneumoniae also causes a cranioventral pattern of bronchopneumonia, but in contrast to the red swollen lung of bacterial bronchopneumonia, the acute lesions of mycoplasmosis are red and atelectatic, whereas the subacute lesions are gray to tan and only mildly swollen to firm. Cranioventral bronchopneumonia superimposed on generalized or patchy lesions of interstitial The bronchi may contain frothy or bloody fluid, and blood may ooze from the nostrils. Bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes are enlarged, edematous, and congested. The pericardial and peritoneal cavities may contain scant serosanguineous fluid. Lesions in chronically affected pigs include fibrous pleural adhesions, sequestra, and locally extensive pulmonary fibrosis or abscess formation. Acutely affected pigs occasionally develop hyaline thrombi and fibrinoid necrosis of glomerular capillaries, afferent arterioles, and interlobular renal arteries, perhaps mediated by endotoxemia.\n\nMicroscopic investigation of these lesions reveals filling of alveoli and terminal bronchioles by fibrin, neutrophils, fewer macrophages, and many necrotic leukocytes that are probably neutrophils. The foci of necrosis, which are often centered on alveolar septa, are delineated by a basophilic band of intense neutrophil infiltration and extensive neutrophil necrosis. In the center of the necrotic areas, the exudate varies from protein-rich edema, to fibrin, to leukocytes. Many leukocytes contain streaming, lightly basophilic, homogeneous chromatin similar to the \"oat cells\" of bovine shipping fever pneumonia. These neutrophils are in an apparent state of activation, and express tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-8 mRNA at high levels.\n\nThe mucosa of bronchi and bronchioles may be infiltrated by neutrophils with fewer macrophages, and bronchiolar epithelium may be necrotic or sloughed. In this regard, the lesions can resemble those of swine influenza. Thrombi may develop in small venules and capillaries in the alveolar and interlobular septa, and fibrinoid vasculitis has been infrequently described. Lymphatics in the alveolar septa are distended by serofibrinous exudate with variable numbers of neutrophils. Extrapulmonary lesions are uncommon, but include renal glomerular thrombosis, renal vasculitis, or osteomyelitis.\n\nLesions of localized or locally extensive fibrinous and necrotizing pneumonia suggest APP, A. suis or, less commonly, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, as likely causes. Definitive diagnosis depends on isolation of the agent, and microscopic identification of suppurative bronchopneumonia with neutrophil necrosis. Isolation on blood agar requires a Staphylococcus streak or supplemented medium containing a source of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Alternatively, bacteria in lung smears or primary cultures can be identified using antigen detection techniques such as ELISA or latex agglutination. Serologic identification of APP is particularly useful in the maintenance of minimal-disease herds. Bronchopneumonia caused by opportunistic bacterial pathogens. The porcine respiratory disease complex is an exemplar of multifactorial disease causation. Although bacterial pneumonia is the final cause of death in many cases of porcine respiratory disease, its development is highly dependent on host factors, environmental influences, and other infectious osteoclast function; rather, hyperplasia and increased function of these cells are apparently stimulated by soluble mediators secreted from nearby stromal cells in response to the cytotoxin.\n\nDistortion of the snout is a prominent external finding in pigs with chronic atrophic rhinitis. Brachygnathia superior occurs when the maxillary bones of the snout fail to grow. Lateral deviation toward the most severely affected side is common.\n\nAtrophy and malformation of the nasal turbinates are the principal lesions of atrophic rhinitis, and are more severe in the ventral than the dorsal conchae. To assess the integrity of the nasal turbinates, cross-sections of the snout should be made at the level of the first or second upper premolar teeth; in affected pigs, the normally scroll-like turbinates are misshapen and blunted. Turbinate atrophy may be partial or complete, leaving a hollow nasal cavity with an often-deformed nasal septum. Regeneration of atrophic turbinates has been demonstrated in a longitudinal computed tomography study.\n\nHistologic lesions in the nasal turbinates include osteoclast hyperplasia, osteoclast-mediated resorption of bone, and replacement with fibrous tissue containing many plump fibroblasts. Lymphocytes and fewer neutrophils infiltrate the nasal mucosa, and there may be squamous metaplasia of the ciliated epithelium.\n\nThe gross lesions of NPAR and PAR are qualitatively similar, although those of NPAR are generally less severe. Nevertheless, given the significance of a diagnosis of progressive atrophic rhinitis caused by toxigenic P. multocida, definitive identification is usually warranted. B. bronchiseptica and P. multocida can be readily isolated from swabs of nasal mucosa or tonsil, but definitive diagnosis of PAR depends on demonstrating P. multocida cytotoxin production using PCR or an ELISA. Various grading systems have been described to assess the severity of nasal turbinate atrophy. These grading systems are not intended to differentiate NPAR from PAR, but are useful in monitoring the herd response to management or therapeutic interventions. Davies RL, et \n\nGeneral features of mycoplasmas. Mycoplasmas, which are members of the class Mollicutes, are the smallest selfreplicating organisms, lack a cell wall, and have a protein-and lipid-rich plasma membrane. They are obligate parasites, and several species lack the ability to synthesize required amino acids, cholesterol, and fatty acids. The success of culturing mycoplasmas in vitro is highly dependent on the particular species. Some mycoplasmas grow so readily that they commonly contaminate cell cultures, yet many of the pathogenic mycoplasmas grow slowly, have frustratingly fastidious growth requirements, and are easily overgrown by other agents. Mycoplasmas have a relatively small genome, 580-1,380 kb, which contains many repetitive elements and a propensity for pneumonia suggests underlying PRRSV or PCV-2 infection, or septicemia.\n\nAlthough bacterial bronchopneumonia may be the immediate cause of death, viral or mycoplasmal pathogens should be considered as underlying causes. Microbiologic testing is commonly used to identify the spectrum of pathogens causing pneumonia, but the plethora of currently available tests does not diminish the importance of morphologic examination of the lung. Determining the patterns of gross and histologic lesions allows the pathologist to narrow the list of differential diagnoses to select a panel of ancillary tests efficiently, to provide a tentative diagnosis when rapid therapeutic intervention is required or when ancillary microbiologic tests are negative, and to evaluate critically the contribution of particular pathogens, many of which are commonly present in healthy swine, to the case being investigated. Atrophic rhinitis. Nonprogressive atrophic rhinitis (NPAR), caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica and other factors, causes mild transient sneezing and nasal discharge, and is not usually of herd significance. In contrast, progressive atrophic rhinitis (PAR) is caused by toxin-producing strains of Pasteurella multocida, often in concert with other bacterial pathogens, and causes production loss. PAR affects pigs of at least 6-12 weeks of age, causing sneezing, mucopurulent nasal discharge, unilateral epistaxis, nasal deformity, failure to thrive, and secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia. Freedom from PAR is a frequent requirement in minimal-disease herds, so differentiation of PAR and NPAR is of substantial significance. Toxigenic P. multocida infects rodents, cats, dogs, and ruminants, and may be of zoonotic concern.\n\nBoth NPAR and PAR are multifactorial conditions for which air quality and the presence of other pathogens influence the severity of disease. NPAR is primarily caused by strains of B. bronchiseptica that adhere to nasal cilia and tonsillar epithelium, and produce a toxin that causes mucosal edema, loss of cilia, and resorption of turbinate bone. Infection is acquired by inhalation of infected aerosol droplets.\n\nProgressive atrophic rhinitis is caused by cytotoxin-producing strains of P. multocida type D or, less commonly, type A. Infection is acquired by inhalation following direct contact with infected pigs. Colonization of the nasal mucosa and tonsil is inefficient, but augmented by factors that harm the nasal mucosa, including B. bronchiseptica infection, ammonia, and dusts. The cytotoxin, also referred to as dermonecrotic toxin, is a secreted, heat-labile toxin encoded by the toxA gene. Intranasal or intramuscular administration of P. multocida cytotoxin has similar effects on the nasal turbinates, including epithelial hyperplasia, glandular atrophy, resorption of turbinate bone by osteoclasts, reduced formation of bone by osteoblasts, and fibroblast proliferation. The cytotoxin does not directly affect to in-contact pigs when groups are assembled in weaner or grower-finisher units.\n\nClinical disease is not an inevitable consequence of infection with M. hyopneumoniae. Rather, its development is highly dependent on other predisposing factors, including crowding, poor air quality, fluctuations in temperature or humidity, and the presence of other pathogens. Many infections are subclinical, and carrier animals are important sources of infection of naive herds. Primary M. hyopneumoniae infection is not expected to be fatal, but reduced mucociliary clearance and possibly impaired macrophage function may lead to fatal bacterial pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens such as Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus suis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, or Haemophilus spp. The interaction of PRRSV with M. hyopneumoniae is particularly noteworthy. Mycoplasmal infection exacerbates the severity and the duration of PRRS, although the effect of PRRSV infection on mycoplasmal pneumonia is apparently minor. As a result, new infections with M. hyopneumoniae may cause outbreaks of PRRS in herds with previously subclinical PRSSV infections.\n\nThe characteristic gross feature of mycoplasmal pneumonia is red-tan-gray discoloration, collapse, and rubbery firmness affecting cranioventral regions of the lungs in a lobular pattern (Fig. 5-52 ). Lesions often affect cranial and middle lung lobes, accessory lobe, and cranioventral portions of the caudal lobes. The mildest lesions resemble atelectasis, with a lobular pattern of reddening and collapse. More severe lesions evolve from dark red through gray-pink to more homogeneous gray as the lesion ages. The rubbery or thymus-like texture of the lung contrasts with the more firm or hard consistency of Pasteurella pneumonia, although this is often present concurrently. The cut surface of affected lung is edematous, and catarrhal exudate can be squeezed from bronchi. The bronchiolar orientation of the inflammation often results in a regular pattern of tiny gray foci against a red background. M. hyopneumoniae rarely causes serofibrinous pleuritis or polyserositis, but this is more commonly due to opportunistic bacteria or M. hyorhinis. Pulmonary lymph nodes are enlarged and on cut surface are moist, usually bulging, and sometimes hyperemic.\n\nHistologically, subacute to chronic mycoplasmal pneumonia in swine is typified by lymphocytic infiltrates around airways, increased numbers of alveolar macrophages, and alveolar edema. In the fully developed mycoplasmal pneumonia, there is extensive lymphoid hyperplasia around bronchi, bronchioles, and their associated vessels; and lymphocytes infiltrate the lamina propria of the airway mucosa (see Fig. 5-52) . The epithelium is often histologically normal or mildly hyperplastic. Although ciliary loss and exfoliation of ciliated epithelium may occur, this is difficult to detect by light microscopy. Goblet cells in the airway mucosa are increased in number, and the bronchial glands are hyperplastic, reflecting the excessive mucus secretions seen grossly. The alveolar exudate consists predominantly of macrophages and protein-rich edema, but variable numbers of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils are present. The alveolar septa are mildly thickened by lymphocytes and a few plasma cells.\n\nExperimental studies of the pathogenesis of mycoplasmal pneumonia indicate that typical gross lesions do not occur until 2-4 weeks after infection. The rate of development of lesions is dependent on the dose and strain of M. hyopneumoniae, method of administration, and susceptibility of the pigs exposed. Young pigs naturally exposed to infectious aerosols soon after birth can develop lesions by the time they are genomic rearrangement through homologous recombination. Many mycoplasmas have highly specific host and tissue tropism, and are commonly commensals on mucosal surfaces. Nevertheless, spread of infection through the blood with subsequent localization in joints or serosal surfaces is a feature of some mycoplasmoses. Most mycoplasmal pathogens of the respiratory tract adhere to ciliated epithelium, mediated in some species by a specialized attachment organelle. A few mycoplasmas invade host cells, but this has not been demonstrated for mycoplasmal pathogens of animals.\n\nHigh-frequency variation of surface antigens allows several mycoplasmas to evade the humoral immune response by changing their surface lipoprotein antigens as antibodies against these structures are formed. The mechanisms by which Mycoplasma infections result in disease remain poorly characterized. Mycoplasmas have not been shown to secrete exotoxins. Pathogenic mechanisms of respiratory disease include ciliostasis resulting from membrane alterations, alteration of host prostaglandin synthesis, biofilm formation, induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes or other host cells, non-antigenspecific stimulation of immune responses as a consequence of superantigens in the mycoplasmal plasma membrane.\n\nCitti C, Blanchard A. Mycoplasmas and their host: emerging and re-emerging minimal pathogens. Trends Microbiol 2013;21: 196-203.\n\nMycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the cause of mycoplasmal pneumonia of swine, often known as enzootic pneumonia. It is a common, chronic, usually nonfatal disease of young pigs. The disease may be endemic, or spread slowly but progressively through a facility over the course of weeks, and the morbidity rate may be as high as 70-100%. Although pigs as young as 5 weeks of age may develop disease, it is most important in grower-finisher pigs and may be a key component of fatal multifactorial pneumonia in 4-to 6-month-old hogs. Clinical expressions of the uncomplicated disease are coughing, unthriftiness, poor weight gain, and reduced feed conversion. Because there is usually low mortality associated with mycoplasmal pneumonia, the lesions are generally seen in slaughtered animals or those dying from other diseases. When deaths do occur, they are mainly due to superimposed infections with other bacteria.\n\nLike other mycoplasmal pathogens, M. hyopneumoniae is a tiny bacterium that lacks a cell wall. The agent adheres to ciliated epithelium of the large airways and, in lower number, of the bronchioles, using 97-and 145-kDa outer membrane proteins. Adherent organisms are closely associated with the cilia, and there is often extensive ciliary loss. In chronic infections, mycoplasmal antigen and nucleic acid are also present in alveolar and interstitial macrophages. The cell membranes of many mycoplasmas, presumably including M. hyopneumoniae, contain superantigens that induce polyclonal proliferation of lymphocytes and result in the characteristic aggregates of lymphocytes around airways and blood vessels. Infection with M. hyopneumoniae is mainly transmitted by direct contact with nasal secretions from infected pigs, although aerosol transmission over short distances may occur. A common clinical scenario involves infection of a few young pigs by contact with an infected sow, followed by slow spread neutrophils, and granulomatous infiltrates in lymph nodes suggest PCV-2 infection. Establishing a definitive diagnosis in swine herds with pneumonia often requires laboratory support. M. hyopneumoniae is fastidious in its growth requirements, and isolation in culture is not a useful method of diagnosis. More sensitive confirmation of a morphologic diagnosis can be obtained by identifying antigen in lesional lung tissue by immunohistochemistry, or detection of M. hyopneumoniae DNA by PCR using lung tissue, nasal swabs, or transtracheal washes. Detection of serum antibody by ELISA is a useful method of confirming prior exposure, or validating the M. hyopneumoniae-free status of minimal-disease herds. Kwon D, et \n\nPneumocystis carinii. Pneumocystis carinii is a sporadic cause of acute or chronic dyspnea, usually without fever, in pigs, foals, dogs, and other domestic animals. Outbreaks of respiratory disease in pigs have been associated with Pneumocystis infection, but it is uncertain whether Pneumocystis was the primary cause of respiratory disease. Clinical disease caused by Pneumocystis is thought to be unlikely without underlying immunosuppression; identified causes include corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy; severe combined immunodeficiency in foals, sometimes in association with adenovirus or Rhodococcus infection; common variable immunodeficiency of Miniature Dachshunds, demodicosis, or canine distemper in dogs; and perhaps PRRSV or PCV-2 infection in pigs. Nonetheless, the recent finding that Pneumocystis causes transient disease in immunocompetent rats, and persistent infection in immunodeficient rats, should motivate its reconsideration as a primary pathogen.\n\nPneumocystis is a fungus, in the class Pneumocystidomycetes. Isolates from different host species should be considered distinct species or subspecies; P. jiroveci causes disease in humans, but there is little evidence that isolates from animals (P. carinii) are of zoonotic importance. The life cycle is based only on morphologic evaluation, but involves a 1-4 \u00b5m diameter, thin-walled, uninucleate, trophic form that replicates by binary fission; and a 5-8 \u00b5m diameter, thick-walled, multinucleate cyst form that develops 8 intracystic bodies, which may be daughter forms that are products of sexual replication. The latter are released, attach to type I pneumocytes, and presumably develop into trophic forms. The cell wall is composed of mannose-rich polysaccharides and the major surface glycoprotein. This glycoprotein A is the immunodominant antigen and mediates binding of Pneumocystis to type I pneumocytes and macrophages, surfactant proteins, and fibronectin. Both macrophages and cell-mediated immune responses are essential 3-5 weeks of age. In the first week after experimental infection, neutrophils are present in airway lumens and, to a lesser extent, in alveoli. The numbers of neutrophils diminish and lymphoid cells increase over the subsequent several weeks to reach the fully developed stage of consolidation. After it has reached its peak some 5-6 weeks after infection, lesions of uncomplicated mycoplasmal pneumonia may either persist or completely resolve within 2 months.\n\nThe gross lesions of gray-tan discoloration and thymus-like texture are quite characteristic. However, many fatal cases are secondarily infected by opportunistic bacteria, resulting in red, firm or hard, cranioventral consolidation that appears identical to the bacterial pneumonia that complicates PRRSV, PCV-2, or influenza. Similarly, the well-developed histologic lesions with thick peribronchial cuffs of lymphocytes are highly suggestive, yet lymphoplasmacytic peribronchiolitis-usually milder-is also often present in chronic PRRSV, influenza, or PCV-2 pneumonia. In these cases, other histologic features can suggest a tentative diagnosis: M. hyopneumoniae also induces alveolar edema and increased numbers of plump alveolar macrophages, PRRSV results in diffuse lymphocytic infiltrates in alveolar septa, influenza virus and some PCV-2 infections are accompanied in the acute stages by bronchiolar necrosis and \n\nFurther reading Calsamiglia M, et al tured using conventional techniques. PCR assays are a more sensitive method of detection than histopathology, in rats. Henderson KS, et \n\nMetastrongylus apri (elongatus), M. pudendotectus, and M. salmi (family Protostrongylidae) are all parasitic in the bronchi and bronchioles of pigs. Because the intermediate host is the earthworm, pulmonary metastrongylosis is now rare in housed swine, but it is common in wild boar. They are believed to be responsible for the occasional transmission of influenza A virus. The adult worms are white, threadlike, and 14-60 mm in length . In heavy infections, which are mostly in young pigs, they may be found in all lobes of the lung. When there are fewer worms, particularly as occurs in older animals, the worms may be restricted to airways along the caudoventral borders of the caudal lobes. In histologic sections, the adults have polymyarian-coelomyarian musculature, cuboidal multinucleated intestinal epithelium with an indistinct microvillus layer, and thick-shelled eggs or embryonated eggs in the uterus (see eFigs. 5-77, 5-78). Eggs are laid in the bronchi, and a few of them hatch there, but most hatch after passing to the exterior in the feces. First-stage larvae are inactive and are capable of prolonged survival in moist conditions. Their further development depends on ingestion by earthworms, which are the intermediate hosts. The larvae develop to the third, infective stage in about 10 days, and then remain quiescent unless the earthworm is eaten by a pig. The larvae may survive for as long as 18 months in the earthworms and, by that time, thousands may be accumulated by a single worm. Migration within the pig is through the lymphatics from the intestine to the lungs. Some larvae pass through the liver and produce focal hepatitis. Even with heavy adult infestations, gross lesions are inconspicuous. The worms live in the smallest airways, and on superficial examination of the lungs, the presence of the parasites is frequently only indicated by gray-pink nodules l-3 mm in diameter and by hyperinflated lobules along the caudoventral margins of the caudal lobes. Histologically, the lesions are similar to those produced by Dictyocaulus spp. The initial lesions are multiple foci of intense accumulations of eosinophils surrounding larvae in alveoli. Subsequently, when reproduction is active, an eosinophilic and granulomatous response occurs to the eggs and larvae in the alveoli. The prepatent period for Metastrongylus spp. is about 25 days, after which the rate of egg production rapidly reaches a peak and then subsides to a low level. At this later stage, the adults persist mainly in the bronchioles, and small bronchi and provoke goblet cell hyperplasia and exudation of mucus, eosinophils, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells. The bronchiolar epithelium is mildly hyperplastic, and eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells permeate the lamina propria.\n\nAscaris suum is an intestinal nematode in swine. The female worms have tremendous biotic potential, producing for controlling Pneumocystis; hence clinical disease implies that there has been impairment of macrophage function or cell-mediated immune responses. In addition to the spaceoccupying effect of the fungus, Pneumocystis may alter lung function by interfering with surfactant homeostasis.\n\nGross lesions of Pneumocystis pneumonia are diffuse or patchy, red to yellow-brown regions of rubbery firmness or consolidation. The characteristic histologic finding is foamy or \"honeycomb\" material filling alveoli, caused by the presence of numerous intracellular and extracellular, 8-\u00b5m diameter, round or crescent-shaped, clear fungal bodies, each containing one or more 0.5-\u00b5m diameter, lightly basophilic bodies (Fig.  5-53) . Foamy macrophages are present and contain the organisms, but the presence of lymphocytes, plasma cells, type II pneumocytes, and interstitial fibrosis is variable. The diagnosis is made by identifying the fungi in histologic sections. They are easily overlooked on H&E-stained sections, but the wall of the cyst forms stains with methenamine silver or PAS. It is notable that immunocompetent rats develop lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia with perivascular cuffs of lymphocytes but few Pneumocystis cysts, whereas immunodeficient rats develop a similar lesion with many cysts. Pneumocystis cannot be cul- infected cells and prominent basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies. Replication of cytomegaloviruses is slower than that of alphaherpesviruses, and disease is more chronic. As the immune response is generally effective, disease caused by cytomegalovirus occurs principally in immunodeficient or immunosuppressed animals.\n\nInfectious bovine rhinotracheitis. Infection with bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus) is widespread in cattle populations, but the disease infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) is uncommon in areas where vaccination is practiced. IBR in feedlot calves causes an abrupt onset of fever, anorexia, tachypnea, mucopurulent nasal discharge, and dyspnea or open-mouth breathing. The nasal mucosa and muzzle are often hyperemic, suggesting the epithet \"red nose,\" and white, loosely adherent plaques may peel from the surface. The mortality rate is low unless secondary bacterial pneumonia develops.\n\nBovine alphaherpesvirus infections cause infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, keratoconjunctivitis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, abortion, encephalitis, systemic herpesvirus infection in young calves, and pustular vulvovaginitis or balanoposthitis. The factors that determine the manifestation are not fully understood, but include the following: route of infection (genital infection usually manifests as vulvovaginitis or balanoposthitis), strain of the virus (a distinct virus type, BoHV-5, is the usual cause of herpesviral encephalitis in calves), and degree of immunity (systemic herpesviral infection develops in young calves with low serum antibody titers to the virus).\n\nBoHV-1 has a large 136-kb genome encoding 67 proteins; 12 envelope glycoproteins have been described. The glycoproteins gC and gD bind cell surface receptors, allowing virus entry into the cell by gB, gH, and gL. Fusion of cells, mediated by gB and gD, allows intercellular spread of virus and evasion of the immune response, and is the molecular basis of the epithelial syncytia that are occasionally noted histologically. The gC glycoprotein binds C3 component of complement and prevents complement activation, whereas gI and gE are Fc receptors for immunoglobulin that impair antibody-mediated neutralization of the virus.\n\nBoHV-1 infects a wide range of animals, including cattle, sheep, goats, llamas, swine, water buffalo, mustelids, and rabbits, but primary viral respiratory disease is only described in cattle. Sources of BoHV-1 infection include clinically or subclinically infected cattle, and reactivation of latent infections. Wild ruminants may be subclinical reservoirs. Infection is transmitted by aerosol; direct contact with nasal, ocular, or vaginal secretions; or by indirect contact with fomites, semen, feed, or water. Systemic spread of the virus is a feature of the syndromes of systemic infection, abortion, and encephalitis. Viremia is not usually evident in cases of IBR, keratoconjunctivitis, vulvovaginitis, or balanoposthitis, although monocyteor lymphocyte-associated viremia may occur at low level. In the latter conditions, virus spreads along mucosal epithelium, nerves, and lymphatics. Latent infection of trigeminal or other sensory ganglia is common, and follows axonal spread of infection rather than viremia. In latently infected neurons, viral DNA is present but, with the exception of a few \"latencyassociated transcripts,\" viral RNA or protein cannot be detected. Stress, administration of glucocorticoids or epinephrine, hyperthermia, or hypothermia trigger reactivation of the latent infection, and virus reaches the mucosal surface by anterograde axonal transport, where mucosal replication leads to shedding of infectious virus. Reactivated infections are numerous eggs that are passed in the feces. Consumption of large numbers of embryonated eggs or ingestion of infected paratenic hosts (usually earthworms) may result in the synchronous migration of huge numbers of larvae, which can occasionally be fatal. The lesion is acute, diffuse, eosinophilic, interstitial lung disease associated with the presence of large numbers of larvae. Characteristic morphologic features of the larvae are the lateral alae, prominent lateral chords, and uninucleate intestinal epithelial cells .\n\nRare parasitisms of the respiratory tract of pigs include Paragonimus spp. and hydatid disease. Gass\u00f3 D, et \n\nGeneral features of herpesviruses. Herpesviruses are 120-200 nm diameter, and composed of an icosahedral nucleocapsid surrounded by a proteinaceous tegument and an outer envelope. Herpesviruses have large genomes composed of double-stranded DNA. Viral infection of cells induces a highly regulated cascade of viral gene expression: preformed tegument proteins and the products of immediate-early and early genes regulate the host transcriptional machinery and viral gene expression, and late genes encode structural proteins of the virus. Viral glycoproteins often form peplomers that project from the surface of the envelope; in addition to being key targets of protective immune responses, these envelope glycoproteins mediate viral entry into target cells, cellular fusion to form syncytia, and spread of virus between cells without exposure to extracellular antibody. Some envelope glycoproteins act as complement C3b or immunoglobulin Fc receptors, and several herpesviruses encode chemokine or chemokine receptor homologues that modulate the immunoinflammatory response. Viral replication occurs in the nucleus, and virions acquire an envelope by budding through the nuclear membrane. Lysis of the cell releases the mature virions to the extracellular space.\n\nHerpesviruses are classified into Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaherpesvirinae subfamilies. The alphaherpesviruses are characterized by rapid growth in cell culture, lytic infection of cells, necrotizing lesions, the formation of syncytia in some instances, eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies, latent infections, and narrow or broad host ranges. Most alphaherpesviruses establish latent infections in neurons of the trigeminal ganglia and other sensory ganglia, as well as other sites, such as olfactory bulb, optic nerve, nasal turbinate, and cornea. During latent infection, the so-called latency-associated transcripts are the only evidence of viral gene expression; these have been used as markers of latent infection. Alphaherpesviruses affecting the lung of domestic mammals include bovine herpesvirus 1 (infectious bovine rhinotracheitis), caprine herpesvirus 1, suid herpesvirus 1 (pseudorabies), equid herpesviruses 1 and 4 (equine abortion, equine viral rhinopneumonitis), canid herpesvirus 1, and felid herpesvirus 1 (feline viral rhinotracheitis).\n\nThe betaherpesviruses, including suid herpesvirus 2 (porcine cytomegalovirus), have a limited host range, and these cytomegaloviruses induce pathologic enlargement of 537.e1 eFigure 5-79 Ascaris suum larval migration in a pig. Eosinophils infiltrate a bronchiole, which has epithelial thinning in one area and hyperplasia in another. the exudate reveals a shiny intact mucosal surface. In severe cases, obstruction of the laryngeal or tracheal lumen by abundant exudate may prove fatal. Emphysema is a sequel to dyspnea in severely affected calves.\n\nThe earliest histologic lesions, in the first 2 days after infection, include cytoplasmic vacuolation and pallor, and nuclear pyknosis or karyolysis. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies are present in the epithelium of the nasal turbinates, tracheobronchial glands, and bronchial epithelium, but are rare in the tracheal surface epithelium. Inclusions are absent in most diagnostic cases, and the lesions at these later times include erosion or ulceration of nasal and tracheal mucosa, with necrosis and exfoliation of infected epithelial cells and exudation of neutrophils and fibrin. Neutrophils and mononuclear cells infiltrate the lamina propria. Mild perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes may be detected in the trigeminal ganglion and brainstem.\n\nBronchointerstitial pneumonia may develop, with erosion of bronchiolar epithelium and proliferation of type II pneumocytes. Primary viral pneumonia occurs in young calves without significant upper respiratory lesions and without evidence of bacterial pneumonia. These calves may have epithelial syncytia in alveoli, and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies are more common than is seen in IBR.\n\nSystemic lesions of BoHV-1 infection in young calves <2 months of age include multiple, coalescing, 1-7 mm diameter, sharply demarcated foci of necrosis in the upper digestive tract, including the oral cavity, esophagus, and rumen. Necrotic foci are often covered by adherent debris and ingesta, which appears as caseous clumps of curdled milk. Multifocal, pinpoint to 1-mm diameter, white foci of necrosis are often present in the liver, and occasionally in kidney and spleen. The nasopharynx and larynx may contain erosive and exudative lesions, but tracheal and pulmonary lesions are not typical. Histologically, eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies are usually apparent at the margins of the necrotic lesions. The lesions of herpesviral abortion are described in Vol. 3, Female genital system.\n\nThe gross appearance of IBR is highly suggestive of the causative agent. A casual observer may mistake loosely adherent expectorated material for the tracheal ulceration of IBR. Bovine parainfluenza virus 3 can cause nasal erosions, but aspiration or inhalation of chemical irritants, which is rarely encountered, is the only process likely to be confused with florid lesions of IBR. However, as subclinical BoHV-1 infection impairs pulmonary defenses, laboratory investigation to demonstrate this pathogen is often warranted in calves with bacterial pneumonia. The virus grows readily in cell culture and produces characteristic cytopathic effects. Thus virus isolation from nasal swabs, nasal mucosa, trachea, or lung is an excellent means of definitive diagnosis, and has the advantage that novel strains may be identified and archived. PCR tests and immunohistochemistry are advantageous when a rapid diagnosis is needed. An important caveat is warranted when identifying BoHV-1 infection in the absence of characteristic lesions. Cattle with other diseases experience stress-induced reactivation of latent herpesviral infections, leading to identification of the reactivated virus in any of these diagnostic assays. Samples should be obtained early in the course of disease, as antibody in the exudate of subacute lesions may preclude isolation of the virus and block antigen-antibody interactions in antigenbased assays. Detection of seroconversion is useful to associate BoHV-1 infection with clinical disease. usually subclinical, but may act as a source of contagion to naive, in-contact animals.\n\nInfection of the respiratory tract induces clinical disease after an incubation period of 2-6 days, and virus is shed in nasal secretions for at least 10-16 days. Clinical IBR results from lytic infection of nasal and airway epithelial cells. Functional abnormalities such as serotonin-or dopamine-induced bronchoconstriction may also contribute to clinical signs. Secondary bacterial pneumonia in calves with IBR is a consequence of the destruction of ciliated epithelium by lytic viral infection, and impairment of the ability of alveolar macrophages to phagocytose bacteria and secrete neutrophil chemotactic factors. These impairments of lung defenses are maximal at 4-5 days after viral infection.\n\nInterferon-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 secretion is detectable within 5 hours of BoHV-1 infections, and peaks at 36-72 hours. These interferons mediate innate resistance to spread of the infection, in part by recruiting macrophages and natural killer cells to the sites of viral infection. Cell-mediated immune responses are detectable in the respiratory tract within 5 days of infection, and mediate lysis of virus-infected cells. Neutralizing IgG is first detected at 10 days after infection, and IgA responses develop later. Antibody prevents disease in calves exposed to the virus. In infected calves, antibody neutralizes free virus and may prevent mucosal shedding of virus following reactivation of latent infection. However, because the virus evades the humoral immune response by spreading locally from cell to cell, a combination of cellular and humoral immunity is probably necessary for recovery from infection.\n\nGross lesions of IBR are usually restricted to the nasal cavity, larynx, and trachea. Pustules erupt early after infection, but are fragile and rarely observed. Petechiae, a granular appearance of the mucosa, and serous exudate may be present in acute lesions. More commonly, there is intense hyperemia of the mucosal tissue, multifocal to coalescing erosions with loosely adherent plaques of white debris, or diffuse ulceration covered by a fibrinonecrotic membrane (Fig. 5-54 ). When the exudate is peeled from the surface of the trachea or nasal cavity, dull granular eroded tissue remains. In contrast, in cases of bacterial pneumonia in which expectorated material accumulates on the tracheal or nasal mucosa, gentle removal of does not replicate in lymphocytes in vitro. Following experimental infection of naive calves, viral shedding was first detected on the second day after infection, was maximal at about 4 days, and was absent by 7-10 days after infection. This transient infection is consistent with the difficulty experienced in demonstrating virus in naturally occurring subacute or chronic cases.\n\nInteractions with other agents contribute to the severity of disease. Experimental BRSV infections result in more severe disease if calves are also infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus or exposed to 3-methylindole. BRSV is an important predisposing factor in the development of bacterial bronchopneumonia in cattle, because the virus impairs alveolar macrophage function, reduces mucociliary clearance, and may enhance proteolysis to facilitate bacterial invasion of the blood.\n\nCalves with BRSV develop specific serum and mucosal antibody responses; however, most antibody is directed to the F and N proteins and is non-neutralizing, and serum titers are poorly correlated with protection from disease. Similarly, passively acquired colostral antibodies do not prevent disease. Although virus-neutralizing antibody is produced during infection, the role of humoral immunity in protection from disease requires further investigation. As for many viral infections, CD8+ T-lymphocyte responses may be important in recovery of calves following BRSV infection.\n\nThe role of the immune response in enhancing disease is controversial. It has been proposed that vaccination with inactive virus promotes a type 2 immune response in which antiviral IgE exacerbates the disease. Further, the biphasic clinical course, noted in some but not all natural cases, has been interpreted to represent a worsening of the disease as an immune response develops. Such comparisons have been used as a model to study human RSV infection, where children vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated vaccine developed more severe and prolonged disease course than nonvaccinates. However, attempts to reproduce this phenomenon in cattle have given conflicting results, and vaccinated calves developed milder disease than nonvaccinates in several studies. Similarly, it has been proposed that virus-or immune-complex-induced activation of complement or production of IgE may contribute to bronchoconstriction or pulmonary lesions in calves infected with BRSV, but the significance of complement activation and IgE responses in infected calves remains uncertain.\n\nGross lesions in lungs of calves with naturally occurring BRSV pneumonia often differ in cranioventral and caudodorsal areas of lung. The cranioventral lung is atelectatic, deep red or mottled, and rubbery ( Fig. 5-55 ). In contrast, the caudodorsal areas are voluminous because they fail to collapse, and are edematous, heavy, and firmer than normal. Variations in these gross lesions occur commonly: First, occasional cases have a generalized rubbery texture and red discoloration, with no difference between cranial and caudal lung; second, calves that die in respiratory distress may develop marked subpleural and interlobular emphysema with formation of bullae; and third, the raised, consolidated, firm to hard lesions of bronchopneumonia may obscure the aforementioned viral lesions in cases with secondary bacterial infection. Apart from hypertrophy and edema of bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes, lesions in other organs are usually not noted. Chronic cases of viral pneumonia with bronchiolitis obliterans, including those caused by BRSV, may die of heart failure caused by pulmonary Bovine respiratory syncytial virus. Infection with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is common in North American and European beef and dairy herds. Seroprevalence studies suggest that about half of range calves in North America are exposed to BRSV, and most non-exposed calves seroconvert within a month of entering feedlots. The seroprevalence of BRSV in adult cattle varies from 40-95%. BRSV is an important cause of both acute outbreaks of respiratory disease and \"enzootic pneumonia\" in 2-week-old to 5-monthold dairy and beef calves, with a peak incidence at 1-3 months of age. BRSV certainly causes fatal bronchointerstitial pneumonia soon after arrival in beef feedlots, but rarely causes acute interstitial lung disease in the late feeding period. Finally, BRSV predisposes to bacterial pneumonia in feedlot beef cattle by impairing lung defenses, and occasionally causes respiratory disease in naive adult dairy cows.\n\nThe disease is most prevalent in the autumn or early winter. Clinical signs in calves and cows are similar and include high fever, coughing, tachypnea, and variable nasal discharge and conjunctivitis. Some animals develop dyspnea with openmouth breathing and increased abdominal effort. Calves often maintain a reasonable appetite in the face of severe respiratory distress, in contrast to the consistent depression of cattle with bacterial pneumonia. A biphasic clinical course is not present in all cases; when present, it is characterized by transient pyrexia and mild respiratory disease, temporary improvement for days to weeks, then rapid onset of severe respiratory distress.\n\nBRSV, a member of the genus Pneumovirus in the family Paramyxoviridae, is pleomorphic, spherical or irregularly shaped, enveloped, 80-450 nm diameter, and contains negative-sense single-stranded RNA. The viral genome encodes 10 proteins, including the G glycoprotein, which mediates attachment of viral particles to host cells; the F protein, which induces fusion of infected cells; matrix proteins (M, M2, or 22 K); nucleocapsid protein (N); phosphoprotein (P); polymerase (L); small hydrophobic protein (SH); and nonstructural proteins (NS1[1C] and NS2[1B]). Subgroups of BRSV have been defined by antigenic and nucleotide differences of the G and F proteins, but their clinical significance is uncertain.\n\nAn understanding of the pathogenesis of BRSV pneumonia has been hindered by the difficulty of establishing experimental infections that are representative of naturally occurring disease. In general, experimentally infected calves develop less severe clinical disease and less extensive lesions than natural cases, in part because in vitro passage of the virus in cell culture rapidly attenuates virulence. As a result, descriptions of the pathogenesis of experimental infections are not necessarily representative of natural disease. Airborne spread, probably by aerosol, is the common route of infection. Clinical signs are observed from 2-7 days after experimental infection. In natural cases, viral infection is restricted to the respiratory tract, and viral antigen is most abundant in bronchiolar epithelium of the cranioventral areas of lung. Alveolar type II pneumocytes and macrophages express lesser amounts of viral antigen, and infrequent virus-infected cells are present in nasal, tracheal, and bronchial epithelium. The virus infects but hypertension, as a result of hypoxic vasoconstriction. Lesions in these animals include hypertrophy of the right ventricle of the heart, subcutaneous edema, and ascites.\n\nThe histologic hallmarks of pneumonia caused by BRSV are bronchointerstitial pneumonia with formation of bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial syncytia. The lesions and the presence of viral antigen are most obvious in the cranioventral areas of lung. In the acute lesions, from 1-8 days after infection, bronchioles are lined by flattened epithelium, bronchiolar lumens contain necrotic epithelial cells and modest numbers of neutrophils, and lymphocytes infiltrate around bronchioles. Alveoli contain neutrophils and macrophages, and alveolar septa may be mildly thickened by mononuclear cells, but hyaline membranes are infrequent. Syncytia are prominent in the early stage, and appear as multinucleated cells closely associated with the bronchiolar or alveoli epithelium (see . Sloughed multinucleated cells with pyknotic nuclei are often more numerous than those within the epithelial layer. Alveolar syncytia may closely resemble the multinucleated macrophages that clear fibrin from alveoli in cases of fibrinous pneumonia, so the presence of bronchiolar syncytia is a more reliable indicator of viral infection. Intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies are occasionally present in syncytial cells and uncommonly in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium (eFig. 5-81).\n\nThe subacute lesions of BRSV infection, beginning at about 8 days after infection, represent early repair of the above lesions following lymphocyte-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells. The bronchiolar epithelium becomes hyperplastic (see Fig. 5 -55, eFig. 5-81), and there is disappearance of syncytial cells as viral antigen is cleared. Proliferation of type II pneumocytes appears as scattered \"tombstone-like\" cells or complete cuboidal epithelialization of the alveoli. Lymphocytes and plasma cells encircle bronchioles and blood vessels and thicken alveolar septa, and are most numerous 10 days after infection. Bronchiolitis obliterans may occur as early as 10 days after infection, forming polyps of fibrous tissue covered by epithelium that partially occlude bronchiolar lumens. Medial hypertrophy of pulmonary arterioles may be prominent in calves that develop pulmonary hypertension secondary to bronchiolitis obliterans.\n\nThe histologic lesions of necrotizing bronchiolitis with syncytial cells should be highly suggestive of BRSV infection, but 2 caveats should be considered. First, bovine parainfluenza virus 3 infection may also induce the formation of syncytia with intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Second, alveolar multinucleated macrophages are a common finding in fibrinous bronchopneumonia, and probably represent an attempt to remove the fibrinous alveolar exudate . This can present a diagnostic dilemma, because many calves with BRSV develop secondary bacterial pneumonia. Thus if alveolar but not bronchiolar multinucleated cells are present, a diagnosis of BRSV infection is not indicated unless ancillary laboratory tests support the diagnosis. Finally, when syncytia are absent, the lesions resemble those caused by other viruses, and laboratory testing is needed for diagnosis.\n\nVarious assays are available to confirm BRSV infection. Lesional cranioventral areas of lung are the most profitable sites to detect virus; viral antigen or nucleic acid is less frequent in caudodorsal lung tissue. Virus isolation is not recommended for routine diagnostic use, because the development of an immune response interferes with virus isolation, and the virus is easily inactivated by transport conditions. Quantitative cell-mediated immune responses, which are probably important for clearance of virus-infected cells, are maximal at 6-9 days after infection. The gross lesions in natural cases of primary BPIV-3 pneumonia are usually mild, and consist of a cranioventral or generalized, lobular pattern of gray-red discoloration, firm, or rubbery texture, and mild swelling or atelectasis of lung tissue. In calves that die in respiratory distress, there may be emphysema of the caudal lung lobes. Bronchiolitis and mild bronchitis are the major histologic lesions in natural cases of primary uncomplicated BPIV-3 pneumonia. Epithelial cells lining small bronchioles are rounded, occasionally vacuolated, and slough into the lumen, and the epithelial layer may be discontinuous, attenuated, or hyperplastic. In the acute stages, many bronchial, bronchiolar, and alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages contain prominent eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. In experimentally infected calves, inclusions are most numerous from 2 to 4 days after infection, and less common from 5 to 12 days. Epithelial syncytial cells may be present in alveoli, but are fewer than in bovine respiratory syncytial virus infection. Airways contain low numbers of neutrophils, and lymphocytes infiltrate the mildly edematous bronchiolar walls. Alveoli are atelectatic, edematous, and contain increased numbers of macrophages and neutrophils, and may have proliferation of type II pneumocytes. Fibroblasts and macrophages begin to organize the bronchiolar exudate at 7-12 days after experimental infections, and bronchiolitis obliterans may develop thereafter.\n\nThese diagnostic methods are effective in acute cases (<9-12 days after infection), but may be unrewarding in the more common presentation of chronic bacterial pneumonia with concurrent bronchiolar necrosis or bronchiolitis obliterans. Definitive diagnosis in these cases may be impossible, because viral antigen may be cleared long before the bacterial pneumonia proves fatal. If acute and convalescent sera are available, then demonstration of a rising antibody titer by using the hemagglutination inhibition assay supports the histologic diagnosis. Bovine coronavirus. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is an important cause of enteric disease in young calves, and the same strains occasionally induce respiratory disease in calves 2-16 weeks of age. BCoV is a less frequent but nonetheless important cause of respiratory disease in calves, and deserves more attention than it has received in the past. Isolates from occurrences of respiratory and diarrheic diseases have similar genotypes, and a single outbreak may include both forms of disease. Respiratory signs include fever, serous nasal discharge, sneezing, and coughing. The virus replicates primarily in the nasal and tracheal epithelium, and occasionally in the lung.\n\nMany calves shed BCoV in their nasal secretions and/or seroconvert to BCoV in the first month after arrival in feedlots, but the association between seroconversion or virus RT-PCR assays are ideal and more sensitive than immunohistochemistry. Nevertheless, identification of viral antigen by immunohistochemistry or antigen detection by ELISA is also useful and cost effective. Cattle vaccinated with intranasal modified live-virus vaccines have detectable viral nucleic acid for 10 days, and up to 20 days in some calves. Thus positive RT-PCR tests in this time interval may not indicate the true cause of the respiratory disease. Gershwin \n\nClinical findings in uncomplicated primary BPIV-3 infection include transient fever, nasal discharge, sporadic coughing, mild depression, and increased respiratory rate. The virus causes occasional outbreaks of nasal disease in mature cows, with nasal erosions, fibrinous casts, epistaxis, and submandibular edema. Seroconversion to BPIV-3 commonly occurs during periods of temperature fluctuations in the autumn, in association with shipping fever of feedlot calves, and with enzootic pneumonia of dairy calves. The prevalence of positive serum titers to BPIV-3 varies from 2-67% on arrival in feedlots, but 23-91% of animals seroconvert within a month after arrival. There is a variable association between seroconversion to BPIV-3 and development of pneumonia, and BPIV-3 is one of the viruses that predisposes to shipping fever.\n\nBPIV-3 is a member of the genus Respirovirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. Paramyxoviruses are pleomorphic, 150-200 nm diameter, and contain negative-sense single-stranded RNA. Structural proteins include hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein (HN), fusion glycoprotein (F), high-molecularweight protein (L), a phosphoprotein (P), nucleocapsid protein (NP), and matrix protein (M). The HN protein mediates viral attachment to and release from infected cells, and the F protein allows penetration and spread of the virus between infected cells. Both the HN and F proteins are necessary for formation of syncytia and virulence. Two distinct BPIV-3 genotypes occur: BPIV-3a and BPIV-3b.\n\nBPIV-3 infects ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract, alveolar macrophages, type II pneumocytes, and lymphocytes. The virus reduces pulmonary defenses by several mechanisms. Injury to ciliated epithelium results in functional and structural impairment of mucociliary clearance, alveolar macrophages from infected calves have reduced capacity for phagocytosis and oxidative killing of bacteria, and infected alveolar macrophages induce contact-mediated suppression of lymphocyte responses.\n\nThe HN and F proteins are immunodominant antigens, and serum antibody titers to these antigens correlate with disease resistance. Serum antibody responses develop at 8 days after experimental infection and peak at ~12 days, and a strong anamnestic response occurs after later infections. Cytotoxic is more controversial. Epitheliotropic bovine adenoviruses are occasionally isolated from feedlot calves with bacterial pneumonia, and many calves seroconvert to a range of bovine adenovirus (BAdV) serotypes within 5 weeks of entering feedlots. Adenoviruses may predispose to bacterial pneumonia by injuring ciliated epithelium and, for some strains, by impairing alveolar macrophages. However, compared to the roles of stress and other viral infections, adenoviruses are probably minor contributors to bacterial pneumonia in feedlot cattle.\n\nCalves experimentally infected with BAdV generally develop only mild respiratory disease; the severity of primary adenoviral pneumonia is probably dependent on both the strain of the BAdV and the immune status of the calf. Experimentally infected calves developed lobular or patchy areas of atelectasis and reddening. Histologic lesions include proliferation of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium, lymphocytic infiltration of airway epithelium, formation of large basophilic intranuclear inclusions in airway epithelial cells, and exfoliation or necrosis of virus-infected cells. In well-developed cases, there is extensive bronchiolar necrosis, occlusion of bronchiolar lumens by sloughed epithelium, and inclusions in intact or sloughed epithelial cells. Thickening of alveolar septa by mononuclear cells may occur, but proliferation of type II pneumocytes is uncommon. Narita M, et Bovine rhinitis virus. Two bovine rhinitis viruses (BRAV, BRBV) are widespread in cattle populations, but are generally believed to be of little importance as a cause of respiratory disease in cattle. Virus isolation and serologic responses occasionally provide circumstantial evidence that it is involved in causing upper respiratory disease. Experimental infection has inconsistently induced bronchointerstitial pneumonia.\n\nRai DK, Rieder E. Homology modeling and analysis of structure predictions of the bovine rhinitis B virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Int J Mol Sci 2012;13:8998-9013.\n\nBacterial bronchopneumonia caused by Pasteurellaceae: Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Pasteurella multocida. Bacterial bronchopneumonia is a common and economically important disease of cattle, particularly in temperate climates, and is mainly caused by bacteria of the family Pasteurellaceae. The most important clinical entities are enzootic pneumonia of young calves and shipping fever of feedlot cattle, but bacterial pneumonia may occur in any age group, often as a complication of stress, viral infection, or inclement weather.\n\nShipping-fever pneumonia has long been considered the most economically important disease of beef cattle in temperate climates. Recent years have seen considerable advances in understanding of pathogenesis and preventive strategies, with the result that, although the disease remains prevalent, mortality rates are lower than in the past. The classic presentation of shipping fever is of pneumonia affecting multiple calves, 3 days to 3 weeks after being shipped from their farm of origin shedding and increased risk of respiratory disease has been variable in the studies reported. Bronchiolar necrosis is the typical lesion seen in BCoV-infected calves (eFig. 5-83). Bronchiolar syncytia have been described in feedlot calves with concurrent BCoV infection and bacterial pneumonia, but the contribution of other viruses, such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus, to these lesions is uncertain. BCoV may be demonstrated using immunohistochemistry or RT-PCR, or isolated using specific rectal tumor cell lines.\n\nEpidemiologic and experimental studies show that BVDV-infected calves do indeed have a heightened susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia, and respiratory signs may be the chief clinical complaint resulting from acute BVDV infections. Mechanisms by which BVDV predisposes to bacterial pneumonia include reduced antimicrobial protein production by virus-infected airway epithelial cells, reduced function of alveolar macrophages, and virus-induced neutropenia. BVDV has also been shown to exacerbate bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine herpesvirus 1 infections in experimental situations.\n\nIt has been proposed that some isolates of BVDV induce primary respiratory disease, independent of opportunistic bacterial pathogens. During primary BVDV infection, viral antigen is present in pulmonary alveolar macrophages and in airway epithelium . In addition, viral antigen may be demonstrated in the tunica muscularis of arterioles in the lung, heart, and occasionally in other tissues, often in association with lesions of lymphocytic arteritis. Calves or lambs challenged with certain isolates of BVDV develop fever and hyperpnea or, in other studies, nasal discharge and coughing. The lesions described are mild, consisting of peribronchiolar, perivascular, or interstitial aggregates of lymphocytes and macrophages, and/or mild suppurative exudate in bronchioles. However, other studies have found no lung lesions in calves infected with BVDV, and the importance of BVDV as a cause of primary lung disease is probably minimal. \n\nFurther reading Storz J, et fimbriae. All serotypes secrete leukotoxin, a member of the RTX (repeats in toxin) family of gram-negative bacterial toxins, during the logarithmic phase of growth. The gene products of lktA and lktC represent the active leukotoxin, whereas lktB and lktD are necessary for toxin secretion. At high concentrations, leukotoxin induces lysis of ruminant leukocytes and platelets, mediated by binding to CD18 on the leukocyte surface and formation of pores in the cell membrane. At lower concentrations, leukotoxin activates leukocytes and platelets. Although leukotoxin clearly plays a role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia, disease does develop in calves vaccinated against leukotoxin and in those challenged with M. haemolytica constructs that do not secrete leukotoxin.\n\nLipopolysaccharide is a major component of the cell wall, and the presence of O-polysaccharide side chains confers a smooth phenotype to most serotypes. Lipopolysaccharide from M. haemolytica stimulates alveolar macrophages to secrete inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and the chemokines IL-8, epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide (ENA), and growth-regulated oncogene-\u03b1 (GRO-\u03b1). Other effects of M. haemolytica lipopolysaccharide on alveolar macrophages include triggering of oxidative burst, an important bactericidal mechanism that may also lead to oxidative tissue injury; expression of tissue factor, a mediator of the thrombosis characteristic of the disease; and secretion of nitric oxide, which may augment lung defenses but is also a potent mediator of vasodilation and hypotension. Other effects of lipopolysaccharide include activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, and complement activation. The mannose-rich polysaccharide capsule confers resistance of M. haemolytica to phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils, and may also block complement-dependent killing. Neuraminidase enhances adhesion of bacteria to mucosal epithelium by cleaving sialic acid from the surface of epithelial cells, and may reduce mucus viscosity to prevent mucociliary clearance.\n\nLow numbers of M. haemolytica colonize the nasopharynx of normal calves, and there are several potential explanations for the shift from a commensal to a pathogenic relationship. First, stress or exposure to cold results in greater numbers of nasopharyngeal bacteria, so inhalation of droplets containing increased numbers of bacteria may overwhelm pulmonary defenses. The mechanisms whereby stress or exposure to cold induces expansion of the bacterial population, and whether these factors also alter expression of bacterial virulence factors, have not been defined. Second, some studies indicate that stress and cold exposure induce a shift from serotype 2 to the more pathogenic serotype 1. Third, viral infections or stress impair lung defenses. The lung is normally exposed to low numbers of aspirated M. haemolytica, but a combination of mucociliary clearance, antimicrobial function of secreted mucosal proteins, and phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages controls this infection without inciting an inflammatory response. Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 infect ciliated epithelium and reduce mucociliary clearance, and BoHV-1 and BRSV infect and impair the function of alveolar macrophages. In addition, BoHV-1 infection upregulates CD18 on the surface of bovine neutrophils, which, because CD18 is a receptor of M. haemolytica leukotoxin, makes these cells more susceptible to the leukotoxin. Viral infections may also impair secretion of antimicrobial proteins to a feedlot. Affected animals exhibit acute onset of depression, pyrexia, anorexia, rapid and shallow respiration, and mucopurulent nasal discharge. Coughing is variably present, and dyspnea develops in later stages. Most cattle respond rapidly to appropriate antibiotic therapy if given early in the course of disease, but relapses are common. Most reports of shipping fever describe 15-45% morbidity, 1-5% mortality, and case fatality rates of 5-10%, depending on the rapidity with which treatment is initiated. Risk factors for shipping fever include those associated with (1) increased exposure of naive calves to animals shedding viral pathogens, such as mixing of calves from various sources; (2) stress, such as weaning, transport, crowding, disruption of social groups, deprivation of feed and water, handling, vaccination, dehorning, and pregnancy checking; (3) metabolic acidosis, such as rapid introduction to grain or corn silage; and (4) exposure of calves to adverse environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature and humidity, cool weather in the autumn months, snow or rain, or dusty environment.\n\nBacterial pneumonia is also common in 1-to 4-month-old dairy and veal calves, and less common in suckling beef calves. Although commonly referred to as \"enzootic pneumonia,\" cases may be sporadic, enzootic, or occur in outbreaks. Affected calves are febrile, hyperpneic, variably dyspneic, depressed, and anorexic. Risk factors include those that (1) affect air quality, such as indoor housing, poor ventilation, high stocking density, high levels of airborne droplets or dust, and humid conditions; (2) reduce lung defenses, such as failure of passive transfer of immunoglobulin and high environmental ammonia concentrations; (3) expose calves to viral or mycoplasmal pathogens, such as housing calves and adults together; and (4) cause stress, such as concurrent diseases.\n\nPasteurellaceae are gram-negative coccobacilli; several members of the family are common causes of pneumonia or septicemia in domestic animals. Many species of Pasteurellaceae inhabit the upper respiratory tract of healthy animals, but cause pneumonia when pulmonary defenses are impaired, or cause septicemia in naive animals or those with reduced systemic defenses. In general, the defense against many Pasteurellaceae depends on a combination of innate resistance mechanisms and acquired humoral immunity. The most common pathogenic Pasteurellaceae of domestic animals include Pasteurella multocida of swine, ruminants, and cats; Mannheimia haemolytica and Bibersteinia trehalosi of ruminants; Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and A. suis of swine; A. equuli of horses; Histophilus somni of cattle and sheep; and Haemophilus parasuis of swine.\n\nMannheimia haemolytica and Bibersteinia trehalosi: 12 serotypes of M. haemolytica are discerned based on soluble capsular polysaccharide antigens. Serotype names were maintained when the species P. haemolytica biotypes A and T were reclassified as M. haemolytica and B. trehalosi, respectively; as a result, serotypes 3, 4, 10, and 15 are represented only by B. trehalosi (discussed in Infectious respiratory diseases of sheep and goats). Serotype 2, and, to a lesser extent, serotype 1, is a sporadic isolate from the nasopharynx of healthy calves. Serotype 1 is the most common isolate from pneumonic lung, but other serotypes in addition to many untypable isolates regularly cause bovine pneumonia.\n\nVirulence factors of M. haemolytica include leukotoxin, lipopolysaccharide, a polysaccharide capsule, transferrin-binding proteins A and B, O-sialoglycoprotease, neuraminidase, IgG1specific protease, outer membrane proteins, adhesins, and experimental infection, detectable serum IgM by 5 days, and IgG by 7 days after infection. Animals that recover from disease or are vaccinated with live bacteria are immune to subsequent challenge, and serum antibody titers to leukotoxin, outer-membrane proteins, and capsule all correlate with resistance to naturally occurring disease. However, it is likely that an immune response to several antigens is necessary for protection, for the presence of antibody to individual antigens, including leukotoxin, capsular polysaccharide, lipopolysaccharide, or outer-membrane proteins, does not confer complete protection.\n\nHistophilus somni causes bronchopneumonia, pleuritis (see Fig. 5-45) or pericarditis, polyarthritis, and infectious thrombotic meningoencephalitis, although an individual animal is usually affected by only one of these conditions. The importance of H. somni as a cause of bovine pneumonia varies considerably between geographic regions. As with M. haemolytica, this pathogen uses a broad array of virulence factors. Resistance to serum-and complement-mediated killing is mediated by proteins that bind the Fc component of immunoglobulin, making these Fc receptors unavailable for complement activation. Lipo-oligosaccharide has many proinflammatory effects, analogous to lipopolysaccharide in other gram-negative bacteria. The lipo-oligosaccharide of diseaseassociated, but not commensal, isolates of H. somni undergoes structural and antigenic variation during the course of an experimental infection, and this variation may serve as a mechanism of immune evasion and resistance to complementmediated killing. Transferrin-and hemoglobin-binding proteins enable the bacteria to acquire iron for growth. H. somni binds to and induces apoptosis in endothelial cells in vitro, and although this effect may contribute to the vasculitis that is characteristic of H. somni septicemia, these processes are as yet poorly characterized. Immune-complex deposition is apparently not the cause of vasculitis. H. somni is considered a facultative intracellular pathogen as it survives within monocytes, yet both intracellular and extracellular bacteria are numerous in acute pneumonia, and biofilm formation is described. Finally, H. somni impairs the phagocytic function of neutrophils and macrophages, and induces degeneration of macrophages and apoptosis of neutrophils. Vasculitis in H. somni infection occurs by diverse mechanisms, including induction of an inflammatory response, apoptosis of endothelial cells, activation of platelets, and histamine production by the bacteria.\n\nPasteurella multocida is an important but less-studied cause of pneumonia in cattle. Capsular serotype A:3 is most commonly isolated from cases of pneumonia. As for M. haemolytica, the bacteria are carried in the nasopharynx of many clinically normal calves. Adhesins, an antiphagocytic capsule, neuraminidase, iron-binding proteins, and lipopolysaccharide are among the described virulence factors.\n\nThe gross lesions of acute fulminant shipping-fever pneumonia caused by M. haemolytica, H. somni, or P. multocida are not reliably distinguished and include cranioventral lobar or lobular fibrinous bronchopneumonia, foci of coagulative necrosis, and variable fibrinous pleuritis (Fig. 5-56) . Lesions are most severe in the cranial and middle lung lobes, but may also affect the caudal lung. Acute fulminant cases often exhibit lobar fibrinous pneumonia and pleuritis and may die with as little as 30% of the lung affected, because of systemic effects of the infection rather than failure of lung function. Lesions are often sharply demarcated from less affected areas of lung, are by airway or alveolar epithelium. The mechanisms whereby stress impairs innate pulmonary defenses are poorly defined. As a result of one or more of these processes, exposure of the lung to increased numbers of virulent M. haemolytica coincides with a reduction in pulmonary defenses, leading to increased colonization of the cranial lung lobes. The finding that outbreaks are often polymicrobial (with isolates of multiple Pasteurellaceae bacteria, including diverse genotypes of M. haemolytica) supports the notion that this disease results from failure of lung defenses, with colonization by opportunistic pathogens that are well equipped to evade the remaining defenses and incite disease.\n\nClinical disease is principally a consequence of the host response to infection of the lung with M. haemolytica, rather than a direct effect of bacterial toxins on lung tissue. Massive exudation of fibrin into alveoli is a prominent feature of severe pneumonia in cattle, and is mediated in part by a direct effect of lipopolysaccharide on endothelial cells, but also by macrophage-derived inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-\u03b1. Phagocytosis of M. haemolytica by alveolar macrophages is limited unless the bacteria are opsonized by antibody or complement; the significance of other opsonins, such as the collectins, remains speculative. Alveolar macrophages that have ingested M. haemolytica or been exposed to bacterial products secrete an array of neutrophil chemoattractants, including IL-8, ENA, GRO, platelet-activating factor, and leukotriene B 4 . Neutrophils migrate to the alveoli and terminal bronchioles within 3 hours of experimental challenge with M. haemolytica. Neutrophil migration to alveoli uses a \u03b2 2 integrin-independent mechanism, whereas neutrophil recruitment to airways is dependent on interactions between \u03b2 2 integrin and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ICAM-1. In contrast to most bacterial infections, in which neutrophils phagocytose and kill the offending bacteria, neutrophils recruited to the sites of established infection with M. haemolytica are probably lysed by the effects of leukotoxin. Thus this disease is characterized by massive recruitment of neutrophils that are ineffective in killing bacteria, but nonetheless exacerbate the severity of clinical disease. Infiltration of neutrophils and additional macrophages into alveoli is harmful in several ways. The physical presence of these cells precludes normal ventilation and gas exchange; oxygen radicals, nitric oxide derivatives, and proteinases secreted by leukocytes may injure pulmonary cells and the interstitial stroma; expression of tissue factor by activated alveolar or intravascular macrophages promotes fibrin formation in the alveolus and thrombosis of blood vessels in the alveolar septa; and both macrophages and neutrophils secrete chemoattractants that perpetuate the recruitment of additional leukocytes.\n\nFocal areas of coagulative necrosis are a characteristic feature of infection with M. haemolytica. Some represent infarcts caused by thrombosis of intralobular blood vessels, but leukocyte secretions might also cause direct lung injury. These foci of necrosis are encircled by a dense band of leukocytes, many of which are necrotic, and these leukocytes are in a state of intense activation featuring prominent gene expression of IL-8 and inducible nitric oxide synthetase. Profound depression and \"toxemia\" or sepsis are constant features of acute infection with M. haemolytica; although the basis for this systemic illness is unknown, TNF-\u03b1 in the plasma of some cases may be responsible.\n\nImmune responses to M. haemolytica occur rapidly following exposure, with alveolar IgM detectable by 48 hours after discolored purple-red and later tan-gray, and the filling of alveoli with fibrin bestows a firm or hard texture to the affected lung.\n\nThe cut section of the lung is purple-red, firm or hard, and moist. It is often not possible to express exudate from the transected airway, for the leukocytes are enmeshed in polymerized fibrin. Sharply demarcated, irregularly shaped, 0.5-5 cm diameter, pale, dry foci of coagulative necrosis are frequent in fulminant cases of M. haemolytica or H. somni infection, but are not expected with P. multocida (see Fig. 5-56) . Bronchi may contain catarrhal or suppurative material or hemorrhage, or may be free of exudate. Interlobular septa are distended with fibrinous or serofibrinous exudate, and this lends a marbled appearance to the cut surface. In the most severe cases, fibrin forms a lattice or mat over the pleural surface of affected lung lobes, and the pleural cavity may contain serofibrinous yellow fluid that clots when the chest is opened. Fibrinous pericarditis may accompany the pleuritis.\n\nNecrosis of laryngeal epithelium at the point of contact of the vocal folds is commonly identified in cattle with severe pneumonia, resulting from mucosal trauma induced by abrupt laryngeal closure in a dyspneic animal. Vasculitis resulting from H. somni bacteremia can cause a similar lesion.\n\nDifferentiation of acute from subacute lesions is challenging but important to determine whether early clinical recognition of ill animals was adequate. Indicators of peracute pneumonia include red-purple hemorrhagic and infarcted lobules, crisp texture of the cut section, abundant and loosely adherent pleural fibrin, and systemic petechiae (see Fig. 5-56) . Characteristics of subacute bronchopneumonia may include a lobular distribution of lesions (see Fig. 5 -36, eFig. 5-50), mottled tan-grey as well as red appearance, suppurative exudate that oozes from small bronchi when a cut section is compressed, purulent or catarrhal exudate on the mucosal surface of the large airways, and pleural adhesions. Mild subacute cases with atelectasis and rubbery consolidation may be difficult to distinguish from lesions of viral pneumonia.\n\nSequelae indicative of chronic disease include sequestra, bronchiectasis, abscesses, and fibrous pleural adhesions. Sequestra consist of a necrotic core of firm but friable tissue, sometimes surrounded by fluid or caseous exudate, enveloped in a capsule of fibrous tissue. Bronchiectasis manifests as dilated airways that are filled with purulent exudate and thickened by fibrous tissue (see Fig. 5-33) . The surrounding lung tissue is invariably atelectatic, and may be swollen because of persistent bronchopneumonia. Ectatic bronchi appear similar to abscesses, but bronchiectasis is typified by cylindrical tracts filled with pus, the occasional presence of cartilage remnants on gross or histologic examination, and communication with a bronchus. Lesions of bronchiectasis and abscesses are often secondarily colonized by Trueperella pyogenes or other opportunistic pathogens.\n\nThe histologic lesions of acute fulminant shipping-fever pneumonia caused by M. haemolytica or H. somni are characterized by fibrinous and suppurative bronchopneumonia with necrosis of leukocytes. Alveoli and small bronchioles are filled with variable proportions of neutrophils and macrophages, fibrin, edema fluid, erythrocytes, necrotic cellular debris, and aggregates of bacteria. Necrosis of intra-alveolar leukocytes with a fusiform streaming pattern of pale basophilic chromatin (termed \"oat cells\" for their resemblance to grains of oats) is a characteristic feature of infection with M. haemolytica (see Fig. 5-56) , where leukotoxin is the likely cause of the A Figure 5 -56 Peracute fibrinous bronchopneumonia in a feedlot calf. A. Characteristic lesions of a peracute bronchopneumonia: mats of loosely adherent fibrin on both visceral and parietal pleura (see the reflected ribs at the right), and red-purple discoloration and hard texture of affected lung tissue that cuts crisply with a knife. A thin line of ventilated pink tissue remains visible along the dorsal border of the lung. B. The cut section reveals irregularly shaped foci of coagulative necrosis typical of Mannheimia haemolytica infection, outlined by a white rim of leukocytes (arrows). C. Histologically, alveoli are filled with eosinophilic fibrin, and the necrotic leukocytes have streaming chromatin characteristic of \"oat cells.\" B C been described, and may be of use in antimicrobial-treated, autolysed, or archival tissues, or if fresh tissue is not available. Detection of serum antibody to M. haemolytica by using a bacterial agglutination assay, leukotoxin neutralization assay, or leukotoxin ELISA is a common research tool, but finds limited use in field investigations.\n\nHemorrhagic septicemia of cattle. Hemorrhagic septicemia of cattle is caused by Pasteurella multocida, and usually serotypes B:2 or E:2. Hemorrhagic septicemia is now limited largely to tropical countries of Asia and Africa, and in these regions is primarily a disease of buffalo and, to a lesser extent, cattle. Outbreaks in tropical climates occur particularly during the rainy season. In intervening periods, the organism is apparently maintained in the nasopharyngeal regions of carrier cattle or buffalo. The start of an outbreak depends on some stress disturbing the balance in a carrier animal. This results in extensive proliferation and dissemination of the organisms to susceptible contact animals.\n\nApproximately 10% of animals survive subclinical infections and become immune, but once clinical signs are apparent, the mortality is almost 100%, even with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. This, together with the immense proliferation of organisms in the clinical disease, suggests that bacterial toxins (particularly endotoxin) are important in causing death.\n\nHemorrhagic septicemia is a peracute disease, and many animals die without clinical signs. Less fulminant cases exhibit high fever and rapid prostration, with profuse drooling. The saliva and feces contain large numbers of bacteria. Petechial hemorrhages are present on the serous membranes and in various organs, especially the lungs and muscles. Severe endotoxemia may cause acute, fibrinohemorrhagic interstitial lung disease. Lymph nodes are swollen and hemorrhagic, and there neutrophil cell death. Leukocyte necrosis may also be present in H. somni infection, and this agent is capable of inducing apoptosis in neutrophils in vitro. The nature of the necrotic leukocytes has long evaded definitive identification, but it is likely that both neutrophils and macrophages are affected. Larger airways may contain suppurative exudate, but neutrophil infiltration of the mucosa is often absent.\n\nNecrosis and attenuation of bronchiolar epithelium, when present, should prompt a search for underlying viral infection. However, this lesion is present in some calves experimentally infected with H. somni or M. haemolytica, and may represent neutrophil-induced damage to the epithelium or a direct effect of H. somni. Thrombi commonly occlude arterioles, venules, and alveolar septal capillaries. Interlobular septa are distended with serofibrinous exudate, and septal lymphatics are often filled with fibrin. Sharply demarcated, irregularly shaped areas of coagulative necrosis are often apparent. In these, alveolar and bronchiolar lesions are as described above, but all cells within the lesions are necrotic, and karyolysis or karyorrhexis is prominent. A dense band of necrotic leukocytes encircles these foci of necrosis, and thrombi occasionally fill blood vessels at the edge of or within the lesions. Suppurative phlebitis with fibrinoid necrosis may occur in pneumonia caused by H. somni, but is only common in acute fulminant cases (eFig. 5-85).\n\nThe appearance of these lesions changes in later stages. Macrophages and multinucleated histiocytic cells encompass the alveolar masses of polymerized fibrin; removal of fibrin by these macrophages and by fibrinolysis presumably occurs in some nonfatal cases. Otherwise, alveolar fibrin is infiltrated by fibroblasts and replaced by connective tissue, visible by 5 days after infection, with 2 possible sequelae: incorporation of the re-epithelialized alveolar fibrous tissue into the alveolar septum to form a thickened alveolar septum and a \"recanalized\" alveolar lumen, or large expanses of pulmonary fibrosis. Chronic suppurative or lymphoplasmacytic bronchitis occurs regularly in calves with chronic pneumonia.\n\nLess fulminant cases tend to lack the fibrinous alveolar exudate, thrombosis, and interlobular fibrin that are typical of fulminant shipping-fever pneumonia. Rather, these lesions are dominated by exudation of neutrophils in alveoli and bronchioles, congestion of pulmonary vessels, but little other morphologic change in lung tissue.\n\nThe gross lesions of cranioventral bronchopneumonia are usually diagnostic. The swollen and hard nature of bacterial pneumonia aids in the differentiation from the atelectatic cranioventral lesions of bovine respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia. A histologic finding of suppurative bronchopneumonia implies a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia; the important challenge is to identify the underlying causes. Lesions of aspiration pneumonia may closely resemble bacterial pneumonia; however, necrosis of alveolar leukocytes is not expected, and focal or unilateral, necrotizing, and foul-smelling lesions containing histologically recognizable foreign material are more typical of aspiration. Differentiation of the foci of necrosis from those seen in Mycoplasma bovis pneumonia is discussed in the section on bovine mycoplasmal disease.\n\nThe use of aerobic and microaerophilic culture to identify the specific etiology is commonly successful unless animals have been medicated with antimicrobials. Subacute or chronic cases are often colonized by opportunistic bacteria, and the primary bacterial cause may no longer be present. Immunohistochemistry to identify M. haemolytica and H. somni has eFigure 5-85 Histophilus somni, with fibrinoid necrosis of a pulmonary artery, as well as fibrinous and suppurative bronchopneumonia. Bronchiolar necrosis is present, associated with bovine coronavirus coinfection.\n\nTuberculosis. Bovine tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium bovis, is a chronic disease characterized by caseating granulomas in lung, lymph nodes, and other organs. Control programs have minimized the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis in many developed countries. The disease is rare in Canada, the United States, and Australia, although infected wildlife reservoirs remain and cases continue to occur in domestic livestock. Most recent reports of bovine tuberculosis in the United States and Canada have occurred in farmed cervids or in localized geographic areas. In much of Europe, <0.4% of cattle herds are infected, but the prevalence is higher in Ireland, United Kingdom, Spain, and Italy. In contrast, bovine tuberculosis is endemic in New Zealand and many countries in Africa, Asia, Central and South America; 10-35% of herds are infected in many of these endemic areas.\n\nThe success of tuberculosis eradication schemes is complicated by wildlife reservoirs, which maintain infection and transmit disease to cattle. Wildlife reservoirs of M. bovis infection include European badgers (Meles meles) in Ireland and the United Kingdom, brush-tailed possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand, feral pigs in Spain, swamp buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in Australia's Northern Territory, Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and lechwe antelope (Kobus leche) in southern Africa, bison (Bison bison) in Wood Buffalo National Park in western Canada, and various species of deer in the United States and New Zealand. In contrast, dead-end or spill-over hosts, including goats, wart hogs, cats, mustelids, and humans, may be infected with M. bovis but do not maintain infection in an area and rarely transmit infection to cattle.\n\nMany mycobacteria persist in soil for prolonged periods, and the infectivity of M. bovis is likely maintained for several weeks in the environment. However, because oral infections require high doses of bacilli, the importance of environmental survival in the epidemiology of disease is likely limited.\n\nThe classic tubercle bacilli are M. tuberculosis (human) and M. bovis (bovine). Related species are M. avium, M. microti, and M. africanum. To avoid confusion, the term tuberculosis is limited to diseases caused by M. tuberculosis or M. bovis. Disease conditions caused by other \"nontuberculous\" mycobacteria are referred to as mycobacteriosis or atypical may be blood-stained fluid in the serous cavities. Acute gastroenteritis, which can be hemorrhagic, is often present. The spleen is not greatly enlarged, which is a point of differentiation from anthrax.\n\nThere is a subacute edematous form of hemorrhagic septicemia, in which edema of the throat is unusually pronounced. The whole head, tongue, brisket, or a limb may also be affected. The swellings are produced by copious, clotted, straw-colored exudate. Although these lesions are caused by hemorrhagic septicemia, death is caused by asphyxiation. Cilia-associated respiratory bacillus. Cilia-associated respiratory (CAR) bacillus (Helicobacter sp.) is a recognized cause of chronic respiratory disease in rats, mice, and rabbits. The bacilli interdigitate between cilia and induce lymphocytic bronchitis and bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, and lung abscesses. Morphologically similar bacteria have been observed in the tracheal epithelium of cattle, deer, swine, and cats. The bacteria are of similar length and diameter as the cilia, but are visualized with Warthin-Starry silver stains (Fig. 5-57 ). In calves, there is an association between the presence of CAR bacilli and the presence of lymphoid follicles in the airway wall, but it remains unknown if this is a causal relationship. Porcine CAR bacilli are apparently nonpathogenic, for they are present in pigs with and without respiratory disease, and experimentally infected pigs have not developed clinical signs or lesions. The major differential diagnosis is Bordetella bronchiseptica. \n\nHastie AT, et al. together with peptidoglycan (muramyl dipeptide), are responsible for most of the adjuvant activity of mycobacteria that facilitates recruitment of antigen-presenting cells. Increased glycolipid content of mycobacterial cell walls, acid-fastness, and the amount of trehalose dimycolate (cord factor) in the cell wall are associated with increased virulence. Other glycolipids (mycosides) form a barrier against lysosomal digestion and partly explain the ability of the organisms to survive after phagocytosis by macrophages; intracellular survival is also facilitated by preventing fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes. The differing effectiveness of such mechanisms determines the relative ability of various mycobacteria to resist intracellular degradation.\n\nTuberculoproteins are the other major category of immunoreactive substances in mycobacteria. They provide most of the antigenic determinants, but the adjuvant activity of the lipids and polysaccharides in the mycobacterial cell wall is needed for an animal to produce an immunologic response to these tuberculoproteins. Purified protein derivatives (PPD) from mycobacteria are capable of eliciting delayed-type hypersensitivity once the animal is sensitized, however, and this is the basis of intradermal skin testing. Both tuberculoproteins and the adjuvant lipids are present in infection, and the result is the development of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Humoral antibodies can be demonstrated by serologic techniques, but do not participate in the development of lesions or in the production of immunity. Cell-mediated responses are responsible for both aspects of the disease.\n\nThe method of transmission influences the spectrum of lesions of bovine tuberculosis. Inhalation of droplet nuclei or dust particles containing M. bovis is the most common route of infection and leads to infection of the upper and lower airways. Oral infection requires a greater dose of bacilli than airborne infection to cause disease, and elicits lesions in the gut and associated lymph nodes. Transplacental transmission is a sequel of endometrial tuberculosis, and leads to fetal lesions in hepatic and portal lymph nodes. Less common routes of infection include percutaneous inoculation and genital transmission.\n\nImportant concepts in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis include the ability of mycobacteria to survive within macrophages, and the role of cellular immune responses in inciting granulomatous inflammation and enhancing the ability of macrophages to kill bacilli. Most animals that are infected with M. bovis do not develop clinical disease. The outcome of infection depends on bacterial factors, including the dose and virulence of infecting bacteria, but also on host factors, including the state of immune competence and heritable resistance to tuberculosis. Heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been identified in cattle and in deer. In humans and mice, mycobacterial resistance is partly related to allelic variation in the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (Nramp) genes 1 and 2, which affect intracellular survival of pathogens by modifying lysosomal transport of divalent cations, including iron and manganese. Other forms of heritable resistance to M. bovis are unrelated to variation in Nramp genes.\n\nThere are several facets to immune-mediated control of tuberculosis, and most of this understanding is based on the study of M. tuberculosis infections in humans and laboratory animals. In the early phases of infection, bacilli are phagocytosed by macrophages and may be eliminated. Alternatively, infected macrophages may remain at the site of primary infection for prolonged periods before the disease progresses. An mycobacteriosis. Nontuberculous mycobacteria are widespread in soil and water. Examples include members of the M. avium complex as well as M. fortuitum and M. smegmatis. The >160 species of nontuberculous mycobacteria were once classified by the Runyon system, but this has been replaced by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These organisms typically cause disease in immunocompromised hosts, and the manifestations are cervical lymphadenitis, pulmonary lesions similar to tuberculosis, or cutaneous lesions associated with local penetration of organisms through wounds.\n\nThe 3 main species of tubercle bacilli, M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, and M. avium, occur most frequently in their respective hosts, but cross-infections do occur, and various other species of animals are affected.\n\n\u2022 Bovine tuberculosis refers mainly to disease in cattle caused by M. bovis, but the term is also used to describe the pathogenic effects of this bacterium in other hosts. The host range of M. bovis is broad, including cattle, deer, elk, bison, buffalo, goats, camels, llamas, swine, elephants, rhinoceros, dogs, foxes, cats, mink, badgers, and nonhuman and human primates. Natural disease is most common in cattle, cervids, humans, and swine. \u2022 M. avium causes mycobacteriosis chiefly in birds and is occasionally found in cattle, swine, horses, sheep, and monkeys. \u2022 M. tuberculosis is chiefly responsible for tuberculosis in humans, and occasionally infects pigs, captive monkeys, dogs, cats, cattle, and psittacine birds. \u2022 Human infections with M. bovis are well documented, but are much less common than M. tuberculosis. Immunosuppressed individuals, such as those with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), are at particular risk. Ingestion of milk from cows with mammary tuberculosis is a major route of infection in humans, typically inducing cervical lymphadenitis or other nonpulmonary forms of disease. This pattern of disease is of great historical importance as the impetus for identification of the tubercle bacillus and the subsequent pasteurization of milk, but infection from raw milk continues to occur in regions where bovine tuberculosis is common. Transmission from cattle to humans by aerosol or by contamination of cutaneous wounds also occurs, mainly in those in close contact with infected cattle. \u2022 Mycobacteria are nonmotile, nonspore-forming pleomorphic coccobacilli. They are gram-positive but almost unstainable by the simpler bacterial stains because of their high content of lipids. They are routinely stained with carbol-fuchsin, and then resist decoloration by inorganic acids. This property of acid-fastness of the stained bacilli depends on the amount and spatial arrangement of mycolic acids and their esters in the bacterial wall. They are also demonstrable by fluorescent dyes such as auramine. Sometimes, in cultures or in old lesions, the organisms have a beaded or granulated appearance. This beading is partly caused by the presence of lipid droplets within the bacteria and is an indication of an unfavorable environment for organisms in the postexponential growth phase.\n\nIn addition to the cell membrane and peptidoglycan layers found in other bacteria, the mycobacterial cell wall contains a large hydrophobic layer of mycolic acids, which bestows hydrophobicity on the cell wall, conferring environmental and antimicrobial resistance. The waxes and cell-wall glycolipids are important inducers of the initial macrophage response and, Tubercles or craterous ulcers in gut or mesenteric lymph nodes suggest an oral route of infection, or ingestion of infected sputum that has been coughed up from the lung. Generalized disease is less common but well described.\n\nIn respiratory infections, lesions are most common in retropharyngeal, tracheobronchial, and mediastinal lymph nodes, and less frequent in palatine tonsils and mandibular, parotid, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Lung lesions are detected in only 10-30% of cattle with gross lesions, and often affect the caudal lobes. Thus secondary lesions in lymph nodes may be easier to detect than primary lesions in the lung. The classic gross lesion is the tubercle: a circumscribed, often encapsulated, paleyellow or white focus of granulomatous inflammation, often with central caseous necrosis and/or mineralization (Fig. 5-58) . Larger lesions may contain liquefied or suppurative exudate and be mistaken for abscesses caused by pyogenic bacteria. initial innate immune response develops at this site of primary infection, as macrophages secrete cytokines-particularly tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and the C-C chemokinesthat recruit additional macrophages and lymphocytes to the site. Macrophages stimulated by exposure to mycobacteria secrete interleukin (IL-12), which skews the immune response to favor secretion of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and IL-2 by CD4+ T-helper-1 lymphocytes. These IFN-\u03b3-producing T-helper lymphocytes signal the development of cell-mediated immunity, first detected at 14-28 days after infection by positive tuberculin skin test reactions. The arrival of these antigenspecific lymphocytes is crucial for host defense, activating macrophages and thus allowing them to overcome the block in phagosome maturation, and upregulate production of bactericidal products, including reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates and lysosomal enzymes that kill intracellular bacilli. Activated macrophages appear epithelioid, with abundant cytoplasm and indistinct cell borders, or form multinucleated giant cells.\n\nThe cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 act synergistically to promote formation of the tuberculoid granuloma, a dynamic structure that prevents spread of infection to other sites in the lung, as well as animal-to-animal transmission, and represents a localized target for the immune response. An excessive tissuedamaging cell-mediated immune response is thought to kill heavily infected macrophages and form the caseous center of the granuloma. Matrix metalloproteinases released from activated macrophages are a likely cause of the characteristic cell necrosis and liquefaction of tissues in some lesions of tuberculosis. Bacilli within the caseous center may remain dormant for years, until immunosuppression caused by diseases, drugs, hormones, or malnutrition, or other unidentified factors disturb the balance between host and agent, allowing proliferation of the pathogen and reactivation of the disease.\n\nWhether the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction is beneficial or harmful to the host depends on the circumstances. On the one hand, the reaction to relatively small numbers of bacilli causes accelerated tubercle formation that enhances the killing of the organisms, and helps prevent reinfection or dissemination from the initial site of infection. On the other hand, the delayed-type hypersensitivity response to large amounts of mycobacterial antigen causes extensive cell necrosis and tissue destruction, which is seriously detrimental. Liquefaction, brought about by hydrolytic enzymes of macrophages and possibly neutrophils, is the most harmful response. The bacilli multiply extracellularly in the liquefied material and are available in large numbers for dissemination through cavities, vessels, and airways. In summary, the final determinants of the nature and intensity of lesions are the magnitude of the bacterial infection, the intensity and appropriateness of the immune response, and the modifying influences of the structure of the tissue involved.\n\nGross or histologic lesions are absent in the majority of cattle that react to tuberculin skin tests, and although M. bovis cannot be isolated from many of these cases, they are generally considered to be infected for the purposes of epidemiology and control. Thorough examination of lymph nodes throughout the body is necessary before declaring a carcass free of visible lesions, as gross lesions may be absent, few, or multiple. The distribution of lesions of bovine tuberculosis depends on the mode of transmission. In most cases, gross lesions are restricted to the respiratory tract and associated lymphoid tissues and suggest inhalation as the route of infection. A B C may be more rapid in cervids than cattle; deer shed larger numbers of bacilli, and the disease may be more likely to remain subclinical. These features suggest that deer are less able to contain M. bovis infections than cattle, although limited evidence indicates they are not more susceptible to infection.\n\nIn elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), red deer (C. elaphus elaphus), and fallow deer (Dama dama), fibrosis and giant cells are less evident than in cattle, the presence of mineralization is more variable, and importantly, suppurative inflammation may be prominent. Multifocal lesions of caseous necrosis or suppurative inflammation in the lungs and lymph nodes of cervids are commonly caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum infection, and it has been recommended that these lesions be carefully examined for acid-fast bacteria as a routine procedure. Occasional cases of tuberculosis in these species may have concentrically laminated caseous abscesses reminiscent of caseous lymphadenitis in sheep and goats. The lesions of tuberculosis in sika deer (C. nippon) are distinctive, consisting of nonencapsulated invasive accumulations of epithelioid macrophages and numerous irregularly shaped giant cells, few neutrophils, and minimal necrosis or mineralization.\n\nTuberculosis in horses is often alimentary, with lesions in retropharyngeal and mesenteric lymph nodes and intestine. Intestinal infection may cause localized ulcers or thickened mucosal lesions reminiscent of Johne's disease in cattle. Tubercles in horses are usually uniform, gray, smooth (lardaceous), with little caseation or mineralization but abundant fibrosis, and may resemble sarcomas. Tuberculosis in small ruminants is uncommon, and many cases have cavitary lesions with numerous bacilli. Tuberculosis in swine is often systemic, and the morphology depends on the infecting pathogen. Mycoplasma bovis produces caseous and mineralized tubercles similar to those that occur in cattle, and the lesions are often surrounded by a fibrous capsule. In the liver, there is a tendency for the caseous centers to liquefy. M. avium produces lesions that are proliferative in nature and consist of tuberculous granulation tissue resembling the lardaceous or sarcomatous lesions described in equine tuberculosis. The histologic appearance is of diffuse infiltration of macrophages, epithelioid cells, and Langhans' giant cells accompanied by extensive fibroplasia and numerous bacilli.\n\nTuberculosis in dogs and cats often appears as granulation tissue in which macrophages are scattered at random and giant cells are rare. Discrete tuberculous granulomas are uncommon, and composed principally of epithelioid cells surrounded by narrow zones of fibrous tissue in which there are scattered small collections of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Necrosis is often present in the centers of larger granulomas. Giant cells are rare. In cats, the presence of central necrosis and fairly small numbers of acid-fast bacilli helps to distinguish lesions of tuberculosis from those of feline leprosy. In dogs, intrabronchial dissemination within the lungs occurs quite rapidly and can lead to tuberculous bronchitis and bronchiolitis. Pleuritis or peritonitis often accompanies primary infections in the lungs or intestine, respectively, with diffuse or finely nodular pleural thickening by granulation tissue containing few macrophages and bacilli. Dogs are susceptible to M. tuberculosis, by contact with infected humans, and the lesions affect lung and cervicothoracic lymph nodes or may be disseminated.\n\nA thorough examination is the most sensitive method of detecting tuberculosis after death, as the likelihood of isolating M. bovis in culture is low if gross lesions are not detected. The differential Bacilli are released from expanding tubercles into the airways, and coughing up of infected sputum may spread the infection by ingestion to cause lesions in intestine or mesenteric lymph nodes, by adhesion to laryngeal or tracheal mucosa to incite ulcers or ulcerating tubercles, or by aspiration to seed secondary sites in the lung. Multiple, raised, yellow, 1-3 mm plaques on the mucosal surface of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx are early lesions following experimental intranasal infection. Erosion of pulmonary tubercles through the pleura may result in implantation of bacilli throughout the pleural cavity, with development of multiple granulomas on pleural surfaces. Lymphatic spread has been suggested as an alternative route of pleural infection.\n\nGeneralized lesions are reported in about 1% of animals with gross lesions of tuberculosis, and probably result from hematogenous dissemination of bacilli following erosion of the wall of a blood vessel by an expanding tubercle. Embolic lesions are most common in lung, and may involve lymph nodes, bone, liver, kidney, mammary gland, uterus, pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, and meninges. Lesions are rare in salivary gland, pancreas, spleen, brain, myocardium, or muscle. In some instances, presumably following substantial release of bacilli into the blood, the presence of innumerable tiny white foci justifies the term \"miliary tuberculosis.\" In contrast, other carcasses display generalized lesions that are variable in size and degree of caseation or fibrosis, and imply a less catastrophic but more prolonged bacteremia. Erosion through serosal or mucosal surfaces by expanding tubercles spreads the infection by implantation on pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, or meningeal surfaces, or along the airways, intestine, or urinary tract.\n\nHistologic features of the tubercle include (1) a central coagulum of caseous necrosis, consisting of eosinophilic homogeneous material with scant nuclear debris and a variable degree of mineralization; (2) a mantle of macrophages and Langhans-type multinucleated giant cells; (3) a capsule containing lymphocytes, clusters of neutrophils in some cases, and a rim of collagenous connective tissue in chronic lesions; and (4) acid-fast bacteria-often in very low number-within macrophages and giant cells of the mantle zone or extracellularly in the caseous core (see Fig. 5 -58). In experimentally infected cattle, the early lesions at 7 days after infection consist of intra-alveolar clusters of macrophages, necrotic neutrophils, giant cells containing neutrophil remnants, and acid-fast bacteria. At 14 days after infection, corresponding to the onset of lymphocyte proliferative responses, tubercles contain central aggregates of neutrophils surrounded by epithelioid macrophages. Necrosis in the center of the tubercles develops later, at 21-42 days after infection, and the first mineralized lesions are at 35-60 days. However, this progression is variable among granulomas, with significant heterogeneity in a single animal. The amount of fibrosis increases with time, and tends to be more prominent in individuals and species with greater resistance. The presence of neutrophils is highly variable, and their presence in large numbers is most common in cases with rapid multiplication of bacteria, numerous reactive lymphocytes, and easily distensible tissues.\n\nIn cervids, M. bovis causes a similar spectrum of lesions as in cattle, but several unique features are of note. As in cattle, lesions are most common in retropharyngeal lymph nodes, lungs, thoracic lymph nodes, and mesenteric lymph nodes. However, deer may develop superficial lymphadenitis and abscesses that drain to the skin surface. Disease progression Animal Health) listed disease, is an important barrier to global trade, and a production-limiting disease in Africa. The disease is present in much of Africa except the Mediterranean and southeast African countries, and has recently occurred in southern Europe, central and eastern Asia, and the Middle East. CBPP caused devastating epidemics in cattle populations in the 19th century, but sporadic disease is now more common in endemically infected countries practicing vaccination. When the agent is introduced into naive populations, the effects vary from insidiously spreading disease to spectacular mortality affecting up to 50% of the animals.\n\nThe clinical signs and mortality rates are highly variable, depending on the strain of the pathogen, the age of the animal (adults are more susceptible than young), and the presence of other diseases, crowding, or stressors. Peracute cases die without premonitory signs. Acutely ill animals are febrile, anorexic, and depressed, with profound loss of milk production, open-mouth rapid breathing, mucoid nasal discharge, and occasional coughing. Chronically affected animals may be clinically normal or have an intermittent cough and fever, yet shed the organism intermittently. Calves <6 months of age commonly develop polyarthritis affecting carpal and tarsal joints, rather than pneumonia.\n\nCBPP is caused by Mycoplasma mycoides ssp. mycoides small colony type, which is different from the large colony type that causes pleuritis and pneumonia in goats in many countries throughout the world. There is marked straindependent variation in virulence, and the pathogenicity apparently declines as in vivo passage of the organism occurs during an outbreak. Galactan in the mucus capsule is correlated with virulence, and induces necrosis, thrombosis, and inflammation. The host range includes cattle (Bos taurus), zebu (B. indicus), water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), bison, and yak, although cattle are most commonly affected by clinical disease. M. mycoides is an obligate pathogen that survives poorly in the environment, so transmission usually depends on close contact with animals shedding the bacteria. Transplacental infection may occur. The respiratory tract is the site of primary infection, and bacteremia develops secondarily. The incubation period varies from 5-200 days, but is typically 20-40 days.\n\nGross lesions are often unilateral and restricted to the caudal lung lobes. In the acute stages, there are mats of fibrin and fluid exudate covering the pleural surface. Interlobular septa are remarkably distended with serous fluid, and the lobules vary from normal to consolidated and red or yellowgray. The pattern of interlobular edema and lobular consolidation lends a characteristic marbled appearance to the lung. Focal areas of necrosis increase in size over time, and eventually develop into sequestra. Sequestrum formation and fibrous thickening of the pleura with adhesions to the ribs are typical of chronic CBPP. Pericarditis, peritonitis, and polysynovitis occur infrequently in adult cattle.\n\nHistologic examination of bronchioles and alveoli reveals serofibrinous or suppurative exudates with necrosis of neutrophils, and multifocal areas of coagulative necrosis in the lung parenchyma. Interlobular septa are expanded by edema and fibrin, and interlobular lymphatics contain fibrin. Thrombosis of arteries, veins, and lymphatics is common, and nonsuppurative arteritis may be evident. Vasculitis is central to the development of the necrotic lesions and sequestration of lung tissue.\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes Mannheimia haemolytica and Mycoplasma bovis. The unilateral lesions, caudal lobe diagnosis for granulomas of lung or lymph nodes includes cestode cysts; pyogranulomas caused by fungi, bacteria, or inhaled foreign material; bacterial abscesses; and neoplasms. Thus the presence of many eosinophils, lymphoid hyperplasia, or bacterial colonies should prompt a search for alternative causes.\n\nGross lesions of focal caseous lesions in lymph nodes or lung, or histologic detection of granulomas, particularly with central areas of necrosis and/or mineralization, should prompt an extensive and thorough search for the low numbers of acid-fast bacilli that are typically present. Finding few bacilli is more suggestive of bovine tuberculosis than of mycobacteriosis caused by M. avium. However, bacterial culture and PCR-based assays are necessary for definitive diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis, particularly if the diagnosis is likely to have a serious impact. Immunohistochemical identification of M. bovis has been described. This procedure is more sensitive than examining acid-fast-stained sections, in terms of number of animals detected, staining intensity, and ease of detection, but the antibodies in current use cross-react with other mycobacteria as well as some gram-positive bacteria and fungi. size variation. M. bovis seems to alter surface lipoprotein expression in response to binding of specific antibody, suggesting that rapid changes in surface antigen expression is a mechanism of evading the humoral immune response. In support of this hypothesis, although antibody titers develop 2-3 weeks after experimental infections, the cellular and humoral immune responses are not protective.\n\nAssessing the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Mycoplasma spp. is problematic, but several reports indicate that many isolates of M. bovis are resistant to antimicrobials commonly used in feedlot medicine, including \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, florfenicol, tilmicosin, oxytetracycline, and spectinomycin. The pathogenetic implications of this antimicrobial resistance are uncertain. However, one theory suggests that M. bovis may be one of several pathogens infecting calves as they enter the feedlot, but the ability of this bacterium to resist antimicrobials and evade the immune response leads to chronic disease that fails to respond to therapy.\n\nMany calves with lesions of M. bovis pneumonia are also infected with Mannheimia haemolytica, and there is epidemiologic and morphologic evidence that the lesions of M. bovis may evolve out of those of M. haemolytica. Most cases have concurrent infection with Mycoplasma arginini, suggesting possible synergy. The role of M. bovis in predisposing to bacterial pneumonia is uncertain, as M. bovis is reportedly less effective than Mycoplasma dispar at impairing ciliary function.\n\nThe gross appearance of M. bovis pneumonia may be indistinguishable from suppurative bronchopneumonia of other causes. There is cranioventral reddening and consolidation, scant fibrin may cover pleural surfaces, and bronchial lymph nodes are enlarged and diffusely white. However, the characteristic lesion is of caseonecrotic bronchopneumonia, in which the consolidated cranioventral lung contains raised, white, sharply demarcated, friable foci of caseous necrosis (Fig. 5-59) . These foci of necrosis are often 2-10 mm in diameter, but occasionally enlarge to many-centimeters diameter. The largest lesions may contain fluid pus rather than caseous exudate, presumably caused by secondary or concurrent bacterial infection. These foci of necrosis form sequestra in some cases (eFig. 5-86). Uncommonly, foci of necrosis and inflammation may be present in bronchial lymph nodes, and similar nodular masses are rarely encountered in the tracheal submucosa, along the dorsal tracheal ligament, or in other tissues.\n\nJoint lesions are present in ~50% of calves with M. bovis pneumonia, and the lesions may vary considerably within the same animal. Pneumonia is found in nearly all calves with M. bovis arthritis. Acute lesions consist of serofibrinous exudate within joint cavities and tendon sheaths, and the synovium is reddened and hyperplastic. Cartilage erosion is reported in experimental cases but is often absent in clinical material. Purulent or fibrinopurulent exudate is often florid in more established lesions. Foci of caseous necrosis, similar to those described in the lung, may be present in the synovium or joint capsule. Other joints have minimal lesions in the articular cavity, but extensive edema and foci of caseous necrosis in the tendon sheaths or the periarticular soft tissues.\n\nOther manifestations of M. bovis infection include fibrinous, purulent, or caseating otitis media in young calves, which may be associated with feeding of mastitic milk; decubital abscesses; and a proposed association with necrotizing myocarditis of the papillary muscle that resembles Histophilus somni myocarditis.\n\ninvolvement, prominent inflammation in interlobular septa, and frequent development of sequestra should suggest a diagnosis of CBPP, although the latter 2 features do occur in shipping fever caused by M. haemolytica. The lesions of M. bovis lack the extensive fibrinous exudates in interlobular septa and on the pleural surface seen in CBPP.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is based on culture on special media, which may take several weeks. Frozen samples of lesional lung, pleural fluids, and lymph nodes are optimal for isolation of the agent. Immunohistochemistry and the PCR assay are more rapid methods of diagnosis. Various serologic assays are useful for screening of herds, but not for individual diagnosis. Development of improved methods to detect subclinical carriers is an area of intensive research, as current serologic assays lack sensitivity. \n\nThe role of M. bovis as a cause of mastitis and of infertility of dairy cows is discussed elsewhere. The 2 principal manifestations of M. bovis in the respiratory system are as a component of enzootic pneumonia of young dairy and veal calves, and chronic pneumonia and polyarthritis in feedlot beef cattle. In contrast to the appearance of shipping fever, calves with lesions of M. bovis pneumonia or polyarthritis usually die or are euthanized in the second or third month after arrival. These calves have often had prolonged antimicrobial therapy for nonresponsive or relapsing respiratory disease, which is indistinguishable from shipping fever in the early stages. Calves may be lame and have swelling of one or more joints, and many calves exhibit both respiratory disease and lameness.\n\nThe prevalence of chronic pneumonia and polyarthritis is often low, although up to 30% of calves may be affected in exceptional cases. Nevertheless, because the diagnosis is only made on fatal cases, the true prevalence of the disease is unknown. In contrast, the prevalence of infection with M. bovis has been reported to vary from 20-70%, and most calves seroconvert to M. bovis during the first month in the feedlot. Bovine herpesvirus and bovine viral diarrhea virus are suggested to predispose to severe mycoplasmal disease, but this remains controversial.\n\nM. bovis may be carried and shed in the secretions of the respiratory tract, the genital tract, and the mammary gland. Infection of the respiratory tract probably occurs by direct contact with nasal secretions, or perhaps by inhalation of infected droplets. Contact with genital secretions or ingestion of infected milk may cause infection in neonatal calves. Infection may remain confined to the respiratory tract, or extend from the lung to cause bacteremia with subsequent infection of joints and other tissues.\n\nM. bovis is seemingly well equipped to evade the immune response. The bacterium induces apoptosis of bovine lymphocytes, suppresses the proliferative response of lymphocytes to mitogens, and impairs neutrophil activation. The bacterial surface is decorated with a family of highly immunogenic variable-surface lipoproteins, encoded by at least 13 vsp genes containing multiple repeat sequences, which undergo highfrequency phase variation (turning expression on and off) and\n\neFigure 5-86 Mycoplasma bovis, with necrosis and sequestrum formation within the lesion of bronchopneumonia (A, B).\n\nwithin the bronchiolar exudate. Lesser amounts of antigen are present at the apical surfaces of bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells, and within alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. Foci of necrosis or lymphoplasmacytic inflammation may be present in the liver, kidney, or other viscera.\n\nThe gross and histologic appearance of caseonecrotic bronchopneumonia is distinctive. The foci of necrosis caused by M. haemolytica or H. somni are irregular in shape, nonfriable, delineated by a white rim (see Fig. 5-56B) , retain the histologically visible tissue architecture (coagulative necrosis), and contain streaming necrotic leukocytes. In contrast, the lesions of M. bovis are usually circular and white throughout, and appear histologically as an eosinophilic coagulum exhibiting the ghostlike outlines of necrotic leukocytes (see Fig. 5-59B ). Larger foci with fluid pus rather than crumbly content may be appropriately termed abscesses if a fibrous capsule can be demonstrated, and M. bovis may be isolated along with other bacterial pathogens such as Trueperella pyogenes. Sequestra caused by M. bovis are indistinguishable from those caused by M. haemolytica or H. somni, unless typical foci of caseous necrosis are detected in the adjacent consolidated lung tissue.\n\nThe histologic lesions of suppurative bronchopneumonia are nonspecific, but the characteristic appearance of the foci of caseous necrosis suggests a diagnosis of M. bovis. The lesions originate in small bronchioles, alveoli, and alveolar septa. The mildest, and probably earliest, lesion consists of suppurative exudate within small bronchioles, in which leukocytes have a characteristic appearance. They are necrotic but retain their cellular outlines, and have hypereosinophilic cytoplasm and inapparent or fragmented nuclei (see Fig. 5-59 ). As the lesion progresses, there is erosion of bronchiolar epithelium, with expansion of the necrotic foci to incorporate peribronchiolar alveoli. Macrophages and lymphocytes infiltrate the margins, infrequent giant cells may be present, and immature fibrous tissue develops at the outermost edge of the lesion. Large lesions may contain coagulative necrosis in their centers, with retention of the alveolar and bronchiolar architecture of the dead parenchyma. Mineralization of the necrotic tissue is frequent. Lesions affecting bronchi may progress to bronchiectasis.\n\nUsing immunohistochemistry, mycoplasmal antigen is most abundant at the periphery of the foci of necrosis and \n\nMortierellosis. Acute fatal mycotic pneumonia is a sequel to placental infection with Mortierella wolfii, the most important cause of mycotic abortion of cattle in New Zealand. This condition has rarely been reported elsewhere. Acute fibrinonecrotic pneumonia occurs in infected cows within a few days of abortion or parturition, resulting from extensive hematogenous dissemination of fungi when the placenta detaches. In the acute disease, the lung is diffusely firm, edematous, and redyellow. Histologic lesions include serofibrinous and suppurative exudate in alveoli, with vascular necrosis, thrombosis, and coagulative ischemic necrosis of lung parenchyma. In the subacute and chronic disease, there is an embolic pattern of multifocal fibrinous and suppurative inflammation. Similar lesions may occur in the spleen. Fungal hyphae are present within the lesions, but may be inconspicuous in chronic lesions. The hyphae are periodic acid-Schiff positive, nonseptate, branching, and are 2-12 \u00b5m in diameter.\n\nOther fungi such as Aspergillus, Mucor, and Rhizopus are occasional opportunistic invaders of lung, and cause nodules of caseous necrosis or granulomatous inflammation. \n\nDictyocaulus viviparus. Dictyocaulus viviparus is a common and important cause of respiratory disease in cool, wet, seasonal climates. Primary infections, sometimes known as \"husk\" or \"hoose,\" cause disease in calves during their first grazing season, and occasionally affect mature animals that have not had sufficient exposure to develop immunity. Although clinical disease may develop within 3 weeks of access to infected pastures, it is most common late in the grazing season when calves have been at pasture for 3-5 months. Affected herds usually have high disease prevalence, and mortality rates are variable, depending on the degree of pasture contamination. A second manifestation, reinfection syndrome, occurs when partially immune adult cattle on endemically infected farms have access to pastures that are contaminated with large numbers of infective larvae. In these herds, there is a high prevalence of coughing, tachypnea, and depression about 2 weeks after exposure. Some animals develop fatal dyspnea without coughing.\n\nD. viviparus, the only adult nematode known to infect the lung of cattle, is a member of the superfamily Various techniques are available to confirm the tentative diagnosis of Mycoplasma bovis. It grows readily on Mycoplasma enrichment media, and is occasionally isolated on blood agar. However, many calves without apparent pneumonia are infected with M. bovis. Thus the diagnosis rests on identifying both infection with this agent and the presence of the characteristic lesions; immunohistochemistry is advantageous for correlating the location of mycoplasmal antigen with the characteristic lesions. Seroconversion occurs in many healthy calves in the first month after entering feedlots, making this assay of no value for diagnosis of disease.\n\nMycoplasma bovis causes particularly severe disease in farmed bison, with high morbidity and mortality. The lesions are of caseonecrotic bronchopneumonia, which may be unilateral, pleuropneumonia, polyarthritis, necrotic pharyngitis, endometritis and placentitis with vasculitis, or disseminated abscesses in multiple viscera and lymphoid tissues. Mycoplasma spp. attach to ciliated epithelial cells, on and between microvilli and covering the base of the cilia. The typical lesion is chronic catarrhal bronchitis and bronchiolitis with prominent lymphocytic cuffs around airways. Affected lungs contain patchy, cranioventral, purple-red foci of atelectasis. When secondarily infected by opportunistic bacterial pathogens, more confluent, meaty consolidation may also occur. Microscopically, accumulations of neutrophils and mucus are present in airway lumens, and there is increased prominence of goblet cells. Moderate infiltrates of lymphocytes and fewer plasma cells encircle the airways and accompanying blood vessels. Inflammation of alveoli adjacent to terminal bronchioles occurs in experimental infections in colostrum-deprived, specific-pathogen-free calves and can probably occur in heavy natural infection. Alveolar lesions are not specific, and include atelectasis, accumulation of neutrophils and alveolar macrophages with occasional lymphocytes and plasma cells, and mild hypercellularity of alveolar septa. As the infection becomes chronic, lymphocytic peribronchio-have been aspirated into the alveoli. At this stage, calves may exhibit chronic coughing, increased respiratory rate, and weight loss, or develop severe dyspnea and death. Adult worms, which are slender, white, and up to 8 cm long, are most numerous in the caudodorsal bronchi of the caudal lobes ( Fig. 5-60) . Infections may be missed if only the trachea and large cranial bronchi are examined, as many infestations are restricted to the small branches of the caudal bronchi. Patchy lobular atelectasis may be the only other gross finding in mild infestations. In more severe cases, there are wedge-shaped, red-gray, firm, depressed areas of consolidation at the caudal border of the caudal lung. Examination of a cut section may reveal similar areas of consolidation in much of the pulmonary tissue surrounding larger bronchi.\n\nHistologic lesions in patent infections include eosinophilic catarrhal bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and eosinophilic granulomatous alveolitis (see Fig. 5-60) . The bronchi and large bronchioles contain adult worms, eggs, and larvae mixed with mucus and numerous eosinophils. In histologic sections, adult worms have thick intestinal epithelium composed of a few multinucleated cells with indistinct microvilli, prominent lateral chords, and coelomyarian-polymyarian musculature, and the uterus may contain larvae or embryonated eggs. The airway mucosa contains infiltrates of eosinophils and mononuclear cells, the epithelium is necrotic or hyperplastic and contains increased numbers of goblet cells, and the peribronchial lymphoid tissue is expanded (eFig. 5-87). The accompanying alveolar lesions consist of atelectasis secondary to the obstructive bronchiolitis, and macrophages, giant cells, and lymphocytes encircling fragments of cuticle, aspirated eggs, or newly hatched larvae. It is complicated in some cases by bacterial bronchopneumonia. Alveolar septa are thickened by cellular infiltration, slight fibroplasia, and inconsistent proliferation of type II pneumocytes. At this stage, the infection may be diagnosed by gross observation of adult worms in the bronchi, examination of histologic sections of bronchi and alveoli, identification of all stages in wet mounts of airway mucus, identifying larvae in feces by the Baermann technique, and/or detection of antibodies in serum or milk by ELISA.\n\nDuring the period of recovery, adult worms are eliminated. However, gross lesions of consolidation may persist, and there is bronchiolitis obliterans, lymphocytic cuffs around bronchi, hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, and fibrosis of peribronchiolar alveoli. Establishing a firm diagnosis at this stage may be impossible, as adults are not present and the feces no longer contain larvae. The distribution of lesions in the caudal lung helps to differentiate chronic parasitism from mycoplasmosis, which usually affects the cranioventral areas of lung. Acutely fatal exacerbations of the disease during the period of recovery, when larvae and adults are no longer present, have been described. These cases may be impossible to differentiate from toxic interstitial lung disease, but acute exacerbation of a chronic illness is not typical of pulmonary toxicity.\n\nEmphysema may be a prominent gross lesion in severe cases of Dictyocaulus infection, and is probably a consequence of forced expiration, caused by severe dyspnea, in the presence of bronchiolar obstruction by exudate and bronchoconstriction. Cases in which emphysema is the major lesion may be mistaken for acute interstitial lung disease of toxic cause. This is particularly likely when the pulmonary damage is caused by massive invasion of larvae, and mature worms are not yet present for gross detection. Microscopic detection of larvae and immature worms usually provides the diagnosis.\n\nTrichostrongyloidea, family Dictyocaulidae. Adult lungworms inhabit the large bronchi. The eggs are embryonated when laid, and hatch rapidly. First-stage larvae are expelled from the lung by coughing, are swallowed, and then passed in the feces. Further development to infective third-stage larvae occurs on the ground over the next 5-7 days. Larval development is optimal in moist cool conditions; the larvae can develop at temperatures as low as 5\u00b0 C, and their viability is prolonged at these temperatures. The third-stage larvae are ingested by cattle, penetrate the wall of the intestine, and migrate via the lymphatics to the mesenteric lymph nodes. In the lymph nodes, they molt to form fourth-stage larvae, and then go by way of lymph and blood to enter the lungs about 7 days after infection. Some larvae accidentally take the portal route and are destroyed in the liver, or rarely enter the systemic circulation to cause intrauterine infections in the fetus. The final molt to the fifth-stage larvae occurs in the bronchioles, and adults develop in the larger airways. Eggs are first detectable in feces at 21-30 days after infection; the infection is usually patent for another 1-3 months. However, a few egg-laying adults may persist in some animals over the winter months, and serve as a source of pasture contamination in the following grazing season.\n\nThe clinical and pathologic manifestations of Dictyocaulus infestation are dependent on the stage of infection, the level of immunity of the host, and the number of invading larvae. The following description pertains to primary infections of naive animals; reinfection of partially immune cattle is discussed subsequently. Lesions differ in the prepatent period, the patent period, and the period of recovery. During the prepatent period, from 7-25 days after infection, the principal lesions are eosinophilic bronchiolitis and/or alveolitis with fibrin or hyaline membranes, in response to the presence of larvae in the alveoli and bronchioles. Clinical signs include coughing and tachypnea, and calves infected with many larvae may die at this stage. Where the larvae emerge from pulmonary capillaries, they cause microscopic foci of necrosis and fibrin exudation, with an alveolar infiltrate of eosinophils and fewer neutrophils, macrophages, and giant cells. Mononuclear cells thicken the alveolar walls, and hyaline membranes or hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes may occur. The larvae, some of them dead, can be found in the alveoli. When the number of larvae is large, the foci of acute interstitial pneumonia may be visible grossly as lobular or smaller foci that are slightly depressed, purple, and widely distributed throughout the lungs.\n\nBy about day 10, many of the larvae have reached the terminal bronchioles. Frothy fluid is present in the bronchi and, in very heavy infestations, there is edema, atelectasis, and/ or emphysema. Eosinophils invade the septal tissues in large numbers and pursue the larvae into the bronchioles. Most of the bronchioles contain plugs of exudate composed largely of eosinophils. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages are present in smaller numbers in both the lumens and walls of the bronchioles. The early bronchiolar epithelial response is of necrosis, sloughing and flattening of remaining cells, but subsequently hyperplasia and metaplasia occur. At this stage, adult worms are not present in the airways, but larvae are detectable histologically or in a smear of exudate harvested from the smallest airways.\n\nDuring the patent period, beginning 25 days after infection, the inflammatory response targets adult worms in the bronchi, and eggs and recently hatched first-stage larvae that \n\nThe typical lesions in the reinfection syndrome, in which partially immune adult cattle are infected with numerous larvae, are scattered, 2-4 mm diameter, gray nodules that often contain a green caseous center. The nodules represent dense accumulations of lymphocytes and plasma cells, encircling an eosinophilic and granulomatous response to a degenerating larva. As a result of this robust immunoinflammatory response, the larvae do not reach the large airways or develop into adults, and the infection does not usually achieve patency. Miscellaneous parasites. Ascaris suum larvae occasionally cause severe interstitial lung disease in calves housed where pigs were previously kept. In these situations, infective eggs are ingested, larvae hatch within 18 hours, and migrate to the lungs 5-13 days after infection. The lesions are of severe acute interstitial lung disease, in which the lungs are diffusely rubbery, wet, and heavy, and interlobular septa are distended with clear fluid. Migration of larvae through the liver may cause white streaks. Histologically, there is alveolar edema and hyaline membranes or type II pneumocyte proliferation, and numerous eosinophils infiltrate alveolar septa and exude into the alveoli (Fig. 5-61) . Larvae are readily identified in cases that die about a week after infection, but a diligent search may be required in calves that survive for 2-3 weeks after infection. Larvae cannot be consistently recovered from lung digests. The histologic appearance of the larvae is characteristic: They have lateral alae, large lateral chords, and an intestine (the only internal organ present) composed of few uninucleate cells.\n\nThe trematodes Fasciola gigantica and F. hepatica occasionally invade the lungs accidentally from the liver. Because they are large parasites that wander extensively, a small number in the lungs can produce extensive cavitations. Schistosoma nasalis causes nasal granulomas in India. In cattle, tally inoculated Mannheimia haemolytica, and adenoviruses are occasionally isolated from outbreaks of bacterial pneumonia in lambs. These findings suggest that adenoviral infection may predispose to development of bacterial pneumonia in some groups of lambs. Lesions in experimentally infected lambs are similar to those described for calves. A noteworthy feature of the lesions caused by at least one strain of OAdV is the enlargement of both nucleus and cytoplasm of inclusionbearing bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells, which could be mistaken for cytomegalovirus infection. Adenoviruses have been isolated from goats, but their role in causing disease appears minor. Cutlip RC, et al. Lesions Peste des petits ruminants. Peste-des-petits-ruminants virus (PPRV) (see Vol. 2, Alimentary system and peritoneum) is closely related to rinderpest virus in the genus Morbillivirus. Sheep and goats with PPR (\"ovine rinderpest\") commonly have clinical signs and lesions affecting the respiratory system, in addition to enteric lesions that resemble those of rinderpest. The gross lesions usually affect the cranioventral lobes of the lung, which are firm, reddened, and may have fibrinous exudate on the pleural surface. Nasal and tracheal erosions with a fibrinonecrotic membrane may be present. Histologic lesions are of bronchointerstitial pneumonia, and resemble the lesions of canine distemper, another morbillivirus. There is necrosis and attenuation of epithelial cells lining the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles; proliferation of type II pneumocytes; and formation of epithelial syncytia in the alveoli. Infected epithelial cells often contain eosinophilic inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. As the virus is difficult to isolate in culture, definitive diagnosis depends on immunohistochemistry, PCR, or serology. Kul O, et al. Natural lung is less common than liver as a site of hydatid cysts caused by Echinococcus granulosus.\n\nThe leeches Limnatis nilotica and L. africana are taken in while drinking and attach to the mucosa of the pharynx and nasopharynx. They suck large quantities of blood, and their presence induces localized edema that leads to dyspnea or asphyxiation. The nematodes Mammomonogamus (Syngamus) nasicola and M. ierei are found in the nasal passages of ruminants in tropical countries, and M. laryngeus causes lymphocytic polypoid hyperplasia in the pharynx and larynx of cattle in tropical Asia and South America. Marques SMT, et al. Mammomonogamus laryngeus (Railliet, 1899) infection in buffaloes in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Vet Parasitol 2005; 130:241-243 .\n\nOvine respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza viruses. Many aspects of the pathogenesis, lesions, and role of these viruses in predisposing to bacterial pneumonia are similar to those described for the bovine viruses. Ruminant respiratory syncytial viruses have been divided into bovine and ovine subgroups based on nucleotide and antigenic differences in the G protein. Sheep are susceptible to infection and disease with both ovine and bovine subgroups, and ovine strains infect cattle and deer. Sow FB, et al. Respiratory syncytial virus infection is associated with an altered innate immunity and a heightened pro-inflammatory response in the lungs of preterm lambs. Respir Res 2011;12:106.\n\nAdenovirus. Adenoviral infections are common in sheep, but primary adenoviral pneumonia is rare. Ovine adenovirus (OAdV) serotype 6 exacerbates disease caused by experimen- are more susceptible than others. Finally, the local tissue microenvironment affects viral replication and development of disease; for example, proinflammatory cytokines generated in response to concurrent infection with other pathogens augment lentiviral replication and hasten disease onset.\n\nTransmission of small ruminant lentiviruses through colostrum or milk is the major method of disease spread. Inhalation of nasal secretions following prolonged close contact, as occurs in confined animals in the winter months, is a recognized mode of horizontal transmission. In utero transmission occurs infrequently in sheep. The virus is shed in semen, but infection by coitus or artificial insemination has not been documented. Mucosal dendritic cells are thought to deliver virus to lymph nodes, where the mannose receptor is the likely route of entry into macrophages. Ovine lentivirus infects a variety of cell types, including choroid plexus and mammary epithelium, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and monocytes. However, viral replication is restricted in these cells, and complete viral replication and assembly occur in mature macrophages. Viral antigen is widespread, having been detected in lung, bone marrow, mammary gland, lymph node, spleen, synovium, brain, and spinal cord of sheep with maedi, and is most abundant in areas of lymphocytic inflammation. Similarly, viral nucleic acid is demonstrable in lung, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, brain, synovium, intestine, kidney, and thyroid gland of goats with CAE. Infected alveolar macrophages produce cytokines that recruit and activate leukocytes in the area of infection, and may also incite fibrosis and smooth muscle metaplasia. Cytokine-dependent activation of macrophages stimulates lentiviral replication, which may in turn stimulate additional leukocyte recruitment. Altered organ function is a result of the immunoinflammatory response, rather than a direct effect of the lentiviral infection.\n\nIn contrast to primate and feline lentiviruses, immunosuppression is not a feature of small ruminant lentiviral infection. Infection and shedding of the virus persist for life, but the disease in sheep develops slowly, and the incubation period usually exceeds 2 years. The mechanisms of persistent lentiviral infection are not clear, but may include proviral integration, lack of avidity of neutralizing antibody, or decoy viral antigens that are immunodominant but non-neutralizing. Integration of provirus into the host genome is necessary for viral replication, occurs increasingly as the disease progresses, and may facilitate persistence of the virus. The development of serum neutralizing antibody responses during persistent infection is perplexing; the higher affinity of virus for macrophage receptors than for antibody has been suggested as a reason for failure of these antibodies to prevent cell-to-cell spread of infection in vivo.\n\nThe lungs of sheep with maedi are remarkably heavy, pale gray or tan, and fail to collapse when the chest is opened (Fig.  5-62 ). The lesions are generalized but most obvious in the caudal lobes, and vary from a diffusely firm or rubbery texture, to multiple coalescing gray and firm foci. Mediastinal and bronchial lymph nodes are enlarged, white, and edematous. Lesions of cranioventral bronchopneumonia caused by Pasteurella multocida or Trueperella pyogenes are commonly superimposed on the lesions of maedi. Lungworms, Dictyocaulus or Protostrongylus, are common in sheep with maedi, and an association between maedi and retroviral pulmonary adenomatosis has been described.\n\nThe histologic pulmonary lesions are of interstitial pneumonia (eFig. 5-88; see Fig. 5-62) . Infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma Small ruminant lentiviruses: maedi (ovine progressive pneumonia) and caprine arthritis-encephalitis. Small ruminant lentiviral infections are common in sheep and goats worldwide, with the exceptions of Iceland, where the disease was eradicated in 1965, and Australia and New Zealand, where ovine lentiviral disease has not been recorded. The seroprevalence varies greatly, for example, from 1-70% in various areas of the United States. Most infected animals are not clinically ill, and infection may become widespread before diseased animals are noticed. Lentiviruses cause slowly progressive pneumonia, encephalomyelitis, arthritis, and mastitis; the various syndromes may occur independently or concurrently.\n\nThe descriptive terminology of the ovine disease is a colorful consequence of the history of the disease. The respiratory form in sheep, which is termed maedi (\"dyspnea\" in Icelandic) in much of the world and ovine progressive pneumonia in the United States, is the most common presentation, and manifests as inexorably progressive dyspnea, hyperpnea, and weight loss in sheep >3 years of age. Other outcomes in sheep are less frequent and include encephalitis, arthritis, and mastitis. Encephalitis-visna (\"fading away\" in Icelandic)was common in the original Icelandic description but is now less common, and results in ataxia, weakness, tremors, hypermetria, and profound weight loss. Mastitis and arthritis are uncommon in sheep, and manifest as agalactia and a hard udder, or lameness and swollen joints (particularly carpal joints), respectively.\n\nGoats with caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE) develop one or more of arthritis, encephalitis, and pneumonia. Arthritis affects adult goats, resulting in acute or chronic lameness and swelling of carpal or tarsal joints. Neurologic disease, occurring in 2-to 4-month-old kids, or less commonly in older animals, is characterized by progressive ataxia and weakness beginning in the hindlimbs. Pneumonia may occasionally be the major presenting complaint in kids or adults, or occur concurrently with arthritis or neurologic disease.\n\nMaedi-visna and CAE are caused by closely related lentiviruses in the family Retroviridae, genus Lentivirus. The extreme genetic diversity created by replicative infidelity of the lentiviruses has blurred the concept of distinct viral species: Some strains infect only sheep or only goats, whereas others are capable of cross-species infection, so the term small ruminant lentiviruses is generally more appropriate than maedi-visna virus or caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV). These viruses are enveloped, 100-nm diameter, and contain a dense nucleoid and a positive-sense singlestranded RNA genome. Viral genes include gag, which encodes group-specific nucleocapsid and matrix glycoproteins that are detected by antibody-based diagnostic tests; pol, which encodes reverse transcriptase and other enzymes; env, encoding the surface glycoprotein that mediates receptor binding and virus entry into cells, and is the target for neutralizing antibody; and the regulatory proteins encoded by vif, rev, and vpr-like. Long terminal repeats that flank the encoding regions of the genome bind transcription factors and are necessary for replication.\n\nLentiviral diseases in sheep and goats are marked by their variability. Viral strains or quasispecies may differ in their rapidity of replication, cytopathic effects, tropism for particular cell types, and their propensity to cause pulmonary, nervous, joint, or mammary disease. Disease manifestation is also influenced by host genetics, as certain breeds of sheep eFigure 5-88 Maedi-visna in a sheep. The bronchiole and blood vessels are encircled by lymphocytes and macrophages, and alveolar septa are thickened by smooth muscle, fibrosis, lymphocytes, and macrophages. A B C cells, and macrophages thicken alveolar septa and form cuffs around blood vessels and airways. The tendency for these cellular infiltrates to form lymphoid nodules with germinal centers is a characteristic feature of maedi. In addition to the cellular infiltrate, alveolar septa are thickened by hypertrophy of smooth muscle and by mild interstitial fibrosis. Hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes is not prominent, in contrast to pulmonary adenomatosis and CAE viral pneumonia. Mild hyperplasia of bronchiolar epithelium is occasionally present.\n\nBrain and spinal cord lesions of sheep with maedi-visna are mainly periventricular in the brain and affect white matter of spinal cord, and may be perivascular or infiltrative. The lesions consist of lymphocytic and/or histiocytic leukoencephalomyelitis, gliosis, demyelination leading to malacia, and meningitis, with mononuclear infiltrates forming lymphoid follicles in choroid plexus. Mastitis is an uncommon clinical presentation of maedi-visna, but is a frequent subclinical lesion. There is diffuse firmness and pallor of the mammary gland, and histologic lesions include follicular aggregates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages in the mammary interstitium. Mesangial or proliferative glomerulonephritis is an uncommon lesion in lentivirus-infected sheep.\n\nIn goats, the lung lesions of CAEV are distinctive. The gross appearance is of diffuse or multifocal pale firm lesions throughout the lung. Histologically, these foci are abruptly demarcated from relatively unaffected areas of lung. In the lesional areas, alveoli are filled with densely eosinophilic fluid containing foamy macrophages and lined by a continuous or patchy layer of cuboidal type II pneumocytes, and alveolar septa are thickened by lymphocytes and fibrosis .\n\nArthritis caused by CAEV is unilateral or bilateral, and affects the carpal joints or less commonly the tarsal, fetlock, stifle, and atlanto-occipital joints. Histologic lesions include striking villus hyperplasia of the synovium, and synovial infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. Fibrosis, mineralization, and necrosis of synovium and joint capsule develop in chronically affected animals. The brain and mammary lesions of CAE are similar to those of sheep with maedi.\n\nSerology (agar gel immunodiffusion [AGID] or ELISA) is useful to detect infected flocks but of less value for individualanimal diagnosis. For both serologic and molecular diagnostic tests, false positives can occur in preweaned lambs because of uptake of antibody and provirus from infected colostrum and milk. False-negative serologic tests can result from the delayed development of antibodies after infection, or transient periods of seronegativity. Quantitative PCR assays to detect proviral DNA or viral RNA in blood mononuclear cells or lung tissue may be positive earlier in the disease course than serologic assays. PCR assays are considered less sensitive than serology, but may be positive before development of an antibody titer. Depending on the specific PCR assay, genetic variability of the virus can cause false-negative tests. Immunohistochemistry, such as for detection of the p27 or gp130 viral proteins, has the advantage of associating the presence of viral antigen with the histologic lesion. Antigen is usually in macrophages within the inflammatory lesions. protrude from the nostril. Most cases are adenomas that expand into sinuses, contralateral nasal cavity, or pharynx; the term adenocarcinoma may be justified in those cases with demonstrable invasion of bone, but metastasis is not reported. The neoplastic tissue is white, firm, and multinodular, or may contain brown-red areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.\n\nThe histologic appearance is of adenoma or low-grade adenocarcinoma. The cuboidal or pseudostratified nonciliated epithelial cells form orderly tubular, papillary, or acinar arrangements; squamous differentiation is described but rare. Neoplastic cells have basal round nuclei and a variable mitotic rate. Mucus secretion is occasionally abundant, and the fibrovascular stroma is usually scant. Neoplastic tissue and adjacent non-neoplastic tissues often contain numerous lymphocytes, and glandular hyperplasia or polyps may be present.\n\nThe diagnosis is usually based on gross and histologic findings. However, morphologic features do not differentiate viral neoplasms from the sporadic (nonviral) nasal tumors that occasionally develop in small ruminants. Immunohistochemistry, PCR, or electron microscopy are useful to detect the virus in tumors. An ELISA may be of value for identifying infected animals in flocks. Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (jaagsiekte). Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA), also known as jaagsiekte or ovine pulmonary adenomatosis, is a contagious retroviral pulmonary carcinoma of sheep, and rarely of goats. The disease is common in South America, South Africa, and Scotland, where 5-20% of infected animals contain pulmonary tumors. OPA occurs regularly in the rest of Europe, Africa, and Asia, but is rare in North America and not reported in Australia. Mortality rates tend to increase gradually for several years following introduction of infection, and subsequently decline gradually. Clinical disease is most common in 2-4 year-old sheep, but 3-month-old lambs have been affected. Clinical signs include progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, exercise intolerance, nasal discharge, coughing, and weight loss; fever and anorexia are unusual unless secondary infections occur. Drainage of lung fluids from the nose following elevation of the hindlimbs is a characteristic clinical sign seen in some sheep.\n\nJaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), the agent of OPA, is a 100-nm diameter, enveloped, betaretrovirus. The following arguments support the role of JSRV as the etiology: JSRV is consistently present in neoplastic cells but minimally in nonneoplastic epithelium or stroma, the disease can be reproduced with cell-free JSRV-containing filtrates of tumor tissue, and the incubation period is dependent on the amount of retroviral reverse transcriptase in the experimental inoculum. However, defining the exact role of JSRV in disease development is complicated by the presence of endogenous retroviral proviral sequences that are common in neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissue of affected and normal sheep.\n\nOPA is thought to be acquired by direct contact of young animals with nasal secretions of infected animals. Most\n\nEnzootic nasal tumor. Viral adenomas and carcinomas of the nasal cavity of sheep and goats are geographically widespread, but absent from Australia and New Zealand. The prevalence is geographically variable, and many flocks have multiple animals affected over long periods of time. Clinical disease typically arises in adults, but lambs as young as 6 months have been affected. Clinical signs are insidious, progressive, and include stertor, inspiratory dyspnea, open-mouth breathing, nasal discharge, nasal deformity, and weight loss.\n\nEnzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV) includes 2 types, ENTV-1 from sheep and ENTV-2 from goats, which are related to jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV). The viral envelope glycoprotein, which is responsible for tumor development (at least in mice), is detectable within neoplastic epithelial cells but not in the adjacent normal tissue. The disease has been transmitted to sheep and goats by using cellfree nasal fluids or tumor filtrates. Incubation periods after experimental infection are as little as 3 months, although those in the natural disease are thought to be 1-3 years. Transmission is thought to be by contact with nasal secretions. However, subclinical infection is common, and most experimentally challenged animals do not develop tumors.\n\nTumors may be unilateral or bilateral and usually originate from the ethmoid turbinates, but fill much of the caudal nasal cavity before severe clinical signs develop (Fig. 5-64 ). In protracted unilateral cases, the entire nasal cavity is occluded by tumor, there is deviation of the nasal septum, and tumor may differentiate JSRV from endogenous sheep retroviral sequences and enzootic nasal tumor virus, although the low JSRV loads in blood leukocytes limit its sensitivity for analysis of blood samples. naturally infected animals do not have tumors. In those that do, the typical incubation period has been estimated to be 2 years, but is age and dose dependent; tumors may develop in 10-20 days if high doses are administered experimentally to neonatal lambs. The increased propensity for tumor development in neonatally infected lambs may relate to the greater frequency of proliferating type II pneumocytes during postnatal lung development. In contrast, lung cells from adult sheep or goat kids are restrictive for JRSV replication. Disease is more common in certain breeds of sheep, but the reasons for this familial predisposition are unknown. The envelope glycoprotein is sufficient to induce similar tumors in immunodeficient mice, and is the likely mechanism of tumor formation in sheep. It is exceptional that a retroviral structural protein should induce neoplasia, but oncogenes have not been identified in JSRV. Weak cellular and humoral immune responses in infected sheep, probably resulting from the continued presence of related endogenous retroviruses, may permit the persistent infection that typifies the disease.\n\nLungs of sheep with OPA contain multifocal or locally extensive lesions that are firm, gray, and exude fluid from the cut section . Affected lungs are heavy, up to 3 times their normal weight, and airways are filled with foamy secretion from the neoplastic cells. The tumors are expansile, and metastases to regional lymph nodes are present in about 10% of cases. Metastases to other tissues are reported but rare. Maedi and/or bacterial pneumonia are often present in sheep with OPA, and the diffuse lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia or cranioventral suppurative bronchopneumonia induced by these diseases may complicate the gross and histologic appearance of the tumors.\n\nThe histologic appearance is of a well-differentiated pulmonary carcinoma (see Figs. 5-25A, 5-65; see also eFig. 5-35). The neoplastic masses usually have a lepidic pattern in which alveoli are lined by cuboidal or columnar neoplastic epithelial cells. Other tumors have papillary or acinar patterns, a myxomatous variant is described, and polypoid lesions arising from bronchioles may be seen. The neoplastic cells variably express immunohistochemical markers of type II pneumocytes and bronchiolar club cells, suggesting an origin from multipotent lung epithelial progenitor cells. Alveoli adjacent to the tumors are atelectatic and contain many macrophages, and interstitial fibrosis may be present in advanced cases.\n\nIn the most frequent or classic form, tumors are poorly demarcated and extend into adjacent alveoli or form locally extensive lesions within affected lobes. An atypical form of the disease is subclinical and probably nonprogressive, and the tumors are isolated or well demarcated, dry, and firmer than the classic form, and surrounded by a more prominent infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells. It is suggested that the classic progressive form reflects abundant JSRV replication in proliferating alveolar epithelial cells, promoting infection of the surrounding lung tissue, with ensuing expansion of the tumors. In contrast, the atypical form may reflect infection of lungs that have less alveolar epithelial cell proliferation, with well-demarcated nonprogressive tumors resulting from expression of the tumor-causing envelope glycoprotein but minimal viral replication.\n\nThe pulmonary lesions of OPA are characteristic, but cannot be distinguished from the rare nonviral pulmonary carcinomas of sheep without further testing. Immunohistochemistry for the JSRV envelope glycoprotein is useful for confirmation of the viral origin of the tumors. A PCR assay is able to mesenteric lymph nodes are hemorrhagic and edematous. Ulcerative lesions covered by yellow plaques of fibrin and necrotic debris are common on the tongue, pharynx in the area of tonsillar crypts, larynx, and esophagus. The abomasal, intestinal and colonic mucosae occasionally have shallow ulcers. The lungs are diffusely congested and edematous. Multiple foci of hemorrhagic necrosis may be scattered throughout the lungs, and the liver may contain pinpoint to 1-cm diameter yellow necrotic foci. There is occasionally inflammation of joints, pericardium, meninges, and choroid plexus, but these lesions are absent in peracute cases.\n\nMicroscopic examination of tissues reveals widespread bacterial embolism (see Fig. 5-66) . The pulmonary lesions consist of multifocal masses of bacteria filling capillaries, accompanied by hemorrhagic and fibrinous exudate into alveoli. A peripheral zone of necrotic leukocytes may be present. The pale hepatic foci consist of colonies of bacteria with a surrounding zone of ischemic necrosis. There may be thrombosis of the adjacent tributaries of the portal vein and small amounts of parenchymal necrosis, but the leukocyte response is generally slight. This is probably related to the short course of the disease and perhaps to the effects of bacterial toxin on \n\nThe bacteria causing pneumonia in sheep include Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, hemolytic streptococci, and Helcococcus ovis. The important role of mycoplasmas is discussed later. Caseous lymphadenitis (eFig. 5-91) is described elsewhere (see Vol. 3, Hematopoietic system). M. haemolytica can also cause septicemia in the absence of pneumonia in lambs <2 months of age. The causative agents, predisposing factors, and pathogenesis are in many respects similar to those described in cattle. Sudden climatic changes, gathering and handling, and infection with Mycoplasma spp., ovine or bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, or adenovirus are the most commonly recognized predisposing causes. The Pasteurellaceae bacteria listed above cause hemorrhagic or fibrinonecrotic, lobar or lobular bronchopneumonia and serofibrinous pleuritis in acute cases, and fibrinopurulent bronchopneumonia leading to abscess formation and fibrous pleural adhesions in subacute to chronic cases. M. haemolytica causes sporadic cases and small outbreaks of acute pneumonia and pleuritis in goat kids. The disease usually occurs as a peracute disease in late autumn and winter. At autopsy, a sheet of yellow fibrin adheres loosely to the pleural surfaces. The cranial lobes of the lungs are firm and dark red, with a transition to less-firm tissue with mottled gray-pink discoloration in the caudal lobes. Acute diffuse bronchopneumonia is characterized microscopically by neutrophils, protein-rich exudate, and numerous bacteria filling bronchioles and alveoli. There is usually little evidence of necrosis. In the caudal lobes, neutrophils fill the bronchioles and extend into the alveoli. Helcococcus ovis has been recently associated with chronic suppurative bronchopneumonia, lung abscesses, and pleuritis in a sheep and a goat. The gram-positive bacterial cocci are visible histologically amid necrotic debris in the abscesses or on the pleural surface.\n\nSepticemic pasteurellosis. Septicemia caused by Bibersteinia trehalosi occurs mainly in weaned lambs during the fall months, but it can occur in other age groups and at other times of the year. Deaths, which seldom exceed 5% of the sheep at risk, usually follow within a few days of changes in pasture, feed, or other management practices.\n\nSigns of illness are vague, and the usual course is short, or lambs may be found dead with no opportunity to exhibit clinical signs. At autopsy, petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages are usually present in subcutaneous tissues, particularly of the neck and thorax, in intermuscular fascia, and in the pleura, epicardium, and mesentery ( Fig. 5-66 ). Retropharyngeal and develop central areas of caseous necrosis and neutrophil infiltration.\n\nThe gross and histologic appearance of melioidosis is not pathognomonic. Caseous lymphadenitis, glanders, and abscesses caused by other bacteria may have a similar appearance, and the brain lesions may be mistaken for listeriosis. A tentative diagnosis may be based on identifying gramnegative bipolar-staining bacilli in sections or tissue smears, but definitive diagnosis requires culture. Because of its zoonotic potential, great care should be taken when dealing with suspect cases during autopsy and subsequent tissue handling and testing. Galyov EE, et al \n\nIntratracheal challenge of lambs with Chlamydophila abortus (psittaci) induces mild infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into alveoli and alveolar septa, and mild proliferative alveolitis. Lesions are most prominent adjacent to terminal bronchioles. Moderately sized cuffs of lymphocytes are present around bronchioles and small blood vessels at the height of the lesion. The chlamydiae are mostly destroyed during the acute phase of inflammation, which then subsides. Resolution can be complete within 3-4 weeks of experimental infection. Chlamydiae may contribute to some cases of enzootic pneumonia in lambs and calves, in combination with other agents, but are probably of limited importance as primary pulmonary pathogens.\n\nDungworth DL, Cordy DR. The pathogenesis of ovine pneumonia. J Comp Pathol 1962;72:49-79.\n\nContagious caprine pleuropneumonia. Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) was first described in Africa in the late 1800s and remains an important disease in northern and western Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. The difficulty in isolating the causative agent in culture caused much confusion in the early literature, but the cause of CCPP is now known to be Mycoplasma capricolum ssp. capripneumoniae. Although other mycoplasmas may cause similar lesions, these are not considered CCPP. Classic CCPP caused massive outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality in naive goats of all ages. Currently, CCPP, an OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) listed disease, causes endemic sporadic disease in some countries and intermittent epizootics in others. Affected goats are lethargic, dyspneic, and febrile; have bouts of coughing; but may continue to eat. Young goats may be lame because of polyarthritis.\n\nM. capricolum ssp. capripneumoniae (formerly Mycoplasma F38) is phylogenetically related to, but distinct from, M.\n\nleukocytes. Bacterial emboli are regularly found in the spleen and adrenals, occasionally in the kidney, but are rare in other organs. Masses of bacteria adhere to the surface of the pharyngeal ulcers and occlude underlying blood vessels and lymphatics, and probably represent the principal site of bacterial proliferation and systemic invasion. Miller DS, et al. Domestic sheep (Ovis aries) Pasteurellaceae isolates from diagnostic submissions to the Caine Veterinary Teaching Center (1990 ). Vet Microbiol 2011 150:284-288. Melioidosis. Melioidosis is a systemic infectious disease affecting a wide range of animal species in tropical climates. The disease is endemic in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, is probably common in the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean, and also occurs in southern Africa and the Middle East. The prevalence is highest in wet seasons, and causes acute outbreaks or chronic endemic disease. Clinical signs are variable and reflect the range of organs affected, and case fatality rates are high. Melioidosis is most common in goats, sheep, pigs, and rodents, and is an emerging tropical disease of humans. Horses, deer, camels, and laboratory animals are less commonly affected, whereas dogs, cats, cattle, water buffalo, and fowl are resistant to the disease unless they are immunosuppressed.\n\nMelioidosis is caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, a facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bipolar-staining bacillus. Infection is acquired from contaminated soil or water, by inhalation, ingestion, or inoculation of cutaneous wounds. Acute disease, most common in young animals, may initially affect the lungs, with later spread to other organs, or be primarily septicemic from the site of inoculation. Chronic disease is the more frequent manifestation, in which abscesses in multiple organs cause chronic nonspecific illness or are an incidental finding of public health importance at slaughter.\n\nVirulence factors of B. pseudomallei include the ironscavenging protein malleobactin, secreted proteases that degrade host tissues, a polysaccharide capsule that confers resistance to killing by phagocytes, lipopolysaccharides, and Burkholderia lethal factor 1, a protein toxin that inhibits translation and causes cell death. The bacterium survives within macrophage phagolysosomes and in epithelial cells, and elicits a granulomatous and suppurative tissue reaction.\n\nMelioidosis causes abscesses in multiple organs. The lungs are most consistently affected, with disseminated coalescing nodules, or locally extensive areas of consolidation. Abscesses also affect the spleen, liver, lymph nodes, subcutis, kidney, or joints, and may occur in any visceral tissue. Lesions are particularly widespread in goats, and may include mastitis or aortic aneurysm. Neurologic disease is most common in goats; gross lesions are rare, but multifocal aggregates of neutrophils and lymphocytic perivascular cuffs are present in the brainstem and spinal cord. Nodular lesions in the nasal mucosa may be mistaken for glanders. Endometritis and placentitis are important manifestations in cattle.\n\nThe abscesses of melioidosis are not distinctive in their appearance. The chronic lesions are encapsulated nodular masses, up to 5-cm diameter, with creamy or caseous yellow centers. Multifocal aggregates of neutrophils form within 12 hours of infection. Granulomas, present by 3 days, form nodular aggregates of epithelioid macrophages and lymphocytes, and these commonly develop pneumonia or pleuropneumonia, fibrinopurulent polyarthritis, or septicemia with fibrinous polyserositis and interstitial pneumonia. The lung lesions may resemble those described previously for CCPP, but thickening of interlobular septa by edema and fibrin exudation is not typically present in CCPP. M. mycoides ssp. mycoides LC is particularly capable of causing pleuropneumonia, polyarthritis, and septicemia in goat kids and, to a lesser extent, in lambs; the worldwide distribution of this pathogen is in contrast to those of contagious caprine and bovine pleuropneumonia. M. capricolum principally causes fibrinopurulent polyarthritis in kids, but may also cause septicemia in kids and mastitis in does.\n\nChronic bronchopneumonia (chronic nonprogressive pneumonia) in lambs and kids is common, often subclinical, but reduces growth rates. Multiple etiologic agents are implicated, including Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, parainfluenza-3 virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Of these agents, M. ovipneumoniae is isolated particularly frequently and probably plays an important causal role. Stress, poor air quality, and adverse weather conditions also contribute to development of disease.\n\nLesions typically affect the cranioventral lung, and include lymphoid hyperplasia around airways, neutrophil accumulation within airspaces, hyperplasia of bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium, bronchiolar mucous metaplasia, and a unique lesion of hyaline scars. The latter consist of nodular masses of fibrillar eosinophilic matrix and fibroblasts within the wall of bronchioles that bluntly compress the lumen, but do not form the intrabronchiolar polyps seen in bronchiolitis obliterans. The lesions do not indicate a specific etiology and diagnosis requires culture of lesional lung tissue. Sheehan M, et \n\nOestrus ovis. Oestrus ovis (sheep bot fly) adult flies deposit first-stage larvae on the nares. The larvae molt twice as they migrate through the nasal passages. Larvae may become incarcerated in sinuses or recesses of turbinates as they grow, and eventually die there . Development in the nasal passages can take up to 10 months, although larvae deposited early in summer are able to mature in that season. The full-grown larvae are about 3 cm long, with black oral hooks, dorsal dark transverse bands, and ventral rows of small spines. Pupation occurs on the ground.\n\nThe larvae attach to the mucous membrane by their mouthparts. They produce mucosal defects at the points of attachment and, because the cuticle is spinous, cause irritation as they wander. An immune response against excreted or secreted larval antigens, and the ensuing eosinophil and mast cell response, may also contribute to nasal inflammation and irritation. Affected sheep develop catarrhal rhinitis and sinusitis. Apart from persistent annoyance and the debility that this may cause, there are seldom untoward effects of the parasitism. Rarely, larvae penetrate the cranial cavity, or secondary bacterial infections spread from the olfactory mucosa to the meninges. Mild infestations of O. ovis occur in goats and dogs, as well as conjunctival infections in humans.\n\nmycoides. The virulence factors of this pathogen have not been well defined. Subclinical carriers are important sources of infection, and are the usual source of introduction of the disease into naive herds. Stress may trigger shedding of organisms from subclinically infected animals. Individual goats are infected by inhalation of droplets through close contact with coughing goats. The infection is restricted to the respiratory tract. It mainly affects goats, although infection has been recently detected in wildlife.\n\nPulmonary lesions are often unilateral but may be bilateral. The pleura is covered by a thick layer of fibrin, and serous fluid fills the pleural cavity. Lobular areas of consolidation and purple-gray discoloration are present in the lung, either diffusely or forming focal lesions, and these may contain extensive areas of necrosis or have a dry granular texture. Fibrinous pericarditis is common. Chronic cases develop focal nodules of necrosis and mineralization with a fibrous capsule, or lung abscesses if secondary bacterial infection develops. However, in contrast to contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, sequestra and interlobular edema are not features of the caprine disease. Histologically, the exudate in alveoli and interlobular septa varies from serofibrinous to fibrinopurulent. Thrombosis and vasculitis are often present. With time, the fibrinous exudates organize to form a mass of fibrous tissue.\n\nGross lesions are suggestive, but not diagnostic. Other mycoplasmas, particularly M. mycoides ssp. mycoides (large colony type [LC]), and M. mycoides ssp. capri, may cause epidemics with similar lung lesions. Features that suggest CCPP rather than other mycoplasmas include the presence of both pneumonia and pleuritis, the absence of interlobular edema and inflammation, and the absence of mastitis, arthritis, or keratitis. Laboratory examination is required for definitive diagnosis.\n\nM. capricolum ssp. capripneumoniae is an extremely difficult organism to propagate in culture, although it can often be recovered from the pleural fluid and consolidated lung of acutely ill animals. Detecting mycoplasmal nucleic acid using the PCR on samples of pleural fluid is a more rapid and sensitive method of diagnosis. Complement fixation and latex agglutination tests are effective methods of serodiagnosis. Nicholas R, Churchward C composed of a few multinucleated cells with an indistinct brush border, and the uteri often contain thick-shelled embryonated eggs and larvae. The inflammatory response is often minimal, although alveolar septa may be thickened by fibrous tissue, lymphocytes, and smooth muscle hyperplasia (see . In older animals or chronic infestations, presumably associated with developing resistance, the cellular reaction is more marked and targets the first-stage larvae and adults. Eosinophils aggregate around the larvae; the alveolar spaces contain macrophages, eosinophils, and giant cells.\n\nLarvae that escape into small bronchioles are enclosed in plugs of mucus and cellular debris. When larvae leave the nodules, the cellular reaction subsides, but thickening of the alveolar septa persists because of patchy or diffuse fibrosis. Adult worms incite a similar reaction of eosinophils, macrophages, and giant cells. The cellular debris becomes mineralized, particularly when the worms die, and these mineralized nodules persist indefinitely as spherical masses of calcium salts surrounded by a fibrous capsule. The gross appearance of Muellerius infestation can closely resemble that of Cystocaulus. However, the nodules of Cystocaulus are darker and may be larger than those of Muellerius, the adult worms may be grossly visible, and bronchial epithelial hyperplasia is more likely in Cystocaulus infestation. In Dictyocaulus and Protostrongylus infections, the adult worms are located in large bronchioles/bronchi and the terminal bronchioles, respectively.\n\nIn goats, Muellerius infestation has been associated with severe diffuse interstitial pneumonia in the absence of nodular lesions. Histologic lesions included diffuse thickening of alveolar septa with mononuclear cells, and fibromuscular hyperplasia in alveolar septa; but the possibility that these lesions might have been caused by caprine arthritis encephalitis virus or Mycoplasma infection cannot be ruled out. (Table  5 -3). There is usually no clinical evidence of respiratory disease in sheep, although experimental infections may cause hyperpnea, impaired pulmonary gas exchange, and reduced weight gains. Heavy infestations are purported to predispose to bacterial and viral infections of the lung.\n\nMuellerius capillaris, also known as the small lungworm of sheep and goats, is a nematode of the superfamily Metastrongyloidea, family Protostrongylidae. Adults, which are 12-24 mm long and threadlike, live in nodular lesions in the alveoli and rarely in bronchioles, but are usually not visible at autopsy. Eggs are laid and rapidly hatch, and first-stage larvae are coughed up, swallowed, and passed in the feces. In some cases, each nodule in the lung may contain adult worms of only one sex. The infection in such cases is sterile, and larvae will not be detected in feces. The intermediate hosts are various slugs and snails. The infective stage is reached after 2 molts in the intermediate host, and the life cycle is completed when sheep and goats swallow the intermediate hosts. The larvae migrate to the lungs, presumably via the lymphatics, and break out into the alveoli. As a consequence of this type of life cycle, infections are gradually acquired, and large worm burdens are seldom observed in animals <6 months of age. On the other hand, heavy infections are not common in old sheep and goats, as repeatedly infected animals become resistant.\n\nThe characteristic finding is multiple, subpleural nodules in the dorsal regions of the caudal lobes (Fig. 5-67 ). However, they may occur anywhere in the lung, and occasionally in the regional lymph nodes. The nodules are soft and hemorrhagic in the acute stages, corresponding to histologic lesions of hemorrhage and eosinophil infiltration. However, most cases represent chronic infestations with raised gray-pink or yellow nodules that may mineralize.\n\nThe nodules are formed by masses of adult worms, embryonated eggs, and coiled larvae (see Fig. 5-67 ). The adults have polymyarian-coelomyarian musculature, the intestine is Dictyocaulus filaria. Dictyocaulus filaria, the large lungworm of sheep and goats, is a slender, white, 3-10 cm long nematode that inhabits mainly the small bronchi. The life cycle and lesions are similar to those described for D. viviparus, which is described in detail with respiratory diseases of cattle. The lesions are localized, 3-4 cm diameter areas of atelectasis or consolidation that are most common in the dorsal aspects of the caudal lobes. Bronchi are prominently thickened by smooth muscle and cuffs of lymphocytes and granulocytes, and often contain adult threadlike worms (eFig. 5-94). A granulomatous alveolar reaction to aspirated eggs may occur.\n\nProtostrongylidae, that infects sheep, goats, and deer. The adults are 16-35 mm in length, red, and mainly inhabit the terminal bronchioles. Eggs hatch to first-stage larvae in the lung, and are passed in the feces. They enter intermediate hosts, which are various genera of terrestrial snails, by boring through the foot. Two molts occur in the snail, and the infective third-stage larvae develop in 46-49 days. Sheep and goats eating the snails are infected by the larvae, which pass by way of the mesenteric lymphatics to the lungs.\n\nLesions consist of 2-4 cm diameter, angular, firm, tan nodules distributed throughout the lungs. The nodules are usually soft, in contrast to the firm texture of Muellerius nodules. Crosssections may reveal fine white worms exuding from the parenchyma or occasionally leading to a small bronchus. Histologically, an eosinophilic inflammatory reaction targets adult worms, larvae, and eggs in the terminal bronchioles. Prominent lymphofollicular aggregates surround these airways. Smooth muscle hyperplasia is not a feature of Protostrongylus infestation. equine respiratory disease in the 1950s, but has been considered extinct since 1978. Surface hemagglutinin is the immunodominant antigen, and inactivated vaccines induce short-lived protection that correlates with induction of antibody to this antigen. Vaccinated horses may be infected and shed virus, but have a milder and shorter clinical course. Horses that recover from natural infection have more prolonged resistance to disease, for at least 1 year, but in this case, resistance is not closely correlated to anti-hemagglutinin antibody titers.\n\nAs with influenza in swine and humans, the disease in horses is usually characterized by high morbidity and low mortality, unless secondary bacterial pneumonia develops. Most outbreaks spread rapidly through groups of horses, and are characterized by acute onset of fever of <4 days duration, severe nonproductive cough, mucopurulent nasal discharge, lethargy, and anorexia. Dependent edema is an uncommon finding. Although most clinical signs resolve within 1-2 weeks, coughing may persist for weeks or months. Occasionally, and rarely, introduction of certain strains of influenza virus into naive populations has caused outbreaks with nearly 100% morbidity and high mortality.\n\nInfection with EIV is usually acquired by inhalation of infected aerosols. Viral replication is most extensive in epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and trachea, where infective viral particles bud from the plasma membrane within 2-4 days after infection. Influenza reduces mucociliary clearance both by impairing ciliary beating and by inducing necrosis of infected cells, and may also impair alveolar macrophage function; the ensuing bacterial pneumonia is responsible for many of the fatal cases. Epithelial repair following influenza may take up to 3 weeks, and affected horses may continue to cough well past the point of complete repair.\n\nGross and histologic lesions of uncomplicated EIV are not commonly seen as horses rarely die from such infections. Gross lesions of viral pneumonia occur mainly in foals, and consist of coalescent foci of consolidation separated by unaffected to hyperinflated lung; less commonly, diffuse lung consolidation is reported. Both foals and adult horses develop secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia (eFig. 5-95). Histologically, tracheitis is common, and foals may develop bronchointerstitial pneumonia with bronchitis and bronchiolitis characterized by epithelial necrosis as well as epithelial hyperplasia, and squamous metaplasia in the bronchi. Involvement of the alveolar parenchyma ranges from mild inflammation to severe necrosis, with hyaline membrane formation and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. At all airway levels, inflammation consists primarily of a mix of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Rarely, severe EIV infection affects the brain, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and other parenchymal organs.\n\nThe major differential diagnoses for nonfatal cases of upper respiratory infection include equid herpesviruses 1 and 4 and equine rhinitis A virus. In such cases, diagnosis is most commonly based on detection of virus by RT-PCR from nasal swabs. Isolation of influenza virus is less commonly used to diagnose disease and is most reliable during the phase of pyrexia in the first day or 2 of illness. In the rare cases that are acutely fatal, virus may be demonstrated in lung by RT-PCR, isolation, ELISA, or by immunohistochemistry. Serology is mainly used to follow animal exposure during EIV outbreaks, but is also of value for routine diagnosis. Miscellaneous parasites. Neostrongylus linearis, a comparable nematode to Protostrongylus rufescens, is common in western Europe, the Middle East, and probably elsewhere. The adults are 5-15 mm long, and terrestrial gastropods are the intermediate hosts. The worms are contained within 1-4 mm diameter, red-violet or gray-pink nodules that are most numerous in the caudal lobes.\n\nCystocaulus ocreatus (C. nigrescens) reside in 5-20 mm diameter, dark, firm nodules in the caudodorsal lung. Crosssections may reveal brown-black hairlike worms, which move when the lung section is immersed in saline. The life cycle resembles that of Muellerius.\n\nMammomonogamus (Syngamus) nasicola and M. laryngeus are nematodes of the nasal cavity and larynx. Schistosoma nasalis causes nasal granuloma in India. Habronema spp. are rare causes of fibrotic nodules adjacent to bronchioles. In sheep, the lung is a common site of hydatid cysts caused by Echinococcus granulosus; the cysts have multiple protoscolices within brood capsules (but these are apparent only in fertile cysts) surrounded by a thin layer of germinal epithelium, an eosinophilic PAS-positive noncellular laminated layer, and an outer adventitial layer that contains macrophages, lymphocytes, giant cells, and remnants of bronchiolar epithelium. Barnes TS, et \n\nEquine influenza. General features of influenza viruses are discussed previously (see Infectious respiratory diseases of swine). Influenza A virus in horses (colloquially, equine influenza virus, EIV) infection is widespread in most intensively managed horse populations. Outbreaks occur most commonly in the autumn and winter months in young immunologically naive horses. Risk factors for infection and disease include close confinement, transportation, training, and mixing of animals. These factors increase the chance of contact between naive and subclinically infected animals. Antigenic drift is a feature of influenza viruses; thus epizootics of influenza may occur even in vaccinated horses, when new antigenic variants of influenza viruses emerge.\n\nEIV originated from avian influenza viruses and is placed within subgroup A based on the antigenicity of the nucleocapsid and matrix proteins. As with other influenza viruses, EIV can be identified by the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) surface glycoproteins. All currently circulating EIV belong to the H3N8 (formerly equi-2) subtype. H7N7 (formerly equi-1) influenza virus was an important cause of\n\nFurther reading Daubney Equid gammaherpesviruses. Members of the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae known to infect the respiratory tract of equids include EHV-2 and EHV-5 in horses and 2 asinine herpesviruses in donkeys. PCR-based detection of EHV-2 and EHV-5 is reportedly more common in surveys of nasal swabs and tracheal washes from horses with respiratory disease, but their role in the pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract disease in horses remains poorly defined. Lower respiratory tract disease is reported in horses and donkeys in association with infection with EHV-5, AHV-4, and AHV-5.\n\nEquine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF) is a progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease associated with lung infection with EHV-5. EMPF is largely a disease of adult horses that is clinically characterized by low-grade fever, weight loss, and progressive exercise intolerance. The gross pathology of EMPF is restricted to the lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes. Within the lungs, there are variably sized nodular foci of fibrosis (Fig. 5-68 ). These vary from individual discrete nodules separated by relatively normal lung parenchyma to coalescent foci with little unaffected lung present. The tracheobronchial lymph nodes in cases of EMPF are often markedly enlarged. Histologically, the nodules are composed of abundant interstitial collagen accumulation, along with irregular alveolus-like spaces lined by cuboidal epithelial cells. Within the lumen of these spaces, there is a moderate inflammatory infiltrate of mostly neutrophils and macrophages. Occasional macrophages are enlarged and contain large eosinophilic intranuclear viral inclusion bodies (see Fig. 5-68) .\n\nThe evidence for a link between lung infection with EHV-5 and the development of EMPF has been based on detection of virus by PCR as well as virus isolation, and co-localization of the virus with the lesions. The most compelling evidence for EHV-5 in the pathogenesis of EMPF comes from experimental infection of horses with EHV-5 isolates obtained from cases of EMPF. Nodular lung fibrosis with features similar to EMPF was induced in horses inoculated with these isolates of EHV-5, providing strong evidence that this gammaherpesvirus is the cause of EMPF.\n\nDiagnosis of EMPF can be made using PCR to detect EHV-5 in lung from horses that develop the characteristic clinical disease and lesions. Isolation of EHV-5 can be challenging, as the gammaherpesvirus grows slowly in cells and may require multiple blind passages.\n\nInterstitial pneumonia occurs in donkeys in association with lung infection with AHV-4 and AHV-5. The gross lesions in affected donkeys consist of lungs that fail to collapse, with patchy or multifocal firm lesions, most commonly in the cranioventral areas. Histologically, affected animals have a mix of bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia with the consistent presence of large multinucleated syncytial cells. Viral inclusion bodies are not present. Bronchiolar lesions range from mononuclear cell and neutrophil infiltrates around bronchioles, to necrosis of bronchiolar epithelium. Alveolar changes include similar leukocyte infiltrates, in some cases with extensive type II pneumocyte proliferation and interstitial fibrosis. Diagnosis is based on PCR testing to detect AHV-4 or AHV-5 in association with the characteristic histologic lesions.\n\nEquid alphaherpesviruses. General features of herpesviruses are described above (see Infectious respiratory diseases of cattle). Equid alphaherpesviruses (EHV) cause upper respiratory infections, abortion, systemic disease of neonates, and neurologic disease. The latter 3 manifestations are described in more detail elsewhere. Systemic disease of yearling horses or adults is rare, but notable for the high mortality rates that may occur.\n\nUpper respiratory infections of juvenile and adult horses may be caused by EHV-1 or EHV-4. Uncomplicated rhinitis elicited by these 2 viruses is clinically indistinguishable, with disease most common in foals <1 year of age. Affected animals are febrile with serous or mucopurulent nasal discharge. Both viruses readily infect nasal respiratory epithelial cells, causing local epithelial necrosis and inflammation that result in the aforementioned clinical signs. Less commonly, viral infection extends into the trachea, resulting in coughing in affected horses. Infection is rarely fatal, unless secondary bacterial pneumonia develops. Viral replication occurs in the nasopharynx and associated lymphoid tissue, and the development of viremia is dependent on the strain of the virus and prior exposure of the host. Virus is shed from nasal secretions starting 2-10 days after infection. Viral shedding commonly occurs only during the phase of pyrexia, but is occasionally prolonged up to 3 weeks after infection. Latency for EHV-1 and EHV-4 is established within neuronal cells (e.g., trigeminal ganglion) and lymphocytes, as well as lung epithelial cells in the case of EHV-4. Seroconversion to both viruses is common, with nearly 100% of horses surveyed having seroconverted to EHV-4. Because of this, as well as the prevalence of vaccination for the viruses, serology is of limited use in diagnosing infection with these 2 viruses. Definitive diagnosis of EHV-1 or EHV-4 infection of the upper respiratory tract can be done using virus-specific PCR on material collected from nasal swabs or isolation of virus from such swabs.\n\nLesions are similar to those in aborted foals (see Vol. 3, Female genital system) and include bronchointerstitial pneumonia; multifocal necrosis in liver, spleen, adrenal, and other tissues; prominent intranuclear inclusion bodies; and sometimes syncytial cells. The lungs are heavy with a diffuse rubbery-firm texture, and multiple white foci of necrosis may be present but inconspicuous (eFig. 5-96). EHV-1 occasionally causes systemic disease in yearling or adult horses. Lesions include pulmonary or systemic necrotizing vasculitis, pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, lymphoid necrosis, and encephalomyelitis with vasculitis. A B genetic immunodeficiency becomes less common. At autopsy, the gross lesions consist of a lobular or confluent pattern of atelectasis and/or consolidation primarily, but not exclusively, within cranioventral lung. In the early stage of severe infection, there is extensive necrosis and sloughing of bronchiolar epithelium. Later, bronchiolar epithelium is hyperplastic, and swollen superficial epithelial cells contain amphophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies. Occasionally, there are intranuclear inclusions in alveolar epithelial cells and increased numbers of macrophages and neutrophils. Secondary bacterial pneumonia or Pneumocystis pneumonia may also be present in these immunocompromised foals. Hendra virus has tropism for endothelial cells, and many of the lesions arise from vascular injury. Viral particles are detectable in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells. Gross lesions in horses reflect the viral vascular tropism, and include prominent pulmonary edema and congestion with dilation of subpleural lymphatic vessels, petechial hemorrhages, and abundant tracheal froth. The most prominent histologic lesion is serofibrinous fluid and increased numbers of macrophages in alveoli. Closer inspection reveals subtle vascular lesions in the lung, heart, glomeruli, and stomach, consisting of thrombi in capillaries and/or necrotic debris and hemorrhage in the walls of arterioles. The presence of syncytial cells in small vessels is a unique but inconsistent lesion. The differential diagnosis for massive pulmonary edema includes African horse sickness, heart failure, and anaphylaxis. \n\nRhodococcus equi. Rhodococcus equi (Rhodococcus hoagii, Prescotella equi) is an important cause of pneumonia and occasionally enteric disease in 1-6 month-old foals. The prevalence of the disease is highly variable between farms, and probably reflects the bacterial load within airborne dust, as soil is the important source of infection. Environmental factors favoring the disease include hot seasonal temperatures in temperate climates, neutral soil pH, and repetitive high-density stocking of dry paddocks. The clinical presentation may be either acute or insidiously progressive, although the infection and lesions are invariably chronic by the time clinical signs are noted. Thoracic ultrasound shows that most foals with lung abscesses Adenovirus. Equine adenovirus 1 infection is widespread in horses, and is mainly associated with upper respiratory tract infections. Adenoviral pneumonia is a well-described complication of inherited combined immunodeficiency in young Arabian foals. This severe disease has become rare as this do not develop clinical disease, and many recover without therapy. When clinical disease occurs, it is most frequent in the summer, with pyrexia, tachypnea, dyspnea, cough, and mucopurulent nasal discharge. Because of the chronic nature of the disease, case fatality rates are high in untreated foals. Animals with the colonic form of disease may have diarrhea, weight loss, ascites resulting from hypoproteinemia, and occasionally colic.\n\nFoals with bronchointerstitial pneumonia, described previously, frequently have concurrent R. equi infection, yet the relationship between these conditions remains obscure. Foals with R. equi pneumonia occasionally have histologic evidence of Pneumocystis carinii infection of the lung.\n\nR. equi is a gram-positive facultative intracellular pathogen, distantly related to mycobacteria, which grows well in soil and in horse manure. Neonatal foals have the greatest susceptibility to infection, compared to those 6 weeks of age. Pulmonary infection results from inhalation of soil-borne bacteria, and inhalation of greater numbers of bacteria is facilitated by the presence of a dusty, contaminated environment. Enteric infections may result from ingestion of soil-contaminated feed, or swallowing expectorated material from the lungs. Experimental studies indicate that hematogenous spread from enteric lesions is not a common route of pulmonary infection.\n\nThe bacterium is engulfed by macrophages but survives this encounter by preventing maturation of the phagosome and its fusion with the lysosome. Nevertheless, macrophages are able to kill R. equi when the bacteria are opsonized or when the macrophages are activated by lymphocyte-derived interferon-\u03b3. Infection elicits a pyogranulomatous inflammatory response, presumably resulting from cytokines secreted by infected macrophages or responding lymphocytes.\n\nThe virulence of R. equi varies between isolates, and correlates closely with the presence of an 80-90 kb virulenceassociated plasmid (pVAP). Species specificity for horses, pigs, or cattle is conferred by the presence of different host-adapted plasmids. The pVAP carries a pathogenicity island that contains the variety of genes (including vapA) needed by the bacteria to survive within macrophages following phagocytosis. The macrophage is the preferred cell type for replication of the bacterium, and central to the pathogenesis of disease. Other virulence factors of R. equi include glycolipids containing long-chain mycolic acids, capsular polysaccharide, the \"equi factors\" cholesterol oxidase and choline phosphohydrolase, and the iron-binding protein rhequichelin.\n\nImmune responses to R. equi have been intensively investigated because of the interest in developing vaccines against this important disease of foals. The finding that passive immunization with hyperimmune plasma is effective in preventing disease indicates that humoral immunity is protective, probably because antibody-mediated opsonization augments phagocytosis and killing of R. equi by macrophages and neutrophils. In contrast to the role of humoral immunity in prevention of disease, T-helper-1 cellular immune responses are probably necessary for recovery from established infection. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are important in clearing R. equi in mouse models of disease. CD4+ T cells produce IFN-\u03b3, which activate macrophages to produce more bactericidal nitric oxide, oxygen radicals, and peroxynitrite; whereas CD8+ T cells induce lysis of infected macrophages.\n\nThe pulmonary lesions caused by R. equi are most constant in the cranioventral lung, but most of the lung may be affected in severe cases. The most consistent lesion is pyogranulomatous bronchopneumonia, in which 1-10 cm, white-tan, firm, coalescing nodules develop in the infected lung (Fig. 5-69 ). Intervening areas of lung are reddened and firmer than normal. With time, the centers of the pyogranulomas become friable and caseous or liquefying. These may be mistaken for abscesses, but they generally lack a fibrous capsule. Pleuritis is uncommon. Bronchial lymph nodes are enlarged and may contain focal caseous necrosis.\n\nIntestinal lesions are present in approximately half of the foals with pulmonary rhodococcosis; 5% of cases have lesions restricted to the intestine. The colon, cecum, and associated lymph nodes are most commonly affected, but small intestinal lesions may occur. Colonic lesions begin as focal mucosal ulcers that are centered on lymphoid follicles. The ulcer bed is reddened and covered with fibrin, and the borders of the ulcers are raised and pale because of pyogranulomatous infiltrates. Pyogranulomas or foci of caseous necrosis may extend through the wall of the intestine. The colonic lymph nodes are often enlarged, pale, and contain necrotic foci. The colonic pyogranulomas enlarge over time and develop central areas of caseation or liquefaction. Large abdominal abscesses may be the sole lesion in some cases.\n\nThe earliest histologic lesion following R. equi infection is suppurative bronchopneumonia. By 4 days after infection, alveoli and bronchioles are filled with macrophages, neutrophils, and fewer lymphocytes and plasma cells. Macrophages are numerous in the well-developed lesions, but neutrophils may also be plentiful. Gram-positive bacteria are present in the cytoplasm of plump uninucleated or multinucleated macrophages amid this exudate, and are particularly numerous within degenerating macrophages that have cytoplasmic eosinophilia and nuclear pyknosis (see Fig. 5-69) . Areas of caseous necrosis, when present, usually contain cellular debris, many neutrophils and macrophages, fibrin, and edema.\n\nIn the intestine, the dome epithelium overlying lymphoid follicles is the primary route of infection. Macrophages underlying the dome epithelium contain intracytoplasmic bacilli, and neutrophils infiltrate the epithelium and exude into the lumen. With time, the lymphoid follicles are invaded by macrophages and neutrophils, and central areas of caseous necrosis eventually extend to the mucosal surface. In the developed lesions of ulcerative colitis, ulcers are filled with fibrinonecrotic debris and encompassed by neutrophils and macrophages, many of which contain bacteria.\n\nAbout 1 3 of affected foals have polyarthritis. This may cause severe lameness, suppurative synovitis, and positive joint cultures, resulting from hematogenous spread of infection. In contrast, other foals have milder, probably immune-mediated polyarthritis. These are characterized by sterile joints, lymphoplasmacytic synovitis, mononuclear cells in joint fluid, and immunoglobulin deposits in synovium.\n\nMore widespread dissemination of infection in foals can occasionally give rise to abscesses in the mesenteric or mediastinal lymph nodes, liver, spleen, or skin; osteomyelitis affecting the vertebrae or metaphyses of long bones; and hypopyon. R. equi may also cause ulcerative lymphangitis, and has been associated with metritis and abortion in mares, metritis in cows, pneumonia in calves, and tubercle-like lesions in lymph nodes of pigs and cattle.\n\nLesions of cranioventral pyogranulomatous pneumonia or multifocal ulcerative colitis in foals are highly suggestive of R. equi infection. In most cases, the diagnosis is easily confirmed by culture, or by identifying intracytoplasmic gram-positive bacilli in macrophages on impression smears or tissue sections.\n\nEquine bacterial pneumonia and pleuropneumonia. Pleuropneumonia is common in 2-to 4-year-olds, and older horses may also be affected. Presenting signs include fever, depression, respiratory distress, and colic. Evidence of thoracic pain may be apparent at rest, with grunting respiration or abduction of the elbows, or be elicited by thoracic percussion. Horses with bacterial pneumonia develop fever, tachypnea, and coughing. Risk factors for the development of both pneumonia and pleuropneumonia include recent transportation, general anesthesia (probably leading to aspiration pneumonia), other stressful events, and viral infection.\n\nNumerous opportunistic bacterial pathogens have been isolated from lesions of pleuropneumonia in horses, and mixed infections are present in most cases. Attempts to isolate bacteria may fail in cases that have been heavily treated with antibiotics. Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus is the most common isolate; others include S. equisimilis, S. equi ssp. equi, Actinobacillus suis-like bacteria, other streptococci, Pasteurella spp., Bordetella bronchiseptica, E. coli, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium. Mycoplasma felis has been identified in a small number of horses with pleuritis, suggesting it should be considered as a differential diagnosis of cases of pleuritis without pneumonia.\n\nIdentification of a unilateral distribution of lesions and a mixed infection with aerobic and anaerobic bacteria imply that many cases result from aspiration pneumonia. The equine trachea at the thoracic inlet contains a pool of secretions contaminated by bacteria, the so-called \"tracheal puddle.\" One frequent pathogenesis seems to involve transport of horses Idiopathic bronchointerstitial pneumonia or Pneumocystis carinii infection may be present in foals with R. equi pneumonia. Giguere S, et Opportunistic bacterial pathogens in foals. Pneumonia caused by opportunistic bacterial pathogens is common in 1-8 month-old foals, and is of similar pathogenesis as in other species. Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus is the most prevalent cause, with occasional cases resulting from infection with \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Actinobacillus equuli, and others. Pneumonia in neonates is commonly caused by bacteria that cause septicemia, and the 2 processes may be concurrent; E. coli, Streptococcus spp., A. equuli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the most common isolates. Erol E, et \n\nlysis, and formation of intranodal abscesses. Recovery from strangles confers immunity in about 75% of horses, associated with IgA and IgG antibody produced locally in the nasopharynx. Although antibodies to M protein confer partial immunity, other protective antigens are not yet fully defined. The submandibular and retropharyngeal nodes are the first and usually the most severely affected. The swollen lymph nodes are initially firm, but this swelling becomes fluctuant as the suppurative exudate liquefies. The typical and most favorable clinical outcome of the lymphadenitis is for the abscesses to rupture onto the skin 1-3 weeks after onset of infection, releasing creamy yellow-white pus containing numerous infective bacteria. Infection also often extends from retropharyngeal lymph nodes to involve the guttural pouches, and purulent exudates within these structures can inspissate to form so-called chondroids. Drainage from the guttural pouch into the nasal cavity is a major reason for suppurative nasal discharge.\n\nMost cases of strangles recover quickly unless the enlarging lymph nodes obstruct the upper respiratory tract, but complications develop in 20% of clinically affected animals. This may involve extension of infection to adjacent structures, resulting in purulent sinusitis, guttural pouch empyema, periorbital abscess formation, facial cellulitis, or local damage to cranial nerves, resulting in laryngeal paralysis (roaring), facial nerve paralysis, or Horner's syndrome. Horses with guttural pouch empyema may remain infected, intermittently shed bacteria, and be an important source of infection for at least 8 months after resolution of the acute disease.\n\nMore serious complications include pneumonia or pleuropneumonia, myocarditis, mesenteric lymph node abscesses, and purpura hemorrhagica. Retropharyngeal abscesses may discharge into the pharynx, allowing pus to be aspirated into the lungs where localized areas of necrotizing pneumonia develop. Metastatic abscesses (\"bastard strangles\") occasionally form in the liver, kidneys, synovium, and brain, but are most common in mediastinal and mesenteric lymph nodes. Abscesses in these lymph nodes tend to be very large and, although rupture is unusual, the suppurative process can extend to adjacent serous membranes and cause purulent pleuritis or peritonitis. Purpura hemorrhagica is a systemic leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and follows deposition of immune complexes of IgA or IgG with bacterial M protein in small blood vessels and glomeruli. Purpura hemorrhagica develops in 1-2% of cases, 2-4 weeks after the acute infection. There is edema of the head and limbs, petechial hemorrhages on mucosal and serosal surfaces and in muscles, and occasionally glomerulonephritis.\n\nBecause similar, but usually milder, lesions may be caused by S. equi spp. zooepidemicus or other bacteria, definitive diagnosis relies on isolation of S. equi spp. equi from purulent exudate. PCR assays are also available and are particularly useful in detecting chronically infected horses. Timoney with the head held in an elevated position, thus predisposing to aspiration of these contaminated secretions into the lung.\n\nThe gross lesions of well-developed cases of pleuropneumonia are spectacular, and the lesions are often more chronic than suggested by the clinical history. Massive amounts of fibrin and malodorous serofibrinous exudate fill the pleural space, and may form cavitating masses encased in maturing fibrous tissue. Most cases of pleuritis in horses arise from underlying pulmonary lesions, although the lesions of pneumonia are overshadowed by the pleural exudate. Although often described as lung abscesses, the lung lesions are more usually localized areas of consolidation. Lesions in the lung are often unilateral, and the pleural exudate in these cases is also usually unilateral. Occasionally, pleuritis extends from bilateral lesions of bronchopneumonia, which may include localized areas of thrombosis and infarction. \n\nStrangles is an acute contagious disease of horses characterized by inflammation of the upper respiratory tract and abscess formation in the regional lymph nodes. The disease commonly occurs in young horses following exposure to carriers or diseased horses. Clinical signs may include purulent nasal discharge, inappetence, fever, depression, unilateral or bilateral swelling of the throat region, stertor, and dysphagia.\n\nStrangles is caused by Streptococcus equi ssp. equi, a Lancefield group C streptococcus closely related to S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus. Unlike S. equi spp. zooepidemicus, which may infect a variety of species, S. equi spp. equi only infects horses. A range of virulence factors has been described. The hyaluronic acid capsule is necessary for virulence, mediates binding of the bacterium to host cells, and confers resistance to phagocytosis. The M protein and a factor-H-binding protein bind fibrinogen and prevent deposition of complement factor C3b, thereby blocking recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages. Two endopeptidases cleave immunoglobulin G. Peptidoglycan activates complement by the alternative pathway, inciting recruitment of neutrophils to sites of infection. The fact that many of the recruited neutrophils rapidly undergo necrosis may be an effect of streptolysin-S and another cytotoxin.\n\nStreptococcus equi in exudates can survive for many months in the external environment, and may be transmitted through contaminated drinking water or by fomites. The initial source of infection, however, is usually a carrier animal or one with active but not necessarily obvious clinical disease. The incubation period of strangles is 3-4 days, although it may be as short as 2 or as long as 15 days. The pathogenesis of the infection involves rapid transport of bacteria from the tonsil to local lymph nodes, within 3 hours after experimental infection. S. equi spp. equi only transiently colonizes nasopharyngeal epithelial cells; therefore attempts to culture the bacteria from nasopharyngeal samples can be fruitless in the face of an active infection. Following entry of the bacteria into regional lymph nodes, there is chemotaxis of neutrophils to the infected lymph nodes. The organism resists phagocytosis, leading to further increases in the number of neutrophils, neutrophil\n\nCoccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, and pneumocystosis are described elsewhere. Pulmonary aspergillosis is an uncommon disease of horses, and usually represents hematogenous spread of fungal hyphae resulting from colitis, as a consequence both of neutropenia and disruption of the mucosal barrier. Lesions are multifocal embolic pneumonia, often centered on pulmonary vessels, and include neutrophil and fibrin exudate in alveoli, hemorrhage, necrosis, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Septate branching hyphae are most common at the periphery of foci of necrosis (Fig. 5-70) .\n\nEntomophthoromycosis (phycomycosis) is a chronic nasal or cutaneous disease of horses, sheep, and rarely of cattle caused by Conidiobolus coronatus, C. lamprauges, and Basidiobolus haptosporus (class Zygomycetes, order Entomophthorales), which are saprophytic fungi limited to tropical and subtropical climates. The nasal lesions are most common in the nostril, but can form larger masses obstructing the nasal cavity and invading adjacent tissues, including the retro-orbital space. The lesions in sheep are described to most consistently affect the ethmoid conchae. Lesions invade adjacent tissues, including the sinuses, retro-orbital space, or brain, and may spread to lung, brain, and other tissues. The masses consist of ulcerating and cavitating granulomas containing coral-shaped granules. Histologic evaluation reveals eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and giant cells. Fungal hyphae are numerous mainly in the brightly eosinophilic amorphous granules (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon). The hyphae of C. coronatus and C. haptosporus appear with H&E stain as unstained filaments within the eosinophilic amorphous material; a silver stain reveals them to be nonpigmented, commonly septate, Glanders. Glanders is caused by Burkholderia mallei and typically affects horses, donkeys, and mules. It is now mostly of historic importance, having flourished when horses played a larger role in human transport and military campaigns and has disappeared from many countries, but still exists in Eastern Europe, Asia, and South America. Natural disease occurs in carnivores, sheep, and goats, whereas cattle and pigs are considered more resistant. Humans are susceptible, and glanders is a potential bioterrorist threat. B. mallei is sensitive to the external environment, and infection is acquired directly or indirectly from excretions and discharges of affected animals.\n\nIn the absence of definitive information, it is assumed that the organisms traverse the pharyngeal mucosa, and perhaps the intestinal mucosa, and are conveyed to the lungs, where lesions almost always occur. From there, hematogenous spread is believed to result in nasal, cutaneous, and lymph node lesions.\n\nGlanders is characterized by nodular lesions in the lungs, and ulcerative and nodular lesions of the skin and respiratory mucosa. Lung lesions are often present as generalized pinpoint to 2-cm diameter pyogranulomatous nodules throughout the lung, often with central areas of liquefactive necrosis. Histologically, the nodules are composed of a central core of neutrophils, often with necrosis of neutrophils and liquefaction of the tissue, and a peripheral rim of epithelioid macrophages and fibrosis. The relative proportions of neutrophils, macrophages, fibrosis, and mineralization are variable.\n\nNasal lesions are often unilateral, with copious, purulent, green-yellow exudate. Multiple small nodules in the submucosa each consist of an inner core of neutrophils and a periphery of macrophages. The core liquefies and the overlying mucosa may slough, leaving a crateriform ulcer that heals to form a white stellate scar. Similar pyogranulomatous ulcerative lesions line the pharynx, larynx, and trachea. Hematogenous metastases are common in the spleen and less common in other tissues. Enteric lesions are rare. The cutaneous lesions of glanders are termed \"farcy.\" These consist of chains of nodules or ulcers that follow lymphatic vessels, and represent purulent lymphangitis with extensive leukocyte necrosis. \n\nMycoplasma spp. Although several mycoplasmas have been isolated from the respiratory tract of horses, particularly Mycoplasma equirhinis and M. felis, there have been no studies to determine whether they are capable of causing pneumonia. M. felis is an uncommon cause of fibrinous pleuritis without pneumonia, and lesions were reproduced by intrapleural inoculation of M. felis. M. felis has also been associated with outbreaks of lower respiratory tract disease in horses, based on seroconversion and isolation of the organism. Wood JL, et \n\nCanine distemper. Canine distemper is caused by a Morbillivirus (family Paramyxoviridae). Although now uncommon in countries with well-vaccinated dog populations, it continues to be a frequent and serious disease in many parts of the world. Canine distemper virus (CDV) infects a wide range of terrestrial carnivores, including Canidae (wild and domestic dogs), Mustelidae (ferrets, mink), and Procyonidae (raccoons); ferrets are particularly susceptible. Some species of seals are vulnerable to CDV infection, and distinct closely related phocid morbilliviruses are also important causes of distemperlike disease in these species.\n\nAs with the closely related morbilliviruses, measles virus and rinderpest virus, CDV is a large, 150-250 nm diameter, irregularly shaped virus composed of an outer lipoprotein envelope, an inner matrix, and a nucleocapsid containing single-strand negative-sense RNA. The envelope is studded with hemagglutinin glycoproteins that mediate viral attachment to host cells, and fusion glycoproteins that allow penetration of host cells and fusion of infected cells with uninfected cells.\n\nVirus is shed in secretions of the respiratory tract, and to a lesser extent in other secretions. Infection is usually acquired by inhaling aerosols or by close contact with infected dogs. The virus infects macrophages of the upper respiratory tract or lungs, which convey it to local lymph nodes and tonsils during the first 24 hours. The virus replicates further in local lymphoid tissues, and by 2-5 days after exposure is present in lymphoid tissues throughout the body, including bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and intestinal lymphoid tissue.\n\nClinical signs of fever, depression, and anorexia develop about 5 days after infection. At this stage of viremia, virus particles are free in the plasma as well as within blood mononuclear cells. Further development of the disease is highly dependent on the immune status of the host, the titer of antibodies to irregular in contour, 5-13 \u00b5m or 5-20 \u00b5m diameter, respectively, and irregularly branched. PAS stains are not considered useful. Pythium insidiosum (an aquatic fungus-like oomycete pathogen) induces a lesion in horses, cattle, and sheep that is similar to entomophthoromycosis, but eosinophils are numerous, and the hyphae are 2-7 \u00b5m diameter, thick walled, and infrequently septate. However, pythiosis and entomophthoromycosis are difficult to differentiate histologically, and definitive diagnosis requires culture, PCR testing, or immunohistochemistry. The differential diagnoses for eosinophilic cutaneous or nasal masses in horses include habronemiasis and mast cell tumor.\n\neFigure 5-97 Echinococcus equinus cyst in the lung of a horse. The 2-cm cyst contains fluid and scant hydatid sand (right).\n\neFigure 5-98 Echinococcus equinus cyst in the lung of a horse. Three layers of the cyst wall: inner germinal membrane with mineralized corpuscles (arrow), acellular laminated layer, outer adventitial layer of reactive host tissue. sure, hyperplasia of histiocytic cells develops, but repopulation of the node by lymphocytes may be delayed for weeks or months. Thymic atrophy is due both to loss of cortical thymocytes as well as great reduction in the medulla.\n\nRespiratory tract lesions are common. Grossly, serous, catarrhal, or mucopurulent exudate covers the nasopharynx. The lungs are edematous, and secondary bronchopneumonia is often present, particularly in subacute or chronic cases. The specific lesion of canine distemper is bronchointerstitial pneumonia, which usually appears as patchy, generalized, red-tan, rubbery lesions beneath the pleura and at the margins of the lung. Generalized diffuse reddening and consolidation is a less common manifestation. Histologically, bronchioles contain scant suppurative exudate, there is patchy necrosis and attenuation of bronchiolar epithelium, and lymphocytes are present around bronchioles. Inclusion bodies are often most obvious in the cytoplasm of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells (eFig. 5-99). Alveoli contain protein-rich edema fluid, scant fibrin, mononuclear cells, and necrotic epithelial cells. Alveolar septa are thickened by mononuclear cells. Proliferation of type II pneumocytes, which occasionally contain cytoplasmic inclusions, may form a complete cuboidal lining to scattered groups of alveoli. Inclusion bodies are common in type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages, and alveolar epithelial syncytial cells are a characteristic feature when present. Chronic lesions in subpleural and peribronchiolar alveoli include macrophage accumulation, type II pneumocyte proliferation, and alveolar septal fibrosis. Inclusion bodies tend to persist in the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium longer than in other nonneural tissues.\n\nIntracytoplasmic and rarely intranuclear inclusion bodies are regularly found within swollen transitional epithelial cells of the urinary bladder and renal pelvis in the acute systemic disease. Inclusion bodies, mild degenerative changes, and mononuclear cell infiltrates may be present in a variety of other epithelia, including the gastric surface epithelium, chief and parietal cells of the stomach, cholangiolar epithelium in the liver, pancreatic ductular epithelium, epididymis, and testis.\n\nIn the central nervous system, the virus appears first in perivascular astrocytes and macrophages, but infection of the choroid plexus epithelium occurs early, and the cerebrospinal fluid contains large amounts of virus. Lesions in the white matter and grey matter differ histologically; these may occur concurrently or one may predominate. Demyelination in white matter tracts is most severe in the cerebellum, rostral medullary velum, optic tracts, spinal cord, and surrounding the fourth ventricle, and probably arises from distribution of virus through the cerebrospinal fluid. The lesions are multifocal or patchy in distribution, with vacuolation of the neuropil, loss of myelin (particularly notable with Luxol fast blue stain), and, in the early stages, preservation of axons. Astrocytes usually contain nuclear and, less frequently, cytoplasmic inclusions, and astrocyte-derived syncytia are present in a minority of cases. As the lesion progresses, gliosis and axonal degeneration may occur, and mononuclear cells infiltrate the lesion in low numbers; however, the early lesion is noninflammatory. Animals that survive may be left with sclerotic astrocytic foci and myelin loss.\n\nGrey matter lesions, which are less frequent than those in white matter, often target the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. In early stages, inclusion bodies are usually present in the nucleus or occasionally in the cytoplasm envelope glycoproteins, the age of the host, and the strain of virus. Dogs with adequate humoral and cellular immunity are able to neutralize the virus and clear the infection by 14 days after infection, and may not shed virus from mucosal surfaces. In dogs with intermediate levels of cellular and humoral immunity, viremia leads to infection of mucosal epithelium and brain. Virus is shed in secretions, but clinical signs attributable to epithelial infection may be minor or absent, although neurologic disease may develop in these partially immune dogs. Dogs that fail to mount an adequate immune response develop systemic infection of epithelial tissues that evokes clinical signs of respiratory and enteric disease, infection of the central nervous system, and shedding of virus in respiratory secretions, feces, and urine.\n\nClinical disease in dogs is most common at 12-16 weeks of age, as puppies with waning passive immunity are exposed to subclinically infected dogs. The infection is systemic, and clinical signs are often referable to the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems. Ocular disease, pustular and/or hyperkeratotic cutaneous lesions, dental defects, and abortion are other manifestations. In some cases, clinical signs are primarily caused by secondary infections that are a consequence of virus-induced immunosuppression, probably an effect of viral infection of lymphocytes and macrophages. Secondary infections include Bordetella, adenovirus, Pneumocystis, Toxoplasma, Clostridium piliforme, Sarcocystis, Encephalitozoon, and enteric infections with Cryptosporidium or attaching-and-effacing E. coli.\n\nThe systemic form of the disease often begins with fever and conjunctivitis, and rapid progression to coughing, depression, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea. Affected dogs may die at this stage, fully recover, or develop neurologic disease 1-4 weeks later. Neurologic disease may also be the primary clinical manifestation, particularly in animals with partial immunity. Neurologic manifestations are quite variable, depending on the anatomic location of the lesions, and include seizures, cerebellar or vestibular ataxia, paraparesis or paraplegia, and myoclonus.\n\nThe histologic lesions of canine distemper are fairly specific when the disease is well developed, particularly if inclusion bodies are apparent. However, lesions in mild cases are nonspecific, particularly in dogs with clinical signs limited to the upper respiratory tract. Inclusion bodies are most numerous 10-14 days after infection, but their numbers diminish rapidly by 5-6 weeks. Inclusions are most obvious in brain and epithelial tissues, and less easily identified in lymphoid tissues. Inclusion bodies can be found in the central nervous system before changes of encephalomyelitis are present, and they often persist in the neural tissue when they have disappeared from other sites. The inclusion bodies are eosinophilic and often intranuclear in nervous tissue but usually intracytoplasmic in other tissues.\n\nLymphopenia and lesions in lymphoid organs are regularly present. Lymphoid lesions may be inapparent on gross examination, or there may be either atrophy or edematous swelling. Thymic atrophy is a particularly common finding in CDVinfected puppies. The earliest lesions following experimental infection with CDV consist of depletion of lymphocytes in the cortical zone of the lymph nodes within 6 days of infection. By day 9, the lymph nodes and spleen contain lymphocytic necrosis and depletion, and infiltration of neutrophils. Syncytial cells may form in the lymph nodes, and these often contain inclusion bodies. Approximately 2 weeks after expo-eFigure 5-99 Canine distemper. A. Bronchial epithelium is hyperplastic and contains numerous cytoplasmic inclusions. B. Bronchiolar epithelium is attenuated (arrows). Alveoli are lined by type II pneumocytes (asterisks) and contain lymphocytes and macrophages.\n\nA Canine parainfluenza. Canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) (genus Rubulavirus, family Paramyxoviridae) causes clinical signs 3-10 days after experimental infection, mainly of fever and hacking cough typical of infectious tracheobronchitis. Virus is shed in nasal secretions for about 8 days after infection. Lesions are of tracheobronchitis and bronchiolitis, with epithelial vacuolation and necrosis, mixed cellular inflammatory infiltrates, and submucosal edema. Subacute and chronic lesions include bronchitis and bronchiolitis with epithelial hyperplasia and occasionally bronchiolitis obliterans. The virus does not replicate in macrophages and does not induce significant bronchointerstitial pneumonia in immunocompetent dogs. Canine parainfluenza virus can act as a primary pathogen, but mainly causes disease in conjunction with Bordetella infection. In addition, CPIV-2 predisposes to bacterial pneumonia by impairing mucociliary clearance, and increases the bronchoconstrictive response to agonists such as histamine. Infection has been shown to impair olfaction in the absence of nasal lesions; the clinical significance of this intriguing phenomenon is unknown. Ellis Canine respiratory coronavirus. Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) infection was first identified as a cause of respiratory disease in 2003, and occurs mostly in situations of frequent contact with other dogs. The causative virus is in the genus Betacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, and is thus related to bovine coronavirus. In contrast, enteric or pantropic canine coronavirus is an alphacoronavirus. CRCoV infections cause mild upper respiratory tract disease, leading to nonspecific clinical signs of coughing and nasal discharge. Following experimental infection with CRCoV, viral shedding from the oropharynx has been detected for up to 10 days using RT-PCR and by virus isolation for up to 6 days postinfection.\n\nCRCoV preferentially infects canine respiratory epithelial cells, including ciliated cells and goblet cells in the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. The reported lesions include shortening or loss of cilia on ciliated cells and a modest inflammatory response, mainly in the upper respiratory tract, with only minor lesions in the lung. Diagnosis of CRCoV infection can be made using ELISA and immunofluorescence. Serology, using paired sera 2-3 weeks apart, is valuable to follow animals during an outbreak of CIRD. Mitchell JA, et al. Tropism Old dog encephalitis is a rare variant, possibly caused by infection with replication-defective virus. This syndrome is characterized by chronic progressive neurologic disease, widely distributed perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells, and intranuclear inclusions in astrocytes and neurons. Viral antigen may be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, but virus cannot be isolated from the brain. Canine distemper may occasionally result from administration of modified live CDV vaccines. Neurologic disease is the usual manifestation in these cases, and lesions in the grey matter include neuronal necrosis, intranuclear inclusions, and lymphocytic encephalitis.\n\nDental lesions follow infection of young animals with CDV. Necrosis and cystic degeneration of ameloblastic epithelium of the developing tooth, associated with syncytia and cytoplasmic inclusions, give rise to the defective enamel seen in animals that have recovered from infection. The defects vary from focal depressions to large, sharply demarcated areas of enamel hypoplasia.\n\nOcular lesions include conjunctivitis, keratitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis. Conjunctivitis is very common in the early stages of disease, and occasionally extends to the cornea to cause ulcerative keratitis. Retinal lesions, which are common following systemic infection, include intranuclear inclusions in ganglion cells and glia, degeneration of ganglion cells, photoreceptor loss, retinal edema, and perivascular cuffs of mononuclear cells. These lesions progress to neuronal loss, retinal scarring, and proliferation of retinal pigment epithelium in the chronic stages. Lesions in the optic nerve are inconstant, but papilledema may be observed in acute cases, and gliosis or demyelinating neuritis in chronic ones.\n\nCutaneous lesions of hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis may affect the footpad and nose, and rarely the haired skin. The epidermis may contain syncytial cells, and nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Pustular dermatitis caused by secondary pyoderma may be present. Experimentally infected dogs commonly develop bone lesions, with necrosis of osteoclasts and consequent persistence of the primary spongiosa. Pale streaks in the heart caused by multifocal myocardial necrosis and mineralization are described in association with canine distemper.\n\nThe histologic findings are characteristic if a spectrum of lesions is present and inclusion bodies are discovered. Rabies and poxviruses are the other causes of intracytoplasmic inclusions in dogs, but the clinical and pathologic findings in these diseases are usually distinct from canine distemper. Other viruses causing inclusion bodies in bronchiolar or airway epithelial cells include canine adenovirus 2, canid herpesvirus 1, and canine minute virus (canine parvovirus 1). Confirmation of the diagnosis benefits from a diversity of diagnostic options, including virus isolation, immunohistochemistry, indirect immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, and PCR. Canid herpesvirus 1 is occasionally isolated from dogs with acute respiratory disease, although systemic disease in neonatal puppies is a more common manifestation. Aerosol challenge of 12-week-old dogs caused necrotizing rhinitis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, and multifocal alveolar necrosis with infrequent eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies. Intraperitoneal inoculation of neonatal puppies with the same viral strain caused necrosis and hemorrhages in many organs, supporting the contention that the manifestation of disease is dependent on the route of exposure and the age of the host. Herpesviruses are infrequently isolated from dogs with kennel cough, either alone or with other infectious agents. The respiratory lesions are those to be expected from herpesviruses, namely necrotizing rhinotracheitis and possibly bronchopneumonia. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions can sometimes be found in epithelial cells in early lesions, particularly in nasal mucosa.\n\nOther canine respiratory viruses. Several viruses representing diverse taxonomic origins have recently been identified in respiratory tissues of dogs with mild respiratory disease. These viruses are canine pneumovirus, canine hepacivirus, and canine bocavirus. Their causal role in canine respiratory disease is thus far inconclusive. Pantropic canine coronavirus, an alphacoronavirus (related to feline coronaviruses and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, but more distantly to betacoronaviruses, including canine respiratory coronavirus) mainly causes enteric and neurologic disease but has been associated with necrotizing bronchiolitis and pulmonary vascular necrosis.\n\nCanine adenovirus 2 (CAV-2) is serologically related to, but genetically distinct from, CAV-1, the cause of infectious canine hepatitis. The contribution of CAV-2 to CIRD complex is assumed to be similar to CPIV-2 discussed previously. Naturally occurring adenoviral pneumonia is rare in dogs, and is usually a consequence of immunosuppression. Gross lesions may be cranioventral or disseminated, lobular or confluent, and consist of atelectasis, reddening, edema, and mild firmness. Amphophilic intranuclear inclusions are present in alveolar macrophages, type II pneumocytes, and airway epithelium. Bronchioles contain necrotic epithelial cells and suppurative exudate, and macrophages, neutrophils, and fibrin are present in alveoli. Peribronchiolar and interstitial infiltrates of lymphocytes occur but are not prominent. mediate motility, iron scavenging, and urease and phosphatase activity.\n\nSecreted toxins are important contributors to bordetellosis. The adenylate cyclase toxin (hemolysin) is an RTX toxin, like Mannheimia haemolytica leukotoxin and the Apx toxins of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. The RTX domain of the toxin forms pores in target cell membranes that permit transfer of the adenylate cyclase component. Entry of this toxin into leukocytes causes increased cyclic AMP production that impairs phagocytosis and oxidative burst.\n\nOther virulence factors that are not regulated by the bvg operon include a lipo-oligosaccharide with endotoxin activity and a soluble peptidoglycan-derived tracheal cytotoxin. The latter is not directly toxic to tracheal epithelium, but stimulates host cells to produce nitric oxide that in turn induces ciliostasis and apoptosis of ciliated epithelial cells.\n\nB. bronchiseptica can adhere to macrophages and neutrophils, probably by binding of FHA to complement receptors on macrophages. Following adhesion, the bacteria are internalized and survive within macrophages without inciting an oxidative burst, and may induce apoptosis of these cells through secretion of the adenylate cyclase toxin. In addition, Bordetella is able to enter and survive within nonphagocytic cells, presumably affording protection from host defenses and a ready supply of nutrients.\n\nAlthough mucosal antibody responses are detectable within 4 days of infection, and the duration of clinical illness is usually only 2-3 weeks, Bordetella infections often persist for 2-3 months, and infected dogs may remain a source of infection for others in the kennel. Immune responses to B. bronchiseptica confer partial protection against subsequent challenge. FHA and pertactin are immunodominant antigens, and mucosal antibody responses to these antigens are partially protective.\n\nStreptococcus zooepidemicus (\u03b2-hemolytic, group C) is an opportunistic pathogen causing bronchopneumonia as described previously. It is also notable for causing outbreaks of fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia in dogs. Affected dogs have fever, depression, and dyspnea, with a rapidly progressive fatal course. The typical pathologic findings are acute hemorrhagic pneumonia, in some cases with bloody thoracic and mediastinal fluid. Gram-positive cocci are histologically visible, and thrombosis and fibrin exudation may be present; neutrophils can be few or many, presumably dependent on the rapidity of disease progression. Clusters of bacteria may also be observed in spleen and renal glomeruli. Exotoxins perhaps acting as superantigens are thought to play a role in development of disease, and the degree of host cytokine production may also be important.\n\nExPEC, which produces cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1, \u03b1-hemolysin, and other toxins, can be isolated from the lungs of dogs and cats following a very rapid clinical course that leads to death in 24-48 hours. In laboratory dogs, an association with recent arrival at the facility is described. Infection is thought to reach the lung by inhalation or via the blood, and does not apparently result from aspiration of gastrointestinal content. The gross distribution of ExPEC pneumonia may be bilateral, unilateral, or asymmetrical, and multifocal, diffuse, or patchy. The characteristic features are extensive hemorrhage, coagulative necrosis, thrombosis, and aggregates of tiny coccobacilli. Some lesions have very few leukocytes despite the presence of many bacteria, whereas others have more typical infiltration of neutrophils. Necrotizing lesions may be present in liver and other organs. Definitive diagnosis is based on identification of toxin genes in the bacterial isolate.\n\nBordetella bronchiseptica is a gram-negative coccobacillus that is commonly carried in the upper respiratory tract, but not the lungs, of healthy dogs, cats, and many other domestic animals. It can act as a primary pathogen, causing tracheobronchitis and occasionally pneumonia, but causes more frequent and more severe disease in polymicrobial infections with viruses, mycoplasmas, and other bacteria. Some animals are affected by tracheobronchitis and develop persistent, harsh, nonproductive or productive coughing, but are otherwise clinically normal. Most of these cases recover spontaneously, although signs can persist for 3 weeks or longer. Other cases develop bacterial pneumonia with lethargy and dyspnea; only half of affected dogs have fever or leukocytosis. The gross and histologic findings are similar to bronchopneumonia caused by other bacteria, with the unique finding of cilia-adherent bacteria in the large airways of some cases. These appear as a densely fibrillar layer covering the respiratory epithelium, and are highlighted by Warthin-Starry silver stain or Gram stain (Fig. 5-71 ).\n\nThere is considerable genetic diversity among strains of B. bronchiseptica, but the relation of genetic variation and virulence remains an area for exploration. The expression of virulence factors of Bordetella is dependent on environmental conditions, regulated by the Bordetella virulence gene (bvg) operon. In vitro, such virulence genes are repressed at 25\u00b0 C or in the presence of sulfate or nicotinic acid, and activated at 37\u00b0 C. After entering the host, a first wave of bvg-regulated genes expressed, including those encoding the adhesive proteins filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin, and fimbriae that allow B. bronchiseptica to attach to ciliated epithelial cells. Following attachment of bacteria to the mucosal surface, a second wave of bvg-regulated genes is expressed that \n\nRhinosporidiosis. Rhinosporidiosis is a disease of humans and dogs, and rarely of other domestic mammals and fowl. The disease is endemic in wet tropical and subtropical environments, uncommon in North America and Africa, and rare in Europe. It has been determined by molecular analyses that the causative agent, Rhinosporidium seeberi, is not a fungus, but is a member of the Mesomycetozoa or so-called \"DRIP\" clade of aquatic protistan parasites. The agent can be cultured only with specialized techniques. Infection results from exposure of nasal mucosa to contaminated water.\n\nThe typical lesion is a single unilateral nasal polyp, which is soft, pink, up to 3-cm diameter, and bleeds easily. Histologic investigation reveals epithelial hyperplasia, loose fibrous tissue, lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, and sporangia of R. seeberi (Fig. 5-73 ). Juvenile sporangia are 15-75 \u00b5m diameter, contain a single nucleus, and have a unilamellar PAS-positive wall. Mature sporangia, which may be visible grossly as pinpoint white foci, are 100-500 \u00b5m diameter with a bilamellar wall, and contain numerous 5-10 \u00b5m diameter endospores. The large size of the sporangia and the presence of endospores might only be mistaken for Coccidioides, and finding such structures in a nasal polyp is considered diagnostic.\n\nMycotic rhinitis. Mycotic rhinitis is common in dogs and occasionally diagnosed in other species. Cases may be presented with variable combinations of chronic sneezing, stertor, unilateral or bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge, nasal hemorrhage, and nasal pain. Distortion of nasal bones may occur, and extension of infection to adjacent structures may rarely induce exophthalmos or neurologic disease. Blastomycosis. Blastomycosis is an infectious noncontagious disease primarily of dogs and humans, with fewer cases in cats, horses, and other species. The disease occurs primarily in North America, with occasional cases in Africa, Europe, Asia, and Central America. Endemically infected areas in North America include the Mississippi, Ohio, and St. Lawrence River valleys, northern Ontario in Canada, and the mid-Atlantic States in the United States.\n\nBlastomyces dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus. At environmental temperatures, it grows as a mycelial form and produces spores that are infectious to animals. The ecologic source of the mycelial form is uncertain, but is associated with acidic sandy soils. Recently disturbed soil is a recognized factor in some outbreaks, and geographic clustering of cases is well documented. At body temperatures, the fungus grows as a yeast form that is not contagious. Although the potential exists for mycelial forms to grow in cooled tissue specimens, reports of infection acquired at autopsy are rare and have been caused by accidental penetrating wounds rather than inhalation.\n\nVirulence factors of B. dermatitidis are poorly described. BAD-1 is a surface protein that mediates adhesion to host cells, may modulate the inflammatory response, and is an immunodominant antigen. Antibody responses to BAD-1 reduce disease severity, but are not completely protective. The cell-wall polysaccharide \u03b1-glucan is associated with virulence and may protect against killing by macrophages.\n\nInfection is usually acquired by inhalation of spores into the lung, where they rapidly transform to the yeast form. Local inoculation may be the cause of the rare lesions that are restricted to the skin. Experimentally infected dogs develop a much higher prevalence of lesions than for other systemic mycoses, although in most the disease is mild and resolves without treatment. Subclinically infected dogs are apparently rare. Yeast forms proliferate in the lungs and disseminate via the blood and lymphatic vessels. Naturally infected animals may have suppression of humoral and cellular immune responses but, as for other systemic mycoses, this probably represents an effect rather than a cause of the disease. Most animals do not have pre-existing immunosuppressive conditions. T-helper-1 immune responses have been associated with protection in mouse models, and immune responses target cell-wall components, including BAD-1.\n\nThe lung is the most consistently affected site. Grossly, there is generalized multifocal distribution of 3-mm to several-centimeter diameter, coalescing, grey-white nodules of granulomatous inflammation . Most pulmonary nodules are firm throughout, but some undergo central caseation and resemble abscesses. Such foci may fistulate into a bronchus or onto the pleura. Mineralization is minimal or absent. Microscopically, coalescing granulomas are formed by epithelioid macrophages, histiocytic giant cells and variable numbers of neutrophils, an outer layer of lymphocytes and less reactive macrophages, and often a peripheral rim of fibrous tissue (see Fig. 5-74) . In some cases, there is extensive caseous necrosis in the centers of the granulomas, with merely a thin rim of macrophages. Yeast bodies are quite variable in number and may be overlooked if only H&E-stained sections are examined; in cases treated with antifungal drugs or with partial immunity, a diligent search of sections stained by the periodic acid-Schiff reaction or with methenamine silver may be required to reveal the fungi. The yeast forms are 5-15 \u00b5m (or occasionally up to 30 \u00b5m) diameter, round, nonencapsulated, with a distinct wall about 1-\u00b5m thick, and granular protoplasm completely or partly filling the center (see Fig. 5-74) . The double contour of the wall that is well described in cytologic preparations or culture imprints is often A B C inapparent histologically. Occasional yeast display broad-based budding of single daughter cells. Filamentous or pseudohyphal forms and conidia are infrequently found in tissues, and are usually accompanied by yeast forms. Disseminated lesions are common in lymph nodes, eyes, skin and subcutaneous tissues, bones, and joints. Testes, prostate, brain, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and other organs are less commonly affected. The lesions are either granulomas with numerous epithelioid and giant cells, or pyogranulomatous foci with central accumulation and necrosis of neutrophils and macrophages.\n\nDemonstration of the yeast bodies in tissue section or in cytologic preparations is the usual method of diagnosis. Blastomyces is readily differentiated from other fungi in culture, but safety precautions must be in place because infection of laboratory personnel by the cultured mycelia is well documented. An immunoassay to detect B. dermatitidis galactomannan has become a widely used clinical test; the sensitivity to detect the fungal antigen was 94% for urine and 87% for serum. Serologic tests are available, but false negatives are common.\n\nThe differential diagnosis for multinodular lesions in lung and other organs includes other systemic mycoses and metastatic neoplasia. Examination of impression smears or histologic sections may be needed to distinguish neoplasia from mycoses. Morphologic features are usually adequate to differentiate Blastomyces from other fungi: Cryptococcus neoformans usually has a thick capsule and only a mild inflammatory response, Histoplasma capsulatum at 2-4 \u00b5m is much smaller and resides in the cytoplasm of macrophages, and Coccidioides immitis at 20-200 \u00b5m is much larger and often contains endospores. Mutants of Cryptococcus that lack the characteristic thick capsule may closely resemble Blastomyces and incite a similar granulomatous response, but the presence of narrow-based budding differentiates them from Blastomyces which divides by broad-based budding. Blastomyces, Cryptococcus, and Histoplasma are reliably differentiated in culture by the presence and morphology of mycelia, conidia, and yeast. Davies JL, et laboratory conditions. Cryptococcus neoformans, the usual cause of disease in temperate climates, is a saprophyte found in soil, pigeon or other avian guano, and decaying organic matter. C. gatti historically was found mainly in tropical climates, but is now considered to have a global distribution and is an important cause of disease in humans and dogs, especially in the Pacific Northwest of North America. C. neoformans and C. gatti exist in these environments in a filamentous form known as a teleomorph, with the name Filobasidiella neoformans and F. bacillosporus, respectively; this form of the organism undergoes both sexual as well as asexual reproduction in the environment. Based on genome sequence information C. neoformans is subdivided into types VNI, VNII, VNIII, and VNIV, and C. gatti is divided into VGI, VGII, VGIII, and VGIV. Where the agents fall in this classification scheme is of more than academic interest, as the pathogenicity and response to therapy varies by subtype of the organisms. Dogs are primarily infected with C. neoformans (except in regions with high endemicity for C. gatti, i.e., the Pacific Northwest of North America), whereas C. gatti is more frequent in cats. Most infected animals do not develop clinical disease. Immune suppression, such as from corticosteroid therapy or pre-existing infections, often underlies C. neoformans infections, but C. gatti is a primary pathogen and may infect hosts without known immune deficiencies. Infection is usually acquired by inhalation of basidiospores or desiccated yeast from contaminated dust. These small forms are inhaled into alveoli, where replication can occur with subsequent spread hematogenously or locally to other organs, such as the brain, eyes, lymph nodes, skin, and other organs. Occasional cases of cutaneous cryptococcosis are probably the result of local inoculation, and cryptococcal mastitis in cows is an ascending rather than hematogenous infection.\n\nThe major virulence factors of Cryptococcus are the capsule and the production of melanin. The thick capsule, composed of glucuronoxylomannan and other mannose-rich polysaccharides, impairs phagocytosis, activates complement, and may suppress T-cell responses. The role of the capsule in concealing the yeast from the immune response is highlighted by uncommon strains of Cryptococcus that lack a capsule; these are readily phagocytosed, incite a strong granulomatous response, and are generally minimally pathogenic. Most strains consistently produce a capsule in tissues, but its thickness is variable in cultures. The ability to synthesize melanin when grown on specific substrates is associated with virulence, and attributed in part to the enzyme phenoloxidase (laccase). Melanin and/ or phenoloxidase may scavenge oxygen radicals produced by activated macrophages, and modulate the host immunoinflammatory response. Other potential virulence factors include secretion of eicosanoids and mannose protein that modulate immune and inflammatory responses, and production of superoxide dismutase and laccase that augment resistance to oxidative killing.\n\nImmunity to Cryptococcus is dependent on delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, in which IFN-\u03b3 and other cytokines elicit and activate macrophages and perhaps neutrophils to kill the yeast by using reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates. In addition, cytotoxic T-cell responses may directly limit viability or proliferation of this pathogen.\n\nLesions take the form of gelatinous masses, granulomas, or ulcerating nodules. Facial swelling is a common feature of cryptococcal rhinitis of cats. Infection may spread locally from the nasal cavity to involve the skin, oral mucosa, eyes, or brain, Cryptococcosis. Cryptococcosis is a mycotic disease of worldwide distribution caused by Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gatti. Cryptococcosis is the most common systemic mycotic disease of cats, and it also affects dogs, horses, cattle, humans, and many other species. Disease is sporadic and, as is generally true for the systemic mycoses, the infection is apparently neither contagious nor zoonotic. Many cases have chronic nasal disease, with sneezing and serous or mucopurulent discharge. Other common manifestations include ulcerating cutaneous nodules, encephalitis, chorioretinitis or panophthalmitis, and pneumonia.\n\nCryptococcus spp. are basidiomycete yeast-like fungi. Unlike the dimorphic fungi Blastomyces and Coccidioides, the sexual mycelial phase of Cryptococcus does not occur under normal terrestrial and aquatic mammals; in addition, it is a persistent and serious health issue in humans living in these areas. In veterinary medicine, the disease primarily affects dogs, is less common in horses and cats, and may cause incidental pulmonary lesions in cattle and swine. Clinical manifestations in dogs include fever; chronic respiratory disease with coughing, weight loss, and eventual respiratory distress; visceral disease causing anorexia, weight loss, and malaise; draining cutaneous nodules; lameness resulting from osteomyelitis; ocular disease; and heart failure resulting from myocardial or pericardial lesions. Nodular skin disease is the most common presenting sign in cats. Clinical findings in horses include chronic weight loss, pulmonary disease, and lameness resulting from osteomyelitis.\n\nCoccidioides is a geophilic dimorphic fungus. The mycelial form survives well in dry hot conditions, grows after periods of intense rainfall in soil containing fecal or other organic matter, and releases arthroconidia that are disseminated widely in wind-blown dust after the soil desiccates. Inhalation of airborne arthroconidia is the usual route of infection; local inoculation occasionally causes a cutaneous lesion that does not usually progress to systemic infection. Although most animals in endemic areas probably become infected during their life, relatively few develop disease. Following deposition in the lung, the arthroconidia transform into the yeast form. Immature spherules are 10-20 \u00b5m diameter; as they mature, the spherules (or sporangia) enlarge up to 200 \u00b5m diameter and develop numerous 2-5 \u00b5m endospores (Fig. 5-76) . Mature spherules rupture, and the released endospores form either new spherules in tissue or mycelia if released to the environment. Infection of autopsy personnel has been attributed to inhalation of aerosolized tissue endospores, although the paucity of such cases suggests the risk is limited.\n\nLesions may be limited to the lungs, where they vary from nodular to miliary. The pyogranulomas or granulomas are greywhite nodules that often contain a caseous or liquefying center. Large nodules may be formed by a collection of small discrete granulomas separated by fibrous tissue. The initial reaction to the infectious forms-inhaled arthroconidia and endospores released from mature spherules-is primarily suppurative. The lesion forms a pyogranuloma or granuloma as it matures, with epithelioid macrophages, a few giant cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. In diagnostic cases, the lesions mainly appear as multifocal areas of necrosis with few spherules, and granulomatous or pyogranulomatous inflammation in the adjacent tissue. Formation of discrete granulomas is less frequent. In cattle, spherules are often enmeshed in eosinophilic material similar to the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon; this may reflect the higher level of resistance of this species.\n\nSystemic lesions develop from hematogenous spread from the lung. Cases with systemic lesions that lack pulmonary involvement are thought to reflect resolution of the lung disease rather than an extrapulmonary route of infection. Tracheobronchial lymph nodes are often enlarged and reactive, but generalized lymphadenopathy is uncommon. Nodular lesions in the skin develop draining tracts or form fluctuating abscesses. Osteomyelitis often occurs late in the disease, with osteolytic granulomatous or cavitating masses surrounded by proliferating new bone tissue. Granulomatous lesions may be present in the pericardium or the heart and cause right-sided heart failure. Granulomas in the central nervous system are most common in cerebrum and midbrain. Ocular lesions and occasionally there is wider dissemination to local lymph nodes, lung, and other viscera. Skin lesions are often nodular and ulcerative. Visceral lesions consist of multifocal discrete white gelatinous lesions. Gross lesions in the brain are often subtle, but may include gelatinous material in meninges and ventricles.\n\nThe prominent histologic lesion is a mass of yeast, and the abundant nonstaining capsular material lends a \"soap bubble\" appearance to the lesion. In contrast to other mycotic infections, the granulomatous reaction is often quite minimal, presumably because the capsule masks the yeast from recognition by phagocytes. C. neoformans yeast bodies are 4-8 \u00b5m diameter, plus a capsule that varies from 1-30 \u00b5m thick (Fig. 5-75 ). Occasional yeast have single buds that are attached by a thin stalk; this narrow-based budding differentiates Cryptococcus from Blastomyces.\n\nThe diagnosis is usually based on identifying the yeast in histologic sections or cytologic smears. The thick capsule is characteristic, C. neoformans being the only pathogenic fungus with a capsule, and it can be further identified with mucicarmine. In wet mounts, the capsule can be identified by negative staining with India ink. The yeast bodies stain with periodic acid-Schiff or methenamine silver stains, and melanin production may be demonstrated with Masson-Fontana stain. Culture is required for definitive diagnosis. Detection of antibodies to capsular antigen in serum or cerebrospinal fluid is a useful method of clinical diagnosis. Lester SJ, et al Coccidioidomycosis. Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the dimorphic fungi Coccidioides immitis or C. posadasii, is endemic in the semiarid Lower Sonoran life zone of the southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. The fungus can apparently infect all mammals, with reports of disease occurring in a variety of Other fungal infections. Adiaspiromycosis is primarily a disease of wild rodents, but rarely affects domestic animals and humans. The causative agents, Emmonsia parva and E. crescens (formerly Chrysosporium spp.), are dimorphic fungi related to Blastomyces. Lesions are most common in the lung but occasionally involve local lymph nodes, and consist of nodules of granulomatous inflammation. The diagnosis is based on finding adiaspores-large, spherical, uninucleate conidiain the nodules (Fig. 5-77 ). The adiaspores of E. parva are often 10-20 \u00b5m diameter, whereas those of E. crescens may be up to 300-\u00b5m diameter. Both have a thick (5 \u00b5m) PASpositive wall. Their large size and thick wall might be mistaken for Coccidioides, but endosporulation is not a feature of Emmonsia.\n\nLycoperdon spp. (puffball mushrooms) release large numbers of spores to the environment, and inhalation of these spores by dogs incites a multifocal pyogranulomatous reaction include chorioretinitis, retinal detachment, anterior uveitis, and keratitis. Other organs affected include liver, spleen, kidney, and testes. Abortion and mastitis are described in horses.\n\nThe diagnosis is usually established by identifying the spherules in tissue sections, although they are usually present in low number. The large size and endosporulation of the mature spherules is characteristic, and can only be confused with Rhinosporidium seeberi. Culture is a useful method of definitive identification; safety precautions are essential because arthroconidia are easily detached from the mycelial form and are highly infectious for laboratory personnel. Serum antibodies to Coccidioides immitis can be detected in most cases, particularly in the acute stages of disease, and high titers suggest active disease. Carnivores are infected by eating the infected viscera of herbivores, and the nymphs migrate to the nasal passages, where they mature. The parasites may be found anywhere in the nasal cavity, and occasionally, they find their way into the paranasal sinuses or pass via the Eustachian tube to the inner ear. They lie on the surface of the nasal mucosa and induce nasal irritation and a catarrhal to lightly blood-stained exudate. The gravid females discharge a large number of eggs that are removed by sneezing. The larvae of Linguatula or pentastomids of other species develop in the alimentary tract of the intermediate host and migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes and other organs, where they develop into infective nymphs within cysts that are encircled by inflamed fibrous tissue. The nymphs have histologic features of arthropods: pseudosegmented body, a chitinous cuticle with sclerotized openings, striated muscle, and a body cavity, as well as numerous brightly eosinophilic glands, and prominent villi lining the cuboidal epithelial cells in the intestine. Eucoleus aerophilus. Eucoleus aerophilus (Capillaria aerophila) is a trichurid nematode (order Enoplida, superfamily Trichuroidea, family Trichuridae) that parasitizes the trachea and bronchi of wild canids, domestic dogs, and occasionally cats. The worms are slender, 2-3 cm long, and embedded in the airway mucosa. Histologic examination reveals characteristic features: bacillary bands, which are segmental thickenings of the hypodermis; a stichosome, which is a deeply basophilic gland encircling the esophagus; and the possible presence of embryonated eggs. The eggs are laid in the airways, move with mucus to the pharynx, are swallowed, and passed in the feces. The eggs are oval with characteristic bipolar plugs, and closely resemble those of Trichuris vulpis of the intestine or Pearsonema (Capillaria) plica of the urinary bladder. The larvae undergo initial development in the egg, and then progress to the infective stage within earthworms, which are a required intermediate host. Eggs also hatch in ~40 days under suitable environmental conditions, but the resulting larvae are apparently not infective. After ingestion of the earthworm, the larvae reach the lungs in ~1 week and are mature in the trachea in ~25 days. Most infestations of E. aerophilus are inapparent and provoke only mild catarrhal inflammation. Heavy infestations cause more severe irritation that may result in obstruction of the lumen of the airways. Chronic coughing and intermittent dyspnea may then be observed, and secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia may occur.\n\nA related trichurid, Eucoleus (Capillaria) boehmi, is reported occasionally in the nasal cavity and sinuses of wild canids and rarely in domestic dogs. \n\nPneumonyssoides caninum is a parasitic mite of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses of dogs. The prevalence is ~20% in Scandinavian dogs, but it appears to be less common in other areas. The female adult mite is motile, oval, light yellow, and 1-1.5 mm long. The mites are presumably transmitted by direct contact. They are usually an incidental finding, but clinical signs include sneezing, head shaking, and impaired olfaction. The mites induce catarrhal rhinitis and sinusitis with goblet cell hyperplasia, hyperemia, and infiltration of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. Pneumonyssoides is, in addition to allergic rhinitis, a consideration in cases of eosinophil-rich inflammation in the nasal mucosa. Linguatula serrata: pentastomiasis. Linguatula serrata, a parasitic arthropod, is of wide geographic distribution. Adult pentastomes are large, long-lived, specialized hematophagous parasites of the respiratory tracts of reptiles, amphibians, and carnivorous mammals. They are related to but distinct from the arthropods. The adults of L. serrata are transversely striated and tongue shaped (hence the name). Males are ~2 cm in length and females 1.0-1.2 cm. The definitive hosts are carnivores, but in aberrant parasitisms, herbivores and humans Crenosoma vulpis. Crenosoma vulpis is a common lungworm of foxes, but also occurs in other canids, including domestic dogs, perhaps in mustelids, but not in cats. It is a nematode of the superfamily Metastrongyloidea, family Crenosomatidae, and snails and slugs are intermediate hosts. Adult worms reside in bronchioles and small bronchi. After a prepatent period of 18-21 days, adults produce larvae that are coughed up, swallowed, and passed in the feces. The usual gross lesions in dogs are gray consolidation of the caudodorsal lung. Histologically, the lesions caused by adult worms are catarrhal, eosinophilic bronchitis and bronchiolitis. Aspirated larvae may induce a granulomatous reaction in alveoli. Angiostrongylus vasorum. Angiostrongylus vasorum occurs in endemic foci in parts of Western Europe, and is also reported in Uganda, South America, Eastern Asia, and Atlantic Canada; reports suggest the prevalence is increasing in Europe. Clinical expression of angiostrongylosis varies from mild to severe respiratory disease; cor pulmonale may develop in response to chronic pulmonary vascular disease and lung fibrosis. Other less common clinical signs include neurologic signs referable to cerebral hemorrhage as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation, as well as miscellaneous signs that reflect aberrant migration of larvae in a variety of organs.\n\nA. vasorum is a nematode of the superfamily Metastrongyloidea, family Angiostrongylidae. Adults inhabit the pulmonary arteries and right ventricle of dogs and foxes. Eggs pass via the blood to the lungs, where the larvae hatch, penetrate into alveoli, are coughed up and passed in the feces. The prepatent period is 38-57 days. Snails and slugs serve as intermediate hosts, and frogs can be paratenic hosts.\n\nLesions during the prepatent period are mild. Adult, 14-21 mm long worms are present in the pulmonary arteries, and the lungs contain a few 1-2 mm red nodules, consisting of aggregates of eosinophils and mononuclear cells. The females have a \"barber-pole\" appearance because of the helically arranged red gut and white ovaries. Angiostrongylus can be differentiated from Dirofilaria by examination of intact adults, or by histologic examination. Angiostrongylus adults are 270-350 \u00b5m diameter with thin coelomyarian musculature, a large, strongylid intestine composed of few tall multinucleated cells, and eggs in the uterus. In contrast, Dirofilaria has welldeveloped coelomyarian musculature, a smaller intestine, and a uterus containing microfilariae.\n\nMore severe lesions develop at the time of patency, including proliferative endoarteritis in response to the adult worms in the pulmonary arteries, and eosinophilic and granulomatous pneumonia as a consequence of embolized eggs and larvae. Arterial lesions include thrombosis, thickening of the tunica intima by fibromuscular tissue and numerous eosinophils, Oslerus osleri. Oslerus (Filaroides) osleri is of wide geographic distribution and is common in wild canids. The tracheal nodules are uncommonly encountered during bronchoscopy or autopsy of domestic dogs, and they rarely cause clinical signs of chronic coughing or dyspnea. Most infestations occur in dogs <1 year of age, and are acquired from the dam through grooming or regurgitative feeding.\n\nO. osleri is a 5-15 mm long nematode of the superfamily Metastrongyloidea, family Filaroididae. The thin-walled embryonated eggs are coughed up and swallowed and many hatch before being passed as infective larvae in the feces. Unlike other metastrongyles, the Filaroididae do not require an intermediate host. The first-stage larvae of O. osleri are immediately infective, and pups are infected by ingestion of larvae in the saliva, tracheobronchial secretions, or feces of their dams. Larvae migrate from the gut through the blood to the lung. They develop into fifth-stage larvae by 5 weeks after infection, and the tracheal nodules are detectable at 10 weeks and well developed by 18 weeks. The caudal end of the gravid female protrudes through the epithelium, and the eggs are laid onto the tracheal surface.\n\nThe typical lesions are single or multiple, 1-10 mm diameter, firm, grey-pink, sessile or polypoid, submucosal nodules in the trachea and bronchi, often in the region of the tracheal bifurcation ( Fig. 5-78 ). The larger masses are oval, with the long axis parallel to that of the trachea. On careful inspection, coiled worms are visible through the intact overlying mucosa.\n\nThe nodules are formed by coiled adult or fifth-stage larval nematodes lying in tissue spaces in the lamina propria, and the nodules are often encircled by fibrous tissue. The adults have coelomyarian musculature, a gut formed by a few multinucleated cells with indistinct microvilli, and larvae or embryonated eggs within the uterus. The live worms provoke little reaction apart from a few lymphocytes and plasma cells. Dead worms incite a foreign-body reaction with neutrophils and giant cells. Immature worms, probably still migrating toward the trachea, may be found in the pulmonary lymphatics and occasionally in the alveoli without significant tissue reaction. The diagnosis is based on identifying the adults in histologic or crush preparations of the tracheal nodules, or discovering larvae in smears of tracheal mucus or Baermann preparations of feces. Andersonstrongylus milksi. Andersonstrongylus milksi (Angiostrongylus milksi, Filaroides milksi) is a metastrongylid nematode in the superfamily Metastrongyloidea, family Angiostrongylidae. The literature related to this parasite is confusing, because the diagnosis in many reports is exclusively based on histologic lesions. However, examination of intact worms, which are difficult to tease from the lung, is required to definitively differentiate A. milksi from F. hirthi. A molluscan intermediate host has been proposed, but the life cycle is unknown. Adults inhabit the bronchioles and the alveoli, and the gross and histologic lesions are similar to those caused by Filaroides hirthi. Larvae may also be found in the brain, abdominal viscera, and other organs.\n\nDirofilaria immitis is described elsewhere (see Vol. 3. Cardiovascular system). The microfilariae may be encountered as incidental findings in pulmonary vessels, or elicit thrombosis ( Fig. 5-79 ) or eosinophilic and granulomatous pneumonia.\n\nInfluenza viruses adapted to cats have not been described, but cats are susceptible to disease arising from human H1N1 and avian H5N1 and H7N7 viruses. Inhalation results in similar lesions as in other species, with lesions mainly affecting the alveolar epithelium. Ingestion of H5N1-infected chicken liver induces systemic infection with targeting of endothelial cells, widespread hemorrhages, and multifocal necrosis in lymphoid tissues and many other organs. Similarly, cats infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus develop tracheobronchitis, necrosis and inflammation of tracheobronchial glands, and diffuse alveolar damage. Cowpox virus mainly causes skin lesions in cats, with rare cranial lung lesions containing necrosis, epithelial hyperplasia, syncytial medial hypertrophy, and lymphoplasmacytic aggregates in the adventitia. Pulmonary lesions consist of red or golden-brown, nodular or confluent areas of hemorrhage, edema, and firmness at the periphery of the lung. Histologically, coalescing granulomas are formed by macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, and giant cells, and are sometimes centered on parasite eggs and larvae. Larvae are about 10 \u00b5m wide, whereas eggs are about 100-\u00b5m diameter, and contain either basophilic and eosinophilic granular material or embryos (larvae). There is mild proliferation of type II pneumocytes, alveolar hemorrhage, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and arteriolar thrombosis. Fibrosis and recanalization of arterial thrombi develop as the lesion ages. Similar granulomas are reported in brain, kidney, and other tissues.\n\nCoagulation abnormalities are the second most common clinical manifestation associated with angiostrongylosis. The abnormalities are suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation, with increased prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time or prothrombin time, thrombocytopenia and increases in circulating D-dimer and fibrin degradation products in affected dogs. The pathogenesis of the coagulopathy is not well understood, but may represent thrombosis triggered by parasite proteins or endothelial damage from the adult and larval nematodes. Petechiae and ecchymoses may develop in tissues of such dogs; as noted above, a small percentage of dogs may have severe neurologic signs from intracerebral hemorrhage. but does occur. This contrasts with the frequent finding of vesicular to ulcerative lesions on tongue, hard palate, or nostrils with feline calicivirus infection. Ocular involvement is usually limited to purulent conjunctivitis, but it can progress to ulcerative keratitis.\n\nMicroscopically, large eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies are present in many virus-infected cells during the period of active viral replication from 2-7 days after infection . They may be found in lesions from cats dying of the disease, but are rarely detected beyond 7 days after infection. Infected cells undergo hydropic change with cytoplasmic swelling and pallor. There is loss of epithelial organization, and the disrupted epithelium is soon eroded or ulcerated. An acute inflammatory reaction develops with exudation of fibrin and many neutrophils. Repair may be delayed for up to 17 days after infection, and the epithelial tissue undergoes squamous metaplasia as it repairs.\n\nResorption of nasal turbinate bones along with new bone formation and fibroplasia has been described in both natural and experimental infections, mainly in cats <6 months of age, and may lead to chronic nasal disease by impairing clearance of opportunistic pathogens. Focal necrosis accompanied by acute inflammation may be found in tonsils and local lymph nodes. Erosive lesions may occur in stratified squamous epithelium of the nares or the tongue.\n\nPulmonary involvement is uncommon except in fatal cases. In fulminant FeHV-1 infections, there is widespread multifocal necrotizing tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and diffuse alveolar damage, with extensive serofibrinous flooding of airspaces. Inclusion bodies are identified in airway epithelial cells. Necrosis of pulmonary blood vessels is rarely described, with viral antigen in the vessel wall. Secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia is a more common complication of FeHV-1 infection than is primary viral pneumonia.\n\nSystemic disease is uncommon in FeHV-1 infection, in contrast to the analogous alphaherpesvirus infections of young calves and dogs. Ocular lesions are described elsewhere. Experimental infection of pregnant queens produces abortion and generalized neonatal disease, but this has been difficult to identify in natural outbreaks. Multifocal hepatic, pancreatic, and adrenocortical necrosis are the expected features of systemic disease. A syndrome of nasofacial ulcerative dermatitis and stomatitis with histologic lesions of eosinophilic inflammation and infrequent epithelial intranuclear inclusion bodies may be associated with corticosteroid therapy or crowding. Necrosis accompanied by inclusion bodies has also been found in sites of osteogenesis in a wide variety of bones of kittens after intravenous inoculation. Degeneration of olfactory nerve fibers and focal lymphocytic infiltration of the olfactory bulbs have occurred in experimentally infected, germ-free cats, but the extent of lesions in the brain has not been properly documented.\n\nThe major differential diagnosis for upper respiratory disease in cats is feline calicivirus infection. Other contributors of minor or uncertain significance include Chlamydophila felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Mycoplasma spp. Diagnosis of FeHV-1 using PCR assays is a sensitive test to detect viral nucleic acid in tissues. If necessary, this diagnosis can be confirmed by virus isolation. Finding eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies amid necrotizing lesions of respiratory epithelium is usually sufficient for diagnosis in postmortem samples, but as discussed previously, it is not uncommon to miss the period when viral inclusions are apparent. Several cells, and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in epithelial cells.\n\nClinical signs are most common in kittens but occur regularly in adult cats, probably because of recrudescence of latent infections. Morbidity may be high in naive populations of kittens, but mortality is generally low, and most cats recover in 10-14 days. Clinical signs include fever, oculonasal discharge, sneezing, coughing, and anorexia. Chronic rhinitis and sinusitis is a frequent and serious sequela caused by intermittent reactivation of latent infections, loss of respiratory defenses caused by excavation of nasal conchae, or failure of drainage of sites of secondary bacterial infection in the sinuses.\n\nGeneral features of herpesviruses are described in the section Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. FeHV-1, like other alphaherpesviruses, causes cytolytic infections of mucosal epithelial cells and establishment of latency in the trigeminal ganglion, optic nerve, olfactory bulb, and cornea. Reactivation of latent infection is often of unknown cause, but may be triggered by corticosteroid therapy, stresses associated with environmental changes, or parturition. The virus replicates optimally at temperatures <37\u00b0 C; thus most infections are limited to the upper respiratory tract and conjunctiva.\n\nFeHV-1 is transmitted by contact with infected nasal or ocular secretions, or by aerosol. Transmission by fomites may occur, but the virus survives for <18 hours under most environmental conditions. The host range is limited to felids, including a variety of species of wild cats. The incubation period is short, typically just 2-4 days. In most cases, infection is restricted to the nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, sinuses, and tonsils, with lesser viral replication in the conjunctiva and upper trachea. Viremia may occur in neonates, but is not common in older kittens. It is likely that most cats recovering from the disease remain latently infected, and perhaps 20-40% of these cats intermittently shed infective virus during periods of stress, such as following a change in housing, or during lactation; recrudescence may also be triggered by corticosteroid therapy.\n\nThe distribution of gross lesions corresponds to the predilection sites for viral replication-the epithelium of nasal passages, pharynx, soft palate, conjunctivae, tonsils, and to a lesser extent trachea. The initial serous inflammation becomes mucopurulent or fibrinous within a few days, and crusting is often present around the eyes and nares. Multifocal erosions of the nasal mucosa are covered by mucoid or mucopurulent exudate. The trachea may contain hemorrhage or fibrinous exudate. Tonsils are enlarged and contain petechiae or rare foci of necrosis. The regional lymph nodes are usually enlarged, reddened, and edematous. Ulceration of the tongue is uncommon (VS-FCV) infection is a rare manifestation. VS-FCV occurs in individual cats or emerges as a localized epizootic. The disease is highly contagious and rapidly fatal, affecting both kittens and adult cats, even those previously vaccinated. Affected cats develop edema and ulcers, mainly on the head, limbs, footpads, and inguinal region. Subcutaneous edema, with foci of fat necrosis, pancreatitis with peripancreatic fat necrosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, intestinal crypt necrosis, single-cell necrosis of hepatocytes, and interstitial pneumonia are all reported in VS-FCV infections. The disease has been experimentally reproduced, suggesting that viral factors are at least partly responsible for increased virulence, but this has not been correlated with specific genomic sequences.\n\nThe pathogenesis of VS-FCV is poorly understood. It is often impossible to distinguish FCV infection from other causes of upper respiratory tract infection in cats, particularly felid herpesvirus 1 and Chlamydophila. The finding of oral ulcers is suggestive of calicivirus infection although FeHV-1 can cause similar lesions. In contrast to the bronchointerstitial pneumonia caused by FeHV-1, airway lesions are usually not present in FCV infection. Toxoplasmosis, sepsis, and aspiration of gastric acid are additional causes of interstitial pneumonia in cats. The lesions are, in most cases, not etiologically specific, and definitive diagnosis requires laboratory support. PCR and virus isolation are widely used to detect FCV in tissues. and immunohistochemistry is useful to localize viral antigen in tissue sections.\n\nFeline calicivirus. Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a common cause of upper respiratory tract disease that can also cause oral ulcers, chronic stomatitis, pneumonia, systemic disease, or lameness. Infection with FCV is widespread, with 15-25% of cats being subclinical carriers. Morbidity is often high, particularly in kittens, but most cats recover from clinical disease. Clinical signs are variable and include serous or mucopurulent nasal and ocular discharge, oral ulcers, conjunctivitis, sneezing and coughing, anorexia, and fever. FCV is a non-enveloped, 35-40 nm, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus in the genus Vesivirus, family Caliciviridae. Open reading frames 1, 2, and 3 encode a helicase, a protease, and polymerase; the single capsid protein; and an RNA-associated structural protein, respectively. The capsid protein is the target of protective immune responses, but hypervariable regions in this gene confer antigenic variability that allows viral persistence in the face of a developing immune response.\n\nTransmission is by direct contact with infected oronasal secretions, and fomites are a potential source of infection. The clinical manifestation of the disease likely depends on the strain of the virus, the immune status of the host, and the route of infection. The incubation period varies from 2-14 days, and many cats recover in 7-14 days after onset of illness. However, viral infection persists despite resolution of clinical signs, and 25% of infected cats continue to shed virus for months or years. These cats are important sources of infective virus for naive cats or those with immunity to other strains of calicivirus. Occasionally, these chronically infected cats develop chronic lymphoplasmacytic and/or ulcerative stomatitis that is refractory to therapy.\n\nIn addition to upper respiratory infections, ulcerative stomatitis may occur. The oral ulcers, which begin as vesicles that rapidly rupture, are most often present on the dorsal surface or lateral margins of the tongue and on the hard palate. Cutaneous ulcers may occur on the nares and the muzzle.\n\nCaliciviral pneumonia is an uncommon occurrence. Pneumonia is more likely following aerosol rather than oronasal exposure, and specific strains of FCV may have tropism for the lungs. Gross lesions are irregularly distributed but often include the margins of the cranioventral lung. The virus causes lytic infection of type I pneumocytes, resulting in acute to subacute interstitial pneumonia. Hyaline membranes may be present, and the alveoli often contain serofibrinous exudate and neutrophils. As the lesion heals, type II pneumocytes proliferate and form a cuboidal lining of the alveoli, and alveolar septa are thickened by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and fibrous tissue in the later stages. Miscellaneous parasites. Mammomonogamus sp. nematodes are reported to infect cats. Depending on the species of nematode, infection may occur in the nasal sinuses, larynx, and trachea. Infection is mostly reported in cats in the Caribbean. Eucoleus aerophilus is described in the section Infectious respiratory diseases of dogs, previously. Oslerus rostratus is a viviparous parasite of cats that causes sinuous thickenings of the walls of large bronchi, formed by adult worms within cystic spaces. When the adults die, they provoke intense infiltration of neutrophils, with eventual mineralization and fibrosis.\n\nTroglostrongylus brevior and T. subcrenatus are metastrongyloid (Crenosomatidae) nematodes that reside in the trachea and bronchi of cats. In heavily infected cats, clinical signs consist of dyspnea, tachypnea, and coughing. Catarrhal inflammation within the airways and bronchopneumonia may develop in response to the parasites. The lifecycle of this parasite is not completely known, but likely involves L1 larvae being passed in the feces of infected cats and infecting terrestrial molluscs, where they develop into L3 larvae to be consumed by cats or a variety of paratenic hosts. Brianti E, et For more information, please visit the companion site: PathologyofDomesticAnimals.com muscle (see eFig. 5-93). Bronchial glands and smooth muscle in the media of small pulmonary arteries and arterioles may be quite prominent in cats infected with Aelurostrongylus, but these changes are also common in clinically healthy cats that have no evidence of parasitism.\n\nRolim Paragonimus kellicotti. Of the trematodes, the only genus that has its final habitat in the lungs is Paragonimus. P. kellicotti occurs in America, and P. westermanii in Asia. Mink and other fish-eating carnivores are the usual hosts of P. kellicotti, but it infects many other species. Among domestic animals, it is most commonly found in cats and occasionally in dogs. Clinical signs are usually absent in animals with paragonimiasis.\n\nThe life cycle of the parasite is typical of trematodes. The first intermediate hosts are small aquatic snails. The second intermediate host is a freshwater crab or crayfish. When the crayfish is eaten by the definitive host, the metacercariae are liberated in the intestine and migrate across the peritoneal and pleural cavities to the lungs. Their passage through the pleura is marked by multiple small hemorrhages and foci of eosinophilic and fibrinous pleuritis that heal as small umbilicated scars. Adult flukes are ovoid, red-brown, and up to 17 mm long. They are often found in pairs in inflammatory cavitations in the pulmonary parenchyma and occasionally in the bronchi. The cavitations frequently communicate with bronchioles, permitting liberation of eggs into the airways, expulsion to the nasopharynx, and passage in the feces.\n\nThe cavitations, which are more common in the caudal lobes, are spherical, 1-3 cm diameter, soft, and dark red-brown . The cavitations contain intense eosinophilic and granulomatous inflammation, hemorrhage with numerous hemosiderin-laden macrophages, a fibrous capsule, and adult flukes. The adults exhibit characteristic features of trematodes: the body is filled with loose parenchyma, but there is no body cavity, paired ceca contain dark pigment, oral suckers are present in some sections, the tegument has surface spines, and vitellaria beneath the tegument contain eosinophilic globular yolk material. In patent infections, there are numerous 80-100 \u00b5m long, yellow-brown, operculate eggs, which persist as fractured shells in chronic lesions (eFig. 5-110; see Fig. 5 -81, eFigs. 5-106 to 5-109). As cavitations mature and establish connections with bronchioles, they become partially lined by cuboidal epithelium to form true cysts. At this stage, bronchioles contain eggs and eosinophilic exudate, with hyperplasia of peribronchiolar glands and smooth muscle. Other lesions include chronic catarrhal eosinophilic bronchiolitis, granulomatous pleuritis, and pleural lymphangitis associated with the presence of eggs. Rupture of the cysts causes pneumothorax, which may lead to acute respiratory distress.\n\nWeina PJ, England DM. The American lung fluke, Paragonimus kellicotti, in a cat model. J Parasitol 1990;76:568-572. The cat died of respiratory distress, presumably from pneumothorax resulting from rupture of the bronchus-associated cyst, but the chronic inflammatory reaction in the parietal pleura suggests prior leakage of cyst contents.
