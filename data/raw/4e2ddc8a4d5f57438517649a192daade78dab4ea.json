{"title": "Regulation of the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of viral and cellular proteins by ubiquitin and small ubiquitin-related modifiers", "body": "The replication of many viruses (particularly DNA viruses and retroviruses) involves nuclear steps (Griffin et al., 2007) . Even for viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm (e.g. many negative-stranded RNA viruses), it is not uncommon for specific viral proteins to enter the nucleus during certain stages of infection to achieve specific functions such as antagonising the host's immune activation (Katze et al., 2002; Ramachandran and Horvath, 2009; Goodbourn and Randall, 2009) or global inhibition of host gene expression (Petersen et al., 2000; von Kobbe et al., 2000) . The nuclear import and export of viral proteins depend on the host cell machinery and are subject to regulation by pathways that normally modulate the trafficking of cellular proteins, including post-translational modifications. Conjugation of modifying groups such as phosphate, acetyl group, ubiquitin (Ub), and Ub-like molecules is a rapid and efficient way of modulating the properties of proteins after their synthesis (Ulrich, 2005) . Particularly, Ub and small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs) have drawn much attention in recent years due to their roles in diverse biological functions (Denuc and Marfany, 2010; Liu and Walters, 2010) . Although the regulatory functions of Ub and SUMO in the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of cellular proteins have been extensively studied (Wilson and Rangasamy, 2001; Shcherbik and Haines, 2004) , their involvement in viral protein trafficking has been only recently appreciated. In this review, we will summarise our current knowledge on Ub-and SUMO-regulated nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of cellular proteins and give a few examples of how these pathways are exploited by viruses.\n\nFor proteins larger than 30 kDa, efficient trafficking across the nuclear membrane requires transporters and depends on the presence of specific nuclear import/export signals (G\u00fcttler and G\u00f6rlich, 2011; Jamali et al., 2011) . In most cases, these signals are recognised by import or export receptors of the karyopherin-\u03b2 family either directly or via an adapter (Sorokin et al., 2007) . The best-characterised nuclear import pathway involves importin \u03b1/\u03b2, which mediates the nuclear translocation of nuclear localisation signal (NLS)-containing cargoes in a Ran-dependent manner, as illustrated in Figure 1 . Similarly, the export transporter chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM-1; or exportin 1) mediates the nuclear export of a large number of cargoes containing nuclear export signals (NESs) [steps (5) and (6) in Figure 1 ]. For a comprehensive review of the nuclear import/export machinery, readers are referred to Moroianu (1999) , Sorokin et al. (2007) and Jamali et al. (2011) . In addition, the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of many proteins is also subject to regulation by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation (Jans and H\u00fcbner, 1996; Wilson and Rangasamy, 2001; Shcherbik and Haines, 2004) .\n\nUbiquitin is a small 76-amino-acid protein modifier that is covalently attached to the substrate protein usually via an acceptor lysine residue. Ub conjugation occurs by the sequential action of three enzymes: (i) a Ub-activating enzyme (E1), (ii) a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2) and (iii) a Ub ligase (E3), which determines substrate specificity and the type of conjugation (e.g. monoUb versus polyUb, K48-versus K63-linked Ub). The ubiquitination machinery has been reviewed in Kerscher et al. (2006) . Though initially described as a regulator of protein degradation (Wilkinson et al., 1980) , Ub is now known to play important roles in a broad spectrum of cellular activities such as intracellular protein trafficking, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis (Shcherbik and Haines, 2004; Liu and Walters, 2010) .\n\nSUMO's involvement in nuclear trafficking was initially suggested by its first known substrate, Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 (RanGAP1), which is a part of the nuclear import/export machinery (Cole and Hammell, 1998; Fried and Kutay, 2003) . Unmodified RanGAP1 is diffused in the cytoplasm, whereas SUMO conjugation targets it to the nuclear pore complex, where it regulates protein/RNA trafficking across the nuclear membrane (Matunis et al., 1996; Mahajan et al., 1997; Matunis et al., 1998) . Since then SUMO has been associated with the nuclear/subnuclear targeting of various cellular proteins (discussed below). The vertebrate genome encodes at least four SUMO isoforms, namely SUMO1-4. Similar to ubiquitination, SUMOylation is a three-step process involving an E1-activating enzyme heterodimer Aos/Uba2, an E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and substrate-specific E3 ligases (reviewed in Gareau and Lima, 2010) .\n\nGiven that proteins can be modified by both Ub and SUMO, sometimes on the same lysine residue, it is not surprising that these two modification systems communicate. Indeed, the interaction between Ub and SUMO pathways is complex and could be either competitive, cooperative or differential (Ulrich, 2005; Denuc and Marfany, 2010) . In the following section, we will briefly summarise examples of cellular proteins whose nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is regulated by Ub and/or SUMO and discuss the crosstalk between the two pathways so as to provide a better context when we later review viral exploitation of these pathways.\n\nUbiquitination is usually associated with cytoplasmic localisation via promoting either nuclear export or cytoplasmic retention. The best-characterised example is the tumour suppressor gene p53 (reviewed in Shcherbik and Haines, 2004; Stehmeier and Muller, 2009; Lee and Gu, 2010) . P53 is ubiquitinated on its six C-terminal lysine residues by the E3 Ub ligase Mdm2 (Honda et al., 1997; Rodriguez et al., 2000; Lohrum et al., 2001; Nakamura et al., 2002) . Although polyubiquitination results in proteasomal degradation, monoubiquitination by the same E3 ligase leads to nuclear export (Li et al., 2003) [pathways (1) and (2) in Figure 2 ]. It has been postulated that Ub modification induces a conformational change, leading to unmasking of the NES which resides in the proximity of the Ub sites (Shcherbik and Haines, 2004) . Once in the cytoplasm, p53 can be deubiquitinated by the deubiquitinase USP10, resulting in its translocation back to the nucleus (Yuan et al., 2010) [pathway (3) in Figure 2 ]. Polyubiquitination of transcription factors Sma-and MAD-related protein 3 (Smad3) and hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF\u03b1) has also been linked to their export from the nucleus and termination of transcriptional activation (Fukuchi et al., 2001; Groulx and Lee, 2002) . Alternatively, ubiquitination can favour cytoplasmic localisation by inhibiting nuclear import, which is exemplified in the case of CTP-phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT-\u03b1). The regulatory enzyme CCT-\u03b1 can switch between an inactive form in the cytoplasm and an active form in the nucleus. It possesses an NLS located in close proximity of the putative ubiquitination site. By using CCT\u03b1-Ub hybrid constructs that vary in the intermolecular distance between Ub and the NLS, the authors showed that monoubiquitination masks the NLS, resulting in the disruption of importin-\u03b1 binding and consequently a blockage in the nuclear import (Chen and Mallampalli, 2009 ).\n\nThere are currently few examples of Ub playing a direct role in the nuclear import of target proteins. A good example is the tumour suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN) (Trotman et al., 2007) . Though no conventional NLSs have been identified in PTEN, the tumour suppressor is able to translocate into the nucleus. Ubiquitination on lysine residue K289 likely plays a role in the nuclear import of PTEN because the K289E mutant, associated with Cowden syndrome, is defective in nuclear import, monoubiquitination, as well as its tumour suppression ability. The authors further identified another monoubiquitination site K13, which is also found to be mutated in spontaneous cancer, as being important for nuclear import.\n\nA list of cellular proteins whose nuclear import/export is regulated by ubiquitination can be found in Table 1 .\n\nIn contrast to Ub, SUMO is usually associated with nuclear/subnuclear targeting. The first identified SUMO substrate RanGAP1 is targeted to the nuclear pore complex and binds to the nucleoporin RanBP2/Nup358 upon SUMOylation (Matunis et al., 1996; Mahajan et al., 1997; Matunis et al., 1998) . Because RanBP2 is part of the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery and itself has SUMO E3 ligase activity (Mattaj and Englmeier, 1998; G\u00f6rlich and Kutay, 1999; , it has been postulated that SUMOylation might be coupled to translocation through the nuclear pore .\n\nExamples of proteins whose intracellular distribution is affected by SUMOylation are listed in Table 1 . In the case of Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), SUMOylation on a site close to the endogenous NES inhibits the NES function and leads to nuclear retention (Du et al., 2008) . SUMO also enhances the nuclear accumulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) (Sehat et al., 2010) , cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB) (Comerford et al., 2003) and C-terminal binding protein of adenovirus E1A (CtBP) (Lin et al., 2003b) . SUMO site mutation favours cytoplasmic localisation in all three cases; however, whether this is mediated through promoting nuclear import or inhibiting nuclear export is not clear. On the other hand, nuclear targeting of promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) per se does not seem to require SUMOylation, as mutating the SUMO site does not prevent its nuclear accumulation. However, SUMOylation of PML is important for its localisation in nuclear bodies (Zhong et al., 2000; Lallemand-Breitenbach et al., 2001) .\n\nThe involvement of SUMO in regulating nuclear export has been suggested by studies of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) (Zhu et al., 2009) and the E-twenty-six family transcriptional repressor TEL (Wood et al., 2003) . In both cases, the putative SUMO site mutants are restricted to the nucleus. However, one caveat is that ubiquitination was not examined in these studies and the observed effect, therefore, could potentially be due to the lack of ubiquitination.\n\nBecause proteins can be modified by both Ub and SUMO, the interaction between the two systems determines the eventual outcome of the modification.\n\nWhen the same lysine residue serves as both Ub and SUMO sites, as seen in the examples of the inhibitor of NF-\u03baB alpha (I\u03baB\u03b1) (Desterro et al., 1998) and von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL) (Cai and Robertson, 2010) , modifications by Ub and SUMO usually have opposing effects on the localisation and functions of the target protein, although there may be exceptions (discussed below). For example, although ubiquitination of I\u03baB\u03b1 leads to its degradation and consequently the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB subunits, SUMOylation leads to its resistance to Ub-mediated proteasomal degradation, resulting in retention of NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm (Desterro et al., 1998) . VHL is SUMOylated by the PIASy E3 ligase, which promotes its nuclear localisation, whereas ubiquitination on the same lysine residue contributes to nuclear export (Cai and Robertson, 2010) .\n\nHowever, ubiquitination and SUMOylation occurring on the same lysine residue do not necessarily lead to antagonistic effects on the function of the target protein, as exemplified by the sequential modifications of the NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO) during genotoxic stress (Huang et al., 2003) . After treatment with DNA-damaging reagents, I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex activation requires the passage of the regulatory subunit NEMO through the nucleus. Although SUMOylation seems to target NEMO to the nucleus, ubiquitination, which occurs at a later time point, results in the shuttling of the protein back to the cytoplasm. In this case, the sequential modifications by SUMO and Ub cooperatively lead to the activation of IKK.\n\nUbiquitin and SUMO also appear to cooperate in regulating the nuclear export of p53. As discussed in the section 'Ub and nuclear import/export,' p53 nuclear export depends on monoubiquitination on C-terminal lysine residues (Lohrum et al., 2001; Li et al., 2003) . Carter et al. (2007) have shown that SUMOylation also plays a role in this process. According to the model proposed by these authors, the attachment of a single Ub serves as an initiation event, allowing for access to the NES and recognition of p53 by SUMO E3 ligases such as PIASy, which leads to further modification of p53 to release Mdm2 and allow nuclear export [pathway (2) in Figure 2 ]. Geoffroy and Hay, 2009) , fly (Barry et al., 2011; Abed et al., 2011a) and mammalian cells (Lallemand-Breitenbach et al., 2008; Tatham et al., 2008; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010) have added yet another layer of complexity to the Ub/SUMO network. STUbLs selectively ubiquitinate SUMOylated proteins and proteins that contain SUMO-like domains, resulting in their deSUMOylation and/or degradation (Prudden et al., 2007) . The presence of STUbLs helps to maintain the delicate balance between SUMOylation and ubiquitination (Abed et al., 2011b) .\n\nViruses are obligate parasites. Because of the extremely limited protein encoding ability of the viral genome, viruses have evolved ways to utilise the host cell machinery, including the Ub/SUMO pathways. One example of viruses exploiting the Ub pathway is the involvement of cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) in the budding of viruses from the multivesicular bodies, which was initially shown for retroviruses (Martin-Serrano et al., 2001; Garrus et al., 2001) and then extended to other viral families (Schmitt et al., 2002; Yasuda et al., 2003; Wirblich et al., 2008) . The interaction between viral proteins and the ESCRT complexes has been extensively studied, and there are a few excellent reviews on this subject (Bieniasz, 2006; Martin-Serrano, 2007; Chen and Lamb, 2008; McDonald and Martin-Serrano, 2009; Gustin et al., 2011) . Here, we will focus on a much lesser known aspect of viral interaction with the Ub/SUMO system: the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of viral proteins by Ub and SUMO.\n\nTo date, the best-characterised example of a viral protein whose nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is regulated by the Ub/SUMO pathways is the Tax protein of the human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma, and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-associated myelopathy (Jeang, 2010; Shembade and Harhaj, 2010) . Tax, a 40 kDa phosphoprotein encoded by the pX region of the virus, is a multifunctional protein that plays key roles in viral replication as well as T-cell transformation (Matsuoka and Jeang, 2011) . It promotes cell survival by constitutively activating the NF-\u03baB family transcription factors via interactions with the components of the pathway at both cytoplasmic and nuclear steps (Nasr et al., 2006) .\n\nTax shuttles between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Burton et al., 2000; Kfoury et al., 2011) . In the nucleus, Tax is predominantly localised to heterogeneous nuclear foci known as Tax speckled structures (TSS), which contain a variety of cellular proteins including transcription factors, splicing cofactors, and DNA damage recognition and cell cycle regulatory factors (Semmes et al., 1996; Bex et al., 1997; Haoudi et al., 2003) . In the cytoplasm, a major fraction of Tax localises to perinuclear structures colocalising with the centrosome or microtubule-organising center in close association with the cis-Golgi compartment (Nejmeddine et al., 2005; Kfoury et al., 2008; Kfoury et al., 2011) . Using a photoconvertible fluorophore (Dendra-2) coupled with live cell confocal microscopy, Kfoury et al. (2011) recently showed that the same Tax molecule can shuttle amongst Tax nuclear bodies as well as between Tax nuclear bodies and the centrosome. This dynamic shuttling is important for its function in interaction with NEMO and activation of NF-\u03baB (Kfoury et al., 2011) . Cellular stress such as UV irradiation induces the translocation of Tax from TSS to the cytoplasm (Gatza and Marriott, 2006; Gatza et al., 2007) . The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Tax is mediated by a non-canonical NLS at the N-terminal (Smith and Greene, 1990; Smith and Greene, 1992; Meertens et al., 2004 ) and a leucine-rich NES (Burton et al., 2000; Alefantis et al., 2003) . However, Tax also undergoes different forms of post-translational modification, including phosphorylation (Bex et al., 1999) , acetylation (Lodewick et al., 2009) , ubiquitination (Nasr et al., 2006; Kfoury et al., 2008) and SUMOylation (Nasr et al., 2006; Kfoury et al., 2011) , all of which are implicated in its functions. Particularly, ubiquitination and SUMOylation have been shown to be involved in its nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (Figure 3 ).\n\nTax is modified by monoUb as well as K48-and K63-linked Ub chains (Chiari et al., 2004; Peloponese et al., 2004; Kfoury et al., 2008) . Although K48 Ub chains lead to Tax degradation, K63 Ub chains mediate binding to NEMO, recruitment of the IKK signalosome to the centrosome and activation of NF-\u03baB (Peloponese et al., 2004; Kfoury et al., 2008) . The ubiquitination sites have been mapped to the C-terminal lysine residues (K263, K280 and K284). Mutating these three K residue results in a dramatic reduction of polyUb and monoUb of Tax, whereas the three N-terminal K residues have minimal effect on Tax Ub (Chiari et al., 2004) . Several groups have shown that ubiquitination of Tax is associated with its cytoplasmic localisation, although whether this is effectuated through promoting nuclear export or cytoplasmic retention is still controversial (discussed below). Gatza et al. (2007) showed that monoUb promotes the nuclear export of Tax in response to DNA damage [pathway (1) in Figure 3 ]. Following UV irradiation, a rapid translocation of Tax from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was observed. The UV-induced translocation correlates with an increase in monoUb of Tax at K280 and K284 residues. The K280/284R double mutant is not ubiquitinated and does not translocate to the cytoplasm after UV treatment. Moreover, fusing a copy of Ub to either the N-terminal or C-terminal of Tax to mimic monoubiquitination induces nuclear export. Interestingly, the nuclear export of the Tax-Ub fusion protein is blocked by leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM-1dependent pathway, indicating that the Ub-induced nuclear export of Tax is still dependent on a functional NES. The authors proposed that monoUb facilitates the dissociation of Tax from TSS in the nucleus, promoting its nuclear export (Gatza et al., 2007) . Lamsoul et al. (2005) also reported that Ub favours cytoplasmic localisation of Tax. Overexpression of Ub results in increased cytoplasmic localisation of Tax, which is phenocopied by fusing one copy of Ub to the C-terminal of the protein. Because co-localisation between Tax and exogenously expressed Ub is observed only in the cytoplasm, the authors concluded that ubiquitination is involved in the cytoplasmic retention of Tax. However, the absence of detectable co-localisation between Tax and Ub in the nucleus does not preclude the possibility that the ubiquitinated species are rapidly exported out of the nucleus.\n\nTax is also SUMOylated on lysine residues that overlap the Ub conjugation sites (Lamsoul et al., 2005; Nasr et al., 2006) . Ub and SUMO seem to have opposing effects on Tax subcellular distribution. Although Ub favours cytoplasmic localisation, as discussed above, SUMO overexpression leads to predominantly nuclear body localisation. SUMOylation seems to be required for targeting Tax to nuclear bodies [pathway (2) in Figure 3 ] because Ub/SUMO site mutants fail to localise to nuclear speckles, and nuclear body formation can be restored by C-terminal fusion of SUMO but not Ub (Lamsoul et al., 2005) . Kfoury et al. (2011) showed later that Ub fusion to the same K mutants can restore nuclear body localisation as well, suggesting that Ub can also target Tax to nuclear bodies [pathway (3) in Figure 3 ]. The discrepancy between the two studies possibly stems from the different cell types used (293T cells in the Lamsoul paper versus HeLa cells in the Kfoury paper) because the localisation of Tax is known to be cell type dependent (Alefantis et al., 2003) . The nuclear retention induced by SUMOylation is possibly via NES masking, in agreement with an earlier report suggesting that the Tax NES likely exists as a conditionally masked signal (Alefantis et al., 2003) .\n\nDespite their opposing effect on Tax localisation, Ub and SUMO are both required for NF-\u03baB activation. They control critical cytoplasmic and nuclear steps of NF-\u03baB activation, respectively. Ubiquitinated Tax binds to the IKK complex and induces its activation, leading to the degradation of I\u03baB and nuclear translocation of Rel A, whereas SUMOylated Tax recruits Rel A to Tax nuclear bodies, promoting its complete transcriptional activation (Nasr et al., 2006) .\n\nBesides HTLV-1 Tax, the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of a few other viral proteins has also been linked to Ub and/or SUMO. Examples are listed in Table 2 and will be briefly discussed below.\n\nAdenovirus type 5 E1B-55K protein-The 55 kDa phosphoprotein encoded in early region 1B (E1B-55K) from adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) is required for efficient viral DNA replication, selective viral late mRNA nuclear export and inactivation of the tumour suppressor protein p53 (Berk, 2005) . E1B-55K shuttles between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. It possesses a C-terminal NLS and an N-terminal leucine-rich NES (Kr\u00e4tzer et al., 2000) . In addition, nucleocytoplasmic trafficking may also involve covalent conjugation of SUMO1, which appears to facilitate efficient nuclear import and/or subnuclear targeting. Overexpression of SUMO1 in transformed rat cells expressing E1B-55K causes the accumulation of E1B-55K at defined subnuclear structures, whereas arginine substitution of the major SUMOylation site, K104, results in a defect in nuclear import and accumulation in cytoplasmic inclusions (Endter et al., 2001) .\n\nSUMOylation also seems to be involved in regulating the nuclear export of E1B-55K. The nuclear export of E1B-55K is mediated by CRM-1-dependent and -independent pathways. Inactivation of CRM-1-dependent pathway by mutating the NES or LMB treatment causes redistribution of the viral protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and its accumulation at the viral replication centers, suggesting that CRM-1 is a major export receptor. However, this nuclear restriction is relieved by concurrent mutation of the SUMOylation site, suggesting that deconjugation of SUMO1 allows nuclear export via CRM-1-independent pathways (Kindsm\u00fcller et al., 2007) . The authors proposed that SUMO facilitates nuclear retention of E1B-55K, thus negatively regulating nuclear export.\n\nBovine papillomavirus E1 protein-The E1 protein of papillomaviruses (PV) is the major initiator protein for viral DNA replication and plays important roles in the establishment of stable episomal viral genomes in the host cell nucleus (Wilson et al., 2002) . Similar to E1B-55K, the E1 protein of bovine papillomavirus (BPV) has been shown to be SUMOylated by host cell machinery, although the role of SUMOylation in the intracellular distribution of BPV E1 is controversial (see below). SUMOylation of BPV E1 is possibly mediated through the host SUMO conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and PIAS family E3 SUMO ligases Rosas-Acosta et al., 2005) . SUMOylation on lysine residue 514 seems to be important for nuclear targeting. In transfected COS-1 cells, although wild-type E1 accumulates in intranuclear foci in addition to diffused nucleoplasmic distribution with little or no cytoplasmic staining, the SUMO site mutant K514R as well as the Ubc9-binding defective mutants are unable to localise to the nucleus . However, Fradet-Turcotte et al. (2009) found that in C33A cells, the nuclear localisation of the E1 proteins of human papillomavirus (HPV) 11, HPV16 and BPV is independent of SUMOylation. These authors showed that HPV11 E1 binds to Ubc9 similar to BPV E1, as reported previously, but the nuclear accumulation of HPV11 E1 is not affected by mutations that weaken Ubc9 binding and by inhibition of the SUMO pathway using a SUMO-activating enzyme inhibitor Gam1, a dominant negative version of Ubc9 or shRNA depletion of Ubc9 (Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2009) . Quite surprisingly, the authors also found that contrary to the previous report by , the SUMOylation site mutants of BPV E1 are not defective in the nuclear localisation in C33A cells (Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2009) . Interestingly, another report by Rosas-Acosta et al. (2005) suggested that SUMOylation might mediate nuclear export of BPV E1 by enhancing its interaction with CRM-1 (Rosas-Acosta and Wilson, 2008) . According to this report, the non-SUMOylatable mutant is almost exclusively nuclear and is more enriched in close proximity to the nuclear envelope as compared with the wild-type form, supporting a role for SUMO in the intracellular distribution of BPV E1 albeit different from the one previously suggested .\n\nthat has been associated with a variety of cancers (de Oliveira et al., 2010) . Multiple proteins encoded by EBV have been shown to be modified by Ub or SUMO, including Rta, Zta and Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) 3C, but a role for Ub/SUMO in regulating the cellular localisation of these proteins has not been established in most cases (see below).\n\nRta and Zta are two immediate early proteins that mediate the switch between the latent and lytic forms of EBV infection (Speck et al., 1997) . SUMO-1 modification of Rta by the E3 ligases PIAS1 and RanBPM enhances its transactivation activity, although the effect of SUMO-1 on the subcellular localisation of Rta was not examined in these studies (Chang et al., 2004 (Chang et al., , 2008 . Rta can also be modified by SUMO2/3 in the presence of viral protein LF2. LF2 binding induces the translocation of Rta from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and represses its activity, but this redistribution of Rta seems to be independent of its SUMOylation (Calderwood et al., 2008; Heilmann et al., 2010) . Similarly, Zta can be modified by SUMO-1, 2 and 3, but in contrast to Rta, SUMO-1 modification of Zta seems to repress its transactivation activity (Adamson and Kenney, 2001; Adamson, 2005; Hagemeier et al., 2010) . SUMOylation does not seem to play a role in the subcellular localisation of Zta because its localisation pattern remains unaltered when SUMO-1 is overexpressed or when its SUMO-1 conjugation site is mutated (Adamson, 2005; Hagemeier et al., 2010) .\n\nEBNA3C is a viral latent antigen involved in primary B cell transformation by EBV (Saha et al., 2009) . Rosendorff et al. (2004) found that EBNA3C is modified by SUMO2/3. SUMO-3 modification might be involved in the subnuclear localisation of EBNA3C because the wildtype protein localises to nuclear dots, whereas truncation mutants defective in SUMO-3 conjugation exhibit diffused localisation patterns in the nucleus. However, the SUMOylation site in EBNA3C has not been pinpointed and a definitive role for SUMO-3 in the subnuclear targeting of ENBA3C is yet to be confirmed.\n\nLMP2A, a transmembrane protein expressed during EBV latency, was found to be ubiquitinated by Nedd4 family ubiquitin E3 ligases on amino terminal non-lysine residues (Ikeda et al., 2002) . This modification affects protein stability (Ikeda et al., 2001) , but its functional relevance is not clear.\n\nImmediate early proteins of other herpesviruses-Besides EBV, the immediate early proteins of a few other human herpesviruses (HHVs) have been shown to be modified by SUMO, including the K-bZIP protein of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (Izumiya et al., 2005) , the IE1 and IE2 proteins of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (Hofmann et al., 2000; Ahn et al., 2001 , Spengler et al., 2002 Nevels et al., 2004) and the IE1 protein of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) (Gravel et al., 2004) . SUMOylation modulates the substrate protein's transcriptional activation or repression function in some cases (e.g. KSHV K-bZIP and HCMV IE2); however, in all cases examined, SUMO does not seem to affect the subcellular localisation of the substrate protein (Hofmann et al., 2000; Ahn et al., 2001; Spengler et al., 2002; Nevels et al., 2004; Gravel et al., 2004; Izumiya et al., 2005) .\n\nNegative-stranded RNA virus-Most negative-stranded RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm, and there is no nuclear stage required to complete the viral life cycle (Griffin et al., 2007) . However, both non-structural and structural proteins of these cytoplasmic viruses have been shown to translocate to the nuclear compartment. Examples include the matrix protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (Petersen et al., 2000) , the W proteins of paramyxoviruses (Shaw et al., 2004) and the matrix proteins of several paramyxoviruses (Yoshida et al., 1976; Peeples et al., 1992; Ghildyal et al., 2003) . The nuclear translocation is usually associated with host antagonistic activities of these viral proteins to facilitate viral replication (Petersen et al., 2000; Ghildyal et al., 2003; Shaw et al., 2005) .\n\nWe recently demonstrated that the matrix protein of Nipah virus (NiV), a lethal member of the family Paramyxoviridae, shuttles between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Wang et al., 2010) . During live NiV infection, the matrix protein is first found in the nucleus of infected cells before it localises to cytoplasmic and plasma membrane locations at later time points. The nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of NiV matrix is regulated by ubiquitination in addition to its bi-partite NLS and leucine-rich NES (Figure 4) . Ub depletion by proteasome inhibitors including MG132 and bortezomib restricts matrix to the nucleus, which is phenocopied by mutating the putative ubiquitination site (K258) from lysine to arginine. Moreover, fusing a copy of Ub to mimic monoubiquitination restores nuclear export to the K258R mutant, supporting the hypothesis that monoubiquitination of matrix promotes its nuclear export. However, our current data are also compatible with an alternative model in which ubiquitination inhibits nuclear import of the protein, favouring cytoplasmic retention. Further investigation is needed to distinguish between these two possibilities. We also showed that nuclear translocation of NiV matrix is functionally correlated with matrix-mediated viral budding. The ubiquitination site mutants are defective in plasma membrane targeting and viral budding, implying a potential role of ubiquitination in these processes.\n\nVery interestingly, sequence alignment of matrix proteins from viruses across Paramyxoviridae reveals that the putative Ub site in NiV (K258) is absolutely conserved in all viruses examined (Table 3) . Previous studies as well as our own research have shown that NiV matrix is by no means the only paramyxoviral matrix protein to translocate to the nucleus. The matrix proteins of Sendai virus (Yoshida et al., 1976) , Newcastle disease virus (Peeples, 1988; Peeples et al., 1992) , human respiratory syncytial virus (Ghildyal et al., 2003) , mumps virus, Hendra virus and tupaia paramyovirus (last three are our unpublished data) all exhibit nuclear localisation under viral infection or cell transfection conditions. It would be interesting to test whether the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of other paramyxoviral matrix proteins might also be regulated by ubiquitination similar to NiV matrix.\n\nThe nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of many cellular proteins is regulated by posttranslational modifications including ubiquitination and SUMOylation in addition to their endogenous NLSs and NESs, as discussed above. However, although the role of Ub/SUMO in regulating the intracellular localisation and functions of cellular proteins has been well established, to our knowledge, their involvement in viral protein trafficking remains largely unknown, with the exception of only a few examples (e.g. HTLV-1 Tax, Ad5 E1B-55K, BPV E1 and NiV matrix). Nevertheless, these past few years have witnessed a fast-growing list of viruses that utilise the host's Ub/SUMO system to facilitate various steps of their life cycle [for a complete review of viral takeover of the Ub/SUMO system, readers are referred to references Boggio and Chiocca (2006) ; Gustin et al. (2011) ). Therefore, targeting the Ub/ SUMO system (via either global inhibition of the pathways or modulating the functions of individual components such as Ub/SUMO ligases and deubiquitinating/deSUMOylating enzymes) can potentially be a way to develop broad-spectrum antivirals. Indeed, the US Food and Drug Administration-approved proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has been shown to inhibit different families of viruses including Hepatitis B virus (Hepadnaviridae) (Bandi et al., 2010) , HIV (Retroviridae) (Yu et al., 2009 ), vesicular stomatitis virus (Rhabdoviridae) (Neznanov et al., 2008; Dudek et al., 2010) , influenza A virus (Orthomyxoviridae) (Dudek et al., 2010) , NiV (Paramyxoviridae) (Wang et al., 2010) , coronaviruses (Coronaviridae) (Raaben et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2010) and orthopoxviruses (Poxviridae) (Teale et al., 2009 ). However, most of these studies have been done in in vitro models, and it is important to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of bortezomib and its oral equivalents such as MLN9708 and PR-047 (Zhou et al., 2009; Kupperman et al., 2010; Dick and Fleming, 2010) as potential broad-spectrum antivirals.\n\nThis work was supported by the Pacific Southwest (1) p53 polyubiquitination by Mdm2 leads to protein degradation (Li et al., 2003) .\n\n(2) p53 monoubiquitination by Mdm2 and SUMOylation by PIASy cooperatively lead to nuclear export (Li et al., 2003 , Carter et al., 2007 .\n\n(3) Demodified p53 translocates back to the nucleus (Yuan et al., 2010) (see text for details). (1) UV induces monoubiquitination of Tax, its dissociation from nuclear body proteins and nuclear export (Gatza et al., 2007) .\n\n(2) SUMOylation targets Tax to the nuclear bodies (Lamsoul et al., 2005) .\n\n(3) K63-linked polyubiquitination targets Tax to microtubule organising center as well as nuclear bodies (Kfoury et al., 2011) . Polyubiquitination is also important for targeting the IKK signalosome to the centrosome and nuclear translocation of RelA (Kfoury et al., 2008 , Nasr et al., 2006 (see text for details). (1) NiV M translocates to the nucleus in an NLS-dependent manner.\n\n(2) NiV M is ubiquitinated via an unknown mechanism.\n\n(3) Ubiquitination of M promotes its nuclear export via an NES-dependent mechanism. Ubiquitination of M may also be important for its membrane targeting and budding, although the mechanism is currently unclear (Wang et al., 2010) .
