{"title": "", "body": "Internationally imported cases are currently being reported in several different locations. Early detection of imported cases is critical for containment of the virus. Based on air travel volume estimates from Wuhan to international destinations and using a generalized linear regression model we identify locations which may potentially have undetected internationally imported cases.\n\nA novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has been identified with the first confirmed patient cases in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, China. Since then the number of confirmed cases has increased drastically. Model estimates suggested that by Jan 25, 2020 there were a total of over 75,000 infected cases with a doubling time of about 6 days 1 . By the end of January 2020, city-wide lockdowns were implemented for Wuhan and neighbouring cities. Nonetheless, the virus has managed to spread from Wuhan to other Chinese cities and also outside of China. As of Feb 4, 2020, cases outside China were being reported in 23 different locations of which 22 locations had imported cases (Spain reported one case but due to secondary transmission) 2 .\n\nThe majority of these cases have been linked to a recent travel history from China 2 , suggesting that air travel may play an important role for the risk of cases being exported outside of China.

Here we use estimates of air travel volume from Wuhan to international destinations in 49 locations expected to be proficient at detecting imported cases based on having a high Global Health Security (GHS) Index 3 , and a generalised linear regression model to predict imports of 2019-nCoV cases across 191 locations. Using these predictions we can identify locations that might not be identifying imported cases.\n\nUnder a model fit to data from destinations with high surveillance capacity, we sought to identify locations that report fewer than predicted imported cases of 2019-nCoV. Specifically, for 49 locations with The model requires three types of data: data on imported cases of 2019-nCoV, data on daily air travel volume, and data on surveillance capacity. Data on imported cases aggregated by destination were obtained from the WHO technical report dated 4th February 2020 2 (a zero case count was assumed for all locations not listed). We used case counts up to the 4th February, because after this date the number of exported cases from Hubei drops rapidly 2 , likely due to the Hubei-wide lockdowns. We defined imported cases as those with known travel history from China (of those, 83% had travel history from Hubei province, and 17% from unknown locations in China 2 ). We excluded cases that are likely due to transmission outside of China or whose transmission source is still under investigation 2 . In addition, we excluded from our Specifically, we use the Early Detection and Reporting Epidemics of Potential International Concern component of the Index 3 , henceforth referred to as simply the GHS index, and define high surveillance locations as those whose GHS index is greater than the 75th quantile. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020495 doi: medRxiv preprint\n\nThe model is as follows. We assumed that across the n =49 high surveillance locations the case counts follow a Poisson distribution, and that the expected case count is linearly proportional to the daily air travel volume:\n\nwhere C i denotes the reported case count in the i -th location, \u03bb i denotes the expected case count in the i -th location, \u03b2 denotes the regression coefficient, x i denotes the daily air travel volume of the i -th location.\n\nThe model was fitted in R (version 3.6.1) 5 to compute , the maximum likelihood estimate of \u03b2, and \u03b2 \ufe3f thus the expected case count given high surveillance (Figure 1, solid grey line) . We also computed the excluding Thailand from the model fit since it is a high-leverage point. In total, we thus did six additional regression analyses (see Supplementary Figure 1 ). All analyses are fully reproducible given code available online ( https://github.com/c2-d2/cov19flightimport ).\n\nImported case counts of 2019-nCoV among high surveillance locations are positively correlated with daily air travel volume (Figure 1 ). An increase in flight volume by 14 passengers per day is associated with one additional imported case in expectation. Singapore lies above the 95% prediction interval (PI),\n\nwith 12 (2-13) more reported import cases than expected under our model. Thailand has a relatively high air travel volume as compared to all other locations, yet it lies below the 95% prediction interval. Finally, Indonesia with zero reported cases lies below the prediction interval -its expected case count is 5 (1-11 .

This overall pattern (Singapore lying above the 95% PI, Thailand and Indonesia below) was observed consistently across all six robustness regression analyses. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020495 doi: medRxiv preprint\n\nWe aimed to identify locations with underdetected cases by fitting a model to the cumulative international imported case counts of nCoV-2019 reported by high surveillance locations and Wuhan-to-location air travel volume. Our model can be adjusted to account for exportation of cases from locations other than Wuhan as the outbreak develops and more information on importations and self-sustained transmission becomes available. One key advantage of this model is that it does not rely on estimates of incidence or prevalence in the epicentre of the outbreak. Based on our model, locations whose case counts exceed the 95% prediction interval (PI) could be interpreted as having higher case-detection capacity and/or more connection with Wuhan than that captured by available daily air travel volume, such as land transportation. Locations below the 95% PI may have undetected cases based on the expected case count under high surveillance. We recommend that outbreak surveillance and control efforts for potential local transmission should be rapidly strengthened in those locations lying below the 95% PI lower bound, in particular Indonesia, to ensure detection of cases and appropriate control measures to reduce the risk of self-sustained transmission."}
