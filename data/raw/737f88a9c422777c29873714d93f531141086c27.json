{"title": "", "body": "Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. Th e WHO statistics shows that there are approximately one million new cases and 700,000 death all over the world in 2008. [1] [2] [3] In the past several decades, intensive eff orts have been made to identify tools to improve prognostication of GC. Such as miR-21, miRNA-106a, and miR-143, as well as miR-203 are considered to be promising novel biomarkers for GC. 4 However, except for the cancer staging, which adjuvant treatment depends on, defi nite predictive factors of the prognosis of GC are relatively scarce. [5] [6] [7] [8] Th us, fi nding new prognostic tools, such as biomarkers, for accurate diagnosis of GC is of vital importance to improve the therapeutic eff ect and prolong the survival of patients. Th e eukaryotic initiation factor 3f (eIF3f) is the p47 subunit of the multisubunit eIF3 complex and plays an important role in translation initiation. [9] [10] [11] Although the role of eIF3f in the eIF3 complex has not been defi ned, [12] [13] [14] shutoff experiments in Schizosaccharomyces pombe show that in a long-term period, eIF3f is essential for viability. 15 Translation system indicate that in mammalian cells eIF3f is a negative regulator of translation, which plays an important role in human cancer. 12, 16 Study of Roberta Marchione showed that the f subunit of eIF3 represents a promising candidate molecule to use for biotherapeutic applications. 17 Previous studies identifi ed eIF3f as a protein involved in apoptotic signaling is a negative regulator of translation and we also demonstrated that eIF3f expression signifi cantly decreased in many human cancers, which plays an important role in human cancer. 11, 16, 18, 19 Shi et al. report that eIF3f is downregulated in several human tumors, and that its overexpression inhibited cell proliferation in melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells. 11 Recent studies of Ana E. Higareda-Mendoza and Marco A. Pardo-Galv\u00e1n also show that eIF3f is essential for A549 cell proliferation and its absence induces the cell to enter apoptosis. 20 Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor involved in development and progression of various solid tumor types, such as breast cancer, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, and colorectal and GC. 21, 22 Moreover, high expression of Her-2/neu has been recognized as one of the poor prognostic factors of breast cancer. Although a great deal of researches has been conducted, the signifi cance of Her-2/neu overexpression in GC and its impact on survival is still controversial.\n\nTaken together, expression of eIF3f or Her-2/neu both play important roles in many kinds of malignant tumors. In this study, we fi rst focused on analyzing the relationship between eIF3f and Her-2/neu. Next, we investigated the expression levels of eIF3f and Her-2/neu by immunohistochemistry and FISH respectively in gastric carcinoma and their correlation with clinicopathological variables, aiming to fi nd a new prognostic marker for GC and new diagnosis and treatment strategies. \n\nFor immunohistochemical, the paraffi n-embedded tissue sections were obtained from 195 cases of radical resection of GC. Th e fragments were fi xed in neutral formol. All the cases were reviewed by a pathologist to confi rm the malignancy. Th e ethics committee of the medical faculty agreed to these investigations. Th e written informed consents were obtained from all the patients.\n\nTh e polyclonal antibody (ab64177) to eIF3f was bought from Abcom company. Th e paraffi n-embedded tissue blocks were sectioned in 3-4 mm slices and placed on antislides. Aft er dewaxing and hydration, the slides were rinsed in phosphatebuff ered saline (PBS), and blocked for 10 minutes with 3% hydrogen peroxide to deprive the endogenous peroxidase activity. Aft er antigen retrieval with the use of a microwave, the specimens were incubated with the anti eIF3f MAb (diluted 1:100 in PBS) at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 hours. Th e sections were then washed 3 \u00d7 3 minutes in PBS and incubated with 1 and 2 reagent of PV9000 mouse/rabbit hypersensitivity two steps immunohistochemical Kit (Beijing fi r Jinqiao) for total of 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C in a humid chamber. Th e sections were washed 3 \u00d7 3 minutes with PBS, followed by the addition of diaminobenzidine (DAB) as a chromogen for 3-5 minutes, which was strictly controlled under microscope. Antibodies were optimized using positive control tissue according to manufacturer's instructions. In negative controls, the primary antibody was replaced with PBS. Th e rest procedures were undergone in parallel with other specimens. Each slide was scored in a blinded fashion by two pathologists according to the manufacturer's recommended criteria at 100\u00d7 and 200\u00d7 magnifi cation. Th e overall percentage of cells on an immunostained section was determined according to the pattern of intracellular localization. Th e extent and pattern of the eIF3f-specifi c immunostaining within a tissue section was determined by the percentage of cells with cytoplasm staining. Th e immunostaining was read in a semiquantitative manner. Th ree visual fi eld were examined randomly and the rate of positive cells were divided into less than 5% (0 score), 6%-25% (1 score), 26%-50% (2 score), 51%-75% (3 score), and more than 75% (4 score). Th e staining intensity can be divided into three grades: no staining (0 score), slightly yellowish (1 score), brownish yellow (2 score), and dark brown (3 score). Th e multiplication of the two were graded as follows: 0 (0 score), 1+ (1-4 score), 2+ (5-8 score), and 3+ (9-12 score). Intensity scores of 0 or 1+ were designated as low expression and 2+, 3+ were designated as high expression.\n\nFISH analysis was performed using the PathVysion Her-2/ neu probe kit (Vysis, Abbott Park, IL, USA) according to the manufacture's protocols. Briefl y, the neutral formol fi xed and paraffi n-embedded sections (3-4 \u03bc m) were placed on Anti slides and then were kept in oven overnight at 56\u00b0C. Aft er deparaffi nized and dehydrated at room temperature, the slides were treated with pretreatment solution (sodium thiocyanite) and protease solution for 15 minutes and were dehydrated with 70%, 80%, and 100% alcohol for 5 minutes each and air dried. Th e probe was denatured at 80\u00b0C for 5 minutes and was added to each slide and sealed under a small glass cover slip before overnight hybridization at 42\u00b0C. Th e procedure was followed by washing in 0.4 \u00d7 sodium saline citrate (SSC)/0.3% Nonidet (NP40) and 2 \u00d7 SSC. Aft er hybridization, the nuclei counterstaining was achieved with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Slides were scored for hybridization signals on a cell-by-cell basis using a fl uorescence microscope. Results were expressed as the ratio of Her-2/neu signal (orange) to centromere 17 signal (green) and the readings were read as follows: the expected ratio 1-1.8 indicates no gene amplifi cation (negative), a ratio of >2.2 as Her-2/neu gene amplifi cation (positive), and a ratio between 1.8 and 2.2 as equivocal cases. Th e polysomy 17 was also recorded in the cells as four spec green signals as moderate polysomy and >4 spec green signals as high polysomy.\n\nDiff erences between groups were analyzed using a Student's t -test for continuous variables and a chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for proportions. Th e overall survival rate was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analyses (Cox proportional hazard regression models) were also performed to assess the prognostic value of nucleolin expression and other clinicopathological features. We utilized SAS 9.2 soft ware system for statistical analysis.\n\nA total of 142 men and 53 women all accepted radical operation of GC, including 116 primary and 79 recurrent GC patients. Pathologically, all of the 195 cases were adenocarcinoma, which covered 12 well diff erentiated, 27 moderate diff erentiated, 156 low diff erentiated, and 4 signet-ring cell carcinoma.\n\nImmunohistochemical stain for eIF3f showed cytoplasm staining pattern in both GC tissues ( Figure 1 A-D ) and ANCT ( Figure 1 E-H ) . Immunoscores were calculated when the presence of eIF3f deposits in tumor glands and cytoplasmic staining were positive.\n\nTh e rate of high eIF3f expression in GC tissues was 33.8% (66/195) whereas 59.5% (116/195) in ANCT.\n\nThe association of eIF3f levels with clinicopathological features in GC was also assessed in Table 1 . Low eIF3f expression in GC was significantly associated with more advanced tumor stages (p = 0.02) and likelihood of recurrence (p = 0.04). However, eIF3f expression was not significantly correlated with sex (p = 0.87), age (p = 0.17), and tumor diff erentiation (p = 0.46). A total of 53 (40.0%) of 136 stage I and II cases had high eIF3f staining densitometry values higher than cases of stage III (p = 0.02). Furthermore, the overall densitometric analysis of the immunostaining revealed that the down regulated eIF3f protein expression varied signifi cantly between primary and recurrent tumors (p = 0.04).\n\nTh e prognostic eff ect of eIF3f on the survival rate of GC patients was investigated by comparing the survival rate of patients with high or low levels of eIF3f protein expression in tumors using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank test. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that clinical variables, including tumor recurrence (logrank, p < 0.01; Figure 2 A ) and eIF3f expression (log-rank, p = 0.04; Figure 2 B ) both signifi cantly associated with overall survival ( Table 2 ) . Data indicate that high expression of eIF3f protein was a signifi cant prognostic factor for better survival of GC patients. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that eIF3f expression was not an independent predictor for the overall survival of patients with GC.\n\nWe detected the expression of Her-2/neu by FISH and the overexpression was detected in 31 (15.9%) tumors ( Figure 1 I-J ) . Th e possible association of Her-2/neu levels with clinical and pathological factors in gastric carcinoma was also assessed. Th e chi-square test did not detect signifi cant diff erence between the expression level of Her-2/neu and the patients' sex, age (p > 0.05), but correlated with the diff erentiation degree, TNM classifi cation, tumor recurrence, or distant metastasis. Compared with the eIF3f, the expression of Her-2/neu was found higher in 15 (7.7%) of 141 poorly diff erentiated adenocarcinoma than 4 (2.1%) of 8 well-diff erentiated cases (p = 0.0049; Table 1 ). Simultaneously, 26 (13.3%) of 33 stage III cases had Her-2/ neu staining densitometry values higher than 5 (2.6%) of 131 cases of stage I and II (p = 0.0019; Table 1 ). When determined the possible relationship between Her-2/neu values and tumor recurrence or progression, we found that positive Her-2/neu expression was observed in 10.8% of recurred or metastasis tumors compared with 5.1% of primary tumors (p = 0.0063; Table 1 ). \n\nFrom the above results, it was concluded that Her-2/neu expression is closely related to invasion and cancer metastasis and can be used to evaluate the biological behavior. Some authors documented that Her-2/neu appears to be an important prognostic factor in GC. However, univariate analysis revealed Her-2/neu level was not a prognostic factor for patients' overall survival in our study group (p = 0.12; Figure 2 C ).\n\nOur present study reveals that Her-2/neu is overexpressed in GC and with no expression in ANCT. Th is is not in accordance with those of eIF3f. We also found that GC tissues with a high proportion of eIF3f overexpressing, especially those defined as 3+, also present a high level of Her-2/ neu immunostaining (p = 0.0295; Table 3 ). Th e results showed that eIF3f and Her-2/ neu expressions were both closely related to later TNM stage and recurrence or metastasis of GC. However, unlike eIF3f, which is identified as a significant and independent prognostic factor of GC, Her-2/neu expression in FISH has no prognostic signifi cance in this study. Meanwhile, this research does not support value of Her-2/ neu expression as a prognostic tool in GC.\n\nDespite the incidence and mortality rate of GC have fallen over past several decades, GC is still the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. 24, 25 Disappointingly, in terms of prognosis and quality of life for GC patients, little improvement has been achieved within the past decade although many advances in tumor diagnosis and treatment. 26, 27 Given the high failure rate of conventional treatment strategies, many cancer-related molecules have been characterized with the goal of developing novel anticancer strategy. eIF3f is another eIF3 subunit whose function is not well known. 18, 28 In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of eIF3f inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that down-regulation of eIF3f is involved in tumorigenesis for many types of cancer. 11, 16, 19 However, there is no large sample report about the expression and clinical signifi cance of eIF3f in human GC progression and prognosis. In this study, we investigated the expression of eIF3f in GC as well as its correlation with the clinicopathological features and prognosis.\n\nTh e data from our study showed that the levels of eIF3f protein were signifi cantly lower in GC tissue compared with paired ANCT. Additionally, the decreased expression of eIF3f protein was signifi cantly related to more advanced tumor stages (p = 0.02) expression had signifi cantly poor survival compared with those patients with high eIF3f expression. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that recurrence (p < 0.01) and eIF3f expression (p = 0.04) were both prognostic predictor to human GC after resection. Based on these results, we propose a bold hypothesis that a preoperative determination of eIF3f expression may be useful in predicting the therapeutic eff ect and postoperative survival of human GC.\n\nExtensive studies of Her-2/neu have been conducted among a variety of tumor types. Researches show that overexpression of Her-2/neu oncogene is a frequent molecular event in multiple human cancers, such as breast cancer, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, and colorectal and GC. 29, 30 In previous studies, Her-2/neu overexpression in 10%-34% of breast cancer cases has been documented to be associated with a poor prognosis. 31 Favorable clinical results with anti-Her-2/ neu therapy in breast cancer have led to the analysis of its expression in other solid tumors, but the clinical signifi cance of its expression is not fully clear yet. Th e rate of the expression of Her-2/neu is up to 15.9% in our study group. No relationship was found between Her-2/neu overexpression and patients' age, sex. Patients with distant metastasis, late stage, and poorly differentiated status have a significantly higher Her-2/neu expression rate than the remaining cases, which suggests that Her-2/ neu may be activated during the process of infi ltration and participate in the process of the distant metastasis.\n\nThis study of Her-2/neu reveals that the significance of Her-2/neu overexpression in GC and its impact on survival is controversial. Survival analysis in our study did not confi rm the prognostic signifi cance of Her-2/neu overexpression in GC patients, which is consistent with Halon's 32 recent report. Similar results were observed by Tateishi et al., 33 who found prognosis was independent of Her-2/neu expression.\n\nWe also found that high expression of eIF3f was in conjunction with an over accumulation for Her-2/neu in GC tissue sections. It is perhaps telling that there is a correlation between eIF3f and Her-2/neu in GC. If so, it will provide new insights into the carcinogenesis and progression of GC, thereby fi nding a novel diagnosis or treatment and servings to clinic. However, it is all just speculation at this point and the correlation between the two needs to be further investigated at the molecular and cellular levels. "}
