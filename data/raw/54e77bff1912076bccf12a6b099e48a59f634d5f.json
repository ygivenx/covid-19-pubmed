{"title": "Supplementary Material and Methods", "body": "coding sequences. This PCR introduced three stop codons to terminate the Rluc coding sequence. The rest of the 5'UTR was amplified directly from a proviral molecular clone of HIV-1 group M subtype B (pLAI) (4) . The initiation codon for Fluc expression is located within the 5'UTR IRES and the context of the AUG encompassing 30 nt from the Gag sequence was included. A peptide linker (GGGGSGGGGS) was inserted by PCR immediately upstream of the Fluc coding sequence. The first half of the linker was inserted using PCR amplification on pLAI with the 5'UTR-AflII(+) and 5'UTR-BamHI(-) primers and the second half of the linker with the 5'UTR(+) and Linker-BamHI(-) primers. The linker was cloned in the AflII and BamHI restriction sites of pDual-HIV(-1)\u0394AflII-TAR to generate pDual-IRES-HIV. This last step removed the frameshift region originally present in pDual-HIV(-1). Finally, we cut the fragment containing the Rluc coding sequence, the 5'UTR region of HIV-1 RNA and the Fluc coding sequence, using PmeI and ApaI restriction sites. This fragment was inserted into pcDNA5FRT (Invitrogen) previously linearized with SciI and ApaI to produce pFRT-IRES-HIV. Prior to this last cloning step, the KpnI and BamHI restriction sites from pcDNA5FRT were eliminated to facilitate subsequent cloning of mutant IRESes. To this end, an oligonucleotide cassette formed by the K7\u0394KpnI\u0394BamHI(+) and\n\nK7\u0394KpnI\u0394BamHI(-) primers was inserted in the HindIII and EcoRV restriction sites of pcDNA5FRT.\n\nThe different mutants of HIV-1 IRES were made by PCR amplification with four primers. The external primers were Ext-KpnI(+) et Ext-BamHI(-). The details for all the primers used can be found in Supplementary Table 1 . The resulting PCR products were cloned in the KpnI and BamHI restriction sites of pFRT-dual-IRES-HIV.\n\n\u0394AflII-SpeI(+) 5'GACCCGGGGTACCAAGCTTGAGTTTAAACGCTAGCCAGC'3 "}
