{"title": "Synthesis and antiviral activities of hexadecyloxypropyl prodrugs of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates containing guanine or hypoxanthine and a (S)-HPMP or PEE acyclic moiety", "body": "Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates [1] constitute a group of compounds with a wide range of biological activities including antiviral, cytostatic, antiparasitic and immunomodulatory effects. The compounds with guanine or hypoxanthine as a nucleobase bearing (S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] [(S)-HPMP], or 2-(2-phosphonoethoxy)ethyl (PEE) chain have been reported as potential antimalarial agents [2] capable to inhibit the 6oxopurine phosphoribosyltransferase [3] of the Plasmodium parasite. In order to increase membrane permeability of above mentioned phosphonates, we have masked the ionic character of the drugs using the Hostetler's prodrug strategy [4] and hexadecyloxypropyl esters of 9-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]guanine [(S)-HPMPG], 9-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]hypoxanthine [(S)-HPMPHx], 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]guanine (PEEG) and 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]hypoxanthine (PEEHx) have been prepared. Their activities against Plasmodium are the subject of another study [5] . Herein we focus on their antiviral activities against various virus strains. Among the parent drugs, (S)-HPMPG has been reported [6] as an active compound against herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and type 2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and vaccinia virus (EC 50 in the mM range). The octadecyloxyethyl ester of (S)-HPMPG, a close analog of prodrug 16 in this study, has been reported [7] to display enhanced antiviral activity compared to the parent drug. Attachment of a highly lipophilic hexadecyloxypropyl moiety increases the cellular permeability as well as antiviral activities of the prodrug, probably due to the greater availability for cellular phosphorylation [4] . Thus strong antiviral activities of hexadecyloxypropyl esters of (S)-HPMPG against DNA virus strains can be expected. Also drugs previously found to be weakly active (PEEG) may show more pronounced activity after their conversion to hexadecyloxypropyl esters. Additionally, the structureeactivity relationship among various prodrug types (diester, monoester, cyclic monoester) is reported below.\n\nFor alkylation of the phosphonate function with the hexadecyloxypropyl moiety, we considered two approaches using PEEG as a model compound. The first is a broadly used methodology [8] involving in situ preparation of a bis chloridate followed by subsequent reaction with hexadecyloxypropyl alcohol in the presence of a base. The latter approach [9] involves neutralization of the phosphonate function with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide followed by nucleophilic reaction of the resulting phosphonate salt with hexadecyloxypropyl bromide. However, both methodologies afforded low yields of PEEG esters (<10%) due to the low conversion and the simultaneous alkylation of nucleobase. In order to circumvent these problems,we alkylated the acyclic phosphonate synthon which was subsequently coupled with an appropriate nucleobase. For the preparation of PEEG and PEEHx prodrugs, bis isopropyl phosphonoethoxyethylchloride [10] 1 was transformed to the free phosphonic acid and subsequently to bis chloridate which was treated with hexadecyloxypropyl alcohol in the presence of pyridine and triethylamine. Bis hexadecyloxypropyl ester 2 was isolated in high yield. The nucleophilic substitution reaction of alkylated phosphonate synthon with 6-chloropurine or 2-amino-6chloropurine in the presence of Cs 2 CO 3 as a base followed by acid catalyzed cleavage of the 6-chloro substituent afforded bis hexadecyloxypropyl esters of PEEG or PEEHx. Appropriate monoesters 5 and 6 were prepared by dissolving diesters 3 and 4 in DMF and heating in the presence of a nucleophilic agent (LiN 3 ) causing removal of one alkyl ester group [11] (Scheme 1).\n\nSimilar to the preparation of PEEG and PEEHx prodrugs, the preparation of (S)-HPMPG and (S)-HPMPHx prodrugs began with the conversion of bis isopropyl phosphonomethyltosylate 7 to bis(hexadecyloxypropyl) phosphonomethyltosylate 8 [12] . The alkylated phosphonate synthon was coupled with pre-prepared 9-(2-hydroxy-3-trityloxypropyl)-6-O-benzylpurine 11 or 9-(2hydroxy-3-trityloxypropyl)-2-amino-6-O-benzylpurine 12 in the presence of a base (NaH). Pre-preparation involved nucleophilic opening of the oxirane ring of (S)-(\u00c0)-glycidol trityl ether with 6-Obenzylpurine 9 or 2-amino-6-O-benzylpurine 10. The acid labile protective groups (OBn, OTr) of the resulting adducts were cleaved by the action of HCl. The diesters 13 and 14 were hydrolyzed in a solution of NaOH giving monoesters 15 and 16. Above mentioned method [11] using milder conditions resulted in incomplete conversion in this case. Intramolecular esterification of 15 and 16 mediated by PyBOP [13] afforded cyclic hexadecyloxypropyl esters 17 and 18 as a mixture of diastereomers (1:1 ratio according to the NMR spectra) (Scheme 2).\n\nEsterification of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates such as (S)-HPMPC and (S)-HPMPA with various alkoxyalkyl or alkylglycerol groups has been shown to result in remarkable increases in antiviral activities against herpesviruses and poxviruses [14, 15] . The rationale behind this study was to demonstrate whether enhanced lipophilicity of (S)-HPMPG, (S)-HPMPHx, PEEG and PEEHx correlates with increased antiviral activity. For that purpose, hexadecyloxypropyl diesters, monoesters and cyclic monoesters of these compounds were prepared and their antiviral properties were evaluated in vitro.\n\nThe antiviral activity of the different compounds was evaluated against various DNA viruses, including poxviruses [i.e. vaccinia virus (VACV)], herpesviruses [i.e. herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)] and type 2 (HSV-2), thymidine kinase-deficient HSV-1 (acyclovir-resistant, ACV r ), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) ( Table 1) , and retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2). All compounds were also examined against several RNA viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Coxsackie B4 virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus type 3, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus and Punta Toro virus. None of the prodrugs showed activity against any of the RNA viruses nor retroviruses tested.\n\nSimilar to the parent compound, both the diester and monoester prodrugs of PEEHx (i.e. compounds 3 and 5) proved inactive against herpesviruses and poxviruses. Although the diester prodrug of PEEG (compound 4) lacked also activity against these DNA viruses, the monoester derivative (compound 6) was able to potently inhibit the replication of VZV, HSV and HCMV at EC 50 values in the range of, respectively, 0.14e0.30 mM, 1.4e2.8 mM, and 0.06e0.13 mM. Since compound 6 inhibited cell growth at a CC 50 (50% cytostatic concentration) value of 26 mM, selectivity indices (ratio CC 50 to EC 50 ) ranged from 9 to 433 depending on the nature of the virus. Interestingly, compound 6 was inactive against feline herpesvirus and against VACV.\n\nAmong the HPMP prodrugs, attachment of highly lipophilic hexadecyloxypropyl moieties to (S)-HPMPHx did not result in an increase of the antiviral activity since compounds 15 (monoester), 13 (diester) and 17 (cyclic monoester) were totally inactive against herpesviruses and poxviruses.\n\nThe diester derivative of (S)-HPMPG (compound 14) showed EC 50 values that were 7-fold (VZV and HCMV), 15-to 40-fold (HSV), 157-fold (feline herpesvirus) and 41-fold (VACV) lower than those for the parent compound. However, the monoester and cyclic monoester derivatives of (S)-HPMPG proved more active and selective than the diester derivative. This observation supports previous assumption [4] that the phosphonate double-ester prodrugs penetrate the cell membrane less rapidly than their monoester counterpairs, even in case an ionized phosphonate group is present in the monoester prodrug. Thus, compound 16 (monoester) and compound 18 (cyclic monoester) inhibited VZV replication with EC 50 values in the range of 0.001e0.0025 mM for VZV, 0.007e0.09 mM for HSV, and 0.002e0.007 mM for HCMV. While the monoester derivative of (S)-HPMPG was inactive against feline herpesvirus, the cyclic monoester derivative was able to inhibit viral replication with an EC 50 of 0.43 mM. However, compound 16 proved more active than compound 18 against VACV (EC 50 \u00bc 0.011 mM for compound 16 compared to 0.13 mM for compound 18). As the monoester derivative of (S)-HPMPG (compound 16) proved significantly more cystostatic than the cyclic monoester (compound 18) with a CC 50 of 0.72 mM and 19 mM, respectively, SIs were 2-to 66-fold lower for compound 16 compared to compound 18. Thus, the cyclic monoester of (S) HPMPG showed the high selectivity among all the prodrug tested with SIs in the range of 2700e19,000 for VZV, 211e559 for HSV, 3800e9500 for HCMV, and 146 for VACV.\n\nOur data show that enhanced lipophilicity of (S)-HPMPG resulted in increased antiviral activity and selectivity in vitro against herpesviruses and poxviruses. The significant gain in antiviral activity and selectivity for compound 18 compared to the parent compound can be explained in a similar way as for other ANPs, i.e. increased cellular uptake of the ester deriatives, more rapid conversion to the diphosphate active forms and also metabolic stability of the ester derivatives. Even compounds, such as 6 and 16, that are charged in physiological conditions are able to penetrate the cell membrane since they presented significant antiviral activity. Antimicrobial activities (Bordetella pertusis, Bacillus anthracis) of the prodrugs will be also tested.\n\nHexadecyloxypropyl diesters, monoesters and cyclic monoesters of (S)-HPMPG, (S)-HPMPHx, PEEG and PEEHx have been prepared and their antiviral properties were evaluated in vitro.\n\nNone of the hexadecyloxypropyl esters of (S)-HPMPHx nor PEEHx proved active against herpesviruses and poxviruses. Although the hexadecyloxypropyl diester of PEEG was antivirally inactive, the monoester derivative gained activity against herpesviruses. Attachment of highly lipophilic hexadecyloxypropyl moieties to (S)-HPMPG resulted in improvement of its antiviral activity against herpesviruses. The cyclic monoester derivative of (S)-HPMPG emerged as the most selective antiviral compound.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, solvents were evaporated at 40 C and compounds were dried at 100 Pa.
