{"title": "Methylene blue degradation by the VUV/UV/persulfate process: Effect of pH on the roles of photolysis and oxidation", "body": "Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) generating highly reactive species (such as HO \u2022 , SO4 \u2022-, and Cl \u2022 ) are among the most efficient and promising chemical oxidation technologies for degrading harmful refractory pollutants that are resistant to conventional water treatment processes, including adsorption, sedimentation, coagulation/flocculation, and sand filtration [1, 2] .\n\nPersulfate (PS, a precursor of SO4 \u2022-) has a relatively low cost [3] , high stability in transportation [4] , and an inert and harmless end-product (SO4 2-) [5] ; thus, its popularity as a disinfectant or oxidant is increasing. AOPs involving PS activation have been successfully utilized to inactivate microorganisms (such as Coronavirus and Norwalk virus) [6] and degrade a variety of organic pollutants [3, 4, 7, 8] . Ultraviolet (UV), a common disinfection and oxidation method, can activate PS (UV/PS process) to produce SO4 \u2022-(Eq. (1)) [9] , which has a high redox potential (E o SO 4\n\n\u2022-= 2.5-3.1 V) [10] that is comparable to or slightly higher than that of HO \u2022 (E o HO \u2022 = 1.9-2.7 V) [11] .\n\nThe resulting chain reactions are summarized in Table S1 (Eqs. (S6)-(S14)), and the generated secondary reactive oxygen species (ROSs) mainly include HO \u2022 , HO2 \u2022 /O2 \u2022-, SO5 \u2022-, and S2O8 \u2022-. 4 2 2 8 254 4 SO synthetic silica in the production of the lamp tube, LP mercury lamps can deliver two major resonance lines at 185 and 254 nm (i.e., vacuum-UV (VUV)/UV irradiation), and the manufacturing and operating costs of VUV/UV LP mercury lamps are close to those of a conventional LP mercury lamp [13] . VUV (185 nm) readily photolyzes H2O into HO \u2022 by homolysis and ionization (Eqs. (2) and (3)) [14] . Moreover, recent studies found that organic pollutant degradation in a UV/chlorine process when a VUV/UV lamp was used as the light source (VUV/UV/chlorine process) was more efficient than that of conventional UV irradiation (UV/chlorine process) owing to the additional formation of HO \u2022 (Eqs. (2) and (3)) [14] and the synergistic effect [13] . Therefore, VUV/UV LP mercury lamps could serve as a highly efficient light source for UV-based AOPs.\n\nHowever, the application of the VUV/UV/PS process in water treatment has not been studied. Thus, it is necessary to explore organic pollutant degradation by this highly efficient AOP. \n\nAs a cationic dye, methylene blue (MB) that is hard to degrade by traditional technologies can cause various potential health risks to humans and induce significant problems to ecological systems [15, 16] . The removal kinetics and mechanisms of MB under different conditions (such as various impact factors and real waters) using chemical [13, [17] [18] [19] and physical technologies [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] have been discussed with drawbacks of the generation of iron sludge, difficulties in separation and regeneration of catalysts, membrane fouling, and high cost. UV-based AOPs were found to be highly efficient for removing MB, which is commonly used as a model organic pollutant J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f [13, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] with good stability under UV irradiation and easy detection. Moreover, when combined with the previously developed mini-fluidic VUV/UV photoreaction system (MVPS; Fig. S1 ) [13] , MB concentration can be measured precisely and rapidly with an online UV-Vis spectrophotometer during its degradation in the UV-based AOPs, which could avoid sampling errors and reduce the workload.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate MB degradation kinetics by the VUV/UV/PS process based on the MVPS, which was found to be suitable for estimating the impact of VUV on organic pollutant degradation during VUV/UV irradiation. The effects of solution pH and water matrix components were assessed, and the main ROSs and their consumption distributions in different types of real water were elucidated. Additionally, the pH impact on the photon absorption distributions was explored to understand the roles of direct photolysis (VUV and UV) and indirect oxidation by various oxidants at different pH levels. This study proposes a new UV-based AOP for water treatment, which could be used for highly efficient organic pollutant removal.\n\nAll chemical reagents were of analytical grade or higher. Anisole (AS), methanol J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cm) produced by a Milli-Q water purification system (Advantage A10, Millipore, USA).\n\nFiltered water (FW), surface water (SW), and secondary wastewater effluent (WE)\n\nwere collected from a local drinking water treatment plant, an urban river, and a municipal wastewater treatment plant, respectively (Beijing, China). All water samples were immediately transported to the laboratory in a portable refrigerator, vacuumfiltered through 0.45-\u03bcm membrane filters to remove any particles, and stored at 4 \u00b0C prior to analysis and testing.\n\nAll photochemical experiments were conducted at least thrice in the MVPS (Fig.   S1 ), the structure of which was described in a previous study [13] . S2 ). As the reaction solution was recirculated between unexposed (Teflon connection tube wrapped in black tape) and exposed (VUV/UV or UV tube) sections of the MVPS, a reduction equivalent exposure time (tree, s) was determined as the total reaction time (t, 600 s) multiplied by the ratio of the exposed volume of the operation tube (\u03c0r 2 l, cm 3 ) to the total volume of the reaction solution (V, 100 cm 3 ) [20] . Therefore, the VUV (Fp,VUV), UV (Fp,UV), and total J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Fp,tot) photon fluences (einstein m -2 ) can be calculated as follows [13] :\n\nwhere r and l are the radius and length of the VUV/UV or UV tube (cm), respectively.\n\nThe solution pH was measured using an EF-20K pH meter (Mettler, Switzerland). \u03bcm) (Waters, USA) (Text S1). In all figures, the relative standard deviations for all data points is less than 5%, and the error bars represent the standard deviations (n = 3).\n\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Table S1 ). Rapid MB degradation was observed in the VUV/UV process (k\uf0a2VUV/UV = 251.2 m 2 einstein -1 ), which generated HO \u2022 from the VUV photolysis of H2O (Eqs. (2) and (3)) [14] . After adding PS, MB degradation during the VUV/UV/PS process (k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS) was significantly higher than that under VUV/UV irradiation owing to the additional indirect oxidation by SO4 \u2022generated during the VUV and UV photolysis of PS. Additionally, k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS (327.6 m 2 einstein -1 ) was 3.2 times higher than k\uf0a2UV/PS as more ROSs were produced by the VUV photolysis of H2O and PS. \n\nAs an important impact factor, the solution pH has been reported to notably affect the acid-base speciation of solutes (such as organic pollutants and oxidants) and other physicochemical properties of solution [22, 23] . Therefore, k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS and TOC removal ratio in the VUV/UV/PS process at different pH levels were studied and are shown in Fig. 2 . k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS increased within a pH range of 3.0-7.0, and then decreased J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f as the solution pH further increased from 7.0 to 11.0; the highest k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS was observed at pH 7.0. However, the TOC removal ratio steadily decreased with increasing solution pH. The required levels of target parent pollutant and TOC (or chemical oxygen demand) removal in practical water treatment differ. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms behind the different trends of k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS and TOC removal ratio at various pH levels, which could be useful for selecting an economic treatment strategy according to the specific requirements of a certain scenario (this is discussed in detail in Section 3.6). (Eqs (S6), (S9), (S10), and (S11); Table S1 ), SO4 \u2022formation by the photolysis (VUV and UV) of PS and the reaction of HO \u2022 with PS (Eq. (S10); Table S1 ) was enhanced, thus leading to a higher k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS value. Table S2 ) [23, 24] . Although J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f UV could activate HA to generate different reactive species (such as 1 O2 and aq e \uf02d ) [23, 25, 26] , their contributions to MB degradation were assumed to be ignored herein.\n\nFour typical anions (HCO3 -, Cl -, NO3 -, and SO4 2-) were also found to inhibit MB degradation. All added anions and/or their transformations (such as H2CO3, CO3 2-, and NO2 -) rapidly reacted with HO \u2022 and/or SO4 \u2022at rate constants ranging from 2.1 \u00d7 10 6 to 1.4 \u00d7 10 10 M -1 s -1 (Table S2 ) [11, 13] , which could produce secondary reactive species (such as CO3 \u2022-, Cl2 \u2022-, and NO3 \u2022 ) with lower reactivities, thereby reducing MB removal.\n\nAdditionally, anions and their transformations could also compete with other solution components (such as H2O, MB, and PS) for VUV and UV photons (Fig. S4 ), hence weakening ROS generation and MB degradation by direct photolysis.\n\nIron is one of the most common transition metals in aquatic environments. Fig. 3 shows that the addition of 1.0-5.0 \u03bcM Fe(II) or 1.0-2.5 \u03bcM Fe(III) slightly increased k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS, because more ROSs could be generated in the presence of low iron concentrations (Eqs. (S15)-(S18); Table S1 ). However, higher Fe(II) (> 5.0 \u03bcM) or Fe(III) (> 2.5 \u03bcM) concentrations negatively affected k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS, which could be attributed to the high level of HO \u2022 and SO4 \u2022scavenging by iron (Eqs. (S19) and (S20); Table S1 ) [27, 28] and competition for VUV and UV photons (Fig. S4 ). \u2022-= 1.1 V) [29, 30] . TBA was selected as a scavenger for HO \u2022 owing to its high rate constant with HO \u2022 ((3.8-7.6) \u00d7 10 8 M -1 s -1 ; Table S2 ) and low rate constant with SO4 \u2022-((4.0-9.1) \u00d7 10 5 M -1 s -1 ; Table S2 ) [27] . As it shares high rate constants with both HO \u2022 (9.7 \u00d7 10 8 M -1 s -1 ; Table S2 ) [11] and SO4 \u2022-(2.5 \u00d7 10 7 M -1 s -1 ; Table S2 ) [10] ,\n\nMeOH was used to effectively scavenge both of these ROSs. (Fig. S5b) , kMB,HO \u2022 and kMB,SO 4 \u2022-were calculated to be 3.8 \u00d7 10 9 and 3.1 \u00d7 10 9 M -1 s -1 , respectively. To assess the practical performance of the VUV/UV/PS process, MB was used as a model organic pollutant and added to three real waters (FW, SW, and WE), the sources and major water quality parameters of which are summarized in Table S3 . Fig. S6 shows that k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS in FW, SW, and WE were 0.6%, 6.4%, and 21.7% lower than that in Milli-Q water. This demonstrates that the VUV/UV/PS process would be feasible for organic pollutant degradation removal in practice.\n\nThe consumption distributions of HO \u2022 and SO4 \u2022among the major matrix components in different water samples during MB degradation by the VUV/UV/PS process were calculated using Eq. (8) [31] (Fig. 4) .\n\nwhere Ri,j and ki,j are the ROS consumption fraction (%) and second-order rate constant Table S3 ) contained in the water samples (Fig. S6 ). This could be due to the higher reaction rate constants between HA\n\nand ROSs (such as HO \u2022 and SO4 \u2022-) than those between the DOC contained in the water samples and ROSs [23, 35] . Mckay et al. [36] also observed that the reaction rate J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f constants between organic matter and HO \u2022 ranged from 1.21 \u00d7 10 8 to 9.37 \u00d7 10 8 M -1 s - \n\nHowever, Fig. 4b shows that there was a considerable difference in the consumption distributions of SO4 \u2022and HO \u2022 . Cl -(67.5%-82.2%) was the main component responsible for SO4 \u2022consumption, followed by MB (11.4%-21.6%). DOC and HCO3scavenged less than 10% of the SO4 \u2022-. Additionally, the SO4 \u2022fractions consumed by PS and NO3with rate constants of 6.1 \u00d7 10 5 and 2.1 \u00d7 10 6 M -1 s -1 (Table   S2 ) [10, 40] , respectively, were negligible (0.2%-1.0%). following the methods that were described in a previous study [20] , and are shown in Fig. 5a . Taking into consideration the fractions of both VUV and UV photons absorbed by each solution component, it is reasonable to expect that the dominant degradation mechanism could differ at various pH levels (i.e., the solution pH would affect the contributions of direct photolysis and indirect oxidation to MB degradation).\n\nTo quantitatively estimate the roles of photolysis and oxidation in MB degradation at different pH levels, the specific reaction rate constants for MB degradation by VUV photolysis (k\uf0a2VUV), UV photolysis (i.e., k\uf0a2UV), HO \u2022 oxidation (k\uf0a2HO \u2022 ), SO 4 \u2022oxidation (k\uf0a2SO 4 \u2022-), and oxidation by other reactive species (k\uf0a2other) at various pH levels were determined (Fig. 5b) following the methods described in Text S3. increased [46] . Additionally, the concentration of HPO4 2-, which could react with ROSs more rapidly than the reaction between H2PO4and ROSs (Table S2) As shown in Fig. 5b , the k\uf0a2VUV and k\uf0a2UV values increased from 3.1 to 11.2 m 2 einstein -1 and from 7.8 to 25.7 m 2 einstein -1 , respectively, with increasing solution pH.\n\nTo evaluate the pH-dependence, \u03b5MB and the direct photolysis rate constants of MB (k\uf0a2d,MB) were determined at various pH levels (Fig. 6) . \u03b5MB,185 clearly decreased within pH ranges of 3.2-4.8 and 9.4-11.3, but remained almost unchanged at other pH levels;\n\nwhile \u03b5MB,254 was almost pH-independent (Fig. 6a) . The variations in \u03b5MB with the solution pH were modeled by assigning each existing species to a specific \u03b5 (\u03b5MB+, \u03b5MB0,\n\nand \u03b5MB-). The apparent absorbance of MB solution was equal to the sum of absorbance attributed to each existing species (Eq. (11)) [47] .\n\nwhere \u03b1MB+, \u03b1MB0, and \u03b1MBare the distribution coefficients of MB + , MB 0 , and MB -, respectively. The results in Fig. 6a indicate that the modeling results agreed well with the experimental data. \u03b5MB+, \u03b5MB0, and \u03b5MBwere calculated and are shown in Table 1 . Table 1 The \n\nk\uf0a2d,MB-was higher than k\uf0a2d,MB+ and k\uf0a2d,MB0, which was similar to the results of k\uf0a2UV and k\uf0a2VUV presented in Fig. 5b . The quantum yields (\u0424) of each existing species (\u0424MB-, \u0424MB0, and \u0424MB+) could be readily calculated using Eq. (13) [49] , and are presented in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f \n\nThe contributions of oxidation by PS and other reactive species to MB degradation could be ignored. Therefore, the maximum apparent k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS value (i.e., the summation of various k\uf0a2 values) was observed at pH 7.0. Under the tested pH of 3.0-11.0, indirect HO \u2022 and SO4 \u2022oxidation mainly contributed to MB degradation. However, with an increase in the solution pH, the roles of direct VUV and UV photolysis became more important. As indirect oxidation was more effective for mineralizing MB and its intermediate products than direct photolysis, the above analysis of the effect of pH on the degradation mechanism can explain the different trends of the variations in MB degradation (discoloration) and TOC removal with increasing solution pH (Fig. 2) .\n\nThe results in Fig. 1 indicate that the k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS was almost the same as the sum of k\uf0a2VUV/UV and k\uf0a2UV/PS, suggesting that the synergistic enhancement of organic pollutant degradation observed in the VUV/UV/chlorine process [13, 35] (Table S4 ) suggest a good application potential of the VUV/UV/PS process in effectively degrading organic pollutants.\n\nAdditionally, it is found that the trends of k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS and the TOC removal ratio with increasing solution pH in the VUV/UV/PS process differed (Fig. 2) , and the mechanism was elucidated. This approach could be used to develop an economic treatment strategy (such as adjusting the solution pH before treating organic pollutants by the VUV/UV/PS process) in practical water treatment according to the specific requirements (parent compound or TOC elimination), target organic pollutant properties, and practical water matrices.\n\nIn this study, MB degradation in an aqueous solution by the VUV/UV/PS process was investigated. The following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results:\n\n\u2022 MB degradation by the VUV/UV/PS process was more rapid than that in the conventional UV/PS process. Increasing PS dose enhanced MB degradation, while the addition of HA, HCO3 -, Cl -, NO3 -, and SO4 2inhibited MB degradation to different degrees. The effects of Fe(II) and Fe(III) were dependent on the iron concentrations.\n\n\u2022 Unlike the steady decrease in the TOC removal ratio, k\uf0a2VUV/UV/PS first increased and then decreased with increasing solution pH. This is because various pH levels induced different roles of photolysis and oxidation. Increasing solution pH increased the contributions of direct VUV and UV photolysis to MB degradation, but were ineffective in mineralizing MB and its intermediate products.\n\n\u2022 HO \u2022 and SO4 \u2022were identified as the two dominant ROSs and were mainly consumed by the DOC and Clin real waters, respectively. The tests conducted in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f real waters demonstrate that the VUV/UV/PS process has a good potential for highly efficient removal of organic pollutant in practice.\n\n\u2022 As the parent compound and TOC are two different objects for removal in water treatment, this study may provide an economic treatment strategy that can be adjusted according to the specific requirements of a certain scenario.\n\nAuthor's Name Author's Contribution\n\nThe first author: completing most of the experiments, analyzing experimental data, and writing article.\n\nThe second author: lab assistant.\n\nThe third author: lab assistant.\n\nThe fourth author: proposing research direction, guiding experiment, and modifying article.\n\nThe fifth and corresponding author: providing research approach, guiding experiment, and modifying article.\n\nThe authors declare that the work under consideration for publication was only "}
