{"title": "Evolutionary proteomics uncovers ciliary signaling components 1 2", "body": "The development of multicellular animals, involving complex cell movements, growth, 41 patterning and differentiation, is orchestrated through intercellular communication. During and 42 after development, some forms of cell-cell communications require cilia (Goetz and Anderson, 43 2010) . Similarly, certain forms of intercellular communication that occur among single-celled 44 organisms, such as mating in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas, involve cilia (Pan and 45 Snell, 2000; Solter and Gibor, 1977; Wang et al., 2006) . In addition to sensing signals from other 46 cells, cilia in both unicellular protozoa and multicellular animals can sense environmental stimuli 47\n\nWe discovered that dibucaine, a compound used to isolate flagella from Chlamydomonas 146 and Tetrahymena, caused choanoflagellate cells in rosette colonies to release their flagella 147 (Thompson et al., 1974; Witman, 1986) . In Chlamydomonas, diabucaine severs cilia distal to the 148 basal body and transition zone (Sanders and Salisbury, 1994) . After amputating flagella from 149 colonial choanoflagellates ( Figure 1B) , we used sucrose gradient centrifugation and fractionation 150 to separate microvilli and cell bodies from isolated cilia. Again, immunofluorescent imaging and 151 immunoblot analysis revealed that the ciliary fraction was highly enriched for TUB ac , whereas 152 the microvilli fraction was enriched for Actin ( Figure 1G and H) . 153\n\nTo identify the ciliary proteomes of these species, we analyzed the isolated cilia and 154 flagella by mass spectrometry. We performed mass spectrometric protein profiling on 155 unfractionated purified sea urchin cilia (whole cilia), the isolated axonemal fraction (axonemes) 156 and the non-axonemal fraction (membrane plus matrix). Due to the tractability of obtaining large 157 quantities of sea urchin cilia, we were able analyze cilia isolated from three separate embryo 158 cultures at two different developmental stages. We separated the peptides from unfractionated 159 whole cilia using two distinct methods of chromatography: pre-fractionated by hydrophilic 160 interaction chromatography followed by C18 LC-MS/MS or LC-MS/MS using a high resolution 161 C18 column and an extended reverse phase gradient. For the mass spectrometry data analyses, 162 we chose a low-stringency cut-off to capture signaling proteins: proteins with a unique peptide 163 count of 2 or more were included for future analysis (Table S1) . 164\n\nFor isolated sea anemone cilia, we analyzed whole cilia from sucrose gradient fractions 165 containing peak levels of TUB ac from two individual embryo cultures ( Figure 1E , fractions 6 and 166 7). As with the sea urchin, to further increase the diversity of peptides that we could identify, we 167 separated peptides using the two distinct methods of chromatography described above. 168\n\nTo obtain a sufficient amount of material for mass spectrometry of choanoflagellate cilia, 169 we performed two separate cilia preparations and pooled the samples before analysis. The 170 sample was fractionated by high resolution reverse phase before mass spectrometry. To identify 171 proteins selectively enriched in choanoflagellate flagella, we analyzed fractions containing cell 172 bodies (fraction 1) and microvilli (fraction 10) alongside the ciliary fractions (fractions 4 and 5) 173 ( Figure 1G ). We defined proteins with a ciliary fraction peptide count higher than that of the cell 174 body and microvilli fraction as candidate members of the choanoflagellate ciliary proteome, or 175 'ciliome '. 176 Metazoan developmental signaling pathways are proposed to have emerged with the 177 advent of multicellularity or with major transitions in animal evolution (Pincus et al., 2008; 178 Pires-daSilva and Sommer, 2003). Many signal transduction components are membrane-179 associated, suggesting that the membrane plus matrix fraction of sea urchin cilia would be 180 enriched for signal transduction components relative to the axonemal fraction. Therefore, we 181 calculated the degree of membrane plus matrix enrichment for each sea urchin protein by 182 comparing its peptide count in the membrane plus matrix fraction to that of the axonemal 183 fraction ( Figure 2C and Table S2 ). 184\n\nComparing the data from the sea urchin whole cilia, axonemes and membrane plus matrix 185 revealed that some proteins identified in ciliary fractions were not detected in the whole cilia 186 data ( Figure 2C ), suggesting that fractionation increased the sensitivity of peptide detection. 187\n\nConversely, a small subset of proteins detected in the early gastrula whole cilia fraction were not 188 detected in the ciliary fraction, likely due to enrichment by hydrophilic interaction 189 chromatography. All other sea urchin samples were analyzed exclusively by reverse phase 190 chromatography. As expected, previously identified axonemal proteins (e.g., IFTs, motor 191 proteins, Tektins) were enriched in the axonemal fraction ( Figure 2C ). Also as expected, 192 previously identified ciliary membrane-associated proteins (e.g., PKD1, BBS3, RAB8A) were 193 enriched in the membrane plus matrix fraction ( Figure 2C From the isolated cilia of three organisms, we identified peptides corresponding to over 200 3,000 proteins in total (Table 1 and S1). As we are most interested in the evolution of ciliary 201 signaling in the progression from the unicellular ancestors of animals to humans, we focused on 202 those proteins with a homolog in mammals. BLAST identified 1,266 ciliome proteins with a 203 homolog in mouse (Table 1 and S1), a set we termed the 'conserved ciliome'. As expected based 204 on their evolutionary distances to mammals, the sea urchin ciliome contains the greatest number 205 of mammalian homologs (1, 012) , followed by the sea anemone (511) and choanoflagellate 206 ciliomes (311), respectively (Table 1, Figure 3A ). 207\n\nAs a first assessment of the ciliome, we compared the ciliary members of the SYSCILIA 208 Gold Standard database, a list of well characterized proteins involved in cilia biology (van Dam 209 et al., 2013) , to each organism's ciliome. Of the SYSCILIA Gold Standard proteins present in 210 cilia, 69% were present in the sea urchin ciliome (Tables 1 and S3 confidence that they represent bona fide ciliary components ( Figure 3A , Table S1 highlighted in 218 blue). To begin to assess whether this 'high-confidence ciliome' encompasses evolutionarily 219 conserved ciliary components, we compared it to proteins implicated in ciliary biology by 19 220 genomic, expression and proteomic studies in diverse unicellular and multicellular ciliated 221 organisms (see Table S4 confidence ciliome proteins has been previously implicated in ciliary biology (Table S1) . 227\n\nAs the closest known living relative of animals, we hypothesized that choanoflagellate 228 cilia would contain proteins conserved in mammals that are not present in the cilia of protozoa 229 more distantly related to animals. To test this hypothesis, we compared the choanoflagellate 230 ciliome to that of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the flagella of which have been well characterized 231 by mass spectrometry (Pazour et al., 2005) . We found that out of the 465 proteins in the 232 choanoflagellate ciliome, 267 did not have a homolog in the C. reinhardtii ciliome (Table S3) . 233\n\nOf the choanoflagellate ciliome proteins not present in the C. reinhardtii ciliome, over half (157 234 proteins) had a homolog in the mouse, indicating that these protein are not unique to 235 choanoflagellates and may represent ciliary proteins that emerged after the evolutionary 236 divergence of Chlamydomonas from the lineage that would give rise to animals. 237\n\nAs a final test of whether the ciliomes represent a broad survey of ciliary components, we 238 examined whether ciliopathy-associated proteins were identified in the conserved ciliome. 239\n\nSeventy-four of the conserved ciliome proteins are mutated in a ciliopathy, including 11 proteins 240 associated with Bardet-Biedl-Syndrome (BBS), both proteins associated with autosomal 241 recessive PKD, 13 proteins associated with short rib thoracic dysplasia, and 21 proteins 242 associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) (Table S1) . 243\n\nThus, we hypothesized that high-confidence ciliome constituents not associated with 244 ciliopathies are candidates that may explain the etiologies of orphan ciliopathies. For example, 245 one high-confidence ciliome member, coiled-coil domain containing 63 (CCDC63), was recently 246 identified as being essential for mouse sperm flagella formation, suggesting that it could be a 247 ciliary protein linked to male fertility (Young et al., 2015) . Other ciliome constituents may also 248 indicate ciliary etiologies for syndromes not previously recognized as ciliopathies. For example, 249 WD-repeat domain 65 (WDR65, also known as CFAP57), was identified in all three ciliomes 250 and is associated with van der Woude syndrome, a craniofacial malformation with features 251 similar to that of Orofaciodigital syndrome, a recognized ciliopathy (Rorick et al., 2011) . 252\n\nWe also assessed whether these ciliomes have predictive power to identify previously 253 undescribed ciliary components. C4orf22 (1700007G11Rik), C9orf116 (1700007K13Rik), 254 suggesting that they may be previously unrecognized components of motile cilia (Uhl\u00e9n et al., 260 2015) . We expressed LAP-tagged versions of select candidates and assessed their localization in 261 IMCD3 cells. C4orf47 (1700029J07Rik), for example, localizes to cytoplasmic microtubules and 262 cilia ( Figure 3B ). Others, including Coiled-coil domain containing 113 (CCDC113) and Casein 263 kinase 1\u03b4 (CSNK1D) localized predominantly to the base of cilia ( Figure 3B ). 264\n\nMany proteins in the high-confidence ciliome are known to localize to and function 265 within mammalian cilia, but others, like C4orf47, have not previously been identified as ciliary 266\n\nproteins. To estimate what proportion of proteins in the high-confidence ciliome are bona fide 267 ciliary proteins in mammals, we randomly selected 49 proteins from the high-confidence ciliome 268 and tested if the GFP-tagged human homolog localized to cilia of IMCD3 cells (Table S5 ). We 269 also tested the localization 30 randomly selected human proteins not identified in the ciliome. 270\n\nBased on proportion of the human genome encoding known ciliary proteins, we expected that 1-271 3 proteins would localized to cilia. Four of the randomly selected proteins localized to cilia 272 ( Figure S1A) , suggesting that the test is specific. Of the 49 randomly selected candidate ciliary 273 proteins, 10 localized to the cilium or the ciliary base ( Figure 3C and S1B). Included in the 49 274 proteins were 8 SYSCILIA Gold Standard proteins, one of which localized to cilia, indicating 275 that this test is not sensitive. Based on the proportion of candidate ciliary proteins that localized 276 to cilia and the low sensitivity of the localization assay, greater than 20% of the proteins in the 277 high-confidence ciliome are likely to localize to human cilia. 278\n\nWe hypothesized that some proteins in the ciliome localize specifically to motile cilia, 279\n\nand not to primary cilia. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether proteins that did not 280 localize to IMCD3 primary cilia can localize to the motile cilia of the zebrafish Kupffer's 281 vesicle. CCDC37 (CFAP100) and PIN1, two proteins that did not localize to primary cilia in 282 IMCD3 cells, localized to motile cilia of the zebrafish embryo ( Figure 3D and S1C). Unlike 283 CCDC37, PIN1 localized to some, but not all primary cilia in the zebrafish embryo. Conversely, 284 CCDC170 localized to the base of primary cilia in IMCD3 cells and in the zebrafish embryo, but 285 did not localize to the motile cilia of Kupffer's vesicle. These data reveal that some proteins 286 localize specifically to either motile or primary cilia. 287 288\n\nMany ciliary components show a taxonomic distribution consistent with being present in 290 the last common eukaryotic ancestor and lost from organisms that have lost cilia, such as many 291 plants and fungi (Li et al., 2004) . To test whether components of the sea urchin, sea anemone and 292 choanoflagellate ciliomes display a taxonomic distribution paralleling the distribution of cilia, we 293 used a computational algorithm, CLustering by Inferred Models of Evolution (CLIME), to map 294 proteins onto a phylogeny that includes prokaryotes and 136 ciliated and unciliated eukaryotes 295 (Li et al., 2014) . 15% of ciliome components displayed a taxonomic distribution closely 296 mirroring the presence of cilia (Figure 4A, S2 and Table S6 ). In addition to many recognized 297 ciliary components, such as IFT and BBSome, high-confidence ciliome components, such as 298 ENKUR, TRPM3, Zinc finger MYND-type containing 12 (ZMYND12) and Sperm tail PG rich 299 repeat containing 2 (STPG2) showed distributions consistent with co-evolving with cilia. The 300 presence of these genes in the genomes of diverse ciliated eukaryotes suggests that they may 301 have evolutionarily ancient functions in cilia. 302\n\nTo trace the ancestry of known ciliary signaling pathways, we also examined whether 303 previously identified components of these pathways were present in the sea urchin, sea anemone 304 and choanoflagellate ciliomes. Choanoflagellate genomes do not contain genes for most Hh 305 pathway components, suggesting that they do not use Hh signaling for intercellular 306 communication (King et al., 2008) . Analysis of whether ciliary Hh pathway components were 307 present in the sea urchin and sea anemone ciliomes revealed that, although canonical Hh IQ domain-containing protein E (IQCE) and EF-hand calcium binding domain-containing 319 protein 7 (EFCAB7), regulate Hh signaling by anchoring EVC and EVC2 to the proximal cilium 320 (Pusapati et al., 2014) . IQCE was present in the sea urchin ciliome and EFCAB7 was present in 321 the sea anemone ciliome. 322\n\nIn addition to EVC and EVC2, we identified two paralogs, EVC3.1 and EVC3.2 323 (Pusapati et al., 2014) , in the choanoflagellate, sea anenome and sea urchin ciliomes ( Figure 4B ). 324\n\nThe presence of EVC3 in the ciliomes suggests that the association between cilia and the EVC 325 family extends beyond metazoans to early-branching eukaryotes. As EVC3.1 and EVC3.2 are 326 missing from the genomes of some mammals, including humans, it appears that, whereas 327 mammals have preserved much of the ciliary repertoire of basal organisms, some have 328 selectively lost at least two ciliary proteins. 329 All rights reserved.

For example, odorant 330 receptors act at olfactory epithelia cilia (Goetz and Anderson, 2010) . We identified four GPCRs 331 that have mouse homologs, none of which have been previously reported in cilia ( Figure 4B ). 332\n\nOther members of the GPCR signaling pathway, including G proteins, Arrestins and GPCR 333 kinases (GRKs), were identified in both the sea urchin and sea anemone ciliomes, suggesting that 334 not just GPCRs, but GPCR signal transduction has an ancient evolutionary connection to cilia 335 that precedes the advent of bilateria. 336\n\nTo assess whether some of the identified GPCR signaling proteins can localize to 337 mammalian cilia, we expressed a GFP-tagged version of a sea urchin homolog of Opioid 338 receptor \u00b51 (OPRM1) that we named OPRM1L in RPE-1 cells and found that it localized to cilia 339 ( Figure S3A ). The GPCR signal transduction component b-Arrestin-1/2 can localize to one end 340 of cilia (Pal et al., 2016) . As b-Arrestin-1 (ARRB1) was detected in the sea urchin ciliome, we 341 also examined the localization of sea urchin ARRB1-GFP in RPE-1 cells and found that, like the 342 mammalian ortholog, it was enriched at one ciliary end ( Figure S3B ). 343\n\nUnlike Hh and GPCR signaling proteins, TRP channels and TRP channel-associated 344 protein were detected in all three ciliomes ( Figure 4B ). PKD family members, previously known 345 to localize to cilia, were present in sea anemone and sea urchin cilia, as was TRPM3, a channel 346 that has multiple proposed functions, including heat sensation (Held et al., 2015) . A homolog of 347 TRPM2 was identified in the choanoflagellate cilia, suggesting that the association of TRP 348 channels with cilia arose before the emergence of animals. Also, Enkurin (ENKUR), a TRP 349 channel interacting protein (Sutton et al., 2004) , was detected in the ciliomes of all three 350 organisms and the Enkurin domain-containing protein, ENKD1, was detected in the sea anemone 351 ciliome. ENKUR was originally identified as a TRP channel interactor expressed by sperm 352 (Sutton et al., 2004) . The identification of ENKUR orthologs in choanoflagellate, sea anemone 353 and sea urchin ciliomes suggests a conserved ciliary function. As evolutionary conservation is 354 associated with increased likelihood of affecting fitness and disease (Hirsh and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/153437 doi: bioRxiv preprint From the analysis of cilia of diverse organisms, we sought to uncover conserved proteins 360 whose functions in ciliary biology had been unappreciated. As mammalian ENKUR has been 361 detected at the sperm flagellum (Sutton et al., 2004) , we wondered if ENKUR had functions in 362 cilia and if those functions were conserved in earlier branching animals. In addition to 363 identifying ENKUR in the ciliomes of choanoflagellates, sea anemones and sea urchins we found 364\n\nEnkur in the genome of diverse ciliated eukaryotes suggesting that it may have an evolutionarily 365 ancient function in cilia ( Figure S4 ). 366\n\nTo determine where in the invertebrate embryo Enkur is expressed we used in situ 367 hybridization to identify Enkur expression in sea anemone and sea urchin embryos throughout 368 gastrulation. In sea anemone embryos, early in gastrulation, Enkur was expressed in most cells, 369 with higher expression in a subset of cells distributed throughout the embryo ( Figure 5A and 370 S5A). Midway through gastrulation and into the late gastrula stage, Enkur expression was 371 maintained in the ectoderm and became enriched at the aboral end of the sea anemone embryo, 372 coincident with the apical organ, a group of cells that bear long cilia (termed the \"ciliary tuft\") 373\n\nand is hypothesized to have sensory function (Rentzsch et al., 2008) . 374\n\nIn the sea urchin embryo, Enkur is expressed in all cells from the mesenchyme blastula 375 stage, throughout gastrulation and into the prism stage, with peak expression during gastrulation. 376\n\nStrikingly, in early gastrulation, Enkur expression is enriched at the apical end of the embryo 377\n\nwhere the ciliary tuft is located ( Figure 5B and S5B). The expression pattern of Enkur in sea 378 urchin and sea anemone embryos suggests a conserved function for ENKUR in the ciliary tuft 379 that extends from early-branching eumazoans (all animals except sponges and placozoans) to 380 dueterostomes. 381\n\nTo determine if, as in the sea urchin and sea anemone, Enkur is expressed in motile 382 ciliated cells in vertebrate embryos, we used in situ hybridization to examine its expression in 383\n\nXenopus laevis embryos. We found that Enkur is expressed in motile ciliated cells distributed 384 throughout the epidermis ( Figure 5C ). In mouse, we confirmed by quantitative PCR that Enkur is 385 expressed exclusively in mouse tissues that possess motile cilia, such as the testes and trachea 386 ( Figure 5D and (Sutton et al., 2004) ). 387\n\nTo begin to assess the subcellular localization of sea urchin, sea anemone and 388 choanoflagellate ENKUR, we GFP-tagged ENKUR and analyzed its localization in ciliated 389 mammalian cells. We found that GFP-tagged sea urchin and choanoflagellate ENKUR proteins 390 localized to cilia if expressed in mammalian cells ( Figure 5E and F). To determine if ENKUR 391 localizes to cilia in vertebrates, we expressed GFP-ENKUR in X. laevis embryos and found that 392 it localized to the epidermal cell motile cilia ( Figure 5G ). Similarly, mouse ENKUR localized to 393 the motile cilia of tracheal epithelial cells ( Figure 5H and S5C) and the mammalian ortholog of 394 an ENKUR-related protein, ENKD1, localized predominantly to the base of cilia ( Figure  395 S5D). To further analyze ENKUR expression in the mouse, we utilized Enkur -/mice. Western 396 blot corroborated the ENKUR immunofluorescent staining, indicating that the protein is 397 expressed in trachea, and is absent from the trachea of Enkur -/mice ( Figure 5I ). 398\n\nIn mammals, specification of the left-right axis requires both ciliary motility and PKD2- To determine if ENKUR function is required for establishing the left-right axis, we 410 inhibited Enkur expression using a morpholino ( Figure S5E ). Whereas 95% of control embryos 411 displayed Pitx2c in the left lateral plate mesoderm, Pitx2c expression was absent in 76% of 412\n\nEnkur morphants, suggesting that ENKUR is required for left-right axis patterning in X. laevis 413 ( Figure 6C and D). 414\n\nThe left-right axis defect in Enkur morphant Xenopus led us to investigate if the 415 requirement for ENKUR in left-right patterning was conserved in mammals. We examined the 416 developmental expression of mouse Enkur by situ hybridization, which revealed that, similar to 417 X. laevis, 2-4 somite stage mouse embryos express Enkur exclusively in the node ( Figure 6E and 418 S5F). Immunofluorescent staining indicated that, again like X. laevis, ENKUR localizes to nodal 419 cilia, suggesting that mouse ENKUR may function in mouse left-right patterning ( Figure 6F ). 420 All rights reserved.

Half of the affected mice had situs inversus totalis, 422 a complete reversal of the left-right axis, and half displayed situs ambiguus, a variably abnormal 423 positioning of organs that includes misorientation of the heart, right-sided stomach or spleen, 424 asplenia, left-sided liver, and abnormal hepatic lobulation. Embryos that lack nodal cilia or have 425 non-motile nodal cilia exhibit a higher incidence of abnormal situs than do Enkur -/embryos 426 (Nonaka et al., 1998; Takeda et al., 1999) . The presence of left-right axis defects in a minority of 427\n\nEnkur -/mice indicates that axis specification is not entirely randomized in the absence of 428 ENKUR function. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/153437 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nA hallmark of human ciliopathies affecting nodal cilia is situs inversus (Afzelius, 1976) . 453\n\nWe identified a consanguineous Azerbijaini kindred with two progeny that display situs inversus 454 totalis ( Figure 7A c.224-1delG, that alters the splice acceptor site of the second ENKUR intron ( Figure 7D , Table  461 S7). Sanger sequencing confirmed that this variant co-segregated with the phenotype and showed 462 a recessive pattern of inheritance in the kindred ( Figure 7E ). Together, these data suggest that 463 homozygous mutations in ENKUR are a cause of situs inversus in humans. 464\n\nTo assess the effect of the homozygous mutation on ENKUR, we examined the motile 465 cilia of nasal epithelial cells isolated from the respiratory tracts of both affected individuals and 466 an unaffected control. We found that human ENKUR localizes to nasal epithelial cilia ( (Table S8 ). Whereas individuals with disrupted ciliary motility produce 487 reduced levels of nasal nitric oxide (Lundberg et al., 1994) , the nasal nitric oxide production 488 rates of the two individuals with situs inversus were 155 ml/min and 234 ml/min, exceeding the 489 77 ml/min production rate below which is consistent with PCD (Table S8 ). According to these 490 measures, the respiratory ciliary function of both individuals with homozygous ENKUR 491 mutations was normal. 492\n\nTo determine if, like humans, ENKUR is dispensable for ciliary motility in the 493 respiratory tract of mice, we analyzed airway cilia of Enkur -/mice. We analyzed the beating of 494 cilia on tracheal epithelial cells of Enkur -/mice and discovered that, like humans, the motility of 495 mutant cilia was not distinguishable from wild type (Supplemental video S3 and S4). 496\n\nTogether, these data demonstrate that ENKUR is a highly conserved ciliary protein that is 497 not required for ciliary motility in the airway, but that is required for left-right axis determination 498\n\nin Xenopus and mice. Furthermore, when mutated, Enkur may be a cause of situs inverus in 499 humans. 500 501 DISCUSSION 502\n\nCommunication of environmental or intercellular information is a critical function of the 503 cilia of organisms from diverse phyla throughout Eukarya. In vertebrates, the signaling functions 504 of cilia are especially important for sight, olfaction and development. At what points in animal 505 evolution did different signaling pathways become associated with cilia? Whereas the structural 506 proteins that make up cilia are conserved among most ciliated Eukaryotes, including humans, 507 few metazoan signaling proteins are conserved outside of the animal kingdom. Therefore, we 508 identified ciliary proteins from organisms representing major steps in animal evolution: 509 choanoflagellates, whose phylogenetic position informs the origin of multicellular animals, sea 510 anemones, radially symmetric sister group to bilaterally symmetric animals, and sea urchins, 511 basal Deuterostomes that provide insights into the ancestor of chordates. 512 All rights reserved.

Many of the identified proteins with homologs in mammals, the 515 conserved ciliome, had a phylogenetic distribution paralleling the presence of cilia: present in 516 ciliated organism of the Animal, Plant, Fungi and Protist kingdoms but lost from unciliated 517 organisms within these groups. These ciliary proteins are therefore likely to have been present in 518 the last common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes, a ciliated organism. 519\n\nOne protein that we identified in the ciliomes of choanoflagellates, sea anenomes and sea 520 urchins, suggesting that it became associated with ciliary function before the emergence of 521 animals, was ENKUR, a highly conserved protein found in diverse ciliated eukaryotes. We found 522 that Enkur is expressed in tissues with motile ciliated cells, including those with single cilia (i.e., 523\n\nXenopus and mouse nodal cells, sea anemone and sea urchin embryonic epithelial cells) and 524 those with multiple cilia (i.e., mouse tracheal epithelial cells, Xenopus embryonic epidermal 525 cells). In addition, ENKUR from animals and choanoflagellates localizes to cilia, raising the 526 possibility that it acts within cilia to generate or respond to fluid flow. Mutation of Enkur in the 527 mouse did not compromise ciliary beat frequency in tracheal epithelial cells, indicating that, 528 unlike many ciliary proteins with expression patterns and phylogenetic distributions similar to 529 ENKUR (e.g., outer arm dyneins), it is not essential for ciliary motility. Instead, ENKUR is 530 required for patterning of the left-right axis in both Xenopus and mouse, suggesting that it is 531 required for some aspect of ciliary beating or signaling in the embryonic node. Significantly, 532 humans with a homozygous mutation in ENKUR displayed inversion of their left-right axis, but 533 no signs of defective mucociliary clearance, suggesting that human ENKUR loss of function does 534 not cause PCD, but may be a cause situs inversus. 535 ENKUR has previously been shown to interact with TRP channels and calcium signaling 536 proteins, suggesting that it may bridge the gap between TRP channels and downstream signaling 537 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/153437 doi: bioRxiv preprint (Tisler et al., 2016; Warner et al., 2016 ). PKD2 has also been shown to be expressed in the 544 ciliary tuft of sea urchin embryos, a structure hypothesized to have sensory function (Tisler et al., 545 2016) . We found that, like PKD2, Enkur mRNA is enriched in the cells of both the sea urchin 546 and sea anemone ciliary tuft. It will be of great interest to assess whether ENKUR regulates or 547 interprets calcium responses in nodal, archenteron or tuft cilia. 548\n\nIn addition to ENKUR, we identified 130 other proteins in the ciliomes of all three 549 organisms examined here. As expected, these proteins included many recognized to have 550 evolutionarily ancient ciliary roles, including structural components (e.g., Tektin-1, \u03b2-Tubulin), 551 intraflagellar transport (e.g., IFT57, IFT80, IFT81, IFT122, IFT172) and ciliary movement (e.g., 552\n\naxonemal dyneins, Nexin-Dynein regulatory complex components, radial spoke proteins, 553 SPAG17, HYDIN). Other highly conserved ciliary proteins, such as components of the transition 554 zone and basal body, were not detected as our methods amputated cilia distal to the basal bodies 555 and transition zones (Sanders and Salisbury, 1994; Stephens, 1995) . Similarly, we did not detect 556 ciliopathy-associated proteins that are not ciliary components, such as those PCD-associated 557 proteins that function within the cytoplasm to assembly dynein arms (Kott et In addition to EVC and EVC2, we identified a structurally related protein called EVC3 in 571 the ciliomes of sea urchins, sea anemone and choanoflagellates. The phylogenetic distribution of 572 the EVC complex components and EVC3 suggests that EVC3 may represent an ancestral ciliary 573 protein, with EVC and EVC2 emerging in multicellular animals as regulators of Hh signaling 574 All rights reserved.

Perhaps 600 some of these diseases are caused by defects in cilia, as discussed for WDR65 and van der 601 Woude syndrome, above. Beyond WDR65, we identified RAB28 in the sea anemone ciliome, 602 mutations in which are associated with a form of retinitis pigmentosa called progressive rod-cone 603 dystrophy 18 (Cord18) (Roosing et al., 2013) . Therefore, we hypothesize that Cord18 is caused 604 by RAB28-associated dysfunction of the photoreceptor outer segment. Similarly, we identified 605 All rights reserved.

We predict that, like ENKUR and situs inversus, other ciliome 607 members identified here will prove to underlie orphan ciliopathies. 608\n\nThe identification of an extensive compilation of ciliary proteins from organisms at key 609 phylogenetic nodes has shed light on the evolutionary history of ciliary signaling proteins, 610\n\nsuggesting that ciliary signaling pathways, such as Hh and GPCR signaling, evolved before the 611 emergence of Bilaterians or, in the case of TRP channel signaling, before the emergence of 612 animals. Using evolutionary proteomics, we identified previously uncharacterized ciliary 613 proteins, including ENKUR, which our data suggest may underlie a human disease, 614 demonstrating promise for further studies of ciliome members and for future applications of 615 evolutionary proteomics. The use of the ciliomes to identify an evolutionarily conserved function 616 for ENKUR illustrates how a protein's evolutionary association with an organelle can help 617 elucidate its function. 618\n\nOur cilia proteomics approach has provided insights into the evolutionary history of 619 ciliary signaling proteins and identified previously unknown cilia proteins. Similar to the 620 analysis brought to bear on cilia here, we propose that proteomic profiling of other organelles, 621 such as mitochondria or lysosomes, from multiple, diverse organisms will help to define their 622 evolutionary trajectories and elucidate their core components. \n\nAll rights reserved.
