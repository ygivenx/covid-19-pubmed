{"title": "Global site-specific analysis of glycoprotein N-glycan processing", "body": "Over the past two decades, several strategies have emerged to characterize N-glycans of glycoproteins and identify the glycosites that are recognized and used by the cellular glycosylation machinery. Several methods employ endoglycosidases, such as PNGase F and PNGase A, to release the glycans from the protein, followed by analysis of glycoforms using MS30,31,32,33,34,35 or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)36,37 with or without prior derivatization38. The MS-based methods provide a composition for each molecular ion, which is annotated as a high-mannose or complex-type glycan consistent with biosynthetic principles. Furthermore, tandem mass spectra of derivatized N-glycans generated by both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) MS have been widely used for characterization of detailed structural information of N-glycans expressed in different biological systems30,34. Freely available software tools such as GRITS Toolbox (http://www.grits-toolbox.org/) are able to automatically process, annotate, and archive glycomics data in a high-throughput manner. The HPLC methods rely on retention times of N-glycan standards for identification of the glycan species. With both methods, supporting experiments using glycosidase digestions and/or permethylation analysis can provide additional support for structure assignments. Such methods find wide utility in characterizing glycosylation of highly studied glycoproteins such as immunoglobulins (e.g., IgG), or detecting individual differences in N-glycans of serum glycoproteins36,37,39. Although these methods provide key information about the nature of the glycoforms present on a glycoprotein and their relative abundance, they do not reveal which glycosites are utilized or the extent to which each glycosite is occupied.\n\nA number of proteomics-based methods focus on identification of the glycosites that are utilized by the OST and the degree to which the site is occupied by a glycan40,41,42,43,44. The basic strategy is to immobilize glycopeptides by using lectins or by coupling periodate-treated glycopeptides to hydrazide-activated beads. Then the peptides are released from the bound glycan with an endoglycosidase (e.g., PNGase F) that, in the process, converts the Asn-X-Thr/Ser sequence to Asp-X-Thr/Ser. When the reaction is performed in H2O18, it creates a mass difference from Asn to Asp of +3. Then MS/MS analysis of the eluted peptides provides positive identification of the sites that are glycosylated. These methods are particularly useful for surveying complex biological systems, such as whole cells or tissues, to identify proteins that are glycosylated.\n\nRecently, there have been major advances in glycoproteomics MS/MS methods that analyze intact glycopeptides and determine which glycoforms are present at each glycosite based on the combined masses of the glycopeptides and N-glycan8,28,29,45,46,47,48. Major limitations of this approach are the relatively low abundance of glycopeptides in the protein digest mixture, as well as the inherent low ionization efficiency of glycopeptides during MS analysis40,41,49,50. For these reasons, glycopeptides are typically enriched from peptide digests prior to MS analysis with different purification methods, such as hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)29,51,52 and hydrazide chemistry40. Despite the use of different fragmentation methods, including collision-induced dissociation (CID), high-energy collision dissociation (HCD), and electron-transfer dissociation (ETD), the inherent heterogeneity of glycoforms at each glycosylation site, as well as difficulties in obtaining good peptide backbone fragmentations for peptides with large glycans, impedes comprehensive identification of intact glycopeptides28,30. Annotation of LC-MS/MS data from such experiments is possible by using commercial algorithms such as Byonic (http://www.proteinmetrics.com/products/byonic/). However, quantitative assessment of the relative abundance of the glycan structures detected at each glycosite is still a substantial challenge due to unknown ionization efficiencies for peptides with each glycoform, especially for those with sialic acid-containing structures38. Moreover, if the glycopeptides are enriched prior to analysis, peptides with no glycan are lost, and the degree of glycosite occupancy cannot be assessed.\n\nThe protocol described here arose from the need of the HIV vaccine effort for robust semiquantitative glycoproteomics methods that would: (i) establish the occupancy of N-glycans at each glycosite and (ii) assess the degree to which glycans were processed from high-mannose type to complex type. The need stems from the fact that the primary candidate for a vaccine is the HIV envelope glycoprotein trimer (Env) that contains 75\u201390 N-glycans, creating a glycan shield to protect against attack by the immune system53,54. Despite the dense cover of N-glycans, bnAbs that bind to HIV Env do occur in 10\u201330% of HIV-1-infected patients55,56. Importantly, some bnAbs show interactions with high-mannose glycans57,58, whereas others show dependence on complex-type glycans12,15,59,60. Thus, to support the rational design of an HIV Env vaccine, we developed a method that could assess the proportion of high-mannose-type and complex-type N-glycans at each glycosite on the HIV Env10. However, as demonstrated here, the method is broadly applicable to any glycoprotein.\n\nOne of the key aspects of our method is the sequential use of two endoglycosidase treatments to introduce unique mass signatures for glycosites that carry no glycan, high-mannose/hybrid-type glycans, and complex-type glycans, as illustrated in Figure 2a. After protease digestion, endoglycosidase H (Endo H) is used to remove all high-mannose- and hybrid-type N-glycans that have at least 5 mannose residues (Fig. 1). This enzyme leaves a GlcNAc-Asn residue that adds +203 to the peptide mass. Subsequently, the remaining complex N-glycans are removed with PNGase F in the presence of H2O18, which both removes the glycan and converts Asn to Asp, with a +3 addition to the peptide mass. Peptides carrying glycosites (Asn-X-Thr/Ser) with Asn (unoccupied), GlcNAc-Asn (Endo H\u2013treated), or Asp (PNGase F\u2013treated), display similar ionization efficiencies during MS analysis10,45, allowing us to use ion intensity peak area to quantify the relative distribution of the three glycosylation states at each glycosite detected10,61. Another distinguishing feature of the method is the use of multiple proteases, which can generate up to thousands of spectra hits for each glycosite, resulting in >95% sequence coverage. This simple strategy effectively converts the glycoproteomics analysis to a proteomics analysis, allowing the use of robust proteomics software to analyze data in a high-throughput manner.\n\nA major advantage of this method is that it provides a glimpse into the site occupancy and processing of N-glycans at each glycosylation site10. It provides a semiquantitative analysis of the three glycosylation states, and a complete analysis can be conducted on only 30 \u03bcg of protein, even for complex glycoproteins such as HIV Env, comprising up to 30 glycosites per monomer. It should be noted that hybrid structures, which can potentially contain sialic acid (see Fig. 1), are included in the high-mannose-type category because they are cleaved by Endo H. However, hybrid structures typically have low abundance29,48.\n\nOne major limitation of the method is that glycan structures are removed before LC-MS/MS, and the class of the glycan is inferred by the specificities of the endoglycosidases. MS/MS methods based on analysis of intact glycopeptides provide more information on the spectra of glycans at individual glycosites27,28,29,62, and are complementary to this protocol, which provides semiquantitative information on site occupancy and glycan processing. However, neither method provides the precise structure complete with glycosidic linkages between monosaccharides. Although this protocol is designed for site-specific glycosylation analysis of purified glycoproteins, it is, in principle, applicable to more-complex protein samples, such as membrane-enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV, influenza virus, coronavirus) that comprise only 10\u201312 proteins. However, as described in the 'Experimental design' section, modification of the protocol would be needed to survey glycosites in more complex samples such as cells or human serum.\n\nThe procedure for site-specific analysis of glycoprotein N-glycan processing is summarized in Figure 2b and consists of the following key stages.In the first stage, buffer exchange for glycoproteins is needed if they are dissolved in the buffers that contain nonvolatile salts (Steps 1\u201312). Glycoproteins are then denatured and alkylated at pH 6 (Steps 13\u201317) to minimize non-enzymatic deamidation while retaining protein sequence coverage. Proteins are digested with several different protease treatments, including 'triple digestion', chymotrypsin, and a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin, in order to maximize sequence coverage and increase the confidence of detecting each glycosite (Step 18).In the second stage (Steps 19\u201325), proteases are denatured by heating to prevent incorporation of 18O-water into the C termini of peptides during the subsequent PNGase F treatment.In the third stage (Steps 26\u201336), sequential endoglycosidase treatment is employed to create unique mass signatures relative to the predicted amino acid sequence, for peptide glycosites that are not occupied (+0 Da) or that are occupied by high-mannose/hybrid- (+203 Da) or complex-type glycans (+3 Da) (Fig. 2a).The resulting samples are subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis (Step 37).Data processing for identification and quantitation of peptides for the three glycosylation states is done using the Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2) software package (stage 5, Steps 41\u201353). The MS1 and MS2 data are extracted from MS raw files with RawConverter and processed using multiple components from the IP2 software package (Steps 38\u201353).\n\nOver the past decade there has been substantial progress in site-specific glycosylation analysis of purified glycoproteins8,27,28,29,45,48,62,63,64. Exemplary, and perhaps the most relevant to this protocol, is the work on HIV-1 Env by the Desaire and Cripsin groups27,28,29,62. The methods developed by the two groups focus on characterizing intact glycopeptides with or without enrichment of glycopeptides prior to MS analysis, and thus can provide complementary information about individual glycoforms at each glycosite. However, milligram quantities of material may be required for their methods, which is attributed in part to the relatively low ionization efficiencies of glycopeptides and in part to the fact that each glycopeptide is actually a mixture of many different glycoforms28,29. Although the complexity is reduced by using only two proteases, chymotrypsin and trypsin, identification of all forms of a glycopeptide with multiple N-glycans is still a challenge, even when using a combination of CID and ETD for fragmentation27,28. Quantitative measurements are also challenging, due to unknown ionization of glycopeptides with different N-glycan species during MS analysis. Moreover, there is limited information about site occupancy, due to markedly different ionization efficiencies between peptides and the corresponding glycopeptides, and/or enrichment of glycopeptides prior to MS analysis.\n\nOther methods that use endoglycosidases to identify glycosites have long been in use40,41,44. However, typically, glycopeptides are selectively captured using treatment with periodate followed by binding to hydrazide-activated beads, or are enriched using lectins. The peptides are then released using PNGase F, in which glycosylated asparagine is converted to aspartic acid (+1 Da mass shift), allowing indirect identification of glycosites in the released peptides40,41. Alternatively, for a purified protein, PNGase F can be applied directly, and site occupancy of glycosylation sites can be determined by measuring the ratio of peptides with glycosites containing asparagine to aspartic acid during ESI-MS analysis28. By comparison with the protocol described here, addition of a second endoglycosidase, Endo H, provides additional information about the extent of glycan processing, in addition to the degree of site occupancy.\n\nProteolysis with a combination of proteases. Glycoproteins are denatured and alkylated at pH 6 instead of a mildly alkaline pH to minimize the non-enzymatic deamidation of Asn to Asp, which can complicate data analysis65. To maximize sequence coverage, a number of different protease digestions are used, including digestion by chymotrypsin, a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin, and combinations of Arg-C, trypsin, elastase and subtilisin ('triple digestion')66 (Step 18). Of note, a combination of all proteolytic digestions is essential for detecting all glycosites on heavily glycosylated proteins with large molecular weights, such as the HIV Env trimer and the spike glycoprotein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV S-2P protein). Triple digestion alone is able to identify all glycosites in glycoproteins containing only a few glycosites, whereas for most glycoproteins, a combination of triple digestion and chymotrypsin is enough to generate detectable peptides that contain all the glycosylation sites10. Another benefit of the use of multiple proteases, including trypsin and nonspecific proteases, is that it produces a sequence ladder that contains a series of peptides with variable numbers of amino acid residues on both sides of glycosite, allowing for highly confident identification for a given glycosite (Supplementary Table 1). For single glycoproteins or simple mixtures (e.g., viruses), the use of multiple proteases allows for much higher confident detection and semiquantitative analysis of the three states of glycosylation for each glycosite. However, for more-complex mixtures (e.g., cells, plasma) use of specific proteases such as trypsin will result in reduced complexity and the identification of glycosites while retaining the ability to detect the three different glycosylation states. Another key aspect of the protocol is that only volatile salts, such as ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium acetate, are used, so that no column purification is needed, resulting in high specificity of the protocol (requires \u223c30 \u03bcg of starting material).\n\nDenaturation of proteases. In the next stage, PNGase F treatment is employed for deglycosylation of glycoproteins, resulting in conversion of Asn to Asp upon removal of the carbohydrate, and a mass change of +3 when carried out in O18-water (Steps 19\u201325). Residual active trypsin and other proteases used for proteolysis can incorporate O18 into the C termini of the peptides during the deglycosylation step67, resulting in a high false-positive identification of peptides that may have glycosites. To avoid this, we denature all proteases used in the protocol by heating to 100 \u00b0C prior to the deglycosylation steps.\n\nSequential endoglycosidase treatment. Sequential treatment of glycopeptides with Endo H followed by PNGase F is employed to generate different mass signatures for glycosites that contain no glycan (+0), high-mannose/hybrid-type glycan (+203), and complex-type glycan (+3) (Steps 26\u201336, Fig. 2a). The endoglycosidase digestions are highly efficient and progress rapidly to completion, so the deglycosylation reactions are conducted for 1 h to minimize non-enzymatic deamidation that can occur during this step. Removal of N-glycans increases the ionization efficiencies of peptides and allows us to localize glycosylation sites on peptides with multiple modifications, which is challenging for analysis of intact glycopeptides (Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\nLC-MS/MS analysis. In principle, the deglycosylated peptides can then be analyzed by any type of LC-MS/MS (Step 37). A high-resolution mass spectrometer, such as the Orbitrap Elite, provides satisfactory sequence coverage for most glycoproteins. An instrument with a higher scan speed, such as an Orbitrap Fusion or Orbitrap Lumos, is more sensitive and generates several times more MS/MS spectra for a given sample than an Orbitrap Elite. Thus, they are able to provide site-specific glycan-processing information for those sites that may be missed in the results generated by the Orbitrap Elite as a result of heavy glycosylation and the large molecular weights of the glycoproteins. Although single-dimension separation is sufficient for characterization of site-specific glycosylation of purified proteins, multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT), in which peptides are systematically separated based on the charge in the first dimension and hydrophobicity in the second, will accelerate measurement of site-specific N-glycan processing of glycoproteins in these complex protein samples68.\n\nReplicates and controls. Ideally, each glycoprotein is digested in at least two technical replicates and analyzed by the same MS instrument. Invertase produced by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein from bovine serum are known to be occupied by high-mannose-type and complex-type glycans, respectively, and can be used as controls to test completion of endoglycosidase treatment. As a check on the overall success of the protocol, non-enzymatic deamidation of Asn residues and/or O18-incorpation at the C terminus should be seen in <5% of the total peptides.\n\n\nUrea (MilliporeSigma, cat. no.

Perform the alkylation step in the dark, as iodoacetamide is light-sensitive.16Buffer-exchange to 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8) by using a centrifugal filter with a membrane nominal molecular weight limit of 10 kDa.Critical StepTo complete buffer exchange, it is important to wash the filter at least three times with 100 \u03bcl of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 8,000 g for 50 min at 4 \u00b0C.17Dispense the sample into five equal aliquots for the following proteolytic digestion.Critical StepDo not dry glycoproteins after denaturation, as they may not be fully soluble in the buffer after lyophilization.Pause pointThe samples can be stored at \u221280 \u00b0C or in liquid nitrogen for at least 2 weeks.\n\nTiming \u223c24 h18Five aliquots (containing 6 \u03bcg of denatured glycoproteins each) are subjected to treatments with multiple proteases and combinations of proteases involving: Arg-C followed by trypsin (option A), elastase (option B), and subtilisin (option C). Aliquots A\u2013C will later be combined into a 'triple digestion' sample (Step 21). The remaining two aliquots are digested with chymotrypsin (option D) or a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin (option E).A\nArg-C followed by trypsin\niAdd Arg-C to one aliquot that contains \u223c6 \u03bcg of denatured glycoproteins at an enzyme/protein ratio of 1:20 (wt/wt). Bring the final volume to 100 \u03bcl with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8). Add DTT and EDTA to final concentrations of 5 mM and 0.2 mM, respectively.Critical StepArg-C is able to cleave at the C terminus of arginine residues, including sites next to proline, resulting in increased sequence coverage when combined with trypsin digestion.iiIncubate the solution at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h.iiiLyophilize the resulting peptide mixture for at least 3 h to remove water and volatile salt.ivRedissolve the peptide mixture in 500 \u03bcl of 100 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6).vAdd sequencing-grade modified trypsin to the solution at a trypsin/protein ratio of 1:10 (wt/wt).Critical StepSequencing-grade modified trypsin is able to digest glycoproteins at pH 6 while preserving adequate digestion efficiency.viIncubate the reaction at 37 \u00b0C for 16 h.\nB\nElastase\niAdd elastase to the second aliquot of the denatured glycoprotein at an elastase/protein ratio of 1:20 (wt/wt).Critical StepThe utility of triple digestion can generate higher sequence coverage than digestion with any of the single enzymes alone.iiBring the final volume to 500 \u03bcl with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8).iiiIncubate the reaction at 37 \u00b0C for 16 h.\nC\nSubtilisin\niAdd subtilisin to the third aliquot of the denatured glycoprotein at a subtilisin/protein ratio of 1:20 (wt/wt).iiBring the final volume to 500 \u03bcl with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8).iiiIncubate the reaction at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h.Critical StepDo not incubate the reaction longer than 4 h, in order to obtain appropriate lengths of peptides for MS detection.\nD\nChymotrypsin\niAdd chymotrypsin to the fourth aliquot of the denatured glycoprotein at a chymotrypsin/protein ratio of 1:13 (wt/wt).Critical StepDo not add too much chymotrypsin to the solution, as it can be self-digested, which will suppress the ESI signals of analytes.iiBring the final volume to 500 \u03bcl with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8).iiiIncubate the reaction in a 30 \u00b0C water bath for 10 h.\nE\nA combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin\niAdd trypsin and chymotrypsin to the fifth aliquot of the denatured glycoprotein at enzyme/protein ratios of 1:20 (wt/wt) and 1:13 (wt/wt) respectively.iiBring the final volume to 500 \u03bcl with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8).iiiIncubate the reaction at 37 \u00b0C for 16 h.Pause pointThe peptide mixtures derived from combination proteolytic digestion can be stored at \u221280 \u00b0C or in liquid nitrogen for at least 2 weeks.\n\n\nTiming \u223c10 h19Lyophilize the peptide mixtures derived from each of the five protease digestions (Step 18A\u2013E) for at least 5 h.20Redissolve each sample in 100 \u03bcl of water.21Combine the peptide mixtures derived from Step 18A\u2013C into a 'triple digestion' sample.22Separately, heat the combined triple digestion sample (Step 21) and the samples generated from digestion with chymotrypsin (Step 18D), and a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin (Step 18E) at 100 \u00b0C for 30 s.23Cool the samples at room temperature for 30 s.24Repeat Steps 22 and 23 at least five times.Critical StepTo completely deactivate the proteases used, Steps 22 and 23 should be repeated at least five times. Any remaining active proteases will accelerate incorporation of 18O-water into the C termini of peptides during the following PNGase F treatment conducted in 18O-water.25Lyophilize the samples for at least 3 h to remove any remaining volatile salts from the samples.Critical StepComplete removal of volatile salts from the samples is important for the following Endo H treatment, which has optimal activity at pH 5.5.Pause pointThe peptide mixtures can be stored at \u221280 \u00b0C or in liquid nitrogen for at least 2 weeks.\n\nTiming \u223c7 h26Separately, redissolve each of the three samples in 20 \u03bcl of 100 mM ammonium acetate (pH 5.5).27Add Endo H to the peptide mixtures at a minimum enzyme/glycoprotein ratio of 250 NEB units per 10 \u03bcg.Critical StepThe quantity of Endo H needed for deglycosylation may vary from protein to protein. A set of control experiments should be done before using this protocol (see Reagent Setup).28Incubate the reaction at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h.Pause pointThe Endo H\u2013treated peptides can be stored up to 1 week at \u221280 \u00b0C or in liquid nitrogen.29Lyophilize the Endo H\u2013treated samples for at least 3 h immediately before use. In the meantime, proceed to Step 30.Critical StepComplete removal of ammonium acetate in the samples ensures that the following PNGase F treatment will proceed to completion.30Lyophilize the PNGase F solution for at least 1 h immediately before use and redissolve the PNGase F enzyme in the same volume of18O-water (see Reagent Setup).31Add 20 \u03bcl of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8) prepared with 18O-water to the PNGase F solution.Critical StepSteps 31 and 32 should be done as quickly as possible to reduce contact of the reaction mixture with air.32Add PNGase F to the Endo H\u2013treated peptide mixtures at a minimum enzyme/glycoprotein ratio of 500 NEB units per 10 \u03bcg.Critical StepThe quantity of PNGase F that is needed for deglycosylation can be determined by treating a defined amount of the desired glycoprotein with a series of PNGase F concentrations. Gel shifts of N-glycans on SDS-PAGE can be used to determine completion of deglycosylation.33Seal the microcentrifuge tube that contains the mixture.34Incubate the reaction at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h.35Dispense the reaction mixture into aliquots that contain \u223c2 \u03bcg of peptides and store them in liquid nitrogen immediately.Pause pointThe samples can be stored in liquid nitrogen for at least 1 month.\n\nTiming 6\u201348 h per glycoprotein36Set up the LC-MS/MS system to characterize the deglycosylated peptides as described in the 'Equipment Setup' section.Critical StepEach glycoprotein is digested in two or three technical replicates and analyzed by the same MS instrument.\n\nTiming variable; hours to 1 d per glycoprotein37Extract the MS1 and MS2 spectra from the MS raw files using the spectrum-converting software RawConverter.38Add the MS raw files to the 'files to covert' window of RawConverter.39Set 'Experiment Type' as data dependent. Enable 'Select monoisotopic m/z in DDA'. 'Output formats' should be set to 'MS1, MS2, and MS3', in which both MS1 and MS2 data are extracted from the MS raw files.40Use a text editor such as Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to prepare a file containing the sequences of the target glycoproteins in FASTA format.41Add the resulting file to a predefined database, such as the European Bioinformatic Institute Bos Taurus protein database, with the 'database' of IP2.42Set the parameters as: Source: Uniprot; Organism Name: Bos Taurus; Generate reverse (decoy) sequences: yes; Add contaminant proteins: No.Critical StepReverse (decoy) sequences should be generated and included in the final database in order to estimate peptide probabilities and false-discovery rates.43Upload the resulting file that contains the sequences of the target glycoproteins to the 'database' window of IP2.44Upload the database to IP2.45Upload the MS1 and MS2 files to IP2.46Start a ProLuCID search in the IP2 (v5.0.1) software package.47Set the mass tolerance at 50 p.p.m. for precursor ions and 20 p.p.m. for fragment ions (MS2 spectra are detected in the Orbitrap instrument). No enzyme specificity is considered for searching. Set carboxyamidomethylation (+57.02146 C) as a fixed modification. Set oxidation (+15.9994 M), deamidation (+2.988261 N), GlcNAc (+203.079373 N), and pyroglutamate formation from N-terminal glutamine residue (\u221217.026549 Q) as variable modifications.48Filter the results generated by the ProLuCID search by using DTASelect (v2.0, another component of the IP2 software kit). The parameters are set as: minimum number of peptides per protein: \u22652, spectrum false-positive rate: \u22640.05, and precursor delta mass cutoff: \u226410 p.p.m.Critical StepSequence coverage of target proteins should be >95%.49Filter the results generated by DTASelect with the software 'Glyco_motif_filter' to remove those peptides with N+3 and/or N+203 modifications that are not located at the motif (N-X-S/T, X can be any amino acid residue except proline).Critical StepAll peptides with N+203 modifications that are not located at the consensus motif should be manually checked before they are removed. Asparagine residues that are not located at the motif should be considered as potential glycosylation sites when multiple spectra hits with N+203 modifications that do not contain the motif are consistently detected. Further verification is needed for these potential glycosylation sites.50Start a label-free analysis using Census (another component of the IP2 software package). The parameters are set as: 'find missing peptide': enabled, mass tolerance: \u226410 p.p.m., retention time tolerance: \u22640.1 min.Critical StepIon injection time is used to further normalize the resulting peak area.51Determine the abundance of each peptide from each raw file by the sum of the ion intensity peak area over all identified charge states.Critical StepTo improve the accuracy of the method, a set of peptides with N+0, N+3, and N+203 modifications is considered only when at least one of the three has a peak area of at least 5 \u00d7 108. Of note, \u223c2 \u03bcm of purified glycoproteins are loaded onto the column in the present study. This value was empirically determined as optimal to distinguish information from spectral noise and will vary from instrument to instrument. A control experiment should be done by using well-characterized model glycoproteins such as invertase (occupied by high-mannose glycans) and \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein (occupied by complex-type glycans) before setting the peak area threshold. Peak area values will be dependent on the type of LC system and mass spectrometer used, and the appropriate threshold will need to be determined for other instrument types.52Combine the data derived from two or three technical replicates after analysis of each MS run separately.\n\nTroubleshooting advice can be found in Table 1.\n\nSteps 1\u201312, buffer exchange for glycoproteins: \u223c11 h\n\nSteps 13\u201317, denaturation and alkylation of glycoprotein: \u223c7 h\n\nStep 18, protease treatments: \u223c24 h\n\nSteps 19\u201325, denaturation of proteases: \u223c10 h\n\nSteps 26\u201335, sequential endoglycosidase treatment: \u223c7 h\n\nStep 36, LC-MS/MS analysis: 6\u201348 h per glycoprotein\n\nSteps 37\u201352, data analysis: variable; hours to 1 d per glycoprotein, depending on complexity\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of this protocol is the use of sequential treatment of glycopeptides with endoglycosidases (Endo H followed by PNGase F) to create unique mass signatures for glycosites that have no N-glycan, high-mannose-type glycan, or complex-type glycan. This strategy converts the glycoproteomics analysis to a proteomics analysis, resulting in higher sensitivity of the protocol (only 30 \u03bcg of sample is needed for a complete analysis). The key to success is that the sequential endoglycosidase treatments proceed to completion, avoiding mis-assignment of N-glycan processing status. To this end, we applied the protocol to assess site-specific N-glycan processing of two well-characterized model glycoproteins, invertase produced by the yeast S. cerevisiae and \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein from bovine serum70. Glycosites on invertase are occupied by underprocessed oligomannose, and those on \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein are fully processed complex-type glycosylation (Fig. 3). All N-glycosites on both glycoproteins were identified with multiple MS/MS spectra ranging from 54 to >10,000 per site (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Low percentages of spectra hits that contain non-enzymatic deamidation or 18O-incorporation into the C termini of peptides were found among all spectra hits identified, which is attributed to the complete denaturation of proteases used (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). As described in the procedure section, as well as the previous study10, a set of peptides with N+0, N+3, and N+203 modifications was considered only when at least one of the three had a peak area of at least 5 \u00d7 108. As expected, the 14 N-glycosites of invertase were identified as entirely high-mannose-type glycosylation, and site occupancy was >90% for all glycosites except the sites N64 and N275 (Fig. 3a,b). By contrast, the five N-glycosites of \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein were completely complex-type glycosylation, and site occupancy was >98% for all five sites (Fig. 3c,d). These results indicated that sequential endoglycosidase treatment reached completion.\n\nAnother major assumption is that the endoglycosidase-treated peptide glycosites that are unoccupied or occupied by high-mannose glycans or complex-type glycans are detected equally during MS analysis. To test this assumption, the HIV-1 Env trimer BG505 SOSIP.664, expressed in the presence of kifunensine (high-mannose only), was selected as a model protein (hereafter referred to as Kif_BG505). N-glycans on Kif_BG505 were first removed by sequential endoglycosidase treatment, and as expected, glycosites comprised >95% high-mannose-type glycosylation (green bars), indicating that the kifunensine treatment was effective and Kif_BG505 had high-mannose glycans (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, PNGase F treatment only was also applied to release N-glycans on Kif_BG505, resulting in peptides with homogeneous N+3 modification (>98% of purple bars, Fig. 4b). The resulting two samples were then mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1 in order to assess MS detection of glycotypes (Fig. 4c). Peptides with N+3 and N+203 modifications are both detectable for each glycosite, with a ratio of 1.0 to 1.2, suggesting slightly increased sensitivity for peptides with the N+3 modification. Synthetic peptides that carry asparagine (unoccupied), aspartic acid (PNGase F\u2013treated), and N-acetylglucosamine-linked asparagine residues at the glycosylation site, display similar ionization efficiencies during ESI-MS analysis, further indicating that the protocol is able to semiquantitatively assess site-specific N-glycan processing for glycoproteins61.\n\nAlthough the protocol was initially developed for analysis of site-specific N-glycan processing of the HIV Env trimer10, it is applicable to analysis of site-specific N-glycan processing of recombinant glycoprotein therapeutics (Fig. 5a,b), serum glycoproteins (Fig. 5c,d), and soluble or membrane-bound envelope glycoproteins from viruses (Fig. 6). It is also likely to be useful in characterization of glycoprotein processing in more complex systems such as whole cells due to its high sensitivity.\n\nSite-specific N-glycan processing of recombinantly produced therapeutic glycoproteins, including IgG and IgM, was determined (Fig. 5a,b). Human serum IgG, which contains IgG1-4 with IgG1 and IgG2 as the major isotypes, was found to be entirely complex-type glycosylation, consistent with previous studies (Fig. 5a)32,49,52. Of the five N-glycosites on IgM, which is the major antibody produced in the primary immune response, three sites were shown to be completely occupied by complex-type structures (N171, N332, and N395), whereas the other two sites, N402 and N563, were primarily high-mannose-type glycosylation (Fig. 5b). The glycosite N563 that is proximal to the CH4 domain and thus is a poor substrate for OST was found to be partially glycosylated, in agreement with previous studies24,71.\n\nAbnormal glycosylation of serum glycoproteins is a common feature in various human diseases, such as cancers and congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). In particular, serum transferrin was first used to diagnose abnormal glycosylation in CDG patients in the 1990s72. Normal transferrin has two N-glycosylation sites, each of which is fully occupied73,74, whereas in type I CDGs, an increase of mono-glycosylated transferrin was found due to defects of oligosaccharide assembly and transfer to glycoproteins in those patients75. Analysis of site-specific N-glycan processing of commercially available human serum transferrin revealed that the two glycosites of this protein were entirely complex-type glycosylation (Fig. 5c), in line with the previous studies73,74. Another serum glycoprotein, fetuin, was also found to be entirely complex-type glycosylation, with full occupancy of two sites (N99 and N156) and partial glycosylation of the third glycosite (N176, 89% of site occupancy, Fig. 5d).\n\nMembrane-bound envelope glycoproteins of various viruses, such as MERS-CoV S-2P protein and HIV Env trimer, are the target of neutralizing antibodies, and thus are the focus of vaccine development55,69. N-linked glycans on those envelope glycoproteins serve as a shield to protect the underlying protein from immune surveillance and thus confound development of effective vaccines for those viruses54. Importantly, some neutralizing antibodies to those viruses have glycan-dependent epitopes15,57,69, suggesting that vaccine design efforts would benefit greatly from understanding the N-glycan processing status at each glycosylation site. MERS-CoV S-2P protein is a large trimer (\u223c600 kDa) with \u223c25 N-linked glycans per monomer, each of which comprises two noncovalently associated subunits, S1 and S269. Characterization of site-specific N-glycan processing of a prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV S-2P protein ectodomain (MERS S-2P) revealed that all 23 glycosites on the protein were fully occupied, except for the N104 site (Fig. 6a). High-mannose glycans were predominantly found in the S1-NTD (residues 18\u2013353), whereas other regions of the S protein, including the RBD (367\u2013588), the two subdomains (589\u2013751), and S2 (752\u20131,291), contained glycosites occupied largely by complex-type glycans (Fig. 6a). The glycan N1176, which is in the epitope for antibody G4 and was reported to mask antibody recognition69, was found to have a complex-type structure. Of note, we did not observe that the proteases used had biases on specific glycotypes (Supplementary Fig. 2). Of the 12 glycosites on the recombinant influenza haemagglutinin (HA) of A/Victoria/361/2011, three were >85% high-mannose (N45, N165, and N285), four were fully complex-type glycosylation (N22, N38, N63, and N483), and the rest were occupied by a mixture of high-mannose and complex-type glycans (Fig. 6b). It is striking to observe that the site N122 was not occupied and another site N144 was only 32% occupied on this HA glycoprotein. We also applied the protocol to the benchmark HIV Env trimer BG505 SOSIP.664, resulting in identification of all 28 glycosites with up to 2,000 spectra hits per glycosite (Fig. 6c). All 28 glycosites were >90% occupied, except the sites N185e, N197, N618, and N625. Of those that were largely occupied, 14 were >75% high-mannose, four were >75% complex-type glycosylation, and six other sites had a mixture of high-mannose and complex-type glycans. In particular, the glycosites, N295, N332, N339, N386, and N392, in the high-mannose patch region, were found to be occupied predominantly by underprocessed oligomannose, consistent with previous studies14,76. The N160 glycan, which is critical for binding of the bnAbs PG9 and PG16 to HIV Env, was composed predominantly of high-mannose structures, confirming the glycan composition at this site described in previous structural studies58,77,78. Interestingly, the high-mannose and complex-type glycans identified at each glycosylation site of BG505 SOSIP.664 matched the pathway of N-glycan processing, in which high-mannose structures are first trimmed from Man9 to Man5 before addition of the terminal monosaccharides that define complex-type/hybrid glycans, as compared to the results of the same protein obtained on intact glycopeptide level29. Thus, the sites were predominantly occupied by Man9 if they were 100% high-mannose glycosylation, whereas other sites were occupied by mixtures of processed high-mannose structures (Man8 to Man5) and simple complex-type structures if they were occupied by a mixture of high-mannose and complex-type glycans10.\n\nWe believe this protocol will be of wide interest to the proteomics and glycomics fields, and will be used by many outside those fields who want to gain high-level information about the glycoproteins they investigate.\n\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\nFurther information on experimental design is available in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.\n\nPublisher's note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations."}
