{"title": "Evaluation of metal-conjugated compounds as inhibitors of 3CL protease of SARS-CoV", "body": "Beginning in Guangdon province of China in late 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel human coronavirus (CoV) subsequently spread to over 25 countries [1] [2] [3] [4] . Subsequent analysis of the virus has revealed features that may be used in preventative or therapeutic strategies. Analogous to the 3C proteases encoded by picornaviruses, a virally encoded 3C-like (3CL) protease that functions in the maturation of viral polyproteins is essential for the completion of the SARS-CoV life cycle [5] . It is a chymotrypsin-like protease that uses a Cys rather than a Ser residue as the nucleophile in the active site. The 3CL protease contains an additional helical C-terminal domain of about 100 residues, absent from the analogous picornavirus 3C and chymotrypsin, which is essential for enzymatic activity. Its removal obviates proteolytic activity, since this critical domain is responsible for the dimerization of the protease, which is a prerequisite for proteolytic activity [6] . Moreover, the active site of the SARS-CoV 3CL protease comprises a catalytic dyad rather than a triad.\n\nThe SARS-CoV 3CL protease represents an obvious and key target for anti-SARS strategies. Crystallization of the protease [7, 8] has led to the identification of several candidate inhibitors in computer modeling studies [9, 10] and biological assays [11] . However, to date, a detailed exploration of inhibitor activity has been lacking. Previously, we developed a fluorescence-based assay suitable to screen inhibitors of the protease in a high throughput format [12, 13] . We used this system presently to screen a compound library consisting of 960 mostly commercially available drugs and biologically active substances. In light of previous reports, we were interested in examining the influence of metal-conjugated compounds on protease activity [14] [15] [16] . As reported in this paper, several compounds inhibit SARS-CoV 3CL protease including Znconjugated compounds.\n\nA fluorogenic peptide substrate (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans) and SARS-CoV 3CL protease were prepared as previously reported [12] . The protease was stored in the buffer containing 12 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 7.5 mM b-ME, and 1 mM DTT at )70\u00b0C before use. The compound library was obtained from The Genesis Plus Collection (MicroSource Discovery Systems, Inc., Gaylordsville, CT). Many of the 960 compounds collected in this library are compounds approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThe ability of the tested compounds to inhibit SARS-CoV replication was assayed using Vero E6 cells. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV in the presence or absence of the particular test compound and incubated for two days at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . After two days, cells were harvested and lysed. Equal amounts (10 ll) of cell lysate were boiled in a sample loading buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mM DTT, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.005% bromophenol blue) for 5 min and then loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-C extra membrane using a semidry apparatus (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The membranes were blocked with Blotto/ Tween blocking buffer (5 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 77 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 2.5% skimmed milk, and 0.001% antiform A) and then incubated with BALB/c anti-rS268, which is an anti-spike polyclonal antibody [17] . The membrane was then washed with blocking buffer and further incubated with goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The membrane was finally washed with blocking buffer and developed with ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent (Amersham Biosciences).\n\nCell viability was determined by the tetrazolium salts (MTS) assay that was conducted essentially as described [18] . This convenient method is based on the conversion of MTS to a chromatic, soluble formazan in living cells, via the mitochondrial enzyme NAD-dependent dehydrogenase. MTS and phenazine methosulfate were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) or Promega (Madison, WI) as powders and were prepared in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Measurements at each drug concentration were performed with three repeats.\n\nThe enhanced fluorescence due to proteolytically catalyzed cleavage of Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans was monitored at 538 nm with excitation at 355 nm using a fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent; ThermoLabsystems, Helsinki, FINLAND). Substrate concentration was determined from the extinction coefficient of 5438 M \u00c01 cm \u00c01 at 336 nm (Edans) or 15 100 M \u00c01 cm \u00c01 at 472 nm (Dabcyl). The fluorimetric assay was utilized to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL protease and determine their inhibition constants. K i measurements were performed at two fixed inhibitor concentrations of 2 and 5 lM or 3 and 5 lM. Substrate concentrations ranged from 8 to 80 lM in a reaction mixture containing 50 nM SARS-CoV protease. Lineweaver-Burk plots of kinetic data were fitted with the computer program KinetAsyst II (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA) by nonlinear regression to obtain the K i value for competitive and noncompetitive inhibitor using Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively.\n\nIn these equations, K m is Michaelis constant of the substrate, K i is inhibition constant, V m is maximal velocity, and [I] and [S] represent the inhibitor and substrate concentrations in the reaction mixture, respectively.\n\nThe compound library containing 960 compounds was screened for inhibition of the SARS-CoV 3CL protease. Inhibition resulted from the application of the three hits, phenylmercuric acetate, thimerosal, and hexachlorophene. The influence of these compounds on viral protein production, as an indicator of replication, was then examined. As shown, Western blots revealed that 10 lM phenylmercuric acetate suppressed detection of the viral spike protein (Fig. 1) . The actin level in Vero E6 cells treated with phenylmercuric acetate and then infected by SARS-CoV was lower, indicating that at a concentration of 10 lM the compound might be toxic to the cells. The presence of 1 lM thimerosal diminished the detectable quantity of the spike protein by over 90 percent (Fig. 1) . Similar observations were obtained using 10 lM hexachlorophene (Fig. 1) . The latter two compounds displayed no apparent toxic effect, as evidenced by the unchanged actin levels. This hexachlorophene concentration also showed strong inhibition of cytopathic effect on virus-infected Vero E6 cells (results not shown). No cytotoxicity was exhibited when Vero E6 cells were treated with 10 lM hexachlorophene (Fig. 2) .\n\nDetermination of the K i values of phenylmercuric acetate, thimerosal, and hexachlorophene against 3CL protease indicated that these compounds were competitive inhibitors with K i values of 0.7 lM (phenylmercuric acetate), 2.4 lM (thimerosal), and 13.7 lM (hexachlorophene). Since mercurycontaining compounds such as phenylmercuric acetate and thimerosal may pose therapeutic hazards to a patient, we further evaluated a series of metal-containing compounds ( Table 1 ) and metal ions ( Table 2 ). Paramount among these was a Zn-conjugated compound.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3 , 1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc was a competitive inhibitor with a K i value of 0.17 lM. In contrast, Zn 2\u00fe acted non-competitively against SARS-CoV protease, with a 6-fold larger K i value of 1.1 lM (Fig. 4) . The indicated involvement of the organic moiety of the compound in inhibitory activity was supported by observations that N-ethyl-N-phenyldithiocarbamic acid zinc and toluene-3,4-dithiolato zinc showed similar K i values (1.0 and 1.4 lM, respectively) to that of the Zn 2\u00fe (1.1 lM), whereas 1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc had a markedly smaller K i of 0.17 lM.\n\nNiclosamide, which is used in the treatment of parasitic disorders, shows promise as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV replication [19] . It was then suggested to be a SARS-CoV protease inhibitor on the basis of computer modeling [9] . However, presently, fluorimetric assay results were not indicative of any inhibitory effect of niclosamide against the protease (data not shown). \n\nIn the present study, 960 commerically available drugs and biologically active substances, as well as metal-conjugated compounds, were tested for their ability to functionally disrupt SARS-CoV protease activity. The 3CL protease we prepared is dimeric in its functional form and is more active than the previously prepared 3CL protease [5, 11] , by virtue of the absence of extra amino acids at the N-and C-termini. Not only did the present study involve a more potent enzyme, but the enzyme activity was assessed in real-time using a fluorogenic substrate [12] . These examinations have identified protease inhibition by some of the compounds tested. These effective compounds also suppress viral replication, correlative with their anti-SARS-CoV protease activity.\n\nTwo of these compounds, phenylmercuric acetate and thimerosal, are used as pharmaceutical excipients, and are widely used as antimicrobial preservatives in parenteral and topical pharmaceutical formulations [20] . In particular, phenylmercuric acetate is used as an antimocrobial preservative in cos-metics, as a bactericide in parenterals and eye-drops, and as a spermicide. Another effective compound, hexachlorophene, is an antibacterial compound that is a common constituent of soaps and scrubs and is experimentally used as a cholinesterase inhibitor.\n\nIn addition to the anti-viral activity of these commercially available compounds, several metallic species displayed potential against the SARS-CoV protease. Several metal ions inhibit Cys protease via the interaction with a nucleophilic sulfur anion [14] . SARS-CoV 3CL protease is also a Cys protease. Presently, seven transition metal ions were tested. While Hg 2\u00fe , Zn 2\u00fe and Cu 2\u00fe were effective, Co 2\u00fe , Mg 2\u00fe , Mn 2\u00fe , and Ni 2\u00fe did not inhibit 3CL protease activity. These metal ions are non-competitive inhibitors by virtue of their size. They are too small to block substrate binding, despite being capable of interaction with the active site Cys residue. Phenylmercuric acetate and phenylmercuric nitrate are similar to Hg 2\u00fe in their inhibitory power. However, the observed markedly higher affinity of 1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc for the protease, compared to Zn 2\u00fe , is consistent with the suggestion that the former is a more specific 3CL inhibitor. It is noteworthy that Zn-containing compounds such as zinc acetate are added as a supplement to the drug for the treatment of Wilson's disease [21] , indicating the safety of the ion for human use. More relevantly, zinc salts such as zincum gluconicum (Zenullose) may be effective in treating the common cold, a disease caused by rhinoviruses, without knowledge of the molecular target [22] . Thus, the present documentation of the anti-SARS, sub-micromolar K i action of Zn-conjugated compounds provides a firm foundation on which to embark upon SARS therapeutic drug explorations. Fig. 4 . The K i measurements for zinc ion. The reaction velocities of SARS 3CL protease in the absence (s) or presence of 3 (m) and 5 lM (j) Zn 2\u00fe and various substrate concentrations ranged from 8 to 80 lM were used to determine the K i value (1.1 lM) of Zn 2\u00fe by fitting the data with Eq. (2) using KinetAsyst II program. The inhibition pattern indicates that zinc ion is non-competitive with respect to the substrate. Fig. 3 . The K i measurements of a selected SARS protease inhibitor 1hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc. The enzyme activities were measured using 8-80 lM fluorogenic substrate in the absence (s) or presence of 2 (m) and 5 lM (j) inhibitor. The data were fitted with Eq. (1) using KinetAsyst II program to obtain the K i value (0.17 lM). The inhibition pattern indicates that 1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc is competitive with respect to the substrate."}
