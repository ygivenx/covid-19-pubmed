{"title": "CCL2 affects \u03b2-amyloidosis and progressive neurocognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease NIH Public Access", "body": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is both progressive and debilitating with limited treatment options. Its cause, while incompletely understood, is linked to misfolded protein accumulation and subsequent neurodegeneration (Muchowski, 2002; Selkoe, 2004) . In recent years the interplay between immunity and neurodegeneration has gained increased attention in unraveling disease mechanisms and for therapeutic development. Center stage in neuroinflammation is the microglia, a principal immune competent cell of the nervous system responsible for a range of functions affecting brain homeostasis and disease (Ransohoff and Perry, 2009 ). Microglial neurotoxicity is linked to a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders that include, but not limited to, AD, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries, viral encephalitis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the precise role played by microglia in the pathobiology of AD has only recently been addressed (Liu and Hong, 2003) . In both animal models and human disease, activated microglia and astrocytes accumulate in AD-associated senile plaques composed of densely packed fibrils of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides processed from the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Frautschy et al., 1998; Rogers et al., 1996; Selkoe, 2002) . A high level of microglial plasticity enables it to rapidly change phenotype and function . On the one hand, microglia serve to scavenge and eliminate misfolded proteins thereby protecting neurons while also eliciting inflammatory responses. This occurs by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other neurotoxic factors. The microglial phenotype that emerges depends on immune responses to misfolded protein aggregates and the brain microenvironment(El Khoury et al., 1998; Lucas et al., 2006; Paresce et al., 1996; Skaper, 2007) . All can affect cell migration and differentiation.\n\nThe CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), also known as monocyte chemotactic protein-1, is a \u03b2chemokine responsible for monocyte-macrophage tissue recruitment during infectious and inflammatory events affecting disease processes (Shi and Pamer, 2011) . Notably, CCL2 is produced by A\u03b2-stimulated microglia and astrocytes and a critical part of the neuroinflammatory response (El Khoury et al., 2003; Smits et al., 2002) . Its ligand binding receptor is the CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) (Hickman and El Khoury, 2010; Serbina et al., 2008) , which is constitutively expressed on the cell surface (Boddeke et al., 1999; Mack et al., 2001) and regulates cell infiltration into tissues including the brain (Babcock et al., 2003; D'Mello et al., 2009; Izikson et al., 2000) . While CCL2-overexpressing AD mice (APP/CCL2 double-transgenic (Tg) mice) show accelerated \u03b2-amyloidosis, microgliosis and cognitive impairments (Kiyota et al., 2009a; Yamamoto et al., 2005) , CCR2 deficiency also effects disease tempo and progression (El Khoury et al., 2007; Naert and Rivest) . Both increased CCL2 signaling and CCR2 deficiency in AD mouse models worsen pathology. While unexpected, an understanding of how this occurs remains pivotal. We reasoned that as CCR2, the receptor for CCL2, CCL2-CCR2 signaling might be a key defining set of microglial activities. To this end, we investigated AD-associated processes linked to CCL2 deficiency. Our data now demonstrate that CCL2-CCR2 signaling affects a range of microglia and neuroprogenitor cell functions that not only influence disease pathobiology, but also may be harnessed towards novel therapeutic developments.\n\nAPP mice (Tg2576 strain) expressing the Swedish mutation of human APP 695 were obtained from Drs. G. Carlson and K. Hsiao-Ashe through Mayo Medical Venture (Hsiao et al., 1996) . Presenilin (PS1) mice overexpressing mutant PS1 (M146L line 6.2) were provided by Dr. K. Duff through University of South Florida (Duff et al., 1996) . Both mice were maintained in a B6/129 hybrid background (Kiyota et al., 2009b) . CCL2KO mice [B6.129S4-Ccl2tm1Rol/J] were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA. Male APP or PS1 mice were crossed with female CCL2KO mice to generate APP/ CCL2 +/\u2212 or PS1/CCL2 +/\u2212 , followed by back-cross with CCL2KO mice to generate APP/ CCL2 \u2212/\u2212 (KO) or PS1/CCL2KO mice. APP/CCL2KO were crossed with PS1/CCL2KO mice to generate APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice. Non-Tg and APP/PS1 mice were developed in parallel (Kiyota et al., 2009b) . All animal studies adhered to the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nBrdU was intraperitoneally injected (50 mg/kg of body weight) twice daily every 12 h for 2.5 days to label proliferating cells . Three weeks after the first BrdU injection, mice were euthanized with isoflurane, blood samples were collected, mice were perfused transcardially with 25 ml of ice-cold PBS, and the brains were rapidly removed. The left hemisphere was immediately frozen in dry ice for biochemical testing. The right hemisphere was immersed in freshly depolymerized 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hours at 4\u00b0C , and protected by successive 24-hour immersions in 15 and 30% sucrose in 1x PBS. Fixed, cryopreserved brains were sectioned coronally using a Cryostat (Leica, Bannockburn, IL, USA) with serial sections collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for immunohistochemical tests.\n\nImmunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (Kiyota et al., 2011) using specific antibodies (Abs) to identify pan-A\u03b2 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:100, Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA), Iba1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000, Wako, Richmond, VA, USA), and doublecortin (Dcx, goat polyclonal, 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Immunodetection was visualized using biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG was used as a secondary Ab, followed by a tertiary incubation with Vectastain ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). 1% thioflavin S in 50% EtOH was used for counterstaining of compact plaque (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). For immunofluorescence, sections were co-incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU (mouse monoclonal, 6 \u03bcg/ml, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA), biotin-conjugated anti-NeuN (mouse monoclonal, 1:500, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), followed by incubation with Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor \u00ae 568 (1:1000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For quantification analysis, the areas of A\u03b2 loads and thioflavin S-positive (TS + ) plaques were analyzed by Nuance EX multispectral imaging system (Cambridge Research & Instruments, Woburn, MA, USA) at 300 \u03bcm intervals in ten 30 \u03bcm coronal sections from each mouse. Five brains of mice per group were analyzed. The numbers of Iba1-positive microglia were quantified using an image analysis software (ImageJ, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The numbers of Dcx + and BrdU + /NeuN + cells per dentate gyrus were calculated by stereology based on the Cavalieri principle (West, 1999) . Ten 30 \u03bcm coronal sections at 300 \u03bcm intervals from each mouse were used for the calculation. Five brains of mice per group were analyzed (Kiyota et al., 2011) .\n\nProtein extraction of extracellular, intracellular and membrane-enriched fractions and immunoblot tests were performed as described (Lesne et al., 2006) . For A\u03b2 immunoblotting, 250 \u03bcg of protein/brain sample were incubated with unconjugated pan-A\u03b2 monoclonal Ab (6E10, 2 \u03bcg/ml, Covance, Emeryville, CA, USA) in TNE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA)) at 4 \u00baC for 1h, followed by incubation with 40 \u03bcl of Protein A/G Plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at 4 \u00baC for overnight. Precipitants were collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm, 4 \u00baC for 5 min, reconstituted with sample buffer, incubated at 95 \u00baC for 5 min, and then analyzed by electrophoresis on 16% SDSpolyacrylamide Tris-Tricine gels (Schagger, 2006) and electroblotted to 0.2-\u03bcm pore size polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA, USA, USA). Membranes were blocked in 3% BSA/TBST (Tris-Buffered Saline-Tween 20), and incubated with biotinylated 6E10 monoclonal Ab (1:1000, Covance, Emeryville, CA, USA), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). For the other immunoblotting, membrane-enriched protein samples were run on Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted to 0.45-\u03bcm pore size PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), followed by incubation with CD36, CD47 rabbit polyclonal (1:300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or \u03b2-actin monoclonal Ab (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) was used as a secondary Ab. Immunoreactive bands were detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and quantitatively analyzed by normalizing band intensities relative to controls on scanned films by ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Protein extraction and A\u03b242 ELISA was performed as described (Kiyota et al., 2011) .\n\nMouse primary microglia was cultured as described previously (Kiyota et al., 2009a) . Five x 10 4 microglial cells per well (in 96-well plate for immunofluorescence and microplate reading) were seeded for 1 day in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/ streptomycin (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF, a generous gift from Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA). A\u03b21-42 (A\u03b242) peptide was commercially purchased (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The A\u03b242 was dissolved in cold hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP), and incubated at room temperature for at least 1 hour to establish monomerization. The HFIP was removed by evaporation, and the A\u03b242 peptide was stored as a film at \u221220 \u00b0C. For oligomer, A\u03b242 was dissolved in anhydrous DMSO at 5 mM, diluted into 100 \u03bcM in PBS, and then incubated for 24 h at 4\u00b0C\n\n. For monomer, A\u03b242 was dissolved in anhydrous DMSO diluted in DMEM, and then immediately used for treatment. Microglia were incubated with 10 \u03bcM A\u03b2 for 1 h, washed with PBS three times, and then fixed with freshly depolymerized 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min for immunofluorescence. Standard immunofluorescence was performed using pan-A\u03b2 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:100) and Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000), followed by counterstaining with Hoechst 33342 (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Fluorescent intensities were measured by SpectraMAX M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at excitation and emission wavelengths (Ex/Em) of 488/519 nm for Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488 and 350/461 nm for Hoechst 33342.\n\nThe radial arm water maze (RAWM) task was run as described with minor modifications (Arendash et al., 2001; Kiyota et al., 2009a) . Animals were introduced into the perimeter of a circular water-filled tank 110 cm in diameter and 91 cm in height (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) with triangular inserts placed in the tank to produce six swim paths radiating from a central area. Spatial cues for mouse orientation were present on the tank walls. At the end of one arm, a 10 cm circular plexiglass platform was submerged 1 cm deep and as such hidden from the mice. The platform was located in the same arm for four consecutive acquisition trials (T1 through T4), and one 30-min delayed retention trial (T5), but in a different arm on different days. For T1-T4, the mouse started the task from a different randomly chosen arm, excluding the arm with the platform. After four trials, the mouse was returned to its cage for 30 min, and then administered the retention trial (T5) starting from the same arm as in T4. Each trial lasted 1 minute and an error was scored each time when the mouse, excluding tail, entered the wrong arm, entered the arm with the platform but did not climb on it, or did not make a choice for 20 sec. The trial ended when the mouse climbed onto and remained on the hidden platform for 10 seconds. The mouse was given 20 seconds to rest on the platform between trials. The time taken by the mouse to reach the platform was recorded as its latency. If the mouse did not reach the platform, 60 sec was recorded as its latency and the mouse was gently guided to the submerged platform. The errors over 9-day test were divided into three blocks, and the errors in each block consisting of 3-day test were averaged for statistical analysis.\n\nAll data were normally distributed and presented as mean values \u00b1 standard errors of the mean (S.E.M.). In the case of single mean comparison, data were analyzed by Student's ttest. In case of multiple mean comparisons, the data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Newman-Keuls post-hoc or two-way repeated measures ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison tests using statistics software (Prism 4.0, Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA). A value of p < 0.05 was regarded as a significant difference.\n\nA\u03b2 deposits develop between 9 to 12 months of age in single Tg2576 strain expressing familial AD mutants of APP (Hsiao et al., 1996) . APP/PS1 double-Tg mice, which also overexpress mutant PS1, show accelerated A\u03b2 deposition as early as 5 to 6 months with robust microglial responses (Arendash et al., 2001; Holcomb et al., 1998; Morgan et al., 2000) . Notably, \u03b2-amyloidosis occurs through oligomer formation that evolves into diffuse and eventually TS + -compact plaques. To examine how CCL2 deficiency affects \u03b2amyloidosis, APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice were used to assess A\u03b2 loads in the cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 1A-D) . Total A\u03b2 load, composed of diffuse and compact plaques, was determined by anti-A\u03b2 staining. A\u03b2 load was increased in brains of APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice (154 % of APP/PS1 group in the cortex, p = 0.0304, 175 % of APP/PS1 group in the hippocampus, p = 0.0386, Fig. 1A-B, E) . TS + compact plaques were also increased, but only the increases in TS + compact plaques were significant in the cortex for the APP/PS1/ CCL2KO as compared to APP/PS1 mice (234 % of APP/PS1 group in the cortex, p = 0.0478, 188 % of APP/PS1 group in the hippocampus, p = 0.1880, Fig. 1C -D, F). To quantify A\u03b242 levels, brain tissue homogenates were separated into SDS-soluble fractions containing stable oligomers and SDS-insoluble fractions. The latter included fibrillar A\u03b2. Although insoluble A\u03b242 increased (APP/PS1: 8.121 \u00b1 0.319 \u03bcg/\u03bcg protein versus APP/PS1/CCL2KO: 8.908 \u00b1 0.726 \u03bcg/\u03bcg protein; p = 0.3701, Fig. 1H ), only soluble A\u03b242 increases were significant for the APP/PS1/CCL2KO as compared to APP/PS1 mice (APP/ PS1: 10.13 \u00b1 1.592 ng/\u03bcg protein versus APP/PS1/CCL2KO: 17.44 \u00b1 2.703 ng/\u03bcg protein; p = 0.0420, Fig. 1G ). Plasma A\u03b242 levels were decreased in APP/PS1/CCL2KO animals compared to APP/PS1 mice (APP/PS1: 1.302 \u00b1 0.083 ng/ml plasma vs APP/PS1/CCL2KO: 0.928 \u00b1 0.124 ng/ml plasma; p = 0.0270, Fig. 1I ).\n\nWe next quantitated A\u03b2 oligomers by immunoblotting extracellular-enriched mouse brain homogenates (Fig. 2) (Lesne et al., 2006) . Although monomers (1-mer) were unchanged between APP/PS1 and APP/PS1/CCL2KO (p = 0.1665, Fig. 2B ), trimer (3-mer), dodecamer (12-mer) and 75kDa A\u03b2 (A\u03b275) were increased in APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice (148, 191 , and 156% of APP/PS1 mice; p = 0.0010, 0.0309 and 0.0082, respectively, Fig. 2B ). A\u03b2 oligomeric dimers, tetramers, and hexamers were not observed. These results suggest that forms of soluble A\u03b2 oligomeric species are modulated through CCL2 and as such could contribute to the total brain A\u03b2 load.\n\nA\u03b2 peptides and deposition induce reactive microgliosis and subsequent neuroinflammation linked to neuronal injury (Tan et al., 2002) . In contrast, microglia also affect A\u03b2 clearance (Bard et al., 2000) . To determine if CCL2 deficiency affects microglial accumulation in the APP/PS1/CCL2KO brain, Iba1-immunoreactive cells were quantified (Fig. 3A-C) . Numbers of Iba1 + microglia, in both the cortex and hippocampus, were reduced in APP/PS1/ CCL2KO mice (APP/PS1: 306.6 \u00b1 13.12/mm 2 versus APP/PS1/CCL2KO: 180.4 \u00b1 18.62/mm 2 in the cortex; p = 0.0005, APP/PS1: 248.3 \u00b1 14.59/mm 2 versus APP/PS1/ CCL2KO: 174.1 \u00b1 5.02/mm 2 in the hippocampus; p = 0.0013, Fig. 3D ). However, the number of Iba1-immunoreactive microglia surrounding TS + A\u03b2 compact plaques in APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice was increased as compared to APP/PS1 mice (APP/PS1: 2.000 \u00b1 0.377/plaque versus APP/PS1/CCL2KO: 3.350 \u00b1 1.412/plaque; p = 0.0094, Fig. 3E ).\n\nWhy A\u03b2 oligomers and deposits increase in the brain may be linked to deficits in microglial function. As the cells serve as scavengers (El Khoury et al., 1998; Lucas et al., 2006; Paresce et al., 1996) , we investigated whether CCL2 deficiency could affect phagocytic functions. CD36 and CD47 expression was explored by immunoblotting with membraneenriched brain fractions (El Khoury et al., 2003; Koenigsknecht and Landreth, 2004) (Fig.  4A ). While CD36 expression was unchanged in APP/PS1 and APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice (p = 0.0659, Fig. 4B ), CD47 expression was reduced in APP/PS1/CCL2KO animals (70.1 % of the APP/PS1 group; p = 0.0113, Fig. 4B ). A\u03b2 microglial phagocytosis from non-Tg and CCL2KO mice were tested (Fig. 5A-O) . Immunofluorescent levels were measured after treatment of microglia with monomeric or oligomeric A\u03b242 for 1 h normalized by nuclear staining (Kiyota et al., 2009a) . Interestingly, immunofluorescent intensity, against both monomeric and oligomeric A\u03b242, was reduced in CCL2KO, compared to non-Tg microglia (monomeric: 74 % of non-Tg microglia, p < 0.01, oligomeric: 80 % of non-Tg microglia, p < 0.001, Fig. 5P-Q) .\n\nEnhanced \u03b2-amyloidosis in AD is disease signature. In particular, oligomeric forms of A\u03b2 accumulate and effect A\u03b2-induced neurophysiological (Shankar et al., 2008; Walsh et al., 2002) , hippocampal (Lambert et al., 1998) , and memory functions (Cleary et al., 2005; Lesne et al., 2006) . APP/PS1 mice show impaired hippocampal function, memory acquisition and retention. This occurs by 6-7 months of age as seen by RAWM tests (Diamond et al., 1999; Arendash et al., 2001; Jensen et al., 2005; . To assess if CCL2 deficiency affects memory, we employed a RAWM task to assess memory acquisition and retention in non-Tg, CCL2KO, APP/PS1, and APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice. Three 3-day blocks for trial 1 (T1; randomized initial trial), T4 (final acquisition trial), and T5 (delayed retention trial) were used to evaluate the memory function at 6-7 months of age ( Fig. 6 ) (Jensen et al., 2005) . Although all animal groups showed reduced error numbers by T4 through three blocks, the average number in non-Tg or CCL2KO was lower than that in APP/PS1 and APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice. By T5, APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice showed the highest number of errors with significant differences compared to the other groups. APP/PS1 group also showed higher numbers than did non-Tg or CCL2KO animals, but lower than APP/PS1/CCL2KO in blocks 1 and 3. While limitations of the set are acknowledged through the KO mice alone, the data do support the idea that impaired memory acquisition and retention are operative in APP/PS1 and APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice and as such CCL2 deficiency can accelerate such impairments in the setting of AD-like disease.\n\nA number of studies imply correlations between cognitive function and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (Bruel-Jungerman et al., 2007; Deng et al.; Kiyota et al., 2011; Lledo et al., 2006) . Since CCL2-deficient APP/PS1 mice show accelerated impairment in memory retention, we reasoned this could be linked to deficits in neurogenesis. To this end, we examined how CCL2 deficiency might affect neurogenesis and differentiation in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus. We examined expression of doublecortin (Dcx), a marker for newly generated premature neurons in the SGZ (Fig. 7A-D) (Rao and Shetty, 2004) . The numbers of Dcx-positive (Dcx + ) cells in the dentate gyrus of APP/PS1 mice was significantly reduced (1003 \u00b1 113.5 versus non-Tg: 1677 \u00b1 255.4; p < 0.01, Fig. 7I ). In addition, APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice show reduced numbers of Dcx + cells compared to APP/PS1 (456.5 \u00b1 77.82 in APP/PS1/CCL2KO; p < 0.001 versus non-Tg and p < 0.05 vs APP/PS1) (Fig. 7I) , suggesting impaired neuronal differentiation in APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice. To evaluate cell proliferative responses in the SGZ, BrdU was injected intraperitoneally three weeks prior to euthanasia to track neuronal maturation (NeuN + /BrdU + cells) (Fig. 7E-H) . The total BrdU + /NeuN + cell counts in the SGZ were decreased in APP/PS1 mice (534.0 \u00b1 50.52 versus non-Tg: 757.5 \u00b1 57.23; p < 0.05) (Fig. 7J) , and were further decreased in APP/PS1/CCL2KO as compared to APP/PS1 mice (362.4 \u00b1 18.10 in APP/PS1/CCL2KO; p < 0.001 versus non-Tg and p < 0.01 versus APP/PS1) (Fig. 7J) . These data suggest that CCL2 deficiency affects neuronal differentiation and neuronal-linked stem cell proliferation, and also provides a link between alterations in neurogenesis and memory impairment.\n\nWe demonstrate that CCL2 deficiency results in increased A\u03b2 that includes both oligomers and deposits in the brain. This is heralded by the elimination of CCL2-CCR2 signaling affecting microglial chemotaxis as shown by reduced numbers of microglial cells in the brains of CCL2KO mice. The results are consistent with prior reports demonstrating that CCR2 deficiency leads to impaired microglial accumulation and accelerated AD pathobiology (El Khoury et al., 2007; Naert and Rivest, 2011) . Although CCL2 is a major chemokine involved in microglial chemotaxis, it is upregulated in AD brain tissue (Ishizuka et al., 1997) . In addition, CCL2 levels in cerebrospinal fluid and sera are linked to neurodegeneration as they show a significant negative correlation with cognition in mildly impaired AD patients. This suggests that elevated CCL2 is an early event in AD pathogenesis (Galimberti et al., 2006a; Galimberti et al., 2006b) . However, microglia accumulated in brain regions surrounding TS + A\u03b2 deposits in CCL2KO mice. This may be caused by the other ligands including CCL7 that affect microglial nervous system chemotaxis (Chen et al., 2001) .\n\nMicroglia profoundly influences A\u03b2 clearance and degradation (Lee and Landreth, 2010) . Microglia produce proteolytic enzymes such as insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for A\u03b2 degradation (Mentlein et al., 1998; Miners et al., 2011) and expressing receptors promoting A\u03b2 phagocytosis and clearance (El Khoury et al., 1996; Koenigsknecht and Landreth, 2004; Weldon et al., 1998) . Although expression levels of IDE, MMP9 and neprilysin in APP/PS1/CCL2KO were equivalent in APP/PS1 mice (data not shown), significant impairments in phagocytosis were demonstrated for both monomeric and oligomeric A\u03b2 in CCL2-deficient microglia. This linked to reduced expression of CD36 and CD47, scavenger molecules on the MP surface (El Khoury et al., 2003; Koenigsknecht and Landreth, 2004) . Taken together, these data suggest that accelerated \u03b2-amyloidosis, as shown by A\u03b2 load and soluble A\u03b242 levels in CCL2-deficient APP/PS1 mice, is due to impairments of A\u03b2 phagocytosis and clearance. In contrast, CCL2-overexpressing mice showed accelerated AD-pathogenesis including \u03b2-amyloidosis. This may be due to elevated apolipoprotein E relevant to A\u03b2 assembly and microglial activation where A\u03b2 aggregates are released (Kiyota et al., 2009a; Yamamoto et al., 2005) . Therefore, both CCL2overexpressing and deficient AD mice may show similar finding by very divergent mechanisms.\n\nIncreased A\u03b2 burden is significantly associated with impaired cognition in AD mouse models (Morgan, 2003) . We demonstrate that CCL2-deficient APP/PS1 mice show elevated A\u03b2 and impaired memory. However, memory impairments were in retention, but not acquisition. These results, in part, could be linked to the age of the animals studied (Kiyota et al., 2010; Kiyota et al., 2011) .\n\nRecent studies have shown significant correlations between memory function and adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus (Coras et al., 2010) . The enhanced number of mature neurons is especially critical, since the earlier study showed enhanced neuronal division but impaired maturation in AD brain (Jin et al., 2004) . In the mouse model of AD, the neurogenesis was impaired in APP/PS1 mice after counting the reduced number of Dcx + and BrdU + /NeuN + cells as shown previously (Kiyota et al., 2011; Kiyota et al., 2012) , but the even fewer number of the cells was found in APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice, demonstrating that the CCL2-deficiency accelerates impairment of the neurogenesis that is closely associated with improvement in spatial learning. Although the effect of A\u03b2 species in different aggregated forms on neurogenesis has been a matter of debate (Waldau and Shetty, 2008) , we have shown that increased A\u03b2 oligomer species are significantly correlated with impaired neurogenesis. In accord with these results, the impaired neuronal maturation is affected by enhanced \u03b2-amyloidosis in CCL2-deficit APP/PS1 mice. This was shown to be correlated with both BrdU + /NeuN + and Dcx + cell counts. In addition, single Tg mice expressing PS1 M146 mutant does not affect cell proliferation in standard condition (Choi et al., 2008) , and we did not observe any impaired neuronal proliferation and differentiation in CCL2KO mice, suggesting that worsen neurogenesis in APP/PS1/ CCL2KO mice is caused by a synergistic effect of PS1 mutant in a CCL2KO background for impaired neurogenesis.\n\nAll together, we now demonstrate that CCL2-deficiency results in accelerated \u03b2-amyloidosis with increased oligomer species, decreased microglial cell immunostaining, impaired A\u03b2 phagocytic ability, and memory impairment accompanied with reduced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus. Taken together, these studies support an idea that CCL2 is a key molecule to maintain normal brain function in an animal model of AD, and offers new insights into the disease processes during progressive neurodegeneration. A\u03b242, SDS-insoluble A\u03b242 in the brain, and A\u03b242 in plasma were measured by human A\u03b242 specific ELISA (n = 5). Bars represent mean \u00b1 S.E.M. * denotes p < 0.05 as determined by Student's t-test. A\u03b2 oligomer formation in the APP/PS1 or APP/PS1/CCL2KO mouse brain. (A) Extracellular-enriched fractions of the APP/PS1 and APP/PS1/CCL2KO mouse brain tissues were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 6E10 antibody, followed by immunoblotting using biotinylated 6E10 antibody showing specific A\u03b2 oligomers. Arrowheads indicate respective migration positions of monomer and oligomers. The arrow indicates sAPP\u03b1 fragments processed from full-length APP. A short-term exposed images (5 minutes, top two panels) are shown to provide single bands of sAPP\u03b1 and 75kDa A\u03b2 (A\u03b275), in addition to overnight exposed image (bottom). NTg: non-Tg mouse brain as a negative control. (B) Band luminescent intensities for 1, 3, 12-mers and A\u03b275 were quantified by Image J software. Bars represent mean \u00b1 S.E.M. (n = 10 per group). *, ** or *** denotes p < 0.05, 0.01 or 0.001 versus APP/PS1, as determined by Student's t-test. Reduced expression of CD47, but not CD36. (A) Immunoblotting of CD36 and CD47 in membrane-enriched fraction of the mouse brain in APP/PS1 and APP/PS1/CCL2KO mice. (B) Quantification CD36 and CD47 expression. Bars represent mean \u00b1 S.E.M. * denotes p < 0.05 as determined by Student's t-test (n = 6 per group).\n\nImpaired phagocytosis of A\u03b2 in CCL2-deficient primary microglia. (A-O) Primary mouse microglia were incubated with monomeric or oligomeric A\u03b242 for 1 h, followed by immunofluorescence with anti-A\u03b2 Ab (green) and Hoechst33342 for nuclear staining (blue). Merged captured images were shown. Scale bar, 50 \u03bcm. (P-Q) Fluorometric quantification of A\u03b2 fluorescent signal (Ex/Em = 488 nm/519 nm) normalized by Hoechst33342 signal (Ex/Em = 350 nm/461 nm). Bars represent mean \u00b1 S.E.M. ** or *** denotes p < 0.01 or 0.001 as determined by one-way ANOVA and Newman-Keuls post-test, respectively (n = 4 per group). CCL2 deficiency accelerates memory impairment in APP+PS1 mice. Non-Tg, CCL2KO, APP/PS1 and APP/PS1/CCL2 mice were tested by the RAWM task at 6-7 months of age. Non-Tg serves as a positive control for the spatial learning task. The compiled average errors for day 1-3, 4-6 and 7-9 are shown. Bars represent mean \u00b1 S.E.M. (n = 12 per group). *, ** or *** denotes p < 0.01 or 0.001 as determined by two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni tests."}
