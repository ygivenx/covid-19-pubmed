{"title": "CHAP TER 1 Cardiovascular System", "body": "contributions are gratefully acknowledged.\n\nThe heart is structured and functions to fulfill a singular role, which is to move sufficient volumes of blood to all organs in the body to meet the varying metabolic needs of the organism. For this purpose, the heart can be described as an in-series, 2-stage, rate-variable, one-way pump. From this characterization, the heart must provide sufficient force to eject the blood it receives, respond to the host's needs by varying the amount of blood ejected per unit time, and finally, ensure one-way flow without impediment of forward flow as well as prevent backflow. As befits a biological pump, the heart is a physically active organ that rhythmically contracts and relaxes which, over an average 10-year lifetime of a dog, beats in the vicinity of 400 million times and receives and ejects ten million liters of blood-by any measure, a remarkable and sustained performance.\n\nIf the structure or function of any of the components of the pump are compromised or fail, it will result in either diminution, or at worst, complete cessation of function. Additionally, if each component of the heart as a pump is examined and understood, it then facilitates the understanding and categorization of the causes and effects of component dysfunction. We are concerned predominantly with the diseases that interfere with the heart's rate and rhythm, its strength of contraction, and the flow of blood through the heart. Heart disease may be clinically detectable and, when sufficiently severe, may give rise to heart failure, or may be only evident on postmortem (eFig. 1-1).\n\nUnder the anatomic units of the pericardium, endocardium, and myocardium, we will first consider the normal form and function of the heart, the morphologic patterns of disease, its pathophysiology, and finally, its reaction to injury and its specific diseases.\n\nLocated within the mediastinum, the heart is enclosed in the fibroserous pericardial sac, which is lined by a serosal membrane and contains several milliliters of clear serous fluid that acts as a lubricant.\n\nThe heart consists of a right and left side; each side consists of an atrium and a ventricle. The ventricles function as 2 pumps in series. Venous blood from the body enters the right atrium, passes into the right ventricle, and is pumped through the pulmonary artery into the lungs to be oxygenated and to give up its carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood returns via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium, enters the left ventricle, and is then pumped to the body via the aorta. Heart weight varies with species, age, sex, nutritional status, and fitness level of the animal; averages about 1% of body weight in newborns; and decreases to 0.3-0.8% in juveniles and adults.\n\nVentricular thickness varies greatly. Left ventricular free wall and interventricular septum are normally 2-4 times thicker than the right ventricular free wall. An increase in myocardial mass is termed hypertrophy; an increase in chamber volume is termed dilation. An overall increase in the external dimensions of the heart is termed cardiomegaly.\n\nThe 4 cardiac valves are structured to allow unimpeded unidirectional blood flow, to prevent backflow, and to withstand pressure, especially those of the left side of the heart. The atrioventricular (AV) valves, supported by tendinous cords (chordae tendineae) and papillary muscles of the ventricles, allow flow from the atria into the ventricles and prevent backflow into the atria. The right AV (RAV, tricuspid) valve has 3 valve cusps (2 cusps in the dog). The left AV (LAV, bicuspid, mitral) valve in most species consists of 2 cusps. The pulmonic and aortic semilunar (crescent moon-shaped) valves each have 3 cusps, and they allow flow into the pulmonary artery and aorta, respectively, and prevent backflow into the ventricles. The nodules (nodules of Arantius) in the center of the free edges of the semilunar valve cusps are normal structures. Valve cusps are normally thin and translucent. The free edges of the valve cusps (coaptation region) normally overlap during closure, and therefore fenestrations of the valve edges are usually insignificant. Normal valve function depends on coordinated actions of the respective annulus and leaflets, and in the case of AV valves, the tendinous cords, papillary muscles, and ventricular walls.\n\nThe cardiac muscle and valves are supported at the base of the heart by the cardiac skeleton, which consists of 4 fibrous rings, the fibrous triangle, and the fibrous or membranous part of the ventricular septum. The fibrous triangle fills the space between the AV openings and the base of the aorta; it consists of dense fibrous connective tissue in pigs and cats, fibrocartilage in dogs, hyaline cartilage in horses, and bone (os cordis) in large ruminants.\n\nThe blood supply to the heart is primarily via 2 major coronary arteries. The left and right coronary arteries arise, respectively, behind the left and right cusps of the aortic valve at the base of the aorta. The left coronary artery gives rise to the left descending and the left circumflex coronary arteries. The epicardial coronary arteries give rise to the intramural arteries that penetrate the myocardium. Most coronary arterial blood flow occurs during ventricular diastole, when the coronary microcirculation is not compressed by myocardial contraction. The myocardial conduction system consists of modified cardiac myocytes that initiate and conduct an electrical impulse ( Fig. 1-1) . The sinus node (sinoatrial node, SA node) is located subepicardially at the junction of the cranial vena cava and the right auricle. Because cells in the sinus node are not capable of remaining in a depolarized state, after each repolarization, their membranes permit leakage of sodium and potassium until they reach a stage of depolarization (the critical threshold), when they rapidly depolarize. The impulse from this pacemaker (the dominant pacemaker) in turn causes atrial depolarization and contraction, and travels through internodal bundles to the AV node located in the interatrial septum just cranial to the coronary sinus. The impulse slows while traversing the AV node before traveling via the AV bundle (bundle of His) to the left and right bundle branches, or crura, through the Purkinje fibers. These modified myocardial cells ramify within the myocardium and transmit the depolarizing impulse to ventricular myocytes.\n\nAlthough each component of the conduction system has different rates of diastolic depolarization, the sinus node has the most frequent rate and is therefore dominant. The frequency of depolarization of the sinus node is in turn modified by the autonomic nervous system. Atrial and ventricular myocytes do not normally exhibit the property of automaticity. However, when atrial or ventricular myocytes are injured, they may repeatedly depolarize independent of a stimulus from the conduction system and may become dominant pacemakers. There are diseases that specifically affect the conduction system producing dysrhythmias (abnormalities of rate and rhythm), but it is the dysrhythmias resulting from disease injuring the atrial and ventricular myocytes that are most common. The cardiac wall has 3 layers: 1. The epicardium, the outermost layer 2. The myocardium, the thick muscular middle layer 3. The endocardium, the innermost layer, which is continuous with the tunica intima of the great vessels entering and leaving the heart The epicardium, or visceral pericardium, consists of a thin layer of mesothelium resting on elastic fiber-rich connective tissue that merges with that of the myocardium. The epicardium is continuous with the parietal pericardium, which consists of an inner mesothelial layer and a thick layer of collagen and elastic fibers. The cavity between the visceral and parietal pericardium contains serous fluid that lubricates the surfaces and reduces friction between the epicardium and pericardium during cardiac motion. Although the pericardial sac is not a vital organ, its proper function includes prevention of sudden cardiac dilation, assurance of equal end-diastolic transmural pressures throughout the ventricles, limitation of right ventricular stroke work, hydrostatic compensation for gravitational or inertial forces, reduction of friction, and maintenance of cardiac alignment and streamlined cardiac flow. original state and is often left thickened, shrunken, and distorted. Affected valves may be either insufficient or stenotic or both, but one or the other usually predominates. Distortions of the structure of heart valves in the absence of vegetations and with an intact valvular endothelium are commonly encountered. Valves can be effaced, displaced, shrunken, thickened, or, in the case of the AV valves, no longer firmly anchored to the papillary muscles. All result, to a greater or lesser extent, in a diminution of effective unidirectional blood flow. Probably the best examples of distortions in architecture are those seen in congenital heart disease, such as valvular aortic and pulmonic stenosis, left and right AV valvular stenosis or insufficiency. Similar lesions can be seen in acute or healed valvular endocarditis and degenerative diseases of the AV valves, such as endocardiosis in dogs. Abnormal chamber or great vessel communication is of special interest because of the altered hemodynamics that ensue in the transition from fetal to postnatal life. Predominantly congenital in origin, it is often the result of incomplete closure of fetal communications between the atria, ventricles, and great vessels following birth. Acquired arteriovenous communication can also occur.\n\nThe myocardium may be primarily and specifically affected by a particular disease, but it may also be just another organ involved in systemic disease. The morphologic manifestations of myocardial disease reflect some of the characteristics of the myocardium, such as the predominance of contractile proteins in each cardiac myocyte; the exquisite compartmentalization of calcium required for regular and orderly contraction; its high requirement for energy for regular contraction; its endarterial blood supply, predisposing the myocardium to infarction; and the very limited capacity of cardiac myocytes for regeneration. Cardiac myocytes, however, have a remarkable capacity to increase in mass (hypertrophy) in response to an increase in either physiologic or pathologic workload.\n\nAs do all tissues, the myocardium has a limited set of reactions to injury, but the pattern and distribution of lesions may aid in arriving at a morphologic and etiologic diagnosis. The stage of irreversible damage to a myocyte, at least in ischemia, is determined by structural and functional changes in the mitochondria. Irreversible damage occurs after only 30 minutes of ischemia, whether or not flow is restored.\n\nShortly after birth, most cardiac myocytes lose their ability to regenerate. Once the neonatal period passes and a particular myocyte or group of myocytes is lost, there is usually no replacement. There is, however, recent evidence to show that there is a low level of cardiac myocyte turnover throughout life. On the death of myocytes, there is progressive scavenging of the necrotic or apoptotic remnants of the myocytes and replacement by fibrosis. Remaining myocytes do have the capacity for compensatory hypertrophy.\n\nMyocardial injury may be functionally manifest as either irregularities in the rate or rhythm of impulse formation and conduction (dysrhythmias), or as depression in the force of myocardial contraction. Dysrhythmias are usually associated with acute, nonlethal, often focal injury to cardiac myocytes. Contractility disturbances occur when there are either insufficient numbers of ventricular myocytes for effective contraction, as occurs in massive ischemic necrosis of ventricular myocytes following blockage of a major coronary artery, or when there is generalized ineffective contraction of normal numbers of myocytes. Generalized, ineffective myocardial skeleton, and bases of the cardiac valves. Blood collected by venules and veins is drained into the right atrium via the coronary sinus. Lymphatic capillaries draining the cardiac connective tissue are continuous with larger lymph vessels in the endocardium and epicardium. Sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation is extensive in the atria, and particularly around the SA and AV nodes.\n\nThe 3 broad anatomic divisions of the heart-the mural and valvular endocardium, the myocardium, and the pericardiumexhibit differing features in the face of disease. It is not that the usual suspects that affect all organs are not in play. Inherited disease, infectious agents, toxins, nutritional deficiencies, and neoplasia all affect the heart, but it is the combination of the structure of the heart, the biological characteristics of the cells comprising the heart, and their response to injury, in concert with the host's general response to injury, that results in the display of the particular features of heart disease. It should be remembered that the heart may also show evidence of disease as an integral part of diseases of another organ system or systemic disease.\n\nValvular abnormality from any cause can lead to disturbances of blood flow through the heart either by altering the normal unidirectional pattern of flow, or by impeding blood flow into or out of the chambers. Alterations in hemodynamics reflect changes in systolic workloads characterized by changed pressure loading during contraction (afterload), or changed volume loading during diastole (preload) . Most valvular disorders impose only a single preload or afterload on the heart. This encompasses those valvular disorders that cause either insufficiency (failure to close) or stenosis (narrowing, failure to open) . Some of the congenital heart abnormalities, such as patent ductus arteriosus and tetralogy of Fallot, have multiple preload and afterload effects. The general rules are (eFig. 1-2): 1. Valvular insufficiency increases the preload on the ventricle. 2. Semilunar valvular stenosis, outflow tract stenosis, and hypertension increase the afterload on the ventricle. 3. AV valvular stenoses and pericardial disorders decrease the preload on the ventricles. Subendocardial hemorrhage is a frequent accompaniment to a myriad of diseases of the heart, but more particularly, with systemic disease, where the heart is just another surface where hemorrhage can be observed. Subendocardial mineralization occurs as either a dystrophic or metastatic phenomenon. Additions to valves and/or the mural endocardium result from disturbances to the health of the endothelial lining of the mural and valvular endocardium, and because of the location, can have wide-ranging consequences. The most severe and extensive occurs with microorganisms, particularly bacteria, that arrive via the systemic circulation that adhere to endothelium and/or subendocardium after the endothelium has been damaged or eroded. The cascade of events that follow, especially the incitement of thrombosis, results in a mass of platelets, fibrin, and inflammatory cells (vegetations) accumulating on the exposed surfaces, impeding blood flow through the heart and predisposing to thrombotic emboli lodging in end-arteries in organs throughout the host. Although healing may occur, the healed valve is rarely returned to its eFigure 1-2 Hemodynamic effects of valvular abnormalities. AV, atrioventricular; SL, semilunar.\n\n(Courtesy Vasileios Psychas.) \n\nDiseases affecting the sinus node of the heart's specialized conduction system can lead to an increase, decrease, or absence of impulse formation. Any disease affecting the conducting fibers-the intra-atrial conduction pathways, the AV node, the common bundle, right and left bundle branches, or Purkinje fibers-can result in a decrease or an absence of impulse conduction. These are manifest as various forms of bradyarrhythmias (heart block), such as sinoatrial arrest; first-, second-, and third-degree heart block; and left and right bundle branch block. By far and away the most significant and most common disturbances of impulse formation are those that arise from injury to atrial and ventricular myocytes. Common causes include electrolyte disturbances, coronary arterial thrombosis or embolism, nutritional deficiencies, bacterial and viral infections, and toxins, especially plant toxins. The predominant alterations in heart rate and rhythm are an increased rate and an erratic rhythm (tachyarrhythmias). It should be noted that arrhythmias arise from the inappropriate depolarization of injured components of the conduction system or cardiac myocytes (ectopic pacemakers) that are often in close proximity to necrotic/apoptotic myocytes. The major pathophysiologic effect of disturbances of the heart's rate rhythm or conduction is erratic filling and contraction, leading to a depression in cardiac output. Disturbances of both impulse formation and impulse conduction can be readily classified through the use of electrocardiography.\n\nThis category is essentially one of either a decrease in ventricular myocardial contractile critical mass, such as in massive myocardial necrosis, or, in a heart that has sufficient ventricular myocardial mass, but where there is a disturbance in the effectiveness of contraction. The latter occurs in a number of dilated cardiomyopathies, especially in dogs and cats.\n\nThis occurs with stenosis (narrowing) of the AV or semilunar valves, resulting in either a restriction of blood flow from one chamber to another (atrium to ventricle), or from a ventricle to the major arteries. This places an increased systolic workload (afterload) on the affected chamber. The lesion is not invariably pure in nature. Stenotic valves can also be mildly regurgitant, but it is the stenosis that predominates. Stenosis can either be congenital or acquired. More common forms of acquired impedance of blood flow include acute valvular endocarditis with thrombosis or healed endocarditis with resultant distorting fibrosis of the valves.\n\nThis is associated with lesions of the AV and semilunar valves in which the valve structure is so effaced that it becomes insufficient and cannot prevent backflow of blood from ventricle to atrium or from a great vessel back to its ventricle. With regurgitation, the heart responds by increasing its stroke volume, which places an increased diastolic load (preload) on the heart. The lesion can be congenital, such as congenital mitral insufficiency, or acquired, such as healed endocarditis or the degenerative AV valvular condition endocardiosis, in dogs. Again, some primarily insufficient valves can be mildly stenotic, but in these cases, the insufficiency predominates.\n\ncontraction is most commonly seen as a feature of dilated cardiomyopathies. The basis of generalized ineffective contraction is complex and reflects the many contributing factors to the normal functioning of cardiac myocytes. For example, with the cardiomyopathies, there are a number of disorders that have as their origin inherited defects in either contractile proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, or mitochondrial proteins, all leading to a lowering of the effectiveness of contraction.\n\nA number of grossly observable permutations and combinations assist in arriving at a diagnosis that involves the myocardium. An increase in ventricular wall thickness or mass should lead the investigator to search for a cause of increased workload performed by the heart, such as a stenotic valve, or a shunt between chambers or great vessels, which produce an increased afterload on the heart. If no obvious cause for the increased mass can be discerned, a primary myocardial disease, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, should be considered. A dilated ventricular lumen accompanied by a normal to thin ventricular wall leads toward consideration of an increased preload on the heart, such as AV or semilunar valvular insufficiency or a vascular shunt. In the absence of an inciting cause, dilated cardiomyopathy should be considered. Focal pale areas in an otherwise normally appearing myocardium suggest destruction of cardiac myocytes alone, cellular infiltration alone, or a combination of the two. The most common causes include bacterial and viral infections as well as nutritional deficiencies and toxins that induce necrosis of cardiac myocytes. Metastatic neoplasms should also be considered. Although rare in domestic animals, a special type of focal, well-circumscribed area of paleness with a reddened periphery is indicative of a recent infarct following thrombosis of a coronary artery. Focal scarring/fibrosis of the ventricular wall is characteristic of a healed infarct or replacement fibrosis of necrotic cardiac myocytes. Discrete nodules in the chamber walls, especially of the ventricles, are typical of bacterial/ fungal/parasitic infections. Frank abscessation is more typical of bacterial infection, whereas nodules with caseous centers ringed by well-demarcated fibrous tissue suggest intermediate stage parasitic infection.\n\nThe inability of the pericardium to stretch rapidly to accommodate additional fluid in the pericardial sac leads to clinically significant disease. Fluid accumulation prevents adequate filling of the chambers during diastole, lowering stroke volume and cardiac output. This is also central feature of a resolving or resolved pericarditis. \u2022 Blood, often clotted blood, within the pericardial sac is often the result of a ruptured atrium, ventricle, great vessel, or coronary artery. Unclotted blood in the pericardial sac, of unknown cause, occurs in dogs. \u2022 Clear fluid in the pericardial sac should lead to an investigation of causes of hypoproteinemia and as part of a number of infectious diseases. \u2022 Fibrinous/purulent exudates in the pericardial sac usually indicate acute bacterial/mycoplasmal infection. The presence of pericardial and epicardial fibrosis often indicates a prolonged and ineffective attempt at repairing acute fibrinous and purulent pericarditis.\n\nWhen the heart is diseased, there is a restricted array of alterations in function that can be categorized as follows.\n\nIncreased cardiac work demands on one or both ventricles result from disturbed hemodynamics, in the form of sustained pressure overload (e.g., obstructed flow in aortic valvular stenosis) or volume overload (e.g., regurgitant flow in mitral valvular regurgitation).\n\nCongestive heart failure is characterized by vascular congestion and edema fluid within the interstitium of tissues and body cavities. Not all cases of heart failure are of the congestive type. Although in congestive heart failure the clinical manifestations are more or less constant, in acute heart failure, there may be intermittent weakness and syncope caused by a substantial change in heart rate or rhythm, resulting in a precipitous drop in cardiac output. The effect of acute heart failure is often sudden unexpected death, often with minimal lesions. Circulatory failure, or shock, denotes a state of inadequate peripheral vascular perfusion and is used to describe a state that may or may not be the result of heart failure. It is characterized by a drop in effective circulating blood volume. Common causes are acute internal or external hemorrhage, dehydration, or endotoxic shock. Shock can of course lead to acute heart failure.\n\nBased on clinical manifestations, heart failure may be predominantly either left-sided failure or right-sided failure. Leftsided failure results in left atrial dilation, pulmonary congestion and edema, and clinical signs of dyspnea and cough. A prominent feature of chronic left-sided heart failure is the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages (\"heart failure cells\") in pulmonary alveoli, the result of diapedesis of red cells into the alveoli. Right-sided failure results in excessive right atrial pressure and systemic venous congestion, expressed as jugular distension, hepatic and splenic enlargement, ascites, and peripheral edema. Cor pulmonale is defined as right heart failure secondary to pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dirofilariasis, or pulmonary thromboembolism. Because the cardiovascular system is closed, failure of one ventricle will ultimately lead to failure of the other, culminating in global or biventricular failure.\n\nAlthough there are many causes that lead to intermittent or permanent lowering of effective cardiac output, there is a limited set of responses to this by the animal. The major compensatory mechanisms include the intrinsic cardiac responses of dilation and hypertrophy, and the systemic responses, which include increased heart rate and peripheral resistance, redistribution of blood flow, venular constriction, and increased blood volume. In each case, the compensatory responses are at least temporarily beneficial and are directed toward increasing cardiac output to meet the metabolic needs of the animal. The range within which the compensatory mechanisms result in an increase in cardiac output is wide. Indeed, the increase may be up to 5 times the basal rate. As cardiac output falls below the requirements of the animal, signs of congestive heart failure appear. These may be intermittent or prolonged, depending on the nature of the defect.\n\nAn untoward side effect of the systemic responses is increased capillary hydrostatic pressure that leads to the accumulation of edema fluid. This can involve the systemic or pulmonary veins. Right-sided lesions, such as right atrioventricular (AV) valvular insufficiency, pulmonic stenosis, or pulmonary hypertension, result in peripheral-dependent edema (e.g., submandibular edema [\"bottle-jaw\"], brisket edema), ascites, hydrothorax, and hydropericardium. Left-sided defects, such as left AV or aortic valvular insufficiency, cause pulmonary edema as the predominant finding.\n\nAlthough these can be acquired, they are much more commonly congenital in origin. They can be simple communications between the great vessels (patent ductus arteriosus), the atria (patent foramen ovale/atrial septal defect), or the ventricles (ventricular septal defect). The pathophysiology can be complicated where the defect results in increases in both preload and afterload on particular chambers. A special case of shunted blood flow occurs with the transposition of the great vessels.\n\nPericardial disease, either acute or chronic, can restrict chamber filling during diastole, as can some of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. In essence, the compliance of either the pericardium or the myocardium is reduced, which prevents full diastolic relaxation of the ventricles. The major pathologic effect is one of increased central venous pressure leading to congestive heart failure, which can be predominantly rightsided or left-sided, depending on which chamber is most affected.\n\nhypertrophy. Physiologic hypertrophy is initiated by ligands that include thyroid hormone, insulin, insulin growth factor 1, and growth hormone. Additionally, cardiac function is maintained or enhanced and is reversible. On the other hand, with pathologic hypertrophy, there may be up to a 4-fold increase in mass, depressed cardiac function, and the induction of a molecular fetal stress cardiac gene program. Of particular note is the initiation of hypertrophy by mechanical work through the activation of stretch-sensing transducing proteins located in the plasma membrane, within the cardiac Z line, or by adhesion complexes. The following discussion will be concerned only with the process of hypertrophy following a defined change in workload or stimulation. The presence of hypertrophy in the absence of an observable increase in workload will be considered to be primary and is discussed under the cardiomyopathies.\n\nIn pathologic hypertrophy, the mass and size of the heart are increased through a restricted number of hypertrophic stimuli resulting in the activation of a limited number of intracellular signal transduction pathways that alter gene expression. The initiating actions include mechanical stimuli (stretch) or trophic stimuli (polypeptide growth factors; vasoactive agents, such as angiotensin II and \u03b1-adrenergic agonists), all of which increase the rate of protein synthesis; the amount of protein, especially contractile proteins; the size of myocytes; and the number of sarcomeres and mitochondria. The hypertrophic response is accompanied by selective upregulation of several immediate early-response genes and embryonic forms of contractile and other proteins. The phenotype of the hypertrophic myocyte may be changed by this expression of embryonic genes, for instance, induction of atrial natriuretic factor occurs in ventricular myocytes, and late response genes, such as \u03b2-myosin heavy chain and skeletal \u03b1-actin, may be expressed (a switch from adult to fetal/neonatal forms). Other genes are also activated and selectively regulated in hypertrophy, including immediate early genes or proto-oncogenes that encode early regulatory factors (c-jun, c-fos, egr-1), growth factors (transforming growth factor-\u03b2, insulin-like growth factor, fibroblast growth factor), vasoactive agents (\u03b1-adrenergic agonists, endothelin-1, angiotensin II), and components involved in receptor-mediated signaling pathways, such as protein kinase C.\n\nIn pathologic states, hypertrophy is an adaptive response of limited benefit, where myocytes have impaired intrinsic contractility, impaired ventricular relaxation, and decreased compliance, which cause increased end-diastolic pressure and limited exercise performance. Once further muscle mass cannot meet the demands posed by increased workload, heart failure ensues. Degenerative changes occur in myofibers, including loss of myocardial contractile elements. Limitations to continued hypertrophy and the reasons for eventual myocardial failure include inadequacy of the vascular supply to the enlarged fibers, diminished oxidative capacity of mitochondria, altered protein synthesis and degradation, and cytoskeletal alterations. The capillary density in hypertrophic myocardium typically does not keep pace with myofiber size, intercapillary distances increase, and fibrous tissue is deposited in the interstitium (\"reactive interstitial fibrosis\"). Also, the altered isoforms of proteins produced by expression of fetal genes may be less functional than adult forms. Myocyte hypertrophy occurs only if increased protein synthesis exceeds the rate of degradation. Similarly, hypertrophy of the ventricle occurs only if growth of individual myocytes exceeds the\n\nDilation is a response to an increased workload in both physiologic and pathologic states. Increasing the end-diastolic volume, and hence stretching the myofibers, can increase the contractile force of the heart and increase the stroke volume and cardiac output. This is known as the Frank-Starling relationship, or heterometric autoregulation. Transient cardiac dilation is an acute response to increased demands, for instance, increased exercise. Continued stretch increases contractile force to a limit, after which increased stretch will result in a decrease in tension developed. The limit of stretch in most species appears to be a sarcomere length of 2.2-2.4 \u00b5m. Chronic dilation of a ventricle can occur through addition of sarcomeres and hence lengthening of myocytes.\n\nVarious disease conditions can cause an increased diastolic workload (preload) and hence dilation of the heart, such as arteriovenous shunts, and AV and semilunar valvular insufficiencies ( Fig. 1-2) . Acute volume overload of a chamber is expected to lead to dilation, whereas chronic volume overload is one stimulus to the development of cardiac hypertrophy.\n\nCardiac hypertrophy is a reversible increase in the mass and a minimal increase in the number of myocardial cells, and is a compensatory response to an increase in mechanical work or to trophic signals. In general, chronic pressure overload leads to myocardial hypertrophy, whereas chronic volume overload leads to combined ventricular dilation and hypertrophy. Hyperplasia, or increase in the number of cells, has recently been shown to occur in response to workload, although the capacity of the myocyte to divide decreases rapidly prior to birth, and little mitotic activity is observed after the first few weeks of life.\n\nAt this juncture, it is important to distinguish between hypertrophy that is physiologic and hypertrophy that is pathologic in nature. Physiologic hypertrophy is a response to exercise or pregnancy and results in a mild increase in heart weight, not >10-20% normalized to body weight. It is an extension of the normal growth process, is without deleterious effect and occurs without the induction of the molecular stress fetal gene program that is associated with the development of pathologic apoptotic loss of myocytes; excessive apoptosis can contribute to failure of a hypertrophic heart. This postulate is supported by experimental work with receptor-mediated G\u03b1q signaling of cultured rat cardiac myocytes (G\u03b1q is the \u03b1 subunit of the Gq family of G proteins, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, which transduce signals); moderate levels of Gq signaling stimulate cardiac hypertrophy, whereas high-level Gq activation results in cardiac myocyte apoptosis.\n\nThere are distinctive anatomic patterns of hypertrophy that accompany the increase in workload. Concentric cardiac hypertrophy, that is, an increase in mass of the ventricle without accompanying increase in end-diastolic volume, characterizes increased systolic loads (increased afterloads), such as aortic stenosis, pulmonic stenosis, and pulmonary hypertension in patent ductus arteriosus. There is often a decrease in the volume of the ventricular lumen ( Fig. 1-3 ). An increase in diastolic load (increased preload), typically produced by AV or semilunar valvular insufficiencies or by arteriovenous shunts, results in eccentric cardiac hypertrophy, which is an increase in myocardial mass accompanied by increased end-diastolic volume (dilated chamber). Because of dilation, the thickness of the involved ventricular wall is usually no more than normal and may be less ( Fig. 1-4) .\n\nIn relation to altered hemodynamic loads placed on the heart, AV valvular stenosis or pericardial fibrosis restrict ventricular filling, leading to a decrease of the load on the myocardium ( Fig. 1-5) .\n\nThe gross appearance of the hypertrophic heart depends on the chamber affected and the nature of the insult. In general, hypertrophy of the right side of the heart makes the heart broader at its base; hypertrophy of the left side increases the organ length; bilateral hypertrophy produces a more rounded shape than normal.\n\nIn concentric hypertrophy, there is increased thickness of the wall of the affected chamber, and a marked increase in the Increased ventricular contractility following stretching of myofibers size of the papillary muscles and the trabeculae carneae ( Fig.  1-6 ). Although the hypertrophy may emphasize one or other chamber, the whole heart is involved. When the right ventricle is involved, the moderator band (trabecula septomarginalis) may be much thickened. Extreme hypertrophy of one chamber In both types of hypertrophy, the endocardium may be diffusely opaque as a result of subendocardial fibrosis, and this alteration may be the best indication of dilation in the atria, in which dilation and hypertrophy can be difficult to assess.\n\nAn example of concentric cardiac hypertrophy occurs in cats with hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis), a condition usually resulting from the presence of thyroid hyperplasia or adenoma. The thyroid glands in these cases are unilaterally or bilaterally enlarged, nodular, pink to dark brown, and may contain cysts. Microscopically, the thyroids usually exhibit a mixture of hyperplastic areas, adenomatous nodules, and normal follicles (see also disorders of the thyroid gland in Vol. 3, Endocrine glands). The pathogenesis of ventricular hypertrophy in this disease is not clear, but may involve the direct action of thyroid hormones on myocardium, enhanced myocardial adrenergic receptor number or affinity, peripheral vasodilation, and work hypertrophy in response to increased peripheral tissue demands for oxygen and dissipation of heat. The hearts in most cases are symmetrically hypertrophied; however, some exhibit asymmetric hypertrophy. The left ventricular lumen is usually reduced in size. Affected myofibers are enlarged, but are not in disarray in the great majority of cases. The hypertrophy is reversible on return to euthyroidism.\n\nThe extracardiac features of heart failure stem from 2 basic pathophysiologic changes: fluid accumulation and tissue or organ ischemia. Depending on the cause of the heart failure, both effects may be present, but it is more usual for one to predominate.\n\nFluid accumulation results from the retention of sodium and water, which primarily involves the kidneys, and also involves atrial natriuretic factor released from the heart (eFig. 1-3A). The influence of the failing heart on the kidneys stems from its inability to supply them with an adequate flow of blood. Blood flow through different parts of the kidneys depends on the vasomotor tone of blood vessels within the may encroach on the diastolic capacity of its opposite number. Microscopically, the myocytes are enlarged, but the increase in the size of fibers is not uniform and is not always easy to discern on routine microscopy.\n\nIn eccentric hypertrophy and dilation, the heart tends to be globose, and even though the mass is increased, the wall is usually thin. The papillary muscles may also be attenuated ( Fig. 1-7) . eFigure 1-3 Congestive heart failure. A. Pathogenesis of heart failure. This involves sodium and water retention by the kidney following reduced blood flow/redistribution of blood flow to the kidney. Increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) activity also contributes to the retention of water. All lead to an increase in blood volume. ( \n\nCardiac syncope is characterized clinically by profound changes in blood pressure and heart rate with bradycardia or tachycardia, either of which may result in inadequate output of blood. Both may occur in the presence or absence of organic heart disease. In one form of cardiac syncope, hypersensitive or hyperactive reflexes, for which the vagus nerve is the efferent limb, may result in reflex inhibition of the heart rate, manifest as extreme bradycardia or as asystole. The sudden deaths that result from acute pleural irritation or the tracheal irritation of aspirated vomitus fall into this group, and obviously there may be no organic heart lesion.\n\nIn a second form of cardiac syncope, the heart rate is extremely rapid, and the cardiac output severely reduced. Such may occur in paroxysmal tachycardia, atrial flutter or fibrillation, and ventricular fibrillation.\n\nThird, in organic heart disease with complete obstruction of impulse conduction from the atrium to the ventricle (complete heart block), syncope may occur if there is sufficient delay before the ventricle assumes an independent rhythm.\n\nFinally, cardiac syncope may terminate a syndrome of congestive cardiac failure when the cardiac reserve is depleted and the heart cannot increase its output sufficiently to meet sudden increases in peripheral needs.\n\nPeripheral circulatory failure is characterized by reduction in the effective circulating blood volume with insufficient venous return and reduced cardiac output. Acute hemorrhage and shock are examples of this form of circulatory failure.\n\nThe combination of compensatory mechanisms, brought into play to maintain cardiac output, is in general successful. However, there is also the planting of the seeds of destruction. Both the local increase in venous hydrostatic pressure and the increased sodium and water retention by the kidneys tend to promote the development of interstitial edema. Depending on the inciting abnormality, it is usual for one side of the heart to fail before the other, but it must be remembered that the cardiovascular system is a closed circuit and that failure of one side will eventually embarrass the other (eFig. 1-3B).\n\nLeft-sided heart failure is ushered in by progressive dilation of the left ventricle and atrium, although this progression may be marked by exacerbations and remissions if hypertrophy is given time to develop. The major extracardiac manifestations of left-sided failure arise from the damming back of blood in the lungs and the diminution in cardiac output. The pulmonary venous congestion is transmitted back to the capillaries of the alveolar wall, and edema fluid accumulates in the interstitial tissue and the alveolar spaces. The consequent reduction in pulmonary vital capacity and impaired gaseous exchange of cardiogenic pulmonary edema result in hypoxic stimulation of the carotid sinus and medullary respiratory centers so that reflex dyspnea occurs. A wheezing bronchial cough is common and is presumed to be due to irritation of the respiratory parenchyma. It is considered that many, if not all, of the intrarenal blood flow changes in heart failure follow increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system.\n\nThe kidneys receive approximately 20% of the output of the left ventricle, almost all of which flows through the renal cortices. One of the earliest changes following a drop in cardiac output is redistribution of blood flow within the kidney. There is reduced flow through the outer renal cortex and increased flow within the outer renal medulla. This results in readjustment of the filtration fraction, which is the ratio of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to renal blood flow. Contrary to expectations, there is a less than proportionate drop in GFR compared with renal blood flow, resulting in an increased filtration fraction. As a consequence, proportionally more sodium moves through the glomerular filter, leading to proportionally more sodium being delivered into the proximal convoluted tubule. Because the rate of sodium resorption remains constant, a greater number of sodium ions are resorbed. Also, because of the increased filtration fraction, local plasma osmotic pressure in the efferent arteriole increases, causing greater resorption of sodium and water.\n\nThe alteration in renal blood flow in heart failure also increases the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, producing more sodium resorption from the distal convoluted tubule. There is also increased water-retaining activity by antidiuretic hormone.\n\nA mechanism within the heart also regulates blood volume, blunting the activity of aldosterone and the renin-angiotensin system. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), with natriuretic and diuretic properties, is present in granules in some of the atrial myocytes. If the atrial pressure is elevated or the atria are distended, ANF is released and causes natriuresis, vasodilation, suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, and decreased arterial blood pressure. In terms of homeostasis, ANF has effects opposite to those of aldosterone, thus providing a balance to fluid regulation. Although plasma ANF is significantly increased in dogs with chronic left AV valvular insufficiency, it is not clear whether the metabolic effects of aldosterone or ANF predominate, but it would appear that the effects of aldosterone over-ride those of ANF.\n\nIt should be noted that none of the hormones mentioned produce the edema of congestive heart failure if administered alone. In addition, once a new steady state has been reached, the hormonal state returns to relatively normal limits. Last, the mechanisms that are brought into play are not exclusive to the syndrome of heart failure. Any situation that leads to a drop in effective circulating blood volume will activate the sodium-and water-retaining mechanism. The fundamental difference between these states and congestive heart failure is that the total blood volume in heart failure is already more than adequate, but the effective blood volume is much diminished because of the poor cardiac output. The volume changes in heart failure should be viewed as an integrated response by the body to compensate for the inability of the heart to respond to the normal hemodynamic needs of the body.\n\nThe expansion of blood volume has both a beneficial and a detrimental effect. By increasing blood volume, venous return is enhanced and, in turn, cardiac output and tissue perfusion are improved. However, this is to the detriment of the balance between capillary hydrostatic pressure and plasma osmotic pressure. This leads to an increase in the amount of fluid in the interstitial spaces and body cavities.\n\nThere is some species difference in the distribution of edema in congestive heart failure. In ruminants and horses, dependent subcutaneous edema is expected; in the other species, excess subcutaneous fluid is scant or absent. In dogs, the predominant accumulation of fluid is in the peritoneal cavity. In cats, it is in the thorax.\n\nGrossly, the liver is enlarged and congested and has a \"nutmeg\" appearance on section because of chronic passive congestion ( Fig. 1-8C) . Microscopically, the sinusoids are dilated, with atrophy of the parenchyma about the central veins. In more severe or acute cases, the parenchyma in this location may undergo degeneration or necrosis. It is exceptional for an animal with congestive failure to live long enough for severe fibrosis and nodularity to occur. Impaired hepatic function is not usually a significant part of the clinical course, although jaundice may be observed.\n\nCongestion of the stomach and intestines is evident, and this may impair their function, which is manifest usually as diarrhea. In horses, the subserosal lymphatics, particularly of the large bowel, are often readily discernible, dilated, and filled with edema fluid. The systemic and portal veins are distended, mucosae by the edema fluid. Cyanosis may be present but is more often the rule in right ventricular failure.\n\nAt postmortem, the lungs are usually of normal color, but may be light brown, and are heavy and wet. Stable, white froth is present in the airways, and fluid exudes from the cut surface. Because of its low protein content, there is little evidence of the abundant fluid on microscopic examination. The alveoli contain erythrocytes and a scattering of macrophages, some of which contain hemosiderin. It may be necessary to use a differential stain for iron to confirm the presence of these so-called \"heart-failure cells\" or siderophages ( Fig. 1-8A , B). They are more numerous in chronic disease, and hemosiderin within their cytoplasm may be sufficient to produce tawny discoloration of the lungs.\n\nIn right-sided heart failure, the major extracardiac manifestations depend on increased hydrostatic pressure in the systemic and portal venous systems, and the reduction of flow from the lungs to the left ventricle. Renal complications occur more frequently in right-sided than in left-sided heart failure, leading to increased blood volume, peripheral edema, and more marked azotemia.

H&E.\n\nA B C useful system is to follow the route of blood flow through the heart, that is, an inflow-outflow method of dissection . This technique may require modification in the case of cardiac anomalies. Examination of the heart in the planes used for echocardiographic examination could be beneficial.\n\n\u2022 The initial examination of the heart and great vessels is best made with the organs in situ to assess abnormalities of size and position. and the spleen is enlarged and congested. However, this latter finding is masked if the animal in question has been euthanized using barbiturates.\n\nIn a gross postmortem examination of the heart, it is important to examine 4 major areas: pericardium, myocardium, mural and valvular endocardium, and the great vessels. A Figure 1- weigh the whole heart, right ventricular free wall, and left ventricular free wall plus septum.\n\n\u2022 The ratio of normal heart weight to body weight (HW : BW) is 0.5-1.0%, depending on age and species (Tables 1-1 , 1-2). \u2022 The HW : BW ratio is higher in neonates than in adults, the more athletic species (horses, dogs) have higher HW : BW ratios, HW : BW ratio is increased by training or exercise, and males typically have greater HW : BW ratios than do females of the same species. \u2022 The ratio of the weight of the left ventricle plus septum divided by the weight of right ventricular free wall [(LV + S)/RV] is 2.8-4.0 in mature animals; (LV + S)/RV >4.0 indicates left ventricular hypertrophy; (LV + S)/RV <2.8 is consistent with right ventricular hypertrophy. The usual tissue block taken for routine histology is of left ventricular papillary muscle, as this area is one of the most susceptible to damage and most representative in cases of generalized disease. Detailed examination of the heart, including the conduction system, requires collection of tissue blocks ( Fig. 1-9B ) from the junction of the cranial vena cava and right auricle (sinus node), both atria, the interatrial septum/dorsum of the ventricular septum at the base of the heart just cranial to the coronary sinus (atrioventricular node), right ventricular free wall and AV valve, ventricular septum, left ventricular \u2022 Incise the pericardial sac and examine the pericardial fluid before the thoracic viscera are removed; note the volume and color of the fluid, the presence of fibrin, and so forth. \u2022 Remove the thoracic viscera and examine the external surfaces of pericardium, epicardium, and great vessels. \u2022 Open the abdominal aorta in situ to the iliac bifurcation and examine for such abnormalities as thrombi and verminous arteritis; remove the aorta with the abdominal viscera in a horse to better examine the cranial mesenteric artery and its branches. \u2022 The heart may be detached from the lungs if anomalies are absent, but it is usually better left attached to allow careful examination of vessels, for instance, pulmonary artery for thrombi. \u2022 Examine the atria, ventricles, and coronary arteries externally, and confirm normal relationships. \u2022 When opening the heart, always inspect structures before cutting, and try to preserve a stenotic or dilated valve or vessel. \u2022 Open the right atrium, from the caudal vena cava to the tip of the auricular appendage. Note any thrombus, and check the right AV valve and the foramen ovale/fossa ovalis. Leave the cranial vena cava unopened, as a block of tissue to include the sinus node may be taken at the junction of the cranial vena cava and the right auricle. Examine the right AV valve before cutting. \u2022 Open the lateral side of the right ventricle adjacent to the ventricular septum. Examine the right AV valve and chordae tendineae. The septal leaflet of the right AV valve is normally thicker than the free leaflets. Transect the moderator band (trabecula septomarginalis). \u2022 Cut through the rostral wall of the right ventricle, and open the pulmonic valve if there is no stenosis. Check the pulmonary arteries for thrombi, especially in animals with indwelling jugular catheters. Note the patency or closure of the ductus arteriosus (bear to the right when opening the pulmonary artery in neonates to avoid cutting through a patent ductus arteriosus and creating a false anomaly). \u2022 Open the left atrium by cutting into the auricular appendage and then parallel to the ventricular groove. Examine the interatrial septum, foramen ovale/fossa ovalis, and the left AV valve. \u2022 Open the left ventricle by cutting longitudinally through the free wall (from base to apex), examining the left AV valve before cutting it. Chordae tendineae should be carefully examined before cutting the left AV valve to ensure that pre-existing ruptures of the chordae are detected. \u2022 Continue to follow the blood flow by cutting through the left ventricular outflow tract and into the aorta. Note that the pulmonary artery will be transected by this action. \u2022 The circumference of the 4 cardiac valves may be measured at this time with a flexible ruler or string. Normal right AV/left AV valve circumference ratio for dogs is 2:1. The right ventricle is responsible for systemic circulation in the fetus. Hence, in neonatal hearts, the wall thickness of the left and right ventricles is approximately equal; it is not until a month or more after birth that the mature proportions are attained. Ventricular wall thickness is poorly correlated with ventricular mass, and heart weights provide more valid information about ventricular hypertrophy than do thickness measurements, especially in cases of dilation and eccentric hypertrophy. To accurately assess cardiac mass, the heart should be weighed and the weight compared to body weight. After removing the pericardial sac and postmortem blood clots, \n\nIn the transition from fetal to neonatal life, substantial adjustments occur within the cardiovascular system. There are alterations in the pressures in cardiac chambers and great vessels, the pattern of blood flow, and the volume of blood flow. Because of these changes, the retention postnatally of fetal vascular communications, such as the ductus arteriosus, may place an excessive load on the heart in the postnatal period and beyond. There are also congenital heart defects, such as pulmonic stenosis, which compromise the fetus, the newborn, and the adult. It is typically only those defects that allow adequate in utero development and a reasonably successful perinatal life that are recognized; anomalies sufficiently severe to cause death in utero, or in the neonatal period, often are not. As with most diseases, there is a spectrum of change. The variation in severity of a particular lesion may be wide and will necessarily influence whether clinical signs are observed. As such, there is a higher incidence of congenital heart disease than is recognized clinically. There is also a group of congenital heart diseases that do not produce clinical signs of heart failure, but which are manifested by upper alimentary dysfunction. Although little is known of the causes of many cardiac malformations in domestic mammals, there is no doubt that, especially in dogs, some are genetically determined. The demonstration that some congenital heart diseases are genetically determined arose from the observation that the incidence of defects was higher in purebred populations. It has been thought that both patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and conotruncal defects have a polygenic inheritance pattern, where the full expression of these diseases depends on the inheritance of a number of genes from different loci. However, studies on Keeshonds with conotruncal defects indicate that the inheritance pattern is most compatible with a single autosomal locus. The data suggest the presence of a mutant allele that is partially penetrant in heterozygotes and fully penetrant in homozygotes. Congenital subaortic stenosis in the Newfoundland dog is also genetically determined; it may either be polygenic or a single dominant gene that is variably expressed. Table 1 -3 outlines the breed-specific predisposition to congenital heart disease in the dog. free wall/papillary muscle and AV valve, great vessels, plus any grossly evident lesions.\n\nThe selection of sections to study the specialized conduction system should include the sinus node, the AV node, the common bundle (bundle of His), left and right crura (bundle branches), and conducting fibers. The sinus node lies subepicardially in the terminal groove (sulcus terminalis) at the junction of the cranial vena cava and the right atrium. Sections should include either side of that site, to incorporate tissue in the sulcus terminalis region. The AV node is obtained by removing a block of tissue from the coronary sinus to the cranial edge of the septal leaflet of the right AV valve. The block includes interatrial septum and dorsal ventricular septum, and will then contain the AV node, which is located subendocardially on the right side of the interatrial septum, the common bundle, and the left and right crura. The specimen should be serially sectioned into samples 3 mm thick, and all samples should be processed.\n\nIn routine cases, there are no special requirements for fixation. Stains of particular use are hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin, Luxol fast blue, and Gomori aldehyde fuchsin.\n\nNote that rigor mortis begins earlier in myocardial than in skeletal musculature, and reaches greater development in the more powerful left ventricle. Rigor should completely express the blood from the left ventricle; rigor of the right ventricle is less efficient, and emptying is incomplete. The presence of some clotted blood in the right ventricle is normal, whereas if present in the left ventricle, it is indicative of incomplete rigor and therefore perhaps of severe myocardial degeneration. The presence of unclotted blood in the left ventricle some hours after death is more difficult to interpret. Unclotted blood, the result of fibrinolysis, may flow back into the ventricle when rigor passes.\n\nBlood usually clots slowly after death and permits erythrocytes to sediment. Where blood is present in volume, as in the heart and arterial trunks, sedimentation and subsequent clotting leads to the formation of \"currant jelly\" and \"chicken fat\" clots, the former containing erythrocytes, and the latter largely devoid of them. Chicken fat clots are to be expected in horses, which normally have a rapid erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and are in relative excess in anemia. Postmortem clots are to be distinguished from thrombi; clots are not attached to the endocardium.\n\nBiopsy of the heart in not commonly undertaken in vivo, but is possible via transvenous endomyocardial biopsy. Multiple biopsy samples of the right ventricular myocardium may be obtained by this means, and may be used, for example, to monitor the cardiotoxic effects of anthracycline therapy. \n\nFurther reading Adams JW, et In humans, increasing attention has been focused on mutations in transcription modulators, signal transduction, and structural protein genes as causes of inherited congenital heart disease. This includes the transcription factors Nkx2-5, GATA4, and TBX-5, and the NOTCH pathway genes JAGGED1, NOTCH1, and NOTCH2. The NOTCH pathway genes have been associated with valvular defects and tetralogy of Fallot. Further insights into the normal and abnormal development of the heart and great vessels have come from the effects of targeted gene mutations and deletions using the zebrafish, Danio rerio, as an experimental model.\n\nThere may be other as yet undefined factors that contribute to the development of congenital heart disease in domestic animals. In humans, cardiac and vascular anomalies are common features of several syndromes produced by chromosomal abnormalities and viral infections such as rubella. There is little evidence to suggest the presence of similar abnormalities or infections associated with congenital heart disease in domestic animals.\n\nThe pattern and incidence of congenital cardiac disease varies with the species examined. In dogs, PDA, pulmonic stenosis, and subaortic stenosis are common (Table 1-4 ). In cattle, atrial and ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and transpositions of the main vessels are most frequently diagnosed. Subaortic stenosis and endocardial cushion defects are the most frequent anomalies in pigs. In cats, endocardial cushion defects and congenital left AV valve insufficiency appear to be common. Congenital cardiovascular disease is quite uncommon in horses.\n\nIn cases of suspected cardiac abnormality, it is essential to examine the heart and large vessels in situ because relations are difficult to trace once the organ is removed. Some animals are born with hearts that, although of normal arrangement, are very small. In the majority of cases of cardiac abnormality, the anomaly is reflected in gross enlargement of the organ and in alteration of the size or disposition of the large vessels. Cardiac malformations are extremely variable, and their analysis can be perplexing if it is not remembered that they do\n\nThe consequence of an ASD in the neonate is excessive flow from the left to right atrium, with resultant volume overload on the right ventricle and elevated central venous pressure (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . In some cases, following the development of pulmonary hypertension, the flow through the defect is reversed, leading to cyanosis. follow fairly simple basic patterns. The recognition of the primary abnormality is an essential first step. This then assists in the recognition of secondary abnormalities, which develop as adjustments to allow blood to circulate through the heart. An understanding of the mechanics of abnormal development is necessarily based on an understanding of the normal development of the organ, for which reference should be made to a standard text of embryology.\n\nThere is no completely satisfactory system for classifying congenital heart defects, as they may be complex or may overlap as part of a spectrum. Based on a combination of anatomic defects and functional effects, they may be classified as In the development of the heart, there are 3 major arteriovenous communications: between the atria, the ventricles, and the great vessels. These connections are necessary for shunting of blood in the fetus. The atrial and ventricular septa close in utero; the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus close early in the neonatal period. Failure of closure results in atrial septal defect (ASD), VSD, or PDA, 3 of the more common congenital cardiac defects in domestic animals. Less common defects in this group include AV septal defect, persistent truncus arteriosus, aorticopulmonary window, and anomalous pulmonary venous return.\n\nIn the fetus, separation of the left and right atria commences with the downgrowth of the septum primum, which grows toward the AV junction, where the developing endocardial cushions begin to form the AV valves and separate the ventricles. The septum fuses with the endocardial cushions, obliterating the ostium primum, and then begins to fenestrate in its middle. The fenestration is destined to become the ostium secundum. A second septum (septum secundum) develops downward and to the right of the septum primum. With its semilunar edge, the septum secundum and the remains of the septum primum form the foramen ovale. Within the left atrium, the septum primum forms the flap valve of the foramen ovale that allows blood flow from right atrium to left atrium in the fetus. In the majority of animals, anatomic closure of the foramen ovale follows functional closure postnatally. A probe-patent foramen ovale postnatally is not an ASD, for although the foramen ovale may not be anatomically closed, it is functionally closed (valvular competent) because left atrial pressure exceeds right atrial pressure.\n\nAn ASD can result from \u2022 Defects of the septum between the right upper pulmonary veins and the cranial vena cava (sinus venosus defect) \u2022 Failure of fusion of septum primum with the endocardial cushions (ostium primum defect, low in the atrial septum adjacent to the AV valves, a form of AV septal defect) \u2022 An excessively large ostium secundum or inadequate development of the septum secundum (ostium secundum defect, in mid-septum at the site of the fossa ovalis, the most common type)\n\nAlso known as endocardial cushion defects or AV canal defects, these malformations arise from deficiency of the AV septum that separates the left ventricular inlet from the right atrium. The atrial septum primum must fuse with the endocardial cushions, which in turn contribute to the development of the atrial and ventricular septa, and to the medial leaflets of the left and right AV valves. Anomalous development may result in a range of anatomic defects, including ostium primum defect (partial AV canal), VSD with a cleft in the right AV valve, or common AV canal. The common or complete AV septal defect consists of an ostium primum defect, a VSD, and a common AV orifice. Defects of the AV canal are among the most common defects in the pig. In the largest series examined, 40% of pigs with congenital heart disease had this defect. It is also a frequent finding in cats.\n\nVentricular septal defect is one of the most common defects encountered in domestic animals. The separation of the left and right ventricles is completed by 3 parts of the embryonic heart: the muscular portion of the septum, the downward growth of the conotruncal ridges, and the membranous portion of the septum derived from the endocardial cushions. Defects can be related to defective development of any of the 3 parts. VSDs are usually single but may be multiple, and most commonly involve the membranous septum ( Fig. 1-12A ). This type of VSD is termed paramembranous or perimembranous, as they exceed the bounds of the membranous septum and involve a muscular defect at their periphery; they may also be referred to as subaortic or infracristal. Less common sites of VSD are subpulmonary (infundibular, conal, supracristal), below the septal leaflet of the right AV valve, or in the muscular portion of the ventricular septum toward the apex of the heart (Fig. \n\n1-12B). Although occurring most commonly as an isolated defect, VSD is also seen as part of a number of other defects, such as tetralogy of Fallot or persistent truncus arteriosus. There appears to be a high incidence of spontaneous postnatal closure of small VSDs in humans, and a similar phenomenon has been reported in dogs. The presence of a VSD has no deleterious effect on the fetus because left and right ventricular pressures are equal, and there is therefore little flow across the defect. Postnatally, the effects of VSDs are related to the size of the defect and the level of pulmonic vascular resistance relative to the systemic resistance. Pulmonary vascular resistance normally drops postnatally, leading to a left-to-right shunt. Left ventricular output is maintained by an increase in end-diastolic volume and augmentation of contractility by the Frank-Starling mechanism. Because right ventricular pressure equals left ventricular pressure, the right ventricle is confronted with a large systolic and diastolic load. Both ventricles undergo hypertrophy, the left being more obviously eccentric in nature ( Fig. 1-13) .\n\nEventually, pulmonary hypertension can lead to shunt reversal (right-to-left), cyanosis, and death. The term Eisenmenger complex is applied to VSD cases in which, instead of the usual left-to-right shunt, flow has been reversed to a right-to-left shunt through the VSD as a consequence of severe pulmonary hypertension that is, in turn, due to high pulmonary vascular resistance. The more general term of Eisenmenger syndrome is applied to any anomalous circulatory communication (e.g., ASD, VSD, PDA) that leads to obliterative pulmonary vascular disease, with resulting reversal of the left-to-right shunt across the pulmonarysystemic communication.\n\nPatent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is one of the more common defects, and it is recorded in all species (Fig. 1-14) . In the dog it has a polygenic inheritance pattern, and PDA may result from hypoplasia or asymmetry of ductal smooth muscle plus aorta-like elastic tissue in the ductus wall. The ductus develops from the sixth left branchial arch, and functions in the fetus to divert a major portion of blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. The flow from venous to arterial side is a consequence of the presence of the high vascular resistance of the fetal pulmonary bed. The structure of the normal ductus differs from the adjacent pulmonary artery or aorta. In contrast to the large elastic arteries, the media of the ductus has a dense layer of smooth muscle, which is responsive to a number of compounds. Among the most powerful are epinephrine, norepinephrine, and angiotensin; less effective ones include oxygen, acetylcholine, bradykinin, and indomethacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor. Prostaglandin E 2 keeps the ductus in a dilated state. Of the compounds mentioned, oxygen and acetylcholine are probably the most important in vivo in causing constriction.\n\nWith contraction of the medial smooth muscle, the ductus becomes functionally closed in the first few hours after birth. There are exceptions. The ductus in some foals may remain patent for up to 5 days, and a continuous murmur is detectable up to that time. A ductus arteriosus that remains patent beyond this time is considered to be abnormal. They are minimally responsive, or nonresponsive, to oxygen and other compounds that constrict the normal ductus.\n\nContinued patency results in a number of sequelae that are dependent on the size of the PDA and the relationship between the pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance. In uncomplicated cases, the blood flow is from the aorta to the pulmonary artery (left-to-right shunt) during both systole and diastole. Depending upon the ensuing rise of pulmonary arterial pressure, there may be left-to-right flow only during systole. In severe cases, the shunt is reversed and flow from the pulmonary artery to the aorta (right-to-left shunt) occurs. If the ductus is of sufficient size, there is volume overload of the left ventricle and pressure overload of the right ventricle, resulting in compensatory hypertrophy of both ventricles. There is also left atrial dilation resulting from increased pulmonary blood flow ( Fig. 1-15 ). The ascending aorta and pulmonary artery are dilated, probably resulting from a combination of turbulent flow and altered pressure relationships. The development of congestive heart failure with a large PDA is not only related to pulmonary vascular resistance, but also to the ability of the left ventricle to handle volume overload. In dogs where aorticopulmonary shunts were created experimentally, a communication of 3 mm or less in diameter may lead to the slow development of left ventricular hypertrophy, but it is otherwise well tolerated. A window of 5 mm in diameter may lead to pulmonary hypertension, with degenerative changes in pulmonary vessels and congestive heart failure.\n\nAs a consequence of turbulent flow, a PDA is predisposed to thrombosis, which is referred to as endocarditis of the ductus. The anatomic appearance of the PDA ranges from a ductus diverticulum, which is a blind funnel-shaped outpouching of the aorta at the site of the ductus, to a ductus that approaches the diameter of the aorta. The length of the patent ductus may also vary. In some cases, there is virtually no ductus, but, instead, an opening between the aorta and pulmonary artery, which are closely approximated. Hypoplasia and asymmetry of ductus-specific smooth muscle and the presence of aorta-like elastic tissue in the ductus wall, as has been observed in some cases, may cause patency. In dogs, as the number of genes that determine its presence increases, the histologic appearance of the PDA more closely resembles the aorta, and the clinical severity of the defect increases.\n\nFailure of adequate development of the semilunar valves usually results in valvular or subvalvular stenosis. Anomalous AV valves may be insufficient or stenotic or both.\n\nPulmonic stenosis is a relatively common congenital anomaly in dogs, but an unusual finding in other domestic species. It is inherited in Beagles, and is suspected to be so in English Bulldogs, Bull Mastiffs, Chihuahuas, and terrier types. The term pulmonic stenosis encompasses 3 anatomic variations: supravalvular, valvular, and subvalvular or infundibular stenosis. Valvular stenosis, the most common form in dogs, is probably due to disordered fusion of the valve cushions and their failure to hollow out properly. The valve, which is then more or less dome shaped with an irregular central perforation, is surrounded by 3 recognizable sinuses of Valsalva that are small and irregular in form ( Fig. 1-16) . Subvalvular or infundibular stenosis is produced by a ring of connective tissue that encircles the upper portion of the outflow tract of the right ventricle, or by hypertrophy of the crista supraventricularis muscle ridge. With each form, the pulmonary trunk is dilated and thin walled. This is probably due to a combination of turbulent flow and a drop in pressure, creating a venturi effect in the pulmonary artery. Concentric right ventricular hypertrophy is always present because of the increased afterload placed on the right ventricle ( Fig. 1-17) .\n\nIn English Bulldogs, the breed most commonly affected by pulmonic stenosis, the stenosis is frequently caused by a circumpulmonary left coronary artery that originates from a single right coronary artery. The cause of this syndrome appears to be malformation of the left aortic sinus of Valsalva and inversion of the proximal segment of the left main coronary artery.\n\ndextroposed aorta does not depend on the degree of overriding, but on the severity of the pulmonic stenosis ( Fig. 1-19 ).\n\nIsolated congenital aortic valvular stenosis is distinctly uncommon. Subvalvular aortic (subaortic) stenosis is, in contrast, a common defect in pigs and often occurs in conjunction with what has been termed endocardiosis of the left AV valve. In one study of 321 pigs that had left AV valvular abnormalities (endocardiosis), 258 had accompanying subaortic stenosis. Subaortic stenosis is among the more frequently encountered anomalies in dogs, and often occurs in association with left AV valvular disease. Dog breeds commonly affected include the German Shepherd dog, Weimaraner, Golden Retriever, German Shorthaired Pointer, Saint Bernard, Newfoundland, Dogue de Bordeaux, and English Bull Terrier.\n\nThe anatomic appearance of the subvalvular lesion ranges from a number of small fibrous plaques on the endocardial surface of the left ventricular outflow tract on the interventricular septal aspect, to a completely encircling fibrous band\n\nThe primary lesion in tetralogy of Fallot is obstruction to right ventricular outflow, either through pulmonic stenosis or infundibular stenosis that results from abnormal conotruncal partitioning. The other lesions in the tetrad are ventricular septal defect (VSD), overriding aorta, and secondary right ventricular hypertrophy ( Fig. 1-18A -C) . Tetralogy is one of the congenital heart diseases that invariably results in clinical signs. Affected animals fatigue easily and are usually cyanotic and polycythemic. The latter is a response to hypoxia. Growth rate is usually retarded. At least in Keeshonds, the condition is inherited as a defect at a single autosomal locus, in which there is partial penetrance in heterozygotes and complete penetrance in homozygotes. Analysis of affected Keeshonds has revealed various grades of malformation. The spectrum of anomalies included subclinical defects of the crista supraventricularis, VSD, pulmonic stenosis with abnormal nonpatent interventricular septum, and tetralogy of Fallot. Closure of the interventricular septum is contributed to by the conotruncal septum. The flow of blood from the right ventricle into the As with pulmonary outflow tract obstruction, increased afterload on the left ventricle and turbulent poststenotic flow produce compensatory concentric hypertrophy of the involved ventricle and poststenotic dilation of the aorta ( Fig. 1-21) . Intimal proliferation of collagen and deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the intramural coronary arteries is common. This may well explain the presence of multifocal myocardial necrosis and fibrosis, and the relatively common clinical finding of sudden death, presumably resulting from the generation of ventricular dysrhythmias following myocardial necrosis.\n\nThe heritability of this anomaly in dogs is either polygenic or involves a major dominant gene with modifiers. There is some question as to whether it is a true congenital lesion. In one experimental study, no dog exhibited the typical lesion before 25 days of age. There is also some evidence that the severity of the condition increases with age.\n\nDysplasia of the right AV valve appears to be one of the more common defects observed in the cat, but is uncommon in other domestic species. Affected dog breeds include Dogue de Bordeaux and Labrador Retriever. The anatomic characteristics of right AV dysplasia are focal or diffuse thickening of the leaflets, some of which may be absent, or short chordae tendineae and papillary muscles, and direct fusion of portions of just below the aortic valve ( Fig. 1-20) . There may also be involvement of the aortic valve. The subendocardial thickenings are composed of connective tissue in irregular arrangements, intermixed with abundant mucinous ground substance. The change is sometimes fibrocartilaginous in nature. Where there is an accompanying left AV valvular defect, it is composed of a thickened, ridged, and larger cranial leaflet, which process, termed valvular telangiectasis in the septal cusp of the right AV valve in Beagles, has been reported to progress from telangiectasis through scarring and osseous metaplasia. Primary endocardial fibroelastosis is characterized by diffuse endocardial thickening by collagen and elastic fibers, and left ventricular hypertrophy and dilation in the absence of any associated cardiac malformation. The fact that diffuse endocardial thickening occurs when any chamber of the heart remains dilated for a prolonged period has probably led to the confusion that exists about endocardial fibroelastosis. There have been reports in the literature describing the existence of this condition in a number of species, but the primary disease has only been well documented in cats and, to a lesser extent, dogs. The disease in affected Burmese kittens commences with localized endocardial lymphedema. This is detectable microscopically, but not grossly, at 1 day of age. Progressive deposition of endocardial collagen and elastin follows and allows macroscopic detection from 20 days of age. The left atrium is dilated, and the left ventricle is hypertrophied and dilated. The endocardial fibrosis progressively involves cardiac conducting fibers, which exhibit some degenerative change.\n\nAlthough not definitely established, there appears to be little doubt of the inherited nature of the disease.\n\nFalse tendons are thin, often branching, structures that traverse the cavity of the left ventricle and are not connected to the valve cusps; they are common in domestic mammals. They are composed of cardiac muscle, blood vessels, fibrous tissue, and Purkinje cells. False tendons are of debatable significance, but may play a role in innocent murmurs and cardiac dysrhythmia.\n\nCor triatriatum (triple atria) is a rare lesion in cats and dogs resulting from failure of incorporation of the common pulmonary vein into the left atrium. A membrane separates the left atrium into 2 compartments, which can impede pulmonary drainage and lead to pulmonary edema. Cor triatriatum dexter (right atrium) can cause ascites.\n\nEpithelial inclusions are found occasionally in ventricular myocardium in well-defined areas of discoloration or sponginess. The inclusions are present as acinar or ductular structures lined by a simple layer of cuboidal epithelial cells on a basement membrane. The inclusions are possibly of endodermal origin from the foregut and represent displacements arising very early in embryogenesis, when the heart rudiment is adjacent to the developing foregut.\n\nMyocardial bridges are anatomic variants that are superficial myocardial bands that run across short segments of a coronary artery located epicardially in the dog, cat, goat, sheep, and human. The bridges appear to be of little functional significance.\n\nCongenital absence of the pericardium occurs in dogs. Affected animals are usually asymptomatic.\n\nDouble-chambered right ventricle is a rare cardiac anomaly in cats and dogs.\n\nVariations in the position of the heart are not cardiac malformations but, instead, malformations of adjacent structures: \u2022 In ectopia cordis, the heart may lie in extrathoracic, presternal, or intra-abdominal positions ( Fig. 1-22) . Dislocations within the thorax are the result of asymmetrical pressure, as for example, in congenital diaphragmatic hernia or pleural effusion. \u2022 In peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia, which occurs in dogs and cats, intestine and/or liver are present in the pericardial sac.\n\nthe affected valve with the ventricular wall. In right AV dysplasia, the valve is insufficient, the right atrium is enlarged, and the right ventricle is eccentrically hypertrophied. The anomaly may be associated with malformation of the left AV valve complex or VSD. In Ebstein's anomaly of the right AV valve, there is downward displacement of the basal portions of the valve into the right ventricle. The morphologically similar canine right AV valve malformation has been mapped to a susceptibility locus on chromosome 9 in several kindreds of purebred Labrador Retriever dogs. Right AV atresia-absence of the right AV orifice-is accompanied by an interatrial communication, right ventricular hypoplasia, and usually a VSD.\n\nA mixed-frequency holosystolic murmur, with its point of maximum intensity on the left caudal sternal border, is indicative of left AV valve insufficiency. Commonly heard in old dogs with endocardiosis, it may also be associated with moderate to severe left-sided failure in young dogs and cats. Malformation of the left AV valve complex is probably the most common congenital cardiac anomaly in the cat. The lesion has a relatively wide spectrum of severity, and may result in either an insufficient or a stenotic valve. Anatomically, there is an enlarged annulus, short thick leaflets, short thickened chordae tendineae, upward malposition of atrophic or hypertrophic papillary muscles, and enlargement of the left atrium and ventricle. There is also diffuse endocardial fibrosis. In dogs, the lesion has been most commonly seen in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Great Danes, English Bull Terriers, and, to a lesser extent, German Shepherd dogs.\n\nSome of the more severe cardiac anomalies are a combination of defects of the aorta and pulmonary artery. Malposition or transposition of arterial trunks is a condition in which the aorta lies in relation to the pulmonary artery such that it receives blood from the right ventricle, the basic defect being dextroposition of the aorta. There are 4 degrees, or types, of this anomaly:\n\n\u2022 Overriding aorta-(the most common type), the aorta straddles the interventricular septum, which is defective, and receives blood from both ventricles, and the pulmonary artery leaves the right ventricle; \u2022 Partial transposition-both vessels leave the right ventricle;\n\n\u2022 Overriding pulmonary artery-the pulmonary artery straddles a defective ventricular septum and the aorta emerges from the right ventricle; \u2022 Complete transposition-the aorta emerges from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery emerges from the left (eFig. 1-5). It is usual in these transposition complexes for either the pulmonary artery or the aorta to be hypoplastic.\n\nCongenital hematomas (hemocysts) on the margins of the AV valves are common, especially in calves, but appear to be of little consequence. These are usually blood-filled cysts lined by endothelium; they originate in the clefts normally present in the substance of the valves in intrauterine life. The cysts may measure up to 1.0 cm in diameter and be multiple. There is some question as to whether the cysts involute within a few months of birth, or whether they persist for a year or more, by which time the content is changed to serous fluid. A similar 22.e1 eFigure 1-5 Complete transposition of aorta and pulmonary artery in a foal. Coronary arteries arise from a common trunk (arrowhead).\n\nfrom the ascending aorta. The right arch, which is usually the larger of the 2, follows the course given above. It is joined above the esophagus by the small left arch. The significant end result is constriction of the esophagus. Aorticopulmonary septal defect, or window, is a rare defect in dogs that results from incomplete division of the truncus arteriosus. Pulmonary hypertension develops, leading to rightto-left shunting of blood.\n\nCoarctation of the aorta is another rare defect in dogs, and is seen as narrowing of the aorta adjacent to the ductus arteriosus/ligamentum arteriosum. Left ventricular pressure overload can result in left heart failure. Additional malformations of the aorta reported in dogs include interruption of the aorta and tubular hypoplasia of the ascending aorta ( Fig. 1-24) .\n\nCongenital aneurysm of the aorta or of the pulmonary artery, involves, for either vessel, the trunk and arch, but may not extend beyond the insertion of the ligamentum arteriosum. Aortic aneurysm may be associated with aneurysm of one or more of the aortic sinuses of Valsalva.\n\n\u2022 Dextrocardia is a rare condition in dogs in which the apex of the heart, which normally points to the left (levocardia), points to the right. Dextrocardia may be part of situs inversus, in which the heart and other internal organs are transposed in a mirror-image fashion. Kartagener's syndrome, a rare condition in dogs, includes dextrocardia, sinusitis, and bronchiectasis, the last 2 features as a result of ciliary dyskinesia.\n\nPersistence of the right aortic arch is a well-known anomaly in dogs and has been observed in cattle. It is due to persistence of the right fourth aortic arch instead of, as is normal, the left fourth aortic arch. A right aorta descends to the right of the midline, arches over the origin of the right bronchus, and descends either to the left or right of the vertebral column.\n\nWith the aorta in this position, the ductus arteriosus (ligamentum arteriosum), passing from the aorta to the pulmonary artery, encloses the esophagus and compresses it against the trachea. Obstruction of the esophagus at this point leads to dysphagia and, shortly, to dilation of the cervical portion of the esophagus ( Fig. 1-23) . A double aortic arch is a variation of the foregoing in which the left arch persists as well as the right. Both arches arise the base of the heart and in the cranial mediastinum are rather common causes of hydropericardium. Hydropericardium may also accompany congenital and acquired peritoneopericardial hernias and uremia. Infectious processes of the pleura, especially granulomatous inflammations, may cause irritation of the pericardium sufficient to provoke a sterile serous effusion; the infection may eventually extend to the pericardial sac. If drainage of the thoracic duct is disrupted, for example, by a cardiac neoplasm, then the fluid may be chylous (chylopericardium).\n\nIn hydropericardium, the serosal surfaces remain smooth and glistening, but if the fluid persists for a long time, it may produce slight fibrous thickening and opacity of the pericardial and epicardial surfaces. It is usually about the base of the ventricles, and small villus proliferations of the serosa may rupture and result in a bloodstained effusion. Neoplastic involvement of the pericardium characteristically has this result.\n\nThe pericardial fluid is clear or light yellow, without floccules, and with low content of protein. Fluid rich in protein, including fibrinogen, is often found in acute toxemias of clostridial (gas gangrene group) origin. Clotting occurs soon after exposure to air. In such cases, exudation is due to direct injury to the endothelium by circulating toxins. Fluid that is copious and gels on exposure also is characteristic of African horse sickness and of heartwater. In pigs with edema disease or mulberry heart disease, fibrin is often formed antemortem. The presence of protein, especially fibrin, in pericardial fluid is only an index of the degree of endothelial injury and increased permeability and is not a precise point of distinction between an exudate and a transudate. Inflammatory exudates can be differentiated from transudates on the basis of the higher content of protein and cells in exudates and histologic evidence of inflammation involving the pericardium and epicardium.\n\nThe volume of fluid that accumulates is quite variable and of lesser significance than the rate at which it accumulates. When fluid accumulates rapidly, the pericardium is put under tension, the heart is compressed, and venous blood pools in the splanchnic and systemic circulations because of impaired atrial and ventricular filling (cardiac tamponade). When the fluid accumulates slowly, there is time for stretching and adaptation of the pericardium so that very large amounts of fluid\n\nPrimary disease confined to the pericardium is rare, but the close anatomic relationship of the pericardium to the heart, lungs, and pleura sometimes results in the extension of disease processes from the latter organs to the pericardium. It is also often a site for the location of infectious agents as part of systemic infections, particularly in the neonate. Somewhat paradoxically, the pericardium is not needed for normal life, but pericardial disease can be life threatening. The pericardial sac may be removed surgically for relief of pericardial constriction.\n\nThe pericardial cavity may communicate with the peritoneal cavity through clefts in the diaphragm; hence herniated intestine may be found surrounding the heart as a result of congenital peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia. Partial or complete congenital absence of the pericardial sac is without clinical effect. Pericardial cysts are rare congenital anomalies that occur in one of the costophrenic angles.\n\nEpicardial fibrous fronds occur on the atria of Beagle dogs as an occasional incidental finding at postmortem.\n\nThe pericardial sac normally contains a very small quantity of clear, serous fluid. Any excess in the volume of clear fluid is referred to as hydropericardium. A small increase in volume occurs by transudation after death, and it is soon reddened by postmortem hemolysis.\n\nHydropericardium is often part of generalized anasarca and is thus seen in many cachectic illnesses, perhaps as the result of hypoalbuminemia, and in congestive heart failure ( Fig. 1-25) . It may also be the product of local events such as implanted metastases of neoplasms on the pericardium, and lymphomatous infiltrations of the myocardium; primary tumors about \n\nIt is seldom possible by examination of the lesion itself to decide the cause of pericardial inflammation, although a decision on the cause is often possible when the total pathologic picture in the cadaver is noted. For this reason and for descriptive purposes, we use a morphologic classification of pericarditis.\n\nFibrinous pericarditis is usually the result of hematogenous microbial infections, but it may arise by lymphatic permeation from an inflammatory process in adjacent tissue. In cattle, fibrinous pericarditis, with or without some hemorrhage, is commonly part of pasteurellosis, blackleg, sporadic bovine encephalomyelitis, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, clostridial hemoglobinuria, and some of the neonatal coliform infections that enter via the umbilicus. In swine, it is frequently part of the morbid picture of Glasser's disease and pasteurellosis, is a common complication of porcine enzootic can accumulate before there is significant impairment of diastolic filling of the heart.\n\nThe term hemopericardium is limited to accumulations of pure blood in the pericardial cavity, and should not apply to mixtures of blood and serous fluid. If the blood is clotted, it can be assumed that the process is a true hemopericardium. Death usually supervenes rapidly. It is an unusual lesion, except following cardiac rupture, puncture or other direct trauma. It is seen in horses in which rupture of the intrapericardial aorta or atria occurs. In dogs, hemopericardium occurs in atrial rupture in endocardiosis, hemorrhage from atrial hemangiosarcoma, in ulcerative atrial endocarditis of renal failure, and rarely, following rupture of a coronary artery or from hemorrhage from a heart base thymic remnant ( Fig. 1-26 ). In young, growing swine, rupture of the heart, particularly of an atrium, a coronary artery, or the aorta occurs on rare occasions. These deaths have not been examined specifically with deficiency of copper in mind, but attention is drawn to the remarkable cardiovascular lesions of experimental deficiency, which is discussed with diseases of the arteries.\n\nIdiopathic pericardial hemorrhagic effusion occurs predominantly in large-breed dogs, and is characterized by the presence of both clotted and unclotted blood in the pericardial sac without obvious cause. The clinical presentation is that of slowly developing right-sided heart failure, with some having accompanying left-sided heart failure. The heart sounds are muffled or inaudible on initial presentation, with no evidence of dysrhythmias. However, some subsequently develop atrial fibrillation. The clinical course can be prolonged. The slow onset of clinical signs suggests either slow or intermittent bleeding, allowing distension without tamponade. Indeed, some dogs may make a full clinical recovery following aspiration of the pericardial fluid.\n\nIn cachexia of any cause, and paralleling fairly closely the reduction in body weight, there is progressive mobilization of depot fat, including that beneath the epicardium. As the lipid vacuoles are reduced in size, they are replaced by proteinaceous fluid, and with a concomitant increase in interstitial organization and scarring will result in focal or diffuse fibrous adhesions between the pericardial surfaces, with partial or complete obliteration of the sac.\n\nThe residual lesions of fibrinous pericarditis occur as more or less distinct variants. Focal, patchy thickenings of the epicardium without adhesions form minimal residue and are usually more distinct on the ventricles than on the atria, where they may be obscured by normal fat. The original scar tissue may undergo fatty metaplasia or be edematous. (The same lesion also occurs covering healed foci of superficial myocarditis.) Focal or diffuse adhesive pericarditis varies in extent from a few \"violin strings\" across the sac to complete obliteration of the sac. Inclusion cysts lined by mesothelium are often present in fibrous adhesions, and there tends to be excess fluid present in non-obliterated portions of the sac. The pericardium is separable from the epicardium by blunt dissection. As the connective tissue is not dense, there is usually no embarrassment of cardiac function.\n\nPurulent pericarditis almost invariably denotes the presence of pyogenic bacteria, either as primary pathogens or as opportunists in fibrinous pericarditis. It occurs almost solely in cattle as a result of traumatic perforation by a foreign body originating in the reticulum, but it is observed in cats and horses in association with empyema (pyothorax). Migrating grass awns (\"foxtail,\" Hordeum glaucum, and H. leparinum) have been identified as causes of suppurative pericarditis in dogs in the western United States.\n\nThe suppurative pericardial fluid may appear as thin, cloudy exudate; as frank, creamy pus; or as a mixture of pus and masses of fibrin. The color depends on the organisms present, but usually varies from yellow to green, being irregularly dirty gray when putrefactive bacteria are present. The exudate is usually foul smelling. The volume of exudate varies from a thin layer on the serosal surface to 4 L or more. In the early stages, it can be wiped or washed off to reveal the vascular injection and granularity of the membranes. Soon, the whole of the epicardium is covered with coagulum; the parietal layer of the pericardium is less severely affected, and separation of the 2 reveals a shaggy appearance of the heart (cor villosum).\n\nMicroscopically, the subjacent tissues are densely infiltrated with leukocytes, the reaction extending more deeply than in fibrinous pericarditis, the formation of new blood vessels and connective tissue is prominent, and the overlying coagulated exudate is densely infiltrated with leukocytes.\n\nResolution probably never occurs. Because of the severity of the inflammatory reaction, healing is by organization, as is characteristic of all suppurative inflammations. Although the course of suppurative pericarditis may be prolonged, the persistence of the inciting agent, or more usually agents, prevents complete organization.\n\nConstrictive pericarditis resulting from progressive organization can be so severe and diffuse that it leads to impaired diastolic filling and the development of right-sided heart failure ( Fig. 1-29) . The adhesions cannot be broken down by blunt dissection and may be mineralized. They obliterate the pericardial cavity, but they may also extend beyond it to involve the mediastinum. The heart, which is confined by scar tissue, may be smaller than normal, or it may be greatly enlarged and hypertrophic, especially when there are also extrapericardial adhesions present. There is always severe cardiac dysfunction, and death occurs from congestive heart failure.\n\npneumonia (infection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and other agents), and is occasionally observed in salmonellosis and in streptococcal infection of piglets. Fibrinous pericarditis in adult sheep is usually part of pasteurellosis; in lambs, it is usually part of pasteurellosis or caused by streptococci. In horses, Mycoplasma felis causes pericarditis and pleuritis; streptococcal pericarditis may coexist with polyarthritis. Fibrinous pericarditis in horses may also be associated with the mare reproductive loss syndrome. Pericarditis is rare in cats, but it is seen as part of feline infectious peritonitis.\n\nIn fibrinous pericarditis, there is seldom significant exudation of fluid, so distension of the pericardial sac is not to be expected. The exudation of fibrin usually begins about the base of the heart and extends from there to cover, more or less completely, both the pericardium and epicardium. The fibrin is gray-white, but it may be flecked with blood, or yellow if a large number of leukocytes are added to the exudate. Except for small pools of serum or serous exudate, the pericardium and epicardium are in apposition. When the leaves are drawn apart, the exudate is drawn out into villuslike projections to give an appearance responsible for the names \"cor villosum,\" \"shaggy heart,\" and \"bread-and-butter pericarditis\" (Fig. 1-28) .\n\nThe completeness of resolution depends upon how quickly the fibrinous exudate can be removed, which is a function of the amount of fibrin, and how quickly the mesothelium can be regenerated, which is a function of the amount of mesothelium that has been destroyed. Restorative processes compete with the processes of organization. Within a week or so, there will be well-formed fibrous tissue in the deepest parts. Immediately superficial to this, there will be young granulation tissue and then a stratum of fibroblasts mixed with leukocytes, and on the surface, there remains the fibrin clot infiltrated with numerous leukocytes. If the course is prolonged, \n\nThe most clinically significant endocardial lesions affect the heart valves rather than the mural endocardium. Lesions may cause valvular stenosis, or valvular insufficiency, or both. Stenosis of a valve, or failure to open completely, impedes the forward flow of blood. Valvular insufficiency, alternatively termed regurgitation, or incompetence results in reversed flow of blood. Valvular dysfunction may produce abnormal heart sounds that are detectable clinically as murmurs. The consequences of valvular disease depend upon the rapidity of onset, type, and duration of the lesion, and may be ameliorated by cardiac compensatory mechanisms. The propensity of thrombi to form on the free margins of valves is well known, but the factors leading to it are not. It may be related to the continual movement and the resulting apposition of the surfaces of the free margins of the valves. There are also ill-defined factors, such as intercurrent disease or increased workload, which promote the development of thrombi. The lack of an internal blood supply to the valve may also be a contributing factor, and in common with other vascular structures, injured endothelial cells release inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins, and other substances, such as adenosine diphosphate, which are potent stimulators of platelet aggregation. Once the endothelium is removed, the exposed collagen also stimulates the aggregation of platelets. The presence of the initial thrombus leads to further clotting. In contrast to cardiac myocytes, endothelial cells have a great capacity for regeneration and for covering any breach in their continuity. If the original insult is removed, which without appropriate treatment is not often, the valve heals by fibrosis, but a shrunken, distorted, insufficient, or stenotic valve may remain.\n\nLittle is known of the process leading to the abnormal development of valves in the embryo, or the progressive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the degenerative disease endocardiosis. The various theories are discussed under the appropriate heading. However, both lead to deficiencies of valve function.\n\nAcute rupture of chordae tendineae can occur spontaneously or in association with chronic valvular degeneration or valvular endocarditis. As well, acute rupture of chordae tendineae or papillary muscles, and resultant acute valvular insufficiency and heart failure, can also be caused by blunt trauma to the chest.\n\nMyxomatous valvular degeneration, commonly termed endocardiosis, is the most common cardiovascular lesion in dogs. It is a significant cause of clinically apparent left-sided heart failure, but is also frequently encountered as an incidental finding at postmortem. Advanced endocardiosis of the left atrioventricular (AV) (mitral) valve leads to mitral insufficiency and regurgitant flow into the left atrium, noted clinically as a systolic murmur, and culminates in left-sided heart failure. The shrunken, distorted AV valves are seen with greatest frequency in toy, small, and medium breeds of dogs, especially in males of breeds such as the Poodle, Pomeranian, Schnauzer, Chihuahua, Doberman Pinscher, Whippet, Fox Terrier, Boston Terrier, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Dachshund, and the English Cocker Spaniel. There are significant negative associations for the Labrador Retriever and the German Shepherd dog. The prevalence of the disease increases with age, from 5% at <1 year of age to >75% at 16 years of age. Endocardiosis is also reported in the left AV valves of normal market-weight pigs, but appears to be clinically inconsequential.\n\nEndocardiosis affects chiefly the left AV valve ( Fig. 1-30A -C). The right AV valve is less severely and less frequently affected. The aortic and pulmonic semilunar cusps are only occasionally involved. Grossly, the affected AV cusps are shortened and thickened. The thickening of the leaflet may be more or less uniform with a rounded edge, or with prominent nodular thickenings on the free margin. The valves are opaque and white, but the surface is smooth and glistening, without any evidence of inflammation. The chordae tendineae may also be thickened and occasionally are ruptured, allowing eversion of the leaflet into the atrium and leading to acute ventricular failure. The left AV valvular annulus may be enlarged.\n\nThe least severe gross change consists of a few small, discrete nodules at the line of closure of the valve. These progress to multiple larger nodules that tend to coalesce in the area of contact. There may be irregular areas of opacity in the proximal portions of the leaflet. The nodules may coalesce to form plaque-like deformities in the area of cusp contact. The chordae tendineae are thickened at their points of insertion into the valve, and there are clearly defined areas of opacity on the basal portions of the leaflet. The most severe change is characterized by a gross distortion of the valve by gray-white nodules and elevated plaques. The cusps are contracted, A B C thickened, and irregular. There may also be fixed upward displacement of the free margin of the valve. Enlargement and redundancy of the valve may be seen as doming or hooding of the body of the valve toward the atrium; this prolapse of the body of the redundant left AV valve into the atrium (\"mitral valve prolapse\") may be seen both echocardiographically and at postmortem. Chordae tendineae may be ruptured, in which case the free edge of the valve may prolapse as a flail leaflet. Care should be taken in the assessment of the valves, because both the left and right AV valve leaflets thicken with increasing age, and the free margin of the septal leaflet of the right AV valve is normally distinctly thicker than the free leaflets.\n\nChanges secondary to AV valvular insufficiency are dilation of the atria, particularly the left atrium, and dilation of the ventricles. The ventricles may be eccentrically hypertrophied. The left atrial and ventricular subendocardium may be diffusely thickened by fibrosis following prolonged dilation. There may also be evidence of regurgitation in the form of focal elevated streaks and plaques of subendocardial fibrosis in the atria (\"jet lesions\"). Left atrial tears may also be seen in advanced cases, and these tears may rupture and lead to hemopericardium. Mural thrombi can form in the dilated left atrium; dislodgement of the thrombi can result in thromboembolism, for instance, of coronary arteries leading to myocardial infarction.\n\nMicroscopically, the earliest changes are present on the atrial side of the valves. There is proliferation of the endothelium, increased numbers of subendothelial fibroblasts and macrophages, and splitting and separation of elastic fibers between the atrialis and spongiosa. However, it is the thickening of the spongiosa and degeneration of the fibrosa that are the most prominent features of endocardiosis. The spongiosa is greatly thickened by the proliferation of loose fibroblastic tissue and . In a few cases, amyloid may be deposited. There is no increase in collagen or elastic tissue in the spongiosa. The changes in the fibrosa are also marked. Collagen bundles become swollen and hyalinized, fragment, and disappear. In advanced cases, only scattered remnants of the fibrosa remain. Similar changes are seen in chordae tendineae. Intramural coronary arteriosclerosis and focal myocardial necrosis and fibrosis are commonly seen in the left ventricular myocardium, especially the papillary muscle, if the ventricle is hypertrophic.\n\nThe cause of endocardiosis is not known, but there is clearly a genetically influenced degeneration of connective tissue at its center. This suggestion is supported by the observation that the most frequently affected breeds are of the chondrodystrophoid type. Endocardiosis is inherited in Dachshunds and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels; a polygenic mode of inheritance is suggested.\n\nRecent research suggests that alteration in tensile strain on the valves is involved in the initial phases of the disease. Given the genetic nature in some breeds and the familial nature in others, the origin of the increased tensile strain on the valves may be the result of abnormal architecture of the AV valvular complex and possibly abnormal conformation of the ventricles themselves. This increased tensile strain leads to increased serotonin levels in the valve itself, in turn activating the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) group of proteins. TGF-\u03b2 proteins in turn promote the activation of myofibroblasts/mesenchymal cell phenotypes. Whether the increased production of proteoglycans is initiated by the same mechanism remains to be seen. Activation of matrix metalloproteinases also appears to contribute to the destruction of collagen and other fibrillar proteins in the valve.\n\nThere is a striking similarity of endocardiosis to the prolapsed mitral valve syndrome of humans, in which there is deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the spongiosa secondary to an as yet undefined abnormality of collagen metabolism. Mitral valve prolapse also occurs in humans in association with connective-tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and a variety of muscular dystrophies.\n\nMitral insufficiency in the horse can result from endocardiosis, endocarditis, flail valve leaflets, rupture of chordae tendineae, and left AV valve prolapse. Clinical signs of exercise intolerance, poor performance, or congestive heart failure result. Dilation of the pulmonary artery may also ensue, indicating pulmonary hypertension, and may presage pulmonary artery rupture. \n\nEndocarditis is one of the more significant of the endocardial alterations. It is usually bacterial in cause, the exceptions being occasional parasitic or mycotic lesions. Any portion of the endocardium may become inflamed, but the lesions are usually primary on the valves, from which there may be some encroachment on the adjacent mural endocardium ( Fig. 1-33A , B). The left AV valve is most commonly affected in most species, followed by aortic, right AV valve, and pulmonic, except in cattle, in which the right AV valve is more commonly affected. Many bacterial species are capable of causing acute valvular endocarditis, and the larger the number of cases examined, the wider the variety of pathogens recognized. In cattle, Trueperella pyogenes is probably the most common pathogen, and a primary focus of infection can often be found in some other site, such as a traumatic peritoneal abscess, hepatic abscess, metritis, or mastitis. Streptococci of enteric origin are also of some importance in cattle, although the manner of their systemic invasion is not clear. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae causes endocarditis in a variety of animals, most commonly in the pig; however, streptococci are more commonly isolated from cases of acute bacterial endocarditis of swine. Mature horses seldom develop bacterial endocarditis, but the lesion has been observed in association with Streptococcus equi, Actinobacillus equuli, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida parapsilosis. A number of cases in horses have originated from\n\nCongenital hematomas (hemocysts) on the margins of the AV valves are common, especially in calves (see previously, Miscellaneous cardiac anomalies). Blood cysts and serous cysts have been reported in the AV valves in 11% of the hearts in a series of 30,000 slaughter cattle, with a higher incidence in cows than calves. Blood-filled cysts were often present on both AV valves, whereas serous cysts occurred more frequently on the left AV valve. This suggests that cysts do not regress with age; indeed their incidence and size may increase with age. The endothelium lining the blood-filled cysts was positive for factor VIII-related antigen. The cysts may represent ectasias of blood vessels and lymphatics.\n\nSubendocardial fibrosis may be diffuse or focal, congenital, or acquired. The congenital lesions are discussed under Congenital abnormalities of the heart and large vessels. Diffuse subendocardial fibrosis is seen whenever a ventricle or atrium is dilated for a prolonged period. It is probably best exemplified by the dilated cardiomyopathy of large-breed dogs.\n\nSubendocardial fibrosis in localized areas is observed chiefly in the atria and is regarded as a reaction of the endocardium to abnormal jets of blood or to turbulence following congenital or acquired valvular disorders (see Fig. 1 -30A). They are loosely termed jet lesions, but are probably areas subject to increased static pressure in turbulent flow.\n\nSubendocardial mineralization is associated with a variety of disorders. It occurs commonly in opaque plaques or as small grains in the left atrium, and occasionally in the trunk of the aorta in dogs that have recovered from ulcerative endocarditis of renal insufficiency (see Mineralization, later). Prominent white plaques of mineralization also occur beneath the endocardium of the right ventricle in nutritional myopathy of lambs. Subendocardial mineralization in the atria and left ventricle may accompany endocardial fibrosis when these cavities are acutely dilated, either as congenital or acquired defects, and in a variety of prolonged debilitating diseases in cattle ( Fig. 1-32 ). Calcium and phosphorus are deposited in degenerate subendocardial muscle, but more commonly in fibroelastic tissue. The fibroelastic tissue is modified either by chronic disease or elevated serum levels of calcium and phosphorus, as in vitamin D intoxication, or following the ingestion of plants containing vitamin D analogues (see Vol. 3, Endocrine glands). Proprietary rodenticides based on calciferols cause this lesion in dogs. Aupperle H, et \n\nseptic jugular vein thrombophlebitis. Minor outbreaks of endocarditis occur in lambs and are usually caused by Streptococcus spp., particularly enterococci; there may be associated polyarthritis. Endocarditis is seldom observed in dogs, but can be associated with a variety of organisms, especially Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and less frequently with Bartonella spp., Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Erysipelothrix tonsillarum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pasteurella multocida, or various Aspergillus spp. (Fig. 1-34A , B). Endocarditis is unusual in cats, but has been caused by Bartonella spp. and Streptococcus spp. In general, neonatal animals are more prone to develop endocarditis in association with septicemias of bacterial origin. The major features of endocarditis are shown in eFigure 1-6. The manner by which bacteria localize on a valve is not clear, and there is seldom detectable evidence of some separate underlying disease of the leaflet. In active thrombotic valvular endocarditis, bacteria are invariably present in the lesion. Two factors that must be included in any concept of pathogenesis are 1. The tendency for lesions to occur at the lines of apposition of the valve surfaces exposed to the forward flow of blood 2. The necessity for sustained or recurrent bacteremia It is possible that simple debilitation of endothelial cells in recurrent bacteremia and aggravated locally on the valves by the trauma of apposition may alter the adhesiveness of the leaflet endothelium sufficiently for bacterial adhesion to occur. It is of significance that valvular endocarditis can be produced in normal animals by a single intravenous injection of bacteria of suitable type and virulence; the incidence of endocarditis is increased if the hearts of such animals are subjected to increased workloads or the valves are traumatized during the experiments. There is also the possibility that bacterial endocarditis can begin within the valve during septicemia, as has been demonstrated by isolation of bacteria from the spongiosa of pig valves.\n\nParticular strains of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae can selectively adhere to the valvular endothelium of porcine heart valves in vitro, with greatest numbers at the base of chordae tendineae. The phenomenon of selective adherence has been demonstrated for pathogens associated with other organ system disease, notably staphylococci and streptococci in eFigure 1-6 Major features of endocarditis. These may detach to produce emboli Bacterial colonies embedded in the thrombi.\n\nThese may detach to produce emboli\n\nHealing of the lesion occurs from the base by fibrosis Healing of the lesion occurs from the base by fibrosis\n\ndo not produce pulmonary infarcts in the absence of preexisting pulmonary congestion. Emboli arising in the left heart produce their most obvious effects in the kidney and spleen as septic or aseptic infarcts and embolic glomerulitis, and in the myocardium as myocardial abscesses or interstitial myocarditis. Arthritis is commonly observed in association with endocarditis in the dog. Cerebral embolism is rare in animals. Unless the valvular lesions are very slight, there is, with healing, some degree of permanent damage, especially if the inflammation is recurrent. Shrinkage or adhesion of leaflets may cause narrowing of the orifice (stenosis), or insufficiency as a result of failure of the distorted valves to close the orifice. Stenosis and insufficiency may coexist. The usual outcome is congestive heart failure.\n\nMural endocarditis may be merely an extension to the walls of the cardiac chambers of a process originating on the valves. This is almost invariably true of endocarditis caused by Trueperella pyogenes. Small foci of mural endocarditis may be found adjacent to foci of myocarditis, especially myocardial abscesses. Right or biventricular thrombosis in alpacas has been associated with mural endocarditis and inconsistent isolation of a causative agent. This suggests the possibility of a fastidious organism as the cause, such as Bartonella spp. or the possibility of an underlying cardiomyopathy.\n\nParasitic endocarditis caused by the larvae of Strongylus vulgaris occurs in horses acutely in the form of vegetative valvular endocarditis and chronically as caseous and calcareous nodules attached to the endocardium at various sites, including the apex of the left ventricle and protruding into the cavity. There is, in the same cases, parasitic aortitis of the bulb. With the advent of effective anthelmintics, parasitic endocarditis in horses is rare.\n\nAn acute form of ulcerative mural endocarditis occurs in cattle dying from blackleg, as red thrombotic masses attached to the free wall of the right ventricle and, less often and less extensively, on the right atrial and valvular endocardium.\n\nVarious unique intracardiac fistulae or shunts have been reported as sequelae to endocarditis in dogs, including extension of aortic valvulitis into the right coronary artery and fistulation into the right atrium; perforation of the membranous interventricular septum, leading to a left ventricular outflow tract-right atrial shunt (Gerbode defect) in a dog with severe mural endocarditis caused by a Bordetella-like organism; and a fistula between the left ventricular outflow tract and the left atrium adjacent to the mitral valve annulus in a dog with Staphylococcus intermedius endocarditis.\n\nOne of the more common forms of mural endocarditis occurs in renal failure in dogs. The lesion is confined, within the heart, to the left atrium, but similar lesions occur in the large elastic arteries, being more frequent in the pulmonary and aortic trunks immediately proximal to the valves, and less frequently in the descending aorta and its major branches. (The vascular lesions associated with renal failure are discussed under Diseases of the vascular system.) The endocardial and major-arterial lesions are more common in acute than in chronic renal failure, insofar as these syndromes are distinguishable.\n\nThe ulcerative atrial lesion, which is identical to the arterial lesion, begins as a swelling of the interstitial spaces of the subendocardium or intima of the arteries, with deposition of glycosaminoglycans. Initially, the endothelium is intact and, when viewed grossly in this stage, the endothelial surface is seen to be raised slightly, finely wrinkled, and slightly opaque mastitis and enterotoxigenic coliforms in colibacillosis. There is also an immunologic cross-reaction between E. rhusiopathiae antigens and valvular and myocardial antigens. Various Streptococcus spp. have been shown to adhere to exposed basement membrane of porcine valves.\n\nThe lesion of acute bacterial endocarditis is usually observed as irregular vegetations on the affected valve. It is quite exceptional to find the earliest lesion, which consists of irregular ulcerations on the swollen leaflet. The composition of vegetations is similar to that of thrombi with, however, few platelets. Numerous bacterial colonies are present in the vegetations, almost always in pure populations. It is wise to make preliminary identification of the organisms by smears, because although they persist in colonies buried in the vegetations, they may not be cultivable. With the current techniques of molecular biology, such as PCR, it should be possible to identify at least the genus of the noncultivable organisms embedded in the thrombus. The bacteria that initiate the lesion are enmeshed in the early layers of thrombi and are buried deeply as new layers are formed on the surface. With continued multiplication, many microscopic colonies are formed, and without appropriate antimicrobial treatment, it is their persistence in the protected environment that is the reason healed bacterial endocarditis is seldom seen. Even though the bacteria in the thrombi may lose their vitality, as indicated by lack of cultivability, they are persistently antigenic.\n\nGrossly, the vegetations are yellow-red or yellow-gray and usually covered by a thin clot of blood, which can be easily peeled off. The surface of the vegetation is friable, and small vegetations can be easily removed to leave a granular, eroded surface on the valve. The ulcerations are especially common in the commissures and at the free margins of the valves, imparting to them a rough, serrated appearance. The primary valvular lesion frequently extends to the adjacent mural endocardium and, in the cases of aortic valvular endocarditis, to the adjacent aortic intima in the sinuses of Valsalva, which may involve an orifice of a coronary artery, predisposing to myocardial embolism. Endocarditis of the AV valves tends to spread along the chordae tendineae, causing some of them to rupture. Acute swelling and inflammatory change take place in the substance of the valve itself, often with necrosis, which obscures the line of partition between the valve and its surface vegetation.\n\nOrganization of the thrombus proceeds from the base by the usual process of granulation, which is likely to be impeded or destroyed by bacterial growth. Early scarification in the deepest layers separates the thrombus from the underlying myocardium and is frequently accompanied by mineralization.\n\nValvular endocarditis is commonly fatal, although resolution may be complete if lesions are only minor. Clinical signs in animals with endocarditis may only be detected late in the disease, with the most common being pyrexia, lameness, and cardiac murmurs. The frequency with which clinical signs are observed is dependent on the husbandry conditions under which the animal is kept. Other sequelae are those resulting from valvular damage or embolism. Portions of the vegetations may become detached and carried as emboli, to become impacted in the vessels of other organs. Such emboli may be either bland, that is, consist of thrombotic material only, or septic, consisting of thrombotic material together with the enmeshed infectious agent. Emboli arising in the right heart may produce pulmonary abscesses or pulmonary thrombosis. These latter and myocarditis, through idiopathic myocardial disease (cardiomyopathy). The reaction of myocardium to insults is limited, and includes the usual expressions of degeneration, necrosis, inflammation, and healing. Acute changes, such as necrosis and hemorrhage, will be discussed first. Given time to adapt to an insult, a diseased myocardium may grossly take one of 2 conformations: dilated or hypertrophic. This classification is useful conceptually, but is somewhat arbitrary, and individual cases will often have features of more than one form, for instance, the heart in a cat with hyperthyroidism will hypertrophy, but it may eventually dilate and fail.\n\nPetechial and larger subepicardial hemorrhages are so common in horses that die naturally that they are almost to be regarded as normal. The incidence of hemorrhages in sheep and cattle is somewhat lower; they are seldom seen in dogs and cats. Subepicardial hemorrhages are common in instances of asphyxia or death in anoxia, and in many acute infectious fevers. Larger ecchymotic hemorrhages that may involve most of the epicardium occur in the hemorrhagic diatheses.\n\nSubendocardial hemorrhages have the same pathogenesis but are considerably less common. Ecchymotic hemorrhages beneath the endocardium of the left ventricle occur in instances of acute cerebral injury and are useful as a diagnostic indication of clostridial enterotoxemia in lambs and calves, being present in a considerable proportion of cases.\n\nSmall interstitial capillary hemorrhages within the myocardium accompany those within the subserosa. Deep myocardial hemorrhages that do not extend to the serosa are commonly present in pigs that die of asphyxia; they are distributed in the wall of the right ventricle in the vicinity of the descending coronary grooves. A remarkable degree of myocardial hemorrhage occurs in mulberry heart disease of swine (see Mulberry heart disease of swine, later). but still shiny. The lesion may not progress farther than this but, instead, heals with some fibrosis, which leaves areas of uneven opacity. More usually, however, there is progression to necrosis involving the cellular elements as well as collagen, elastic, and reticulin fibers. The necrotic tissue ulcerates, and the margin is densely infiltrated by leukocytes ( Fig. 1-35 ). The ulcerations may perforate the wall of the atrium. Thrombi, in greater or lesser amounts, form on the ulcerated surface. Heavy deposits of calcium salts often form in the degenerate tissue. If renal sufficiency is re-established, the endocardial lesion may heal leaving irregular patches of fibrosis with an intact endothelium, often covering persistent white plaques of mineralization. Other extrarenal lesions of uremia are considered in Vol. 2, Urinary system. \n\nMyocardial dysfunction can be the product of a wide variety of agents and conditions (Table 1-5) . This section deals with the range of myocardial disease, from the more-or-less specific myocardial conditions of degeneration, necrosis, hemorrhage, quite varied and part of a number of disease syndromes described elsewhere in these volumes.\n\nIn infectious disease, the distinction between myocardial necrosis and myocarditis with myofiber necrosis is somewhat arbitrary-inflammatory cells will invade necrotic myocardium; in acute myocarditis, inflammatory cells should be intimately associated with necrotic myocardial cells, and adjacent myocytes may appear normal. Necrosis predominates in highly fatal foot-and-mouth disease in neonatal lambs, piglets, and calves, whereas the residual lesions in older cattle qualify as myocarditis with a significant inflammatory response. Fulminating infection by canine distemper virus in young puppies is purely degenerative, whereas parvoviral and herpesviral infections in the same age group contain elements of an inflammatory response. Of the bacterial diseases, and excepting blackleg, Histophilus somni appears to be responsible for a residual syndrome of sudden death in cattle with myocardial necrosis or infarction, although in some cases myocardial abscesses may be present.\n\nSevere, often fatal, myocardial necrosis is typically part of the important vitamin E and selenium-responsive syndromes of nutritional myopathy of lambs, calves ( Fig. 1-37A , B), swine, and horses, and in mulberry heart disease of swine. It may also be seen as part of equine rhabdomyolysis and of capture myopathy and other exertional syndromes (see Vol. 1, Muscle and tendon).\n\nDeficiency disease, additional to those that respond to vitamin E and selenium, may include myocardial necrosis. It occurs, although not invariably, in thiamine deficiency in carnivores, always as a single acute episode. Falling disease of cattle in Australia and Florida is a syndrome of sudden death believed to result from prolonged copper deficiency. Myocardial scars accompany acute lesions, suggesting repetitive episodes and resembling the lesions of fluoroacetate poisoning in cattle eating the gidgee plant, Acacia georginae, which is to be distinguished from the nontoxic Acacia cambadgei (gidyea, gidgee) . In cats, taurine deficiency causes myocardial failure.\n\nToxic myocardial degeneration is common, and although some examples are accompanied by degeneration of skeletal muscle, they are described here. Injectable saccharated iron compounds, by virtue of the capacity of iron to generate free radicals in ferric/ferrous translations, cause fatal myocardial\n\nCardiac muscle is structurally similar to skeletal muscle and is subject to the same anatomic types of degeneration. There is, however, a greater liability for cardiac muscle to undergo degeneration as a response to many nonspecific causes, probably related to its continuous activity. Diffuse nonspecific myocardial degeneration occurs secondarily in a variety of systemic diseases, especially infectious fevers, anemia, and toxemia.\n\nHydropic change, or vacuolar degeneration, of the myocardium is characterized grossly by a dull gray appearance and increased friability so that the myocardium is easily torn. On cut surface, the muscle is smoother than normal, the outlines of individual muscle bundles obscured.\n\nFatty change-the appearance of lipid vacuoles in myocyte cytoplasm-is a more severe event than hydropic change, and may be recognized grossly as uneven patches of pale yellow myocardium. The process of fatty change is not uniform, and it is sometimes possible to recognize, beneath the endocardium, alternating bundles of fibers or strips of myocardium more yellow than the remainder (\"thrush-breast heart\"). Both hydropic change and fatty change are reversible forms of cellular injury.\n\nAtrophy of the heart occurs in chronic wasting diseases and malnutrition. In some cases, the atrophy is accompanied by dark pigmentation, and it is then called \"brown atrophy.\" It should be recognized, however, that atrophy can occur without pigmentation, and pigmentation can occur without atrophy. Ruminants are principally affected by atrophy, brown or not, and rarely does the atrophic heart produce clinical disturbance. The epicardial fat may be gelatinous, the endocardium wrinkled, and myocardium brown and friable. Histologically, the muscle fibers are thin, the nuclei small and dark, and masses of brown pigment granules are present within secondary lysosomes at the nuclear poles. The pigment is lipofuscin (\"wear-and-tear pigment\"), an oxidation product of unsaturated lipids.\n\nXanthosis (xanthomatosis) refers to the abnormal lipofuscin pigmentation of the myocardium and skeletal muscles seen in cattle, particularly mature Ayrshire cows (see Vol. 1, Muscle and tendon). Microscopically, lipofuscin is commonly seen at the nuclear poles of cardiac myocytes in aged dogs and cats.\n\nMineralization occurs quite commonly in the myocardium, and is to be expected whenever there is necrosis of fibers. Calcium salts are selectively deposited in the Purkinje network in organomercurial poisoning in cattle, in which the mineralization is preceded by hyaline necrosis of the Purkinje fibers and is followed by surrounding fibrosis.\n\nOsteocartilaginous metaplasia of the right atrial myocardium in sheep is a common incidental finding in adults, and has been reported at a prevalence of ~10%. The foci of metaplasia are often palpable grossly, but may only be detectable by radiography or microscopy. Histologically, the myocardium of the atrial free wall contains trabeculae of lamellar bone that are bordered by cartilage and chondroid matrix ( Fig. 1-36) . The metaplastic regions are not associated with the os cordis at the heart base.\n\nFocal to massive myocardial necrosis, or residual scars thereof, is a common lesion in postmortem material. The causes are A B necrosis in piglets. Monensin, an ionophore that is widely used as a coccidiostat and growth promotant in ruminants, may contaminate compounded feeds for simple-stomached animals and is cardiotoxic for horses and pigs (see Vol. 1, Muscle and tendon for details of poisoning in other species). Also, ruminants fed dried poultry litter containing the ionophores maduramicin or salinomycin develop severe cardiac myocyte atrophy and interstitial fibrosis sufficient to result in clinical signs of congestive heart failure. Myocardial necrosis occurs in dogs ingesting rodenticides that contain thallium; these have been widely replaced by warfarin analogues and calciferols.\n\nGalenia africana (yellow bush or kraalbos) is a bushy plant that is toxic to sheep and goats in South Africa, causing a syndrome known as waterpens or waterbelly as ascites is a prominent feature of this toxicosis. The toxin has not been identified. Hepatotoxicosis appears to develop first, advancing from dilation of central veins and sinusoids to centrilobular and bridging fibrosis, with areas of coagulative necrosis. Myocardial changes begin with myocyte hypertrophy and progress to patchy degeneration and necrosis of myofibers and light fibrosis.\n\nPlants that contain cardiac glycosides of both the bufadienolide and cardenolide types are of worldwide distribution. Poisoning by bufadienolide cardiac glycoside-containing plants is the most important plant-associated poisoning of livestock in southern Africa, and may be acute or chronic. Acute poisoning is caused by plants of the family Iridaceae (\"tulip\"), for instance, Homeria pallida (the cape tulip), H. miniata, Moraea polystachya, M. bipartita; family Liliaceae (\"slangkop\"), for instance, Urginea sanguinea; and family Santalaceae, for instance, Thesium lineatum (\"witstorm\"). As well, several species of Bryophyllum (synonym Kalanchoe) that occur in Madagascar and have been introduced to southern and eastern Africa, and Australia, for instance, B. tubiflorum and B. pinnatum, contain bufadienolides (bryotoxins A, B, C, or bryophyllins).\n\nIn acute poisoning, death occurs within a few hours of ingesting the plant. Affected animals have cardiovascular (tachycardia, arrhythmia, heart block), gastrointestinal, respiratory, and neuromuscular signs. Some cases may live for a few days and have scattered foci of myocardial necrosis, but usually a diagnosis must be based on demonstrated access to the plant, the observed clinical syndrome, and the presence of recognizable plant parts in the ingesta. The cardiac glycosides are inhibitors of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, which is responsible for maintaining membrane ion concentrations and the membrane potential of cardiac muscle fibers.\n\nChronic cardiac glycoside poisoning (\"krimpsiekte\") is a botulism-like, paretic condition of small stock that is caused by members of the family Crassulaceae (\"plakkies\") that contain cumulative bufadienolides, for instance, Tylecodon wallichii, T. ventricosus, Cotyledon orbiculata, Kalanchoe lanceolata.\n\nCardenolide cardiac glycoside-containing plants, for instance, Nerium oleander (common pink oleander), Cascabela thevetia (Thevetia peruviana, yellow oleander), of the family Apocynaceae, are seldom eaten by livestock and are usually of little veterinary importance. However, when ingested, typically as plant clippings mixed with other garden waste, their positive inotropic effects on the heart can cause tachycardia, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Long-term exposure to oleander can result in degeneration, fibrosis, and mononuclear cell infiltration of the myocardium ( Fig. 1-38) . Oleandrin, the responsible cardenolide, can be detected in blood or urine by example of catecholamine-induced myocardial necrosis is that seen in cases of functional pheochromocytoma. The exact mechanism(s) of catecholamine toxicosis is unknown, but may involve a direct toxic effect, such as free radical damage of myocyte membranes.\n\nCoronary embolism is a relatively common cause of focal myocardial necrosis, the emboli originating from vegetations of left-sided endocarditis; septic emboli may result in myocardial abscesses. In granulocytopenic diseases, bacterial embolism may result in multiple minute myocardial infarcts, the best examples being seen worldwide in bracken fern (Pteridium spp.) poisoning in cattle. Myocardial infarction may occur in polyarteritis (periarteritis nodosa and allied lesions).\n\nArteriosclerosis, although common in animals, is very seldom severe enough to be responsible for ischemia of the myocardium. In aged dogs, some degree of hyalinosis of the intramural coronary arteries is frequently seen and may be associated with, and presumably the cause of, myocardial infarcts. This condition is called multifocal intramural myocardial infarction (discussed later with Arteriolosclerosis). Hearts that are dilated or hypertrophic are susceptible to focal necrosis of apparently random distribution, although larger lesions are more obvious in the subendocardium of the left ventricle and papillary muscles.\n\nThe gross and microscopic appearance of myocardial necrosis is dependent on the interval between the initial insult and death. Gross changes of necrosis are not readily apparent until 12 hours after injury. By 18 to 24 hours, the affected area, in which calcium salts may be deposited, is paler and gray-brown ( Fig. 1-39 ). The overlying serous membrane is usually normal. Myocardial degeneration, mineralization, and necrosis are most common in the subendocardial myocardium. This area undergoes the greatest intramyocardial tension during systole and is the most likely to be ischemic. However, proliferative or thrombotic lesions completely occluding vessels in these areas are rarely observed even with careful technique. The common small foci of myocardial necrosis may not be visible from the serous surface, and perhaps may be recognizable only microscopically. The necrosis resulting from infarction will, if sufficiently large, involve the serosal surfaces and produce fibrinohemorrhagic thickening of the pericardium that may neatly overlie and indicate the infarcted thin-layer chromatography or by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Summer pheasant's eye (Adonis aestivalis or Adonis microcarpa), which contains cardenolides similar to oleander and foxglove (Digitalis spp.), causes endocardial and epicardial hemorrhage and mild multifocal myocardial necrosis; strophanthidin, the aglycone of several cardenolides in Adonis, can be detected by LC/ MS in gastrointestinal contents from affected horses.\n\nNot all acute cardiotoxicoses of botanical origin can be ascribed to glycosides. Whereas chronic Phalaris spp. toxicosis does produce interesting changes in the central nervous system, the acute toxicosis is of much greater economic importance as the cause of quick death in animals first exposed to grazing on this pasture species. The acute toxicant in Phalaris appears to be a tryptamine alkaloid, which may interfere with the metabolism and action of serotonin and other catecholamines. In sheep and cattle, Lantana camara causes myocardial necrosis that might have an entirely different pathogenesis, possibly dependent on reduced myocardial perfusion as a result of chronic reduction in circulating blood volume. Poisoning by Cassia spp., including Cassia occidentalis (coffee senna), Karwinskia humboldtiana (coyotillo), and Cicuta douglasii (western water hemlock), causes muscular and myocardial necrosis in livestock. Vicia villosa (hairy vetch) and V. benghalensis poisoning involves many organs, including the heart. The lesions are unusual for a poisoning in that there is a substantial chronic eosinophilic granulomatous inflammatory response associated with the necrosis. Young ruminants (before the rumen has developed), pigs, and dogs are susceptible to the cardiotoxic effects of gossypol, a toxic alcohol, when cottonseed meal is incorporated in their feed as a protein supplement. Eupatorium rugosum (white snakeroot) causes myocardial and skeletal muscle damage through the action of tremetol, another toxic alcohol. High erucic acid rapeseed oil can cause myocardial degeneration and necrosis in a variety of species; this effect has been mitigated by the development of canola, which has low erucic acid content.\n\nAcute selenium toxicosis resulting from the ingestion of various selenium-accumulating plants, including certain species of locoweed (Astragalus and Oxytropis), and western aster (Symphyotrichum ascendens, formerly Aster ascendens), occurs in horses, cattle, sheep, and pigs in China and western North America. Cattle dying acutely had severe myocardial necrosis, with some survivors developing severe myocardial fibrosis and congestive heart failure. Selenium toxicity is covered in detail in Vol.1 Integumentary system.\n\nCantharidin, the toxic principle in blister beetles (Epicauta spp.), is thought to be the cause of gastric lesions, hemorrhagic cystitis, enterocolitis, and myocardial necrosis in horses that ingest the beetles in baled alfalfa hay.\n\nFocal myocardial necrosis is also frequently observed as an incidental finding on microscopic examination in many diseases, and its immediate pathogenesis can seldom be ascertained, but the lesions are thought to have an ischemic basis. Ischemic myocardial necrosis occurs in thrombotic disease, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation in the microangiopathy of vitamin E/selenium deficiency, and in inflammatory vascular disease, such as periarteritis nodosa. Poor myocardial perfusion may be the cause of the multifocal myocardial necrosis seen occasionally in hypocalcemic parturient dairy cows. The subendocardial necrosis seen following acute brain injury (\"brain-heart syndrome\") may result from coronary arterial spasm and/or catecholamine excess. Another the affected area, and the nuclei of the myocytes become pyknotic. At this stage, macrophages are evident. Granulation tissue appears at the periphery of the lesion toward the end of the first week and usually predominates by the end of the sixth week.\n\nThere are variations in the microscopic appearance of myocyte necrosis, and some attempt has been made to associate the differing microscopic patterns with particular causes, but these associations are not definitive. The first variant is coagulative necrosis characterized by cellular swelling, nuclear hyperchromasia, early loss of striations, and a \"granular\" appearance of the myocyte. This type of change is observed primarily in ischemic states. Coagulative myocytolysis is typified by the presence of thick, irregular, eosinophilic bands, with an accompanying loss of striations and lightly staining granular areas in myocytes. The bands are hypercontracted sarcomeres (\"contraction bands\") (see Fig. 1-41 ) and the light granular areas are mitochondria. Evidence from experimental models suggests that the alteration is the result of the excessive release of endogenous catecholamines. However, this change may be observed in normal myocardium if it is fixed immediately after death. Colliquative myocytolysis appears as a loss of striations, and homogeneous, weakly eosinophilic cytoplasm. The ultrastructural appearance is characterized by intracellular edema, with disintegration of fibrils and other organelles. Waviness of myocardial fibers is claimed by some to be one of the earliest changes observed in myocardial infarction in humans. The affected fibers are not necrotic, but are thinner and undulating in appearance. It is thought that the waviness is due to irreversible stretching followed by compression of ischemic fibers by the surrounding viable myocardium. Attenuated wavy fibers (<6 \u00b5m diameter, wavy appearance) have been noted to be common in the myocardium of dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\nAnichkov (Anitschkow) cells, also known as \"caterpillar cells,\" have been observed in myocarditis and a variety of naturally occurring and experimentally induced myocardial necroses. They are also seen in rheumatic fever in humans in association with Aschoff bodies. Anichkov cells appear as large mononuclear cells in which the nuclear chromatin is present in an undulating wavy ribbon with slender processes radiating from it ( Fig. 1-42 ). The origin of these cells is in dispute. Suggestions include a fibroblastic, pericytic, endothelial, or myocytic origin. Depending on the theory accepted, the function is either that of a macrophage or an abortive attempt at cardiac myocyte regeneration.\n\nA few of the more interesting examples of myocardial degeneration and necrosis follow.\n\nSodium fluoroacetate (compound 1080) is used extensively in some parts of the world as a vertebrate pesticide, and especially as a rodenticide. It is also highly toxic for most domestic mammals. The median lethal dose for most species is ~0.25-1.00 mg/kg of body weight. Fluoroacetate is not directly toxic, but becomes so when converted to fluoroacetyl-coenzyme A. This compound is then combined with oxaloacetic acid to form fluorocitrate. The citric acid cycle enzymes cis-aconitase and succinic dehydrogenase are inhibited by fluorocitrate, effectively inhibiting the production of adequate amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Accidental poisoning by fluoroacetate occurs either by direct ingestion of the poison, or indirectly, as when dogs eat poisoned rabbits.\n\narea. In cases dying within 24 hours, the pericardial reaction may be the only indication grossly of infarction, the necrotic muscle at this stage not being clearly altered or merely pale. The necrotic area becomes more sharply defined by hyperemia by the second to fourth days. By the tenth day, there is beginning replacement of the necrotic zone by fibrous ingrowth. Replacement fibrosis is well established by the end of the sixth week. A substantial, often transmural loss of myocardium and replacement by fibrous tissue may lead to the development of aneurysms of the ventricular wall.\n\nMicroscopically, lesions are not usually detectable for the first 6-12 hours. However, ultrastructural changes are observed within 1 hour. Recognition as early as 2 hours may be possible using special stains, such as hematoxylin-basic fuchsin-picric acid. Necrosis becomes apparent by routine stains after 12 hours (Figs. 1-40, 1-41 ). Subsequently, neutrophils infiltrate \n\nGousiekte (\"quick\" disease) is a plant poisoning of ruminants in southern Africa that is of great economic importance in that region. The disease is characterized by acute heart failure 5-8 weeks after the ingestion of certain plants in the family Rubiaceae. Clinical signs are seldom seen in natural cases; animals are usually found dead. A number of plants can cause the disease, including Pachystigma pygmaeum, P. thamnus, P. latifolium, Fadogia homblei, Pavetta harborii, and Pavetta schumanniana. Pavetamine is the water-soluble, heat-stable toxin responsible for causing gousiekte.\n\nGross pathologic changes include generalized congestion, ascites, hydropericardium, hydrothorax, and pulmonary edema. Ventricular dilation is an inconsistent feature. However, the ventricular walls are thinner and have a tough consistency. In a small proportion of cases, the heart is macroscopically normal. Microscopically, there is focal-to-extensive myofiber loss with replacement fibrosis. The surviving myofibers may be atrophied, and groups of lymphocytes and macrophages may be present in areas of fibrosis.\n\nSheep and goats may die following the ingestion of fresh leaves from some varieties of the avocado tree (Persea americana); the active principle \"persin\" is a monoglyceride that has structural affinities with polyether ionophore antibiotics. Animals may die suddenly after ingesting comparatively few leaves, whereas others may show few ill effects. In those that die, lesions consist of endocardial hemorrhage, especially of the papillary muscles; hydropericardium; pale, flabby heart; ascites; hepatic degeneration; and pale kidneys. Cardiac lesions are those of cardiac myocyte necrosis and congestion and hemorrhage of variable severity. Although horses can be poisoned following the ingestion of avocado leaves, it is not usually fatal.\n\nConsumption of avocado leaves also results in depression of milk production in lactating goats. The affected mammary glands are edematous and reddened with clots in the large ducts. The Guatemalan, but not the Mexican, variety of avocado induces these changes in the mammary gland.\n\nTaurine-deficiency myocardial failure (TDMF) in cats is a primary systolic myocardial disorder associated with taurine deficiency; many cases of feline dilated cardiomyopathy are actually examples of TDMF. Decreased systolic function results in signs associated with decreased cardiac output giving rise to bilateral congestive heart failure. End-diastolic ventricular volume and pressure are increased, as are atrial volume and pressure.\n\nTaurine (2-aminoethane sulfonic acid), an essential amino acid for cats, is abundant in fresh meat, but must be supplemented in commercial feline diets to prevent the development of TDMF, central retinal degeneration, and developmental abnormalities in kittens. Taurine is required in myocardium for the modulation of tissue calcium influx through cardiac calcium channels. Taurine supplementation will restore myocardial function to normal in most cats with low plasma taurine levels and echocardiographic evidence of cardiac chamber dilation and myocardial failure. Cats, and other mammals, have an obligatory need to conjugate bile acids with taurine or glycine; cats not only have a limited capacity to synthesize taurine, but are unable to use glycine for bile acid conjugation.\n\nFluoroacetate of plant origin is responsible for sometimes devastatingly large episodes of poisoning of ruminants. Plants known to accumulate fluoroacetate in lethal quantities for ruminants are Gastrolobium spp. and Acacia georginae in Australia, Dichapetalum spp. (gibflaar) in Africa, and Palicourea marcgravii in Brazil. Whether fluoroacetate has any role in the physiologic economy of the plants is not known, but in the case of A. georginae, there are differences in the development of toxicity in the species. In D. cymosum, there are seasonal differences, toxicity being greater in spring and autumn, and especially in young leaves. Young leaves, including sucker growth, and pods and seeds are more toxic than the mature leaves of A. georginae.\n\nThe syndromes of intoxication vary with the species affected but are either chiefly neurologic, as in dogs, which become extremely excited and convulsive, or chiefly cardiac, as in ruminants. Sheep may collapse suddenly and die within a few minutes. Those less severely affected may develop cardiorespiratory distress and weakness if driven, with death supervening shortly thereafter. Some showing these signs, if left undisturbed, may recover to appear normal until again forced to exercise. The syndrome in cattle is the same as in sheep, death occurring with cardiac failure, fibrillation, cyanosis, dyspnea, and terminal convulsions. Exercise, excitement, or a large drink of water may precipitate clinical signs.\n\nThe postmortem findings in ruminants are referable to myocardial injury. This may or may not be conspicuous, depending on the size of the dose and the opportunity for repeated episodes of poisoning. The concentration of fluoroacetate in D. cymosum is large, and histologic evidence of acute myocardial injury is seen. In A. georginae poisoning, both acute and chronic myocardial changes may be seen. There is some flabbiness of the myocardium, with prominent hemorrhages beneath the cardiac serosa. In acute cases, there are irregular areas of myocardial pallor and mottling sometimes associated with older scars. There is multifocal myocytolysis or hyaline degeneration of the myocardial fibers, with intense infiltration of mononuclear cells. Loss of sarcoplasm leaves an open meshwork of reticulum and vessels, which eventually condenses and scars. myocardial muscle. The development of PSS is intimately associated with stocking density, transportation time, and other antemortem stressors. Death from PSS may occur as a result of peracute heart failure secondary to the metabolic and hormonal sequelae of PSS, namely, acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperthermia, and hypercatecholemia. The latter may produce myocardial necrosis. Sudden death caused by cardiac failure also occurs in sows, both with and without association with the PSS gene mutation.\n\nClinically, affected pigs exhibit muscular tremor, dyspnea, hyperthermia, and cutaneous blanching and erythema. Death quickly ensues. Typical autopsy findings include the rapid development of rigor, pulmonary edema, hydropericardium, and splanchnic congestion. In some, there is epicardial and endocardial hemorrhage with irregular areas of pallor in the left ventricular myocardium. The presence or absence of myocardial necrosis in PSS is a major difference between the European and North American descriptions of the disease. Myocardial necrosis is a common finding in European cases. When present, the necrotic areas are prominent in the inner third of the wall and papillary muscles. The microscopic appearance of the necrotic fibers is characterized by loss of the normal striation pattern, the presence of contraction bands, and fine granulation of the sarcoplasm.\n\nA variant of PSS associated with a mutation in the dystrophin gene, and markedly decreased expression of dystrophin in both cardiac and skeletal myocytes has been recently described.\n\nThe name \"mulberry heart\" is vaguely suggested by the extensive hemorrhages on the surface of the heart, and its major features are depicted in eFigure 1-7. The disease occurs in pigs only, chiefly those 2-4 months of age and in excellent condition, but it has been observed in animals from 3 weeks to 4 years of age. Among old pigs, the incidence is sporadic, but in young pigs, it occurs in short, snappy outbreaks. In most cases, typically affected animals are found dead. The circumstances of sudden death combined with the gross and microscopic lesions strongly suggest that the affected animals die of acute heart failure following the development of ventricular dysrhythmias . Despite the associated gross and microscopic findings, mulberry heart disease is generally a diagnosis of exclusion; this is particularly the case today when As the syndrome is now well recognized, cats are unlikely to die of TDMF. In cats that do die, gross and histologic cardiac lesions are as described later for feline dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\nThe effect of the central nervous system on the myocardium is mediated by the autonomic nervous system and, in particular, the sympathetic nervous system. The heart is richly innervated with autonomic fibers, and myocytes, particularly ventricular myocytes, have high concentrations of \u03b2 receptors. Both the rate and inotropic state of the heart are stimulated by catecholamines. In a number of species, the continuous administration of norepinephrine for 1-2 weeks results in focal myocardial necrosis. Multifocal myocardial necrosis may develop in dogs with paroxysmal tachycardia resulting from functional pheochromocytomas. Also, experimentally induced intracranial hemorrhage produces focal myocardial necrosis, which can be prevented by prior administration of either reserpine, a catecholamine-depleting drug, or propanolol, which blocks \u03b2 receptors.\n\nMultifocal myocardial necrosis occurs in dogs, horses, cows, sheep, pigs, goats, and wildlife in association with neurologic disease of diverse origin (\"brain-heart syndrome\"), from external trauma to infectious disease. The primary lesion may involve the head, central nervous system, or major nerve plexuses. The microscopic appearance of the myocardial lesions is dependent on the time elapsed between insult and death. It varies from acute myocardial degeneration and necrosis to almost complete resolution by fibrosis. There are, no doubt, a number of cases with no gross or microscopic lesions where insufficient time elapsed between the onset of clinical signs and death. The findings of multifocal myocardial necrosis on autopsy in any species should alert the pathologist to examine the central nervous system for abnormality. Secondary multifocal myocardial necrosis also occurs in dogs with gastric torsion, and in dogs and cats with acute necrotizing pancreatitis and septic peritonitis.\n\nDoxorubicin, an antineoplastic agent of the anthracycline antibiotic group, is used in the treatment of lymphoma and other neoplasia in dogs; cardiotoxicosis is the major factor limiting its use. Acute cardiotoxicosis appears to be mediated by peroxidative injury or expression of cytokines. As well, binding of doxorubicin to nuclear and mitochondrial DNA causes blockage of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Chronic doxorubicin cardiotoxicosis, which may be due to decreased protein synthesis as well as altered divalent cation concentration, occurs in dogs given cumulative doses. Congestive heart failure occurs in such dogs; microscopic myocardial changes consist of myocytic vacuolar degeneration (\"adria cells\"), myocytolysis, myofibril atrophy, and fibrosis. The cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin is reduced when administered as a pegylated liposomal form.\n\nPorcine stress syndrome (PSS) is primarily a disease of skeletal muscle (see Vol. 1, Muscle and tendon). A single nucleotide mutation, HAL-1843, in the ryanodine receptor 1 increases the susceptibility 4-fold to PSS, but pigs without the mutation can also develop the disease. The mutation is not expressed in in the fluid. The fibrin is not fixed to the serous surface and, from where it is in contact with the epicardium, it can easily be lifted off to reveal a clean, glistening, serous membrane.\n\nHemorrhages, linear and ecchymotic, are present beneath the epicardium. They may be few, or they may be extensive and involve the epicardium of all chambers, the myocardium, and beneath the endocardium of the papillary muscles and septum. In some, multiple pale streaks and patches of necrosis extend from the epicardial surface into the myocardium. There may be similar lesions visible from the endocardial surface. The abdominal cavity contains a small volume of clear transudate and some fine unattached strands of fibrin on the intestine. The stomach usually contains a mass of dry feed, and its fundic mucosa is diffusely congested. The small intestine is empty and dry, with serosal vessels congested. The liver is congested, sometimes markedly so, with edema of the wall of the gallbladder. In some animals that survive 24 hours or more, there is bilaterally symmetrical softening of the white matter forming the cores of the cerebral gyri. The softenings are visible grossly as gray, translucent, depressed areas studded with tiny hemorrhages that are sometimes confluent ( Fig. 1-45) .\n\nMicroscopically in acute deaths, degeneration of myofibers may be minimal or absent. In these cases, there is merely subserosal edema, with some plugging of lymphatics by fibrin, and interstitial hemorrhage. In others, which are probably less acute cases, there are substantial areas of myocardial necrosis ( Fig. 1-46) . The extent of mineralization of the necrotic fibers varies, but never appears to be as severe as that seen in lambs or calves with nutritional myopathy.\n\nThe second prominent lesion, which is most probably unrelated to the myocardial necrosis, is observed in arterioles of many organs. The change is seen in the heart, kidneys, liver, stomach, intestine, mesentery, skeletal muscle, and skin. There appears to be gradation in the severity of change, from endothelial swelling with increased permeability, to necrosis of smooth muscle cells of the media. The basic appearance includes the accumulation of fibrinoid in arteriolar walls, formation of hyaline thrombi, disruption of endothelium, and necrosis of smooth muscle cells. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of affected arterioles emphasizes the accumulation of fibrinoid. The lungs show congestion and edema only. There is congestion and edema of Raising weanling piglets on a diet deficient in selenium and vitamin E can regularly reproduce the disease. Such animals may develop disease within 2 weeks. As discussed with diseases of muscle (in Vol. 1, Muscle and tendon), selenium is an integral part of the membrane enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which reduces toxic lipid peroxides to hydroxy acids. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and acts synergistically with selenium to protect membranes from high concentrations of lipoperoxides. Field studies, particularly from the Scandinavian countries, have shown that although dietary selenium supplementation markedly reduces the incidence of hepatosis dietetica and nutritional myopathy, the prevalence of mulberry heart disease remains the same. It is also evident that tissue levels of selenium, particularly those in the heart and liver, are within the normal range. It is now considered that vitamin E deficiency plays a central role in the development of mulberry heart disease. However, there is not universal agreement on this. Although some studies show lower tissue levels of vitamin E in affected pigs, others show no difference. Additionally, it has been suggested that the disease is the result of altered vitamin E metabolism and not a consequence of inadequate dietary vitamin E levels. It may be that mulberry heart disease is precipitated following a lack of bioavailability of vitamin E in tissues, or possibly a greater requirement for vitamin E under certain dietary circumstances, such as diets containing large amounts of unsaturated fat.\n\nAnimals dying of mulberry heart disease are always in excellent body condition. There may be slight cyanosis of the ears and ventral abdomen, and exophthalmos, the latter resulting from orbital and palpebral edema. The intermuscular connective tissues are usually wet, and there may be obvious edema, especially in the axillary and inguinal regions and near the xiphoid process. The skeletal muscles are normal.\n\nThe principal gross lesions occur in the thorax. Some 50 mL or more of heavy, straw-colored fluid that clots on exposure to air is invariably present in the pleural cavity. The lungs are edematous and slightly or severely congested, but not severely enough to account for the degree of edema. The pericardium is edematous and opaque and is always acutely distended with fluid transudate. Either heavy strands or a lace of fibrin float the liver, associated in some cases with central necrosis in the lobules. Proteinaceous fluid produces focal detachments of the retina and intercapillary edema of the glomerular tufts.\n\nThe development of the cerebral lesions can be correlated roughly with the duration of the clinical illness. In the majority of cases, where death occurs suddenly, there is no microscopic change in the brain, or merely some slight venous congestion and edema of the cortical white matter. In pigs that live for some hours, there is edematous separation of the fiber tracts of the white matter of the frontal cortex, with acute swelling and fragmentation of oligodendroglia. The overlying gray matter is edematous. In animals that survive for 24 hours or more, it is usual to find severe lysis of the white matter in the cerebrum, which is more or less extensive but usually avoids the internal capsule, corpus medullare, and association fibers. The cores of the gyri of the frontal lobes are most consistently and severely involved, but in some cases, all portions of the cerebrum are involved, and in these, there may be similar lesions in the thalamus and brainstem. The vessels, venules especially, in the degenerate areas are severely injured and may be totally necrotic, although more frequently, there is only endothelial and adventitial swelling and proliferation. Hyaline thrombi are formed in many vessels, and droplets of similar character form in the perivascular spaces. The overlying gray matter is edematous. The vessels are hypertrophic and cuffed by adventitial cells and a few eosinophils. In a few cases, degenerate foci are also present in the cerebellum; these involve the molecular layer with foci of softening or narrow sheets of hemorrhage.\n\nThe lesions in mulberry heart disease depend on the length of time pigs survive after the initial damage occurs. Most pigs die from ventricular dysrhythmia, and those that die immediately no doubt have substantial areas of myofiber death, but there has been insufficient time for the morphologic manifestations of the necrosis to appear. A period of 6-12 hours must elapse before myofiber necrosis can be reliably recognized. After that, the lesions become increasingly evident and progress through stages to replacement fibrosis of the necrotic areas if the pig survives.\n\nIn the experimentally induced disease, serum enzyme levels indicative of myocardial damage may be raised for up to 21 days before death. The extent of cardiac damage is related to the length of time the serum enzymes are raised or, alternatively, to a large increase over a shorter period. The microangiopathy prominent in this disease probably occurs independently of the myofiber necrosis. It is also nonspecific, as the same change is seen in many porcine viral infections and bacterial toxemias. It is, however, a useful indicator of the presence of mulberry heart disease.\n\nMyocarditis, or inflammation of the myocardium, is a common lesion found in a wide variety of systemic diseases (Table 1-6), but it is rarely primary. It occurs hematogenously in many infectious diseases, and also by direct extension from inflammatory lesions of the endocardium and pericardium. A fibers vary widely in extent and in the severity of degeneration. The cause may sometimes be apparent in the histologic nature of the lesion, as, for example, in malignant catarrhal fever of cattle, in which inflammation is centered on the blood vessels. In toxoplasmosis, the degeneration of myocytes predominates over the inflammatory reaction and the organism is identifiable. In most cases of interstitial myocarditis, however, diagnosis of the cause can only be made by reference to the total pathologic picture. Only infrequently can death be attributed to the myocardial lesions, and then only when considerable degeneration/ necrosis of the myocardial fibers has occurred, as in foot and mouth disease of young animals. Some other viral infections, such as canine parvovirus infection and encephalomyocarditis virus infection, are exceptions to this general principle.\n\nMyocarditis is seen in systemic viral infections, such as canine distemper, canine herpesviral infection, and pseudorabies in piglets and dogs. The myocarditis caused by canine parvovirus 2 infection ( Fig. 1-48) is discussed in Vol. 2, Alimentary system and peritoneum. number of specific parasitic infestations also produce myocarditis. Effectors of the immune and inflammatory responses in myocarditis can have numerous deleterious effects on the myocardium: cytolytic T lymphocytes can produce focal cardiac myocyte necrosis; activated lymphocytes and macrophages can release a host of inflammatory cytokines that can lead to altered cardiac myocyte metabolism, decreased contractility, and dysrhythmias, and to increased matrix and myocardial fibrosis. Death resulting from myocarditis may occur acutely because of dysrhythmia where inflammation is often focal and can be missed grossly. Nonfatal cases of myocarditis may progress to congestive heart failure, subsequent to extensive cardiac myocyte loss and fibrosis.\n\nPyogenic bacteria, which may originate from any other suppurative focus in the body or, as in the case of Listeria monocytogenes and Actinobacillus equuli, produce foci of acute suppurative myocarditis that may develop into abscesses with inevitable destruction of the involved tissue (eFig. 1-8). In these, it is often possible to demonstrate bacterial emboli. Clostridium chauvoei may produce necrotizing myocarditis similar to the typical lesion in skeletal muscle ( Fig. 1-47A ). Tuberculous myocarditis is rare, and when present, the granulomatous reaction is typical of the species. Occasionally, fungal organisms can cause multifocal pyogranulomatous lesions ( Fig.  1-47B ). Bartonella henselae is being increasingly recognized as a cause of both pyogranulomatous myocarditis and endocarditis in cats. An additional feature of this disease is myositis involving muscles of the diaphragm.\n\nNecrobacillary myocarditis occurs in cattle secondary to extensive necrobacillosis in other tissues; the necrosuppurative reaction is typical for the organism. Other bacterial causes of suppurative myocarditis include Clostridium piliforme (Bacillus piliformis) and Citrobacter koseri. There is also extensive myocarditis in some systemic mycoses, such as Aspergillus terreus in dogs, particularly the German Shepherd dog.\n\nLess specific interstitial myocarditis occurs in many infectious diseases and is not detectable grossly. The basic pattern is usually the same, the reaction being centered on the interstitial and perivascular connective tissues, with edema and infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and some eosinophils. Neutrophils are few. The changes in the myocardial but susceptible pigs kept in close contact with infected pigs did not develop disease. Sudden death or death following a brief period of excitation and collapse characterizes the clinical disease in the peracute form in swine. In less severe cases, there may be fever, anorexia, and progressive paralysis. The mortality rate is variable. At autopsy, there is hydrothorax, hydropericardium, ascites, and pulmonary congestion and edema. In severe cases, there is extreme pallor of the ventricles, with yellow-to-white foci 2-10 mm in diameter throughout the myocardium. In less severe cases, gross lesions are minimal to absent. Microscopically, the dominant lesions are focal-to-diffuse myocardial necrosis. Patchy mineralization of necrotic areas is evident, accompanied by a mononuclear inflammatory reaction that varies greatly in intensity. Survival allows fibrous scarring to develop. There is little evidence of encephalomyelitis. EMCV infection has also been associated with reproductive failure characterized by mummified fetuses and stillbirth, as well as failure of conception and early embryonic deaths. Fetuses that die toward the end of gestation have multifocal myocardial necrosis.\n\nExperimentally infected swine may die between 2 and 11 days postinoculation. Virus is present in the feces for 7-9 days following oral administration and may be isolated from all organs, with the myocardium exhibiting the highest titer of virus. The virus titer falls rapidly and may not be found in cases that have been infected for 11 days or more. Experimental inoculation of mice regularly produces both encephalitis and myocarditis. Strains of EMCV may be adapted to produce either encephalitis or myocarditis.\n\nThe parasites that tend to localize in the myocardium are the same as those that have an affinity for skeletal muscle. Parasites without such affinity may also be found in the myocardium in the course of their wanderings, especially if they are migrating in an abnormal host or in unusually large numbers in the normal host.\n\nOf those parasites with an affinity for cardiac and skeletal muscle, the ubiquitous sarcocysts are the most common (see Vol. 1, Muscle and tendon). The finding of myocardial sarcocysts is very common in ruminants. This increases with the age of the animal and implies a previous acute sarcocystosis in which Myocarditis is part of a number of important and wideranging clinical and pathologic syndromes in porcine fetuses, stillborn piglets, and young piglets. These include postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), and reproductive failure caused by porcine circovirus 2; porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) caused by the PRRS arterivirus; and porcine myocarditis syndrome (PMC) caused by the novel Bungowannah pestivirus (see Vol. 3, Female genital system).\n\n\"Eosinophilic myocarditis\" is so called because the reaction to sarcocysts is predominantly by eosinophils, which produce the typical, small, green to gray-green foci observed occasionally in cattle at routine meat inspection. This syndrome is not to be confused with the eosinophilic myocarditis present in cases of poisoning by ingestion of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa).\n\nAtrial myocarditis is an infrequently reported entity of undetermined cause in dogs that manifests clinically as an arrhythmia (sinoatrial arrest, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias). Lesions are confined to the atria and can vary from a lymphocyte predominant infiltration to extensive fibrosis ( Fig. 1-49) .\n\nThere are 3 members of the genus Cardiovirus in the family Picornaviridae, and the type species is Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). All species are antigenically related and by most tests are indistinguishable from each other. EMCV can infect humans and other mammals, principally swine and subhuman primates. Rodents, in which it appears to be clinically inapparent and behaves as an enterovirus, may act as reservoir hosts, but infection in laboratory rodents commonly produces fatal encephalitis or myocarditis. The source of infection in outbreaks of myocarditis in swine is thought to be through consumption of feed or water contaminated with virus from rats or other rodents. Ingestion of diseased rodent carcasses is also a likely source of infection. Experimental transmission of disease to swine has been accomplished by feeding the virus, \n\nThe term cardiomyopathy was originally coined for a group of human myocardial diseases in that were of unknown or obscure cause. Cardiomyopathies are now well-defined clinicopathologic entities that have been increasingly shown to be either genetically determined abnormalities of myocardial contractile, cytoskeletal or mitochondrial proteins, or responsive to substances such as taurine and carnitine. Initially, a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy was arrived at by the absence of common causes of heart failure and the presence of abnormalities not readily explained. In humans, where cardiomyopathies were first recognized, there must be absence of significant coronary arterial disease; vascular disease or anomaly; systemic hypertension, past or present; and vascular shunts inside or outside the heart. Features usually present include cardiomegaly, either as dilation or hypertrophy; mural thrombosis, usually in the left ventricle; and, fibrosis or other lesions indicative of generalized myocardial involvement.\n\nschizonts are formed in endothelial cells, usually with little effect. The sarcocysts may be found in the cardiac conducting fibers as well as myocardial fibers and normally appear to be harmless. The multifocal eosinophilic granulomatous reaction to degenerating Sarcocystis cruzi cysts may occur alone or in association with similar lesions of eosinophilic myositis in skeletal muscles. Degenerate cysts are occasionally visible within foci of myocarditis. The cyst content is highly toxic, but whether degeneration or rupture of the cyst is primary or is secondary to some other cause of focal myocardial degeneration is unknown.\n\nA rather severe myocarditis in dogs caused by the protozoal parasite Neospora caninum is seen in association with myositis and encephalomyelitis. Affected dogs vary in age from 2 days to 7 years and may be presented with hindlimb paresis or ataxia, skeletal muscle atrophy, and in some cases, sudden collapse attributable to dysrhythmias induced by the myocarditis. The differentiation of Neospora caninum from Toxoplasma gondii in paraffin-embedded tissue is best accomplished by the use of immunohistochemistry. Additionally, Neospora caninum is commonly associated with bovine abortion.\n\nThe various cysticerci of Taenia ovis, T. saginata, T. solium, and hydatid cysts are frequently found in the myocardium, which is one of their sites of predilection (eFig. 1-9). These parasites are described with parasitic diseases of the intestine (see Vol. 2, Alimentary system and peritoneum), which is the habitat of their definitive stage.\n\nTrichinella spiralis is described with diseases of muscle in Vol. 1, Muscle and tendon. However, it is worth noting here that the larvae of this parasite invade the myocardium, but are seldom found there, either because they continue their migration or are destroyed. The myocardial reaction is a severe interstitial myocarditis, with basophilic degeneration and necrosis of fibers in the areas of inflammation.\n\nThe pyogranulomatous myocarditis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (Fig. 1-50) is described in Vol. 3, Hematopoietic system. Leishmania infantum chagasi also causes a lymphoplasmacytic and less commonly a granulomatous myocarditis in dogs. In Africa, myocarditis can occur in dogs infected with Trypanosoma brucei, and in cattle infected with T. congolense or T. vivax. teins. There is massive loss of myocytes with fatty infiltration and fibrosis. ARVC also occurs in dogs, especially Boxer dogs; in cats; and in Hereford cattle.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a diastolic rather than a systolic ventricular disorder. The hypertrophic ventricle is abnormally stiff (less compliant), resulting in impaired ventricular filling. It is most commonly inherited as an autosomal dominant characteristic within which there is a high prevalence of subclinical disease. Sudden unexpected death is often the first manifestation of HCM. There is left, and sometimes right, ventricular hypertrophy, reduced size of the ventricular lumen, and dilation and often hypertrophy of the atria. The pattern and extent of the ventricular hypertrophy varies from localized hypertrophy of the ventricular septum (asymmetrical septal hypertrophy), to the hypertrophy being symmetrical or even apical in nature. Microscopically, the myocytes are hypertrophied, with many arranged in a whorled or disorganized pattern. Although the disordered myocyte arrangement is not unique to HCM, it is more severe. Fibrosis of variable severity accompanies the hypertrophic process.\n\nMutations in genes that code for proteins associated with the process of cardiac contraction have been identified in cases of HCM. Understanding of the molecular nature of HCM in people has progressed rapidly, providing insight into cardiomyopathies in domestic species. Genes involved in HCM include the cardiac troponin T gene (cTnT), the myosin heavy chain gene (MyHC), and the cardiac myosin-binding protein C gene (MyBPC3). The mutations in each gene appear not to be singular in nature; for example, many mutations have been identified in the MyBPC3 gene alone. The inherited form of HCM is therefore a genetically diverse disease, which presents as a common clinical and pathologic syndrome. Interestingly, mutations of the cTnT gene can cause both DCM and HCM, and mutation in the same codon in the cardiac troponin I (cTnI) gene causes both HCM and RCM.\n\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is characterized by impaired ventricular filling because of reduced ventricular compliance, with unimpaired systolic function. The ventricles are usually of normal size, but both atria are usually dilated. Reduced compliance of one or both ventricles may occur because of interstitial or endomyocardial fibrosis with or without eosinophilia of the ventricles. Restrictive cardiomyopathy may also result from the deposition of amyloid or occur in association with the disease sarcoidosis. These infiltrative cardiomyopathies are, strictly speaking, secondary cardiomyopathies.\n\nThe endomyocardial form of human RCM is subdivided into 2 major forms: Loeffler endomyocarditis occurs predominantly in temperate climates; endomyocardial fibrosis is most common in equatorial Africa. Although the end-stage of both forms is pathologically indistinguishable, the natural history and clinical patterns are quite separable. The Loeffler (hypereosinophilic) variant principally affects males and is associated with hypereosinophilia, thromboembolism, and arteritis. In endomyocardial fibrosis, there is no male predominance, and it occurs in younger patients with no accompanying eosinophilia. At least for the Loeffler variant, endomyocardial fibrosis results from release of granules from infiltrating eosinophils in the earlier phase of the disease.\n\nThe major features of the primary cardiomyopathies are depicted in eFigure 1-10. Cardiomyopathies occurring in domestic animals have been similarly classified and have been documented in cats, dogs, cattle, and pigs.\n\nOf the features described for humans that must be absent, coronary arterial disease and systemic hypertension may be disregarded in domestic animals because of their comparative rarity. In domestic animals, the diagnosis of a cardiomyopathy rests on the absence of significant congenital or acquired valvular or vascular abnormality, the presence of dilation or hypertrophy of one or both ventricles and possibly all 4 chambers, and accompanied in some cases by diffuse fibrosis. An additional exclusion, at least for cats, should be that of hyperthyroidism.\n\nSince the original definition, the term cardiomyopathy has been used loosely to describe any abnormality of the myocardium for which an etiology cannot be defined. There has also been some attempt to classify cardiomyopathies into primary (obscure etiology) and secondary (known systemic or etiologic abnormalities) categories. A classification of similar style categorizes cardiomyopathies as either intrinsic or extrinsic in cause. Under this classification, intrinsic causes are demonstrably genetic or suspected to be so, whereas extrinsic cardiomyopathies include those of infectious, nutritional, or toxic origin. At this stage, we prefer the categorization of cardiomyopathies as either primary (of genetic or suspected genetic origin) or secondary (of known cause other than genetic).\n\nGreat progress has been made in the understanding of primary cardiomyopathies. Mutations in a number of genes coding for proteins associated with cardiac contraction lead to the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in people and gene abnormalities associated with cytoskeletal proteins or mitochondrial enzymes lead to the development of dilated cardiomyopathies. There is also evidence that one of the cardiomyopathies in dogs, and a familial dilated cardiomyopathy in people, results from a mutation in a carnitine transporter gene causing an absolute or metabolic deficiency of carnitine and so can be classified as primary. If the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of the cardiomyopathies continues to progress, then the term cardiomyopathy may become obsolete.\n\nCardiomyopathies generally fall into 3 pathologic forms: (1) dilated (congestive), (2) hypertrophic, and (3) restrictive forms. As the clinical and pathologic patterns of the cardiomyopathies were first described in people, a brief discussion of the essential features in this species is warranted. Dilated (congestive) cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common form in humans. The genetic basis of dilated cardiomyopathies includes abnormalities in genes associated with cytoskeletal proteins (such as desmin, lamin A and B) and mitochondrial genes, the latter leading to defects in oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nDCM is characterized by dysfunction of the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle, where there is lowered force of contraction and increased ventricular end-diastolic volume. There is enlargement and dilation of both atria and ventricles. The ventricles are hypertrophied, but, because of the dilation, the hypertrophy is not as apparent as in the hypertrophic form of the disease. Microscopically, there is variation in myocyte size, myocyte degeneration and necrosis, and variably severe fibrosis. These changes are however, from a pathologist's viewpoint, disappointingly nonspecific.\n\nA variant of DCM is that of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). ARVC is an inherited disease of cardiac myocytes in humans that is characterized by right ventricular failure and severe disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. The molecular basis of ARVC revolves around defects in desmosomal pro- Mutations in genes associated with cytoskeletal proteins and mitochondria\n\nDiastolic disorder\n\nSevere endomyocardial fibrosis\n\nDiastolic disorder\n\nSevere endomyocardial fibrosis eFigure 1-10 Major features of primary cardiomyopathies. but especially notable for the left ventricle ( Fig. 1-51A) . The left ventricular lumen is often slit-like. Some cases have asymmetrical hypertrophy of the left ventricle, with the ventricular septum thicker than the left ventricular free wall. Findings of lesser frequency include atrial thrombi, focal areas of ventricular fibrosis, and fibrosis of the endocardium in the region of the left ventricular outflow tract. Microscopically, myofibers are hypertrophied and contain vesicular nuclei. Myofiber disarray, characterized by interweaving of myofibers in the left ventricular free wall and ventricular septum, may be observed (Fig. 1-51B ). This may also be present in the right ventricle. Extensive interstitial fibrosis is also a consistent feature (Fig. 1-51C) , especially in the inner 2 3 of the left ventricular free wall. Scattered focal areas of dense replacement fibrosis are seen in a minority of cats. As indicated by increased plasma cTnI concentrations, cats with moderate to severe HCM have ongoing myocardial damage, which may be the stimulus for replacement fibrosis. Focal endocardial thickening by fibrosis also occurs commonly. Intramyocardial arteries may have medial hypertrophy, and scattered perivascular accumulations of lymphocytes and monocytes may be present.\n\nUltrastructurally, the hypertrophied myofibers have large pleomorphic nuclei with undulating surfaces and prominent nucleoli. Dense accumulations of Z-band material are also evident in myocytes, as is the presence of lipofuscin granules. Although these changes are seen in normal cat myocytes, the intensity of the changes is greater in cardiomyopathic cases. A concentrically hypertrophied heart also occurs in cats with hyperthyroidism, and this should not be confused with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (see Cardiac hypertrophy, previously).\n\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy is a less common and less welldefined form of feline cardiomyopathy and is characterized by impaired diastolic ventricular filling, which may be due to severe endomyocardial fibrosis. Systolic function is usually normal. Feline RCM has also been termed \"left ventricular endocardial fibrosis\" (LVEF). Endomyocarditis may be an antecedent to LVEF. Feline RCM occurs predominantly in older cats with clinical signs of left-sided or bilateral heart failure. Cardiac murmurs and dysrhythmias are common. Pathologic features include severe endocardial thickening with mural thrombosis. Left atrial enlargement is marked, the result of the restriction of ventricular filling. The left ventricle is thickened, and the lumen volume may be significantly diminished. Microscopically, the myocardium and endocardium may be replaced by granulation tissue of various ages; adjacent myocardium may be infiltrated by histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Bartonella infection has been suggested as a possible cause of feline endomyocarditis. RCM has also been reported in cats with hypereosinophilic syndrome.\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy has decreased markedly in prevalence since the discovery of taurine-deficiency myocardial failure in cats. On postmortem, all chambers of the heart are enlarged, and the ventricles are dilated and flabby with thinned walls (Fig. 1-52) . The endocardium may be pale and slightly thickened by subendocardial fibrosis. The papillary muscles and trabeculae may be atrophied and appear small in relation to the ventricular volume. Often only minor lesions are found on microscopy. Myocardial fibers are moderately hypertrophied, accompanied by mild diffuse interstitial fibrosis. There may also be focal areas of myofiber loss with replacement fibrosis. In some cases, there may be extensive areas of\n\nFeline cardiomyopathies constitute a well-recognized, but diverse, group of morphologic and functional disorders (eFig. 1-11). Echocardiography is the definitive test used clinically to differentiate and classify feline cardiomyopathies. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is most commonly encountered (58%), followed by restrictive (21%), dilated (10%), unclassified (10%), and excessive left ventricular moderator band (<1%) cardiomyopathies. Although feline cardiomyopathy was only recognized as an entity in the relatively recent past, a common consequence of cardiomyopathy, iliac thromboembolism, was originally described >70 years ago. There is a wide range in the age of onset of clinical signs, from 7 months to 24 years of age. Presenting clinical signs include lethargy, anorexia, dyspnea, tachypnea, and occasionally abdominal distension. Murmurs, most often associated with mitral or tricuspid insufficiency, gallop rhythms, and dysrhythmias of various types are frequently encountered. Approximately 1 3 of cats with cardiomyopathy develop unilateral or bilateral thromboembolic hindlimb ischemia. The causes of feline cardiomyopathy include genetic and nutritional origins, and a possible role for viral infection following the detection by PCR of feline panleukopenia virus genome in cats with idiopathic hypertrophic, dilated, and restrictive cardiomyopathies and myocarditis.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the most common form of cardiomyopathy in cats, is a diastolic disorder, resulting from ventricular myocardial hypertrophy in the absence of an obvious cause. There is normal or near-normal systolic myocardial function, but diminished capacity to accept diastolic flow from the left atrium. Left ventricular volume is normal or decreased, and the papillary muscles are usually greatly enlarged in relation to the volume of the ventricle. The left atrium is usually dilated.\n\nIt is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait in Maine Coon and Ragdoll cats, the basis of which appear to be mutations in the gene coding for myosin binding protein C3, a defect also described in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in people. Similar and additional mutations in genes coding for contractile genes are likely in other breeds, including the Siberian, Sphynx, Bengal, Chartreux, and Norwegian Forest cats.\n\nThe gross pathologic features of feline HCM include an enlarged heart, with comparatively massive symmetrical concentric hypertrophy of both ventricles in the majority of cases, An ARVC-like syndrome occurs in cats, where prominent clinical features include supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, marked enlargement of the right ventricle and atrium, and right-sided congestive heart failure, Gross lesions include right ventricular luminal dilation, wall thinning, and apical aneurysm. Microscopically, the ventricles, especially the right ventricle, have myocarditis, myocyte necrosis, myocyte atrophy, fibrosis, and fatty replacement.\n\nExcessive moderator bands (false tendons) in the left ventricle bridging the ventricular septum and free wall and entangling the papillary muscles are associated with heart failure and death in cats. Although not strictly a cardiomyopathy, it is considered under the heading of cardiomyopathies as the clinical syndrome occurs in mature cats. In all probability, it is a congenital defect that is only manifest later in life. Affected cats exhibit a range of clinical signs that are mostly referable to left-sided heart failure. They include lethargy, dyspnea, anorexia, pale mucous membranes, and cardiac murmurs. Radiographic findings include cardiomegaly, hydrothorax, and pulmonary edema. Various conduction disturbances also occur.\n\nGross changes are dominated by the presence of numerous pink-white bands spanning the left ventricular lumen and papillary muscles. Most commonly, the bands connect the cranial and caudal papillary muscles to the ventricular septum. In others, the bands insert between the ventricular septum and the left ventricular free wall. The left ventricle may be dilated or show increased wall thickness. In neither case is the heart weight significantly different from that of normal cats. The left atrium is enlarged, and pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, hepatic congestion, and aortic thromboembolism may be found. Microscopically, the abnormal moderator bands consist of Purkinje cells and dense, mature collagen covered by endothelium. Loose fibrous connective tissue is present between the endothelium and the dense collagen, with the variation in size of the moderator bands the result of more or less mature collagen. Ventricular alterations include myocyte atrophy or hypertrophy, focal fibrosis, and intramural coronary arterial luminal narrowing, intimal thickening, medial hyperplasia, and perivascular fibrosis. Canine DCM has the clinical features of a short history of cough, depression, dyspnea, weight loss, syncope, and polydipsia, or may occur without premonitory signs as sudden death. Clinical signs are often referable to left-sided congestive heart failure and hence pulmonary edema, or may be due to biventricular failure and include ascites. Soft systolic murmurs, indicative of left atrioventricular (LAV) or right atrioventricular (RAV) valvular insufficiency, may be heard on auscultation. Atrial fibrillation is the most common electrocardiographic abnormality; ventricular tachycardia and ventricular premature contractions are common in most Doberman Pinschers with DCM. Echocardiographically, there is cardiomegaly, with increased end-diastolic volume and poor contractile function. The prognosis is poor, with mean survival times of 6-12 months after the onset of treatment.\n\nAutopsy findings in typically affected cases are those of congestive heart failure. All chambers, particularly the left ventricle, are markedly dilated and may be hypertrophied. The AV rings are dilated ( Fig. 1-53A) , the endocardium may be opaque due to subendocardial fibrosis, and there may be atrial thrombosis. There may also be some evidence of infarction in \n\nThe most commonly recognized is dilated cardiomyopathy Although the causes of canine DCM are still mostly unknown, it is increasingly apparent that most have a genetic basis, but as yet, no abnormalities in myocardial cytoskeletal genes have been identified as they have been in human dilated cardiomyopathy. There is a familial tendency in the Doberman Pinscher, English Cocker Spaniel, Boxer, Great Dane, Irish Wolfhound, and Newfoundland; DCM may be an X-linked recessive trait in Great Danes. Infantile dilated cardiomyopathy is inherited in Portuguese Water dogs as an autosomal recessive trait. There is a strong association between the presence of cardiomyopathy and a particular complement C4 phenotype (C4:4) in the English Cocker Spaniel. This is not suggested to be causal, but to indicate a genotype that is predisposed to the development of the disease. A singular finding is that of a deficiency in the mitochondrial respiratory chain in affected Doberman Pinschers, which has its origin in a 16-bp deletion in the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) gene on chromosome 14.\n\nCarnitine deficiency may play a role in some subtypes of cardiomyopathy, although the evidence is not strong. Low blood taurine concentrations have also been found in dogs with DCM that had been fed certain lamb-rice commercial diets. The DCM in Portuguese Water dogs can be reversed in some pups by oral taurine supplementation. Hypothyroidism has been noted as a reversible cause of myocardial failure in 2 Great Danes. striatin gene located on chromosome 17 in affected Boxer dogs is encouraging. Striatin co-localizes in the region of the intercalated disc with 3 desmosomal proteins. Recent evidence also shows that dysfunction in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is involved where there is mislocalization of \u03b2-catenin and striatin and an increase in the total amount of \u03b2-catenin in Boxer dogs with ARVC.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is much less common than the dilated form. Associated clinical syndromes include sudden death, death during anesthesia, and congestive heart failure. Disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum may cause the ratio of the interventricular wall thickness to left ventricular free wall thickness to exceed 1.2:1, and there may be histologic evidence of myofiber disarray in the ventricular septum.\n\nIn canine X-linked muscular dystrophy in Golden Retrievers, an animal model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy in humans, affected and carrier dogs develop Duchenne cardiomyopathy characterized by myocardial interstitial, especially subepicardial, fibrosis, leading to cardiac insufficiency.\n\nB\u00e9langer MC, et al. Taurine distant organs. The finding, in some cases, of multifocal myocardial degeneration, necrosis, or fibrosis is expected, but unrewarding, with regard to possible causes. Ultrastructural examination of myocardium from cases of dilated cardiomyopathy shows increases in intermyofibrillar spaces, lipofuscin granules, fat droplets and myelin figures, mitochondrial hyperplasia, disruption of myofibrils, and Z-band thickening. These ultrastructural changes are not specific for cardiomyopathy, but are more severe than seen with other causes of congestive heart failure. There appear to be 2 histologically distinct forms of DCM: (1) the \"fatty infiltration-degenerative\" type seen, for example, in Boxers and Doberman Pinschers, and (2) the \"attenuated wavy fiber\" type seen in many giant-, large-, and medium-sized breeds, including some Boxers and Doberman Pinschers ( Fig.  1-53B ). This histologic classification of canine DCM may be superior to classification by breed-specific syndromes, because both forms may affect some breeds, such as Boxers and Doberman Pinschers. This postmortem classification does not however assist antemortem etiologic diagnosis of DCM.\n\nA variant of DCM is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a primary familial myocardial disease in humans and in Boxer dogs that is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and risk of sudden death. It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait in humans and Boxers. ARVC in Boxers is characterized by various events, alone or in combination, including ventricular arrhythmias of suspected right ventricular (RV) origin, syncope, heart failure, and/or sudden death. Right ventricular dilation or aneurysms are common. Histopathologic findings include severe myocyte loss in the RV, with replacement by adipose or fibroadipose tissue ( Fig. 1-54 ). Focal fibroadipose lesions may also be present in both atria and in the left ventricle (LV). Myocarditis may be present in the RV and LV in dogs that have died suddenly and may be the source of arrhythmias.\n\nARVC is an ion channel defect in humans, with mutations in genes coding for protein constituents of the special junctions and some nondesmosomal proteins. Mutations identified include those coding for desmocollin-2, desmoplakin and plakophilin, ryanodine receptor 2, desmin, lamins A and C, titin, and striatin. The recent discovery of an 8-bp deletion in the \n\nSeveral syndromes of cardiomyopathy are recorded in cattle. Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs in Holsteins in many countries, including Canada, Australia, and Japan, and in Simmental-Red Holstein crossbreds in Switzerland. Many of the cases emanate from common sires, and an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance has been suggested. A nonsense mutation in the optic atrophy 3 (OPA3) gene on chromosome 18 is present in affected Red Holstein cattle. OPA3 is located on the mitochondrial membrane, and mutations lead to disruption of mitochondrial morphology, and presumably, mitochondrial dysfunction. OPA3 mutations are also involved in the development of optic atrophy, cataracts, and neurologic disorders. The cardiomyopathy occurs in young adult to mature animals, with the clinical signs particularly referable to right-sided heart failure, including dependent subcutaneous edema, hydrothorax, ascites, and severe hepatic congestion. There is no indication of the presence of electrocardiographic abnormalities. The heart is enlarged with dilation of both ventricles. Microscopically, there is a mixture of atrophied and hypertrophied myofibers with vacuolation, and there are islands of interstitial and replacement fibrosis, fatty replacement, and ongoing myofiber necrosis.\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy in Japanese black calves is considered to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Sudden death or death after a short period of severe dyspnea occurs in calves younger than 30 days. Lesions found at autopsy include marked cardiac enlargement with left ventricular dilation, hydropericardium, hydrothorax, ascites, pulmonary edema, and hepatic and splenic congestion. Extensive myocardial degeneration and necrosis with fibrosis are present in the left ventricle, particularly affecting the papillary muscles. The right ventricle is similarly but less often involved. The clinical and pathologic pattern is reminiscent of that seen in Hereford calves with cardiomyopathy.\n\nA cardiomyopathy associated with a tightly curled (\"woolly\") haircoat in polled and horned Herefords has also been described. This cardiocutaneous syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and is now known to be caused by a 7-bp duplication in the NF kappaB interacting protein 1 gene on chromosome 18. In contrast, similar human cardiocutaneous diseases, such as Naxos disease and Carvajal syndrome, are caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins associated with composite intercellular junctions.\n\nAffected animals are identifiable at birth by their distinctive haircoat and signs of cardiac dysfunction, including arrhythmias. Some calves develop bilateral ocular keratitis immediately after birth. Most calves are found dead at <12 weeks of age. Occasionally, calves are seen to collapse and die following exertion. Even in some calves that die at 1 week of age, there are severe lesions in the ventricles consisting of necrosis, mineralization, and fibrosis of the myocardium, and are detectable at birth, an indication of their in utero onset ( Fig. 1-55A-C) .\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been reported in Holsteins.\n\nBovine generalized glycogenosis type II (Pompe's disease), although not a primary cardiomyopathy, deserves mention. Most affected animals have generalized muscle weakness. Occasional cases, however, exhibit clinical signs of left-sided heart failure, and in these, the heart is eccentrically hypertrophied. paroxysmal AV block could be related to the lesion in the common bundle, but the sinus pauses are probably the result of excessive parasympathetic activity. Affected dogs are abnormally sensitive to small amounts of acetylcholine. Deafness in the Dalmatian dog is associated with an abnormal blotchy coat color, and such animals may die suddenly. A proportion of affected dogs exhibit episodes of sinus pauses. In one case, the right atrium was fibrotic and atrophied. This was accompanied by marked narrowing of the coronary arteries, including those of the sinus node. These clinical and pathologic findings are similar to those seen in congenital deafness in humans.\n\nThe presence of an atrophic and fibrotic atrium in the previous case is the outstanding feature of the syndrome of persistent atrial standstill, which occurs in dogs (most commonly in English Springer Spaniels) and has been described in Siamese cats. The atrium is grossly dilated, and the walls are thin, transparent, and pink. Microscopically, there is myocyte atrophy and fibrosis, with a variable mononuclear cell presence. In some cases, atrophy of skeletal musculature is also evident. Given the nature of the end-stage lesions, the antecedent may be an active myocarditis (see Fig. 1-49) . The syndrome is similar in many respects to a form of muscular dystrophy in people termed Emery-Dreifuss disease.\n\nSick sinus syndrome occurs in Miniature Schnauzers, West Highland White Terriers, and Dachshunds, and it is familial in Miniature Schnauzers. Prolonged sinus pauses cause syncope.\n\nDefects of the conduction system of Alaskan sled dogs that died suddenly during the Iditarod race included marked fibrosis or fatty infiltration of the sinus node, AV node, AV bundle, and bundle branches, and focal scarring of the left ventricle. These pathologic changes may have led to fatal dysrhythmias.\n\nEquine grass sickness (equine dysautonomia) is suspected to be a clinical form of botulism. The neurodegenerative changes noted in terminal parasympathetic ganglionic neurons in the heart, which include chromatolysis and vacuolation, may account for the tachycardia noted in this disease.\n\nVentricular pre-excitation, a rare cause of weakness, syncope, or congestive heart failure in dogs and cats, can result when sinus node impulses bypass the normal conduction system via accessory pathways (bundle of Kent, James fibers, Mahaim fibers, or intranodal tract) to cause premature ventricular activation. \n\nThe clinical and electrocardiographic features of primary conduction system disturbances are well documented, but comparatively rare. The clinical signs are primarily intermittent collapse, and sometimes sudden death. Electrocardiography may show a variety of abnormalities, such as sinoatrial arrest, second-or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, AV dissociation, left or right bundle branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (rarely), and ventricular tachycardia. It should not be forgotten that many if not most dysrhythmias are secondary to more or less extensive myocardial degeneration, necrosis, inflammation, or neoplasia, particularly when in close proximity to the conduction system. In contrast, reports on the gross and microscopic examination of cases of primary conduction system disturbances are remarkably sparse. This may be due in part to negative pathologic findings in some cases, or to time and effort required to adequately examine the conduction system. When an abnormality of the conduction system is suspected, tissue samples from the appropriate regions should be collected as part of the postmortem (see Examination of the heart, previously). The use of special stains such as Masson trichrome and phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH) assist in highlighting the presence of excessive fibrosis and the relative paucity of contractile elements in the cells of the conduction system, respectively. For purposes of comparison, it is advisable to have a reference set of blocks of the conduction system from normal animals.\n\nSudden unexpected death, sudden episodes of viciousness or seizures have been associated with AV nodal, or common bundle degeneration, particularly in the Doberman Pinscher. Note that the presence of mineralized cartilage or osseous metaplasia in the central fibrous body in close proximity to conduction tissue is a normal finding in large-breed dogs at all ages. The common bundle is fibrotic, degenerate, and in some cases replaced by fat. In most cases, there is myointimal proliferation in arterioles in this region, possibly leading to ischemia of the common bundle. A similar phenomenon has been observed in other breeds, including the German Shepherd dog.\n\nThere is also a syndrome of sudden death in outwardly healthy, nonsyncopal young German Shepherd dogs that is suspected to be hereditary in nature. Affected animals die unexpectedly during sleep or during rest following exercise. Ventricular tachycardia is the most common arrhythmia, the frequency of which increases during rest when the heart rate is slowest, and ends in ventricular fibrillation. The underlying defect is suggested to be regional paucity of sympathetic nerves in ventricular myocardium.\n\nHereditary stenosis of the common bundle has been observed in cases of syncope and sudden death in Pug dogs. Electrocardiographically, such dogs have intermittent sinus arrest and paroxysmal second-degree AV block. The sinus node, the AV node, and the bundle branches are normal. The Histologically, the cell type is predominantly mature myocardiocyte in type in a variant of rhabdomyoma, but cells in rhabdomyomas are more typically large, vacuolated, glycogen rich, with scant myofibrils, and resemble Purkinje cells; cells with fine cytoplasmic strands extending from the nucleus to the peripheral cytoplasm are referred to as \"spider cells.\" Fibrosis can be extensive, and the connective tissues may be impregnated with iron and calcium salts.\n\nAngioleiomyomas have been recently recognized in cattle (10-129 months of age) in Japan. These tumors were previously diagnosed as schwannomas (neurofibroma), hemangiomas, leiomyosarcomas, or rhabdomyosarcomas. Angioleiomyomas are characteristically located subendocardially in the right or left ventricle, involve the valve complex (valves, chordae tendineae, papillary muscles), are well circumscribed and project into the ventricular lumen. Two histologic patterns coexist in each tumor to varying extents. The first pattern is of interlacing fascicles of spindle-shaped cells, the second of uniformly sized vascular channels. Giant cells, positive for factor VIII-related antigen, are also a feature in all tumors.\n\nMyxomas are the most common cardiac tumor in adult humans, but are rare in domestic animals; they have been reported in the dog, cat, and cattle. They are believed to arise from multipotent vasoformative cells. They may originate from the endocardium of any of the 4 cardiac chambers or from the heart valves. Gross appearance is often multilobular, soft, and gelatinous. Histologically, myxomas are covered by endothelium on their surface, and are hypocellular, consisting of stellate or globular cells, blood vessels, and smooth muscle cells within an abundant myxoid matrix. Blood flow may be interrupted by these intracavitary space-occupying masses, and although they do not metastasize, they may generate emboli.\n\nPrimary cardiac chondrosarcoma occurs rarely and most probably arises from cartilaginous or similar tissue that is present in the cardiac skeleton. Of the few that have been described, one arose in the right atrium, with the others arising in the atrioventricular valves. As the tumors produce little cartilaginous matrix, a positive reaction to the presence of S100 protein is required to confirm the chondrocytic origin of the neoplastic cells.\n\nA granular cell tumor or granular cell myoblastoma has been described in the right atrium of a dog. Granular cell tumors are rare in animals but have been reported to occur in\n\nPrimary neoplastic disease of the heart in all domestic species is rare, with the possible exception of hemangiosarcoma in the right atrium of dogs (see Vascular neoplasms). In contrast, metastasis to the myocardium from primary tumors of other organs is relatively common. Primary tumors of the aortic body (chemodectomas) and of ectopic thyroid and parathyroid may arise at the base of the heart in dogs (Fig. 1-56 ) (see Vol. 3, Endocrine glands).\n\nHemangiosarcoma, a tumor of high-grade malignancy, may either arise as a primary in the myocardium, or metastasize to the myocardium, most commonly from the spleen or the skin. Characteristics of the tumor are described under Vascular neoplasms.\n\nOther primary cardiac tumors are rare, and include rhabdomyoma; rhabdomyosarcoma; angioleiomyoma; myxoma; myxosarcoma; chondrosarcoma; osteosarcoma; granular cell tumor; peripheral nerve sheath tumors, including neurofibroma; fibroma; fibrosarcoma; leiomyoma; lipomas; pericardial mesothelioma; and undifferentiated sarcoma.\n\nRhabdomyomas are anomalous formations (hamartomas) of myocardial fibers seen as one or more circumscribed but nonencapsulated nodules within the myocardium. It has been suggested that swine cardiac rhabdomyomas are not hamartomas but may represent congenital dysplasia of the perinatal cardiac myocytes with myofibrillar degeneration. However, recent evidence suggests that, at least in pigs, some rhabdomyomas are of Purkinje cell origin. This is based on the fact that the cells in question stain specifically for protein gene product 9.5, a marker for neuronal tissue and Purkinje fiber cell origin. Rhabdomyomas are rare in animals, but are most common in pigs, and have been observed in cattle, sheep, and dogs; a breed predisposition has been noted in red wattle pigs. Grossly, the nodules are gray and may be found anywhere in the heart. Those projecting into a chamber are very susceptible to hemorrhage and necrosis, and may become cystic (Fig. 1-57) . a variety of organs, including the lung, brain, meninges, and tongue. The tumor has a distinctive light and electron microscopic appearance consisting of spindle-shaped to large polygonal cells containing prominent cytoplasmic granules within lysosomes. The cells are considered to be of neural origin as nerve-specific S100 protein is present within the cytoplasmic granules.\n\nNeurofibromas (schwannomas) are either isolated or multiple benign neoplasms of peripheral nerves ( Fig. 1-58 , eFig. 1-13). Cattle are most frequently affected, with the most common sites being peripheral nerves, brachial plexus, autonomic ganglia, intercostal nerves, and cardiac nerves. The disease is usually detected only at slaughter. When the heart is involved, the tumors are single or multiple, round or nodular masses, either on the epicardial surface or within the myocardium. The microscopic appearance is of interwoven bundles or whorls of elongated cells. There may be palisading of nuclei and variable amounts of collagen present. The principal cell is probably of Schwann or perineural origin.\n\nLymphoma (lymphosarcoma) is the most common metastatic neoplasm involving the heart ( Fig. 1-59A, B) , and occurs most commonly in the cow and the dog. It may be nodular or diffuse, although the distinction is arbitrary because there is overlap of the 2 forms. In the nodular form, there are foci, primarily in the atria (particularly the right atrium), which may be up to 5 cm or more in diameter. The nodules are covered by endothelium and are therefore smooth. When beneath the epicardium, they may be difficult to distinguish from epicardial fat. They are prone to central necrosis, and this resembles necrotic adipose tissue. On section, the wall of the atrium is more diffusely thickened, is moderately soft to cut, and has a pale appearance. If squeezed, milky fluid exudes from the cut surface. Globular masses like those beneath the epicardium are also found under the endocardium projecting into the cardiac cavities. In the diffuse or infiltrating form, the myocardium appears irregularly thickened and gray-white, with the ventricular walls being especially involved. These foci or areas of infiltration blend with normal myocardium and hence are difficult to distinguish from foci of myocardial degeneration or myocarditis. If they cause some thickening of the myocardium, such lesions are to be first regarded as lymphoma and indicate the need for careful search for primary lesions elsewhere in the body. Lymphoid neoplasms are considered in detail in Vol. 3, Hematopoietic system. expansion of the elastic arteries. Elastic fibers decrease in the adventitia with decreasing vessel size. Vasa vasorum and nervi vasorum supply the adventitia and the outer half of the media. The intima and inner half of the media are avascular and dependent upon diffusion from the vascular lumen, and are thus more subject to degenerative changes than the outer media.\n\nThe microcirculation is the exchange system in which gases, nutrients, and waste products are transferred between the blood and the extravascular tissues. The microcirculation consists of vessels of <100 \u00b5m in diameter: namely, arterioles, terminal arterioles (metarterioles, precapillary sphincter areas), capillaries, postcapillary venules, and venules. This classification overlaps microcirculation and macrocirculation (arteries and veins), but is useful conceptually as will be seen in disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, which affect primarily the microcirculation. Arterioles open through precapillary sphincters or through metarterioles into capillaries in most tissues, or into sinusoids in the liver. Capillaries are lowpressure tubules, of ~8 \u00b5m in diameter, composed of endothelial cells surrounded by a basal lamina; the endothelial cells are connected by tight junctions that allow rapid passage of small molecules such as glucose. The basal lamina is a molecular sieve that prevents passage of larger protein molecules. Capillary endothelial cells possess few endoplasmic organelles, but often contain pinocytotic vesicles. Capillaries may be continuous, the most common type; fenestrated (60-80 \u00b5m fenestrae closed by thin diaphragms), as in the gastrointestinal tract and endocrine glands; or porous (without diaphragms closing the pores), as in renal glomeruli. Fenestration of the endothelial cells allows increased permeability. During tissue healing, cords of endothelial cells grow into the tissues by mitosis, develop lumina, and become functional capillaries. Undifferentiated perivascular cells, or pericytes, are ensheathed by glycocalyx that is continuous with the capillary basal lamina. Mitosis of pericytes is easily stimulated, and they may be transformed into fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells. Sinusoids are less uniform than capillaries and more permeable because there are large openings between the endothelial cells and a discontinuous basal lamina.\n\nVeins are termed small, medium, or large or, alternatively, venules, collecting veins, and great veins; all have large lumina in relation to their wall thickness. Classification of veins by wall characteristics is difficult because the layers in their walls may be absent or difficult to distinguish. Venules of >30 \u00b5m in diameter have an incomplete muscular media and thin adventitia. Venular endothelium is normally more permeable than that of capillaries and is also more sensitive to vasoactive amines, the action of which can cause leakage. In the lymph node paracortex, postcapillary venules, which are nonmuscular venules with prominent endothelium, are important sites of lymphocytic traffic. The media is of increasing thickness in medium and large veins, and the internal elastic lamina becomes more prominent. However, the adventitia is the thickest layer in veins, whereas the media predominates in arteries. Backflow of blood in veins is prevented by the presence of semilunar valves, which are invaginations of the intima into the venous lumen. Venous valves are not present in venae cavae or hepatic portal vein. Paucity of valves in veins of the head and face may contribute to incidental venous congestion in these areas.\n\nLymphatic capillaries originate in loose connective tissue, and consist of very permeable walls and endothelial cells that may lack, or have a discontinuous, basal lamina. In larger \n\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe vascular system may be arbitrarily divided into a delivery system (the arterial system), an exchange network (the microcirculation), and a removal system (the venous and lymphatic systems). Impaired function of the vascular system can be generalized, as occurs in shock, or may be localized when the supply of oxygenated arterial blood to tissue is decreased, causing ischemia. Impaired venous drainage causes congestion, and decreased lymphatic drainage of tissue fluids causes lymphedema.\n\nThe arterial system is subdivided into large elastic arteries, medium and small muscular arteries, and arterioles, with gradual transitions between these divisions. Arterial vessels are characterized histologically by walls composed of 3 layers: the internal, middle, and external tunics; or tunica interna (intima), tunica media (media), and tunica externa (adventitia).\n\nThe intima consists of endothelium; subendothelial connective tissue, which contains collagen, elastin, proteoglycan (ground substance), fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells; and the internal elastic membrane, which is the outer limit of the intima. The thickness of the intima decreases as the vessel size decreases, until the subendothelial layer eventually disappears. The internal elastic membrane is not readily distinguishable in elastic arteries because of its continuity with medial elastic tissue, but is very prominent in muscular arteries, and disappears at the level of the smaller arterioles.\n\nThe media consists of concentric layers of smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers, and the external elastic membrane. In elastic arteries, the media consists of fenestrated elastic laminae, with smooth muscle cells lying between laminae. Intercellular ground substance is especially prominent in the tunica media of elastic arteries in the horse. The elastic laminae diminish and smooth muscle predominates as vessels become more distant from the heart. The media of muscular arteries is up to 40 muscle cells thick, whereas the media of arterioles is 1-3 cells thick. Definitions of the upper limit of arteriolar diameter range from 300 \u00b5m if tissues are fixed by perfusion to 100 \u00b5m if allowed to contract, but there are no sharp distinctions between small arteries and large arterioles. The thickness of the media as seen in routine material is greatest in relation to the luminal diameter in small arteries and arterioles, and it is these vessels, particularly arterioles, which participate actively in blood pressure regulation and also bear the consequences of hypertension. Contraction of muscular arteries and arterioles upon an animal's death forces blood from the lumina, and causes longitudinal folding that appears as scalloping of the internal elastic membrane when seen in cross-section. The external elastic membrane is best defined in the large elastic arteries, and becomes indistinct in muscular arteries.\n\nThe adventitia consists of a feltwork of elastic and collagen fibers continuous with the surrounding connective tissue. The interlacing network of collagen fibers in the adventitia limits Endothelial cells aid in the regulation of inflammation and immunity through production of IL-1 and various adhesion molecules, which moderate adhesion and hence emigration of leukocytes. The most important adhesion molecule pairs are the selectins, the immunoglobulins intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and the \u03b22 and \u03b21 integrins. Endothelial cells also aid in regulation of cell growth by production of growth stimulators (platelet-derived growth factor, colony-stimulating factor, and fibroblast growth factor), and production of growth inhibitors (heparin, transforming growth factor-\u03b2). Endothelial cells produce basement membrane, and are capable of contraction. The endothelium is a semipermeable membrane that can also transport metabolites, including proteins through the cytoplasm via pinocytotic vesicles. Weibel-Palade bodies, rod-shaped cytoplasmic organelles that store von Willebrand factor, serve as ultrastructural markers of endothelial cells.\n\nSubendothelial connective tissues consist of various types of collagen, elastin, proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminin, and thrombospondin. Of these, fibrillar collagen is the most potent stimulus for platelet adhesion and activation; collagen also activates the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Fibronectin, or \"molecular glue,\" normally functions to stabilize cell-to-cell and cell-to-substrate attachments, but also becomes crosslinked to fibrin and helps to anchor hemostatic plugs.\n\nMild endothelial injury, as occurs in the course of inflammation, may be apparent histologically as hypertrophy of endothelial cells (\"reactive\" cells). As well, increased vascular permeability may lead to insudation of plasma proteins, including fibrinogen, into the subendothelial area, and hence contribute to vascular hyalinosis. Because the intima and inner media depend upon diffusion of metabolites from the vascular lumen for their nutrition, such subendothelial deposits may impair the viability of smooth muscle cells and contribute to degeneration, or fibrinoid necrosis, of vessel walls. Thus the endothelial barrier must be preserved to maintain a normal environment for medial smooth muscle cells. Necrosis of endothelium, which may be caused by a wide variety of agents, leads to exposure of subendothelial collagen, a potent inducer of coagulation and platelet aggregation, and hence thrombosis. Endothelial cells at the edges of denuded areas will proliferate and migrate to repair the endothelial defect or to form an endothelial covering over (endothelialize) a mural thrombus. Severe microvascular damage, as occurs because of lipoperoxidation of endothelial membranes in vitamin E/selenium deficiency in pigs, can result in hemorrhage and organ failure.\n\nVascular smooth muscle cells are important both as effectors of vasoconstriction and dilation, and as cells capable of synthesizing basement membrane, collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans of the extracellular space. In response to growth factors derived from platelets and monocyte/macrophages, smooth muscle cells of the media migrate through fenestrae of the internal elastic lamina to the subendothelial area where, as \"myointimal\" cells, they proliferate and are responsible for organization or collagenization of deposits, including thrombi. Examples of endoarterial organization and arterio-occlusive disease are discussed later in this chapter. In common with other muscle cells, medial smooth muscle cells respond to an increased workload by hypertrophy. Medial hypertrophy is a prominent consequence, as well as a cause, of pulmonary hypertension. Sustained vasoconstriction, as is induced by ergot (Claviceps purpurea) or fescue grass (Festuca arundinacea, Festuca eliator) poisoning, can lead to gangrene of the lymphatics, valves are present, the basal lamina is continuous, and walls consist of 3 ill-defined layers; an internal elastic lamina is usually absent. The thin-walled veins and lymphatics are more susceptible to compression and occlusion, are more often involved by inflammation in adjacent tissue, and are more liable to neoplastic invasion than are the thicker-walled arteries.\n\nEndothelium and smooth muscle, the main components of vessel walls, play important roles in all types of vascular disease. A wealth of information is accumulating about the important properties and reactive capabilities of these seemingly simple cells. For example, in addition to maintaining a permeability barrier between blood and tissues, the endothelium is recognized as the largest paracrine organ in the body. It produces anticoagulants, procoagulants, fibrinolytic agents, prostanoids, connective tissue components, adenosine, and a host of other substances. Vascular homeostasis is maintained by complex interactions among endothelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets, each of which produce vasodilators and vasoconstrictors and can interact to inhibit or promote thrombosis.\n\nVascular endothelial cells, as well as forming the thromboresistant monolayer lining of the vascular system, mechanically insulate the circulating blood from the highly thrombogenic subendothelial materials. The thromboresistance of the endothelium is normally maintained by a balance between antithrombotic and thrombotic factors; stimulation of excessive prothrombosis can lead to clotting and thrombosis, whereas excessive antithrombosis can lead to ineffective hemostasis and bleeding (eFig. 1-14).\n\nAntithrombosis is normally accomplished through \u2022 Binding and inhibition of thrombin via activation by thrombomodulin of protein C and protein S, via accentuation of antithrombin activity by heparin-like molecules, and via the presence of \u03b1 2 -macroglobulin \u2022 Inhibition of platelet aggregation through elaboration of prostacyclin (PGI 2 ), a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and a vasodilator, and by adenosine diphosphatase (ADPase)-mediated conversion of pro-aggregating ADP to adenine nucleotide platelet inhibitors \u2022 Promotion of fibrinolysis by synthesis of tissue plasminogen activators Procoagulant activities include: \u2022 The presence of minute amounts of tissue factor (tissue thromboplastin) in endothelial cells, further production of which can be stimulated by endotoxin and by cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor \u2022 Synthesis and secretion of von Willebrand factor, needed for adherence of platelets to subendothelial components, and secretion of platelet activating factor, an activator and aggregator of platelets \u2022 Inhibition of fibrinolysis through release of plasminogen activator inhibitors In addition to their role in hemostasis, endothelial cells participate in modulation of blood flow and vascular reactivity by production of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (nitric oxide); endothelin, a vasoconstrictor; angiotensin converting enzyme, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II; and prostacyclin. Endothelial cells modulate the actions of various vasoconstrictors (catecholamines, serotonin, arginine, vasopressin) and vasodilators (histamine, leukotrienes, adenine nucleotides), and in concert with the endothelium-derived factors can thereby allow blood vessels to rapidly adapt to changes in hemodynamic conditions.\n\nThe balance between thrombosis and antithrombosis\n\nThe balance between thrombosis and antithrombosis\n\nRelease of tissue factor from subendothelium after endothelial cell injury.\n\nRelease of tissue factor from subendothelium after endothelial cell injury. capillaries. They may also connect with coronary arterioles to form direct connections between the coronary arterioles and the cardiac chambers. Areas of myocardium in which the Thebesian vein system is richly persistent are randomly distributed, and the true nature of the defect may be overlooked because of the tortuous aneurysmal dilation of the affected coronary artery. Injection studies are necessary to demonstrate the extent of the anastomosis. \n\nArteriosclerosis literally means \"hardening of the arteries,\" and is more fully defined as chronic arterial change consisting of hardening, loss of elasticity, and luminal narrowing resulting usually from proliferative and degenerative, rather than inflammatory, changes of the media and intima. The term atherosclerosis is applied to lesions of arteriosclerosis in which degenerative fatty changes also occur. Atherosclerosis is the most common and important type of arteriosclerosis in humans, and the terms can thus be used interchangeably with little loss of meaning when discussing this species. In domestic animals, arteriosclerosis is common, but of little clinical importance, and atherosclerosis is rare. Arteriosclerosis develops slowly in animals, its extent and incidence being greater in older animals. The disease may become so widespread in individual animals that microscopically normal vessels may be difficult to find. The sclerotic vessels are usually not accompanied by significant disturbances of blood flow, although ischemic change, especially of brain and heart, may be seen. Well-developed lesions may be good sites for thrombus formation in animals when thrombogenic circumstances prevail.\n\nThere is a predilection for the abdominal aorta and points of arterial branching, but it is also seen in peripheral and pulmonary arteries and in the thoracic aorta. The extensiveness of the lesions is very variable, so that there is no clear differentiation between a permissible aging change and a pathologic process. The nature of the insult (or insults) to the vessel walls that result in sclerosis is not known, although there are numerous possibilities. Hemodynamic factors probably contribute, especially to development of plaques about the orifices of arterial branches.\n\nArteriosclerotic plaques produce a slight thickening and wrinkling of the intima and are white, well delineated, and oval to linear in shape. They can be found microscopically in many animals in which they are not visible to the naked eye. Their presence in peripheral, including coronary and cerebral vessels, can be correlated with arteriosclerosis of the abdominal aorta. extremities; fescue toxicosis in cattle (summer syndrome) is caused by infestation of the grass by the endophyte Neotyphodium (Acremonium) coenophialum, which produces the ergopeptide alkaloids, ergovaline, ergosine, and ergonine. Along with the other components of the vessel wall, smooth muscle cells may be involved in degenerative and inflammatory changes, as described later, and contribute to fibrinoid necrosis of the wall.\n\nNormal aging changes of vessels include intimal thickening resulting from proliferation of myointimal cells and accumulation of their products, deterioration of medial elastic fibers, medial fibrosis and loss of medial smooth muscle, and accumulation of ground substance in the media. These slowly progressive changes are usually of little consequence given the large functional reserve of the vascular system, but do lead to loss of resilience of the vessel walls and may cause vessel wall thinning, stretching, and hence increased tortuosity.\n\nMinor variations occur in the course and distribution of arteries among individuals of a species, but these are of little significance except possibly in surgical procedures.\n\nArteriovenous fistula, the communication of an artery and vein that bypasses the capillary system, is a defect that may arise developmentally or be acquired subsequent to physical trauma, inflammatory necrosis involving adjacent vessels, neoplastic infiltration, or rupture of an arterial aneurysm into a vein. Fistulas occur in dogs, cats, horses, and cattle, but are uncommon. Clinically, fistulas most commonly occur in the extremities and appear as a pulsating, fluctuant swelling in which there is a palpable thrill and a machinery-like bruit on auscultation. In general, arteriovenous fistulas cause decreased peripheral resistance and increased venous return to the right heart. When 20-50% of the cardiac output is shunted through the fistula, high-output cardiac failure can occur. The veins involved are usually thick-walled (\"arterialized\"), may be dilated and extremely tortuous, and may have intimal sclerosis. Hepatic arteriovenous fistula (congenital hamartoma) occurs in dogs and cats, and can cause portal hypertension, portocaval shunts, and ascites (see Vol. 3, Liver and biliary system).\n\nThebesian veins connect the cardiac chambers, between the trabeculae carneae, with the myocardial sinusoids and intimal lesion, are common in the aorta and large arteries of domestic animals, especially ruminants and swine, and humans. The streaks, which are soft, smooth, nonelevated lesions ranging from pinpoint size up to several square centimeters, are rarely visible grossly unless the aorta is stained with a fat stain such as Sudan IV, which stains the lesions bright orange. Streaks and plaques may coexist in the same area, but fatty streaks also occur in areas in which plaques do not occur; thus, the role of fatty streaks in the genesis of atherosclerosis is unresolved. The major features of atherosclerosis are shown in eFig. 1-15.\n\nMultiple pathogenetic influences can contribute to the development of plaques. The various events and theories of development of atherosclerosis have been unified in the \"response to injury\" hypothesis. Endothelial injury or dysfunction can occur as the result of hyperlipidemia, with the cholesterol present in low-density (LDL) and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) seen as a primary culprit. Additional risk factors in humans are genetics, hypertension, smoking, obesity, inactivity, and diabetes mellitus. Immunologic mechanisms, toxins, and viruses may also damage endothelium. Infectious agents, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, have been proposed as contributing to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in humans, but there is no evidence to date of a similar link in dogs or cats.\n\nEndothelial injury leads to platelet adhesion, monocyte adhesion and infiltration, and smooth muscle migration and proliferation, as discussed above under Arteriosclerosis. The involvement of various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are also considered to influence the development of the atheromatous plaque. The feature added in atherosclerosis is insudation of lipid, which is seen as extracellular lipid, often with acicular clefts or as intracellular lipid in \"foam cells.\" The lipid-laden foam cells that are characteristic of both fatty streaks and atheromatous plaques may be either activated macrophages or smooth muscle cells; macrophages predominate in streaks, whereas smooth muscle cells predominate in the fibrous cap of plaques. Endothelial cell dysfunction is emerging as an endocrinopathy that may contribute to the effects of atherosclerosis through impaired ability of endothelial cells to produce endothelial-derived relaxing factor and through increased production of endothelin.\n\nAtherosclerosis develops commonly only in the pig among domestic species. Fatty streaks and atheromatous plaques develop in the aorta, extramural coronary arteries, cerebral and iliac arteries, as in man, and the plaques may cause considerable stenosis of vessels in swine 8-12 years of age. The extent of lipid deposition can be influenced by feeding extraordinary diets containing much lipid, including cholesterol, but the atheromas rarely reach the degree of development seen in humans, and they do not lead to occlusive thrombus formation, which usually requires softening and ulceration of the atheromatous plaque. The initial deposition of lipid occurs in the proliferated smooth muscle cells, which show signs of degeneration and which may become foam cells. Macrophages also appear, containing lipid. Fat may be demonstrable extracellularly, presumably released by degenerate cells. Deposits of cholesterol and mineral, not extensive, may be associated with softening of larger atheromatous plaques. However, except in pigs fed high-fat diets, lipid is usually a minor component of the predominantly fibromuscular plaques.\n\nOf the domestic animals, the deposition of cholesterol and other lipids in the arteries in more than trace amounts occurs The initiating lesion(s) and the evolution of plaque formation are not fully elucidated. Microthrombi composed chiefly of platelets are deposited at natural sites of turbulence or of endothelial denudation, and may initiate the lesion. Platelets secrete platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, and other mitogens; PDGF stimulates migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Alternatively, the initial change in the vessel wall may occur as the result of a nondenuding insult to the endothelium; endothelial cells themselves produce several mitogens, including PDGF.\n\nHistologically, the internal elastic lamina shows an early distinctive change, becoming irregular in outline, partially duplicated, and fragmented or discontinuous. Smooth muscle cells migrate into the intima from the media to function as do fibroblasts outside of arteries; these intimal smooth muscle cells produce most of the connective tissue matrix of the intimal plaque, including collagen, elastic tissue, and proteoglycans. In young plaques, or the deeper portions of older ones, the smooth muscle cells (\"myointimal cells\") are numerous and intimately mixed with collagen, elastic fibrils, basement membrane, and proteoglycans as the so-called musculoelastic layer. In large and older plaques, a more superficial elastic hyperplastic layer may be recognized by a more compact arrangement of collagen and elastica with relatively few cells. This lamination of plaques is not always clearly evident, and its development may depend on the age of the lesion as well as on the segment of vessel involved, whether chiefly muscular or chiefly elastic. Falk T, et al \n\nAtherosclerosis is of little practical importance in domestic animals, but is primarily of interest for the development of animal models of the human disease. The atherosclerotic susceptibility of animals varies; rabbits, chickens, and pigs are atherosensitive, whereas dogs, cats, cattle, goats, and rats are atheroresistant. Swine and nonhuman primates are usually considered to be the best large-animal models of human atherosclerosis, and genetically modified mice are proving to be valuable in the elucidation of the contribution of single factors to the pathogenesis of the disease. In humans, atherosclerosis and its complications of myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Atherosclerosis affects the large elastic arteries (aorta, iliac) and the large and medium caliber muscular arteries (carotid, coronary, femoral). The essential lesion is the atheroma or fibrofatty plaque, which is a focal, raised, intimal plaque with a core of lipid (predominantly cholesterol and its esters) covered by a fibrous cap. Complications of plaques include mineralization, ulceration, superimposed thrombosis, intraplaque hemorrhage, and aneurysmal dilation. Fatty streaks, another type of fatty 57.e2 eFigure 1-15 Diagram of essential features of atherosclerosis.\n\nLarge elastic arteries and large/medium muscular arteries\n\nSub-intimal atheroma-fibrofatty plaque\n\nUncommon in domestic animals\n\nMineralization/ ulceration/ thrombosis of the plaque\n\nis present in identifiable smooth muscle cells of the media or free in the interstitium as droplets or crystals. The deposition of lipid in the internal layers of the media leads to disruption of the internal elastic lamina and involvement of the intima. Substantial deposits of lipid may lead to eccentric enlargement of the vessel. Associated with the lipidosis, and possibly as a response to it, there is progressive proliferation of fibrous connective tissue. Beginning with the formation of fine fibrils in and about the areas of lipid deposition, the fibrosis is progressive and may eventually completely transform the structure of the wall. The connective tissues become hyalinized and relatively acellular and may be heavily impregnated with salts of calcium and iron, present as granules, large aggregates, or crystalline plaques. Atheromatosis of the degree described above in dogs is rare. Clinical consequences of severe atherosclerosis appear to be infrequent in dogs, even though the vessels most severely involved are those of the heart, brain, and kidney. Occasionally, however, as in humans, rupture of the atheromatous area into the lumen with thrombosis or even widespread lipid embolism has been observed.\n\nThe morphology of atherosclerosis differs in dogs and in humans; in dogs lipid is present in the intima, but is primarily located in the media and adventitia of atherosclerotic arteries, however, in humans, lipid is present primarily in the intima ( Fig.  1-63A, B) . The term \"xanthomatosis\" has been applied to the canine condition in the past, but its use is inadvisable as it may cause confusion with the human condition of primary xanthomatosis (type II hyperlipoproteinemia), in which there is premature atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, but also xanthomatous infiltration of the myocardium, dermis, and other organs with an associated granulomatous reaction. A similar condition in other animal species is referred to as xanthomatosis, and is characterized by the presence of lipidladen foam cells in subcutaneous or intracutaneous accumulations known as xanthomas. A familial hyperlipoproteinemia occurs in lipoprotein lipase deficient cats, and results in the formation of xanthomata in a variety of organs; atherosclerosis is not a feature of this condition. only in dogs (Figs. 1-60 to 1-62), and then almost always in association with hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus. In dogs, hypercholesterolemia is chiefly related to hypothyroidism, but even in thyroidectomized, cholesterol-fed, hypercholesterolemic experimental dogs, only occasional dogs classed as \"hyper-responders\" developed atherosclerosis, perhaps as a result of an increased proportion of cholesterol-rich VLDL. A breed predisposition to atherosclerosis in Miniature Schnauzers may be the result of idiopathic hyperlipoproteinemia. The deposition of lipids in dogs begins in the middle and outer layers of the media and occurs more extensively perhaps in the small muscular arteries than in the large elastic ones; if present, aortic lesions occur as intimal plaques. The veins are normal. The vascular changes can be severe enough to be seen on gross inspection. The vessels are enlarged, less pliable than normal, and their walls are thickened and ill-defined because a hyperplastic adventitia merges irregularly with surrounding tissues. Projecting into the lumens of the vessels on cross-section are tiny yellow-brown nodules. In vessels large enough to be opened longitudinally, there are numerous small yellow flat elevations that may be confluent.\n\nThe media may be greatly increased in thickness by the accumulation of lipid, most of which is in foam cells, but some \n\nArteriolosclerosis describes a heterogeneous group of arteriolar lesions that may be predominantly hyaline or predominantly hyperplastic. The major cause of these changes in vessels in humans is hypertension, but the pathogenesis of the lesions in domestic animals is often not determined. Endothelial damage is likely the primary event in these conditions. Hyaline degeneration-the microscopic appearance of amorphous, brightly eosinophilic material in vessel walls-can occur as the result of increased vascular permeability that allows insudation of various plasma components; it includes the amyloid deposits of renal glomeruli and elsewhere, and the fibrin and necrotic smooth muscle of \"fibrinoid necrosis.\" Fibrinoid necrosis may predate and initiate inflammatory cellular infiltration, after which the reaction would be termed arteritis. Thickening of the arteriolar wall may cause luminal narrowing and hence ischemia of the region supplied.\n\nSystemic hypertension, or persistently elevated systemic blood pressure, is an important disease of humans, and occurs as either primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension. Both forms of hypertension are typically prolonged in their clinical course, but accelerated or malignant hypertension develops in about 5% of affected individuals. Both primary and secondary hypertensions have been reported in dogs and cats; the primary form is rare, and the secondary form is more common. Hypertension may often go unrecognized as the routine measurement of blood pressure in domestic animals is problematic and as such is not part of the routine physical examination. The diagnosis of hypertension could well become more frequent as noninvasive techniques for measurement of blood pressure come into common use.\n\nRenal disease, likely the most common cause of hypertension in dogs and cats, may be either a cause or an effect of hypertension, thus determining whether a hypertensive vascular lesion is a primary or a secondary event is difficult. Primary hypertensive lesions can lead to decreased renal perfusion, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and hence more hypertension. On the other hand, primary chronic renal disease can lead to inadequate excretion of sodium and water, blood volume expansion, and hence secondary hypertension. In either case, hypertension is self-perpetuating as medial hypertrophy and hyalinization of renal arteries lead to more nephrosclerosis, further hypertension, and more pressure-induced vascular damage.\n\nSecondary hypertension is reported to occur in >60% of dogs with chronic renal disease, and may also occur in association with endocardiosis, pheochromocytoma, hyperadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, and diabetes mellitus. In cats, hypertension occurs in association with chronic renal disease, hyperthyroidism, and chronic anemia. Systemic and local hypertensions reportedly accompany acute and chronic laminitis in horses; hypertension is suggested to occur in acute and chronic laminitis in cattle. The hypertension of feline hyperthyroidism is reversible on resolution of the primary condition. The presenting sign in canine and feline hypertension may be blindness due to hypertensive retinopathy; ocular lesions include retinal vascular tortuosity, intraocular hemorrhage, and retinal detachment, the results of retinal arterial degeneration. In the face of hypertension, retinal and choroidal arterioles constrict; sustained vasoconstriction may lead to ischemic necrosis of the arteriolar smooth muscle, increased vascular permeability, hyalinization, edema, and hemorrhage. Left ventricular hypertrophy commonly occurs \n\nArteriolar hyaline degeneration is seen in swine as part of the pathologic picture in meninges in organomercurial poisoning, in various organs in edema disease, and chiefly in the heart in hepatosis dietetica and mulberry heart disease. The progression of arterial lesions in edema disease is from mural edema, to hyaline degeneration, to medial necrosis and intramural and perivascular hemorrhage, at which stage acute severe hypertension develops, likely as a result of increased vascular resistance, and hypertension in turn exacerbates vascular damage; adventitial proliferation follows in survivors. Certain strains of Escherichia coli produce edema disease toxin (Shiga-like toxin-II variant, SLT-IIv), which preferentially targets vessels of the gastric and colonic submucosa and the cerebellar folia, perhaps because of concentration of a toxin receptor, such as globotetraosylceramide, at these sites.\n\nCerebrospinal angiopathy in swine is characterized by lesions in arterioles, primarily in the brainstem, which include subendothelial hyaline deposits, degeneration or fibrinoid necrosis of the media, and perivascular eosinophilic droplets. The vascular lesions cause demyelination and malacia, and hence nervous signs, and are probably manifestations of subclinical edema disease. Kellihan \n\nMineralization (calcification) occurs quite frequently in the arteries of animals, either as a dystrophic or metastatic process.\n\nin hypertension in response to increased demand for cardiac output plus increased peripheral vascular resistance (increased afterload). Pulmonary hypertension-persistent elevation of pulmonary arterial blood pressure-can occur both as the cause and as the result of pulmonary arterial disease (see Vol. 2, Respiratory system); and, in this chapter, Arterial hypertrophy, and Dirofilariasis (heartworm disease).\n\nWidespread arterial degeneration commonly occurs in dogs with uremia, and is most frequently noted in small muscular arteries and arterioles of the gastric submucosa, tongue, colon, gallbladder, urinary bladder, and kidneys. Less frequently affected are arteries of the small intestine, myocardium, and other organs. The arterial and arteriolar lesions, in concert with degenerative capillary lesions, produce ischemic injury, and contribute to grossly observed lesions of uremia, such as uremic gastric infarction.\n\nThe arterial lesions of acute renal insufficiency consist of subendothelial deposition of fibrin, disruption of the internal elastic lamina, necrosis of medial smooth muscle, mineralization, and sometimes, neutrophilic infiltration. These lesions may be segmental or circumferential in the vessel wall. This arterial reaction is primarily degenerative rather than inflammatory, and is similar to hyaline arteriolosclerosis of benign nephrosclerosis (patchy ischemic atrophy) in humans. In chronic renal insufficiency, medial hypertrophy and adventitial fibrosis produce thickening and whorling of renal interlobular and intralobular arteries and afferent arterioles. These changes are similar to hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis of humans, which is characterized by concentric fibrosis and smooth muscle proliferation in the intima (onion-skinning); these hyperplastic changes, in combination with fibrinoid necrosis of the media of arterioles, are features of malignant hypertension.\n\nHyalinosis is commonly observed in the splenic arterioles of dogs and pigs, affecting most frequently those of the lymphatic nodules. This change is more severe in dogs with a variety of diseases, including diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, and thus may be of hypertensive origin. A hypertrophic hyalinization is regularly observed in the uterine and ovarian arteries in pregnant and postpartum animals; the elastic tissue is increased in amount, the intima is markedly thickened and hyaline, and the muscularis may be atrophic.\n\nHypertrophic hyalinization, or hyalinosis, is observed in old dogs, affecting principally the intramural coronary arteries (Fig.  1-64) and small meningeal and cerebral vessels. The hyalinization is not clearly of clinical significance in the brain but may cause multifocal intramural myocardial infarction (MIMI) and, in concert with valvular endocardiosis, lead to congestive heart failure. The hyaline deposits consist predominantly of fibrin or glycosaminoglycans or, less commonly, amyloid. Other lesions encountered in the intramyocardial arteries include musculoelastic intimal thickenings, intimal cushions, and microthrombi; these lesions occur at sites of turbulent blood flow, namely, bifurcations and branchings.\n\nSclerosis of intramural coronary arteries, predominantly of the left ventricle, occurs in dogs with congenital subaortic stenosis and occurs in the right ventricle of dogs with pulmonic stenosis. Intimal thickening resulting from fibroelastic and smooth muscle proliferation can result in myocardial infarction and scarring. The intimal proliferation may occur in response to decreased coronary perfusion pressure and increased intramural tension during systole. button-like protuberances that are seen in the aorta about the orifices of smaller branches are not primarily aortic but, instead, concentric lesions in the small efferents that project when the opened vessel undergoes elastic recoil. The plaques in the large vessels are brittle, and the smaller arteries are transformed into rigid tubes that can be fractured easily. Osseous metaplasia may also occur.\n\nIntimal bodies occur commonly in small arteries and arterioles of horses, particularly in the submucosa of the intestine, but in other organs as well. Intimal bodies appear in section as multiple irregular mineralized masses covered by endothelium and usually protruding into the arterial lumen ( Fig.  1-66) . They occur in horses of all ages, are not associated with strongyle infection, and have no apparent functional significance. These bodies apparently arise from degeneration and mineralization of subendothelial smooth muscle cells and intercellular material.\n\nThe deposition of iron salts with calcium (siderocalcinosis) is observed commonly in horses, the incidence and severity of the change increasing with age. Vessels of all types are involved and sites of predilection include the globus pallidus and internal capsule in the brain. Mostly, the deposits are without notable consequence, but secondary malacia may occur. It is also possible that malacia of other cause may exacerbate the cerebrovascular siderosis.\n\nThe mineralized nodules in the intima of the aorta in the horse are probably all healed lesions of verminous arteritis (Strongylus vulgaris migration).\n\nDystrophic mineralization, or mineralization of dying or dead tissue, occurs in areas of inflammation, degeneration, and thrombosis, and not necessarily in association with pre-existing arteriosclerosis. Metastatic mineralization occurs as the result of hypercalcemia and/or hyperphosphatemia. The distinction between dystrophic and metastatic mineralization may be artificial. In vitamin D toxicosis, for example, some maintain that degeneration occurs prior to mineralization as a result of direct vitamin D toxicity, and that hypercalcemia and mineralization are secondary events. Although the cardiovascular system is particularly susceptible to mineralization, mineralization of other soft tissues, such as the renal tubular and pulmonary alveolar basement membranes, endocardium and myocardium, and gastric mucosa, usually occurs concomitantly with vascular mineralization.\n\nVitamin D poisoning occurs in a variety of circumstances, and leads to mineralization of vessels and other tissues in association with hypercalcemia and/or hyperphosphatemia ( Fig.  1-65) . The disease can be endemic in herbivores, cattle most often, that have consumed plants (such as Solanum glaucophyllum [formerly Solanum malacoxylon], S. torvum, Trisetum flavescens, Cestrum diurnum) that contain 1,25dihydroxycholecalciferol or a related compound. Horses and pigs are occasionally poisoned by inadvertent overdoses of vitamin D in feed. Accidental poisoning of dogs and cats with a cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3 ) rodenticide is common.\n\nMineralization occurs in dogs with hypercalcemia resulting from pseudohyperparathyroidism, in some dogs in association with chronic renal insufficiency, and in hypomagnesemic cattle. Mineralization also occurs spontaneously in animals of advanced age and, in cattle especially, in a variety of chronic debilitating diseases, such as Johne's disease. In sporadic cases, the causes of mineralization are generally unknown and may be nonspecific.\n\nCalcium and phosphorus are deposited in association with extracellular vesicles adjacent to elastic fibers and, in the smaller vessels, may produce a complete, concentric ring of medial mineralization; this is the domestic animal equivalent of Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis (medial calcific sclerosis) of humans. Mineralized lesions in the aorta and pulmonary artery are usually in the form of flat plaques and are often very striking grossly; complete encirclement is seldom seen. The greyhounds, possibly as a result of arteriosclerosis and hemodynamic stresses, and can rupture with fatal consequences. Dissecting aneurysms may be of consequence by causing stenosis of the aortic lumen, as well as by rupturing. True aneurysms are composed of all, or most, of the layers of the vessel wall. Dilation of the cranial mesenteric artery may occur in the course of verminous arteritis in horses; the arterial wall is often greatly thickened, but the dilation could be termed an inflammatory rather than a true aneurysm. False aneurysms result from rupture of an artery or aneurysm and are essentially hematomas communicating with an arterial lumen; their walls are formed by the surrounding fibrous tissue. \n\nRupture of arteries as a result of physical trauma is common; spontaneous ruptures are not. The aortic lesions produced by Spirocerca lupi in dogs occasionally lead to rupture. Rupture of a uterine artery is a cause of fatal hemorrhage in aged mares at parturition and is associated with low serum copper levels. Mycotic infection in the guttural pouch in horses may lead to focal destruction of the wall of the internal carotid or maxillary artery and can lead to fatal hemorrhage. Rupture of the aorta is well known, but certainly uncommon, in the horse. The ruptures occur during periods of excitement and activity, such as racing or in stallions while breeding, and are probably related to increased intra-aortic pressure. A predisposing aortic lesion has not been definitely identified, but fragmentation, degeneration, and mineralization of elastic fibers may contribute to weakening of the wall. \"Cystic medial necrosis,\" the presence of pools of ground substance within the elastic media, has been suggested to be an underlying cause, but this change is present in the aortas of many normal horses. Intimal thickening and medial fibrosis of vasa vasora may predispose to aortic medial necrosis and rupture. Tears occur in the ascending aorta at any level from the aortic valvular annulus to the level of the brachiocephalic trunk ( Fig.  1-67A ), and range from 0.5-1 cm tears in the right coronary sinus to large transverse or 3-cornered tears in the cranial wall of the aorta. Hemorrhage may occur into a number of different sites. Hemopericardium, the most common sequel to aortic rupture, leads to sudden death; hemorrhage into, and disruption of, the atrioventricular node or bundle of His also leads to sudden death; dissection through the ventricular septum and into the right ventricle (aortocardiac fistula) causes progressive right heart failure; dissection of blood along the aortic wall may lead to formation of an aneurysm, which may in turn rupture.\n\nSpontaneous rupture of the pulmonary artery also occurs in horses, but is even less frequent than aortic rupture ( Fig. 1-67B) .\n\nRupture of the aorta, pulmonary artery, or coronary artery occurs experimentally, although not as a natural event, in copper-deficient swine, and has been extensively investigated because of similarities with Marfan syndrome, an inherited disorder in the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene in man and cattle in which dissecting aortic aneurysms occur. Degeneration of elastica appears to be the basis of the vascular lesions of copper deficiency, and is due to a deficiency of a copper-containing enzyme, lysyl oxidase, which is responsible for cross-linking of collagen and elastin. Similarly, feeding \u03b2-aminoproprionitrile to pigs, rats or turkeys causes dissecting aortic aneurysms and skeletal changes, an experimental model known as lathyrism, but is due to inhibition, rather than deficiency, of lysyl oxidase.\n\nAn aneurysm is a localized abnormal dilation of any vessel. Aneurysms are of most importance when they affect the aorta; they occur most commonly in humans as a complication of atherosclerosis, but are infrequent occurrences in domestic animals other than turkeys. On the basis of their gross appearance, aneurysms may be classified as berry, saccular, fusiform, or dissecting. In a dissecting aneurysm, blood enters the wall of an artery through an intimal tear, dissects between medial layers, and creates a cavity within the arterial wall. A dissecting aortic aneurysm (dissecting hematoma, or acute aortic dissection) is one manifestation of aortic rupture in horses, and may precede fatal aortic rupture. Dissecting aneurysms occur in the coronary and renal arteries of young, male, racing (Fig. 1-69 ) arise from thrombi in the dilated left atrium in cases of cardiomyopathy and cause paraparesis of acute onset; the clinical signs of aortic trifurcation obstruction, referred to as the 5 p's, are pain, paresis, pulselessness, poikilothermy, and pallor. Arterial thromboembolism occasionally occurs as a result of congenital cardiac defects and the formation of intracardiac thrombi. Emboli commonly arise from the cardiac valves in cases of vegetative bacterial endocarditis. Thrombi that develop in animals undergoing extended anesthesia can result in fatal pulmonary microthromboembolism, a common occurrence in humans, but a condition that is seldom recognized in domestic animals. Pulmonary thromboembolism may well complicate a variety of conditions, such as cardiac or renal disease, physical trauma, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hyperadrenocorticism, and neoplasia, but be underdiagnosed as a cause of morbidity.\n\nThrombosis is by far the most common antecedent to embolism, but emboli other than thromboemboli occasionally occur. Venous air embolism is a rare complication of pneumocystography, laparoscopy, or cryosurgery; an air trap develops in the right ventricle and may cause fatal blockage of circulation. Foreign bodies, such as pellets or bullets, may be embolic and occlude major vessels such as the aorta. Larval and adult parasites, such as strongyles and heartworms, may be embolic in the arterial system, especially if killed by therapy, and may cause arterial occlusion plus a granulomatous response. Emboli of neoplastic cells can result in distant metastases. Fibrocartilaginous embolism can result in necrotizing myelopathy in dogs, pigs, and humans ( Fig. 1-70) . Fractures of bones, especially of those of the pelvis, and trauma of soft tissues can result in fat embolism; death may occur because of embolization of the central nervous system. Embolic fat may also originate from rupture of fat-laden hepatocytes. \n\nThe 3 major predispositions to thrombosis are 1. Injury to endothelium, for instance, via infectious, toxic, or immunologic mechanisms 2. Altered blood flow, as occurs with stasis or turbulence 3. Hypercoagulability of the blood, which may result from increased concentrations of activated procoagulants, increased numbers or stickiness of platelets, or decreased concentrations of inhibitors such as antithrombin in the nephrotic syndrome. The relative contribution of each of the above 3 features (Virchow's triad) may vary. Endothelial injury, by itself, is the major cause of thrombosis, especially in the heart and arteries. Stasis must usually be combined with endothelial damage and/or hypercoagulability to induce thrombosis.\n\nThrombi are of importance because they occlude the vessel at the site involved ( Fig. 1-68) , and because pieces of the thrombus break off giving rise to emboli that may occlude vessels distal to the site of thrombosis. Arterial occlusion is of significance in organs with an end-arterial blood supply, such as the kidney, because of the absence of collateral circulation and the development of infarction. Simultaneous occlusion of a large number of pulmonary arterioles or arteries by thrombi can lead to right heart failure (cor pulmonale) and death. Even in areas with extensive collateral circulation, blood flow in vessels that are not thrombosed may be compromised by the release of vasoactive substances, such as serotonin and/or prostaglandins from the thrombus.\n\nSpecific causes and examples of thrombosis abound. As discussed later, thrombosis is a common complication of arteritis. Specific examples of thrombosis, namely, aortic-iliac thrombosis in horses and disseminated intravascular coagulation, are discussed later.\n\nThromboembolism occurs in a variety of conditions and species (eFig. 1-16). In verminous arteritis in horses, emboli of well-organized and well-vascularized fibrous tissue, occasionally containing hemorrhagic or degenerate areas. Proximal to these organized masses, large unorganized thrombi are often present. The tunica intima is obliterated by the occlusive masses, except for the internal elastic lamina, which usually remains intact. The tunica media is largely unaffected, except for ischemic necrosis of the media in greatly distended arteries or under thick plaques. The pathogenesis of the lesions is unknown. The lesions may result from organization of strongyle-related thromboemboli, or from progressive enlargement and organization of spontaneously developing fibrous intimal plaques. \n\nIt may be defined as a pathologic activation of the coagulation system that leads to generalized intravascular clotting involving, in particular, arterioles and capillaries. The process may be acute, subacute, or chronic, and may be localized or generalized. Macrothrombosis does not usually develop in this disorder. The terms \"consumption coagulopathy,\" \"defibrination syndrome,\" and \"consumptive thrombohemorrhagic disorder\" are also used because of the massive consumption of coagulation factors that occurs and that may be sufficiently severe for hemorrhagic diathesis to result. A wide array of agents and conditions will initiate coagulation (Box 1-1), either by \u2022 Causing widespread endothelial damage and thus exposing thrombogenic subendothelial collagen, or \u2022 Directly activating the coagulation cascade via the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. Exposure of monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells to disease agents or mediators will cause expression of tissue factor (tissue thromboplastin) on the cell surfaces and activation of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, and is likely a predominant pathway of DIC. As well as leading to expression of intravascular tissue factor, inflammation promotes coagulation by eliciting the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules on intravascular cell surfaces, and by downregulating the fibrinolytic and protein C anticoagulant pathways. Thrombin can in turn promote inflammatory responses, leading to further vascular injury. Stasis of blood flow and plasma hyperviscosity are other factors that may contribute to DIC.\n\nMany of the agents listed in Box 1-1 may initiate DIC by more than one route. For example, gram-negative bacterial endotoxin can cause \u2022 Endothelial damage (either directly or via mediators such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor), which exposes subendothelial collagen and leads to activation of platelets and Hageman factor \u2022 Activation of the complement cascade and hence platelet activation \u2022 Direct activation of Hageman factor and hence the intrinsic pathway\n\nAortic-iliac thrombosis causes exercise intolerance and hindleg lameness (intermittent claudication) in affected horses. The condition is seen most frequently in racing Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds, especially young males. The oldest lesions are located at the aortic quadrifurcation and in the distal portions of the femoral and internal iliac arteries ( Fig. 1-71, eFigs. 1-17,  1-18) , and consist of partially or completely occlusive masses kallikrein-kinin system; generation of kinins contributes to increased vascular permeability, hypotension, and shock. When coagulation is initiated, activated Hageman factor simultaneously converts plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin cleaves fibrinogen/fibrin to produce fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products that inhibit thrombin activity, fibrin polymerization, and platelet aggregation. A negative feedback system normally exists between thrombosis (coagulation) and fibrinolysis (anticoagulation) in which thrombin helps convert plasminogen to plasmin to cause fibrinolysis and hence limit thrombosis. In addition, a dynamic equilibrium exists between production of tissue plasminogen activator and production of plasminogen activator inhibitors by endothelial cells.\n\nThe clinical manifestations of DIC are protean and vary with the organ(s) in which thrombosis predominates and the severity of a hemorrhagic diathesis. Clinical presentations include shock, organ failure, hemorrhage, or hemolysis depending upon the relative activation of thrombin and plasmin and hence the dominance of thrombosis or hemorrhage. Hemorrhage is usually only seen in animals that survive acute episodes with thrombosis and shock, or in those reacting to a moderate procoagulatory stimulus. Perhaps the most common result of acute DIC is shock, which is due to reduced venous return to the right heart, plus systemic and pulmonary arterial hypertension resulting from thrombosis. Specific examples of DIC include \u2022 The generalized Shwartzman-like reaction (GSR) (bilateral hemorrhagic renal cortical necrosis, induced experimentally by timed injections of endotoxin), which is seen as a cause of oliguric renal failure in septicemic or endotoxemic postpartum cows \u2022 Hemorrhagic adrenal necrosis (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome) seen in septicemic calves \u2022 Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MHA) (an intravascular fragmentation anemia) seen in septicemic calves \u2022 Acrocyanosis and gangrene seen in the extremities of calves recovering from septicemia \u2022 The hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), in which coagulation is combined with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure; a similar syndrome is seen in Greyhound dogs with idiopathic cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (\"Alabama rot\"). Animals that die with DIC may have petechial to ecchymotic hemorrhages on mucosae and serosae and in the skin, and may have variable thrombotic or hemorrhagic involvement of internal organs. Histologically, microthrombi may be associated with congestion, edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis. Microthrombi are most easily detected microscopically in capillaries of brain, renal glomeruli, adrenals, lungs, and myocardium, but may occur in any organ. They consist primarily of fibrin (hyaline thrombi), platelets (granular thrombi), or of fibrin degradation products (hyaline globules or \"shock bodies\"); pulmonary alveolar hyaline membranes are also said to be a form of hyaline microthrombi. Because fibrinolysis is an ongoing process that continues after death, most microthrombi are lysed within 3 hours of death and may not be found if postmortem examination is delayed. With routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, microthrombi appear as homogeneous pink masses in dilated small blood vessels. Identification of microthrombi is aided by the use of special stains such as Martius-scarletblue, which stains fibrin red, or phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH), which stains fibrin purple. Even with special stains, incompletely polymerized fibrin is difficult BOX \u2022 1-1 \u2022 Leukocyte damage, which results in tissue factor (tissue thromboplastin) release Viral infections are postulated to induce DIC by viral- or antiplatelet antibody-mediated platelet aggregation, by causing endothelial damage, and by causing Hageman factor activation by immune complexes. Also, in feline infectious peritonitis for example, hepatic necrosis impairs macrophage clearance of activated clotting factors and may potentiate the coagulation defect. Another important pathophysiologic event that accompanies activation of coagulation is activation of the cardiorespiratory system to adjust to the hypoxia of higher altitudes. There are species differences in the hypertensive response to hypoxia; sheep and dogs are hyporesponders, humans are intermediate, whereas cattle and pigs are hyperresponders and are prone to develop hypertensive heart failure at altitudes of ~2,500 meters and above. There are also variations within species, and some cattle react dramatically to degrees of hypoxia that only mildly inconvenience others. Young cattle are more susceptible than adults, and the morbidity rate is highest in animals exposed to high altitudes for the first time. In animals imported from low altitudes to about 3,500 meters, the incidence of severe pulmonary hypertension approaches 50%, whereas in herds maintained at such altitudes for many generations, high-altitude disease may not affect >2%. The different morbidity rates are probably attributable to natural selection in the resident population.\n\nCattle exposed to critical altitudes, or experimentally to comparable degrees of hypoxic stimulation, develop a severalfold increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance that may gradually be reduced to nearnormotensive levels when the animals are returned to low altitudes. A distinctive feature of the pulmonary vasculature in cattle is the inherently well-developed muscular media of the arteries and veins with diameters as small as 20 \u00b5m, which implies an unusual potential for vasomotor activity. Hypoxiainduced vasoconstriction leads to work-induced hypertrophy of the muscular media of pulmonary arteries and arterioles, and hence hypertension, and may be compounded by reaction hypertrophy that occurs in response to increased arterial pressure. In cattle affected with high-altitude disease, there is uniformly prominent hypertrophy of the muscular media of pulmonary arteries and arterioles, and usually adventitial proliferation around pulmonary arteries of all sizes. The activation of platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b2 receptor-JNK1 signaling may initiate this proliferation. The hypertension may also cause endothelial damage, thrombosis, intimal proliferation, and medial mineralization, especially in elastic pulmonary arteries. Newman JH, et al. High \n\nCongenital heart diseases that feature increased pulmonary arterial pressure (hypertension) and increased blood flow (hyperperfusion) often occur with left-to-right shunting of blood, such as a large ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus. Pulmonary arterial hypertension, which may even lead to reversal of the shunt and cyanosis (Eisenmenger's syndrome), produces pulmonary arterial constriction and hypertrophy, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and sustained pulmonary hypertension by means of a number of arterial responses. These responses range from persistence of the normal thick muscular wall configuration of fetal life, to acquired lesions that are the response to hypertension. These to demonstrate. Red cells that impinge on fibrin strands in the microcirculation may fragment; these red cell fragments (schistocytes) may be detected within blood vessels in histologic sections as well as blood smears, thus serving as indicators of DIC.\n\nHypertrophy of arteries may affect one or all components of the arterial wall. High-altitude disease of cattle, described later, is a result of hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial constriction and subsequent hypertrophy that lead to pulmonary hypertension and eventual right heart failure (cor pulmonale). Various cardiac anomalies cause pulmonary arterial hypertension and hyperperfusion, which result in pulmonary arterial hypertrophy and additional pulmonary hypertension. Arterial hypertrophy occurs in collateral vessels in response to the extra load they carry after occlusion of the artery that usually supplies an area. A specific form of hypertrophy occurs in the pulmonary arteries of cats and is described later. Systemic arterial involvement in the hypertension associated with chronic renal disease is described previously. Thrombosis has not been observed, but adhesion of endothelial surfaces across the lumen occurs, providing sinuous channels and an appearance similar to that of an organized, recanalized thrombus. Frequently, the arterial hypertrophy is accompanied by fibromuscular hyperplasia in the pulmonary parenchyma and around alveolar ducts. Similar pulmonary arterial lesions have been described in cats infected with the parasites Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Dirofilaria immitis (Fig. 1-73) . Browne LE, et \n\nwall with concomitant vessel wall damage as indicated by fibrin deposition, collagen degeneration, and necrosis of endothelial and acquired lesions include prominent medial hypertrophy, intimal proliferations that may be obliterative, disruption of elastic laminae, adventitial fibrosis, and plexiform lesions (vascular occlusion by myointimal proliferations containing irregular vascular channels). These changes may be mediated by increased expression of various mediators, such as matrix metalloproteinases and endothelin-1. In the early, cellular, phase of the lesion, migration of medial smooth muscle cells through the internal elastic lamina and into the intima, possibly in response to a chemical attractant, such as endothelial cell-derived growth factor, is followed by their conversion to myofibroblasts and production of ground substance, collagen, and elastin, which produce marked intimal thickening. Aged mature lesions become less cellular, myofibroblasts revert to smooth muscle cells, and thin elastotic septa separate wide vascular channels; these channels may be thrombosed. As the pulmonary vascular lesions progress, the arteries may dilate and their walls undergo fibrinoid degeneration. Together, these lesions constitute \"plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy,\" which in its more severe manifestations is an end-stage irreversible arterial condition that is associated with a poor prognosis, even if the underlying cardiac anomaly can be corrected surgically.\n\nOf the acquired heart diseases, there is increasing evidence that valvular lesions of the left heart, such as canine LAV valvular endocardiosis, can lead to pulmonary hypertension and right-sided congestive heart failure. With this in mind, it should not be surprising to expect recognition of pulmonary hypertension in other species accompanying acquired chronic left heart valvular disease. Connolly DJ, et al. Right-to-left \n\nPulmonary medial hypertrophy and hyperplasia commonly occur in cats, but are of no clinical significance even when very severe and generalized. The change is seen with equal frequency in specific-pathogen-free and conventional cats; displays no age, sex, or breed predilection; and appears to be normal anatomic variation in cats. Pulmonary hypertension does not result from the vascular change, right ventricular pressure does not increase, nor does the right ventricle hypertrophy. The most severely affected vessels may be grossly visible on the cut surface of the lung and through the pleura when the lungs are collapsed, and are even palpable in some cases. The histologic spectrum of arterial changes ranges from mild sporadic ( Fig.  1-72 ) or generalized hypertrophy of the tunica media, to marked medial hypertrophy and hyperplasia with concomitant intimal proliferation and severe luminal encroachment. 1-2), although its origin remains undetermined in many cases.\n\nsuch as mercury poisoning and mulberry heart disease, and has been excluded from this classification. The terms vasculitis and angiitis are used interchangeably and may be used in preference to the more specific term arteritis, because arteries, capillaries, and veins may be involved simultaneously in some conditions. Also, the wall of the vessel may be obscured or obliterated by inflammatory changes, precluding definitive classification. The consequences of vasculitis depend upon the size, numbers, and types of vessels affected, and upon the degree of obstruction caused, as noted under Arterial thrombosis and embolism. Vasculitis in general and specific forms of arteritis will be discussed in this section; phlebitis and lymphangitis are discussed in the sections Veins and Lymphatics, respectively.\n\nVasculitides may be classified according to the size of the blood vessels involved (large, medium, small) , the histologic smooth muscle cells. The fibrillary, homogeneous, or granular eosinophilic material observed by light microscopy and referred to as \"fibrinoid\" consists of fibrin, immunoglobulins, complement, and platelets. Degenerate collagen and smooth muscle also contribute to increased eosinophilia of the vascular wall. Thrombosis may occur because of endothelial injury and initiation of coagulation. The above changes in the blood vessel wall distinguish vasculitis from perivascular infiltration with inflammatory cells. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, or macrophages may predominate in vasculitis, and the predominant cell type may be used to classify the vasculitis. Neutrophilic vasculitis may be further subdivided into leukocytoclastic, in which fragmented neutrophil nuclei or \"nuclear dust\" are present, and nonleukocytoclastic, in which there is little nuclear dust. The predominant cell type may vary over the course of the vasculitis, as the condition becomes chronic or resolves .\n\nVasculitis is an important component of a wide variety of inflammatory diseases, both infectious and noninfectious (Box BOX \u2022 1-2 encountered most often in bacterial pneumonias, adjacent to abscesses, in purulent meningitis, in local lesions of aspergillosis and mucormycosis, and in acute metritis, especially if complicated by necrobacillosis. Fungi of the family Mucorales have a distinct affinity for arteries and produce necrotizing, thrombotic arteritis.\n\nVasculitis may also develop from within the vessel as a result of endothelial injury by infectious agents and/or immune reactions. Endothelial damage and exposure of subendothelial collagen leads to activation of Hageman factor, and hence activation of complement, kinin, and plasmin systems, and to increased vascular permeability and inflammation. Infectious agents may cause endothelial damage either directly or through the actions of various toxic products, such as endotoxins of gram-negative bacteria, or exotoxins of bacteria such as Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. Mannheimia haemolytica endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] ) can directly damage endothelial cells; such damage may be reduced or increased by the activity of neutrophils, depending on the concentration of LPS present. The mechanism of LPS-mediated damage may involve prostaglandins or production of oxygen radicals by endothelial cells. In the absence of LPS, M. haemolytica leukotoxin may contribute to endothelial damage. In the case of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, rather than endotoxin causing endothelial damage, cytotoxicity is apparently caused by a 104 kDa hemolysin. Histophilus somni lipo-oligosaccharide has been shown to cause cytotoxicity and apoptosis of bovine endothelial cells through the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. Many viruses are endotheliotropic, for example, the viruses of equine arteritis, infectious canine hepatitis, canine distemper, Hendra virus, African swine fever, and classical swine fever (see Box 1-2).\n\nImmune reactions are primary causes of vasculitis in domestic animals, but appear to be less important than in man.\n\nType III hypersensitivity reactions, or Arthus reactions, cause necrotizing vasculitis by the deposition of immune complexes in vessel walls, usually in association with the endothelial basement membrane. The complexes fix complement, and complement fragments attract neutrophils that release lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals (superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, hypochlorous acid) in the process of phagocytosing immune complexes, and hence cause necrosis. As the Arthus reaction matures, neutrophils diminish and mononuclear cells, including plasma cells, predominate. The morphology of immune-complex-mediated vasculitis can be modified by the relative concentrations of immune reactants or secondary mediators; increases in antibody or complement concentrations can change an Arthus-like reaction to a Shwartzman-like reaction. Immune complexes can be found in vessel walls in a variety of immune-mediated conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Aleutian disease of mink, feline infectious peritonitis, and systemic coronavirusassociated disease in ferrets. However, even though immunoglobulins or immune complexes are found in the walls of affected vessels, this is not definitive proof that the immune reaction caused the vasculitis. Conversely, the absence of immune complexes from a vessel wall lesion does not rule out immune-complex vasculitis, because immune reactants can disappear rapidly. The underlying lesion in porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) is necrotizing systemic vasculitis, which has a predilection for skin and kidney, and is thought to have an immune-complex origin; porcine characteristics of the lesion, or clinical effects. However, many cases overlap in their morphologic and clinical manifestations, and are simply termed \"systemic necrotizing vasculitis.\" Improvement in the classification of necrotizing vasculitides will require further characterization of causes and of the spectrum of immune-mediated changes in vessels. Until such time, the use of accurate morphologic descriptions of vascular lesions is preferable to placing vasculitides, especially those of known cause, in such ill-defined categories as \"polyarteritis nodosa.\" The wide range of lesions observed probably reflects the variety of antigens or other agents involved, the intensity and chronicity of antigenic exposure, the relative contributions of immune-complex versus delayed-hypersensitivity reactions, the genetic variation among individuals, and the stage of development at which the lesion is observed.\n\nVasculitis may be of considerable significance in the pathogenesis of a condition, usually because of the occurrence of thrombosis, ischemia, and infarction ( Fig. 1-74) . As well as having local effects resulting from thrombosis and infarction, arteritis may affect distant organs, as occurs when obliterative pulmonary endoarteritis leads to congestive heart failure in dogs infected with Dirofilaria immitis. (The term endoarteritis is used in preference to endarteritis to avoid implying that end arteries are primarily affected.)\n\nArteritis of hematogenous origin occurs in the course of conditions such as septicemias and bacterial endocarditis. The primary injury may be to the endothelium and intima or it may, when the organisms localize in the vasa vasorum, affect first the adventitia and outer lamellae. The arteritis in pigs with septicemic salmonellosis, erysipelas, or classical swine fever is conspicuously expressed cutaneously as erythematous areas of purple discoloration on the ears, perineum, snout, and venter, which, if the animal survives, may become necrotic and slough. Lesions with this basis may also occur in other organs, and indeed are often seen as infarcts in the spleen in erysipelas and classical swine fever. In affected portions of vessels, the endothelium swells and proliferates, and vessel walls undergo acute fibrinoid necrosis. The formation of thrombi in these areas in turn gives rise to infarcts and necrosis.\n\nVasculitis arising by extension of inflammation and infection from adjacent tissues may occur, especially if the original inflammatory process is suppurative or necrotizing. It is antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and other immunologic irregularities similar to Kawasaki disease in humans.\n\nAn idiopathic vasculopathy occurs in kenneled and racing Greyhound dogs (Alabama rot), involving skin and occasionally kidneys. Deep, slowly healing cutaneous ulcers occur as the result of fibrinoid arteritis, thrombosis, and hemorrhagic infarction. Renal lesions include acute necrosis of glomeruli and of afferent arterioles, glomerular capillary thrombosis, and acute tubular necrosis. The pathogenesis of the condition is thought to be the result of the effects of Shiga toxin from E. coli O157:H7 producing a variant of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome.\n\ncircovirus 2 antibody titers were excessively high in PDNS pigs in a case-control study.\n\nCell-mediated type IV, or delayed hypersensitivity, reactions may be involved in some types of vasculitis in which there is lymphocytic predominance, such as the arteritis of malignant catarrhal fever and of Border disease. In malignant catarrhal fever, the vasculitis is characterized by accumulations of principally lymphocytes and fewer macrophages in the adventitia and intima of affected small and medium arteries and veins of the alimentary tract, eye, kidney, liver, lung, and brain; neutrophils and plasma cells are rare. Lymphocytes may later invade the media, although adventitial infiltration continues to predominate, and there may be medial myocyte necrosis with variable amounts of fibrinoid degeneration and endothelial hyperplasia; thrombosis may be seen in advanced cases. There is a possibility of, but little direct evidence for, direct viral cytolysis in malignant catarrhal fever.\n\nVasculitis in humans has been associated with a variety of drugs (see Hypersensitivity vasculitis). Examples of hypersensitivities in dogs include itraconazole, ivermectin, allergy immunotherapy (hyposensitization) injections, and ibuprofen.\n\nGenetic predisposition to vasculitis occurs in a number of dog breeds, for instance, Beagle (\"Beagle pain syndrome\"), Greyhound, Chinese Shar-Pei (\"Shar-Pei fever\"), German Shepherd dog, Bernese Mountain dog. Vasculitis may be precipitated by vaccination or infection, but is more often of obscure cause. Arteritis may be found as an incidental \"background\" lesion in clinically normal animals. For example, mild idiopathic arteritis and intimal thickening occurs in extramural coronary arteries in 5-10% of young Beagle and mixedbreed dogs, which can complicate the interpretation of lesions in dogs used in arterial toxicity studies.\n\nA more severe, febrile syndrome, variously named Beagle pain syndrome, canine juvenile polyarteritis syndrome, or idiopathic canine polyarteritis, occurs in Beagles and other breeds. In this syndrome, necrotizing arteritis affects the coronary, mediastinal and cervical spinal arteries, resulting in thrombosis, infarction, and hemorrhage as well as progressive atrophy of temporal and cervical muscles; amyloidosis occurs in some chronically affected dogs ( Fig. 1-75) . The syndrome appears to be immune mediated; some affected dogs have to describe a stage in the vascular reaction in which mononuclear cells surround the vessel, but the term is now little used.\n\nMicroscopic polyangiitis (hypersensitivity vasculitis, microscopic polyarteritis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis) affects smaller vessels in humans, namely, arterioles, capillaries, and venules in skin, mucous membranes, lungs, brain, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and muscle. Suspected causes include many common drugs such as penicillin, microbes such as streptococci, heterologous proteins, and tumor antigens. The reaction often occurs 7-10 days after exposure to the stimulus; remission usually follows removal of the agent. Lesions typical of leukocytoclastic vasculitis are seen. Because larger arteries are spared, macroscopic infarcts are uncommon. Hypersensitivity vasculitis appears to be the basis of some cases of hemorrhagic purpura in horses; other causes of subcutaneous edema and mucosal hemorrhages, such as equine viral arteritis, equine infectious anemia, and equine ehrlichiosis, must also be considered. Trimethoprim-sulfadiazine and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole have caused hypersensitivity vasculitis in dogs. \n\nEquine viral arteritis. This disease is caused by species Equine arteritis virus (EAV), an RNA virus of the family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus, which is pathogenic only for horses and is cytopathic in equine kidney culture. Although serologic surveys indicate that infection with EAV is common in North America and Europe, clinical disease is uncommon. Most strains of EAV are avirulent, and mortality is rare in natural outbreaks. Long-lasting immunity follows recovery. Transmission of virus occurs primarily by respiratory and venereal routes during the acute phase of infection; venereally infected mares can infect nonimmune mares by aerosol transmission. Long-term carrier stallions play an important role in perpetuation and dissemination of the virus; a carrier state has not been demonstrated in mares or foals. There is some evidence for resistance/susceptibility to the severity of the disease based on the host's permissiveness of infection of CD3+ lymphocytes. The major features of the disease are shown in eFigure 1-20.\n\nThe clinical disease is characterized by fever; variable anorexia and depression; leukopenia; edema of the ventral body wall and limbs, especially the hindlimbs; skin rash, most commonly on the neck; serous, later mucopurulent, oculonasal discharge with rhinitis and conjunctivitis; and periorbital/ supraorbital edema. Dyspnea, coughing, ataxia, and diarrhea\n\nThe term \"polyarteritis nodosa\" has been applied to a heterogeneous group of arteritides, which occur sporadically in all species of domestic animals, on the basis of similarities with classic polyarteritis nodosa in humans, in which small and medium-sized arteries undergo severe necrotizing inflammation, often in a sharply segmental (nodose) pattern, and with a predilection for branching points. As all layers of the arterial wall are involved, the lesion is also referred to as \"panarteritis.\" Arterioles, capillaries, and venules are not involved, and glomerulonephritis is not present.\n\nThe only agent thus far associated with the condition in man is hepatitis B antigen, which is found in 25-40% of individuals with necrotizing vasculitis. High mortality occurred in the human disease before the advent of corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy. Polyarteritis nodosa has been reported in dogs having rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus; separation of the vasculitis component from disease syndromes is of problematic value. Also, as noted previously in the section Vasculitis, a more appropriate term for idiopathic vasculitides is probably systemic necrotizing vasculitis rather than polyarteritis nodosa, which has tended to become a catchall term.\n\nA wide variety of clinical and pathologic manifestations occur in polyarteritis nodosa as described in man and domestic animals. Although occasionally associated with the death of an animal, lesions are also noted in otherwise normal animals at slaughter. Renal, coronary, hepatic, and gastrointestinal vessels are perhaps most commonly involved ( Fig. 1-76) . Arterial lesions at all stages of development, namely, acute, healing, and healed, may occur simultaneously in one individual and even within the same vessel.\n\nThe acute lesions are often typical of immune-complexinduced arteritis, and inflammation and necrosis of the arterial wall may be segmental or circumferential. Thrombosis may occur and lead to infarction and hemorrhage. As the reaction progresses, neutrophils are replaced in the media by mononuclear cells, and fibroplasia may result in grossly visible fibrous thickening of the wall. The vascular lumen may be obliterated by organization of a thrombus plus intimal proliferation. The term \"periarteritis\" has been used in the past intestine and lungs. The arterial lesions occur in many organs but are perhaps most consistently present in the gut and adrenals. Infarction is most common in the intestines, particularly in the cecum and colon. Massive necrosis of lymph nodes also occurs. Extensive necrosis of the adrenals may result from direct viral injury and infarction. Diagnosis is made through detection of seroconversion or more commonly, identification of the virus in the presence of compatible lesions. Differential diagnoses for EVA include diseases caused by other viruses (equid herpesvirus 1, equine adenovirus, influenza A virus, equine infectious anemia virus, African horse sickness virus, Hendra virus, Getah virus), plus purpura hemorrhagica, septic shock, and poisoning by the toxic plant hoary alyssum (Berteroa incana). African horse sickness. African horse sickness (AHS) is a vector-borne disease of solipeds, and occasionally of dogs and camels, caused by species African horse sickness virus (AHSV), family Reoviridae, genus Orbivirus, that is closely related to bluetongue virus. The disease is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, from where it spreads to southern Africa and occasionally northern Africa. It has also extended on occasion through the Middle East as far as India, and apparently with climate change, the vector has become established in southern Europe. Its importance lies in the extreme lethal potential of the infection in susceptible horses and the very wide distribution of the competent insect vectors.\n\nThe vectors of AHSV are primarily Culicoides biting midges, particularly Culicoides imicola. Transmission by mosquitoes or ticks is of minor importance. AHSV requires an ambient temperature of \u226515\u00b0 C to replicate and be transmitted by Culicoides. Historically, in enzootic areas south of the Sahara, outbreaks of disease occurred in seasons when nocturnal biting insects were active, outbreaks subsiding shortly after the first frosts. It is possible that, in climatically suitable areas, transmission might occur throughout the year. Annual recrudescence poses the question of reservoirs for over-winter persistence; the natural reservoir remains unknown, although the zebra is most likely. Even in districts where AHS occurs annually, the distribution tends to be limited to low-lying areas such as valleys, swamps, and areas of summer rain.\n\nAfrican horse sickness is primarily a disease of the horse and its close relatives, but a wide range of species is susceptible to the virus experimentally, including goats, guinea pigs, mice, ferrets, and rats. The major features of the disease are shown in eFig. 1-21. The horse is the most susceptible to infection and to illness; the mortality rate in susceptible populations of horses may be as high as 95%. The mortality rate in mules (~80%) is less than that in horses, but greater than that in the are less frequent. Pregnant mares often abort during or shortly after the febrile period, probably resulting from myometritis and decreased progesterone production by a hypoxic placenta. Specific lesions are present occasionally in aborted fetuses, and include necrotizing vasculitis, and inflammatory foci in various organs. Newborn foals may succumb to interstitial pneumonia. There is also a necrotizing vasculitis in the placenta.\n\nThe virus is pathogenic to endothelial cells and causes panvasculitis, that is, inflammation of veins, lymphatics, and arteries. Following initial replication of the virus in macrophages, endothelial cells are invaded beginning 3 days after experimental aerosol infection. As inflammation progresses and neutrophils damage the internal elastic lamina, medial cells are invaded. The most severe edema occurs at days 6 and 7 when phlebitis, lymphangitis, and capillary damage are most pronounced. Arterial necrosis peaks at day 10, when edema has largely disappeared. The vascular lesions will resolve if the horse survives. Antibody appears to play little role in the pathogenesis of the disease, in contrast to the immune-complex component of some other viral vasculitides.\n\nThe gross lesions of the disease, in addition to the changes observed clinically, consist principally of hemorrhages and edema. Petechial hemorrhages are found on all serous membranes, in the substance of the lungs, and in the gastric mucosa. Larger hemorrhages may be present in the adrenals. There is excessive fluid that contains much protein and some strands of fibrin in all serous cavities. As much as 10 L may be present in the pleural and peritoneal cavities. The connective tissues and mesenteries of the body cavities are saturated with edema fluid, and the wall of the gut may be thickened by edema. Enteritis, hemorrhagic, or diphtheritic in character, usually more severe in the large than in the small intestine, is regularly present. The lungs are more-or-less severely edematous.\n\nCharacteristic microscopic lesions occur focally or segmentally in the media of small muscular arteries ( Fig. 1-77) . The smooth muscle cells undergo necrosis and are replaced by hyaline or fibrinoid material. There is edema of the wall and adventitia and infiltration of leukocytes, chiefly lymphocytes, the nuclei of which undergo fragmentation with necrosis. The endothelium and intima may have been repaired so that thrombosis is unusual; thrombosis may, however, occur in the \n\nFour clinical syndromes: and in resistant species such as donkey and zebra. The mortality rate is ~70%. The pathogenesis of the signs and lesions is related to sites of viral replication. Virus is found early and develops to highest titer in spleen, lymph nodes, lung, and the large intestine; the titer in myocardium is low. Viral infection causes degeneration and loss of endothelium in myocardial and pulmonary capillaries, with resulting increased vascular permeability, edema, hemorrhage, and microthrombosis. Vascular permeability of pulmonary capillaries may be increased through the action of inflammatory mediators released by activated intravascular macrophages.\n\nGross lesions observed at autopsy depend largely on the clinical form of disease. In the pulmonary form, the most characteristic changes are edema of the lungs and hydrothorax ( Fig. 1-78A) . In very acute cases, edema and mottled hyperemia of the lungs are seen, whereas in cases with a somewhat more protracted course extensive interstitial and subpleural edema are also present, but hyperemia is less evident. Other lesions commonly observed are periaortic and peritracheal edematous infiltration, diffuse or patchy hyperemia of the glandular fundus of the stomach, hyperemia and petechial hemorrhages in the mucosa and serosa of the small and large intestines, subcapsular hemorrhages in the spleen, and congestion of the renal cortex. All the lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, especially those in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The pericardial sac may contain variable amounts of fluid, and numerous petechial hemorrhages occur in the pericardium. Cardiac lesions are usually not conspicuous, but epicardial and endocardial petechial hemorrhages may sometimes be evident.\n\nIn the cardiac form, the most characteristic lesions are the edematous infiltration of the subcutaneous, subfascial, subserous, and intermuscular tissues. Only the head and neck may be involved, but in more severe cases, the edema also involves lower parts of the neck, brisket, and shoulders ( Fig. 1-78B ). Hydropericardium is a constant finding, the pericardial sac often containing 2 L or more of fluid ( Fig. 1-78C) . The epicardium and endocardium show numerous, almost confluent ecchymotic hemorrhages. The lungs are usually normal or only slightly engorged, and the thoracic cavity rarely contains an excess of fluid. The lesions in the gastrointestinal tract are generally similar to those found in the pulmonary form, except that submucosal edema tends to be far more pronounced. Ascites is unusual.\n\nIn the mixed form, the lesions are a combination of those observed in the pulmonary and cardiac forms. In fact, most of the fatal cases of AHS can be considered to be of the mixed form, with lesions typical of either the pulmonary or the cardiac form predominating.\n\nThe infective dose of AHS virus for dogs is large, and high infective titers are not known to be gained except by ingestion of infected horseflesh. The course of the disease in dogs is similar to the pulmonary form in horses with fever and severe respiratory distress. The mortality in dogs showing respiratory signs is very high. At autopsy, the lungs are edematous and may have some superimposed bronchopneumonia. There is much froth in the airways, copious hydrothorax in which the fluid gels on exposure, and saturation of mediastinal tissues. Histologic changes are not helpful in diagnosis or understanding of pathogenesis.\n\nThe clinical signs of AHS are usually characteristic, although AHS might be confused with equine encephalosis, Egyptian donkey. The South African donkey and the zebra are resistant. The role of dogs, and other scavenging carnivores, in the disease cycle is not known. The disease is not contagious by contact, but dogs may acquire it from eating infected horseflesh. Infection, detected by viral isolation/detection or serologically, can be common in dogs in some circumstances, but vector transmission from dogs is unlikely.\n\nIn many parts of Africa, the use of the horse, mule, and donkey is dependent on the control of AHS, but this control has been difficult to attain. The primary obstacle has been the multiplicity of antigenic types of AHSV of which there are at present 9 major antigenic types. These types have a basic antigenic relationship that may be demonstrated in the horse, but the relationship is not sufficiently close to provide solid immunity amongst types. Indeed, although all strains investigated can be fitted into one of the major types, the antigenic diversity of strains within a single type is such that very few strains are identical. This is certainly the situation in enzootic areas where a large number of different strains may be isolated during an outbreak. On the other hand, there has been close antigenic relationship between the viruses recovered during the epizootic outbreaks that occurred outside the reservoirhost range where the transmission was from horse to horse. This suggests that, although the AHSV is extremely mutable, mutations do not readily occur when the disease is transmitted from horse to horse. Recovered horses are immune to homologous challenge, and possess some immunity to heterologous challenge. Vaccines are currently available to either prevent or to lower the severity of the disease.\n\nFour clinical forms of AHS are described: pulmonary (peracute), mixed (acute), cardiac (subacute), and AHS fever (mild) forms, from most to least severe. Most cases are of the mixed form, perhaps reflecting variations in the susceptibility of the host, the virulence of the virus, or the tropism of virus for different parts of the vascular system.\n\nThe peracute or pulmonary form of the disease, the most common form in epizootics, has an incubation period of 3-5 days. Fever occurs suddenly and is of short duration, followed by the acute onset of respiratory distress. Death may occur in a few hours from pulmonary edema, and frothy fluid fills the respiratory tract and may flow from the nostrils.\n\nThe subacute or cardiac form is usually associated with infections that are not fully virulent or are encountered in animals in which infection by heterologous strains has stimulated some immunity. The incubation period is 7-14 days with clinical signs of fever lasting 3-6 days. As the fever subsides, edematous swellings appear in the temporal or supraorbital fossae and the eyelids. The swellings extend to the lips, cheeks, tongue, intermandibular space, and throat. Swelling from subcutaneous fluid may affect the upper neck and sometimes the chest and shoulders. Terminally, petechial hemorrhages usually occur on the conjunctiva and ventral surface of the tongue. The mortality rate may be as high as 50%, and is attributed to cardiac failure and pulmonary edema.\n\nAs observed above, many cases are mixtures of the pulmonary and cardiac form. Initial pulmonary signs of relatively mild degree may be followed by characteristic swelling of the head and death from cardiac failure, or the cardiac form may be followed by sudden onset of dyspnea and pulmonary edema.\n\nThe mild clinical form of the disease, AHS fever, may not be noticed in outbreaks. It is characterized by remittent fever lasting for a week or so. This is the form of the disease to be expected in animals with immunity to heterologous strains the virus is a constant and major threat to domestic pigs. Originally limited to sub-Saharan Africa, the disease has appeared in southern and western Europe, most recently in Georgia in the Caucasus, the Caribbean, Brazil, Madagascar, and Mauritius. International spread of ASF is primarily through infected pork products in garbage fed to pigs. Once a focus of infection is established, spread is most likely to occur by direct or indirect contact. In Africa, the transmission of the virus from wild Suidae to domestic pigs is primarily by the argasid tick Ornithodoros moubata, a true biological vector and a reservoir of the virus in nature. Additional arthropod vectors exist.\n\nThe causative agent, ASFV, is an enveloped DNA virus, family Asfarviridae, genus Asfivirus. It is a relatively resistant virus that may survive in the environment or in uncooked pork products for prolonged periods. There are several antigenically different strains of ASFV. Viral virulence is classified as high, moderate, and mild. In an area free of the disease, ASF is typically seen as a peracute or acute disease with high morbidity and mortality, but as virulence diminishes with time, subacute, chronic, and inapparent forms become increasingly evident. Survivors remain persistently infected.\n\nThe immunologic response of swine to strains of ASFV is unusual and is incompletely understood. Susceptible animals infected with African field strains develop precipitating and anthrax, equine infectious anemia, equine babesiosis, purpura hemorrhagica, equine viral arteritis, equine viral rhinopneumonitis, or trypanosomiasis.\n\nDiagnosis requires virus isolation, virus identification, or serology. Carrasco L, et African swine fever. African swine fever (ASF) is an acuteto-chronic, febrile, viral disease of swine, characterized by high fever, cutaneous hyperemia, abortions, edema, and hemorrhage in internal organs, particularly lymph nodes. Species African swine fever virus (ASFV) infects only members of the Suidae family and is a harmless companion of the warthog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus) and the bush pig (Potamochoerus porcus). However, \n\nFurther reading Brown CC, et al contains ingesta, but the mucosa is apt to be inflamed and eroded. Changes in the small intestine may be absent or consist of segmental areas of congestion and mucosal petechiation. More severe intestinal changes may be found in the large intestine; these may include large areas of hemorrhage, severe congestion, and ulceration. Lesions suggesting \"button ulcer\" are very rare in this disease, presumably because few animals survive long enough for their development.\n\nThe postmortem appearance of subacute and chronic cases of ASF varies considerably. In the subacute cases that die after 3-4 weeks of illness, there may be lymph node and renal hemorrhage, an enlarged but not congested spleen, lobular consolidation of cranial lung lobes, and intestinal mucosal hemorrhage ( Fig. 1-79A, B) . Prominent features of the chronic form include fibrinous pericarditis and pleuritis; splenic and lymph node enlargement; lobular consolidation of the lungs, which may progress to necrosis and mineralization of an entire lobe; skin lesions ranging from raised hyperemic plaques to necrotic areas; swollen joints; and arthritis. The meningoencephalomyelitis and periportal hepatitis observed in the acute disease persist in the chronic disease. Lesions in aborted fetuses are inconsistent but include petechiation of placentas, skin, and myocardium, mottled lungs and liver, and anasarca. complement-fixing, but rarely neutralizing or protective, antibodies. The animals remain viremic and usually die within 7-10 days. Pigs that recover are resistant to infection with the homologous virus. In the case of infection with highly virulent ASFV, even though 10 days may have elapsed since infection, pigs typically die before development of anti-ASF immunoglobulin, probably because of the demise of antigen-presenting cells in lymph nodes, spleen, and liver.\n\nThere is no cross-protection conferred by infections by classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and ASFV.\n\nThe ASFV replicates in and activates monocytes and macrophages of various lymphoid tissues and organs, resulting in release of cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and hence causes widespread cell death through apoptosis of T and B lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue and of endothelial cells in arterioles and capillaries, accounting for the lesions of the acute disease. Activation of pulmonary intravascular macrophages and release of cytokines incites pulmonary edema, neutrophil sequestration, and formation of microthrombi in septal capillaries. It also appears that the virus modulates signaling pathways in macrophages, hence interfering with the expression of host immunomodulatory genes; this evasion of host defenses allows infections to be persistent. The major features of the disease are shown in eFig. 1-22.\n\nThe peracute form of ASF is a severe acute viral hemorrhagic fever characterized by a 1-3 day course of pyrexia, hyperpnea, and cutaneous hyperemia, with morbidity and mortality approaching 100%. However, the usual clinical course of ASF is acute. Following an incubation period of 4-10 days, there is a reduction in appetite, pyrexia, marked cutaneous reddening, dyspnea, and severe leukopenia. Pregnant sows may abort. The clinical signs in the less severe forms of the disease are variable. The signs may be a mild expression of those seen in the acute disease and may be confused easily with other diseases. There are recurring periods of pyrexia, dyspnea, growth retardation, and emaciation. Death may occur during one of the periods of pyrexia. It is important to realize that the clinical signs of chronic ASF may be indistinguishable from those seen in classical swine fever (CSF).\n\nThe ASFV tends to affect the same organs and tissues as does the CSFV. The anatomic differences tend to be quantitative and dependent on the more fulminating nature of ASF; only splenomegaly and hematoma-like visceral lymph nodes are particularly characteristic of ASF. The vascular lesions that can develop rapidly, namely, hemorrhage and edema, are apt to be more severe in ASF than in CSF, whereas the lesions that develop more slowly, such as infarction, tend to be absent.\n\nThe pig dead from acute ASF shows few or no signs of recent wasting. Gastrosplenic and renal lymph nodes are usually intensely hemorrhagic, and ecchymotic hemorrhages may be present on the serous membranes. The spleen is usually enlarged and may be markedly enlarged and friable; infarction cannot usually be recognized grossly. Pulmonary edema, not common in CSF, is present frequently in pigs with ASF. The pulmonary septa are thickened by a yellow gelatinous infiltrate. Pulmonary hemorrhage is also common. The gallbladder is often edematous, and the vessels of the wall are engorged and conspicuous. Both petechiae and ecchymoses are present on the serosal and mucosal surfaces. In some outbreaks of the disease, there are extensive pancreatic hemorrhages and necrosis. The renal changes are similar to those of CSF and consist of subcapsular petechiae. The stomach often by direct immunofluorescence, detection of ASF antibody by indirect immunofluorescence or ELISA, detection of virus genome by PCR, and virus isolation. Differential diagnoses include classical swine fever (from which ASF cannot be differentiated by clinical or postmortem examination), erysipelas, salmonellosis, pasteurellosis, and other septicemias.\n\nHistologically, infection by a highly virulent strain of ASFV causes extensive necrosis of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, whereas infection with a moderately virulent strain causes little necrosis ( Fig. 1-80A, B) . The histologic findings in acute ASF are very similar to those of CSF, but there are important differences. A major difference is that ASFV does not infect epithelium. Necrosis with karyorrhexis in lymphoid tissue everywhere is often very obvious in ASF; frank necrosis is quite rare in CSF, although mature lymphocytes are apt to be absent in lymphoid tissue. Renal tubular degeneration with amorphous casts in the medulla is frequent in ASF, but rare in CSF. In ASF, necrosis of periportal hepatocytes and infiltrating lymphocytes is common, whereas microscopic hepatic lesions are usually absent in CSF. The vascular cuffs in the brain in ASF contain much more necrotic debris than do the lesions in CSF. The degeneration of vascular endothelium and the fibrinoid arterial changes are identical ( Fig. 1-80C, D) . Vascular endothelial damage in the lung may cause thrombosis of vessels and thickening of alveolar walls. Pigs dead of acute ASF may have glomerular capillary thrombosis; surviving pigs may develop focal segmental glomerulonephritis.\n\nBecause there is no treatment or effective vaccine against ASF, rapid diagnosis is critical to disease control. A diagnosis of ASF is confirmed by detection of ASFV antigen in tissues The pathogenesis of CSF is not fully understood, but involves the effects of the virus on the immune system (lymphoreticular cells and macrophages), the vascular endothelium, and epithelial cells. The effect of the monocytotropic CSFV on the immune system varies with the stage of differentiation; mature cells degenerate, whereas undifferentiated cells respond by proliferation. CSFV replicates in macrophages in lymph nodes and lymphoid tissues and can cause depletion of lymphocytes indirectly through expression of apoptotic cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. Similarly, intestinal epithelial cell necrosis appears be the product of release of chemical mediators from activated macrophages, rather than direct viral infection. Endothelial changes are primarily degenerative but some proliferative changes occur. Damage to endothelial and other cells leads to thrombocytopenia, consumption coagulopathy, and in turn disseminated intravascular coagulation and hemorrhage.\n\nThe classic or acute form of the disease, which affects pigs of all ages, commences by entry of the virus through the mucous membranes with initial replication in the tonsillar epithelium. This is followed by spread to the cervical lymph nodes with viremia within 16 hours of infection. The virus has a propensity to replicate in cells of the immune system, particularly in lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other lymphoid aggregates, such as the spleen and Peyer's patches. After 3-4 days, the virus invades endothelial cells and epithelial cells, including those of the pharyngeal mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, pancreas, salivary gland, uterus, adrenal, and thyroid. The clinical signs are not specific and do not provide good correlation with pathologic changes, although, in the acute disease, they may be sufficient for presumptive diagnosis where the disease is endemic.\n\nSuperficially, the eyelids are frequently adherent and sticky, and the carcass is dehydrated and soiled by terminal diarrhea. The irregular erythema that can be seen in the animal when alive is less obvious, but hemorrhages, particularly in unpigmented areas of skin, may be seen. If present, they are most numerous on the abdomen and the inner aspects of the thighs.\n\nDiagnostic lesions may be sparse in CSF, especially if peracute, and it may be impossible to establish the diagnosis on the basis of the gross lesions in a single animal. The lesions most commonly present are hemorrhages in the periphery of the lymph nodes and renal petechiae (Fig. 1-81A) . The renal hemorrhages may be very few, and in all cases the kidney capsule should be removed and the surface examined in good light. Hemorrhages in the lymph nodes are more obvious; characteristically, only the periphery of the node is involved. In acute cases, this produces a distinctive bright red halo; if the case is more Classical swine fever (hog cholera). Classical swine fever (CSF) is a highly contagious viral disease of swine; it may occur as acute, subacute, chronic, or inapparent syndromes. Acute CSF is a disease of high morbidity and mortality caused by a virulent strain of the virus; low-virulence virus may cause inapparent disease. Classical swine fever is said to have developed de novo in Ohio, United States, in the early 1800s. It subsequently spread to almost all countries and is also known as swine fever, Schweinepest, peste du porc, and peste svina. Species Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) produces disease only in swine. The disease has been eradicated from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but it remains a problem in Central and South America and several European countries.\n\nCSF is caused by a Pestivirus, a member of the family Flaviviridae. Other members of the genus include bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), Bungowannah virus and border disease virus (BDV). CSFV and BVDV are closely related antigenically, and although pestiviruses other than CSFV are thought to be harmless to pigs, natural BVDV infection can cause clinical signs and postmortem lesions indistinguishable from those of chronic CSF. Under appropriate circumstances, CSFV, BVDV, Bungowannah virus, and BDV may produce transplacental infection, and hence persistent infections and congenital anomalies. The CSFV is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that replicates intracytoplasmically. Most strains do not produce a cytopathic effect in porcine cell cultures. The enveloped nature of the virus makes it sensitive to lipid solvents and to desiccation. However, the virus may persist for prolonged periods in uncooked pork products.\n\nAntigenic variation exists among strains of CSFV, and field strains vary widely in virulence. The interaction of a particular strain of virus and the host provides a range of disease syndromes. Strains of CSFV are usually classified as being of high, moderate, or low virulence, or as being avirulent. Highly virulent strains produce the features of the classic acute disease in pigs of all ages; the morbidity may reach 100%, with a mortality rate of up to 90%. Strains of moderate virulence induce subacute or chronic disease, and pigs may subsequently die or recover. In pigs infected postnatally, strains of low virulence produce few or no signs of disease and induce immunity, but may cause fetal abnormalities. Artificially attenuated strains used as vaccines are avirulent, even for fetuses. Virulence of CSFV may be unstable; virulence can increase by one passage through pigs.\n\nTransmission of the disease is usually by direct contact of infected pigs or wild boar with susceptible pigs; CSF is endemic in wild boar in parts of Europe. The virus is present in urine, feces, and lacrimal and oronasal secretions of infected pigs, as well as semen of infected boars. Even with the less virulent strains, the virus may be excreted in the urine for periods up to 3 months. The major mechanism of spread of virus of low virulence occurs from continuous virus shedding by chronic or persistently infected asymptomatic pigs. Minor modes of transmission include fomites and arthropods.\n\nClinically, classical swine fever is characteristically an acute disease of high morbidity and mortality, most animals surviving only to 14 days after showing the first signs of illness, namely, anorexia, depression, fever, and leukopenia. Persistent infection (i.e., survival of >30 days) is caused by CSFV strains of moderate or low virulence and may arbitrarily be divided into chronic and late-onset types. In chronic CSF, typical acute disease is followed by clinical improvement, the result of dead of CSF is empty except for a small amount of watery mucus and ingesta. The fundic mucosa is congested, and mild or severe erosions may be present. Specific lesions do not occur in the small intestine, but the mesentery is usually congested. It is in the colon and cecum that the virus combines with the intestinal flora to produce craterous mucosal defects, \"button ulcers,\" which are characteristic of the subacute or chronic stage of the disease. These lesions begin as sharply outlined circular areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The central area is yellow and dry. As the lesion ages, the rim, which is composed of necrotic epithelium, bacteria, and detritus, is raised above the surrounding mucous membrane, and concentric rings form as if growth were cyclic. The center of lesions sinks giving a slight diskoid shape. If this necrotic tissue and debris is removed, a deep ulcer is revealed. Growth arrest lines may be seen in the ribs of chronically sick pigs. Gross lesions are not usually present in the brain, but the brain should be removed because it is there that the histologic changes can be best appreciated. The major features of the gross postmortem findings are shown in eFigure 1-26. Microscopically, all areas within the brain may be affected, but the lesions are usually most conspicuous in the medulla, pons, mid-brain, and thalamus. The response is largely confined to the vessels and their supporting mesoderm. Many of the venules have eccentric cuffs, which are formed in part by transmural migration of monocytes. Mitotic figures and nuclear chromatin of necrotic cells are frequently present together in the cuff, as proliferation and necrosis are coexistent. Swelling and degeneration of the endothelial cells occur in the walls of the smaller vessels ( Fig. 1-82 ). All changes from slight thickening to necrosis of the wall may be seen. The lumen is often compromised by these reactions. The response of the neural parenchyma appears to be entirely secondary to the vascular lesions; often it is nonexistent or confined to minimal neuronal degeneration, or it may consist of glial nodules formed about obstructed or destroyed capillaries. If severe cerebral edema develops, there may be widespread damage to the oligodendroglia. The vessels of the eyes, choroid plexuses, and the leptomeninges are similarly involved. chronic, the halo may be the dirty brown of partially degraded hemoglobin. Less frequently, the hemorrhage in the node is diffuse. The nodal changes are generalized, but nodes most apt to show severe changes are the mandibular, colonic, hepatic, and iliac; changes in the renal lymph nodes are not useful in this context.\n\nSplenic infarction is almost pathognomonic of acute CSF. Unfortunately, the tendency for infarcts to develop in the disease varies with the strain of the virus, with reports of incidence of 1-87%. When present, infarcts occur as single or multiple, dark red, pyramidal blebs 0.5-2 cm in diameter, usually along free edges but occasionally on the flat surface ( Fig. 1-81B ). The spleen in CSF is not enlarged, as it is in septicemias, and is red-brown so that the infarcts contrast quite sharply with the meaty parenchyma. In addition to the hemorrhages of the kidney, petechiae are common in the urinary bladder (eFig. 1-24), the larynx (eFig. 1-25), the gastric mucosa, the lung, and the epicardium, in about that decreasing order of frequency. There is usually a small amount of straw-colored fluid in the pericardial sac. There may be hemorrhagic lobular pneumonia.\n\nIrregular, but sharply outlined areas of necrosis develop in the tonsils and posterior fauces.

Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF), a noncontagious vector-borne viral disease of cattle and water buffalo, is characterized by sudden onset of fever, stiffness, and lameness, usually with high morbidity and low mortality, and with rapid recovery within 3-4 days of the onset of clinical signs. The cause is species Bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), genus Ephemerovirus, family Rhabdoviridae. The disease is endemic in tropical regions of Africa and Asia and occurs as epidemics in subtropical and temperate regions of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia. In temperate climates, BEF is a disease of summer and autumn, and ceases abruptly at the first frost; the host/reservoir for overwintering or between epizootics is probably in wild ruminants. Infection usually confers lifelong immunity. The likely vectors are various species of Culicoides and mosquitoes.\n\nClinical disease ranges from almost imperceptible clinical signs to death, with considerable individual variation in an outbreak. Mild disease may be exacerbated by environmental stress, for instance, exposure causing dehydration. Disease is milder in young than in mature animals, in lean than in fat animals, in light steers and cows than in bulls, and in dry cows than in those in heavy lactation. The incubation period is usually 2-4 days. The fever may be biphasic, triphasic, or multiphasic; clinical signs are milder in early than in later phases of fever. Mildly affected animals may have fever, be lame, or be stiff for 1-2 days, and then recover completely. Neutrophilia with a left shift and concurrent lymphopenia, hyperfibrinogenemia, and hypocalcemia occur early in the course of disease. More severely affected animals are anorectic, have oculonasal discharge, and may have muscle tremors, stiffness, lameness, and patchy edema of the face or jaw. Rumen motility ceases, and the animal may be constipated. Animals in lateral recumbency are usually still able to rise. Lactation Vascular lesions usually are most severe in lymphoid tissue but may occur anywhere. The lesions vary from slight thickening of the capillary wall to fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles. As these changes develop, there is a tendency for extravasations to occur and for microthrombi to form.\n\nMicroscopic areas of infarction are common in the lymph nodes and skin, but only in the spleen, tonsil, gallbladder, and large intestine are these areas usually large enough to be grossly visible. In some cases, swelling and paleness of the capillary wall is obvious. The nuclei of endothelia in these vessels are enlarged and the nuclear chromatin is dispersed as fine dust. Less often, the endothelial proliferation is so marked as to be the most conspicuous change. In general, in acute cases the degenerative changes are most prominent, whereas in chronic ones proliferative changes are more obvious.\n\nIn the periphery of lymph nodes (the equivalent of the medulla in other species), lesions vary from slight edema and proliferation of the reticuloendothelial elements to extensive hemorrhage. It is the intermediate stages that are the most common and in which the nature of the lesion is best visualized; in these, there is necrosis of the small vessels and secondary hemorrhages and parenchymal necrosis.\n\nIn the spleen, the most pronounced lesions are in the follicular arteries, particularly those at the apex of the pyramidal infarcts. The swelling and hyalinization of these vessels may be so severe as to occlude the lumen. Survival of tissue within the infarcted area will depend on how long the infarction preceded death. Even if the spleen is free of gross and microscopic infarction, vascular changes of the type seen elsewhere can usually be found. They are often associated with perivascular hemorrhage. In addition, there is reticuloendothelial hyperplasia and absence of mature lymphocytes.\n\nThe kidney tubules often show nonspecific degenerative changes. The subcapsular hemorrhages seen grossly are the result of increased vascular permeability and erythrodiapedesis. Immune-complex-mediated mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis occurs with deposition of IgM, IgG, and C1q in mesangial, subepithelial, and subendothelial sites; infiltration of the mesangium by macrophages and later neutrophils; and ultrastructurally, the fusion of foot processes and the presence of viral particles in glomerular endothelial cells and podocytes. The major histologic features are shown in eFigure 1-27.\n\nIn utero infections can result in a variety of effects, including abortion, mummified fetuses, and stillborn piglets. Fetal abnormalities, such as ascites, petechiation of skin and other organs, hepatic nodularity, pulmonary hypoplasia, microcephalus, hydrocephalus, cerebellar hypoplasia, and hypomyelinogenesis, may also be observed. Persistently infected pigs that survive may be runts and die 2-11 months after birth. These piglets have severe thymic atrophy and pale swollen lymph nodes; some may have focal colonic mucosal necrosis.\n\nSerologic diagnosis of CSF is difficult. Antibodies to CSFV and BVDV cross-react in many assays; they may be differentiated by specific virus neutralization tests. The prescribed tests in the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Manual are the neutralization peroxidase-linked assay, fluorescent antibody virus neutralization, and ELISA. CSFV antigen can be detected in live pigs by real-time (RT)-PCR, and in formalin-fixed tissue by semi-nested RT-PCR or by in situ hybridization.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for CSF include African swine fever (clinicopathologically indistinguishable), BVDV infection, Hemorrhage, necrosis/ apoptosis of lymphoid elements.

The common name, heartwater, is derived from the pericardial effusion that is typically present in small ruminants, but sometimes absent in infected cattle. Heartwater is a major vector-borne disease of ruminants in Africa, third in importance only to East Coast fever and trypanosomiasis, but has a wider distribution than either of these. Mortalities caused by heartwater are estimated to be 3 times greater than those caused by babesiosis and anaplasmosis. The causative agent is Ehrlichia (Cowdria) ruminantium, order Rickettsiales. Isolates of E. ruminantium cross-react strongly with Ehrlichia equi and to a lesser extent with E. canis, in indirect fluorescent antibody tests. The vectors are 3 host ticks of the Amblyomma genus, principally A. variegatum, A. hebraeum, and A. pomposum. Amblyomma maculatum and A. cajennense are suitable vectors present on the American mainland. Trans-stadial transmission occurs in vector ticks; transovarian transmission is infrequent. When a tick feeds on an infected host, organisms apparently first infect and develop within gut cells. Subsequent stages of the organism continue their development in hemolymph and salivary gland, and are transferred to the vertebrate host during tick feeding.\n\nThe various strains of Ehrlichia ruminantium are antigenically similar, but differ considerably in their virulence. The various domestic hosts also differ in their susceptibility. Imported breeds of cattle, sheep, and goats are as a rule much more susceptible than indigenous breeds. There is also an important age difference in susceptibility. Calves and lambs <3 weeks of age are highly resistant to heartwater. This is a true age resistance, and it is independent of maternal immunity. Ruminants are most susceptible at about the stage of early maturity, and in the absence of treatment, mortality is expected to be ~60% in cattle and close to 100% in European breeds of sheep, although this will depend on the virulence of the infecting strain.\n\nThere also appear to be differences in susceptibility among the African antelopes. The blesbok and black wildebeest are known to be susceptible to infection without showing signs of illness. Wildlife may act as reservoirs of infection, although this is not necessary as the tick itself is a reservoir; infection survives in adult ticks for >15 months. Domestic ruminants that have recovered from the disease seldom remain as carriers of the circulating organism for >3 weeks after recovery, but it is not clear whether the agent remains in a masked form in tissues. Immunity of variable duration follows recovery, often as premunity; sterile immunity may persist for a year or more after disappearance of the organism. Immunity in natural infections is expected to be reinforced by reinfections.\n\nThe early development of the parasite is not completely understood, but probably takes place in reticulum cells and macrophages of lymph nodes and spleen in which initial bodies are demonstrable at about the fourth day of infection. Organisms are then released into the blood and parasitize vascular endothelial cells. The organism is demonstrable in capillary endothelium of brain 1-3 days after it is demonstrable in lymph nodes. Ehrlichia ruminantium parasitizes endothelial cells but is also present in the blood; the infection is readily transmissible by inoculation of blood collected during the febrile stage or shortly thereafter. The colonies (groups, clusters, morulae) of microorganisms in endothelial cells lie falls by an average of 50%, and does not usually recover to normal during that lactation. Cows in late pregnancy may abort. In very severe cases, there may be temporary or permanent paralysis of all limbs, inability to swallow, and drooling; in 1-4 days, loss of reflexes, coma, and death follow.\n\nWhether the disease is mild or severe, recovery commences quite suddenly and is complete in 95-97% of uncomplicated cases, giving rise to the name \"ephemeral fever.\" Although mortality is usually <1%, the most productive mature animals are often lost, plus there are losses of milk production, abortion losses, and temporary infertility in bulls. Other sequelae include fatal pulmonary emphysema, pneumonia, mastitis, and locomotor disturbances. The total economic loss in an outbreak can be severe.\n\nThe essential gross feature of BEF is serofibrinous polyserositis, which variously affects the synovial, pericardial, thoracic, and peritoneal cavities, and is the result of increased vascular permeability. The serosal membranes themselves are often edematous and may be hemorrhagic; the edema fluid in cavities often contains fibrin clots. Severely affected joints may be surrounded by brown or yellow gelatinous periarticular fluid that also extends along tendon sheaths and fascial planes. There may be patchy pulmonary edema, visceral and parietal pleuritis, epicarditis at the base of the heart, edematous lymph nodes in the febrile stages, and necrosis in some skeletal muscles; myonecrosis is likely the result of recumbency.\n\nHistologically, affected tissues are edematous and infiltrated by neutrophils, and may also be hyperemic and hemorrhagic. Vascular changes include endothelial swelling and hyperplasia, hyperplasia of pericytes, fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles, perivascular fibroplasia, and thrombosis of occasional vessels in muscles. Wallerian degeneration has been reported in the upper cervical spinal cord in cases with chronic paralysis, but may be secondary to trauma.\n\nThe pathogenesis of BEF is poorly understood, but is likely mediated through cytokines. BEFV \u03b11 protein is expressed in infected cells and has the properties of a viroporin, which may facilitate virus replication. Neutrophils appear to play a central, but undefined, role in pathogenesis; cattle in which neutrophils are experimentally depleted develop viremia but not clinical disease. Interferon-\u03b1, interleukin 1, and tissue necrosis factor circulate in high titer during the acute phase of BEF.\n\nThe clinical signs observed in an epizootic are usually diagnostic. The diagnosis can be confirmed by virus detection/ isolation. Serologic diagnosis may be complicated by crossreaction with antibody to Kimberley virus, an arbovirus that induces production of low levels of serum neutralizing antibody to BEFV but does not protect against BEFV. hyperemia with submucosal edema in the lower alimentary tract, but it is most pronounced in the abomasum. Petechial hemorrhages are present in the endocardium, mucosa of stomach and gut, tracheobronchial mucosa, and lymph nodes.\n\nLesions in the brain are common and account for the nervous signs that characterize the disease, especially in cattle, and for the failure of animals to recover with chemotherapy. Gross changes are inconstant on inspection of the surface of the brain. Petechial hemorrhages may be present over the cerebellum, and the choroid plexus may be dull and thickened. On slicing, petechial, ecchymotic, and larger hemorrhages may be numerous in all parts of the brain.\n\nThe microscopic lesions in the brain are reflections of parasitism and injury to small vessels, especially capillaries and venules. Either histologic sections or impression smears will show colonies of E. ruminantium visible in endothelial cytoplasm of untreated cases ( Fig. 1-85 ). There is acute inflammation of the choroid plexus with fibrinous exudate in the stroma, congestion, hemorrhage, and accumulation of inflammatory cells about the vessels. Within the brain, vascular characteristically in membrane-bound vacuoles in the cytoplasm at the poles of the endothelial cell nuclei. Colonies and organisms are pleomorphic; colonies are formed by binary fission of organisms. Organisms range in size from 0.2 to >2.5 \u00b5m and are termed small, medium, or large; each is surrounded by a double membrane, and based on their internal morphology, they may be termed elementary (electron-dense), intermediate, or reticulate bodies; usually only organisms of the same form are found within a vacuole. They can be found in sections and are present in all organs and in vessels of all calibers, but are best sought in the capillaries of the cerebral cortex in squashsmear preparations or in imprints from the endothelium of a large vessel, such as the jugular vein. Giemsa is the preferred method of staining.\n\nThe natural incubation period of heartwater is 2-3 weeks but varies considerably. In the peracute form of the disease, death occurs rapidly in convulsions without warning. The usual clinical syndrome in susceptible animals is acute, with a course of up to 6 days. There is high fever and its attendant signs, and dyspnea. As the course advances, nervous signs develop. These are especially prominent in cattle and consist of chewing movements, protrusion of the tongue, twitching of eyelids and blinking, unsteadiness of gait, circling, and a terminal convulsive phase in which there is prominent cutaneous hyperesthesia. Diarrhea is common in cattle but less common in sheep. Mild progressive anemia may develop, as may leukopenia (neutropenia, eosinopenia, and lymphocytosis) and hypoalbuminemia. In the subacute syndrome, the course is prolonged and leads either to slow recovery or to collapse and death. Animals with high natural resistance or partial immunity may show transient fever only.\n\nThe pathogenesis of the increased capillary permeability seen in heartwater is unclear; the severity of edema is often thought to be out of proportion to the numbers of infecting organisms. Production of a toxin has been suggested, but not proven; Ehrlichia stains negatively with Gram's stain, has a cell wall similar to that of gram-negative bacteria, and has been suggested to produce endotoxin. Complement and the products of arachidonic acid metabolism may play a role in the generation of vasoactive substances.\n\nThe gross anatomic changes in heartwater are the same in each ruminant species but generally are less prominent in cattle than in sheep or goats; lesions may be inconspicuous or absent in treated animals. The disease does not alter the general condition of the animal appreciably. Typical gross lesions include effusion in body cavities, hydropericardium, edema of lungs, brain, mediastinum, and associated lymph nodes, and splenomegaly, although all of the lesions rarely occur simultaneously (Fig. 1-83) . The name of the disease is derived from the hydropericardium, but this is sometimes absent. The effusion, which is serous with some fibrinous strands, is more constant and copious in sheep than in cattle ( Fig. 1-84) . The other serous cavities also contain excess serous fluid; there may be several liters in the pleural and peritoneal cavities of cattle and up to half a liter in sheep and goats. When exudation is copious, the mediastinum and retroperitoneal tissues are also edematous. The membranes remain clear and glistening. The lungs are severely edematous, especially in the peracute form. The lymph nodes of the head, neck, and cranial mediastinum especially are swollen and edematous. The spleen is almost invariably much enlarged in sheep and goats, being sometimes up to 6 times its normal size, but splenomegaly in cattle is only moderate. There is The ticks most commonly responsible for the transmission of RMSF are Dermacentor variabilis and D. andersoni; these ticks serve as vectors, reservoirs, and natural hosts for R. rickettsii. The rickettsiae are maintained in nature in a primary sylvan cycle, involving mostly small rodents. Dogs can develop a high and persistent rickettsemia, and are a potential public health danger; humans can be infected during tick removal by contact with hemolymph of engorged ticks or with tick excreta. Tetracycline therapy is effective, and dogs are immune after recovery.\n\nDogs are usually infected via the bite of infected ticks. The rickettsiae invade and replicate within endothelial cells of small blood vessels; endothelial damage is probably mediated by phospholipase A and a trypsin-like protease, of either rickettsial or host origin. There is little evidence for production of endotoxin or exotoxin by R. rickettsii. Endothelial damage leads to platelet activation and activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic systems; thrombosis in RMSF is thought to arise in reaction to endothelial damage.\n\nVasculitis in RMSF is a product of endothelial swelling and necrosis with secondary contributions from the immune and phagocytic host responses mounted by lymphocytes and macrophages, but is not primarily caused by immunecomplex formation or by cell-mediated mechanisms. The action of various mediators, such as those of the kallikreinkinin system, in addition to direct endothelial necrosis, leads to increased vascular permeability and hence edema and multifocal hemorrhage.\n\nDogs <2 years of age are predominantly affected. Purebred dogs, especially German Shepherd dogs, appear to be more susceptible than are crossbreds. Following an incubation period of a few days, clinical findings in affected dogs include, in decreasing order of frequency, listlessness and depression, high fever, history or actual presence of ticks, anorexia, myalgia/arthralgia, lymphadenomegaly, vestibular deficits, dyspnea, conjunctivitis, paralumbar hyperesthesia, edema of face and extremities, petechiae or hemorrhagic diathesis, and vomiting and diarrhea. Vasculitis may be visible by means of ophthalmoscopic examination of retinal vessels.\n\nLaboratory findings include anemia, leukopenia followed by leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time, hyperfibrinogenemia, and increased concentrations of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products. The thrombocytopenia is at least partly due to the development of antiplatelet antibodies. Serum biochemistry usually reveals hypoalbuminemia, increased alkaline phosphatase activity, and hypercholesterolemia. Increased concentrations of aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone may contribute to expansion of plasma and extracellular fluid volumes and hence edema. Edema of the medulla oblongata may contribute to cardiorespiratory depression. Death may occur in the acute stages of disease as the result of peripheral vascular collapse, hemorrhagic diathesis, and thrombosis, although fully developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an unusual event in RMSF in dogs. Necrosis of extremities may occur. Damage to the cardiovascular system, brain, or kidneys may cause death or permanent organ dysfunction; severely affected dogs may die with rapidly progressive meningoencephalitis.\n\nGross lesions include edema of ears and muzzle; ulcerative glossitis; scrotal dermatitis; petechiation of mucous membranes, caudal abdominal skin, pleura, and gastric wall; hemorrhagic colitis; and hemorrhagic lymphadenopathy. injury leads to perivascular or larger hemorrhages and accumulation of protein droplets in the perivascular space. Focal or larger areas of malacia surround the vessels and are in various stages of development from edematous disruption of white matter with glial activation to microcavitation.\n\nThe diagnosis of heartwater depends largely on the demonstration of organisms in endothelial cells in brain either in smears or section; brain biopsy can be used to establish the diagnosis in the living animal. The pCS20 PCR assay is the most reliable and specific assay for the detection of E. ruminantium in ruminants and Amblyomma ticks. Various antibody detection assays are available, including indirect fluorescent antibody, polyclonal competitive ELISA, major antigenic protein (MAP-1) ELISA, and Western blot, but often lack specificity because of cross-reactivity with closely related ehrlichiae.\n\nAmerica and southern temperate zones in Australia. As with most, if not all filarid worms, D. immitis contains the bacterial endosymbiont, Wolbachia, which is essential for the normal development of the parasite, and also contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\nThere are 40 recognized species of Dirofilaria, 6 of which have been shown to infect humans as accidental dead-end hosts. Diagnostic tests based on genomics are being increasingly used to differentiate among the Dirofilaria species infecting the host. Adults of D. repens occur in subcutaneous connective tissues of dogs and other carnivores (and rarely humans). Similarly, D. tenuis is found in the subcutaneous connective tissue of the raccoon in the southern United States. None of these 3 filarids usually develops to maturity in humans, but they may be found in cysts in various parts of the body, especially in the lungs. D. striata, a parasite of bobcats (Lynx rufus), has been reported in dogs in Florida. A species of Dirofilaria found in both dogs and humans in Hong Kong with a 94-95% homology with D. immitis and D. repens has been tentatively named D. hongkongensis.\n\nAdult D. immitis worms live in the pulmonary arteries and right heart, but they can develop in various other arteries and veins, and have been reported from a variety of unusual sites, including the eye and brain. Adult males are 12-20 cm long by 0.7-0.9 mm in diameter; females are 25-31 cm by 1.0-1.3 mm. The adult female worms are viviparous, and release microfilariae into the bloodstream; mosquitoes obtain microfilariae in blood meals. The first, second, and early third larval stages of D. immitis are obligate parasites of mosquitoes, predominantly of the genera Aedes, Culex, or Anopheles. Larvae develop to the infective stage in about 13 days in the malpighian tubules. They then migrate to the cephalic spaces of the head or to the proboscis of the mosquito and escape into a new host when the mosquito feeds. The infective larvae are about 1.2 mm long when they enter the host, and are about 5 cm long when they reach the right ventricle 3-4 months later. In the meantime, the parasites have wandered and grown in the connective tissue, chiefly those of the subcutis and muscles, finally leaving these to migrate to the heart via the veins. They mature in a further 3 months. Thus the prepatent period is 6-8 months. Adults may live for several years and microfilariae can survive in a dog for as long as 2.5 years. Adult heartworms may be found in cutaneous nodules occasionally in dogs, and rarely in cats.\n\nThe clinical diagnosis of dirofilariasis in dogs depends upon the detection of microfilariae in the blood, preferably by the microscopic examination of centrifuged sediment of lysed blood (modified Knott's test), or by a filter technique. Microfilariae of D. immitis (290-315 \u00b5m long, straight body and tail, tapered head) must be differentiated from those of Dipetalonema reconditum (270-290 \u00b5m, curved body, blunt head, most have a buttonhook tail), the adults of which are nonpathogenic and are commonly found in the subcutaneous connective tissue of dogs; these microfilariae can also be differentiated by PCR or histochemical means. The average number of circulating microfilariae per adult female D. immitis decreases as the number of adult worms increases. Hence the numbers of circulating microfilariae indicate neither the numbers of adult worms present nor the severity of heartworm disease in an individual dog. Although microfilariae are present in the blood more or less continuously, there is a tendency to periodicity, with maximum numbers occurring in the evening and in the summer, coincident with maximal activity of The prominent histologic lesion of RMSF is necrotizing vasculitis of small veins, capillaries, and arterioles, with perivascular accumulations predominantly of lymphocytes and macrophages. This lesion is seen most commonly in skin, testes, alimentary tract, pancreas, kidneys, urinary bladder, myocardium, meninges, retina, and skeletal muscle. Acute meningoencephalitis may be present. There may also be acute splenitis, acute interstitial pneumonia, and multifocal necrosis of myocardium, adrenals, and liver. A moderate degree of glomerulonephritis may be present.\n\nThe most reliable serologic test for RMSF is the speciesspecific microimmunofluorescent method. High antibody titers develop to R. rickettsii, but usually decline after 3-5 months. Direct fluorescent antibody staining of a skin biopsy is positive in up to 80% of infected dogs; coccobacillary organisms are present in endothelial cells and vessel walls. Infection may also be confirmed by PCR detection of the agent in peripheral blood. \n\nHere we are concerned with those parasites whose natural habitat is the lumen or the wall of arteries. Parasites that, accidentally or as part of their life cycle, migrate in tissues may, depending on the route they take, cause vasculitis in various organs. The chief offenders in this regard are the larvae of the genera Strongylus and Ascaris; the vascular lesions of Ascaris infestations are described under diseases of the intestine (see Vol. 2, Alimentary system and peritoneum). Angiostrongylus vasorum, which inhabits the pulmonary arteries of dogs, is described with the lungworms. Spirocerca lupi, which passes part of its history in the adventitia of the thoracic aorta, is described in its final habitat, the esophagus. (heartworm) , and is the only significant reservoir of infection. In areas where heartworm infection is enzootic in dogs, a number of other mammals may become infected, including domestic cats and wild felids, wild canids (coyotes, foxes, wolves), ferrets, sea lions, muskrats, horses, and rarely humans. If D. immitis develops to maturity in hosts other than the dog, microfilaremia is usually low or absent, and heart failure is rare. Pulmonary dirofilariasis is of considerable importance in humans because the spherical, subpleural granulomas produced may be mistaken radiographically for primary or metastatic lung tumors, leading to thoracotomy and excisional biopsy for diagnosis. Dirofilaria immitis is genetically heterogeneous and has a tropical and subtropical distribution in southern Europe, Asia, Australia, and North and South America, although its range has extended into more northern temperate zones in North worms with cardiac blood flow and valve function. Pulmonary sclerosis and hypertension slowly regress following removal of the adult worms.\n\nHeartworm disease is primarily a pulmonary vascular disease, and is characterized by myointimal proliferations in small peripheral arteries initially, and later in the large lobar arteries, especially the right caudal lobar artery ( Fig. 1-87A, B) . The fibromuscular intimal proliferations in the larger vessels produce a grossly visible shaggy or roughened appearance, a change pathognomonic of heartworm disease. The vascular reaction is to both the immature and mature adult worms, and begins as an endoarteritis with infiltration of leukocytes, primarily eosinophils. Neutrophils are also present in the arterial wall, partly in response to the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia harbored by D. immitis. The leukocytic response subsides and is replaced by myointimal proliferation that produces irregular rugose to villus projections enmeshing the worms; the myointimal proliferation occurs at sites of direct contact with worms, is likely due to mechanical irritation and endothelial damage, and is possibly mediated by platelet-derived growth factor.\n\nThrombosis may be associated with either live or dead worms, and thromboembolism, especially following adulticide therapy, may further exacerbate pulmonary hypertension; the presence of dead parasites initiates a granulomatous mosquitoes. Microfilariae are pooled in internal organs, especially the lungs, in the daytime. Fetal pups may be infected by microfilariae from the bitch and have microfilaremia, but the pups do not harbor adult worms. Cats infected with D. immitis are typically amicrofilaremic, given low numbers of adult female worms or male-only infections, hence antigen-or antibody-detection tests are required for diagnosis.\n\nOccult dirofilariasis, that is, heartworm infection without microfilaremia, occurs in 10-67% of infected dogs, primarily as a result of destruction of microfilariae by immune mechanisms (\"immune-mediated occult disease\"), but also as the result of prepatent infections, single-sex infections, and druginduced sterility of adult heartworms. Clinical diagnosis of occult dirofilariasis then rests on the findings of the indirect fluorescent antibody test, antigen detection tests, and cardiopulmonary imaging. Circulating antibodies are usually detectable only in dogs without microfilaremia.\n\nThe clinical signs of canine dirofilariasis are usually those of cardiovascular dysfunction, such as cough and tiring on exercise, which may progress to congestive heart failure. Heartworm disease is usually seen in dogs that are older than 5 years and have had continuous or multiple infections. There is a rough correlation between the numbers of worms present and the severity of the disturbance, but there are exceptional cases, and severe signs may appear in dogs with only a few worms. Clinically normal dogs may harbor up to about 30 worms, and clinically affected dogs 50 or more. Dirofilariasis in cats usually causes cough and dyspnea, but may as well cause vomiting, neurologic signs, and malaise; sudden death is another possible outcome.\n\nAdult heartworms are normally found in the pulmonary arteries and right ventricle (Fig. 1-86) , but may be found in the right atrium and venae cavae in heavy infestations. Young adult worms usually develop first in small pulmonary arteries, and progressively involve more proximal arteries as they grow. Adult worms may be found in the right ventricle if more than about 25 are present, and in the right atrium and venae cavae if there are 50 or more worms. The caudal lobar pulmonary arteries are usually the most heavily infested vessels. Right heart failure develops as a consequence of pulmonary hypertension, which in turn is the result of pulmonary vascular sclerosis. Of secondary importance is mechanical interference of the The usual route of migration of S. vulgaris is as follows. Infective third-stage larvae are ingested; exsheath in the small intestine; penetrate the mucosa and submucosa of the small intestine, cecum, and colon within 3 days of infection; and molt to fourth-stage larvae by day 7. The larval penetration of the gut can cause the formation of large subserosal hemorrhages, called hemomelasma ilei. The fourth-stage larvae, which are about 1 mm long, penetrate submucosal arterioles, migrate in or on the intima of arterioles and arteries, being constrained by the internal elastic lamina from penetrating to the media, and reach the cranial mesenteric artery, the predilection site for further development, between day 11 and 21. After 3-4 months, the larvae molt to the fifth stage (immature adults, 10-18 mm long), return to the wall of the cecum and colon via the intestinal arteries, and are encapsulated in subserosal nodules before returning to the gut lumen as adults, when the nodules rupture. The adults require another 6-8 weeks to reach sexual maturity. The prepatent period of S. vulgaris is thus about 6-7 months.\n\nVirtually all horses are infected with S. vulgaris and have arterial lesions resulting from larval migration, although the prevalence of continuing S. vulgaris infection has been reaction in the vessel wall, which may extend into the pulmonary parenchyma. Thrombi may be organized and recanalized. Pulmonary infarction is an uncommon sequel to thromboembolism.\n\nPulmonary parenchymal changes that accompany the above vascular changes include periarterial granulomatous inflammation, hemosiderosis, diffuse interalveolar fibrosis, proliferation of alveolar epithelium, and fibrous pleural thickenings. Dead worms commonly incite pulmonary granuloma formation. Adulticide therapy causes embolization of worms and resulting thrombosis and granulomatous inflammation; resolution of these lesions is underway by 6 weeks post-treatment. Proliferative intimal lesions will progressively resolve after surgical removal of adult worms; resolution of advanced, fibrotic, obstructive arterial lesions is unlikely. Severe pulmonary arterial disease often results in chronic or low-grade DIC, and hence thrombocytopenia and hemoglobinuria. Microfilariae entrapped in the lung in a state of antibody excess are surrounded by neutrophils and eosinophils, producing eosinophilic pneumonitis. This allergic pneumonitis may be the precursor of pulmonary eosinophilic granulomatosis, which is characterized by 1-8 cm diameter nodules composed of eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages, and devoid of microfilariae, plus peripheral blood eosinophilia.\n\nAdditional lesions of heartworm disease include those of right heart failure, such as chronic passive congestion of the liver, and occasionally ascites. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis occurs primarily because of glomerular deposition of immune complexes, either formed in circulating blood in a state of antigen excess, or formed in situ in the glomeruli. The intensity of the immune-complex deposition varies directly with the intensity and duration of infection and the antibody response; the immune response may be toward immature heartworms, microfilariae, or adult heartworms. Physical damage to glomerular endothelium has been attributed to microfilariae. The result of glomerular disease in dirofilariasis is proteinuria, which is usually mild to moderate in severity. Renal failure and uremia are uncommon. Microfilariae are usually of little consequence to the dog, but when they die, they may incite formation of microgranulomas in various organs, such as the lung, liver, and kidney.\n\nAberrant migration of adult heartworms into the systemic arterial circulation, a rare event, results in thromboembolism and hence signs such as hindlimb lameness and interdigital ischemic necrosis.\n\nThe vena caval syndrome (venae cavae syndrome, liver failure syndrome) is a variant of heartworm disease seen usually in young dogs in which large numbers of adult worms (100+) fill the right atrium and venae cavae, likely as the result of retrograde migration from the pulmonary arteries. The syndrome is characterized by sudden onset of weakness, anorexia, bilirubinuria, hemoglobinuria, and anemia. Shock occurs because of obstruction and decreased venous return. The mass of worms may also interfere with valve function, causing tricuspid regurgitation, which, together with pulmonary hypertension, results in decreased left ventricular preload and congestive right ventricular failure. Hepatic congestion is very severe, hepatic lymphatics may be distended, and ascites may occur. Anemia develops because of right-atrial turbulence and shear-induced mechanical hemolysis, with perhaps microangiopathic hemolysis resulting from platelet activation and fibrin formation. Azotemia develops and death usually occurs in 1-3 days. Phlebosclerosis and thrombosis in the caudal vena embedded. It is usual to find some worms, both fourth-stage larvae and immature adults, in the thrombi, but the number of worms in any location in any one case varies from a few to several hundred. Following migration of the fifth-stage larvae back to the intestine, or destruction of the larvae by anthelmintics, the intimal lesions resolve as fibrous intimal thickenings, and the luminal diameter will hence increase. The arterial wall thickness also decreases.\n\nThe lesions and accompanying worms are most common in the cranial mesenteric artery, although they are also found elsewhere, including the aorta, the renal arteries, the celiac artery and its branches, and the spermatic vessels. They may be in any branch of the cranial mesenteric artery but are concentrated largely in the right division and the colic artery, which is its continuation, and, to a slightly lesser extent, in the cranial branch and its continuation, the right colic artery. The worms are rarely found in the aorta caudal to the origin of the renal vessels; they are relatively common about the origin of the cranial mesenteric and celiac arteries, and less common again in the thoracic aorta. Although this statement on the prevalence of lesions in the thoracic aorta applies to actively thrombotic lesions containing worms, it is probable that older, warty, mineralized lesions of the type often seen in the intima of the aortic arch have this origin; they occur markedly diminished by benzimidazole and macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics. A degree of host resistance to verminous arteritis is slowly acquired under natural conditions, but horses of all ages remain susceptible to infection. Lesions range from the very common, but insignificant, tortuous intimal tracks, to the less common, but more serious, occlusive thrombotic lesions. Lesions of verminous arteritis are often incorrectly called \"verminous aneurysms,\" but these dilations are usually thick-walled resulting from inflammation and scarring, rather than thinned. Saccular or fusiform aneurysms may occasionally result from weakening of the arterial wall. Lesions occur most frequently in the cranial mesenteric artery and its extension, the ileo-cecocolic artery. This apparent larval predilection has been suggested to fit a \"random-walk\" model in which the larvae sense blood vessel curvature, rather than direction of blood flow, migrate longitudinally along arteries, and are essentially trapped in the cranial mesenteric artery because of its perpendicular connection with the aorta, a border which most of the larvae do not cross. Larvae that spill over into the aorta may be considered as aberrant and lost to their species, in that they are unlikely to return to the cranial mesenteric artery and hence to the gut.\n\nTortuous intimal tracks consist of fibrin, necrotic debris, and a mixture of inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, in the intima. The tracks become covered by endothelium, the fibrin is removed, and the tracks are converted to fibromusculoelastic thickenings. More extensive larval migration causes more extensive thromboarteritis (Figs. 1-88, 1-89) . Small mural thrombi are formed about the larvae attached to the intima, and there is a reactive leukocytic infiltration, edema, and resultant degeneration of the elastic and muscle fibers of the underlying media. The initial acute inflammation persists as long as the parasite remains but is soon accompanied by a productive connective-tissue response, initiated by smooth muscle cells from the media, with attempted organization of the overlying thrombus and the accumulation of large numbers of mononuclear leukocytes ( Fig. 1-90) . The proliferating connective tissues of the intima and adventitia may ultimately replace the normal structure of the arterial wall with the affected walls becoming solid and very thick. The luminal surfaces of active arterial lesions are always rough and covered with layered thrombi in which the parasite is found partially Onchocerciasis (parasitic aortitis). Onchocerca armillata is a parasite of the wall of the aorta of cattle, water buffaloes, goats, and camels, in south Asia and equatorial Africa. As with other filarids, O. armillata also contains the endosymbiotic bacterium, Wolbachia, whose presence is not only essential for the normal development of the parasite larvae and embryo, but also contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. Several other Onchocerca spp. are described with tendons and aponeuroses under diseases of muscle in Vol. 1, Muscle and tendon. The life cycle and vectors involved in the transmission of O. armillata are unknown; however, black flies (Simulium) and midges (Culicoides) are the intermediate hosts of other Onchocerca spp.\n\nAlthough virtually all older cattle may be infested in enzootic areas, the lesions produced are apparently not of clinical significance. The preferential site is the arch of the aorta. With chronicity, lesions extend cranially to include the brachiocephalic trunk, costocervical arteries, and brachial arteries, and caudally to include the abdominal aorta to the level of the iliac bifurcation. The intima is corrugated, and numerous sinuous tunnelings end in small nodules in the intima and media; the nodules protrude into the vascular lumen or through the adventitia. The males, which are about 7 cm long, inhabit the nodules, along with the anterior end of the female, which bears the vaginal opening, and the microfilariae, which escape into the bloodstream. The body of the female lies in the sinuous tracts, from which the complete specimen cannot be readily dissected, but its length is estimated as >100 cm. Parasitic tunnels in the inner media have a thin fibrous tissue lining without cellular infiltration. There may be acute transmural aortitis with a predominance of eosinophils, but subacute or chronic focal granulomatous inflammation is more frequent and occurs around tunnels containing dead, degenerate, or mineralized worms. The granulomas in the media and adventitia become encapsulated by fibrous tissue to form nodules of 0.5-2.5 cm diameter containing caseous material and intact and/or dead worms, and eventually dry mineralized debris. The granulomatous reaction will resolve with time, and, in very old cattle, the aortic wall becomes thinner, has a corrugated lining with irregular mineralized ridges, and may develop aneurysms up to 3.5 cm in diameter. The suggested causes of the granulomatous aortitis include hypersensitivity to the parasite, foreign body reaction to degenerate and dead onchocercal worms, and the release of toxic factors from the parasites.\n\nMicrofilariae can be found in the blood of infected animals at all times, but there is a tendency to nocturnal periodicity; infection can be detected by examination of skin snips for microfilariae. In some bulls with large numbers of circulating microfilariae, repetitive episodes of collapse and tetanic convulsion have been observed and attributed to the microfilariae. Some of the bulls showing convulsions eventually developed acute or recurrent ophthalmitis with ophthalmoscopic evidence of retinal pigmentary degeneration and other changes similar to those seen in ocular onchocerciasis in humans.\n\nfrequently in sites where active lesions occur. The lesions in the aortic bulb are located immediately proximal to the aortic valves on the cranial wall of the bulb and in the adjacent cranial aortic and caudal right aortic sinuses, but rarely in the caudal wall and the left sinus. This localization has been explained on the basis of the curve of the aortic arch and the axis of systolic ejection, which should, theoretically, provide a zone of turbulence and relatively low velocity of blood flow in the cranial segment of the aortic bulb.\n\nThe sequelae of verminous arteritis caused by S. vulgaris are varied and depend upon the location of the arteritis. Involvement of the cranial mesenteric artery is almost constant in horses, but untoward sequelae are much less common, no doubt resulting from the extensive collateral arterial circulation to the equine intestine, which may mitigate against the effects of frequent thromboembolic episodes. Colic, which is commonly caused in horses by S. vulgaris if parasite control is poor, may occur for a number of reasons: thromboembolism and intestinal ischemia or infarction; interference with innervation of the gut, resulting from pressure on abdominal autonomic plexuses; or, release of toxic products from degenerating larvae. Fatal acute intestinal infarction occasionally ensues, with ischemia of large areas of the cecum or colon. Thromboembolism of the cecal and colic arteries may also lead to mucosal ulceration and diarrhea, and occasionally death. Hematochezia has been reported in a horse as a consequence of fistulous connections between a verminous cranial mesenteric arterial aneurysm and the cecum and ileum. As a result of successful suppression of S. vulgaris by anthelmintics, drug-resistant cyathostomes (small strongyles) have supplanted S. vulgaris as the most important cause of verminous colic. Coronary arterial thrombosis and occlusion, which occurs most commonly in the right coronary artery, can lead to myocardial infarction and death; similar consequences follow the development of verminous aortic valvular endocarditis, a rare event in strongylosis. Embolism of the brachiocephalic trunk can occur and is especially significant when the emboli contain larvae that subsequently migrate in the brain causing encephalomalacia and either chronic incoordination or progressive fatal encephalitis. Renal arterial verminous arteritis and thromboembolism have resulted in renal infarction and, on rare occasions, passage of larvae in the urine. Aortic-iliac thrombosis may be a consequence of strongyle-related thromboembolism, but its pathogenesis remains uncertain. Thrombosis of the celiac artery and embolism of its branches is usually inconsequential.\n\nThe major features of Strongylus vulgaris infection are shown in eFigure 1-29.\n\neFigure 1-29 Major features of Strongylus vulgaris infection.\n\nLarvae mostly in cranial mesenteric and iliocecocolic artery survivors, the most important consequence of elaeophorosis in sheep is filarial dermatosis (sorehead), an often severe exudative dermatitis affecting the poll, face, abdomen, and lower parts of the legs, in up to 1% of sheep in enzootic areas. Stomatitis and rhinitis also occur. The lesions are due to microfilariae released by adult females located in arteries supplying the affected areas. Microfilariae can be demonstrated microscopically in the lesions, and they are responsible for intense leukocytic infiltration, chiefly of eosinophils and mononuclear cells. There is hemorrhage, vesiculation, and ulceration of the epidermis with exudation of serum and leukocytes to form crusts. These lesions have the character of an allergic reaction and are presumably related to the alien nature of the sheep as a host, because they rarely occur in deer. The skin lesions are intensely pruritic and often lead to severe selftrauma. Lesions often persist for 3-4 years and will regress spontaneously following the death of adult parasites and microfilariae. Elaeophora bohmi was found in ~6% of a sample of Austrian horses, the vessels involved being arteries and veins of the metacarpus, metatarsus, and more distal extremities. The parasites rather selectively involve the media of the vessels avoiding the intima and adventitia, although the fibrous reaction that develops may cause stenosis of the lumen. The worms are coiled and entwined amongst the tissue layers, provoking parasitic granulomas with intense infiltration by eosinophils and macrophages. In cases of longer standing, diffuse or nodular fibrous thickenings are visible and palpable in the vessel walls. Microfilariae were found in the blood of 14 of 161 horses (9%) sampled in Iran. The infection appears to be of little clinical significance. Couvillion CE, et Elaeophoriasis. The genus Elaeophora is another filarial parasite. Three species of interest are E. poeli and E. schneideri, which infect ruminants, and E. bohmi, a parasite of horses.\n\nElaeophora poeli occurs frequently in the aorta of cattle and related species in tropical areas of the Far East, but is of little clinical significance. Its life cycle is unknown. These are thread-like worms, the female of which may be up to 30 cm long. The lesions are found in the aorta and can be distinguished from those of Onchocerca armillata because the females of E. poeli are attached to the vessel by the head, with the body free in the lumen of the vessel (eFig. 1-30). The males become encysted in intimal fibrous nodules that also contain the head of the female. In light infestations, the lesions are found chiefly on the dorsal wall of the aorta about the openings of the intercostal arteries. Heavy infestations are more diffuse and may provoke a prominent fibrous thickening of the vessel wall.\n\nElaeophora schneideri is commonly found in the arteries of mule deer and black-tailed deer, as well as in white-tailed deer, domestic sheep and goats, elk (wapiti), moose, and bighorn sheep in mountainous areas of the western and southwestern United States and southwestern Canada, and in white-tailed deer in the southeastern United States. Mule deer and black-tailed deer are little affected by the parasite, and are considered the normal definitive hosts. Horseflies of the genera Hybomitra and Tabanus are the intermediate hosts.\n\nWhen the horsefly feeds, infective larvae invade the host and migrate to the leptomeningeal arteries, where they develop to immature adults that migrate against the blood flow to reside in the common carotid arteries. The parasites reach sexual maturity ~6 months later and begin producing microfilariae. Although adult worms normally inhabit the carotid arteries and their branches, they may be found in many other arteries through the body. Adult females are 6-12 cm long by 0.6-0.9 mm thick, and adult males are 5.5-8.5 cm long by 0.4-0.7 mm thick; adults live 3-4 years. Microfilariae are about 280 \u00b5m long by 18 \u00b5m thick, and are found in the capillaries of the forehead and face.\n\nWhen larvae develop in the leptomeningeal arteries of elk, moose, domestic sheep and goats, sika deer, and possibly white-tailed deer, they can cause ischemic necrosis of brain tissue, resulting in \"clear-eyed\" blindness or sudden death. In elk, adult worms in the intracranial arteries cause mechanical irritation and hence endothelial damage, intimal proliferation and fibrosis, thrombosis, and embolism, which result in focal ischemia and infarction in the brain, eyes, optic nerves, ears, muzzle, nostrils, and other tissues of the head. Adult worms usually cause only mild intimal sclerosis in deer and sheep, and only rarely do they cause granulomatous verminous thrombosis. Microfilariae can cause multifocal myocardial infarction, myocarditis, and fibrosis in deer. Oral food impactions have been associated with E. schneideri in white-tailed deer, but a causal relationship has not been established.\n\nYoung domestic sheep and goats may develop nervous signs and die suddenly 3-5 weeks after infection as a result of thrombosis of cerebral and leptomeningeal arteries. In cattle recumbent for >4-6 hours results in thrombosis of the femoral tributaries (\"downer cows\"). Venous infarction commonly ensues, and necrosis of the medial muscle masses and sciatic nerves causes permanent paraplegia.\n\nThe thickened, congested, red-black mucosa of the gastric fundus in swine with acute septicemia is a venous infarct resulting from thrombosis of veins of the mucosa and submucosa, probably as a sequel to endothelial damage. Gastrointestinal infarction and ulceration can occur in phenylbutazoneintoxicated horses as a result of degeneration of veins and phlebothrombosis. Thrombosis of the jugular veins follows unsuccessful or repeated venipuncture, injection of irritant solutions, and the use of indwelling catheters, especially if contaminated with bacteria. Important sequelae to jugular thrombosis are pulmonary embolism, and, if the emboli are septic, valvular endocarditis and pulmonary abscessation.\n\nEndophlebitis may result from the implantation of bacteria carried in the blood stream, as in salmonellosis, and from the injection of irritant solutions. An important form of acute suppurative endophlebitis is the omphalophlebitis of the newborn resulting from infection of the uncicatrized umbilical cord. The resultant bacteremia may result in acute death or give rise to widespread suppurative lesions, often polyarthritis. Hepatic thrombophlebitis is especially common in \"navel-ill.\" the portal vein and various branches of the caudal vena cava or the azygous vein. As well, portosystemic anastomoses may be acquired because of portal hypertension, which in turn is caused by impedance of blood flow through a diseased liver, an obstructed portal vein, or a kinked intrathoracic caudal vena cava. Hepatic microvascular dysplasia can occur in dogs and cats in the absence of macroscopic portosystemic shunts, and result in similar clinical signs. Portosystemic anastomoses and hepatic encephalopathy are discussed in more detail in Vol. 3, Liver and biliary system.\n\nDilation of a vein, variously termed phlebectasia, varicosity, or aneurysm, occurs but is of little or no importance. A common type of dilation is the so-called \"varicocele\" of the pampiniform plexus. Dilation may also occur because of congenital defects, such as venous diaphragms, agenesis, hypoplasia, or ectopia, or secondary to trauma, neoplasia, or surgical intervention. The initial dilation causes insufficiency of the venous valves, and the veins may become dilated, elongated, and tortuous. Thrombosis or sclerosis may be sequelae. The acquired portosystemic anastomoses noted above usually result from dilation of pre-existing microscopic venous anastomoses to produce collateral venous drainage.\n\nHepatic telangiectasis, peliosis hepatis, and hepatic \"venoocclusive disease\" are described with diseases of the liver in Vol. 3, Liver and biliary system.\n\nRupture of a large vein, usually the result of physical trauma, may result in fatal hemorrhage. Spontaneous idiopathic rupture of the venae cavae or portal vein of horses occurs occasionally; rupture of the great coronary vein of the heart is a rare cause of unexpected death in horses.\n\nVeins may be invaded by neoplasms ( Fig. 1-91A, B) , which may then metastasize, and may cause thrombosis or obstruction.\n\nVenous thrombosis (phlebothrombosis) results from the usual pathogenetic factors and often leads to inflammation of the vein wall, and hence becomes thrombophlebitis. Conversely, phlebitis inevitably leads to thrombosis. Spontaneous thrombosis affects the venae cavae and portal veins occasionally, and the inciting factors are usually unknown. Neoplastic invasion, for instance, by pheochromocytoma, is one cause of thrombosis of the caudal vena cava. Thrombosis of the renal vein and vena cava occasionally occurs in dogs with the nephrotic syndrome as a result of urinary loss of antithrombin and resulting hypercoagulability of the blood. Stasis of venous blood of \n\nIn feline infectious peritonitis, phlebitis occurs as a result of antigen-antibody complex deposition in the walls of small veins and venules, which is followed by complement fixation and neutrophil chemotaxis. Neutrophils cause tissue necrosis, and hence thrombophlebitis, which is followed by the focal pyogranulomatous reaction typical of this disease ( Fig. 1-92) .\n\nPhlebitis very commonly occurs by extension from areas of inflammation, and importantly provides for the hematogenous dissemination of infection. The entire thickness of the wall of the vein is inflamed, and thrombosis occurs rapidly. If the thrombus is infected, it is likely to soften, disintegrate, and produce emboli. An important example of this pathogenetic sequence is thrombosis of the caudal vena cava in cattle, which occurs as a sequel to rumenitis and hepatic abscessation ( Fig.  1-93, eFig. 1-31) . Perivascular hepatic abscesses often involve the vena cava causing thrombophlebitis and a variety of consequences: pulmonary thromboembolism and arteritis, pulmonary abscessation, or pulmonary arterial aneurysms that may rupture and cause massive pulmonary hemorrhage. Valvular endocarditis is an occasional sequel. As well, the abscess may erode the wall of the vena cava wall and rupture into the vena cava, causing massive septic embolization and sudden death. Based on genomic analysis, schistosomes have been placed in 6 defined clades that correlate with the geographic distributions of the parasites (Fig. 1-94) . It also appears that all schistosomes are of Asian origin, with the S. japonicum group as the original ancestor. S. bovis and S. japonicum are the most pathogenic of the schistosomes of cattle and sheep. Mixed infections with more than one species of schistosome occur; hybridization may occur in this circumstance.\n\nOther members of the family Schistosomatidae of veterinary significance include Orientobilharzia turkestanicum in mesenteric veins of herbivores and cats in the Near East, Russia, China, and Mongolia; O. dattai and O. bomfordi in artiodactyls in India; and Heterobilharzia americana in the southern United States, especially Texas and Louisiana in its definitive host the raccoon.\n\nThe life cycles of the schistosomes are comparable to those of other flukes and follow the general pattern described elsewhere for the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica. As a point of difference, the redia phase of F. hepatica in the intermediate host is replaced in the schistosome by a generation of daughter sporocysts.\n\nThe eggs of the schistosome are laid in the vessels that the adult parasites inhabit. When laid, the eggs are immature, but contain a miracidium by the time they have worked their way through the overlying mucous membrane to escape to the exterior. The eggs hatch in water, and the miracidia actively penetrate the soft tissues of aquatic snails to which they are physiologically adapted. The fork-tailed cercariae that emerge from the snail are the infective phase, and they enter the definitive host by burrowing through the skin; patent infestations can also develop if the cercariae are ingested with water. They will invade the skin of hosts that are quite alien to them, provoking allergic reactions and dermatitis (swimmer's itch, swamp itch in humans).\n\nCutaneous lesions develop as a result of penetration of the skin by cercariae. They occur only on those portions of the skin that come in contact with infested water and are seldom observed in animals except under experimental conditions. The cutaneous lesions are tiny petechiated nodules in which there is a sharp leukocytic reaction to the parasite. Passage of a large number of parasites through the lungs will produce pneumonia. Ectopic localization in various organs, such as the kidney, produces small hemorrhages and inflammatory foci.\n\nIn the definitive host, the cercariae lose their tails and become schistosomula, which enter venules in the dermis and, thereafter, are conveyed passively in the blood, through the lungs, and into the systemic circulation. Once in the blood, there is probably no selective migration; those that are distributed to the vessels of their final habitat develop further, and\n\nSchistosomes are important venous parasites in tropical Africa and Asia, and are discussed at length later. Gurltia paralysans, a metastrongyle, causes paralytic disease in domestic cats in South America. The adults lodge in the veins of the thigh and lumbar spinal cord and cause thrombosis and ectasia.\n\nSchistosomiasis, a snail-borne fluke infection, is prevalent in domestic animals in Asia, Africa, and other tropical and subtropical areas, but does not usually occur as clinical disease; the importance of the disease may increase as irrigation projects enhance the habitat for the intermediate snail host. Damage and clinical effects are the result of localization of adult flukes and their eggs in blood vessels of the liver, lungs, alimentary and urogenital tracts, and the nasal cavity. Schistosomiasis is often a disease of long duration.\n\nMembers of the family Schistosomatidae are the blood flukes of mammals and birds; species that parasitize mammals include those of the genera Schistosoma, Heterobilharzia, and Orientobilharzia.\n\nIt is characteristic of the trematodes, including the blood flukes, that the intermediate stages of the parasite are selective in their choice of hosts, mollusks, and that the infective and final phases do quite well in a variety of definitive hosts, although there is some host preference. The distribution of particular species of schistosomes is closely linked to the geography of the obligate intermediate hosts. The human schistosome, especially Schistosoma japonicum, may be found in domestic animals, and the other mammalian schistosomes may be discovered in man as patent or nonpatent infestations.\n\nBased on distribution, host specificity, egg morphology, and intermediate snail hosts, the species that occur in domestic animals may be grouped as follows: 1. S. haematobium group-S. bovis in the portal and mesenteric veins of ruminants and occasionally horses, camels, and pigs, in southern Europe and tropical areas of Africa and Asia; S. mattheei in the portal and mesenteric veins, plus veins of the urogenital tract and stomach, of ruminants surrounding fibrosis. The above course of events occurs similarly in urinary schistosomiasis caused by S. mattheei, wherein hematuria accompanies excretion of eggs in the urine, and granulomatous cystitis and ureteritis result from the host's immunologic response to the schistosome eggs trapped in the tissues. Clinical signs of schistosomiasis of portomesenteric distribution include lethargy, anemia, and weight loss. Diarrhea or dysentery occur at the time of patency, persist for a few weeks, and, in the absence of reinfection, may be followed by spontaneous recovery as the immune response of the host eliminates the parasites and suppresses the egg laying of survivors. The eggs can be found in the feces together with some mucus and blood. Blood loss leads to anemia and hypoalbuminemia, which may contribute to the presence of fluid in serous cavities.\n\nGross and microscopic findings include thickening of the wall of the intestine, chiefly the large bowel, by inflammatory and scar tissue, and the wall may contain small granulomas and lymphoid nodules. Scarring begins in the mucosa and extends to involve all layers, including the serosa. The mucosa may bear polypoid and papillary proliferations. The mesentery those that are distributed to other organs die. Schistosoma nasale develops in the veins of the nasal mucosa; all other species develop in veins of the abdominal cavity, principally in the portal vessels, until sexual maturity is attained, when they migrate out to the smaller veins of the mesentery. In long-standing infections, S. mattheei may reside in veins of the urinary bladder as well as in portomesenteric veins. The prepatent period in the mammalian host ranges from 30-77 days.\n\nAs would be expected, not all the eggs move in the proper direction. Some break into lymphatics and are conveyed to the regional nodes to produce granulomas but, more importantly, a great many of them pass to the liver, producing portal phlebitis and granulomatous hepatitis, in concert with the adult flukes. In heavy infestations and possibly by means of venous shunts developed in the liver, many eggs may pass in venous blood to and beyond the lungs, producing granulomatous endoarteritis and adjacent granulomas wherever they lodge. The development of hepatic lesions follows the same course as for those that develop in the intestinal wall. In the liver, the eggs break out of the portal venules to become enclosed by granulomas. Sooner or later, they die and are mineralized, and by that time have provoked extensive may be found within thrombi. Adults may similarly cause reactions in veins of the pancreas and the mesenteric and portal lymph nodes, and in pulmonary arterioles. Dead parasites are removed by a granulomatous reaction that is often followed by the formation of a grossly visible lymphoid nodule. The lumen of the vein may be occluded, and the venous wall obliterated, by this lymphoid response. There may also be diffuse intimal proliferation and endophlebitis of intrahepatic portal veins, medial hypertrophy, and adventitial inflammation and fibrosis leading to prominent portal fibrosis, which may appear grossly as \"clay pipe-stem\" portal fibrosis. Irregular dilated vascular bypasses develop in the portal areas. The adults ingest erythrocytes and regurgitate hematin pigments, which are picked up by the monocyte-macrophage system, especially in the regional lymph nodes and liver; these black iron-porphyrin pigments may be responsible for the gray color of the liver and lungs in severe cases of schistosomiasis. Heterobilharzia americana infection. Heterobilharzia americana, in the family Schistosomatidae, causes schistosomiasis in dogs as an accidental infection. The raccoon is the definitive host. Dogs, among many other species, are accidental hosts, including the bobcat, armadillo, Brazilian tapir, beaver, coyote, mountain lion, mink, nutria, opossum, red wolf, swamp rabbit, and white-tailed deer. The trematode is found in the southeastern United States, especially the Gulf coast and southern Atlantic states, and the infection in the vertebrate host is limited by the geographic distribution of the intermediate host. Granulomas incited by H. americana have been reported to occur in the liver, and uncommonly, in other tissues of horses.\n\nThe life cycle of the trematode is well defined, with the intermediate host a lymnaeid freshwater snail Bakerilymnaea cubensis or Pseudosuccinea columnella. It follows the classic schistosome pathway of cercariae-the cercariae penetrating the skin of the vertebrate host, migrating via the blood to the lungs and liver before finally coming to reside in the mesenteric and intrahepatic portal veins, where they mature into adults. Eggs, assisted by the secretion of proteolytic enzymes, move from the capillary lumen into the intestinal tract and are expelled in feces. On contact with water, miracidia are released from the eggs and actively seek the snail intermediate host, which completes the life cycle. Clinical signs of the infection in dogs include mucoid to bloody diarrhea, lethargy, weight loss, vomiting, anorexia, and ascites. A distinctive finding is the presence of hypercalcemia in >50% of cases, which is thought to be the result of the synthesis and release of calcitriol from macrophages as part of the granulomatous reaction to egg migration. With or without hypercalcemia, there may be areas of dystrophic tissue mineralization, especially of schistosome eggs, in the intestine and liver. At postmortem, the abdominal cavity may contain excess fluid, the intestinal wall thickened, and the liver, small, pale, and nodular, containing numerous 1-2 mm pale gray to white areas extending throughout the parenchyma. The lungs and kidneys may contain similar lesions. Histologically, lesions in the liver, intestinal submucosa, pancreas and lungs are multifocal lymphoplasmacytic, eosinophilic to granulomatous reactions in response to deposited eggs that are sometimes arranged in linear arrays ( Fig. 1-95A, B) . The eggs are often heavily mineralized. The liver, in particular, may exhibit additional lesions of periportal to bridging fibrosis, lobular collapse, nodular regeneration, bile duct hyperplasia, and cholestasis. Confirmation of the suspected diagnosis of H. americana, even from is thickened and shortened by fibrous tissue, and the mesenteric nodes are enlarged and fibrotic. The adult parasites, which are about 1-3 cm long, can be found in the mesenteric and portal vessels (eFig. 1-32). There is fibrosis of the liver of variable degree affecting particularly the portal vessels. The liver may be enlarged or small depending on the course and severity of the infestation. On cut surface, the periportal nature of the fibrosis is quite apparent but, with time and more severe infestations, the fibrosis becomes more diffuse and the surface of the liver may have a hobnailed appearance or be studded by numerous minute granulomas.\n\nProliferative granulomatous nasal lesions produced by S. nasale result in clinical signs of dyspnea and mouth breathing.\n\nGranulomatous lesions are frequently present in the urinary bladder and ureters of cattle with S. mattheei infection; lesions in the ureters, and occasionally renal pelvis, are linear, whereas those in the bladder become very extensive and polypoid.\n\nThe stage of oviposition and extrusion of eggs through the tissues and mucous membranes is the stage in which most damage is done. In fact, a host inflammatory response is necessary for the eggs to move across the mucosa of organs such as the intestine and bladder. The mated schistosomes, in permanent copula, move out into the smallest venous radicles, and the eggs are deposited first in the lumen of the vessel. They adhere to, and are eventually covered by, the endothelium. The eggs of some species are spinous, and this probably facilitates passive migration into the tissue. The migration does appear, however, to be partly active by virtue of secretions elaborated by the developing miracidium, which diffuse through the shell of the egg into the tissues. These secretions may be also in part responsible for inciting the inflammatory reaction to the eggs. Initially, most of the eggs are deposited in the lamina propria of the intestine, and break into the lumen with little more than mechanical injury. Rupture of congested mucosal venules accounts for the characteristic dysentery of schistosomiasis. Also contributing to diarrhea, loss of body condition, and failure to thrive are ganglionitis and degeneration of the enteric nervous system, which may result from a localized type I hypersensitivity reaction involving mast cell-derived chemical mediators.\n\nAs the disease progresses and the adults are excluded from smaller venules resulting from endophlebitis, eggs are laid in veins in deeper tissues, where antigens released by the miracidium induce a delayed hypersensitivity response and formation of small granulomas (\"pseudotubercles\"). The granulomas are characterized initially by the infiltration of leukocytes, chiefly eosinophils, and later by the accumulation of mononuclear leukocytes, epithelioid and giant cells, and reactive fibrosis. Microabscesses occasionally form and rupture into the gut lumen. Eggs in submucosal granulomas degenerate and are removed, or may be mineralized and remain for a longer period of time. Some of the mature or disintegrating eggs may be coated with a bright eosinophilic deposit (the Splendore-Hoeppli reaction), the result of antigen-antibody complex formation. The granulomas gradually regress and are replaced by fibrous tissue. Host cell responses to eggs are primarily the result of host hypersensitivity to soluble egg antigens, and, to a much lesser degree, resulting from physical and chemical stimuli.\n\nAdult schistosomes in mesenteric and portal veins elicit eosinophilic endophlebitis, often with irregular intimal proliferation, and 93.e1 eFigure 1-32 Adult schistosome (arrow) in a mesenteric vein in a lamb. secondary bacterial infection. Mild lymphedema affecting only the hindlimbs will in some cases disappear, presumably resulting from postnatal development of the peripheral lymphatic system. The peripheral lymph nodes are usually smaller than normal or absent in affected animals. Although obstruction may be demonstrated by lymphangiography, nodal hypoplasia or absence does not necessarily lead to obstruction. Afferent and efferent nodal sinuses may be dilated and may be evident on gross examination. The thoracic duct may be dilated and tortuous in generalized lymphedema.\n\nHistologically, a wide range of lymphatic abnormalities may be seen in the edematous, and possibly fibrotic, subcutis of affected areas. The lymphatics may be aplastic, that is, no lymphatics are found; hypoplastic, in which case lymphatics are too few or too small; or hyperplastic, or varicose, in which case lymphatics are excessive in size and number, and dilation has resulted in valvular incompetence and lymphostasis. Ectatic lymph channels are commonly present around and within hypoplastic peripheral lymph nodes. Central nodes are similarly affected in animals with generalized lymphedema, and will be absent in cases of lymphovascular agenesis. \n\nDilation of normally developed lymphatic vessels (lymphangiectasis) almost invariably results from some form of obstruction and leads to the accumulation of excess interstitial fluid in the drainage area. Causes of such lymphatic obstruction include infiltrating neoplasms that may obstruct the lymphatic vessel or the drainage node, inflammatory thrombosis and sclerosis of the channels or nodal sinuses, and postsurgical scarring. The vessels become irregularly dilated and tortuous distal to the obstruction, and the accompanying increase in interstitial fluid, if persistent, will cause an increase in interstitial and subcutaneous fibrous tissue.\n\nIntestinal lymphangiectasis is the most common cause of protein-losing enteropathy in dogs, and contributes to intestinal protein loss in cattle with Johne's disease and other enteritides. Dilated lacteals in intestinal villi rupture or leak their contents into the intestinal lumen, and severe hypoproteinemia can result. Leakage of protein from capillaries in the villi may also be an important contributor to protein loss. Chyle may leak from dilated subserosal lymphatics and contribute to the hypoproteinemia-induced ascites.\n\nChylothorax, the result of leakage or rupture of the thoracic duct, occurs infrequently in dogs and cats. The cause of chylothorax in the absence of another complicating lesion is usually not apparent; rupture resulting from thoracic trauma is often postulated but rarely proven. An injured thoracic duct has limited capacity for spontaneous healing. Reported complicating causes of chylothorax include neoplasia, right-sided subsequent outgrowths form the peripheral lymphatic system. The primary lymph nodes develop from the primitive central lymphatic anlagen, the jugular and iliac lymph sacs. Secondary and tertiary lymph nodes later form along the peripheral lymphatic system and are the most severely affected nodes in congenital lymphedema. The earlier the stage at which lymphatic malformation occurs, that is, the more central the malformation, the more severe the clinical manifestations and the earlier their onset.\n\nGrossly, the most severely affected individuals have generalized subcutaneous edema and fluid in serous cavities and are either stillborn or must be delivered by cesarean section. The mortality rate of Ayrshire cows with lymphedematous fetuses has been high. Moderate degrees of lymphedema are seen as symmetrical swelling of the head, neck, limbs, and tail ( Fig.  1-97) . The ears of lymphedematous calves often have edematous accessory lobes. Lesser degrees of lymphedema affect the distal parts of the limbs, especially the hindlimbs, and may not develop for several weeks postnatally. Mild regional lymphedema may be of little significance, although chronic subcutaneous edema will lead to fibrosis and may predispose to Synonyms include Monday morning disease, bigleg, and weed. The disease is ushered in by acute lameness and severe cording of the lymphatics, although this is usually palpable only where the lymphatics lie near the saphenous vein on the inner aspect of the thigh. The limb swells rapidly, the swelling beginning about the pastern or metatarsus and reaching its zenith in 3 or 4 days, by which time it has usually extended beyond the stifle. There are transient general disturbances associated with fever. Recovery is usual, although repeated attacks may occur and some cases are fatal, presumably as a result of septicemia. There is edema of the connective tissues of the distal portion of the limb, with very rapid fibroplasia. Above the stifle, the edema is largely confined to the subcutis, this probably depending on the arrangement of fascia there. The lymphatics are dilated, and the larger ones contain thick pus or a thinner mixture of pus and lymph. There is regional acute lymphadenitis.\n\nThe cause and pathogenesis of sporadic lymphangitis are unknown. Various pyogenic organisms have been recovered from the lesions, but it appears that, in the usual case, the initial acute infection is rapidly overcome. The occurrence of the disease after a period of inactivity, and the experimental production of a similar lesion by inoculation of bacteria into skin of the pasterns in undernourished horses, suggests that \"stocking\" of the hindlimbs (stagnant edema that is common in debilitated horses in periods of inactivity) predisposes to the progress of infection. However, most horses with stocking of the hindlimbs do not develop lymphangitis. The entry of infection is probably traumatic.\n\nHamid ME. Epidemiology, pathology, immunology and diagnosis of bovine farcy: a review. Prev Vet Med 2012;105:1-9. Kull PA, et al. Clinical, clinicopathologic, radiographic and ultrasono- graphic characteristics of intestinal lymphangiectasia in dogs: 17 cases (1996) (1997) (1998) heart failure, dirofilariasis, thrombosis of the cranial vena cava, congenital anomaly of the thoracic duct, fungal infections, and lung lobe torsion. Obstruction of thoracic duct drainage may lead to lymphangiectasis of intrathoracic lymphatics and leakage of chyle. Chylopericardium is an unusual accompaniment of chylothorax. The diagnosis of chylothorax is confirmed by analysis of the pleural fluid, which is opalescent to opaque, milky-white to yellow, and on standing, forms a top layer of cream (chylomicron fat) that is ether soluble. Microscopically, the fluid contains large numbers of lymphocytes, a few neutrophils, red cells, plasma cells, and fat globules. The site of the rupture is often difficult to locate surgically or at postmortem. Ligation of the thoracic duct leads to the development of alternative lymphaticovenous anastomoses, and cessation of the chylothorax. Chylous ascites results from rupture of the cisterna chyli, and is a rare event. Myers NC, et al. Chylothorax \n\nLymphangitis with anatomic specificity is a prominent feature of a number of specific diseases. Most of the diseases are discussed elsewhere, but warrant brief mention here also. A feature of the restricted form of anthrax is acute thrombotic lymphangitis, the thrombi containing large numbers of bacilli, with a marked tendency towards necrosis, and is seen in pigs, dogs, and horses. Granulomatous lymphangitis occurs typically in mycobacterial infections; the mesenteric lymphatics stand out like threads beneath the serosa in Johne's disease, and are often beaded in intestinal tuberculosis; they bear the specific microscopic lesions of these infections ( Fig. 1-98) . The spread of actinobacillosis can often be discerned as long rows of small granulomas from the site of primary infection on the way to the regional nodes. The corded and nodular ulcerating lymphangitis of cutaneous glanders in horses must be distinguished from the specific forms of lymphangitis discussed below. Lymphangitis is often a prominent development in cutaneous streptothricosis in cattle, and can occur in various species with cutaneous sporotrichosis. Lipogranulomatous lymphangitis has been found in association with intestinal lymphangiectasis in dogs. Bovine farcy is a chronic granulomatous disease of cattle in the tropics, and is characterized by nodular suppurative dermatitis, lymphangitis, and lymphadenitis. Most cases of bovine farcy are caused by Mycobacterium farcinogenes or M. senegalense.\n\nSporadic lymphangitis, a nonspecific, nonulcerative lymphangitis affecting the hindlegs of horses, is relatively common. \n\nEpizootic lymphangitis, or pseudofarcy, is caused by Histoplasma capsulatum var. farciminosum (HCF) and clinically resembles ulcerative lymphangitis and cutaneous glanders (\"farcy\"). Epizootic lymphangitis occurs almost exclusively in horses and mules. \"Equine histoplasmosis\" is probably a more appropriate name, because HCF infection may be manifest as keratoconjunctivitis or pneumonia in the absence of past or concurrent lymphangitis.\n\nEpizootic lymphangitis is enzootic in some Mediterranean countries, Africa, and the Near and Far East. The organism apparently exists as a soil saprophyte, and enters the body through skin wounds of the lower limbs to cause the classic epizootic lymphangitis, but may also invade castration wounds, ruptured abscessed lymph nodes after strangles, and gastric ulcers. Histoplasma farciminosum may cause sinusitis, and/or pneumonia via inhalation of contaminated dust; may cause rhinitis by contact with skin lesions; and may be transmitted by flies (Musca and Stomoxys) to cause keratoconjunctivitis.\n\nThe initial cutaneous lesion, or focus of infection in a wound, has a tendency to ulcerate, or it may undergo alternating periods of discharge and closure for some weeks before healing and scarifying. The infection may resolve, but often spreads centripetally in the adjacent tissues and along the lymphatics. In the adjacent tissues, which are swollen, small nodules of ~1 cm diameter develop and, in the course of a few days, these ulcerate to discharge, at first, a viscid gray exudate and, later, pus. The initial lesions are intradermal and are freely movable over the subcutaneous tissue. Spread of the infection is solely via the lymphatics, and these convey the organisms into the subcutaneous and, occasionally, into the deeper tissues. The inflamed lymphatics are thickened and hard, and along their course new nodules form, ulcerate, discharge, and eventually heal with scarification, although there may be alternating periods of activity and quiescence with the growth of excessive granulation tissue. Sometimes the ulcers continue to enlarge and may coalesce. In this way, the cutaneous infection spreads gradually but irregularly, but is always characterized by intradermal and subcutaneous nodules, ulcers, and irregularly swollen lymphatics. In the early stages, the skin between the lesions remains normal and mobile, but in areas of extensive ulceration, it becomes very thick, indurated, and firmly fused to the underlying tissues. When the thickened skin is incised, it presents the lardaceous appearance of granulation tissue in the horse and contains a number of small, yellow, purulent foci, between which course the lymphatics, dilated and filled with pus and serous fluid.\n\nThe regional lymph nodes are regularly involved and swollen. In the early stages, the swollen nodes contain many small foci of softening, but later the foci coalesce and are heavily encapsulated. The nodes may rupture. The condition is usually chronic, persisting for 3-12 months, and causes considerable debility, but low mortality.\n\nThis is a chronic progressive inflammation of the subcutaneous lymphatics of horses. Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (ovis) is the cause of the classic condition, but similar lesions may be caused by other pyogenic organisms, including streptococci, staphylococci, Rhodococcus equi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Two biotypes of C. pseudotuberculosis are recognized: a nitrate-negative type isolated from sheep and goats, and a nitrate-positive type isolated from horses and cattle. Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis produces a potent phospholipase exotoxin that attacks the sphingomyelin of vascular endothelial cells, and may be important in aiding the spread of the bacteria by acting as a permeability factor. Ulcerative lymphangitis was an important cause of debility in the horse era, but is now sporadic and rather rare.\n\nSome features of the biology of C. pseudotuberculosis are discussed with caseous lymphadenitis (see Vol. 3, Hematopoietic system). In that disease, as in ulcerative lymphangitis, the infection begins in cutaneous wounds. Ulcerative lymphangitis typically begins about the fetlocks of the hindlimbs. As a result of lymphangitis, there is diffuse swelling in the leg, soon followed by development of dermal nodules. These are abscesses that ulcerate and discharge thick white to light yellow viscous pus that may be bloodstained. Only a small area of skin may be sloughed so that, usually, the margins of the ulcer are undermined. The ulcers heal and leave small areas of depilated, depigmented skin. As the primary ulcers heal, new nodules form in adjacent skin, suppurate, ulcerate, and cicatrize, and in this way, the disease progresses slowly. As the new nodules develop, the lymphatics between them become corded and as much as 1-2 cm thick, and fresh abscesses develop along the inflamed vessels. In uncontrolled infections, over a course of many months much of the skin of the body and neck as well as the limbs may be affected, and this leads to death. Typically, the regional lymph nodes, although moderately enlarged, do not become suppurative or fibrotic. In rare instances, bacteremia results in internal dissemination, especially to the kidneys.\n\nUlcerative lymphangitis also occurs in cattle, but as well as affecting the distal portions of the limbs, as in horses, the initial lesions may also develop within the dermis or subcutis of the neck, shoulder, or flank. The initial abscesses are large and may be >5 cm in diameter. Extending away from them are thickened lymphatics, along which new abscesses develop. The abscesses ulcerate on the skin and the ulcers persist, oozing a serum-like exudate. There is early lymphadenitis with swelling of the node and its fixation to the surrounding tissue. The inflammation spreads slowly, and there is progressive suppurative lymphadenitis.\n\nThe equine biotype of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis causes deep pectoral and ventral abdominal wall abscesses (\"pigeon fever\") in horses in the southwestern United States. The transmission of C. pseudotuberculosis in these cases is obscure, but may be by arthropod vectors. Ulcerative lymphangitis does not occur; dissemination is by bacteremia. Untoward sequelae include prolonged resolution of the abscesses, multiple and internal abscessation, and abortion. \n\nFurther reading Ameni of blood vessels and meningothelial cells in the leptomeninges and underlying brain parenchyma. Although most vascular proliferations are idiopathic, there is evidence that various Bartonella spp. (Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, B. henselae, B. koehlerae) may contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic reactive angioendotheliomatosis (and hemangiopericytomas) in animals.\n\nFormerly thought to be due to neoplastic proliferation of endothelial cells and hence termed malignant angioendotheliomatosis, intravascular lymphoma is a rare large cell lymphoma, seen in humans, dogs, and a cat, in which neoplastic lymphocytes proliferate within the lumens of blood vessels. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (angioinvasive lymphoma) is a rare pulmonary disorder of middle-aged dogs, characterized by infiltration of lung and various other organs by neoplastic mononuclear cells admixed with eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells; originally thought to be angiocentric, this pulmonary neoplasm is now thought to be an atypical T-cell lymphoma that is angioinvasive.\n\nLymphangioma is a rare, benign tumor that consists of lymph channels forming capillary, cavernous, or cystic tumors. Lymphangiomas may occur as congenital malformations (hamartomas) or may develop spontaneously in adults. Cavernous and cystic lymphangiomas may progressively enlarge, dissect along fascial planes, and be difficult or impossible to remove surgically.\n\nGlomangiomas (glomus tumors) of nonhuman primates, dogs, cats, and horses are rare benign (even more rarely malignant) neoplasms of the neuromyoarterial thermal receptors, primarily in the digits, characterized by branching vascular channels in a fibrous stroma that contains nests of specialized glomus cells, a type of smooth muscle cell. Glomus jugulare and glomus pulmonale tumors have been reported in dogs. The glomus jugulare and pulmonale are chemoreceptors, and tumors of these bodies resemble other chemodectomas, namely, nests of monomorphic rounded cells with scant cytoplasm separated by thin septa. The tumor is encapsulated and grows expansively.\n\nHemangiosarcoma (malignant hemangioendothelioma), a malignant tumor of endothelial cells, occurs most frequently in old dogs, but is less common than hemangioma. German Shepherd dogs (Alsatians) are most commonly affected, and some other breeds are over-represented. Hemangiosarcoma occurs infrequently in cats, horses, cows, and sheep.\n\nThere is a current focus on a number of receptor tyrosine protein kinases, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2 and Src, as well as CD117(c-Kit) and vascular endothelial growth factor-3, which are overexpressed in hemangiosarcomas. This suggests involvement of growth factor signaling pathways, if not in the genesis, then in the development of the tumor. The p16-cyclinD1-retinoblastoma pathway has also been implicated. There is also increasing evidence that the tumor cells arise from hematopoietic stem cell precursors. The tumor may arise in any site of the body. The most common primary sites in dogs are spleen, skin/subcutis, right atrium, and liver; in cats, spleen, intestines, and subcutaneous tissue; in horses, ocular, cutaneous, and multicentric. Hemangiosarcoma is the most common primary cardiac tumor of dogs, and the tumor usually occurs subepicardially in the wall of the right atrium at the entrance to the auricle near the coronary groove ( Fig. 1-99 ) or in the auricular appendage. Hemangiosarcoma probably \u2022 Vascular malformation is obviously a very broad term that may be included under the term hamartoma, and may include arteriovenous fistula in which thick-walled vessels occur, in contrast to the thin-walled vessels of the other benign vascular proliferations. \u2022 Telangiectasis refers to congenital or acquired foci of abnormally dilated capillaries, sinusoids, arterioles, or venules, usually seen as small masses in the skin and mucous membranes. \u2022 Angiokeratoma is a rare benign tumor, usually of the nictitans and conjunctiva of dogs, in which dilated vascular channels are associated with hyperplastic epithelium. Fortunately, these distinctions, although of pathogenetic interest, are of little practical importance because the lesions described are uniformly benign, and excision, if possible, is curative.\n\nHemangioma is a benign tumor of endothelial cells and may be classified as capillary or cavernous based on the size of the vascular channels formed. The tumor may be difficult to differentiate from vascular malformations and granulation tissue. Hemangiomas occur most commonly in older dogs, and are seen less frequently in other species. These tumors arise from vascular endothelium and hence may be found in any site in the body, but are most common in the dermis and subcutis, especially of the legs, flank, neck, face, and eyelid. The cutaneous and ocular lesions may arise following exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Hemangiomas are usually single, ovoid, red-black masses of 0.5-3 cm in diameter, which ooze blood when cut. Histologically, blood-filled vascular spaces are lined by a single layer of well-differentiated endothelium, and may be thrombosed. The vascular spaces are separated by variable amounts of connective tissue stroma. Hemangiomas are not encapsulated, are not invasive, and do not recur after complete surgical excision. A rare form of cavernous hemangioma, analogous to the human hemangioblastoma, is reported in dogs, and is characterized by thin-walled capillaries separated by pleomorphic \"stromal cells\" of indeterminate origin. An epithelioid variant of hemangioma and hemangiosarcoma has also been described.\n\nDisseminated cavernous hemangioma is rare, but has been reported in calves, and a similar multifocal hemangioma has been reported in a pig. Multiple small tumors are present in skin, subcutis, gingiva, and internal organs. The condition has been termed generalized congenital hemangiomatosis and juvenile bovine angiomatosis, to include calves having either solitary, for instance, gingival or spinal canal, or multiple angiomatous lesions. Hemangiomas occur in the urinary bladder of cattle affected with enzootic hematuria, which is discussed in Vol. 2, Urinary system.\n\nA number of hemangioma-like lesions occur in domestic animals. Bovine cutaneous angiomatosis of adult dairy cows is reported from Britain, France, and the United States. Nodular dermal vascular proliferations occur anywhere in the skin, but especially along the back, may have a considerable inflammatory component, and resemble \"pyogenic granuloma\" of humans. Varicose tumor of the scrotum of dogs is a benign vascular proliferation that resembles cavernous hemangioma when fully developed. Lesions resembling hemangioma occasionally develop in the skin of the scrotum or perineum of boars, or the vulva, mammary glands, or ovaries of sows. Meningioangiomatosis, a rare condition reported in dog, horse, and cow, is characterized by benign focal proliferation A B C arises de novo and not from pre-existing hemangiomas. The tumors have a gray to red-black hemorrhagic appearance, and may reach a diameter of 30 cm in the spleen as a result of hemorrhage within the tumor. Large hemorrhagic masses can often be found in the spleens of dogs; some are hematomas rather than either hemangiomas or hemangiosarcomas. The distinction is important because splenic hemangiosarcomas carry a very poor prognosis. However, the distinction can often be difficult because splenic hemangiosarcomas often hemorrhage, and if the resultant hematoma is not sampled carefully, its neoplastic origin will be missed. Following rupture, implants of splenic tissue or tumor may be found on the peritoneum. Hemangiosarcomas typically metastasize widely, especially to the lungs (\"cannonball\" metastases) ( Fig. 1-100A-C) . Histologically, these tumors consist of vascular spaces lined by elongated, plump, anaplastic endothelial cells ( Fig. 1-101A ). Vascular spaces must be identified in tumors with a highly cellular stroma to differentiate hemangiosarcoma from fibrosarcoma. Hemorrhage and necrosis commonly occur within these tumors, and death may occur because of hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity, pericardial sac, or brain. When metastases are widespread, the primary tumor site may be difficult to determine, and multicentric origin is a possibility. Poorly differentiated hemangiosarcomas may usually be differentiated from spindle cell sarcomas or other non-endothelial neoplasms by immunohistochemical staining for factor VIII-related antigen ( Fig. 1-101B ), a marker of endothelial cells, and claudin-5 protein, a tight-junction protein normally found on endothelial cells. Ulex europaeus lectin, a marker of neoplastic human endothelial cells, is unreliable as a marker of canine vascular tumors. Ultrastructurally, Weibel-Palade bodies (granules"}
