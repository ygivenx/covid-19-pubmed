{"title": "Identification of a Conserved B-cell Epitope on Reticuloendotheliosis Virus Envelope Protein by Screening a Phage-displayed Random Peptide Library", "body": "Reticuloendotheliosis viruses (REVs) are a group of viruses in the family Retroviridae, specifically gammaretroviruses in the same genus as mammalian C-type retroviruses [1]. The REV group includes defective REV-T [2], [3], non-defective REV-A [4], [5], chick syncytial virus (CSV) [6], duck infectious anemia virus [7], and spleen necrosis virus (SNV) [8]. Except for the defective REV-T, all isolated REV strains belong to a single serotype [5] and their genetic sequences show little variation [9].\n\nREV genome consists of three structural genes (gag, pol and env) flanked by long-terminal repeats (LTRs) [10]. The major mature env gene products of REVs are the surface glycoprotein (gp90) and the transmembrane protein (gp20) [11], [12]. The gp90 protein containing both continuous and discontinuous epitopes functions as the immunodominant protein [13] and is responsible for eliciting REV antibodies. Previous studies indicated that the C-terminal epitope of gp90 was exposed on the outer surface of the REV-A-infected cell [12]. However, the epitope identified in REV gp90 protein has not been finely mapped, and the core sequence of the epitope needs to be determined.\n\nDetailed analysis of epitopes is important for the understanding of immunological events, and the development of epitope-based marker vaccines and diagnostic tools for various diseases [14], [15]. In this study, we prepared a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) against gp90 protein from the REV-A strain HLJ07I, and used it to screen a phage-displayed random 12-mer peptide library for the linear B-cell epitope. This study describes the first identification of the precise location of the epitope on gp90 protein. The information provided in this study will facilitate the development of specific serological diagnosis of REV infection, and will contribute to the rational design of vaccines by further understanding of the antigenic structure of gp90.\n\nCare of laboratory animals and animal experimentation were performed in accordance with animal ethics guidelines and approved protocols. All animal studies were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (SYXK (H) 2006-032).\n\nREV-A Strain HLJ07I (GenBank accession No. GQ375848) was isolated from Heilongjiang Province in China in 2007. Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were prepared as primary cultures from 10-day-old chicken embryos as previously described [16] and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics. Viruses were grown in CEFs and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 5 days. The suspension was frozen and thawed three times to disrupt cells and release virus, and then clarified by two centrifugation steps (2000 g for 15 min, and 10,000 g for 60 min). Virus present in the upper phase was precipitated with 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) for 4 hours at 4\u00b0C. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 9,000 g for 30 minutes and resuspended in TNE buffer (50 mM tris-HC1, pH 7.5; 0.1 M NaC1, 10 mM EDTA). Finally, they were centrifuged through a 30% (w/v) sucrose cushion for 90 minutes at 200,000 g and resuspended in TNE buffer. The purified virus was analyzed in SDS-PAGE.\n\nSix-week-old female BALB/c mice were subcutaneously immunized with 100 \u00b5g of the purified recombinant gp90 protein emulsified with an equal volume of Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Two boosters of the Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) emulsified antigen were given at two week interval. Two weeks after the third immunization, the mice were intraperitoneally boosted with 100 \u00b5g antigen alone. Three days later, the spleen cells from immunized mice were fused with myeloma cells SP2/0 (SP2/0-Agl4; ATCC CRL 1581) [17], using 50% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (vol/vol) (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Hybridomas were screened by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The hybridomas producing mAbs were cloned three times by limiting dilution of the cells. Antibody subtype identification was performed using SBA Clonotyping\u2122 System/HRP Kit (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA).\n\nPlates were coated with 100 \u00b5L/well of purified REV gp90 antigen diluted in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) for incubation overnight at 4\u00b0C. Following 4 washes with 200 \u00b5L/well of PBS/0.05% Tween-20, the plates were blocked with 200 \u00b5L/well of blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% skim milk) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The supernatant of hybridoma culture (100 \u00b5L/well) was added in duplicate and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing three times with PBS, 100 \u00b5L of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG, 1\u22365,000 dilution,Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Plates were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 100 \u00b5L/well of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) containing 0.3% H2O2 for 5 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was stopped with 50 \u00b5L/well of 2 M H2SO4 and the absorbance measured at 492 nm.\n\nAbout 70\u201380% confluent CEF cells in 96-well plates were infected with REV-A HLJ07I at a MOI of 0.2. At 5 days post-infection, the infected cells were fixed with icy cold ethanol absolute for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, and air dried. The fixed cells were incubated with mAb A9E8, REV-A-positive chicken serum, anti-porcine IFN-\u03b3 mAb (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), or REV-A-negative chicken serum for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing three times with PBS, 50 \u00b5L/well of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgG (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) at 1\u2236100 dilutions were added and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The cells were rinsed three times with PBS and once with deionized water, and mounted in 50 \u00b5L of 90% glycerol in PBS, and then observed under the Nikon Eclipse Ti-E microscope equipped with NIS-Elements AR software.\n\nThe micro-neutralization assay was modified from a previously described procedure [18]. The ascitic fluid was heat inactivated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C, and two fold serial dilutions were incubated with 2\u00d7103 tissue culture infective doses 50% (TCID50/mL ) of REV-A in a 96-well micro-plate. Four uninfected control wells were included on each plate as control wells. After 2 h incubation at 4\u00b0C, 100 \u00b5L of CEF cells at 1.5\u00d7105 cells/mL was added to each well. The plates were incubated for 5 days at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. The monolayers were washed with PBS and fixed in icy cold ethanol for 15 minutes. The presence of viral gp90 protein was detected by ELISA with the mAb A9E8. The absorbance was measured at 492 nm with an ELISA microplate reader. The average A492 was determined for quadruplicate wells of virus-infected and uninfected control wells, and a neutralizing endpoint was determined by using a 50% specific signal calculation. The endpoint titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of ascitic fluid with A492 value less than X, where \u00d7 = [(average A492 of infected wells) \u2212 (average A492 of control wells)]/2+ (average A492 of control wells).\n\nThe Ph.D.-12\u2122 Phage Display Peptide Library Kit was purchased from New England BioLabs Inc. The dodecapeptide library consisted of 2.7\u00d7109 electroporated sequences (1.5\u00d71013 pfu/mL). The mAb was purified from the ascites \ufb02uid of mice inoculated with the hybridma cells secreting A9E8 by affinity chromatography using rProtein G Agorose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The concentration of the purified protein was determined using the Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Three successive rounds of biopanning were carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction manual. Brie\ufb02y, one well of a 96-well microtiter plate was coated with 10 \u00b5g/mL of mAb A9E8 in coating buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.6) overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by blocking with blocking buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.6, 0.02% NaN3, and 5 mg/ml BSA) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. The phage library (1.5\u00d71011 phages/100 \u00b5L) was added to the blocked wells and the plate incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The unbound phages were removed by successive washings with TBS buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) containing gradually increased concentrations (0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5%) of Tween-20, and the bound phages were eluted by 0.2 M glycine-HCl containing 1 mg/mL BSA (pH 2.2) and immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.1). The eluted phages were amplified by infecting E. coli (ER2738), and were titered on LB/IPTG/Xgal plates for the subsequent rounds of selection. The output to input ratio was calculated as follows: (titer of the amplified eluent phages/titer of the input phages (1.5\u00d71011))\u00d7100%.\n\nAfter three rounds of biopanning, eight individual phage clones were selected for target binding in ELISA as described in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Brie\ufb02y, 96-well plates were coated with 100 ng of purified mAb A9E8, or anti-porcine IFN-\u03b3 mAb (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) as negative controls overnight at 4\u00b0C. The coated wells were blocked for 2 h at room temperature and then the phages (1010 pfu/100 \u00b5L/well) diluted in blocking solution were added. The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing ten times with TBST. Bound phages were subjected to reaction with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-M13 antibody (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NY, USA), followed by color development with substrate solution containing o-phenylenediamine (OPD).\n\nThe positive phage clones identified by phage ELISA were sequenced with the \u221296 gIII sequencing primer 5\u2032-TGA GCG GAT AAC AAT TTC AC-3\u2032 as described in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nA series of complementary oligonucleotides (Table 1) coding for wild-type and truncated motif SVQYHPL were synthesized, annealed, and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6p-1 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NY, USA), producing a group of recombinant plasmids. All the resulting recombinant plasmids were validated by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. Expression plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) competent cells, followed by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-D-thioga-lactopyranoside (IPTG; GE Healthcare, USA) for induction.\n\nApproximately equivalent amount of each GST fusion protein was subjected to 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% SDS\u2013PAGE). The gel was either stained with commassie blue staining solution or electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After being blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C, the membrane was incubated with mAb A9E8 (diluted 1\u22362,000 in PBS) or REV-A-positive chicken serum (diluted 1\u2236100 in PBS) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After being washed three times with PBST, the membrane was probed with a 1\u22365,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) or HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgG (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Reactivity was visualized with the substrate 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA).\n\nTo investigate the conservation of the epitope among REV viruses, sequence alignment of the epitope and the corresponding regions on gp90 proteins of 32 REV-A strains, one REV-T strain, four SNV strains and one CSV strain was performed using the DNASTAR Lasergene program (Windows version; DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA).\n\nPurified gp90 protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice. After cell fusion and screening, several hybridoma cell lines were generated, which produced gp90-reactive mAbs. One monoclonal antibody produced by the line designated as A9E8 was selected for strong reactivity with recombinant gp90 protein in Western blot (Figure 1A) and in an indirect ELISA (data not shown). It also showed strong reactivity with purified whole virus in Western blot (Figure 1B) and could be used to detect REV-A antigen by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA; Figure 1C). The mAb A9E8 was compose of an IgG2b heavy chain paired with a \u03ba-type light chain, as determined using the SBA Clonotyping\u2122 System/HRP Kit. The titers of antibody in hybridoma cell culture supernatants and in ascites were measured by indirect ELISA and determined to be 1\u22363,200 and 1\u2236128,000, respectively.\n\nThe neutralizing activities of the mAb A9E8 were then determined by a micro-neutralization assay on CEF cells using REV-A HLJ07I. The mAb A9E8 neutralized the virus with a neutralization titer (NT50) of 100.\n\nTo determine the epitope recognized by mAb A9E8, biopanning of a phage displayed 12-mer random peptide library was performed using the affinity purified mAb A9E8. After three rounds of biopanning, an enrichment of phages bound to the mAb A9E8 was obtained. The output to input ratios of the three rounds of biopanning were 0.00008%,0.038% and 0.79%.\n\nEight phage clones were selected for reactivity with the mAb A9E8 after three rounds of biopanning and enrichment of the phages binding to the mAb A9E8. These selected clones were further evaluated by Phage ELISA for reactivity with the mAb A9E8 and a negative control mAb (anti-porcine IFN-\u03b3). As shown in Figure 2, all the selected eight phage clones (A1\u2013A8) showed specific reactivity with A9E8 (OD492 nm >1.10), but not with anti-porcine IFN-\u03b3 mAb (OD492 nm <0.15). The eight phage clones were sequenced, and were shown to display a consensus sequence SVQYHPL, which was identical to the motif 213SVQYHPL219 at the C-terminus of the gp90 protein of REV-A strain HLJ07I (Table 2).\n\nTo verify whether the identified motif represented an epitope recognized by the mAb A9E8, a DNA fragment coding for the motif SVQYHPL was expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST-H7wt) in E. coli. Western blot analysis showed that the fusion protein was recognized by the mAb A9E8 (Figure 3A) and REV-A infected chicken antiserum (Figure 3B), indicating that the motif represented a linear B-cell epitope.\n\nTo define the epitope precisely, four mutants with deletions at C- and N-termini of the motif SVQYHPL (Table 1) were constructed to express the GST fusions GST-H7\u0394S, GST-H7\u0394L, GST-H7\u0394SV, and GST-H7\u0394PL representing -VQYHPL, SVQYHP-, \u2013QYHPL and SVQYH\u2013 (deletions were shown as dashes) in E. coli, respectively. We found that only the full-length SVQYHPL polypeptide (GST-H7wt) was recognized by the mAb A9E8 (Figure 3A). Removal of one or more amino acids at either the amino or carboxyl terminus of the peptide abolished antibody binding, indicating that the peptide SVQYHPL represented the minimal requirement for the reactivity of the epitope with A9E8.\n\nTo investigate minimal unit of the epitope with the maximal binding activity to mAb A9E8, a series of GST-fusion proteins were expressed with extended amino acid residues at both N and C termini of the motif SVQYHPL (Table 1). These GST-fusion proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and testing for reactivity with mAb A9E8 in Western blot. Fusion proteins GST-R1 (SVQYHPLA), GST-R2 (SVQYHPLAL) and GST-R3 (SVQYHPLALP) reacted strongly with mAb A9E8 in Western blot (Figure 4). The GST-R2 and GST-R3 showed similar binding activity to the GST-R1, indicating that alanine alone significantly increased binding activity of the core epitope to mAb A9E8. In contrast, GST-fusion proteins with extended amino acid residues at the N terminus of the motif SVQYHPL showed no increased binding activity compared with GST-H7wt in Western blot (data not shown). Taken together, these results showed that SVQYHPLA was the minimal unit of the epitope with the maximal binding activity to mAb A9E8.\n\nTo investigate the conservation of the SVQYHPL epitope, we aligned the epitope identified in this study with REVs gp90 coding regions available in GenBank. The alignment results showed that all amino acids in the motif were identical among all REV strains (Figure 5), indicating that the motif represented a conserved epitope on the gp90 protein of REVs.\n\nIn summary, a highly conserved neutralizing linear B-cell epitope on the gp90 protein of REV-A was identified in this study. The identified conserved epitope may have potential for development of REV specific diagnostic assays and epitope-based marker vaccines."}
