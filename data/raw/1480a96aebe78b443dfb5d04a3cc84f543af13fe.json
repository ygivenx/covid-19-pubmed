{"title": "Pentoxifylline inhibits replication of Japanese encephalitis virus: a comparative study with ribavirin", "body": "Flaviviruses are important human pathogens causing a variety of diseases ranging from mild febrile illness to severe encephalitis and haemorrhagic fever. Among them, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a neuropathogenic virus commonly infecting children and is associated with acute encephalitis [1] . The disease burden of Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an increasing public health problem with an average of 50 000 cases per year in Asia [2, 3] . Despite this, the prospects for therapy of flavivirus infections are not encouraging, which has led to the unavailability of a specific and efficient antiviral agent against JEV [4] . This has rekindled the search for a drug that can inhibit JEV replication.\n\nPentoxifylline is a methylxanthine derivative and has been used for treating human vascular diseases [5] . Despite being a cardiovascular drug, pentoxifylline also demonstrated high antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus, vaccinia virus, rotavirus and tick-borne encephalitis virus, suggesting that this drug also has broad-spectrum virus inhibitory properties [6] . Furthermore, pentoxifylline also showed inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) expression in acutely and chronically infected cells in vitro and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [7, 8] . However, the ability of pentoxifylline to inhibit JEV replication has not\n\nThe cytotoxicity of pentoxifylline and ribavirin was evaluated using a trypan blue exclusion assay [9, 10] . Briefly, PS cells grown to semiconfluence were exposed to five different concentrations of the compounds for 4 days and viable cells were counted using 2.5% trypan blue dye and a haemocytometer [10] . The concentration of compound that reduced cell growth by 50% was estimated as the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ). The effect of the compounds on cellular proliferation was also studied as described previously [10] . Ribavirin, a known inhibitor of flavivirus replication, was used in this study as a standard for comparing the results in all the experiments.\n\nThe antiviral activity of pentoxifylline and ribavirin was initially determined using a CPE inhibition assay as described previously [10] . Briefly, a PS cell monolayer was infected with 1 multiplicity of infection (MoI) of virus and incubated for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C. At the end of the incubation period, the monolayer was rinsed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then doubling dilutions of ribavirin and pentoxifylline (beginning with the CC 50 ) were added and incubated for 3 days. The experiment was terminated when the virus control showed maximum CPE. The presence or absence of CPE was recorded microscopically every day and the plates were stained using crystal violet and compared with the virus control and drug control. All the experiments were run in triplicate to ensure reproducibility.\n\nThe antiviral activity of pentoxifylline noted in the screening experiments was confirmed by the plaque reduction assay as described previously [10] . Briefly, PS cells grown to a confluent monolayer were infected with 1 MoI of JEV and adsorbed for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C. At the end of adsorption the monolayer was rinsed and 100 L of MEM containing varying concentrations of pentoxifylline (500, 250, 125, 62.5 and 31.25 g/mL) or ribavirin (50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 and 3.12 g/mL) was added. The monolayer was then overlaid with maintenance medium containing 0.2% molten agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Appropriate controls were included in each run of the assay. Incubation was carried out at 37 \u2022 C for 3 days . At the end of the incubation period, monolayers were fixed and stained using 1% crystal violet and plaques were counted using a hand lens. All experiments were run in triplicate. Percentage inhibition of plaques was determined using the following formula: % inhibition = no. of plaques in virus control \u2212 no. of plaques in drug-treated no. of plaques in virus control \u00d7 100\n\nThe antiviral activity was expressed as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ), which is the concentration of compound required to inhibit viral plaques by 50% compared with the virus control. The therapeutic potential and the specificity of action of the compounds were calculated as the therapeutic index (TI), which is the ratio of CC 50 to IC 50.\n\nTo understand the possible mechanism of action of pentoxifylline in relation to the replicative cycle of JEV, various in vitro experiments detailed below were carried out.\n\nA 24-well plate containing sterile coverslips in each well was seeded with 4 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well and incubated to attain confluence. The monolayer was then infected with JEV (MoI = 1) for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C. Following incubation, the monolayer was rinsed and replenished with medium containing 1% FCS. This time point was considered as 0 h post infection. Subsequently at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 24 h post infection, the medium was harvested to determine the amount of extracellular virus released into the supernatant. At each time point, the coverslip containing cells was also removed, fixed in chilled acetone and stained by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using a monoclonal antibody against the envelope protein of JEV to detect the cell-bound antigen [11] .\n\nA 24-well plate was seeded with PS cells and incubated at 37 \u2022 C overnight. JEV was added to this monolayer and incubated for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C. At the end of virus adsorption, the monolayer was rinsed using sterile PBS and replenished with MEM containing 1% FCS. This time point was considered as 0 h post infection. Starting from the 0 h time point, 0.0017 M pentoxifylline was added at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 24 h post infection and incubated at 37 \u2022 C. The supernatant fluid was harvested from the respective wells at 48 h post infection. The fluid was divided into two parts. One part was used to determine the virus yield (50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 )/mL) and the second part was used to detect the presence of soluble JEV antigen by antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described elsewhere [12] . To detect cell-bound antigen, the coverslip cultures were fixed in chilled acetone for 30 min at 4 \u2022 C and stained using monoclonal antibody to JEV (clone F2C2) and anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugate by indirect IFA.\n\nTo understand the mechanism of action of pentoxifylline, an in vitro translation experiment was carried out using commercially available Transcend TM Non-Radioactive Translation Detection System and Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate (Promega, Madison, WI). A PS cell monolayer was adsorbed with JEV (MoI = 1) for 1 h. Following adsorption, monolayer was rinsed and 0.0017 M pentoxifylline was added to one set of JEV-infected cells and incubated for 4 h. Pentoxifylline at the same concentration was added to a second set of monolayer cultures at 10 h. The plates were further incubated for 48 h at 37 \u2022 C. Appropriate virus and cell controls were included. At the end of incubation, the cells were treated with 750 L of TRIzol reagent (Gibco, Rockville, MD) and viral RNA was extracted as per the manufacturer's instruction. The extracted RNA was subjected to real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using SYBR green I chemistry as described previously [13] with minor modifications [10] to ensure the presence of JEV RNA. The viral RNA obtained from JEV-infected cells, which encodes a 50-kDa protein, was subjected to in vitro translation using a commercial kit (Promega) as described previously [10] . After completion of the translation reaction, 1 L of the product was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gel was electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was reacted with specific monoclonal antibody to JEV and developed using diaminobenzidine and H 2 O 2 . \n\nInitially, non-toxic concentrations of pentoxifylline were determined by administering intraperitoneally 50, 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight of the compound to different groups (n = 4 per group) of 4-week-old Swiss albino mice. All mice were observed for a period of 45 days for loss or gain in weight and other evidence of toxicity compared with the untreated normal mice. The therapeutic potential of pentoxifylline was then evaluated using a peripheral challenge model as described previously [10] . Briefly, 50 \u00d7 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) of JEV was injected intraperitoneally into four groups of 4-week-old mice (n = 4) and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was breached 2 h later using 1% sterile starch. This was followed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of pentoxifylline (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight) twice daily into three groups of mice for 12 days. A fourth group of mice (n = 4) served as 'no drug controls'. A fifth group of mice (n = 4) served as sham controls and received MEM intraperitoneally and starch intracerebrally. Mice were observed every day for 20 days post infection for the appearance of symptoms and death. At the end of the observation period the mice that survived the infection were sacrificed and their brains were harvested and subjected to JEV antigen detection by IFA, virus nucleic acid detection by real-time PCR and virus isolation as described previously [10] .\n\nThe CC 50 was 500 g/mL for pentoxifylline and 50 g/mL for ribavirin. The antiviral activity of these two compounds was initially evaluated at a non-cytotoxic concentration (<CC 50 ) against JEV using a CPE inhibition assay and subsequently evaluated by the plaque reduction assay. There was a dose-dependent reduction of viral plaques (Fig. 1) with an IC 50 of 50.3 g/mL (0.00018 M) for pentoxifylline and 3.9 g/mL (0.000016 M) for ribavirin. The TI of ribavirin was 13 and the TI of pentoxifylline was 10, suggesting that both compounds are highly active against JEV. \n\nAs a first step to understand the interactions of JEV with the compounds, experiments were designed to determine the kinetics of viral replication in vitro. It was noted that the earliest appearance of JEV antigen in infected PS cells was at 10 h post adsorption as detected by IFA (Fig. 2B) . However, the first infectious progeny of virus was detected in the supernatant medium harvested at 14 h post adsorption (Fig. 2A) . The cells stained at earlier time points (2, 4, 6 and 8 h) were not positive for viral antigen, and the supernatant harvested from them did not yield infectious virus. Based on these findings, it was concluded that a single replicative cycle of JEV in vitro in the PS cell line requires 14 h for completion.\n\nThe antiviral activity of pentoxifylline was subsequently investigated in relation to the kinetics of JEV replication. A non-toxic concentration of pentoxifylline was added at various time points following entry of JEV into PS cells and the experiments were terminated following 48 h of incubation. Pentoxifylline at a concentration of 0.0017 M was able to inhibit JEV replication completely when added to the infected monolayer up to 14 h post infection, as evidenced by the absence of virus yield and soluble antigen. However, beyond 14 h post infection pentoxifylline did not completely inhibit JEV replication (Fig. 3A ). An intriguing observation was the presence of viral antigen expressed in the pentoxifyllinetreated cells from 0 to 14 h, the time points that inhibited virus yield (Fig. 3B ).\n\nThe presence of viral antigen noted in the pentoxifylline-treated cells from 0 to 14 h (Fig. 3B ) prompted us to confirm whether translation of viral proteins remained unaffected. Therefore, viral RNA extracted from a series of time-point experiments was subjected to in vitro translation using a commercial kit. The viral RNA obtained from JEV-infected cells treated with pentoxifylline at two time points (4 and 10 h) showed the presence of a 50-kDa protein that reacted with JEV-specific monoclonal antibodies in a Western blot (Fig. 4) .\n\nIt was observed that i.p. administration of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight was non-toxic to mice, whilst 300 mg/kg body weight showed signs of toxicity (loss of weight and death) and was therefore found to be unsuitable for use in the study. The therapeutic potential of pentoxifylline was evaluated in mice using a peripheral challenge model. Three groups (n = 4 per group) of 4-week-old Swiss albino mice infected with 50\u00d7 LD 50 of JEV by the peripheral route were administered 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight of pentoxifylline by the i.p. route twice daily. Mice that received 200 and 100 mg/kg body weight of pentoxifylline showed 100% protection, whilst mice that received 50 mg/kg body weight of pentoxifylline showed a 50% reduction in mortality. On the other hand, mice that did not receive the drug succumbed to encephalitis within 7 days.\n\nMice that survived the challenge post treatment were sacrificed and their brains were harvested and subjected to virus isolation, detection of viral antigen and viral RNA by RT-PCR. Infectious virus could not be isolated from brain tissues obtained from mice that survived the challenge. Similarly, viral antigen could not be demonstrated in the brain smears by immunofluorescent staining using monoclonal antibodies to JEV. However, viral nucleic acid was detected in the brain homogenate by RT-PCR, suggesting that viral RNA was present in the brain of animals that survived JEV infection following treatment with pentoxifylline.\n\nThe use of agents that can interfere with viral replication and concomitantly suppress viral infection by modulating the immune system is one of the strategies that can be used to prevent viral infections. JEV infection generates a rapid inflammatory response following entry into the host, and elevated levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u2423) have been correlated with poor outcome in JE patients [14] . The pathophysiology of central nervous system inflammation in JEV may be attributed to TNF\u2423, which ranges from promoting viral replication to evasion of host defences [15] . These observations raise the possibility that a compound capable of blocking TNF\u2423 could reduce the severity of JEV infection. Pentoxifylline is a known inhibitor of TNF\u2423 production [16] . Furthermore, recent studies have shown that pentoxifylline exhibits antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and HIV [7, 17] . This study was therefore designed to investigate the antiviral activity of pentoxifylline against JEV in vitro and in vivo.\n\nIn the present study, it was observed that pentoxifylline inhibited JEV replication post-entry into the cell. Our preliminary experiments indicated that this compound neither interfered with viral adsorption nor possessed any virucidal (inactivating) property (data not presented). The extent of antiviral activity was then confirmed using a plaque reduction assay. The results of the confirmatory plaque reduction assay suggested that pentoxifylline and ribavirin were able to inhibit JEV replication in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 ). There was a significant reduction in JEV plaques by pentoxifylline at a concentration well below the CC 50 , with an IC 50 of 50.3 g/mL (0.00018 M), whilst the IC 50 of ribavirin was 3.9 g/mL (0.000016 M). This suggests that both the compounds possess significant inhibitory potential against JEV. It was further observed that both the compounds were highly active against JEV, with a TI of 10 and 13 for pentoxifylline and ribavirin, respectively.\n\nThere are no extensive in vitro studies reported to date on the mechanism of antiviral action of pentoxifylline. In the absence of such information, we asked two crucial questions pertaining to the antiviral activity of pentoxifylline. (i) What is the probable stage at which pentoxifylline inhibits virus replication? And (ii) how late can addition of pentoxifylline to infected cells be delayed to achieve complete inhibition of virus replication? To answer these questions, we used an experimental approach similar to that described by Baginiski et al. [18] . Pentoxifylline was added at 2-h intervals post infection until the completion of one replicative cycle of JEV. It appeared that pentoxifylline was able to inhibit JEV replication very late in the replication cycle. This assumption is based on several findings obtained in this study: (i) the presence of cell-bound antigen detected by IFA at all time points (Fig. 3A) suggests that protein translation is unaffected by the drug; (ii) the presence of a 50 kDa in vitro translation product (Fig. 4) obtained at both 4 h and 10 h post infection further affirmed that translation of viral proteins was unaffected by the drug; and (iii) neither infectious virus nor soluble viral antigen could be detected (Fig. 3B ) in the supernatant of drug-treated cells until 14-h post infection. Taken together, these three observations suggest that pentoxifylline was indeed able to inhibit JEV replication at a stage beyond viral translation, probably interfering with assembly and/or release of the virion. Had pentoxifylline interfered with early or late protein translation, detection of JEV antigen by IFA in drug-treated cells would not have been possible (Fig. 3A) .\n\nHaving established that pentoxifylline was able to inhibit JEV replication in vitro, we investigated its therapeutic potential in an in vivo mouse model. Indeed, this drug at concentrations of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg body weight was able to protect mice completely against a lethal challenge (50\u00d7 LD 50 ) of JEV. Although viral RNA was demonstrated in the brains of all drug-treated mice that survived JEV infection, there were no classical signs of illness observed in any of the mice. This indicates that the virus crossed the BBB following i.p. injection but failed to replicate in the presence of the compounds since there was no viral antigen demonstrable in the brain smears of drug-treated mice. To ascertain that the viral RNA detected in the brain was not due to persistence of infection, virus isolation was carried out using a C6/36 monolayer. It was observed that all the mice that survived the infection failed to demonstrate replicating virus. This indicates the lack of infectious virus in the brains of mice that survived treatment with pentoxifylline. Notwithstanding these observations, it must be emphasised that pentoxifylline is a potent inhibitor of TNF [16] . Recently, it has been reported that JEV induces apoptosis in cell lines via the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway [19] . The underlying mechanism of neuronal apoptosis in JEV has been attributed to the role of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily [20] . Therefore, it is also possible that apart from exhibiting anti-JEV activity, pentoxifylline could have also modulated the TNF responses and protected mice against lethal challenge. However, further studies are warranted to investigate the immunomodulatory role of pentoxifylline in JEV infection.\n\nIn conclusion, this study has presented unambiguous evidence of anti-JEV activity of pentoxifylline, which necessitates the evaluation of this compound in controlled clinical trials."}
