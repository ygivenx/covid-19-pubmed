{"title": "Evaluation of recombinant nucleocapsid and spike proteins for", "body": "The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has been classified as a 2 global pandemic on March 12, 2020, which continues to pose a great threat to global 3 public health. The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV by the 4 World Health Organization at the beginning of the outbreak, and latterly, severe acute 5 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the ICTV (International 6\n\nCommittee on Taxonomy of Viruses) [1] . However, this name is prone to confusion 7 with SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2003, and a suggestion for a distinct name was 8 proposed, human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19) [2] . This novel virus is potentially 9 more transmissible than SARS-CoV and other coronavirus [3], making early 10 diagnosis of it important for clinical treatment and disease control. However, the 11 current nucleic acid testing approach for HCoV-19 [4] carries a negligible 12 false-negative risk [5] . Serological assays are supposedly a powerful approach for 13 achieving timely diagnosis of COVID-19, as is nucleic acid testing, especially for 14 patients with undetectable viral RNA [6] . The serological assays used for early 15 diagnosis are mainly based on detecting specific antibodies against HCoV-19 in a 16 patient's serum and include the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the 17 colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) and the chemiluminescence 18 assay. 19\n\nTo develop a reliable serological assay, it is important to obtain suitable HCoV-19 20 antigens or related recombinant proteins.

Among them, the N-protein is the most abundant, 2 relatively conservative protein in coronaviruses; thus, it is often used as a diagnostic 3 antigen [7] . Our previous study showed that the antigenicity of the COOH terminus is 4 higher than that of the NH 2 terminus in the SARS-CoV N protein, and that the former 5 N protein fragment may have the same antigenicity as that seen with the full-length N 6 protein [8] . In contrast, the S protein is the common target when designing vaccines 7 based on neutralizing antibodies. It contains a receptor binding domain (S-RBD) in 8 the S1 subunit, which mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion [9, 10]. 9\n\nRecently, S-RBD from HCoV-19 was reported to have higher affinity than 10 SARS-CoV to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and also to lack cross-reactivity with 11 monoclonal antibodies against S-RBD from SARS-CoV [3], highlighting the potential 12 value of the S protein for diagnosing HCoV-19. As a transmembrane protein with 13 hydrophobic regions, the S protein is better prepared using a eukaryotic expression 14 system. 15\n\nIn the present study, we prepared six recombinant proteins based on the reported 16 HCoV-19 sequence (GenBank accession MN908947) [11] . Three recombinant N 17 proteins were obtained by prokaryotic expression, including the full-length 18 recombinant N protein (rN), NH 2 terminal (rN1) protein fragments, and COOH 19 terminal (rN2) fragments from this protein. Three recombinant S proteins were also 20 obtained by eukaryotic expression, including an S1 domain (rS1) fragment, the 21 All rights reserved.

Using a dispenser (XYZ3000; 4\n\nBioDot, Irvine, CA), rS1 and the secondary polyclonal antibody (2 mg/mL) were 5 coated onto the nitrocellulose membrane as the test and control lines, respectively, at a 6 dispensing rate of 1.0 \u03bc L/cm.

Finally, 7 the nitrocellulose membrane, conjugate pad, sample pad and the absorbent pads were 8 assembled and cut into 4-mm strips. 9\n\nEvaluating the GICA strips 10 A positive serum sample was serially diluted with running buffer at a ratio of 11 1:10-1:320. The limit of detection of the GICA strip was determined using 100 \u03bc L of 12 the sample, and 0.9% NaCl was used as the blank control. The results could be 13 obtained by naked eyes after 5-10 min. Each test was repeated three times. 14 Additionally, 41 serially-diluted samples collected from healthy men were tested to 15 evaluate the specificity of the GICA strips. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the protein purification, highly pure rS1, rS-RBD-mFc and rS-RBD were obtained 10 ( Figure 1D ). 11\n\nThrough gene subcloning and ligation to the pET vector, recombinant N, N1 and 12 N2 plasmids were constructed and verified by PCR and sequencing ( Figure 1B and C) . 13\n\nThe rN, rN1 and rN2 expression products from IPTG induction at 37\u00b0C in E. coli 14 were identified in the culture supernatants and in the precipitates ( Figure 1E and F), 15 so the induction temperature was lowered to 20\u00b0C, which increased the protein in the 16 supernatants significantly.

Overall, six high-yield recombinant 1 proteins from HCoV-19 with high purities were obtained, as summarized in Table 2 . 2 [ Figure 1 ] 3 [ Table 2 ] 4 Preliminary ELISA evaluation of recombinant proteins 5 Indirect ELISAs were used to preliminarily evaluate the six recombinant proteins. 6\n\nUsing serum samples from seven healthy people as the negative controls, serial 7 samples from two patients in the acute phase (<7 days after symptom onset) of 8 COVID-19 were detected. For the S proteins, the coefficient of variation (CV) for the 9 seven negative samples was 20%-30%. For the N proteins, the CV was 74%-92%, 10 resulting in a high cutoff value. 11\n\nFor IgM detection, all the S proteins had lower backgroud values and higher OD 12 values than those of the N proteins, as well as higher sentivities (1:800) (Figure 2A Overall, rS-RBD-mFc and rS1 were best suited for IgM and IgG detection. 20 All rights reserved.

Additionally, the antigenicity 3 of full-length rN was higher than that of fragments rN1 and rN2, which is consistent 4 with the findings from our previous study on SARS-CoV [8]. However, the higher 5 sensitivity of rN1 over rN2 suggests that the antigenicity of the protein fragment at 6 the NH 2 terminus of the N protein was higher than that at the COOH terminus, which 7 is the opposite result of our previous study on SARS-CoV author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20036954 doi: medRxiv preprint GICA strip performances on serum samples 1 Altogether, 814 serum samples from HCoV-19-suspected patients were tested on 2 GICA strips, including 122 patients confirmed to be RT-PCR positive, 660 confirmed 3 to be RT-PCR negative, and 32 confirmed to be RT-PCR negative but clinically 4 diagnosed by computed tomography (CT).

Moreover, among the 32 RT-PCR negative clinically diagnosed samples, 21 7 (65.63%) were detectable by GICA.

Because the S protein is 10 a transmembrane protein, three S protein fragments were prepared using a eukaryotic 11 expression system, while three N proteins were prepared using a prokaryotic 12 expression system. Preliminary evaluation by indirect ELISA revealed that the three S 13 proteins were superior in performance to the three N proteins. Thus, it can be inferred 14 that the eukaryotically expressed HCOV-19 recombinant S protein is suitable for 15 detection of antibodies from COVID-19 patients for early diagnosis, and is superior to 16 the N protein prepared by prokaryotic expression. However, the antigenicity of S 17 proteins and that of the N proteins could not be confirmed in this study, because the 18 influence of prokaryotic expression method used to produce the N proteins is difficult 19 to predict. The prokaryotically expressed recombinant N proteins were all insoluble 20 precipitates, especially rN2, making it likely that their natural conformations were lost 21 All rights reserved.

Thus, the N protein's antigenicity should be 1 studied after expression in a eukaryotic system in future. 2 GICA, a simple and rapid serological method, is especially suitable for timely 3 diagnosis and large-scale sample screening. A recent study showed that the sensitivity 4 of the total antibody (IgM and IgG) test is higher than that of the IgM or IgG test [16] . 5 Therefore, we developed a sandwich-format GICA with rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc to 6 detect total antibodies in patient serum. The GICA tests were highly sensitive 7 (86.89%) and specific (99.39%), which should help with diagnosing COVID-19 in 8 RT-PCR-negative patients who are clinically confirmed COVID-19 positive by CT. 9\n\nThe detection sensitivity will be improved if we eliminate the sera from patients 10 within the 5 days of symptoms onset. 11 12\n\nIn the study, six recombinant HCoV-19 proteins were prepared and selected. It 14 showed that the eukaryotically-expressed spike proteins (rS1and rS-RBD-mFc) are 15 more suitable than the prokaryotically expressed nucleocapsid proteins for HCoV-19 16 serological diagnosis. The provided recombinant proteins could be used for 17 development of serological diagnostic tools for COVID-19 infections. Here, A 18 sandwich-format GICA strip with the recombinant proteins was developed to detect 19 total antibodies (IgM and IgG) against HCoV-19.
