{"title": "Representation of Protein 3D Structures in Spherical (\u03c1, \u03c6, \u03b8) Coordinates and Two of Its Potential Applications", "body": "Spherical coordinate representation involves the three coordinates \u03c1, \u03c6 and \u03b8, which, when analogized with earth measurements, \u03c6 and \u03b8 would correspond to latitudes and longitudes (in angular units) respectively, while \u03c1 would correspond to elevation, not with respect to sea level, but instead to the center of the earth, which is taken as the 'origin' of the system (e.g. http://www. math. montana. edu/ frankw/ ccp/ multiworld/ multipleIVP/spherical/learn.htm and http:// math.rice.edu/\u223cpcmi/sphere/). \u03c6 goes from 0 \u2022 to 180 \u2022 while \u03b8 goes from 0 \u2022 to 360 \u2022 ; \u03c1 on the other hand, is nonnegative.\n\nWe shall discuss the two applications of the spherical coordinate representation of proteins separately in each section that follows. The first application, that of separating the protein OL from the IC will be called \"OL-IC Separation\", while the second application, that of the identification of protrusions and invaginations on the protein surface, will be termed \"Surface Topography.\" 1.1 Application #1: OL-IC Separation 1.\n\nIt is widely established that proteins fold in such a way that hydrophilic residues are exposed on the surface while hydrophobic ones are buried in the interior, although with some exceptions, such as integral membrane proteins, etc. Thus in general we expect the protein surface to have different properties form the protein interior.\n\nSurface features of proteins include shallow ligand binding sites and active sites (although some are deeply buried), protein-protein interaction sites, posttranslational modifications sites, and epitopes, to name a few. Thus studies of the OL separated from the IC, and vice versa, might find use in drug design, protein inhibition, computational epitope mapping and vaccine design (Gershoni et al., 2007; Tarnovitski et al., 2006; Mumey et al., 2003) . As a proof of concept, we shall describe here a method for the prediction of candidate epitopes using the OL-IC separation method. It involves clustering of points/atomic coordinates in the OL, then screening for locations on it which contains points/atomic coordinates above a certain density as potential epitopes.\n\nWe shall also briefly address the hypothesis that, since they are exceptions to the rule, any hydrophobic residues found within the OL might have biological roles.\n\nBuried features of proteins include deep ligand binding sites and active sites (although some are shallow or close to the surface), prosthetic group binding sites, deep metal ion binding sites, and other features largely hitherto unidentified that contribute to the overall stability and integrity of the folded protein structure.\n\nThe protein IC is largely hydrophobic as the aqueous environment of the cell prefers to interact with the hydrophilic residues which orient themselves on the surface to attain the most energetically stable overall configuration of the protein molecule. Our hypothesis regarding the IC is that occurrence of hydrophilic residues there must have some functional significance to overcome the energy constraint. We thus screened the IC of our test proteins (Laskowski et al., 1996) for hydrophilic residues and demonstrate potential applicability of this method for predicting buried functional sites in proteins.\n\nThe second application involves characterization of the exterior topography of proteins by the detection of invaginations and protrusions on the surface. This application is different from the first in that it does not involve separation of the OL from the IC, but merely an investigation of the \"surface positions\" in a protein molecule, i.e., those positions which are farthest away from the protein centroid. If the protein structure is in spherical coordinate representation with its centroid as origin -as they are in our algorithm -these are the points with maximum \u03c1 in each \u03c6-\u03b8 bin. These positions with \u03c1 maxima may be thought of as objects on the surface of the earth if the earth was the protein.\n\nIn this application, we analyze the frequency distribution (FD) of such \u03c1 maxima and, as we demonstrate in the next section, features emerge in the FD plot that indicate the presence of protrusions and invaginations on the protein surface.\n\nThis application may be of practical importance because protrusions and invaginations on the protein surface commonly have biological significance. For example, clefts may represent ligand binding sites, and protrusions may represent loops or small lobes that open and close onto a binding pocket.\n\nBoth applications require that we partition or bin both \u03c6 and \u03b8 in order to create \"\u03c6-\u03b8 bins\". This binning process can be done coarsely or finely: we define \"coarse binning\" as partitioning both \u03c6 and \u03b8 into 10 \u2022 intervals, while we define \"fine binning\" as partitioning \u03c6 into 6 \u2022 intervals and \u03b8 into 8 \u2022 intervals. Coarse binning results in 18 x 16 = 648 \u03c6-\u03b8 bins, while fine binning results in 30 x 45 = 1,350 \u03c6-\u03b8 bins. We typically use fine binning for proteins in all-atom representation (AAR), while we typically use coarse binning for proteins in reduced representation called 'DCRR' (see below and references following). The two applications dichotomize after the \u03c6-\u03b8 binning step. All constructions and calculations were accomplished by writing and executing Fortran 77 or 90 programs in a UNIX environment.\n\nWith a computational tool to virtually separate the protein OL from its IC, several novel protein structure analytical investigations become more tractable. For instance, the OL can be searched for potential epitopes or protein-protein interactions sites, while the IC can be screened for potential ligand binding sites (LBS) or catalytic sites.\n\nIn a PDB file, the protein structure is represented as an all-atom representation (AAR), where each individual atom of the protein has a Cartesian coordinate. We use a reduced structure representation called the Double Centroid Reduced Representation (DCRR); there is a web server for it and the URL is http:// tortellini.bioinformatics.rit.edu / vns4483 / dcrr.php (Sheth, 2009; Reyes and Sheth, in press ). In this reduced representation, each amino acid is represented as two data points: the centroid of the backbone atoms (N, C\u03b1, C and O), and the centroid of the side-chain atoms (C\u03b2 and beyond). The centroid of the backbone is calculated by finding the average position of the backbone atoms N, C\u03b1, C, and O); similarly the centroid of the side-chain is calculated by finding the average position of the side-chain atoms (C\u03b2 and beyond). One advantage of using DCRR instead of AAR for the protein structure is in reducing the noise, or false positives, that may come up during our analysis.\n\nThe algorithm takes a PDB file, which contains the Cartesian coordinates of the protein, as the first input. The second input is the protein molecular centroid, which is the average of the x, y, and z coordinates of all the (non-hydrogen) atoms in the protein. The entire protein molecule is then translated so that its centroid is at the origin, (0,0,0). Then the protein Cartesian coordinates are converted to spherical coordinates, (\u03c1, \u03c6, \u03b8), using a Fortran 90 program written for the purpose.\n\nThe spherical representation of the protein is partitioned, or binned, in two different modes. In the 'fine binning' mode, the protein is partitioned into 6 \u2022 intervals in \u03c6, and 8 \u2022 intervals in \u03b8, while in the 'coarse binning' mode, it is partitioned into 10 \u2022 intervals in both \u03c6 and \u03b8. Since \u03c6 goes from 0 \u2022 to 180 \u2022 while \u03b8 goes from 0 \u2022 to 360 \u2022 the fine binning mode yields 1,350 \u03c6-\u03b8 bins, and the coarse binning mode yields 648 \u03c6-\u03b8 bins. The \u03c6-\u03b8 binning process is illustrated in Fig. 1 , panels A and B. Fig. 1 The phi-theta binning process. The \u03c6-\u03b8 binning procedure is illustrated in panel A. The \u03c6 and \u03b8 limits used in the binning process are shown. Binning may be fine or coarse depending on the widths of these limits. The surface portion of a \u03c6-\u03b8 bin for a perfect sphere is shown in panel B, the area of which depends on \u03c6 (for a given \u03b8 width). Since proteins are not perfect spheres, the area of the surface of a \u03c6-\u03b8 bin in such a case depends on \u03c1 as well as on \u03c6 (panel C).\n\nThe majority of proteins, especially the globular type, have an inner core (IC) analogous to a 'medulla', and an outer layer (OL) analogous to a 'cortex'. In separating the OL from the IC, the maximum \u03c1 value in each \u03c6-\u03b8 bin is first determined. Then for each \u03c6\u03b8 bin, the protein coordinates with \u03c1 values less than an empirically determined 'cutoff' \u03c1 value (typically 95%\u00b13% of the maximum \u03c1 in the particular \u03c6-\u03b8 bin) are assigned to the IC, while those \u03c1 values equal to or greater than the cutoff \u03c1 value are assigned to the OL. Note that if the protein is in AAR, these points are individual atomic coordinates; if the protein is in DCRR, these points are backbone or side chain centroids. This separation process using \u03c1 cutoff values is illustrated in Fig. 2 . with maximum rho inside each phi-theta bin is illustrated. All other points in the bin are then classified as belonging to the IC or the OL of the protein based on whether they are less than or greater than this cutoff value, respectively.\n\nWith the protein in DCRR and its OL separated from its IC, the amino acid residues naturally fall into four classes, and we term them as follows (see Fig. 3 ): (a) \"OL residues\", in which case both backbone and side chain centroids are located within the OL; (b) \"IC residues\", in which case both backbone and side chain centroids are located within the IC; (c) \"boundary inward residues\", in which case the backbone centroid is in the OL while the side chain centroid is in the IC; and (d) \"boundary outward residues\", in which case the backbone centroid is in the IC while the side chain centroid is in the OL. However, a simpler classification is possible if only the side chain centroids are considered as these points will lie either on the IC or OL but only extremely rarely on the boundary. We shall adopt this last classification. 2.1.5 Using the OL to predict candidate epitopes Our epitope prediction algorithm assumes that potential epitopes are clusters of points (atoms or centroids) on the OL. We thus assign a point density for each \u03c6-\u03b8 bin on the OL; this number is equal to the number of p oints (atoms or centroids) in the \u03c6-\u03b8 bin divided by the area of the \u03c6-\u03b8 bin, which we denote by A \u03c6\u03b8b . Note that by A \u03c6\u03b8b we mean the area of the spherical rectangle bounded by two \u03c6 and two \u03b8 limits. Whereas the number of points in a \u03c6-\u03b8 bin is readily obtained from our algorithm programs, the areas of the \u03c6-\u03b8 bins vary with respect to their location on the surface, with those close to the \"equator\" (\u03c6 = 90 \u2022 ) significantly larger than those lying close to the \"poles\" (\u03c6 = 0 \u2022 and 180 \u2022 ). They also vary with respect to their distances from the protein molecular centroid, with those farther from the molecular centroid (large \u03c1's) larger than those closer to the molecular centroid (small \u03c1's). We thus require a formula for the area of a \u03c6-\u03b8 bin that captures these two dependencies -this idea is illustrated in Fig. 1C Classification of Amino Acid Residues in the OL-IC Separation Fig. 3 Classifying amino acid residues after phi-theta binning. After applying the OL-IC separation procedure for a protein in DCRR, its amino acid residues may be classified as being located in the OL or the IC, based simply on their side chain centroids. If backbone centroids are considered, four possibilities are possible, since residues near the boundary can have backbone and side chain centroids in the OL or IC, respectively, and vice versa.\n\nis:\n\nwhere A \u03c6\u03b8b is the area of a \u03c6-\u03b8 bin that is bounded by \u03c6 1 and \u03c6 2 , and by \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 , and \u03c1 is the maximum \u03c1 in that \u03c6-\u03b8 bin. The derivation of this formula is straightforward and is left to the reader. The point density, D, for each \u03c6-\u03b8 bin is thus equal to B/A \u03c6\u03b8b , where B is the number of coordinates in the \u03c6-\u03b8 bin. For fine binning, the factor |\u03b8 1 -\u03b8 2 | is 8 \u2022 while for coarse binning it is 10 \u2022 Hence A \u03c6\u03b8b depends only on \u03c6 and \u03c1 for a given binning mode. A typical plot of point density (z-axis) as a function of \u03c6 and \u03b8 (x-y plane) is illustrated in Fig. 4 . Peaks in this plot represent clusters of points on the OL of the protein.\n\nThe final step in the algorithm is in determining candidate epitopes from the point density plots. A cutoff value is determined using a distribution curve that is generated by running the density calculation against a comprehensive set of PDB files. From this distribution curve, the top 10% from the mean, is taken to represent potential epitopes. Currently we use the values 8.4 for the coarse binning mode, and 6.6 for the fine binning mode, as minimum point densities in a \u03c6-\u03b8 bin for a point cluster to be classified as a candidate epitope. 2.1.6 Using the IC to find possible protein functional sites After the protein has been separated into the OL and the IC, the IC can be analyzed to find deeply buried However, a pre-processing is needed, since the phi-theta bins have unequal areas. This can be done by using a normalization factor (see text).\n\nWhen the point densities are then plotted against phi and theta, peaks will correspond to such point clusters, which may in turn correspond to potential epitopes.\n\nactive or functional sites. Most proteins fold in a way such that hydrophilic residues are located in the OL while hydrophobic residues are located within the IC of the protein. The IC is thus scanned (using Perl and/or UNIX scripts) for the presence of hydrophilic resides which could be potential buried active or functional sites of the protein.\n\nIn order to illustrate the method in an ideal system, we constructed an \"artificial protein\" in the form of equally-spaced grid of points inside the scalene ellipsoid:\n\nThe distance between neighboring points is 1.5 units along the x, y and z directions to mimic molecular bond lengths in\u00c5. The three major axes of this scalene ellipsoid are of non-identical lengths, namely: Three variants of the artificial protein were created (Figs. 5A and 5B). The first variant was one with an invagination along the shortest dimension of the ellipsoid, at X A = (22, 0, 0). Meanwhile, the second variant was one with a protrusion along the longest dimension of the ellipsoid, at Z A = (0, 0, 30). Finally, the third \n\nThe set of maximum \u03c1 values collected in the last section are arranged from lowest to highest, partitioned or binned in 1.50\u00c5 intervals, and the number of maximum \u03c1 values in each interval counted. These are then plotted as a frequency distribution, with the \u03c1 intervals or bins on the horizontal axis and the frequency in each bin along the vertical axis. We call these plots 'FDMR plots'. This step was applied to both the artificial protein and the real test proteins.\n\nIn the following discussion, we classified the amino acid residues based on the location of their side chains -whether they are located in the OL or IC; the backbone positions were not considered. Thus 'boundary outward' (as described earlier) amino acids were considered to be in the OL, while 'boundary inward' residues are considered to be in the IC.\n\nIn the following discussions, refer to Fig. 6 (6 panels) and Table 1 , which lists the PDB IDs of each protein in the dataset and their 2-letter abbreviations (upper case, lower case) we used. For proteins in AAR, fine binning, OLs of the structures all contain significantly higher percentages of hydrophilic amino acids than hydrophobic ones (Fig. 6A) , except for structure Cc (PDB ID: 2POR, Weiss and Schultz, 1992) , whose OL has slightly more hydrophobic residues. In structures Ap (2YHX, Anderson et al., 1978) , Bm (1HNE, Navia et al., 1989) , Ch (1MNS, Landro et al., 1994) and Cm (2CND, Lu et al., 1995) , the OL is predominantly hydrophilic as expected, but to an extent that seems to be less than average for the group.\n\nOn the other hand, the ICs of all the 67 test structures all contain considerably higher percentages of hydrophobic amino acid residues than hydrophilic ones (Fig. 6B) ; in one case, that of Ck (2ABK, a DNA endonuclease III; Thayer et al., 1995) , the inner core is 100% hydrophobic. In proteins Ay (1ROB, Lisgarten et al., 1993) , and Cc (2POR), the IC is predominantly hydrophobic as expected, but to an extent that seems to be less than average for the group. We also performed coarse binning for proteins in AAR, and the results are very similar to the above (Figs. 6C and 6D ). For proteins in DCRR, coarse binning, the OLs of the structures have all have significantly higher percentages of hydrophilic amino acid residues than hydrophobic residues (Fig. 6E) , except for structures Cc (2POR) and Cm (2CND), which have a higher percentage of hydrophobic residues. In structures As (2CUT, Martinez et al., 1994) , Bk (2ALP, Fujinaga et al., 1985) and Bm (1HNE) the OL is predominantly hydrophilic as expected, but to an extent that seems to be less so than the average for the group.\n\nOn the other hand the ICs of all the structures have higher percentages of hydrophobic amino acid residues than hydrophilic ones (Fig. 6F) , except in Aw (1ONC, Mosimann et al., 1994) and Ay (1ROB) which are predominantly hydrophilic. In Av (1RNH, Yang et al., 1990) , Az (1SNC, Loll and Lattman, 1989) and Ci (3PGM, Winn et al., 1981) , the inner core is still predominantly hydrophobic but to an extent that seems to be less than the average for the group.\n\nIn summary, the major exception cases for the OL (i.e., higher percentage of hydrophobic than hydrophilic amino acid residues) are 2POR and 2CND, while the major exception cases for the IC (i.e., higher percentage of hydrophilic than hydrophobic amino acids) are 1ONC and 1ROB. Protein 2POR is porin, while 2CND is nitrate reductase from corn (Zea mays); both are integral membrane proteins (Trieschmann et al., 1996; Ward et al., 1989 ) that must have hydrophobic OLs. On the other hand, protein 1ONC is P-30, an amphibian ribonuclease, while 1ROB is bovine ribonuclease A. Type A ribonucleases such as 1ONC and 1ROB are known to be composed of two flaps or flattened lobes, at the interface of which lie positively charged residues which together bind the negatively charged RNA substrate, thus explaining their hydrophilic ICs.\n\nTaken together, the above results clearly demonstrate that our spherical coordinate system-dependent OL-IC separation algorithm does its job with reasonable accuracy. \n\nWe tested our epitope prediction method using the dataset of 67 proteins of Laskowski et al., (1996) . Table 2 shows the top 10% proteins with the most number of predicted epitopes, with results from both the fine binning and coarse binning modes (MacCreary, M., personal commun.). The coarse binning mode consistently predicted more candidate epitopes than the fine binning mode. This illustrates the ability for the algorithm to produce either more sensitive or more selective results depending on which binning method is chosen. When these proteins were cross-referenced against the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB; Vita et al., 2010) , it was found that all of these proteins contained true epitopes and were antigenic in some capacity. Discrepancies between the numbers of predicted epitopes and true epitopes is due to several factors, including: overly sensitive candidate epitope cutoff criteria, the incomplete and ever-changing nature of the IEDB and PDB databases, and protein-protein interaction sites that appear to be candidate epitope according to the algorithm. These parameters are currently being refined. \n\nThe analysis of finding possible deeply buried active sites was run against the same set of 67 proteins (Laskowski et al., 1996) referred to above and compared to the set of catalytic sites curated in the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA; Porter et al., 2004) . The number of predicted active sites for each protein using the coarse and the fine binning modes is shown in Table 3 (Kim, D.J., personal commun.). The coarse binning produced a larger number of predicted active sites than the fine binning mode throughout each protein analyzed. Again, this illustrates the ability for the algorithm to produce either more sensitive or more selective results depending on which binning method is chosen. Refinement of the details of the current binning process remains one of our major goals for this project.\n\nfine vs. coarse binning and AAR vs. DCRR The fine and coarse binning methods (fb and cb, respectively) were compared with each other with the protein in AAR as well as in DCRR; we designate these combinations as AAR/fb, AAR.cb, DCRR/fb and DCRR/cb. The algorithm outputted a reduced number of candidate epitopes with AAR/fb and AAR/cb compared to the other two since the \u03c6-\u03b8 bin size is too small and thus atoms in amino acid residues are being split between neighboring bins, or amino acid residues themselves are being precluded from becoming clustered in a single bin, thus preventing the algorithm form \"seeing\" (i.e., detecting) it. This complication is further compounded when atoms in an amino acid residue are split between the OL and the IC of a \u03c6-\u03b8 bin.\n\nWe found that using proteins in DCRR greatly reduced the above ambiguities in the algorithm output (data not shown). When proteins are in DCRR, the amino acid residues may be classified as either in the OL or IC depending on where their side chain centroids are located, which is almost never exactly on the OL-IC boundary. But when the backbone centroids are taken into account, the amino acid residues may be of four types: (a) both backbone and side chain centroids are located within the OL; (b) both backbone and side chain centroids are located within the IC; (c) the backbone centroid is in the OL while the side chain centroid is in the IC; and (d) the backbone centroid is in the IC while the side chain centroid is in the OL (Fig. 3) . We term the first case \"OL residues\", the second case \"IC residues\", the third case \"boundary inward residues\", and the fourth case \"boundary outward residues\". To sum up, we conclude that the best combination method is DCRR/cb, although use of the other three combinations in some special cases (e.g., small proteins or structured peptides) is not ruled out.\n\nBefore applying our procedure to the 67 proteins in our test set, we applied it to the artificial protein we have created and its three variants (Figs. 5A and 5B) .\n\nThe resulting plots are shown in Figs. 7A-7D. The plot for the intact ellipsoid in panel A shows a lone main peak without any shoulder or subpeak anywhere in the plot. The plot for the first variant with the invagination in panel B clearly shows a subpeak on the lagging side of the main peak. A subpeak on the lagging side of the main peak in the FDMR plot is therefore diagnostic of an invagination, especially if this invagination is along the shortest dimension of the ellipsoid. If the invagination does not lie along the shortest dimension, it may be masked in the plot by some points along the shortest dimension, and a subpeak on the lagging side of the main peak will be difficult to see. In such case, the invagination will manifest itself as a non-coincidence between the superimposed FDMR plots of the intact ellipsoid and that of the invagination-containing variant elsewhere along the plot. The plot for the second variant with the protrusion in panel C, on the other hand, clearly shows a subpeak on the leading side of the main peak. A subpeak on the leading side of the main peak in the FDMR plot is therefore diagnostic of a protrusion, especially if the protrusion is along the longest dimension of the ellipsoid. If the protrusion does not lie along the longest dimension, it may be masked in the plot by some points along the longest dimension, and a subpeak on the lagging side of the main peak will be difficult to see. In that case, the protrusion will manifest itself as a non-coincidence between the superimposed FDMR plots of the intact ellipsoid and that of the protrusion-containing variant elsewhere along the plot.\n\nFinally, the plot for the third variant with both the invagination and protrusion in panel D shows two subpeaks, one on the lagging and another on the leading sides of the main peak of the FDMR plot. These results are expected from the results described in the previous two paragraphs.\n\nFrom the above results it may be concluded that an invagination on or close to the shortest dimension of the ellipsoid will result in a clear subpeak on the lagging side of the main peak FDMR plot, while a protrusion on or close to the longest dimension of the ellipsoid will result in a clear subpeak in the leading side of the main peak in the FDMR plot. In the general case where invaginations and protrusions lie on random locations on the ellipsoid surface, the superimposed FDMR plots of the smooth ellipsoid and those of its protrusion-or invagination-containing variants will display segments of non-coincidences on specific corresponding parts of the plots.\n\nDue to space limitations, we can only show four sets of data here corresponding to four proteins in the data set of Laskowski et al. (1996) (Table 1 ). In these results, the FDMR plots of the liganded protein are superimposed with its unliganded form (i.e., ligands deleted from the PDB file before algorithm implementation). The frequency distribution of maximum rhos is plotted for four cases, and the plots corresponding to liganded and unliganded forms were superimposed. In the first case (panel A), non-coincidence of the superimposed plots are seen in the lagging side of the main peak, while in the second case (panel B), non-coincidence of the superimposed plots are seen in the leading side of the main peak.\n\nIn the third case (panel C), general non-coincidence all throughout the plot is evident, while in the fourth case, an almost perfect coincidence is seen.\n\nproteins Cd (1CIL). A subpeak appears on the lagging side of the main peak of the unliganded relative to the liganded form. Fig. 8B shows the plots for protein Bc (1XNB). A subpeak appears on the leading side of the main peak of the unliganded relative to the liganded form. We interpret these results as local changes in the protein structure, giving rise to invaginations and protrusions, respectively, upon ligand binding. Structure 1CIL is that of human carbonic anhydrase II (Smith et al., 1994) , while 1XNB is that of a bacillus xylanase with a bound sulfate ion (Campbell et al., 2011) . Fig. 8C shows the plots for protein Co (4BCL). We notice a general widespread noncoincidence between the two superimposed plots. In Fig. 8D for protein Bg (1BLL), we observe a clean coincidence of the two superimposed plots. Protein 4BCL is that of FMO antennae protein from green sulfur bacteria (Tronrud et al., 2009 ), while 1BLL is that of bovine lens leucine aminopeptidase (Kim and Lipscomb, 1993) . We are continuing to analyze the precise structural meanings of these last two cases as we carefully refine our methods for spherical coordinate protein structure representation. A more comprehensive analysis and refinement of this application will be published in a future submission.\n\nWe have utilized the spherical coordinate system as an alternative to the Cartesian system to represent protein 3D structures. Using this representation, we have developed a way to separate the protein outer layer (OL) from the protein inner core (IC). Being able to separate the OL from the IC allowed us to investigate surface properties (from the OL) and buried properties (from the IC) of the protein systematically and independently. For example, we were able to predict potential epitopes and protein-protein interaction sites from the OL, and buried functional sites such as catalytic residues in the IC. We are convinced that our separation method works properly and is valid because when applied to a test set of 67 protein structures in Laskowski et al. (1996) , we found that all but a few have OLs that are significantly enriched with hydrophilic amino acids and ICs that are significantly enriched with hydrophobic amino acids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that spherical coordinate representation has been utilized in protein 3D structural analysis. Future directions for this project will include use of cylindrical coordinates to represent rod-shaped proteins and viruses and its applications.\n\nTwo web servers, namely, the \"ProtMedCor Web Server\" and \"ProtSurfTop Web Server\" are being set up to implement the OL-IC separation algorithm and the protrusion/invagination detection algorithm, respectively, for public access (MacCreary, M. and Kim, D.J., personal commun.)."}
