{"title": "", "body": "cells are not the only cell population at risk, as TLR7 is expressed in a wide range of different types of neurons as well as in astrocytes and microglia. Lehmann et al. demonstrated that ssRNA40 causes neuronal cell death in mice through binding to TLR7 activating subsequently MyD88 and caspase-3 in a cellautonomous manner exacerbated by microglial inflammatory ssRNA40/TLR7 dependent signaling, while TLR7\u00c0/\u00c0 mice are entirely protected against ssRNA40 induced neuronal death [6] .\n\nNevertheless, only a few concrete examples of viral ssRNA have been identified and experimentally validated as TLR7/8 agonists until now, among them ssRNA40 and the SARS-CoV culprits described by Li et al. Thus, an interesting question is how widespread the feature of owning GU-rich ssRNAs to drive immune cells crazy is. Obviously it is not restricted to a specific viral genus: HIV-1 is a lentivrus, SARS-CoV a coronavirus and a certain flavivirus, the Langat virus (LGTV), looks like another good candidate based on data in press provided by Baker et al. linking TLR7 to the regulation of the neuroinflammatory response to LGTV infection in the CNS [7] . However, the newcomer and outsider among its own genus SARS-CoV, whose overall level of similarity with other coronaviruses is reduced, might have put the finishing touches to this useful tool made of ssRNAs.\n\nBy the way, where doTLR7/8 encounter their viral ssRNA ligands? Given that both receptors are localized in the endosome, it is rather likely that ssRNA ends up there after receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virus or fusion of the viral particle and the infected cell. The strict compartmentalization is a must, as ssRNA with GU-motives is not an exclusive brand of the viral genome and several autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or reumathoid arthritis correlate with CpG DNAs and RNA in extracellular compartments as well as the production of autoantibodies against endogenous RNA [5, 7] . Host-released extracellular RNA is also frequently detected in brains of neurodegenerative disorder patients like Alzheimer's disease, where it contributes in spreading damage of the central nervous system (CNS) through TLR signaling [6] .\n\nPreventing the immune system from going berserk with lethal side-effects at the sight of released nucleic acids turns out to be a tricky one due to the redundancy of the TLR family (10 members in humans). Lee and colleagues proposed recently a strategy relying on nucleic acid-binding cationic polymers as anti-inflammatory agents [8] . Indeed, hexadimethrine bromide (HDMBr) and 1,4-diaminobutane core-PAMAM-G3 (PAMAM-G3) are able to counter the immune stimulatory effect of all nucleic-acid TLR ligands in multiple inflammatory cell types in vitro and in vivo, acting as molecular scavengers both neutralizing the free nucleic acids and altering their intracellular distribution.\n\nTherefore, among the potential therapeutical implications of the findings of Li and colleagues figure the occasion to use viral ssRNA as adjuvants for vaccination and immunotherapy [5] as well as the possibility to stop the escalating immune response by blocking the activation of TLR7/8 by ssRNA either from bacterial or viral attack or inappropriate autoimmune TLR activation [7] .\n\nAfter all, the second merit of SARS will be to have boosted the career of antiviral drug research against coronaviruses, as good as inexistent before 2003.\n\nAlso, better keep away from civets. \n\nWhat triggered your interest in SARS and ssRNA?\n\nMy background comprises microbes, immunology, genomics and bioinformatics. I took part in the work of SARS genome sequencing in the Beijing Genomics Institute et the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2003 [9] . Now I am majoring in the study on the PAMP and TLRs. Given this, I am in general interested in the topic.\n\nWhat was your first reaction when you faced the results? Did you expect them?\n\nNo, this discovery was somewhat occasional. The first reaction was to consider it quite interesting.\n\nHow will the project go on?\n\nWe will look for antagonists of TLR7 and TLR8.\n\nWhat is the take-home message of the article?\n\nAn important pathogen-associate molecule was newly discovered in SARS-CoV.\n\nDo you have a personal motto, quote or leading sentence?\n\nMore reading, more thinking, more investigation, do not let a clue off.\n\nWhat advice would you give to the young next-generation scientists?\n\nWork hard, play hard.\n\nWhat is your favorite hang-out method after a tough day at the lab? I like fishing.\n\nIn your opinion, what are the three most important (scientific) discoveries of the last decade?\n\nCancer pathogenesis, gene regulation associated with life and appearance based on system biology and the new generation of anti-virus medicine. Infection is characterized by fewer followed by a dry cough and shortness of breath. Respiratory failure leads to death in 3e10% of cases. March 2003, the causative agent was identified as a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV having no close relationship with previously characterized coronaviruses transmitted to human by the palm civet. Coronaviruses are positive-strand enveloped viruses who represent major pathogens in mammals and birds, causing enteric and respiratory diseases.\n\nThe SARS-CoV genome displays a high distribution of GU-rich fragments. SARS-CoV GU-rich single-strand RNAs are recognized by host toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR8 leading to high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-12. Injection with SARS-CoV ssRNAs induces an overactive inflammatory response, lung injury and high mortality in mice."}
