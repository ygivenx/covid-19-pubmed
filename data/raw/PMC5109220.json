{"title": "Chikungunya virus infectivity, RNA replication and non-structural polyprotein processing depend on the nsP2 protease\u2019s active site cysteine residue", "body": "CHIKV nsP2 readily cleaved GFP-10:5-Trx substrates containing short P10-P5\u2032 sequences originating from the 1/2 and 3/4 sites but not from the 2/3 site. Consistent with the requirement of nsP3 macro-domain for 2/3 site cleavage, the longer substrate GFP-10:170 was efficiently cleaved (Fig. 1a). Another critical determinant for 2/3 site cleavage, revealed in studies of SFV nsP2, is a requirement for the intact native N-terminus of nsP212. It was found that the removal of just two amino acid residues from the N-terminus of CHIKV nsP2 almost completely abolished the processing of GFP-10:170. However, in contrast to SFV nsP2, the addition of two extra amino acid residues (Gly-Ala) to the N-terminus of CHIKV nsP2 had only a minor effect on the cleavage of GFP-10:170 (Fig. 1a).\n\nNext, experiments were performed using fluorogenic peptide substrates. It has been demonstrated that residues P6 to P1 have a clear impact on the cleavage in the context of protein-based substrates and, most importantly, in the context of infectious virus1115. Accordingly, peptide substrates used previously have been sub-optimal, as they contained only three or four P-side residues313233. Based on the above considerations, peptide substrates representing the P6-P2\u2032 regions of 1/2 and 3/4 sites were designed. However, due to problems in peptide synthesis, we could not obtain a peptide representing the 1/2 site with required (>90%) purity. Therefore only the substrate with the sequence LDRAGG\u2193YI (designated as Short), representing the 3/4 site, was used in subsequent experiments. This substrate was processed by CHIKV nsP2, but the reaction velocity could not be saturated (Fig. 1b). This indicated that the Short substrate was still sub-optimal. Previously, we observed that SFV nsP2 cleaves a substrate having 10 amino acid residues from the P-side more efficiently than substrates having only 6 P-side residues (our unpublished data). Therefore a longer substrate, spanning positions P10 to P5\u2032 (DELRLDRAGG\u2193YIFSS; designated as Long), was used36. This substrate was processed more efficiently than Short (compare Fig. 1b,c). Importantly, the reaction velocity reached a plateau (Fig. 1d) indicating that Long peptide represents a preferred tool for functional studies.\n\nThe protease domain of SFV nsP2 is capable of hydrolysing a 400-fold molar excess of a protein-based substrate in 5 min indicating a cleavage rate of \u22651.3 s\u22121 or \u226578 min\u22121 10. This is largely comparable with data observed for many virus-encoded proteases37. In contrast, Saisawang and colleagues determined a kcat for CHIKV nsP2 as 0.0016 s\u22121 or 0.096 min\u22121 33. Using a previously described assay10 it was found that in 3 min CHIKV nsP2 was able to process approximately 1.8-fold molar excess of a substrate corresponding to the 1/2 site and approximately 14.5-fold molar excess of a substrate representing the 3/4 site (Fig. 1e). Thus, similar to SFV nsP2, the CHIKV enzyme prefers the 3/4 substrate for cleavage in trans. However, in CHIKV the difference in cleavage efficiencies for these two substrates was considerably smaller than previously observed for SFV10, probably because both 1/2 and 3/4 sites of CHIKV have preferred P4 Arg residues15. The cleavage rate for 3/4 substrate was \u22480.08 s\u22121 or 4.8 min\u22121. This activity is very similar to that observed for VEEV protease domain using similar substrates23 and approximately 50-fold higher than reported by Saisawang and colleagues using peptide substrates33.\n\nFinally, we performed estimation of Km and kcat using Long substrate and CHIKV nsP2 with a native N-terminus. By carrying out a protease assay with increasing concentration of Long substrate, the apparent Km was found to be 2.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM (Fig. 1d). In order to estimate kcat for this reaction an approach used for SARS coronavirus 3C protease38 taking into account secondary quenching of EDANS (5-[(2\u2032-aminoethyl)-amino] naphthalenesulfonic acid) fluorescence, was used. The treatment of Long peptide substrate with 20, 30 or 50 \u03bcg of proteinase K reproducibly generated comparable intensity of fluorescence indicating that the substrate was cleaved close to 100% and that proteinase K itself doesn\u2019t affect the fluorescence (Fig. 1d). Using this calibration, the kcat of CHIKV nsP2 for cleavage of Long substrate was found to be \u22482.5 min\u22121, similar to that observed using recombinant protein substrates. Taken together this data also indicates that unlike sub-optimal peptides, a properly designed one (such as Long) does represent a suitable substrate for CHIKV nsP2 protease.\n\nWe mutated the proposed catalytic Cys478 residue of CHIKV nsP2 to Ala (C478A), the Ser482 residue, reported to be able to substitute for Cys478 residue33 to Ala (S482A), and combined these mutations (C478A + S482A). We also mutated the Trp479 residue, adjacent to catalytic Cys478, to Ala (W479A). To obtain purified mutant nsP2 proteins, we first took advantage of the ability of CHIKV nsP2 to tolerate N-terminal tags. Using this approach recombinant wild type (wt) His-nsP2, His-nsP2C478A, His-nsP2S482A and His-nsP2C478A+S482A were all obtained at high purity (Fig. 2a). The identities of all of recombinant proteins were confirmed using mass-spectrometry. The purification of His-nsP2W479A turned out to be difficult; the protein contained a substantial amount of a faster migrating contaminating protein (Fig. 2a). No major E. coli derived protein was revealed by mass-spectrometry in His-nsP2W479A indicating that the faster migrating protein represents truncated form(s) of His-nsP2W479A. Next, the CD-spectra of all purified recombinant proteins were obtained and compared to each other. This analysis revealed that all these proteins were folded similarly with no detectable structural deformity from nsP2 or His-nsP2 (Fig. 2b,c). However, His-nsP2W479A exhibited a CD spectrum with abnormally high ellipticity (Fig. 2c). Together with altered size-exclusion chromatography profiles (not shown) this indicates that His-nsP2W479A most probably forms high molecular weight aggregates.\n\nNext we compared the abilities of His-tagged nsP2 proteins to cleave recombinant protein-based substrates. None of the enzymes was able to cleave recombinant protein containing a short version of the 2/3 site with detectable efficiency. His-nsP2S482A was, however, capable of cleaving substrates containing 1/2, 3/4 and 2/3 (long) sites with efficiency similar to that of wt His-nsP2 (Fig. 3a). His-nsP2W479A was completely inactive, with the caveat of formation of inactive aggregates. Importantly, His-nsP2C478A and His-nsP2C478A+S482A were both also completely unable to cleave 1/2 and 3/4 substrates (Fig. 3a). Surprisingly, both of these mutants were able to cleave, albeit with much reduced efficiencies (compared to wt His-nsP2), 2/3 (long) substrate (Fig. 3a). This result highlights the unique nature of 2/3 site cleavage. Peptide substrates led to results that were identical to those obtained for the corresponding (3/4) recombinant protein based substrate: His-nsP2C478A, His-nsP2C478A+S482A and His-nsP2W479A were all defective in cleavage of both Long and Short substrates while His-nsP2 and His-nsP2S482A had similar activities (Fig. 3b).\n\nAs His-tag alters several enzymatic and non-enzymatic properties of nsP229 it was important to compare the activities of His-tagged nsP2 with those of non-tagged protein. Direct comparison of wt nsP2 and His-nsP2 confirmed that both proteins are active. Using recombinant protein substrates, we were unable to detect significant differences between these two enzymes (Fig. 3c). The assay using peptide substrates revealed that His-nsP2 was slightly (<2-fold) but reproducibly less active than wt nsP2 (Fig. 3e). Thus, the N-terminal His-tag has a small influence on protease activity of CHIKV nsP2.\n\nNext, we introduced the S482A mutation into pET-nsP2 vector designed for production of nsP2 with authentic N-terminus via removal of the N-terminal tag by the protease activity of the protein itself29. NsP2S482A was successfully purified (Fig. 2a). This approach was not applicable for other mutant nsP2 proteins, which were clearly unable to process 1/2 and 3/4 substrates (Fig. 3a,b). Comparison of nsP2 and nsP2S482A in the same experiment revealed no differences in the cleavage of recombinant protein based substrates. Expectedly, both enzymes were also capable of cleaving peptide substrates; in these assays nsP2S482A was slightly, but reproducibly, less active than wt nsP2 (Fig. 3e).\n\nOur analysis carried out using recombinant proteins and different types of substrates shows that unlike reported recently33, Cys478 residue is indispensable and irreplaceable for the ability of CHIKV nsP2 to process any substrate corresponding to 1/2 and 3/4 sites. However, the used systems are artificial: in alphavirus infection the polyprotein context may affect both the activity of the enzyme and the presentation of its substrates11.\n\nTo analyse the effects of mutations in the nsP2 active site region on the processing of CHIKV P1234 polyprotein C478A, W479A, S482A and C478A + S482A substitutions were introduced into T7-P1234 plasmid (Fig. 4a)39. The plasmids, together with wt T7-P1234 and T7-P1234GAA polymerase mutant controls39, were transcribed/translated in vitro, CHIKV ns proteins were precipitated using antibodies against nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4 and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The only specific translation product of T7-P12CA34, T7-P12WA34 and T7-P12CA+SA34 was a large polyprotein; precipitation by all four antibodies confirmed that it was P1234 (Fig. 4b). We could not reliably detect products that could correspond to P12 and P34 polyproteins that would result from the residual processing of 2/3 site by mutant proteases. Thus, it should be concluded that protease present in P12CA34, P12WA34 and P12CA+SA34 polyproteins were completely inactivated. This data confirms that Ser482 cannot substitute for Cys478. The lack of processing of T7-P12WA34 encoded polyprotein indicates that Trp479 is also crucial for nsP2 protease activity. In contrast, all mature ns proteins were detected among the products obtained from T7-P1234, T7-P12SA34 and T7-P1234GAA (Fig. 4b). The amounts of P1234 polyprotein were typically too low to be detected; however, several processing intermediates (P123, P12, P34) were clearly identified (Fig. 4b). Thus, the S482A substitution had no detectable effect on P1234 processing.\n\nMutations that have a strong effect on the processing of CHIKV P1234 in in vitro transcription/translation system do not always have the same effect in living cells1639. Therefore BSR T7/5 (hereafter BSR) cells, a derivative of BHK-21 cells stably expressing T7 RNA polymerase40, were transfected with wt polyprotein T7-P1234 expression construct and its mutant derivatives (Fig. 5a). Cells were lysed at 18 h post transfection (h p.t.) and ns polyproteins and their processing products were analysed using Western blotting. A full set of mature ns proteins was detected in cells transfected with T7-P1234, T7-P12SA34 or T7-P1234GAA (Fig. 5b); coherent with previous observations39 no ns polyproteins could be detected. In contrast, large P1234 polyprotein was the only distinct product detected in T7-P12CA34, T7-P12WA34 or T7-P12CA+SA34 transfected cells; no mature ns proteins or polyproteins that could be identified as P12 or P34 were observed (Fig. 5b). Thus, effects of C478A, W479A and S482A mutations on CHIKV ns polyprotein processing observed in cell-free assays were also reproduced in cell-based assay.\n\nThe functional importance of any mutation in the alphavirus replicase is best assessed by the ability of the viral replicase to perform the amplification and transcription of suitable RNA templates. Here we took advantage of a recently developed CHIKV trans-replicase system39. BSR cells were co-transfected with the T7-Fluc-Gluc plasmid (Fig. 5a) producing a reporter-containing replication-competent RNA39 and plasmids expressing different polyprotein variants. Expression of the firefly luciferase (Fluc) marker, encoded by the 5\u2032 ORF of the replicating RNA template, was amplified more than 300-fold in the presence of T7-P1234 or T7-P12SA34 (Fig. 5c, left panel). In contrast, no amplification of Fluc expression was observed in the presence of T7-P12CA34, T7-P12WA34 or T7-P12CA+SA34 (Fig. 5c, left panel).\n\nThe Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) reporter is translated exclusively from replicase-generated subgenomic RNAs; thus its expression is strictly dependent on the ability of the replicase to synthesize RNA39. Compared to the inactive polymerase mutant, wt replicase activated Gluc expression nearly 100,000-fold. Similar activation was observed for T7-P12SA34 (Fig. 5c, right panel) confirming that fully functional replicase complexes were assembled. Somewhat surprisingly, extremely low, but still detectable (\u224810-fold) activation of Gluc expression was also observed in the presence of constructs harbouring C478A, W479A or C478A + S482A substitutions (Fig. 5c, right panel). The reason(s) for this small activity remain currently unknown though it is possible that unprocessed P1234 may possess minimal RNA synthesis ability. As these effects are extremely minor (activation of Gluc expression is reduced \u224810,000-fold compared to wt P1234), they were only noticed using extremely sensitive CHIKV trans-replicase reporter assay. It is likely that this activity is too low to have biological significance.\n\nUnlike positive-strand RNA, synthesis of negative-strand RNA cannot be revealed using reporter proteins41. Therefore the activity of CHIKV replicases harbouring nsP2 mutations was also analysed using Northern blotting. SFV replicase, harbouring the same set of mutations, was used for comparison. For unknown reasons, CHIKV replicase was rather inefficient in using template RNA derived from T7-Rluc-Tom vector (Fig. 6a); in contrast SFV replicase efficiently utilized template RNA derived from Tmed42. Nevertheless, it was clearly and consistently detected that in addition to wt replicases, only replicases harbouring S482A substitution were capable of negative-strand RNA synthesis (Fig. 6b). In fact, the synthesis of negative strands was slightly but reproducibly increased by this mutation, most likely due to slight reduction of protease activity of nsP2 (Fig. 3e) leading to increased half-life of early replicase complex.\n\nIt was also found that levels of positive-strand RNAs exceeded background levels (detected in the absence of enzymatically active replicase) only in the presence of wt replicases and those harbouring S482A substitution (Fig. 6c). Together with data obtained for negative-stand RNA synthesis, this confirms that only these replicases are active. This data complements our previous findings and clearly indicates that replicases harbouring C478A, W479A or C478A + S482A substitutions are incapable of both negative- and positive-strand RNA synthesis. Importantly, the activities of SFV replicase were affected by all protease active site mutations in the same way as those of CHIKV replicase (Fig. 6b,c). This is consistent with our data highlighting that the properties of CHIKV nsP2 protease are very similar to those previously revealed for SFV nsP210121415.\n\nWe verified the effects of the protease mutations also in the context of CHIKV RNAs obtained by transcription of infectious cDNA clones (Fig. 7a). Infectious centre assay (ICA) performed after RNA transfection revealed that the rescue efficiencies of wt CHIKV and CHIKVS482A were similar (Fig. 7a). No plaques were detected for cells transfected with the three other mutants. Next, cells were transfected with 10 \u03bcg RNA transcripts (corresponding to \u2248106 plaque forming units (PFU) for wt CHIKV). Cells transfected with wt CHIKV and CHIKVS482A transcripts displayed strong cytotoxic effects by 18 h p.t. In contrast, no cytotoxicity was observed for the other transcripts even at 144 h p.t. To study the presence of replicating virus genomes in the cells, all the transfected cultures were analysed for the presence of capsid protein (expression of which is completely dependent on viral RNA replication). High amounts of mature capsid protein (as well as some amounts of its precursors) were detected in cells transfected with transcripts of pSP6-CHIKV and pSP6-CHIKVS482A. In contrast, no capsid protein could be detected in cells transfected with pSP6-CHIKVC478A, pSP6-CHIKVW479A or pSP6-CHIKVC478A+S482A transcripts (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, while wt CHIKV and CHIKVS482A reached comparable high titers (7.5 \u00d7 108 and 6.5 \u00d7 108 PFU/mL, respectively) and formed plaques of similar size (not shown) no infectious virus was detected in the other three samples. Taken together, this data unequivocally demonstrates that mutations C478A and W479A not only abolish ns polyprotein processing but are also lethal for CHIKV.\n\nTo analyse the effect of S482A mutation on ns polyprotein processing in the context of CHIKV infection, a pulse-chase experiment was performed. For wt CHIKV infected cells all ns proteins, P1234 precursor and P123, P12 and/or P34 processing intermediates were detected in pulsed samples (Fig. 7c). In samples chased for 15 min the amounts of P1234 were reduced; after 60 min chase all ns polyproteins were poorly detectable. In contrast, the amounts of mature ns proteins (with the exception of unstable nsP4) increased during the chase. No significant differences from this pattern were observed for CHIKVS482A (Fig. 7c). This data confirms that S482A substitution has no negative effect on ns polyprotein processing in CHIKV infected cells.\n\nFinally, it was analysed whether the S482A substitution affects the replication complex (spherule), replication organelle (cytopathic vacuoles, CPV) or progeny virion formation. Comparison of wt CHIKV and CHIKVS482A revealed no detectable differences in the formation of any of these virus-specific structures (Fig. 8) confirming that Ser482 residue is dispensable for the CHIKV infectious cycle.\n\nThus far the data regarding the properties of CHIKV nsP2 protease has been controversial. As this enzyme is central for CHIKV infection and represents a favoured target for anti-CHIKV inhibitor development, revealing the processing requirements of the enzyme and the significance of residues located in its active site region was essential.\n\nThe easiest way to study protease activities is to use a purified enzyme and corresponding substrate(s). However, as during the infection process the enzymatic activities of viral enzymes are affected by multiple factors, using a single type of assay provides poor grounds to draw conclusions about the properties of nsP2, including quantitative efficacy. Furthermore, cell-free assay does not provide information about the biological relevance of the observed effects.\n\nHere it was observed that the substrate requirements of CHIKV nsP2 protease were similar to those reported for its SFV counterpart. At the same time the protease activity of CHIKV nsP2 was considerably lower than that previously reported for the protease domain of SFV nsP210. Most likely this reflects differences in the basic enzymatic activities of the proteases from different alphaviruses. CHIKV nsP2 harbours a Glu residue in position 515 that is predicted to be part of the S4 subsite of the enzyme22. In contrast, the SFV protease has Val515 that was shown to increase the ability of nsP2 to process P34 polyprotein in infected cells43. Thus, it is possible that in order to compensate for the presence of preferred P4 Arg residue in the 1/2 site of P1234 polyprotein, CHIKV nsP2 must have lower basal protease activity; the same has previously been observed for the avirulent A7(74) strain of SFV43.\n\nThe current work also reinforces the crucial role of Cys478 residue in the catalytic site of nsP2 protease. We found no evidence that the enzyme harbouring C478A mutation is capable of cleaving any versions of substrates corresponding to 1/2 and 3/4 sites. Furthermore, this mutation blocked all the essential biological activities of the corresponding replicases and virus. Expectedly, no detectable cleavage of short 2/3 substrate by any recombinant enzyme was observed. However, with the exception of His-nsP2W479A that likely forms enzymatically inactive aggregates, all the used enzymes were capable of inducing the cleavage of 2/3 long substrate. Again, Cys478 but not Ser482 residue was crucial for full efficiency of that cleavage reaction; however, when Cys478 was substituted with Ala, low level processing was still observed. The mechanism responsible for this process remains enigmatic though it certainly was not due to the proposed compensatory effect of Ser482 residue (Fig. 3a). Biophysical or perhaps even structural experiments are required to clarify mechanism(s) responsible for this cleavage. Interestingly, it has been previously observed that processing of 2/3 long substrate is also insensitive to the effect of Pro718 to Gly mutation in nsP2 that severely reduces processing of other substrates16. This indicates that due to its unique macromolecular assembly dependent mode of cleavage, the processing of 2/3 site is greatly enhanced by, but not totally dependent on, the Cys478 residue. It should, however, be emphasized that the unusual processing of 2/3 site was not detected upon more natural conditions, such as processing of P1234 in the test tube or in cells and that Cys478 to Ala mutation was irreparably lethal. Thus, it is possible that this residual cleavage activity may represent an artefact of cell-free assays.\n\nThe sequence of the active site motif of CHIKV nsP2 (476-NVCWAKS-482) is very similar to that of VEEV nsP2 (475-NVCWAKA-481). Interestingly, the significance of residues 475 and 480 of nsP2 of VEEV (corresponding to Asn476 and Lys481 in CHIKV nsP2) for protease activity has been recently demonstrated. The substitution of Asn residue with Ala led to 25-fold reduction in kcat/Km of the enzyme. Mutation of Lys residue to Ala led to a 9-fold decrease in kcat and kcat/Km23. Thus, together with the data presented in this study, the importance of most residues in the active site motif of alphavirus nsP2 protease has been demonstrated. Two conserved residues (Cys478 and Trp479) are critically important for protease activity; residues N476 and K481 modulate the activity of the enzyme while substitution of Ser482 to Ala, a residue naturally occurring in the analogous position of VEEV and many other alphaviruses, has little to no effect. For different alphaviruses corresponding position can be occupied also by Cys or Thr residues indicating that considerable variation is tolerated in this position.\n\nAlphavirus nsP2 proteases have not been systematically compared to each other using identical experimental conditions. However, similarities in 3D structures and data from the analysis of functionally important residues strongly indicate that there are no significant differences, at least regarding the functional significance of active site motif residues, between the enzymes encoded by different alphaviruses. CHIKV nsP2 is not an exception; it is a typical alphavirus cysteine protease. Contrary to the recent report, the Ser482 residue from the active site motif of CHIKV nsP2 cannot to any extent compensate for the loss of the catalytic Cys478 residue. The conserved nature of CHIKV nsP2 with its counterparts from different alphaviruses indicates that similar approaches can be used to study these enzymes and their roles in virus infection as well as develop and select for inhibitors of different alphavirus proteases. This opens the possibility that one compound could inhibit nsP2 proteases from different alphaviruses.\n\nAll cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 atmosphere; 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. BHK-21 cells (ATCC CCL-10) were grown in Glasgow\u2019s Minimal Essential Medium (GMEM, Gibco) containing 2% tryptose phosphate broth and 200 mM HEPES. BSR cells were cultured in the same medium supplemented with 1 mg/mL of G418.\n\nPlasmids pET-nsP2, designed for expression of CHIKV nsP2 (ECSA genotype, isolate LR-2006-OPY1) with native N-terminus, and pET-His-nsP2, encoding CHIKV nsP2 preceded by amino acid sequence MNHHHHHH-SGGGS-ENLYFQ29, were used for expression of wt nsP2 and wt His-nsP2 proteins, respectively. Expression vectors designated pET-nsP2S482A, pET-His-nsP2C478A, pET-His-nsP2C478A+S482A, pET-His-nsP2W479A and pET-His-nsP2S482A containing mutations resulting in the specified amino acid substitutions in nsP2 were generated via PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmids pET-nsP2-delN2 and pET-nsP2-insN229 were used for expression of nsP2 with deletion of 1st and 2nd amino acid residues at the N-terminus or with addition of GA dipeptide to the N-terminus, respectively. The sequences of all the expression constructs were verified through DNA sequencing.\n\nEGFP-10:5-Trx substrates, containing short versions of the 1/2, 2/3 or 3/4 sites, as well as the longer version of the substrate corresponding to 2/3 site (EGFP-10:170) were purified as previously described16. The expression and purification of wt His-nsP2, His-nsP2C478A, His-nsP2C478A+S482A and His-nsP2S482A was performed as previously described29. Due to very low expression level purification of His-nsP2W479A protein was performed from 3 litres of induced E. coli culture. After loading the cleared cell lysate onto the Ni-affinity column an additional washing step with buffer containing 5 mM ATP:Mg and E. coli denatured proteins (0.1 mg/mL) was performed in order to remove the contaminating proteins44. It was also observed that His-nsP2W479A did not properly bind to the cation exchange column and remained mostly in the column flow-through, which was therefore used for its further purification using procedures applied for other His-nsP2 proteins. From Superdex 200 10/300GL size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare, UK) His-nsP2W479A eluted with much shorter retention time compared to other nsP2 proteins. Proteins wt nsP2, nsP2-delN2 and nsP2-insN2 were purified using previously described self-cleavage based procedure29; the same approach was used to obtain purified nsP2S482A. Protein concentrations were measured using Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA); proteins were flash-frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. The authenticity of all the purified proteins was verified by mass spectrometric analysis.\n\nCircular dichroism (CD) spectrum measurements for recombinant wt nsP2, nsP2S482A, His-nsP2, His-nsP2C478A, His-nsP2W479A, His-nsP2S482A and His-nsP2C478A+S482A were carried out as previously described16. Briefly, CD spectra were recorded on a Chirascan plus CD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) three consecutive times in the far-UV region from 185 to 260 nm at a protein concentration of 0.8 \u03bcM (with the exception of His-nsP2W479A which was at 0.5 \u03bcM) in CD buffer (10 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.2 and 100 mM NaF). The final spectra were obtained after deducting the mean spectra of buffer from the mean spectra of protein samples.\n\nA protease assay using recombinant proteins as substrates was performed as previously described16. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 60 min, followed by the addition of 2xSDS loading buffer. Samples were boiled and resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE. To analyse processing kinetics, wt nsP2 was mixed with recombinant proteins containing cleavage sequences (10:5) from 1/2 and 3/4 sites using molar ratio 1:100. The reaction was carried out in 150 \u03bcL volume using previously described16 conditions; 15 \u03bcL aliquots were collected at 0 (before adding enzyme), 1, 3, 6, 15, 30, 60 and 90 min and analysed using 10% SDS-PAGE.\n\nContinuous protease assays were performed using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approach. Two types of peptide substrates were used: peptide comprising 15 amino acid residues (DELRLDRAGG\u2193YIFSS) or 8 amino acid residues (LDRAGG\u2193YI) from the 3/4 site (arrow indicates the scissile bond). These substrates, designated respectively as Long and Short, were purchased from GenScript (USA). Both substrates contained 4-[[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-azo] benzoic acid (DABCYL) and EDANS at the amino and carboxy termini, respectively. The fluorogenic reactions were performed as previously described36.\n\nMichaelis-Menten plot (Fig. 1d) was generated by performing nsP2 protease reaction at various concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 50 \u03bcM) of substrate. The velocity of the reaction was linear over several minutes indicating that the enzyme was working at its maximum velocity. Hyperbolic plot was generated by plotting initial velocity against the increasing substrate concentration.\n\nEDANS standard curve was generated after considering the inner filter effect45. Briefly, increasing concentration of substrate (0 to 2000 nM as shown in Fig. 1d inset) were treated with 20, 30 or 50 \u03bcg of proteinase K (Thermo Scientific) in a final reaction volume of 200 \u03bcL at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The relative fluorescence units (RFU) of EDANS were measured on a Synergy MX microplate reader (BioTek, USA) at excitation wavelength of 340 nm and emission wavelength of 490 nm. The values were plotted using Microsoft Excel software and RFU to nM conversion were calculated from the equation of the line.\n\nPoint mutations, resulting in the following changes of encoded nsP2 protein, were made using T7-P1234 plasmid39 and PCR-based site directed mutagenesis; designations of the obtained constructs are provided in parentheses: Cys478 to Ala (T7-P12CA34), Trp479 to Ala (T7-P12WA34), Ser482 to Ala (T7-P12SA34) and Cys478 and Ser482 to alanine residues (T7-P12CA+SA34). To introduce similar mutations into SFV trans-replicase plasmid P123Z442, hereafter designated as SFV-T7-P123Z4, PCR-based site directed mutagenesis was used. The obtained plasmids were designated as SFV-T7-P12CA3Z4, SFV-T7-P12WA3Z4, SFV-T7-P12SA3Z4 and SFV-T7-P12CA+SA3Z4. The sequences of the constructs were verified through DNA sequencing.\n\nIn vitro transcription and translation were carried out using the TNT-coupled T7 rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Reaction mixtures (50 \u03bcL) containing 20 \u03bcCi of [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture (Perkin-Elmer) and 2 \u03bcg of a T7-P1234, T7-P12CA34, T7-P12WA34, T7-P12SA34, T7-P12CA+SA34 or T7-P1234GAA 39 were incubated for 90 min at 30 \u00b0C; translation was stopped by adding cycloheximide to a final concentration of 1 mM. RNase A was added at a final concentration of 10 ng/\u03bcL, and the mixtures were incubated for another 5 min. Immunoprecipitation of CHIKV ns proteins and polyproteins was performed as previously described16 using rabbit polyclonal antisera against nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4 (all in-house). The precipitated proteins were denatured by heating in Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized using a Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare).\n\nAnalysis of CHIKV trans-replicase activity was performed as previously described39. Briefly, BSR cells, grown on 35 mm plates to 90% confluence, were co-transfected with mixtures consisting of 1 \u03bcg of plasmid encoding wt or mutant CHIKV replicase and 1 \u03bcg of T7-Fluc-Gluc, a plasmid for expression of an RNA template39, using Lipofectamine LTX reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s (Invitrogen) protocols. At 18 h p.t. cells were lysed with Renilla luciferase (Rluc) assay lysis buffer (Promega); activities of Fluc and Gluc were analysed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit and Glomax SIS luminometer (Promega).\n\nThe levels of replicase-generated positive- and negative-strand RNAs present in transfected cells were analyzed by Northern blotting as previously described in ref. 46, with some modifications. Briefly, BSR cells co-transfected with 1 \u03bcg of plasmid encoding wt or mutant CHIKV replicase (T7-P1234, T7-P12CA34, T7-P12WA34, T7-P12SA34, T7-P12CA+SA34 or T7-P1234GAA) and 1.25 \u03bcg of T7-Rluc-Tom39 were lysed at 18 h p.t. with TRIsure reagent (Bioline), followed by RNA isolation according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Eight micrograms total RNA was fractionated on a denaturing 1% agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon filter (GE Healthcare). RNA was cross-linked to the membrane with Stratalinker (Stratagene). 33P-labeled RNA probes were made by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase from PCR-amplified DNA fragments containing sequences of the Rluc gene and the T7 promoter. The probe for positive-strand RNA detection corresponded to nucleotides 676 to 32, and the probe for negative-strand RNA detection corresponded to nucleotides 38 to 623 of the Rluc gene as present on template constructs. Hybridization was performed at 60 \u00b0C overnight, followed by several washes and 4 days exposure. Detection was performed using Typhoon Trio (GE Healthcare) instrument. Detection of positive- and negative-strand RNAs generated by SFV replicase was performed similarly except that Tmed46 was used as source of template RNA and plasmids SFV-T7-P123Z4, SFV-T7-P123Z4GAA, SFV-T7-P12CA3Z45, SFV-T7-P12WA3Z4, SFV-T7-P12SA3Z4 and SFV-T7-P12CA+SA3Z4 were used to express different forms of SFV replicase.\n\nMutations resulting in changes of Cys478 to Ala, Trp479 to Ala, Ser482 to Ala or Cys478 and Ser482 to alanine residues of nsP2 were introduced into pSP6-CHIKV (an infectious cDNA clone of CHIKV ECSA genotype, LR-2006-OPY1 isolate47); obtained clones were designated pSP6-CHIKVC478A, pSP6-CHIKVW479A, pSP6-CHIKVS482A and pSP6-CHIKVC478A+S482A. All these manipulations were done by using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and subcloning procedures; sequences were verified.\n\nPlasmids containing CHIKV cDNA were linearized and transcribed in vitro using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Transcription kit (Ambion), to obtain capped RNAs. These procedures as well as ICA were performed as previously described16. Recombinant viruses (wt CHIKV and CHIKVS482A) were harvested at 18 h p.t.; for cells transfected with transcripts of pSP6-CHIKVC478A, pSP6-CHIKVW479A or pSP6-CHIKVC478A+S482A the cell culture supernatants were collected at 144 h p.t. The transfected cells were collected at the same time and lysed by boiling in Laemmli buffer.\n\nCells transfected with 1 \u03bcg of T7-P1234, T7-P12CA34, T7-P12WA34, T7-P12SA34, T7-P12CA+SA34 or T7-P1234GAA were lysed at 18 h p.t. with SDS loading buffer; lysates from cells transfected with RNA transcripts were obtained as described above. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected using primary antibodies against CHIKV ns proteins (trans-replicase transfected cells) or against CHIKV capsid protein (RNA transcript transfected cells). Antibody against \u03b2-actin (sc-47778; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as loading control. The membranes were then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (LabAs Ltd, Estonia) and proteins were visualized using ECL Immunoblot Detection kit (GE Healthcare).\n\nPulse-chase labelling of infected BHK-21 cells was carried out as described previously15. Briefly, BHK-21 cells were infected with wt CHIKV or CHIKVS482A at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 PFU/cell. At 3 h post infection the cells were starved in methionine-cysteine-free DMEM (Life Technologies) for 30 min and then labelled with 50 \u03bcCi of [35S] methionine-cysteine mixture (Perkin-Elmer) for 15 min (pulse). In the chase samples, the pulse was followed by a chase for 15 or 60 min in medium containing an excess of unlabelled methionine and cysteine. The cells were then lysed by boiling in 1% SDS, proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using combinations of antibodies (nsP1 + nsP3 and nsP2 + nsP4), separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized using a Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare).\n\nBHK-21 cells were seeded onto 35 mm glass-bottom dishes (P35G\u20131.5-14-C; MatTek). The next day, cells were infected with wt CHIKV or CHIKVS482A at MOI 10 PFU/cell. 8 h post infection, the supernatant was discarded and cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 30 min at room temperature and washed in the same buffer. Sample preparation for transmission electron microscopy was done as described earlier48. Sections were imaged in JEOL JEM-1400 electron microscope operated at 80 kV and images were acquired by a bottom-mounted camera Gatan Orius SC 1000B (Gatan Inc.).\n\nHow to cite this article: Rausalu, K. et al.
