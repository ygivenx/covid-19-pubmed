{"title": "", "body": "scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around \u223c0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February. this third zoonotic human coronavirus are still unknown. Using the serial intervals (SI) 23 of the two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations 24 for the true unknown SI, Zhao et al. estimated the mean basic reproduction number 25 (R 0 ) of SARS-CoV-2 to range between 2.24 (95% CI: 1.96-2.55) and 3.58 (95% CI: 26 2.89-4.39) in the early phase of the outbreak [10] . Very similar estimates, 2.2 (95% CI: 27 1.4-3.9), were obtained for R 0 at the early stages of the epidemic by Imai et al. 2.6 (95% 28 CI: 1.5-3.5) [11] , as well as by Li weeks [12] . Amidst such an important ongoing public health crisis that also has severe 33 economic repercussions, we reverted to mathematical modelling that can shed light to 34 essential epidemiologic parameters that determine the fate of the epidemic [13] . Here, 35 we present the results of the analysis of time series of epidemiological data available in 36 the public domain [14] [15] [16] (WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC and DXY) from January 11 to 37 February 10, 2020, and attempt a three-week forecast of the spreading dynamics of the 38 emerged coronavirus epidemic in the epicenter in mainland China. Our analysis was based on the publicly available data of the new confirmed daily cases 41 reported for the Hubei province from the 11th of January until the 10th of values of the main epidemiological parameters, i.e. the basic reproduction number R 0 , 44 the case fatality (hat\u03b3) and case recovery (\u03b2) ratios, along with their 90% confidence 45 intervals. However, as suggested [17] , the number of infected, and consequently the 46 number of recovered, people is likely to be much higher. Thus, in a second scenario, we 47 have also derived results by taking twenty times the number of reported cases for the 48 infected and forty times the number for the recovered cases, while keeping constant the 49 number of deaths that is more likely to be closer to the real number. Furthermore, by 50 calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to fit the reported data, we also provide 51 tentative forecasts until the 29th of February. 52 The basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is one of the key values that can predict 53 whether the infectious disease will spread into a population or die out. R 0 represents 54 the average number of secondary cases that result from the introduction of a single 55 infectious case in a totally susceptible population during the infectiousness period. 56 Based on the reported data of confirmed cases, we provide estimations of the R 0 from 57 the 16th up to the 20th of January in order to satisfy as much as possible the 58 hypothesis of S \u2248 N that is a necessary condition for the computation of R 0 . 59 We also provide estimations of the case fatality (\u03b3) and case recovery (hat\u03b2) ratios 60 over the entire period using a rolling window of one day from the 11th of January to the 61 16th of January to provide the very first estimations. 62 Furthermore, we calibrated the parameters of the SIRD model to fit the reported 63 data. We first provide a coarse estimation of the recovery (\u03b2) and mortality rates (\u03b3) of 64 the SIRD model using the first period of the outbreak. Then, an estimation of the 65 infection rate \u03b1 is accomplished by \"wrapping\" around the SIRD simulator an 66 optimization algorithm to fit the reported data from the 11th of January to the 10th of 67 February. We have started our simulations with one infected person on the 16th of 68 November, which has been suggested as a starting date of the epidemic and run the SIR 69 model until the 10th of February. Below, we describe analytically our approach. Let us start by denoting with S(t), I(t), R(t), D(t), the number of susceptible, 71 infected, recovered and dead persons respectively at time t in the population of size N . 72 For our analysis, we assume that the total number of the population remains constant. 73 Based on the demographic data for the province of Hubei N = 59m. Thus, the discrete 74 SIRD model reads:\n\nThe above system is defined in discrete time points t = 1, 2, . . ., with the 76 corresponding initial condition at the very start of the epidemic:\n\nHere, \u03b2 and \u03b3 denote the \"effective/apparent\" the per day 78 recovery and fatality rates. Note that these parameters do not correspond to the actual 79 per day recovery and mortality rates as the new cases of recovered and deaths come 80 from infected cases several days back in time. However, one can attempt to provide 81 some coarse estimations of the \"effective/apparent\" values of these epidemiological 82 parameters based on the reported confirmed cases using an assumption and approach 83 described in the next section.\n\nMarch 10, 2020 3/28 .

Initially, when the spread of the epidemic 87 starts, all the population is considered to be susceptible, i.e. S \u2248 N . Based on this 88 assumption, by Eq.(2),(3),(4), the basic reproduction number can be estimated by the 89 parameters of the SIRD model as:\n\nLets us denote with \u2206I(t) = \n\nwhere, X = I, R, D. can provide a coarse estimation of the parameters R 0 , \u03b2 and \u03b3 as follows.\n\nStarting with the estimation of R 0 , we note that as the province of Hubei has a 101 population of 59m, one can reasonably assume that for any practical means, at least at 102 the beginning of the outbreak, S \u2248 N .

Having provide an estimation of the above \"effective\" approximate values of the 156 parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3, an approximation of the \"effective\" infected rate \u03b1, that is not 157 biased by the assumption of S = N , can be obtained by using the SIRD simulator. In 158 particular, in the SIRD model, the values of the \u03b2 and \u03b3 parameters were set equal to 159 the ones found using the reported data solving the corresponding least squares problems 160 given by Eq. (14), (15) . As initial conditions we have set one infected person on the 16th 161 of November and run the simulator until the last date for which there are available data 162 (here up to the 10th of February). Then, the optimal value of the infection rate \u03b1 that 163 fits the reported data was found by \"wrapping\" around the SIRD simulator an 164 optimization algorithm (such as a nonlinear least-squares solver) to solve the problem: 165\n\nwhere\n\nwhere, C\u2206X SIRD (t), (X = I, R, D) are the cumulative cases resulting from the 166 SIRD simulator at time t; w 1 , w 2 , w 3 correspond to scalars serving in the general case as 167 weights to the relevant functions. For the solution of the above optimization problem we 168 used the function \"lsqnonlin\" of matlab [20] using the Levenberg-Marquard algorithm. 169\n\nAs discussed, we have derived results using two different scenarios (see in 171 Methodology).For each scenario, we first present the results for the basic reproduction 172 number as well as the case fatality and case recovery ratios as obtained by solving the 173 least squares problem using a rolling window of an one-day step. For their computation, 174 we used the first six days i.e. from the 11th up to the 16th of January to provide the 175 very first estimations. We then proceeded with the calculations by adding one day in 176 the rolling window as described in the methodology until the 10th of February. We also 177 report the corresponding 90% confidence intervals instead of the more standard 95% 178 because of the small size of the data. For each window, we also report the 179 March 10, 2020 6/28 .

As more data are taken into 203 account, this variation is significantly reduced. Thus, using all the available data from 204 the 11th of January until the 10th of February, the estimated value of the case fatality 205 ratio\u03b3 is \u223c 2.94% (90% CI: 2.9%-3%) and that of the case recovery ratio\u03b2 is \u223c 0.05 206 (90% CI: 0.046-0.055). It is interesting to note that as the available data become more, 207 the estimated case recovery ratio increases significantly from the 31th of January (see The computed approximate values of the \"effective\" per day mortality and recovery 212 rates of the SIRD model were \u03b3 \u223c 0.01 and \u03b2 \u223c 0.064 (corresponding to a recovery 213 period of \u223c 15 d). Note that because of the extremely small number of the data used, 214 the confidence intervals have been disregarded. Instead, for our calculations, we have 215 considered intervals of 20% around the expected least squares solutions. Hence, for \u03b3, 216 we have taken the interval (0.008 and 0.012) and for \u03b2, we have taken the interval 217 between (0.05 0.077) corresponding to recovery periods from 13 to 20 days. As 218 described in the methodology, we have also used the SIRD simulator to provide an 219 estimation of the \"effective\" infection rate \u03b1 by optimization with w 1 =1, w 2 =2, w 3 =2. 220 Thus, we performed the simulations by setting \u03b2=0.064 and \u03b3=0.01, and as initial Thus, the expected trends of the simulations suggest that the mortality rate is lower 241 than the estimated with the current data and thus the death toll is expected, to be 242 significantly less compared with the expected trends of the predictions. period January 16-January 20. Using the first six days from the 11th of January to the 257 16th of January,R 0 results in 3.2 (90% CI: 2.4-4.0); using the data until January 17,R 0 258 results in 3.1 (90% CI: 2.5-3.7); using the data until January 18,R 0 results in 3.4 (90% 259 CI: 2.9-3.9); using the data until January 19,R 0 results in 3.9 (90% CI: 3.3-4.5) and 260 using the data until January 20,R 0 results in 4.5 (90% CI: 3.8-5.3).\n\nIt is interesting to note that the above estimation of R 0 is close enough to the one 262 reported in other studies (see in the Introduction for a review). and\u03b3 should be attributed to the small size of the data and data uncertainty. This is 267 also reflected in the corresponding confidence intervals. As more data are taken into 268 account, this variation is significantly reduced. Thus,using all the (scaled) data from the 269 11th of January until the 10th of February, the estimated value of the case fatality ratio 270 \u03b3 now drops to \u223c 0.147% (90% CI: 0.144%-0.15%) while that of the case recovery ratio 271 is \u223c 0.1 (90% CI: 0.091-0.11). It is interesting also to note, that as the available data 272 become more, the estimated case recovery ratio increases slightly (see Fig 10) , while the 273 case fatality ratio (in the total population) seems to be stabilized at a rate of \u223c 0.15%. 274 In Figs 11,12,13, we show the coefficients of determination (R 2 ) and the root of 275 mean squared errors (RM SE), forR 0 ,\u03b2 and\u03b3, respectively.\n\nThe computed values of the \"effective\" per day mortality and recovery rates of the 277 SIRD model were \u03b3 \u223c 0.0005 and \u03b2 \u223c 0.16 d \u22121 (corresponding to a recovery period of 278 \u223c 6 d). Note that because of the extremely small number of the data used the infection run, we used the SIRD simulations with \u03b2 = 0.16d \u22121 , and \u03b3 = 0.0005 and as 288 initial conditions one infected, zero recovered, zero deaths on November 16th 2019, and 289 run until the 10th of February.\n\nThe optimal, with respect to the reported confirmed cases from the 11th of January 291 to the 10th of February value of the infected rate (\u03b1) was found to be \u223c 0.319(90% CI: 292 0.318-0.32). This corresponds to a mean value of the basic reproduction numberR 0 \u2248 2. 293 Finally, using the derived values of the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, we have run the SIRD author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186 doi: medRxiv preprint and \u223c100,000. This finding suggests an even lower value of the per day mortality rate 307 in the total population, than the one computed. 308 Importantly, under this scenario, the simulations shown in Fig ?? suggest a decline 309 of the outbreak at the end of February. Table 1 summarizes the above results for both 310 scenarios. 311 We note, that the results derived under Scenario II seem to predict a slow down of 312 the outbreak in Hubei after the end of February. However, we should also point out the high uncertainty in the three-weeks ahead 328 predictions as reflected by the big deviation between the lower and upper bounds of the 329 simulations at the end of the forecasting period. At this point we should note that our 330 SIRD modelling approach did not take into account many factors that play an 331 important role in the dynamics of the disease such as the effect of the incubation period 332 in the transmission dynamics, the heterogeneous contact transmission network, the 333 effect of the measures already taken to combat the epidemic, the characteristics of the 334 population (e.g. the effect of the age, people who had already health problems). Also 335 the estimation of the model parameters is based on an assumption, considering just the 336 first period in which the first cases were confirmed and reported. Of note, COVID-19, 337 which is thought to be principally transmitted from person to person by respiratory 338 droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of the fecal-oral route [21] had 339 been spreading for at least over a month and a half before the imposed lockdown and 340 quarantine of Wuhan on January 23, having thus infected unknown numbers of people. 341 The number of asymptomatic and mild cases with subclinical manifestations that 342 probably did not present to hospitals for treatment may be substantial; these cases, 343 which possibly represent the bulk of the COVID-19 infections, remain unrecognized, 344 especially during the influenza season [22] . This highly likely gross under-detection and 345 underreporting of mild or asymptomatic cases inevitably throws severe disease courses 346 calculations and death rates out of context, distorting epidemiologic reality. Another 347 important factor that should be taken into consideration pertains to the diagnostic 348 criteria used to determine infection status and confirm cases. A positive PCR test was 349 required to be considered a confirmed case by China's Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia 350 Diagnosis and Treatment program in the early phase of the outbreak [14] . However, the 351 sensitivity of nucleic acid testing for this novel viral pathogen may only be 30-50%, 352 thereby often resulting in false negatives, particularly early in the course of illness. To 353 complicate matters further, the guidance changed in the recently-released fourth edition 354 of the program on February 6 to allow for diagnosis based on clinical presentation, but 355 only in Hubei province [14] .

Supportive care with extracorporeal 358 membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in intensive care units (ICUs) is critical for severe 359 respiratory disease. Large-scale capacities for such level of medical care in Hubei 360 province, or elsewhere in the world for that matter, amidst this public health emergency 361 may prove particularly challenging. We hope that the results of our analysis contribute 362 to the elucidation of critical aspects of this outbreak so as to contain the novel 363 coronavirus as soon as possible and mitigate its effects regionally, in mainland China, 364 and internationally.\n\nIn the digital and globalized world of today, new data and information on the novel 367 coronavirus and the evolution of the outbreak become available at an unprecedented 368 pace. Still, crucial questions remain unanswered and accurate answers for predicting the 369 dynamics of the outbreak simply cannot be obtained at this stage. We emphatically 370 underline the uncertainty of available official data, particularly pertaining to the true 371 baseline number of infected (cases), that may lead to ambiguous results and inaccurate 372 forecasts by orders of magnitude, as also pointed out by other investigators [1, 17, 22] .\n\nWe did not receive any specific funding for this study. 14 ,000 900 -100,000 Table 1 .
