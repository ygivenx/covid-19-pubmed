S2 mediates membrane fusion by undergoing dramatic conformational changes [44, 50, 59, 60] . Prior to membrane fusion, the S protein presents as a native trimeric structure on the viral surface. During the membrane fusion process, S2 dissociates from S1, and the two heptad repeat regions in S2, designated HR1 and HR2, form a 6-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion core, exposing a hydrophobic fusion peptide inserted into the host membrane and bringing the viral and host membranes into proximity for fusion (Figure 3(a) ). Understanding of this fusion core structure will guide rational design of MERS-CoV fusion inhibitors and anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics specifically targeting S2.\n\n-based fusion core structure-The fusion core structure of MERS-CoV is similar to that of SARS-CoV, but it is distinct from that of the other coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and HCoV-NL63 [59, [62] [63] [64] . X-ray crystallography has identified a stable 6-HB fusion core structure [59] , which contains a parallel trimeric coiled coil of three longer HR1 helices and three shorter HR2 chains surrounding it in an oblique antiparallel manner [50, 59] . The 6-HB helices of MERS-CoV are formed by residues 987-1,062 in the HR1 region and residues 1,263-1,279 in the HR2 region, respectively. In addition, residues 1,283-1,285 in the S2 form a one-turn 3 10 helix at the C-terminus of HR1-L6-HR2 fusion protein. The interaction between HR1 and HR2 helices is predominantly hydrophobic, consisting of a number of hydrogen bonds formed through key residues and mainly located around the N-and C-terminal regions of the HR2 helices [59] .\n\nBased on the crystal structure of the 6-HB of MERS-CoV, two peptides, designated HR1P and HR2P, which span residues 998-1,039 in HR1 and residues 1,251-1,286 in HR2 domains, respectively, were designed to investigate the interaction between HR1 and HR2 in the 6-HB and determine its stability. Results showed that HR1P interacted with HR2P to form a 6-HB and that HR1P/HR2P mixture at equimolar concentration constituted a helical complex with strong thermal stability [59] .\n\nS protein needs to be activated for entry into target cells. Such activation can be directed by one or more of the following proteases: TMPRSS2, endosomal cathepsins (B/L), and proprotein convertases, depending on the host cell type and tissues [65] [66] [67] . For example, both TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L may activate MERS-CoV S protein for viral entry in naturally susceptible cells, such as Caco-2 [65] . In addition, using bioinformatics and peptide cleavage assays, two cleavage sites were identified for furin protease at the S1/S2 boundary and within S2, respectively [68] . It is indicated that MERS-CoV S protein was proteolyzed by furin during protein biosynthesis for the S1/S2 cleavage site, and virus entry for the S2 cleavage site, respectively. This two-step furin-mediated protease cleavage of S protein suggests the importance of furin activation in MERS-CoV fusion and infection.\n\nThe structure and function of MERS-CoV S protein determine the key role of this protein as an important target to develop therapeutics against MERS. Specific targets in the S protein include N-terminal domain (NTD), RBD and other regions in S1 subunit, and HR1 and HR2 in S2 subunit, as well as other targets related to the function of MERS-CoV S protein. The therapeutic agents currently developed based on these targets are characterized as anti-MERS-CoV neutralizing mAbs, anti-DPP4 mAbs, DPP4 antagonists, peptidic fusion inhibitors, protease inhibitors, siRNA, and other molecules. The anti-MERS-CoV agents mainly block receptor binding or membrane fusion, thus leading to the inhibition of MERS-CoV infection. None of the anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents are approved for human use. The S proteintargeting anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents, including neutralizing mAbs and peptides, are summarized in Tables 1-2. 3.1. MERS-CoV S1-NTD or S1 outside RBD as therapeutic target MERS-CoV S1-NTD and S1 outside the RBD may serve as potential targets to develop therapeutic countermeasures against MERS-CoV infection. A few neutralizing mAbs are identified to target these regions [69, 72] . For example, a mouse mAb G2 that recognizes neutralizing epitopes in S1 outside the RBD may neutralize pseudotyped MERS-CoV infection [69] . In addition, human mAb LCA60, which recognizes a neutralizing epitope at residue V33 of S1-NTD, can also neutralize infection of pseudotyped MERS-CoV [72] . The neutralizing mAbs specific for S1-NTD or S1 outside the RBD could be used to supplement RBD-specific mAbs to increase their anti-MERS-CoV activity.\n\nThe RBD is a major target for anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics. Most MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies target the RBD, and RBD-specific mAbs have more potent neutralizing activity than those targeting the S1 region outside RBD or the S2 region ( Table 1 ), suggesting that MERS-CoV RBD could be served as a main neutralizing target for developing antibodybased therapeutics.\n\nRBD-targeting mouse neutralizing mAbs-Several mousederived, RBD-targeting MERS-CoV neutralizing mAbs have been generated from hybridomas of mice immunized with MERS-CoV S-encoding DNA and S1 or RBD proteins, and most of them maintain MERS-CoV neutralizing ability by blocking RBD-DPP4 receptor binding [69] [70] [71] . These mouse neutralizing antibodies may inhibit DPP4 binding at, or near, the key RBD residues D510, R511, W535, E536, D539, Y540, R542, and W553 (Figure 4(a) , Table 1 ), and potently neutralize infection of divergent pseudotyped or live MERS-CoV [69, 71] .\n\nIt is shown that Mersmab1, a conformation-dependent neutralizing mAb, efficiently blocked MERS-CoV RBD binding to its receptor DPP4 in soluble and cell-associated forms, and that the binding epitopes were critical at residues D510, R511, and W553 of RBD. Mersmab1 also inhibited S-mediated pseudotyped MERS-CoV entry into hDPP4-expressing cells and potently neutralized pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV infection [70] . It is also revealed that mouse mAbs 4C2 and 2E6, which neutralized MERS-CoV infection with high efficiency, interfered with RBD/DPP4 interactions by competing with each other for RBD binding [71] . In addition to their competitive effects, mouse mAbs capable of recognizing various RBD neutralizing epitopes may have synergistic effects on neutralizing MERS-CoV infection. For example, F11 and D12 mAbs, which recognize neutralizing epitopes at, or near, residues 509, or W535 and E536, respectively, the opposite sides of RBD, have different profiles in neutralizing a panel of eight pseudotyped MERS-CoVs-bearing S protein. While F11 was unable to neutralize pseudotyped MERS-CoV expressing S protein of Bisha1 or England1 strain containing D509G mutation, D12 could neutralize both pseudotyped MERS-CoVs irrespective of the mutation [69] . Nevertheless, the protective and therapeutic abilities of such mouse neutralizing mAbs, if not humanized, have not been evaluated in appropriate animal models.\n\nNotably, crystal structures of two mouse neutralizing mAbs, 4C2 and D12, and MERS-CoV RBD-binding complexes are available, in which neutralizing epitopes are identified in the RBD that are critical for mAb binding [69, 71] (Figure 4 (a), Table 1 ). The characterized RBD-mAb crystal structures and the identified neutralizing epitopes will provide useful guidance for humanizing MERS-CoV mAbs, based on which to develop effective mAbbased anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents.\n\nneutralizing mAbs targeting MERS-CoV RBD have been extensively studied. These mAbs can be generated using screening of B cells derived from convalescent patients, nonimmune human antibody phage display libraries, or humanized mouse mAbs [71] [72] [73] [75] [76] [77] [78] . By competing with MERS-CoV RBD residues for hDPP4 binding, the RBD-targeting human mAbs may efficiently block RBD binding to the DPP4 receptor and subsequent virus entry into target cells, thus inhibiting MERS-CoV infection (Figure 3(b) ). Several key residues critical for mAb binding, including F/L506, D510, T512, W535, E536, D539, Y540, R542, W553, and E565, have been identified in the RBD of MERS-CoV (Figure 4 (b,c), Table 1 ).\n\nLCA60 is the first human neutralizing mAb isolated from a MERS-CoV-infected individual. In addition to binding MERS-CoV S1-NTD, this mAb can also strongly bind RBD at residues T489, K493, E565, and E536, and thus interfered with the binding of RBD to viral cellular receptor DPP4, leading to potent neutralization of infection of three MERS-CoV strains isolated in 2012, including EMC2012, London1/2012, and Jordan-N3/2012 [72] . Likewise, MERS-4 and MERS-27 mAbs inhibited infection of pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV by blocking RBD-DPP4 interaction at the cell surface and preventing S-DPP4mediated syncytia formation [73] . By inhibiting MERS-CoV entry into susceptible cells, REGN3048 and/or REGN3051 mAbs efficiently neutralized infectivity of live MERS-CoV EMC2102 strain and pseudoviruses expressing S protein of different strains with mutations at A431P, S457G, S460 F, A482 V, L506 F, D509G, and V534A, respectively, of the RBD [75] . Similar to mouse neutralizing mAbs, some human neutralizing mAbs, such as MERS-4 and MERS-27, also demonstrate synergistic effects in preventing MERS-CoV infection [73] . In such cases, mAbs can still neutralize naturally occurring or escape mutant MERS-CoVs generated from different antibody epitope groups although they might not neutralize those from the same epitope group [76] .\n\nCrystal structures of mAb-Fab/MERS-CoV RBD complexes are available for two human neutralizing mAbs [61, 74] . Analyses of MERS-27-Fab/RBD complex revealed two critical residues at W535 and D539 positions of RBD that are important for RBD recognition by this mAb and binding with hDPP4 receptor (Figure 4 (b)). By disrupting protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions between RBD and hDPP4, MERS-27 effectively inhibited S-mediated pseudotyped MERS-CoV entry and infection [74] . Interestingly, as noted in the crystal structure of m336-Fab/RBD complex, the epitopes of mAb m336 are mapped to the RBD residues that overlap with the hDPP4-binding site (Figure 4 (c)) [61] , indicating that hDPP4 and m336 recognize identical RBD epitopes, thus explaining the potent neutralizing activity conferred by this human neutralizing mAb.\n\nCurrently, several RBD-specific human neutralizing mAbs have been evaluated for therapeutic effects in MERS-CoV-infected animal models, including Ad5/hDPP4transduced mice, humanized DPP4 (HuDPP4) mice, and hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice, as well as rabbits and rhesus monkeys, demonstrating their protective ability against MERS-CoV infection [71, 72, 75, 77, [79] [80] [81] . For example, LCA60 mAb can prophylactically and therapeutically protect Ad5/hDPP4-transduced mice from infection of two MERS-CoV strains, EMC2012 and London1. It also protected INF-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor-deficient (IFNARKO) mice from challenge by these viruses [72] . In addition, REGN3048 and REGN3051 mAbs blocked MERS-CoV infection and disease in HuDPP4 mice, protecting them against virus challenge [75] . Furthermore, it is recently shown that m336 mAb reduced viral RNAs in rabbits infected with MERS-CoV post-treatment and protected hDPP4-Tg mice before and after MERS-CoV infection [79, 80] , and that 3B11-N mAb reduced lung pathology in rhesus monkeys infected with MERS-CoV before treatment [77] .\n\nDPP4 is an identified receptor for MERS-CoV. DPP4-targeting therapeutic agents, including antibodies specific to DPP4 and DPP4 antagonist, can block the binding or interaction between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4, and thus inhibit MERS-CoV infection ( Table 2) . Utilizing the aforementioned mechanisms, anti-DPP4 (CD26) antibodies 2F9,1F7, and YS110 prevent MERS-CoV entry into susceptible cells, significantly blocking virus infection. The epitopes of these anti-DPP4 mAbs appear to be mapped to residue 358 or covering a region at residues 248-358 of S1 [82] . In addition, DPP4-binding protein adenosine deaminase (ADA) competes with MERS-CoV RBD binding to DPP4, especially at crucial residues Q286 and L294, determining its role as a naturally occurring antagonist of MERS-CoV infection [83] . These identified anti-MERS-CoV agents can be utilized as alternatives to neutralizing mAbs in preventing MERS-CoV infection.\n\nLike SARS-CoV, the HR1 domain in S2 subunit of MERS-CoV S protein is an important target for developing fusion inhibitors against MERS-CoV (Table 2) [50, 59, 60, 88] . As noted, peptides derived from the S2 subunit HR2 domain exhibited good anti-MERS-CoV activity, while those from the HR1 had low, to no, inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infection, possibly because that the HR1 peptides cannot form a soluble and stable trimer, but have tendency to aggregate in the physiological solution or PBS [50, 59, 60, 88] . Indeed, it is indicated that HR2-derived peptide HR2P potently inhibited MERS-CoV replication and S-mediated cell-cell fusion at 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of ~0.6 and 0.8 \u03bcM, respectively, while HR1-derived peptides, including HR1P, HR1L, and HR1M, had no inhibitory activity at all, even at high concentrations [59] .\n\nFurther studies have demonstrated that antiviral activity of HR2-derived peptides correlates with the peptide length, in which longer sequences have better antiviral activity than those with shorter sequences. This may be due to the fact that longer HR2 peptides tend to form more stable 6-HB coiled-coil structure with HR1 peptides [59] . For example, the 36-mer HR2P and 45-mer HR2L peptides maintained strong inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion at IC 50 of 0.8 and 0.5 \u03bcM, respectively, while a 19-mer HR2S short peptide exhibited no anti-MERS-CoV activity [59] .\n\nPrevious studies on HIV-1 have indicated that the stability, solubility, and antiviral activity of anti-HIV peptides can be improved by introducing charged residues to peptide C34 of the gp41 HR2 [89] . Similarly, site-mutating residues, including those forming intramolecular salt-bridges, were introduced into the HR2P peptides without blocking interactions between the HR1 and HR2 of MERS-CoV S2. It is shown that introduction of: (1) T1263E and L1267R mutations to HR2P-M1 peptide, and (2) T1263E, L1267K, S1268K, Q1270E, Q1271E, A1275K, and N1277E mutations to HR2P-M2 peptide significantly increased the peptides' stability and water solubility (69-fold for HR2P-M1 and 1,786-fold for HR2P-M2) and enhanced their inhibitory activity on MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion (9% for HR2P-M1 and 41% for HR2P-M2) [59] . In particular, the HR2P-M2 peptide interacted with the HR1 peptide to form a stable \u03b1-helical complex, blocking 6-HB formation between the HR1 and HR2 of MERS-CoV S2 and subsequent membrane fusion (Figure 3(b) ), thus potently inhibiting infection of S protein-expressing pseudotyped MERS-CoV with or without mutation at residue Q1020 of HR1 [59] . These studies confirm the possibility to further improve the stability, solubility, and antiviral potency of the HR2 peptide HR2P-M2.\n\nThe in vivo protective efficacy of MERS-CoV HR1-targeting peptide was evaluated in Ad5/ hDPP4-transduced mice [90] and hDPP4-Tg mice [91] . Intranasal (i.n.) administration of HR2P-M2 peptide before viral challenge effectively protected the challenged mice from infection of MERS-CoV with or without HR1-Q1020 mutation, as evidenced by the reduced viral loads in lung tissues [84] , and the decreased mortality of mice challenged with lethal dose of MERS-CoV [85, 91] . Protection could be enhanced by combining this peptide with interferon \u03b2, a cytokine that potently inhibits MERS-CoV infection and virus clearance, both before and after virus challenge [84] . These studies suggest that the HR2P-M2 peptide in a nasal spray formulation could be applied to protect high-risk populations, such as family members of MERS patients, healthcare workers, and others having close contact with MERS patients, or in combination with other antiviral agents for treatment of MERS patients [92, 93] .\n\nAs discussed above, the S protein of MERS-CoV must be cleaved by some cellular proteases (e.g. TMPRSS2) into S1 and S2 subunits with the functions to bind the receptor and mediate membrane fusion, respectively [65, 66] . Therefore, the related cellular proteases can serve as targets for developing inhibitors of S protein-mediated viral fusion and entry into the target cells (Table 2 ). Since endosomal cathepsins (B/L) and transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 can activate MERS-CoV S-mediated virus-cell entry and uptake, treatment of cells with cathepsin (B/L) inhibitors, such as MDL28170 and teicoplanin, or TMPRSS2 inhibitor camostat mesylate can block MERS-CoV entry into target cells [65, 66, 86] . It is demonstrated that furin, a ubiquitously expressed protease, plays a key role in proteaseactivated MERS-CoV S-based fusion. Thus, treatment of MERS-CoV-permissive or DPP4expressing cells with furin inhibitor (dec-RVKR-CMK) inhibits MERS-CoV S-mediated entry and virus infection in a dose-dependent manner [68] . Moreover, siRNA silencing of furin activity decreases MERS-CoV S-mediated entry. Accordingly, blockage of furin cleavage at the S cleavage sites significantly reduces virus infection. Different from the proteases processing S protein at the stage of virus uptake, proprotein convertases utilize S protein as a substrate and their processing is dispensable for the activation of S protein. Therefore, blockade of this protease does not affect S protein-driven cell-cell and virus-cell fusion and MERS-CoV infectivity, although it can reduce the processing of S protein in infected cells. It is therefore advisable that host cell protease-targeting anti-MERS-CoV agents should be focused on enzymes processing S protein in the virus uptake stage [94] .\n\nOther regions of MERS-CoV S protein, if identified, can serve as supplemental targets of anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics. For instance, mouse mAb G4 is demonstrated to bind MERS-CoV S2 subunit, neutralizing infection of pseudotyped MERS-CoV bearing S protein with low neutralizing activity (Table 1 ) [69] , but its specific epitopes have not been clearly defined. Studies have also found that interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) may inhibit entry of S-mediated MERS-CoV into IFITM-transduced 293T cells (Table 2) . However, its inhibition activity to MERS-CoV is less efficient than that observed in other human coronaviruses, such as 229E-CoV and NL63-CoV [87] .\n\nThe continual increase of MERS cases, coupled with the continuous MERS outbreak resulting from zoonotic sources and possible human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV, highlights the importance of developing effective antiviral agents to control MERS. As noted above, the structure and function of MERS-CoV S protein in virus entry and virus-cell membrane fusion effectively determine the crucial role of S protein as an important therapeutic target. Indeed, a variety of neutralizing mAbs and therapeutic agents has already been developed based on the viral S protein, and most of them have demonstrated protective efficacy against MERS-CoV infection, although none is currently approved for application in humans. The summary of available preclinical therapeutics will guide further development of effective anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents for human use.\n\nMERS-CoV S protein is a key target for developing therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection. Since the emergence of MERS, a number of S-targeting anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents, including mouse and human neutralizing mAbs and anti-MERS-CoV peptides, have been identified with in vitro efficacy in cell culture and/or in vivo efficacy in animal models, providing feasibility for further development. In addition, the available crystal structures of mAb/RBD complexes and HR1/HR2 6-HB complex will be applicable to elucidate the mechanisms of action of S-targeting anti-MERS-CoV neutralizing mAbs and peptides, thus being helpful for engineering new neutralizing antibodies and designing novel peptides with improved protective efficacy against MERS-CoV infection.\n\nNotwithstanding the high potency of mouse neutralizing mAbs in in vitro testing, they, if not humanized, will not be appropriate for direct use in humans due to the potential risks of human-anti mouse antibody responses and other side effects [95] . Nevertheless, the neutralizing epitopes identified from mouse neutralizing mAbs will guide the design of humanized MERS-CoV mAbs and development of effective antiviral therapeutics and vaccines against MERS-CoV. Remarkably, human neutralizing mAbs have shown efficacy to protect against MERS-CoV infection in several animal models, demonstrating high potential for further development as effective prophylactic and therapeutic agents for human use. Since intravenous (i.v.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of MERS-CoV S-RBD-targeting humanized and human neutralizing mAbs conferred complete protection of animals from MERS-CoV infection without causing side effects and pathology [80, 81] , it is thus suggested that these routes can be selected to deliver anti-MERS-CoV-S mAbs to MERS-CoV-infected patients. Compared with human neutralizing mAbs targeting other regions of MERS-CoV S protein, those targeting the RBD are more potent, and could recognize key residues that are responsible for DPP4 binding. It should be noted that change of one or several of these critical residues in RBD may lead to the generation of escape mutant virus strains, in which neutralizing mAbs targeting the original residues in RBD will reduce or lose neutralizing activity against the new strains. This phenomenon has further elucidated the need for combinational application of two or more potent human neutralizing mAbs that target different neutralizing epitopes in RBD or other functional regions in MERS-CoV S protein, or have different mechanisms of action, in order to improve their antiviral activity against divergent virus strains, including those escape mutant strains. Attention should also be paid to other challenges of developing therapeutic mAbs, such as poor tissue penetration (resulting from large molecular size), high production cost, and inadequate pharmacokinetics [96] [97] [98] . These challenges will make it necessary to use antibody engineering technologies to generate MERS-CoV S-targeting antibody fragments with smaller molecule weight, reduced production cost, and good tissue penetration, but maintaining sufficient protective efficacy.\n\nSimilar to anti-HIV peptides [89] , the stability, solubility, and antiviral activity of MERS-CoV S-specific peptides can be improved by introducing intramolecular salt-bridges or increasing peptide length. Therefore, further optimization of the HR2-derived peptides is expected to produce next-generation anti-MERS-CoV peptides with improved inhibitory efficacy. As an alternative and promising approach, combining the HRI-targeting peptide inhibitors with the RBD-specific neutralizing mAbs may result in synergistic antiviral effect against divergent MERS-CoV strains, including those resistant to S-targeting neutralizing mAbs and peptides.\n\nIn view of the key role of MERS-CoV S protein in virus infection and the ability of this protein to serve as an important target, it is expected that more effective and safer MERS- Van \n\n\u2022 MERS-CoV binds dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) via receptor-binding domain (RBD) in spike (S) protein S1 subunit and then mediates virus entry into target cells via S2 subunit. Therefore, S protein plays pivotal roles in MERS-CoV infection and serves as an important therapeutic target.\n\n\u2022 Specific therapeutic targets in S protein include N-terminal domain and RBD in S1, and heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and 2 (HR2) in S2. S1-RBD and S2-HR1 are major targets for developing anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and peptidic fusion inhibitors, respectively.\n\n\u2022 RBD-targeting neutralizing mAbs block receptor binding at key residues, leading to inhibition of MERS-CoV infection. Several RBD-specific human neutralizing mAbs have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against MERS-CoV infection in Ad5/hDPP4 transduced, humanized DPP4 (HuDPP4), or hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice, rabbits, and rhesus monkeys.\n\n\u2022 HR2-derived, HR1-targeting peptides inhibit MERS-CoV infection by blocking HR1/HR2 to form 6-helix bundle structure, and prevent MERS-CoV challenge in Ad5/hDPP4-transduced or hDPP4-Tg mice.\n\n\u2022 There is a need to combine mAbs recognizing different neutralizing epitopes to improve their efficacy against escape mutant MERS-CoV strains, and engineer them with reduced cost and good tissue penetration. It is feasible to optimize HR1-targeting peptides with improved inhibitory efficacy, and combine them with neutralizing mAbs to enhance anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic efficacy.\n\nThis box summarizes key points contained in the article. Schematic diagrams of MERS-CoV S protein S2-mediated membrane fusion and MERS-CoV S-targeting mAbs and peptides [59, 61] . (a) Schematic diagram of MERS-CoV S2mediated membrane fusion. The following major processes are involved in MERS-CoV membrane fusion. In receptor binding stage, S protein, which exists as a trimer, binds to the cellular receptor DPP4 via S1-RBD. This binding triggers conformational changes of S protein, leading to dissociation of S1 from S2 with exposed HR1-trimer and HR2-trimer, thus entering intermediate (pre-hairpin) stage. In fusion (hairpin) stage, HR1 and HR2 helices associate with each other to form a 6-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion core, and bring the membranes of virus and cell into close proximity for fusion. (b) Schematic diagram of mechanism of action of MERS-CoV S1-RBD-targeting neutralizing mAbs and S2-HR1targeting peptides. The RBD-specific antibody (IgG or Fab) binds to viral S1-RBD and interrupts the binding between RBD and DPP4, thus blocking virus infection. HR1-targeting HR2 peptide (e.g. HR2P) binds to the HR1-trimer to form a heterologous 6-HB, thus interferes with subsequent 6-HB fusion core formation and virus-cell membrane fusion, resulting in the inhibition of MERS-CoV infection.
