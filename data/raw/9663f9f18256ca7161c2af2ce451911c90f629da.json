The setting up of the dot blot immunoassays for human and mouse samples. Western blot analysis of human PBMC (A), mouse PBMC (B) and spinal cord (C) lysates were done using primary antibodies for PPIA, HSP90, GRP78, ERp57, DJ-1 and TDP-43 as reported in the Material and Method section. All Western blots showed a major single band at the expected molecular weight indicating that the antibodies were specific and could be used in the dot blot assay. For human PBMC the internal standard, which is a pool of all samples in the analysis (healthy controls and patients), was analyzed. Asterisks indicate fragmented TDP-43.\n\nSupplementary Figure 2 . Validation of candidate phenotypic biomarkers in PBMC of early and late ALS patients. (A-F) PPIA, HSP90, GRP78, ERp57, DJ-1, HSC70 were analyzed by dot blot immunoassays in PBMC samples from an independent set of ALS patients (n=85), n=38 EA and n=47 LA, and matched controls (n=83), n=35 EC and n=48 LC. Immunoreactivity was normalized to protein loading, as assessed by Ponceau Red staining (Relative immunoreactivity, RI). We found that PPIA, HSP90, GRP78 were significantly lower in early ALS than in matched controls (A-C) and that HSC70 was higher in late ALS compared to matched controls (F). *, p < 0.05, by Student's t test."}
