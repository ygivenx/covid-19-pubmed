{"title": "ERKs and mitochondria-related pathways are essential for glycyrrhizic\nacid-mediated neuroprotection against glutamate-induced toxicity in differentiated\nPC12 cells", "body": "The excitatory amino acid glutamate serves as a fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the\ncentral nervous system (1), and excitotoxicity\nand oxidative toxicity are considered to be two major pathways responsible for\nglutamate-induced toxicity (2,3). Excessive release of glutamate leading to\nexcitotoxicity is responsible for neuronal injury associated with many acute and chronic\nbrain diseases, such as brain ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative\ndisorders (4,5).\n\nGlycyrrhiza Radix, a crude Chinese traditional drug derived from Glycyrrhiza\nuralensis, G. glabra and G. inflata,\nexhibits various pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory (6), anti-obesity (7), anti-virus (8), and anti-oxidative\n(9) effects. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), a major\ncomponent of Glycyrrhiza Radix, possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects\n(10,11). Its structure is shown in Figure 1A.\nA previous study demonstrated that GA exerts a neuroprotective effect against\n6-hydroxydopamine-induced PC12 cell death via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase\n(PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway (12). The\nprotective effect of GA was also confirmed in rat primary neurons and hippocampal slices\n(13). However, the protective effects of GA\nagainst glutamate-induced differentiated PC12 (DPC12) cell damage and the underlying\nmechanisms have not been described.\n\nSeveral signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of glutamate-induced\nneurotoxicity (14,15). Alteration of mitochondrial function is one of the factors responsible\nfor cell damage (16). Bax and B-cell lymphoma 2\n(Bcl-2), located in mitochondria, are believed to be central regulators of mitochondrial\nfunction (17). Additionally, activation of both\nAKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) is considered to contribute to\ncell proliferation and apoptosis (18,19). Previous studies demonstrated that inhibition\nof phosphorylation of both AKT and ERKs is involved in glutamate-induced cell damage\n(20,21).\n\nOur study aimed to examine the effect of GA on attenuating glutamate cytotoxicity and\nits underlying mechanisms in DPC12 cells. Our results showed that GA improved cell\nviability and restored mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation. GA also normalized\nthe expression of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3,\nand cytochrome C (Cyto C). Furthermore, GA pretreatment remarkably enhanced\nphosphorylation of ERKs but not AKT. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that ERKs\nand mitochondria-related pathways are essential for GA-mediated neuroprotection against\nglutamate-induced toxicity in DPC12 cells. This study provides evidence that supports\nthe use of GA as a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nPC12 cells (CRL-1721, passages <10; obtained from ATCC) were grown in monolayers\nin collagen I-coated flasks with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, USA)\nsupplemented with 10% horse serum (HS, Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS,\nInvitrogen), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/mL, Invitrogen), under a\nhumidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37\u00b0C. The culture\nmedium was changed every 3 days. PC12 cells were differentiated with 20 ng/mL nerve\ngrowth factor for 48 h, which was added to the culture medium containing 1% FBS and\n1% HS. Cells were ready for treatment when they reached 80% confluence.\n\nCell viability was measured by a quantitative colorimetric assay with\n3-(4,5-cimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich,\nUSA) as reported previously (22). Briefly,\nPC12 cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at 1\u00d7104 cells/well. After\ndifferentiation, cells were pretreated with 6.25-12.5 \u00b5M GA for 3 h and exposed to 20\nmM glutamate for 24 h. In separate experiments, cells were pretreated with 10 \u00b5M\nLY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) or 10 \u00b5M PD98059 [a mitogen-activated protein/extracellular\nsignal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor] for 30 min, followed by treatment\nwith 6.25-12.5 \u00b5M GA for 3 h and exposure to 20 mM glutamate for 24 h. Treated cells\nwere incubated with MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C in the dark. One hundred\nmicroliters of dimethyl sulfoxide were used to dissolve crystals. Absorbance was\nmeasured spectrophotometrically using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA) at 540 nm.\nThe viability of treated cells are reported as a percentage of that from\ncorresponding control cells.\n\n5,5\u2032,6,6\u2032-Tetrachloro-1,1\u2032,3,3\u2032 tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1,\nSigma-Aldrich) staining was used to measure MMP changes. PC12 cells were seeded onto\nsix-well plates at 1\u00d7105 cells/well. After differentiation, cells were\npretreated with 6.25 or 12.5 \u00b5M GA for 3 h and cotreated with glutamate for another\n12 h. Next, cells were incubated with 2 \u00b5M JC-1 at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. After three\nwashes with phosphate-buffered saline, fluorescent color in each group was examined\nusing a fluorescence microscope (20\u00d7; Axio Observer Z1, CCD camera; Carl Zeiss,\nGermany). Red fluorescence indicated healthy cells with high MMP, whereas green\nfluorescence indicated apoptotic or unhealthy cells with low MMP. The average ratio\nof the red (590 nm) to green (540 nm) fluorescence intensity of each cell in the\ndifferent groups was calculated using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of\nHealth, USA). A total of 50 cells were calculated in each group. The values of\ntreated cells are reported as a percentage of that from corresponding control\ncells.\n\nTreated cells were lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Sigma-Aldrich,\nUSA) containing 1% protease inhibitor cocktail and 2% phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride.\nDetection of Cyto C release from mitochondria to cytoplasm was performed using\ncytoplasmic extracts prepared as described previously (23). The supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations\nwere determined by the Bradford method. Proteins were separated using 12% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred\nelectrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio Basic, USA). The transferred\nmembranes were then blotted with antibodies as follows: phospho-ERKs (P-ERKs),\ntotal-ERKs (T-ERKs), phosphor-AKT (P-AKT), total-AKT (T-AKT), Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved\ncaspase 3, Cyto C, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (all 1:1,000; Cell\nSignaling, USA) at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by treatment with horseradish\nperoxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA). The\nsignals were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence detection kits (GE Healthcare,\nUK). The intensities of the bands were quantified with scanning densitometry using\nthe Quantity One 4.5.0 software (Bio-Rad).\n\nOne-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc multiple\ncomparisons (Dunn's test) were performed to detect statistically significant\ndifferences (P<0.05). Data are reported as means\u00b1SD.\n\nGA alone did not affect DPC12 cell proliferation. Exposure to 20 mM glutamate for 24\nh resulted in decreased viability of 77.3\u00b10.6%; however, pretreatment with 6.25 and\n12.5 \u03bcM GA significantly prevented the loss of cell viability, enhancing viability to\n93.4\u00b10.9% (P<0.001) and 85.3\u00b11.9% (P<0.05), respectively (Figure 1B).\n\nJC-1 staining was used to examine MMP changes in treated cells. GA strongly restored\nglutamate-induced MMP dissipation, as demonstrated by an increment in red\nfluorescence emission compared with glutamate-treated cells (Figure 2). As shown in the quantification data, compared to the\ncontrol group, only 21.2\u00b18.7% (P<0.001) MMP was observed in glutamate-treated\ncells. Conversely, 6.25 and 12.5 \u03bcM GA pretreatment significantly restored MMP to\n69.9\u00b112.9% (P<0.01) and 36.1\u00b16.9% (P<0.05), respectively (Figure 2).\n\nCompared to control cells, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3, and Cyto C (cytoplasm)\nexpression levels were 75.9\u00b14.3% (P<0.05), 124.3\u00b18.8% (P<0.05), 155.5\u00b110.6%\n(P<0.01), and 119.8\u00b13.2% (P<0.05) in cells exposed to 20 mM glutamate for 24 h\n(Figure 3). GA pretreatment (6.25 or 12.5\n\u00b5M) strongly restored glutamate-reduced Bcl-2 levels to 102.3\u00b112.7 or 95.1\u00b110.9%\n(P<0.05), normalized glutamate-increased Bax expression to 78.7\u00b14.4 or 80.3\u00b16.4%\n(P<0.01), inhibited caspase 3 activity to 119.4\u00b110.1% or 112.3\u00b110.9% (P<0.05),\nand suppressed Cyto C release to 102.2\u00b17.9 or 98.9\u00b16.8% (P<0.05), respectively\n(Figure 3).\n\nGlutamate significantly suppressed P-ERK levels from 30 to 360 min (from 71.1\u00b111.3 to\n85.7\u00b18.2%; P<0.05) but did not affect T-ERK levels. Conversely, GA alone increased\nP-ERK expression at 180 and 360 min (132.2\u00b17.2 and 132.3\u00b112.2%, respectively;\nP<0.05; Figure 4A). GA pretreatment (6.25\n\u00b5M) reversed the decrease in P-ERKs caused by glutamate, with a significant effect\nobserved at 180 and 360 min (116.2\u00b14.1 and 121.3\u00b13.5%, respectively; P<0.05; Figure 4A). Further results showed that after\npretreatment with 10 \u00b5M PD98059 for 30 min followed by a 3-h treatment of GA and\nexposure to glutamate for another 24 h, the neuroprotective effect of 6.25 \u00b5M GA on\ncell viability was significantly abrogated (80.7\u00b14.5 vs 71.7\u00b15.7%;\nP<0.05; Figure 4C). Collectively our results\nindicate that ERK activation was involved in GA-mediated neuroprotection in DPC12\ncells.\n\nGlutamate time-dependently reduced P-AKT levels from 30 to 360 min (12.1\u00b12.2% to\n19.6\u00b18.9% reduced, respectively; P<0.05). However, neither GA alone nor\ncotreatment with glutamate showed any effect on P-AKT levels (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the effect GA on cell viability was not\naltered by a 30-min pretreatment with 10 \u00b5M LY290002 (a specific PI3K inhibitor)\n(Figure 4D). These data indicate that the\nAKT pathway is not involved in this neuroprotective effect.\n\nAs a major compound of Glycyrrhiza Radix, GA has been studied for years. GA is\nneuroprotective in the post-ischemic brain mainly through anti-excitotoxic and\nanti-oxidative effects (24). GA protects against\n3-morpholinosydnonimine-induced cell damage in lung epithelial cells (25). Recently, it was reported that GA inhibits\nextracellular high-mobility group box 1 cytokine activity and reduces the level of the\ninflammatory response, thus alleviating early brain injury and cerebrovasospasm (26). Our present study revealed that GA improved\ncell viability, restored mitochondrial dysfunction, and normalized expression of Bax,\nBcl-2, cleaved caspase 3, and Cyto C compared with cells exposed to glutamate. GA\nenhanced P-ERK but not P-AKT levels. Further experiments employing MEK and PI3K\ninhibitors demonstrated that the ERK signaling pathway is essential in GA-mediated\nneuroprotection.\n\nERK and AKT activations are major factors related to cell survival (14,15).\nActivated ERKs and stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase-P38 have important roles in\nPC12 survival (27). Another study reported that\nsodium ferulate exerts neuroprotective effects against glutamate-induced apoptosis via\nERK and AKT pathways (21). In the present study,\nboth GA treatment alone and cotreatment with glutamate induced ERK phosphorylation,\nwhereas glutamate downregulated P-ERK levels. However, neither GA treatment alone nor\ncotreatment with glutamate affected AKT activation. The presence of PD98059 but not\nLY294002 partially abrogated the protective effect on cell viability and further\nconfirmed the role of ERKs in GA-mediated neuroprotection against glutamate-induced\ncytotoxicity in DPC12 cells.\n\nOn the other hand, growing experimental evidence indicates that mitochondrial function\nplays a central role in cell apoptosis (28).\nResults revealed that GA restored mitochondrial dysfunction, suppressed expression of\nBax and cleaved caspase 3, enhanced expression of Bcl-2, and inhibited Cyto C release\ncompared to glutamate-treated cells. Bcl-2 family members play crucial roles in\nregulating cell death, and the ratio Bcl-2/Bax is considered a hallmark for determining\nthe relationship between cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction (29). It is believed that when MMP dissipation is observed, release\nof Cyto C from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm is enhanced. Caspases are a family of\ncysteine proteases that play pivotal roles in mediating neuronal apoptosis and\nneurodegeneration (30). As a critical apoptosis\nexecutioner, caspase 3 becomes activated in the cytosol and is translocated into the\nnucleus to cleave its nuclear substrates (31).\nDisruption of MMP unleashes the enzymatic apoptotic machinery of caspases, and of\ncaspase 3 in particular, which executes apoptosis. Thus, it is not surprising that\nmitochondria-related pathways are involved in GA-mediated neuroprotection. Additionally,\nas reported, inhibition of ERK leads to downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression\n(32). However, the relationship between ERK\nactivation and mitochondrial function needs further study.\n\nAlthough doses ranging from 1 to 50 \u00b5M GA were employed in the preliminary experiment,\nprotective effects against glutamate-caused cell damage were only noted at 6.25 and 12.5\n\u00b5M. The data suggested that 6.25 \u00b5M GA had a more potent effect. Interestingly, recent\nresearch reported that GA exerts an apoptotic effect in WEHI-3 mouse leukemia cells\n(33) and against DMH-induced colon\ncarcinogenesis in Wistar rats (34). It appears\nthat GA possesses biphasic properties, that is, GA shows protective activities in\nneurodegenerative diseases and neural injury, whereas it has apoptotic effects in\ncancer. The biphasic properties may also be related to the dosages employed. Detailed\nmechanisms underlying such biphasic effects deserve further study.\n\nIn conclusion, GA protects DPC12 cells against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity mainly\nthrough ERK and mitochondria-related pathways. Our findings provide experimental\nevidence that GA may be a candidate for treating or preventing neurodegenerative\ndiseases."}
