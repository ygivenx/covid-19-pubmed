{"title": "Fundamental principles of epidemic spread highlight the immediate need for large-scale serological surveys to assess the stage of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic", "body": "Here, we calibrate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to data on cumulative reported SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths from the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy under the assumption that such deaths are well reported events that occur only in a vulnerable fraction of the population. We focus on model solutions which take into consideration previous estimates of critical epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), probability of death in the vulnerable fraction of the population, infectious period and time from infection to death, with the intention of exploring the sensitivity of the system to the actual fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease and death.\n\nOur simulations are in agreement with other studies that the current epidemic wave in the UK and Italy in the absence of interventions should have an approximate duration of 2-3 months, with numbers of deaths lagging behind in time relative to overall infections. Importantly, the results we present here suggest the ongoing epidemics in the UK and Italy started at least a month before the first reported death and have already led to the accumulation of significant levels of herd immunity in both countries. There is an inverse relationship between the proportion currently immune and the fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease.\n\nThis relationship can be used to determine how many people will require hospitalisation (and possibly die) in the coming weeks if we are able to accurately determine current levels of herd immunity. There is thus an urgent need for investment in technologies such as virus (or viral pseudotype) neutralization assays and other robust assays which provide reliable read-outs of protective immunity, and for the provision of open access to valuable data sources such as blood banks and paired samples of acute and convalescent sera from confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 to validate these. Urgent development and assessment of such tests should be followed by rapid implementation at scale to provide real-time data. These data will be critical to the proper assessment of the effects of social distancing and other measures currently being adopted to slow down the case incidence and for informing future policy direction.\n\n1 Disclaimer: (a) This material is not final and is subject to be updated any time.

This proportion is itself only a fraction of the risk groups already well described in the literature [1] [2] [3] [4] , including the elderly and those carrying critical comorbidities (e.g. asthma). We used a susceptible-infectious-recovered framework (SIRf) to examine the effects of varying the vulnerable fraction of the population on the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, fixing other model parameters to ranges supported by previous studies (Table 1) . We fit the model to cumulative deaths in the United Kingdom and Italy in the first 15 days following the first recorded death to avoid any potential effects of local control strategies implemented since that time.

The model output (posterior) for time of introduction (the start of transmission) place this event a couple of days after the first confirmed case in the country, and over a month before the first confirmed death ( Figures  1E-F) . In both R 0 scenarios, by the time the first death was reported (05/03/2020), thousands of individuals (~0.08%) would have already been infected with the virus (as also suggested by [5] ). By 19/03/2020, approximately 36% (R 0 =2.25) and 40% (R 0 =2.75) of the population would have already been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Running the same model with R 0 =2.25 and the proportion of the population at risk of severe disease being distributed around 0.1%, places the start of transmission at 4 days prior to first case detection and 38 days before the first confirmed death and suggests that 68% would have been infected by 19/03/2020. The results of the same exercise for Italy ( Figure 2 ) place the time of introduction around 10 days before the first confirmed case, and around a month before the first confirmed death (Figures 2E-F) when the proportion of the population at risk of severe disease is around 1%. By 06/03/2020, approximately 45 days post introduction, the model suggests that approximately 60% (R 0 = 2.25) and 64% (R 0 = 2.75) of the population would have already been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. When the proportion of the population at risk is around 0.1%, the start of transmission is likely to have occurred 17 days prior to first case detection and 38 days before the first confirmed death with 80% already infected by 06/03/2020.\n\nOverall, these results underscore the dependence of the inferred epidemic curve on the assumed fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease ( ) showing significant \u03c1 population level immunity accruing by mid March in the UK as is decreased to plausible \u03c1 values ( Figure 3 ). They also suggest a way of determining this fraction by measuring the proportion of the population already exposed to SARS-CoV-2. \n\nWe model a susceptible-infectious-recovered framework (SIRf) [6] to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The population is separated into those currently contributing to transmission (y, equation 1 ) and those not available for infection (z, equation 2 ). Cumulative death counts ( , equation 3 ) are obtained by considering that mortality occurs with probability , on a \u039b \u03b8 proportion of the population that is at risk of severe disease ( ) among those already \u03c1 exposed (z); we consider the delay between the time of infection and of death ( ) as a \u03c8 combination of incubation period and time to death after onset of symptoms. The small proportion of the population that is at risk of severe disease ( ) is an aggregate model \u03c1 parameter, taking into consideration both a potentially lower risk of infection than the rest of the population, as well as the actual risk of severe disease.\n\n.
