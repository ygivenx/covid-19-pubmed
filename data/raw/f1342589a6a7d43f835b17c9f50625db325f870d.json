{"title": "Article Role of the SEL1L:LC3-I Complex as an ERAD Tuning Receptor in the Mammalian ER", "body": "Most nascent polypeptide chains entering the ER are covalently modified with preassembled oligosaccharides composed of 2 N-acetylglucosamine, 9 mannose and 3 glucose residues (Figure S1A) . Failure to attain the native structure is signaled by the progressive removal of 2 to 4 terminal mannose residues. Dedicated ERAD lectins eventually deliver partially demannosylated, terminally misfolded proteins to dislocons, i.e., sites of protein retrotranslocation across the ER membrane built around membrane-embedded E3 ubiquitin ligases Smith et al., 2011; Vembar and Brodsky, 2008) . In the ''mannose timer model'' of protein quality control (Helenius, 1994) , the ER mannosidase I (ERManI), EDEM proteins, OS-9 and XTP3-B variants use their mannosidase-like (ML) or their mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) domains to generate and/or to recognize the oligosaccharide-based signal on misfolded polypeptides to be channeled into one of the many eukaryotic ERAD pathways (Aebi et al., 2010; Lederkremer, 2009) . Recently, it has been reported that EDEM1, OS-9 and XTP3-B (and their yeast orthologs; Hanna et al. [2012] ) may use their ML or MRH domains to associate with oligosaccharides displayed by the type I membrane protein SEL1L, a component of the dislocation machinery containing the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 (Christianson et al., 2012; Christianson et al., 2008; Cormier et al., 2009; Satoh et al., 2010) . This led to challenge the ''mannose timer model'' of protein quality control and to propose an alternative ''docking model'' of protein quality control in which oligosaccharides may serve as docking sites for EDEM1 and OS-9 at the SEL1L/HRD1 dislocon, rather than as signal tagging misfolded polypeptides for destruction (Aebi et al., 2010; Tamura et al., 2010) . In this work, we have evaluated the consequences and the biological relevance of the oligosaccharide-based association between EDEM1 or OS-9 and SEL1L.\n\nThe ERAD regulators EDEM1 and OS-9 have shorter half-lives compared to conventional ER chaperones and enzymes (Figure S1B) . At steady state, they are selectively released from the ER by a COPII-independent vesicular pathway to be eventually degraded by endosomal/lysosomal proteases (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008; Le Fourn et al., 2009; Reggiori et al., 2010; Zuber et al., 2007) . This is a facet of series of poorly defined events collectively named ERAD tuning that sets steady state ERAD activity at levels that do not compromise protein biogenesis by insuring a constitutive and selective clearance of ERAD factors from the ER (Bernasconi and Molinari, 2011) . The presence of the ubiquitin-like protein LC3-I noncovalently associated at the cytosolic surface, distinguishes the ER-derived, ERAD tuning vesicles containing EDEM1 and OS-9 (named EDEMosomes in Cal\u00ec et al., [2008] and Reggiori et al., [2010] ) from autophagosomes where LC3 is covalently bound to the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine and is therefore named LC3-II (Kabeya et al., 2000) . Conventional ER markers are excluded from ERAD tuning vesicles (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008; Zuber et al., 2007) and from similar EDEM1/OS-9/LC3-Icontaining vesicles co-opted for replication by the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a prototype coronavirus (CoV) Reggiori et al., 2010) . This implies a receptor-mediated selection of EDEM1 and OS-9 in the ER lumen for segregation in these LC3-I + structures (Bernasconi and Molinari, 2011 \n\nHere we identify SEL1L as the elusive ERAD tuning receptor that selectively captures EDEM1 and OS-9 in the ER lumen, thereby insuring their constitutive clearance from the ER at steady state. The proline-rich, cytosolic tail of SEL1L binds LC3-I and is required and sufficient for segregation of the receptor and its cargo into the ERAD tuning vesicles. EDEM1 and OS-9 use their ML and MRH domains to bind misfolded polypeptides or SEL1L oligosaccharides (Christianson et al., 2012; Christianson et al., 2008; Cormier et al., 2009; Hanna et al., 2012; Satoh et al., 2010) . By engaging EDEM1 and OS-9, and by stabilizing SEL1L in the HRD1 dislocon, foldingdefective polypeptides compete with the formation of the ERAD tuning complexes containing EDEM1, OS-9, SEL1L and LC3-I. This inhibits the constitutive removal of EDEM1 and OS-9 from the ER thereby enhancing lumenal ERAD activity in the absence of unfolded protein response (UPR) induction. Consistent with data showing that the ER-derived EDEM1/ OS-9/LC3-I-containing vesicles are co-opted by CoV for replication Reggiori et al., 2010) , we report that the newly identified ERAD tuning receptor component SEL1L also localizes in these vesicles in MHV-infected cells and that silencing of either SEL1L or of LC3 inhibits MHV replication.\n\nEctopically expressed EDEM1 and OS-9 may use their ML or their MRH domains to associate with SEL1L oligosaccharides (Christianson et al., 2008; Cormier et al., 2009; Hanna et al., 2012; Satoh et al., 2010) . We first verified whether these associations also occur between the endogenous proteins and whether the expression of folding-defective or folding-competent polypeptides in the ER lumen affects the intracellular level of EDEM1:SEL1L complexes. To this end, we generated three stable HEK293 lines that do not express any ectopic protein in the ER (Figures 1A and 1B, Mock) , that express the foldingdefective NHK B (a membrane-bound variant of the ERAD substrate NHK) or the folding-competent, membrane-bound (B) Endogenous SEL1L that coprecipitates with endogenous EDEM1 (panel 1, with quantifications) and endogenous EDEM1 in endogenous SEL1L immunoisolates (panel 2, with quantifications). (C) Amplification by RT-PCR of unspliced (u) and spliced (s) Xbp1 transcripts (Mock+Tun, positive control of ER stress). (D) Quantification of 35 S-met/cys incorporation in endogenous EDEM1 immunoisolated from cell lysates. (E) Turnover of endogenous EDEM1 in the stable cell lines. Error bars: standard deviations from the mean of three replicates. secretory protein a1AT B (Figures 1A and 1B , lanes 2 and 3, respectively). The immunoisolation of endogenous EDEM1 from the detergent lysates of Mock cells and the analysis of the immunoprecipitates by western blot confirmed the coimmunoisolation of endogenous SEL1L ( Figure 1B, panel 1, lane 1) . Consistently, the immunoisolation of endogenous SEL1L combined with the characterization of the immunoprecipitates by western blot revealed the presence of endogenous EDEM1 in the immunoprecipitates ( Figure 1B , panel 2, lane 1). This proved the presence of complexes between endogenous EDEM1 and SEL1L at steady state in cultured HEK293 cells. Expression of the folding-defective NHK B ( Figure 1B , panels 1 and 2, lane 2), but not expression of the folding-competent a1AT B (lane 3), substantially reduced the abundance of these complexes (Figure S2A confirms these data with ectopically expressed (r) EDEM1). Interestingly, cells expressing the ERAD substrate, but not cells expressing the folding-competent protein, contained higher levels of SEL1L:HRD1 complexes ( Figure S2B , panel 4), which play a crucial role in NHK disposal . Thus, ER loading with misfolded polypeptides inhibits formation of EDEM1:SEL1L complexes, while favoring SEL1L association with the HRD1-containing dislocon.\n\nExpression of Folding-Defective Polypeptides Enhances the Intracellular Content of EDEM1 and OS-9 in the Absence of UPR Induction The analysis of our cell lines revealed that cells expressing NHK B contain higher levels of EDEM1 ( Figure 1A , panel 3, lane 2) and OS-9 (panel 4, lane 2) than control cells (lane 1) or cells expressing a1AT B (lane 3 and quantifications). The rise in the EDEM1 and OS-9 levels in cells expressing the folding-defective NHK B did not result from UPR induction. In fact, the transcripts for the ER stress-induced spliced version of Xbp1 (sXbp1) were absent in all cell lines ( Figure 1C , lanes 1-3; cell treatment with tunicamycin is shown as a positive control for ER stress, lane 4). Likewise, the intracellular level of the stress-inducible protein GRP94 ( Figure 1A , panel 5 and quantification) and the synthesis of endogenous EDEM1 as determined by a quantitative analysis of [ 35 S]-Met/Cys incorporation in EDEM1 nascent chains remained unaffected upon NHK B expression ( Figure 1D ). Rather, our analysis revealed that the increased level of endogenous EDEM1 in cells expressing NHK B should be ascribed to its slower turnover ( Figure 1E , lanes 4-6) compared to control cells (lanes 1-3) and to cells expressing the a1AT B (lanes 7-9, quantifications). Thus, the lumenal expression of the folding-defective NHK B reduces the amount of EDEM1:SEL1L complexes ( Figures  1B and S2A ) and delays the turnover of endogenous EDEM1 ( Figure 1E ) thereby raising its intracellular content in the absence of UPR induction ( Figures 1A, 1C, and 1D ). Based on these data, we hypothesized that formation of EDEM1:SEL1L complexes might regulate EDEM1 turnover and that SEL1L might be the elusive ERAD tuning receptor insuring the constitutive, vesicular-mediated removal of EDEM1 and OS-9 from the ER lumen (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008; Reggiori et al., 2010) .\n\nElectron microscopy studies revealed that EDEM1 is released from the ER in vesicles lacking a COPII coat (Zuber et al., 2007) . Characterization of these vesicles by immunofluorescence and their separation in isopycnic density gradients showed that they also contain OS-9 and display the ubiquitinlike protein LC3-I noncovalently associated at the surface (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008; Reggiori et al., 2010) . Abundant ER proteins such as CNX, GRP94 and PDI are excluded from the EDEM1containing ERAD tuning vesicles and from the EDEM1-and viral RNA-containing vesicles found in MHV infected cells Reggiori et al., 2010) . This implies the intervention of an ERAD tuning receptor that selects the cargo proteins to be cleared from the ER. A role of SEL1L as ERAD tuning receptor would imply a dual localization of endogenous SEL1L in the ER and in the ERAD tuning vesicles. To assess this, EDEM1-containing vesicles were stabilized by exposing cultured HeLa cells to the lysosomotropic drug chloroquine (CQ), which prevents their fusion with LAMP1-containing degradative organelles (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008; Reggiori et al., 2010) . The immunofluorescence analysis of the cells confirmed the ER localization of SEL1L ( Figure 2A ) (Mueller et al., 2006) and showed that a fraction of endogenous SEL1L was in discrete vesicles lacking conventional ER protein markers (arrowheads in Figure 2A ), a COPII coat ( Figure S3A ) and the autophagosome marker GFP-LC3 ( Figure S3B ), but containing EDEM1 (arrowheads in Figure 2B ) and LC3 ( Figures 2C-2D ). The dual localization of SEL1L in the ER and in the ERAD tuning vesicles was confirmed upon their separation in isopycnic density gradients ( Figure 2E ) (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008) . These data would be consistent with the engagement of SEL1L as an ERAD tuning receptor that regulates the clearance of select ERAD factors from the ER lumen.\n\nThe colocalization of SEL1L and LC3 in the ERAD tuning vesicles ( Figures 2C-2E ), prompted us to test whether LC3-I directly binds to the cytosolic tail of SEL1L. To verify this, HeLa cells were mock-transfected ( Figure 3A , lane 1) or were transfected with a plasmid for expression of HA-tagged LC3 G120R (LC3-I-HA, Figure 3A , lane 2). The G120R mutation prevents the covalent association with phosphatidyl-ethanolamine. LC3 G120R is therefore inactive in autophagy and it does not label autophagosomes. In contrast, it associates with the membranes of the EDEM1-containing vesicles, both in noninfected and in MHVinfected cells . SEL1L ( Figure 3A , panels 1 and 2) or CNX ( Figure 3A , panels 3 and 4), an ER-resident type-I transmembrane protein with a cytosolic tail used here as a specificity control, were immunoisolated from cell lysates. The immunocomplexes were separated in SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot with an anti-LC3 antibody. LC3-I was found in immunocomplexes containing endogenous SEL1L ( Figure 3B , panel 2, lane 3). The coimmunoprecipitation of LC3-I was substantially reduced when the cytosolic tail of SEL1L was replaced with that of CNX ( Figure 3B , panel 2, lane 4). In contrast, the presence of LC3-I that was slightly above the background in the CNX immunoisolates ( Figure 3B , panel 4, lane 7) was significantly enhanced upon replacement of the cytosolic tail of CNX with that of SEL1L ( Figure 3B , panel 4, lane 8). Thus, the cytosolic tail of SEL1L recruits cytosolic LC3-I to the ER-derived vesicles containing EDEM1.\n\nRerouting to the EDEM1-Containing Vesicles Next, we assessed the role of the LC3-I-recruiting cytosolic tail of SEL1L in redirecting proteins into the ER-derived vesicles containing EDEM1. To this end, SEL1L ( Figure 3C ), SEL1L CNX (E) Separation of ERAD tuning vesicles from the ER in isopycnic density gradients as thoroughly described in (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008; Reggiori et al., 2010) . \n\nIn cells expressing a folding-defective protein, a lower fraction of endogenous SEL1L is engaged in complexes containing EDEM1 (Figures 1 and S2A ) and LC3-I ( Figure 4A ) and a larger fraction of endogenous SEL1L is engaged in the HRD1 dislocon (Figure S2B) . In these cells, the number and the size of the SEL1L/ LC3-I-positive vesicles are substantially reduced compared to control cells ( Figures 4B-4E) . Possibly, SEL1L must be disengaged from the HRD1 dislocon to act as an LC3-I-associated ERAD tuning receptor segregating EDEM1 and OS-9 in the ERAD tuning vesicles. Consistent with this hypothesis, HRD1 is excluded from the ERAD tuning vesicles ( Figure S4 ).\n\nTo gain further evidences on the involvement of SEL1L and LC3-I in ERAD tuning, we assessed the consequences of their silencing on the intracellular level of EDEM1 and OS-9. LC3 silencing ( Figure 5A defective polypeptide (Figures 1 and  S2 ) rises the intracellular levels of EDEM1 and OS-9 by inhibiting their turnover without affecting their synthesis. Likewise, the inactivation of ERAD tuning upon reduction of SEL1L and LC3 expression did not activate UPR programs. This was confirmed by the unchanged intracellular level of GRP94 ( Figure 5A , panel 5 and quantifications), by the undetectable levels of transcripts for sXbp1 ( Figure 5B ) and by the unchanged incorporation of [ 35 S]-methionine/cysteine in nascent endogenous EDEM1 ( Figure 5C ). Rather, in cells with low content of SEL1L the turnover of EDEM1 ( Figure 5D ) and OS-9 ( Figure 5E , quantifications) were delayed. Altogether, these data are consistent with the identification of SEL1L as the elusive ERAD tuning receptor regulating the selective removal of EDEM1 and OS-9 from the ER (Bernasconi and Molinari, 2011) . The lumenal domain of SEL1L selects the cargo proteins entering the ERAD tuning vesicles, the cytosolic tail of SEL1L associates with LC3-I, which drives segregation of the complexes in these ER-derived vesicles. As an additional control, segregation of recombinant EDEM1 into the vesicles, which is normally inefficient possibly because of receptor-saturation (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008) , is enhanced upon coexpression of SEL1L ( Figures 5F-5H ). \n\nThe enhancement of ERAD capacity in cells containing elevated levels of ERAD regulators may compromise the capacity to productively terminate folding programs (e.g., Cal\u00ec et al. [2008] , Tsai et al. [2007] , and Wu et al., [2003] ). This was confirmed in our experiments where the intracellular content of EDEM1 and OS-9 was increased upon ERAD tuning inactivation resulting from LC3 silencing ( Figure 5A ). Under these conditions, the disposal of a folding-defective protein was faster as monitored upon quantification of the decay of radiolabeled BACE457D (Figures 6A-6B ; Molinari et al., 2003) . More significantly, the amount of radiolabeled a1AT harvested from the cell culture media was substantially reduced and the fraction of this secretory protein inappropriately selected for disposal increased from less than 5% in control cells to 25%-30% upon ERAD tuning inhibition (Figures 6C-6D) . Thus, in a subcellular compartment were folding and selection for disposal of immature polypeptides are in kinetic competition, the regulation of ERAD chaperones turnover by ERAD tuning is crucial to reduce interferences with ongoing folding programs and to maintain cellular proteostasis.\n\nInfection of mammalian cells with MHV results in the accumulation of putative replication platform vesicles containing viral dsRNA, the host cell proteins LC3-I, EDEM1 and OS-9, but lacking conventional ER markers Reggiori et al., 2010) . Consistent with the notion that ERAD tuning vesicles are hijacked during MHV infection, we identified SEL1L as a host protein located in the structures containing viral dsRNA accumulating in MHV infected cells (Figures 6E-6H ). Since the downregulation of SEL1L inhibits the vesicle-mediated segregation of EDEM1 and OS-9 from the ER ( Figure 5 ), we hypothesized that MHV replication as well could be impaired. Indeed, silencing of SEL1L caused a 2-fold inhibition of MHV replication as shown by the reduced synthesis of the luciferase reporter gene (Figure 6I ), which is stably integrated into the viral genome (de Haan et al., 2005) . As previously reported , LC3 silencing inhibited MHV replication, while downregulation of EDEM1 had no effect ( Figure 6I ) confirming that the receptor complex, but not the cargo of the ERAD tuning vesicles is crucial for efficient viral replication. Altogether, the data shown in Figure 6 support a role of SEL1L as crucial component of the ERAD tuning machinery that sets ERAD activity at levels that do not interfere with protein biogenesis. They also offer additional evidences showing that MHV co-opts ERAD tuning vesicles for replication.\n\nERAD Tuning: the Selective Clearance of ERAD Factors from the ER at Steady State Molecular chaperones and folding enzymes are long-living proteins. Several regulators of ERAD (e.g., the ERManI [Termine et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2007] , HERP [Hori et al., 2004; Miura et al., 2010] , SEL1L [Mueller et al., 2006] , gp78 [Ballar et al., 2010; Shmueli et al., 2009] , EDEM1 and OS-9 [Cal\u00ec et al., 2008; Le Fourn et al., 2009; Reggiori et al., 2010] ) are characterized by faster turnover rates ( Figure S1B ). Some of them are ubiquitylated and degraded by cytosolic proteasomes (Ballar et al., 2010; Hori et al., 2004; Miura et al., 2010; Mueller et al., 2006; Shmueli et al., 2009) . Others, such as EDEM1, OS-9 and the\n\nERManI are degraded by lysosomal enzymes (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008; Le Fourn et al., 2009; Reggiori et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2007) . The proteasome-and the lysosome-dependent mechanisms regulating the selective clearance of ERAD factors from the ER at steady state are collectively defined as ERAD tuning. ERAD factors should exclusively remove terminally misfolded polypeptides from the ER thereby contrasting their toxic accumulation. If the lumenal concentration of ERAD regulators is aberrantly increased, the resulting enhanced ERAD activity may drastically reduce the time allocated to nascent chains for maturation. Selection of not-yet-native folding intermediates for destruction reduces the overall efficiency of protein biogenesis (e.g., (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2011; Joshi et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2003; Nunziante et al., 2011; Saeed et al., 2011; Stagg et al., 2009; Tsai et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2003; Yamasaki et al., 2005; Younger et al., 2006) , this work). Increased intralumenal concentration of ERAD factors might result from increased synthesis or defective turnover and has been linked to loss-of-function phenotypes reported for rheumatoid arthritis (Yamasaki et al., 2005) , increased sarcoma metastasis (Joshi et al., 2010; Tsai et al., 2007) , control of hepatitis C virus production (Saeed et al., 2011) and immunoevasion (Tortorella et al., 2000) to name few examples.\n\nThe dual Function of SEL1L in Maintenance of Cellular Proteostasis Cargo proteins are N-glycosylated in the ER lumen. The progressive removal of individual mannose residues signals the ''aging'' of proteins in the folding compartment, i.e., their incapacity to attain the native conformation. The ''rate of aging'' is determined by the intralumenal concentration of mannose processing and mannosebinding proteins such as the ERManI, EDEM1, OS-9, XTP3-B that generate/recognize the protein-bound oligosaccharide code determining the conclusion of the folding-attempts phase and the selection for disposal (Aebi et al., 2010; Molinari, 2007) . Enhanced expression (Wu et al., 2003) or defective turnover of these ERAD factors (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008) may increase the fraction of nascent chains inappropriately destroyed before attainment of the native structure. In addition to recognition of oligosaccharides displayed on folding-defective polypeptides, EDEM1 and OS-9 may use their ML and MRH domains to associate with SEL1L oligosaccharides (Christianson et al., 2012; Christianson et al., 2008; Cormier et al., 2009; Hanna et al., 2012; Satoh et al., 2010) . We show that these associations regulate the constitutive, COPII-independent vesicular clearance from the ER of EDEM1, OS-9 and possibly other ERAD regulators such as XTP3-B and EDEM3 (also shown to associate \n\nwith SEL1L (Christianson et al., 2012 (Christianson et al., , 2008 Saeed et al., 2011) and the ERManI, which is degraded by lysosomal enzymes (Wu et al., 2007) and is found in EDEM1-containing fractions separated in density gradients ( Figure S4 ). SEL1L plays therefore a dual role in maintenance of cellular proteostasis as an adaptor of the HRD1 dislocation machinery with a well-characterized function in ERAD (Bagola et al., 2011; Hebert et al., 2010) and as part of the membrane-bound receptor regulating the segregation of EDEM1 and OS-9 from the ER lumen. Association of the ubiquitin-like protein LC3-I to the proline-rich cytosolic tail of SEL1L drives the constitutive segregation of the EDEM1/OS-9:SEL1L complex into ER-derived vesicles. Folding-defective polypeptides compete with SEL1L for engagement of EDEM1/ OS-9 in the ER lumen and also inhibit the association of LC3-I with the cytosolic tail of SEL1L possibly by stabilizing SEL1L in the HRD1 dislocon. It is likely that to act as an ERAD tuning receptor, SEL1L must be disengaged from the dislocation machinery. We postulate that the lumenal absence ( Figure 7A ) or presence ( Figure 7B ) of misfolded polypeptides determines the preferential engagement of SEL1L in the ERAD tuning or in the ERAD pathways, respectively.\n\nMassive accumulation of folding-defective polypeptides in the ER lumen activates UPR programs resulting in induction of chaperones expression, attenuation of ER cargo load, ER expansion and, eventually, cell death (Walter and Ron, 2011) . Our data show that lumenal expression of folding-defective polypeptides at levels that do not induce UPR may selectively enhance ERAD activity by inactivating the ERAD tuning programs (i.e., the constitutive clearance of ERAD factors from the ER) operating at steady state.\n\nCumulating evidences show that E3 ligases may ubiquitylate themselves (Laney and Hochstrasser, 2002) and other components of the ERAD machinery (e.g., HERP, gp78, SEL1L, ataxin-3) (Ballar et al., 2010; Durcan et al., 2012; Hori et al., 2004; Miura et al., 2010; Mueller et al., 2006; Shmueli et al., 2009 ) thereby determining their intracellular levels and activities. It is conceivable that also this proteasome-dependent branch of ERAD tuning is inhibited by the lumenal expression of folding-defective polypeptides. These would serve as preferred\n\nacceptor for the ubiquitylating activity of the E3 ligases thereby protecting the ERAD machinery from self-destruction ( Figure 7B ).\n\nAll in all, misfolded proteins may enhance the cellular ERAD activity by a sort of autocrine regulatory mechanism(s) that inhibits the constitutive rapid turnover/inactivation of select ERAD factors. This ERAD substrate-induced, UPR-independent enhancement of the ERAD capacity does not require signal transduction from the ER to the nucleus. It therefore represents a more rapid and readily reversible response than UPR-regulated chaperone induction to deal with transient problems that may arise in the folding compartment. In this scenario, UPR induction might eventually occur upon more persistent environmental perturbations or upon substantial lumenal accumulation of folding-defective proteins.\n\nThe MHV hijacks components of the ERAD tuning machinery during its infection cycle Reggiori et al., 2010) and this work). Before our report that this CoV presumably co-opts EDEM1/OS-9/LC3-I-containing vesicles for replication, no host cell protein had been identified in these ER-derived structures that notably lack conventional markers of the secretory pathway. Establishing the role of the ERAD tuning receptor proteins in formation of the ERAD tuning vesicles possibly used as a platform for the replication of the viral genome and the identification of other pathogens that hijack the ERAD tuning machinery for host cell invasion remain matter for future studies.\n\nExpression Plasmids, Antibodies, and Inhibitors Plasmids encoding ERp27, SEL1L, HRD1 and GFP-LC3 were kind gifts of L. Ruddock, K. Yamamoto, T. Nakajima and N. Mizushima.

The chimeras SEL1L CNX and CNX SEL1L were generated by fusing the lumenal domain of human SEL1L (1-661) or dog CNX (1-466) with the C-terminal domain of CNX (467-594) or SEL1L (658-791), respectively.

Cells at 80%-90% confluence were transfected with the expression plasmid of interest using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Experiments were performed 17 hr after transfection. For siRNA-based interference, HeLa cells at 50% confluence in a 3.5 cm tissue culture plate were transfected with siRNA duplex (Ambion Inc, 50 pmol/dish) using Lipofectamine 2000. siRNA targeting sequences: for LC3 ; for SEL1L: GGCUAUACUGUGG CUAGAA. Experiments were performed 48 hr after transfection. Stable cell lines have been generated and selected upon transfection of HEK293 cells with an empty plasmid (Mock), a plasmid for expression of a folding defective, membrane-bound variant of NHK (NHK B ), or a plasmid for expression of a membrane-bound variant of secretory protein (a1AT B ).\n\nMetabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitations, Western Blots, Analysis of Data HeLa cells were pulsed with 0.1 mCi [ 35 S]-methionine/cysteine mix and chased for the indicated times with MEM Alpha supplemented with 5 mM cold methionine and cysteine. Postnuclear supernatant was prepared by solubilization of cells in ice-cold 2% CHAPS (Anatrace) in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS), pH 6.8, containing 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide and protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations were performed by adding protein A or G beads (Sigma; 1:10, w/v swollen in HBS) with the selected antibody and incubated for 2 hr to overnight at 4 C. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed (3x10 min) with 0.5% CHAPS in HBS, resuspended in sample buffer, boiled for 5 min and finally separated in SDS-PAGE. Gels were exposed to BioMax (Kodak) films and scanned with an Agfa scanner. Relevant bands were quantified by \n\nImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Western blots were performed using the SNAP i.d. system (Millipore). The ECL-Plus detection system was from Amersham, signal was detected using LAS 4000 system and bands were quantified using the Multi Gauge Analysis tool.\n\nHeLa cells were plated 17 hr before fixation on alcian blue-treated glass coverslips. Cells were exposed for 4 hr to 100 mM CQ (to prevent the fusion of EDEM1-containing vesicles with LAMP1-positive degradative organelles) were washed twice with PBS and fixed at RT for 20 min in serum-free buffered medium containing 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were washed two times with 10 mM HEPES serum-free medium and two times with PBS. The antigen accessibility was improved by a 20 min incubation with 0,05% saponin, 10% Goat serum, 10 mM HEPES and 15 mM glycine (PS). Cells were incubated with the primary antibodies diluted 1:100 in PS for at least 45 min, washed 15 min in PS, then incubated with DAPI (Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) diluted 1:200 in PS for at least 30 min. Cells were rinsed with PS and water and mounted in Mowiol. Microscopic images were collected using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica DI6000 microscope stand connected to a SP5 scan head) equipped with a HCX PL APO CS 100x1.44 oil UV objective. ImageJ software (version 1.45r) was used for image analysis and processing. The size of the EDEM1/ OS-9/LC3-I-containing vesicles has been calculated with the Leica LAS AF software. For the three-dimensional reconstruction, Z stacks were acquired with a step size of 0.13 mm (total size-depth of 4.9 mm). Analysis and reconstruction were prepared using the Imaris x64 software (version 6.1.1; www.bitplane.com).\n\nHeLa cells were mock-treated or incubated for 12 hr with 2.5 mg/ml tunicamycin. Cells were lyzed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNA was isolated according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Two mg of RNA were used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with transcript-specific primers: unspliced+spliced Xbp1, AAACAGAGTAGCAGCTCAGACTGC (for), TGGCTGGATGAAAGCAG GTT (rev); b-Actin, CTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTCCT (for), GGAGCAATGATCTT GATCTT (rev).\n\nHeLa cells with a confluency of 50% were inoculated at a moi of 1-10 with recombinant MHV-Srec expressing the firefly luciferase gene (de Haan et al., 2005) for 1 hr at 37 C. The viral media was then replaced with fresh medium and cells were incubated for 6 hr at 37 C. Virus replication was quantified by measuring the luciferase expression using the firefly luciferase assay kit (Steadylite plus, PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, cells were fixed in 4% PFA and analyzed by confocal microscopy.\n\nAt least three independent experiments were quantified, analyzed with the Prism 5 software and plotted as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Unpaired student's t test was used to compare the mean of control and experimental groups. The p value was defined as follow: not significant (n.s.): p > 0.05; *: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001. All p values are two tailed.\n\nSupplemental Information includes five figures and can be found with this article online at doi:10.1016/j.molcel.2012.04.017."}
