{"title": "The airborne transmission of infection between flats in high-rise residential buildings: Tracer gas simulation", "body": "Airborne transmission is known to be the route of infection for a number of diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Beggs's study in hospital buildings concluded that the contribution of airborne micro-organisms to the spread of infection is likely to be underestimated currently although contact-spread is the principal route of transmission for most infections [1] . Airborne transmission is deemed as long-range aerosol transmission, which refers to the situation that agents can be carried long distances (within a room or between rooms, generally greater than 1 m) by air flows [2] . With the lessons from SARS outbreak in 2003 and the threats from a possible approaching avian influenza pandemic, our concern about aerosol-transmitted infections in hospitals buildings, residential buildings, and even in transportation vehicles has been refreshed. Li et al. [3] reviewed over 40 studies on the relationship between the transmission of infection and ventilation systems in hospitals, offices, aircraft cabins, etc. This interdisciplinary review found that there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate the association between ventilation, indoor air movements and the transmission of infection diseases. In a hospital environment, on the basis of the principle of diluting contaminated air using fresh air, a ventilation rate of at least 12 air changes per hour is recommended for new isolation rooms (constructed since 2001) equipped with mechanical ventilation systems [4] . To restrict virus transmission between wards, negative pressure ventilation systems are used. However, Escombe median ventilation of 28 air changes per hour (ACH), more than double that of mechanically ventilated rooms [5] . The airborne infection probability for 24 h exposure to tuberculosis predicted by the Wells-Riley model was reduced from 39% in mechanically ventilated rooms to 33% in naturally ventilated rooms. They suggested that in resource-limited settings where negative-pressure isolation rooms were difficult to implement, natural ventilation may be a low-cost alternative.\n\nOn the other hand, anecdotal evidence in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak in the spring of 2003 shows that in certain high-rise residential buildings, adjacent upper floor residents were infected after those on the lower floor. In addition, the SARS virus was found within the deposits on the windowsill and floors on two other upper floors, where residents on floors immediately beneath had been infected with SARS. Prompt investigations upon the occurrences ruled out the possibilities of the spread via unsealed U-traps of the drainage systems in the building. These blocks have rectangular plan layouts and have common corridors separating the two sides, each of which has a flat-facade with operable windows. With doors closed, the flats become single-sided naturally ventilated, and the open windows function as both inlet and outlet of air. Room exhaust air, which is typically not centralized and not stacked, is left to drift freely around the building. Therefore, the exhaust air of one flat may become the intake of the adjacent upper flat. Under normal circumstances, one can detect from the smell of the air what one's neighbor is cooking. This fact arouses our concern about the vertical upward transport of contaminants between flats in high-rise residential buildings with natural ventilation, i.e., there may be a cascade effect, which has been over-looked so far in both building design and infection control.\n\nIn recent years, natural ventilation has attracted considerable interest in the designs of green buildings [6] . There are two major forms of natural ventilation: singlesided and cross flow. Cross ventilation generally promotes a robust airflow through an internal space via multiple\n\nthermal diffusivity (m 2 /s) A window opening area (m 2 ) C number of new cases C d discharge coefficient c p specific heat of air (J/kg K) C 0 initial indoor tracer gas concentration (ppm) C t tracer gas concentration at time t (ppm) D depth of the room (m) e base of natural logarithms Fr\n\nFroude number g gravity acceleration (m/s 2 ) g 0 reduced gravity to describe buoyancy force, openings on different facades. However, in densely occupied urban environments, there may be only one external fac -ade for small cellular rooms. The design of buildings thus often adopts single-sided natural ventilation. In this configuration, wind turbulence and temperature differences between indoor and outdoor areas are the main driving forces. Although the uncertainty of these driving forces makes natural ventilation not as controllable as mechanical ventilation, a well-designed natural ventilation system is not only energy efficient compared with mechanical ventilation systems, but also able to provide a comfortable and healthy indoor environment. Temperature-driven single-sided natural ventilation through large openings has been fully studied in regard to air change rate [7] and the resulting indoor air quality and comfort level [8] by experimental works [9] , theoretical predictions [10] , and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations [11] . However, less consideration has been given to the fate of the exhaust air so far, and on whether it will re-enter the upper floor with the same mechanism. Allocca et al. [12] simulated pure buoyancy-driven single-sided natural ventilation through a lower and upper opening in a three-storey building. They found that although the flats were physically and thermally isolated from one another, the indoor temperature level in each flat increased slightly with height, which they attributed to the outside thermal plume from the openings underneath. In their configurations, the distance between upper openings of one space and lower openings of the above space was small. Unfortunately, this cascade effect of energy is not elaborated in detail in their study, nor the transport of contaminants. From the point of view of infection control, this cascade air flow is undesirable. Earlier special onsite investigations after the SARS outbreak revealed that the room immediately upstairs could contain up to 7% of the exhaust air from the lower floor [13] . Our previous simulations also exhibited this cascade effect in windless cases [14] . This study applies the CFD method to investigate the combined effect of wind and buoyancy on the upward contaminant transport. The investigation is focused on the passive tracer gas concentration field and infection risks. Some of the results are compared with the earlier on-site measurements [13] . Considering that the sizes of human-generated aerosols typically range from 5 to 100 mm, using a tracer gas to represent their aerodynamic behaviors by neglecting the gravity effect on the aerosols can reasonably give meaningful results, especially for those fine droplets. The aerosols' movement modeling, which can more accurately capture the dispersion characteristics of sneezed/coughed virus-containing droplets, will be studied and reported in a separate paper.\n\nThe computations are carried out by using a commercial program, Fluent [15] . This program solves the governing equations in a finite-volume procedure with a staggered grid system. The turbulent effect is simulated by the renormalization group (RNG) k-e model. All thermophysical properties are assumed to be constant except for density, which is treated with the Boussinesq model. The Boussinesq model approximates density in the buoyancy term in the momentum equation by the following equation:\n\nThe generation of turbulence due to buoyancy in the transport equations for k and e equations is included by\n\nThe convection terms are discretized by second order upwind scheme and the diffusion term by central differences and with second-order accuracy. The SIMPLE algorithm [16] is adopted as pressure-velocity coupling method. The elementary flow characteristics involved in the present study are natural convection flows in a cavity and forced convection flows over a bluff body. As validations of the above model, the simulations on natural convection and forced convection are compared with the measured data from the literature. In particular, the experimental data from Denmark Aalborg University [17] are also used to validate the modeling of pure buoyancy-driven singlesided natural ventilation.\n\nCheesewright et al. [18] measured a two-dimensional buoyancy flow in an enclosed cavity (Fig. 1 ). The temperature difference between the vertical opposite walls is 45.8 K, corresponding to a Rayleigh number (Ra \u00bc \u00f0gb\u00f0T h \u00c0 T c \u00deH 3 \u00de=\u00f0u \u00c2 a\u00de) of 2.8 \u00c2 10 10 . Because this cavity flow is relatively stable and the flow characteristics are similar to indoor airflows, the experimental data have been widely used to validate the computation of Reynoldsstress models [19] , large eddy simulation [20] , and low-Reynolds-number k-e model [21] . Here the RNG k-e model including low-Reynolds-number effect is adopted since the flow pattern consists of both turbulent and laminar flow. For improving the simulation of the boundary layer and convective heat transfer from the walls, a two-layer wall function is used [14] . The first grids are located within the viscous sub-layer with y + o1. The overall grids number is 273 (H) \u00c2 74 (L) (Fig. 1) .\n\nThe mean velocity distribution at the middle height and the vertical dimensionless core temperature (defined as (T\u00c0T cold )/(T h \u00c0T cold ) are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The prediction of mean velocity agrees well with the experiment, whereas the temperature profile is higher than the experimental data. Heat loss due to imperfect insulation at the top and bottom walls in the experiment reduces the core temperature at any level [18] . The linear vertical gradient of the dimensionless temperature is represented well by RNG k-e model, and the relaminarization effect at the bottom of the hot wall and the top of the cold wall is clearly captured in this simulation. The value of convective heat transfer coefficient based on the wall-to-cavity-center temperature difference is 3.51 W/m 2 K. It is very close to the simulation by Chen et al. [22] using low-Reynoldsnumber k-e models (3.8 W/m 2 K). This shows that the twolayer wall function can effectively correct the generally over-predicted convective heat transfer by the standard wall function.\n\nJiang et al. [23] carried out wind tunnel tests to investigate the airflow around a building-like model, whose dimensions are 250 mm (H) \u00c2 250 mm (L) \u00c2 250 mm (W) with a wall thickness of 6 mm (Fig. 4a) . The mean air velocity and its fluctuation along 10 vertical lines were measured by a laser Doppler anemometer. The mean air velocities at four of these lines, ranging from 25 to 500 mm in height, are selected for comparisons with the current simulation (Fig. 4b ). In the isothermal simulation, the computational domain have a downstream length of 8H, an upstream of 4H, a lateral length of 4W on both sides, and a height of 4H. The domain inlet velocity profile in the x direction follows a logarithmic law (U\u00f0y\u00de \u00bc \u00f0U 0 =k\u00de ln\u00f0y=y 0 \u00de), and the velocity components in y and z directions are zero. The velocity vector at the middle section is illustrated in Fig. 5 , and mean velocity distributions at different height levels are shown in Fig. 6 . It is well known that the flowfield around a surface-mounted cube involves impinge-ment, separation, and vortex shedding, etc. The use of isotropic k-e models and wall functions has revealed deficiencies in this situation, with Reynolds-stress model performing better and large eddy simulation being the best. In Fig. 5 , the recirculation zones before and after the cubic are reproduced by the RNG model. However, the small reverse flow above the cubic is not captured. Murakami et al. [24] attributed this error to the over-prediction of turbulent kinetic energy in the stagnant impingement region, which consequently produced large eddy viscosity and the reverse flow on the cubic roof was negated by this large viscosity. The simulated velocity agrees well with the measurement except at the line H/2 above the cubic and line 2H behind the cubic (Fig. 6 ). The negative simulated velocity at the lower part of the line 2H means the RNG model predicts a larger separation region. In its wake the vortex-shedding effects, which promote momentum exchange and thereby shorten the separation region, are ignored by the steady-state k-e models. Despite the inaccuracies of k-e models in the calculation of flow around a bluff body, the simulation of flow field inside the building and at the windward close to the opening is satisfactory. It justifies our application of the RNG model in the study of the cascade effect on a moderate day without wind or with a gentle breeze.\n\nAnother concern is the method to estimate the ventilation rate through the opening. The ventilation rate can be calculated by several methods, including the use of empirical models, integration of the velocity across the opening, and tracer gas concentration decay calculation. We adopted the tracer gas step-down method, i.e., the tracer gas decay method, by monitoring the transient evolution of the volume-averaged concentration indoors. This method is believed to be more rational than integration of air velocities because the outdoor air seems to form a short circuit at the opening and the effective depth of fresh air is very limited. Table 1 summarizes the ventilation rates. Because turbulent fluctuation contributes mainly to the air exchange in the wind-driven single-sided natural ventilation, Jiang and Chen [26] concluded that the time-averaged velocity field from k-e model significantly cancels out the instantaneous air exchange between the indoor and outdoor flows. Therefore, the mean ventilation rate is much smaller than the average of instantaneous values from large eddy simulation. In Table 1 , the ventilation rate from large eddy simulation is the highest. However, the result from the tracer gas decay method based on the airflow field predicted by the RNG model agrees with the empirical values. It cannot be judged which method is the best since no credible experimental data are available here.\n\nHeiselberg et al. [17] performed pure buoyancy-driven single-sided natural ventilation experiments at Aalborg University. A constant temperature difference was maintained between a large full-scale chamber, which simulated the outdoor cool environment (13 1C) , and a smaller test room inside the chamber, which was heated to a high temperature (33 1C) by electrical floor heating (Fig. 7) . There was a window opening (width 1.0 m \u00c2 height 1.6 m) in one of the test room walls at a height of 0.9 m. For measuring the air change rate, a tracer gas (N 2 O) was uniformly released in the test room with an initial average concentration of less than 100 ppm. After the stable temperature fields were reached, the window was quickly opened. Then the temperature field, velocity field, and concentration field were continuously monitored.\n\nFor a single large opening, using Bernoulli and mass conservation equations, the volume flow rate is \n\nThe discharge coefficient, C d , is a characteristic parameter for a specific window. It is influenced by window thickness, window height, aspect ratio, room depth and width, and indoor-to-outdoor temperature difference, etc. Generally speaking, a value of 0.6 is a proper approximation. The temporal evolution of air change rate per hour (ACH) and tracer gas decay is compared in Fig. 8(a) and (b) , respectively. The air change rate is derived from two approaches: integrating the normal air velocity across the window and calculation from Eq. (3). The predicted average concentration is in line with the experimental value, both of which accord with the exponential decay law. The air change rate reduces as the indoor-outdoor temperature difference decreases. In both approaches, the ACH is under-predicted. It is suspected that the temperature on the surface of the floor heater is still higher than 33 1C in experiments after electrical heating is turned off so causing a higher indoor air temperature and consequently a higher ACH. It is observed, in both the current simulations (Fig. 9 ) and the flow visualization in the experiments that the cold outdoor air pours into the room and spreads over the floor, behaving like the airflow from a low-velocity diffuser in displacement ventilation. The room air is displaced from the bottom to the top, with a vertical temperature gradient. Compared with upper and lower openings on one fac -ade, single openings normally generate low ventilation rates, and the effective depth of fresh air is not as far into the space [8] . However, in this case the outdoor air is able to Fig. 7 . A schematic view of the full-scale test chamber and the test room.\n\nreach the opposite wall along the floor, indicating an effective depth of fresh air distribution higher than the room length. Thus, a good indoor air quality is ensured. The net heat flow across the window is around \u00f0V rc p DT \u00bc 1000 W\u00de, which represents a cooling power of 76.7 W/m 2 (based on the floor area). This cooling capacity may provide a high level of thermal comfort because it exceeds the cooling load in many offices. Therefore, we can confidently expect that single-sided natural ventilation through a large opening in this case can provide adequate ventilation.\n\nTo study the possible cross contamination of ventilation air via open windows in multi-family buildings, a fourstorey building is adopted (Fig. 10) . Windows are opened at the windward end on the second and third floor. The room dimension is height (Y) \u00c2 length (X) \u00c2 width (Z) \u00bc 2.7 m \u00c2 3.1 m \u00c2 2.4 m and the window height (Y) \u00c2 width (Z) \u00bc 1.2 m \u00c2 0.75 m. The bottom of the window is 0.8 m above the room floor. These dimensions are identical with those in our field study. This building is placed in a computational domain, as illustrated in Fig. 10 . According to the experiences by Schaelin et al. [28] and Allocca et al. [12] , this domain is large enough to obtain the true results. The domain boundary at x-y plane is defined as symmetry. It means that the building and its surroundings are extended in the negative and positive z direction. This treatment is based on the fact that in many high-rise residential blocks in Hong Kong the shape of the whole building is like a vertical slab.\n\nHeat is released only from the internal walls on the second and third floors. The atmospheric air temperature is 20 1C and the indoor wall surface temperature is 25 1C. In the simulation of a low wind day, a uniform velocity profile (0.1 m/s) is set at the domain inlet, in place of pressure boundary. This is because we found it is difficult to reach convergence if using pressure boundary at the domain inlet as well as outlet. For this building configuration and an indoor-outdoor temperature difference of 5 1C, a very gentle wind at a speed less than 0.2 m/s will make the wind force and buoyancy force comparable, indicating an Archimedes number, Ar,\n\nIn a normal urban environment, even on a windless day in meteorology, the wind speeds are usually higher than this value (0.2 m/s). Therefore, a small meteorological wind speed, V met (wind speed usually taken at 10 m above the ground level), at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 m/s is considered. The wind profile in an urban environment is calculated by the following equation [27] :\n\nThe turbulence on the inlet boundary is characterized by turbulence intensity and length scale, which are 8% and 1 m, respectively. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), as a tracer of indoor pollutants, is generated at a rate of 8 mg/s in the middle of the second floor at the height of 1.6 m. The \n\nOn-site measurements were carried out at Wing Shui House in the spring from January to February of 2005 [13] . It was in spring that the SARS outbreak happened in 2003 in Hong Kong. During the period of measurement, the outdoor temperature varied from 10.6 to 24.0 1C and indoor temperature from 12.8 to 23.3 1C. Two units located adjacently at the second and third floor were rented. SF 6 were used as a tracer of indoor pollutant originating from the second floor at 3 ml/s and CO 2 as a tracer for determining the ventilation rate. SF 6 concentrations at six points (three points in the second floor and the other three points in the third floor) within the two rooms were monitored by B&K 1302 and INNOVA-1412. CO 2 concentrations were logged by TSI Q-Trak Model 8851. The wind speed components in the U, V, and W direction outside the window were measured using a YOUNG GILL UVW Anemometer (Model 27005). Indoor and outdoor temperatures were recorded simultaneously by StowAway Temperature Loggers.\n\nOne index, the re-entry ratio, was defined as the fraction of exhaust air from the lower source room which re-enters the adjacent upper room. It was found that on a windless day the ratio of the SF 6 concentration in the upper room to the lower room ranged from 3% to 7%, depending on the locations. The re-entry ratio is 4.8%, warning us of a high cross-infection probability by the upward cascade effect.\n\nSmoke visualization revealed this phenomenon qualitatively as well. Outside wind speed, when increased from 0-0.03 to 2.48 m/s, could lower the maximum concentration ratio to 3.6% and re-entry ratio to 0.6%.\n\nIn the iterations of numerical simulation, it was noticed that a steady quasi-periodic variation appears after around 8000 iterations, especially in the pure buoyancy-driven windless case. The residuals no longer decrease but are maintained at an acceptable level. The velocity and concentration fluctuate significantly, and the fluctuation amplitude is over 20% of the mean values. In principle, the thermal plume above a heat source is not stable because it may laterally oscillate at a certain frequency. In our investigation of the cascade effect, two-dimensional simulations are also performed, and it was found that if there is a wind outside the window blowing vertically upward, alternating indoor air flow patterns were observed at certain critical points of the iterations where aiding force and counter-aiding force are equivalent. The multiple numerical solutions of unstable airflows are not taken into account due to the limited computation resources. Large eddy simulation and transient simulation using two equation models are expected to perform better in these situations. However, they are much more time-consuming. The following results are from the converged field after 15,000 iterations in each case.\n\nTracer gas decaying as a function of time is plotted in Fig. 11 . At time \u00bc 0 s, the room is uniformly filled with tracer gas. Then the air exchange through the window is permitted and the normalized volume-average concentration is monitored. Given the previous discussion on pure buoyancy-driven natural ventilation in the validation section, here the emphasis is to explore the combined effect of weak wind and buoyancy on the ACH. As seen from Fig. 11 , a gentle wind up to 1.0 m/s normal to the window has little or no influence on the ACH. However, if the normal wind speed increases to 2.0 and 4.0 m/s, the ACH is remarkably lowered. This finding is supported by the experiment by Wilson and Kiel [29] . In their measurements, at small temperature differences less than 10 1C, a wind speed of 20 km/h measured 10 m above the ground produced flow rates through a sheltered doorway that were about 25% smaller than calm conditions. Based on our present simulations and previous studies, we find that the effects of weak wind are multiple and complicated. Firstly, as explained by Wilson and Kiel [29] , wind increases the intensity of outdoor turbulence, and further increases the interfacial mixing at the middle height of the opening between incoming and outgoing airstreams (Fig. 12) . This mixing lowers the net flow rate. It is the re-entrainment by interfacial mixing that produces the gradual profile of velocity and temperature along the height of the opening. The effect of wind could be evaluated by the Froude number, Fr \u00bc U=\u00f0g 0 h\u00de 1=2 . Davies and Linden's [30] measurement showed that the ACH decreased with increasing Fr. In current cases, Froude number at 3-4 would produce significant reduction on the ACH. Secondly, approaching wind speed profile may attenuate the net pressure difference across the opening (Fig. 13 ). Wind and stack forces counteract each other. The combined effect of opposing wind and buoyancy forces is widely studied in cross ventilation. Nevertheless, there are few reports of single-sided ventilation. Thirdly, turbulent fluctuations in wind contain high frequency energy, which could strengthen the air exchange through the opening [6] . The frequency of turbulence energy for wind-driven flow is one order of magnitude higher than that for buoyancy-driven flow [11, 14] . In buoyancy-driven cases, mean pressure differences across the opening impels airflow while, on the other hand, pressure fluctuation plays an important role in winddriven natural ventilation. In Fig. 11 , the ACH is higher on the second floor than on the third floor at a wind speed of 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 m/s. This discrepancy was observed in our field study as well. One possible explanation is that the wind speed at the height of the upper window is higher than at the lower window.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that although both existing studies from literature and our simulation results find the counteraction between wind and stack forces in singleside natural ventilation, due to the inherent inability of the k-e models, this finding still needs more experimental validations. \n\nMass fractions of the tracer gas at the middle section in z direction are shown in Fig. 14 Table 2 ). The average concentration in the upper room is two orders of magnitude lower than in the lower room. As wind speed ascends from 0.5 to 2.0 m/s, the plume is forced to approach the upper window by the impingement of the normal wind. The re-entry ratio increases to up to 16.3% as a result. The wind assists in the cascade effect. If the wind speed increases further to 4.0 m/s, the development of the warm plume from the lower window is confined. The air velocity levels in the two rooms (mean value 0.08 m/s) are quite lower than in the windless case, which results in a diffusion-dominated spread of pollutants. The re-entry ratio is the lowest (3.5%). It seems that strong normal wind will act as an air curtain. This curtain helps to block the heat and mass transfer between flats.\n\nIn this article only the transmission between two adjacent flats is discussed. Actually, the pollutants from the second floor may enter into the fourth floor and floors further above. By defining the re-entry ratio, k i,j as the fraction of exhaust air from the flat i which re-enters the flat j (ioj), and assuming that the pollutant source strength in the ith room is PS i , we can calculate the total mass of pollutants in the jth flat \u00bc P j\u00c01 i\u00c01 PS i \u00c2 k i;j . On the other hand, only the wind normal to the window is taken into account. In fact, the wind direction varies randomly, as confirmed in our field study. The wind which is parallel with the window in the horizontal plane can easily blow away the warm exhaust foul air from the window. In this scenario, the cascade transport is destroyed. However, the adjacent rooms on the same floor may be contaminated, giving birth to another problem.\n\nBased on the knowledge of infection dose (the number of organisms required to cause infection), the risk of airborne infection and ventilation rate per person can be correlated by Wells-Riley equation [31] :\n\nThe quantum, q, represents the generation rate of infectious doses. Exposure to one quantum gives an average infection probability of (1\u00c0e \u00c01 ). The Wells-Riley equation is set up on the assumption of a well-mixed and steady-state condition. Here using CFD we can get the concentration of infectious particles at a certain point, which allows derivation of spatial distribution of infection risk. It does not require the assumption of well-mixed conditions. The spatial variance of infection probability is similar with the distribution of mass fraction of the tracer gas (Fig. 14) . A high mass fraction denotes a high risk.\n\nSupposing one patient standing in the middle of the second floor producing 13 infectious quanta per hour (q \u00bc 13), pulmonary ventilation rate at 0.6 m 3 /h (p \u00bc 0.6), and exposure time of 8 h (t \u00bc 8), the calculated mean infection probabilities are listed in Table 2 . These probabilities can give a rough estimation of the infection risk level although the occupants may move in the room sometimes. The mean infection risk is highest in the case of 2.0 m/s due to the highest re-entry ratio. A probability as high as 6.6% on the third floor alerts us that the upward transport of infectious diseases in high-rise residential buildings is worthy of due consideration in infection control. As one of the effective intervention measures is to isolate and quarantine the close-contacts, the upstairs household residents may be included in the close-contact list in case of a highly infectious disease.\n\nSARS case clusters in several high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong in 2003 have motivated the authors to seriously evaluate the degree to which the airborne virus can be transported by natural ventilative airflows through open windows between flats in high-rise residential buildings in crowded urban environments. As a counterpart of the field study, which revealed qualitatively and quantitatively that the vertical upward re-entry into the upper room of exhaust air from the lower adjacent room is a reality, the present study employs CFD technique to quantify the infection risks. Comparisons with experimental data of some elementary flows including the natural convection in a cavity, air flow around a bluff body, and pure buoyancy-driven natural ventilation through a large opening help to enhance the confidence level of modeling the cascade effect in windless and gentle-wind conditions.\n\nIt is found that, on a windless day, around 7.5% of the exhaust air can be re-entrained into the upper room. The concentration level is generally 2 orders of magnitude lower in the adjacent upper room than in the lower source room, but the risk of infection is only 1 order of magnitude lower and is still significantly high when it is assessed using the Wells-Riley TB infection model. One of the parameters is the long time that residents would spend at their own homes. The effect of wind blowing perpendicularly to the window is rather complicated. It may reinforce or prevent the upward transport, depending on the wind speed. A gentle-wind forces the warm polluted plume to enter into the upper window by its horizontal momentum. But high-speed winds may function like an air curtain, suppressing the convective spread of pollutants between flats. In spite of these complexities, the vertical spread risks should not be overlooked from the perspective of infection control, especially when an emerging infectious disease is dealt with. Present simulations using the RNG k-e model are not able to reveal the turbulent fluctuations and instantaneous air exchanges through the opening, especially in winddriven single-sided natural ventilation, although we find the value of ACH from the RNG k-e model is acceptable. The symmetrical boundary conditions imposed on the pollutant concentration equations in the horizontal directions may have overestimated the vertical transmission, but the effects are expected to be small, and will be examined in our further studies."}
