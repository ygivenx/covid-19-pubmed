{"title": "SEASONALITY OF VIRAL RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN SOUTHEAST OF BRAZIL: THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE AND AIR HUMIDITY Viral respiratory infections", "body": "Brazil is a country where several studies revealed viruses as the main causes of respiratory infections in Fortaleza, in Rio de Janeiro, in S\u00e3o Paulo and in Curitiba (18, 35, 36) , as reported by Arruda et al. (1) . These viruses cause illness that can range from a brief upper respiratory tract infection, as a common cold, to a severe systemic illness, like bronchiolitis and pneumonia, resulting in death (11) .\n\nLarge countries like Brazil possess a wide range of geographical areas, each one with unique climatic characteristics. Epidemiological studies from tropical regions indicate that factors as rainy seasons (34) or low air humidity (3) , in addition to temperature, may influence respiratory viruses outbreaks. Global warming carries profound changes in Earth\u00b4s climate, and major changes in the atmosphere and in the climate have a vast impact on the biosphere and the human environment (20) . Consequently, climatic variations and extreme weather events also cause profound impacts on infectious diseases incidences. Infectious agents (such as protozoa, bacteria and viruses) are devoid of thermostatic mechanisms, and reproduction and survival rates are thus strongly affected by fluctuations in temperature. Temperature dependencies are seen in correlations between disease rates and weather variations over weeks, months or years, as well as in close geographic associations with key climatic variables and the distributions of important infectious diseases (28) .\n\nKnowledge of the trends and seasonality of respiratory viral infections in the community could be a first step to confer information for health care providers, to facilitate the implementation of strategies to prevent and minimize transmission, and also introduce early therapeutic options to high risk patients (13) .\n\nThe aim of this study was to detect the presence of respiratory viruses in clinical samples collected from children with respiratory tract infection, and analyze the seasonal trends and occurrence patterns of the identified viruses.\n\nThis study was conducted at the Genomic Studies The total respiratory infections were detected mainly in winter, spring and summer of 2004, and autumn and winter of 2005, as showed in Figure 1A , which also demonstrate the seasonal distribution of the detected respiratory viruses.\n\nInterestingly, the incidence of viral respiratory infections Results present a significant association between viral respiratory infections and monthly average of minimal relative air humidity (p=0.046) as well as between the monthly average of minimal temperature (p=0.044). Therefore, it was evidenced that meteorological aspects may present influence one over the other, thus temperature tends to fluctuate according to characteristics of relative air humidity while the relative air humidity also varies according to the temperature. In Singapore rates of HRSV disease were associated with higher temperature, lower relative humidity and higher maximal day-to-day temperature variation (3). Weber et al.\n\n(1998) described a peak in HRSV-associated ALRI during the rainy season in The Gambia (39); however, earlier studies did not find such an association (15) . Chan and colleagues reported HRSV disease to be directly associated with number of days of rainfall in a month and inversely associated with monthly mean temperature in Malaysia (4). The study, however, did not find an association between HRSV disease and total monthly precipitation (4).\n\nOn our study HRSV outbreaks presented defined seasonality, occurring in winter, early spring and late autumn periods, being these data similar to previous obtained results (3, 22, 27 Knowledge about HMPV seasonality is limited in Brazil.\n\nDespite our results show a low percentage of HMPV detection, they agree with previous reported data (5, 16) showing this virus detection mainly in autumn; however, no significant statistical correlation to variations on temperature or relative air humidity was obtained.\n\nThe only positive sample to HPIV2 was collected during winter. HPIV1 and HPIV3 detection occurred mainly in late winter and spring. Similar results were reported (5, 26) showing this virus presence in samples collected in spring, autumn and winter. According to literature, HPIV3 are the most frequent viruses from this family, being type 1 and 2 viruses barely detected or even detected, which shows agreement with obtained results to literature data.\n\nFLUA and FLUB were detected in few samples; however, these samples were collected during autumn and winter, agreeing to previous studies that showed Inlfuenza outbreaks occurring between late summer and early winter (11, 24, 26) .
