{"title": "", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a rapid-onset atypical pneumonia that was first identified in epidemic proportions in China in 2002. 1 WHO recently announced the containment of the latest outbreak, which was centred on the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. 2 In today's Lancet, Alexander Bukreyev and colleagues show that a single intranasal immunisation in African green monkeys with the attenuated bovine/human parainfluenza virus type 3 (BHPIV3), into which the envelope spike (S) protein from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been expressed, induced neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV in serum, and protected against subsequent live-viral challenge with SARS-CoV.\n\nThis finding is important since it brings together known yet innovative technologies, knowledge, and skills to address prevention of an emerging infectious disease. If applicable generally, the result could represent a major step forward for simplifying mass immunisation in at-risk human populations. On the basis that the S protein of other coronaviruses induced virus-specific immunity and, in some cases, protection against subsequent challenge in animal models, 3 Bukreyev and colleagues used a welldocumented carrier vector, BHPIV, 3, 4 to create a liveattenuated vaccine that protects monkeys against challenge with SARS-CoV.\n\nSeveral animal viruses display the type of stable hostrange restriction that led to the development of the Jennerian approach to live-attenuated vaccines, as used in creating the BHPIV3 vector. This chimeric vector has important potential in inducing protective immune responses against respiratory syncytial virus (A and B) and human parainfluenza virus (type 3) in rhesus monkeys and hamsters. 5, 6 Human trials show that the live-attenuated bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) is safe, immunogenic, and stable in infants and children, 7 and BHPIV3 produces enhanced immunogenicity against disease in rhesus monkeys. 6 Data are not yet available on the use of the BHPIV3 chimeric vector in human trials.\n\nIntranasal live-attenuated viral vectors offer the best possibility of inducing sustainable protective immunity via the mucosal route. In the host-restricted approach to attenuation, it has been seen that: powerful adjuvants are not required; 6 that both systemic and mucosal immune responses are generated; 7 and that exacerbation of disease after natural exposure does not seem to occur. 8 Additionally, mucosal immunisation offers the advantage that mucosal immune mechanisms seem to mature earlier in young children and wane later in elderly people than with systemic immune mechanisms. 9 Despite the promise demonstrated by the Jennerian approach and in particular the BHPIV3/SARS-S intranasal vaccine, we need to know the lag before both mucosal and systemic immune mechanisms are effective, and also the duration of immunity induced. Bukreyev and colleagues only report challenging the monkeys with SARS-CoV at 28 days after immunisation. Whilst the immunisation gave excellent protection from viral shedding at 28 days, the serum concentration of antibody in immunised animals was not greater at 28 days post-challenge than that measured in non-immunised animals. Further studies examining which mucosal immune responses are induced to SARS-CoV and which of these have any role in immune protection need to be done. Dose-response studies for both immunisation and challenge will also be needed before this model can be adopted for human trials.\n\nAs indicated by Bukreyev and colleagues, the approach they used of a replicating chimeric viral vector with protein inserts from a common human respiratory pathogen might be limited to infants and small children, because of interference from neutralising antibodies developed through natural infection. 10 Further investigations are warranted to establish a vector construct that would be effective in all age groups, especially because of the increased mortality rate from SARS in elderly people. 11 Possibilities for immuoprophylaxis and treatment of highrisk individuals who have become exposed to SARS-CoV are outlined in a Research letter, also in today's Lancet, by Jan ter Meulen and colleagues. These researchers describe preliminary experiments in the ferret, a species that can be naturally infected with SARS-CoV. They found that prophylactic treatment of infected animals with a human monoclonal antibody (directed against the cell-surface spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV) abrogated viral shedding from the pharynx, and prevented the development of macroscopic lung disease in infected animals. Extrapolation to human beings of a prophylactic treatment that reduced viral shedding and lung lesions would probably reduce transmission and the high morbidity associated with the disease.\n\nSuch a strategy, in combination with immunisation during a SARS outbreak, would offer potential treatment and prophylactic applications. However, before the monoclonal antibody approach suggested by ter Meulen can be applied to human beings, several further studies are required. Of particular importance are experiments relating to the efficacy of immunoprophylaxis and treatment in the presence of an established infection, appropriate doseresponse and safety studies, and, critically, study of the effect of circulating antibody on vaccine efficacy. 12 Bukreyev, ter Meulen, and their colleagues have shown that SARS can be effectively prevented by immunisation of the mucosa of the respiratory tract and immunoprophylaxis in animal models. Whilst further studies are required before these concepts can be applied to human beings, the findings provide exciting strategies for the prevention of disease in target communities and treatment of at-risk individuals."}
