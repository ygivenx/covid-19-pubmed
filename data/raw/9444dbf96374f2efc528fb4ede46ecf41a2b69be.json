{"title": "Characterisation of the transcriptome and proteome of SARS-CoV-2 using direct RNA sequencing and tandem mass spectrometry reveals evidence for a cell passage induced in-frame deletion in the spike glycoprotein that removes the furin-like cleavage site", "body": "Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a human pathogen at the end of 2019, the virus has spread globally, causing > 312 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 13,400 deaths as of the 22 nd March, 2020 1 . Although vaccines are under rapid development to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, little is known of either the immune correlates of protection or the ability of the virus to avoid the host immune response through mutation and recombination 2 .\n\nThe genome sequence was rapidly determined and revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to bat coronavirus RaTG13 and clusters with SARS-CoV, that emerged in 2002, in the genus Betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae 3, 4 . Based on homology to other known coronaviruses 3, 4 , the genome sequence was used for viral transcript prediction and the annotation of ORFs. Coronaviruses use a complex strategy to express their genetic information 5 , and transcription is initiated from defined (and sometimes cryptic) transcription associated sequences 6 . Similar, to other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 29.9 kB RNA genome contains two large ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1ab, predicted to be initially translated into the polyproteins, pp1a, and pp1ab that arises by ribosomal frameshifting ( Figure 1A ). The polyproteins are post-translationally processed by viral encoded proteases to produce 16 proteins that are conserved between coronaviruses and proposed to function in the synthesis of viral RNA and immune evasion 7 . During viral genome replication a set of \"nested\" subgenomic mRNAs are produced that are predicted to encode the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) and at least nine small accessory proteins, some of which are unique to SARS-CoV-2 3, 4 . The subgenomic mRNAs have a common 5' leader sequence and are 3' co-terminal with a polyA tail.\n\nThis feature is likely to be added by viral encoded proteins in the cytoplasm of an infected cell.\n\nRecently, the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome has been examined using direct RNAseq (dRNAseq) 8, 9 . Furthermore, a recent proteomic study showed that a number of the predicted viral proteins are produced in infected cells, but not all of the predicted viral proteins were detected 10 . We pioneered the use of combining transcriptomics and proteomics to study viral infections in vitro and in vivo, initially using the well characterised respiratory virus, adenovirus but also respiratory syncytial virus and highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses such as Hendra virus [11] [12] [13] . More recently we have focussed on the latest technologies to study the transcriptome of viruses, including direct RNA sequencing on nanopore devices using long read length sequencing. In particular, we developed a novel ORF-centric pipeline to analyse the very large amounts of transcriptomic data generated by this technique 14 . This pipeline was first used on data generated from adenovirus infected cells. The approach rapidly reproduced transcript maps that correlated highly with the previously described transcriptome maps of adenovirus which have been carefully curated over several decades.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs encoding the structural proteins and their expression profiles are of particular interest as the encoded proteins are likely targets of a protective immune response. The coronavirus S glycoprotein is present as a homotrimer, protruding from the surface of the virion. It is a key determinant of viral tropism and the major antigenic target 15, 16 . The S glycoprotein is a class I fusion . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

The coronavirus S glycoprotein of coronaviruses is primed for cell entry by host cell proteases that cleave the protein at one or more positions. Cleavage of a \"S1/S2\" site at the boundary of the S1 and S2 domains occurs for some coronaviruses whilst cleavage at a \"S2\" site is common to all coronaviruses and results in activation of a highly conserved fusion peptide immediately downstream of the S2 site [19] [20] [21] . Although the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein shares 97% identity with that of bat coronavirus RaTG13 22 , an important difference is the presence of a four amino acid insertion (681PRRA684) at the S1/S2 cleavage site that introduces a potential furin-like cleavage site 23, 24 . The furin cleavage site is also not found in other \"lineage B\" betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV, but has been detected in betacoronaviruses in other lineages, suggesting that this region has arisen during natural evolution 25 .\n\nHere we used a combined transcriptomics and proteomics approach to produce a correlated transcriptome and proteome map of SARS-CoV-2 in the African Green monkey kidney cell line Vero E6. This cell line is routinely used globally to propagate viruses from clinical samples as well as to generate stocks of virus for academic research, drug susceptibility testing and vaccine challenge studies. There was a close correlation between predicted viral transcriptome and proteome maps as well as novel transcripts that encoded for proteins detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Finally, evidence was gathered for an in-frame deletion inside the S glycoprotein that removed the proposed furin cleavage site.\n\nComplete characterisation of a novel and dangerous pathogen at a molecular level is highly desirable. Although analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome enables high confidence prediction of potential transcripts and ORFS, there is a pressing need to have the predictions confirmed and novel transcripts identified and assessed for biological significance and role in virulence and pathogenesis. At the same time, independent confirmation that viral transcripts were expressed was achieved by tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics. This provided direct observation of the whole range of viral proteins and helped resolve ambiguities in the transcriptomic data.\n\nFinally, identification of phosphorylation sites provided an invaluable list of therapeutic targets based on kinase inhibitors. Using proteomics informed by transcriptomics (PIT) 11 on duplicate infected cells offered a rapid and high resolution approach to these key molecular virology questions.\n\nLong read length sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION on polyA+ RNA from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 was used to characterise viral RNA species. This technique has recently been used to study herpes viruses, coronaviruses and adenovirus transcriptomes 14, 26, 27 . In total, 1,588,330 sequences were base called and passed QC, of those 527,401 were mapped to the BetaCoV/England/02/2020 genome using minimap2 (Figure 1b ). In addition, an average polyA tail length for each transcript was generated using nanopolish and this information was added to the analysis pipeline. A strict cut off of a 20 nt minimum polyA length was employed and 386,903 transcripts passed this test. Accurately determining the 5' end of direct RNAseq transcripts has been shown to be problematic 14, 27, 28 . The accepted model for coronavirus transcription (Figure 1a) proposes that all viral mRNAs have a common 5' end 29 and the analysis herein was further restricted to those transcripts that met this criterion which reduced the total number of identified full length subgenomic mRNA molecules to 72,124. Figure 1c illustrates a transcription map of those transcripts that start at the expected location and have a known ORF as the 5' most ORF. Transcripts that could express all of the predicted ORFs were present, including for the newly predicted ORF10 30 . However, only one transcript was detected and as previously suggested 8,9 the status of this as a genuine transcript needs careful further investigation. Moreover, non-canonical TRS joining events were detected leading to, for example, apparently bone fide subgenomic transcripts coding for ORF7b. this was also recently reported by Kim et al. 8 . The distribution of transcripts with a 5' UTR consistent with the model of coronavirus mRNA expression that would also code for a predicted protein are shown in Table 1 . Also reported are the average polyA tail lengths of each transcript group. These appeared to be shorter than most human eukaryotic transcripts but is consistent with recently reported findings for SARS-CoV- \n\nManual inspection of the transcripts aligned to the virus genome revealed a large number of reads that aligned to the gene encoding the S glycoprotein with a 24 nt deletion. This was predicted to result in a deletion of 9 aa, encompassing the proposed . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

To confirm this finding and examine if the deletion was present in the original stock samples at the PHE reference laboratory, the region was PCR amplified from the virus passaged at Bristol or from the original stock. These amplified fragments were sequenced using the Sanger method. This revealed that the Bristol stock was indeed a mixture of genomes but the original stock was solely wild type sequence. Subsequent examination of a very high quality dataset reported recently by Kim et al. 8 did not detect any evidence of similar significant deletions in the S glycoprotein in their data. However, their dataset contained a spontaneous deletion within the region of the genome coding for the E protein resulting in a 9aa in-frame deletion in almost two thirds of the mapped transcripts (Supplementary Figure 1) .\n\nTandem mass spectrometry was utilised to detect as many viral peptides and phosphopeptides as possible (Supplementary dataset 5). Table 2 illustrates the numbers of peptides found for each of the predicted ORFs. Notably, whilst most of the ORFs detected were also confirmed in the recent report by Bojkova et al. 10 , there were some differences. Whilst we could not detect peptides from ORF9b as described by Bojkova et al., peptides corresponding to the ORF9a protein were identified. This leaves only E, ORF7b and ORF10 to be detected by mass spectrometry. In addition, peptides unique to proteolytically processed components of the viral replicase polyprotein pp1ab; namely nsp4, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14 and nsp15 were .

However, a typical tryptic digest protocol would generate very large potentially undetectable peptides.\n\nAccordingly, samples were digested using chymotrypsin and the analysis repeated revealing a single peptide corresponding to the deleted version of the S-glycoprotein, but only when using a 5% false discovery threshold. However, this provided sufficient information to enable a targeted search. This identified nine Peptide Spectral Match's (PSMs) with high confidence (i.e. FDR 1%) that corroborated the expression of the deleted spike protein (Supplementary dataset 6).\n\nTranscriptomics and proteomics can be combined to provide unbiased insight into the proteome of viruses and higher eukaryotes 11, 12, 31 . The ORF centric pipeline was used to generate a list of possible ORFs which could be made by translating the first ORF present on every transcript sequenced. As before 14 , to overcome the inherent error prone nature of nanopore sequencing, the transcript was mapped to the viral genome and used the mapping information to create pseudo-transcripts based on the sequence of the viral genome.\n\nUsing this list of predicted proteins revealed a large number of novel peptides arising which could not be explained by the standard list of predicted viral proteins. In the majority of cases they appeared to be transcripts with rare and unusual structures . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

However, in some cases a large number of similar transcripts were supported by direct peptide evidence that these rearrangements are indeed translated. In particular multiple versions of the N protein with distinct small internal deletions were detected for which 20 transcripts that could encode for these proteins were also identified (Supplementary dataset 7). A schematic of such a deletion in the N protein is shown, indicating the peptide that was identified by tandem mass spectrometry to support the observed transcripts ( Figure 2c ).\n\nAllied to an analysis of viral peptides, the phosphorylation status of viral proteins was investigated as this could reveal potential targets for licenced kinase inhibitors.\n\nPhosphopeptides corresponding to locations on the N, M, ORF 3a, nsp3, nsp9, nsp12 and S-glycoprotein were detected ( Table 4 ). The presence of phosphorylation sites on the S glycoprotein has not been previously noted and may be of significance in terms of vaccines based on this protein, the location of these sites is illustrated ( Figure 3 ).\n\nThe location of the phosphorlaytion sites on the proteins listed is illustrated in Figure   4 and additional models of the phosphorylation sites on the N-terminal RNA binding domain of the N protein are shown in Figure 5 .

The coronavirus S glycoprotein is made as a larger precursor that must be primed by cleavage using host cell proteases to enable subsequent viral entry. For different coronaviruses, cleavage can occur at one or more sites (termed the S1/S2 and S2\u00b4 sites) depending on the amino acid consensus sequences present at each site and has major repercussions on host cell tropism and pathogenesis 19 . The SARS-CoV S glycoprotein has a single arginine residue at the S1/S2 site (Figure 2b ), that facilitates cleavage by a number of proteases including trypsin, cathepsin L and TMPRSS11D 32-34 and a consensus sequence for trypsin and/or elastin cleavage at the S2\u00b4 site 35, 36 . By comparison, SARS-CoV-2 has a four amino acid insertion (680SPRR683) in the S glycoprotein that results in the generation of a furin-like cleavage site (682RRAR685) at the S1/S2 boundary that is not present in other lineage B betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and the highly related bat coronavirus RaTG13 23 . Moreover, analysis of a cryo-EM structure of the S glycoprotein showed that the SPRR insertion creates a disordered solvent exposed loop 24 that protrudes from the trimer surface (Figure 3a ). It has been proposed that this region is more available to host cell proteases for processing 24 . The presence of a furin-like cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary results in cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein before viral exit from the cell, whereas the S glycoprotein of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, lacking a S1/S2 furin cleavage site, exit the cells with the S glycoprotein largely uncleaved, necessitating cleavage prior to or during cell entry 20, 37, 38 .\n\n.

However the sequence 694AY/T696 (numbering of undeleted S glycoprotein, cleavage shown by \"/\"; Figure 2b ) is still retained and has been identified as a second potential S1/S2 protease cleavage site for SARS-CoV downstream of the basic Arg667 residue 23 suggesting that either the deleted SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein could be cleaved at this site or only use the S2\u00b4 site for cleavage. Recently pseudoviruses expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein and the corresponding S glycoprotein with the furin cleavage site removed at the S1/S2 boundary (residues 680SPRR683 removed) were made and their ability to mediate entry to Vero E6 and BHK-21 cells expressing hACE2 compared 33 In addition to the S glycoprotein deletion we were also able to find an additional significant deletion, in high quality data recently deposited by Kim et al. 8 \n\nExtraction and sequencing was done as previously described 14 . Briefly, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol\u2122 reagent (#15596026, Ambion) and the RNA extracted as per the manufacturer's recommendations but with 3 x 70% ethanol washes. After resuspension in RNAse-free water the RNA was polyA enriched and sequenced immediately using SQK-RNA002 kits and MIN106D R9 version flow cells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). \n\nTo cope with the very wide range of transcripts, and to enable grouping of transcripts into classes, our previously described ORF centric data analysis pipeline was utilised 14 . The transcripts were mapped to the viral genome with minimap2 and the mapping data was used to identify transcription regulatory sequences (TRS), the sites where the transcript meets the poly A tail at the end of the genome and junction sites which the software refers to as splice acceptor/donor sites as it was originally used to describe spliced adenovirus transcripts. This script produces tables indicating where on the genome and how often in the data each junction occurs. Subsequently, nearby events are grouped together for simplicity of analysis. Once this is complete, the software then assigns each transcript to a \"transcript group\" depending on its pattern of TRS, junction sites and poly A locations and counts how many transcripts belong to each transcript group.

After washing with 0.5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, peptides were resolved on a 250 mm \u00d7 75 \u03bcm Acclaim PepMap C18 reverse phase analytical column (Thermo Scientific) over a 150 min organic gradient, using 7 gradient segments (1-3% solvent B over 1 min, 3-15% B over 58 min, 15-32%B over 58 min, 32-40%B over 5 min, 40-90%B over 1 min, held at 90%B for 6 min and then reduced to 1%B over 1 min) with a flow rate of 300 nl min \u22121 . Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid and Solvent B was aqueous 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were ionized by nanoelectrospray ionization at 2.2 kV using a stainless-steel emitter with an internal diameter of 30 \u03bcm (Thermo Scientific) and a capillary temperature of 250 \u00b0C.\n\nAll spectra were acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur 4.1 software (Thermo Scientific) and operated in datadependent acquisition mode. FTMS1 spectra were collected at a resolution of 120 000 over a scan range (m/z) of 375-1550 (for tryptic peptides) or 325-1500 (for chymotryptic peptides), with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 4E5 and a max injection time of 50ms. Precursors were filtered according to charge state (to include charge states 2-7), with monoisotopic peak determination set to peptide and using an intensity threshold of 1E3. Previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a dynamic window (40s +/-10ppm). The MS2 precursors were isolated with a quadrupole isolation window of 0.7m/z. ITMS2 spectra were collected with an AGC target of 2E4, max injection time of 35ms and HCD collision energy of 30 %.\n\n. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

However, there were changes to the acquisition workflow. Precursors were filtered according to charge state (to include charge state 2) and previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a dynamic window (2s +/-10ppm). A targeted mass was specified with m/z 712.3759 and z=2.\n\nSix 30 \u00b5l aliquots of the sample were separated by SDS-PAGE until the dye front had moved approximately 1cm into the separating gel. Each gel lane was excised as a single slice and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion as above but using 1.5 \u00b5g trypsin per slice. The resulting peptides were subjected to TiO2-based phosphopeptide enrichment according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The flow-through and washes from the TiO2-based enrichment were then subjected to FeNTA-based phosphopeptide enrichment, again according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The phospho-enriched samples were evaporated to dryness and then resuspended in 1% formic acid prior to analysis by nano-LC MSMS using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) as above.\n\nThe raw data files were processed using Proteome Discoverer software v2. Overview of nanopore inferred transcriptome. Part a illustrates the classical transcription map of coronaviruses adapted for SARS-CoV-2. The genome is itself an mRNA which when translated gives rise to polyproteins pp1a and, upon a ribosomal frameshift, pp1ab. These polyproteins are proteolytically processed down to a range of non-structural proteins termed nsp1-16 some of which will form the viral replication-transcription complex (RTC). The RTC then generates subgenomic mRNA which canonically contains a sequence present at the 5' end of the viral genome known as the Transcription Regulating Sequence -Leader (TRS -L) linked by discontinuous transcription to one of several similar sequences downstream of pp1ab. In this manner the remaining ORFS on the viral genome are placed 5' most on the subgenomic mRNA and are subsequently translated. Part b shows the total read depth across the viral genome for all reads, the maximum read depth was 511,129. Part c illustrates the structure of dominant transcript coding for each of the identified ORFS. Only transcripts that starts inside the leader TRS sequence are considered here. The black rectangles represent mapped nucleotides and the arrowed lines represent regions of the genome that are skipped. To the right is noted the 5' most ORF is that the transcript would code for, in parenthesis we note how many individual transcripts were observed.\n\nDeletions within the viral mRNA in the S glycoprotein and N In (a) is shown the read depth over the region deleted in the S glycoprotein together with information on the sequence in the region and the translation in all three frames. (b) is a clustal alignment of three proteins over this region, wild type SARS-CoV, wild type SARS-CoV-2, the artificially deleted version of the wild type SARS-Cov_2 S glycoprotein as reported in Walls et al. and finally the predicted sequence of the deleted protein described here. Highlighted in yellow is the sequence of the unique peptide generated by chymotrypsin digest of the protein which was identified by tandem mass spectrometry. (c) illustrates a similar examination of a proposed deletion in the N protein predicted by multiple aligned transcripts and subsequently identified in trypsin digested protein samples as indicated by the unique peptide highlighted in yellow.\n\nA space filled model of the wild type SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein in a trimeric form using the sequence of a) the native or b) spike deletant virus, in which the aa's 679NSPRRARSV687 have been replaced with Ile.

The loop containing the furin cleavage site (or the shortened loop in the deleted version in b) is indicated in red.
