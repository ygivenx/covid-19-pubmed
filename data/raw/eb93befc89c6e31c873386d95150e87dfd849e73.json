{"title": "Synergistic effects of ATP and RNA binding to human DEAD-box protein DDX1", "body": "Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were used to check for binding of DDX1 to different RNA sequences ( Figure S5 ). Binding to a 10mer polyA, a 10mer polyU and a 13mer RNA of mixed sequence (1) was tested by using 3'-Carboxyfluorescein ( KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 ) for 60 min. FAM-labelled RNA was visualized using the ImaGo system (B&L systems) with maximal excitation at 302 nm. This is not the optimal excitation wavelength for the FAM-label; however, the FAM-label still absorbed sufficient light to give a stable emission signal that could be easily detected. Subsequently, proteins were stained with Coomassie Instant Blue \u00ae .\n\nNo difference in binding could be observed between different RNA species with the FAM label at the 5'-or 3'-end.\n\nAs described in the main-text, transient kinetics were recorded on a BioLogic SFM-400 stoppedflow instrument (BioLogic Science instruments) thermostated to 298 K and mant-fluorescence was excited at 356 nm and emission was detected with a 420 nm cut-off filter (420FG03-25, LOT Oriel Group). All measurements were performed in titration buffer and traces were recorded in triplicates and averaged. To measure off-rates for mantdADP, chase experiments were performed in which an equilibrated solution of 0.5 \u00b5M mantdADP and 0.5 \u00b5M DDX1 was rapidly mixed with 250 or 500 \u00b5M of unlabeled ADP. These chase experiments were also performed in the presence of 40 \u00b5M 10mer polyA RNA. Moreover the same chase experiments were performed with the DDX1 R605A-R608A mutant. Traces were fitted to a single exponential function that gave the rate constant for mantdADP dissociation. To obtain data for the release of ADP from DDX1, different chase experiments were performed, in which an equilibrated solution of 0.5 \u00b5M ADP and 0.5 \u00b5M DDX1 was rapidly mixed with 5 or 10 \u00b5M of mantdADP. In contrast to the previous displacement experiments, we observed an increase in signal due to mantdADP binding that was fitted by single exponential function to obtain a rate constant for ADP dissociation.\n\nThe coupled steady-state ATPase assay was performed as described in the main-text. Michaelis-Menten kinetics of DDX1 WT were recorded by incubating 1 \u00b5M DDX1 with 6 mM ATP-MgCl 2 Figure 5 ). DDX1 is represented by H in the equations. Shown is the script file for the measurements with ATP, the script file for the AppNHp measurements is the same, only that the ATP data is replaced by the AppNHp data.
