The disease rapidly spread throughout China and elsewhere, becoming a global health emergency (WHO, 2020) . The mental health of medical and nursing staff has been greatly challenged during the immediate wake of the viral epidemic (Chong et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2009) . In battling the sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), psychological distress among medical staff appeared gradually: fear and anxiety appeared immediately and decreased in the early stages of the epidemic, but depression, psychophysiological symptoms and posttraumatic stress symptoms appeared later and lasted for a long time, leading to profound impacts (Chong et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2009) . Being isolated, working in high-risk positions, and having contact with infected people are common causes of trauma (Wu et al., 2009; Maunder et al., 2003) . These factors may have impacted medical and nursing staff in Wuhan, leading to mental health problems.\n\nThe experience of medical staff responding to SARS shows that the effects on medical staff members' mental health have not only short-term but also long-term impacts and that the value of effective support and training is meaningful (Maunder et al., 2006) . Efficient and comprehensive actions should be taken in a timely fashion to protect the mental health of medical staff. The Chinese government has made various efforts to reduce the pressure on medical and nursing staff in China, such as sending more medical and nursing staff to reduce work intensity, adopting strict infection control, providing personal protective equipment and offering practical guidance.\n\nBased on previous responses to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), medical staff tend to believe that such measures help protect their mental health (Khalid et al., 2016) . In addition, to reduce the psychological damage of COVID-19 among medical and nursing staff, mental health workers in Wuhan are also taking action by establishing psychological intervention teams and providing a range of psychological services, including providing psychological brochures, counseling and psychotherapy (Kang et al., 2020) . At the same time, television news and online media are also disseminating information about coping strategies for psychological self-help.\n\nHowever, evidence-based mental health services are preferable, and it is necessary to assess the quality of mental health services (Aarons et al., 2012) . Therefore, we explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan, the efficacy of the psychological care accessed, and their psychological care needs.\n\nWe recruited doctors or nurses working in Wuhan to participate in this survey from January 29, 2020, to February 4, 2020.\n\nHospital of Wuhan University (WDRY2020-K004). Data were collected through Wenjuanxing (www.wjx.cn) with an anonymous, self-rated questionnaire that was distributed to all workstations over the internet. All subjects provided informed consent electronically prior to registration. The informed consent page presented two options (yes/no). Only subjects who chose yes were taken to the questionnaire page, and subjects could quit the process at any time.\n\nThe questionnaire consists of six parts: basic demographic data, mental health assessment, risks of direct and indirect exposure to COVID-19, mental healthcare services accessed, psychological needs, and self-perceived health status compared to that before the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nBasic demographic data include occupation (doctor or nurse), gender (male or female), age (years), marital status (unmarried, married or divorced), educational level (undergraduate or lower, postgraduate or higher), technical title (primary, intermediate, or senior), and department (divided into high-exposure departments and non-high-exposure departments according to the possibility of exposure to confirmed patients; high-exposure departments included the fever clinic, emergency department, general isolation ward, and intensive care unit).\n\nWe used four scales to assess the mental health status of medical and nursing staff.\n\nThe 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were used to evaluate depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress, respectively. The PHQ-9 is a self-report measure used to assess the severity of depression, with the total scores categorized as follows: minimal/no depression (0-4), mild depression (5-9), moderate depression (10-14), or severe depression (15-21) (Kocalevent et al., 2013) . The GAD-7 is a self-rated scale to evaluate the severity of anxiety and has good reliability and validity. The total scores are categorized as follows: minimal/no anxiety (0-4), mild anxiety (5-9), moderate anxiety (10-14), or severe anxiety (15-21) (L\u00f6we et al., 2008) . The ISI is a measure of insomnia severity that has been shown to be valid and reliable. The total scores are categorized as follows: normal (0-7), subthreshold (8-14), moderate insomnia (15-21), or severe insomnia (22-28) (Morin et al., 2011) . The IES-R is a self-report measure used to assess the response to a specific stressful life event and has extensive reliability and validity. The event used for this questionnaire was the occurrence of 2.2.6. Self-perceived health status Health status was determined by asking participants to compare their current health status to their health status before the outbreak of COVID-19: How do you perceive your current health status compared to your health status before the outbreak? (answer options included getting better, almost unchanged, worse, or much worse).\n\nData analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 23.0) and Mplus (version 7.4). Descriptive analysis was used to describe the general data and currently accessed psychological services. For count data, frequencies and percentages were used. The k-means clustering method was used to cluster the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R scores (Ball, 1967) . With the Euclidean square root distance as the measurement index, the patients were divided into 4 groups by the Ward method. According to this grouping, exposure to COVID-19 and the current state of mental healthcare services were compared. The chi-square test was used to compare the data for different categorical variables. A structural equation model (SEM) was constructed via Mplus to explore the relationship among the four components, namely, exposure, accessed mental healthcare services, mental health status (PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R scores) and self-perceived health status compared to that before the COVID-19 outbreak. The estimation method used weighted least squares with mean and variance adjustment test statistics (Distefano and Morgan, 2014) . We used a Monte Carlo method with 1000 guided resamplings to construct a confidence interval for the estimation effect (Bauer et al., 2006) . In SEM, several criteria, such as root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) values lower than 0.08 and comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) values greater than 0.90, indicate acceptable models (Hu and Bentler, 1998) . P values less than 0.05 indicated that a difference was statistically significant.\n\nIn total, 994 participants, including 183 (18.4%) doctors and 811 (81.6%) nurses, completed the survey. A total of 31.1% worked in high-risk departments. The participants tended to be female (85.5%), be aged 25 to 40 years (63.4%), be married (56.9%), have an educational level of undergraduate or less (85%), and have a junior technical title (66.3%), as shown in Table 1 .\n\nOf all participants, 36.3% had received psychological materials, 50.4% had obtained psychological resources available through media, and 17.5% had participated in group psychological counseling, as shown in Table 2 .\n\nAccording to the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R scores, the 994 participants were divided into 4 groups. Thirty-six percent of the medical staff had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4, GAD-7: 1.5, ISI: 2.8, IES-R: 6.1), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4, GAD-7: 4.6, ISI: 6.0, IES-R: 22.9), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0, GAD-7: 8.2, ISI: 10.4, IES-R: 39.9), and 6.2% had severe disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 15.1, GAD-7: 15.1, ISI: 15.6, IES-R: 60.0). There were significant differences in the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R scores among the four groups, as shown in Table 3 .\n\nIn contrast, there were no significant differences in demographic data among the four groups, as shown in Table 4 .\n\nFor medical and nursing staff, exposure to people around them who were infected varied among the different groups. The group with subthreshold mental health disturbances had contact with fewer people confirmed or suspected to be infected with the virus. Each group with a higher level of distress had a more extensive scope of exposure. There were also significant differences in mental healthcare services among the four groups; those with severe disturbances had accessed fewer psychological materials and psychological resources available through media. In addition, the perception of current health status compared to that before the outbreak of was also different among the groups, as shown in Table 5 .\n\nWe established an SEM of the associations between the four areas. First, exposure as a risk factor for mental health, including the confirmed diagnosis of patients, the participants' themselves, family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and coresidents with suspected symptoms, was analyzed in the previous step. Second, the mental healthcare services accessed consisted of psychological materials and psychological resources available through media. Third, mental health consisted of the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R scores. The fourth area was the subjective feelings of the staff regarding whether their physical conditions were worse than before the epidemic. Figure 1 and Table 6. 3.6. Psychological care needs of medical and nursing staff In terms of the content of interest, namely, psychological care, medical and nursing staff with subthreshold disturbances most wanted to obtain skills to help alleviate others' psychological distress, whereas other medical and nursing staff most wanted to obtain self-help skills. Medical and nursing staff with higher levels of mental health problems were more interested in skills for self-rescue and showed more urgent desires to seek help from psychotherapists and psychiatrists. Medical and nursing staff differed in terms of how they wanted to obtain services based on their levels of mental health problems. Medical and nursing staff with subthreshold and mild disturbances preferred to obtain such services from media sources, while staff with heavier burdens wanted to seek services directly from professionals. Apart from medical and nursing staff with subthreshold disturbances who did not think they needed help from others, the other workers saw a greater need to obtain help from professionals than from close family and friends. The results are shown in Table 7 .\n\nThis is the first mental health investigation in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan, China that aims, in part, to explore the demand for mental healthcare services in this context. When cities are struck by deadly, large-scale disasters of various types, the characteristics of mental health problems that arise can differ across different periods (Shioyama et al., 2000) . We therefore chose to survey a set of people (health care providers) in the discrete window of time soon after the initiation of a chaotic event (the outbreak of coronavirus infections). To conduct a comprehensive analysis, we used multiple different scales to evaluate the mental health of medical staff.\n\nOur study has revealed the limits in the availability of mental healthcare services provided by psychologists and psychiatrists and thus the limits in access points for psychological care for distressed individuals, including less personalized sources of support such as publication-style psychological materials and psychological resources available from media. These latter methods can nonetheless contribute positively to alleviating mental health problems and physical discomfort caused by risk factors such as the exposure of close contacts to COVID-19. Such exposure is known to be mentally injurious in epidemic settings: when the SARS epidemic hit, not only did the direct exposure of the work environment affect the mental health of medical staff, but the infection of friends or close relatives generated psychological trauma (Wu et al.,\n\nWe found that subthreshold and mild mental health disturbances accounted for a large proportion of disturbances. People with such levels of disturbances may be more likely than those with more severe disturbances to take action and be motivated to learn the necessary skills and to adapt in productive ways to respond to diverse challenges. These skills have been shown in previous retrospective studies to be protective for later mental health (Maunder et al., 2006) . In addition, we note that people with subthreshold and mild mental health disturbances want to find ways to better help others, which is beneficial for health care teams. In terms of physiology, positive coping has been seen to increase immune function when victimized subjects report high mental demands, leading to a better state of response (Sakami et al., 2004) . However, there are negative consequences of stimulation caused by pressure, as acute psychological stress is known to activate the sympathetic adrenal medulla system and hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal axis, and this two-component stress response impacts physical and mental health and has disease consequences (Turner et al., 2020) . In summary, continuous mental healthcare services are necessary even for subthreshold and mild psychological reactions during this epidemic to attenuate the possibility of escalating complications.\n\nMultiple features were found for the group of untreated clinical personnel who had serious psychological problems. First, compared to less severely affected groups, they had accessed fewer printed psychological advice materials (e.g., office brochures) and had accessed less psychological guidance publicized through digital media. Second, they were more likely to desire personalized, one-on-one counseling as a therapy option. One might speculate a cause-and-effect relationship wherein more frequent exposure of the other groups to the noted materials in some way protected them from reaching the most severely impacted category, but our cross-sectional results are, by nature, correlational. This study limitation does not detract, however, from the importance of widely implementing prevention and monitoring strategies; mildly to moderately impacted personnel expressed interest in having access to psychological guidance materials, which provides evidence of the importance of prevention strategies.\n\nThe number of people suffering from mental health impacts after a major event is often greater than the number of people who are physically injured, and mental health effects may last longer. Nonetheless, mental health attracts far fewer personnel for There is a need to better recognize mental health needs as an important component of mobilizing a large-scale therapeutic response to sudden city-scale crisis scenarios. A large rapid response team in crisis situations should include mental healthcare workers. Local medical and nursing staff at the epicenter of a crisis are pivotal to the overall response, and care for these caregivers -whether through face-to-face counseling or comparable support through digital platforms such as cell phone interfaces -is essential in efforts to extend their immediate efficiency and to better protect their mental health in the long term.\n\nOur research also has some limitations. First, compared with face-to-face interviews, self-reporting has certain limitations. Second, the study is cross-sectional and does not track the efficacy of psychological services. Due to changes in posttraumatic mental health, dynamic observation is necessary. A randomized prospective study could better determine correlation and causation. Third, a larger sample size is needed to verify the results.\n\nIn summary, the results demonstrate that a strikingly large portion of health care providers in virus-plagued Wuhan are suffering from mental health disturbances.\n\nThey would benefit from greater availability of personalized mental health care from psychotherapists and psychiatrists, wherein different mental health groups could focus on providing specialized mental healthcare services. Among the steps needed to better prepare for future infectious disease outbreaks would be a greater investment in the mental health tools in society's medical arsenal to protect and care for future medical and nursing staff who find themselves unexpectedly on the dangerous front lines of disease response. \n\nWe declare no competing interests. \n\n(5.8)\n\n(4.8)\n\n(5.7) \n\n(1.5)\n\nThe majority of medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan reported experiencing mental health disturbances in the immediate outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nDirect and indirect exposure to COVID-19 affects the mental health of medical and nursing staff.\n\nPsychological materials (such as books on mental health) and psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods) protect the health of current medical staff.\n\nFurther interventions with an emphasis on providing an appropriate level of ongoing care for medical and nursing staff with different levels of distress are urgent."}
