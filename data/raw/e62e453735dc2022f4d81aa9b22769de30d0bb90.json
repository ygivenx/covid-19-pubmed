{"title": "When will the battle against novel coronavirus end in Wuhan: a SEIR modeling analysis", "body": "Wuhan is the largest city in central China with a total population of more than 11 million [1] . The epidemic of 2019-nCoV pneumonia has been raging in the whole country, especially in Hubei province for nearly a month. In late December 2019, 67 cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were reported in Wuhan [2] . In order to prevent the further spread of 2019-nCoV, Wuhan began to close the city from 10:00 on January 23, banning all vehicles from entering and leaving the city. Tens of thousands of medical staff, soldiers and people from all walks of life have been involved in the campaign.\n\nThe spread of the epidemic has caused a huge threat to people's health and life safety, at the same time, it has a serious impact on China's social life and national economy.\n\nBy February 15, 2020, the total number of confirmed cases has reached 37914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123 in Wuhan, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China [3] . With the increase of medical staff from all over the country, the opening of several large novel hospitals, and the adoption of anti epidemic measures, more patients can get efficient and timely treatment. The number of confirmed cases increased sharply on February 12 and 13, while the total number of suspected cases decreased gradually [3] .\n\nPeople are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In order to help the public to understand the future trend of the epidemic, we analyzed the epidemic dynamic and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan city by using the SEIR modeling method based on the actual data and published references.\n\nThe SEIR model is a classical epidemic model for the flows of people between four states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and recovery (R). Each of those variables represents the number of people in those groups. The relationship among the four groups is elucidated in Figure 1 , where \u03b21 is the probability of S to E after I contacts S, \u03b31 is the probability of E to I, and \u03b32 is the probability of I to R. Since 2019-nCoV is also infectious in the incubation period, we introduced parameter \u03b22 here to represent the probability of S to E after E contact S. We used the \"susceptible exposedinfected -recovered\" model [4] to describe the prevalent characteristics of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan .\n\nThis is an ordinary differential equation model, described by the following equations:\n\nAmong which, S(t) \u3001E(t)\u3001I(t) and R(t) represent the number of people in the group of the susceptible, the exposed, the infected and the recovered on the day t, respectively. N is the total number of possible contact people, which is assumed to be fixed and N = S +E + I + R.\n\nThe simulation used the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm [5] to solve it numerically, with a step size fixed at 0.01 for R 0 , and at 0.1 for TE and TI.\n\n2\u3001Estimation of parameters for the model All rights reserved.

We used the data of 22 days from January 22 to February 12 when Wuhan city was shut down and all the public transportation was suspended.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The first stage is from January 23 to February 7, and the second stage is from February 8 to February 12. During the second stage, Wuhan city took a number of measures, including timely diagnosis, timely treatment and effective isolation of the infected population, which will have an important impact on the parameters of the model. To establish the model, we firstly estimated the parameters of the susceptible (S), the exposed (E), the infected (I) and the recovery(R) based on the latest data issued on S=N\u2500I, in which S is the number of the susceptible and I is the number of the infected.

The results showed that, at the time when Wuhan was closed, the number of initially infected individuals was I 0 = 425, the number of initially exposed individuals was E 0 = 426, and the number of initially recovered patients was R 0 = 28.\n\nNext, we separated the data into two stages: January 22-February 7 and February 8- days, and the incubation period is about 3 days, which is close to the data (Interquartile range: 3.0-7.2) estimated in the reference [8] . The propagation base R 0 of this study is 1.44, which is significantly lower than the R 0 estimated by other papers before the closure of Wuhan [9] [10] [11] .\n\nFig2.

Due to the rapid change of the epidemic situation and the closure of Wuhan on January 23, many parameters related to the model have also changed, which affect the applicability and reliability of the model. The infection time index (TI) obtained in this study was higher than that of SARS [12] and MERS [13] , but lower than that of 2019-nCoV in literatures [14] reported earlier.\n\nThis result may be related to the sudden outbreak of the epidemic, the lack of medical resources for early response, and the failure of timely diagnosis and treatment of infected patients. A large number of mild patients and asymptomatic virus carriers were not isolated in time. The incubation period (TE) is about 3 days, which is close to the data in the reference [14] .\n\nAccording to the latest reported data, the cumulative number of people infected on February 13 and 14 was 35991 and 37914 respectively, which is close to the number predicted by our estimation (Table 2 ). According to this study, the number of infected people will reach the peak in February 19 at about 45000 infected individuals.\n\nWith the implementation of more follow-up measures, including strict restrictions on people going out, accelerating the treatment of infected individuals, and clinical trials of new drugs, the development of 2019-nCoV epidemic in Wuhan will be effectively controlled, and the number of infected individuals will gradually decrease. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed.\n\nThe ethical approval or individual consent was not applicable.
