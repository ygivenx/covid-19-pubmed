{"title": "", "body": "Subra Kugathasan* Childhood diarrhea is one of the most common reasons for a sick visit to a health care provider. In the United States, 220,000 hospital admissions occur annually because of diarrhea; these account for 10% of all hospitalizations of young children. About 300 deaths occur from diarrhea and its complications each year in the United States; worldwide, an estimated 5 to 18 million children die each year from diarrhea.\n\nIt is important to distinguish acute from chronic diarrhea because the causes and differential diagnoses are very different. Acute diarrhea is usually a self-limited illness that lasts for 2 weeks or less. Chronic diarrhea is defined as diarrhea that persists for more than 2 or 3 weeks. Diarrhea in adults is usually defined as a stool volume output of more than 200 mL each day. In children, a stool output that exceeds 10 mL/kg/day is considered diarrhea. A more practical definition is that diarrhea is present when stools increase in frequency, fluidity (water content), or volume, in comparison with the previously established \"normal\" pattern. Wide variability exists in normal bowel patterns from child to child; age-related changes occur. Breast-fed infants may pass a loose or seedy stool with each nursing. In older infants or children, stool frequency may vary from several times each day to once every several days. The differential diagnosis of acute and chronic childhood diarrhea is presented in \n\nDiarrhea is often subdivided into four main categories: secretory, osmotic, increased motility, and inflammation. In simple terms, diarrhea results from a relative increase in secretion, a decrease in intestinal absorption, or both. Differentiating between osmotic and secretary diarrhea is clinically necessary (Tables 15-3 and 15-4). The mechanisms of diarrhea among the various causes are illustrated in Table 15 -5.\n\nViral agents account for most cases of acute gastroenteritis (Table 15-6;  see Table 15 -2). Stools are watery and do not usually contain white or red blood cells. A short incubation period of 2 to 5 days is followed by inflammation of the intestinal lamina propria and varying degrees of villous and microvillous shortening. There are often contacts with diarrhea. Systemic features, such as low-grade fever, vomiting, and respiratory symptoms often accompany the diarrhea. Infants in particular are susceptible to dehydration.\n\nRotavirus is the most common cause of diarrhea in childhood. Person-to-person transmission of this virus occurs via the fecal-oral route, although respiratory transmission has been suggested. Household spread, transmission at day care centers and schools, and nosocomial infection are common. Children younger than 2 years are most susceptible, but infection occurs in all age groups. In temperate climates, the disease displays seasonal distribution: Infection is most common during the cooler months (November through May). Affected children are usually ill for 2 to 8 days, after a 1-to 3-day incubation period. Symptomatic infections are common in newborns and older individuals. Acute diarrhea in the young child, occurring during winter and associated with vomiting, low-grade fever, and dehydration, probably represents rotavirus infection. Confirmation may be obtained with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and latex agglutination assays for rotavirus detection in stool. Chronic infection does not occur in immune-competent hosts, but after severe infection, the small intestinal mucosa may require 3 to 8 weeks to recover its absorptive ability; this possibly leads to a chronic, postinfectious enteropathy in some individuals.\n\nNorwalk agent is the second most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children. Affected children are older than those with rotavirus infection; a seasonal pattern of infection is not consistently recognized. In addition to diarrhea and vomiting, headache, myalgia, and malaise are common. Epidemic outbreaks of infection are common, although sporadic cases also occur. Diagnostic tests for the Norwalk virus are not available.\n\nNumerous other viruses are associated with childhood diarrhea (see Tables 15-2 and 15-6), the clinical features of which may be indistinguishable from those of the more common viral agents. Viral gastroenteritis is best managed with oral electrolyte-carbohydrate rehydration solutions. In the absence of severe dehydration (shock, tachycardia, hypotension [ Table 15 -7]), most infants can be treated with 24 hours of oral rehydration therapy, followed by reinitiation of standard formula. If unstable vital signs or refractory emesis is present, intravenous fluid therapy is indicated. Nonetheless, most infants with emesis can be treated with smallvolume, frequent oral rehydration solution feeding; those in shock can be resuscitated parenterally and then given oral rehydration solutions.\n\nBacterial infections of the intestine cause diarrhea through a variety of mechanisms (Table 15-8; see Table 15 -5): direct invasion of intestinal mucosa, followed by intraepithelial cell multiplication or invasion of lamina propria; production of cytotoxin, which disrupts cell function; production of enterotoxin, which alters cellular electrolyte and water balance; and adherence to the mucosal surface, with resultant flattening of the microvilli and disruption of normal cell functioning. The epidemiology of common bacterial pathogens is noted in Table 15 -2. Differentiation from viral causes of diarrhea may be difficult (Table 15-9) .\n\nSalmonella infection is estimated to cause 1 to 2 million annual gastrointestinal infections in the United States. The attack rate is highest in infancy; the incidence of symptomatic infections is lower in patients older than 6 years. Salmonella infection may cause an asymptomatic intestinal carrier state (rare in children), enterocolitis with diarrhea, or bacteremia without gastrointestinal manifestations but with subsequent local infections (meningitis, osteomyelitis). Salmonella infection is usually spread through contaminated water supplies or food (meat, chicken, eggs, raw milk, and fresh produce). Most infections in the United States are sporadic rather than epidemic. Although an infected food handler may contaminate food sources, the farm animals are often infected. Cats, turtles, lizards, snakes, and iguanas may also harbor Salmonella organisms. Outbreaks may occur among institutionalized children; outbreaks in day care centers are rare.\n\nAfter a 12-to 72-hour incubation period, gastroenteritis develops and is characterized by the sudden onset of diarrhea, abdominal cramps and tenderness, and fever. The diarrhea is watery, with stools containing polymorphonuclear leukocytes and, on occasion, blood. Symptoms slowly resolve within 3 to 5 days. Excretion of the organism may persist for several weeks. The peripheral blood white blood cell count is usually normal. The organism is readily isolated from stool culture or rectal swab. Owing to the increased risk of developing the carrier state, antimicrobial therapy of uncomplicated cases of Salmonella infection is not recommended. Treatment is indicated for children at increased risk for bacteremia and disseminated disease, including infants younger than 3 months and immunocompromised patients (Table 15-10) . For others, treatment is directed at maintaining adequate hydration. Treatment with antiperistaltic drugs is thought to be contraindicated in cases of invasive bacterial dysentery because it may lead to more severe symptoms or intestinal perforation.\n\nGastrointestinal Disorders \n\nMost Shigella infections in the United States occur in young children, 1 to 4 years of age, with a peak incidence in late summer and early autumn. The organism is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, most often by hands. It may also be the most common bacterial cause of outbreaks of diarrhea in day care settings. During a 12-to 72-hour incubation period, patients may develop a nonspecific prodrome characterized by fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting. A colitis affecting predominantly the rectosigmoid region develops and results in abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea. In more severe infections (bacillary dysentery), blood and mucus are passed in small, very frequent stools. High fever in young infants may induce a febrile seizure (see Chapter 39). The association of seizures with shigellosis was attributed to neurotoxic effect of Shigella toxin. The seizures may represent a subgroup of common febrile seizures. Stool culture provides the only definitive means of differentiating this organism from other pathogens. Unlike Salmonella-caused gastroenteritis, antibiotic treatment is indicated in shigellosis because it shortens the duration of diarrhea, prevents further spread of the organism, and decreases the secondary attack rate, inasmuch as humans provide the only reservoir for this organism (see Table 15 -10).\n\nMany animal species, including poultry, farm animals, and household pets, serve as reservoirs of Campylobacter jejuni. Transmission occurs through ingestion of contaminated food, especially undercooked food, and through person-to-person spread via the fecal-oral route. The disease is common in infants and adolescents. Day care and college outbreaks have been reported. Asymptomatic carriage is uncommon. Campylobacter infection may cause disease ranging from mild diarrhea to frank dysentery. The organism causes diffuse, invasive enteritis that includes the ileum and colon. Fever, cramping, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea are characteristic and may mimic those of acute appendicitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fever and diarrhea usually resolve after 5 to 7 days; prolonged illness or relapse occasionally occurs. Campylobacter infection is also known to cause meningitis, abscesses, pancreatitis, and pneumonia. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome has been reported after Campylobacter infection. Culture of the organism from fecal specimens is routinely accomplished in many laboratories. Supportive treatment alone is sufficient in most cases. Treatment is recommended only in severe cases. Antibiotic treatment eradicates the organism from the stool and may therefore prevent person-to-person spread; it may also shorten the period of clinical illness if it is started early in the disease process.\n\nSection Three Gastrointestinal Disorders \n\nYersinia infection may cause various clinical syndromes, including gastroenteritis, mesenteric adenitis, pseudoappendicitis, and postinfectious reactive arthritis. The organism is present in animals and may be spread to humans by consumption of undercooked meat (especially pork), unpasteurized milk, and other contaminated foods. Person-to-person spread also occurs. Young children are particularly susceptible to disease, and the frequency of infections is increased during the summer months. The organisms may be cultured from rectal swab or stool specimens, but selective media are required, and the organism may not be identified for several weeks. The microbiology laboratory should be notified if Yersinia infection is suspected. Antibiotics are not effective in alleviating symptoms of Yersinia infection or in shortening the period of its excretion. Patients with extraintestinal infection Table 15 -10). Most Yersinia organisms are susceptible to aminoglycosides, third-generation cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\n\nAlthough E. coli is the predominant normal flora in the colon, some strains are pathogenic. Diarrhea caused by E. coli can be watery, inflammatory, or bloody, depending on the strain involved (Table 15 -11). These diarrheogenic E. coli strains are currently classified, on the basis of serogrouping or pathogenic mechanisms, into five major groups: (1) Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), an important cause of diarrhea in infants;\n\n(2) enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), a cause of diarrhea in infants and a cause of traveler's diarrhea;\n\n(3) enteroinvasive E. coli, which causes watery ETEC-like illness or, less commonly, a dysentery-like illness; (4) enterohemorrhagic E. coli, which causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); and (5) enteroaggregative E. coli, which along with EPEC has been implicated as a cause of persistent diarrhea. Enteric infections with E. coli are acquired via the fecaloral route. Enterohemorrhagic strains are the only diarrhea-producing E. coli strains that are common in the United States and have been associated with foodborne epidemic outbreaks transmitted by undercooked meat. EPEC is a well-established cause of infantile diarrhea, especially in developing countries. Asymptomatic carriage is common. At least two separate mechanisms are responsible for diarrhea: adherence to intestinal epithelial cells, leading to villous injury and mucosal inflammation, and production of a toxin similar to that of Shigella organisms. Chronic infection with failure to thrive may also occur. ETEC is the major cause of traveler's diarrhea; occasional nosocomial outbreaks have also occurred in hospitalized infants. At least three different types of E. coli enterotoxins (heat-labile, heat-stable toxin A, and heatstable toxin B) have been identified. Definitive diagnosis requires enterotoxin identification, and this method is not widely available.\n\nProphylactic antibiotics are effective in reducing the incidence of traveler's diarrhea but are not recommended for use in young children.\n\nEnterohemorrhagic E. coli produces a Shiga-like cytotoxin and causes diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and, in about 20% of infected persons, results in HUS. Both epidemic and sporadic cases have been recognized. Infection is more common in the summer and fall. A particular serotype, E. coli 0157:H7, has been isolated in several outbreaks associated with undercooked beef and has been linked to the development of HUS in young children. The most common manifestation of enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection begins with severe abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea, followed by grossly bloody stools and emesis. Fever is uncommon. Fecal leukocytes are absent or few. Other manifestations include asymptomatic infection and watery diarrhea without progression to hemorrhagic colitis. E. coli 0157:H7 is cleared from the stool in 5 to 12 days. HUS develops in a smaller number of children in the week after the onset of diarrhea. HUS manifests with renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and diarrhea. There is no role for antimicrobial therapy in enterohemorrhagic E. coli disease. Antibiotics neither shorten the duration of disease nor prevent progression to HUS; they may predispose to HUS.\n\nC. difficile causes acute and chronic diarrhea in children when the normal colonic flora is disrupted. Pseudomembranous colitis is the most severe form of this infection, occurring as a result of a severe inflammatory response to the C. difficile toxins.\n\nEpidemiology. The prevalence of carrier status for C. difficile in healthy, asymptomatic outpatients is reported to be up to 70% in healthy infants, 3% in children, and 2% in adults and as many as 20% of asymptomatic hospitalized patients. The organism grows rapidly when other intestinal pathogens are suppressed by antibiotic therapy; it can be spread rapidly from patient to patient.\n\nGastrointestinal Disorders Transmission occurs through person-to-person contact and environmental contamination. Environmental contamination occurs through the spores formed by C. difficile, which retain viability for up to 1 week on dry surfaces. C. difficile and its toxin have been identified in the feces of healthy infants in concentrations similar to those found in adults with pseudomembranous colitis. The apparent resistance of infants to C. difficile and its toxin is caused by a developmental absence of the toxin-binding site in the immature intestine.\n\nClinical Features. C. difficile infection is highly associated with recent antibiotic exposure, particularly to broad-spectrum antibiotics. These drugs disrupt the endogenous colonic flora that inhibits the growth of C. difficile. Other risk factors for C. difficile diarrhea include gastrointestinal surgery or procedures and chemotherapy.\n\nC. difficile infection should be considered in patients in whom diarrhea develops during or within several weeks of antibiotic therapy. Illness associated with this organism varies from a mild, self-limited, nonbloody diarrhea to severe hemorrhagic colitis, protein-losing enteropathy, toxic megacolon, colonic or cecal perforation, peritonitis, sepsis, shock, and death. In rare cases, manifestations of C. difficile infection include fever or abdominal pain without diarrhea or diarrhea in the absence of recent antibiotic use. C. difficile-associated colitis is caused by potent toxins produced by this organism: toxin A, a lethal enterotoxin, causes hemorrhage and fluid secretion in the intestines, and toxin B is a cytotoxin detectable by its cytopathic effects in tissue culture. Both toxins play a role in disease production, although toxin A may be more important.\n\nDiagnosis. The diagnosis of C. difficile infection is made from detection of toxin A and/or toxin B in stool samples. Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy reveals pseudomembranes in 30% to 50% of cases, typically in association with more severe disease.\n\nTreatment. The offending antibiotic is discontinued, and oral metronidazole or vancomycin therapy is initiated. Parenteral metronidazole therapy is used for severe ileus, toxic megacolon, or impending intestinal perforation (see Table 15 -10).\n\nAeromonas species are gram-negative organisms that may cause a mild, self-limited diarrheal illness in children. The most common manifestation is a watery, nonbloody, nonmucoid diarrhea seen during the late spring, summer, and early fall. More severe infections may resemble ulcerative colitis, with chronic bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is indicated in these severe cases.\n\nPlesiomonas shigelloides is a Vibrio-like organism that is sometimes implicated in childhood diarrhea. It has been linked to consumption of shellfish and travel to Mexico and Asia.\n\nGiardia lamblia is a flagellated protozoan that can cause many different symptoms, such as diarrhea, malabsorption, abdominal pain, and weight loss. It spreads through contaminated food and water as well as through person-to-person contact via the fecal-oral route. The latter mode of transmission is responsible for outbreaks of diarrhea in day care centers and residential facilities. Infection is often asymptomatic. Symptomatic illness usually develops 1 to 3 weeks after exposure and may mimic acute gastroenteritis with fever, nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. In some patients, a chronic illness develops, characterized by intermittent, foul-smelling diarrhea, abdominal bloating, nausea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. The stool should be examined for cysts or trophozoites on at least three fresh specimens, because excretion of the organism is only intermittent. An ELISA-based Giardia antigen test is a more sensitive means of detecting infection and should be performed, if available. All infected persons should be treated. Many agents are available (see Table 15 -10). Metronidazole (20-40 mg/kg/day t.i.d. for 5 days) is highly effective. Furazolidone (5 mg/kg four times a day for 7 days) is less effective but is better tolerated and is available in liquid form.\n\nThis organism is acquired in warm climates (Mexico, southwestern United States) by ingestion of cysts in fecally contaminated material. Infected individuals are often asymptomatic. Amebic dysentery may occur, but hepatic abscess and other remote infections are uncommon. Because cysts are shed in the stool on an intermittent basis, examination of several fecal specimens may be required for identification. Asymptomatic or mild infections may be treated with a luminal amebicide, such as diiodohydroxyquin; more severe infections (invasive intestinal or extraintestinal) are treated with metronidazole.\n\nThis protozoan causes watery diarrhea in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. It is an important cause of severe diarrhea in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. It has also been recognized as an occasional cause of selflimited diarrhea in travelers, as well as in children in day care centers and persons in residential institutions. The mechanisms by which these organisms cause diarrhea are unknown. Special techniques are required for identifying the oocysts in fecal specimens and should be requested if Cryptosporidium infestation is suspected. Antimicrobial therapy is not indicated in immunocompetent hosts.\n\nAcute diarrhea may accompany infections outside of the gastrointestinal tract (so-called parenteral diarrhea). Thus, upper respiratory tract and urinary tract infections may be associated with increased bowel movement frequency or stool water. The mechanism is unclear but may involve alterations in bowel motility, changes in diet, or effects of antibiotic treatment.\n\nVarious prescription and over-the-counter drugs may cause acute diarrhea. The most commonly implicated agents are antibiotics, acting through mechanisms other than C. difficile. Several other medications are also associated with diarrhea in children (Table 15-12). 278 Section Three Gastrointestinal Disorders Staphylococcal food poisoning results from ingestion of preformed enterotoxin, produced in contaminated food that has incubated at or above room temperature for a suitable period. Staphylococcal food intoxication is suggested by the sudden onset of vomiting followed, usually within 4 to 6 hours after ingestion of the contaminated food, by explosive diarrhea. The illness is self-limited and usually resolves within 12 to 24 hours. The diagnosis is made on the basis of a characteristic clinical picture. Treatment is supportive; antibiotics are not indicated. Bacillus cereus, a gram-positive, spore-forming organism found in soil, is usually associated with contamination of refried rice or vegetables. Two food poisoning syndromes can occur. A shortincubation disease (1 to 6 hours) results from ingestion of preformed toxin and is characterized by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, similar to staphylococcal food poisoning. A long-incubation period disease (8 to 16 hours) is caused by in vivo production of an enterotoxin and is characterized by abdominal pain, tenesmus, and profuse watery diarrhea. Vomiting is usually absent. Both syndromes resolve spontaneously within 24 hours and are managed with supportive care.\n\nClostridium perfringens food poisoning has been associated with ingestion of contaminated beef and poultry. The disease results from production and release of an enterotoxin into the lower bowel 8 to 24 hours after ingestion of the vegetative form of the organism. Onset is sudden, with abdominal pain and watery diarrhea. Fever and vomiting are absent.\n\nOther causes of food poisoning are noted in Table 15 -13.\n\nChronic diarrhea is defined as diarrhea lasting longer than 2 or 3 weeks. Causes of chronic diarrhea are numerous and vary markedly with age (Table 15- 14) . In the small infant, this disorder is known as intractable diarrhea of infancy (Table 15-15) . Chronic diarrhea needs to be distinguished from various malabsorption states, which are classified by the nutrient that is malabsorbed (Table 15- Table 15 -20. Therapy depends on the primary disease and includes treatment of that process plus replacement of the malabsorbed nutrient.\n\nChronic intestinal infections occur only occasionally, particularly in infants with preexisting malnutrition and in those children with immunologic deficiencies. More commonly, persistent diarrhea after acute enteritis is caused by a postinfectious enteropathy. Predisposing factors include age younger than 6 months, malnutrition, and feeding with formula rather than breast milk. Pathophysiologic mechanisms include damage to the small intestinal villi with loss of disaccharidase activity and reduction in the mucosal surface absorptive area. Small-bowel bacterial overgrowth and absorption of potentially antigenic proteins may aggravate the malabsorptive state. Patients with mild involvement may do well on a non-lactosecontaining formula. More severely affected infants may require a protein hydrolysate formula, whereas the most severely affected infants may not tolerate any enteral feedings and must be placed on parenteral nutrition. Recovery usually occurs over 4 to 6 weeks, provided that the child is supplied with adequate nutrition.\n\nFormula protein (cow's milk and/or soy protein) intolerance is caused by sensitization to dietary proteins that are absorbed intact through the intestinal mucosa. Two syndromes are most commonly seen: an enterocolitis, with inflammatory changes in the small bowel and colon, usually manifesting with bloody diarrhea in the first 3 months of life, and a less common protein-losing enteropathy, associated with diarrhea, occult intestinal blood loss, and hypoproteinemia, most often seen in infants older than 6 months.\n\nThe diagnosis of formula protein intolerance is based on exclusion of infectious causes and response to withdrawal and later repeated challenge with the suspected antigen. Skin and radioimmunosorbent test results are usually negative. This is a non-immunoglobulin E-mediated illness. There is a significant cross-reactivity between cow's milk and soy protein allergy (20% to 40%); therefore, use of a protein-hydrolysate formula is indicated.\n\nChronic nonspecific diarrhea, also known as \"toddler's diarrhea,\" typically affects children between 1 and 3 years of age and is characterized by the passage of several watery and unformed stools each day. Frequently, the stools are relatively well formed in the morning but become looser as the day progresses. The stools often appear to contain undigested vegetable matter but are without blood, mucus, or excessive fat. Children with chronic nonspecific diarrhea, if offered a normal diet, continue normal weight gain. In an attempt to treat the diarrhea, however, many children are placed on diets with restrictions of milk, other fats, and occasionally starches (wheat); such restrictions lead to failure to thrive.\n\nThe pathophysiology of chronic nonspecific diarrhea may involve abnormal intestinal motility with decreased mouth-to-anus transit time. This disorder is thought to be a variant of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and it is common with such patients to find a family history of IBS. Excessive fruit juice intake, which is common among affected children, may also contribute to the diarrhea by overwhelming the carbohydrate absorptive capacity of the gut. Because chronic nonspecific diarrhea is a benign and self-limited condition, usually resolving by age 3 to 4 years, drug therapy is neither indicated nor effective. Parents should be encouraged to place the child on a regular, unrestricted diet to provide adequate calories. The diarrhea often improves with removal of prior dietary restrictions and limitations in fruit juice intake.\n\nFat malabsorption must be suspected in any infant with chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive (see Chapters 2 and 13). Cystic fibrosis is the most common cause of fat malabsorption resulting from exocrine pancreatic deficiency in children. The diagnosis is often made through neonatal screening in most of the United States. Rare forms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency include Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (see Table 15 -14).\n\nCeliac disease (celiac sprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is defined as a disease of the proximal small intestine, characterized by an abnormal small intestinal mucosa, and is caused by a permanent intolerance to gluten. If untreated, it results in a lifelong inflammation of the small intestine in genetically susceptible individuals. Complete avoidance of gluten from the diet leads to disappearance of clinical symptoms and restoration of the small intestinal mucosa to normal. \n\nCeliac disease was once thought to be a disease of childhood; manifestation in adults is increasingly recognized. The prevalence varies between 1:152 to 1:300 in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Sweden. The prevalence in the United States is approximately 1:250.\n\nCeliac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy resulting from an inappropriate T cell-mediated immune response against the gliadin fraction of wheat gluten and against similar proteins in rye and barley that are responsible for the intestinal damage. The toxicity of oats has been questioned because both in vivo challenges and in vitro immunologic studies suggest that oats can be safely ingested. Rice and corn are nontoxic. The disease is associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles DQA10501 or DQB10201. The typical intestinal damage is characterized by loss of absorptive villi (flattening) and hyperplasia of the crypts, which result in malabsorption.\n\nChildren frequently present with diarrhea, malabsorption and steatorrhea, failure to thrive, vomiting, poor appetite, muscle wasting, signs of hypoproteinemia (including edema and ascites), and general irritability. Adult manifestations include anemia, infertility, and osteoporosis. A wide range of vague abdominal symptoms is also possible. Children may present with associated conditions such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, in which 6% to 8% of patients have concomitant celiac disease. Other conditions include cerebral calcification and thyroid disease. Celiac disease should also be considered in children with unexplained folic acid, iron, and vitamin B 12 deficiencies; hypoalbuminemia; and osteopenia.\n\nThe mainstay of diagnosis is an endoscopic intestinal biopsy demonstrating damage to the normal villous structure with a decreased ratio of villous height to crypt depth and increased lymphocytic infiltration of the mucosa. Serologic tests are very useful for screening \n\nHirschsprung disease patients who have nonspecific symptoms or an associated condition. Measurement of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antiendomysial antibodies is the best serologic test for celiac disease, with a sensitivity of 97% to 100% and a specificity of 98% to 99%. Because 2% to 3% of individuals with celiac disease have selective IgA deficiency, IgA levels should also be measured. Measurement of antigliadin is not the best approach, because the specificity and sensitivity are low in comparison with those of antiendomysial antibody. The enzyme tissue glutaminase is the antigen for the antiendomysial antibody. The tissue glutaminase assay is a promising new test, but the usefulness of this serologic test has not been well validated in children.\n\nThe cornerstone of treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Patients should omit wheat, rye, and barley from their diet. Oats may be permitted, although the majority of commercially available oat flour is contaminated with wheat gluten. Although increased risk of small bowel lymphoma had been reported in celiac disease, this has been doubted. It is advisable for patients and families to join a celiac disease group that publishes lists of locally available gluten-free products.\n\nPatients with IBS usually present with a constellation of symptoms, including abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits. Patients report alternating bouts of diarrhea and constipation, with one symptom predominant during one episode. Abdominal distention and a sense of incomplete evacuation are also common. The diagnosis of IBS is based on the presence of a number of subjective clinical symptoms. A thorough history, including a positive family history, history of infantile colic, and psychologic factors as possible inciting events, should be explored. The physical examination findings in most patients with IBS are normal. No laboratory tests are diagnostic for IBS, but several routine laboratory studies are used as a general screen to aid in the exclusion of other diseases.\n\nIBD comprises two principal categories: Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Crohn disease is a transmural, usually patchy inflammation that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Its most common distributions are the small bowel alone, the colon alone, and both large and small bowel simultaneously. Ulcerative colitis is a diffuse mucosal inflammation limited to the colon; it invariably affects the rectum and may extend proximally in a symmetric, uninterrupted pattern to involve part or all of the large intestine.\n\nEpidemiology. The incidence of Crohn disease and, to a lesser extent, that of ulcerative colitis have been rising since the early 1960s. The incidence of IBD is variable in different countries. In Scandinavia, the incidence of Crohn disease in children is 5.3 per 100,000. The incidence of ulcerative colitis in persons younger than 282 Section Three Gastrointestinal Disorders \n\nSchilling test Serum/urine bile acid determination Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography Provocative pancreatic secretion testing 20 years is approximately 1.5 to 2 per 100,000 in Scotland. In England, the incidence of IBD in persons younger than 16 years is 5.2 per 100,000. IBD affects boys and girls equally.\n\nEtiopathogenesis. The precise cause of IBD is unknown. No infectious agents have been associated with the development of IBD. The greatest known risk factor for the development of IBD is having a first-degree relative with IBD, although IBD is not inherited in a simple mendelian manner. Mutations in the NOD2 gene on chromosome 16 have been seen in 30% of patients.\n\nThe immune system appears to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Evidence supporting this association includes the histopathologic findings of intestinal lesions with marked mononuclear cell infiltration, the response of these diseases to immunosuppressive therapy, and multiple immunologic laboratory\n\nabnormalities. An antigen of dietary or infectious origin may stimulate the normally rich immune system of the intestinal mucosa. Activated immune cells present in the intestinal mucosa secrete a number of soluble mediators of inflammation, including cytokines. Imbalance of the cytokine milieu in the mucosa results in cell injury and pathologic inflammation. No specific immune aberration in children has been found.\n\nClinical Manifestation of Crohn Disease. The diagnosis of IBD is frequently delayed, especially for Crohn disease, in which symptoms can be insidious. The presenting symptoms of Crohn disease are variable, often depending on the particular sites of involvement. Common features at presentation include abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea (Table 15 -21). The abdominal pain tends to be particularly severe and frequently wakes the sleeping child. Fever or without blood and often associated with tenesmus, low-grade fever, weight loss, and mild anemia, is a very common manifestation of ulcerative colitis (Table 15 -23). As in Crohn disease, extraintestinal manifestations are also common (see Table 15 -22).\n\nDiagnosis. The diagnosis of IBD is based on clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and endoscopic findings (Table 15 -24). The differential diagnosis is noted in Tables 15-25 and 15-26. Examination of the colon should be performed early in the evaluation of any child with chronic bloody diarrhea. The findings of aphthous lesions with intervening normal appearing mucosa is highly suggestive of Crohn disease, whereas diffuse inflammation that begins at the anal verge and progresses proximally suggests ulcerative colitis. Mucosal biopsies taken to detect histopathologic abnormalities are still the most sensitive test for differentiating among Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitides. Severity may be judged by the features in Table 15 -27.\n\nTreatment. Current medical and surgical treatments are directed toward controlling symptoms, treating complications, and preventing recurrent or worsening disease. The approach to therapy in Crohn disease is rapidly changing with the addition of more potent, mucosal healing properties of immunomodulator drugs and biologic agents (Table 15-28) . Steroids are not considered the mainstay of therapy in IBD, but they are used in patients with active severe disease. The relapse rate after discontinuation of steroids may be as high as 70% within 1 year. Sulfasalazine and its analogues (mesalamine) are used in mild to moderate Crohn colitis and ulcerative colitis. These agents have been shown to facilitate discontinuation of steroids and may reduce the relapse rate afterward. Despite the efficacy of salicylate preparations, many children cannot be maintained in remission without the use of steroids. Because long-term use of steroids can lead to numerous steroid-related complications, immunomodulatory agents are first-line treatment in moderate to severe Crohn disease. The two most commonly used agents are azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. Both appear to maintain remission while allowing reduction in steroid dosage. In addition, 6-mercaptopurine is effective in the healing of perineal fistulas. The use of cyclosporine and tacrolimus in the treatment of severe refractory disease has been disappointing. Antibiotics, particularly metronidazole, are effective in healing certain perineal lesions in Crohn disease but are not beneficial in the general management of Crohn colitis and ileocolitis.\n\nNutritional therapy, both as primary treatment and as adjunctive support for drug treatment, is critical for children with IBD, particularly those with Crohn disease. Weight loss occurs in 87% of children presenting with Crohn disease and is often accompanied by impaired linear growth, decreased bone mineralization, and delayed sexual maturation. Undernutrition is multifactorial, including poor intake caused by anorexia, meal-related cramping, and diarrhea, as well as malabsorption from small-bowel involvement and increased metabolic demands from the chronic inflammatory process. Nutritional support can be provided by either the enteral or parenteral route; use of the patient's intestine is optimal. Even patients with severe inflammation can often tolerate an enteral liquid formula.\n\nSurgery. Crohn disease cannot be cured by surgery because the postoperative recurrence rate at 10 years is high, up to 80%. Surgery for Crohn disease is therefore reserved for the management of certain complications of the disease, such as intestinal perforation, obstruction, bleeding, and abscess and occasionally for growth failure in the prepubertal child with a delayed bone age. In contrast, surgical resection for ulcerative colitis can be very useful in patients with severe, acute complications or persistent disease that is unresponsive to medical therapy.\n\nAcute diarrhea is a common childhood illness ( Fig. 15-1) . For most children, the etiologic agent is of no therapeutic significance. Exceptions are giardiasis, pseudomembranous colitis, or dysentery suggestive of Shigella infection, amebiasis, or Campylobacter infection, all of which necessitate specific treatment. Of greater importance are the secondary complications associated with fluid and electrolyte losses and the reduced oral fluid intake, which may result in shock and its multiorgan system complications.\n\nRed flags for acute diarrhea are the manifestations of dehydration (see Table 15 -7). Young age (<6 months) is associated with a greater risk of dehydration, as are 10 or more stools a day and frequent emesis and fever.\n\nChronic diarrhea may be benign or may signify a more serious illness associated with malabsorption, inflammation, or congenital defects. Red flags include onset of diarrhea in the neonatal period, weight loss, growth stunting, digital clubbing, poor growth, anorexia, fever, fatty stools, blood in stools, extraintestinal manifestations associated with intestinal disease, history of travel to countries with poor sanitation and water supply, and specific nutritional deficiencies associated with malabsorption. \n\nPolymeric or elemental liquid diet \u03c9-3 fatty acids (fish oil)"}
