Rhinovirus can be easily transmitted from person to person mainly through hand contact with infected respiratory secretions (15) . Studies of asymptomatic infected individuals pointed to 15 -30% rates (9, 19, 14, 20, 7, 19) of HRV infection but the role of infected subjects as reservoirs for secondary cases infections is unknown.\n\nMany studies have investigated the occurrence of rhinovirus among community cases but there is a lack of information about the frequency of rhinovirus asymptomatic cases. We investigated HRV infections rates on selected populations of a pair of one child and one family member, health care workers (HCW), and immunocompromised patients with and without respiratory symptoms from June to September.\n\nIn this study, a total of 191 nasal swab (NS) specimens were collected from three groups. One hundred and eleven health care workers (HCW) from S\u00e3o Paulo Hospital, 36 pairs of one child and one family member and 8 blood marrow transplanted hospitalized patients (BMT). They were considered eligible symptomatic patients if possible viral etiology within 7 days of symptoms onset. The clinical criterion was presentation of at least one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, or nasal congestion) and one constitutional symptom (headache, malaise, myalgia, chills).
