{"title": "", "body": "II III\n\nThe recent availability of an effective vaccine for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an estimated 95% protective efficacy and a cost of approximately $I00 for a three-dose series* raises questions for the practicing dermatologist. Are dermatologists at significant risk to HBV? How is immunity determined? Is the vaccine safe? Are there ways of preventing the disease other than vaccination?\n\nFifteen to thirty percent of health care workers with frequent blood contact have serologic markers of HBV infection (Table I) rhosis, and 800 die from HBV-related liver cancer.\n\nThe major HBV serologic tests available both commercially and through state health departments or the Centers for Disease Control are: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), HBsAg antibody (anti-HBs), and HBeAg antibody (AntiHBe). a Table II markers in HBV in the preclinical, acute, or chronic stage, and with immunity. With any new vaccine, questions arise concerning its safety. Populations that are sources of HBsAg-positive plasma, the starting material for the vaccine, are at increased risk to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is a group of clinical entities associated with specific immune deficiency manifested by Kaposi's sarcoma and various opportunistic infections which have been recognized since 1978.\n\nThis donor group is screened with complete physical examinations, history, and laboratory tests, including hemoglobin, hematocrit, and serum protein, which must be normal, although serum aminotransferases may be elevated but must be stable.* The process used to prepare the vaccine is designed to remove or inactivate viruses with the use of both biophysical (ammonium sulfate precipitation, isopyknic banding, and zonal separation) and denaturation procedures (pepsin at pH 2, 8 M urea, and formalin). Those viruses known to be eliminated or inactivated during the process include: HBV, rhabdovirus, poxvirus, togavirus, reovirus, herpesvirus, coronavirus, myxovirus, picornavirus, kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, parvovirus, retrovirus, delta agent, and non-A, non-B hepatitis virus. Other tests for safety are used, including animal and cell culture inoculation technics.\n\nBy fall, 1982, over 19,000 persons had received the vaccine, with observation periods of up to 7 years, and side effects have primarily related to soreness at the injection site (formaldehyde, alum, *Hepatitis B virus vaccine safety: Report of an interageney group.\n\nMorbid Mortal Weekly Rep 31: 465-467, 1982. and thimerosal are used in processing) in approximately 10% and low-grade fever in 3%. * Vaccination has neither therapeutic nor adverse effects on HBV carriers. Immune individuals will have no adverse effects from vaccination. Therefore, it is not essential to screen vaccines for presence of antigen or antibody. Three intramuscular injections of 1 ml (20 ~g) are recommended, with the second and third doses 1 and 6 months after the first. The duration of protection and need for booster doses have not been determined,* but antibodies providing protection persist for at least 2 years in those receiving three doses and will probably last for 5 years when a booster may be necessary.t\n\nIn an intermediate-risk group, such as dermatologists, appropriate HBV serologic testing would seem to be desirable. The approximate cost of each test for antigen or antibody is $10. 4 The wearing of gloves for HBsAg carriers and nonimmune physicians, when exposed to blood during any type of surgical procedure, seems mandatory, since this prevents transmission of HBV between doctor and patient. 5, 6 Gloving for surgical procedures also seems prudent for protection from non-A, non-B hepatitis.\" The testing of patients for HBsAg prior to surgery can only serve to forewarn the surgeon of potential danger. Vaccination does not alleviate consideration of gamma globulin prophylaxis for the nonimmune physician after accidental glove puncture. The nonimmune der- Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology matologist should carefully consider HBV immunization, which appears to be safe and effective without deleterious long-term side effects. Dermatologists and their assistants performing surgery associated with aerosol dispersion, such as dermabrasion, should be immunized if they are HBsAg-and antiHBs-negative. Meanwhile, molecular engineering, with the insertion of HBsAg genes into microorganisms, may result in an even safer and less expensive vaccine.* "}
