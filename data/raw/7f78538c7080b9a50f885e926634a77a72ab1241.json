{"title": "Supplementary materials A. Sensitivity analysis by varying the starting point of exponential growth of cumulative novel coronavirus incidence from 1", "body": ". Sensitivity analysis with varying the start point of exponential growth in cumulative incidence from 1-10 December, 2019 in estimation Scenario 1. \n\nAs the present study relies on real-time data, the estimates (i.e., growth rate, cumulative incidence, and cCFR) using different number data cutoff dates are shown in Figure S2 (Scenario 1) and S3 (Scenario 2). Figure S2 . Sensitivity analysis in Scenario 1, varying the data cutoff date between 15 and 24 January 2020. The estimated values of the A) exponential growth rate, B) cumulative incidence, and C) confirmed case fatality risk depend on the data cutoff date (i.e., end point of each estimation). Each line and shaded area indicate the estimate and its 95% confidence interval. Figure S3 . Sensitivity analysis in Scenario 2, varying the data cutoff date between 15 and 24 January 2020. The estimated values of the A) exponential growth rate, B) cumulative incidence, and C) confirmed case fatality risk depend on the data cutoff date (i.e., end point of each estimation). Each line and shaded area indicate the estimate and its 95% confidence interval.\n\nIn the present study, the detection time window was fixed at 12.5 days, based assumed values for the incubation and infectious periods. The catchment population in Wuhan airport was also fixed at 11 million. As part of the sensitivity analysis, Table S2 shows the estimated growth rate, cumulative incidence and cCFR by varying only detection time window, while Table S3 shows the estimates with different catchment population sizes and a fixed detection time window for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively.
