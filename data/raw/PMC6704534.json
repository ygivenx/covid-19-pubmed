If q = 0, the model predicts an epidemic wave comprising sub-epidemics of the same size. Note that alternative decline functions could be considered such as harmonic or hyperbolic decline functions.

This may be attributed to the model structure (structural identifiability) or due to the lack of information in a given dataset, which could be associated with the number of observations and the spatial-temporal resolution of the data [23, 24]. Because the time series of incident cases in the observed epidemic wave is an aggregation of the overlapping sub-epidemics, different sub-epidemic profiles may give rise to indistinguishable aggregated epidemic waves. This can happen if the parameters are correlated and different combinations of parameters result in the same fit of the data but have different forecasts. For a given epidemic wave, the number of sub-epidemics could be correlated with the size of individual sub-epidemics and parameter Cthr which sets the timing of the subsequent sub-epidemic. For example, given a fixed sub-epidemic size, as Cthr increases, a smaller number of sub-epidemics can be fit to the epidemic wave.\n\nWhen a parameter is associated with substantial uncertainty, researchers may decide to constrain its range to lie within a plausible or realistic range and as close as possible to a best guess based on demographic and epidemiological data. For instance, the size of the first sub-epidemic should not be too small (e.g., K0 > 100). Moreover, by design the number of sub-epidemics comprising an epidemic wave in our model is constrained by Cthr < K0. Further, the cumulative case threshold Cthr could be further constrained so that it does not exceed the cumulative number of cases at peak incidence.\n\nOur parameter estimation approach has been described in prior publications (e.g., [19, 25]). Calibrating our sub-epidemic modeling framework to time series data requires estimating 5 model parameters namely \u0398 = (Cthr, q, r, p, K). Model parameters were estimated via least-square fitting of the model solution to the observed incidence data [26].

Thus, this metric rewards for narrow 95% prediction intervals and penalizes at the points where the observations are outside the bounds specified by the 95% prediction interval where the width of the prediction interval adds up to the penalty (if any) [30].\n\nThe mean interval score and the coverage of the 95% prediction intervals take into account the uncertainty of the predictions whereas the MAE and MSE only assess the closeness of the mean trajectory of the epidemic to the observations [8]. These performance metrics have also been adopted in international forecasting competitions [32].\n\nWe obtained the daily number of new SARS cases by date of symptom onset of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore [33] (Additional file 1). This outbreak involved three major hospitals in Singapore, and the incidence curve exhibited two overlapping waves that peaked in mid-March and early April (2003), respectively. These two small waves largely correspond to sub-epidemics stemming from different healthcare settings [33]. This epidemic lasted a total of 70 days. For each model, we generated a total of 46 short-term forecasts from day 15 until day 60. We evaluated 4, 6, 8, and 10 days ahead forecasts.\n\nWe obtained a weekly incidence curve according to the date of symptom onset for the second wave of the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the DRC from the WHO Situation Reports and Disease Outbreak News covering the reporting period: September 2018 to mid-April 2019 [34]. The incidence curve of the epidemic was further adjusted for reporting delays as described in ref. [35]. Briefly, the curve of crude incidence by date of symptom onset was adjusted for reporting delays using a nonparametric method that adapts survival analysis and life table techniques for use with right truncated data [36, 37]. This epidemic has become the second largest Ebola outbreak in history with 1186 reported cases as of April 11, 2019, despite active ring vaccination efforts in the region [34]. The outbreak was first reported on August 1, 2018, by the WHO, spreading in the urban areas of the provinces of North Khivu and Ituri in the northeast region that borders Uganda [38]. Unfortunately, armed conflict in the Ebola-affected zone is hindering rapid response activities including case detection, contact tracing, isolation, and vaccination. Prolonged transmission has been primarily attributed to poor infection control practices in healthcare settings, delays in case detection and isolation, community resistance, and violent attacks targeting health workers and health centers [38]. For each model, we conducted a total of 19 forecasts from week 8 to week 26 of the epidemic. We assessed 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks ahead forecasts.\n\nWe analyzed the main epidemic wave of the 2017 plague epidemic in Madagascar which was retrieved from the WHO reports. The epidemic wave consists of weekly confirmed, probable and suspected plague cases during September\u2013November 2017 [39]. The epidemic comprises 50 incidence weeks. For each model, we generated a total of 26 forecasts from week 10 to week 35 of the epidemic. We assessed 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks ahead forecasts.\n\nThe sub-epidemic model consistently yielded the best fit to the daily incidence curves for each of the three outbreaks (SARS, plague, and Ebola) based on the four performance metrics (MAE, MSE, MIS, and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval) as shown in Table 1. For the SARS outbreak in Singapore, the sub-epidemic model was able to successfully capture the two-wave pattern of the SARS outbreak, and the model parameter estimates were well identified (Fig. 3). In contrast, the simpler single-peak growth models were unable to reproduce the bimodal shape of the outbreak, yielding poorer performance (Table 1 and Fig. 4). For the plague outbreak in Madagascar, the sub-epidemic model also outperformed the other simple models (Table 1) and captured an epidemic wave comprised by 5 sub-epidemics of decreasing size (Fig. 5). Further, parameter estimates for this outbreak were also well identified as indicated by their relatively small uncertainty (Fig. 5). For instance, the 95% confidence interval for the size of the initial sub-epidemic ranges between 634 and 761.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the first 28 weeks of the ongoing Ebola epidemic in DRC (06 Sep 2018 to 11 Mar 2019), our sub-epidemic model outperformed the simpler models (Table 1 and Fig. 6). For instance, the sub-epidemic model yielded a much lower MIS and much higher coverage of the 95% prediction interval compared to simpler growth models (Table 1). Moreover, our results predict an epidemic wave consisting of 4 sub-epidemics of stable size (~ 250 cases) as the parameter q is estimated to be very low, suggesting a stable incidence pattern (Fig. 6). Further, parameter estimates are well identified as indicated by their relatively narrow confidence intervals. For instance, the 95% confidence interval for the initial sub-epidemic size ranges from 232 to 275. However, some of the most recent incidence data points lie substantially above the upper bound of the 95% prediction interval. These anomalies suggest that substantial changes in the underlying dynamics (beyond stochasticity) have occurred more recently.\n\n\nFor the SARS outbreak in Singapore, our sub-epidemic model outperformed the simpler growth models in terms of the mean interval score and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval across the 4, 6, 8, and 10 days ahead short-term forecasts (Table 2). However, at longer forecast horizons (8 and 10 days), the MAE and the MSE tended to be lower for the Richards model. Unlike the sub-epidemic model (Fig. 7), the simpler models were unable to forecast the second surge in case incidence of the SARS outbreak. Further, the quality of the fit provided by the simpler models during the calibration period deteriorates as the number of data points increases.\n\n\n\nFor the plague outbreak in Madagascar, the sub-epidemic model consistently outperformed the simpler models in short-term forecasts (2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks ahead) based on the MAE, the MIS, and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval (Table 3). In terms of the MSE, the sub-epidemic model outperformed the simpler models at forecasting horizons of 2 and 3 weeks, whereas the Richards model outperformed the other models at forecasting horizons of 4 and 5 weeks (Table 3, Figs. 8 and 9).\n\n\n\n\nFor the ongoing Ebola outbreak in DRC, the sub-epidemic model consistently outperformed the other models in short-term forecasts (2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks ahead) based on all of the performance metrics (Table 4). We found that the sub-epidemic model predicts a traveling wave with some oscillatory behavior that is shaped by a sub-epidemic profile of consecutive outbreaks (Fig. 10). However, the last forecast shows that the epidemic wave model was unable to capture a significant increase in the incidence pattern associated with a fourth sub-epidemic (Fig. 11).\n\n\n\n\nWe have introduced a sub-epidemic wave modeling framework based on the premise that overlapping and regular sub-epidemics, which are often unobserved, can determine the shape of the trajectory of epidemic waves that are observed at larger spatial scales. We demonstrated the framework by assessing the quality of model fit to observed case incidence data and performance in short-term forecasts for SARS in Singapore, plague in Madagascar, and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in DRC (September 2018 to mid-April 2019). We hope that our work will motivate the advancement of modeling frameworks and forecasting competitions that are needed for advancing the field of disease forecasting.\n\nOur findings indicate that the sub-epidemic model outperformed simpler phenomenological growth models in short-term forecasts based on performance metrics that account for the uncertainty in predictions and was a better fit to epidemic trajectories from empirical outbreak data. The sub-epidemic modeling framework supports a diversity of epidemic growth dynamics including stable incidence patterns with sustained or damped oscillations. For example, the epidemic wave model successfully captured the bimodal pattern of the SARS outbreak in Singapore, and the short-term sequential model forecasts was able to forecast the second surge in case incidence for this outbreak. The second wave of the epidemic cannot be predicted by the simpler logistic growth models unless there is an external forcing term.\n\nThe sub-epidemic model for the Ebola epidemic in DRC indicates that the national incidence curve follows a stable incidence pattern with periodic behavior that can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics. In particular, the epidemic wave model outperformed simpler phenomenological growth models in short-term forecasts of the Ebola epidemic in DRC. However, the model was unable to capture a significant recent increase in the incidence pattern, which highlights the need to strengthen public health interventions in the region in order to bring the epidemic under control. Such a significant increase in the incidence pattern could result from the deterioration in the effectiveness of contact tracing efforts and systematic vaccination refusals associated with community mistrust exacerbated by intermittent attacks to health workers and treatment centers.\n\nReporting delays tend to introduce substantial uncertainty in case incidence during the most recent weeks of an ongoing epidemic outbreak [35\u201337] and could potentially distort the incidence curve of the epidemic, and in turn, misconstrue estimates of transmission potential and forecasts of the outbreak trajectory. In the context of the ongoing Ebola epidemic in DRC [35], reporting delays are influenced by community mistrust in the government and public health authorities [40] as well as the effectiveness of control interventions (e.g., contact tracing and vaccinations) taking place in a conflict zone. Indeed, violent attacks continue to hamper the ongoing Ebola outbreak response, with recent attacks targeting Ebola treatment centers mainly located in Congo\u2019s eastern areas of Butembo and Katwa [41, 42].\n\nOur sub-epidemic modeling framework can capture a rich spectrum of epidemic dynamics compared to simple susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental models which support early exponential growth in na\u00efve populations and near symmetric epidemic trajectories [43, 44]. Our epidemic wave model supports traveling waves with oscillatory behavior with or without the effects of control interventions. Indeed, in large susceptible populations and in the absence of control interventions, traditional SIR compartmental models with homogenous mixing predict unabated exponential growth during the early epidemic growth phase in the absence of susceptible depletion and control interventions or behavior changes. Moreover, when calibrated with the trajectory of the initial growth phase, traditional models (e.g., logistic growth type models) tend to predict a near immediate decline in the epidemic trajectory [19] while our epidemic wave model forecasts traveling waves of variable shapes including resurgent epidemics stemming from the aggregation of asynchronous sub-epidemics [45]. Finally, post-peak forecasts using the epidemic wave model display an epidemic tail that tends to decline more slowly than predicted by traditional single-epidemic homogenous mixing SIR models [43].\n\nOur findings highlight how overlapping sub-epidemic structures could give rise to oscillatory behavior or resurgence patterns in epidemic trajectories. This observation has significant implications for interpreting apparent noise in incidence data since the oscillations could be dismissed as the result of data overdispersion when in fact the oscillations stem from mechanisms underlying the transmission dynamics. More importantly, a real-time temporary downturn in case incidence resulting from oscillatory behavior could give the false impression of a positive effect of public health interventions.\n\nOur epidemic wave model is phenomenological in the sense that multiple factors could be responsible for the predicted sub-epidemic profile ranging from the epidemiology of the disease to population mobility patterns, the distribution of risk behavior, and the effects of public health interventions. Prior studies have put forward relatively simple models that incorporate population structure and support traveling epidemic waves or disease resurgence patterns [45\u201351]). One such model is the household-community transmission model with overlapping communities that has been used to investigate transmission and control of Ebola epidemics [48]. In this model, outbreaks not only spread more slowly but the size of those epidemics is smaller compared to the homogenous mixing SIR models.\n\nWhile the sub-epidemic wave model introduced in this paper is relatively simple, our work should motivate further development of more realistic multiscale models based on the sub-epidemic building block, perhaps by incorporating more complex dynamics for the generation of sub-epidemic profiles. For instance, in real-time epidemic forecasting applications, it could be possible to relax the assumptions regarding the regularity in the timing and evolution of sub-epidemic sizes in our model by relying on additional data stemming from field investigations. For instance, additional data could inform the timing and relative size of unfolding sub-epidemics. Furthermore, future work could investigate the forecasting performance of the sub-epidemic model with that of mechanistic models developed for specific diseases and contexts. Among mechanistic models, one could consider metapopulation transmission models that integrate sub-epidemics shaped by dynamic transmission rates or effective population sizes that fluctuate due to interventions or behavior changes."}
