{"title": "Article type: Research Article Title: Under-the-radar dengue virus infections in natural populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes Running title: Dengue virus maintenance in mosquito vectors", "body": "Approximately 40% of the globe is at risk of infection by flaviviruses, such as dengue virus 2 (DENV): an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti 3 mosquitoes [1, 2] . Since severe disease from DENV infections can manifest as dengue 4 hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome [1] , DENV establishment in the continental United 5 States is a major concern for public health agencies. In the USA, Florida has experienced 6 increases in local DENV transmission since 2009 [3] , driven in part by human and pathogen 7 movement. Ae. aegypti is endemic throughout subtropical Florida and the vector population 8 has resurged recently, following its near displacement by Ae. albopictus [4] . Autochthonous 9 DENV infection occurs sporadically, primarily in Southern Florida with limited local cases 10 elsewhere in the state [3] . In 2019, 16 cases of locally acquired DENV were reported for the 11 state, including an area along the West-Central Florida Gulf Coast. 12 13 Recently, reports have indicated that certain insect-specific viruses (ISVs) can negatively 14 impact or enhance arbovirus (including DENV) infections in insect cells [5, 6] and mosquitoes 15 [7] , respectively. Although the impacts of many ISVs on arboviral competence have yet to be 16 determined, the evidence to date clearly indicates that the mosquito virome cannot be safely 17 ignored and likely influences the risk of autochthonous DENV transmission once the virus is 18 introduced into an area. Therefore, we conducted a metaviromic study of F1 (first-generation, 19 lab-raised mosquitoes from wild parents) Ae. aegypti adult females collected as eggs from 20 ovitraps in 2016-2017 from Manatee County to assess the potential risk of flavivirus 21 transmission outside of Southern Florida. Although no indexed human case of DENV4 was 22 reported during 2016-2017 in the county, we detected and sequenced DENV4, which may 23 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Non-mosquito reads were assembled using Spades (3.11.1) in metagenomics 48 mode [8] . For each contig, local similarity search in protein space was run using Diamond 49 (0.9.17) [9] against the NCBI NR database. Reads were mapped against assemblies using 50 Bowtie (2.3.4.1) [10] , then sorted/indexed using Samtools (1.4.1) [11] . Megan 6 [12] was used 51 to assign contigs and read counts to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) and to view viral 52 contigs. To estimate microbial community abundance, Diamond (0.9.17) [9] was used to 53 search reads against the NCBI NR database, Megan 6 [12] was used to assign read counts to 54 the LCA, and R (3.6.0) package Compositions [13] (1.40-2) was used to create a sub-55 composition of RNA (Fig. 1b) . Compositional count data from the Megan [12] LCA 56 classification was assessed by ALDEx2 [14, 15] to estimate the statistical significance of the 57 change in DENV4 reads from 2016 to 2017. ALDEx2 [14, 15] uses a Dirichlet multinomial 58 Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the variance of the centered log ratio (CLR) values for taxa 59 amongst the reads. Using the variance of the CLR, ALDEx2 [14, 15] computes P-values 66 Two contigs covering most of the genome with a small gap were obtained. To create a closed 67 genome, a dataset of genomes for DENV1-4 (NC_001477.1, NC_001474.2, NC_001475.2, 68 NC_002640.1) and the two assembled contigs were used. We selected reads sharing a 31-69 mer with the dataset using BBduk (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/), followed by 10 assessed by calculating the Effective Sampling Size (ESS) of parameter estimates. The HKY 95 substitution model [28] was used with empirical base frequencies and gamma distribution of 96 site-specific rate heterogeneity. The fit of strict vs. relaxed uncorrelated molecular clock 97 models, and constant size vs. Bayesian Skyline Plot [29] demographic models were tested.\n\nMarginal likelihood estimates (MLE) for Bayesian model testing were obtained using path 99 sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) methods [30, 31] 106 The viral RNA sequencing reads were mapped onto the complete genome of seven DENV4 107 strains. These strains represent all the known DENV4 lineages (accession numbers are 108 provided in Fig. 3c) . We also mapped the reads onto the assembled Manatee DENV4 full From the 234 DENV4 genome alignment, sequences corresponding to the NS2A gene were 117 extracted to investigate selection pressure and mutations that potentially influenced adaptation 118 author/funder.

Comparative selection and mutation analyses 119 revealed NS2A as a relatively strong region of potential selection for the Manatee County 120 genome. HyPhy algorithms were used to estimate non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) 121 codon substitution rate ratios (\u03c9), with \u03c9<1 indicating purifying/negative selection and \u03c9>1 122 indicating diversifying/positive selection [33, 34] . Fast, unconstrained Bayesian approximation 123 (FUBAR) [35] was used for inferring pervasive selection, and the mixed effects model of 124 evolution (MEME) [36] (Fig. 1a) . 151 A full DENV4 genome (MN192436) was constructed with an overall genome coverage of ~11X 152 across the reads (Fig. 2) . We observed that the 2017 DENV4 signal was much lower than 168 After analyzing the metavirome, we investigated the genome of the DENV4 strain to determine 169 its likely source and assess the potential timeframe of introduction into Florida. Our first 170 analysis confirmed the phylogenetic signal and absence of nucleotide substitution saturation 171 ( Fig. S2a-b) . We subsequently explored Manatee County DENV4's phylogeny with a 234-172 genome DENV4 dataset constructed from GenBank sequences (Table S1) by maximum 173 likelihood (ML) phylogenetic inference (Fig. 3a) . The ML phylogeny showed three clades: two 174 Asian clades, and one American clade with two Senegalese strains (MF00438, KF907503) and 175 one Thai (KM190936) at the base (Fig. 3a) . Manatee DENV4 can be classified as DENV4 176 genotype IIb. The DENV4 genome obtained in Florida most closely clustered with two Haitian 177 isolates from 2014 (KT276273, KP140942) and a cluster of Puerto Rican isolates (Fig. 3a) . 178 Further back, a Haitian isolate (JF262782) collected 20 years earlier also clustered with the 179 Manatee-associated clade (Fig. 3a) .\n\nTo estimate the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for DENV4 entry into Manatee County, 182 Florida, as well as date divergence of the strain with Haitian isolates, we performed a 183 molecular clock analysis using a Bayesian evolutionary framework [29] on a reduced dataset 184 including only the \"Americas clade.\" We first assessed the phylogenetic signal and the 185 absence of nucleotide substitution saturation ( Fig. S2c-d) and then the temporal signal alone 186 (Fig. S3) . In the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree, Manatee DENV4 clustered with the 187 Haitian isolates from 2014 (Node A posterior probability [PP] > 0.9) (Fig. 3b) . The MCC 188 author/funder.

The protein-coding regions of Manatee DENV4 215 were compared to four Haitian DENV4 genomes from 1994-2015 and a 1981 Senegalese 216 DENV4 genome. These were analyzed for all amino acid substitutions between strains, and a 217 dN/dS analysis was conducted comparing the Senegalese DENV4 genome with Manatee 218 DENV4 ( Fig. 4a and Table S2 ). The highest proportions of amino acid substitution were seen 219 in NS2A and the 2K peptide; simultaneously, the highest dN/dS values occurred for the NS2A 220 gene, to a point of weak positive selection (dN/dS > 1) that covered a V1238T mutation 221 discussed further herein. We then calculated dN/dS ratios for DENV4 altogether, genotype II, 222 genotype IIa, and genotype IIb with all sequences available, as well as within the Haiti-Florida 223 clade and the Haiti-Florida-Puerto-Rico clades (Fig. 4b) . Purifying selection, which occurs 224 when non-synonymous mutations are deleterious, dominated, but we found weaker purifying 225 selection in NS2A and 2K peptide genes, correlating to the Manatee-to-Senegal dN/dS 226 analysis conducted previously. Values of dN/dS for these genes increased relative to those for 227 flanking genes for genotype IIb and Caribbean/Florida-specific groups as well (Fig. 4b) .\n\n228 229 Next, we further analyzed coding sequences in specific regions of the genome to investigate 230 specific mutations that may have mediated Manatee DENV4 Floridian entry and persistence. the Senegalese genome from the first NS2A-specific analysis (Fig. 4d) , and we observed that 247 it had the second highest general rate of non-synonymous mutations and had a peak of 248 weaker purifying selection (Fig. 4a) . There was only one non-synonymous mutation among the 249 six genomes, which is significant considering the size of the 2K peptide. This was a T2232A 250 mutation present solely in the Manatee DENV4 sequence. (Fig. 4c) . 342 The 1981 Senegalese strain, the closest-clustering strain to the Manatee strain isolated 343 outside the Americas (Fig. 3a-b) , shares none of these mutations with Manatee DENV4. An in-344 depth understanding of how putative \"hallmark\" mutations in arboviruses can lead to increased 345 local aegypti mosquito infections is lacking and compels further study. author/funder.
