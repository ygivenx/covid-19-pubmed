{"title": "", "body": "According to CMS rule \u00a7416.51(b) and \u00a7416.51(b)(1), an ASC \"must maintain an ongoing infection control program designed to prevent, control, and investigate infections and communicable diseases.\" 2 This program should be \"under the direction of a designated and qualified professional who has training in infection control.\" 2 The ASC administrators must designate, in writing, the individual or group of individuals who are qualified through education, training, experience, or certification to be an infection control professional.\n\nIf the ASC is not Medicare or Medicaid certified but is accredited by one of several ambulatory accreditation organizations (eg, the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care [AAAHC], the American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities [AAAASF], the Joint Commission), specific infection control requirements must be met for the health care organization to retain its accreditation status. For additional infor-mation refer to AAAHC Standard 5-Quality Management and Improvement 3(p30-33) and Standard 8-Facilities and Environment, items B through P, 3(p37-38) and AAAASF Standard 5.001.61.0 through 5.001.65.0. 4(p28-29) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines an infection control professional as a person whose primary training is in either nursing, medical technology, microbiology, or epidemiology, and who has acquired specialized training in infection control. 5(p51-52) On July 10, 2008, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) began referring to infection control professionals as infection preventionists because of their expanding roles. 6 Activities that are typical of an infection preventionist (eg, coordinator, officer) include, but are not limited to, the following: \u2022 evaluation of new medical products that could be associated with an increased infection risk (eg, infusion devices and equipment); and \u2022 participation in research projects. 4, 7 The CMS does not mandate that the ASC administrators, the infection preventionist, and staff members follow one specific infection control guideline. Ambulatory surgery center administrators should consider all related regulations and standards and base their infection control policies and procedures on the needs of the facility. These regulations and standards are authored by several nationally recognized infection control organizations, including but not limited to: \u2022 tools available to assist the infection preventionist in performing essential tasks (eg, electronic tracking, electronic medical records)."}
