According to the outbreak dynamics released by China, most of the cases have come from Hubei, but outbreaks have been detected throughout the country. As a place famous for tourism, Yunnan has a large number of imported cases, and the incidence level is in the middle of the whole country. and light type, and a small number of patients with severe or critical type recovered relatively well. By 24:00 on February 17, 2020, there were no death cases. In our clinical work, we found significant changes in patients' nutritional status, which may be related to inflammation and immunity. This paper will analyze the clinical characteristics of the new type of coronavirus pneumonia admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Kunming City, and analyze the relationship between serum proalbumin and T cells and its clinical significance.\n\nThis study was approved by the ethics committee of The Third People's Hospital of Kunming, and all data were used for clinical studies only, with the written consent of patients and their guardians.

Case or rate were used for data counting, and \u03c72 test was used for inter-group comparison; The measurement data of normal distribution were expressed as x\u00b1s, and the measurement data of non-normal distribution were expressed as median (quartile spacing). The measurement data of normal distribution was verified with t-test or analysis of variance, and the rank sum test was used for inter-group comparison of non-normal distribution. The relationship between PAB and T cell subsets and hs-crp was analyzed by regression, and the scatter plot was made by simple linear regression and the regression equation was calculated. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n2.1 clinical features: general data 36 patients were diagnosed at the age of 3-79 years, with a median age of 45 years, including 4 children (11.11%).

Only 2 of the 36 cases included in this study were assessed as critical on admission, while the rest of the cases were mainly of normal type and not severe. [2] [3] On admission, 50% of the patients had fever and cough as their first symptoms, mainly moderate and low fever, with few gastrointestinal symptoms. In this study, the lymphocyte absolute value reduction is only in 5 cases (13.9%), hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%), significantly lower than the 69% and 93% reported by Tongji Hospital Affiliated s, or less than 35% and 86% of the Jinyintan Hospital reports respectively. That may be involved with the fact that this study is mainly based on the common type and mild type.\n\nThe changes of lymphocyte absolute value and hypersensitive c-reactive protein in patients with the common and mild cases of the new coronavirus pneumonia are not as evident as those in the severe and critical cases, which can be easily ignored during clinical observation. In this study, we found a decrease in prealbumin in 15 cases (41.67%), and no previous studies have reported prealbumin changes. Prealbumin is usually used in clinical evaluation of the nutritional status of the body, and the half-life of serum prealbumin is short, so its changes may occur before albumin. In this study, there were only 5 patients with decreased albumin, all of which were with a slight decrease, but 14 patients (41.67%)showed decreased prealbumin. The pulmonary CT findings of the patients were basically consistent with previous reports. Twenty-two (61.11%) of the patients showed abnormal findings, with ground glass density shadows.\n\n.

As a commonly used indicator to evaluate nutritional status in clinical practice, prealbumin is often utilized to evaluate tumor and postoperative recovery [4] . Domestic scholar CAI Chuanqi et al. [5] found that hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for the severity of disease in elderly pneumonia patients. This study found that the albumin in the disease group was basically normal, while the prealbumin was significantly lower than that in the normal control group. We analyzed the relationship between prealbumin and CD3 + T cells, CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells respectively. The regression model showed that there is a linear and positive correlation between the level of prealbumin in the serum of patients and CD3 + T cells, CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells, with the strongest correlation among CD8 + T cells. Proalbumin is an acute reactive protein synthesized by liver cells with a half-life of 19 days [6] . In the early stage of the disease, proalbumin changes, which may be caused by the consumption of proalbumin by the body after infection with the virus, leading to the reduction of proalbumin in peripheral blood. Recent studies have found that inflammation is an effective inhibitor of protein synthesis, and it may also inhibit the synthesis of visceral prealbumin during the occurrence and development of the disease, leading to a low level of prealbumin [7] . Due to fever and infection, the body is in a state of high decomposition and high energy demand. If at the same time with lack of energy and loss of appetite, the patient cannot ensure sufficient food intake through the mouth to meet the needs of the body. Meanwhile if combined with basic diseases of other viscera, moderate or severe malnutrition can easily appear in pneumonia patients. Clinical studies have found that malnutrition rates in patients with severe pneumonia are as high as 60%, with immune dysfunction. Enteral nutrition or other forms of nutritional support are usually provided only to patients with severe pneumonia. Good nutritional status not .

Prealbumin can be used as an early warning indicator of immune function in patients with new coronavirus pneumonia. Through the analysis of the relationship between prealbumin and T cell subsets, the decreased value of prealbumin indicates that the patient's cellular immune function is impaired, which plays a certain role in clinical condition monitoring.\n\nAccording to the current outbreak reports, most of the patients are mild and normal type. In this study, we concluded that lymphocyte changes are not significant in the early stage of the disease in both normal and mild patients, and that changes in t-cell subsets and prealbumin might be beneficial for evaluating the disease."}
