{"title": "Estimating and modelling the transmissibility of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus during the 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea", "body": "Quickly measuring transmissibility of an emerging respiratory infectious disease is vital to preparedness of authorities and design of the optimal intervention strategies. The key quantity that characterises the transmissibility is the basic reproductive number (R\n0), the average number of new infections caused by a single infective individual introduced into a completely susceptible population.1 It is a threshold parameter: if R\n0<1, the disease dies out without any intervention; otherwise, the disease can persist. To monitor how transmissibility evolves and whether the countermeasures can reduce the transmission along the outbreak course, the effective reproduction number (R\nt) is also a useful parameter. Following the 2003 SARS outbreak, especially the 2009 pandemic flu, effort has been made to rapidly estimate the reproductive number and many statistical methods2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 were proposed for this task. Fortunately, these methods have now been made in publicly available software.8, 9\n\n\nMiddle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS\u2010CoV), a zoonotic virus, was first identified in Saudi Arabia in June 2012. Multiple introductions to the human population have occurred from the animal reservoir in the Middle East, with person\u2010to\u2010person transmission well documented in healthcare and household settings. Sporadic, exported cases have been reported in Europe, Africa, Asia and North America since, with cases linked with returning travel from the Middle East. Although limited transmission was reported in these other regions, no sustained onward transmission has been detected outside of the Middle East until 2015. MERS\u2010CoV transmissibility has been estimated to be around the threshold value of 1.0, ranging from 0.4 to 1.5.10, 11, 12 These estimates are mainly based on sporadic cases and self\u2010limited clusters.13 However, the estimation14 on a large healthcare\u2010associated outbreak in Jeddah and Riyan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) during spring 2014, with over 300 cases, suggested a higher R\n0 ranging from 2.0 to 6.7.\n\nThe epidemic in the Republic of Korea (ROK) during 2015 was seeded from a traveller returned from Bahrain after visiting the United Arab Emirates and the KSA, and caused an outbreak of 185 confirmed cases. It has been the largest outbreak outside of the Middle East so far,15 and much theoretical attention has been attracted to estimate its transmissibility. Hsieh16 used a phenomenological model to obtain an estimate of R\n0 ranging from 7.0 to 19.3. Xia et al.17 and Kim et al.18 used transmission dynamics models and obtained R\n0 = 4.4 and 5.4, respectively. Reconstructing the transmission tree and considering the heterogeneity in the transmission processes, Nishiura et al.19 estimated that the reproductive number throughout the whole outbreak has a mean of about 1.0 and a variance of 52.1 (it is worth mentioning that the mean reproductive number throughout the outbreak course is of no help for understanding the transmissibility of the causing pathogens).* These estimates differ from the studies based on previous MERS\u2010CoV outbreaks10, 11, 12 and show a quite diverse picture of R\n0 for the ROK outbreak. In general, the transmissibility depends not only on the biological properties of a pathogen such as transmission mode and infectivity, but also on the susceptibility and contact patterns of the host populations.1 The difference in transmissibility among different locations and ethnic populations highlights the importance of its setting dependency. It implies that given the same infectivity of a pathogen, the size and duration of the outbreaks it causes will depend on the contact patterns of the population attributable to their culture\u2010associated behaviours or geographical\u2010related environment. Different from Westernised culture, Koreans have the tradition to visit relatives and friends in hospitals and can choose the hospitals that they think are the best for their treatment. This culture\u2010associated behaviour along with increased infectivity in hospital environment10, 20 may have facilitated the spread of MERS\u2010CoV in the ROK.21\n\n\nBoth Xia et al.17 and Kim et al.18 used dynamics models to identify the main determinants of transmission in the ROK outbreak. Both assume that the hospitalised patients can transmit infection to others, which is not true in the ROK outbreak where no infection was caused by confirmed cases as they were all isolated after the confirmation.21 Further, they both fixed the transition rates so that the stage durations (e.g incubation period and delay from symptom onset to hospitals) were implicitly assumed to be exponential. This is also not true as the observed stage durations are non\u2010exponentially distributed (see Appendix S1). They used the least\u2010square methods to estimate the model parameters, which, in view of a huge amount of uncertainty and heterogeneity in the outbreak,19 may not be appropriate. To comprehensively understand how these variations affect the estimation of transmissibility, a more general methodology such as Bayesian inference is needed which combined case data and the priors extracted from previous studies or direct estimates from the outbreak data.\n\nIn this study, we revisit the estimation of reproductive number of MERS\u2010CoV using statistical methods on the outbreak data released by Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC)22 Furthermore, by considering the actual situation of transmission events, we propose a transmission dynamics model to explore how the variation in transition rates affects the decomposition of the key pathways of the spread. The dynamic modelling aims to shed useful insights into the design of effective intervention strategies, which will be critical for controlling emerging respiratory outbreaks in future.\n\nThe ROK outbreak started from one traveller from the Middle East who was confirmed with the MERS\u2010CoV on 20 May 2015. This outbreak resulted in 186 cases including 38 deaths. Cases were scattered across the country. One case travelled to China, was confirmed and treated there; under the Chinese government's rapid response and control programme, the case did not cause any onward transmission. Detailed outbreak data are available from KCDC.22 The information on each confirmed case included symptom\u2010onset date, confirmation date, infection place, possible infectors, first and last exposure dates and date of recovery or death.\n\nAll the 186 cases had confirmation dates, but only 179 cases had symptom\u2010onset dates with three healthcare workers who tested positive reportedly having no symptoms and another four cases reportedly having symptoms but no symptom\u2010onset dates reported. To use all the 186 cases, we regarded asymptomatic cases as symptomatic, and imputed the symptom\u2010onset dates as following: for each of the seven cases, any date before its confirmation date could be its illness onset date with probabilities given by a gamma distribution obtained from the delays from symptom onset to confirmation of the 179 cases. Potential exposure windows for 184 cases were recorded. We generated exposure dates by assuming the actual dates were uniformly distributed over the exposure windows for each case. For other two cases that have no recorded exposure windows but have symptom\u2010onset dates, any date before the symptom\u2010onset date could be the exposure date with probabilities given by the fitted incubation period distribution.\n\nFor 162 cases, the outbreak investigators observed a unique likely infector. As in the KSA nosocomial outbreaks,23 superspreaders were detected in the ROK outbreak: with only five cases responsible for the majority of confirmed cases and producing more than 80% of all 185 onward transmissions.\n\nThe Central MERS\u2010CoV Control Office in Korea (KoMCO) informed daily on all new confirmed cases and their details from the fourth confirmed case on 26th May onwards through its websites (mainly in Korean and some in English) and the International Health Regulations (IHR) group on the World Health Organization (WHO) web site (in English). They started quarantining close contacts with confirmed patients from 20th May including family members and hospital staff. Prior to 30th May, only KCDC conducted the confirmation tests. From then, the tests were conducted in local provincial trusts. From 6th June, the government started revealing all hospitals where confirmed patients visited. The Task Force to control the outbreak was established on 8th June and extra 250 officers were put to deal with quarantining and the contact tracing work. On 18th June, the Prime Minister of the ROK announced that he would control the outbreak. There was no law defining MERS as a notifiable infectious disease until 9th June. The timeline of these intervention measures is shown in Figure 1.\n\nTo reflect the huge dispersion in the daily number of cases, the negative binomial likelihood function was used. The number x\ni(t) of cases on day t is distributed as(4)li(xi(t)|\u0398,\u03b7)=\u0393(xi(t)+rti)\u0393(rti)\u0393(xi(t)+1)1\u03b7rti1\u22121\u03b7xi(t),where(5)rti=\u03bci(t)/(\u03b7\u22121)\n\n\nHere, \u03b7 is the dispersion parameter and \u03bci(t) are the predictions of the cases on day t from the transmission dynamics. Here, index i stands for three different observational data: infection (E), symptomatic cases (I) and confirmed cases (C).\n\nAssuming that the observed incidence x\ni(1), x\ni(2),\u2026, x\ni(T\ni) are conditionally independent, the total likelihood given parameters \u0398 is(6)L(\u0398,\u03b7;x)=\u220fi=E,I,C\u220f\u03c4=tiTili(xi(\u03c4)|\u0398,\u03b7),where the starting points of the three series are t\nE = 3, t\nI = 1, t\nC = 10, respectively, and their end points are T\nE = 48, T\nI = 53, T\nC = 55. (As the exposure date of the index case is earlier than 11th May, only 185 cases are used for the exposure date series.)\n\nThe priors f(\u0398) for parameters are extracted from the literature or direct estimation from the ROK outbreak data (see Table 1). Employing Bayesian framework through the combination of the priors f(\u0398) and the likelihood L(\u0398,\u03b7;x), the posterior distribution can be obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations (MCMC). From these samples, we obtain means and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for parameters.29\n\n\nThe DIC that was used to compare the performance of model variants is defined30 as(7)DIC=12VarDev(\u0398,\u03b7)\u22122logL(\u0398,\u03b7;x)\n\n\nThe most parsimonious model variant is the one that has the smallest DIC.\n\nSome packages coded in R\u2010computing language are available for estimating the transmissibility once the incidence time series data and serial interval (SI), which is defined as the difference in symptom\u2010onset dates of infectee\u2010infector pairs, are known. The six approaches used are listed in Table 2 and briefly described below. For these methods, we assume the SI distribution of mean = 12.62 days and SD = 4.29 days, which is directly estimated from the data (Figure A3 in Appendix S1) and close to the previous estimate by Cowling et al.31\n\n\n\nExponential growth rate method\n3 estimates R\n0 by formula R\n0 = 1/M(\u2212r), where r denotes the estimate of initial exponential growth rate and M stands for the moment generating function of SI distribution; maximum\u2010likelihood estimation method\n6 assumes that the number of secondary cases caused by an index case is Poisson\u2010distributed with expected value R\n0; sequential Bayesian method\n5 approximates the SIR model by assuming the incidence at next time point is Poisson\u2010distributed with mean equalling to the product of the current incidence and exp{(R\n0 \u2212 1)/(infectious period)}; time\u2010dependent transmission tree method\n2 estimates reproduction numbers using transmission tree based only on the gaps in symptom\u2010onset dates between patients. These four methods are coded in the R0 package.8\n\n\nPackage \u201cEpiEstim\u201d ,9 which was based on the Nowcasting method4 that takes censoring into account, provides a method to estimate the instantaneous reproductive number (R\nt) smoothing by averaging over an interval. The transmission tree method7 is a development of another method2 by further combining the possible contact information to construct the transmission tree. The new method applies Bayesian inference to simultaneously estimate the most likely transmission tree and SI distribution.\n\nThe model comparison (Table 3) shows that the model variants with the breaking point in contact rate and diagnosis response to infection at 28 May 2015 are the best. Figure 2 illustrates the model fitting with data for the best model variant. In accordance with the suggestion of Spiegelhalter et al.,32 however, model variants with the breaking point at 29th May are not substantially different from the best variant, and are also good. This suggests that the effectively breaking point took place on 28th or 29th May. This is in agreement with the result of Hsieh16 who fitted the Richards model to cumulative case data. Transmission dynamics modelling suggests the reproductive number before the intervention (R\n0) has median 9.11 and 95% CI [5.32, 15.92] with the breaking point at 28th May (or 6.85 [4.13, 11.92] if the breaking point is at 29th May) for the model assuming both contact rate and diagnosis rate vary with the breaking point (Table 1 and Table C1 in Appendix S3). For the model that assumes only contact rate varies with the breaking point, the estimates of R\n0 are: 6.07 [4.20, 8.70] (5.36 [3.76, 7.60]) (see Tables C2 and C3 in Appendix S3). These estimates are compatible with the previous studies.16, 17, 18 Although all16, 17, 18 used cumulative data while we use daily incidence data, the similar estimates were obtained. This implies the limited influence of using different data set on the results. These estimates show that R\n0 of MERS\u2010CoV in the ROK is far beyond the threshold level.\n\nThe three estimation methods (exponential growth rate, maximum likelihood and sequential Bayesian) show estimates of R\n0 (Table 2 and Appendix S2) with medians and 95% (CIs): 6.4 [4.3, 9.7], 5.9 [4.4, 7.7] and 2.5 [1.7, 3.1], respectively, which are consistently beyond the threshold level.\n\nThe effective reproductive numbers (R\nt) are obtained from averaging over an interval4 and from construction of transmission tree.2, 7 The results from epiestim package9 slightly depends on the length of averaging interval (Figure 3). For example, with averaging interval = 13, 15 and 20 days, the R\nt at day 23 (2nd June) has median and 95% CI as 6.23 [5.04, 7.54], 6.38 [5.18, 7.70] and 6.36 [5.16, 7.68], respectively. As 10th June (day 31) is a day with a delay of mean serial interval 13 days from the breaking point (28th May), in view of Nowcasting method4 that takes censoring into account, we regard the average of R\nt before this date as an estimate of R\n0. Taking the averaging interval of 13 days, the median and 95% CI of R\n0 are 7.15 [5.26, 9.35].\n\nEstimates of R\nt from transmission trees reconstructed are shown in Figure 4. The two methods2, 7 show different patterns in R\nt along the outbreak course: the relative smooth changes for the former (Figure 4A) and erratic evolution for the latter (Figure 4B). The huge variance in Figure 4B indicates the cluster transmissions. For example, three cases have symptom onset on 21st May; the estimate of R\nt on the day has mean of 28 but a wide 95% CI ranging from 0 to 85. The large variation in R\nt can also be seen on 20th May and 5th June. The difference between the two methods is because Hens et al.7 further include the information of infector\u2010infectee pair contacts. Nonetheless, the overall average decline patterns of R\nt in Figure 4 appear similar to those shown in Figure 3. With the fully reconstructed transmission tree, we can easily estimate generation\u2010based reproductive number R\ng. From the sample transmission tree listed in Figure 4, we found R\ng reduced quickly, from initially R\ng = 28 to R\ng = 4.43 with a large standard deviation of 16.2 on the second generation and on the third generation the mean of R\ng became below the threshold level: R\ng = 0.27 with a moderate standard deviation of 1.16. Approximating R\n0 by averaging R\nt before 28th May (the breaking point), the mean and 95% CI are 5.2 [3.3, 7.5] and 6.2 [2.8, 14.6] by the methods of Wallinga and Teunis2 and Hens et al.7 respectively. The two methods obtained the similar mean but quite different variations. The reason is that Wallinga and Teunis2 implicitly assumed that the population is well mixing and that the probability of one case being an infector of another cases is only determined by the gap in symptom\u2010onset dates between the two cases. This difference also reflects the superspread: most infections are caused by a few of infections, while many other infections cause none.\n\nThe transmission dynamics model considers the actual observation that the infected people can transmit infection to others only during the period from symptom onset to confirmation. Correlation analysis (Table 4) shows that the rapid diagnosis through shortening delay from symptom onset to confirmation and self\u2010protection are the main contributing factors to transmissibility. With countermeasures from 28th May, which reflect in both the self\u2010protection coefficient (w = 9%) and shortened delay from symptom onset to confirmation (from D\n0 = 9.3 days to D\n1 = 4.1 days; cf.,33), R\n0 is substantially reduced from 9.1 [5.3, 15.9] to below the threshold level: R\nc = 0.37 [0.25, 0.51] so the transmission is completely under control and stops. The intervention is characterised by the increased quarantine in designated hospitals and self\u2010protection of the public to reduce the contact rate and the quick response to symptom onset for confirmation test with implementation of appropriate isolation procedures.\n\nThe characterisations based on the previous small outbreaks and sporadic cases suggest that MERS\u2010CoV is severe but not very contagious.10, 11, 12 The ROK outbreak caused 185 new cases and lasted about 2 months (Figures 1 and 4C). All 186 cases were put into special care and 38 died in the end. In this study, we applied different statistical estimation methods.7, 8, 9 The estimates from these methods are roughly in agreement with each other and these estimates suggest that R\n0 of MERS\u2010CoV in the ROK outbreak is quite high with mean of around 2.5\u20107.2. Our dynamics models indicate that the transmission process experiences an effectively breaking point at 28 or 29 May 2015 in contact and diagnosis rates. In view of the intervention timeline shown in Figure 1, this effective breaking point indicates that both quarantining close contacts and informing the public the actual situation of outbreak could be the main countermeasures. Before this breaking point, R\n0 could range from 5.4 to 9.1 depending on the day of the breaking point. These estimates well overlap with the statistical estimates. Although being significantly higher than the estimates based on the previous small outbreaks, our estimates are compatible with others on the ROK outbreak16, 17, 18 and also the estimate on the 2014 outbreak in the KSA.14, 34 In view of these analyses, R\n0 of MERS\u2010CoV before the effective intervention can be much higher than the threshold level in the healthcare\u2010associated environment. This result suggests that MERS\u2010CoV is not only severe but also highly contagious at least under the Korean healthcare culture.21\n\n\nIt is well known that the overall transmissibility of MERS\u2010CoV in community is very low.35 Most introductions are not followed by human\u2010to\u2010human transmission or with only limited transmission.36 Occasionally due to a range of factors such as long delay from symptom onset to isolation, long stay in hospitals and visiting more healthcare facilities,37 more extensive outbreaks can happen such as the spring 2014 outbreak in the KSA.14 Naturally if you measure R\n0 in one of these larger outbreaks, it will be bigger\u2014it might be difficult to tell whether or not that is only because you have ignored the data from all the individual cases/clusters which suggest much lower R\n0. The ROK outbreak is the largest outside of the Middle East and has one clear index case. With all the suspected are closely quarantined and monitored in the ROK,26 the chance for missing such individual cases/clusters is extremely low. Therefore, the above results should be robust.\n\nOur dynamics model is simplified in many aspects, such as ignoring the age variation in transmissibility and superspreaders.27, 28, 31 Although transmission was only taken place in hospitals, our model assumes the transmission occurs in the wide population and therefore ignores the setting\u2010dependent transmission. Understanding how these factors impact the transmission process can provide further information for the outbreak. For example, as far as the non\u2010pharmaceutical interventions such as closing mass gatherings and school are concerned, it is important to explore the age\u2010structured population dynamics of transmission. To identify how Korean culture\u2010associated behaviour affects the spread, it is necessary to investigate the spatial and setting\u2010dependent transmission dynamics. Even with these limitations, our dynamics model roughly catches the basic characteristics of the transmission dynamics during the ROK outbreak as evidenced by the agreement of its R\n0 estimate with statistical methods and reasonable identification of breaking point in contact and diagnosis rates. Hence, it should provide useful information for us to understand the outbreak.\n\nOur estimate of R\n0 is different from the previous,10, 11, 12 which appears understandable. For small outbreaks or sporadic cases on which the previous analysis mostly based,13 the transmission processes end naturally without intervention. The ROK outbreak differed from the previous outbreaks in two ways: it was the largest outbreak outside of the Middle East so far and ended under the strong countermeasures.21 Analyses indicate that transmission appears to be amplified in healthcare setting.10, 21, 25, 27, 28, 37Specifically, Chowell et al.12 who modelled the progression of MERS\u2010CoV cases in 2013 concluded that the relative contribution of hospital\u2010based transmission is over four times higher than that of community transmission. This suggests another reason why the transmissibility of MERS\u2010CoV in the ROK is much higher than the previous analyses because all the transmission events during the ROK outbreak were observed to occur in hospitals. This in return lends evidence that the healthcare environment is fertile soil for the transmission of MERS\u2010CoV14 and hints the importance of strengthening hospital infection control programmes.\n\nThe occurrence of the ROK outbreak also reflects the effect of the Korean traditional culture that relatives and friends would like to visit patients in hospitals and patients have freedom to choose \u201cbetter\u201d hospitals.21 This culture and mobility allow infected people to move among hospitals, and increase the contact rates between the infected and the susceptible; at the early stage of the outbreak, this helps the infection quickly spread. This further hints the reason why when MERS\u2010CoV hit Westernised countries only limited transmission was experienced, but only causes a big outbreak in the ROK.\n\nOur dynamics modelling shows that facilitating early diagnosis by shortening the delay from symptom onset to confirmation and implementation of infection control measures such as self\u2010protection and quarantining are efficient measures. Both reflect changes in people's behaviour upon knowing the outbreak situation. The first factor implies quick response and confirmation of the infected people so that the period they can transmit was decreased. The second factor reduces contacts, implying that keeping the community informed the true outbreak situation is important for control. The two interventions (self\u2010protection and quick diagnosis) might be accomplished by different people: the latter can only be accomplished by those who became ill and their close contacts while everyone in the system can change their behaviours to become self\u2010protected. In reality, it is likely that these two effects initiated in separate moments; however, the separate breaking points may not much impact the results as indicated in Table 3: the model variant that assumes only time\u2010varying self\u2010protection performs nearly as good as the best model that assumes time variation in both self\u2010protection and diagnosis rate. Thus, using a simultaneous variation in the two interventions should provide a good approximation to the true situation.\n\nModel simulations (data not shown) suggest that if the public awareness of the outbreak could be made 3 days earlier, the total infected people reduced to fewer than 100. However, the simulations also indicate that if the countermeasures were delayed by 3 days, the outbreak size would double. Therefore, the lesson we learned from the outbreak is to rapidly isolate any suspected infected people who are hospitalised and their close contacts.\n\nLee et al.28 also proposed a dynamic transmission model to analyse the MERS\u2010CoV outbreak in the ROK by explicitly incorporating superspreading events and time\u2010dependent transmission and isolation rate. As they separated the two largest spread spreaders (of R = 80 and 24, respectively) from the whole system, the reproductive number during pre\u2010intervention was estimated to be below the threshold level of 1.0. Nevertheless, it is interesting to notice the followings. Lee et al.28 based on survey22 to assume the date that intervention started was 7 June 2015, and the duration from illness onset to diagnosis reduced from 6 days to 2 days. The inference from our transmission dynamics suggested that the objective intervention started from 28 May 2015, and the delay from symptom onset to confirmation decreased from 9.3 to 4.1 days. Lee et al.28 also assessed the effect of timing of control measures and like ours found that the early initiation of countermeasures can substantially reduce the size and duration of outbreak.\n\nA historical analysis38 indicates the average trend that more than two new species of human virus are reported each year, which was further confirmed by the recent emergence of Swine flu, MERS\u2010CoV, Ebola and Zika. Anticipation of novel virus species must be included in public health planning. Although we cannot predict their severity and transmissibility, learning from the past outbreaks and thus training our public health service system is an important part of our preparedness. One key lesson learned from the past outbreaks of emerging pathogens including SARS, Ebola and MERS\u2010CoV is the setting\u2010dependent transmissibility. For any potentially oncoming novel pathogens, it is hard (if possible at all) to predict their biological properties. The only strategy that can use as countermeasures is to reduce the contact rates such as closing mass gatherings and avoiding any unnecessary contacts. Hence, the knowledge is crucial about what changes in human behaviour and contact patterns help reduce the chance of their emergence and outbreak, or can avoid their rapid and large\u2010scale diffusion among populations. Nevertheless, hospitals are clearly important settings for amplifying transmissibility,37 many of which cases will be hospitalised, thus increasing the risk of exposing healthcare workers and other patients. This highlights the importance of ensuring the early implementation of adequate infection control measures around severe cases to minimise such onward transmission.\n\nOur transmission dynamics model identifies a breaking point at 28 or 29 May 2015 in contact and diagnosis rates. This breaking point reflects the consequence of changes in people's behaviour for self\u2010protection and Korean authority's designated facilities to isolate and quarantine the close contacts. Our estimates of the reproductive number of MERS\u2010CoV before the breaking point are in agreement with others on the ROK outbreak, albeit significantly higher than estimates based on other small outbreaks and sporadic cases of MERS\u2010CoV. The large\u2010scale outbreak in the ROK was jointly due to the high transmissibility in the healthcare\u2010associated setting and the Korean culture\u2010associated contact behaviour. Limiting such behaviour by rapidly identifying and isolating cases and avoiding high\u2010risk contacts effectively stopped further transmission.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\nX\u2010SZ conceived of the study through discussion with YHC, RP, AC, DDA, PB, HK and MB. X\u2010SZ carried out the modelling and statistics analyses. X\u2010SZ, YHC and RP wrote the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final version of the article."}
