{"title": "Increasing the X-ray Diffraction Power of Protein Crystals by Dehydration: The Case of Bovine Serum Albumin and a Survey of Literature Data", "body": "In the past, BSA crystals have been grown by a vapor diffusion technique from 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, 52% saturated ammonium sulphate at 298 K [15] [16] [17] . However, these crystals, which belong to space group P6 with unit cell parameters a = b =148.24 \u00c5, c = 356.70 \u00c5 and \u03b1 = 90\u00b0, \u03b2 = 90\u00b0, \u03b3 = 120\u00b0, only diffract at low resolution (8-10 \u00c5) [15, 16] .\n\nScreening using polyethylene glycol of different molecular weights (2000-20,000 Da) as precipitating agent revealed new conditions for the crystallization of BSA. In particular, thin, small and fragile crystals appeared within 7 days using 30 mg mL \u2212 Various cryosolutions (20% v/v glycerol, 300 mg mL \u22121 trehalose, 300 mg mL \u22121 saccharose) were prepared to examine their ability to cryoprotect the BSA crystals. Preliminary X-ray diffraction data collected at 100 K showed that even the best crystals (Figure 1a ,b) were intrinsically disordered and that the largest ones diffracted at most to 8 \u00c5 resolution using glycerol as cryoprotectant. Application of an annealing protocol failed to improve the crystal diffraction quality. The latter method transiently returns the flash-cooled crystal to ambient temperature and has been shown to improve poor resolution and mosaicity, presumably caused by incorrect flash-cooling [21, 22] . However, as reported in other cases [18, 19, [23] [24] [25] [26] , we found an increase in the diffraction power of BSA crystals by dehydration. A number of different trials for dehydrating crystals have been described in the literature. A comprehensive survey of the successfully used dehydration procedures is reported in Table 1 [18, 19, . The dehydration process has been applied with success to crystals of proteins of various molecular weights, protein-protein and protein-ligand complexes. The resolution of the diffraction data collected from dehydrated crystals ranges from 1.1 \u00c5 to 4.5-5 \u00c5, with resolution improvements that in some cases have been >10 \u00c5; while the solvent content values range from 23% to 85%, with a decrease upon dehydration that generally has been <10%. The values of relative humidity in equilibrium with the solutions of the examined systems range from 74.3% to 99.5%. As expected, the best improvements in the X-ray diffraction power of protein crystals have been observed when the dehydration process has been applied to crystals with the highest solvent contents. Notably, the analysis of the Table suggests that even small changes in solvent content and relative humidity can promote favorable lattice rearrangements that dramatically improve the diffraction properties of crystals, as recently suggested by Russi et al. [26] . These findings underline the importance of reproducible and controlled crystal dehydration, such as that which can be obtained using modern devices available at synchrotron beamlines [86] [87] [88] . The data also confirm that at the start of a dehydration experiment, the relative humidity in equilibrium with the mother liquor is very often close to 100%, in agreement with recent data [89] . a Crystal precipitant information does not include details of buffers and other additives used in crystallization; b Solvent content was not always reported by authors. In some cases it has been calculated from information provided in the text of the paper; c Relative humidity (RH) values have been calculated using the online calculator available at http://go.esrf.eu/RH, as described by Bowler and co-workers [89] . Concentrations have been converted from w/v to w/w using: w/w = w/v density \u22121 , where density values are taken from literature [90, 91] ; d X-ray diffraction resolution at a synchrotron source; e X-ray diffraction resolution on a rotating anode source.\n\nVarious dehydration protocols have been used. The dehydration process traditionally consists of equilibrating the protein crystals over a reservoir with a higher percentage of precipitant [24, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . The hanging drop containing the crystals is then allowed to dehydrate for 12 h to 3 days. The simplest implementation involves dehydration by air [25, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Good results have been also obtained when protein crystals are mounted in a specific and adjustable stream of humidified gas, where it is possible to control the relative humidity [26, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [86] [87] [88] . Finally, crystal dehydration can also be performed by transferring the crystals into a dehydrating solution, which is the original mother liquor with a higher concentration of precipitant [24, 27, or with a different dehydrating agent [49, [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] .\n\nIn the present case, common cryoprotectants, various salts (for example malonate) and different molecular-weight PEGs were tested as possible dehydration agents, but ultimately the most successful experiment was obtained when crystals which were grown in 22-24% w/v MPEG 5K, 0.2 M MgCl 2 , 0.1 M Tris HCl pH 7.8 were directly transferred to a solution containing 30% w/v PEG 8K, 0.1M MgCl 2 , 0.05 M Tris HCl pH 7.8. Crystals did not show any signs of cracking during dehydration. After dehydration and cryocooling, the diffraction resolution of the crystals on the in-house X-ray equipment improved to 3.24 \u00c5 resolution. The diffraction resolution could be even further improved with a synchrotron radiation source. Assuming the presence of two BSA molecules in the asymmetric unit, the crystal volume per unit molecular weight (V M ) is 2.3 \u00c5 3 Da \u22121 , with a solvent content of 47%, which is within the normal range for protein crystals [92] . The solvent content of the crystals was reduced by 3-6% by dehydration. This process also produces a change in their relative humidity from 99.2% to 98.5%.\n\nThe application of molecular replacement, as detailed in the Experimental Section, enabled the identification of orientation and position of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit that gave a satisfactory fit to the experimental data. Refinement of the model, obtained by molecular replacement using phases derived from the structure of HSA is in progress.\n\nThe structural determination will provide a molecular basis for explaining numerous physical phenomena and for future docking and molecular dynamics studies on BSA complexes with drugs and other bioactive small molecules.\n\nBovine serum albumin fraction V and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. and used as supplied without further purification. BSA (80 mg/mL) was dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8. The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient of 36,500 M \u22121 cm \u22121 at 280 nm [93] .\n\nCrystallization trials were performed at 293 K by the hanging-drop or sitting drop vapor-diffusion methods with 0.5 \u03bcL of protein and 0.5 \u03bcL of precipitant solution and a reservoir volume of 500 \u03bcL or using the microbatch without oil method [20] with the same volumes. Initial screens have included systematic PEG/pH and PEG/Ion screens. In particular, we prepared solutions with a formulation similar to the commercially available kits of Hampton Research. More than 100 different conditions were examined. In these crystallization experiments we varied the concentration of PEG from 10% w/v to 30% w/v, the molecular weight of PEG from 2000 Da to 20,000 Da and the pH from 7 to 8. The effect of divalent cations, such as CaCl 2 , ZnCl 2 , MgCl 2 was also evaluated.\n\nNeedle crystals were obtained within 7 days from drops containing BSA (30 mg mL \u22121 in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) 24% w/v MPEG 2K and 0.1 M Tris HCl pH 8. An improvement in the quality of crystals was obtained using different salts and precipitant agents. In particular, well shaped crystals were grown using 22% w/v MPEG 5K, 0.2 M MgCl 2 , 0.1 M Tris HCl pH 7.8 as a precipitant solution. These crystals diffracted to 8 \u00c5 resolution. In all the experiments, standard 24-well linbro plates (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, USA) were used.\n\nA significant improvement in the crystal diffraction quality was obtained by dehydration with PEG 8K. In this procedure, protein crystals were transferred in a loop to a 5 \u03bcL solution containing 30% w/v PEG 8K, 0.05 M Tris HCl pH 7.8 and 0.1 M MgCl 2 for 10 min in the open air. After dehydration, the crystals were cryoprotected by soaking for 5-10 s in a solution consisting of 30% w/v PEG 8K, 0.05 M Tris HCl pH 7.8 and 0.1 M MgCl 2 , 20% v/v glycerol and tested for diffraction quality as above.\n\nX-ray diffraction data (3.24 \u00c5 resolution) were collected at the Institute of Biostructures and Bioimages (Naples, Italy), at 100 K using a Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF generator producing Cu K\u03b1 radiation and equipped with a Saturn944 CCD detector. An oscillation range of 0.5\u00b0 and an exposure time of 55 s were adopted for the experiments. The data sets were indexed, processed and scaled using the HKL-2000 package ( Table 2 ) [94] . The overall R merge was high at 15.4% and the R merge value in the highest resolution bin was 31.9%. We attribute the high R merge value as being primarily due to the large number of weak reflections that were measured and maybe to some radiation damage.\n\nThe structure of the protein was solved by molecular replacement using the program Phaser [95] and HSA as search model (PDB code 2AO6 [96] ). Water molecules were removed from the model prior to structure factor and phase calculations. The solution had an R-factor of 0.39.\n\nFor a long time the X-ray structure determination of BSA has been prevented due to the low diffraction power of its crystals. In this study, new BSA crystals were grown, X-ray diffraction data collected and the phase problem solved. BSA crystals that were initially unacceptable for structural analysis improved in diffraction limit by a process of dehydration. The best BSA crystals diffracted X-rays to a maximum resolution of 3.24 \u00c5. Our results will be useful for numerous scientists who study the interactions of serum albumin with ligands, a field of interest for a great variety of biological, pharmaceutical, toxicological and cosmetic systems.\n\nOur findings and previous literature results collected in Table 1 [18, 19, confirm recent ideas that post-crystallization treatments can significantly improve X-ray diffraction protein crystal power. The analysis of the data does not enable us to define either a more promising dehydrating procedure or a more effective dehydrating agent. Rather, the review suggests that different procedures have to be tried, as the effects depend on both the protein nature and the crystal packing. Despite the high number of positive results, the technique remains little used. The take-home message of this work is that dehydration is one of the procedures that should be included in initial screening as a method to improve or at least modify the diffraction properties of existing crystals."}
