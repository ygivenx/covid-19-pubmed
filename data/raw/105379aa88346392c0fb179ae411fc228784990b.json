{"title": "Impact of Infection Prevention and Control Initiatives on Acute Respiratory Infections in a Pediatric Long-Term Care Facility HHS Public Access", "body": "A single IP&C coordinator worked with medicine, nursing, and environmental services to conduct active surveillance and to develop IP&C policies. Resident influenza vaccination and ARI isolation policies remained consistent throughout the study. All residents without a contraindication (>95%) were vaccinated for influenza. Residents with ARIs (index cases) were placed on contact/droplet precautions until 48 hours after symptoms improved or the pathogen's shedding period passed, if the pathogen had been identified. The IP&C coordinator traced each case's contacts by reviewing bed locations, school rooms, and group activities. Asymptomatic contacts were placed on contact/droplet precautions until precautions were discontinued for the index case. Beginning in 2009, the facility implemented a series of initiatives aimed at reducing ARIs (Table 1) .\n\nThe IP&C coordinator and a trained researcher collected data regarding the incidence of ARI outbreaks and cases associated with each, incidence of total ARIs and of ARIs unassociated with outbreaks, and number of ARI-related transfers to a separate acute care facility (eg, for respiratory distress). Date of onset, symptoms, and diagnostic testing results were recorded. The proportion of staff who received inactivated influenza vaccination was obtained from the facility's employee health service.\n\nARIs were identified using the IP&C coordinator's line list, medical records, in-house pharmacy database, and outside referral laboratory database. Case definitions were modified from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America 2008 guidelines for adult longterm care. 4 ARIs were defined as (1) documented clinical diagnosis of upper or lower respiratory tract infection including pneumonia, tracheitis, and respiratory viral infections;\n\n(2) \u22652 documented symptoms (eg, abnormal temperature, cough, increased secretions, wheezing, vomiting/diarrhea, increased oxygen need, congestion, desaturation); and/or (3) positive laboratory test for a respiratory tract pathogen.\n\nARI outbreaks were defined as \u22652 cases of the same laboratory-confirmed pathogen or \u22652 cases on the same unit with the same symptoms. 3 Cases were considered part of an outbreak if they occurred within the maximum incubation period of the pathogen defined by Red Book. 5\n\nTo analyze the collective impact of the interventions, we used Poisson regression to compare rates (incidence per 1,000 resident days) of total ARIs, ARIs unassociated with outbreaks, ARI-related transfers to acute care, use of viral diagnostic testing, and influenza before (January 2009-March 2012) and after (April 2012-May 2015) full implementation of the IP&C changes. Cases per outbreak were compared using the Student's t test. Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\n\nFrom January 2009 through May 2015, 946 ARIs occurred in 251 residents (3.0 per 1,000 resident days). There were 107 outbreaks, with an average of 3.7 infections per outbreak. Of 549 ARIs, 58% were single infections unassociated with outbreaks. ARI-related transfers to acute care occurred 219 times; 39 of these resulted in hospitalizations. Laboratory testing was performed for 475 ARIs (50%). Tests included direct fluorescent antibody (n = 176), viral culture (n = 159), and/or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (n = 111). Test type was unknown for 201 samples (42%). Viral pathogens were identified for 267 ARIs (56%) and included parainfluenza (n = 75; 28%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (n = 56; 21%), influenza (n = 47; 16%), human metapneumovirus (n = 40; 15%), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 34; 13%), coronavirus (n = 7; 3%), and 2 cases (1%) had \u22651 virus. One resident died due to adenovirus. Table 2 describes differences in ARI outcomes before and after implementation of the new policies. While the rates of total ARI and outbreaks increased (P < .01 and P = .20, respectively), the proportion of infections associated with outbreaks and the average number of cases per outbreak decreased (P < .01 and P = .17, respectively). Staff vaccination increased from an average of 65% during 2009-2013 (range, 44%-77%) to an average of 97% during 2013-2015 (range, 96%-98%), and incidence of influenza in residents decreased significantly.\n\nWe detected increases in ARIs and outbreaks after implementing IP&C initiatives, including a respiratory illness algorithm, enhanced screening for visitors and staff, mandatory staff influenza vaccination, and an 83% increase in facility size, which increased space between residents. We suspect that the observed increase may be due to greater case detection from improved surveillance and testing. Another contributing factor may be the doubling of mechanical ventilation beds after facility expansion, which elevated the average severity of illness among residents. We detected higher rates of ARI versus adult long-term care, 3.0 versus 1.2 ARIs per 1,000 resident days, respectively. 7 This result is not surprising considering the immunologic immaturity and behavioral characteristics of pediatric patients. Pathogens identified in our facility are similar to those reported by other pLTCFs, including influenza and adenovirus. 8, 9 Although ARIs increased overall, the rate of single infections unassociated with outbreaks increased and outbreak size decreased, suggesting that IP&C initiatives successfully curtailed the spread of ARIs. Because complete ARI prevention is likely infeasible, focusing on limiting transmission may have a strong impact on reducing resident morbidity, mortality, and facility-wide disruption of services due to isolation. Influenza rates also decreased significantly, likely due to high compliance with the staff vaccination policy. The respiratory illness algorithm was intended to reduce acute care transfers by providing information to help manage residents within the facility. However, no change was observed, possibly because 44% of the assays performed did not detect viral pathogens.\n\nBecause IP&C changes were implemented sequentially during a short period, it was impossible to isolate the effects of any single initiative. Detection bias likely resulted from enhanced surveillance and greater use of more sensitive and specific tests. Furthermore, consistent ARI documentation in this population is challenging due to the lack of pLTCFspecific case definitions. 10 High nursing turnover during facility expansion and turnover in the IP&C coordinator role may also have confounded our results. Nevertheless, our findings support the use of mandatory staff influenza vaccination and suggest that factors such as increased space between residents and heightened ARI symptom monitoring among staff may limit transmission within the facility once a case occurs.
