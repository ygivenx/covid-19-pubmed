{"title": "Sequence Comparison of the N Genes of Five Strains of the Coronavirus Mouse Hepatitis Virus Suggests a Three Domain Structure for the Nucleocapsid Protein", "body": "To obtain information about the structure and evolution of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), we determined the entire nucleotide sequences of the N genes of MHV-A59, MHV-3, MHV-S, and MHV-1 from cDNA clones. At the nucleotide level, the N gene sequences of these viral strains, and that of MHV-JHM, were more than 92% conserved overall. Even higher nucleotide sequence identity was found in the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of the five strains, which may reflect the role of the 3' UTR in negative-strand RNA synthesis. Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, singlestranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that are important respiratory, neurologic, and enteric pathogens for humans and domestic animals (1) . Having the largest genomic coding capacities among RNA viruses (at least 27 kb) as well as a unique strategy of RNA replication, coronaviruses represent very unusual and interesting molecular biological entities (2, 3) . To gain insight into the roles played by the coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein during viral infection, we have been characterizing this protein in the well-studied coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV).\n\nOne approach to understanding protein structure and function is to chart evolutionarily permissible changes among closely related proteins. To this end, we have cloned and sequenced the N genes of four strain's of MHV: MHV-A59, MHV-3, MHV-S, and MHV-1. Although closely related, these viruses have distinct histories, most notably, separate times and geographic loci of isolation and different mouse strains of origin (4-7). As well, the N proteins of these MHV strains exhibit considerable electrophoretic mobility variation on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophore- Multiple cDNA clones, prepared from poly(A)-containing RNAfrom infected mouse 17 clone 1 cells, were used to determine the nucleotide sequences of the N genes of MHV-A59, MHV-1, MHV-3, and MHV-S. MHV-A59 was taken as our reference strain because its sequence had been previously reported (11, 12) and because our heat-stable variant of this strain is the parent of a number of temperature-sensitive mutants that we plan to characterize in future work (L. S. Sturman et a/., manuscript in preparation).\n\nWith the exception of the final 7 1 nt of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR, see : T was read on four clones and A on one clone; nt 1279 of MHV-3, T on five clones and C on one clone; nt 69 of MHV-S, A on three clones and T on one clone; nt 293 of MHV-S, C on three clones and T on one clone; nt 4 16 of MHV-S, C on three clones and T on one clone; nt 638 of MHV-S, A on four clones and G on one clone; and nt 134 of MHV-1, G on two clones and T on one clone. Thus, for these seven nucleotides, the bases given in Fig. 1 represent consensus sequences. The apparent disagreements at these positions most likely reflect the error rate either of the MHV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which generated the original transcripts, or of reverse transcriptase, which was used in the construction of the cDNA clones. An alignment of the four determined MHV nucleotide sequences, together with the previously reported N gene sequence of MHV-JHM (16), is presented in Fig.  1 . All five N genes are more than 92% homologous.\n\nIn pair-wise comparisons, the two most similar sequences are those of MHV-A59 and MHV-3; the most distant are those of MHV-1 and either MHV-A59 or MHV-3 (Table 1). The greatest densities of nucleotide differences among the N genes are in two regions corresponding tont414-486andnt 1141-1214oftheMHV-A59sequence. For the most distant strains, 50% of the nucleotide differences are clustered in these segments, which, combined, represent less than 8010 of either sequence. By contrast, the most conserved portion of the N genes occurs in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), which diverge by no more than 3 nt over a total span of 301 nt. This degree of sequence identity, which exceeds that of any portion of the N gene coding region, may reflect some functional constraint on the 3' UTR, which presumably acts as a recognition site for the viral RNA polymerase during negative-strand RNA synthesis An alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the N proteins of the five MHV strains is shown in Refs. (8-10)) probably reflect differences in amounts of bound SDS or residual secondary structure under the conditions of SDS-PAGE.\n\nAlternatively, the variation in electrophoretie mobilities may indicate different types or extents of post-translational modification. All five N proteins possess at least 94% sequence identity in pairwise comparisons ( Table 1) . All have the salient features noted previously for N of MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM: a large excess of basic residues over acidic residues (calculated pl's of 10.4-l 0.6); numerous serine residues, some of which are potential phosphorylation targets (17, 18) ; and an acidic carboxy terminus, in contrast to the rest of the molecule (11, 16) .\n\nAs with the nucleotide sequences, the divergences among the amino acid sequences are clustered in two regions, corresponding to amino acids 140-l 62 and Fig. 3 , suggests a model for the MHV N protein in which three conserved structural domains (basic, basic, and acidic) are tethered to each other by two regions of variable amino acid composition (designated A and 6). We suggest that A and B have less constraint on their amino acid sequences and principally serve as spacers connecting the three conserved domains. In contradistinction, domains I, II, and III appear to tolerate few amino acid changes, implying that most changes in these regions impair the functioning of the molecule. This model is supported by two further observations. First, we have characterized a temperature-sensitive N protein mutant of MHV-A59 that has a deletion almost exactly coincident with spacer B, indicating that, at least at the permissive temperature, the presence of this region is not absolutely required for N protein function (C. A. Koetzner et a/., unpublished results). Second, in an in vitro assay system, domains I and III were found to be dispensible for the binding of N protein to RNA, suggesting that the RNA-binding characteristic of N resides in domain II (P. S. Masters, manuscript in preparation).\n\nThus, the domains inferred from our amino acid sequence comparison may be functionally separable as well as structurally distinct.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the nonconserved residues in spacers A and B tend to vary among a limited set of two or three alternatives (Fig. 2 ). This might have suggested that these two regions are required to vary coordinately: i.e., an \"A59-like\" spacer A must always pair with an A59-like spacer B and a \"JHM-like\" spacer A must always pair with a JHM-like spacer B. However, the N protein of MHV-S clearly rules out this possibility, since this N protein has a JHM-like spacer A and an A59-like spacer B (Figs. 2 and 3) . Thus, the MHV-S N gene is likely to have arisen from a recombination event between two ancestral viruses: one having an N gene more similar to MHV-A59 and MHV-3 and the other having an N gene more similar to MHV-1 and MHV-JHM. RNA recombination among murine coronaviruses has been shown to occur both in tissue culture and in the brains of doubly infected animals (19, 20) . All five N gene sequences compared here, then, appear to be accounted for by either drift or recombination plus drift from two prototype genes.\n\nFour of the five MHV genes in Fig. 1 contain a potentially significant internal open reading frame (ORF) in the +l reading frame relative to the N protein ORF, beginning at nt 65 and terminating at nt 688. In each case, the protein encoded by this ORF is 207 residues in length (22.6-22.9 kDa) and is distinguished by a large excess of basic residues (calculated pl's of 10.6-1 1.1) as well as a relatively high (17Oh) leucine content (Fig. 4) . The MHV-JHM N gene contains a very similar ORF in the same position, but this is interrupted by a stop codon following the 16th amino acid residue. For all of the N genes, the start codon for the internal ORF occurs in a strong context for translation initiation, whereas the N protein start codon (nt l-3) and an intervening start codon (nt 26-28) both fall in suboptimal contexts. Thus, it is possible that the internal ORF may be translated by means of a \"leaky scanning\" mechanism (21) . Leucine-rich internal ORFs also have been noted within the N genes of bovine coronavirus (22) whether any of them are actually synthesized in coronavirus-infected cells."}
