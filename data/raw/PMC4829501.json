{"title": "Epidemiology and vaccine of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in China: a\nmini-review", "body": "Since 1966, the occurrence of pig diarrheal disease has been recorded in China. The disease\nshowed a local endemic tendency with significant seasonal variations, usually occurring from\nthe end of October to early February, and PEDV was confirmed to be the cause of such\noutbreaks in 1984 [43]. After PEDV infections in the\npig population were confirmed, a series of investigations of PED occurrence were conducted\nin China. Ji et al. (1987) reported that in farms with PEDV outbreaks, the\nPEDV incidence was 80% in sows, 100% in suckling pigs and 90% in fattening pigs [18]. Wang et al. (1989) reported that\namong cases of PED in 1989, the PEDV incidence was 95% in fattening pigs, 60.4% in sows,\n78.95% in boars and 100% in suckling pigs (with a mortality rate of 87.9%) [39]. These data suggest that PEDV infections were present\nin the pig population in China during PED occurred in Europe. However, before 2010, PEDV\ninfections were mostly sporadic or locally endemic, with no large-scale outbreaks in\nChina.\n\nAfter the PEDV outbreaks in 2010, detailed studies of the molecular epidemiology and\nevolution of PEDV were conducted in China, which led to the accumulation of a large amount\nof data (Table 1). From February 2011 to March 2014, a long-term investigation showed that PEDV\nwas circulating in 29 provinces in China, excluding Tibet and Hainan (Fig. 1A); the positive rates of samples varied from 61.10% to 78.49%, and the positive rates\nof pig farms varied from 71.43% to 83.47% (Fig.\n1B) [10, 45]. The positive rates of PEDV in samples or farms were significantly higher\ncompared with earlier PEDV outbreaks in China and other countries. In addition to the PEDV,\nswine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine rotavirus, porcine kobuvirus, porcine\nbocavirus, porcine enterovirus, porcine teschovirus, Lawsonia\nintracellularis and porcine deltacoronavirus have also been found in diarrhea\nsamples from pigs [10, 12, 44]. These data demonstrated\nthat PED occurred extensively among the pig population in China and that PEDV was the major\ncause of viral diarrheal diseases in swine during the recent outbreaks. However,\nco-infections of other intestinal pathogens with PEDV should also be monitored dynamically\nin future studies in China.\n\nThe S1 regions of the spike (S) protein-encoding gene of 99 selected PEDV strains were\ndivided into two groups (GI and GII) in a phylogenetic tree. The GI group consists of two\nsubgroups (GIa and GIb), while the GII group also consists of two subgroups (GIIa and GIIb)\n(Fig. 2). Ten Chinese PEDV strains isolated from 2004 to 2015, which exhibited a close\nrelationship with PEDV strains from Vietnam and the U.S.A., were placed into the GIIa group;\nfour Chinese PEDV strains, LZC, CH/JL/2011, SC-L and CH/BJSY/2011, which had a close\nrelationship with the classic PEDV strain CV777, were placed into the GIIb group, as well as\nearly PEDV strains from Japan and South Korea. Fifty-one Chinese PEDV strains isolated from\n2011 to 2015, as well as 22 selected reference strains that were recently circulating in the\nU.S.A., Canada, Taiwan, Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam and Thailand, were placed into the GIa\ngroup, which exhibited twelve clusters (C1\u2013C12). The clusters from C1\u2013C3 and C7\u2013C10 were\ncomposed of the Chinese PEDV strains; the Chinese PEDV strains from C1\u2013C4 clusters differed\ngenetically from these from C7\u2013C11 clusters. In the GIa group, the genetic diversity of the\n51 Chinese PEDV strains from 2011 to 2015 may be associated with the introduction of PEDV\nstrains from other countries, self variation of the PEDV as one of the RNA viruses and the\nprolonged immune pressure from vaccine or infection. Of the GI group, three PEDV strains\n(Chinju99, Spk1 and KNU-0901) from South Korea and two Japanese strains (KH and NK) formed\none specific GIb group. In summary, the phylogenetic analysis of the S1 region of the S gene\nof PEDV strains from 2004 to 2015 in China revealed that the PEDV field strains circulating\nin China showed varying degrees of variability and that Chinese PEDV strains from 2011 to\n2015 exhibited specific evolutionary lineages compared with PEDV strains from early China,\nEurope, North America, South America and other Asian countries. In addition, the variations\nin Chinese PEDV isolates attracted the attention of researchers seeking to determine whether\nthe PEDV vaccine strain (CV777) can effectively prevent PEDV variant strain infections in\nChina. Several reports indicated that for PEDV field strains, the neutralizing epitopes of\nthe major antigenic protein, the S protein, showed high conservation and were highly similar\nto that of the vaccine strain CV777 [2, 15, 33]. These\ndata suggest that in China, the traditional PEDV vaccine strain (CV777) still could prevent\ninfections by PEDV field strains and provide effective cross-protection. However, the\nprotective effect of the PEDV vaccine needs to be dynamically monitored in future due to the\nincreasing trend of PEDV variants in China.\n\nRecombination of the S gene of coronaviruses has been frequently reported [24, 31]. The PEDV\nS protein binds to a host cell receptor and triggers fusion of the viral and cellular\nmembranes. It is likely that PEDV variants will continue to emerge, because of naturally\noccurring recombination events and mutations in the S gene. To identify possible\nrecombination events within the S gene of PEDV, the S1 regions of 65 selected S genes from\nChinese PEDV strains isolated from 2004 to 2015 (see Fig.\n2) were screened using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP), GENECONV,\nBootscan, MaxChi, Chimaera, 3Seq, PhylPro, LARD and SISscan methods embedded in RDP4. The\nrecombination analysis revealed that four potential recombination events occurred between\nthe 65 PEDV strains from China (Table\n2), and confirmation of the four potential recombination events was carried out\nby bootscan analysis and fast neighbor-joining trees, respectively (Fig. 3). Of the four potential recombination events, one potential recombinant event\noccurred between a GI group strain and a GII group strain, and three potential recombinant\nevents occurred within GI group strains. Most of the GI group Chinese strains consisted of\nPEDV strains that emerged from 2011 to 2015. The limited data demonstrated that recently\nemerging PEDV strains in China exhibited high variability and potential recombination of the\nS gene. In summary, although the evidence of naturally occurring recombination events is\nlimited, possible recombination events between the S genes of Chinese PEDV strains should be\nmonitored by extensive molecular epidemiology investigations in the future.\n\nConventional vaccine: Wang et al. reported that a\ntissue-inactivated PEDV vaccine was prepared using PEDV strain S [38]. Through Houhai acupoint immunization, the active immunization\nprotection rate of the prepared PEDV tissue-inactivated vaccine in three-day-old piglets was\n77.28%, and the passive immunization protection rate was 97.06%, while the immunization\nprotection period was six months. Improving the tissue-inactivated PEDV vaccine involves a\ncomplicated preparation process, high production cost, high time requirement and quality\ncontrol problems. Ma et al. adapted PEDV strain CV777 to Vero cells and\nsuccessfully performed continuous passages by adding trypsin to the culture medium [27]. An inactivated PEDV vaccine was prepared using the\ncultures of 28th passage viruses [27]. Through Houhai\nacupoint immunization, the active immunization protection rate in piglets was 85.19%, and\nthe passive immunization protection rate was 85.0%. However, inactivated PEDV vaccines still\nexhibited some limitations, including the need for high immunization doses and multiple\nbooster immunizations, as well as short immunity durations. Tong et al.\nreported that an attenuated PEDV vaccine strain (a 90th generation cloned virus strain) was\nsuccessfully prepared by serial passage in vitro [36]. Through Houhai acupoint immunization, the attenuated PEDV vaccine\nhad a 95.52% active immunization protection rate and a 96.2% passive immunization protection\nrate in three- to six-day-old piglets.\n\nOn the basis of inactivated PEDV cell cultures, Ma et al. prepared an\ninactivated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine [26].\nTong et al. prepared an attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine based on\nthe attenuated PEDV vaccine [37]. The inactivated,\nbivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine (1999 to present) and the attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV\nvaccine (2003\u20132006) are extensively used in the Chinese pig population, and they play\nimportant roles in the control of TGEV and PEDV infections. After the outbreak of PED at the\nend of 2010, there was a renewed demand for live vaccines that could effectively prevent\nviral diarrhea diseases of swine. Based on the attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine,\nFeng et al. prepared a trivalent TGEV, PEDV and PRoV (G5 type) live vaccine\n(consisting of an attenuated H strain, an attenuated CV777 strain and the attenuated NX\nstrain), which was licensed on December 31, 2014, by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture.\nThe results of vaccine clinical trials showed that the immunization protection rate was over\n95%, and the incidence of viral diarrheal diseases of swine in experimental farms was\nreduced from 8\u201312% to 3\u20135% [5]. In the future, the\nTGEV, PEDV and PRoV trivalent live vaccine will serve as an effective tool for the control\nof viral diarrheal diseases of swine in China, especially PEDV infections.\n\nGenetically engineered vaccines: Mucosal immunity plays an important role\nin the immune mechanism of viral diarrheal diseases. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies\nsecreted by the intestinal mucosa can defend against invading pathogens. Oral vaccines can\nstimulate mucosal immunity and produce protective mucosal and serum IgA antibodies, and they\nare an effective method for prevention of intestinal infectious diseases. For PEDV oral\nvaccines, Hou et al. reported that lactic acid bacteria expressing the PEDV\nN protein could activate the production of mucosal IgA and circulating IgG antibodies\nagainst the PEDV N protein [16]. Ge et\nal. reported that recombinant lactobacilli expressing the N protein and the core\nneutralizing epitope (COE) could stimulate the intestines to produce local immune responses,\nas well as systemic immune responses, after oral immunization [13, 14]. Liu et\nal. constructed recombinant lactobacilli expressing the PEDV N gene or the S1\nregion of the S gene, and an oral inoculation showed that lactobacilli expressing the N\nprotein could enhance the mucosal and systemic immune responses mediated by recombinant\nlactobacilli expressing the S1 fragment of the S protein [25].\n\nThe S protein of PEDV is a peplomer glycoprotein that is located on the surface of viral\nparticles, and it can mediate the production of neutralizing antibodies; therefore, it is a\ntarget for vaccine research. However, the S protein is a highly glycosylated protein, and\nin vitro expression of recombinant S protein usually results in the loss\nof immunogenicity. To produce a highly effective PEDV vaccine, Meng et al.\nused a eukaryotic expression vector to construct a DNA vaccine expressing the PEDV S gene.\nThis vaccine was able to effectively activate cell-mediated immunity and mediate the\nproduction of high levels of antibodies in immunized animals [28]. Liang et al. used a eukaryotic expression vector to\nconstruct a recombinant plasmid expressing the S1 region of the PEDV S gene, and they\nfurther constructed an attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium\nstrain that carried a recombinant plasmid expressing the S1 region of the S gene [23]. Currently, although PEDV oral vaccines and DNA\nvaccines are still at the research stage and have not been applied in Chinese pig\npopulations, these studies have broadened our understanding of PEDV vaccines, and they have\nprovided a foundation for the future development of highly effective PEDV vaccines.\n\nRecently, a large number of studies of PEDV have provided an in-depth understanding of PEDV\ninfections in the pig population in China. In particular, a trivalent live vaccine for viral\ndiarrheal diseases of swine has been authorized for use, and it is a powerful tool for the\ncontrol of PED. However, virus variability and co-infections of PEDV with other enteric\nviruses are unpredictable. These factors make it difficult to understand and control PEDV\ninfections. Therefore, future work should continue to trace the variability of PEDV strains\nand co-infections of other enteric viruses, improve PEDV vaccines using variant strains as\ncandidates and elucidate the pathogenicity of PEDV variant strains."}
