{"title": "Rescue of Recombinant Newcastle Disease Virus from cDNA", "body": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus belonging to the Avulavirus genus 1 , is an economically relevant and thus widely researched and surveilled zoonotic agent, which can severely affect poultry farming all around the world. Although not a human pathogen, NDV has also been thoroughly studied beyond the veterinarian field both as a model paramyxovirus and due to its highly interesting, natural oncolytic properties 6 . Research on NDV greatly benefited from the development of reverse genetics techniques for single-stranded, non-segmented negative-sense RNA viruses, first described for rabies virus by Conzelmann and coleagues 2 . A variety of genetically modified NDVs, carrying foreign genes or modifications of their wild type genome have been widely studied ever since. Work with these recombinant viruses has been critical to characterize different virulence factors not only of NDV but also of other relevant human pathogens such as influenza A virus 7 -or the emergent Nipah virus 8 . Furthermore, a number of different studies have explored the use of these techniques to improve the innate antitumoral activity of NDV 6, 9, 10 , mostly by enhancing the immunostimulatory properties of the virus. Other relevant area of research on recombinant NDVs has been the generation of vaccine candidates against other viral diseases such as influenza 5, 11, 12 , HIV 13 , measles 14 , SARS 15 , or that caused by the respiratory sincytial virus (RSV) 16 . Amongst the various noteworthy advantages provided by NDV are the lack of preexisting immunity in human populations, the stability of the foreign genetic inserts, a lack of recombinatory activity and overall a high safety profile combined with the aforementioned natural immunostimulatory properties 17 . It's also noteworthy the potential use of recombinant bivalent vaccines in poultry, protective against both NDV and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses 11, 12 . This may be an excellent way to decrease the chances of the latter spreading from wild to domesticated animals, thus also helping to prevent a possible inter-specific jump of the dreaded avian influenza to humans. Finally, reporter-expressing NDV have been used for the evaluation of innate immune responses as well as the identification of interferon antagonist encoded by multiple viruses [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .\n\nThe rescue process of a recombinant, non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA virus basically consists on artificially forcing a viral replication cycle in a producing cell by transfecting cDNA encoding the minimal infective molecular machinery, known as ribonucleoprotein or RNP ( Figure  2 ). The RNPs consist of the viral polymerase (P and L proteins), the nucleoprotein (NP) and the full-length antigenomic RNA of the virus. This RNA+ antigenome is the template required for the generation of the complementary RNA-genomes, which, also associated with the rest of the proteins of the viral RNP, recapitulates the same infectious complex that a natural virus would release on the cytoplasm of the cell upon infection (Figure 2A) . From this step onwards, the viral cycle can proceed naturally and recombinant virions, encapsidating the modified genomes, will be generated ( Figure 2B) . Remarkably, transfection of the genomic cDNA instead of the antigenomic cDNA greatly impairs or completely abolishes 1 . Because of this, the location of the new transcriptional unit within the genome must be carefully chosen to achieve a balance between expression of the transgene and impairment of viral replication. Insertion between P and M genes has been used the most, though other sites have also been tested 13, 31 . Whatever the insert, the cloning into NDV cDNA needs to follow some rules to generate a rescuable construct: (i) any new gene to be included into the NDV genome has to be under control of the appropriate signals for the viral RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase. These sequences must be added upstream of the new open reading frame (ORF) so the polymerase can recognize the end of the previous gene (GE) and the beginning of the new transgene (GS), spaced by a single nucleotide intergenic sequence (IG). Addition of a valid Kozak (K) sequence to improve eukaryotic ribosomal translation is also recommended for better foreign protein expression 32 ; (ii) efficient replication of NDV, as for most members of the Paramyxoviridae family, is dependent on the genome length being multiple of six 33 ; therefore, any insertion into the NDV has to follow this \"rule of six\". If necessary, required additional nucleotides can be added downstream the new ORF; and (iii) the sequence of the transgene should be checked to find possible GE and GS like sequences which could impair rescue efficiency, transgene expression and/or virus viability. If present, these sequences must be removed by silent mutagenesis. The generation of recombinant full length cDNA following aforementioned rules is the first step in order to efficiently produce a genetically modified NDV as detailed here.\n\nIn the system all DNA constructs are under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter (Figure 3 ). This cytoplasmic polymerase is provided in trans by coinfection with a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA-T7) 34 . Figure 3A show the pNDV-B1 plasmid, which encodes the full-length antigenomic cDNA 5 . Figure 3B shows pTM1 plasmids encoding NP, P and L ORFs. Plasmids pCITE-GFP, which encodes, under the T7 promoter, the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), and pCAGGs GFP 18 , which encodes the same ORF under the chicken beta actin promoter 35 , are used as controls. In this protocol we show the procedure to rescue recombinant NDV from the cDNA of the lentogenic NDV strain Hitchner B1 5 (Figure 4 ). \n\nAfter attaching to the target cell, the virus releases its genomic content into the cytoplasm encapsidated in RNPs. The RNA polymerase transcribes the RNA-genome into the different mRNAs of the viral proteins and into a complementary, full length antigenomic RNA + copy, which is template for the production of multiple copies of the original genome that will be incorporated into nascent virions. (B) During the rescue process, the components of the RNPs (NP, P and L proteins, as well as a full-length, usually modified antigenomic RNA) are provided by cDNA transfection. Upon reconstitution of the antigenomic RNPs in the cytoplasm of the transfected cell, they can produce the complementary, recombinant genomic RNPs and a whole cycle can then start anew, ending with the release of recombinant viruses.\n\nThe full length pNDV-B1 ampicillin resistance plasmid driving expression of the lentogenic NDV strain Hitchner B1 antigenome under the T7 promoter (P T7 ) and the T7 terminator sequence (T T7 ) containing the Hepatitis Delta Ribozyme (HDR) cleavage. The pNDV-B1 was originally designed to carry foreign inserts between P and M genes 5 . Insertion of a new gene (XbaI site) requires the addition of the regulatory gene end (GE), intergenic (IG) and gene start (GS) sequences to allow its functional recognition by the viral polymerase. Expression efficiency of the transgene can be improved with the addition of a Kozak (K) sequence upstream the start codon 32 . The whole cassette introduced into the NDV cDNA needs to have a total number of nucleotides divisible by six to follow the \"rule of six\" 33 \n\nSeveral factors are to be considered to achieve good results while rescuing NDV. First, the full-length cDNA construct to be used needs to be designed to allow the functional incorporation of the new transgenes/modifications into the NDV genome. This means, as stated above, that (i) appropriate gene end (GE), intergenic (IG) and gene start (GS) sequences are to be added if required; (ii) there are no putative GE or GS sequences into the foreign gene, and (iii) the full recombinant genome follows the \"rule of six\".\n\nAs for the rescue process, quality of plasmid preparations, the MVA-T7 stocks as well as proper maintenance of cells are critical. For most of the cases, standard maxiprep purification of the plasmid DNA is enough, although difficult cloning and rescue processes, due to the size or nature of the transgenes, may be improved by purifying DNA through CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Transfection efficiency using Lipofectamine is usually enough for a successful rescue, though other transfection methods such as nucleofection can also be used. In any case, the ratio of the different plasmids needs to be strictly maintained (0.4:0.2:0.2:1 for NP-P-L-pNDV, respectively). Due to the laborious and somehow stochastic nature of the rescue process, at least 2-4 different wells should be transfected per construct to be rescued, and different clones of the same construct should be assayed.\n\nIn the protocol that we have described here, we use MVA-T7 to provide in trans the T7 polymerase required for the expression of the viral cDNA constructs. While this is the standard procedure in our laboratory, it is not the only possible approach. For example, other groups have successfully rescued NDV and other non-segmented, negative strand RNA viruses by using cell lines constitutively expressing high levels of T7 polymerase 4, 37 . The availability of a recombinant vector or cell line encoding T7 polymerase, as well as the specific performance of either approach in a given laboratory, should be considered when establishing anew the rescue system for NDV.\n\nAfter determination of NDV presence in the allantoic fluid by HA, further studies are to be performed to fully characterize the newly rescued virus, such as RT-PCR followed by sequencing of the viral genome, IFA and Western-blotting (WB) to determine expression of the foreign gene (if applicable). Depending on the nature of the modifications that the recombinant viruses are carrying, other kind of biochemical and functional assays could also be needed.\n\nThe rescue of recombinant NDV from cDNA is an useful technique for multiple reasons. First and most obvious, this technique provides with the ability to analyze the biology of NDV, an economically relevant virus for the avian industry, by experimentally altering its genes and regulatory sequences. NDV is a paramyxovirus closely related to human pathogens like measles, mumps or respiratory syncytial viruses, as well as the emergent, highly pathogenic Hendra and nipah viruses; research on the basic life cycle of this family of viruses is important to understand their biology. Beyond basic research, recombinant NDVs have a great potential as vaccine and oncolytic vectos, combining the possibility of carrying foreing genes in their genomes with a well assessed biosafety profile. For all of these reasons, The NDV rescue protocol can be a valuable asset for many laboratories worldwide interested in virus research, vaccine development and cancer treatment."}
