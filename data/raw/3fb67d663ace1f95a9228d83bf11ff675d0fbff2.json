{"title": "Dynamic profile of severe or critical COVID-19 cases", "body": "In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, occurred in Wuhan, China. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] World Health Organization (WHO) declared the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020 , acknowledging what has seemed clear for some time -the virus will likely spread to all countries on the globe.\n\nAs of February 11, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) has officially reported that there are 2.0% (889) asymptomatic cases, 2.3% (1,023) death cases, and 80.9% mild cases among 44,672 confirmed cases. 51.4% (22,981) were male and 48.6% (21,691) were female. 6 In January, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of the SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. 1,2 Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is a distinct clade from the betacoronaviruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 1, 2 COVID-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity. Recently, a report shows that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 shared the same functional host-cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 7 Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors. 7 Another report shows SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2. 8 Since ACE2 receptors on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine are dominant, lung alveolar epithelial cells or enterocytes of the small intestine may be an important susceptibility factor for humans. 9 According to World Health Organization interim guidance on January 12, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection is classified as asymptomatic cases, mild and severe cases of pneumonia, and critical cases of pneumonia (ARDS, sepsis, septic shock). Severe cases of pneumonia are defined as patients with respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory All rights reserved.

However, dynamic profile of COVID-19 infection and risk factors associated with COVID-19 pneumonia is not fully known. Written informed consent was waived due to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.\n\nIdentification of patients was achieved by reviewing and analyzing available electronic medical records and patient care resources. We retrospectively analyzed patients according to WHO interim guidance. 13 Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed as previously described. 14 \n\nA confirmed case of COVID-19 is defined as a positive result on high throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of pharyngeal swab specimens. Samples were collected for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from patients suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection as described previously. 14 In brief, the pharyngeal swabs were placed into a collection tube with 150 \u03bcL of virus preservation solution, and total RNA was extracted within 2 hours using the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit.

After standing at room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube was centrifugated at 1000 rpm/min for 5 minutes.

CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood against day of illness in 10 patients. X-axis represents day and Y-axis represents cells/mm 3 .\n\nThe CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte subsets of patient 1 (P1) and patient 2 (P2) did not recover in the day 15-20 compared to other 8 patients, leading to the PLD till death occurred (Figure 2 , B, C).\n\nAbnormal lymphocyte variables were common among patients with the new respiratory illness known as SARS-COV-2, which has caused a pandemic worldwide. Lymphopenia, the depletion of T lymphocyte subsets, and the PLD may be associated with disease severity linked to mortality. Studies of its effect on various body systems are crucial to the understanding of this disease.\n\nDue to one transferred patient 7 in the study who was from other hospital co-infected with influenza A virus on day 9 of the observation, all other nine patients were tested for 9 additional respiratory pathogens. Patient 1-6 were already treated with oseltamivir and lopinavir/ritonavir at admission and all tested negative.

Patient 1 and 2 were tested positive IgM and IgG for influenza A virus on day 25-30 of observation without treatment of antiviral therapy due to poor renal function.\n\nThe sensitivity of COVID-19 IgG and IgM assay tested on day 15-30 of the observation was 90% and 100% for non-survivors, suggesting that B cell function is still intact in non-survivors.\n\nLymphopenia, in particular T lymphopenia, was common among patients with SARS-COV-2 in the observation. A notable drop in CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts occurred early in the course of the syndrome and was associated with adverse outcomes. The appearing a phenomenon of lymphocyte depletion (PLD) suggested severe adverse outcomes. The outcome observed: 60% had discharged and 20% had die. This study is the first observation of 40% patients co-infected with influenza A virus. Further studies to evaluate the mechanisms of these manifestations may help us to understand full pictures of this disease.\n\nAll rights reserved.
