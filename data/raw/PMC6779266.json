{"title": "Human virome in nasopharynx and tracheal secretion\nsamples", "body": "\nDetection of standard respiratory viruses - The nasopharyngeal and\ntracheal secretion samples received in the laboratory in June, July and August 2016\nwere tested for the respiratory virus diagnostic panel performed in Lacen-DF (Public\nhealth laboratory located in the Federal District, Brazil) by the standard RT-qPCR\n(for Influenza A, Influenza B, Human respiratory syncytial virus, Human\nmetapneumovirus, Human adenovirus C, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2 and\nParainfluenza 3). Those that had negative results were separated and stored in\nfreezer -70\u00baC for subsequent DNA/RNA extraction for HTS.\n\n\nRNA/DNA extraction - Fifty one samples from June, 55 from July and\n39 from August of 2016 were mixed, respectively (one for each month), and treated as\nthree pooled samples. Individual sample had a volume of approximately 0.5 mL (total\nof 20-25 mL of each pooled sample). The volume was adjusted to 50 mL with 0.1 M\nsodium phosphate buffer (pH7.2) with Triton-X 100 at the final concentration of 1%.\nThe solution in tubes were agitated for 1 h in a cold chamber, then, centrifuged at\n4,800 \u00d7 g for 40 min. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged with 20% sucrose cushion\nat 140,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h using Ti45 rotor (Optima L-90K Ultracentrifuge, Beckman\nCoulter, Brea, USA). The pellet was resuspended in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer and\nDNA/RNA was extracted from the resuspended pellet following the instructions of the\nHigh Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), without\naddition of carrier RNA in the lysis buffer. Three DNA/RNA samples were subjected to\nHTS. Next, part of all three samples were treated with DNase I (Promega, Madison,\nUSA) in order to decrease the human or bacterial DNA in the sample for viral RNA\nenrichment. However, due to low amount of RNA after DNase I treatment, all three\nsamples were mixed as one pooled sample for RNA HTS.\n\n\nHigh-throughput sequencing - Approximately two \u03bcg of DNA/RNA and\nRNA samples in RNAStable tube (Biomatrica, San Diego, USA) were sent for HTS to\nMacrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea). The library of DNA/RNA or RNA samples was\nconstructed using TruSeq Standard total RNA kit and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq\n2000 with 3 G scale for each in 100 base pared-end.\n\n\nBioinformatics analysis - Low quality and adapter sequences of the\nraw data were trimmed using the Trimommatic tool v.036.\n15\n Metagenomic reads of each sample were then uploaded to Kaiju for profiling\nthe reads in taxonomic assessment (http://kaiju.binf.ku.dk).\n16\n DNA reads were filtered with BWA v0.7.17\n17\n and SAMtools v1.9\n18\n against reference hg38 (Homo sapiens) obtained from GenBank\nto remove human DNA sequences from HTS dataset in silico. Trimmed\nreads were assembled into contiguous sequences (\u2018contigs\u2019) with Velvet v.1.2.1\n19\n and SPAdes v.3.9\n20\n programs. The tBlastx search (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Blast.cgi)\nagainst the viral genome package (RefSeq Virus, NCBI,\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/) which is implemented in the Geneious\nR8.1 program (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand) was used to identify the contig\nsequences which were viral origins.\n\n\nRT-qPCR using PR21 kit - A part of findings by HTS analysis was\nconfirmed by means of RT-qPCR. The RNA was extracted from original 145 samples using\nthe Magna Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Kit (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland),\nthen a pool of five samples were projected to the multiplex RT-qPCR using the XGen\nPR21 kit (Biometrix, Curitiba, Brazil) for 21 respiratory pathogens (targeting\nInfluenza A, Influenza B, Influenza A H1N1-swl, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus 229E,\nCoronavirus OC43, Coronavirus HKU1, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, Parainfluenza\n3, Parainfluenza 4 , Human metapneumovirus A and B, Human respiratory syncytial\nvirus A and B, Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Parechovirus, Human adenovirus, Bocavirus\nand Mycoplasma pneumoniae).\n\n\nEthics approval and consent to participate - This research project\nwas reviewed and approved by ethics committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences\n(University of Bras\u00edlia), approval letter No. 3.052.443.\n\nKaiju program is used for microbial and viral sequence profiling. For June samples a\ntotal of 87,317 (0.87%) out of 10,007,522 reads were classified as microbial\nsequences including virus; for July samples, 79,050 (0.96%) out of 8,215,186; for\nAugust samples 91,485 (1.11%) out of 8,271,632 and for the DNase I-treated RNA\nsample, 401,596 (61.26%) out of 655,558 reads were classified.\n\nThe analyses showed that nasopharyngeal secretion pooled samples of June, July and\nAugust of 2016 had similar metagenomic profiles in relation to the components of\nmicroorganisms classified found: predominance of viruses\n[Supplementary\ndata (Figure)], followed by bacteria and other\nmicroorganisms, such as Archaeas. However, the higher recovery of viral sequences in\nDNA/RNA samples was considered as misinterpretation by Kaiju program since the later\nfine analyses using BLASTn found that many of the human DNA sequences present in the\nsamples were recognised as DNA viruses due to the similarity of some genomic\nregions. After in silico filtration of the reads by human DNA\nsequences, 77.26% of reads were classified as microbial sequences for June (274,269\nout of 354,975), 81.22% for July (242,730 out of 298,846) and 82.50% for August\n(312,605 out of 378,895). This result showed that the contamination of human DNA was\nproblematic for virus sequence search in these samples. As the human chromosomal and\nmicrobial DNA masked the presence of RNA viruses in the total DNA/RNA samples, the\namount of DNA was reduced by DNase I treatment and the samples were subjected to the\nHTS again as one RNA sample.\n\nAfter this treatment, the microorganism profile by Kaiju program had changed, where\n4% of the sample was viruses unlike the DNase I-untreated samples\n[Supplementary\ndata (Figure)]. It is noted that the main\nmicroorganisms found in the RNA sample after DNase I treatment were bacteria (80%)\n[Supplementary\ndata Figure)]. The main bacterial family\nidentified were Burkholderiaceae, Streptococcaceae, Neisseriaceae,\nVeillonellaceae, Pseudomonadaceae,\nPasteurellaceae, Veillonellaceae and\nMycoplasmataceae.\n\nThe RNA sample was the one that allowed the greater identification of RNA viruses.\nTherefore, the fine analyses of virus identification were performed using only the\nRNA sample, since most respiratory viruses possess RNA genomes. A total of 14,952\nreads was classified as virus organisms. The main viruses identified using the Kaiju\nprogram were of the families Picornaviridae,\nHerpesviridae, Parvoviridae and\nCoronaviridae, with the emphasis on rhinoviruses (Table I). The same viral families were also\nfound in the DNA/RNA sample reads after the removal of human DNA sequences\nin silico, however, with less frequency. Only cytomegalovirus\nsequences were found more in DNA/RNA samples than RNA sample (Table I), probably due to the negative effect on cytomegalovirus\nDNA genomes by DNase I treatment in preparation of RNA sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to low accuracy of the short-read profiling by Kaiju program, the classification\nup to genus level was shown in this table, except for the\nEnterovirus genus, which was the one with the most reads\nfounded, allowing the virus species definition.\n\nTo identify the contig sequences (1,621 contigs assembled by Velvet and 334 by SPAdes\nassemblers) of viral origin, tBlastx search plugged-in Geneious was used for the\nknown virus genome sequences recorded in the RefSeq Virus (NCBI).\n\nThe analyses identified virtually the same viral families/genera found by the Kaiju\nprogram: Picornaviridae, Herpesviridae and\nParvoviridae using contigs generated by both SPAdes (Table II) and Velvet assemblers (Table III). Only the\nCoronaviridae family was not identified by tBlastx in Geneious\n(but identified by Kaiju), probably due to limited sensitivity of de\nnovo contig assembly, although we chose the most sensitive ones, Velvet\nand SPAdes.\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is observed in Table II (contigs assembled\nby SPAdes) that the number of contigs varied from 1 (Enterovirus B\nand C) to 12 (Rhinovirus A), with sizes of\nalignment between 93 and 1,239 nucleotides. The number of reads per contig also\nvaried greatly, from 4 to 2,470 with the highest amount of reads per contig found in\nthe Rhinovirus C species. The e-values from 5.38 x\n10-148 to 1.99 x 10-11 indicates statistical significance\nin the alignments found using the SPAdes as assembler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable III shows the tBlastx results of\ncontigs assembled by Velvet. The number of contigs varied between 1\n(Enterovirus B, C and E) and\n62 (Rhinovirus A) with sizes of alignment between 87 and 885\nnucleotides. The number of reads per contig ranged from 3 to 962, with the highest\nnumber of reads found also for Rhinovirus C. E-values from 1.23 x\n10-152 to 2.33 x 10-11 were also low, showing statistical\nsignificance of the alignment. The comparison of Tables II and III reveals that,\nwhen using Velvet as assembler, more contigs were formed, although with smaller\nlength and fewer reads per contig. But this is important to identify more viruses in\nless abundance, as Human betaherpesvirus 5. Human bocavirus and\nEnterovirus E have been identified using Velvet, but not when\nusing SPAdes as assembler.\n\nThe Rhinovirus sequences showed greater abundance by the presence of reads in the\nsample, especially Rhinovirus C, that presented highest reads\nnumber (observed in Kaiju analysis), and the highest reads number per contig (in\ntBlastx analysis). This shows the relevance of this one virus in these negative\nsamples by the standard RT-qPCR.\n\nThe presence of respiratory viruses in the samples was confirmed by the PR21\nmultiplex RT-qPCR kit, which identifies 21 respiratory pathogens. Coronavirus 63 (CT\n= 30), coronavirus 43 (CT = 22-31), coronavirus HKU 1 (CT = 20-33), enterovirus (CT\n= 33), bocavirus (CT = 19-35) and mainly rhinovirus (CT = 21-36) were found (Figure). The RT-qPCR assay showed the presence of\ncoronaviruses which detection was failed by the HTS Blast analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HTS has been successfully applied in several fields of virology, including virus\ndiscovery, complete virus genome sequence determination, and genomic variant\nanalyses.\n22\n\n\n\nLacen-DF performs diagnosis of the respiratory virus by the standard RT-qPCR protocol\nwith restricted targets, thus, many viruses may not be identified. The samples\nreferred to Lacen are from patients of public and private hospitals with respiratory\nvirus infection suspected, whether hospitalised or not. Approximately 40% of the\nsamples forwarded are negative for the virus detection.\n\nIn this study, Human betaherpesvirus 5, Primate\nbocaparvovirus 1, Betacoronavirus,\nEnterovirus and three species of rhinovirus were found by at\nleast two different types of analyses in samples of patients from the DF, Brazil,\nwith flu symptoms. Human betaherpesvirus 5 (Cytomegalovirus) was\nidentified by analyses with Kaiju and Geneious program, but not with PR21 RT-qPCR\nbecause specific primers for this pathogen were not included in the kit. DNA viruses\nas herpesvirus and parvovirus were also found in the sample treated with DNase I. We\nassume that DNase I treatment doesn\u2019t exclude totally DNA in the sample, thus,\nherpesvirus and parvovirus reads were recovered. Coronavirus was identified with the\nKaiju program but not by the contig analyses by tBlastx. However, its presence was\nconfirmed by RT-qPCR of PR21 kit. Bocavirus (or Primate bocaparvovirus\n1), and Enterovirus was also identified by PR21\nRT-qPCR, Kaiju and Geneious programs only using Velvet, which is more sensitive\nmethod than SPAdes for contig assembly. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was\nfound by PR21 RT-qPCR and many bacteria of the genus mycoplasma were also identified\nusing the Kaiju program. Rhinovirus was identified using all methods used is this\nstudy.\n\nThese variations in results are explained by the differences in specificity and\nsensitivity in each method. For some cases, the limited sensitivity of HTS is\nexplained by mixing some clinical samples forming one pooled sample for the cost\nreduction. Therefore, this sample preparation may mask the presence of viruses in\nlow incidence or concentration. The limited capacity of de novo\nassembly programs is still a main problem in metagenomic analyses. Velvet and SPAdes\nde novo assemblers were used to build contigs in this study\nsince these were reported as sensitive contig assembler for viral metagenomic\nstudy,\n21\n although there was no best de novo assembler concluded by\nthe same authors. HTS was reported to be less sensitive than RT-qPCR for some\nrespiratory virus detection in such reasons.\n23\n\n\n\nRhinovirus was the major viruses found in patients in the DF, Brazil with ILS or SARS\nsamples which were negative by standard RT-qPCR of influenza-like surveillance\n(targeting Influenza A and B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human Metapneumovirus,\nAdenovirus, Parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3). Several studies have shown the importance of\nrhinoviruses in acute respiratory infection in Brazil, especially in children.\n24\n\n,\n\n25\n\n,\n\n26\n A study involving 120 children less than 12 years old in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil,\nfound that human rhinoviruses (HRV) of species A, B, and C were the most frequent\nagents of acute respiratory infections (ARI). Moreover, these agents are also\nassociated with up to 70% of virus-related wheezing exacerbations. The most recently\nidentified Rhinovirus C has been detected in association with\nbronchiolitis, wheezing, and asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalisation.\n27\n\n\n\nOther study made with hospitalised patients at an academic care centre in Southern\nBrazil shows that HRV was usually detected in hospitalised children with respiratory\ninfections and was often present in viral co-detections, mainly with enterovirus and\nrespiratory syncytial virus. Comorbidities are closely associated with HRV\ninfections, and this virus predominates during colder seasons,\n28\n period of which the samples used in this work were collected (winter). In\ninvestigations around the world, HRV, as well as agents causing acute respiratory\ninfections, has its peak activity associated with the colder periods of the\nyear.\n29\n\n,\n\n30\n\n\n\nIn this study, the relevance of HRV in public health in Brazil was again recognised\nand we suggest the inclusion of HRV for influenza-like surveillance."}
