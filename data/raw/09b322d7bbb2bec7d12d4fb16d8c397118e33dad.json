{"title": "RAPID COMMUNICATION Cocaine's Colocalized Effects on Synaptic Serotonin and Dopamine in Ventral Tegmentum in a Reinforcement Paradigm", "body": "Area, (VTA-[Amo]) was studied in freely moving and behaving rats (rattus norvegicus) with in vivo voitammetry (in vivo electrochemistry). The actual detection of the biogenic amines was on-line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Simultaneously, the psychostimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied by infrared photocell beam detection. The results show that cocaine concurrently and significantly increased synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.0001) and 5-1-1\"1\" (.o < 0.004) in VTA. Serotonin changes were accompanied by a notable oscillatory pattern. Importantly, DA and 5-HT changes in VTA were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). Moreover, psychostimulant behaviors induced by cocaine were significantly increased over control values (p < 0.0001). Psychostimulant behaviors were significantly correlated with concurrently changing synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.01) and also with 5-HT to a lesser degree. Additionally, behavioral data indicate that cocaine may exhibit an anxiolytic effect during acute administration because agoraphobic behavior, as shown by increased central ambulatory behavior, was dramatically reduced by cocaine. Summarily, the present findings show that cocaine increased synaptic concentrations of DA in VTA, an action that is correlated with cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior. The DA-ergic effect appears to be tonically maintained. Furthermore, new findings demonstrate a colocalized, cocaine induced 5-HT-ergic effect in VTA, which keeps pace with cocaine-induced alterations in DA-ergic neurotransmission. Thus, 5-HT may be a relay or a gating mechanism for a DA reward signalling pathway for cocaine.\n\nDopamine Serotonin Ventral tegmentum Psychostimulant behavior Reinforcement\n\nIn vivo voltammetry (electrochemistry) VARIOUS types of reinforcement capabilities for cocaine have been empirically and systematically reported during the past 25 years (4, 17, 24, 26, 37) . Furthermore, commensurate neurochemical evidence points to a distinct cocaine-induced mesolimbic dopaminergic influence in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) (10) (11) (12) 23, 25, 29, 34, 35, 44) ; the nerve terminals for discrete neuronal circuits thought responsible for brain reward phenomena (38) . Although early scientific papers debated the importance of a dopaminerglc mediation in somatodendritic ventral tegmental area (VTA-[A~0]) in neurophysiological reinforcement processes (of. (36) for review), a critical paper clearly emphasized a mediation for DA in VTA in cocaine-induced reinforcement (39) . Electrophysiologlcally, cocaine suppresses impulse frequency in VTA somatodendritcs (16) . Since lesions of NAcc and rostral VTA attenuate a cocaineinduced suppression of somatodendritic cell firing (16) , it is thought that both presynaptic nerve terminals and somatodendritic autoreceptors regulate cocaine's action in VTA. Indeed, a current report shows that cocaine increased the availability of dopamine (DA) in situ, in VTA in the anesthetized rat; the report supports the latter hypotheses (7) . Interestingly, cocaine does not act on DA in the parallel A9 somatodendrites in substantia nigra (22) . cesses has historically been empirically equivocal (cf. [43] for review). Provocatively, 5-HT per se has been shown to decrease intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) (47) . Amidst the studies on cocaine reinforcement though, two recent scientific papers have been foremost in demonstrating that cocaine acts through a 5-HT-ergic component (10, 27) . Early on, cocaine was shown mechanistically to produce a potent inhibition of active 5-HT reuptake processes in whole brain (40) . More recent studies, however, have further shown that cocaine inhibits 5-HT reuptake (46) and decreases 5-HT synthesis in the discrete neuroanatomical substrate NAcc (18) . Electrophysiologically, cocaine suppresses impulse frequency rates in vivo and in vitro in the somatodendritic cell bodies for 5-HT; that is, the dorsal raphe magnus (DR) (14, 31) . Taken together with in vivo and in vitro evidence that shows (SC) cocaine suppresses 5-HT release in NAcc (10, 11, 15) , the emerging 5-HTergic role for cocaine is that of a centrally acting agonist.\n\nInterestingly, although DA neurons account for almost two thirds of neurons in VTA (45) , radioautographic evidence with [3H] leucine shows that the majority of ascending efferent 5-HT-ergic projections from raphe nuclei are located in VTA and are further located rostrally in medial forebrain bundle (6) . Moreover, VTA contains high levels of 5-HT and tryptophan hydroxylase activity (41) , and exhibits high affinity uptake for 5-HT (3). Radioautographic (32) and immunohistochemical (42) studies have further shown that VTA contains a dense network of 5-HT axonal varicosities. More recent ultrastructural evidence from light and electron microscopy after intraventricular infusion of [3H] 5-HT, shows that 5-HT neurons innervate DA-ergic neurons in VTA through demonstrated synaptic junctions (20) .\n\nThe purpose of the present study was to elucidate cocaineinduced DA and 5-HT mechanisms simultaneously in VTA in the freely moving animal. The effects of cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT were detected in vivo, sequentially, and on-line with in vivo electrochemistry within a psychomotor stimulant paradigm of reinforcement (48) .\n\nSemidifferential (semiderivative) electroanalysis, a modification of linear scanning electrochemical techniques, was used in vivo with stearate modified graphite paste indicator (working) microelectrodes to detect DA and 5-HT usually sequentially, in two separate waveforms on the in vivo voltammogram. Dopamine was the first signal to be detected in the time course of the applied potential (Eapp), signifying a faster rate of electron transfer for this cation, vis-~t-vis the cation 5-HT. Dopamine was detected in 10-15 s at a peak potential (Eap) of + 0.140 V + 0.015 V. Dopamine was detected without electrode capacitance to detect at the same Eap, the metabolite of DA, 3-4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and ascorbic acid (AA). Moreover, the neurotransmitter 5-HT was detected at an Eap of +0.290 V +0.015 V within 10 to 13 s during each in vivo voltammogram. The electrochemical signal for 5-HT was detected, without interference at the same Eap from either the metabolite of 5-HT, that is, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) or uric acid (UA), which is a constituent of brain with similar electroactive properties to those of 5-HT. One voltammetric scan spanned 60 s. There was an 8.5-min interval between scans. The indicator microelectrode was activated by a 2-min cell deposition before each scan. Nonfaradaic charging current (Cdt) was eliminated in the first 25 s of each scan. Using a medium exchange technique, the analytes, DA, and 5-HT were selectively preconcentrated (conditioned) onto the working microelectrode surface in saline phosphate (PO4) buffer (0.01 M), pH 7.4, in a closed semidifferential circuit, daily for 3 days before its surgical insertion in VTA. This provides a controlled, increased sensitivity, and selectivity for DA and 5-HT detection in the electrolyte environment of the brain. A Ag/AgCI microelectrode served the reference function for the electrochemical circuit and a stainless steel microelectrode served the auxiliary function in this circuit in vitro and in vivo. Detailed procedures for the formulation of each of the microelectrodes in the three-microelectrode assembly are previously published by our laboratory (8) (9) (10) (11) . In addition, specifications for synthesizing the modified carbon paste, which actually constitutes the microelectrode detection device, are published by our laboratory (8) . As shown by others (5), possible stearic-acid electrocatalytic interactions between AA and DA, or possible nucleophilic reactions between glutathione (GSH) and DA, through dopamine-o-quinone (DOQ) intermediates are insignificant in physiological neuronal tissue.\n\nThe neurotransmitters and the behavioral movements of the animal were concurrently detected in vivo in behaving and freely moving, virus-free, male, Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Kingston, NY). The weight range of the animals at the time of study was 290-310 g. A priori, rats were determined free of specific viral organisms, that is, Sendai Virus, Kilham Rat Virus, Reo Virus Type 3, Sialodacryoadenitis Virus, Rat Corona Virus, Toolan's HI Virus, Micro Plasma Pulmonis Virus, Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus, Hantaan Virus and Encephalitozoon Cuniculi Virus. Although rats were group housed in Plexiglas cages (dimensions: I = 21\" \u00d7 w = ll.5\" \u00d7 h = 8\") before surgery, each rat was provided recovery, individually after surgery in a taller Plexiglas cage (l = 12\" x w = 12 ~ x h = 18\"). In addition, rats were treated with physiological saline (0.5 ml) immediately and for 2 days after surgery. Indicator microelectrodes were implanted in VTA-(A~0), under aseptic surgery with pentobarbitai Na anesthesia (50 mg/kg IP: dilute solution); booster injections of pentobarbital Na were administered once after the first 2 h of surgery in one increment of 0. l ml and once every subsequent hour (0.05 ml) to continue to maintain the appropriate depth of anesthesia. Specifically, the surgical procedure consisted of gently inserting the indicator microelectrode into VTA using a stereotaxic guide (Kopf Stereotaxic, Tujunga, CA). The stereotaxic coordinates were from Bregma, AP = 2.8, ML = 0.9, and DV = -8.6 (33) . Importantly, the Ag/ AgCl reference microelectrode and the stainless steel auxiliary microelectrode were simply placed in contact with cortex; they were not actually inserted into a specific neuroanatomical substrate. The three-microelectrode assembly was held in place with dental acrylic (Kadon Cavity Liner, Caulk, Becker Parkin Dental Supply Co. Inc., NY). The total time for the surgical procedure was 3-4 h. Throughout surgery, body temperature was continuously monitored with a rectal probe attached to a thermometer (Fisher Scientific, Fadem, N J) and was continuously maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C with an aquamatic K module heating pad (American Hospital Supply, Edison, N J). The reason for this was twofold: (a) to prevent anestheticinduced hypothermia and (b) to prevent electrochemical Eap shifts, since Eap is temperature-dependent. Animals were provided a period of 7 to 14 days recovery after aseptic surgical operations were performed, although animals were obviously recovered from surgical anesthesia within the same day. Purina Rat Chow and water were available ad libitum and a 12-h, dark-light cycle was continuously maintained for the animals. Each animal was treated with a great deal of care throughout the surgical procedure and throughout the studies.\n\nOn each day of the cocaine study, each animal was placed in a novel copper-enclosed Plexiglas chamber (dimensions: I = 24\" x w = 18\" x h = 23.5\"). The faradaic-Plexiglas chamber provided space for facile movement of the animals, while deterring possible electrical interference. The threemicroelectrode assembly, enclosed within the animal's prosthetic acrylic cap, was connected to a CV37 BAS detector (BAS, West Lafayette, IN) by means of a mercury commutator (Brain Research Instruments, Princeton, N J), a flexible cable, and a mating connector (BJM Electronics, Staten Island, NY). The CV37 detector-potentiostat was electrically connected to a Minigard Surge Suppressor (Jefferson Electric, Magnetek, NY), which was then connected to an isolated electrical ground. Each animal was studied for effects of cocaine (20 mg/kg SC) on its own neurotransmitters, DA, and 5-HT in VTA. Cocaine HC1 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in deionized, organic-free water (resistance 5-10 Mfl). Cocaine was administered (SC) after stable in vivo electrochemical signals for DA and for 5-HT were evident. The effect of (SC) cocaine HCI on DA and 5-HT neurotransmission was studied for 4 h, in keeping with its reported prolonged effects and existence in brain after (SC) administration (30) .\n\nEach implanted stearate graphite indicator microelectrode (200 ~tm; 500 #m [length]) was studied for its pre-and postcalibration sensitivity to DA and 5-HT in vitro in saline phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.4 (0.01 M). Specific details for pre-and postcalibration procedures have been previously published by this laboratory (10) . In vivo electrochemical signals, and in vitro pre-and postcalibration electrochemical data were measured in units of peak area. Peak area was calculated by multiplying the peak height (mm) of each electrochemical signal by the width (mm) of each electrochemical signal at one-half the peak height (mm).\n\nStatistically significant changes between synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT in VTA before and after (SC) cocaine administration were determined by standard repeated measures, analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Statview, Brain Power Inc., Calabasas, CA). ANOVAs were followed by posthoc tests, that is, Fisher PLSD (least square differences) and the Scheffe F test (Statview, Brain Power Inc., Calabasas, CA), to determine hourly statistically significant differences in neurotransmitter alterations. Statistically significant differences were also calculated on the individual time-course data points by 95070 Confidence Limits (CL), setting the p value at <0.05. Changes in DA and 5-HT values after (SC) cocaine treatment vis-A-vis untreated (same animal) controls are presented as percentage of change, to minimize normal between animal variations. Control is represented as 100070. Basal concentrations of DA and 5-HT, as low as 5 nmol and 2 nmol, respectively, are currently possible with this biotechnology.\n\nHistological placement of indicator microelectrodes in VTA were confirmed by the potassium ferrocyanide blue dot method. The precise electrical specifications for deposition of the blue dot in VTA was 50/~A, current in a 30-s time period. Virtually no damage to brain tissue occurred.\n\nOn each day of the cocaine study, each animal was placed in the faradaic copper-enclosed Plexiglas chamber described above. The behavioral chamber was novel to each animal. Moreover, the behavioral chamber was equipped with side-by-side double doors (dimensions: w = 15.75\" x h = 23.5\") to enable a facile injection procedure. A series of infrared photocell beams were encased in aluminum frames around the chamber's perimeter. When activated with an IBM computerized circuit box, these infrared photocell beams detected the animal's position in the behavioral chamber on an x-y axes positional basis. Thus, multiple concurrent measures of the animal's activity were simultaneously assayed. The specific activities of each animal assayed were (a) ambulations (locomotor activity), (b) central ambulations (locomotor activity in the central part of the chamber), (c) rearing behavior (wherein both forepaws of the animal are raised away from the floor), and (d) fine movements (stereotypic movements of sniffing and grooming). The status of the infrared photocell beams was sampled every 100 ms. The system is a modified version of an Activity Pattern Monitor (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). Data were collected as measures of concurrent and separate activities for 10-min time periods.\n\nActivity pattern analysis was also performed. With activity pattern analysis, the various motoric responses of the animal can be teased apart temporally and spatially. With a spatial picture of cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior, the classical thigmotaxic (agoraphobic) response of the animal, that is, the resistance of the animal to venture into the central region of the chamber, was studied. This parameter can discern fear responses in animal behavior (19) and can be used as a measure of anxiety. Statistically significant differences between each of the four behavioral parameters assayed, that is, (a) locomotor, (b) central locomotion, (c) rearing behavior, and (d) fine movements (stereotypy), before and after acute (SC) cocaine treatment (same animal control), were determined by standard repeated measures, ANOVA. ANOVAs were followed by post-hoc tests, that is, the Fisher PLSD and the Scheffe F-test, to determine hourly statistically significant differences. Each behavioral data point was also subjected to 95070 CL, setting the significance level at p < 0.05. Changes in behavioral parameters are presented as frequency data, that is, the actual number of behavioral events that occurred are shown.\n\nIn vivo electrochemical and behavioral parameters were studied for statistically significant correlative value by the Pearson Product Moment Coefficient of Correlation (r) (Statview, Brain Power Inc., Calabasas, CA); corresponding z values were derived from the Table of z for values of r from 0.0 to 1.00 (2) .\n\nA representative semidifferential (semiderivative) voltammogram showing the in vivo detection of the electroactive species for DA and for 5-HT in VTA-(A~0) in the freely moving and behaving rat is shown in Fig. l(a) . Figure l(b) shows the effect of (SC) cocaine at the 40-rain mark after injection; the electroactive species for DA and 5-HT in vivo are equally and significantly increased 118070 above basal values (p < 0.05). .,~. Fig. 4(a) with an activity pattern plot. Additionally, Table 1 shows these activity patterns in the form of a digital readout. The activity pattern analysis, shown in Fig. 4(a) , is representative of the integrated effect of cocaine *p < 0.05, 95e confidence limits of the mean (cf. text for ANOVA statistics). Bold: Hourly mean \u00b1 SE (N = 5) from each accumulated 10 min mean \u00b1 SE (N = 5). Behavioral data are expressed as frequency (i.e., the numbers of behavioral events that occurred are shown). on ambulatory, central ambulatory, and rearing behavior. Each square-shaped, schematic diagram represents the floor of the behavioral chamber. A comparison with representative activity pattern analysis plots from saline treated animals ( Fig.  4[b] ) serves to emphasize the dramatic cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior shown in Fig. 4(a) . Table 1 shows that cocaine (20 mg/kg SC) significantly increased ambulations [ANOVA, F(4, 20) = 38.964; p < 0.0001; N = 5]. Post-hoc analysis discloses that data in each of the 4-h testing periods was statistically significant (Fisher PLSD = 443.249; Scheffe F = 16.513, 18.948, 32.066, and 23.953, hours 1-4, respectively; p < 0.01; N = 5). A greater than threefold increase in ambulatory behavior was evidenced within the first 10 rain after cocaine administration. A fivefold increase in ambulatory behavior was seen in the first hour after cocaine. No statistically significant differences were seen between any of the individual postcocaine groups (Scheffe F-test < 1.716). The data show that a profound increase in hyperactivity occurred immediately after cocaine, which was then followed by a plateau effect.\n\nCentral ambulations (Table 1) were significantly increased by (SC) cocaine [ANOVA: F(4, 20) = 38.366; p < 0.0001; N = 5]. Post-hoe analysis indicates that hours 2, 3, and 4 after cocaine were highly significant (Fisher PLSD = 9.364; Scheffe F = 6.423, 27.877, and 19.846 in respective hours; p < 0.01; N = 5). There was a trend toward basal values in the fourth hour after cocaine. Thigmotaxic (agoraphobic) behavior was dramatically reduced by cocaine, tenfold in the first 10 rain and twentyfold in the first hour after cocaine.\n\nRearing behavior (Table 1) 15 .205 and 6.11 l, in respective hours; p < 0.01; N = 5). Further analysis shows that the postcocaine hourly data did not significantly differ (Scheffe F < 2.037), creating a plateau effect. Rearing behavior was increased by fourfold in the first 10 min and greater than sevenfold in the first hour after administration.\n\nFine movements (sniffing and grooming) ( Table l) \n\nThe present studies are in agreement with previous studies, which show that cocaine increased extracellular concentrations of DA in VTA-(A~0) (7) . However, the present studies further elucidate DA-ergic mechanisms in VTA by assessing cocaine's action on DA in the freely moving and behaving animal, in a psychomotor stimulant reinforcement paradigm (48) . The present data support previous data that DA-ergic neurons in VTA-(A~0) mediate reinforcement processes (39) . The present findings indicate that a tonic-type relationship may exist between the DA-ergic response to cocaine in VTA and time. Such a response may lend an explanatory note to the hypothesis that favors cocaine-induced inhibition of impulse frequency rates by somatodendritic autoreceptor regulation. The data do not rule out, however, the well-known alternative hypothesis, that is, that activation of a negative feedback pathway from enhanced DA at the nerve terminal, can cause a suppression of cocaine-induced cell firing. What may be most contributive from the present studies though, is the actual demonstration that there is an apparent failure on the part of somatodendrites to completely suppress cocaineinduced enhancement of DA, despite a cocaine-induced suppression of impulse frequency. Thus, DA release mechanisms in VTA after cocaine are to some extent independent from somatodendritic cell firing components. Perhaps, such a disassociation could enable cocaine's potent abuse potential. The behavioral psychostimulant effects of cocaine were as ex-pected, as were the highly correlative relationships that were found between DA and each of the cocaine-induced behavioral parameters studied (10) . The capacity of cocaine to cause an anxiolytic response acutely, may also be important in defining its abuse potential.\n\nNew findings show that (SC) cocaine increased synaptic concentrations of 5-HT in VTA. It is likely that the 5-HT-ergic effects of cocaine in VTA are derived from neighboring 5-HT somatodendrites. Supporting this suggestion is reported evidence of a 5-HT-ergic axon fiber pathway that relays efferent ascending 5-HT projections through VTA en route to medial forebrain bundle (6) . Consequently, cocaine-induced 5-HTergic effects in VTA may be influenced by cell body impulse frequency rates. In this way, an increase in synaptic 5-HT in VTA may occur as a negative feedback compensatory response to a cocaine-induced decrease in dorsal raphe firing rates (14) and/or to a (SC) cocaine-induced decrease in 5-HT release in nucleus accumbens (10, 11) . However, another plausible explanation for the present data is that cocaine might induce an action on 5-HT that is localized in VTA. Supporting this hypothesis are biochemical, radioautographic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural electron microscopic data that show or suggest that 5-HT axons not only pass through VTA, but terminate in VTA (3, 32, 41, 42) and/or form distinct synaptic junctions to directly innervate DA-ergic neurons in VTA (20) . Therefore, 5-HT-ergic release and reuptake inhibitory processes can occur within the VTA itself and cocaine may affect these processes either separately or in an integrative fashion. Simplistically then, cocaine-induced 5-HT reuptake inhibition may explain the present data.\n\nImportantly, the colocalization of DA and 5-HT in VTA and the resultant coaction of cocaine on DA and 5-HT in VTA may elucidate new functional implications for its mechanism of action. The present findings provide evidence that the 5-HT-ergic effects of cocaine mimic its enhanced DA-ergic effects. Indeed, both l0 min and 40 min after (SC) cocaine administration, synaptic concentrations of the two biogenic amines, DA and 5-HT are significantly increased to the same extent. Moreover, cocaine-induced 5-HT-ergic changes maintain a positive correlation with the cocaine-induced DA-ergic effects. The data suggest that the oscillatory nature of the 5-HT-ergic response may be modulatory to the DA-ergic tonic response to cocaine. Accordingly, 5-HT may act as a relay or a gating mechanism for DA-ergic circuitry. Thus, cocaine may relay its biogenic amine effects through raphe nuclei. Biochemical evidence of DA neurons in raphe nuclei (41) and pharmacological evidence for a modulation of extracellular DA by 5-HT in nucleus accumbens (13) , in addition to lesioning studies that evidence a 5-HT-DA relationship between raphe and NAcc (21) , would argue for the relay hypothesis. Alternatively, cocaine may gate its biogenic amine effects through a colocalized action in VTA per se. The fact that 5-HT neurons have been found to directly innervate DA-ergic neurons in VTA (20) , in addition to pharmacological evidence that DA neurons might be directly regulated by 5-HT in VTA (3), considerably enhances the gating hypothesis.\n\nThe present paper also presents new findings that the psychostimulant behavioral effects of cocaine were not as highly correlated with cocaine-induced changes in synaptic concentrations of 5-HT, as was the case with DA. Although a mediation for DA-ergic VTA-(A~0 ) cell bodies has been previously shown to be important in the 5-HT behavioral syndrome (i.e., e.g., hindlimb abduction, and forepaw tread) (1), cocaineinduced hyperactivity does not generally assimilate the 5-HT behavioral syndrome and is generally thought to be a primarily DA-ergic phenomenon. Indeed, classical behavioral hyperactivity, even when the 5-HT syndrome participates, has been basically associated with activation of DA systems (28) . The present data support a role for 5-HT in cocaine that may act in a contributory nature, relative to DA, in cocaine-induced locomotor activity behavior.\n\nSummarily, it is likely then, that the DA cocaine reward signalling pathway may consist of impinging 5-HT compo-nents, which may factor into the abuse potential aspects of cocaine use and into subsequent treatment strategies."}
