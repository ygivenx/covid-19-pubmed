After 5 min of stirring, the solutions were cast in Teflon rings (d=2.5 cm) on a Teflon surface, and the films were allowed to dry overnight under ambient conditions. Small film disks (d=0.7 cm) were cut from the parent films and \n\nThe SNAP/CarboSil solution was prepared by dissolving SNAP (450 mg) and CarboSil (1800 mg) in THF (18 mL). The CarboSil control solution consisted of CarboSil (2250 mg) in THF (18 mL). The topcoat solution was prepared with SR (1600 mg) in THF (8 mL \n\nTen wt% SNAP-doped CarboSil/E5-325/SR films were prepared and sent to the University of Michigan hospital sterilization facility for ethylene oxide treatment, which S--5\n\nis a standardized procedure for many devices used in clinical applications. Briefly, the films went through 1 h of preconditioning and humidification process, followed by 2-3 h of EtO gas exposure, both performed at a high temperature (54 \u00b0C) and high humidity environment (40-80 %). After the 1-2 h of EtO gas evacuation (54 \u00b0C), the films were subjected to 12 h of air washes (54 \u00b0C). The amount of SNAP remaining in the films was determined as described above.\n\nAll UV-Vis spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 250 nm -650 nm with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 35, Perkin-Elmer, MA) at room temperature. The molar absorptivity of SNAP in PBS at 340 nm was determined as \u03b5 SNAP = 1075 M -1 cm -1 .\n\nThe characteristic absorbance at 340 and 590 nm correlated to the \u03c0 \u00e0\uf0e0 \u03c0* and n N \u00e0\uf0e0 \u03c0* electronic transitions of the S-NO functional group. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Polarized Optical Microscopy:\n\nFive wt% SNAP-doped CarboSil films and a blank CarboSil film, both without topcoats, were prepared as described above. Optical images were captured by a Leica DMLP polarization microscope equipped with an N Plan 20\u00d7 objective under crossed polarizers in combination with a quarter-wave plate, and were then taken with a SPOT Flex Mosaic 15.2 camera using SPOT 5.2 Software from Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.\n\nBased on the following assumptions that (1) crystalline SNAP is uniformly distributed in CarboSil and that (2) the preferred orientation of SNAP crystals in CarboSil could be eliminated by cutting samples into cubes and rotating the samples during PXRD characterization, the ratio of peak areas (at a chosen 2\u03b8 angle) of a specific SNAP PXRD peak over the total area of the obtained pattern would be proportional to the weight percentage of crystalline SNAP in the sample. In fact, by using the area ratio as a quantitative representation, all the other factors that could influence the peak area (e.g., the volume of the sample irradiated by the X-ray source, the exposure time of sample under the X-ray, etc.) can be eliminated. Here, we set the doped SNAP weight S--6\n\npercentage as and the ratio of the !! orthorhombic SNAP peak area over the SNAPdoped CarboSil pattern total area as ! , and then ! can be calculated as:\n\nFor a PXRD pattern of a sample with a unit volume and taken with a unit exposure time, ! , and correspond to the area of the !! peak in the orthorhombic SNAP pattern, the total area of all orthorhombic SNAP peaks, and the total area of blank CarboSil pattern, respectively. The term ! is the SNAP solubility in SNAP-CarboSil solid solution system in the percentage representation. As a result, for any SNAP-doped CarboSil sample, ! ( \u2212 ! ) represents the area of the !! orthorhombic SNAP peak in the pattern, \u2212 ! represents the area of all signals from orthorhombic SNAP, and\n\n(1 \u2212 ) represents the area of all signals from CarboSil in this sample. Since ! is a ratio of areas, which is independent of sample volume and exposure time, etc., the only factor that influences ! is the SNAP weight percentage in the prepared CarboSil films.\n\nBy substituting various and ! at chosen 2\u03b8 angles (three main SNAP peaks, 2\u03b8 = 9. (excitation = 488 nm/emission = 520 nm) and Propidium Iodide (excitation = 535 nm/emission = 617 nm). Images were obtained using an oil immersed 60\u00d7 objective lens, in which red indicates dead bacteria while green indicates live ones. During the experiment, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) of the rabbit was maintained at 38 \u00b1 2 mmHg for 7 h by continuous IV fluid maintenance. The heart rate average was 228 \u00b1 4 beats/min and no significant change was noted for the duration of experiments.\n\nThe blood gas was measured once every hour and the results were all within the normal ranges. CarboSil. Linear regression lines were fitted using least squares approach. The 3 most prominent orthorhombic SNAP peaks were chosen to do the fitting (2 theta = 9.5 (a), 14.5 (b) and 14.9 (c)) and the calculated SNAP solubility in CarboSil polymer was 3.6 wt%, 3.5 wt% and 3.9 wt%, respectively.
