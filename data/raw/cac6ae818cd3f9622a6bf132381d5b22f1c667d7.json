{"title": "Hapiosamates A and B: New Steroidal Sulfamate Esters from two Hapiosclerid Sponges", "body": "The presence of the snifamate functionality in marine sterols was hitherto unknown and there have been few chemical and spectroscopic studies of sulfamates. The most notable study of sulfamates was that of\n\nMaryanoff and co-workers s on the structure-activity studies of anticonvulsant sugar sulfamates related to topiramate, a synthetically derived antiepileptic drug. Structure-activity studies were also carried out on sulfamate sweeteners in the 1970's, 9 following the accidental discovery of the sweetening properties of cyclamate by Sveda in 1937) 0 Six-membered ether rings are also rare in marine sterols, although the cyclic hemiacetal functionality has recently been described. 5\n\nSpecimens ofXestospongia sp. and an unidentified haplosclerid sponge were collected by hand using SCUBA at Hagakhak and Haningad Islands, Philippines, 1997, and were kept frozen until extraction. Both sponges were processed in the same manner. The concentrated methanolic extract of the Xestospongia sp., obtained by soaking the diced sponge tissue, was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The aqueous extract, which had shown mild activity in the initial screens against prostrate, human colon, colon carcinoma and mouse lung carcinoma, was chromatographed on Amberlite XAD-2 resin, followed by Sephadex LH-20 We initially assigned these signals as an N-methyl doublet at 8 3.61 (J = 11 Hz) but this possibility was eliminated when the HMQC experiment indicated that the two proton signals were correlated to two carbon signals at slightly different chemical shifts. Since N-methyl sulfamates normally give rise to methyl singlets, s we had to account for an N-methyl sulfamate group that adopted two different conformations (see Building on from a basic steroid structure, the structure of haplosamate A (1) The stel~ochemistry at C-24 was assigned with reasonable confidence on the basis of the large coupling constant between H=23 and H-24, which required a preferred anti conformation, and NOESY data. Haplosamates A (1) and B (2) did not possess useful activity against tumor cell lines but were shown to inhibit HIV-1 integrase with ICs0 values of 50 ttg/mL and 15 ttg/mL respectively. The desulfated compound 3 did not inhibit HIV=I integrase. From these results and previous research, m2 it appears that the sulfate groups are important for activity.\n\nGeneral: Optical rotations were measured on a Rudolph Research Autopol III polarimeter. IR and UV spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1600 FT-IR and Lambda 3B instruments, respectively. The tH, G(radient)COSY, GHMQC and GHMBC spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 300 MHz spectrometer and the 13C and DEPT experiments on a Varian Gemini 400 MHz spectrometer. The GHMBC experiment was recorded twice withjnxh set at 8 and 4 ~ All NMR dst~ were recorded in CD3OD. HRMS were obtained from the UC Riverside Regional Mass Spectrometry Facility. All solvents were distilled prior to use. All TLC was carried out on silica gel 60 F254 aluminium sheets with 12:3:5 butanol:acetic acid:water as eluent, and visualized with 2N cerium sulfate in H2SO 4.\n\nAnimal Material: The sponges NCI 2350 (Xestospongia sp.) and NCI 2418 (unknown genus) were collected by hand using SCUBA at a depth of 10-17 m at Hagakhak Island (SSW Dinagat Island), Philippines, and Haningad Island, Philippines, respectively, in May 1997. Voucher specimens have been deposited in the SIO Benthic Invertebrate Collection as P1177 and P1178, respectively. The sponges were frozen immediately after collection, and kept frozen until extracted.\n\nExtraction and Purification: Two contrasting extraction procedures were used for the unknown sponge (NCI 2418) but only the first procedure was used to extract Xestospongia sp. (NCI 2350), with very similar results to those reported for NC12418.\n\nIn the first procedure, frozen sponge (290 g wet wt.) was diced and extracted with MeOH (3 x IL). The combined methanol extracts were concentrated and partitioned between 1:1 ethyl acetate/water (2 x 300 mL). At this stage it was already obvious from the IH NMR spectra of the crude extracts that the aqueous extracts of both sponges were very similar. The aqueous extract was lyophilized and then chromatographed on a Cis SepPak using a gradient elution of 100% water to 100% methanol as eluent. Fractions obtained with 30% and 70-80% methanol were further purified using countercurrent chromatography with CHCI3/MeOH/H20 (4:4:2) as eluent, followed by column chromatography with TSK HW40F gel (ToSoHaas) to obtain haplosamate B (2, 8mg, 2.8 x 10 .3 % wet wt.) and haplosamate A (1, 104 mg, 0.04 % wet wt.). From NC12350 (290 g wet wt.), we obtained haplosamate B (2, 1 lmg, 3.8 x 10 .3 % wet wt.) and haplosamate A (1, 120 rag, 0.04% wet wt.).\n\nIn the second procedure, the frozen sponge (297 g wet wt.) was again diced and extracted with methanol (3 x 1L). The combined methanol extracts were concentrated and partitioned between 1:1 ethyl acetate/water. The aqueous extract was lyophilized, then re-dissolved in water (25 ml) and chromatographed on Amberlite XAD-2 resin with copious amounts of water as eluent. The eluent was then changed to 100% methanol and the column washed thoroughly until no further color remained. The methanolic wash was concentrated under vacuum and then chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 (2:1 methanol/water as eluent) followed by chromatography on TSK HW40F gel with l:l methanol/water as eluent to give haplosamate B (2, 26mg, 8.8 x l0 \"3 % wet wt.) and haplosamate A (1, 122mg, 0.04 % wet wt.).\n\nHaplosamateA (1) "}
