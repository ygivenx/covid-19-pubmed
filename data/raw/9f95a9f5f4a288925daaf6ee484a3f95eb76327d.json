{"title": "Expression of the Native Cholera Toxin B Subunit Gene and Assembly as Functional Oligomers in Transgenic Tobacco Chloroplasts", "body": "There is currently much enthusiasm for the potential of genetically engineered plants to help control human and animal diseases, through production of edible vaccines. 1, 2 Plants expressing bacterial and viral antigens as nuclear transgenes are capable of triggering immune responses when the transgenic tissues are administered orally. 3 \u00b1 6 Indeed, it has been suggested that plant cells containing an oral vaccine may actually potentiate vaccine activity by protecting against premature digestion of the antigen. 7 Despite this promise, transgenes expressed via the nucleus often yield insuf\u00aecient antigen levels, reported as total soluble protein (TSP) or fresh weight (FW): B subunits of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (0.01 % TSP), 3 hepatitis B virus envelope surface protein (0.01 % TSP) 8, 9 (0.01 % FW), 6 ,}10 human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B (0.02 % TSP), 11 and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus glycoprotein S (0.06 % TSP). 12 Therefore, one ever-present mission is to increase the level of transgene expression within transgenic plants. 7 Cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) is a candidate oral subunit vaccine for cholera, a disease that causes acute watery diarrhea by colonizing the small intestine and producing the enterotoxin, cholera toxin (CT). Cholera toxin is a hexameric AB 5 protein consisting of one toxic 27 kDa A subunit having ADP ribosyl transferase activity and a nontoxic pentamer of 11.6 kDa B subunits that binds to the A subunit and facilitates its entry into the intestinal epithelial cells. When administered orally, CTB is a potent mucosal immunogen; 13 this is believed to be a result of CTB binding to eukaryotic cell surfaces via GM1 ganglioside receptors present on the intestinal epithelial surface, eliciting a mucosal immune response to pathogens and enhancing the immune response when coupled chemically to other antigens. 14, 15 The B subunits of enterotoxigenic E. coli (LTB) and cholera toxin of Vibrio cholerae genes have been expressed at different levels via the plant nucleus. When the native LTB gene was expressed via the tobacco nuclear genome, LTB accumulated at levels less than 0.01 % of the total soluble leaf protein. 3 To improve LTB expression, a synthetic gene was created that contained plant-preferred codons and eliminated potential mRNA processing signals and destabilizing motifs found in the native gene. 16 Using the native CTB gene for comparison, the synthetic gene increased antigen accumulation in leaves and tubers by threefold to 14-fold. 7, 16 However, extensive codon modi\u00aecation of genes is laborious and expensive. One of the consequences of these constitutively expressed high LTB levels was the stunted growth of transgenic plants that was eventually overcome by tissue-speci\u00aec expression in potato tubers. 16 By altering the native CTB gene to code for a C-terminal SEKDEL sequence, which targets expression to the endoplasmic reticulum, CTB expression of up to 0.3 % TSP was achieved in auxin-induced potato tissues via the nuclear genome. 17 Increased expression levels of several proteins have been attained by expressing foreign proteins in chloroplasts of higher plants. 18 \u00b1 20 Recently, human somatotropin (7 % TSP) 21 and antimicrobial peptides (21 % TSP) 22 have been expressed in transgenic chloroplasts. The accumulation levels of the Bt Cry2Aa2 operon in tobacco chloroplasts were as high as 46.1 % of the total soluble plant protein. 23 Besides the ability to express polycistrons, another advantage of chloroplast transformation is the lack of recombinant protein expression in pollen of chloroplast transgenic plants. 23 Absence of chloroplast DNA in the pollen of most crops reduces pollen-mediated outcross of transgenes. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Also, stable incorporation of the CTB gene into spacer regions between functional genes of the chloroplast genome by homologous recombination eliminates the``position effect'' frequently observed in nuclear transgenic plants. Lack of gene silencing in chloroplasts should allow uniform expression levels in different transgenic lines. Integration of the transgene into chloroplast genomes should result in a high level of CTB gene expression, since each plant cell contains up to 10,000 copies of the plastid genome. 27 Similar to the endoplasmic reticulum, the production of CTB in chloroplasts allows formation of disul\u00aede bridges, 21, 28, 29 which are necessary for the correct folding and assembly of the CTB pentamer. 30 Here, we report that integration of the CTB gene into the tobacco chloroplast genome results in high levels of CTB accumulation and assembly of functional oligomers in chloroplasts. This eliminates the need to modify the CTB gene for optimal expression in plants. Furthermore, since the quaternary structure of many proteins is essential for their function, this investigation demonstrates the potential for other foreign multimeric proteins to be expressed and assembled properly in the chloroplast.\n\nVector construction and E. coli expression\n\nThe pLD-LH-CTB (Figure 1 (a)) vector integrates the genes of interest into the inverted repeat regions through homologous recombination events between the trnI and trnA chloroplast border sequences of the transformation vector and the corresponding homologous sequences of the chloroplast genome. Unique advantages of integration of foreign genes at this site include accomplishment of homoplasmy in the \u00aerst round of selection due to the presence of a complete chloroplast origin of replication within the\u00afanking sequence 31, 32 and doubling the copy number of foreign genes per cell. The chimeric aminoglycoside 3 H adenylyltransferase (aadA) gene, conferring resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin, and the CTB gene downstream of it are driven by the constitutive promoter of the rRNA operon (Prrn), each with individual ribosome-binding sites (GGAGG), and the foreign transcripts are stabilized by the psbA3 H untranslated region. Since the protein synthetic machinery of chloroplasts is similar to that of E. coli, 33 CTB expression of the pLD-LH-CTB vector was initially tested in E. coli. Western blot analysis of sonicated E. coli cell extracts showed the presence of 11 kDa CTB monomers, similar to commercially available CTB (Figure 2 (a)), when blots were probed with rabbit anti-cholera serum. Oligomeric expression of CTB was not observed in E. coli, as expected, due to the absence of a leader peptide sequence present in the native CTB gene that normally directs the CTB monomer into the periplasmic space allowing for concentration and oligomeric assembly. Inability of E. coli to form dis-ul\u00aede bridges in the cytosol is a major limitation in large-scale production of this antigen.\n\nFive bombardments resulted in 68 independent transformation events. Each transgenic clone was subjected to a second round of spectinomycin selection and putative chloroplast transformants were con\u00aermed by PCR screening. Primers were designed to determine whether the integration of foreign genes had occurred in the chloroplast genome at the directed site by homologous recombination. The strategy employed was to land one primer (3P) on the native chloroplast genome adjacent to the point of integration and the second pri- Primer 5P lands on the aadA gene and 2M lands on the trnA\u00afanking sequence, generating a 1.9 kb fragment. (b) PCR analysis: primers 3P 3M generated PCR products using total plant DNA as template. Lane 1, molecular mass marker; lane 2, untransformed plant; lanes 3-12, PCR products with DNA template from independent transgenic lines 1-10. (c) PCR analysis: primers 5P 2M generated PCR products using total plant DNA as template. Lane 1, untransformed plant; lane 2, molecular mass marker; lanes 3-5, PCR products with DNA template from independent transgenic lines 1-3 and 5-10, lanes 3-11. mer (3M) on the aadA gene (Figure 1(a) ). The presence of the 1.65 kb PCR product in nine out of the ten putative transgenics screened, con\u00aermed the site-speci\u00aec integration of the gene cassette into the chloroplast genome (Figure 1(b) ). The putative transgenic line 4 (lane 6) is a spontaneous mutant. Such mutations occur in the 16 S rRNA gene and confer high levels of spectinomycin resistance. 34 Nuclear transformants resulting from integration of the aadA gene downstream of functional promoters do not confer high levels of spectinomycin resistance and are therefore eliminated in the selection process. To demonstrate the presence of the CTB gene in the transgenic lines 1-3 and 5-10, an additional PCR was performed using a primer (5P) that lands upstream of the CTB gene, on the aadA gene, and one (2M) that lands downstream of the CTB gene, on the trnA gene (Figure 1(c) ). The presence of the 1.9 kb PCR product from all the transgenic lines analyzed veri\u00aees the expected integration of the CTB gene in tandem with the aadA gene.\n\nSouthern blot analysis of three PCR positive transgenic lines (T 0 ) was done to verify site-speci\u00aec integration and to establish copy number. In the chloroplast genome, BglII sites\u00afank the chloroplast border sequences 5 H of 16 S rRNA and 3 H of the trnA region (Figure 3(a) ). Either a 6.17 kb or a 4.47 kb fragment from transformed or untransformed plants was obtained when total plant DNA was digested with BglII. The 32 P random primerlabeled 0.81 kb trnI-trnA probe fragment, hybridized with the untransformed control giving a 4.47 kb fragment as expected, while a 6.17 kb fragment was observed for the transgenic lines (Figure 3 (b) and (c)), indicating that all plastid genomes had the gene cassette inserted between the trnI and trnA regions. The absence of a 4.47 kb fragment in transgenic lines indicates that homoplasmy has been achieved. Southern blot con\u00aermed that plants transferred to pots were seen to have no adverse pleiotropic effects compared to untransformed plants (Figure 4(a) ). Southern blot analysis of T 1 plants (Figure 3(c) ) shows that all four transgenic lines analyzed maintained homoplasmy.\n\nAnti-cholera toxin antibodies showed no signi\u00aecant cross-reaction with tobacco plant protein (Figure 2(b) , lane 1). In unboiled samples, chloroplast-synthesized CTB appeared as oligomers (Figure 2(c) , lane 4) similar to the unboiled, pentameric bacterial CTB, which appeared to have partially dissociated into tetramers, trimers and monomers upon storage at 4 C over a period of several months (Figure 2(c), lane 7) . The absence of monomers in transgenic plant extracts suggests that unassembled monomers are proteolytically degraded. While heat treatment (four minutes, boiling), prior to SDS-PAGE, of pentameric bacterial CTB gave CTB monomeric and multimeric forms (Figure 2(c), lane 6) , chloroplast-synthesized CTB dissociated into dimers, trimers and multimers when subjected to similar heat treatment (Figure 2(c), lanes 3 and 5) . This is not due to inadequate boiling or low concentrations of dithiothreitol or b-mercaptoethanol. Increasing these agents to reduce disul\u00aede bridges or increasing duration of boiling did not alter polypeptide pro-\u00aeles signi\u00aecantly. However, the same conditions were adequate to dissociate bacterial pentamers (Figure 2(c), lane 6) . These results differ from the heat-induced dissociation of potato plant nuclearsynthesized CTB oligomers into monomers. 17 A probable reason for this unusual stability could be a more stable conformation of chloroplastsynthesized CTB, which may be an added advantage in storage and administration of edible vaccines. Proteins larger than 55 kDa are aggregates of oligomers in plant extracts and puri\u00aeed bacterial antigen (Figure 2(c), lanes 4 and 7) . Because of variations in the degree of aggregation, boiled samples did not show identical polypeptide pro-\u00aeles. Leaf homogenates from four different transgenic lines showed similar expression levels of CTB protein (Figure 2(b) , lanes 3-6) due to lack of gene silencing or position effect that are usually observed in nuclear transgenic plants. This con-\u00aerms that clonal variation of CTB expression is minimal among independent transgenic lines, as observed in ELISA quanti\u00aecation assays. Consistent expression levels of recombinant proteins in plants (as obtained for CTB in this research) may be essential for production of edible vaccines in plants.\n\nBoth transgenic T 0 lines tested yielded CTB protein levels ranging between 3.5 % and 4.1 % of the total soluble protein (40 mg of chloroplast-synthesized CTB protein in 1 mg of total soluble protein, Figure 5 22, 23 Also, estimation of CTB expression levels from different stages of leaves (young, mature and old) determined that mature leaves have the highest levels of CTB protein expression. The top three or four leaves were designated as young; large, well-developed leaves collected from the middle of the plant were considered as mature; leaves that were generally bleached or undergoing scenescence, from the bottom of the plant were designated as old. This observation is in accordance with the results obtained when similar experiments were performed with the Bt Cry2aA2 gene, expressed as a single gene. 23 However, when this gene was expressed with a putative chaperonin gene as the Cry2aA2 operon, high expression levels in older leaves were observed, probably due to the formation of stable crystalline structure. 23\n\nBoth chloroplast-synthesized and bacterial CTB demonstrated a strong af\u00aenity for GM1-ganglioside ( Figure 5(b) ), indicating that chloroplastsynthesized CTB conserved the antigenic sites necessary for binding of the CTB pentamer to the pentasaccharide GM1. The GM1 binding ability also suggests proper folding of CTB molecules resulting in the functional pentameric structure. Since oxidation of cysteine residues in the B subunits is a prerequisite for in vivo formation of CTB pentamers, 30 proper folding is a further con\u00aermation of the ability of chloroplasts to form disul-\u00aede bonds. The ratio of CTB expression in transgenic lines 3 (3.5 %) and 7 (4.1 %) in the CTB quantitative assay (Figure 5(a) ) is proportional to the GM1 binding measured absorbance ratio of transgenic lines 3 (A 1.2) and 7 (A 1.4; Figure 5 (b)). This observation indicates that the binding of CTB to GM1 is proportional to the level of synthesis in two different transgenic lines.\n\nHigh levels of constitutive expression of CTB in transgenic tobacco did not affect growth rates, owering or seed setting, unlike previous reports for the synthetic LTB gene, constitutively expressed via the nuclear genome. 16 Therefore, there is no need to regulate CTB expression in transgenic chloroplasts or express it in speci\u00aec tissues to overcome pleiotropic effects. Transformed plant seedlings were green, while untransformed seedlings lacking the aadA gene were bleached white (Figure 4(b) ) when germinated on spectinomycincontaining medium.\n\nThe potential use of the chloroplast technology developed in this study is threefold. It can be used for (1) large-scale production of puri\u00aeed CTB, (2) as an edible vaccine if expressed in an edible plant or (3) as a fusion transmucosal carrier peptide, to either enhance mucosal immunity or induce oral tolerance to the products of these peptides. 14 Large-scale production of puri\u00aeed CTB in bacteria involves the use of expensive fermentation techniques and stringent puri\u00aecation protocols, 35 making this a prohibitively expensive technology for developing countries. The cost of producing 1 kg of recombinant protein in transgenic crops has been estimated to be 50 times lower than the cost of producing the same amount by E. coli fermentation. 36 If 5 % of the alfalfa soluble protein were the target protein, one could harvest about 15 kg of the transgenic-expressed protein/acre per year. 37 While existing expression levels of CTB via the chloroplast genome are adequate for commer-cial exploitation, levels could be increased further (up to 50 % total soluble protein) by insertion of a putative chaperonin, 23 which may also aid in the subsequent puri\u00aecation of recombinant CTB due to crystallization. If used as an edible vaccine, a selection scheme eliminating the use of antibiotic-resistance genes should be developed. 38 One such scheme uses the betaine aldehyde dehydogenase (BADH) gene, which converts toxic betaine aldehyde to non-toxic glycine betaine, an osmoprotectant. 39 Other strategies have been developed to eliminate antibiotic-resistance genes from transgenic plants. 40 Development of edible vaccines in transgenic leaves are ideal for animal vaccines. Future development of edible vaccines for human consumption would be more appealing if the vaccines were expressed in edible parts of transgenic plants. Expression of a transgene in chromoplasts has been demonstrated, 41, 42 and the ef\u00aeciency of translation of foreign genes in chromoplasts is similar to that of chloroplasts. 43 Therefore, we anticipate that elevated edible vaccine expression in chromoplasts of transgenic fruits is both feasible and forthcoming.\n\nPrimers were designed to introduce an RBS site (GGAGG) \u00aeve bases upstream of the start codon of the coding sequence of the native CTB gene, and the leader peptide sequence was deleted. The PCR product was cloned into the multiple cloning site of the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently cloned into the chloroplast expression vector pLD-CtV2 after veri\u00aecation of the correct DNA sequence. E. coli (transformed by standard CaCl 2 transformation procedure) and untransformed E. coli cultures (24 and 48 hours) were centrifuged (ten minutes at 10,000 g), the pellets were washed twice with 200 mM Tris-HCl, resuspended in 500 ml of extraction buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM PMSF) and sonicated. Doublestrength SDS sample buffer was added to 100 ml of transformed and untransformed sonicates (containing 50-100 mg of crude protein extract as determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio Rad)) and puri\u00aeed CTB (100 ng, Sigma). These samples were loaded onto an SDS-15 %/ PAGE gel and electrophoresed at 200 V for 45 minutes. The separated protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting at 70 V for 90 minutes.\n\nBlocking by incubation of the membrane in 25 ml of 5 % (w/v) non-fat dry milk in TBS buffer (20 mM Tris base (Fisher), 500 mM NaCl (Sigma), pH 7.5) for two hours on a rotary shaker was followed by washing in TBS buffer. Incubation for one hour in a 1:5000 dilution of rabbit anti-cholera antiserum (Sigma) in TBST (TBS buffer with 0.05 % (v/v) Tween-20) containing 1 % nonfat dry milk and washing thrice in TBST buffer was followed by incubation in a 1:10,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) in TBST. The membrane was washed thrice in TBST, once with TBS followed by incubation in alkaline phosphatase color development reagents, BCIP/NBT in AP color development buffer (Bio Rad) for an hour.\n\nMicroprojectiles coated with plasmid DNA (pLD-LH-CTB) were bombarded into Nicotiana tabacum var. Petit havana leaves using the biolistic device PDS1000/He (Bio Rad), as described by Daniell. 44 Following incubation at 24 C in the dark for two days, the leaves were cut into small ($5 mm \u00c2 5 mm) pieces and placed abaxial side up (\u00aeve pieces/plate) on selection medium (RMOP containing 500 mg/l spectinomycin dihydrochloride). Spectinomycin-resistant shoots obtained after about six weeks were cut into small pieces ($2 mm \u00c2 2 mm) and placed onto plates containing the same selection medium.\n\nTotal plant DNA from putative transgenic and untransformed plants was isolated using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen). PCR primers, AAAACCCGTCCTCAGTTCG-GATTGC (3P), CCGCGTTGTTTCATCAAGCCTTACG (3M), CTGTAGAAGTCACCATTGTTGTGC (5P), and TGACTGCCCACCTGAGAGCGGACA (2M) were used to perform PCR on both putative transgenic and untransformed plant total DNA. After denaturation for \u00aeve minutes at 94 C, samples were carried through 30 cycles using the following temperature sequence: 94 C for one minute, 62 C for 1.5 minutes and 72 C for two minutes. PCR con\u00aermed shoots, from the second culture cycle, were transferred to rooting medium (MSO medium containing 500 mg/l spectinomycin).\n\nTen micrograms of plant DNA per sample (isolated using DNeasy kit) digested with BglII, were separated on a 0.7 % (w/v) agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The chloroplast vector DNA digested with BglII and BamHI generated a 0.8 kb probe homologous to the\u00afanking sequences. Hybridization was performed using the Ready To Go protocol (Pharmacia). After Southern blot con\u00aermation, plants were transferred to soil. Upon\u00afowering, seeds were germinated on spectinomycin dihydrochloride selection medium. The T 1 seedlings were grown in bottles containing MSO with spectinomycin (500 mg/l) for two weeks, and plants were transferred to pots.\n\nTransformed and untransformed leaves (100 mg) were ground in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in 500 ml of extraction buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM PMSF). Leaf extracts (100-120 mg as determined by Lowry assay), boiled (four minutes) or unboiled, in sample buffer (Bio Rad) were electrophoresed in a 12 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gel for \u00aeve hours at 200 V. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting at 85 V for one hour. The immunoblot detection procedure was similar to that done for E. coli blots described above.\n\nFor the chemiluminescent detection, the S. Tag TM AP Lumiblot kit (Novagen) was used.\n\nLeaves (transformed and untransformed plants, 100 mg) ground in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in bicarbonate buffer (15 mM Na 2 CO 3 , 35 mM NaHCO 3 , pH 9.6) were bound to a 96 well polyvinyl chloride microtiter plate (Costar) overnight at 4 C. Background was blocked with 1 % (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for two hours at 37 C, washed thrice with washing buffer, PBST (PBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20) and rabbit anti-cholera serum diluted 1:8000 in 0.01 M PBST containing 0.5 % BSA was added and incubated for two hours at 37 C. The wells were washed and incubated with 1:50,000 mouse anti rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate in 0.01 M PBST containing 0.5 % BSA for two hours at 37 C. Plates were developed with Sigma Fast pNPP substrate (Sigma). The reaction was ended by addition of 3 M NaOH and plates were read at 405 nm. Comparison of the absorbance at 405 nm of a known amount of bacterial CTB-antibody complex (linear standard curve) and that of a known concentration of transformed plant total soluble protein was used to estimate CTB expression levels.\n\nThe microtiter plate was coated with monosialoganglioside-GM1 (Sigma) (3.0 mg/ml in bicarbonate buffer) and incubated at 4 C overnight. As a control, BSA (3.0 mg/ml in bicarbonate buffer) was coated in some wells. The wells were blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS, washed thrice with PBST and incubated with soluble protein from transformed and untransformed plants, and bacterial CTB in PBS. Incubation of plates with primary and secondary antibody dilutions and detection was done similar to the CTB ELISA procedure described above."}
