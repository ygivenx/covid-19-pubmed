{"title": "Metagenomic Nanopore Sequencing of Influenza Virus Direct from Clinical Respiratory Samples", "body": "Influenza A virus is an RNA orthomyxovirus of approximately 13 kb in length, with an eight-segment genome. It is typically classified on the basis of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), of which there are 16 and 9 main variants, respectively (1). Genetic reassortment underpins the potential for transmission between different host species (2) and for the evolution of highly pathogenic variants (3\u20136), recognized in the WHO list of \u201cten threats to global health\u201d (7). Seasonal influenza causes an estimated 650,000 deaths globally each year, and the H3N2 variant alone kills 35,000 people each year in the United States (1, 8). Certain groups are particularly at risk, including older adults, infants, young children, pregnant women, those with underlying lung disease, and the immunocompromised (9). The burden of disease disproportionately affects low-/middle-income settings (10). Influenza virus diagnostics and surveillance are fundamental to identify the emergence of novel strains, to improve the prediction of potential epidemics and pandemics (4, 8), and to inform vaccine strategy (11). Diagnostic data facilitate real-time surveillance, can underpin infection control interventions (12, 13), and can inform the prescription of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) (9).\n\nCurrently, most clinical diagnostic tests for influenza virus depend on detecting viral antigen or on PCR amplification of viral nucleic acid derived from respiratory samples (14). These two approaches offer trade-offs in benefits, as follows: antigen tests (including point-of-care tests [POCT]) are typically rapid but have low sensitivity (15\u201317), while PCR is more time-consuming but more sensitive (9). Irrespective of the test used, most clinical diagnostic facilities report a nonquantitative (binary) diagnostic result, and the data routinely generated for influenza diagnosis have limited capacity to inform insights into epidemiological linkage, vaccine efficacy, or antiviral susceptibility. On these grounds, there is an aspiration to generate new diagnostic tests that combine speed (incorporating the potential for POCT [18, 19]), sensitivity, detection of coinfection (20, 21), and generation of quantitative or semiquantitative data that can be used to identify drug resistance and reconstruct phylogeny to inform surveillance, public health strategy, and vaccine design.\n\nThe application of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to generate full-length influenza virus sequences from clinical respiratory samples can address these challenges. ONT offers a \u201cthird-generation,\u201d portable, real-time approach to generating long-read single-molecule sequence data, with demonstrated success across a range of viruses (20, 22\u201324). To date, Nanopore sequencing of influenza virus has been reported using high-titer virus from an in vitro culture system, producing full-length genome sequences through direct RNA sequencing (25), or using targeted enrichment by either hybridization of cDNA (26) or influenza virus-specific PCR amplification (27).\n\nWe therefore aimed to optimize a metagenomic protocol for detecting influenza viruses directly from clinical samples using Nanopore sequencing. We determine its sensitivity compared to that of existing diagnostic methods and its accuracy compared to short-read (Illumina) sequencing, using clinical samples from hospital patients during an influenza season and samples from a controlled laboratory infection in ferrets. Further optimization is required before the Nanopore method can be rolled out as a diagnostic test, but we highlight the potential impact of this technology in advancing molecular diagnostics for respiratory pathogens.\n\nWe collected respiratory samples from the clinical microbiology laboratory at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, a large tertiary referral teaching hospital in Southeast England. We worked with anonymized residual material from throat and nose swabs generated as a result of routine clinical investigations between January and May 2018. Samples were collected using a sterile polyester swab inoculated into 1 to 3 ml of sterile viral transport medium (VTM), using a standard approach described on the CDC website (28). During the study, respiratory samples submitted to the clinical diagnostic laboratory were routinely tested by a PCR-based test using the GeneXpert assay (Cepheid) to detect influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The workflow is shown in Fig. 1. Samples from patients in designated high-risk locations (hematology, oncology, and critical care) were tested using the BioFire FilmArray (bioM\u00e9rieux) to detect an expanded panel of bacterial and viral pathogens. Quantitative data (cycle threshold [CT]) were generated by the GeneXpert assay, and we used the influenza virus CT value to estimate the viral titers in clinical samples. Using the GeneXpert assay, up to 40 PCR cycles are performed before a sample is called negative (i.e., positives have a CT value of <40). Quantification was not available for the BioFire results.\n\nFor methodological assessment, we focused on four categories of samples, as follows: positive pool, negative pools, individual positive samples, and individual negative samples. For the positive pool, we pooled 19 throat swab samples that had tested positive for influenza A virus in the clinical diagnostic laboratory to provide a large enough sample to assess reproducibility (Fig. 1B). For the negative pools, we generated three pools of throat swab samples that had tested negative for influenza virus (consisting of 24, 38, and 38 individual samples) (Fig. 1B). For the individual positive samples, we included 40 individual samples (35 throat swabs and 5 nasal swabs) that had tested positive for influenza A or B virus, selected to represent the widest range of GeneXpert assay CT values (13.5 to 39.3; valid test result range, 12 to 40). For the individual negative samples, we selected 10 individual throat swab samples that were influenza virus negative.\n\nWe quantified viral titers in Hazara virus stocks and pooled influenza A virus-positive throat swabs by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), using previously described assays and standards (29, 30).\n\nPrior to establishing the protocol detailed in full below, we assessed the impact of two possible optimization steps, centrifugation versus filtration and reduced time for cDNA synthesis. For centrifugation versus filtration, we investigated two approaches to deplete human/bacterial nucleic acid from our samples, i.e., filtration of the raw sample via a 0.4-\u03bcm filter (Sartorius) before further processing versus using a hard spin (16,000 \u00d7 g for 2 min). cDNA libraries for this comparison were produced as described previously (20). For the reduced time for cDNA synthesis, to assess the possibility of time saving in the cDNA synthesis steps, we compared performance of the previously described protocol (20) to that of a modified version with two alterations, first using SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher) in place of SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher) for reverse transcription, with the incubation time reduced from 60 min to 10 min at 42\u00b0C, and second, reducing the cDNA amplification PCR extension cycling time from 5 min to 2 min.\n\nPrior to nucleic acid extraction, each sample was spiked with Hazara virus virions to a final concentration of 104 genome copies per ml as a positive internal control. This is an enveloped negative-stranded RNA virus (genus Orthonairovirus, order Bunyavirales) with a trisegmented genome of 11,980, 4,575, and 1,677 nucleotides in length (GenBank accession numbers KP406723 to KP406725). It is nonpathogenic in humans and would therefore not be anticipated to arise in any of our clinical samples. Cultured virions from an SW13 cell line were provided by the National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses (NCPV; catalog no. 0408084v).\n\nSamples were centrifuged at 16,000 \u00d7 g for 2 min. The supernatant was eluted without disturbing the pelleted material and was used in nucleic acid extraction. Total nucleic acid was extracted from 100 \u03bcl of supernatant using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen) eluting in 50 \u03bcl of H2O, followed by a DNase treatment with Turbo DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. RNA was purified and concentrated to 6 \u03bcl using the RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Randomly amplified cDNA was prepared for each sample using a sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) approach, adapted from our previously described workflow (20), based on the round A/B methodology (23). For reverse transcription, 4 \u03bcl of RNA and 1 \u03bcl of primer A (5\u2032-GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA-N9-3\u2032, 40 pmol/\u03bcl) (23) were mixed and incubated for 5 min at 65\u00b0C and then cooled to room temperature. First-strand synthesis was performed by the addition of 2 \u03bcl SuperScript IV first-strand buffer, 1 \u03bcl of 12.5 mM dinucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 0.5 \u03bcl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 \u03bcl H2O, and 0.5 \u03bcl SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher) before incubation for 10 min at 42\u00b0C. Second-strand synthesis was performed by the addition of 1 \u03bcl Sequenase buffer, 3.85 \u03bcl H2O, and 0.15 \u03bcl Sequenase (Affymetrix) prior to incubation for 8 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by the addition of 0.45 \u03bcl Sequenase dilution buffer and 0.15 \u03bcl Sequenase and a further incubation at 37\u00b0C for 8 min. Amplification of cDNA was performed in triplicate using 5 \u03bcl of the reaction mixture as input to a 50-\u03bcl AccuTaq LA (Sigma) reaction mixture, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, using 1 \u03bcl primer B (5\u2032-GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA-3\u2032) (23), with PCR cycling conditions of 98\u00b0C for 30 s, 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 50\u00b0C for 20 s, and 68\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 68\u00b0C for 10 min. Amplified cDNA was pooled from the triplicate reaction mixtures, purified using a 1:1 ratio of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), and quantified using a Qubit high-sensitivity double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) kit (Thermo Fisher), both according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions.\n\nMultiplex sequencing libraries were prepared using 250 ng of cDNA from up to 12 samples as input to the SQK-LSK108 or SQK-LSK109 kit and barcoded individually using the EXP-NBD103 Native barcodes (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and a modified One-pot protocol (https://www.protocols.io/view/one-pot-ligation-protocol-for-oxford-nanopore-libr-k9acz2e). Libraries were sequenced on FLO-MIN106 flow cells on the MinION Mk1b or GridION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), with sequencing proceeding for 48 h. Samples were batched according to the GeneXpert CT value (see File S1 in the supplemental material).\n\nNextera XT V2 kit (Illumina) sequencing libraries were prepared using 1.5 ng of amplified cDNA, as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and sequenced on a 2 \u00d7 150-bp paired-end Illumina MiSeq run by the Genomics Services Development Unit of Public Health England.\n\nNanopore reads were base called using Guppy (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Output base called fastq files were demultiplexed using Porechop v0.2.3 (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop). The reads were first taxonomically classified against the RefSeq database using Centrifuge v1.0.3 (31). The reads were then mapped against the reference sequence selected from the Centrifuge report using Minimap2 v2.9 (31, 32). A draft consensus sequence was generated by using a majority voting approach to determine the nucleotide at each position. The resulting draft consensus sequences were subjected to a BLAST search against an influenza virus sequence database that included >2,000 H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal influenza virus sequences between 2018 and 2019 and were downloaded from the Influenza Research Database (33). The reads were again mapped against the reference sequence using Minimap2 v2.9, and the number of mapped reads was calculated using SAMtools v1.5 (34) and Pysam (https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam). The subtype of the influenza A virus derived from each clinical sample was determined by the subtypes of the HA and NA reference sequences. A consensus sequence was built using Nanopolish v0.11.0 (35, 36) and the margin_cons.py script (37) (https://github.com/zibraproject/zika-pipeline). For the Illumina data, reads were quality trimmed to a minimum score of Q30 across the read with Trimmomatic (38). BWA-MEM v0.7.15 (39) was used to align the reads to reference genomes using MEM defaults. SAMtools v1.4 was used to compute the percent reads mapped and coverage depth (34). Mapping consensuses for Illumina sequencing were generated using QuasiBam (40). Maximum likelihood phylogeny was generated for the HA gene segment using RAxML v8.2.10 (41), in which a general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution and a gamma-distributed rate variation among sites were applied. Sequence alignments were performed by using MUSCLE v3.8 (42).\n\nWe applied our sequencing approach to residual samples collected in a previous time course experiment undertaken in a controlled laboratory environment (43). We tested ferret nasal saline wash samples from three independent animals over an 8-day time course, from 3 days prior to first exposure with influenza H1N1pdm09 virus and at days 1, 2, 3, and 5 postinfection. Sampling and plaque assays of the viral titer were described previously (43).\n\nThe study of anonymized discarded clinical samples was approved by the London-Queen Square Research Ethics Committee (17/LO/1420). Ferret samples were residual samples from an existing study (43) for which the project license was reviewed by the local Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Board of Public Health England (Porton) and subsequently granted by the Home Office.\n\nFollowing the removal of human reads, our sequence data have been uploaded to the European Bioinformatics Institute (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) under BioProject number PRJEB32861.\n\nOur method protocol is shown in Fig. 1A. We first sequenced five influenza A virus-positive and five influenza virus-negative throat swabs, each spiked with Hazara virus control at 104 genome copies/ml. Using a sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) approach (20), followed by Nanopore sequencing, we produced metagenomic data dominated by reads that were bacterial in origin, with extremely few viral reads detected. Passing the sample through a 0.4-\u03bcm filter prior to nucleic acid extraction increased the detection of viral reads by several orders of magnitude (Fig. S1). Filtration is relatively expensive, so we also assessed the alternative approach of adding a rapid-centrifugation step to pellet bacterial and human cells, followed by nucleic acid extraction from the supernatant. We used a pooled set of influenza A virus-positive samples (concentration, 106 genome copies/ml) to provide a large enough sample to assess reproducibility, with the Hazara virus control spiked in at 104 genome copies/ml. Enrichment for influenza virus and Hazara virus was similar for filtration versus centrifugation, based on read mapping to the viral genome (Fig. S2). As centrifugation is simpler and less expensive, we selected this approach for all further testing.\n\nSynthesis of tagged randomly primed cDNA and its subsequent amplification via SISPA (20) required lengthy reverse transcription and PCR steps (1 h and 3 h 45 min), respectively. Optimizing these stages upgraded the reverse transcriptase from SuperScript III to SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher), reduced the incubation time to 10 min (processing time reduction, 50 min), and reduced the PCR extension time within each cycle from 5 min to 2 min (1 h 30 min processing time reduction). Comparing this final method with our original protocol, using triplicate extractions from the pooled set of influenza A virus-positive samples demonstrated no significant loss in performance in the more rapid protocol (Fig. S3), and we adopted this approach as our routine protocol, giving a wet-lab processing time of \u223c8 h.\n\nStarting with an influenza A virus-positive sample pool (106 genome copies/ml), we made three volumetric dilution series using three independent influenza virus-negative pools (Fig. 1B). The total quantity of cDNA after preparation for sequencing was consistently higher in all samples using negative pool 3 as the diluent (Fig. 2A), indicating the presence of a higher concentration of nonviral RNA within pool 3. This is likely due to host cell lysis or higher bacterial presence and demonstrates the variable nature of throat swab samples.\n\nWe consistently retrieved Hazara virus reads from all three dilution series by Nanopore sequencing, independently of influenza virus titer in the sample (Fig. 2B). Sequencing from dilution series 1 and 2 gave a consistent proportion of total reads mapping to the Hazara virus genome, across dilutions and between the first two pools, with mean \u00b1 standard deviation values per pool of 1.4 \u00d7 103 \u00b1 660 reads per million (RPM) of total reads and 1.2 \u00d7 103 \u00b1 350 RPM, respectively. The pool 3 dilution series generated 260 \u00b1 340 RPM Hazara virus reads across samples and showed a decreasing trend associated with increased dilution factor as increasingly more nonviral RNA was introduced from this high-background pool.\n\nNanopore sequencing of the triplicate SISPA preparations of the influenza A virus-positive pool produced mean \u00b1 standard deviation of 5.3 \u00d7 104 \u00b1 3.6 \u00d7 104 RPM mapping to the influenza A virus genome (Fig. 2B). Across the dilution series, the proportion of influenza virus reads was strongly associated with influenza virus titer (P value = 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22125) but was also influenced by which negative pool was used for dilution, consistent with the pattern observed for the Hazara virus control. Sequencing the negative controls (pools with no influenza virus spike) generated no reads mapping to influenza virus. At influenza virus titers of <103 copies/ml, influenza virus reads were inconsistently detected across the samples (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the limit of detection is between 102 and 103 influenza virus copies/ml.\n\nFor the Hazara virus control (104 genome copies/ml spike), genome coverage was 81.4 to 99.4% (at 1\u00d7 depth) for pools 1 and 2. Coverage in the high-background pool 3 was more varied (21.5 to 96.5%; Fig. 3A). Influenza A virus genome coverage at 106 copies/ml was \u226599.3% for each segment in all samples (Fig. 3A). At 104 genome copies/ml of influenza virus, a mean 1\u00d7 coverage per segment was 90.3% for pools 1 and 2 but was substantially reduced in the high-background pool 3 to 5.7% (Fig. 3A). At influenza virus titers of <104 copies/ml, coverage was highly varied across genome segments. However, when present at 103 copies/ml, 2/3 pools had sufficient data for correct subtyping as H3N2 (Table 1).\n\nHaving demonstrated our ability to retrieve influenza virus sequences from pooled influenza virus-positive material diluted with negative samples, we next applied our methods to individual anonymized clinical samples, with 40 samples testing influenza virus positive and 10 samples testing influenza virus negative in the clinical diagnostic laboratory. Data yield varied between flow cells (range, 2.5 \u00d7 106 to 13.2 \u00d7 106 reads from up to 12 multiplexed samples). Within flow cells, barcode performance was inconsistent when using a stringent, dual-barcode, demultiplexing method (21). From each clinical sample, the range of total reads generated was 1.0 \u00d7 105 to 2.4 \u00d7 106 (median, 3.8 \u00d7 105 reads) (Table S1).\n\nReads mapping to either the influenza A or B virus genome were present in all 27 samples with a CT of <30 (range, 6 to 274,955 reads). At a CT of >30, 6/13 samples generated influenza virus reads (range, 6 to 92,057 reads) (difference between sensitivity at a CT threshold of 30, P < 0.0001; Fig. 4). The highest CT value at which any influenza virus reads were detected was 36.8 (sample 37; 17 reads of influenza A virus). No reads classified as influenza virus were obtained from sequencing the 10 GeneXpert assay-negative samples (Table S1). Based on this small data set, sensitivity is 83% and specificity is 100% (95% CI, 67 to 93% and 69 to 100%, respectively). There was a strong correlation between CT value and both the reads per sample classified as influenza virus (R2 = 0.60) and the number of influenza virus reads per million reads (R2 = 0.62) (Fig. 4). The consensus genome sequences generated (at 10\u00d7 minimum depth) covered over 90% of the influenza virus genome for 17 samples, with another two generating over 80% coverage. The highest CT value of a sample from which >90% of an influenza virus genome sequence was generated was 27.5 (Fig. S4).\n\nDetection of the control virus (Hazara virus at 104 genome copies/ml) was highly varied, demonstrating that levels of background nontarget RNA are a major source of intersample variation. The number of Hazara virus reads per sample ranged from 0 to 13.5 \u00d7 103 (0 to 3.5 \u00d7 104 RPM), with a median of 70 reads (160 RPM) and mean of 706 reads (1.7 \u00d7 103 RPM) (Table S1). Four (8%) of 50 samples generated no detectable Hazara virus reads, two with high numbers of influenza virus reads (for sample 1, CT of 13.5 and 1.5 \u00d7 105 influenza B virus reads, and for sample 6, CT of 18.4 and 1.5 \u00d7 104 influenza A virus reads) acting to dilute the control signal. The other two samples contained no detectable influenza virus reads (for sample 34, CT of 35.9, and for sample 46, influenza virus negative). The lack of control detection therefore indicates a loss of assay sensitivity due to high levels of background nucleic acid present in some samples.\n\nWe selected a subset of 15 samples from across the viral titer range and resequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. The proportions of reads generated that mapped to the influenza virus genome were similar between the two sequencing technologies (Fig. S5). From 4 of the samples, nearly complete genomes were obtained. A comparison of consensus sequences derived from Nanopore and Illumina sequencing showed 100% concordance, except one sample that showed 7 nucleotide differences (identity, 99.94%) (Table S2).\n\nWe reconstructed the phylogeny using consensus sequences for the HA gene (Fig. 5). This demonstrates closely related sequences, as expected within one geographic setting in a single influenza season.\n\nWithin the 50 clinical samples sequenced, we found limited evidence for the presence of other RNA viruses. Sample 6 produced 109 reads mapping to human coronavirus in addition to >1.5 \u00d7 104 influenza A virus reads, suggesting coinfection. We also derived >4.0 \u00d7 104 reads from human metapneumovirus from an influenza virus-negative sample, providing a nearly complete genome (99.8% coverage) from one sample (Fig. S1, sample I), further detailed previously (44).\n\nFinally, we used samples collected from a previous animal experiment (43) to test the reproducibility of our methods across a time course model of influenza A virus infection (three ferrets swabbed preinfection [day \u22123] and then sampled at days 1, 2, 3, and 5 following laboratory infection with influenza A virus). The proportion of viral reads present at each time point was highly congruent with viral titer (titer is shown in Fig. 6A and sequencing reads in Fig. 6B). We generated consensus genome sequences from Nanopore data at days 2, 3, and 5 postinfection; these were 100% concordant with Illumina-derived consensus sequences from the same cDNA (Table S2).\n\nThe current standard assay for influenza diagnosis employed within the large tertiary referral teaching hospital in which this study was performed is the GeneXpert assay (Cepheid), which detects influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Wider testing is performed on a subset of samples using the BioFire FilmArray respiratory panel (bioM\u00e9rieux), targeted at 20 common respiratory pathogens (17 viruses and 3 bacteria). These assays have the advantages over a metagenomic approach of higher sensitivity, shorter handling times, simpler laboratory workflow, and very rapid time to result (30 and 65 min, respectively). Compared to a metagenomic approach, their limitations are that no sequence data informative for molecular epidemiology and drug resistance typing are generated for the target pathogens, and that the assay will only detect the small number of pathogens targeted. Periodic refinement of such assays is required in the event of newly emergent pathogens or diverse strains of established pathogens leading to assay escape. This is not an issue affecting metagenomic sequencing, which has the ability to detect all RNA viruses in a sequence-independent manner. At the time of undertaking this laboratory work, the materials costs of the metagenomic sequencing were \u223c\u00a3140 per sample when multiplexing six samples per flow cell and purchasing 48 flow cells together. The cost of the current influenza A/B and RSV GeneXpert test is \u223c\u00a356, and the BioFire RP panel costs \u223c\u00a3139 per sample. The existing tests have the significant advantage of short handling times and simple processing, whereas the metagenomic sequencing requires \u223c8 h and skilled laboratory staff.\n\nAlternative approaches to generate sequence data include amplicon-based sequencing of the influenza virus genome (51, 52). However, this approach detects only the target pathogen, requiring multiple assays or more complex multiplex primer schemes to add targets and capture diverse strains of the original target. The use of short-read Illumina sequencing instead of Nanopore sequencing for metagenomic sequencing of influenza virus (53) provides the current gold standard of sequence quality and some potential cost savings per base of sequence generated. However, our data show that at a relatively modest minimum coverage depth of 10\u00d7, Nanopore-generated consensus viral genome sequences are 99.95 to 100% identical to Illumina sequences. Of the 13 samples compared, 12 samples were 100% concordant. The few bases that differed between the technologies in a single sample appear to be clear in each case and a genuine disagreement between the long- and short-read approaches, rather than simply being due to the higher per-base error rate of Nanopore per se. Larger and more diverse data sets will be required to set more rigorous thresholds for base calling. Currently, it is wise to bear such potential issues in mind when comparing genome sequences generated by different technological platforms.\n\nThe per-read differences in base accuracy are also compensated for by the increased read length, providing further confidence in the case of individual read taxonomic assignment. Consideration of relative costs must also take into account other cost-saving attributes. These include the substantially lower infrastructure and startup costs of Nanopore sequencing, the unique ability to interrogate sequence data as they are generated in real time, and the potential for the portable MinION device to be utilized near to patient, potentially decreasing turnaround time, particularly for high-virus-load samples which may be identified within minutes. The throughput of the Nanopore flow cells allows for a small number of samples to be run immediately rather than requiring samples to be batched to reach a number sufficient to cost efficiently run a greater-throughput short-read sequencing device. In the future, the use of an even lower-throughput flow cell with the ONT Flongle adaptor may allow individual samples to be run per cell, offering quicker turnaround per sample and minimizing cross-sample contamination. A summary table comparing the different approaches is included in supplemental material (Table S3).\n\nThe current limitations of metagenomic methods are their sensitivity in the context of low-pathogen-titer samples. PCR-based methods measure the absolute count of viral genome copies present within a sample. Metagenomic sequencing measures the proportion of total RNA that is viral. Metagenomic sequencing is therefore affected by the level of nontarget RNA within a given sample, whereas PCR is not. As demonstrated here (Fig. 2b and Table 1), detection of as little as 102 genome copies per ml is possible from throat swab samples (a level comparable with PCR-based methods), but variation in the level of background nucleic acids between individual samples makes detection at this level inconsistent. Further development of methods to deplete host and bacterial RNA within the samples is required to improve the performance of the assay at CT values of >30. Enrichment of pathogen sequences within libraries through either target capture or amplification is also an effective method to reduce the limit of target detection (54, 55) but requires the same a priori knowledge of both which pathogens are to be targeted and the full range of circulating viral diversity as other targeted methods discussed above, albeit with increased tolerance for diversity over PCR-based methods. A further limitation compared to alternative sequencing technologies is the lack of confidence in determining the presence of minority variants due to the limited per-read accuracy, although we expect this to be addressed in future iterations of the ONT sequencing.\n\nIn summary, while substantial further work is needed, our methods show promise for generating influenza virus sequences directly from respiratory samples. The \u201cpathogen-agnostic\u201d metagenomic sequencing approach offers an opportunity for simultaneous testing for a wide range of potential pathogens, providing a faster route to optimum treatment and contributing to antimicrobial stewardship. Longer term, this approach has promise as a routine laboratory test, providing data to inform treatment, vaccine design and deployment, infection control policies, and surveillance."}
