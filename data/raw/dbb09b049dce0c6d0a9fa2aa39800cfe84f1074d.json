{"title": "Optical sensor for berberine utilizing its intrinsic fluorescence enhanced by the formation of inclusion complex with butylated-\u2424-cyclodextrin", "body": "Fluorescent sensors are advantageous to analyze and detect various organic and biological molecules due to their high sensitivity and selectivity [1] [2] [3] [4] . Meanwhile, supramolecular transducing systems have attracted enormous research interest in the development of chemical sensors in recent years [5] . A variety of receptor molecules, such as cyclodextrin (CD) [6, 7] , crown ethers [8] , calixarenes [9] , and porphyrin [10] , as typical host compounds, can selectively recognize organic species. Among them, the naturally occurring chiral \u2423-, \u2424and \u2425-cyclodextrin are well known as simple model receptors which have the remarkable property of selectively including organic, in-organic and biological molecules in their toroidal cavity to form stable host-guest inclusion complexes [11] . The formation of an inclusion complex is often able to effect enhancements or perturbations of the photophysical and photochemical properties of included guest molecules [12] . Several weak intermolecular force between host and guest, such as dipole-dipole, hydrophobic, electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydrogen-bonding interaction, cooperatively contribute to the molecular recognition process [13] .\n\nBerberine, a quaternary ammonium salt, is the basic active ingredient of a widely used traditional Chinese medicine Coptis Chinensis with antibacterial and anticonvulsant activities commonly used for the treatment of diseases such as bacillary dysentery, lobar pneumonia and pertussis. Particularly, berberine has been used in Chinese hospitals for the auxiliary treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to reduce its mortality rate. Some analytical methods have been developed for the quantification of berber-ine. These methods include the use of liquid chromatography [14, 15] , capillary electrophoresis [16] , electrochemical analysis [17] [18] [19] , fluorophotometry [20] [21] [22] , chemiluminescence [23] . Among the fluorescence methods reported so far for berberine assay, the sensors or analytical methods designed were all based on quenching the fluorescence of the sensing reagent immobilized on membrane by berberine. Actually, berberine possesses its unique intrinsic fluorescence property as manifested in the use of berberine as a probe for fluorescence assay of DNA and RNA [24, 25] . It is very interesting to explore the potential of utilizing the intrinsic fluorescence property of berberine for its assay. Berberine only manifests very weak fluorescence property in aqueous solutions without addition of sensitizing agents such as DNA or RNA. Though the role of DNA or RNA in sensitizing the fluorescence of berberine has not been discussed in the literatures [24, 25] , it seems that DNA or RNA provides a protective microenvironment which would decrease the opportunity of berberine colliding with molecules existed in the bulk solution. In the search of an appropriate environment suitable for the intense enhancement of fluorescence intensity of berberine, we observed that the addition of \u2424-CD could enhance the fluorescence intensity of berberine in aqueous solutions more remarkably comparing with DNA or RNA. The possible reason is that \u2424-CD can provide a more protective hydrophobic microenvironment to accommodate berberine than DNA or RNA. The enhanced fluorescence sensitivity obtainable by the use of \u2424-CD is, unfortunately, still insufficient for designing a practically usable berberine assay methodology. To our knowledge, no fluorescent sensor for berberine based on its characteristic fluorescence enhancement was reported in the literature.\n\nIn this paper, we tried to synthesize a lipophilic cyclodextrin, heptakis (2,6-di-o-n-butyl)-\u2424-cyclodextrin (HDB-\u2424-CD) and used it as sensing element in a hydrophobic membrane of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) matrix. It turned out that the fluorescence intensity of berberine in the membrane drastically enhanced which was obviously associated with the formation of an inclusion complex between HDB-\u2424-CD and berberine. This has been utilized as the basis of the preparation of berberine-sensitive fluorescent sensor. This paper reports the preparation and analytical performance characteristics of the proposed berberine-sensitive sensor. The sensor can be used for the determination of berberine with a linear range covering from 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u22127 to 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol l \u22121 with a detection limit of 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22128 mol l \u22121 . Also, the response mechanism of the optode membrane was investigated. Furthermore, molecular dynamics computation and computer simulation technique were combined to predict the steric configuration of the inclusion complex. An optimum conformation of inclusion complex was presented, which would serve as an aid for better understanding the recognition mechanism controlled by the simultaneous operation of several weak interactions and the factors governing inclusion phenomena of guest molecules by host CDs. \n\nHigh molecular weight PVC, diisooctyl sebacate (DOS) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagents (Shanghai). \u2424-Cyclodextrin (\u2424-CD) was provided by Beijing Aoboxing Biochemical Reagents (Beijing). HDB-\u2424-CD was prepared and purified by method reported by Bates et al. [26] . Berberine hemisulfate salt (see Fig. 1 ) was obtained from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH, USA). All reagents were of analytical reagent grade. Doubly distilled water was used throughout.\n\nAll fluorescence measurements were performed with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer. Excitation and emission slits were set at 5.0 and 10.0 nm, respectively. All experiments were carried out at 20 \u2022 C. A laboratory-made flow cell (shown in Fig. 2 ) was used for the berberine-sensing measurements.\n\nThe optode membrane solution was prepared by dissolving a mixture of 8.0 mg of HDB-\u2424-CD, 80 mg of PVC, 160 mg of DOS in 2.0 ml of freshly distilled THF. A circular 35 mm diameter quartz plate was fixed on the end of an aluminum alloy rod and then rotated at a frequency of 600 rpm. With a syringe, 0.2 ml of the membrane solution was injected on the center of the plate. After spinning for 5.0 s, a membrane of approximately 4.0 m thickness was then coated onto the quartz plate and dried in ambient air for 30 min prior to use [27] . The concentration of HDB-\u2424-CD in PVC membrane was about 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol l \u22121 .\n\nThe prepared PVC membrane was installed in a homemade flow cell with about 3.4 ml volume capacity. The cell was mounted into the fluorescence spectrometer in a fixed position to ensure the detection of fluorescence emission intensity without interference from the excitation light source [28] [29] [30] . The fluorescence intensity was measured at the maximal excitation wavelength of 355 nm and the maximal emission wavelength of 513 nm. The berberine solution was introduced into the flow cell by a peristaltic pump. After each measurement, the membrane was washed with phosphate buffer solution (pH 3.0) until its fluorescence intensity reached the initial blank value.\n\nA standard stock solution of 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol l \u22121 berberine was prepared. The working solutions were obtained by serial dilutions of this stock solution with phosphate buffer solution (pH = 12.0). Sample solutions were prepared by directly dissolving an appropriate amount of tablets containing berberine in distilled water without any pretreatment and then diluting to predefined volume. The resulting solution was filtered and the filtrate was collected with the original portion discarded and used for analytical determination. ence and absence of HDB-\u2424-CD, respectively.). The fluorescence sensitivity factor in this paper was 22.\n\nIn order to confirm the existence of inclusion phenomenon between HDB-\u2424-CD and berberine, the titration experiments with the HDB-\u2424-CD in solution have been performed. As can be seen from with increasing HDB-\u2424-CD concentration. Moreover, the maximum excitation wavelengths of berberine shifted towards longer wavelengths, while the maximum emission wavelengths shifted towards shorter wavelengths. These results provided another proof for the formation of an inclusion complex of berberine with HDB-\u2424-CD.\n\nThe effect of pH values on the fluorescence intensity of optode membrane was examined with the concentration of berberine fixed at 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol l \u22121 . Berberine is a quaternary ammonium salt, so its fluorescence emission intensity should be irrelative with pH. This is really the case when berberine reacts with \u2424-CD in aqueous phase (as shown in Fig. 5 ). On the organic membrane phase, the situation seems to be much more complicated. Apparently, from the fluorescence intensity curve recorded with HDB-\u2424-CD containing membrane phase after contacting with berberine solution of different pH for 30 min, with the increase of pH values, the fluorescence intensity of optode membrane increases and inclines to level off after pH 12.0. The difference in two systems seems to be related with the fact that for the organic membrane phase, a process of the transfer of berberine from aqueous phase into the organic membrane phase is involved. The inclusion equilibrium of berberine and \u2424-CD in aqueous solution was a fast homogeneous reaction for a few minutes. While, The inclusion equilibrium of berberine in aqueous solution and HDB-\u2424-CD in membrane phase was a very slow heterogeneous reaction, since berberine in aqueous solution need to diffuse to permeate into organic membrane phase to contact with HDB-\u2424-CD. Also, under pH \u2265 11.0, the hydroxyl groups of HDB-\u2424-CD would deprotonate, and \n\nAccording to the references [31, 32] , the theoretical principle of optode membrane determination was proposed.\n\nIf the inclusion equilibrium between berberine in the aqueous solution (aq) and HDB-\u2424-CD in the plasticized PVC membrane phase (org) will form a m:n complex, the overall equilibrium can be represented as follows:\n\ni.e.\n\nwhere A represents berberine, B denotes HDB-\u2424-CD. When the difference between the activity and concentration is neglected for simplification, the corresponding equilibrium constant K can be expressed by the law of mass action:\n\nwhere k d is the distribution coefficient of berberine between the organic and aqueous phases, \u03b2 is complex formation constant, respectively, and [A m B n ], [A], [B] are the concentrations of respective species. When the concentration of berberine and HDB-\u2424-CD in membrane are low, the observed fluorescence intensity of the membrane is a sum of several contributions.\n\nwhere F 0 is the fluorescence intensity of the sensing membrane when it is applied to blank solution, F the fluorescence intensity of the sensing membrane when it is applied to berberine solution, C B(org) the total concentration of HDB-\u2424-CD in the membrane, and the K i values represent the individual proportion constants and include instrumental parameters as well as the quantum efficiency of the complex species.\n\nTo indicate the degree of association between HDB-\u2424-CD and berberine in the optode membrane, a response parameter, \u03b1, needs to be introduced and defined as follows:\n\nIt can be derived from Eqs. (5) to (7) that:\n\nwhere F 1 is the fluorescence intensity at membrane saturation. Combining Eqs. (4) and (7), one can obtain the following quantitative equation:\n\nThe relationship between \u03b1 and [A] as expressed by Eq. (9) is the basis of the quantitative determination of berberine using this optode membrane.\n\nThe reproducibility and reversibility of the optode membrane in the determination of berberine were evaluated by repetitively exposing the optode membrane to different concentration berberine solution and phosphate buffer solution (pH 12.0). The standard deviations of different sample solutions were found to be 2.95 (6.0 \u00d7 10 \u22127 mol l \u22121 ), 3.40 (2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol l \u22121 ), and 4.02 (1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol l \u22121 ). The standard deviation of blank solution was 2.03 for 12 determinations.\n\nThe berberine complexed with HDB-\u2424-CD could be eluted out of the CD cavity quickly and completely, which demonstrated the excellent reproducibility and reversibility of the sensor.\n\nAs for the response time of the optode membrane, it depended on the thickness of membrane. In order to obtain relatively thin membrane, the spin-on device was used, which allowed the production of very thin, homogeneous and reproducible PVC-based membrane. Besides, the response time also depended on the berberine concentration. It was noted that the time required to reach the equilibrium prolonged with increasing berberine concentration, the stable fluorescence intensity was obtained over a period of 5 min.\n\nFor the optode membrane in contact with a 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22127 mol l \u22121 berberine solution, the fluorescence intensity at 513 nm was recorded over a period of 8 h. The fluorescence intensity was recorded with a 30 min interval, a standard deviation of 2.33 was obtained. After a series of 200 times measurements of berberine solution, the fluorescence intensity value of the sensor did not change. From Eq. (9), it can be seen that when the stoichiometric ratio of complex changes, the relative fluorescence intensity value \u03b1 with the various concentration of berberine exhibits different functional relationships. According to Eq. (9), the experimental data were fitted by altering the ratio of m to n and the equilibrium constant K. Fig. 6 shows the fitted curve for the determination of berberine. The curve of the 1:1 complex ratio and K = 4.0 \u00d7 10 5 l mol \u22121 was in agreement with the experimental data, which can serve as the calibration curve. A linear range for berberine covered from 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u22127 to 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol l \u22121 . The detection limit, defined according to 3\u03c3 concept, was 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22128 mol l \u22121 .\n\nSome ions and species commonly existing in biological samples were chosen for the study on selectivity of the berberine sensor. A foreign species was considered not to interfere with measurement if a relative standard deviation caused by it was less than 5% in the determination of 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol l \u22121 berberine. The results presented in Table 1 reveal that following species caused no interference when existed in specified molar excesses of 1000 times for Na + , K + , NH 4 + , Cl \u2212 , CH 3 COO \u2212 , SO 4 2\u2212 , NO 2 \u2212 , citrate, carbonate, ascorbic acid, salicylate, saccharose, glucose, lactose, maltose, fructose, 100 times for Ca 2+ , 10 times for Mg 2+ .\n\nBerberine itself exhibits very weak fluorescence emission in aqueous solutions. However, its fluorescence intensity Table 1  Interference of different species to the fluorescent determination of berberine with the proposed sensor   Interferent Concentration a (mol l \u22121 ) was notably enhanced when berberine molecule entered the optode membrane containing HDB-\u2424-CD. The fluorescence enhancement can be interpreted as due to the formation of an inclusion complex between HDB-\u2424-CD and berberine. HDB-\u2424-CD possesses the hydrophobic cavity identical with that of \u2424-CD. Besides, as HDB-\u2424-CD was obtained by replacing the hydrogen atoms of the C-6-primary and C-2-secondary hydroxyl groups on parent \u2424-CD with butyl groups, this substantially increased the nonpolarity and hydrophobicity of the exterior shell surrounding the interior cavity of HDB-\u2424-CD. A much more hydrophobic and protective microenvironment for berberine was formulated shielding the excited state of berberine from water molecules and other species presented in bulk aqueous solution. An additional factor favorable for fluorescence enhancement is that the substitution of hydrogen atoms by butyl groups would cause the deformation of the cavity and decrease the degree of freedom in the motion of the berberine species entrapped in it. Moreover, the unsubstituted hydroxyl groups on HDB-\u2424-CD would deprotonate under strong alkaline conditions and an extra electrostatic force produced between HDB-\u2424-CD and berberine, which made berberine more accessible to HDB-\u2424-CD molecule and ready to enter into its cavity. Therefore, a better protection was obtained leading to a greater enhancement of the fluorescence intensity of berberine.\n\nAccording to CS Chem3D Pro version5.0 developed by CambridgeSoft Corporation, the molecule motion of berber-ine entering into the cavity of HDB-\u2424-CD was simulated with the help of molecular dynamics using MM2 method based on Newton's equations of motion for simulating the movement of atoms involved. The simulation was initiated at a starting geometry which was chosen as the location of berberine molecule outside the HDB-\u2424-CD cavity. The single point energy calculation was performed from the starting geometry. Then the coordinates for the atoms involved were changed with a step size of 2 \u00c5, and another single point energy calculation was performed to determine the energy of that new conformation. Following the next incremental change, the energy was again determined and the procedure continued covering the whole process when the berberine molecule move from the wide side of HDB-\u2424-CD to enter into the cavity till it went out from the narrow side. For \u2424-CD, the narrow side refers to the side of torus formed by the oligosaccharide ring where the primary hydroxyl groups of the glucose resides are located, while the wide side refers to the side where the secondary hydroxyl groups are located. For HDB-\u2424-CD, all primary hydroxyl groups and the C-2-secondary hydroxyl groups of the parent \u2424-CD were replaced by butyl groups, and the discrimination of narrow and wide sides remained unchanged. As can be seen from Fig. 7 , when the guest molecule berberine entered into the cavity from the wide side of HDB-\u2424-CD, the total energy of system dropped dramatically. One could imagine if the berberine molecule attempted to enter the cavity from the narrow side, it needed to overcome a huge energy barrier which practically forbade such a move. From the view of system stability, it was obviously favorable for berberine to enter into the cavity from the wide side of HDB-\u2424-CD. The stereoconformation of inclusion complex corresponding to the lowest energy of system is shown in Fig. 8 .\n\nStep (A) Fig. 7 . The curve of the change of system total energy calculated by molecular dynamics simulation. The calculation was initiated at a starting geometry (step 0) as the location of berberine molecule outside the HDB-\u2424-CD cavity. The increment of step from 0 to 36 \u00c5 represents the movement of berberine entering the wide side of HDB-\u2424-CD through the cavity and exiting from the narrow side. \n\nThe proposed sensor was applied to the determination of berberine in pharmaceutical tablets. An appropriate amount of sample solution was transferred into a volumetric flask and diluted with phosphate buffer solution of pH 12.0 and then measured by the use of the berberine sensor. Results showed that the concentrations of berberine determined by the proposed sensor were in agreement with those obtained by the pharmacopoeia method [33] and the relative standard deviations were less than 1.00% (as shown in Table 2 ). Furthermore, the proposed optical sensor was testified in the recovery studies of berberine in urine samples. Varying amounts of berberine were added to the diluted (50-fold) urine samples ( Table 3 ). The results suggested that the sen- Table 3 Recovery studies in urine samples sor could be used for the determination of berberine with satisfactory recoveries of 97.80-103.00%.\n\nAn optical sensor for berberine based on its intrinsic fluorescence enhanced with a lipophilic \u2424-cyclodextrin has been proposed. Under the optimum conditions, a detection limit of 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22128 mol l \u22121 berberine was obtained. The sensing mechanism of the optode membrane was based on the formation of an inclusion complex between HDB-\u2424-CD and berberine. The formation and optimum stereoconformation of the inclusion complex was investigated by combining molecular dynamics computation and computer simulation. The method for the determination of real sample was simple, precise and sensitive."}
