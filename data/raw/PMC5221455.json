{"title": "Comparative interactomics for virus\u2013human protein\u2013protein interactions: DNA viruses versus RNA viruses", "body": "Pathogen\u2013host interaction search tool (phisto) was developed by our group due to the lack of a comprehensive PHI database in the Web 16. It stores the up\u2010to\u2010date PHI data for all pathogen types for which experimentally\u2010found PPIs with human are available. phisto also provides integrated bioinformatic tools for visualization of PHI networks and topological/functional analysis of pathogen\u2010targeted human proteins through its user\u2010friendly interface (www.phisto.org). Ongoing studies on phisto are for covering experimental PHI data belonging also to other mammalian species as host organism.\n\nThe family\u2010based virus\u2013human PHIs were downloaded from phisto using the taxonomic filtering functionality of its browse option. Twenty\u2010eight viral families are covered by the downloaded interspecies interactome data. Twelve families carry DNA and 16 families carry RNA as their genetic material. Retroviruses were excluded from the RNA families since they replicate through reverse transcription. Similarly, Hepadnaviruses were excluded from the DNA viruses. Consequently, PHI data belonging to 11 DNA virus families (Table 1) and 15 RNA virus families (Table 2) were obtained and used throughout the study. Two representative PHI networks, one for a DNA virus and one for an RNA virus, are in Fig. 1. All details of the PHI data for these 26 viral families are given in Data S1 and S2.\n\nA total of eight sets of human proteins interacting with viral pathogens were constructed from the PHI data to analyze the functional properties of virus\u2010targeted human proteins. Firstly, the sets targeted by DNA viruses (DNA viruses\u2010targeted set), RNA viruses (RNA viruses\u2010targeted set), only DNA viruses, i.e. not targeted by any RNA viruses (only DNA viruses\u2010targeted set), and only RNA viruses, i.e. not targeted by any DNA viruses (only RNA viruses\u2010targeted set) were constructed to observe the characteristics specific to DNA and RNA viruses with respect to their interactions with human proteins. For a deeper comparison between DNA and RNA viral infections, human proteins interacting with at least four DNA virus families (4\u2010DNA viruses\u2010targeted set), as well as human proteins interacting with at least four RNA virus families (4\u2010RNA viruses\u2010targeted set) were used. On the other hand, to obtain the common infection strategies of viral pathogens, sets of human proteins targeted by all viruses, i.e. targeted by DNA and/or RNA viruses (viruses\u2010targeted set) and the ones targeted by both DNA and RNA viruses together (DNA\u2010RNA viruses\u2010targeted set) were also analyzed. The number of virus\u2010targeted human proteins covered by each set is tabulated in Table 3.\n\nGene ontology (GO) 17 enrichment analysis of the human protein sets was performed using the bingo plug\u2010in of Cytoscape 18. The significance level was set to 0.05 meaning that only terms enriched with a P\u2010value of at most 0.05 were considered after an enrichment calculation with hypergeometric test and then Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction. All three GO terms (biological process, molecular function, and cellular component) were scanned to identify the terms having significant association with each virus\u2010targeted human protein set studied.\n\nPathway enrichment analysis of the human protein sets was performed using the Web\u2010based tool, kobas (ver. 2.0) 19 based on information in KEGG pathway database 20. In the enrichment process, kobas platform uses hypergeometric test and Benjamini and Hochberg correction method. In this study, P\u2010value was set to 0.05 to obtain enriched human pathways for the virus\u2010targeted protein sets.\n\nThe visualization of virus\u2013human networks (Fig. 1) provides some insights on the nature of interactions between the viral and human proteins. In a PHI network, few proteins may serve as hub nodes. These are human proteins targeted by lots of pathogen proteins; and pathogen proteins targeting lots of human proteins. This scale\u2010free behavior is observed in the DNA virus\u2013human PHI network to some extent (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, in RNA viruses, very few viral proteins have roles in PHI networks because of their very small genomes. All of these RNA virus proteins usually have lots of interactions with human proteins (Fig. 1B). Therefore, in most cases, the scale\u2010free behavior could not be observed in RNA virus\u2013human PHI networks. In fact, the degree distribution of the virus\u2013human protein interaction networks could not be fitted to any model yet, mostly because of their incompleteness 21, despite some preliminary attempts to model the graph properties of PHI networks 10.\n\nThe distribution of 4943 viruses\u2010targeted human proteins based on their attacking virus types can be observed from the number of proteins in the human protein sets (Table 3). A considerable amount of human proteins (1354) are targeted by both DNA and RNA viruses, constituting the common viral targets. All of the virus\u2010targeted human proteins with the number of targeting DNA/RNA virus families can be found in Data S3. Human proteins that are highly targeted by viruses, i.e. targeted by at least total 8 viral families and the targeting virus families, are presented in Table 4. The list includes 21 such human proteins with corresponding targeting viral families.\n\nThe enriched GO process terms can be used to point out the human processes that are attacked by DNA/RNA viruses. All enriched GO process, function and component terms for each human protein set are available in Data S4. Special attention should be given to the results of sets of human proteins interacting with only DNA virus proteins and only RNA virus proteins (Table 5) to retrieve specific attack strategies of these two different virus types. Enriched GO processes for the human proteins targeted highly by multiple viral families, 4\u2010DNA viruses\u2010targeted set and 4\u2010RNA viruses\u2010targeted set (Table 6) may reflect more specificity to infection mechanisms of the corresponding virus types. On the other hand, the results of human proteins interacting with both DNA and RNA viruses (Table 7) are also important to highlight common infection mechanisms shared by the two types of viruses.\n\nEnriched pathway terms for five specific human protein sets are listed in Tables 8, 9, 10, presenting the certain characteristics of DNA and RNA viruses attack strategies. Similar to GO enrichment analysis results, these human protein sets are only DNA viruses\u2010targeted and only RNA viruses\u2010targeted (Table 8), 4\u2010DNA viruses\u2010targeted and 4\u2010RNA viruses\u2010targeted (Table 9), and DNA\u2010RNA viruses\u2010targeted (Table 10). Pathway enrichment analysis results are provided in Data S5 for all of eight virus\u2010targeted human protein sets under investigation.\n\nAs the main viral infection strategy, all viruses manipulate cellular processes to proliferate within the host. Therefore, viral proteins highly interact with human proteins functioning in cell cycle, human transcription factors to promote viral genetic material transcription, nuclear membrane proteins for transporting viral genetic material across the nuclear membrane, and also regulatory proteins for translation and apoptosis 3, 15, 25, 26. We identified human proteins that are highly interacting with viral proteins, sequentially based on the total number of targeting virus families (Table 4). The list includes the top viral targets which interact with multiple viral families, within the most comprehensive PHI data. Some of these human proteins were previously reported as targets for multiple viruses, i.e. P53, NPM, ROA2, GBLP, and HNRPK 3, 15.\n\nOur analyses revealed that there are six heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (HNRPs) in the highly targeted human proteins list (HNRPK, ROA1, HNRPC, HNRH1, HNRPF, ROA2). HNRPs are RNA\u2010binding proteins, which function in processing heterogeneous nuclear RNAs into mature mRNAs and in regulating gene expression. Specifically, they take role in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. They also recruit regulatory proteins associated with pathways related to DNA and RNA metabolism 27, 28. Being targeted by multiple viruses, HNRPU was reported as a hotspot of viral infection, and proposed as a potential antiviral human protein 4. In the present study, HNRPU is found to be targeted by five viral families (see Data S3). Our data additionally indicate several other HNRPs, targeted by viral proteins (see Data S1\u2013S3). For all virus\u2010targeted HNRPs, the number of targeting RNA virus families is found to be higher than that of DNA virus families (see Data S3), revealing that they may play crucial roles in viral RNA processing. The protein family of HNRPs may serve as host\u2010oriented antiviral drug targets.\n\nMoreover, our analyses also reflected that proteins functioning in transport and localization related processes within the cell are targeted highly by both DNA and RNA viruses, i.e. IMA1, ADT2, TCPG, and TCPE. IMA1 (Karyopherin alpha 2, KPNA2) functions mainly in nuclear import as an adapter protein for nuclear receptor KPNB1 (Karyopherin beta 1). Interacting with IMA1 enables viruses to enter the nucleus and consequently to use the host's transcriptional machinery. Besides, viruses may interact with IMA1 in order to inhibit the host antiviral response, since nuclear import factors regulate the transport of innate immune regulatory proteins to the nucleus of cells to activate the antiviral response 3, 29, 30, 31. The transmembrane transporter activity of ADT2 is responsible for the exchange of cytoplasmic ADP with mitochondrial ATP across the mitochondrial membrane, serving crucial roles in metabolic processes 32. Attacking to human metabolic processes was reported as a common infection strategy of bacteria and viruses 15. The proteins, TCPG and TCPE are responsible for RNA localization activity and our results reveal that they are targeted by larger number of RNA families (Table 4). Highly targeted transporter proteins should be investigated further for their potential to be next\u2010generation antiviral target, because of their crucial roles in viral life cycle within the host organism.\n\nEF1A1 and EF1A3 function as translation elongation factors in protein biosynthesis. EF1A proteins promote the GTP\u2010dependent binding of aminoacyl\u2010tRNA to the A\u2010site of ribosomes during protein biosynthesis with a responsibility of achieving accuracy of translation 33. Translation elongation factors were reported as targets for viruses, in early studies 34, 35, 36. Since they are essential components of the cellular translational machinery, viruses interact with them for biosynthesis of viral proteins within the host cell. We found translational elongation as the top biological process, commonly targeted by both DNA and RNA viruses (Table 7).\n\nInteracting with human transcription factors was reported as one of the main viral infection strategies 3, 15. Among the highly targeted human proteins, YBOX1 and P53 have transcription factor activity. Both of these proteins are multifunctional. YBOX1 functions in transcription of numerous genes, as a transcription factor. It also contributes to the regulation of translation. On the other hand, P53 is the famous tumor supressor acting as an activator for apoptotic cell death. Apoptosis is a very crucial process during the viral infection progress, and should be strategically controlled by viruses for a successful viral infection. Apoptosis is an innate immune response to viral infection. In the early stage of viral life cycle in the host cell, apoptosis is inhibited by corresponding virus\u2013human protein interactions. After completion of transcription and translation of viral genetic material, viruses try to induce apoptosis to assist virus dissemination 37, 38, 39.\n\nAmong the highly targeted human proteins in Table 4, EF1A1, ADT2, TBA1C, GRP78, TBB5, P53, TCPG, HS90B, and TBA1A were found as drug targets listed in DrugBank 40. However, only ADT2, GRP78, TBB5, P53, and TBA1A are approved for commercial drugs. Nevertheless, no antiviral therapeutic usage is available for these drug targets yet. Above\u2010mentioned human proteins; ribonucleoproteins, proteins functioning in intracellular transport and localization, translation elongation factors and transcription factors require further investigation for their potential for serving as antiviral drug targets.\n\nGene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses of pathogen\u2010targeted host proteins are widely used in bioinformatic analysis of PHI networks to understand the attack strategies of pathogens 3, 4, 15, 41, 42 as well as in verification of computationally predicted PHIs 43. Additionally, GO and pathway terms are widely used as features in computational PHI prediction studies 44, 45.\n\nOur observation of the enriched GO process terms for human proteins targeted by only DNA viruses (Table 5) may lead to the conclusion that DNA viruses have specifically evolved to be able to attack human cellular and metabolic processes simultaneously, during infections. Using this PHI mechanism, DNA viruses can finely exploit the cellular and metabolic mechanisms of infected cells to their own advantage, generally resulting in chronic infections in human. On the other hand, GO process terms enriched in human proteins targeted by only RNA viruses are mostly related to RNA processing, intracellular transport and localization within the cell (Table 5). It was reported that RNA viruses extensively target human proteins that are involved in RNA metabolism and also protein and RNA transport to promote viral RNA processing for a successful infection 4.\n\nFurther investigation of the enriched processes of human proteins attacked by multiple DNA viruses (Table 6) pointed out their high preference to target cellular processes. It was reported that DNA viruses tend to target crosstalking human proteins linking the cell cycle with either transcription or chromosome biology, with a possible aim of promoting viral replication instead of cellular growth 4. For the RNA viruses, we found that the human proteins attacked by multiple RNA virus families are enriched in specific processes within the cellular mechanisms (Table 6). All viruses need host's transcriptional machinery for viral genetic material transcription.\n\nIn the case of human proteins targeted by both DNA and RNA viruses, the P\u2010values of the enriched GO process terms are very low, indicating statistically strong results (Table 7). The most highly\u2010targeted human process is translational elongation. Translational control of viral gene expression in eukaryotic hosts was reported repeatedly 46, 47, 48. Here, we presented translational elongation as the top GO process term enriched in human proteins targeted by both DNA and RNA viruses within the current experimental PHI data. The remaining list includes cellular and metabolic processes, which can be considered as targets of both virus types. Based on these observations, we can state that the common viral infection strategy is to target human proteins functioning within the processes of gene expression and protein synthesis, simply because of the lack of their own such machineries. All viruses depend on the cellular mechanisms for these processes and they recruit host ribosomes for translation of viral proteins.\n\nA comparative investigation of the enriched pathway terms for human protein sets targeted by only DNA viruses and by only RNA viruses (Table 8) reveals additional support for the different infection strategies of these viral groups. There is no common term in these two lists of enriched human pathways. Cell cycle pathway targeted by only DNA viruses and RNA\u2010related pathways targeted by only RNA viruses, provide parallel results with GO enrichment analyses. The enriched pathway terms in 4\u2010DNA viruses\u2010targeted human protein set are only Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) infection and viral carcinogenesis (Table 9). EBV is a species of DNA virus family Herpesviridae, which constitute nearly half of the DNA viruses\u2013human PHI data (Table 1). On the other hand, it is estimated that 15% of all human tumors are caused by viruses, mainly DNA viruses, i.e. Herpesviruses and Papillomaviruses 49. The pathway enrichment analysis of 4\u2010RNA viruses\u2010targeted set brings the terms of protein processing and immune system related terms forward (Table 9). Finally, for the common targets of two virus types, we obtained ribosome term enriched with a very small P\u2010value (Table 10). Both viruses use host ribosome for viral protein synthesis.\n\nIn this study, an initial system\u2010level understanding of viral infection mechanisms through PHI networks was pursued by comparing DNA and RNA viruses, aiming to provide a framework for further investigations of infection mechanisms in the light of more precise information on pathogen\u2013host systems in the near future. Ongoing studies and increasing amounts of experimentally\u2010verified PHI data will further improve our understanding of the interplay between pathogens and human and hopefully identify novel and effective therapeutics for infectious disesases.\n\nSD and K\u00d6\u00dc conceived the study.
