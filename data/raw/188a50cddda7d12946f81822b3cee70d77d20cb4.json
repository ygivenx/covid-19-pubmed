{"title": "IDENTIFICATION OF DIAGNOSTIC ANTIGENS FOR SOUTH AMERICAN BABESIA CABALLI INFECTIONS", "body": "INDEX KEY WORDS: Babesia caballi; Western blot; ELISA; IFAT.\n\nBABESIA CABALLIand B. equi are the causative agents of equine babesioses. They are endemic in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world (Friedhoff, 1982; Friedhoff, Tenter & Miiller, 1990 continent (Roby & Anthony, 1963; Friedhoff, 1988) . By Western blot diagnostics antigens with a relative molecular mass of 141, 112, 70, 50 and 48 kDa were identified with sera from different European countries (B&e & Daemen, 1992) . However, no information is available on the conservation of these antigens among other than European strains of B. caballi. This study was undertaken to answer the question whether B. cab&i antigens diagnostic for Old and New World strains can be identified.\n\nAntigen for the ELISA, Western blot and immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) was obtained from microaerophilous stationary phase cultures initiated from the blood of a horse infected with the USDA strain (Tenter & Friedhoff, 1986 ) as described previously (B&e & Daemen, 1992) . Parasitized erythrocytes were enriched to about 100% infected cells with density gradient centrifugation on a two-step PercollR gradient (Bhushan, Miiller & Friedhoff, 1991) . at 37\u00b0C and centrifuged (22,000 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C). The incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h for the antigen and serum supernatant was diluted l/1000 in 0.1 M-carbonateincubation steps and for 30 min for the conjugate bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6 resulting in a working incubation. Approximately 2, 4 and 6 min after dilution of l/4000. A control antigen of non-infected substrate addition (1 mg ml-1 of 5-aminosalicylic acid erythrocytes from the same donor horse used for the (Ellens & Gielkens, 1980) 1990 ). Further the KELA programme was used to calculate \"delta values\" by subtraction of the slope values for control antigen from those for B. ~aba~~i antigen. The IFAT was carried out according to Tenter and Friedhoff (1986) . The Western blot was performed as described previously (B&e KL Daemen, 1992) , except that TBS with 0.5% Tween 20 was used instead of TBS with I % gelatin. Sera from horses held in a breeding herd in Brazil were examined monthly by ELISA and IFAT to demonstrate maternal antibodies and seroconversion for B. caballi. These semi-defined sera were also tested by Western blot to identify diagnostic antigens. A total of 246 sera from 60 horses were tested, i.e. 157 sera from 31 foals examined monthly for antibodies against B. caballi by ELISA, IFAT and Western blot and 89 sera from 29 horses older than 12 months and examined for antibodies against B. caballi by ELISA, IFAT and Western blot. All horses, 5 months or older were positive for B. equi by IFAT with a titre of l/40 or higher. The following standard sera were used for the ELISA and Western blot: (1) a hightitred B. cabaili serum pool; (2) a low-titred B. cabafli serum pool; (3) a pool of sera from horses not infected with Babesia spp. Sera considered positive for B. cabalii by ELISA reacted with a delta value (X 103) larger than 13.669. Sera considered positive for B. caballi by IFAT reacted with a titre of l/80 or higher.\n\nSera from foals taken in the first month after birth contained high levels of maternal antibodies against B. cab& as indicated by positive ELISA and IFAT reactions. High titres in the first month of life were followed by an interval with decreased reactions. None of the B. caballi antigens was detected consistently by maternal antibodies on Western blots. If detected, maternal antibodies were reactive with the 48 kDa antigen (Fig. 1 lanes 1 and 2) or with one or two of the other diagnostic antigens (Table 1) . Seroconversion was demonstrated by both ELISA and Western blot (Fig. 1, Table 1 ) in all feats between the 2nd and 5th month of age. By IFAT sero-conversion was detectable between the 3rd and 7th month. Positive Western blot reactions showed the typical B. cab& banding pattern as described previously (B&e & Daemen, 1992) . Major babesial antigens recognized by Brazilian sera were the same as those recognized by European sera, i.e. antigens of 48 and 50 kDa, 70, 112 and 141 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 3) . In the course of infection the antigens of 48 and 50 kDa appeared first and remained throughout the examination period (Table  1 ). The 48 kDa antigen was consistently recognized already from the 2nd month, the 50 kDa antigen from the 5th month of age (Table 1) . From the 79 sera taken from the 5th month of age, when all foals were infected, 78 reacted with the 48 kDa antigen, 76 with the 50 kDa, 50 with the 70 kDa, 54 with the 112 kDa, and 72 with 141 kDa antigen. The kinetics of the antibody response of all sera from foals tested is given in Table 1 . Ail sera from the 29 horses older than 1 year reacted in the ELISA and the sera from 14 horses were also positive by IFAT. By Western blot all sera from 7 horses between 1 and 3 years of age showed strong reactions with the 48, 50 and 141 kDa antigen bands and usually also with the 70 and 112 kDa antigens (data not illustrated). Sera from 7/22 horses older than 3 years reacted strongly, whereas sera from 15/22 horses showed a weak albeit specific banding pattern (Fig. 2, lane 4) .\n\nWe demonstrated, that at least the 5 diagnostic antigens described previously (Base & Daemen, 1992) are present not only in European, but also in South American strains of B. cabafli. This indicates that some antigens are probably highly conserved among all strains of the parasite. From the conserved antigens known, the 48 and 50 kDa antigens are particularly useful as these antigens are recognized early and continuously throughout the infection. Unfortunately maternal antibodies were not regularly detected by any of the B. caballi antigens on Western blots, although both ELISA and IFAT were positive. Thus a test based on one of these B. caballi antigens would probably not detect maternal antibodies reliably. Maternal antibodies however, are of little significance for the identification of carrier horses (export testing). It is interesting to note that sero-conversion against the 48 kDa antigen was demonstrated early in the infection before most other antigens were detected (Table 1) . This indicates that this antigen is expressed in the early phase of the infection and is readily recognized by the immune system. Other antigens particulary the 112 and 141 kDa were usually not recognized until several months after infection. By the age of 1 year all horses strongly recognized most or all diagnostic antigens. With most sera from older horses however, weak reactions were observed by Western blotting. As most antigens including the 48, 50, and 141 kDa antigens are still recognized, a test employing these antigens should be able to detect older carrier horses as well."}
